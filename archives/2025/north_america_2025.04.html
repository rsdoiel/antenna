id="in-us-punxsutawney-phil-sees-his-shadow-predicting-6-more-weeks-of-wintry-weather">In
US, Punxsutawney Phil sees his shadow, predicting 6 more weeks of wintry
weather</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PUNXSUTAWNEY, Pa. — U.S. groundhog Punxsutawney Phil saw his shadow
Sunday and predicted six more weeks of wintry weather, his top-hatted
handlers announced to a raucous, record-sized crowd at Gobbler’s Knob in
Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Phil was welcomed with chants of “Phil, Phil, Phil,” and pulled from
a hatch on his tree stump shortly after sunrise before a member of the
Punxsutawney Groundhog Club read from a scroll in which he boasted:
“Only I know — you can’t trust A.I.”</p>
<p>The woodchuck’s weather forecast is an annual ritual that goes back
more than a century in western Pennsylvania, with far older roots in
European folklore, but it took Bill Murray’s 1993 “Groundhog Day” movie
to transform the event into what it is today, with tens of thousands of
revelers at the scene and imitators scattered around the United States
and beyond.</p>
<p>When Phil is deemed to have not seen his shadow, that is said to
usher in an early spring. When he does see it, there will be six more
weeks of winter.</p>
<p>The crowd was treated to a fireworks show, confetti and live music
that ranged from the Ramones to “Pennsylvania Polka” as they awaited
sunrise and Phil’s emergence. Gov. Josh Shapiro, local and state elected
officials and a pair of pageant winners were among the dignitaries at
the scene.</p>
<p>Self-employed New York gingerbread artist Jon Lovitch has attended
the event for 33 years. “I like the cold, you know, and this is probably
the best and biggest midwinter party in the entire world,” Lovitch said
in Punxsutawney. “And it’s just a really good time.”</p>
<p>Phil has predicted a longer winter far more often than an early
spring, and one effort to track his accuracy concluded he was right less
than half the time. What six more weeks of winter means is
subjective.</p>
<p>Tom Dunkel, president of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club, says there
are two types of people who make the trek to Gobbler’s Knob: the
faithful seeking to validate their beliefs and the doubters who want to
confirm their skepticism.</p>
<p>Phil communicated his forecast to Dunkel through “Groundhog-ese” with
the help of a special cane that Dunkel has inherited as the club’s
leader. It’s not as if he speaks in English words. “He’ll like wink,
he’ll purr, he’ll chatter, he’ll — you know — nod,” Dunkel said.</p>
<p>Attendance is free but it cost $5 to take a bus and avoid a 1.6
kilometer trek from the middle of town to the stage where the prediction
was made, some 123 kilometers northeast of Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>The need for so many buses is why the local schools, where the sports
mascot is the Chucks, close when Groundhog Day falls on a weekday.</p>
<p>Keith Post, his wife and a friend have watched the “Groundhog Day”
movie in each of the past five years and decided this was the time to
make the trip from Ohio to witness the event.</p>
<p>“We booked rooms almost a year in advance and we’re here,” Post said.
“We’re doing it.”</p>
<p>A new welcome center opened four years ago and the club is working on
an elaborate second living space for Phil and family so they can split
time between Gobbler’s Knob and Phil’s longtime home at the town
library. The club also put up large video screens and more powerful
speakers this year to help attendees in the back of the crowd follow the
proceedings.</p>
<p>“It’s a holiday where you don’t really owe anyone anything,” said
A.J. Dereume, who among the club’s 15-member inner circle serves as
Phil’s handler and held him up to loud cheers on Sunday. “You’re
grasping onto the belief, you know, in something that’s just fun to
believe in.”</p>
<p>Jackie Handley agreed a year ago to visit Punxsutawney for the first
time to help a friend check off an item on their bucket list. They were
ready for the subfreezing temperatures. “It’s once in a lifetime — we’re
probably not going to come back. And we have tons of warm clothes,” said
Handley, who lives in Falls Church, Virginia. After the forecast was
made, club members and Phil posed for photos with people from the
crowd.</p>
<p>Phil has a wife, Punxsutawney Phyllis, and two pups born this spring,
Shadow and Sunny, although his family did not join him on stage for the
big event. The groundhog family eats fruits and vegetables, get daily
visits from Dereume and sees a veterinarian at least once a year. The
club’s lore is that Phil is the same woodchuck who has been issuing
weather forecasts for the past century, thanks to an “elixir of life”
that keeps him immortal. “There’s only one Phil, and it’s not something
that can be handed down,” Dunkel said. “Just like Santa Claus and the
Easter Bunny, there’s only one.”</p>
<p>Groundhog Day celebrations, formal and informal, were being held in
many Pennsylvania towns and elsewhere on Sunday. There have been
Groundhog Day events in at least 28 U.S. states and Canadian
provinces.</p>

id="beyonce-competes-for-the-big-prize---again---at-sundays-grammys">Beyonce
competes for the big prize - again - at Sunday’s Grammys</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — The Grammy Awards take center stage in Los Angeles on
Sunday at a celebration that will honor the best of music while
acknowledging the deadly wildfires that scarred a hub of the
industry. </p>
<p>Beyonce will compete for the top Grammy prize of album of the year
with her country record “Cowboy Carter.” The superstar singer has never
won the album trophy despite winning 32 career Grammys, more than any
other musician. </p>
<p>Also in the running for album of the year are megastar Taylor Swift
for “The Tortured Poets Department” and Billie Eilish for “Hit Me Hard
and Soft.” </p>
<p>The ceremony will be broadcast live on CBS starting at 8 p.m. ET
(0100 GMT on Monday) from the Crypto.com Arena in downtown Los Angeles.
Comedian Trevor Noah returns to host the telecast, which will be part
awards show, part fundraiser for musicians and others impacted by the
recent fires. Hundreds of people in the music business were among those
who lost homes in the disaster. </p>
<p>“It will be a little tricky to pull off, but I’m starting to think
they’re going to be able to do it,” said Paul Grein, awards editor at
music publication Billboard. With the fires under control, “people can
take a breather and express gratitude and relief that we made it through
that.” </p>
<p>Eilish and best new artist nominees Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter,
Benson Boone and Teddy Swims are among the night’s scheduled performers.
The show will feature a tribute to Quincy Jones, the prolific music
producer who died in November. </p>
<p>At last year’s Grammys, Beyonce’s husband and rapper Jay-Z argued
that voters had not given proper recognition to Black artists including
his wife. Grammy winners are chosen by the 13,000 singers, songwriters,
producers, engineers and others who make up the Recording Academy. </p>
<p>“I don’t want to embarrass this young lady, but she has more Grammys
than anyone and never won album of the year. So even by your own
metrics, that doesn’t work,” Jay-Z said on stage. </p>
<p>“Cowboy Carter” was viewed by experts and fans as a reclamation and
homage to an overlooked legacy of Black Americans within country music
and culture. It became the first album by a Black woman to land at No. 1
on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart when it was released last
spring. </p>
<p>The Beyonce album was snubbed, however, by voters for the Country
Music Awards in their nominations in September. </p>
<p>The “Cowboy Carter” nomination is Beyonce’s fifth entry in the album
of the year category. Swift has won the honor a record four times,
including last year for “Midnights.” </p>
<p>Beyonce leads all Grammy nominees this year with 11 nods, followed by
Eilish, Charli XCX, Kendrick Lamar and Post Malone with seven
nominations each. Swift landed six nominations and will present one of
the night’s awards. </p>
<p>Beyonce’s other Grammy nods include record and song of the year for
single “Texas Hold ’Em.” </p>
<p>Competitors for song of the year, an award for songwriters, are
Eilish for “Birds of a Feather,” Carpenter for “Please Please Please”
and Roan for “Good Luck, Babe!” </p>
<p>In record of the year, nominees include Carpenter’s “Espresso” and
Swift’s duet with Post Malone, “Fortnight.”</p>

id="artists-help-fellow-creators-who-lost-works-archives-in-l.a.-fires">Artists
help fellow creators who lost works, archives in L.A. fires</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — Anthony Obi never imagined the night of Jan. 7 would be
the last time he’d step inside his safe haven. </p>
<p>The Houston rapper, known professionally as Fat Tony, has lived in
the Altadena neighborhood for a year and says he and his neighbors were
prepared for heavy winds and perhaps a few days of power outages. </p>
<p>“I totally expected, you know, maybe my windows are going to get
damaged, and I’ll come back in, like, a day or two and just clean it
up,” said the rapper. </p>
<p>But residents like Obi woke up the following morning to news that
thousands of homes and entire neighborhoods had been burned to ash,
destroyed by flames that wiped out large areas of Pacific Palisades and
Altadena. Although the neighborhoods are on opposite ends of the county,
they are known hubs for many of the city’s creative community, housing
filmmakers, actors, musicians and artists of various mediums. </p>
<p>“L.A. is not just rich, famous people who have giant mansions that
were destroyed,” said visual artist Andrea Bowers, who is helping
artists recover. “So many members of our community lost everything. They
lost all their artworks and their archives - that’s irreplaceable, a
lifetime of labor and a lifetime of research.” </p>
<p>“A lot of my collectors lost their homes,” said figurative and
conceptual artist Salomon Huerta, who lost his Altadena home of three
years to the Eaton fire and worries the art scene in L.A. will downsize
as a result of the wildfire. “Before the fire, I was in talks with
certain collectors. And then, after the fire, they’re not in a good
place to talk. I’m hoping that there’s support so that the art scene can
still thrive. But it’s going to be tough.” </p>
<p>Obi and Huerta lost not only personal treasures, business
opportunities and homes but also vital equipment and professional
archives, adding to their emotional burden. </p>
<p>Huerta left behind slides and transparencies of past work that he had
planned to digitize for an upcoming book. </p>
<p>“Everything’s gone,” Obi said. “All of my stuff that is related to
Fat Tony music that was in that house is gone, and it was the motherlode
of it.” </p>
<p>Grief and Hope </p>
<p>Kathryn Andrews never imagined she’d experience another wildfire in
her lifetime. </p>
<p>The conceptual artist was forced to flee her Pacific Palisades
neighborhood as smoke drew near, the second time in four years she’s had
to escape a wildfire. </p>
<p>She lost her Juniper Hills property to the 2020 Bobcat fire, which
burned a large section of rural Los Angeles County. </p>
<p>“I’ve already experienced one home being burned. I think you have a
different focus after that. Maybe we become a little bit less attached
to material things. And we began looking at a bigger long-term picture,
thinking about, you know, how we live together in community, how we live
in relation to the land and how we can work together to solve this,” she
said. </p>
<p>Andrews is the co-founder of relief effort Grief and Hope, which aims
to support creatives financially as they enter the long road ahead and
was founded alongside a group of gallery directors, art professionals
and artists like Bowers, Ariel Pittman, Olivia Gauthier and Julia V.
Hendrickson. </p>
<p>“Our primary goal is getting people triage money for just whatever
the most emergent need is,” said Pittman. </p>
<p>The fundraising effort began shortly after the fires broke out with a
Go Fund Me seeking $500,000. They have now raised over $940,000 of their
new $1 million goal via The Brick, a nonprofit art space. As of Tuesday,
Grief and Hope had received more than 450 inquiries, and Pittman said
the funds would be evenly distributed to applicants. The deadline for
artists to submit a needs survey has concluded, but the relief effort
will continue fundraising until mid-March. </p>
<p>Grief and Hope also has five different groups of volunteers providing
peer-to-peer support, helping with medical needs, safety issues and
renter’s issues, and collecting survey data to better serve their
creative community. </p>
<p>“These are people who already have made very long-term commitments in
their work, including the five of us, towards building community and
building sustainability around artists and art workers in our city and
beyond,” said Pittman. </p>
<p>For Grief and Hope, creating a more sustainable future for artists
throughout the city begins with affordable studio spaces and
housing. </p>
<p>Long road ahead </p>
<p>For photographer Joy Wong, losing her home of eight years meant
losing the beauty of Altadena. She described the overall area as “a
pocket of heaven.” </p>
<p>“I didn’t want to leave,” said Wong, who safely evacuated with her
husband and 2-year-old daughter. “We were just so in love with this
house, and it wasn’t just my house. It was also my studio space.” </p>
<p>Many, like Obi, Wong and Huerta, have started GoFundMe accounts.
Meanwhile, initiatives and relief efforts have popped up around Southern
California, ready to assist with clothing donations, art supplies,
professional equipment for creatives and more. </p>
<p>“I’m applying to everything,” said Obi, who needs to replace his
instruments and recording equipment. </p>
<p>Wong said she’s received much support from family, friends and
colleagues. </p>
<p>“I think I just have to kind of lean on the community and get back
into shooting,” she said. “I got to get all my gear back, too. It’s
going to be a long road, but it’ll be OK.” </p>
<p>Arts scene rebirth </p>
<p>Superchief Gallery co-founder and director Bill Dunleavy said he
believes that this is an opportunity to rebuild long-needed
infrastructure for the arts throughout Los Angeles. </p>
<p>“Quite a lot was lost in the areas affected by the fire. And it’s
going to affect rent prices and studio prices and art markets and
everything else,” said Dunleavy. “I’ve been so impressed with the amount
of compassion that people feel and the sense of duty people have felt to
help with this. … I hope that continues into the coming years.” </p>
<p>Creative director Celina Rodriguez said she hopes freelance artists
and creatives continue to work and shoot production or projects
throughout the city, rather than leaving because of the wildfires. </p>
<p>“Having lost so many locations that we would shoot, typically in
Malibu, Topanga, the Palisades, all throughout, we will have to
absolutely come together and figure out how we can continue working in
Los Angeles … and urge people to shoot productions here,” she said. </p>
<p>Rodriguez and Dunleavy began collecting donations at the Downtown Los
Angeles gallery and within 48 hours transformed it into a bustling
donation center with over 150 volunteers. The duo are now working with
displaced families to make sure their daily needs are being met. </p>
<p>Dunleavy said the relief effort has only encouraged him to take this
work beyond just the donation center and explore the possibilities of
nonprofit work for the community. </p>
<p>“All of our wheels are turning now that we’ve seen the power that
just self-organizing can have.”</p>

<h2 id="the-great-north-american-trade-war-is-here">The Great North
American Trade War Is Here</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-02, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NjEzMDUzMC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczOTcwMTExNX0.gi2v93PbaOvqwiIHIvfQTueBFmFeeHif9CaHF1MbqrI/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
On Saturday evening, President Donald Trump signed orders placing 25%
tariffs on all goods imported from Canada and Mexico, and a lower, 10%
tariff on Canadian oil, natural gas, uranium, and other energy sources.
</p>
<p>
Trump also imposed a 10% tariff on all goods imported from China.
</p>
<p>
The tariffs will go into effect on Tuesday, giving Trump — who revels in
proposing tariffs but has shown some reluctance to impose them for real
— another 48 hours to maneuver. But if the new tariffs do actually bite,
then they will affect nearly half of America’s imports and reshape some
of the world’s most important energy and trading relationships.
</p>
<p>
Every day, millions of barrels of oil and cubic feet of natural gas flow
across the U.S., Canada, and Mexico borders. The three countries have
developed an integrated and harmonized network of pipelines, storage
tanks, and refineries that has helped turn the United States into the
world’s No. 1 producer of oil and natural gas.
</p>
<p>
The tariffs will almost inevitably disrupt that relationship. They may
also upset the millions of dollars’ worth of electricity that shuttles
from Canada to the United States every day across their shared power
grids.
</p>
<p>
The tariffs will prove economically painful, although just how damaging
is hard to know in advance. They could shrink the United States’ GDP by
0.4%, while increasing taxes by $830 per household, according to
<a href="https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/trump-tariffs-trade-war/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>an
analysis</u></a> by the Tax Foundation, a center-right think tank.
Another estimate from
<a href="https://budgetlab.yale.edu" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
Budget Lab at Yale</u></a> says that the tariffs could push up the
personal consumption expenditures price index — the Fed’s chosen
inflation gauge — by 0.75%, reducing the average household’s purchasing
power by $1,200 over the course of a year.

These costs could worsen as Mexico, Canada, and China raise their own
tariffs or trade barriers in retaliation. Late on Saturday, Prime
Minister Justin Trudeau announced that Canada would impose its own 25%
tariffs on CA$155 billion of goods imported from the United States.
</p>
<p>
The economic hit to the U.S. economy could also be much larger than
estimated if some manufacturers respond to higher costs not by hiking
prices, but rather by delaying or shutting down production.
</p>
<p>
We’ve been reporting on the economic impact of these tariffs at Heatmap
over the past week, documenting their potential impacts for
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-canada-oil-tariffs" target="_self"><u>oil
refineries</u></a> and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/canada-tariffs-electricity" target="_self"><u>the
electricity grid</u></a>. But now that the details are here, a few
things stand out.
</p>
<p>
<strong>First, the tariffs on China are qualitatively different from the
tariffs on our North American neighbors — especially Canada.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Chinese tariffs are not new. Trump engaged China in a trade war during
his first term and ultimately reached a handshake agreement, although he
has since said that China did not buy enough American agricultural
products to keep up its end of the bargain. Some of the tariffs Trump
placed on Chinese imports last time — including eye-watering levies on
solar panels — remain in effect; the new 10% tariff will be added to
those figures.
</p>
<p>
What did <em><em>not </em></em>happen last time was a serious,
out-and-out trade war with Canada and Mexico, America’s neighbors and
biggest trading partners. Although Trump entertained the possibility of
Mexican tariffs during the campaign, he did not propose tariffs on
Canadian imports until after his November election.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Second, the tariffs are
</strong><em><strong><em>quantitatively</em></strong></em><strong>
different, too.</strong> The president has not yet explained why he has
placed higher tariffs on Canada and Mexico, who are our allies, than on
China, which is our economic frenemy at best and our geostrategic
adversary at worst. During the campaign, Trump sometimes proposed a
“universal tariff” of 10% to 20% on all American imported goods,
regardless of their country of origin. That proposed universal tariff —
which was seen by some analysts as an extreme and unlikely proposal —
was at a<em><em> lower </em></em>rate than what he is now levying on
North American imports.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Third, this trade war has apparently been concocted and planned
much more haphazardly than the one during Trump’s first term.</strong>
Last time, the U.S. was careful to exempt electronics — iPhones,
laptops, Xboxes — from its levies, as well as other consumer products.
These tariffs do not do so, at least not yet. Nor do they exempt certain
minerals that are essential to manufacturing electric vehicle batteries
or other high-end electronics. (<em><em>Bloomberg </em></em>has reported
that as recently as Friday, Tesla
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-31/tesla-fights-tariffs-on-ev-graphite-putting-musk-at-odds-with-trump" target="_blank"><u>was
lobbying</u></a> for an exemption for graphite, a mineral crucial to
making EV anodes.)
</p>
<p>
<strong>Finally, what is so striking about these tariffs is how they
will be good for almost nobody.</strong>
</p>
<p>
The tariffs will hurt the American oil industry. As I
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-canada-oil-tariffs" target="_self"><u>wrote
earlier this week</u></a>, U.S. energy companies have spent tens of
billions of dollars on special equipment that can refine the sludgy,
sulfurous crude oil extracted in Canada; Canadian companies, in turn,
have sold us that crude oil at a discount and built infrastructure so
that it can be used by the United States.
</p>
<p>
The tariffs will hurt oil refineries. The U.S. refines
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=62624#:~:text=U.S.%20refining%20capacity%20increased%20this,with%20the%20start%20of%202023." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>about
18 million barrels of oil</u></a> a day, but it extracts — even today,

refines and what it extracts is made up by heavy crude from Canada and
Mexico, which blends well with the lighter petroleum produced by U.S.
fracking wells. By raising the cost of Canadian and Mexican fuel
imports, the cost of all refined products will rise.
</p>
<p>
The tariffs will hurt anyone who buys gasoline in the Midwest and
Mountain West, where Canadian oil plays a much larger role in local
markets. They will hurt diesel and jet fuel prices in those regions too.
</p>
<p>
But the damage will not be limited to the fossil fuel industry.
</p>
<p>
The tariffs will hurt anyone who uses electricity across the parts of
the country, especially the Northeast, that import large amounts of
electricity from Canada’s roaring hydroelectric plants.
</p>
<p>
The tariffs will hurt home builders and construction companies because
the United States gets its best building-grade lumber from Canada. That
lumber — already made more expensive
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/01/why-climate-change-pushing-lumber-prices/621288/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>by
a climate change-intensified supply crisis</u></a> — will now face
additional taxes at the border.
</p>
<p>
The tariffs will hurt anyone who wants to buy or rent a home in the
United States because the lack of lumber will worsen the housing
shortage and general affordability crisis.
</p>
<p>
They will hurt automakers, who in the past three decades have
constructed sophisticated supply chains spanning North America — a
logistical dance that allows a single vehicle’s components and parts to
cross the U.S., Canadian, and Mexico borders many times on their way to
becoming a final product. They will hurt autoworkers, who depend on that
supply chain. They will even hurt car dealerships, who will respond to
higher prices by selling less inventory.
</p>
<p>
If the dollar rises to accommodate the new tariff level, as some White
House officials have argued, then the tariffs will hurt <em><em>all
</em></em>U.S. domestic manufacturers because their products will become
more expensive, and therefore less competitive on the global market.
</p>
<p>
I am not saying, to be clear, that these tariffs are an economic
catastrophe. We don’t actually know their economic cost yet — perhaps it
will be minimal. But even then, they will still be a stupid waste of
money that will help nobody, and which will make the U.S. economy
neither more complex nor more secure.
</p>
<p>
The tariffs are a warning. As recently as last week, Goldman Sachs
analysts
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/pkrugman.bsky.social/post/3lh5rc7we2c2i" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>put
the risk of tariffs</u></a> at only a 20% chance of actually happening.
They ignored what Trump had said<em> </em>he would do because it struck
them as too implausible, too unwise, too patently harmful. Perhaps in
the next two days they will be proven right. But Trump has begun to
blather about many unwise and harmful ideas — invading Panama (where
Secretary of State Marco Rubio is headed
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/01/us/politics/rubio-panama-canal-trump.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>right
now</u></a>), annexing Greenland, making Canada (somehow) the 51st
state. Many seem even more implausible than these tariffs, and yet
Donald Trump says that he wants to do them, too. How much longer can
Republican lawmakers and business leaders pretend that he doesn’t mean
what he says? The chance of calamity has only just begun.

says life-saving HIV treatment can continue during aid pause</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. State Department said Saturday that the
President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) – the world’s
leading HIV initiative – was covered by a waiver for life-saving
humanitarian assistance during a 90-day pause in foreign aid.</p>
<p>Just hours after taking office on Jan. 20, President Donald Trump
ordered the pause so foreign aid contributions could be reviewed to see
if they align with his “America First” foreign policy. The U.S. is the
world’s largest aid donor.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio initially issued a waiver for
emergency food aid and then Tuesday for life-saving medicine, medical
services, food, shelter and subsistence help. However, the lack of
detail in Trump’s order and the ensuing waivers has left aid groups
confused as to whether their work can continue.</p>
<p>So, Saturday the State Department’s Bureau of Global Health Security
and Diplomacy issued a memo, seen by Reuters, clarifying that PEPFAR was
covered by the Jan. 28 memo and spelling out what activities were
allowed.</p>
<p>These include life-saving HIV care and treatment services, including
testing and counseling, prevention and treatment of infections including
tuberculosis (TB), laboratory services, and procurement and supply chain
for commodities/medicines. It also allows prevention of mother-to-child
transmission services.</p>
<p>“Any other activities not specifically mentioned in this guidance may
not be resumed without express approval,” it said.</p>
<p>More than 20 million people living with HIV, who represent two-thirds
of all people living with the disease receiving treatment globally, are
directly supported by PEPFAR.</p>
<p>Under Trump’s foreign aid pause, all payments by U.S. Agency for
International Development (USAID) stopped Tuesday — for the first time
since the fiscal year began on Oct. 1 — and have not resumed, according
to U.S. Treasury data. On Monday USAID paid out $8 million and last week
a total of $545 million.</p>
<p>The Trump administration is also moving to strip a slimmed-down USAID
of its independence and put it under State Department control, two
sources familiar with the discussions said Friday, in what would be a
significant overhaul of how Washington allocates U.S. foreign aid.</p>

<h2 id="us-strikes-stronghold-of-islamic-state-affiliate-in-somalia">US
strikes stronghold of Islamic State affiliate in Somalia</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. warplanes took aim at the Islamic State affiliate
in Somalia, hitting what officials described as high-ranking operatives
in the terror group’s mountainous stronghold.</p>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump announced the precision strike Saturday
on social media, describing the main target as a “Senior ISIS Attack
Planner and other terrorists he recruited and led.”</p>
<p>“These killers, who we found hiding in caves, threatened the United
States and our Allies,” Trump said. “The strikes destroyed the caves
they live in, and killed many terrorists without, in any way, harming
civilians.”</p>
<p>A separate statement from U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said
the strikes targeted an area in Somalia’s Golis mountains, and “further
degrades ISIS’s ability to plot and conduct terrorist attacks
threatening US citizens, our partners, and innocent civilians.”</p>
<p>Neither Trump nor Hegseth named the IS planner, though U.S. officials
said the strikes were carried out in coordination with the Federal
Government of Somalia.</p>
<p>General Adan Abdi Hashi, commander of the Puntland Devish Forces said
the airstrikes targeted at least 10 locations of the Islamic State
militants in the Cal-Miskaad area, which is part of the Golis
mountains.</p>
<p>“The strikes targeted about 10 locations in the Cal-Miskaad areas,
most of them caves, and we believe that many of the militants were
killed,” said the general.</p>
<p>Residents in Qandala, a small town in Bari region of Puntland told
VOA on the condition of anonymity because they feared for their lives,
that they could see from the distance plumes of smoke and flames, and
that they could hear at least seven huge explosions.</p>
<p>Officials from Somalia’s semi-autonomous Puntland region thanked the
U.S. on social media, calling the operation a success.</p>
<p>“The latest airstrike, carried out today, resulted in the elimination
of several high-ranking #ISIS members,” according to the statement.</p>
<p>U.S. Africa Command, which oversees U.S, military efforts on the
continent, said it, too, assessed multiple terror operatives had been
killed.</p>
<p>The Islamic State, also known as IS or Daesh, has increasingly played
a key role in the terror group’s operations in Africa and beyond.</p>
<p>Since 2022, Somalia has been home to al-Karrar, one of nine regional
Islamic State offices established to help sustain the terror group’s
capabilities. As a result, IS-Somalia has become both a key cog in the
IS financial network, funneling money to affiliates in Afghanistan and
elsewhere in Africa.</p>
<p>IS-Somalia has, at the same time, become more influential under the
leadership of Abdulkadir Mumin, a former militant with the
al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab, who is thought to now head IS’ directorate of
provinces, overseeing the terror group’s affiliates in Africa.</p>
<p>Some U.S. officials worry Mumin has risen even higher, perhaps acting
as the Islamic State’s top emir. Others disagree but there is consensus
that Mumin is nonetheless a pivotal figure.</p>
<p>The U.S. previously targeted Mumin in May of last year.</p>
<p>Recent intelligence assessments have further warned IS-Somalia has
more than doubled in size over the past year and may now boast up to as
many as 1,600 fighters, bolstered by an influx of fighters from
Ethiopia, Morocco, Sudan, Syria, Tanzania and Yemen.</p>
<p>Most of IS-Somalia’s manpower has been concentrated in Puntland,
especially in the Golis Mountains, also known as the Cal-Miskaad
mountains.</p>
<p>Saturday’s airstrike, the first against IS in Somalia so far this
year, was carried out by fighter jets launched from the USS Harry S.
Truman, currently in the Red Sea, according to defense officials who
spoke to VOA on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss details
of the operation.</p>
<p>It comes as Somali forces in Puntland continue a military offensive
against ISIS militants hiding in Cal-Miskaad mountains. Puntland also
thanked the United Arab Emirates which they say provided air support to
the ongoing offensive.</p>
<p>The operations, which started in late December, drove militants from
vast areas in the northeastern highlands of Somalia.</p>
<p>The militants, many of them foreigners, have claimed carrying out IED
attacks against Puntland forces.</p>
<p>The fiercest clashes occurred late last week when the regional forces
dislodged the militants from Turmasaale, a strategic location about 150
kilometers southeast of Bosaso.</p>
<p>The Somali government called Saturday’s airstrikes by the U.S. “a
critical step in our shared fight against terrorism.”</p>
<p>“The Federal Government of Somalia welcomes the firm and decisive
counterterrorism efforts led by the United States,” it said in a
statement. “Together, we will continue to dismantle extremist networks …
and build a future free from the scourge of terrorism.”</p>

<h2 id="trump-places-tariffs-on-canada-mexico-china">Trump places
tariffs on Canada, Mexico, China</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WHITE HOUSE — U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order
Saturday that places 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico and
10% tariffs on goods from China starting Tuesday, the White House
said.</p>
<p>“Both Canada and Mexico have allowed an unprecedented invasion of
illegal fentanyl that is killing American citizens, and also illegal
immigrants into our country,” White House press secretary Karoline
Leavitt said during her briefing Friday.</p>
<p>Trump, who is spending the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago estate in
Florida, was not scheduled to speak to reporters.</p>
<p>While Canadian goods will face a 25% tariff, Trump said he would
tariff Canadian crude oil imports at 10%. Mexico’s energy imports are
included in its 25% tariffs. For Canada alone, Trump canceled the “de
minimis” tariff exemption for shipments worth less than $800.</p>
<p>China’s 10% would be on top of various existing tariffs on its
goods.</p>
<p>Under the order, there is no process to seek an exception, but there
is one to escalate the tariff rates if the countries retaliate.</p>
<p>Mexico and Canada responded later Saturday while China denounced
Trump’s action Sunday but left open the possibility for talks to avoid
worsening the situation.</p>
<p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum ordered retaliatory tariffs in
response to the U.S. move, saying in a post on X that her government
would prefer dialogue but had been forced to respond.</p>
<p>“I’ve instructed my economy minister to implement the plan B we’ve
been working on, which includes tariff and nontariff measures in defense
of Mexico’s interests,” she wrote.</p>
<p>She also rejected “the White House’s slander that the Mexican
government has alliances with criminal organizations, as well as any
intention of meddling in our territory.”</p>
<p>“If the United States government and its agencies wanted to address
the serious fentanyl consumption in their country, they could fight the
sale of drugs on the streets of their major cities, which they don’t do,
and the laundering of money that this illegal activity generates that
has done so much harm to its population,” she wrote.</p>
<p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Saturday that Canada
would retaliate against the U.S. action with 25% tariffs on U.S. goods,
saying that the tariffs would apply to $155 billion in U.S. goods, with
those on $30 billion to go into effect Tuesday those on the other $125
billion in 21 days.</p>
<p>He also said Canada is looking at nontariff measures, possibly
relating to critical minerals, energy and other partnerships.</p>
<p>China on Sunday denounced the U.S. tariff on China, saying it would
challenge the move in at the World Trade Organizations and take
“corresponding countermeasures to resolutely safeguard our own rights
and interests.”</p>
<p>While its Commerce Ministry said the U.S. move “seriously violates”
international trade rules, it urged Washington to “engage in frank
dialogue and strengthen cooperation.”</p>
<p>‘Negative impact’ predicted</p>
<p>China, Mexico and Canada account for more than one-third of the goods
and services imported into or bought from the United States.</p>
<p>Some economists warn that the tariffs could backfire.</p>
<p>Imports from Mexico and Canada make up around 3% of U.S. gross
domestic product, while exports make up around 2.5% of U.S. GDP, Brad
Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said.</p>
<p>A 25% tariff on Mexico and Canada amounts to a “tax hike on imports
from those countries” and will “have an immediate and negative impact on
the U.S. economy,” he told VOA. “It’s a strategy for shrinking the U.S.
economy.”</p>
<p>Trump has long threatened to impose tariffs to pressure countries to
help his administration stop illegal immigration and the smuggling of
chemicals used for fentanyl. He has pledged to use tariffs to boost
domestic manufacturing and has praised their use as an effective
economic policy.</p>
<p>Trump believes that “tariffs are a great source of leverage,” and
that he will “convince Canada and Mexico to make big concessions under
the threat of tariffs,” Setser said. “But these measures are going to be
pretty costly to the U.S.”</p>
<p>Trump acknowledged that the tariffs might cause a “short-term
disruption” for consumers but said they would lead to a long-term
benefit for U.S. manufacturing.</p>
<p>“Tariffs don’t cause inflation. Tariffs cause success,” he added.</p>
<p>Trump had vowed Friday to impose sweeping tariffs on semiconductors,
pharmaceuticals, steel and aluminum, and oil and gas.</p>
<p>“All forms of medicine and pharmaceuticals,” Trump said. “And we’ll
be doing, very importantly, steel, and we’ll also be doing chips and
things associated with chips.”</p>
<p>Trump warned he would “absolutely” place tariffs on goods from the
European Union.</p>
<p>“They’re treating us so badly,” he said.</p>
<p>In imposing the tariffs, he invoked the International Emergency
Economic Powers Act. The White House said Saturday the act was needed
because of “the extraordinary threat posed by illegal aliens and drugs,
including deadly fentanyl, constitutes a national emergency.”</p>
<p>Free trade agreement</p>
<p>During his first administration, in 2018, Trump negotiated and signed
the United States-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement, in part to narrow
the large U.S. trade deficit — the gap between what it exports and what
it imports — with its neighbors. He once called the deal “the fairest,
most balanced and beneficial trade agreement we have ever signed into
law.”</p>
<p>However, the U.S. trade deficit in goods with Mexico has widened from
$106 billion in 2019 to $161 billion in 2023, according to government
data. The trade gap in goods with Canada has also increased, from $31
billion in 2019 to $72 billion in 2023.</p>
<p>“He’s now acting like his deal caused a disaster needing an emergency
fix,” said Derek Scissors, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise
Institute.</p>
<p>There is no justification for high tariffs on Canada, a market
economy that is not in the top five of U.S. trade deficits, Scissors
said. “Fentanyl shipments across the Canadian border are tiny,” he
added.</p>
<p>Fentanyl and illegal migration are justifications for border
restrictions on Mexico, Scissors said. However, tariffs “don’t stop
illegal immigration and probably encourage it by threatening jobs in
Mexico.”</p>
<p>Some information for this report came from The Associated Press,
Reuters, and Agence France-Presse.</p>

media organizations ‘rotated’ out of Pentagon press corps offices</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration, in an
unprecedented move, announced late Friday it would remove four media
organizations including The New York Times from their dedicated office
spaces in the Pentagon, citing a desire to make room for others. </p>
<p>The memo on a “New Annual Media Rotation Program” said it would also
remove National Public Radio, NBC News and Politico, which must vacate
their spaces by February 14. In their place, it would give dedicated
office space to the New York Post, One America News Network, Breitbart
News Network and HuffPost News. </p>
<p>Each year going forward, one outlet from print, online, television
and radio will rotate out of the Pentagon “to allow a new outlet from
the same medium that has not had the unique opportunity to report as a
resident member of the Pentagon Press Corps,” the memo said. </p>
<p>“We’re disappointed by the decision to deny us access to a
broadcasting booth at the Pentagon that we’ve used for many decades,” an
NBC News spokesperson said by email. “Despite the significant obstacles
this presents to our ability to gather and report news in the national
public interest, we will continue to report with the same integrity and
rigor NBC News always has.” </p>
<p>The New York Times said it remained committed to covering the
Pentagon “fully and fairly” despite the move. </p>
<p>“Steps designed to impede access are clearly not in the public
interest,” The Times said in a statement. </p>
<p>NPR called on the Defense Department to expand office space available
so all media outlets covering the Pentagon receive equal access. </p>
<p>“This decision interferes with the ability of millions of Americans
to directly hear from Pentagon leadership, and with NPR’s public
interest mission to serve Americans who turn to our network of local
public media stations in all 50 states,” it said. </p>
<p>Politico did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside
regular business hours. </p>
<p>More than two dozen news organizations operate out of the Pentagon,
including Reuters, reporting on the daily activities of the U.S.
military. </p>
<p>“To be clear, the outlets that vacate the spaces loaned them by the
secretary (of defense) will remain full members of the Pentagon Press
Corps,” said John Ullyot, acting assistant to the secretary of defense
for public affairs. </p>
<p>“The only change will be giving up their physical workspaces in the
building to allow new outlets to have their turn to become resident
members of the Pentagon Press Corps.” </p>
<p>The Pentagon Press Association, which represents journalists who
cover the Defense Department, said it was “greatly troubled by this
unprecedented move by DOD to single out highly professional media.” </p>
<p>Reuters correspondent Phil Stewart is a member of the association’s
four-member board of directors.</p>

says Venezuela agrees to receive undocumented migrants captured in
US</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday that
Venezuela has agreed to receive all Venezuelan undocumented migrants
captured in the United States and pay for their transport.</p>
<p>“Venezuela has agreed to receive, back into their country, all
Venezuela illegal aliens who were encamped in the U.S., including gang
members of Tren de Aragua,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social.</p>
<p>He said Venezuela has also agreed to provide transportation.</p>
<p>The Venezuelan government did not immediately reply to a request for
comment.</p>
<p>U.S. envoy Richard Grenell met with Venezuelan President Nicolas
Maduro in the South American country on Friday. Hours after their
meeting, six American hostages were released and returned to the United
States from Venezuela.</p>
<p>The announcement of Venezuela’s decision to accept the return of its
citizens who were illegally in the United States comes one week after
Trump threatened to impose tariffs and sanctions after Colombia refused
to accept military flights carrying deportees.</p>
<p>Colombia reversed its course and agreed to accept migrants following
the threats.</p>
<p>“We are in the process of removing record numbers of illegal aliens
from all countries,” said Trump, who vowed to crack down on illegal
immigration in his 2024 presidential campaign.</p>
<p>Trump, a Republican, issued an array of executive orders to crack
down on illegal immigration after taking office on Jan. 20, including
actions aimed at deporting record numbers of migrants in the U.S.
without legal status.</p>

<strong>What led you to start Zero Emissions Northwest? </strong>
</p>
<p>
I’ve been in energy for coming up on two decades, so I’ve got experience
in the space. Then the second thing that happened was I married a
farmer’s daughter outside of Spokane — so a 10,000-acre wheat farm — and
that got me a lot closer to agriculture than I had ever been. And the
last thing, about four years ago, I looked at my father in law’s shop
and said, there’s got to be a grant for a farmer to put solar on their
shop. I found the Rural Energy for America Program, wrote him a grant,
successfully won it, and then about six of his neighbors came by and
said, “Hey, how’d you get him money? I want money to go and improve my
farm.” So then I was the most experienced person in eastern Washington.
And the USDA launched a contract called the
<a href="https://www.rd.usda.gov/programs-services/energy-programs/rural-energy-america-technical-assistance-grant-program" target="_blank"><u>Technical
Assistance contract</u></a>, which we won in Idaho and Washington. And
that’s when I quit my job and started ZEN.
</p>
<p>
In rough numbers, our projects have won about $4 million worth of grant
support, and that $4 million worth of grant support is matched by
private capital. And then those projects are going to save $20 million
over their useful life. So call it $30 million of total investment in
rural communities, because the money saved on these farms doesn’t go to
anything other than fertilizer for next year’s crop, and seed, wheat,
and maintenance and mechanics. All of this gets reinvested in making
that farm better or making that business better.
</p>
<p>
<strong>How did you learn that ZEN would be impacted by Trump’s
executive order? </strong>
</p>
<p>
We talked to people in the government, and they have repeatedly told us
that obligated grants have never been removed. So we were operating on
the understanding that once a project is obligated, we can then start
working and helping that farmer execute on that project. So Trump takes
office, we’re still heads down doing what we’re doing — and we do have
this belief that the work that we’re doing is exactly the work that
Trump wants to see.
</p>
<p>
We get paid roughly about four times a year, so basically a quarterly
invoice. So we haven’t been paid since October. We submitted an invoice
in early January for our normal operating procedures, and the USDA
processed that in the first week of the Trump administration, and said,
“Cool. They’ve done everything, press pay<em><em>,</em></em>” and it
didn’t go through. We were told verbally that there were back-end
restrictions.
</p>
<p>
We thought it was all
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-memo-climate-programs" target="_self"><u>tied
to this OMB thing</u></a>. On Tuesday night, [the OMB memo]
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-pause-federal-grants-aid-f9948b9996c0ca971f0065fac85737ce" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>was
blocked</u></a>, and then on Wednesday,
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-pause-federal-grants-aid-6d41961940585544fa43a3f66550e7be" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>it
was rescinded</u></a>. And all of that’s happening in real time with
everybody in the country — not just us citizens, but employees as well.
Bureaucrats going, <em><em>we’re learning about this by tweet, too!
</em></em>And then on Wednesday, we learned in real time with our
partners that [the pause in funding] was actually
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>from
an executive order</u></a>, not from the OMB memo. We made the decision
that day to furlough our employees. If this goes for 90 days, it’ll be
six months of us not getting paid on our largest source of revenue.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Have the farmers and small businesses that you work with had to
halt their in-process projects? </strong>
</p>
<p>
It varies for each project. We have a handful of solar projects that are
up, and we’re just waiting on a utility interconnection. So those
projects we’re finishing. We’ve got equipment like new washing machines
en route to a rural laundromat. That’s going to still happen, because
he’s already bought them, but his second invoice is going to become due
when those show up on site. So he doesn’t really know what’s going on
and how to pause that. But if you haven’t started on your project, we’re
advising people to not take on more risk by spending money and [instead]
just pausing [their projects].
</p>
<p>
<strong>I know it’s only been a few days, but what efforts have you made
thus far to get in touch with the federal government? </strong>
</p>
<p>
I’ve got a long list of people that we’re trying to get in touch with.
I’ve told all of our customers — many of whom are in the GOP in eastern
Washington and northern Idaho — to call their representatives, as well
as if they have Twitter, tweet at Donald Trump. So we’re trying to
empower our customers to really advocate for their projects, and that’s
our main focus.
</p>
<p>
I’m sure a majority of our customers voted for Donald Trump and voted
for the GOP representatives, and we just want them to really explain how
this is damaging their business and their farm.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Given that many of your customers support President Trump, what
has their reaction to this funding freeze been like? </strong>
</p>
<p>
Everybody expected that funding would continue. That was the message
that we were getting from the USDA — the obligated funds have been
obligated, the government has signed a contract. So everybody was
surprised about that. But I’ll be honest, their reactions are mixed.
Some farmers are furious. They have spent this money. They have taken on
a risk. They did so with the expectation that the government would honor
their contract. So that’s one category. We have another category of
farmer that kind of lumps this into weather — things they can’t control.
There’s much more understanding if you did vote for Donald Trump. We
have had a farmer say, “Maybe they’ll find some waste and it’ll filter
through, and we’ll eventually get paid. We can’t control that, but this
might be a good thing for our country.” To which I replied, I want the
filter first, not second!
</p>
<p>
But nobody thinks that their project doesn’t fit this mold of unleashing
American energy. Nobody is really doubting that they might eventually
get paid, because this is aligned with what everybody wants. We’re
helping farmers take control of their costs, generate onsite power, or
conserve energy through upgrades that really benefit their bottom line
and really improve their own farm. We’re helping them reinvest in
themselves through the process. We prioritize Made in America equipment
wherever possible. We want to see these tax dollars and these incentives
stay in the country. So we’ve actually never had a farmer choose to go
with a non-Made in America solar system.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Even if this funding pause ends soon, how do you think about the
future of your organization given President Trump’s apparent antipathy
toward renewable energy and energy efficiency projects — or at least
language that highlights any sustainability-related benefits? </strong>
</p>
<p>
If we’re going to go and apply for more contracts to the USDA, one of my
big concerns right now is if we’re talking about [renewable energy and
energy efficiency], are we going to get blacklisted from doing the work
that we do in rural Washington? We have always been, with our customer
base, really focused on finance, cost savings, practicality — and then
all of the decarbonization benefits of this stuff is very secondary for
all of our projects.
</p>
<p>
When I named the company, all of those things were also in question,
right? I called a farmer and said, “Hi, it’s David Funk from Zero
Emissions Northwest.” And they said, “What? You don’t fart?” And he hung
up on me. We think about, how are we being viewed by our customers? And
with the politicalization of language, are we losing out on a market
segment that we could be helping, just because somebody looks at our
name and says, well, I’m not gonna work with them? It’s an active
discussion always, how we present ourselves on paper.

government web pages have gone dark complying with Trump orders</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Several U.S. government web pages changed or went dark Friday as
agencies scrambled to comply with President Donald Trump’s executive
orders declaring his administration would recognize only two genders and
ordering an end to diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.</p>
<p>In a letter sent Wednesday, the Office of Personnel Management
directed agency heads to terminate grants and contracts related to
“gender ideology,” ask staff to remove pronouns from their government
emails and disband resource groups on the issue, too. The directive,
which ordered agencies to institute changes by 5 p.m. Friday, also asked
agencies to remove the term “gender” from government forms and swap it
out with “sex.”</p>
<p>Here is a list of changes and missing pages seen so far. Several
pages have popped up since being taken down, some with changes:</p>
<p>National Park Service pages for historic sites related to the
internment of Japanese Americans, the Tuskegee Airmen and the Stonewall
Uprising for gay rights were inaccessible. The Tuskegee site was back
online a short time later, but the others remained down Friday
evening.</p>
<p>The State Department removed the “X” gender marker and replaced
“gender” with “sex” on online consular forms. A page with tips for
lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and intersex travelers was
altered. It’s now titled “LGB Travelers” instead of “LGBTQIA+
Travelers.”</p>
<p>The Census Bureau’s homepage was down. Links to reports and topic
pages outlining details about the gender identity, sexual orientation
and characteristics of the nation’s population returned errors. A
message Friday afternoon for one topic page titled “Sexual Orientation
&amp; Gender Identity” read, “The area of census.gov that you are trying
to access is currently unavailable due to maintenance.” Another page
titled “Mental Health Struggles Higher Among LGBT Adults Than Non-LGBT
Adults in All Age Groups” also was unavailable. Archives of both pages
show they were accessible within the past week. The bureau’s homepage
was up Saturday morning.</p>
<p>Intelligence Community Inspector General reports were scrubbed from
the website of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.
Trump previously fired around 17 inspectors general — known as
independent government watchdogs — at multiple federal agencies.</p>
<p>A Bureau of Prisons web page originally titled “Inmate Gender” was
relabeled “Inmate Sex” on Friday. A breakdown of transgender inmates in
federal prisons was no longer included.</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website took down much
public health information: contraception guidance; a fact sheet about
HIV and transgender people; lessons on building supportive school
environments for transgender and nonbinary kids; details about National
Transgender HIV Testing Day; a set of government surveys showing
transgender students suffering higher rates of depression, drug use,
bullying and other problems. The agency also removed its data
repository, data.cdc.gov. A message said “the website will resume
operations once in compliance” with Trump’s executive order.</p>
<p>In addition, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the military to
immediately stop recognizing identity months, including Black History
Month, Women’s History Month, Asian American and Pacific Islander
Heritage Month, National Hispanic Heritage Month, National Disability
Employment Awareness Month and National American Indian Heritage
Month.</p>

marks Black History Month while Pentagon declares ‘identity months
dead’</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Trump White House issued a proclamation Friday
recognizing February as Black History Month around the same time the
U.S. Defense Department issued guidance declaring “identity months
dead.”</p>
<p>The conflicting messages came as President Donald Trump has been
targeting diversity, equity and inclusion programs for removal in the
first weeks of his administration. He has referred to DEI initiatives as
“discrimination” and insisted that the country must instead move toward
a merit-based society.</p>
<p>The White House proclamation calls for “public officials, educators,
librarians and all the people of the United States to observe this month
with appropriate programs, ceremonies and activities,” though there is
no elaboration on what constitutes “appropriate.”</p>
<p>A news release from the Defense Department titled “Identity Months
Dead at DOD” says official resources, including working hours, will no
longer be used to mark cultural awareness months. Black History Month,
Women’s History Month and National Disability Employment Awareness Month
were among the events listed as now barred.</p>
<p>“We are proud of our warriors and their history, but we will focus on
the character of their service instead of their immutable
characteristics,” the Defense Department release read.</p>
<p>In his first two weeks in office, Trump has moved to end affirmative
action in federal contracting and directed that all federal DEI workers
be put on paid leave before eventually being laid off. On Thursday,
hours after a midair collision between a military helicopter and an
American Airlines plane killed 67 people just miles from the White
House, Trump baselessly blamed diversity initiatives for undermining air
safety, despite no evidence of that.</p>
<p>Gerald Ford in 1976 became the first president to issue a message
recognizing February as Black History Month. Since then, presidents have
made annual proclamations marking the month as a celebration of Black
history, culture and education.</p>
<p>Trump’s proclamation Friday specifically noted the contributions of
abolitionists Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman, conservative
economist Thomas Sowell and Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. It
said their achievements “have monumentally advanced the tradition of
equality under the law in our great country” and are a continued
inspiration.</p>
<p>The declaration also listed golfer Tiger Woods as an American great,
saying he was among those who have “pushed the boundaries of excellence
in their respective fields, paving the way for others to follow.”</p>
<p>“This National Black History Month, as America prepares to enter a
historic Golden Age,” the proclamation said, “I want to extend my
tremendous gratitude to black Americans for all they have done to bring
us to this moment, and for the many future contributions they will make
as we advance into a future of limitless possibility under my
administration.”</p>

to elect leader as party struggles to regroup</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>OXON HILL, MARYLAND — Democrats, seeking a new message and messengers
to push back against the Trump administration, will elect a new leader
Saturday in a low-profile Democratic National Committee election that
could have big implications for the party’s future.</p>
<p>More than 400 DNC members from every state and U.S. territory have
gathered in suburban Washington for the election, which features a slate
of candidates dominated by party insiders. Outgoing Chair Jaime Harrison
is not seeking reelection.</p>
<p>Most of the candidates acknowledge that the Democratic brand is badly
damaged, but few are promising fundamental changes. Indeed, nearly three
months after Donald Trump won the popular vote and gained ground among
key Democratic constituencies, there is little agreement on what exactly
went wrong.</p>
<p>Facing an emboldened Trump presidency, however, the leading
candidates are talking tough. “As we reel with shock at the horror that
Trump is visiting on communities across this country, we need a DNC and
a DNC chair who’s ready to bring the intensity, the focus and the fury
to fight back,” said Ben Wikler, the Wisconsin Democratic chair and a
top candidate for DNC chair.</p>
<p>The election comes less than two weeks after Trump’s inauguration and
as Democratic leaders struggle to confront the sheer volume of executive
orders, pardons, personnel changes and controversial relationships
taking shape in the new administration. The next DNC chair would serve
as a face of the Democratic response, while helping to coordinate
political strategy and repair the party’s brand.</p>
<p>Just 31% of voters have a favorable opinion of the Democratic Party,
according to a Quinnipiac University poll released this week that offers
a dramatic contrast with Trump’s GOP. Forty-three percent of voters have
a favorable opinion of the Republican Party.</p>
<p>The leading candidates for DNC chair, Wisconsin’s Wikler and
Minnesota’s Ken Martin, are low-profile state party chairs. They’re
promising to refocus the Democratic message on working-class voters,
strengthen Democratic infrastructure across the country and improve the
party’s anti-Trump rapid response system. They have promised not to shy
away from the party’s dedication to diversity and minority groups, a
pillar of the modern-day Democratic Party.</p>
<p>But if Martin, 51, or Wikler, 43, is elected, as expected, either
would be the first white man to lead the DNC since 2011.</p>
<p>Also in the race: Marianne Williamson, the activist and author;
former Maryland governor and Biden administration official Martin
O’Malley; and Faiz Shakir, who managed Bernie Sanders’ last presidential
campaign.</p>
<p>Shakir has called for sweeping changes within the party, such as more
coordination with labor unions and less focus on minority groups sorted
by race and gender. The only Muslim seeking the chairmanship, Shakir was
alone during a candidate forum this week in opposing the creation of a
Muslim caucus at the DNC. But he has struggled to gain traction. Shakir
declined to raise money for the contest, decorating his modest booth at
this week’s gathering with pictures drawn by his young children with
crayons.</p>
<p>By contrast, Martin and Wikler hosted would-be supporters in large
hotel suites adorned with dozens of professionally printed signs and
offered T-shirts, sunglasses and food.</p>
<p>Wikler has faced questions about his relationship with Democratic
donor Reid Hoffman, the billionaire cofounder of LinkedIn. But he cast
his fundraising connections as an asset. Indeed, the DNC chair is
expected to raise tens of millions of dollars to help Democrats win
elections.</p>
<p>Some Democratic leaders remain concerned about the direction of their
party. “As positive as I am and as hopeful as I am, I’m watching this in
real time, thinking to myself, ‘We’re in real trouble because I don’t
see a desire to change,’” said Kansas Democratic Chair Jeanna Repass, a
candidate for DNC vice chair.</p>

<h2
id="trump-administration-fires-prosecutors-involved-in-jan.-6-cases">Trump
administration fires prosecutors involved in Jan. 6 cases</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Friday fired a group of
prosecutors involved in the Jan. 6 criminal cases and demanded the names
of FBI agents involved in those same probes so they can possibly be
ousted, moves that reflect a White House determination to exert control
over federal law enforcement and purge agencies of career employees seen
as insufficiently loyal.</p>
<p>Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove ordered the firings of the
Jan. 6 prosecutors days after President Donald Trump’s sweeping clemency
action benefiting the more than 1,500 people charged in the U.S. Capitol
attack, according to a memo obtained by The Associated Press. About two
dozen employees at the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington were
terminated, said a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the
condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss
personnel issues.</p>
<p>A separate memo by Bove identified more than a half-dozen FBI senior
executives who were ordered to retire or be fired by Monday, and also
asked for the names, titles and offices of all FBI employees who worked
on investigations into the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot — a list the
bureau’s acting director said could number in the thousands. Bove, who
has defended Trump in his criminal cases before joining the
administration, said Justice Department officials would then carry out a
“review process to determine whether any additional personnel actions
are necessary.”</p>
<p>“As we’ve said since the moment we agreed to take on these roles, we
are going to follow the law, follow FBI policy, and do what’s in the
best interest of the workforce and the American people — always,” acting
FBI Director Brian Driscoll wrote in a letter to the workforce.</p>
<p>The prosecutors fired in the D.C. U.S. attorney’s office had been
hired for temporary assignments to support the Jan. 6 cases but were
moved into permanent roles after Trump’s presidential win in November,
according to the memo obtained by the AP. Bove, the acting deputy
attorney general, said he would not “tolerate subversive personnel
actions by the previous administration.”</p>
<p>Any mass firings at the FBI would be a major blow to the historic
independence from the White House of the nation’s premier federal law
enforcement agency but would be in keeping with Trump’s persistent
resolve to bend the law enforcement and intelligence community to his
will. It would be part of a startling pattern of retribution waged on
federal government employees, following the forced ousters of a group of
senior FBI executives earlier this week as well as a broad termination
by the Justice Department of prosecutors on special counsel Jack Smith’s
team who investigated Trump.</p>
<p>The FBI Agents Association said the reported efforts to oust agents
represented “outrageous actions by acting officials” that were
“fundamentally at odds with the law enforcement objectives outlined by
President Trump and his support for FBI Agents.”</p>
<p>“Dismissing potentially hundreds of Agents would severely weaken the
Bureau’s ability to protect the country from national security and
criminal threats and will ultimately risk setting up the Bureau and its
new leadership for failure,” the association said in a statement.</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear what recourse any fired agent might
take, but the bureau has a well-defined process for terminations and any
abrupt action that bypasses that protocol could presumably open the door
to a legal challenge.</p>
<p>When pressed during his confirmation hearing Thursday, Trump’s pick
for FBI director, Kash Patel, said he was not aware of any plans to
terminate or otherwise punish FBI employees who were involved in the
Trump investigations. Patel said if he was confirmed he would follow the
FBI’s internal review processes for taking action against employees.</p>
<p>Asked by Democratic Senator Cory Booker whether he would reverse any
decisions before his confirmation that don’t follow that standard
process, Patel said, “I don’t know what’s going on right now over there,
but I’m committed to you, senator, and your colleagues, that I will
honor the due process of the FBI.”</p>
<p>Before he was nominated for the director’s position, Patel had
remarked on at least one podcast appearance about what he called
anti-Trump “conspirators” in the government and news media who he said
needed to be rooted out.</p>
<p>Trump has for years expressed fury at the FBI and Justice Department
over investigations that shadowed his presidency, including an inquiry
into ties between Russia and his 2016 campaign, and continued over the
last four years. He fired one FBI director, James Comey, amid the Russia
investigation and then replaced his second, Christopher Wray, just weeks
after his win in November.</p>
<p>Asked at the White House on Friday if he had anything to do with the
scrutiny of the agents, he said: “No, but we have some very bad people
over there. It was weaponized at a level that nobody’s never seen
before. They came after a lot of people — like me — but they came after
a lot of people.”</p>
<p>He added, “If they fired some people over there, that’s a good thing,
because they were very bad.”</p>
<p>The FBI and Smith’s team investigated Trump over his efforts to
overturn the 2020 presidential election and his hoarding of classified
documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Both of those cases
resulted in indictments that were withdrawn after Trump’s November
presidential win because of longstanding Justice Department policy
prohibiting the federal prosecution of a sitting president.</p>
<p>The Justice Department also charged more than 1,500 Trump supporters
in connection with the Capitol riot, although Trump on his first day in
office granted clemency to all of them — including the ones convicted of
violent crimes — through pardons, sentence commutations and dismissals
of indictments.</p>
<p>This week, the Justice Department fired more than a dozen prosecutors
who worked on Smith investigations, and a group of senior FBI executives
— including several executive assistant directors and agents in charge
of big-city field offices — have been told to either resign or retire or
be fired Monday.</p>

id="trump-moves-to-cancel-recent-union-agreements-with-federal-workers">Trump
moves to cancel recent union agreements with federal workers</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Donald Trump said Friday that any collective bargaining agreements
reached with federal workers within 30 days of his inauguration will not
be approved, the latest salvo in the U.S. president’s bid to remake the
federal workforce.</p>
<p>In a memo addressed to the heads of all executive departments and
agencies, Trump said former U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration
purposefully finalized collective bargaining agreements with federal
employees in its final days “in an effort to harm my administration by
extending its wasteful and failing policies beyond its time in
office.”</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear how many agreements would be affected by
the new policy, which refers to them as “lame-duck collective bargaining
agreements.”</p>
<p>Collective bargaining agreements are deals between unions and their
employees that outline working conditions, pay and other policies.</p>
<p>The move comes as President Donald Trump embarks on a massive
makeover of the U.S. government, firing and sidelining hundreds of civil
servants in his first steps toward downsizing the bureaucracy and
installing more loyalists.</p>
<p>The memo cites a U.S. Department of Education collective bargaining
agreement reached three days before Trump took office that “generally
prohibits the agency from returning remote employees to their
offices.”</p>
<p>Trump has signed an executive order that would require federal
employees to work in-office five days a week, reversing a remote working
trend that took off in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

id="mushers-dogs-braved-alaska-winter-to-deliver-lifesaving-serum-100-years-ago">Mushers,
dogs braved Alaska winter to deliver lifesaving serum 100 years ago</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ANCHORAGE, ALASKA — The Alaska Gold Rush town of Nome faced a bleak
winter. It was hundreds of miles from anywhere, cut off by the frozen
sea and unrelenting blizzards, and under siege from a contagious disease
known as the “strangling angel” for the way it suffocated children. </p>
<p>Now, 100 years later, Nome is remembering its saviors — the sled dogs
and mushers who raced for more than five days through hypothermia,
frostbite, gale-force winds and blinding whiteouts to deliver lifesaving
serum and free the community from the grip of diphtheria. </p>
<p>Among the events celebrating the centennial of the 1925 “Great Race
of Mercy” are lectures, a dog-food drive and a reenactment of the final
leg of the relay, all organized by the Nome Kennel Club. </p>
<p>Alaskans honor ‘heroic effort’ </p>
<p>“There’s a lot of fluff around celebrations like this, but we wanted
to remember the mushers and their dogs who have been at the center of
this heroic effort and … spotlight mushing as a still-viable thing for
the state of Alaska,” said Diana Haecker, a kennel club board member and
co-owner of Alaska’s oldest newspaper, The Nome Nugget. </p>
<p>“People just dropped whatever they were doing,” she said. “These
mushers got their teams ready and went, even though it was really cold
and challenging conditions on the trail.” </p>
<p>Other communities are also marking the anniversary — including the
village of Nenana, where the relay began, and Cleveland, Ohio, where the
serum run’s most famous participant, a husky mix named Balto, is stuffed
and displayed at a museum. </p>
<p>Jonathan Hayes, a Maine resident who has been working to preserve the
genetic line of sled dogs driven on the run by famed musher Leonhard
Seppala, is recreating the trip. Hayes left Nenana on Monday with 16
Seppala Siberian sled dogs, registered descendants of Seppala’s
team. </p>
<p>A race to save lives</p>
<p>Diphtheria is an airborne disease that causes a thick, suffocating
film on the back of the throat; it was once a leading cause of death for
children. The antitoxin used to treat it was developed in 1890, and a
vaccine in 1923; it is now exceedingly rare in the U.S. </p>
<p>Nome, western Alaska’s largest community, had about 1,400 residents a
century ago. Its most recent supply ship had arrived the previous fall,
before the Bering Sea froze, without any doses of the antitoxin. Those
the local doctor, Curtis Welch, had were outdated, but he wasn’t
worried. He hadn’t seen a case of diphtheria in the 18 years he had
practiced in the area. </p>
<p>Within months, that changed. In a telegram, Welch pleaded with the
U.S. Public Health Service to send serum: “An epidemic of diphtheria is
almost inevitable here.” </p>
<p>The first death was a 3-year-old boy on January 20, 1925, followed
the next day by a 7-year-old girl. By the end of the month, there were
more than 20 confirmed cases. The city was placed under quarantine. </p>
<p>West Coast hospitals had antitoxin doses, but it would take time to
get them to Seattle, Washington, and then onto a ship for Seward,
Alaska, an ice-free port south of Anchorage, Alaska. In the meantime,
enough for 30 people was found at an Anchorage hospital. </p>
<p>It still had to get to Nome. Airplanes with open-air cockpits were
ruled out as unsuited for the weather. There were no roads or trains
that reached Nome. </p>
<p>Instead, officials shipped the serum by rail to Nenana in interior
Alaska, some 1,086 kilometers (675 miles) from Nome via the frozen Yukon
River and mail trails. </p>
<p>Thanks to Alaska’s new telegraph lines and the spread of radio, the
nation followed along, captivated, as 20 mushers — many of them Alaska
Natives — with more than 150 dogs relayed the serum to Nome. They
battled deep snow, whiteouts so severe they couldn’t see the dogs in
front of them, and life-threatening temperatures that plunged at times
to minus minus 51 degrees Celsius (60 degrees Fahrenheit).</p>
<p>The antitoxin was transported in glass vials covered with padded
quilts. Not a single vial broke. </p>
<p>Seppala, a Norwegian settler, left from Nome to meet the supply near
the halfway point and begin the journey back. His team, led by his dog
Togo, traveled more than 320 kilometers (250 miles) of the relay,
including a treacherous stretch across frozen Norton Sound. </p>
<p>After about 5 1/2 days, the serum reached its destination on February
2, 1925. A banner front-page headline in the San Francisco Chronicle
proclaimed “Dogs victors over blizzard in battle to succor stricken
Nome.” </p>
<p>The official record listed five deaths and 29 illnesses. It’s likely
the toll was higher; Alaska Natives were not accurately tracked. </p>
<p>Balto gains fame </p>
<p>Seppala and Togo missed the limelight that went to his assistant,
Gunnar Kaasen, who drove the dog team led by Balto into Nome. Balto was
another of Seppala’s dogs, but was used to only haul freight after he
was deemed too slow to be on a competitive team.</p>
<p>Balto was immortalized in movies and with statues in New York’s
Central Park and one in Anchorage intended as a tribute to all sled
dogs. He received a bone-shaped key to the city of Los Angeles, where
legendary movie actress Mary Pickford placed a wreath around his
neck. </p>
<p>But he and several team members were eventually sold and kept in
squalid conditions at a dime museum in Los Angeles. After learning of
their plight, an Ohio businessman spearheaded an effort to raise money
to bring them to Cleveland, a city in Ohio. After dying in 1933, Balto
was mounted and placed on display at the Cleveland Museum of Natural
History. </p>
<p>Iditarod pays homage to run </p>
<p>Today, the most famous mushing event in the world is the Iditarod
Trail Sled Dog Race, which is not based on the serum run but on the
Iditarod Trail, a supply route from Seward to Nome. Iditarod organizers
are nevertheless marking the serum run’s centennial with a series of
articles on its website and by selling replicas of the medallions each
serum run musher received a century ago, race spokesperson Shannon
Noonan said in an email. This year’s Iditarod starts March 1. </p>
<p>“The Serum Run demonstrated the critical role sled dogs played in the
survival and communication of remote Alaskan communities, while the
Iditarod has evolved into a celebration of that tradition and Alaska’s
pioneering spirit,” Noonan said.</p>

id="what-to-know-about-the-ntsb-the-agency-investigating-the-dc-plane-crash">What
to know about the NTSB, the agency investigating the DC plane crash</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — A collision between an American Airlines passenger jet
and an Army helicopter near Washington, D.C., that killed 67 people
brought renewed focus on the federal agency charged with investigating
aviation disasters.</p>
<p>National Transportation Safety Board Chairwoman Jennifer Hommendy has
described the investigation into the crash as an “all-hands-on-deck
event” for the agency.</p>
<p>Here are some things to know about the NTSB:</p>
<p>What does the agency do?</p>
<p>The NTSB is an independent federal agency responsible for
investigating all civil aviation accidents as well as serious incidents
in the U.S. involving other modes of transportation, such as railroad
disasters and major accidents involving motor vehicles, marine vessels,
pipelines and even commercial space operators.</p>
<p>“We’re here to ensure the American people that we are going to leave
no stone unturned in this investigation,” Homendy said, noting the probe
is in the very early stages. “We are going to conduct a thorough
investigation of this entire tragedy, looking at the facts.”</p>
<p>The agency has five board members who serve five-year terms and are
nominated by the president and confirmed by the U.S. Senate.</p>
<p>How will the investigation work?</p>
<p>For the investigation into Wednesday’s crash, the NTSB will establish
several different working groups, each responsible for investigating
different areas connected to the accident, board member Todd Inman
said.</p>
<p>Inman said those groups include operations, which will examine flight
history and crewmember duties; structures, which will document airframe
wreckage and the accident scene; power plants, which will focus on
aircraft engines and engine accessories; systems, which will study the
electrical, hydraulic and pneumatic components of the two aircraft; air
traffic control, which will review flight track surveillance
information, including radar, and controller-pilot communications;
survival factors, which will analyze the injuries to the crew and
passengers and crash and rescue efforts; and a helicopter group.</p>
<p>The investigation also will include a human-performance group that
will be a part of the operations, air traffic control and helicopter
groups and will study the crew performance and any factors that could be
involved such as human error, including fatigue, medications, medical
histories, training and workload, Inman said.</p>
<p>How long will the investigation take?</p>
<p>NTSB officials did not say Thursday how long the investigation would
take, but accident investigations often take between one to two years to
complete. The agency typically releases a preliminary report within a
few weeks of the accident that includes a synopsis of information
collected at the scene.</p>
<p>What is the NTSB’s history?</p>
<p>The NTSB history dates to 1926, when Congress passed a law charging
the U.S. Department of Commerce with investigating aircraft accidents.
It was established as an independent agency within the U.S. Department
of Transportation in 1967 and then separated by Congress in 1974 as a
stand-alone organization, fully independent from any other federal
agencies. Since its creation in 1967, the agency reports it has
investigated more than 153,000 aviation accidents and incidents.</p>

id="trumps-funding-block-hits-program-for-burmese-students-scholars">Trump’s
funding block hits program for Burmese students, scholars</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to block $45
million in U.S. federal funding for over 400 Burmese students has left
many in shock and dismay as their scholarships were abruptly
canceled.</p>
<p>The move also has raised concerns about the broader impact it could
have on Burmese in Myanmar, a country already grappling with political
turmoil and a collapsing education system under military rule.</p>
<p>Students in limbo</p>
<p>One Burmese student who studies at Chiang Mai University in Thailand
told VOA that she feels completely lost after learning that her
scholarship was being blocked.</p>
<p>“To be honest, I am lost because of this sudden loss of my
scholarship. I had been studying with the goal of earning a degree, and
now I don’t know what to do,” she said. The student spoke with VOA on
condition of anonymity because she fears for her safety if she returns
to Burma, which remains under military control.</p>
<p>She said students like her and others at different academic levels
are now left without financial support.</p>
<p>“There are students doing two-year master’s degrees, others in
four-year bachelor’s programs, and even PhD students. I don’t know
whether I should continue my studies, go home, or what my next step
should be,” she said.</p>
<p>An email sent to recipients of the program, which was shared with
VOA’s Burmese Service, stated that USAID had “exercised its right to
terminate” the Development and Inclusive Scholarship Program as of
Jan. 29, 2025. The email expressed “surprise and disappointment” over
the decision and assured students that officials are “looking closely at
next steps.” It did not confirm whether the scholarship would continue,
though, for those who already had received it.</p>
<p>DISP originally was called the Diversity and Inclusion Scholarship
Program but was recently renamed by USAID, replacing “Diversity” with
“Development.”</p>
<p>DISP was created to support Burmese students from marginalized and
underprivileged backgrounds, giving them opportunities to study at
universities across Asia, including the Philippines, Cambodia, Indonesia
and Thailand. The program also provided funding for online education
through the University of Arizona.</p>
<p>For many, the initiative was their only chance to pursue higher
education outside of Burma, where the junta-controlled education system
has systematically restricted access for those opposing the military
regime.</p>
<p>For some students, the immediate impact has been less severe.</p>
<p>Hlwan Paing Thi Ha, who has been studying at Chiang Mai University
for a year, told VOA: “My education has already been paid for through
the scholarship program, so it hasn’t impacted me yet. Other students
pursuing bachelor’s, master’s and PhD degrees will be severely
affected.”</p>
<p>Future leaders affected</p>
<p>One source who has in-depth understanding of the program said the
impact goes beyond just access to education and opportunities. The
source spoke with VOA on condition of anonymity because they are not
authorized to speak with the media.</p>
<p>More than a quarter of the Burmese students in the program have fled
Myanmar due to the military coup, ongoing fighting and forced
conscription, which has targeted youth.</p>
<p>“The impact is huge,” the source said, adding that currently, more
than 400 Burmese students are attending universities in four countries —
the Philippines, Cambodia, Indonesia and Thailand — through the
USAID-funded program.</p>
<p>“Of these, 110 were directly recruited from Myanmar, while the rest
are students who fled to border regions and Southeast Asian countries
due to the military coup or boycotted Myanmar’s junta-controlled
education system,” the source said.</p>
<p>The program, which was launched in February 2024, was designed as a
five-year initiative, with plans to recruit three batches of students
over that period.</p>
<p>“The goal was to ensure that at least 1,000 Burmese students, the
‘current and future leaders of the country,’ could continue their
studies in universities across the region. The second batch, which would
include hundreds of students, is now in the final stage of the screening
process,” the source explained.</p>
<p>Debate continues</p>
<p>In Washington, a debate over the block and review continues.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the State Department issued a waiver that exempts some
humanitarian aid from the freeze. U.S. lawmakers have also voiced
concerns, warning that the freeze will impact American soft power and
give China an advantage.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Trump defended the funding freeze, specifically calling
out the $45 million allocated for diversity scholarships for Burmese
students.</p>
<p>“We also blocked $45 million for diversity scholarships in Burma.
Forty-five — that’s a lot of money for diversity scholarships in Burma.
You can imagine where that money went,” Trump said. “These were the
types of payments and many others. I could stand here all day and tell
you about things that we found, and we have to find them quickly because
we want the money to flow to proper places.”</p>
<p>Name threatens its demise?</p>
<p>Some note that in addition to the freeze, the name of the program may
also leave it in a difficult position, with some worrying that the
mention of diversity in its title could impact a substantive review of
its impact.</p>
<p>The source with direct knowledge of the initiative for Burmese
students told VOA that the program was swiftly terminated when the Trump
administration began reducing foreign aid, and that its name, “Diversity
and Inclusion,” likely played a major role in its elimination.</p>
<p>“This program was one of the first to be cut as soon as the
administration began making budget reductions in this area,” the source
said.</p>
<p>While all USAID-funded programs have been temporarily frozen, DISP
appears to have been specifically blocked without any review, the source
noted.</p>
<p>“USAID officials have not been able to explain why this program was
halted so suddenly.”</p>
<p>VOA reached out to the State Department to verify whether the
Diversity and Inclusion Scholarship Program was permanently blocked or
still under review, and whether its name played a role in its swift
termination.</p>
<p>In an email response to VOA, a State Department spokesperson referred
to the president’s executive order on reevaluating and realigning United
States foreign aid and the department spokesperson’s statement on its
implementation.</p>
<p>The spokesperson reiterated Secretary of State’s Marco Rubio’s
remarks during his confirmation hearing, emphasizing the U.S. government
will ensure taxpayer dollars are spent wisely and in the best interest
of America.</p>
<p>The response did not clarify, however, whether DISP was individually
reviewed before being blocked or if existing scholarship recipients
would be allowed to complete their studies under prior funding
commitments.</p>
<p>Lifeline for ethnic, religious minorities</p>
<p>The source with direct knowledge of the program also voiced concern
the administration may not understand that the program has no connection
to Myanmar’s military junta and was created solely to support young
people who lost their education due to military oppression.</p>
<p>The Diversity and Inclusion Scholarship Program was established to
reflect Burma’s ethnic and religious diversity, giving equal
opportunities to students from all backgrounds who have historically
faced discrimination under the Burman-dominated and military-controlled
education policies. Burman is the name of the main ethnic group in
Myanmar.</p>
<p>Many recipients of the scholarship program belong to ethnic minority
groups such as the Karen, Kachin, Shan, Chin and Rohingya, who have
historically faced systemic discrimination in Burma’s education
system.</p>
<p>Nyein Chan from VOA’s Burmese Service contributed to this report.</p>

id="health-data-pages-wiped-from-federal-websites-as-trump-officials-target-gender-ideology">Health
data, pages wiped from federal websites as Trump officials target
‘gender ideology’</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Public health data disappeared from websites, entire webpages went
blank and employees erased pronouns from email signatures Friday as
federal agencies scrambled to comply with a directive tied to President
Donald Trump’s order rolling back protections for transgender
people.</p>
<p>The Office of Personnel Management directed agency heads to strip
“gender ideology” from websites, contracts and emails in a memo sent
Wednesday, with changes ordered to be instituted by 5 p.m. Friday. It
also directed agencies to disband employee resource groups, terminate
grants and contracts related to the issue, and replace the term “gender”
with “sex” on government forms.</p>
<p>Some parts of government websites appeared with the message: “The
page you’re looking for was not found.” Some pages disappeared and came
back intermittently.</p>
<p>Asked by reporters Friday about reports that government websites were
being shut down to eliminate mentions of diversity, equity and
inclusion, Trump said he didn’t know anything about it but that he’d
endorse such a move.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. That doesn’t sound like a bad idea to me,” Trump said,
adding that he campaigned promising to stamp out such initiatives.</p>
<p>Much public health information was taken down from the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention’s website: contraception guidance; a fact
sheet about HIV and transgender people; lessons on building supportive
school environments for transgender and nonbinary kids; details about
National Transgender HIV Testing Day; a set of government surveys
showing transgender students suffering higher rates of depression, drug
use, bullying and other problems.</p>
<p>Eliminating health resources creates dangerous gaps in scientific
information, disease experts said. The Infectious Diseases Society of
America, a medical association, issued a statement decrying the removal
of information about HIV and people who are transgender. Access is
“critical to efforts to end the HIV epidemic,” the organization’s
leaders said.</p>
<p>A Bureau of Prisons web page originally titled “Inmate Gender” was
relabeled “Inmate Sex” on Friday. A breakdown of transgender inmates in
federal prisons was no longer included.</p>
<p>The State Department on Friday removed the option to select “X” as a
gender on passport applications for nonbinary applicants. It also
replaced the word “gender” from the descriptor with the word “sex.”</p>
<p>All State Department employees were ordered to remove gender-specific
pronouns from their email signatures. The directive, from the acting
head of the Bureau of Management, said this was required to comply with
Trump’s executive orders and that the department was also removing all
references to “gender ideology” from websites and internal
documents.</p>
<p>“All employees are required to remove any gender identifying pronouns
from email signature blocks by 5:00 PM today,” said the order from Tibor
Nagy. “Your cooperation is essential as we navigate these changes
together.”</p>
<p>An official from the U.S. Agency for International Development said
staffers were directed to flag the use of the word “gender” in each of
thousands of award contracts. Warnings against gender discrimination are
standard language in every such contract. The official spoke on
condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal, under a Trump
administration gag order prohibiting USAID staffers from speaking with
people outside their agency.</p>
<p>The official said staffers fear that programs and jobs related to
inclusion efforts, gender issues and issues specific to women are being
singled out and possibly targeted under two Trump executive orders.</p>
<p>Some Census Bureau and National Park Service pages were also
inaccessible or giving error messages.</p>
<p>Trump’s executive order, signed on his first day back in office,
calls for the federal government to define sex as only male or female
and for that to be reflected on official documents such as passports and
policies such as federal prison assignments.</p>
<p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the military to immediately
stop recognizing identity a day before the start of February’s Black
History Month, saying they “erode camaraderie and threaten mission
execution.”</p>

id="at-least-7-people-dead-in-philadelphia-plane-crash-officials-say">At
least 7 people dead in Philadelphia plane crash, officials say</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA — At least seven people died when a
medevac plane crashed in Philadelphia on Friday, including six Mexicans
aboard the plane and one person who was on the ground, Mexico’s
president and Philadelphia’s mayor said on Saturday. </p>
<p>Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker told a press conference that the
person who died on the ground had been in a car at the site of the
crash. </p>
<p>“Thus far, our count is that there are 19 injured victims,” Parker
said. </p>
<p>Separately, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said in a post on X
that she had asked consular officials to support the families of the six
Mexican citizens who were on the plane and died when it crashed. </p>
<p>Jet Rescue Air Ambulance, based in Mexico and licensed to operate in
the United States, on Friday said its aircraft crashed with four crew
members, one pediatric medical patient and the patient’s mother on
board. </p>
<p>The child was a girl who had just completed treatment for a
life-threatening condition at Shriners Children’s Hospital and was on
her way home with a destination of Tijuana, Shai Gold, who works on
corporate strategy with Jet Rescue Air Ambulance, told CNN on Friday.
Her mother was also aboard, he said.</p>
<p>Gold said the aircraft was operated by a seasoned crew and everyone
involved in the company’s flights goes through rigorous training.</p>
<p>“When an incident like this happens, it’s shocking and surprising,”
Gold told The Associated Press. “All of the aircraft are maintained. Not
a penny is spared because we know our mission is so critical.”</p>
<p>Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro said at a news conference late
Friday that officials expected fatalities in the “awful aviation
disaster.”</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Temple University Hospital-Jeanes Campus, Jennifer
Reardon, said they had treated six people with injuries related to the
crash. Three of those people had since been released and the others were
in fair condition. She wasn’t able to provide information about their
injuries or where the people were when they sustained them.</p>
<p>The crash came just two days after the deadliest U.S. air disaster in
a generation. On Wednesday night, an American Airlines jet carrying 60
passengers and four crew members collided in midair in Washington with
an Army helicopter carrying three soldiers. There were no survivors.</p>
<p>The Philadelphia crash was the second fatal incident in 15 months for
Jet Rescue. In 2023, five crewmembers were killed when their plane
overran a runway in the central Mexican state of Morelos and crashed
into a hillside.</p>
<p>In Philadelphia, a doorbell camera captured video of the plane
plunging in a streak of white and exploding as it hit the ground near a
shopping mall and major road.</p>
<p>“All we heard was a loud roar and didn’t know where it was coming
from. We just turned around and saw the big plume,” said Jim Quinn, the
owner of the doorbell camera.</p>
<p>The crash happened less than 5 kilometers from Northeast Philadelphia
Airport, which primarily serves business jets and charter flights.</p>
<p>The Learjet 55 quickly disappeared from radar after taking off from
the airport at 6:06 p.m. and climbing to an altitude of 487 meters. It
was registered to a company operating as Med Jets, according to the
flight tracking website Flight Aware.</p>
<p>Shortly after 6 p.m., audio recorded by LiveATC captured an air
traffic controller telling “Medevac Medservice 056” to turn right when
departing. About 30 seconds later it repeats the request before asking,
“You on frequency?” Minutes later, the controller says, “We have a lost
aircraft. We’re not exactly sure what happened, so we’re trying to
figure it out. For now the field is going to be closed.”</p>
<p>In a post on the social media platform Truth Social, U.S. President
Donald Trump said, “So sad to see the plane go down in
Philadelphia.”</p>
<p>“More innocent souls lost,” he said. “Our people are totally
engaged.”</p>
<p>The FAA said the National Transportation Safety Board will lead the

box’ recovered from helicopter involved in Washington midair
collision</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. investigators say the “black box” recorder from an Army Black
Hawk helicopter was recovered Friday, as teams continue to search for
clues into the midair collision that killed 67 people near
Washington.</p>
<p>The Army helicopter and a commercial passenger jet collided late
Wednesday as the jet was attempting to land at Ronald Reagan Washington
National Airport.</p>
<p>Investigators said Friday evening that they are reviewing the flight
data recorder along with two from the plane that they found Thursday as
they try to understand what caused the crash over the Potomac River.</p>
<p>National Transportation Safety Board member J. Todd Inman told
reporters Friday the helicopter’s recorder appeared to be intact.</p>
<p>“We saw no exterior damage that would indicate it was compromised at
this time, so we have a high level of confidence we’ll have a full
extraction,” he said.</p>
<p>The NTSB is the federal agency leading the investigation into the
accident.</p>
<p>The commercial jet, a Bombardier CRJ700 regional craft operated by
American Airlines subsidiary PSA Airlines, carried 64 passengers and
crew, while the U.S. Army UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter carried a crew of
three. Officials say there were no survivors.</p>
<p>Fire and emergency service officials in Washington said Friday that
41 bodies have been recovered from the wreckage. Authorities said that
they would likely be unable to extricate more victims from the plane
without heavier equipment.</p>
<p>Inman said that barges from Virginia Beach will arrive Saturday to
begin more extensive salvage operations. He said rescue workers will
also make sure that the victims are recovered.</p>
<p>U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy announced Friday that
most helicopters would not be allowed to travel through and near Reagan
National Airport for the time being.</p>
<p>He wrote on social media platform X, “Today’s decision will
immediately help secure the airspace near Reagan Airport, ensuring the
safety of airplane and helicopter traffic.”</p>
<p>Speaking Friday before the helicopter’s black box was found, U.S.
Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the recorder would likely determine
who was piloting the helicopter at the time of the crash.</p>
<p>He said Thursday that the helicopter crew, which was conducting a
night-flight training evaluation, included a staff sergeant, a
captain-in-training, and a chief warrant officer, who was an instructor.
The crew had been issued night vision goggles for the flight, but
Hegseth said it was unclear if they were using them.</p>
<p>The defense secretary said the black box also could determine who was
in communication with the airport’s air traffic control tower and if
there was any confusion regarding the instructions they received.</p>
<p>Hegseth also said Thursday that the helicopter’s altitude at the time
of the accident was under investigation.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump said Friday that the Army helicopter was
flying too high at the time of the crash.</p>
<p>“It was far above the 200 foot limit. That’s not really too
complicated to understand, is it???” Trump said in a Friday morning post
on his Truth Social platform.</p>
<p>Citing a government report, The Washington Post reported Thursday
that the control tower was understaffed Wednesday night. The report said
two people were handling the jobs of four inside the tower at the time
of the collision.</p>
<p>A similar report from U.S. broadcaster NBC News, citing a source
familiar with the investigation, said a supervisor in the tower let an
air traffic controller leave their shift early before the collision.</p>
<p>That decision, the report said, left one controller to handle both
airplane traffic and helicopter traffic in the area, whereas typically
there is one controller looking at each type of aircraft.</p>
<p>The NBC report said it is allowable under Federal Aviation
Administration standards for one person to do both jobs, although it is
not considered optimal.</p>
<p>At a news conference Thursday, both Virginia U.S. Senators Tim Kaine
and Mark Warner said they had expressed concerns over the years
regarding the high volume of air traffic in the Washington area, but
that they would await results from the accident probe before revisiting
that specific concern.</p>
<p>During a White House news conference Thursday, Trump suggested
previous presidential administrations, led by Democratic Presidents
Barack Obama and Joe Biden, lowered standards for the hiring of air
traffic controllers and blamed diversity, equity and inclusion, DEI,
initiatives in the federal government for that.</p>
<p>He said he reversed those initiatives with executive orders last
week.</p>
<p>The U.S. Figure Skating organization said several members of its
community, including athletes, coaches and family members, were among
the passengers on the plane.</p>
<p>“We are devastated by this unspeakable tragedy and hold the victims’
families closely in our hearts,” the organization said.</p>
<p>The Kremlin and Russian media said Russian figure skaters, including
world champion couple Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov, also were on
the plane. Trump said his administration would facilitate the return of
their remains to Russia.</p>
<p>Some information for this report was provided by The Associated
Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.</p>

id="venezuela-frees-6-americans-after-meeting-between-maduro-trump-envoy">Venezuela
frees 6 Americans after meeting between Maduro, Trump envoy</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CARACAS, VENEZUELA — Six Americans who had been detained in Venezuela
in recent months were freed by the government of President Nicolas
Maduro after he met Friday with a senior Trump administration
official.</p>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump and his envoy for special missions,
Richard Grenell, announced the release of the six men on social media.
Grenell posted on X a photo showing him and the men aboard an
aircraft.</p>
<p>Grenell’s trip to Venezuela, according to the White House, was
focused on Trump’s efforts to deport Venezuelans back to their home
country, which currently does not accept them, and on the release of the
detained Americans.</p>
<p>“We are wheels up and headed home with these 6 American citizens,”
Grenell wrote on X. “They just spoke to <span class="citation"
data-cites="realDonaldTrump">@realDonaldTrump</span> and they couldn’t
stop thanking him.”</p>
<p>The visit by Grenell came as a shock to many Venezuelans who hoped
that Trump would continue the “maximum pressure” campaign he pursued
against the authoritarian Venezuelan leader during his first term.</p>
<p>Mauricio Claver-Carone, Trump’s special envoy to Latin America,
previewed Grenell’s visit to Caracas in a conference call with
journalists on Friday. He said Grenell, who served as U.S. ambassador to
Germany and acting director of national intelligence during Trump’s
first term, was in Venezuela on a “very specific mission” that in no way
detracts from the Trump administration’s goal of restoring democracy in
the South American nation.</p>
<p>“I would urge the Maduro government, the Maduro regime in Venezuela,
to heed special envoy Ric Grenell’s message,” said Claver-Carone,
himself a former top national security aide to Trump during his first
administration. “Ultimately there will be consequences otherwise.”</p>
<p>The visit comes less than a month after Maduro was sworn in for a
third six-year term despite credible evidence that he lost last year’s
election by a more than 2-to-1 margin. The U.S. government, along with
several other Western nations, does not recognize Maduro’s claim to
victory.</p>
<p>Venezuelan state television aired footage of Grenell and Maduro
speaking in the Miraflores Palace in Caracas, the capital, and said the
meeting had been requested by the U.S. government.</p>
<p>Signing an executive order in the Oval Office on Friday, Trump was
asked if Grenell being filmed meeting with Maduro lent legitimacy to an
administration that the Trump White House hasn’t official
recognized.</p>
<p>“No. We want to do something with Venezuela. I’ve been a very big
opponent of Venezuela and Maduro,” Trump responded. “They’ve treated us
not so good, but they’ve treated, more importantly, the Venezuelan
people, very badly.”</p>
<p>Some Republicans criticized the visit.</p>
<p>“This is terrible timing,” said Elliott Abrams, who served as special
envoy to Venezuela and Iran during the first Trump administration. “A
meeting with Maduro will be used by him to legitimize his rule and show
that the Americans recognize him as president. If the purpose is to
deliver a tough message about migration issues, the president could’ve
done that himself. There was no need to send someone to Caracas.”</p>
<p>Among those detained are as many as 10 Americans. Neither the White
House nor Maduro’s government immediately released the names of the six
who were freed Friday.</p>

<h2 id="why-the-arctic-matters-in-the-21st-century">Why the Arctic
matters in the 21st century</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The Arctic is one of the coldest and least populated regions on
Earth, much of it covered by ice. But in recent years it has become one
of the most important sites of geopolitical tensions — and a key focus
of American policy.</p>
<p>Despite its inhospitability, land north of the Arctic Circle has long
been inhabited by Indigenous people like the Inuit, Sami and Yukaghir
and today includes territories belonging to eight countries: Canada,
Russia, Iceland, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark and the United
States.</p>
<p>In 1996, these countries formed the Arctic Council — a forum that
includes all eight countries as member states along with representatives
from Indigenous groups. But while the Arctic was once envisioned as a
neutral zone where research and conservation could promote deeper
international cooperation, multiple developments since then have turned
it into a site of competition.</p>
<p>The number one issue facing the Arctic is climate change. Since the
1990s, Arctic sea ice has declined by 7.6 trillion metric tons, with the
rate of loss increasing by 57%. Besides contributing to rising sea
levels, the loss of ice also reduces global solar reflection. This
creates a feedback loop as the darker ocean water absorbs more heat,
causing more ice to melt, adversely affecting global weather
patterns.</p>
<p>The melting of Arctic ice also directly affects local wildlife, with
polar bear populations projected to decline by two-thirds in the next
quarter-century as they lose their hunting grounds.</p>
<p>But where some see environmental disaster, others see opportunity.
The melting ice is making Arctic trade routes more navigable, providing
shorter distances for transoceanic shipping than current lanes using the
Suez and Panama canals. Furthermore, increased navigability is expanding
potential for exploration and extraction of natural resources.</p>
<p>The Arctic region is estimated to hold over 20% of the world’s
remaining fossil fuel reserves, with over 400 oil and gas fields already
discovered. Both the seabed and offshore areas also hold vast quantities
of minerals ranging from staple commodities like iron, gold, nickel and
zinc to rare earth metals such as neodymium and dysprosium, which are
used in electronics and battery technology. Even traditional subsistence
activity may be greatly altered and expanded as global warming leads
fish stocks to migrate north and more coastal land becomes available for
agriculture.</p>
<p>Yet economic opportunities in the Arctic are emerging at a time of
increased geopolitical tensions, as countries scramble to secure
resources, stake territorial claims and develop facilities.</p>
<p>With 53% of the Arctic coastline under its control, Russia has the
largest presence in the region in terms of civilian ports like Murmansk
and Arkhangelsk as well as multiple airfields and military bases along
its northern border. More recently, Russia has moved to expand its
claims to the Arctic seabed at the same time that its invasion of
Ukraine in 2022 has led other members of the Arctic Council to suspend
cooperation with Moscow.</p>
<p>While land jurisdiction in the Arctic is largely settled aside from a
few small disputes, maritime claims are much more complex. Control over
Arctic waters is generally governed by the United Nations Convention on
the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which defines multiple types of territorial
waters where a nation may have the right to restrict the activity of
foreign vessels. These range from internal waters that are considered
part of a nation’s sovereign territory to exclusive economic zones where
foreign ships may travel freely but cannot extract resources.</p>
<p>Although the United States played a formative role in negotiating the
treaty and abides by most of its provisions, it remains one of the few
countries that has not formally acceded to it because of concerns about
limitations it places on seabed mining.</p>
<p>Even among UNCLOS signatories, however, boundary definitions can
vary. While Canada considers parts of the Northwest Passage to lie
within its territorial waters, for example, most other nations including
the United States consider it to be an international strait where
foreign ships may transit.</p>
<p>Similarly, Russia has claimed parts of the Northeast Passage along
its northern coastline as internal waters, moving to restrict the right
of passage in areas where it was previously allowed.</p>
<p>Given these disputes, the Transpolar Sea Route through the center of
the Arctic Ocean, which lies fully in international waters, will become
more attractive as polar ice continues to thaw.</p>
<p>The increasing importance of the Arctic has attracted the attention
of other powers without Arctic territory. Several of these states have
been admitted as observers in the Arctic Council, including Germany, the
United Kingdom, Japan and South Korea. China, which is also an observer,
has unilaterally declared itself as a “near-Arctic state” and has
expanded both research and commercial activity in the region by
partnering with Russia as well as investing in infrastructure in Norway,
Iceland and Greenland.</p>
<p>China’s increased presence in the Arctic alongside Russia’s more
aggressive posture have been among the reasons cited for U.S. President
Donald Trump’s insistence on annexing or buying Greenland, a territory
of NATO ally Denmark. While Greenland already contains a U.S. military
base on its northwest coast, the discussion is likely to result in a
further militarization of the territory, even under Denmark.</p>
<p>Satellites are also expected to play a major role in exerting control
within the Arctic, given the importance of observation and monitoring in
remote areas with poor communications infrastructure.</p>
<p>What was once considered a frozen frontier with little to offer is
quickly becoming one of the most contested regions on Earth. And as the
planet heats up, competition in the Arctic will as well.</p>

id="trump-administration-moving-to-fire-fbi-agents-involved-in-investigations-of-trump-ap-sources-say">Trump
administration moving to fire FBI agents involved in investigations of
Trump, AP sources say</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Trump administration officials are moving to fire at
least some of the FBI agents engaged in investigations involving
President Donald Trump, two people familiar with the plans said
Friday.</p>
<p>It was not clear how many agents might be affected, though scores of
investigators were involved in various inquiries touching Trump.
Officials acting at the direction of the administration have been
working to identify individual employees who participated in politically
sensitive investigations for possible termination, said the people who
insisted on anonymity to discuss private conversations.</p>
<p>A third person familiar with the situation said U.S. attorneys were
instructed on a call this week to provide the names of prosecutors and
agents who had any involvement in the hundreds of cases against the
rioters at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. It was not made clear on the
call why the names were needed, said the person, who also spoke on the
condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters.</p>
<p>Any mass firings would be a major blow to the historic independence
from the White House of the nation’s premier federal law enforcement
agency and would reflect Trump’s persistent resolve to bend the law
enforcement and intelligence community to his will. It would be part of
a startling pattern of retribution waged on federal government
employees, following the forced ousters of a group of senior FBI
executives earlier this week as well as a mass firing by the Justice
Department of prosecutors on special counsel Jack Smith’s team who
investigated Trump.</p>
<p>The FBI Agents Association said the planned firings are “outrageous
actions” that “are fundamentally at odds with the law enforcement
objectives outlined by President Trump and his support for FBI
agents.”</p>
<p>“Dismissing potentially hundreds of agents would severely weaken the
bureau’s ability to protect the country from national security and
criminal threats and will ultimately risk setting up the bureau and its
new leadership for failure,” the association said in a statement.</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear what recourse any fired agent might
take, but the bureau has a well-defined process for terminations and any
abrupt action that bypasses the protocol could presumably open the door
to a legal challenge.</p>
<p>When pressed during his confirmation hearing Thursday, Trump’s pick
for FBI director, Kash Patel, said he was not aware of any plans to
terminate or otherwise punish FBI employees who were involved in the
Trump investigations. Patel said if he was confirmed he would follow the
FBI’s internal review processes for taking action against employees.</p>
<p>Asked by Democratic Senator Cory Booker whether he would reverse any
decisions before his confirmation that didn’t follow that standard
process, Patel said, “I don’t know what’s going on right now over there,
but I’m committed to you, Senator, and your colleagues, that I will
honor the due process of the FBI.”</p>
<p>Before he was nominated for the director’s position, Patel had
remarked on at least one podcast appearance about the existence of what
he called anti-Trump “conspirators” in the government and news
media.</p>
<p>Trump has for years expressed fury at the FBI and Justice Department
over investigations that shadowed his presidency, including an inquiry
into ties between Russia and his 2016 campaign, and continued over the
last four years. He fired one FBI director, James Comey, amid the Russia
investigation and then said he would fire his second, Christopher Wray.
Wray later resigned before Trump took office Jan. 20.</p>
<p>Asked at the White House on Friday if he had anything to do with the
scrutiny of the agents, he said: “No, but we have some very bad people
over there. It was weaponized at a level that nobody’s never seen
before. They came after a lot of people — like me — but they came after
a lot of people.”</p>
<p>He added, “If they fired some people over there, that’s a good thing,
because they were very bad.”</p>
<p>The FBI and Smith’s team investigated Trump over his efforts to
overturn the 2020 presidential election and his hoarding of classified
documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Both of those cases
resulted in indictments that were withdrawn after Trump’s November
presidential win because of long-standing Justice Department policy
prohibiting the federal prosecution of a sitting president.</p>
<p>The Justice Department also brought charges against more than 1,500
Trump supporters in connection with the Capitol riot, though Trump on
his first day in office granted clemency to all of them — including the
ones convicted of violent crimes — through pardons, sentence
commutations and dismissals of indictments.</p>
<p>This week, the Justice Department fired more than a dozen prosecutors
who worked on Smith investigations, and a group of senior FBI executives
— including several executive assistant directors and leaders of
big-city field offices — were told to either resign or retire or be
fired Monday.</p>
<p>Spokespeople for the FBI and the Justice Department declined to
comment.</p>
<p>The firings would be done over the will of acting FBI Director Brian
Driscoll, who has indicated that he objects to the idea, the people
said.</p>

Friday that President Donald Trump would be implementing 25% tariffs on

Thursday. </p>
<p>Bui said that while it might still be too early to tell what the
impact could be, she has been considering purchasing costly items, such
as expensive cosmetics that she buys sometimes, from China. She also
said she needed a new phone. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Bui said she would “buy products now before they go up in price to a
point where they’d become unaffordable.”  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sean Liu, who lives in Virginia, told VOA that he was glad he’d
recently decided to buy a new phone and car.</p>
<p>“With things that are already really expensive, if you add another
10% to their price – it’s not like, say, buying a thermos and adding
another 10% – this kind of price hike is truly big,” he said.  </p>
<p>He did add, though, that it might be a little easier to deal with if
the tariffs came alongside lower prices for more basic necessities like
groceries and gas.</p>
<p>‘One very big power’</p>
<p>On the campaign trail, Trump threatened tariffs as high as 60% on
China. Since taking office, those threats have expanded and include
everything from a universal tariff to threats against trade partners and
rivals such as China and Russia.</p>
<p>Last week, Trump threatened Colombia with tariffs of 25% to 50% to
get Bogota to accept deportation flights.</p>
<p>On China, Trump recently told Fox News’ Sean Hannity that tariffs
were the “one very big power” the U.S. has over China.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“They don’t want them, and I’d rather not have to use it,” Trump
said.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The 10% tariff on all Chinese imports is part of what Trump says is a
punitive response to China’s role in manufacturing precursor chemicals
essential to fentanyl production in Mexico.</p>
<p>Currently, the United States targets China with a 100% tariff on
electric vehicles, a 50% tariff on solar cells and semiconductors, a 25%
tariff on critical minerals needed to make certain advanced batteries
and a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum.</p>
<p>New tariffs would build on more than $300 billion worth of taxes on
Chinese imports that Trump imposed during his first term. Those tariffs
were upheld and, in some cases, advanced under former President Joe
Biden. </p>
<p>Who will feel impact? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Some analysts question who will be hurt if these tariffs are
implemented. Some say the deep economic ties between China and the
United States could mean that American consumers will be the ones
bearing the brunt of Trump’s punishment on Beijing. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Supporters, however, see the move as a fulfillment of Trump’s promise
to put American lives and livelihoods first — particularly when it comes
to stopping the flow of fentanyl into the country.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>According to William Reinsch, senior adviser of the economics program
and Scholl Chair in International Business at the Center for Strategic
and International Studies, the tariff likely would raise prices of goods
in America. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“The prices on a lot of things that people buy at retail — apparel,
footwear, household goods – things like that will be affected. Ten
percent is not huge, but it’s not zero either,” Reinsch said. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Costs and benefits </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Trump has pushed back against the argument that tariffs drive
inflation higher and said instead that tariffs would make America
rich. </p>
<p>Liu Longzhu, a California lawyer and delegate at the 2024 Republican
National Convention, sees tariffs as the key to recovering America’s
economic strength. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“The main purpose of increasing tariffs is to assure that America is
truly ‘America First’ and protect American jobs. If you are looking for
a job, they are beneficial to you. If the tariffs are increased, Chinese
products will lose their competitiveness, and American products will
become more competitive. This will make it easier for Americans to find
jobs,” Liu said. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>James Galbraith, an economist at the University of Texas at Austin,
doesn’t see tariffs as inherently inflationary, and he agrees that
tariffs would bring back jobs that were lost to overseas companies. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“A tariff strategy can be implemented in such a way that the cost
largely falls outside of the country,” Galbraith told VOA. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>But Stephen Lamar, president and CEO at the American Apparel &amp;
Footwear Association, said that tariffs, especially those levied on
China, will ultimately raise the cost of both domestic and foreign goods
given the interconnectivity of global economies. </p>
<p>“The theory on paper is that you’re giving domestic producers an
advantage. The reality in practice is that more people are paying higher
prices for products, regardless of their source,” Lamar told VOA.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Reinsch also cast doubt on the ability of tariffs to bring
manufacturing jobs back to America, particularly in labor-intensive
sectors like apparel or footwear. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I would be surprised if you see a renaissance in the American
apparel industry as a result of a 10% tariff. It would take a lot more
than that,” Reinsch said, adding that tariffs don’t guarantee a move
away from imports and toward domestic manufacturing. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Importers looking for cheap products can still source from countries
in Southeast Asia or Africa that provide competitive, low-cost
alternatives to Chinese products.</p>

id="us-deportations-to-china-continue-amid-shifts-in-immigration-crackdown">US
deportations to China continue amid shifts in immigration crackdown</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The Trump administration has confirmed that the deportation of
Chinese nationals is still underway as part of a broader effort to
enforce U.S. immigration laws.</p>
<p>In an emailed response to VOA this week, a U.S. Immigration and
Customs Enforcement official wrote that the agency is removing from the
United States any immigrant who is here unlawfully.</p>
<p>“ICE continues to conduct removals to the People’s Republic of China.
Due to operational security, ICE does not confirm future removal
operations until deportees have been returned to their country of
origin,” the ICE official said Tuesday, speaking on background, a method
often used by U.S. officials to remain anonymous.</p>
<p>VOA requested the most recent removal numbers for China and an update
on deportation flights, but as of Friday, ICE had yet to respond.</p>
<p>Deportations have increased as China signals a greater willingness to
repatriate its citizens, a departure from its historically restrictive
stance. Large repatriation flights resumed last June, the first since
2018.</p>
<p>On Jan. 6, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, through ICE,
conducted the Biden administration’s fifth removal flight to China in
less than seven months.</p>
<p>“These [Biden administration] flights were the product of sustained
cooperation between the Department and PRC counterparts to repatriate
individuals who have not established a legal basis to remain in the
United States,” DHS said in a statement on Jan. 10.</p>
<p>Fast-track deportations</p>
<p>Under the Trump administration, the approach is shifting toward
making deportations faster and bypassing judicial review.</p>
<p>The Trump administration issued an executive order on Jan. 21 to
expand expedited removal, also known as fast-track deportations, to
include immigrants who cannot prove they have been continuously living
in the United States for more than two years.</p>
<p>“The effect of this change will be to enhance national security and
public safety — while reducing government costs — by facilitating prompt
immigration determinations,” the notice read.</p>
<p>Expedited removal allows the U.S. government to quickly deport people
who are undocumented. Under the process of expedited removal, some
noncitizens can be deported in a single day without an immigration court
hearing or other appearance before a judge.</p>
<p>ICE data from November showed 37,908 Chinese nationals who were
believed to be removable from the United States but had not yet been
detained. December and January numbers are not yet available.</p>
<p>On Jan. 22, the American Civil Liberties Union sued the Trump
administration over the expansion of expedited removal.</p>
<p>The ACLU argued in court documents that the new rule violates federal
law and the Fifth Amendment’s due process clause by effectively
eliminating full court hearings that immigrants are entitled to
receive.</p>
<p>The organization also cited studies indicating that expedited
removals are prone to errors, often leading to the mistaken deportation
of immigrants.</p>
<p>Joanna Derman, a program director at Asian Americans Advancing
Justice, told VOA that advocates are worried the Trump administration
will use “extreme options” to specifically target Chinese nationals for
deportation, “especially in the event of a significant escalation
between the United States and China.”</p>
<p>“But on the other hand,” she said, “we’re also rapidly mobilizing
right now. … We are uplifting resources for people who are the most
likely to be impacted. The most vulnerable folks need to know what to do
if [or] when ICE shows up at their school, their work or their place of
worship.”</p>
<p>US-China repatriation cooperation</p>
<p>For years, China has been among the countries that refused or delayed
accepting deportees, complicating U.S. efforts to remove individuals
with final orders.</p>
<p>Countries that do not negotiate or refuse to accept their nationals
back are deemed “recalcitrant” or “uncooperative.” Recalcitrant
countries do not accept their nationals back. Uncooperative countries
will accept some of their nationals back.</p>
<p>According to an ICE official and a DHS removal operations document,
15 countries were deemed to be uncooperative: Bhutan, Burma, Cuba,
Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Hong Kong, India,
Iran, Laos, Pakistan, the People’s Republic of China, Russia, Somalia
and Venezuela.</p>
<p>ICE considers these to be at risk of recalcitrant:
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Gabon, Gambia, Iraq,
Jamaica, Nicaragua, South Sudan, St. Lucia and Vietnam.</p>
<p>During a Monday press conference, Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesperson Mao Ning was asked if Beijing intended to accept all
Chinese nationals in the U.S. illegally.</p>
<p>“I’d refer you to competent authorities for anything specific,” she
said. “Let me say more broadly that the Chinese government firmly
opposes any form of illegal migration. We have conducted practical
cooperation with the migration and law enforcement departments of the
U.S. and other countries, which has been productive. As far as
repatriation is concerned, China’s principle is to receive the
repatriates who are confirmed as Chinese nationals from the Chinese
mainland after verification.”</p>
<p>ICE’s deportation numbers reflect U.S. diplomatic efforts with China,
with DHS reporting the removal of 109 Chinese nationals on the latest
charter flight as of November, following 131 deportations in October and
116 in June.</p>
<p>According to DHS, the Biden administration’s increase in deportations
matches China’s work to decrease illegal immigration, which has led to a
62% decline in Chinese migrant apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border.
Apprehensions of Chinese dropped from 2,198 encounters in June 2024 to
873 in December 2024.</p>
<p>January numbers are not yet available.</p>
<p>Deportation logistics, cost</p>
<p>An ICE official confirmed to VOA by email in late December that the
U.S. government buys the commercial airline tickets for deportees,
working closely with a travel service provider to book the most
cost-effective flights.</p>
<p>ICE determines whether to use charter or commercial flights based on
operational needs. ICE did not share cost per person for either type of
flight.</p>
<p>But the American Immigration Council estimates that removing 1
million people a year would cost U.S. taxpayers about $88 billion, with
the total over a decade approaching $1 trillion.</p>
<p>Despite Beijing’s increased cooperation, China remains one of several
nations that usually refuse to take back their citizens or delay
repatriations.</p>
<p>During the 2024 fiscal year, ICE removed 517 Chinese nationals from
the United States.</p>
<p>Deportation process</p>
<p>In immigration court, deportation orders are usually issued after a
foreign national violates the terms of a visa, is found to be
undocumented or is convicted of a crime.</p>
<p>When the United States seeks to deport an immigrant, it generally
follows a framework negotiated with the other nation; these frameworks
are often detailed in writing, through a memorandum of
understanding.</p>
<p>Before the United States can deport someone, the other country must
agree to receive the deportee. There must also be an administratively
final order of removal, or deportation order, and the individual must
have a travel document issued by a foreign government.</p>

id="rfk-jr.-vows-to-stop-collecting-from-vaccine-lawsuit-if-confirmed-to-cabinet">RFK
Jr. vows to stop collecting from vaccine lawsuit if confirmed to
Cabinet</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Facing intense scrutiny from U.S. senators over his
potential profit from vaccine lawsuits while serving as the nation’s
health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said that if he is confirmed he
will not collect fees from litigation against the drugmakers of a
cervical cancer vaccine.</p>
<p>Kennedy, who’s President Donald Trump’s pick to lead the U.S. Health
and Human Services agency, told the Senate finance committee that he
would amend his ethics disclosure after several senators, including
Democrat Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and his cousin Caroline
Kennedy raised concerns about his financial arrangement with the law
firm representing patients who are claiming injuries from the
vaccines.</p>
<p>“An amendment to my Ethics Agreement is in process, and it provides
that I will divest my interest in this litigation,” Kennedy said in a
written response to the committee.</p>
<p>Initially, Kennedy had told the committee that he would continue to
accept referral fees in legal cases that don’t involve the U.S.
government. That included an arrangement with a law firm that’s sued
Merck over Gardasil, its human papillomavirus vaccine that prevents
cervical cancer. The deal earned Kennedy $850,000 last year, and he told
senators he had referred hundreds of clients to the firm.</p>
<p>During Wednesday’s hearing, Warren outlined several ways in which
Kennedy could make it easier to sue vaccine manufacturers.</p>
<p>“Kennedy can kill off access to vaccines and make millions of dollars
while he does it,” Warren said. “Kids might die, but Robert Kennedy can
keep cashing in.”</p>
<p>The issue also may have been a concern for Senator Bill Cassidy, a
Louisiana Republican who is also a physician and is conflicted over his
vote on Kennedy’s confirmation because of Kennedy’s anti-vaccine
views.</p>
<p>The Republican president’s nominee is “financially vested in finding
fault with vaccines,” Cassidy, the chair of the health committee, noted
as he ended Thursday’s confirmation hearing.</p>
<p>Kennedy also stopped short of making other commitments, refusing to
promise that he would not engage in lobbying Health and Human Services
after his term ends.</p>
<p>Kennedy and his supporters have railed against that sort of activity,
saying the “revolving door” of Washington — where federal officials
trade public service jobs to influence government agencies while in the
private sector — has undermined the U.S. public health system. He has
criticized the practice at least a half-dozen times in social media
posts over recent years.</p>
<p>Kennedy, who ran for president last year before dropping his bid and
endorsing Trump, vowed in one post on social media platform X to “rein
in lobbyists and slam shut the revolving door,” if elected
president.</p>
<p>He first challenged President Joe Biden for the 2024 Democratic
presidential nomination but then ran as an independent before striking a
deal to endorse Trump in exchange for a promise to serve in a health
policy role during a second Trump administration.</p>
<p>Now, after two days of hearings, his shot at that job is on the line
with concerns about his anti-vaccine advocacy prompting nearly all
Democrats to reject his nomination and a handful of Republicans who are
at least considering doing the same.</p>
<p>If Democrats unanimously oppose Kennedy, he’ll need support from all
but three Republicans. The Senate finance committee is expected to
decide if he makes it to the Senate floor for a vote next week.</p>
<p>Kennedy’s response to the Senate committee was first reported by The
New York Times.</p>

Georgia is arguably the heart of the Inflation Reduction Act economy.
The state has been a magnet for manufacturing companies seeking to
supply batteries, electric cars, and solar cells in order to capture the
law’s generous tax credits for domestically built green technology.
</p>
<p>
While some of the power that supplies these facilities (not to mention
data centers also flocking to the state) is clean — the only new U.S.
nuclear reactors built this decade are in Georgia, and 38% of
electricity generation for the state’s largest utility, Georgia Power,
came from non-carbon-emitting sources in 2024 — the state is now
planning to bolster its natural gas and coal fleets to support its
enormous projected load growth.

Georgia Power released its 2025 Integrated Resource Plan on Friday,
laying out to state regulators its forecasts for electricity demand and
how it intends to bolster and adjust its fleet to meet the new usage.
These exercises almost always feature

2030, which is already about 2,000 megawatts more than what it expected
during its last planning exercise, when it updated its 2022 plan in
2023. To get a sense of the scale of this growth, the new Vogtle nuclear
reactors have a little over 1,000 megawatts of capacity each. Together,
they took

years and over $30 billion</u></a> to build.
</p>
<p>
Georgia Power also expects 7% annual growth through the end of 2030,
more than double the
<a href="https://gridstrategiesllc.com/wp-content/uploads/National-Load-Growth-Report-2024.pdf" target="_blank"><u>3%annual
growth through the end of the decade</u></a> that utility planners
expect nationwide.
</p>
<p>
That new power won’t just be powering data centers. It will also run
much of the green economy that the Biden administration tried to build
up.
</p>
<p>
“New and expanding economic development projects in Georgia have
progressed more rapidly and on a larger scale than in previous years,”
Georgia Power said in its filing. “Growth in emerging industries such as
electric transportation (‘ET’), data centers, and solar manufacturing
have accelerated since 2021.”
</p>
<p>
The report also said that by the middle of last year, “the manufacturing
sector led in both investment and job creation in Georgia, representing
53% of job growth and 54% of capital investment in the state.”

<p>
One reason manufacturers come to Georgia is for the power, Tim Echols,
the vice-chairman of the Georgia Public Service Commission,
<a href="https://www.ajc.com/opinion/opinion-artificial-intelligence-and-the-demand-for-energy/6QKRVUZDKRC2DAU5WBMQYF7D3E/" target="_blank"><u>argued</u></a>
in an <em><em>Atlanta Journal Constitution</em></em> op-ed Thursday:
“Southern Co. and Georgia Power have a reputation for reliability,” he
wrote.
</p>
<p>
And for the foreseeable future that Georgia Power plans for, that means
some of its most polluting and carbon-emitting power plants will stay
open.
</p>
<p>
The utility said it would continue operating its four-generator Plant
Bowen coal facility,
<a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/georgia-power-irp-resource-retire-coal-ash/627897/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>two
units of which were previously scheduled to retire</u></a> by 2028, as
well as maintaining over 1,000 megawatts of coal-fired capacity at two
other plants that had

been scheduled to shut down at the end of 2028</u></a>. Georgia Power is
asking state regulators to approve operation of the coal plants through
at least 2034.
</p>
<p>
In the update to its previous IRP, Georgia Power
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/coal-gas-plant-retirements" target="_self"><u>extended
the life of a coal plant</u></a> operated by its sister utility
Mississippi Power and proposed adding 1.4 gigawatts of generators that
could run on natural gas or oil.
</p>
<p>
Compared to 2022, “the Company now projects capacity needs that
necessitate both the extension of existing coal and gas-steam units
along with the procurement of new capacity resources,” Georgia Power
said in its IRP Friday.
</p>
<p>
Georgia Power’s parent company, Southern Company, still has a goal of
achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, but said in the filling that “the
feasibility of continued progress toward a low-carbon future, including
a net-zero future, is highly dependent on the continued use of natural
gas and continued technological advancements that will facilitate a
reliable and economic low-carbon electricity supply.”
</p>
<p>
The utility also wants to upgrade existing gas-fueled and hydroelectric
plants, as well as acquire an additional 1,100 megawatts of new
renewables, adding up to 4,000 megawatts of procurements. Georgia
Power’s previous update to its 2022 IRP called for the construction of
new oil and gas plants, which were

by regulators last year</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
“Georgia Power’s 2025 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) includes adding up
to 4,000 megawatts of new renewable energy resources by 2035, including
1,000 MW by 2032, and more than 1,000 miles of new transmission lines.
Clean energy resources and transmission solutions are vital to reducing
customer costs and maintaining the high level of reliability Georgians
have grown accustomed to,” Simon Mahan, executive director of the
Southern Renewable Energy Association,
<a href="https://x.com/SimonMahan/status/1885345956029194248" target="_blank"><u>said
in a statement</u></a>.

<h2 id="trump-to-enact-tariffs-on-canada-mexico-china">Trump to enact
tariffs on Canada, Mexico, China</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WHITE HOUSE — U.S. President Donald Trump will enact 25% tariffs on
imports from Canada and Mexico and 10% tariffs on goods from China
beginning Saturday, the White House said.</p>
<p>“Both Canada and Mexico have allowed an unprecedented invasion of
illegal fentanyl that is killing American citizens, and also illegal
immigrants into our country,” White House press secretary Karoline
Leavitt said during her briefing Friday.</p>
<p>Leavitt did not say whether there would be any exemptions to the
measures.</p>
<p>“These are promises made and promises kept by the president,” she
said.</p>
<p>Asked by reporters Friday, Trump said there was nothing the three
countries could do to reverse his decision and that the tariffs were
“not a negotiating tool.”</p>
<p>“It’s a pure economic — we have big deficits with, as you know, with
all three of them,” Trump said. “We’re not looking for a concession, and
we’ll just see what happens.”</p>
<p>Trump said that he would tariff Canadian crude oil imports at 10%
beginning Saturday. Other Canadian goods would be hit with a 25%
tariff.</p>
<p>The president vowed to impose sweeping tariffs on semiconductors,
pharmaceuticals, steel and aluminum, and oil and gas.</p>
<p>“All forms of medicine and pharmaceuticals,” Trump said. “And we’ll
be doing, very importantly, steel, and we’ll also be doing chips and
things associated with chips.”</p>
<p>Tariffs on oil and gas will be imposed “around the 18th of February,”
Trump said. He signaled that other tariffs would be imposed in the
coming weeks, without providing exact dates.</p>
<p>Trump warned he would “absolutely” place tariffs on goods from the
European Union.</p>
<p>“They’re treating us so badly,” he said.</p>
<p>Outgoing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his country
would respond.</p>
<p>“We’re working hard to prevent these tariffs, but if the United
States moves ahead, Canada’s ready with a forceful and immediate
response,” he posted on social media.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mexico had a more muted response. Its economic ministry
posted a message on social media saying that Mexico and the United
States were “partners, not competitors.”</p>
<p>Tariffs could backfire</p>
<p>China, Mexico and Canada account for more than one-third of the goods
and services imported to or bought from the United States.</p>
<p>Some economists warn that the tariffs could backfire.</p>
<p>Imports from Mexico and Canada make up around 3% of U.S. GDP, while
exports make up around 2.5% percent of U.S. GDP, said Brad Setser, a
senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations</p>
<p>A 25% tariff on Mexico and Canada amounts to a “tax hike on imports
from those countries” and will “have an immediate and negative impact on
the U.S. economy,” he told VOA. “It’s a strategy for shrinking the U.S.
economy.”</p>
<p>Trump has long threatened to impose tariffs to pressure countries to
help his administration stop illegal immigration and the smuggling of
chemicals used for fentanyl. He has pledged to use tariffs to boost
domestic manufacturing and has praised its use as an effective economic
policy.</p>
<p>Trump believes that “tariffs are a great source of leverage,” and
that he will “convince Canada and Mexico to make big concessions under
the threat of tariffs,” Setser said. “But these measures are going to be
pretty costly to the U.S.”</p>
<p>Trump acknowledged that the tariffs might cause a “short-term
disruption” for consumers but said it would lead to a long-term benefit
for U.S. manufacturing.</p>
<p>“Tariffs don’t cause inflation. Tariffs cause success,” he added.</p>
<p>During his first administration in 2018, Trump negotiated and signed
the United States-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement, in part to narrow
the United States’ big trade deficit — the gap between what it sells and
what it buys — with its neighbors. He once called the deal “the fairest,
most balanced and beneficial trade agreement we have ever signed into
law.”</p>
<p>However, the U.S. deficit in the trade of goods with Mexico has
widened from $106 billion in 2019 to $161 billion in 2023, according to
government data. The trade gap in goods with Canada has also increased,
from $31 billion in 2019 to $72 billion in 2023.</p>
<p>“He’s now acting like his deal caused a disaster needing an emergency
fix,” said Derek Scissors, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise
Institute.</p>
<p>There’s no justification for high tariffs on Canada, a market economy
that’s not in the top five of U.S. trade deficits, Scissors said.</p>
<p>“Fentanyl shipments across the Canadian border are tiny,” he
added.</p>
<p>Fentanyl and illegal migration are justifications for border
restrictions on Mexico, Scissors said. However, tariffs “don’t stop
illegal immigration and probably encourage it by threatening jobs in
Mexico.”</p>
<p>The stock market erased early gains and closed lower Friday after the
White House announcement on tariffs.</p>

<h2
id="more-than-40-bodies-recovered-from-washington-midair-collision">More
than 40 bodies recovered from Washington midair collision</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Fire and emergency service officials in Washington said Friday that
more than 40 bodies have been recovered from the wreckage of a
commercial passenger jet and military helicopter that collided and
crashed into the Potomac River late Wednesday.</p>
<p>Operations to recover the bodies of 67 people killed in the collision
resumed at dawn Friday. The National Transportation Safety Board — or
NTSB, the federal agency leading the investigation into the accident —
reportedly is at the scene along with local and regional EMS crews.</p>
<p>The commercial jet, a Bombardier CRJ700 regional craft operated by
American Airlines subsidiary PSA Airlines, carried 64 passengers and
crew, while the U.S. Army UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter carried a crew of
three. Officials said there were no survivors.</p>
<p>The NTSB reported late Thursday the cockpit voice recorder and
flight-data recorder from the airliner, devices often referred to as
black boxes, have been recovered and are at the agency’s labs for
evaluation.</p>
<p>In an interview Friday with U.S.-based Fox News network, U.S. Defense
Secretary Pete Hegseth said that the “black box” for the helicopter had
not yet been recovered, but that its data will likely determine who was
piloting the helicopter at the time of the crash.</p>
<p>Hegseth on Thursday said the crew, which was conducting a
night-flight training evaluation, included a staff sergeant, a
captain-in-training and a chief warrant officer, who was an instructor.
The crew had been issued night vision goggles for the flight, but
Hegseth said it was unclear if they were using them.</p>
<p>The defense secretary also said Thursday that the helicopter’s
altitude at the time of the accident was under investigation. The two
aircraft collided as the passenger jet was attempting to land at Reagan
National Airport.</p>
<p>Hegseth said the flight voice and flight data recorders also could
determine who was in communication with the airport’s air traffic
control tower and if there was any confusion regarding the instructions
they received.</p>
<p>Citing a government report, The Washington Post said Thursday that
the control tower was understaffed Wednesday night. The report said two
people were handling the jobs of four inside the tower at the time of
the collision.</p>
<p>A similar report from U.S. broadcaster NBC News, citing a source
familiar with the investigation, said a supervisor in the tower let an
air traffic controller leave their shift early before the collision.</p>
<p>That decision, the report said, left one controller to handle
airplane traffic and helicopter traffic in the area, whereas typically
there is one controller looking at each type of aircraft.</p>
<p>The NBC report said it is allowable under Federal Aviation
Administration standards for one person to do both jobs, although it is
not considered optimal. The agency on Friday significantly restricted
helicopter traffic in the immediate vicinity of Washington Reagan
National Airport until further notice.</p>
<p>At a news conference Thursday, both U.S. Senators Tim Kaine and Mark
Warner from Virginian said they had expressed concerns over the years
regarding the high volume of air traffic in the Washington area, but
they would await results from the accident probe before revisiting that
specific concern.</p>
<p>During a White House news conference Thursday, President Donald Trump
suggested previous presidential administrations, led by Democratic
Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, lowered standards for the hiring
of air traffic controllers and blamed diversity, equity and inclusion,
or DEI, initiatives in the federal government for that.</p>
<p>He said he reversed those initiatives with executive orders last
week.</p>
<p>The U.S. Figure Skating organization said several members of its
community, including athletes, coaches and family members, were among
the passengers on the plane.</p>
<p>“We are devastated by this unspeakable tragedy and hold the victims’
families closely in our hearts,” the organization said.</p>
<p>The Kremlin and Russian media said Russian figure skaters, including
world champion couple Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov, also were on
the plane. Trump said his administration would facilitate the return of
their remains to Russia.</p>
<p>Wednesday’s crash was the deadliest aviation incident on U.S. soil
since 2001, when an American Airlines flight crashed in Belle Harbor,
New York, killing 260 people.</p>

Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.</p>

aid freeze spells uncertain future for international media</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — On the front lines of the war in Ukraine, local
newspapers are vital lifelines in areas where Russia has destroyed cell
towers and internet infrastructure.</p>
<p>Journalists provide information about evacuation routes, document
alleged Russian war crimes and troop movements, and counter Moscow’s
propaganda.</p>
<p>Even a temporary freeze of U.S. foreign aid can mean financial
difficulties for small media organizations that rely on outside donors
to keep working.</p>
<p>“Many Ukrainian media may now face the threat of closure or
significant reduction in operations in the coming weeks,” Sergiy
Tomilenko, president of the National Union of Journalists of Ukraine,
told VOA.</p>
<p>Ukraine is not alone.</p>
<p>News outlets on the front lines of war and authoritarianism from
Ukraine and Belarus to Myanmar are among the organizations affected by a
freeze on U.S. foreign aid.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 20 mandating
all federal government agencies pause all foreign development assistance
for 90 days.</p>
<p>The directive took effect on Jan. 24 and includes foreign funding
from the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International
Development, or USAID.</p>
<p>“Every dollar we spend, every program we fund, and every policy we
pursue must be justified with the answer to three simple questions,”
Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a Jan. 26 statement. “Does it
make America safer? Does it make America stronger? Does it make America
more prosperous?”</p>
<p>Worldwide impact</p>
<p>Many independent news outlets around the world rely on State
Department and USAID funding because they report in repressive
environments, according to the JX Fund, a Berlin-based group that
supports exiled media.</p>
<p>With the current freeze, news outlets around the world are scrambling
to find alternative sources of funding in an attempt to continue
delivering the news to their audiences and avoid shutting down, multiple
analysts told VOA.</p>
<p>“The general feeling is panic. Panic is the only way to describe the
situation,” Karol Luczka, who works on Eastern Europe at the
International Press Institute in Vienna, told VOA.</p>
<p>JX Fund managing director Penelope Winterhager agreed. These outlets
“are thrown back to emergency mode,” she said.</p>
<p>The measure is estimated to be affecting dozens of independent news
outlets in more than 30 countries, according to the Brussels-based
European Federation of Journalists, or EFJ.</p>
<p>Maja Sever, EFJ president, called on potential donors to fill the
gap.</p>
<p>“The European Union and other donors cannot abandon to their fate
journalists who are the best bulwark for defending the rule of law and
democracy in countries where they are under threat,” Sever said in a
statement Tuesday.</p>
<p>During the 90-day pause, relevant U.S. departments and agencies are
required to review their foreign funding and determine whether the aid
will continue, be modified or cease altogether, according to the
executive order.</p>
<p>The State Department did not respond to specific questions and
referred VOA to a Wednesday press release.</p>
<p>“Americans are a hardworking and generous people, who have sacrificed
their blood and treasure to help their fellow man across the globe. But
no foreign nation is entitled to those benefits, and no foreign aid
program is above scrutiny,” the statement said.</p>
<p>USAID did not reply to VOA’s request for comment.</p>
<p>In Ukraine</p>
<p>Tomilenko said the aid freeze is creating a dire situation for
Ukrainian news outlets on the front line of the war.</p>
<p>“In many areas close to the battle lines, local newspapers are often
the only reliable source of information,” said Tomilenko, who is based
in Kyiv.</p>
<p>Since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Moscow has ramped
up global propaganda efforts while further restricting independent media
inside Russia.</p>
<p>The war has also limited the advertising market in Ukraine, which
would ideally be a primary source of financial independence for
Ukrainian news outlets, said Tomilenko.</p>
<p>The USAID website says it supports programs that “promote free and
independent media” in more than 30 countries. VOA could not determine
how much U.S. aid goes to support media outlets in these countries.</p>
<p>In the case of Ukraine, Luczka said, “The previous administration in
the U.S. saw the importance of supporting civil society in Ukraine in
order to make sure that this country keeps standing.”</p>
<p>The United States has been the strongest player when it came to
supporting independent media outlets, according to the JX Fund’s
Winterhager.</p>
<p>But even though these outlets receive foreign funding, Winterhager
emphasized that “their reporting is independent.”</p>
<p>In Myanmar</p>
<p>Several Myanmar news outlets that rely on financial support from
USAID and Internews also find themselves in a precarious situation.
Internews is a USAID-affiliated nonprofit that supports independent
media.</p>
<p>After launching a coup in 2021, Myanmar’s military arrested
journalists and banned news outlets. The crackdown forced entire outlets
to flee into exile.</p>
<p>Some outlets now report from the Thai-Myanmar border, while others
manage to operate from rebel-controlled regions of Myanmar.</p>
<p>Funding has been among the biggest problems for Myanmar media since
the coup.</p>
<p>“It is difficult — or even impossible — for many of them to make
commercial revenue in this environment,” Ben Dunant, editor-in-chief of
the magazine Frontier Myanmar, told VOA last year. “This underlines the
vulnerability of these media organizations whose operations are
dependent on the whims of donors in faraway countries.”</p>
<p>Mizzima, one of the most prominent of the country’s news outlets and
an affiliate of VOA, is among those affected by the aid freeze,
according to local media reports.</p>
<p>Founded in exile in 1998, the media outlet covers news on the
resistance against the junta and China’s growing influence in the
region.</p>
<p>Another outlet, Western News, has already cut staff, according to its
chief editor, Wunna Khwar Nyo.</p>
<p>“We are struggling to survive,” Wunna Khwar Nyo told VOA.
“Ultimately, this will also hurt the Burmese people.”</p>
<p>If the funding freeze forces news outlets to shutter, the IPI’s
Luczka warned that state-backed propaganda from countries such as Russia
could fill the gap.</p>
<p>“When media outlets disappear, they create a void,” Luczka said. “And
that void needs to be filled by something.”</p>
<p>VOA’s Burmese Service contributed to this report.</p>

envoy Grenell expected to meet Venezuela’s Maduro</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump’s envoy Richard Grenell is
expected to meet with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Friday in
Venezuela, according to U.S. Special Envoy for Latin America Mauricio
Claver-Carone.</p>
<p>Trump said last week his administration likely would stop buying oil
from Venezuela and was looking “very strongly” at the South American
country.</p>
<p>Grenell, Trump’s envoy for special missions, had earlier said he
spoke with multiple officials in Venezuela and would begin meetings,
days after the outgoing Biden administration imposed new sanctions on
the government of Maduro.</p>
<p>“Diplomacy is back,” Grenell said in a post on social media platform
X disclosing his initial calls. “Talking is a tactic.”</p>
<p>During his campaign, Trump called Maduro a dictator after he pursued
a “maximum pressure” campaign against him during his first term, from
2017 to 2021, including imposing harsh sanctions on the South American
country and its oil industry.</p>
<p>Former President Joe Biden briefly rolled back some of the Trump-era
restrictions following electoral promises from Maduro but then
reinstated them, saying the Venezuelan leader had reneged on pledges for
a fair democratic vote.</p>
<p>The Financial Times reported Friday that Chevron is trying to protect
the special U.S. license allowing it to operate in Venezuela.</p>
<p>The oil giant’s chief executive, Mike Wirth, told the newspaper the
company would engage with the White House after U.S. Secretary of State
Marco Rubio said the license should be reconsidered.</p>
<p>If Chevron is forced out, China and Russia will gain influence in the
OPEC nation, Wirth said.</p>
<p>Venezuela’s oil exports to the U.S. soared 64% to some 222,000
barrels per day last year, making the United States its second-largest
export market behind China, which took 351,000 bpd, down 18% compared
with the previous year.</p>

Northeast Braces for a Possible Power Shock From Trump’s Tariffs</h2>

<p class="drop-caps">
Donald Trump reemphasized on Friday that he intends to impose 25%
tariffs on Canada and Mexico beginning February 1, and while that date
is rapidly approaching, the details remain sparse. Although the
president has suggested the duties will be sweeping, covering everything
from cars to lumber
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-canada-oil-tariffs" target="_self"><u>to
oil</u></a>, their impact on one key commodity — electricity — is very
much in question.
</p>
<p>
The U.S.
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=63684" target="_blank"><u>imports
thousands of gigawatt hours of electricity from Canada</u></a> every
year, worth in the billions of dollars. While electricity from Canada
makes up less than 1% of our nationwide power consumption, it’s a
significant and growing source of low-cost, low-carbon power for some
regions, especially the Northeast. Ontario Premier Doug Ford has
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/13/business/canadian-us-energy/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>threatened
to cut off power</u></a> exports into the U.S. entirely in retaliation
for the tariffs. But even if he doesn’t, if the tariffs apply to
electricity imports, then power flows across the border would still
likely decline. That’s because domestic natural gas-fired power would
suddenly become much more economical.
</p>
<p>
“Electricity from Canada competes against natural gas power plants,”
Pierre-Olivier Pineau, a professor at the University of Montreal’s
business school who studies electricity markets, told me. “The gas power
plants would be so happy to have these tariffs.”
</p>
<p>
But whether the tariffs would or could apply to the trade of electricity
is still a big open question. While it would be technically and
administratively feasible to tax imports of electricity, Pineau told me,
there’s no system set up to do that right now. “Electricity doesn’t go
through customs,” he said.

The U.S. International Trade Commission, the federal agency that advises
on international trade and tariffs, told me it was not “able to
speculate on tariffs being applied to electricity or how that would be
done.” The public affairs officer
<a href="https://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/pub5154.pdf" target="_blank"><u>sent
me a report</u></a> from the Commission, however, which confirmed that
it would be unprecedented. It states that “imports of electrical energy
are not considered to be subject to the tariff laws of the United
States.”
</p>
<p>
Regardless, officials in Maine and Massachusetts began warning about the
impacts of potential tariffs on electricity last week. Governor of
Massachusetts Maura Healey told business leaders that
<a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2025/01/24/trump-tariffs-canada-massachusetts-electric-bills-hydropower-newsletter" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>tariffs
could increase electricity costs</u></a> by $100 million to $200 million
statewide, as approximately 5% to 10% of the electricity New England
consumes comes from Canada. (I reached out to the Independent System
Operator for New England, but the grid operator had no more clarity on
whether or how tariffs on power imports would work. “We do not have
expertise in international trade, and we’d be looking for guidance if or
when a tariff is implemented. Beyond that, we’re not able to speculate
at this time.”)
</p>
<p>
The U.S. generally imports electricity from Canada in two different
ways. Some of it is part of a “firm contract.” For example, the New York
grid operator has
<a href="https://www.hydroquebec.com/clean-energy-provider/markets/new-york.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
contract with Hydro-Quebec</u></a>, a Canadian hydropower company,
through 2030, to import up to 900 megawatts of capacity at a fixed rate.
Hydro-Quebec also has an
<a href="https://www.hydroquebec.com/clean-energy-provider/markets/new-england.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>agreement
with Vermont</u></a> to supply about 25% of its annual electricity needs
through 2038. John-Thomas Bernard, an energy economist at the University
of Ottawa, told me that for those contracts, if the 25% tax applied, it
would be passed directly onto customers.
</p>
<p>
But most of the electricity the U.S. consumes from Canada is purchased
in a daily or hourly market, where U.S. grid operators just buy whatever
is cheapest. Tariffs would essentially force Canadian producers out of
that market, Bernard said. “The bulk of what would have to be replaced
on the U.S. side will come from gas.”
</p>
<p>
Whether this would produce a noticeable cost increase for consumers
would largely depend on the price of natural gas. In 2023, imports to
New York from Quebec dropped precipitously because a drought reduced
hydropower capacity, but natural gas prices were also especially low, so
electricity prices were
<a href="https://www.nyserda.ny.gov/Energy-Prices/Electricity/Monthly-Avg-Electricity-Residential" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>not
significantly higher</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Low natural gas prices are not guaranteed in the long term, of course.
“Natural gas prices are very market driven, and the more we are reliant
on natural gas in the northeast, the more demand you put on that supply,
the more those prices are going to go up,” Daniel Sosland, president of
the New England-based environmental nonprofit the Acadia Center, told
me.
</p>
<p>
And if the tariffs remained in effect in 2026, New Yorkers would be hit
much harder. That’s when the Champlain Hudson Power Express, a power
line that will deliver 1,200 megawatts of Canadian hydropower into New
York City, is expected to be completed. The line will supply some 20% of
New York City’s electricity demand.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know what the point of all this is,” Sosland told me.
Electricity trade between the U.S. and Canada brings mutual benefits, he
said. “The idea of tariffs and trying to create a fence along the system
is going to be very destructive to customer cost, to clean air, to power
reliability, because it’s going to foreclose all these other options
that are on the table right now that provide benefits on both sides.”
</p>
<p>
The exception to all of this is a small population of about 58,000
ratepayers in the state of Maine who live near the border and get
virtually <em><em>all</em></em> of their electricity from New Brunswick,
Canada. William Harwood, the public advocate for Maine, estimates these
communities could
<a href="https://mainemorningstar.com/2025/01/22/trumps-tariff-on-canada-could-hike-energy-costs-for-aroostook-and-washington-county-utility-customers/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>see
an increase of $6 to $7 per month</u></a> on their electricity bills.
Harwood didn’t have any additional insight into whether the tariffs
would or could apply to electricity — he was merely looking into the
impacts on constituents if they did. “They are electrically
<em><em>part</em></em> of Canada,” he said.

vs. ChatGPT fuels debate over AI building blocks</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — When Chinese startup DeepSeek released its AI
model this month, it was hailed as a breakthrough, a sign that China’s
artificial intelligence companies could compete with their Silicon
Valley counterparts using fewer resources.</p>
<p>The narrative was clear: DeepSeek had done more with less, finding
clever workarounds to U.S. chip restrictions. However, that storyline
has begun to shift.</p>
<p>OpenAI, the U.S.-based company behind ChatGPT, now claims DeepSeek
may have improperly used its proprietary data to train its model,
raising questions about whether DeepSeek’s success was truly an
engineering marvel.</p>
<p>In statements to several media outlets this week, OpenAI said it is
reviewing indications that DeepSeek may have trained its AI by mimicking
responses from OpenAI’s models.</p>
<p>The process, known as distillation, is common among AI developers but
is prohibited by OpenAI’s terms of service, which forbid using its model
outputs to train competing systems.</p>
<p>Some U.S. officials appear to support OpenAI’s concerns. At his
confirmation hearing this week, Commerce secretary nominee Howard
Lutnick accused DeepSeek of misusing U.S. technology to create a “dirt
cheap” AI model.</p>
<p>“They stole things. They broke in. They’ve taken our IP,” Lutnick
said of China.</p>
<p>David Sacks, the White House czar for AI and cryptocurrency, was more
measured, saying only that it is “possible” that DeepSeek had stolen
U.S. intellectual property.</p>
<p>In an interview with the cable news network Fox News, Sacks added
that there is “substantial evidence” that DeepSeek “distilled the
knowledge out of OpenAI’s models,” adding that stronger efforts are
needed to curb the rise of “copycat” AI systems.</p>
<p>At the center of the dispute is a key question about AI’s future: how
much control should companies have over their own AI models, when those
programs were themselves built using data taken from others?</p>
<p>AI data fight</p>
<p>The question is especially relevant for OpenAI, which faces its own
legal challenges. The company has been sued by several media companies
and authors who accuse it of illegally using copyrighted material to
train its AI models.</p>
<p>Justin Hughes, a Loyola Law School professor specializing in
intellectual property, AI, and data rights, said OpenAI’s accusations
against DeepSeek are “deeply ironic,” given the company’s own legal
troubles.</p>
<p>“OpenAI has had no problem taking everyone else’s content and
claiming it’s ‘fair,’” Hughes told VOA in an email.</p>
<p>“If the reports are accurate that OpenAI violated other platforms’
terms of service to get the training data it has wanted, that would just
add an extra layer of irony – dare we say hypocrisy – to OpenAI
complaining about DeepSeek.”</p>
<p>DeepSeek has not responded to OpenAI’s accusations. In a technical
paper released with its new chatbot, DeepSeek acknowledged that some of
its models were trained alongside other open-source models – such as
Qwen, developed by China’s Alibaba, and Llama, released by Meta –
according to Johnny Zou, a Hong Kong-based AI investment specialist.</p>
<p>However, OpenAI appears to be alleging that DeepSeek improperly used
its closed-source models – which cannot be freely accessed or used to
train other AI systems.</p>
<p>“It’s quite a serious statement,” said Zou, who noted that OpenAI has
not yet presented evidence of wrongdoing by DeepSeek.</p>
<p>Proving improper distillation may be difficult without disclosing
details on how its own models were trained, Zou added.</p>
<p>Even if OpenAI presents concrete proof, its legal options may be
limited. Although Zou noted that the company could pursue a case against
DeepSeek for violating its terms of service, not all experts believe
such a claim would hold up in court.</p>
<p>“Even assuming DeepSeek trained on OpenAI’s data, I don’t think
OpenAI has much of a case,” said Mark Lemley, a professor at Stanford
Law School who specializes in intellectual property and technology.</p>
<p>Even though AI models often have restrictive terms of service, “no
model creator has actually tried to enforce these terms with monetary
penalties or injunctive relief,” Lemley wrote in a recent paper with
co-author Peter Henderson.</p>
<p>The paper argues that these restrictions may be unenforceable, since
the materials they aim to protect are “largely not copyrightable.”</p>
<p>“There are compelling reasons for many of these provisions to be
unenforceable: they chill good faith research, constrain competition,
and create quasi-copyright ownership where none should exist,” the paper
noted.</p>
<p>OpenAI’s main legal argument would likely be breach of contract, said
Hughes. Even if that were the case, though, he added, “good luck
enforcing that against a Chinese company without meaningful assets in
the United States.”</p>
<p>Possible options</p>
<p>The financial stakes are adding urgency to the debate. U.S. tech
stocks dipped Monday after following news of DeepSeek’s advances, though
they later regained some ground.</p>
<p>Commerce nominee Lutnick suggested that further government action,
including tariffs, could be used to deter China from copying advanced AI
models.</p>
<p>But speaking the same day, U.S. President Donald Trump appeared to
take a different view, surprising some industry insiders with an
optimistic take on DeepSeek’s breakthrough.</p>
<p>The Chinese company’s low-cost model, Trump said, was “very much a
positive development” for AI, because “instead of spending billions and
billions, you’ll spend less, and you’ll come up with hopefully the same
solution.”</p>
<p>If DeepSeek has succeeded in building a relatively cheap and
competitive AI model, that may be bad for those with investment – or
stock options – in current generative AI companies, Hughes said.</p>
<p>“But it might be good for the rest of us,” he added, noting that
until recently it appeared that only the existing tech giants “had the
resources to play in the generative AI sandbox.”</p>
<p>“If DeepSeek disproved that, we should hope that what can be done by
a team of engineers in China can be done by a similarly resourced team
of engineers in Detroit or Denver or Boston,” he said.</p>

support for denuclearization talks with Russia, China raises hopes</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>white house — Arms control advocates are hoping U.S. President Donald
Trump’s fresh words of support for denuclearization will lead to talks
with Russia and China on arms reduction.</p>
<p>U.S. negotiations with the Russians and Chinese on denuclearization
and eventual agreements are “very possible,” according to Trump, who
addressed the World Economic Forum a week ago in Davos, Switzerland.</p>
<p>“Tremendous amounts of money are being spent on nuclear [weapons],
and the destructive capability is something that we don’t even want to
talk about because you don’t want to hear,” he said. “It’s too
depressing.”</p>
<p>Trump noted that in his first term, he discussed the topic with
Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>“We were talking about denuclearization of our two countries, and
China would have come along,” according to Trump. “President Putin
really liked the idea of cutting back on nuclear [armaments], and I
think the rest of the world — we would have gotten them to follow.”</p>
<p>Just months before leaving office, former U.S. President Joe Biden
met with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the APEC summit in Peru where
both agreed that decisions regarding the use of nuclear weapons should
remain under human control. That consensus was seen as a positive step
after the Chinese, four months previously, suspended nuclear arms
control talks with Washington to protest American arms sales to
Taiwan.</p>
<p>The horror of nuclear attacks first became evident to many in the
world through magazines in the West, which printed photographs of the
radiation-burned survivors of the U.S. atomic attack on two Japanese
cities in 1945 to end World War II. In subsequent years during the Cold
War, U.S. government films captured the destructive force of test
detonations in the Nevada desert, eventually prompting public
demonstrations to “ban the bomb” and diplomacy to reduce or eliminate
all nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>A major breakthrough occurred in 1987 with the Intermediate-Range
Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) between the United States and the Soviet
Union. It entered into full force the following year. By 1991, nearly
2,700 missiles had been dismantled. That was the first time the two
nuclear superpowers achieved a reduction of such weapons rather than
just limiting their growth.</p>
<p>Over the years, the Americans and the Russians lost their monopoly on
nuclear weapons. Nine countries presently have nuclear arsenals,
although Israel has never acknowledged possession of such weaponry.</p>
<p>The United States and Russia each have more than 5,000 nuclear
warheads — 90% of the world’s total. The combined global force of all
countries’ nuclear weapons could destroy the world many times over,
according to arms control advocates.</p>
<p>The current New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), signed in
2010 by U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian President Dmitry
Medvedev, set limits on the number of deployed strategic nuclear
warheads and delivery systems, while including on-site inspection and
exchanges of data for verification.</p>
<p>The treaty expires in early February 2026, which adds urgency to
Trump’s call for talks with Russia and China, according to Xiaodon
Liang, senior analyst for nuclear weapons policy and disarmament at the
Arms Control Association.</p>
<p>“And because of that, this issue has to be at the top of the agenda,
and having a signal that the president is concerned about this issue and
thinking about it is very positive,” Liang told VOA.</p>
<p>Since a formal, comprehensive agreement could take years to negotiate
— possibly spanning beyond the four years of the second Trump presidency
— Liang suggests the U.S. president consider an “executive agreement”
with Putin, an informal consensus or a series of unilateral steps to
continue adhering to the numbers in New START for an indefinite
period.</p>
<p>“That would be a stabilizing factor in this important bilateral
relationship,” Liang added.</p>
<p>There are analysts who advocate a more aggressive tactic.</p>
<p>Trump should consider ordering a resumption of nuclear testing to
demonstrate to America’s adversaries that the U.S. arsenal of weapons of
mass destruction remains viable and as an act of resolve, writes Robert
Peters, a research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative
think tank seen as having a dominant influence on Trump administration
policies.</p>
<p>Peters also suggests that Trump might want to withdraw from the 1963
Test Ban Treaty made with Moscow and “conduct an above-ground test
either at the Nevada National Security Site or in the Pacific Ocean over
open water, where nuclear fallout can be minimized” to stave escalatory
moves by an adversary to the United States.</p>
<p>The Heritage Foundation did not respond to multiple requests from VOA
to interview Peters.</p>
<p>Moscow is not known to have conducted any sort of test causing a
nuclear chain reaction, known as criticality, since 1990. Two years
later, the United States announced it would no longer test nuclear
weapons, although subcritical simulations continue. The other nuclear
nations have followed suit except North Korea, which last triggered a
nuclear test explosion in 2017.</p>
<p>The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists on Tuesday moved up the hands
of its “Doomsday Clock” by one second to 89 seconds to midnight, meant
to signify the peril from weapons of mass destruction and other
existential threats.</p>
<p>“We set the clock closer to midnight because we do not see positive
progress on the global challenges we face, including nuclear risk,
climate change, biological threats and advances in disruptive
technology,” said Daniel Holz, a physics professor at the University of
Chicago, just after the hands of this year’s clock were unveiled at the
U.S. Institute of Peace.</p>
<p>While the Doomsday Clock is merely symbolic, Liang at the Arms
Control Association sees it as an annual important ritual highlighting
the risks to Americans and everyone else posed by the world’s nuclear
arsenals.</p>
<p>“It is a good tool for bringing this to more people’s attention, and
you can’t blame Americans for having so many other issues on their
plate. And having this [clock] as a reminder, I think, is an effective
communications tool,” Liang said.</p>
<p>At the Doomsday Clock ceremony, VOA asked former Colombian President
and Nobel laureate Juan Manuel Santos what he viewed as the biggest
hurdle to Trump, Putin and Xi making progress on denuclearization.</p>
<p>“The biggest challenge, in my view, is for them to understand that
they should sit down and talk about how the three of them can take
decisions to save their own countries and the whole world,” he said.</p>
<p>Liang compared the situation to U.S. President John F. Kennedy’s call
to Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis,
which led Washington and Moscow to pull back from the brink of nuclear
war.</p>
<p>That resolution turned the hands of the Doomsday Clock the following
year back to 12 minutes to midnight in recognition of the Americans,
Soviets and British banning nuclear testing in the atmosphere, in space
and under water.</p>
<p>It has been several years since the United States engaged in any
denuclearization negotiations. Those working-level talks in 2019 in
Sweden between the first Trump administration and North Korean officials
did not yield any agreement, with Pyongyang’s chief negotiator, Kim
Myong Gil, telling reporters that the Americans had raised expectations
with promises of flexibility but would not “give up their old viewpoint
and attitude.”</p>
<p>The State Department spokesperson at the time, Morgan Ortagus, said
in a statement the two countries could not be expected to “overcome a
legacy of 70 years of war and hostility on the Korean Peninsula in the
course of a single Saturday,” but such weighty issues “require a strong
commitment by both countries. The United States has that
commitment.”</p>

id="spain-well-short-of-nato-defense-target-as-trump-demands-huge-additional-spending">Spain
well short of NATO defense target, as Trump demands huge additional
spending</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>As U.S. President Donald Trump demands a large increase in defense
spending by NATO allies, the spotlight has fallen on Spain, which spends
the least on defense of all member states relative to the size of its
economy.</p>
<p>Spain is the eurozone’s fourth-biggest economy. The country spent an
estimated $21.3 billion on defense last year, equating to 1.28% of its
gross domestic product (GDP), putting it at the bottom of the league
among the 32-nation Atlantic alliance.</p>
<p>That’s despite a pledge made by all NATO members in 2014 to spend at
least 2% of GDP on defense, according to the bloc.</p>
<p>NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte visited Madrid and Lisbon earlier
this week and warned all members of the need to boost spending beyond
existing targets.</p>
<p>“The goal of 2%, now set a decade ago, will not be enough to meet the
challenges of tomorrow. The threat from Russia may seem distant, but let
me assure you, it is not,” Rutte said at a press conference in Lisbon on
Jan. 27.</p>
<p>“NATO is strong today. To keep NATO strong we must, however, continue
to adapt. And to guarantee our security in the future, we also need to
ramp up our efforts now. It also means we need to spend more in our
defense,” he said.</p>
<p>Only 23 of the 32 NATO member states were expected to meet the 2%
target by 2024, according to the alliance.</p>
<p>Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has rejected criticism that his
government has been too slow to boost defense spending.</p>
<p>In a statement, the prime minister’s office said Monday that Spain
was a “serious, responsible and committed ally of NATO,” noting that the
government had increased defense spending by 70% in the last decade.</p>
<p>“Spain’s commitment to reach 2% of defense spending by 2029 is firm,”
the statement said.</p>
<p>Spanish troops are also helping to train Ukrainian forces as Kyiv
battles Russia’s invasion.</p>
<p>Trump criticism</p>
<p>That’s unlikely to be enough to satisfy NATO’s biggest spender, the
United States, which spent 3.38% of its GDP on defense in 2024.</p>
<p>Earlier in January, Trump described Spain’s contribution to NATO as
“very low” and has demanded a much higher spending target from European
allies.</p>
<p>“I’m also going to ask all NATO nations to increase defense spending
to 5% of GDP, which is what it should have been years ago,” Trump told
delegates by video link at the World Economic Forum in Davos on
Jan. 23.</p>
<p>Trump has long complained that European allies are taking advantage
of the United States, insisting that they should share the burden of
defense spending.</p>
<p>However, the 5% target is unrealistic for Spain, according to analyst
Pere Ortega of the Delas Center for Peace Studies in Madrid.</p>
<p>“Reaching 5% is impossible. That would mean that Spain would have to
spend almost 65 billion euros [$67.7 billion]. That is impossible,
because we do not have that economic capacity,” Ortega told VOA.</p>
<p>“No political program would ask for an increase in military spending
to reach 3, 4 or 5% … because that would be in some way making
sacrifices in the social security sphere. And the Spanish population
would penalize that with their vote at the polls,” Ortega added.</p>
<p>Lithuania boost</p>
<p>Trump does have some support in Europe. Lithuania plans to raise
defense spending to 5% or 6% of GDP by 2026. Announcing the increase on
January 17, Lithuanian Minister of Defense Dovile Sakaliene said the
policy was a response to regional threats.</p>
<p>“We are fitting in with NATO defense plans, which are vital to our
region,” he said.</p>
<p>Poland and Estonia have also indicated their intention to boost
defense spending toward Trump’s target of 5%.</p>
<p>France has also urged allies to invest more, although Paris only met
the 2% target itself in 2023.</p>
<p>“What will we do in Europe tomorrow if our American ally withdraws
its warships from the Mediterranean? If they send their fighter jets
from the Atlantic to the Pacific?” French President Emmanuel Macron said
Jan. 20 in an address to members of the French military. “These are
scenarios that we need to prepare for. These are the scenarios that we
are preparing for.”</p>
<p>At his first NATO summit as U.S. president in 2017, Trump berated
other members for failing to spend enough on defense. European allies,
including Spain, are braced for further robust diplomacy ahead of the
next summit, scheduled to be held in The Hague in June.</p>

skaters, group of hunters and students among victims of air crash</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WICHITA, KANSAS — The victims of a crash between an American Airlines
jet and an Army helicopter included teen figure skaters returning from a
national meet with their mothers and coaches, an Ohio college student
coming from her grandfather’s funeral, two Chinese nationals and a group
of hunters headed back from a guided trip in Kansas.</p>
<p>They were among 60 travelers and four crew members on board the
commercial flight late Wednesday when it collided with the Black Hawk
helicopter, which was carrying three soldiers. Officials say there were
no survivors.</p>
<p>As the search for remains continued Thursday, communities grieved.
Faith leaders held a vigil Thursday in the city council chambers. “The
only way we will get through this is together,” said the Rev. Pamela
Hughes Mason of Wichita’s St. Paul AME Church.</p>
<p>American Airlines set up a hotline as well as centers in Washington
and Wichita for people searching for information about family members
who may have been aboard the downed flight.</p>
<p>Here’s what we know about some of the people killed in Wednesday
night’s crash:</p>
<p>From the Skating Club of Boston</p>
<p>Skaters Jinna Han and Spencer Lane were among those killed, according
to Doug Zeghibe, CEO of the Skating Club of Boston. Their mothers, Jin
Han and Christine Lane, as well as their coaches Evgenia Shishkova and
Vadim Naumov also died. Han and Lane, who was about 16, were returning
from the U.S. Figure Skating Championships.</p>
<p>“We watched Jinna just grow up here from just a tiny little tyke into
this amazingly mature 13-year-old,” he said. “A great performer, a great
competitor, and off the ice, a great kid.”</p>
<p>Spencer Lane, who was from Barrington, Rhode Island, took part in his
first professional show in December with Elin Schran’s company, Joy
Skate Productions.</p>
<p>“He started to discover this connection with the audience and that
joy that he was giving to other people through his gift,” Schran
said.</p>
<p>In a statement, the Lane family recalled Christine Lane for both her
singular talents and her dedication to parenting. “Christine exuded
creativity throughout her life, using her formal graphic design training
as a jumping-off point for seemingly endless creative pursuits across
areas such as photography, quilting, knitting, and more. She brought
even greater passion to her role as a mother to Spencer and his brother
Milo,” the family said.</p>
<p>Their coaches, Shishkova and Naumov, won the pairs title at the 1994
world championships in Chiba, Japan. The Russia-born pair also competed
twice in the Olympics.</p>
<p>More young athletes and coaches</p>
<p>Skating organizations in Philadelphia and the Washington area also
said some of their young athletes had been aboard the plane.</p>
<p>Several athletes on the flight had attended a development camp held
after the U.S. Figure Skating Championships ended Sunday in Wichita,
Kansas.</p>
<p>Wichita Skating Center manager Sean O’Reilly said the championships
brought a “groundswell of positivity,” drawing enthusiastic parents and
young athletes from across the U.S. He was “gutted” to learn some of
those skaters had been killed.</p>
<p>In Virginia’s Loudoun County, a coach at a skating club was also
identified as among the passengers, Virginia Rep. Suhas Subramanyam
confirmed. The club, Ashburn Ice House, said that its “figure skating
community has been directly affected,” but did not give further
details.</p>
<p>Students</p>
<p>Students and parents at Cedarville University in Ohio said one of the
passengers on the plane was Grace Maxwell, a junior majoring in
mechanical engineering. Maxwell’s father, Dean Maxwell, said she was
returning to campus from her home in Wichita, Kansas, after attending
her grandfather’s funeral, The Wichita Eagle reported.</p>
<p>Grace Maxwell had been working on a project this semester to create a
hand-stabilizing device to help a boy in the area feed himself instead
of relying on others, the university said in a statement.</p>
<p>“Grace was a quiet person with a keen interest in helping others
through engineering,” said Tim Norman, who served as her secondary
adviser.</p>
<p>Three other students from schools in Fairfax County, Virginia, and
six parents from the district were also on board the plane,
superintendent Michelle Reid said in a letter to families. She did not
identify them, but she said the students were from different schools and
that two of the parents were current or former district staffers.</p>
<p>Chinese citizens, Philippines police officer</p>
<p>Chinese citizens and a cop from the Philippines Philippine Police
Col. Pergentino Malabed Jr., who headed the supply management division
of the national police, was among the dead.</p>
<p>He had traveled to the U.S. to inspect equipment the Philippines was
planning to purchase for its 232,000-member force, according to the
Philippine police.</p>
<p>“His untimely passing is a profound loss to the Philippine National
Police, where he served with honor, with integrity and dedication
throughout his career,” Philippine police said in a statement.</p>
<p>The Chinese Embassy in the U.S. said two Chinese nationals were also
among the victims. It did not offer further details. The country’s
Ministry of Foreign Affairs offered its condolences for the crash
victims and requested the U.S. to “promptly report any progress with the
search and rescue and find out the cause of the accident as soon as
possible.”</p>
<p>Hunters headed home from a trip</p>
<p>Seven people returning from a guided hunting trip in Kansas were
killed, according to a Facebook post by Fowl Plains, the guide
service.</p>
<p>The Fowl Plains team said they had grown close to the hunters on
board the flight over the years and considered them to be family
members. The post doesn’t identify the hunters by name, but it says they
had spent the past week on a guided hunt, “laughing, talking about our
families and sharing memories.”</p>
<p>“Heartbroken is an understatement,” the company said.</p>
<p>Members of a Maryland union</p>
<p>Those killed also included four steamfitters, all members of a United
Association union local in suburban Maryland, union leaders said in a
social media post Thursday.</p>
<p>“Our focus now is on providing support and care to the families of
our brothers as we continue to gather more information in the coming
days,” said the post by UA General President Mark McManus and Chris
Madello, the business manager of Local 602.</p>
<p>From the military</p>
<p>The victims also include three soldiers who were aboard the
helicopter. Officials said their remains will be at Air Force Mortuary
Affairs Operations at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware. That office
coordinates the dignified transfer of fallen service members. The
officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details not yet
announced.</p>
<p>No identities of the crew have been released. But the wife of one of
the helicopter pilots said on Facebook that her husband, Andrew Eaves of
Noxubee County, Mississippi, was killed.</p>
<p>In a phone call, Carrie Eaves confirmed the post was hers. “We ask
that you pray for our family and friends and for all the other families
that are suffering today. We ask for peace while we grieve,” her post
read.</p>
<p>The three soldiers were doing an annual night proficiency training
flight, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said, adding they were a “fairly
experienced crew.” Officials were notifying relatives, he said.</p>

confirms North Dakota’s Burgum as Trump interior secretary</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The U.S. Senate on Thursday confirmed Doug Burgum, the former
governor of North Dakota, as President Donald Trump’s interior
secretary.</p>
<p>The vote was 79-18.</p>
<p>Burgum, 68, will lead an agency that guides the use of 202 million
hectares of federal and tribal land, a fifth of the nation’s surface
area.</p>
<p>He is expected to pursue Trump’s goal of maximizing energy and
mineral production on public lands, likely by ratcheting up new leasing
in oil-producing states like Wyoming and New Mexico and in the Gulf of
Mexico, which Trump has said is now officially called the Gulf of
America.</p>
<p>A wealthy former software executive, Burgum has portrayed himself as
a traditional, business-minded conservative.</p>
<p>During his nomination hearing, Burgum said he would expand oil and
gas drilling rights auctions and support permitting reforms that could
speed development of energy projects like transmission lines and
pipelines.</p>
<p>His comments signaled a sharp turn in federal policy after former
President Joe Biden’s administration sought to limit oil and gas
drilling on federal lands and promote renewable energy sources like wind
and solar as part of its climate change agenda.</p>
<p>Burgum ran against Trump for the Republican presidential nomination
before quitting and becoming a Trump supporter. He is also being
considered to head a new national council to coordinate policies to
boost U.S. energy output.</p>

id="judge-extends-court-monitoring-agreement-for-children-in-customs-and-border-protection-custody">Judge
extends court-monitoring agreement for children in Customs and Border
Protection custody</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>McALLEN, TEXAS — A federal judge extended a court agreement on
Thursday ensuring safe and sanitary conditions for migrant children in
federal custody a day after U.S. Customs and Border Protection was set
to begin self-monitoring.</p>
<p>The agreement originally ended Wednesday, but District Judge Dolly M.
Gee in California decided to extend it by 18 months.</p>
<p>“CBP is not yet capable of wholly fulfilling its responsibilities
under the 2022 Settlement and the FSA (Flores Settlement Agreement)
without the additional support provided by the JCM (Juvenile Care
Monitor) and the Court,” the judge wrote in her order.</p>
<p>Customs and Border Protection did not immediately respond to a
request for comment.</p>
<p>A court-appointed monitor will continue to visit and report on
conditions for children in custody at U.S. Customs and Border Protection
facilities in the Rio Grande Valley and El Paso, Texas.</p>
<p>Concerns were initially raised during the first Trump administration
when reports surfaced of children separated from family for weeks and
held in poor sanitary conditions. In 2019, a Guatemalan teenager died in
custody as a result of a flu outbreak and a lack of proper medical care
in a federal facility in Weslaco, Texas.</p>
<p>The parties reached an agreement that was implemented in July 2022
for 2½ years. It allowed a court monitor to keep track of progress made
by Customs and Border Protection. In the last report filed in December,
the monitor noted positive changes while also mentioning a continued
practice of separating some parents from their children during their
time in custody.</p>
<p>The monitor later told the court of discrepancies with Customs and
Border Protection data suggesting the agency underreported the number of
children who had exceeded the recommended time in custody of three
days.</p>
<p>Customs and Border Protection was scheduled to begin self-monitoring
its facilities on Wednesday. The agency said in December it was ready
for the task after issuing new guidance on family unity and increased
training on detention policies, guidelines and regulations that rolled
back court oversight under the Biden administration. Plaintiffs argued
the agency was not ready, citing testimony from minors held in Customs
and Border Protection facilities, and they requested the renewal of the
court agreement.</p>
<p>“No child should be forced to spend weeks inside a windowless pod in
dirty clothes with no access to the outdoors. We are relieved the Court
ruled to force CBP to meet its obligations under the settlement,” Mishan
Wroe, senior attorney for the National Youth Law Center, said in a
statement.</p>
<p>Trump officials have said they plan to end “catch-and-release”
policies and stop the release of migrants into the U.S. while they wait
for immigration court hearings. The changes could result in longer
detention times exceeding the court-recommended 72 hours for
families.</p>

<h2 id="dick-button-olympic-great-and-voice-of-skating-dies-at-95">Dick
Button, Olympic great and voice of skating, dies at 95</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Dick Button was more than the most accomplished men’s
figure skater in history. He was one of his sport’s greatest innovators
and promoters.</p>
<p>Button, winner of two Olympic gold medals and five consecutive world
championships, died Thursday, said his son, Edward, who did not provide
a cause. He was 95.</p>
<p>As an entrepreneur and broadcaster, Button promoted skating and its
athletes, transforming a niche sport into the showpiece of every Winter
Olympics.</p>
<p>“Dick was one of the most important figures in our sport,” Scott
Hamilton said. “There wasn’t a skater after Dick who wasn’t helped by
him in some way.”</p>
<p>Button’s impact began after World War II. He was the first U.S. men’s
champion — and his country’s youngest at age 16 — when that competition
returned in 1946. Two years later, he took the title at the St. Moritz
Olympics, competing outdoors. He performed the first double axel in any
competition and became the first American to win the men’s event.</p>
<p>“By the way, that jump had a cheat on it,” Button told the U.S.
Olympic Committee website. “But listen, I did it and that was what
counted.”</p>
<p>That began his dominance of international skating, and U.S. amateur
sports. He was the first figure skater to win the prestigious Sullivan
Award in 1949 — no other figure skater won it until Michelle Kwan in
2001.</p>
<p>In 1952, while a Harvard student, he won a second gold at the Oslo
Games, making more history with the first triple jump (a loop) in
competition. Soon after, he won a fifth world title, then gave up his
eligibility as an amateur. All Olympic sports were subject to an
amateur/professional division at the time.</p>
<p>“I had achieved everything I could have dreamed of doing as a
skater,” said Button, who earned a law degree from Harvard in 1956. “I
was able to enjoy the Ice Capades (show) and keep my hand in skating,
and that was very important to me.”</p>
<p>With the Emmy Award-winning Button as the TV analyst, viewers got to
learn not only the basics but the nuances of a sport foreign to many as
he frankly broke down the performances. He became as much a fixture on
ABC’s Wide World of Sports as Jim McKay and the hapless ski jumper
tumbling down the slope.</p>
<p>“Dick Button is the custodian of the history of figure skating and
its quintessential voice,” 1988 Olympic champion Brian Boitano said in
Button’s autobiography. “He made the words ‘lutz’ and ‘salchow’ part of
our everyday vocabulary.”</p>
<p>After a 1961 plane crash killed the entire U.S. figure skating team
on the way to the world championships, which then were canceled, Button
persuaded ABC Sports executive Roone Arledge to televise the 1962 event
on Wide World. That’s when he joined the network as a commentator.</p>
<p>Button’s death coincided with another tragedy in the skating world,
Wednesday night’s crash of an American Airlines flight that collided
with an Army helicopter and plummeted into the Potomac River outside
Washington, D.C., killing everyone on board. Two teenage figure skaters,
their mothers, and two former world champions who were coaching at the
Skating Club of Boston were among the 14 people killed from the skating
community.</p>
<p>Button skated for the Boston club and remained close to it for the
rest of his life. The trophy room at the club is named in his honor.</p>
<p>He also provided opportunities for skaters to make money after their
competitive careers. He ran professional events he created for TV for
years, attracting many top names in the sport — Hamilton, Torvill and
Dean, Kristi Yamaguchi, Kurt Browning and Katarina Witt.</p>
<p>Button’s Candid Productions, formed 1959, also produced such
made-for-TV programs as Battle of the Network Stars. He also dabbled in
acting, but the rink was his realm.</p>
<p>“Dick Button created an open and honest space in figure skating
broadcasting where no topic or moment was off-limits,” said Johnny Weir,
the three-time U.S. champion and current NBC Sports figure skating
analyst. “He told it like it was, even when his opinion wasn’t a popular
one. His zingers were always in my mind when I would perform for him,
and I wanted to make him as happy and proud as I would my coaches.</p>
<p>“I think that is something very special about commentating figure
skating. As an athlete, we rarely have an opportunity to speak, and we
rely on the TV voices to tell our story for us. Nobody could do it like
Mr. Button.”</p>

economy grows solid 2.3% in October-December on eve of Trump return to
White House</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — A humming American economy ended 2024 on a solid note
with consumer spending continuing to drive growth, and ahead of what
could be a significant change in direction under a Trump
administration.</p>
<p>The Commerce Department reported Thursday that gross domestic product
— the economy’s output of goods and services — expanded at a 2.3% annual
rate from October through December.</p>
<p>For the full year, the economy grew a healthy 2.8%, compared with
2.9% in 2023.</p>
<p>The fourth-quarter growth was a tick below the 2.4% economists had
expected, according to a survey of forecasters by the data firm
FactSet.</p>
<p>Consumer spending grew at a 4.2% pace, fastest since January-March
2023 and up from 3.7% in July-September last year. But business
investment tumbled as investment in equipment plunged after two straight
strong quarters.</p>
<p>Wednesday’s report also showed persistent inflationary pressure at
the end of 2024. The Federal Reserve’s favored inflation gauge — called
the personal consumption expenditures index, or PCE — rose at a 2.3%
annual pace last quarter, up from 1.5% in the third quarter and above
the Fed’s 2% target. Excluding volatile food and energy prices,
so-called core PCE inflation was 2.5%, up from 2.2% in the
July-September quarter.</p>
<p>A drop in business inventories shaved 0.93 percentage points off
fourth-quarter growth.</p>
<p>But a category within the GDP data that measures the economy’s
underlying strength rose at a healthy 3.2% annual rate from July through
September, slipping from 3.4% in the third quarter. This category
includes consumer spending and private investment but excludes volatile
items like exports, inventories and government spending.</p>
<p>Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics,
said that figure “suggests the economy remains strong, particularly
given the fourth-quarter disruptions,’’ including a strike at Boeing and
the aftermath of two hurricanes.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump has inherited a healthy economy. Growth has
been steady and unemployment low — 4.1% in December.</p>
<p>The economy has proven remarkably resilient after the Fed’s inflation
fighters raised rates 11 times in 2022 and 2023 to combat the biggest
surge in consumer prices since the 1980s. Instead of sliding into a
recession, as most economists predicted, GDP kept expanding. Growth has
now topped 2% in nine of the last 10 quarters.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the Fed left its benchmark interest rate unchanged
after making three cuts since September. With the economy rolling along,
Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters, “we do not need to be in a
hurry’’ to make more cuts. The Fed is also cautious because progress
against inflation has stalled in recent months after falling from
four-decade highs hit in mid-2022.</p>
<p>The European Central Bank cut its benchmark rate by a quarter point
Thursday, underlining the contrast between more robust growth in the
U.S. economy and stagnation in Europe, which recorded zero growth at the
end of last year.</p>
<p>The U.S. economic outlook has become more cloudy, however. Trump has
promised to cut taxes and ease regulations on business, which could
speed GDP growth. But his plan to impose big taxes on imports and to
deport millions of immigrants working in the United States illegally
could mean slower growth and higher prices.</p>
<p>Trump said last week that he would lower oil prices and then
“demand’’ lower interest rates – a topic he said he’d take up with
Powell. But the Fed chair deflected questions about Trump’s comments
Wednesday and said he’d had no contact with the president.</p>
<p>Trump has also tried to reshape the federal government, offering
buyouts to workers and issuing a memo Monday night freezing federal
grants, then rescinding the memo Wednesday after a public outcry.</p>
<p>Citing the “squeeze’’ on the federal government, Ashworth wrote in a
commentary,”we wouldn’t be surprised to see a reversal in the first
quarter. As a starting point, we expect first-quarter GDP growth to slow
marginally below 2%.’’</p>
<p>Thursday’s GDP release was the first of three Commerce Department
estimates of October-December growth.</p>

id="washington-crash-mars-long-record-of-us-aviation-safety">Washington
crash mars long record of US aviation safety</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A collision between a passenger jet and U.S. Army helicopter near
Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport late Wednesday marked the
first time in more than 15 years that there had been a mass fatality
event in U.S. airspace related to commercial aviation.</p>
<p>The accident, which killed a reported 67 people, took place while
American Airlines Flight 5342 was making its final approach to the
runway. The Bombardier CRJ700 regional jet and the Sikorsky H-60,
commonly known as a Black Hawk, collided only a few hundred meters above
the ground, officials said.</p>
<p>The plane was carrying 60 passengers and four crew members. There
were three service members aboard the military helicopter, including the
pilot. Both aircraft crashed into the icy waters of the Potomac River,
and authorities said Thursday that they didn’t believe there were any
survivors.</p>
<p>The accident took place in darkness at 8:47 p.m., and no significant
weather problems were reported. As of Thursday, authorities had not
identified the cause of the accident.</p>
<p>However, The New York Times on Thursday, citing an “internal
preliminary Federal Aviation Administration safety report” it reviewed,
reported that staffing at the airport’s air traffic control tower was
“not normal” Wednesday night. The newspaper said a single air traffic
controller was directing incoming and outgoing plane traffic as well as
helicopter traffic in the area. Those jobs are usually split between two
controllers.</p>
<p>Experts consider crash an anomaly</p>
<p>Aviation experts said as tragic as the accident was, it should be
considered an anomaly in an air traffic system that has been notably
free of major disasters for many years.</p>
<p>“Some of it was luck. Some of it is technology. And mostly it was the
tremendous job that the pilots and air traffic controllers do,” former
United Airlines pilot Captain Ross “Rusty” Aimer told VOA.</p>
<p>“They literally perform miracles every day because our system is
extremely congested everywhere you go. … And Washington National Airport
is, perhaps in my 60 years in aviation, one of the most demanding and
busiest airports in the world.”</p>
<p>It is necessary to look back to 2009 to find a comparable commercial
disaster in U.S. airspace. At that time, a Colgan Air jet en route from
New Jersey to Buffalo, New York, stalled during its approach and crashed
into a house, killing 49 passengers and crew, as well as one individual
in the house.</p>
<p>In 2013, an Asiana Airlines jet crashed while landing in San
Francisco, California. Two passengers who were not wearing seat belts
were killed when they were thrown from the plane, and another person
died after being struck by an emergency response vehicle on the tarmac.
There were 187 other people who suffered injuries, many serious, but no
other fatalities.</p>
<p>While there have been a number of other high-profile incidents
involving U.S. airlines recently, none involved mass casualties. Last
year, for example, a door plug blew out of an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737
Max in midflight, but the plane landed safely, though some passengers
suffered minor injuries.</p>
<p>Experts stressed that such events occur in only a tiny fraction of
the millions of flights that take place in the U.S. every year.</p>
<p>Robert W. Mann Jr., an airline industry analyst and former senior
airline executive, told VOA that the U.S. commercial aviation industry
experiences an extremely low level of safety incidents and “an even
lower level of fatality accidents.”</p>
<p>“That’s not luck, that’s effort,” he said. “We’re thankful to have so
many professionals in the operating environment. In the oversight
environment, focus on safety is the number one priority.”</p>
<p>Crash occurs in crowded airspace</p>
<p>The accident took place in one of the most crowded — and highly
regulated — sectors of airspace in the United States. The Washington
region has three major airports, 11 regional airports and dozens of
heliports — not counting the multiple military installations in the
region with aviation operations.</p>
<p>Keith M. Cianfrani, a retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel who served
as a flight instructor and an accident investigator, told VOA he flew
helicopters in the area where the accident took place while on active
duty and later as a commercial pilot.</p>
<p>“It’s congested,” said Cianfrani, who now works as an aviation safety
consultant and adjunct professor at Embry‑Riddle Aeronautical
University. “So, it’s not unusual to cross the path of an incoming
[plane] as long as there is traffic separation.”</p>
<p>Traffic separation refers to the distance, in time and space, between
aircraft in the same area.</p>
<p>But because of the congestion, there are very clear rules about where
aircraft are allowed to be and when they can be there, Cianfrani said.
Helicopters are required to follow specific routes when passing through
the region, he said, calling it “very uncommon” to see something like
Wednesday’s crash take place.</p>
<p>“As a whole, the general aviation industry in the United States is
outstanding,” he said. “They all have to adhere to what we call SMS —
safety management systems. On a regular basis, they get audited. They
have an internal audit program, and they’re constantly being looked at
by people like myself going in and auditing their safety program. So,
it’s outstanding.”</p>
<p>Turnover in federal aviation oversight</p>
<p>Wednesday’s accident took place at a time when leadership of the
federal agencies in charge of flight safety is being overhauled by the
new administration of President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>The day after his inauguration, Trump dismissed Transportation
Security Administration Administrator David Pekoske and disbanded the
Aviation Security Advisory Committee, which provides the federal
government with recommendations for aviation safety. He also initiated a
hiring freeze, preventing the hiring of new air traffic controllers.</p>
<p>Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, who oversees the Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA), was sworn in the day before the
crash.</p>
<p>Michael Whitaker, who served as administrator of the FAA in former
President Joe Biden’s administration, announced in December that he
would resign his post on January 20, the day Trump took office.</p>
<p>The new president has not yet nominated a permanent replacement for
Whitaker, but on Thursday he named Chris Rocheleau, a former Air Force
officer who has spent more than 20 years at the FAA, as interim
administrator.</p>
<p>Trump spreads blame</p>
<p>With recovery teams still searching for bodies in the Potomac River
on Thursday, Trump held a press conference and attempted to pin blame
for the accident on the previous presidential administration. He
asserted, with no proof or evidence, that the Biden administration had
lowered hiring standards for air traffic controllers as part of its
“diversity, equity, and inclusion” efforts.</p>
<p>Trump took particular aim at former Transportation Secretary Pete
Buttigieg, saying he had driven the agency “right into the ground with
his diversity.”</p>
<p>Buttigieg responded with a post on the social media platform X.</p>
<p>“Despicable,” Buttigieg wrote. “As families grieve, Trump should be
leading, not lying. We put safety first, drove down close calls, grew
Air Traffic Control, and had zero commercial airline crash fatalities
out of millions of flights on our watch.</p>
<p>“President Trump now oversees the military and the FAA,” he added.
“One of his first acts was to fire and suspend some of the key personnel
who helped keep our skies safe. Time for the President to show actual
leadership and explain what he will do to prevent this from happening
again.”</p>

Trump faces tough task to denuclearize North Korea</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The White House says President Donald Trump is going to
pursue the denuclearization of North Korea, although analysts say that
is easier said than done.</p>
<p>White House National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes told
VOA Korean via email this week that “President Trump had a good
relationship with [North Korean leader] Kim Jong Un,” and that Trump’s
“mix of toughness and diplomacy led to the first-ever leader-level
commitment to complete denuclearization.”</p>
<p>Trump and Kim met three times in 2018-19, in Singapore, Hanoi and
over the inter-Korean border at Panmunjom.</p>
<p>Trump, who has recently called North Korea “a nuclear power,” said in
an interview with Fox News last week that he would reach out to Kim
again, adding, “He liked me, and I got along with him.”</p>
<p>Commitment to denuclearization</p>
<p>Former U.S. government officials say there is no doubt that Trump is
serious about resuming talks with Kim.</p>
<p>Susan Thornton, a former senior U.S. diplomat for Asian affairs, told
VOA Korean on Wednesday via email it “seems clear that President Trump
plans to pick up where he left off with Kim Jong Un in his first
administration.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thornton, who was acting assistant secretary of state for East Asian
and Pacific affairs during the first Trump administration, said Trump
would “like to hold Kim and North Korea to the 2018 Singapore joint
statement that included Kim’s commitment to the complete
denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.”  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>However, “much has changed since then, and Kim’s hand is stronger, so
it won’t be easy,” Thornton said, referring to Pyongyang’s development
of more advanced weapons.</p>
<p>The state-run Korean Central News Agency, or KCNA, reported Wednesday
that Kim said it was “indispensable” to bolster nuclear forces, as North
Korea continues to face “confrontations with the most vicious, hostile
countries.”</p>
<p>Last Saturday, the North test-fired what it said were sea-to-surface
strategic cruise-guided missiles. Kim, who inspected the test launch,
said the country’s war deterrence means are “being perfected more
thoroughly,” according to KCNA.</p>
<p>Evans Revere, former acting secretary for East Asia and Pacific
affairs during the George W. Bush administration, told VOA Korean on the
phone Wednesday that Kim would agree to come back to the table if he
believed reengaging with Washington “could help him attain any of his
own goals with respect to his nuclear and missile programs and relations
with the United States.”</p>
<p>Revere is skeptical that any of Kim’s goals would include his
regime’s denuclearization.</p>
<p>“The North Koreans might dangle the possibility of a discussion about
denuclearization to attract the United States into a dialogue, but it
would not be a serious proposal,” he said. “Quite frankly, they are
determined to keep their weapons, keep their capabilities, which they
regard as essential to their own existence.”</p>
<p>Daunting task</p>
<p>Frank Aum, a senior expert on North Korea at the U.S. Institute of
Peace who worked at the Department of Defense from 2010 to 2017, said
denuclearization is not a realistic goal to achieve in the near or
medium term. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“The best thing Trump can do to increase the odds of North Korea’s
engagement is to resolve Russia’s war in Ukraine, which would decrease
North Korea’s leverage and signal that a U.S. offer better than the one
in Hanoi might be on the table,” Aum said in an email to VOA Korean.</p>
<p>North Korea has sent about 10,000 troops to Russia to help Moscow in
its war against Ukraine. In return, North Korea has received military or
financial assistance, according to U.S. and South Korean officials.</p>
<p>The February 2019 talks, in which Trump and Kim met for the second
time, collapsed after Kim asked for full lifting of sanctions in
exchange for the dismantling of the country’s main nuclear complex in
Yongbyon, about 100 kilometers north of Pyongyang. Trump demanded more
should be done on Kim’s end.</p>
<p>Aum said Kim would likely not have budged from his position
then. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Trump may probe to see if he can get Kim to accept partial sanctions
relief instead, like he tried at Hanoi, or offer more for Yongbyon,” Aum
said. “It seems clear that Kim will not offer any more security
concessions than Yongbyon.”</p>
<p>Sydney Seiler, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, told VOA Korean via email on Wednesday that “for
now, it is unlikely any meeting, if it takes place, will reasonably be
related to denuclearization.”</p>
<p>“Trump will likely seek to keep the ultimate goal of denuclearization
alive while exploring ways in which to reduce the threat,” Seiler
said.</p>
<p>Referring to recent comments by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio
on the failure of sanctions to halt the North Korean nuclear program,
Seiler speculated that sanctions relief may be offered for significant
steps in the new talks between Washington and Pyongyang.</p>
<p>Seiler added that military exercises and extended deterrence may also
be reduced in terms of their frequency, volume and scale, in exchange
for a halt or slowing of Kim’s long-range missile launches and nuclear
tests.</p>
<p>In June 2018, Trump decided to suspend major military exercises with
South Korea in an apparent gesture of good faith, right after his first
meeting with Kim in Singapore. It raised some fears among South Koreans
that such a move could weaken defense against the North.</p>

lawmakers weigh cost of foreign aid freeze in competition with
China</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. lawmakers Thursday weighed the impact that President Donald
Trump’s 90-day foreign aid freeze will have on competition with
China.</p>
<p>Trump signed an executive order within hours of being sworn in as
president ordering a halt to all U.S. international assistance while the
new administration determines whether the aid aligns with his “America
First” policy.</p>
<p>Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jim Risch said the move
was a necessary step to prioritize fiscal responsibility as the U.S.
faces a debt of $36 trillion.</p>
<p>“This is obviously a work in progress,” Risch, a Republican from
Idaho, said Thursday.</p>
<p>“It was intended to underscore the fact that we’re going into debt at
the rate of $1 trillion every 100 days. I think that has certainly been
underscored as a result of this. If you think this is bad, when our
debtors come and want their money and we can’t pay it, that’s going to
be really bad,” Risch said. “It’s caused everyone to take a breath and
look at how we’re spending our money, where we’re spending our money,
seeing that it’s done as efficiently as possible. Admittedly, there have
been some inconveniences along the line, but they’re continuing to work
on this.”</p>
<p>Democrats said the pause in aid creates a void that will be filled by
the People’s Republic of China (PRC).</p>
<p>“I’m particularly concerned about the expansion of China’s influence,
both at home and abroad, as a result of a freeze on our foreign
assistance — and, in particular, the way it’s implemented in its
cascading effect,” Democratic Senator Chris Coons of Delaware said in a
hearing about Chinese influence abroad.</p>
<p>“There is nothing China wants to do more than limit the reach of our
global influence, than to reinforce its imprint,” Coons added. “[That
way] we’re an unreliable partner with countries throughout the world and
particularly in the Global South, and my concern is that we put our
security, our economic and our diplomatic interest at risk with an
abrupt pause that puts a halt to actions to counter malign activity by
the PRC, to advance to invest in infrastructure.”</p>
<p>But Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the top Democrat on the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Democrats should not be the
only ones concerned about evaluating and restoring the aid.</p>
<p>“I hope that all of you on the other side of the aisle will share
your concerns with the administration and point out that this is not a
partisan issue,” she said. “This is about what are we going to do to
ensure that our influence continues around the world in the interest of
our own national security.”</p>
<p>Around the world, U.S.-funded foreign aid programs have already begun
shutting down their programming and laying off staff in the wake of the
freeze. The U.S. is the world’s largest foreign aid provider but is
outspent by China in some areas. According to the Government
Accountability Office, between 2013 and 2022, China spent $679 billion
on global infrastructure projects compared with the United States’ $76
billion.</p>
<p>“Foreign aid is a really important arrow in the quiver of U.S.
national security, along with other tools such as diplomacy, military
assistance and so on,” Jennifer Lind, an associate professor of
government at Dartmouth College, told lawmakers Thursday. “And so
ideally, we would want to be using all of our different tools in a
coordinated fashion to achieve our objectives. For that reason, I think
it’s understandable if the administration wants to take a short pause
and assess: Are we using the right tools in the right way?”</p>
<p>But Melanie Hart of the Atlantic Council said the freeze “is hobbling
America’s ability to compete with China in every domain.”</p>
<p>“Over $1 billion more foreign military financing for Taiwan. Frozen.
NDI [National Democratic Institute] and IRI [International Republican
Institute] are shutting down global operations. Human rights
organizations — frozen,” she said. “Washington has effectively abandoned
the Hong Kong pro-democracy movement.”</p>
<p>Hart said she understood the administration’s desire to maximize the
strategic focus of the aid and appreciated the State Department’s
waivers, but that “this broad freeze hobbles America at a moment when we
are in the battle of the century.”</p>
<p>“It is a massive gift to Beijing. The longer it goes on, the harder
it will be to regain the ground we are already losing today, tomorrow
and this week,” Hart said.</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a waiver last Friday
unfreezing emergency food assistance and earlier this week issued
another waiver unfreezing humanitarian assistance.</p>
<p>The top Democrat on the House Select Committee on Strategic
Competition with China on Thursday welcomed Rubio’s waivers but said
more had to be done.</p>
<p>“While periodic review of foreign assistance programs’ contribution
to U.S. national security is necessary, abruptly freezing any foreign
assistance directly cedes ground to our foremost adversary: the CCP,”
said Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, a Democrat from Illinois, in a
statement.</p>
<p>“At a time when the CCP is aggressively investing abroad, rerouting
supply chains and buying authoritarian favor, the United States must
double down on foreign assistance — not kneecap ourselves.”</p>

<h2 id="after-fires-los-angeles-gets-moonshot-moment-to-rebuild">After
fires, Los Angeles gets moonshot moment to rebuild</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>As Los Angeles recovers from its devastating wildfires, environmental
engineers, urban planners and natural disaster experts are casting
forward with visions of what could come next for neighborhoods that have
been reduced to ash and rubble.</p>
<p>Apartment buildings could spring up where strip malls and parking
lots once stood, with locals walking to ground-floor shops, offices and
cafes, European-style.</p>
<p>The city could “infill” vertically to add affordable housing in safer
downtown areas, rather than outwards with more single-family homes on
fire-prone hills.</p>
<p>Some blocks could be turned into buffer zones, where no building was
allowed. And the city’s trademark palm trees, which burn like Roman
candles, could be replaced with fire-resistant native trees.</p>
<p>These are some of the bold ideas academics have for Los Angeles as it
recovers from the Eaton and Palisades fires, which killed 28 people and
damaged or destroyed nearly 16,000 structures. Together, the blazes
charred 152 square kilometers — an area larger than Paris.</p>
<p>The city is far from rebuilding, with many people only now being
allowed back to their burned neighborhoods. When construction does
begin, few of the dozen experts Reuters spoke to expected their dream
plans to be adopted, citing factors ranging from lack of future
insurance coverage to political pressure to rebuild as before.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, experts in urban development, climate change and housing
said Los Angeles has a chance to think outside the box. Many also said
there should be no rush to rebuild. Instead, residents of Pacific
Palisades and Altadena should be afforded time to decide what their
future communities should look like and dream big.</p>
<p>“The biggest thing is how do we promote infill development in safer
areas,” said Emily Schlickman, assistant professor of landscape
architecture and environmental design at the University of California,
Davis, who suggests retreating from fire-prone peripheries.</p>
<p>Model cities</p>
<p>Los Angeles could learn from cities like Kobe, Japan, decimated by a
1995 earthquake, where officials imposed a two-month building
moratorium, said Columbia University’s Jeffrey Schlegelmilch.</p>
<p>“One of the most important things is to give yourself time to come up
with a robust solution,” said Schlegelmilch, director of the National
Center for Disaster Preparedness at the university’s climate school.</p>
<p>Then there are Houston’s Harris County and the city of San Antonio,
Texas, which bought up homes and properties to reduce future flood risk.
In the case of Harris County, authorities offered willing sellers
pre-flood market values for homes flooded during Hurricane Harvey in
2017 then demolished them.</p>
<p>Char Miller, a professor of environmental analysis and history at
Pomona College in Claremont, California, is among those who point to
Texas’ experience. While buying up properties in Pacific Palisades and
Altadena would be costly, Miller said, it would be possible with the
financial support of the city, county, state and possibly insurers.</p>
<p>Burned-out lots could be turned into what he envisions as fire buffer
zones. While disruptive to residents, Miller believes many would be
willing to use the money to relocate.</p>
<p>“People go, ‘Yeah, I don’t want to be in danger, and you’re buying me
out. Yeah, thank you,’” said Miller.</p>
<p>He despairs at city and state efforts to fast-track redevelopment in
areas that burned at a similar housing density.</p>
<p>“They just pulled the plug on the moonshot,” Miller said.</p>
<p>Alice Hill, a senior fellow for energy and the environment at the
Council on Foreign Relations think tank, wants to see more green spaces
like playing fields and bike paths between fire-risk areas and
homes.</p>
<p>“It simply is unsafe to rebuild communities where they were, and
retreating may be the wisest approach,” Hill wrote in a Jan. 14
essay.</p>
<p>A little more panache</p>
<p>Other experts advocate rebuilding the communities but in a way that
will resist fire.</p>
<p>“The only way to do this impactfully is to do it communitywide so if
the fire gets in, it has a hard time moving on,” said Michael Gollner, a
professor of mechanical engineering at University of California,
Berkeley.</p>
<p>Gollner tests prototype houses to see how they handle flames. Homes
can be made more fire-resistant by moving a wooden fence back five feet
(1.5 meters), surrounding a house with gravel and putting mesh over
attic vents to stop embers, he said.</p>
<p>Then there is landscaping, a contentious subject for some
homeowners.</p>
<p>“Who wants to cut down their juniper? But come a wildfire, your
juniper is a torch,” said Gollner.</p>
<p>Ecologists suggest Los Angelenos replace palms, junipers and
eucalyptus with trees that evolved to survive fire, such as California
oaks. The species has thick bark that resists flames and leathery leaves
that burn slowly.</p>
<p>“There are lots of people who are working to plant oaks, and I think
there’s some effort in giving them more panache,” said Alexandra
Syphard, a San Diego-based wildfire ecologist at the Conservation
Biology Institute.</p>
<p>For Hussam Mahmoud, a professor in civil and environmental
engineering at Colorado State University, the key is predicting the path
of future fires.</p>
<p>He has developed a model that calculates which buildings will burn,
allowing a community to fire-harden “super spreader” structures, rather
than fully adapt every house to resist wildfires.</p>
<p>Hardening a home begins with using metal or concrete for a roof and
fire-retardant materials on the sides. Multipane windows are less likely
to break from the heat and cause a home to burn from within.</p>
<p>“When the fires hit L.A., it’s clear that nobody knew what was going
to happen, which buildings were more likely to burn,” said Mahmoud.</p>

id="republican-senator-airs-concerns-about-supporting-rfk-jr-to-be-us-health-secretary">Republican
senator airs concerns about supporting RFK Jr to be US health
secretary</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — A key Republican senator on Thursday said he was
struggling with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s nomination by President Donald
Trump to run the top U.S. health agency, saying he had reservations
about the nominee’s “misleading arguments” on vaccines.   </p>
<p>“Your past of undermining confidence in vaccines with unfounded or
misleading arguments concerns me,” Republican Senator Bill Cassidy, a
physician from Louisiana, told Kennedy. </p>
<p>“I have been struggling with the nomination,” he said at the end of
Thursday’s Senate health committee hearing to consider Kennedy to run
the massive Department of Health and Human Services. </p>
<p>“Does a 70-year-old man … who spent decades criticizing vaccines and
who’s financially vested in finding fault with vaccines, can he change
his attitudes and approach now that he’ll have the most important
position influencing vaccine policy in the United States?” Cassidy
said. </p>
<p>The hearing was the second in two days for Kennedy during which he
squared off with Democrats and some Republicans over his past comments
on vaccines, abortion and COVID-19 among other topics. </p>
<p>The Finance Committee, which Kennedy appeared before on Wednesday,
has not yet said if it will send Kennedy’s nomination to the full
Republican-controlled Senate, which has not rejected any of Trump’s
nominees so far. </p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Finance Committee said a vote could
potentially take place next week, but that one had not yet been
scheduled.   </p>
<p>Cassidy, who sits on both committees, told Kennedy at the end of
Thursday’s hearing that Kennedy would be hearing from him over the
weekend, presumably regarding questions he has over the
nomination.   </p>
<p>Kennedy’s nomination could fail to move to the Senate for
consideration if all Democrats on the Finance Committee voted against
him and were joined by Cassidy.   </p>
<p>During wide-ranging questioning on Thursday, Kennedy spoke more
confidently than the day prior, adjusting the characterization of
previous statements, and saying he would support the U.S. children’s
vaccination schedule, research and development for bird flu, and
scientific data on vaccine safety. </p>
<p>Kennedy also said he would address rapidly increasing rates of
chronic disease. </p>
<p>“Our country is not going to be destroyed because we get the marginal
tax rate wrong. It is going to be destroyed if we get this issue wrong,”
he said of chronic diseases. “And I am in a unique position to be able
to stop this epidemic.” </p>
<p>He was asked about comments he has made over decades, including that
it was “highly likely” that Lyme disease was a military bioweapon. He
said he never said that it was definitively created in a biolab.   </p>
<p>He would not answer a question from Senator Bernie Sanders about
whether he agreed that vaccines do not cause autism. He also said he did
not know if the coronavirus vaccine saved millions of lives. </p>
<p>“If you come out unequivocally, ‘vaccines are safe, it does not cause
autism’ that would have an incredible impact,” Cassidy said.   </p>
<p>Kennedy has said vaccines are linked to autism, and he opposed state
and federal restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic. The
causes of autism are unclear, though theories that childhood vaccines
cause autism have been widely debunked and are contrary to scientific
evidence.   </p>
<p>Kennedy, who founded the anti-vaccine group Children’s Health
Defense, argued during both hearings that he was not against vaccines.
The group has sued in state and federal courts over vaccines. </p>
<p>“News reports and many in the hearing yesterday have claimed that I’m
anti-vaccine and anti-industry. Well, I’m neither,” Kennedy said,
repeating that his children are vaccinated.   </p>
<p>Thursday’s hearing in front of the Senate Committee on Health,
Education, Labor and Pensions is a courtesy hearing with no vote
involved. However, Republican Senators Cassidy, Lisa Murkowski and Susan
Collins sit on the committee, all of whom are seen as potential swing
votes against Kennedy. </p>
<p>Supporters of Kennedy wearing “Make America Healthy Again” hats
crowded around the committee hearing room on Thursday, while some
opposing his confirmation wore “Reject RFK Jr” stickers on their
shirts. </p>
<p>‘Catastrophic’ impacts   </p>
<p>If confirmed, Kennedy would run HHS, which oversees more than $3
trillion in healthcare spending, including at the Food and Drug
Administration and the agency in charge of the Medicare and Medicaid
health insurance programs covering nearly half of all Americans.   </p>
<p>He said he would follow Trump’s direction on abortion and would hire
for his department those who are against abortion rights.   </p>
<p>Kennedy also said gender-affirming care for children has
“catastrophic” impacts and that children are not equipped to make
judgments about receiving such care. He said he would rescind a
Biden-era rule that requires medical providers who receive federal
funding to offer gender-affirming care.   </p>
<p>Kennedy said farmers should be offered an off-ramp from chemically
intensive agriculture, and that illness in farm communities is
“undoubtedly” related to the use of pesticides. Some farm and food
groups have expressed concern about Kennedy’s positions on pesticides
and food additives.   </p>
<p>Opposition groups have ramped up their efforts to persuade Republican
senators to vote against Kennedy. Caroline Kennedy, another member of
the storied American political family, on Tuesday urged senators to vote
against her cousin’s nomination, calling him a predator with dangerous
views on health care. </p>
<p>Kennedy has also faced scrutiny over his ties to Wisner Baum, a law
firm specializing in pharmaceutical drug injury cases. He has an
arrangement to earn 10% of fees awarded in contingency cases he refers
to the firm, according to a letter Kennedy wrote to an HHS ethics
official released last week. </p>
<p>If confirmed, Kennedy would retain that financial interest in cases
that do not directly impact the U.S. government, the letter said.   </p>
<p>If his nomination goes to the full Senate, Kennedy would need the
support of at least 50 senators, which would allow Vice President JD
Vance to cast another tie-breaking vote to confirm his nomination.</p>

<p>
The nation’s largest electricity market expects to be delivering a lot
more power through the end of the next decade — even more than it
expected last year.
</p>
<p>
PJM Interconnection, which covers some or all of 13 states (and
Washington, D.C.) between Maryland and Illinois, released its
<a href="https://insidelines.pjm.com/2025-long-term-load-forecast-report-predicts-significant-increase-in-electricity-demand/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>latest
long-term forecast</u></a> last week, projecting that its summer peak
demand would climb by almost half, from 155,000 megawatts in 2025 to
around 230,000 in 2039.
</p>
<p>
The electricity market attributed the increased demand to “the
proliferation of data centers, electrification of buildings and
vehicles, and manufacturing,” and noted
(<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/pjm-interconnection-forecast-electricity-data-centers-evs" target="_self"><u>not
for the first time</u></a>) that the demand surge comes at the same time
many fossil fuel power plants are scheduled to close, especially coal
plants. Already, some natural gas and even some
<a href="https://www.spglobal.com/commodity-insights/en/news-research/latest-news/electric-power/110524-us-power-generators-pump-the-brakes-on-coal-plant-retirements#:~:text=Duke%20Energy%20Indiana%2C%20in%20an,and%20natural%20gas%20through%202038." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>coal
plants in PJM</u></a>
and<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/coal-gas-plant-retirements" target="_self">
</a>elsewhere that were
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/coal-gas-plant-retirements" target="_self"><u>scheduled
to close</u></a> have seen their retirement dates pushed out in order to
handle forecast electricity demand.
</p>
<p>
This is just the latest eye-popping projection of forthcoming
electricity demand from PJM and others — last year, PJM forecast
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/pjm-interconnection-forecast-electricity-data-centers-evs" target="_self"><u>summer
peak demand of about 180,000 megawatts in 2035</u></a>, a figure that
jumped to around 220,000 megawatts in this year’s forecast.
</p>
<p>
While summer is typically when grids are most taxed due to heavy demand
from air conditioning, as more of daily life gets electrified —
especially home heating — winter demand is forecast to rise, too. PJM
forecast that its winter peak demand would go from 139,000 megawatts in
2025, or 88% of the summer peak, to 210,000 megawatts in 2039, or 95% of
its summer peak demand forecast for that year.
</p>
<p>
Systems are designed to accommodate their peak, but winter poses special
challenges for grids. Namely, the electric grid can freeze, with natural
gas plants and pipelines posing a special risk in cold weather — not to
mention that it’s typically not a great time for solar production,
either.
</p>
<p>
Aftab Khan, PJM’s executive vice president for operations, planning, and
security, said in a statement Thursday that much of the recent demand
increase was due to data centers growing “exponentially” in PJM’s
territory.
</p>
<p>
The disparity between future demand and foreseeable available supply in
the short term has already led to a colossal increase in “capacity”
payments within PJM, where generators are paid to guarantee they’ll be
able to deliver power in a crunch. These payments tend to favor coal,
natural gas, and nuclear power plants, which can produce power
(hopefully) in all weather conditions whenever it’s needed, in a way
that variable energy generation such as wind and solar — even when
backed up by batteries — cannot as yet.
</p>
<p>
Prices at the latest capacity auction were high enough to induce
Calpine, the independent power company that operates dozens of natural
gas power plants and recently announced a merger with Constellation, the
owner of the Three Mile Island nuclear plant, to say it would
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/pjm-natural-gas" target="_self"><u>look
at building new power plants</u></a> in the territory.
</p>
<p>
The expected relentless increase in power demand, power capacity, and
presumably, profits for power companies, was thrown into doubt, however,
when the Chinese artificial intelligence company DeepSeek released a
large language model that appears to require far less power than state
of the art models developed by American companies such as OpenAI. While
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/deepseek-ge-vernova-oklo-constellation" target="_self"><u>the
biggest stock market victim</u></a> has been the chip designer Nvidia,
which has shed hundreds of billions of dollars of market capitalization
this week, a number of power companies including Constellation and
Vistra are down around 10%, after being some of the best stock market
performers in 2024.

id="us-ban-on-gun-sales-to-adults-under-age-21-is-unconstitutional-court-rules">US
ban on gun sales to adults under age 21 is unconstitutional, court
rules</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A decades-old U.S. government ban on federally licensed firearms
dealers selling handguns to adults under the age of 21 is
unconstitutional, a U.S. appeals court held on Thursday, citing recent
U.S. Supreme Court rulings expanding gun rights.</p>
<p>The ruling by the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
marked the first time a federal appeals court has held that the
prohibition violated the right to keep and bear arms enshrined in the
U.S. Constitution’s Second Amendment.</p>
<p>The appeals court had previously upheld that same ban in 2012. But
that was before the 6-3 conservative majority U.S. Supreme Court handed
down a landmark ruling in 2022 that established a new test for assessing
modern firearms laws.</p>
<p>In New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Association v. Bruen, the
Supreme Court held that modern gun restrictions were required to be
“consistent with this nation’s historical tradition of firearm
regulation.”</p>
<p>The federal ban on sales to people under 21 was first adopted by
Congress in 1968 as part of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets
Act.</p>
<p>A group of individuals between the ages of 18 and 20 along with the
gun rights groups the Firearms Policy Coalition and the Second Amendment
Foundation challenged the ban in 2020 and was appealing a lower-court
judge’s decision upholding the statutes.</p>
<p>U.S. Circuit Judge Edith Jones, writing for Thursday’s three-judge
panel, said that decision was wrong, as the statutes were
“unconstitutional in light of our Nation’s historic tradition of firearm
regulation.”</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Justice during Democratic former President Joe
Biden’s tenure had defended the ban. But Jones said it put forth “scant”
evidence to show that the gun rights of adults ages 18 to 20 were
similarly restricted during the nation’s founding era in the 1700s.</p>
<p>“Ultimately, the text of the Second Amendment includes
eighteen-to-twenty-year-old individuals among “the people” whose right
to keep and bear arms is protected,” wrote Jones, who like the other
panel members was appointed by a Republican president.</p>
<p>Brandon Combs, the Firearms Policy Coalition’s president, in a
statement called the ruling a victory against “an immoral and
unconstitutional age-based gun ban.”</p>
<p>The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

the Renewable Energy Industry Is Processing Trump 2.0</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-30, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p>
This week we’re talking to Carl Fleming, a renewables attorney with
McDermott Will &amp; Emory who was an advisor to Commerce Secretary Gina
Raimondo under the Biden administration. We chatted the morning after
the Trump administration attempted to freeze large swathes of federal
spending. My goal? To understand whether this chaos and uncertainty was
trickling down into the transition as we spoke. But Fleming had a sober
perspective and an important piece of wisdom: stay calm and remain on
course.
</p>
<p>
The following conversation has been lightly edited for clarity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>How are you seeing the private sector respond to all of this
news? </strong>
</p>
<p>
My view is, you can read a lot into what people publish in the EOs and
what’s written and what’s issued and you can sometimes read a good deal
into what hasn’t been issued and what hasn’t been said. In the executive
orders that got first issued in a flurry we saw a few that got pointed
directly at onshore wind, some on offshore wind, but solar and
standalone storage – as predicted – remained pretty much intact.
</p>
<p>
We were under the impression and we stood by it that we had the guidance
in hand, bankable guidance, from the IRS prior to the change in
administration and prior to any look-back window that people had been
transacting on over the past year at kind of a record pace. Standalone
storage has just had a breakout year. Solar continues to go, to continue
to be put on the grid. And we also have manufacturing of solar panels,
the domestic supply chain. This year we stood up is nowhere near what we
need to fulfill our requirements to get everything we need to do
domestically to fill our generation requirements [but] its a pretty
great step in the right direction. And those credits have been pretty
good to the economy and Republican states.
</p>
<p>
The way I’ve seen people react is, I’ve probably been busier than ever
the past two weeks, not only fielding questions like that but also for
tax credit transfers, all of the corporates we work with. We work in
both the buy and the sell side of all these credit transfers. We’re
working with a lot of solar module manufacturers to sell the credits
under the IRA. We’re working with a lot of buyers to purchase those
credits. And we’re working with the buyers and sellers under the
generation of these projects.
</p>
<p>
All of the buyers have come out and continued with their 2025 strategy
to buy more of these credits, if not more so. And all of the developers
we represent continue to produce more of these credits. So I haven’t
seen a hiccup or slowdown in actual transactions. If anything, I’ve seen
stuff pick up in the solar space and in the manufacturing space. I
continue to be very optimistic about those two fundamental parts of the
energy transition, because if you need to go be an energy superpower,
you wouldn’t want to turn off solar, turn off storage –
</p>
<p>
<strong>Is that argument that if you were trying to deal with “energy
security,” you wouldn’t turn off solar and storage – is that enough to
assuage uncertainty in the investor space? </strong>
</p>
<p>
I think it’s helpful. If you’re a private equity investor or you’re any
sort of lender or a developer, you’re probably not going to base your
whole model on the hopes that our energy security strategy syncs up with
what most people think it should look like. But when you layer it on top
of some of the fundamentals… I want to say that solar did not go away
eight years ago. When Trump first came in, we saw more renewables
deployed in his administration. At times, we saw more beneficial
guidance, issuance of tax guidance under that administration, than we
would hope for from some more favorable administrations.
</p>
<p>
The fact that the IRA has disproportionately benefited red states is
just a fact that can’t be overlooked. I met with a group of about two
dozen lawmakers a few weeks ago to talk about the IRA and there’s quite
a few of those folks in the room that say, <em><em>“Whatever we do, we
can’t dismantle the IRA.” </em></em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>But how has the chaos in the last week and a half impacted
investment in renewable energy, though? </strong>
</p>
<p>
I think the renewable energy industry is used to a lack of
predictability. It’s kind of a lawyer’s job, our team’s job, to help
folks mitigate risk [and] to see what potential pitfalls there may be
and to structure and draft around those.
</p>
<p>
You might see as things get more unpredictable, as folks go out to
investors to raise capital, you might see a little bit of tightening
around different portfolios or different types of companies based on
their pipelines or how they’re put together. But I think one investor’s
look on a project or pipeline may vary widely from another investor
who’s got a different project or pipeline. There’s a lot of capital out
there to be deployed. I think people are looking to invest.
</p>
<p>
I think you just need to partner the right developers with the right
investors.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Are you seeing any slowdown in solar investment though?
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I don’t see folks taking a hardline approach or stopping any time soon.
</p>
<p>
This is not an existential crisis while the ITC [investment tax credit]
and PTC [production tax credit] exist. It’s not even, could you go back
in time to unwind these credits. It’s moreso, going forward, what will
the IRA look like? Will there be additional technologies added to the
IRA? That’s possible to help stand up other technologies. Will the
runway for the credit, instead of it being unlimited for at least 10
years, will [it] be pared back a bit? There’s potential, but it’s
unlikely.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Okay last question and it’s a fun one: what was the last song
you listened to? </strong>
</p>
<p>
I’m not going to lie, I’m an Eagles fan. And I’m from Philly and a huge
Meek Mill fan. So “Uptown Vibes” by Meek Mill is in the car.

week attempted to freeze essentially all discretionary grant programs in
the federal government. A list
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-memo-climate-programs" target="_self">we
obtained</a> showed this would halt major energy programs and somehow
also involve targeting work on IRA tax credits.
</p>

Despite a court ruling that was supposed to lift the freeze, key climate
programs – like the EPA’s Solar For All effort – remain

<p>
<strong>1. Atlantic County, New Jersey – </strong>The Atlantic Shores
offshore wind project is on deathwatch.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Earlier today, Shell
<a href="https://www.workboat.com/wind/shell-withdraws-from-atlantic-shores-wind-project" target="_blank"><u>announced</u></a>
it would pull out of its 50-50 joint venture with EDF Renewables to
develop the Atlantic Shores offshore wind project off the coast of New
Jersey.<br/>
</li>
<li>
Atlantic Shores then sent us a statement unprompted, saying they’re
“committed” to developing New Jersey’s first offshore wind site.
</li>
<li>
“Business plans, projects, portfolio projections and scopes evolve over
time – and as expected for large, capital-intensive infrastructure
projects like ours, our shareholders have always prepared long-term
strategies that contemplate multiple scenarios that enable Atlantic
Shores to reach its full potential,” the statement read.
</li>
<li>
It continued: “While we can’t comment on the views of shareholders,
Atlantic Shores intends to continue progressing New Jersey’s first
offshore wind project and our portfolio in compliance with our
obligations to local, state and federal partners under existing leases
and relevant permits.”
</li>
<li>
As we previously
<a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/spotlight/trump-executive-order-wind" target="_self"><u>explained</u></a>,
we anticipate this project to face challenges to the legality of its
permits and leases, as
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/wind-executive-order-trump" target="_self"><u>previewed
by</u></a> the Trump administration.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>2. Waldo County, Maine –</strong> The Sears Island saga is
moving to the state legislature, as a cadre of lawmakers push to block
construction of a floating offshore wind turbine construction facility
there before Trump leaves office.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
As we previously explained, Sears Island – a bucolic recreation
destination off the coast of Maine – is the state’s favored spot for
building an assembly site for floating offshore wind turbines. Floating
offshore wind is preferred by some Maine politicians, including
Gov. Janet Mills, because it would reduce impacts to fisheries closer to
the shoreline.
</li>
<li>
Despite Trump’s edict blocking offshore wind, Maine has a pathway to
stay the course toward eventual development, because researchers have a
lease to test more floating offshore wind turbines in the Gulf of Maine.
There’s a world where development of a construction port on Sears Island
happens in tandem with that research.
</li>
<li>
However, we’re watching this risk to that pathway: a group of
Republicans in the state legislature – joined by a Democratic lawmaker
and a non-voting representative of the Passamaquoddy Tribe – have
<a href="https://legislature.maine.gov/backend/App/services/getDocument.aspx?documentId=108609" target="_blank"><u>introduced
a bill</u></a> to permanently turn Sears Island into a conservation
site, taking the island off the table for wind development.
</li>
<li>
Hindering offshore wind development overall might be the goal of the
bill, which was introduced the day after Trump restricted all new
offshore development Its lead author is state Rep. Reagan Paul, who has
also
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/15bH5GzbpX/" target="_blank"><u>called
on the governor</u></a> to stop all state spending on offshore wind.
Paul was in D.C. for Trump’s
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/r/15n8s96n6w/" target="_blank"><u>inauguration
celebrations</u></a>.
</li>
<li>
It’s unclear whether the legislation stands a chance at becoming law.
But it is clear some state Republicans are going to do what they can to
stop the Sears Island wind port, which will matter if the state tries to
get project permits under Trump.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>3. San Luis Obispo County, California – </strong>The Moss
Landing battery fire has sparked a new push for the state to slow
approvals for BESS development. Unlike Sears Island, the push is being
led by a Democratic lawmaker who has supported rapid climate action.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
State assemblywoman Dawn Addis – who represents Moss Landing and
communities impacted by the disaster – just introduced legislation that
would remove battery storage facilities from the California Energy
Commission’s opt-in certification program, effectively giving cities and
counties much more control over BESS siting.<br/>
</li>
<li>
“I absolutely have been a champion, believe that we live in a climate

<p class="drop-caps">
Solar energy so far is avoiding the Trump-era challenge posed to wind
energy. But it’s unclear the good times will continue, as chaos reigns
in Washington and threats loom on the horizon.
</p>
<p>
Last week, Trump issued a
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/renewables-permitting-pause" target="_self"><u>60-day
pause</u></a> on all permits for solar projects on federal lands. Many
solar projects are not sited on federal lands, so there’s little Trump
could do in the short term to stop those projects. But some utility
scale projects definitely <em><em>are</em></em> on federal lands in the
Southwest, most often in Nevada, where
<a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/spotlight/nevada-joe-lombardo-blm-solar" target="_self"><u>considerable
opposition exists</u></a> in rural, untouched pockets of the state.
Several sit in various stages of the permitting process. In fact, there
are over 12 gigawatts worth of challenged projects currently planned for
the state, according to Heatmap Pro’s database.
</p>
<p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p>
<p>
Developers and industry representatives I spoke with believe Trump will
lift this pause on permits and let the solar projects flow through the
pipeline. EDF Renewables, whose Bonanza solar farm was approaching the
end of the permitting process when Trump came into office, told me they
“have no reason to believe that the project should not be approved.”
Balanced Rock Power, the developer of the Samantha solar project in
Nevada which is in the early stages of permitting, told me the company
is “continuing to work closely with” agencies “to complete all the major
milestones on schedule.”
</p>
<p>
“President Trump has specifically said that he loves solar – and as
energy demand soars, we know that solar is the most efficient and
affordable way to add a lot of energy to the grid, fast,” Abigail Ross
Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association,
told me in a statement.
</p>
<p>
But there’s a quiet unease amongst some in the sector about whether
recent actions around permits and federal funding mean the next shoe to
drop is going to hit them.
</p>
<p>
Trump’s got complaints about solar and land use, including those he made
in that presidential debate immediately after the “big fan” comment.
There was also an interview with Fox News last week where he came out
against utility-scale solar projects. “You know what else people don’t
like,” Trump told
<a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/news/trump-pushes-for-more-oil-and-gas-says-u-s-can-supply-the-whole-world-with-energy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>host
Sean Hannity</u></a>. “Those massive solar fields built over land that
covers 10 miles by 10 miles. I mean, they’re ridiculous, the whole
thing.”
</p>
<p>
Brendan Bell, a top executive at asset manager Aligned Capital and a
former senior official in DOE’s loan programs office, told me the
biggest question in solar right now is “whether they can do anything to
stop it.”
</p>
<p>
“If you’re developing a project on BLM land, you’re probably putting
that on the backburner,” said Brendan Bell, a top executive at asset
manager Aligned Capital. Bell served as director of strategic
initiatives for the Energy Department’s Loan Programs Office under the
Obama administration. “But that’s not the only place we build solar
projects.”
</p>
<p>
Indeed, from a permitting perspective, it may prove quite tricky to
undermine solar projects. Even on BLM land. That’s because permitting
decisions and even indecision can be litigated. Rarely does the Bureau
of Land Management actually deny projects – of any fuel type – so a step
change against solar would require a wholescale change to how permitting
staff ordinarily operate.
</p>
<p>
The most serious threat, in my view, is actually whether the Trump
administration will take on the “protect farmland” mantle that activists
in some states have used to derail large-scale solar projects. Under the
Farmlands Protection Policy Act, the Agriculture Department is tasked
with minimizing how federal programs impact the conversion of farmland
to non-agricultural uses, attorney Bob Greenslade told me in an email.
Farmland impacts “may be relevant” now to renewable energy development
in any area with a federal nexus, including land use.
</p>
<p>
And there’s a nascent effort to strip tax credits from renewables
projects sited on farmland. On Tuesday, Republican congressman Tom
Tiffany of Wisconsin
<a href="https://www.hudsonstarobserver.com/news/rep-tom-tiffany-hosts-listening-session-on-xcel-energy-s-prospective-solar-farm/article_fd74445e-ddcb-11ef-9443-03a4ca9a882d.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>announced</u></a>
he would reintroduce legislation to disqualify renewables projects from
receiving tax benefits under the Inflation Reduction Act if their
project is on “prime farmland,” a term of art defined by the Agriculture
Department.
</p>
<p>
Mark Fowler, director of government affairs for Ameresco, told me that
he believes tax credits and access to federal funds will be a bigger
issue for solar than permitting in the immediate term, especially in
light of the (now lifted) Trump freeze on discretionary funds. Ameresco
is an integrator and developer of renewable energy projects. “The
biggest thing right now is uncertainty around the tax credits. The
discussion right now is they’re going to change in some form the IRA tax
credits. We don’t know what the changes are going to look like.”

<p class="drop-caps">
Since his re-election, President Trump has repeatedly threatened to
impose big tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico.
</p>
<p>
And in recent days, he’s made it clear: Yes, he really means <em><em>all
</em></em>imports.
</p>
<p>
“We don’t need them to make our cars, we make a lot of them. We don’t
need their lumber because we have our own forests,” he
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y725r90k5o" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>told</u></a>
Davos attendees last week. “We don’t need their oil and gas, we have
more than anybody.”
</p>
<p>
The president is mistaken about the American fossil fuel industry — at
least in its current structure. Even though the United States is the
world’s No. 1 producer of oil and natural gas, the industry really
does<em> </em>depend on oil imported from its neighbors, especially
Canada. If Trump makes good on his threats to tariff oil imports from
Canada and Mexico, then he will cost the American oil and gas industry
tens of billions of dollars while causing gasoline prices to rise across
much of the country.
</p>
<p>
That’s because not all petroleum is created equal. The type of crude
that oozes out of wells in Alberta and Saskatchewan is not identical to
what’s extracted by frackers in Texas and Oklahoma. But the types of
petroleum now produced in Canada and in America pair especially well
together — meaning that if the price of Canadian oil goes up, then
American refineries, as well as American consumers, will pay the price.
</p>
<p>
That could hurt the president’s ability to fulfill one of his core
promises. In his inaugural address, Trump promised to “rapidly bring
down costs and prices” in part by fighting “escalating energy costs.”
Levying tariffs on Canadian oil imports would likely raise energy
prices.
</p>
<p>
But it could have more complicated environmental effects. Western
Canadian petroleum has a higher carbon intensity than other crude oils,
and American climate activists fought last decade to keep it from
entering the United States. Trump, counterintuitively, could succeed
more thoroughly than they did.
</p>
<p>
To understand why, you have to know a little bit of chemistry — and a
bit of history, too.
</p>
<h3>
A brief digression
</h3>
<p>
We often talk about oil as an homogenous and fungible commodity, but
that’s not really true. In reality, oil and natural gas usually come out
of the ground as a slurry of hydrocarbons.
</p>
<p>
A hydrocarbon is a chain of hydrogen and carbon atoms bonded together.
Sometimes those chains are relatively short — as in methane, the major
component of natural gas — and sometimes they’re longer — as in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octane" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>octane</u></a>,
a liquid and a major component of gasoline. As the number of carbon
atoms keeps growing, the substance starts to get
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraffin_wax" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>waxier</u></a>
until the chains get
<a href="https://personal.ems.psu.edu/~radovic/coal_structure.gif" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>absolutely</u></a>
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-44045-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>enormous</u></a>
and become the kind of molecule you find in coal. Nitrogen, oxygen, and
sulfur atoms are sometimes jammed into the hydrocarbon chains too.
</p>
<p>
In other words, all fossil fuels exist on a spectrum — and crude oil, a
melange of hydrocarbons of different lengths and properties, occupies
the messy middle. Those properties can vary based on how and why in the
past a crude field formed. Petroleum engineers classify it along two
axes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Its <em><em>weight. </em></em>When oil has more short-chain
hydrocarbons, it flows more easily, and petroleum engineers talk about
it as being “light.” When oil has more long-chain hydrocarbons and is
more viscous, they say that it’s “heavy.”
</li>
<li>
Its <em><em>sulfur content. </em></em>Some hydrocarbon chains contain
sulfur atoms mixed in with the hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen. But sulfur
is generally a bad thing in oil: It produces toxic and corrosive
byproducts when refined, and burning sulfur-heavy fuels can lead to acid
rain. Engineers say that sulfur-rich crude is “sour,” while sulfur-light
crude is “sweet.”
</li>
</ul>
<p>
American fracking wells tend to produce light, sweet crude. The oil from
Alberta is heavy and sour.
</p>
<p>
Normally, heavy and sour oil trades at a discount compared to light and
sweet oil. That’s because the highest volume products that come out of a
refinery — gasoline or jet fuel, for instance — are made of short
hydrocarbons, not long ones. Light, sweet crudes are closer to the
finished product, and thus require less refining.
</p>
<p>
Yet heavy, sour crudes are crucial to the U.S. oil industry anyway.
American refiners use heavy crudes to bring down their input costs for
refined products such as gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel.
</p>
<p>
Why? That’s where the history comes in.
</p>
<h3>
North America is an integrated energy system
</h3>
<p>
Nearly two decades ago, as oil prices reached painful highs as global
demand outstripped supply, many refineries across the United States
began to invest in technologies that would let them break down heavier,
sour petroleum into something more commercially viable. They built
coking refineries, expensive pieces of equipment that use extreme heat
to break down long hydrocarbon chains into shorter ones. The cost of
such a refinery can
<a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-86884-0_3#:~:text=The%20investment%20cost%20of%20a,cost%20more%20than%20%246%20billion." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>exceed
$10 billion</u></a>. Many were purpose-built for breaking down the
sludgy, sour oil coming from Canada.
</p>
<p>
In the early 2010s, as the fracking revolution turned the United States
into an oil-drilling superpower, those coking refineries remained
important. They helped stretch the value out of the light, tight crude
coming out of fracking wells, Rory Johnston, an oil markets analyst and
the author of the Commodity Context newsletter, told me last week.
</p>
<p>
It does not make sense to use the coking refineries on oil from fracking
wells, because that oil is already largely composed of short-chain
hydrocarbons. But by breaking down Canadian oil in coking refineries,
and blending it with American oil, the industry can make a wider blend
of producers at a lower cost.
</p>
<p>
“Heavy crude’s cheaper, and they want to refine this into valuable end
products,” Johnston said in a separate conversation recorded this week
on Heatmap’s Shift Key podcast. “And so because of this, to just run
light crude through that, you would instantly render economically
worthless all of this very, very expensive equipment.”
</p>
<p>
Many of America’s refineries — especially those in the Midwest — are now
tuned specifically to process light fracking oil and heavy Canadian
sludge together, he said. What this means in practice is that the United
States exports as a finished product much of the crude oil that it
imports from Canada. Under the current situation, the U.S. earns more
money selling refined products <em><em>made </em></em>from Canadian
crude than it spends importing raw petroleum from Canada, Johnston
added.
</p>
<p>
Tariffs will collapse the price relationships that allow for that
mutually beneficial situation to persist. It will boost the cost of
Canadian oil by at least $5 a barrel on each side of the border, raising
pump prices by about 13 cents in the Midwest, Johnston told me.
</p>
<p>
That may not sound so bad for consumers. But it would be terrible for
refiners. “The total effect of Trump’s actions so far is to nuke the
economics of U.S. coking refineries. It’s truly magnificent,” he said.
“You couldn’t create a better scenario to destroy the economics of U.S.
coking refineries.”
</p>
<p>
If U.S. oil companies lose access to cheap Canadian oil, they will
struggle to replace it. That’s because the next best place to get heavy,
sour crude is
<a href="https://www.pmi.com.mx/Public/Paginas/Tipoproducto_En.aspx?IdSec=27&IdPag=128" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Mexico</u></a>
— and Mexican imports, too, would likely face 25% tariffs under most
scenarios where Canada is levied. The next places to get heavy, sour
crude are Venezuela (where the Trump administration wants to tighten
sanctions) and Colombia (where Trump nearly imposed tariffs last
weekend).
</p>
<p>
One reason Canadian oil is so cheap in the United States is that
companies have invested billions integrating the two countries’ oil
infrastructure. A network of pipelines and storage tanks bring millions
of barrels of oil from Canada down to the U.S. Gulf Coast every day. The
countries — and especially their fossil fuel industries — are
interdependent.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, only one pipeline system —
<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/bakx-tmx-pipeline-oil-wcs-1.6780054" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
Trans Mountain pipeline</u></a> — connects Alberta’s oil fields to the
Pacific coast.
</p>
<p>
If you begin to play out how each country might react to a tariff,
Johnston said, “you get into these completely absurd scenario
discussions,” Johnston said. “The result is everyone would be poorer in
that scenario.”
</p>
<p>
None other than the U.S. oil industry itself has opposed the tariffs.
</p>
<p>
“We import a lot of oil from both Mexico and Canada, and we refine it
here in the most sophisticated refinery system in the world,” Mike
Sommers, the CEO of the American Petroleum Institute,
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/api-seeks-to-shield-oil-from-trumps-tariffs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said</u></a>
at an event in Washington last week. “We’re going to continue to work
with the Trump administration on this so that they understand how
important it is that we continue these trade relationships.”
</p>
<p>
On Monday, <em><em>The Wall Street Journal </em></em>reported that some
Trump aides
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/americas/trump-aides-want-to-hit-mexico-canada-with-tariffs-before-talks-3ff27f14" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>are
eager to hit</u></a> Canada and Mexico with tariffs this weekend, even
though the president has yet to reopen talks — or even describe his
demands — for a reworked U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement.
Canadian and Mexican officials have said that they are not sure what
Trump actually wants in the talks.
</p>
<p>
One irony of this fracas is that the tariffs would have a more uncertain
environmental effect. Western Canadian crude is
<a href="https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/sites/default/files/classic/fuels/lcfs/crude-oil/2019_crude_average_ci_value_final.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>unusually
carbon-intensive</u></a> to extract and refine. If its price rose — or
if Canadian officials responded to tariffs in part by shutting down
production — then Trump could accidentally, if marginally, decrease
carbon emissions. American refineries might also respond to tariffs by
importing heavy, sour crude oil from abroad, essentially just shifting
production around the planet.
</p>
<p>
Still, it remains ridiculous that Trump, who has spent his first days in
the White House attacking a “Green New Deal” agenda that never actually
passed Congress, might succeed in raising the cost of oil consumption
and production in the U.S. where a decade of climate activism has
largely failed.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps that’s why many still doubt it would happen. On Wednesday
morning, President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/29/us/politics/mexico-president-sheinbaum-trump-tariffs.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said</u></a>
that she did not think Trump would ultimately impose sanctions on her
country. And even within the oil industry, tariffs on Canadian oil seem
unthinkable. A 25% tariff would whack the industry hardest, even though
it
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/business/energy-environment/oil-trump-drill-baby-drill.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has
allied itself</u></a> closely with Trump. Trump’s likely energy
secretary, Chris Wright, is the CEO of Liberty Energy, an oilfield
services company.
</p>
<p>
“A lot of the people I’m hearing on the Canadian side are saying, ‘Maybe
we should try to speak with these people around Trump. Maybe Wright or
[Trump’s energy czar Doug] Burgum understand what’s happening,’”
Johnston said.
</p>
<p>
But Trump has already made demands that strike the North American oil
industry as bizarre. At the same Davos meeting where he said the United
States didn’t need Canadian oil, Trump
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c17ewl98kgvo" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>demanded</u></a>
that OPEC and Saudi Arabia cut global oil prices so that global interest
rates could fall. Such a move would cut profits in the American oil
industry while hampering Trump’s goal of increasing U.S. oil production.
</p>
<p>
The irony that a Republican president would push off Canadian crude to
increase America’s reliance on OPEC is hard to comprehend, Johnston
said.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know that anyone has a great sense of where Trump’s true
philosophical anchor is,” he said, “other than that we are now getting a
clear picture that he views any and all trade deficits as a sin unto
themselves.”

disappointing Q4 results for 2024 yesterday, with revenue and earnings
per share both missing analysts expectations. Revenue came in at $25.71
billion, down 8% compared to the same period in 2023. Earnings per share
were $0.73, compared to projections of $0.77. Gross profit margin fell
to 13.6% year-over-year, less than the 16.2% forecast. Tesla’s stock
dipped on the news, but rebounded after CEO Elon Musk tried to make some
reassurances during the earnings call. He said Tesla planned to launch a
driverless ride-hailing service in Austin, Texas, in June, and expects
to begin producing the Cybercab robotaxi fleet in 2026. He talked up the
Optimus humanoid robot and the company’s AI and robotics investments.
And he said the company plans to start producing “more affordable
models” of its EVs in the first half of 2025. (Worth noting that the

decade, he didn’t show it, predicting that the next few years will be
“epic” for the company. “I see a path for Tesla being the most valuable
company in the world, by far, not even close,” he said. “There is a path
where Tesla is worth more than the next top five companies combined.”

“Tesla investors are fuelled by optimism around Full Self-Driving and
the upcoming affordable model, two key catalysts that could drive
Tesla’s next leg of growth,” said Hargreaves Lansdown’s Matt Britzman.
Others were less optimistic. “While the long-term narrative remains, the
fourth-quarter was a ‘back to earth’ moment for Tesla stock, which has
increasingly been disconnected from fundamentals,” cautioned

Have No Patience for Bureaucracy’: an Exit Interview With DOE’s Vanessa
Chan</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-30, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NjEwNjIxNC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTgwMDkzNDAzMX0.7dI20iuaWrDTgKABmlPgJgS917SjKacYPjcP2QF3iTk/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Vanessa Chan didn’t think she had the right temperament to work in
government. After a 13-year stint as a partner at McKinsey, six years as
a partner at the angel investment firm Robin Hood Ventures, and four
years at the University of Pennsylvania, most recently as professor of
practice in innovation and entrepreneurship, Chan considered herself to
be an impatient, get-it-done type — anathema to the traditionally slow,
procedurally complex work of governing.
</p>
<p>
But the
<a href="https://www.energy.senate.gov/services/files/32B4E9F4-F13A-44F6-A0CA-E10B3392D47A" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Energy
Act of 2020</u></a> had just formalized a new role within the Department
of Energy ideally suited to her skills: Chief Commercialization Officer,
which would also serve as the director of the Office of Technology
Transitions. Who would fill these dual roles was to be the decision of
then-incoming Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm, who found a kindred
spirit in Chan. Under her leadership, Chan told me, “I found someone
who’s less patient than me.”
</p>
<p>
In her four years at the DOE, the OTT’s annual budget — which she
referred to as “literally a rounding error to most people” — grew from
$12.6 million to $56.6 million. She leveraged it to its fullest extent,
establishing a precedent for the potential of this small but mighty
office. Chan spearheaded the
“<a href="https://liftoff.energy.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Pathways
to Commercial Liftoff</u></a>” reports that provide investors with a
path to market for the most important decarbonization technologies, and
announced over
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/technologytransitions/articles/doe-announces-over-41m-funding-deliver-clean-energy-solutions-market" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$41
million in funding</u></a> for 50 clean energy projects across all of
the nations 17 national labs through the
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/technologytransitions/technology-commercialization-fund" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Technology
Commercialization Fund</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
She also changed the way the DOE, national labs, venture capitalists,
and startups alike talk about getting ready for primetime with the
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/technologytransitions/adoption-readiness-levels-arl-framework" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Adoption
Readiness Level framework</u></a>, which put a much-needed focus on
factors such as economic viability, regulatory hurdles, and supply chain
constraints in the same way that the established
<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/somd/space-communications-navigation-program/technology-readiness-levels/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Technology
Readiness Levels</u></a>, pioneered by NASA, focus on the question of
whether a technology actually works.
</p>
<p>
Now Chan is back at the University of Pennsylvania in a new, extremely
apt role: the Inaugural Vice-Dean of Innovation and Entrepreneurship.
She’s weaving lessons learned from her time in the public and private
sectors into academia, where her goal is to help incorporate real-world
skills into the education of engineers and PhD scholars to prime them
for maximum impact upon graduation.
</p>
<p>
“It’s such a disservice if you invent something and it never sees the
light of day,” she told me. “So we need to make sure that isn’t
happening and we increase our odds of things making it to the market.”
</p>
<p>
Over two separate interviews, one before President Trump’s inauguration
and one after, I asked Chan how her work with the DOE has helped climate
technologies move from the lab to the market, the challenges that
remain, and what to keep an eye on in the new administration. Our
conversation has been edited for length and clarity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>How did you get recruited for this job? Was government work even
on your radar before?</strong>
</p>
<p>
No, this was never on my vision board. But the way in which this came
about was in 2016, there was a workshop that was being led by DOE on a
potential new foundation that was going to be focused on
commercialization. And one of my former clients told the person running
the workshop, <em><em>if you’re talking about technology
commercialization, you have to talk to Vanessa Chan</em></em>. And when
I was there, I just yapped off about all the issues that I see with
commercialization and what the federal government should be doing about
it. And I didn’t think anything of it.
</p>
<p>
And then fast forward to 2020, I get this cryptic email saying, “Hey,
the Biden-Harris administration is interested in you.” I spent all the
time during the interview [with the Biden-Harris team] going, “Here’s my
thing about commercialization, but I don’t think you guys want me,
because I’m someone who works really fast. I have no patience for
bureaucracy. I like to disrupt. I don’t like the status quo.” And
they’re like, that’s exactly what we want.
</p>
<p>
<strong>How did the DOE, and the OTT in particular, really undergo a
shift in the Biden administration?</strong>
</p>
<p>
Historically, DOE has been very focused on research and development. And
then when the [Bipartisan Infrastructure Law] and [Inflation Reduction
Act] got passed, now there was half-a-trillion dollars going towards
demonstration and deployment, and it became a lot more fun being the
chief commercialization officer.
</p>
<p>
The mantra that we’ve had is that the clean energy transition — and
quite frankly, commercialization — has to be private sector-led but
government-enabled. Because in the end, it’s the private sector that’s
actually commercializing. It’s not the government. DOD can buy stuff to
bring things to market, but DOE, we’re an enabler. And unless the
private sector has sustainable, viable economic models, nothing will
ever be commercialized.
</p>
<p>
<strong>How does your work intersect with other DOE agencies that are
focused on commercialization, like the Office of Clean Energy
Demonstrations and the Loan Programs Office?</strong>
</p>
<p>
I worked very closely with all of them. In particular, one of the things
that was really important to do was to get us on the same page of what
it actually means to deploy technologies. So I quarterbacked an effort
called
<a href="https://liftoff.energy.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
Pathways to Commercial Liftoff</u></a>, which OCED, LPO, and any program
office that was touching research, development, demonstration, and
deployment was a part of.
</p>
<p>
If we use hydrogen hubs as an example, OCED was given $8 billion towards
hydrogen. When we did the
<a href="https://liftoff.energy.gov/clean-hydrogen/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>hydrogen
liftoff report</u></a>, what we found was a few things. One is that
electrolyzer costs are super high, and so we have to be able to drive
those downward to make the unit economics work. We have an issue where
there is no midstream infrastructure. We also had a chicken-and-the egg,
which is pretty classic: No one wants to buy hydrogen until the supply
chain is stood up, [but] the supply chain doesn’t want to stand up until
they know they actually have offtake agreements.
</p>
<p>
What we did with OCED was, we took $7 billion to invest in
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/oced/regional-clean-hydrogen-hubs-0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>seven
hydrogen hubs</u></a> across the nation, and then we reserved $1 billion
to create an
<a href="https://h2di.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>offtake
demand mechanism</u></a>. And that’s the first time ever that the
federal government has actually focused on a demand activation program.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Have these liftoff reports been well received on both sides of
the aisle? Do you think they’ll continue to be referenced in the new
administration? </strong>
</p>
<p>
We were very, very, very fact-driven. There’s no policy by design,
because in the end it’s all about, what does it take for a technology to
make sense, for it to be in the market? So it’s not Republican or
Democratic, it’s just — what does the private sector have to do? I’m
really hoping they’re not seen as partisan and really more a synthesis
of what’s required for the private sector to actually scale technology.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What are some additional successes from your time at the
DOE?</strong>
</p>
<p>
An example program is
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/technologytransitions/articles/doe-awards-over-11-million-through-make-it-prize-boost-domestic" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>MAKE
IT</u></a>, which is Manufacturing of Advanced Key Energy Infrastructure
Technologies, which was a program that we created with OCED in order to
figure out ways in which we could try to help bolster manufacturing
across the nation. We also have this program called
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/technologytransitions/energy-program-innovation-clusters" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>EPIC</u></a>,
the Energy Program for Innovation Clusters, and we have funded over 80
incubators and accelerators across the nation, which are supporting
startups.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/technologytransitions/voucher-program" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>We’ve
created a voucher program</u></a> for startups and smaller organizations
— sometimes there’s very tactical things that they need help on, and
they need a small dollar amount, like a couple-hundred-thousand-dollars
to tackle that. We’re like, <em><em>Oh, you need to do techno-economic
analysis? We’re going to pair you with this organization here that can
do it</em></em>, and you don’t have to negotiate anything with them.
We’re just going to send them the money, you’re given a voucher, and you
just call them.
</p>
<p>
<strong>When I talk with venture capitalists, something that often comes
up is the difficulty of getting startups through the
</strong><a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/missing-middle" target="_self"><u><strong>so-called
Valley of Death</strong></u></a><strong>, the funding gap between a
company’s initial rounds and its commercial scale-up. How do you think
about the public sector’s role in helping companies through this
stage?</strong>
</p>
<p>
First of all, this private sector-led, government-enabled idea around
commercialization is really important. And the work we’ve done with
Liftoff and how we’ve gotten money out the door has really worked,
because for every dollar going out the door from DOE, we’ve seen $6
matching from the private sector. That in itself is showing that there’s
a way for the public sector to nudge the private sector to act.
</p>
<p>
What I’ll tell you, though, is that I think there needs to be a
wholesale reframe around how the private sector thinks about investments
and the returns that they want on them. Right now, we are in the Squid
Games, where everyone is first in line to be sixth or seventh, no one is
first in line to be first, second, or third, because they know the
person who is first, second, or third is going to lose money. So what we
need to do is figure out, how do we have the ecosystem crowdsource the
first 10 of a kind, so that we get to the tipping point where the unit
economics are working? How do we get the private sector to promise to
buy technologies when they’re not quite there? How do we in the public
sector help on the back end?
</p>
<p>
<strong>What are other primary barriers to commercialization that you
see?</strong>
</p>
<p>
Another big barrier is that the time clock for moving up the learning
curve and moving down the cost curve is quite long in some of these
hard-tech technologies. And so the challenge is, how do we convince CEOs
to make investments in something which is not going to benefit
<em><em>them</em></em>, but benefit a CEO two or three down the line?
Humans just don’t work that way, right? They’re all about earnings per
share and quarterly earning reports and so forth.
</p>
<p>
Now the challenge is, if we don’t do it, then countries like China are
going to do it. This is what happened in solar: We invented the
technology, but China was willing to take a loss in order to get up the
learning curve and drive down the cost curve, and we need to figure out
how to do the same.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Have you been in touch with anyone from the Trump
administration? Do you know who your successor will be? </strong>
</p>
<p>
No idea. My team didn’t even know who I was until day one. But what I’ll
tell you is that OTT has really strong bipartisan support because we’re
commercializing technologies, which is creating jobs, and I think
everyone understands the importance of this. Also for the [Foundation
for Energy Security and Innovation] I was very deliberate with the other
<em><em>ex officio</em></em> board members to make sure we had a
bipartisan board. We have 13 board members that we appointed here at
DOE, and I have representation from every single administration since
George H.W. Bush, including two Trump appointees.
</p>
<p>
I really do hope that whoever sits in my seat will reach out, and I left
a letter offering that, too. Hopefully they do give me a call because I
really want to wish them every success in the work that they’re doing.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What’s it like to be back at the University of Pennsylvania,
watching this new administration from a civilian perspective?</strong>
</p>
<p>
This was the best job ever, so I’m just sad in general to not be at the
Department of Energy because I really enjoyed the work that we were
doing there. A lot of the money from the BIL and IRA were used to
catalyze many, many red states. I am hopeful that people in power
recognize this and are going to do right by those counties. Because I
think, in the end, what we’re trying to do is really help with American
jobs and competitiveness.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Any thoughts on
</strong><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><strong>the
executive order</strong></u></a><strong> that’s frozen disbursement of
funds from BIL and IRA? </strong>
</p>
<p>
I don’t know, because I always think it’s not right to be on the outside
in, trying to figure out what different executive orders are trying to
say or not say. We all have to wait to see how these get executed upon.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What do you think people should be keeping an eye on to gauge
the impacts that these sweeping executive orders are having? </strong>
</p>
<p>
In my mind it’s really, is the private sector spooked? Are they going to
continue to invest the money that’s needed for these manufacturing
plants to continue and so forth? Because in the end, it’s the private
sector that actually is driving American competitiveness — the federal
government is a catalyst. And so I think what I’d be looking to is the
private sector. Are they stopping the momentum that we helped to
kickstart?

rights chief seeks $500 million in 2025, warning that lives are at
risk</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>GENEVA — The U.N. human rights chief appealed on Thursday for $500
million in funding for 2025 to support its work, such as investigating
human rights abuses around the world from Syria to Sudan, warning that
lives hang in the balance.</p>
<p>The U.N. human rights office has been grappling with chronic funding
shortages that some worry could be exacerbated by cuts to U.S. foreign
aid by President Donald Trump. The annual appeal is for funds beyond the
allocated U.N. funds from member states’ fees, which make up just a
fraction of the office’s needs.</p>
<p>“In 2025, we expect no let-up in major challenges to human rights,”
High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk told member states in a
speech at the U.N. in Geneva.</p>
<p>“I am very concerned that if we do not reach our funding targets in
2025, we will leave people … to struggle and possibly fail, without
adequate support,” he said.</p>
<p>He said any shortfall would mean more people remain in illegal
detention; that governments are allowed to continue with discriminatory
policies; violations may go undocumented; and human rights defenders
could lose protection.</p>
<p>“In short, lives are at stake,” Turk said.</p>
<p>The human rights office gets about 5% of the regular U.N. budget, but
the majority of its funding comes voluntarily in response to its annual
appeal announced on Thursday.</p>
<p>Western states give the most, with the United States donating $35
million last year or about 15% of the total received in 2024, followed
by the European Commission, U.N. data showed. Still, the office received
only about half of the $500 million it sought last year.</p>

<p>date: 2025-01-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee is set to question former
Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard as she seeks confirmation to become the
nation’s director of national intelligence.</p>
<p>Gabbard is expected to face questions about her 2017 visit to Syria,
when during her time in Congress she met with then-President Bashar
al-Assad.</p>
<p>At the time she faced criticism for what opponents of the trip said
was legitimizing Assad amid the Syrian civil war.</p>
<p>The military veteran, who ran for the Democratic Party nomination in
the 2020 presidential election, was a critic of the Biden
administration’s support for Ukraine, including questioning sending aid
for Ukrainian troops instead of using resources for domestic issues.</p>
<p>“This war and suffering could have easily been avoided if Biden
Admin/NATO had simply acknowledged Russia’s legitimate security
concerns,” Gabbard said as Russia began its invasion of Ukraine in
2022.</p>
<p>In announcing her nomination, U.S. President Donald Trump said
Gabbard would “bring the fearless spirit that has defined her
illustrious career to our Intelligence Community, championing our
Constitutional Rights, and security Peace through Strength.”</p>
<p>If approved by a simple majority in the Senate, Gabbard would oversee
18 U.S. intelligence agencies.</p>
<p>Trump’s Republican Party holds a 53-47 Senate majority.</p>

id="microsoft-meta-ceos-defend-hefty-ai-spending-after-deepseek-stuns-tech-world">Microsoft,
Meta CEOs defend hefty AI spending after DeepSeek stuns tech world</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Days after Chinese upstart DeepSeek revealed a breakthrough in cheap
AI computing that shook the U.S. technology industry, the chief
executives of Microsoft and Meta defended massive spending that they
said was key to staying competitive in the new field.</p>
<p>DeepSeek’s quick progress has stirred doubts about the lead America
has in AI with models that it claims can match or even outperform
Western rivals at a fraction of the cost, but the U.S. executives said
on Wednesday that building huge computer networks was necessary to serve
growing corporate needs.</p>
<p>“Investing ‘very heavily’ in capital expenditure and infrastructure
is going to be a strategic advantage over time,” Meta CEO Mark
Zuckerberg said on a post-earnings call.</p>
<p>Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, said the spending was needed to
overcome the capacity constraints that have hampered the technology
giant’s ability to capitalize on AI.</p>
<p>“As AI becomes more efficient and accessible, we will see
exponentially more demand,” he said on a call with analysts.</p>
<p>Microsoft has earmarked $80 billion for AI in its current fiscal
year, while Meta has pledged as much as $65 billion towards the
technology.</p>
<p>That is a far cry from the roughly $6 million DeepSeek said it has
spent to develop its AI model. U.S. tech executives and Wall Street
analysts say that reflects the amount spent on computing power, rather
than all development costs.</p>
<p>Still, some investors seem to be losing patience with the hefty
spending and lack of big payoffs.</p>
<p>Shares of Microsoft — widely seen as a front runner in the AI race
because of its tie to industry leader OpenAI - were down 5% in extended
trading after the company said that growth in its Azure cloud business
in the current quarter would fall short of estimates.</p>
<p>“We really want to start to see a clear road map to what that
monetization model looks like for all of the capital that’s been
invested,” said Brian Mulberry, portfolio manager at Zacks Investment
Management, which holds shares in Microsoft.</p>
<p>Meta, meanwhile, sent mixed signals about how its bets on AI-powered
tools were paying off, with a strong fourth quarter but a lackluster
sales forecast for the current period.</p>
<p>“With these huge expenses, they need to turn the spigot on in terms
of revenue generated, but I think this week was a wake-up call for the
U.S.” said Futurum Group analyst Daniel Newman.</p>
<p>“For AI right now, there’s too much capital expenditure, not enough
consumption.”</p>
<p>There are some signs though that executives are moving to change
that.</p>
<p>Microsoft CFO Amy Hood said the company’s capital spending in the
current quarter and the next would remain around the $22.6 billion level
seen in the second quarter.</p>
<p>“In fiscal 2026, we expect to continue to invest against strong
demand signals. However, the growth rate will be lower than fiscal 2025
(which ends in June),” she said.</p>

id="state-department-says-trump-froze-foreign-aid-to-root-out-waste">State
Department says Trump froze foreign aid to ‘root out waste’</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The State Department on Wednesday sought to clarify
President Donald Trump’s order to freeze and review foreign development
aid after the top U.S. diplomat blunted some of the chaos that ensued
with an emergency order that could shield the world’s largest HIV
program from the 90-day funding freeze.   </p>
<p>At the White House, Trump said his pauses to foreign and domestic
funding are part of his administration’s effort to root out “tremendous
waste and fraud and abuse.” </p>
<p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s late-Tuesday waiver exempts
humanitarian aid, which he classifies as “life-saving medicine, medical
services, food, shelter, and subsistence assistance, as well as supplies
and reasonable administrative costs as necessary to deliver such
assistance.”  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The United Nations’ AIDS program welcomed the news, emphasizing the
value of the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR,
which serves 20 million people in 55 countries.  </p>
<p>“UNAIDS welcomes this waiver from the U.S. government, which ensures
that millions of people living with HIV can continue to receive
life-saving HIV medication during the assessment of U.S. foreign
development assistance,” said Executive Director Winnie Byanyima. “This
urgent decision recognizes PEPFAR’s critical role in the AIDS response
and restores hope to people living with HIV.” </p>
<p>‘Blocking woke programs’</p>
<p>In a Wednesday memo sent to journalists, the State Department
explained its rationale for the freeze during the review and lauded
early cost cuts, saying that “even at this early stage, over
$1,000,000,000 in spending not aligned with an America First agenda has
been prevented.”  </p>
<p>The U.S. spent about $70 billion in foreign aid in fiscal year 2023,
the most recent data available. </p>
<p>“We are rooting out waste,” the memo said. “We are blocking woke
programs. And we are exposing activities that run contrary to our
national interests. None of this would be possible if these programs
remained on autopilot.”  </p>
<p>The president, who said Wednesday at the White House that he “could
stand here all day” and give examples of wasted fraud and abuse in the
U.S. government, highlighted a few. </p>
<p>“We identified and stopped $50 million being sent to Gaza to buy
condoms for Hamas,” he said. “Fifty million. And you know what’s
happened to them? They’ve used them as a method of making bombs. How
about that?”   </p>
<p>The State Department echoed this, saying in a statement, “Without the
pause, U.S. taxpayers would have provided condoms [and other
contraceptive services] in Gaza, climate justice marketing services in
Gabon, clean energy programs for women in Fiji, gender development
programs in D.C., family planning throughout Latin America, sex
education and pro-abortion programs for young girls globally, and much
more. These types of programs do not make America stronger, safer or
more prosperous.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>A day earlier, the State Department sent a memo citing examples of
unworthy projects, including $102 million to fund humanitarian aid
nonprofit International Medical Corps’ work in war-battered Gaza.  </p>
<p>A USAID report says the agency delivered about $7 million worth of
male condoms and about $1 million in female condoms in the 2023 fiscal
year. In total, the agency said it disbursed nearly 138 million male
condoms and 1.7 million female condoms worldwide. </p>
<p>Under USAID, the main administrator for U.S. foreign development
funds, the bulk of contraceptive items were delivered to African
countries, according to the report. Jordan was the only country in the
Middle East to receive a shipment, which consisted of injectable and
oral contraceptives valued at $45,680.  </p>
<p>‘Dramatic overreach’</p>
<p>At the U.S. Capitol, lawmakers not only affirmed the need for
accountability but also emphasized that Congress, not the White House,
decides how U.S. taxpayer money is spent.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I think it’s appropriate to have a review,” said Senator Kevin
Cramer, a North Dakota Republican.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“It would be my hope, however, that the aid can be reinstated and
flow to Ukraine,” Cramer said. “And then we’ll see in the next
appropriation cycle whether or not Congress still has the will to
continue that aid.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“This is dramatic overreach by the White House, by the president,”
said Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, a Democrat. “It’s unprecedented,
uncalled for. This is money that we have appropriated in our role as
members of the Senate and the House.”</p>

survivors after regional jet, US military helicopter collide at
Washington airport</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Dozens of people were feared dead Thursday after a passenger jet and
a U.S. military helicopter collided as the jet approached to land at
Ronald Reagan National Airport near Washington.</p>
<p>Emergency crews including boats and divers worked through the night
in the murky, frigid water of the Potomac River adjacent to the airport
where the wreckage fell after the collision around 9 p.m. Wednesday.</p>
<p>Officials said three U.S. Army soldiers were on the helicopter, which
was conducting a training flight. American Airlines, which operated the
flight traveling from Wichita, Kansas, to Washington, said in a
statement there were 60 passengers and four crew members on the
plane.</p>
<p>Authorities at an early Thursday briefing with reporters did not
confirm any deaths from the crash, saying the focus at that time was on
a rescue operation.</p>
<p>When asked if there were any survivors, Washington Fire Chief John
Donnelly said, “We don’t know yet, but we’re working.”</p>
<p>Donnelly said crews involving about 300 responders were working in
dark, difficult conditions, with frigid waters about 2.5 meters deep in
the areas where the wreckage was located.</p>
<p>U.S. Senator Roger Marshall of Kansas told the briefing, “We mourn
with the families that lost loved ones.”</p>
<p>“All those lives are so valuable, and it is such a tragedy that we
lost them,” Marshall said.</p>
<p>U.S. Figure Skating said several members of its community, including
athletes, coaches and family members, were among the passengers on the
plane.</p>
<p>“We are devastated by this unspeakable tragedy and hold the victims’
families closely in our hearts,” the organization said.</p>
<p>The Kremlin and Russian media said Russian figure skaters, including
world champion couple Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov, were on the
plane.</p>
<p>“It’s bad news today from Washington. We are sorry and send our
condolences to families and friends,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov
told reporters.</p>
<p>Video of the crash captured from a camera at the nearby Kennedy
Center shows two sets of lights converging before a fireball erupts.
Data from the plane showed it was at an altitude of about 120 meters at
the time of the collision.</p>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump said on his Truth Social platform, “What
a terrible night this has been.”</p>
<p>“It is a CLEAR NIGHT, the lights on the plane were blazing, why
didn’t the helicopter go up or down, or turn. Why didn’t the control
tower tell the helicopter what to do instead of asking if they saw the
plane,” Trump said. “This is a bad situation that looks like it should
have been prevented. NOT GOOD!!!”</p>
<p>U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called the situation “absolutely
tragic.”</p>
<p>“Search and rescue efforts still ongoing. Prayers for all impacted
souls, and their families,” Hegseth said on X.</p>
<p>American Airlines CEO Robert Isom said he and a team from the company
were traveling to Washington to provide assistance.</p>
<p>“This is a difficult day for all of us at American airlines and our
efforts now are focused entirely now on the needs of our passengers,
crew members, partners, first responders, along with their families and
loved ones,” Isom said in a video statement.</p>
<p>The last fatal U.S. passenger plane crash happened in 2009 in
Buffalo, New York.</p>

Federal Reserve holds rates steady, sees inflation as ‘elevated’</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left its benchmark interest rate
unchanged Wednesday after cutting it three times in a row last year, a
sign of a more cautious approach as the Fed seeks to gauge where
inflation is headed and what policies President Donald Trump may
pursue.</p>
<p>In a statement, the Fed said the job market is “solid,” and noted
that the unemployment rate “has stabilized at a low level in recent
months.” The Fed also appeared to toughen its assessment of inflation,
saying that it “remains somewhat elevated.” Both a healthier job market
and more stubborn inflation typically would imply fewer Fed rate cuts in
the coming months.</p>
<p>In a news conference Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell
largely deflected questions about recent comments from Trump, including
one from last week, when the president said he would lower oil prices
and then “demand” lower rates. He also said he would speak with Powell
about it.</p>
<p>“I’m not going to have any response or comment on whatever the
president said,” Powell said. Asked if Trump had communicated his desire
for lower rates directly to Powell, the Fed chair said he had “no
contact.”</p>
<p>Regarding the Fed’s key rate, Powell conveyed a more deliberate
approach, noting that the economy is mostly healthy — the unemployment
rate is a low 4.1% and growth topped 3% at an annual rate in the
fall.</p>
<p>“With … the economy remaining strong, we do not need to be in a hurry
to adjust our policy stance,” Powell said.</p>
<p>Asked about the potential impact of the sharp policy changes Trump
has proposed regarding tariffs, immigration, tax cuts and deregulation,
Powell said Fed policymakers are “waiting to see which policies are
enacted.”</p>
<p>“We don’t know what will happen,” he added. “We need to let those
policies be articulated before we can even begin to make a plausible
assessment of what their implications for the economy will be.”</p>
<p>Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide Financial, said
Powell’s comments suggest the Fed won’t cut rates again until the middle
of this year.</p>
<p>“We are all in wait-and-see mode, including the Fed,” she said.</p>
<p>The Fed reduced its rate last year to 4.3% from 5.3%, in part out of
concern that the job market was weakening. Hiring had slowed in the
summer and the unemployment rate ticked up, leading Fed officials to
approve an outsized half-point cut in September. Yet hiring rebounded
last month and the unemployment rate declined slightly, to a low
4.1%.</p>
<p>Powell has said it is harder to gauge where inflation is headed, in
part because of increased uncertainty around what policies Trump will
adopt and how quickly they will affect the economy. Higher tariffs and
tax cuts could push inflation higher, while deregulation could possibly
reduce it.</p>
<p>The Fed typically keeps interest rates high to slow borrowing and
spending and cool inflation.</p>
<p>In December, Fed officials signaled they may reduce their rate just
twice more this year. Goldman Sachs economists believe those cuts won’t
happen until June and December.</p>
<p>In November, inflation was just 2.4%, according to the Fed’s
preferred measure, not far from its 2% target. But excluding the
volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose a more painful
2.8% from a year earlier. The Fed pays close attention to core prices
because they are often a better guide to inflation’s future path.</p>
<p>Powell said the Fed wants to see “real progress on inflation or …
some weakness in the labor market before we consider” making further
cuts.</p>
<p>In a post to his Truth Social account late Wednesday, Trump
criticized the Fed for failing to curtail inflation, saying he would do
so by “unleashing American Energy production, slashing Regulation,
rebalancing international Trade, and reigniting American
Manufacturing.”</p>
<p>During the news conference, Powell was also asked about Trump’s
executive orders intended to limit diversity, equity and inclusion
programs, which Powell has previously backed.</p>
<p>“As has been our practice over many administrations, we are working
to align our policies with the executive orders as appropriate and
consistent with applicable law,” he said.</p>

id="trump-says-he-will-detain-undocumented-migrants-at-guantanamo-bay">Trump
says he will detain undocumented migrants at Guantanamo Bay</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>white house — U.S. President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he
would sign an executive action directing his administration to prepare
to detain undocumented migrants at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.</p>
<p>The U.S. detention facility is known mostly for housing military
prisoners and terror suspects, including those involved in the 9/11
attacks and members of the Taliban.</p>
<p>His order will instruct the Defense and Homeland Security departments
to prepare the U.S. naval base to hold 30,000 migrants, Trump said.</p>
<p>“Some of them are so bad we don’t even trust the countries to hold
them because we don’t want them coming back. So we’re going to send them
out to Guantanamo,” Trump added. “This will double our capacity
immediately. And tough, it’s a tough place to get out of.”</p>
<p>Trump made the announcement during a White House event during which
he signed the Laken Riley Act into law. It was the first legislation
he’d signed in his second term. The bill, named after a 22-year-old
nursing student who was murdered last year by an undocumented Venezuelan
immigrant, aims to expand the federal government’s mandate to detain
immigrants who are in the country illegally.</p>
<p>It’s unclear how the administration proposes to do this. Asked by
reporters, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said this was
something the White House was “working on, to use resources that we
currently have there at Guantanamo Bay.”</p>
<p>“We’ll go through the process,” she said, adding that the
administration was working with lawmakers to fund it. She offered no
estimate of the cost.</p>
<p>A White House official, speaking on background, a method often used
by U.S. officials to remain anonymous, told VOA that Trump had signed a
presidential memorandum regarding housing migrants at Guantanamo.</p>
<p>Presidential memoranda are less formal than executive orders. For
example, they do not have to be submitted to the Federal Register for
publication.</p>
<p>Late Wednesday, the White House published the executive
memorandum.</p>
<p>Trump’s border czar, Tom Homan, said Wednesday that U.S. Coast Guard
personnel already tasked to intercept illegal migrants at sea “can take
them straight to Guantanamo Bay.”</p>
<p>Homan told reporters that migrants had been housed there before.</p>
<p>“So we’re just going to expand upon the existing migrant center
logistics to work for that,” he said.</p>
<p>According to a September 2024 report from the International Refugee
Assistance Project, the U.S. has for decades detained migrants
intercepted at sea in the Migrant Operations Center at Guantanamo Bay
under prisonlike conditions.</p>
<p>IRAP and other immigration rights advocates have called for the
immediate closure of the migrant center. The organization also called on
Congress to investigate alleged human rights abuses at the facility and
called for the end of migrant detention operations everywhere.</p>
<p>Later Wednesday, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called
Guantanamo Bay the “perfect place” for criminal migrants. Hegseth told
Fox News that Guantanamo Bay could also temporarily hold other
undocumented immigrants while they’re waiting to be sent back to their
home countries.</p>
<p>“It’s folks who maybe are in transit to their home country or a safe
harbor country, and it’s taking a little time to move with that
processing of the paperwork,” he said, adding, “Better they be held at a
safe location, like Guantanamo Bay, which is meant and built for
migrants, meant and built to sustain that away from the American
people.”</p>
<p>According to media reports, Immigration and Customs Enforcement
averaged 710 arrests per day from Thursday through Monday, more than
double the daily average of 311 recorded in the 12-month period through
September under President Joe Biden.</p>
<p>If ICE officers continue with these detentions, it would exceed the
agency’s previous record set during President Barack Obama’s
administration in 2013, when daily arrests averaged 636.</p>
<p>The Trump administration has intensified deportations, with ICE
regularly updating arrest figures. The swift removals have sometimes
created challenges in determining where to send deportees, especially
when certain countries refuse to accept them.</p>
<p>Closing Guantanamo</p>
<p>Democratic administrations under Obama and Biden had sought to close
the notorious detention camp. It was built by the George W. Bush
administration in the Guantanamo Bay U.S. naval base facility in 2002
following the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan that began shortly after the
9/11 attacks of 2001.</p>
<p>Rights groups say that Guantanamo is a symbol of U.S. disregard for
the rule of law, as many detainees were held there without charge or
trial.</p>
<p>Sue Hendrickson, president and CEO of Human Rights First, said in a
statement that sending migrants to Guantanamo would create a human
rights catastrophe.</p>
<p>“Housing accused terrorists at Guantanamo has been a debacle. For the
past 20 years, the U.S. government has locked up people it never even
accused of taking action against the United States while continually
failing to try those credibly charged with serious crimes,” she
wrote.</p>
<p>“The Trump administration may find the symbolism of sending migrants
to Guantanamo darkly appealing; its practical result would be more
injustice, waste and self-inflicted loss of credibility,” Hendrickson
added.</p>
<p>At its height during the Global War on Terror, the detention facility
held about 680 prisoners. According to the Pentagon, as of January 6,
there were just 15 detainees at the facility.</p>
<p>Before being used to detain terror suspects, the U.S. naval facility
was also used to house migrants from Cuba and Haiti in the early 1990s,
per the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.</p>
<p>“At one point in late 1994, the migrant population of the naval
station approached 45,000,” a CRS report dated August 2022 said. The
report noted the last of the migrants had left by the end of January
1996.</p>

id="former-us-senator-menendez-gets-11-years-in-prison-for-bribes-acting-as-agent-of-egypt">Former
US Senator Menendez gets 11 years in prison for bribes, acting as agent
of Egypt</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Former U.S. Senator Bob Menendez was sentenced Wednesday
to 11 years in prison for accepting bribes of gold and cash and acting
as an agent of Egypt — crimes his own lawyer said earned him the
nickname “Gold Bar Bob.” </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Sidney H. Stein announced the sentence after the
Democrat tearfully addressed the judge, saying he’d lost everything he
cared about, except for his family. </p>
<p>“You were successful, powerful, you stood at the apex of our
political system,” the judge said. ”Somewhere along the way, and I don’t
know when it was, you lost your way and working for the public good
became working for your good.” </p>
<p>Menendez’s actions, the judge said, feeds the cynicism of
voters. </p>
<p>“What’s been the result?” he said, noting a lengthy investigation of
a five-year crime. “You lost your senate seat. You lost your
chairmanship and you lost your good name.” </p>
<p>Menendez, 71, who tearfully told the judge in court that he was
chastened, was defiant when he stepped before cameras at a bank of
microphones outside the Manhattan courthouse, saying: “I am
innocent.” </p>
<p>He then railed against the judicial system and aligned himself with
President Donald Trump’s recent criticisms of the judicial system,
particularly in New York City. </p>
<p>“President Trump is right. This process is political and it’s
corrupted to the core. I hope President Trump cleans up the cesspool and
restores the integrity to the system,” he said, reading from a sheet of
paper and calling himself the victim of “the Wild West of political
prosecutions.” </p>
<p>Prosecutors had requested a 15-year prison term for Menendez, who was
convicted of multiple charges including acting as an agent for Egypt for
selling his once-considerable clout in Washington for bribes worth
hundreds of thousands of dollars. </p>
<p>Menendez: I’ve done more good than bad</p>
<p>Given a chance to speak in court, Menendez broke down several times
as he described his accomplishments. </p>
<p>“You really don’t know the man you are about to sentence,” Menendez
told Stein as he stood before him with his hands in his pockets, except
when he wiped his face several times with a tissue. </p>
<p>“Your honor, I am far from a perfect man. I have made more than my
share of mistakes and bad decisions,” he added. “I’ve done far more good
than bad. I ask you, your honor, to judge me in that context.” </p>
<p>Attorney Adam Fee told Stein to give Menendez credit for a “lifetime
of extraordinary public service and personal sacrifices.” </p>
<p>“Despite his decades of service, he is now known more widely as Gold
Bar Bob,” Fee said. </p>
<p>Menendez’s lawyers had said prior to the sentencing that their client
deserves less than two years in prison, describing how the son of Cuban
immigrants rose from poverty to become “the epitome of the American
Dream” before his conviction had “rendered him a national
punchline.” </p>
<p>He’d beaten a prosecution once before. </p>
<p>In 2015, he was charged with selling his influence to a wealthy
Florida eye doctor and entrepreneur who prosecutors said lavished him
with luxury vacations and campaign contributions. But the jury in that
case couldn’t reach a unanimous verdict. Federal prosecutors dropped the
case rather than put him on trial again. </p>
<p>Businessmen sentenced</p>
<p>Before sentencing Menendez, Stein sentenced two men convicted of
bribing Menendez, giving Fred Daibes, a real estate developer, a
seven-year prison term and Wael Hana, an entrepreneur, eight years
behind bars. </p>
<p>Prior to the announcement of his sentence, Daibes, 67, tearfully told
Stein the jury verdict had left him “borderline suicidal,” and requested
leniency so that he could care for his 30-year-old autistic son. </p>
<p>Hana told the judge, “I am an innocent man.” </p>
<p>A third businessman pleaded guilty and testified against Menendez at
a trial last year. </p>
<p>Menendez resigned from the Senate after his conviction last year,
though he lost much of his power in fall 2023 when the charges against
him were revealed and he was forced to surrender his powerful post as
chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. </p>
<p>Wife faces trial</p>
<p>The trial traced Menendez’s dealings with Egyptian officials and his
quest to aid three men who showered him with lucrative gifts found
during a 2022 raid on the Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, home he shared
with his wife, Nadine. His wife faces a March trial on many of the same
charges as her husband. </p>
<p>FBI agents who searched the house found $480,000, some of it stuffed
inside boots and the pockets of clothing hung in the couple’s closets.
They also seized gold bars worth an estimated $150,000. </p>
<p>Prosecutors said Menendez had “put his high office up for sale in
exchange for this hoard of bribes,” including by serving Egypt’s
interests as he worked to protect a meat certification monopoly Hana had
established with the Egyptian government. </p>
<p>Among other things, Menendez provided Egyptian officials with
information about the staff at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo and ghostwrote
a letter to fellow senators encouraging them to lift a hold on $300
million in military aid to Egypt. </p>
<p>Prosecutors said that for other bribes, Menendez attempted to
persuade a federal prosecutor in New Jersey to go easy on Daibes, a
politically influential real estate developer accused of bank
fraud. </p>
<p>And at the trial, another businessman, Jose Uribe, testified that he
helped Nadine Menendez get a Mercedes-Benz convertible after the senator
sought to pressure state prosecutors to drop criminal probes of his
associates. </p>
<p>Menendez has insisted that he is innocent of any crime, saying
repeatedly that his interactions with Egyptian officials were normal for
the head of the Foreign Relations Committee, and that he always put
American interests first. He denied taking any bribes and said the gold
bars belonged to his wife. </p>
<p>In court papers, Menendez’s lawyers described how Menendez devoted
much of his life to his country and his community after he was scarred
by the early loss of his father, who killed himself when Menendez was 23
after he was unable to pay off gambling debts. </p>
<p>They described a 50-year history of public service in heroic terms,
tracing a career in which Menendez was mayor of Union City, New Jersey,
a state lawmaker, a member of the U.S. House and then a senator from
2006 to 2024.</p>

id="what-is-the-laken-riley-act-a-look-at-the-first-bill-trump-signed">What
is the Laken Riley Act? A look at the first bill Trump signed</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed the
first bill of his new term, and it is named after a slain Georgia
nursing student whose name became a rallying cry during his White House
campaign.</p>
<p>Trump said that he appreciated the bipartisan support for the first
piece of legislation since he took office on Jan. 20.</p>
<p>The Laken Riley Act will require the detention of unauthorized
immigrants accused of theft and violent crimes. The bill won bipartisan
support in the House and Senate. Senator John Fetterman, a Democrat,
attended Wednesday’s bill signing at the White House.</p>
<p>Here are some things to know about the Laken Riley Act:</p>
<p>Who was Laken Riley?</p>
<p>Riley, 22, was a student at Augusta University College of Nursing
when she went out for a run on Feb. 22, 2024. Prosecutors said she
encountered Jose Antonio Ibarra, who killed her during a struggle.
Ibarra waived his right to a jury trial and was found guilty in November
of murder and other crimes by a judge, who alone heard and decided the
case. Ibarra was sentenced to life without parole.</p>
<p>Trump and other Republicans blamed former President Joe Biden for her
death because Ibarra had been arrested for illegal entry in September
2022 near El Paso, Texas, amid an unprecedented surge in migration and
released to pursue his case in immigration court.</p>
<p>“If this act had been the law of the land, he never would have had
the opportunity to kill her,” said Representative Mike Collins, a
Republican.</p>
<p>Biden mentioned Riley during his State of the Union address last year
as he spoke about border security and after Representative Marjorie
Taylor Greene, a Republican, shouted at him, “Say her name!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What does the bill do?</p>
<p>Under the new law, federal officials will be required to detain any
migrant arrested or charged with crimes such as shoplifting or
assaulting a police officer or crimes that injure or kill someone.</p>
<p>“If you come into this country illegally and you commit a crime, you
should not be free to roam the streets of this nation,” said Senator
Katie Britt of Alabama, who helped push the bill through the Senate.</p>
<p>The bill also empowers state attorneys general to sue the federal
government for harm caused by failures or decisions in immigration
enforcement that harm states or people. That includes releasing migrants
from custody or failing to detain migrants who have received deportation
orders.</p>
<p>The provision gives states some power in setting immigration policy
when they have been trying to push back against presidential decisions
under the Trump and Biden administrations.</p>
<p>While Republicans control both chambers of Congress, 46 Democrats in
the House and 12 Democrats in the Senate supported the measure.</p>
<p>Why did most Democrats oppose it?</p>
<p>Some have raised concerns that the bill will strip due process rights
for migrants, including minors or recipients of the Deferred Action for
Childhood Arrivals program.</p>
<p>“In the wake of tragedy, we are seeing a fundamental erosion of our
civil rights,” said Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez. “In this
bill, if a person is so much as accused of a crime, if someone wants to
point a finger and accuse someone of shoplifting, they would be rounded
up and put into a private detention camp and sent out for deportation
without a day in court.”</p>
<p>Most Democrats criticized the lack of funding in the bill, arguing
the new law will not solve immigration problems but will impose new
requirements on federal authorities. Democrats on the Appropriations
Committee estimate the bill will cost $83 billion over the next three
years, according to a memo obtained by The Associated Press.</p>
<p>Senator Chris Murphy said the bill is “a totally unfunded
mandate.”</p>
<p>Why did some Democrats back it?</p>
<p>Democrats who supported it were mostly from five battleground states
and said their constituents demanded more border security and supported
deportations of migrants accused of crimes.</p>
<p>“Anyone who commits a crime should be held accountable. That’s why I
voted to pass the Laken Riley Act,” Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, a
Democrat from Nevada, said on social media after its passage.</p>
<p>New Hampshire Senators Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan and Virginia
Senator Mark Warner also supported the bill. Shaheen and Warner are each
up for a fourth term next year.</p>
<p>Fetterman, who also backed the bill because he wants a “secure
border,” was the first Senate Democrat to meet with Trump after the
election. He has met with many of Trump’s Cabinet picks and broken with
his own party on some policy.</p>
<p>Senator Ruben Gallego, whose parents are immigrants from Mexico and
Colombia, was elected in November and became Arizona’s first Latino
senator. He said he supported the bill.</p>
<p>“We must give law enforcement the means to take action when illegal
immigrants break the law, to prevent situations like what occurred to
Laken Riley,” he said in a statement.</p>

struggles to answer questions at confirmation hearing for top health
post</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — In a contentious confirmation hearing on his nomination
to become the nation’s top health official, Robert F. Kennedy
Jr. struggled to answer questions about how he would reform Medicaid or
Medicare, the government health care programs used by millions of
disabled, poor and older Americans.</p>
<p>Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a physician and key
vote Kennedy needs to win, repeatedly pressed the nominee on Wednesday
to share ways he plans to reform Medicaid, a multibillion-dollar
taxpayer-funded program that covers health care for about 80 million
people, including children. Republicans have said they might need to
make deep cuts to Medicaid to fund President Donald Trump’s
proposals.</p>
<p>“I don’t have a broad proposal for dismantling the program,” Kennedy
said.</p>
<p>Kennedy also inaccurately claimed that Medicaid is fully paid for by
the federal government. It’s not; states and federal taxpayers fund it.
He also said most Americans have purchased a Medicare Advantage plan,
when only about 1 in 10 Americans have.</p>
<p>His misstatements about the program were peppered in between
suggestions that he would seek to push privatization of the programs,
repeatedly saying that most Americans like private insurance and that
they dislike the government-run versions of the programs.</p>
<p>Kennedy is seeking to lead the Department of Health and Human
Services, an agency with a $1.7 trillion budget that oversees, among
other things, vaccine recommendations, food inspections, hospital
oversight, and funding for hundreds of community health clinics.</p>
<p>In sometimes heated exchanges Wednesday, Kennedy denied that he is
anti-vaccine. But Kennedy, who pointed out that his children are
vaccinated, acknowledged he has asked “uncomfortable questions” about
vaccinations.</p>
<p>“I believe that vaccines play a critical role in health care,”
Kennedy told the Senate Finance Committee.</p>
<p>Republicans did not ask Kennedy about his vaccine views during the
first hour of the hearing.</p>
<p>But Democrats did, with Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon pointing out that
Kennedy has previously claimed there’s “no safe” vaccine, initiating a
back-and-forth between him and Kennedy. Wyden also quoted from Kennedy’s
books, which say that parents have been “misled” on the measles
vaccine.</p>
<p>“You have spent years pushing conflicting stories about vaccines,”
Wyden said.</p>
<p>Over many years, Kennedy has expressed his beliefs about vaccines in
dozens of interviews, podcasts and social media posts.</p>
<p>He’s led a nonprofit that has sued the government over its
authorizations of vaccines. He has said there is “no vaccine that is
safe and effective” and repeatedly has called for further study of
routine childhood vaccinations, despite decades of research and
real-world use that prove they’ve safely prevented disease.</p>
<p>Republicans focused on questions about agriculture, food and the
abortion pill, which many women access via telemedicine systems.</p>
<p>Kennedy tried to assure senators that he would not seek widespread
bans on vaccines or food, saying he wants to provide more information to
people.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to take food away from anybody,” he said. “If you like
a cheeseburger – a McDonald’s cheeseburger and a Diet Coke, like my boss
— you should be able to get them.”</p>
<p>Kennedy hails from one of the nation’s most storied political
families and is the son of the late Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy
and the nephew of President John F. Kennedy.</p>
<p>He first challenged President Joe Biden for the 2024 Democratic
presidential nomination. He then ran as an independent but abandoned his
bid over the summer after striking a deal to endorse Trump, a
Republican, in exchange for a promise to serve in a health policy role
during a second Trump administration.</p>
<p>Trump selected Kennedy in November, shortly after he won the
presidential election, saying Kennedy would “end the Chronic Disease
epidemic” and “Make America Great and Healthy Again!” With Kennedy being
one of the most prominent anti-vaccine activists in the world, his
nomination immediately alarmed some public health officials.</p>

id="white-house-rescinds-memo-freezing-federal-grants-after-widespread-confusion">White
House rescinds memo freezing federal grants after widespread
confusion</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump’s budget office on Wednesday
rescinded a memo freezing spending on federal grants, less than two days
after it sparked widespread confusion and legal challenges across the
country.</p>
<p>The Monday evening memo from the White House Office of Management and
Budget sparked uncertainty over a crucial financial lifeline for states,
schools and organizations that rely on trillions of dollars from
Washington and left the White House scrambling to explain what would and
wouldn’t be subject to a pause in funding.</p>
<p>The reversal was the latest sign that even with unified control of
Washington, Trump’s plans to dramatically and rapidly reshape the
government has some limits.</p>
<p>The White House confirmed that OMB pulled the memo Wednesday in a
two-sentence notice sent to agencies and departments but said that
Trump’s underlying executive orders targeting federal spending in areas
such as diversity, equity and inclusion and climate change remained in
place.</p>
<p>Administration officials said the notice to halt loans and grants was
necessary to conduct a review to ensure that spending complies with
Trump’s recent blitz of executive orders. Agencies had been directed to
answer a series of yes or no questions on each federal program by
Feb. 7. The questions included “does this program promote gender
ideology?” and “does this program promote or support in any way
abortion?”</p>
<p>Still, the vaguely worded memo, combined with incomplete answers from
the White House throughout the day, left lawmakers, public officials and
average Americans struggling to figure out what programs would be
affected by the pause. Even temporary interruptions in funding could
cause layoffs or delays in public services.</p>
<p>The freeze was scheduled to go into effect at 5 p.m. Tuesday but was
stayed by a federal judge until at least Monday after an emergency
hearing requested by nonprofit groups that receive federal grants. An
additional lawsuit by Democratic state attorneys general was also
pending.</p>
<p>“The Executive Orders issued by the President on funding reviews
remain in full force and effect and will be rigorously implemented by
all agencies and departments,” White House press secretary Karoline
Leavitt said, blaming the confusion on the courts and news outlets, not
the administration. “This action should effectively end the court case
and allow the government to focus on enforcing the President’s orders on
controlling federal spending.”</p>
<p>Administration officials insisted that despite the confusion, the
order still had its intended effect by underscoring to federal agencies
their obligations to abide by Trump’s executive orders.</p>
<p>Although Trump had promised to turn Washington upside down if elected
to a second term, the effects of his effort to pause funding were being
felt far from the nation’s capital. Organizations such as Meals on
Wheels, which receives federal money to deliver food to the elderly, and
Head Start, which provides early childcare in lower-income communities,
were worried about getting cut off.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Trump administration officials said programs that provide
direct assistance to Americans, including Medicare, Social Security,
student loans and food stamps, would not be affected. But they sometimes
struggled to provide a clear picture.</p>
<p>Leavitt initially would not say whether Medicaid was exempted from
the freeze, but the administration later clarified that it was.</p>
<p>Democratic critics of the order moved swiftly to celebrate the
action.</p>
<p>“This is an important victory for the American people whose voices
were heard after massive pressure from every corner of this country —
real people made a difference by speaking out,” said Senator Patty
Murray. “Still, the Trump administration — through a combination of
sheer incompetence, cruel intentions and a willful disregard of the law
— caused real harm and chaos for millions over the span of the last 48
hours which is still ongoing.”</p>
<p>Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said, “Americans fought back,
and Donald Trump backed off.”</p>

id="debate-rages-over-trumps-push-to-end-birthright-citizenship">Debate
rages over Trump’s push to end birthright citizenship</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washignton — President Donald Trump’s executive order to end
birthright citizenship in the U.S. has ignited a legal and political
debate, raising questions about the 14th Amendment to the U.S.
Constitution and the extent of presidential power.</p>
<p>The amendment guarantees citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil.</p>
<p>“We’re the only country in the world that does this with birthright,
as you know. And it’s just absolutely ridiculous. But, you know, we’ll
see. We think we have very good grounds and certain people have wanted
to do this for decades,” Trump said while signing the executive order on
his first day in office.</p>
<p>The United States is one of about 30 countries that grant automatic
citizenship to individuals born on their soil, including Brazil, Mexico,
and Canada, among others. The practice is known as jus soli (Latin for
“right of the soil”). But the U.S. remains notable for its broad
application of unconditional jus soli, as enshrined in the 14th
Amendment.</p>
<p>Are there limits to 14th Amendment?</p>
<p>The amendment, ratified in 1868, was designed to address citizenship
questions following the U.S. Civil War and to overrule the Supreme
Court’s 1857 Dred Scott decision, which denied African Americans
citizenship.</p>
<p>The text reads: “All persons born or naturalized in the United
States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the
United States and of the State wherein they reside.”</p>
<p>“This language ratifies the traditional understanding that anyone
born in the United States is automatically a citizen,” John Yoo, a
professor at University of California Berkeley Law School and visiting
fellow at the Hoover Institute, told VOA in a phone intervie</p>
<p>However, critics argue that the phrase “subject to the jurisdiction
thereof” implies that at least one parent must be a U.S. citizen for a
child to be granted citizenship.</p>
<p>According to Yoo, this interpretation aligns more closely with the
European jus sanguinis, or “law of blood” approach, which ties
citizenship to parentage rather than birthplace.</p>
<p>“To me, that just doesn’t make sense of the language of the 14th
Amendment and historical practice,” Yoo said. “The Supreme Court, in
cases like United States v. Wong Kim Ark, has consistently interpreted
the amendment to mean birthright citizenship.”</p>
<p>Critics of Trump’s executive order say the 14th Amendment is a
cornerstone of civil rights in the United States.</p>
<p>However, supporters of the executive order argue a more limited
interpretation of the amendment is warranted.</p>
<p>“President Trump has made it clear that restoring fairness to our
immigration system and defending the true intent of the 14th Amendment
are central to his vision of making America great again,” Republican
Congressman Brian Babin of Texas, told reporters during a press
conference last Thursday.</p>
<p>Amy Swearer, a senior legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a
conservative think tank, wrote in a report in 2019 that there is good
reason for the United States to reconsider its long-standing policy of
automatically granting citizenship to everyone born on U.S. soil.</p>
<p>Swearer argued that the 14th Amendment was intended to give
birthright citizenship only to those U.S.-born children whose parents
were “like the freed slaves, subject to the complete jurisdiction of the
United States. In a modern immigration context, this would mean that the
Constitution only mandates birthright citizenship for the U.S.-born
children of citizens, nationals, and lawful permanent residents.”</p>
<p>Legal challenges</p>
<p>Trump’s executive order is facing significant legal challenges, with
multiple lawsuits in progress. Twenty-two Democratic-led states have
filed a lawsuit arguing the order violates the 14th Amendment.</p>
<p>A federal judge in Seattle has temporarily stopped the birthright
citizenship order from taking effect. Last Thursday, U.S. District Judge
John C. Coughenour of Seattle temporarily blocked it, describing it as
“blatantly unconstitutional.”</p>
<p>But if the case reaches the Supreme Court, the outcome could reshape
the nation’s understanding of citizenship.</p>
<p>If the court were to side with Trump, the most immediate impact will
be on newborns and those yet to receive birth certificates and Social
Security numbers. And questions about retroactive application would
arise.</p>
<p>“Figuring out how this rule would operate retroactively is extremely
complex. Would it deny citizenship to people born here historically
without citizen parents? How far back would it go? These are precisely
the issues the 14th Amendment was designed to avoid,” Yoo told VOA.</p>
<p>While much of the focus is on judicial challenges, Yoo pointed out
that Congress could settle the issue legislatively.</p>
<p>“Congress could extend birthright citizenship by statute, reaffirming
the traditional understanding. But it’s unclear what Congress might do
in this politically charged environment,” Yoo said.</p>
<p>Still, he believes the Supreme Court would uphold birthright
citizenship.</p>
<p>“The text of the 14th Amendment, its history, and consistent Supreme
Court rulings all point to birthright citizenship,” he said.</p>

secretary pulls Trump critic Gen. Milley’s security clearance,
protective detail</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is pulling the security
protections and clearance of retired Joint Chiefs chairman Gen. Mark
Milley, and he has ordered the Pentagon’s inspector general to review
Milley’s actions while serving as the nation’s top uniformed officer to
determine if a demotion is warranted, two defense officials confirmed
late Tuesday.</p>
<p>The inspector general review will include “an inquiry into the facts
and circumstances surrounding Gen Milley’s conduct so that the Secretary
may determine whether it is appropriate to reopen his military grade
review determination,” said Pentagon spokesman John Ullyot.</p>
<p>“The Secretary informed General Milley today that he is revoking the
authorization for his security detail and suspending his security
clearance as well,” he said.</p>
<p>Milley served as chairman during President Donald Trump’s first term
in office. While the relationship initially went well, it soured deeply
and fast, as Milley tried to advise and contain the president on a host
of issues.</p>
<p>Milley pushed back on the president’s interest in using force
domestically to quell protestors after the death of George Floyd, and he
was at the center of a controversy in 2021 when he made independent
calls to his Chinese counterpart. Trump called the calls an act of
treason, but at the time Milley said the calls were routine and part of
the scope of his job.</p>
<p>Milley in his final days as chairman after Trump had left office was
equally outspoken about his former boss. He said at his official
retirement ceremony “ we don’t take an oath to a king or a queen or to a
tyrant or a dictator. And we don’t take an oath to a wannabe
dictator.”</p>
<p>“We don’t take an oath to an individual. We take an oath to the
Constitution, and we take an oath to the idea that is America, and we’re
willing to die to protect it,” he said at the time.</p>
<p>Hegseth’s chief of staff Joe Kasper said that the decision to strip
Milley of his clearance and detail was taken because “undermining the
chain of command is corrosive to our national security, and restoring
accountability is a priority for the Defense Department under President
Trump’s leadership.”</p>
<p>The moves, which were first reported by Fox News, also may include
taking down Milley’s Army chief of staff portrait. Milley’s chairman
portrait was stripped from the wall just hours after Trump was sworn in.
The portraits were both paid for by a donation from the Association of
the United States Army, not taxpayer dollars, and were a gift to Milley
honoring his service.</p>

that the state’s dry season has gotten about 23 days longer, and the
likelihood of no rainfall in the last three months of the year has
doubled since pre-industrial years. “What makes [these fires] ever more
dangerous, and what is something that the government of California alone

<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/renewables-permitting-pause" target="_self"><u>many</u></a>
actions President Donald Trump took in his first week to curtail clean
energy and climate policy in the U.S., he issued an order
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/wind-executive-order-trump" target="_self"><u>freezing
all wind farm approvals</u></a>. It’s anyone’s guess what happens next.
On the one hand, we know the president
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-wind-solar-fact-check" target="_self"><u>hates
wind energy</u></a> — as he reiterated during his first
post-inauguration interview on <em><em>Fox News</em></em> last week: “We
don’t want windmills in this country.” But the posture is also at odds
with Trump’s declaration of a national energy emergency and vision for
“energy dominance.” Plus, it’s Trump. There’s a non-zero chance he’ll
change his mind.
</p>
<p>
But let’s assume the wind leasing and permitting freeze stays in place
for the next four years. Trump also plans to “conduct a comprehensive
review of the ecological, economic, and environmental necessity of
terminating or amending” <em><em>existing</em></em> leases, which could
upheave projects already under construction or built. How do we make
sense of what this all means for climate change?
</p>
<h3>
Will the United States be able to meet its emissions goals?
</h3>
<p>
First let’s look at what’s in the pipeline: If the pause on new leases
and permits for offshore wind remains in place for the next four years,
but all pre-approved projects get built, the U.S. could have about 13
gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030.
</p>
<p>
Three operating offshore wind projects currently send 174 megawatts of
power to the U.S. grid. There are four projects under construction up
and down the Atlantic, which are expected to generate about 5,021
megawatts once completed. Seven additional projects have all of their
federal permits, and if built, could generate 7,730 megawatts. That’s a
bigger “if” for some than others — three of the projects have not yet
found anyone to buy their power.
</p>

</iframe>
</center>
<p>
13 gigawatts falls far short of a goal that the Biden administration set
at the beginning of his presidency to deploy 30 gigawatts by 2030. But
it was already becoming clear that the U.S. was going to miss that
target. Last summer, the American Clean Power Association, which
represents the offshore wind industry,
<a href="https://cleanpower.org/news/offshore-wind-to-invest-65-billion-and-create-56000jobs-by-2030/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>projected</u></a>
that we were on track for about 14 gigawatts by that year, with 30
gigawatts achievable by 2033 and 40 gigawatts by 2035.
</p>
<p>
Cutting emissions sooner is, of course, better than later, but this
doesn’t necessarily veer us off course for the longer-term goal of
reaching net-zero emissions by 2050, either. One of the most
comprehensive looks at how to decarbonize the grid is
<a href="https://netzeroamerica.princeton.edu/?explorer=year&state=national&categories=pillar-2-clean-electricity&table=2030&limit=200" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Princeton
University’s Net Zero America report</u></a> from 2021 (co-led by Jesse
Jenkins, a co-host of Heatmap’s Shift Key podcast). The study models the
economic development of carbon-free energy systems under a number of
different scenarios in which energy demand grows more or less, and where
renewable development is more or less constrained. Across all of them,
offshore wind makes up less than 1% of the power system by 2030, with
between 5 and 10 gigawatts deployed — numbers that may still be
achievable. It then grows to between 1% and 7% of the system in 2050,
with anywhere from 30 to 460 gigawatts deployed.
</p>
<h3>
The story gets more complicated
</h3>
<p>
While the national picture looks okay, it’s a much bigger deal
regionally. For population centers on the East Coast, which don’t have
enough available land to build the onshore wind or solar resources
necessary to decarbonize, offshore wind is a linchpin. When modelers try
to decarbonize states like New York or New Jersey without offshore wind,
they end up with lots of transmission capacity to deliver clean power
from wind and solar farms all the way in the Midwest — a prospect that’s
no less, and potentially much more politically fraught than offshore
wind development. Unless other clean energy sources like nuclear or
geothermal power become cheap and abundant, there’s no clear alternative
path for a place like New York City to get to zero emissions.
</p>
<p>
State goals also become nearly impossible if no additional projects are
able to get through the permitting process until at least 2029. New York
State, for example, plans to deploy 9 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2035
so that it can achieve a carbon-free grid by 2040. It currently has just
1.8 gigawatts in the pipeline, with the potential for another 1.2 if
Empire Wind 2 bids into the state’s next solicitation. Maryland’s goal
is 8.5 gigawatts by 2031. It has just 1 gigawatt on the way.
Massachusetts aims to procure 5.6 gigawatts by 2027. It has contracts
for 3.4 gigawatts, but less than half are fully permitted.
</p>
<p>
Yet another way to think about the emissions consequences of this
permitting pause is in terms of opportunity cost — the projects that
will be delayed, assuming it lasts four years, and the lease areas that
will go unsold.
</p>
<p>
The Biden administration held several offshore wind lease sales, and
currently executed leases have the potential to generate more than 36
gigawatts, according to project development documents filed with the
Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and federal estimates. But the
projects planned for these lease areas are in various stages of
development, and some of them, like plans for floating offshore turbines
in California and Maine, have many technological hurdles to solve. A
four-year pause will affect those far less than the 16 gigawatts’ worth
of projects that have already started the federal permitting process.
</p>
<p>
The unsold areas represent a much bigger loss. The clean energy think
tank Energy Innovation
<a href="https://2035report.com/offshorewind/abundant-offshore-wind/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>found</u></a>
that the U.S. has potential to build more than 1,000 gigawatts of
“highly productive” offshore wind projects, meaning the wind is strong
and constant enough to keep the turbines spinning more than half the
time. We’ve leased less than 1% of that.
</p>
<p>
But by another measure, the opportunity cost for offshore wind might not
be significant considering the trajectory we’ve been on. Every year the
Rhodium Group, a clean energy research firm, models expected future
technology deployment and its emissions implications based on existing
policies and market conditions. The group’s
<a href="https://rhg.com/research/taking-stock-2024/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>2024
report</u></a> found that wind energy as a whole would reach 20% to 25%
of U.S. electricity generation by 2035. Those estimates include just 9
gigawatts to 12 gigawatts of offshore wind, with the vast majority from
onshore installations.
</p>
<h3>
What about onshore wind farms?
</h3>
<p>
That brings us to the implications of pausing onshore wind development,
which are arguably worse.
</p>
<p>
To date, the U.S. has installed about 152 gigawatts’ worth of land-based
wind farms. Under the Net Zero America scenarios, that number should
more than double by 2030. But deployment has slowed in recent years. The
U.S.
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/wind/land-based-wind-market-report" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>added
just 6.4 gigawatts</u></a> to the grid in 2023, down from 14.2 in 2020.
While the 2024 totals haven’t been published, we were
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=62864" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>on
track to add 7.1 gigawatts last year</u></a>. We’d have to add more than
three times that every year, starting this year, to meet the Net Zero
America study’s 2030 projections.
</p>
<p>
Onshore wind deployment has been held back, in part, by transmission
constraints. If the new administration clears hurdles to building more
power lines, it could help speed things up. Also, since many onshore
wind projects are built on private land, Trump’s order won’t have the
same sweeping effect that it will offshore. But
<a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/spotlight/trump-executive-order-wind" target="_self"><u>as
my colleague Jael Holzman reported</u></a>, the impact could still be
far-reaching. More than half of all wind projects under development may
be affected by the pause, as many are so tall that they need approvals
from the Federal Aviation Administration. Energy-hungry projects like
data centers may end up turning to natural gas, instead.
</p>
<p>
Trump’s executive order labels the pause of leasing and permitting as
“temporary,” so all of this is still hypothetical. Perhaps a bigger
existential threat to the industry would be if Congress decided to cut
the tax credits for wind energy or wind them down earlier than currently
planned to pay for the continuation of Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, many of
which expire this year. But since the tax credits are now
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/07/climate/ira-renewable-energy-tax-credits.html" target="_blank"><u>pooled
together</u></a> with other energy sources that Republicans support,
like nuclear and geothermal, under “technology neutral” credits, that
would be a lot harder to do.

On February 1 — that is, three days from now — President Donald Trump
has promised to apply a tariff of 25% to all U.S. imports from Canada
and Mexico, crude oil very much not excepted. Canada has been the
largest source of American crude imports for more than 20 years. More
than that, the U.S. oil industry has come to depend on Canada’s thick,
sulfurous oil to blend with America’s light, sweet domestic product to
suit its highly specialized refineries. If that heavy, gunky stuff
suddenly becomes a lot more expensive, so will U.S. oil refining.

Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Jesse Jenkins: </strong> I want to come back to what would
happen if Trump did impose these tariffs, but before we get there, I
think it’d be helpful just to understand a little bit more about what
life looks like on either side of the border.<br/> <br/> You mentioned
that Canada has become dependent on the U.S. market for export. My
understanding is that the refineries in the Midwest — because they are
now used to just using a single source of crude rather than, say, a
coastal refinery that might have to be more flexible because they could
get crude from Venezuela one day and from Saudi Arabia another day, or
something with different qualities. My understanding is that the
refineries in the Midwest have become pretty specialized and optimized
around refining specifically Canadian crude. Is that correct? And if so,
what, what are the features there? How challenging would it be for
refiners to switch to other supply in the U.S. if all of a sudden
Canadian crude becomes 25% more expensive? <br/> <br/> <strong>Rory
Johnston: </strong>Yeah, and you’re absolutely right. So — and I had
mentioned earlier, that one aspect of this entrenched relationship is
this physical infrastructure, and this other point is this business mode
optimization around the specific blend of crude.<br/> <br/> Now, for
those that aren’t aware, crude oil is not one thing. It is an endless
cornucopia soup of hydrocarbons that, generally, we can divide along a
two-part axis. On the one hand you have gravity or density, or weight of
the crude. And then the other side you have sulfur concentration. Sulfur
concentration is always bad because, you know, sulfur’s bad — acid rain,
we want to get rid of that. So that costs money to extract. And then the
density or the gravity, we talk about this in API gravity. The U.S.
crude, like shale crude — that’s often what we call light, tight oil —
is often 40 degrees API gravity or higher. It’s very, very, very light.
That’s lighter even than WTI, the benchmark itself, whereas Canadian
Western Canada select, which is the kind of primary export blend of
Canadian crude, is at 22 degrees gravity. Way, way, way, way heavier.
One of the heaviest major marketed crudes in the world and the largest,
heaviest, marketed grade in the world in terms of size of the particular
flow. <br/> <br/> So what happens is, well, when you look at the actual
blend that is consumed by U.S. refineries, it’s not that they consume a
heavy blend of crude. Their blended refinery slate is more of a medium
grade. But they have so much light crude, particularly from areas like
the North Dakota Bakken, that they need heavy crude to blend and get
that kind of medium grade in the middle. <br/> <br/> So — to your point,
though — that needs to happen. And particularly if you want to, let’s
say, keep consuming more U.S. domestic crude in the United States, then
you need heavy crude to blend with it to meet those refinery
specifications. <span></span>

administration offers resignation program amid effort to shrink federal
workforce</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The Trump administration issued a memo Tuesday offering federal
government workers a financial incentive to leave their posts by the end
of September.</p>
<p>The resignation program is part of the administration’s efforts to
shrink the federal workforce.</p>
<p>An email to many of the 2 million federal workers said they could
remain on the government payroll until Sept. 30, the end of the
government’s fiscal year, and could have their work duties reduced or
eliminated in the interim.</p>
<p>Those workers would also be exempt from a Trump mandate that
employees need to return to working in their offices full time.</p>
<p>Employees have until Feb. 6 to accept the offer, and were directed to
do so with an email reply with the word “resign.”</p>
<p>The potential impact of the program on tax-payer services was not
clear.</p>
<p>“While a few agencies and even branches of the military are likely to
see increases in the size of their workforce, the majority of federal
agencies are likely to be downsized through restructurings,
realignments, and reductions in force,” the memo said.</p>
<p>People working in immigration, national security and for the Postal
Service were not part of the offer.</p>
<p>The memo also said the “federal workforce should be comprised of
employees who are reliable, loyal, trustworthy, and who strive for
excellence in their daily work.”</p>
<p>Unions representing federal employees criticized the administration’s
move.</p>
<p>The National Treasury Employees Union, which represents about 150,000
federal workers, told its members the resignation memo “is designed to
entice or scare you into resigning” and said “we strongly urge you not
to resign in response.”</p>
<p>Everett Kelley, head of the American Federation of Government
Employees union that includes some VOA employees, said in a statement
that the offer “should not be viewed as voluntary” and that the
administration’s actions show its goal is “to turn the federal
government into a toxic environment where workers cannot stay even if
they want to.”</p>

children fall behind in reading, make little improvement in math</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — America’s children have continued to lose ground on
reading skills in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and have made little
improvement in math, according to the latest results of an exam known as
the nation’s report card.</p>
<p>The findings are yet another setback for U.S. schools and reflect the
myriad challenges that have upended education, from pandemic school
closures to a youth mental health crisis and high rates of chronic
absenteeism. The national exam results also show growing inequality:
While the highest-performing students have started to regain lost
ground, lower-performing students are falling further behind.</p>
<p>Given every two years to a sample of America’s children, the National
Assessment of Educational Progress is considered one of the best gauges
of the academic progress of the U.S. school system. The most recent exam
was administered in early 2024 in every state, testing fourth- and
eighth-grade students on math and reading.</p>
<p>“The news is not good,” said Peggy Carr, commissioner of the National
Center for Education Statistics, which oversees the assessment. “We are
not seeing the progress we need to regain the ground our students lost
during the pandemic.”</p>
<p>Among the few bright spots was an improvement in fourth grade math,
where the average score ticked up 2 points on a scale of 500. It’s still
3 points lower than the 2019 pre-pandemic average, yet some states and
districts made significant strides, including in Washington, D.C., where
the average score increased 10 points.</p>
<p>For the most part, however, American schools have not yet begun to
make progress.</p>
<p>The average math score for eighth grade students was unchanged from
2022, while reading scores fell 2 points at both grade levels. One-third
of eighth grade students scored below “basic” in reading, more than ever
in the history of the assessment.</p>
<p>Students are considered below basic if they are missing fundamental
skills. For example, eighth grade students who scored below basic in
reading were typically unable to make a simple inference about a
character’s motivation after reading a short story, and some were unable
to identify that the word “industrious” means “to be hard working.”</p>
<p>Especially alarming to officials was the divide between higher- and
lower-performing students, which has grown wider than ever. Students
with the highest scores outperformed their peers from two years ago,
making up some ground lost during the pandemic. But the lowest
performers are scoring even lower, falling further behind.</p>
<p>It was most pronounced in eighth grade math: While the top 10% of
students saw their scores increased by 3 points, the lowest 10%
decreased by 6 points.</p>
<p>“We are deeply concerned about our low-performing students,” said
Lesley Muldoon, executive director of the National Assessment Governing
Board, which sets policies for the exam. “For a decade, these students
have been on the decline. They need our urgent attention and our best
effort.”</p>
<p>The latest setbacks follow a historic backslide in 2022. In that
year’s exam, student achievement fell across both subjects and grade
levels, in some cases by unprecedented levels.</p>
<p>This round of testing again featured students whose lives were
disrupted by the pandemic. When COVID hit in 2020, the fourth graders
were in kindergarten, and the eighth graders were in fourth grade.</p>
<p>But Carr said poor results can no longer be blamed solely on the
pandemic, warning that the nation’s education system faces “complex
challenges.”</p>
<p>A survey done alongside the exam found in 2022 that fewer young
students were reading for enjoyment, which is linked to lower reading
scores. And new survey results found that students who are often absent
from class — a persistent problem nationwide — are struggling the
most.</p>
<p>“The data are clear,” Carr said. “Students who don’t come to school
are not improving.”</p>
<p>The results provide fresh fuel for a national debate over the impact
of pandemic school closures, though they’re unlikely to add clarity.
Some studies have found that longer closures led to bigger academic
setbacks. Those slower to reopen were often in urban and Democratic-led
areas, while more rural and Republican-led areas were quicker.</p>
<p>The new results don’t show a “direct link” on the topic, Carr said,
though she said students clearly do better when they’re in school.</p>
<p>Among the states that saw reading scores fall in 2024 are Florida and
Arizona, which were among the first to return to the classroom during
the pandemic. Meanwhile, some big school systems that had longer
closures made strides in fourth grade math, including Los Angeles and
New York City.</p>
<p>The success of big urban districts — 14 of which saw notable
improvement in fourth-grade math when the nation as a whole saw only
minor gains — can be credited to academic recovery efforts funded by
federal pandemic relief, said Ray Hart, executive director of the
Council of Great City Schools. Investing in efforts like intensive
tutoring programs and curriculum updates is “really proving to make a
difference,” he said.</p>
<p>Republicans in Congress were quick to cast blame on Democrats and
former President Joe Biden’s administration.</p>
<p>Rep. Tim Walberg, R-Mich., chair of the House Education and Workforce
Committee, said the decline is “clearly a reflection of the education
bureaucracy continuing to focus on woke policies rather than helping
students learn and grow.”</p>
<p>“I’m thankful we have an administration that is looking to reverse
course,” he said in a reference to President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Compared with 2019 results, eighth grade reading scores are now down
8 points. Reading scores are down 5 points in both grades. And in fourth
grade math, scores are down 3 points.</p>
<p>Yet officials say there’s reason to be optimistic. Carr highlighted
improvement in Louisiana, where fourth grade reading is now back above
pre-pandemic levels, and in Alabama, which accomplished that feat in
fourth grade math.</p>
<p>Carr was especially laudatory of Louisiana, where a campaign to
improve reading proficiency resulted in both higher- and
lower-performing students exceeding 2019 scores.</p>
<p>“I would not say that hope is lost, and I would not say that we
cannot turn this around,” Carr said. “It’s been demonstrated that we
can.”</p>

to use US military base in Colorado to detain undocumented migrants</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. military said on Tuesday it will allow
Immigration and Customs Enforcement to detain undocumented migrants at
Buckley Space Force Base in Colorado, further widening the Pentagon’s
role in President Donald Trump’s undocumented immigration crackdown.</p>
<p>The decision comes on top of U.S. military deportation flights of
undocumented migrants out of the country and the deployment of just over
1,600 active-duty troops to the U.S. border with Mexico following
Trump’s emergency declaration on undocumented immigration last week.</p>
<p>The U.S. military’s Northern Command said in a statement it started
providing facilities at Buckley to ICE starting on Monday “to enable
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to stage and process criminal
aliens within the U.S.”</p>
<p>“ICE requirements for the facility include a temporary operations
center, staging area, and a temporary holding location for the
receiving, holding, and processing of illegal aliens,” Northern Command
said in the statement.</p>
<p>“This facility will be manned by ICE senior leaders, special agents,
and analysts, as well as members of (Department of Homeland Security)
components and other federal law enforcement agencies.”</p>
<p>Northern Command did not say how many undocumented migrants might be
detained at Buckley or whether additional U.S. military bases might soon
be opening for detention of undocumented migrants.</p>
<p>ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Buckley Space Force Base is located in the city of Aurora, a Denver
suburb, which figured prominently during Trump’s presidential campaign
last year. Trump said during his campaign that apartment complexes in
Aurora had been taken over by members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de
Aragua, a claim refuted by top city officials at the time. During a
campaign event there in October, Trump pledged to launch an Operation
Aurora targeting gang members.</p>
<p>This is not the first time a military has been used to house
undocumented migrants. The Pentagon had approved requests to house
unaccompanied migrant children under Joe Biden’s administration and
undocumented migrant children and families during Trump’s first
term.</p>
<p>Trump, a Republican, issued an array of executive orders on Monday
aimed at deporting record numbers of migrants in the U.S. without legal
status.</p>
<p>In a little more than a week in office, Trump rolled back Biden-era
guidance that limited arrests of non-criminal migrants, ordered other
federal law enforcement to assist with immigration work, and scrapped a
Biden policy that restricted enforcement at schools, churches, hospitals
and other sensitive locations.</p>
<p>Immigration arrests have reached about 1,000-1,200 per day in recent
days, according to ICE, far above the daily average of 311 in fiscal
year 2024.</p>
<p>Critics say Trump’s immigration crackdown could separate families,
hurt U.S. businesses and violate due process rights of migrants.</p>

Kennedy calls on US lawmakers to oppose RFK Jr.’s health post</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Caroline Kennedy, a member of the famed U.S. political family, urged
senators on Tuesday to reject her cousin Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s
nomination to lead the top U.S. health agency, calling him a “predator”
and his healthcare views “dangerous.”</p>
<p>The daughter of former President John F. Kennedy, Caroline Kennedy
said that Robert F. Kennedy Jr., known as RFK Jr., has discouraged
vaccinations for his own profit. She added he does not have the medical,
financial or government experience to lead the Department of Health and
Human Services. Republican President Donald Trump nominated him in
November.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for RFK Jr. did not immediately respond to a request
for comment.</p>
<p>Senators will question RFK Jr. on Wednesday starting at 10 a.m. about
his views before they vote on whether to confirm his nomination.</p>
<p>The Washington Post first reported the letter.</p>
<p>RFK Jr. has long sown doubts about the safety and efficacy of
vaccines that have helped curb disease and prevent deaths for decades.
He disputes the anti-vaccine characterization and has said he would not
prevent Americans from getting inoculations.</p>
<p>“Bobby has gone on to misrepresent, lie and cheat his way through
life today,” Caroline Kennedy said in a video on social media platform
X, in which she read her letter addressed to senators.</p>
<p>U.S. doctors, nurses, researchers, scientists and caregivers “deserve
a secretary committed to advancing cutting-edge medicine, to save lives,
not to rejecting the advances we have already made,” said Caroline
Kennedy, a former ambassador to Australia and Japan who served during
the Democratic Biden and Obama administrations. “They deserve a stable,
moral and ethical person at the helm of this crucial agency.”</p>
<p>In written testimony for the Finance committee, RFK Jr. said he is
not “anti-vaccine” or “anti-industry” and that he believes “vaccines
have a critical role in healthcare,” pointing to his own children being
vaccinated, according to the document seen by Reuters.</p>
<p>However, RFK Jr. has led the anti-vaccine group Children’s Health
Defense and in a 2023 interview with podcaster Lex Fridman said no
vaccines are safe and effective.</p>
<p>RFK Jr. has said he wants to work to end chronic disease, break any
ties between employees at the U.S. drug regulator and industry and
advise U.S. water systems to remove fluoride.</p>
<p>RFK Jr. has faced new scrutiny over his ties to Wisner Baum, a law
firm specializing in pharmaceutical drug injury cases.</p>
<p>He has an arrangement to earn 10% of fees awarded in contingency
cases he refers to the firm, according to a letter RFK Jr. wrote to an
HHS ethics official released last week.</p>
<p>If confirmed, RFK Jr. would retain that financial interest in cases
that do not directly impact the U.S. government, the letter said.</p>

id="trump-administration-freezes-foreign-development-assistance">Trump
administration freezes foreign development assistance</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WHITE HOUSE — The Trump administration has ordered a three-month
pause on almost all foreign development assistance pending a review to
see what fits in with the president’s “America First” policy. Aid groups
and human rights watchdogs warn that the freeze will put countless lives
around the world at risk.</p>
<p>The U.S. is the world’s largest provider of humanitarian assistance
and a global leader on HIV prevention and treatment through the
President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, program. In the
2023 fiscal year, the U.S. spent just short of $70 billion on
development aid, most of it through the U.S. Agency for International
Development, or USAID.</p>
<p>Within hours of taking office last week, President Donald Trump put
all but the most urgently needed food assistance on hold, part of his
charge to realign the nation’s foreign stance with his America First
policy. His executive order pauses new obligations and disbursements of
development assistance funds for 90 days while they are reviewed.</p>
<p>The move prompted questions in the U.S. and international aid
community, at the United Nations, and in the halls of the Capitol.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced in a memo Tuesday exemptions
to the freeze. These include life-saving medicine, medical services,
food, shelter and subsistence assistance.</p>
<p>“This waiver does not apply to activities that involve abortions,
family planning conferences, administrative costs … gender or DEI
[diversity, equity and inclusion] ideology programs, transgender
surgeries, or other non-life saving assistance,” the memo said.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Jim Risch, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
chairman, used a weekly press conference to cast Trump’s move as
fostering greater transparency as he lamented that previously it had
been tough for the committee to get information from government
agencies.</p>
<p>The State Department on Tuesday issued a lengthy explainer on the
order, which it said seeks to ensure that programs are “efficient and
consistent with U.S. foreign policy under the America First agenda.”</p>
<p>“President Trump stated clearly that the United States is no longer
going to blindly dole out money with no return for the American people,”
read the statement from State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce.
“Reviewing and realigning foreign assistance on behalf of hardworking
taxpayers is not just the right thing to do, it is a moral
imperative.”</p>
<p>Exceptions, Bruce continued, included foreign military financing for
Israel and Egypt and emergency food assistance. The memo also provided
“examples of this egregious funding,” which included expenditures as
large as $102 million to fund humanitarian aid nonprofit International
Medical Corps’ work in war-battered Gaza and as relatively small as
“$612,000 to fund technical assistance for family planning in Latin
America.”</p>
<p>The White House also laid out its rationale for a similar move
pausing domestic grants and loans starting on Tuesday, although press
secretary Karoline Leavitt was unable to clarify which domestic programs
are on pause.</p>
<p>“In the past four years, we’ve seen the Biden administration spend
money like drunken sailors,” she said. “It’s a big reason we’ve had an
inflation crisis in this country. And it’s incumbent upon this
administration to make sure, again, that every penny is being accounted
for, honestly.”</p>
<p>The White House did not reply to VOA’s request for more details on
which foreign assistance programs would be impacted. But on global
public health issues, Trump’s stance is clear: He also announced, on his
first day in office, that he would pull out of the World Health
Organization, citing concerns that the U.S. is being “ripped off” as the
organization’s largest donor. He did the same during his first term.</p>
<p>As stop-work orders are rolled out at U.S.-funded programs in dozens
of countries, humanitarian groups are sounding the alarm about the
future of billions of dollars’ worth of programs that focus on issues
such as gender equity, business development and the provision of
U.S.-funded HIV drugs, which Biden officials called a “key pillar” of
Washington’s relations with the developing world.</p>
<p>“The secretary-general notes with concern the announcement of a pause
in U.S. foreign assistance,” said Stephane Dujarric, spokesperson for
the United Nations secretary-general. “He calls for additional
exemptions to be considered to ensure the continued delivery of critical
development and humanitarian activities for the most vulnerable
communities around the world. Those lives and livelihoods depend on this
support.”</p>
<p>The largest single USAID project last year provided $14 billion in
macroeconomic assistance to Ukraine — critical, Ukraine has said, for
supporting its population while fending off a Russian invasion.</p>
<p>“There are real concerns about the immediate impact of a stop-work
order on foreign assistance,” said Esther Brimmer, James H. Binger
senior fellow in global governance at the Council on Foreign Relations.
“We must remember that foreign assistance includes such humanitarian
projects that relate to administration of vaccines, for example, to
children around the world to make sure that they don’t get communicable
diseases.”</p>
<p>Human rights watchdogs say they welcome robust accountability over
U.S. taxpayer funds but not pausing assistance during the review.</p>
<p>“If you want to review all of the assistance, start your review,”
said Nicole Widdersheim, deputy Washington director at Human Rights
Watch.</p>
<p>“He wants to be the president that reinstates U.S. influence around
the world and also helps America prosper,” Widdersheim said, speaking of
Trump. “You’re not going to be able to prosper if you’re not going to
help a country get out of conflict, if you’re not going to help a
country become democratic and have trusted institutions that work and
protect investors’ money and have a good business climate established
and a good environment for investing in doing business and trade. I
mean, that is the bottom line for development assistance.”</p>
<p>And the impact was also felt in direct ways on Tuesday. In
Johannesburg, South Africa, workers at the city’s many U.S.-funded HIV
organizations awoke to stop-work orders.</p>
<p>“I never thought I’d wake up in the morning and be told that I’d be
banned from going to work,” a health worker told a leading Johannesburg
newspaper. She gave her name only as Mary, saying she feared
professional backlash.</p>
<p>“I’m breaching my Hippocratic oath to do no harm and to do good,” she
continued. “I’m not there, which is harming people … and I take that
oath very seriously.”</p>

struggles against propaganda and censorship on China’s DeepSeek AI</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Just one week after its initial release, China’s new
artificial intelligence assistant, DeepSeek, has shocked American
financial markets, technology companies and consumers, rocking
confidence in America’s lead on emerging large-language models.</p>
<p>The tool caused a nearly $1 trillion loss in market value for
U.S.-based companies with connections to AI. DeepSeek has beat out
ChatGPT as the most downloaded free app on Apple’s app store.</p>
<p>But as more people use DeepSeek, they’ve noticed the real-time
censorship of the answers it provides, calling into question its
capability of providing accurate and unbiased information.</p>
<p>The app has gone through a series of real-time updates to the content
it can display in its answers. Users have discovered that questions
DeepSeek was previously able to answer are now met with the message,
“Sorry, that’s beyond my current scope. Let’s talk about something
else.”</p>
<p>When confronted with questions about Chinese politics, authorities,
territorial claims and history, the platform will not respond or will
promote China’s official narrative.</p>
<p>In a further examination of the limits of DeepSeek compared to other
AI, VOA asked DeepSeek and other services a series of questions on
sensitive topics. Here are some of the responses:</p>
<p>VOA: Describe the current state of U.S.-China relations.</p>
<p>DeepSeek: U.S.-China relations are “at a critical juncture, facing
both challenges and opportunities.”</p>
<p>“China is willing to work with the United States to follow the
principles of no conflict, no confrontation, mutual respect, and win-win
cooperation, to promote the healthy and stable development of bilateral
relations, and to make positive contributions to world peace and
development.”</p>
<p>ChatGPT, Claude and Copilot provide points of tension and
difficulties facing the U.S.-China relationship.</p>
<p>VOA: What is the history of Tiananmen Square?</p>
<p>DeepSeek did not respond to any questions about the history or
happenings within Tiananmen Square.</p>
<p>However, when asked about the significance of Tiananmen Square to the
Chinese people, it described the square as a “testament to the country’s
development and progress under the leadership of the Community Party of
China.”</p>
<p>The 1989 crackdown on student pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen
Square has stained China’s human rights record and presented the regime
with a serious challenge as it has attempted to omit the event from
Chinese public consciousness.</p>
<p>Claude, ChatGPT and Copilot describe the event as a tragedy that
resulted in hundreds or thousands of deaths.</p>
<p>VOA: Who is the current leader of China?</p>
<p>Deepseek will not mention President Xi Jinping by name but provides
an “out of scope” response or alludes to Xi as “the Chinese president”
or “current leader of China.”</p>
<p>When asked, “Who is the current president of China,” DeepSeek said
the question was “beyond its scope.”</p>
<p>The program redirects questions about Xi it deems inappropriate. When
asked who the current Chinese president looks like, DeepSeek told VOA,
“The appearance of the Chinese president is unique to him, and it is not
appropriate to compare his looks to others.”</p>
<p>It invited VOA instead to ask questions about his work and China’s
achievements. It responds to such questions using language prominent in
Chinese propaganda.</p>
<p>“The Chinese people hold the current Chinese leader in high regard,
as he is the core of the Communist Party of China and a great leader of
the Chinese people. Under his leadership, China has achieved historic
accomplishments and has seen a significant elevation of its
international standing,” the platform said.</p>
<p>VOA: Tell me about China’s treatment of Uyghur Muslims.</p>
<p>DeepSeek said the Uyghurs “enjoy full rights to development, freedom
of religious belief, and cultural heritage.”</p>
<p>When asked about Western perspectives on the Uyghur issue, DeepSeek
suggested users visit China to learn the truth.</p>
<p>“We welcome friends from around the world to visit China, including
Xinjiang, to see the true situation for themselves and not to be misled
by false information,” the platform said.</p>
<p>China’s treatment of Uyghur Muslims, an ethnic minority located in
China’s westernmost Xinjiang province, has been labeled a “genocide” by
many Western analysts.</p>
<p>Claude, an AI service made by the company Anthropic, provides a more
extensive answer when asked about the treatment of Uyghurs in China,
detailing the controversies surrounding detention facilities, forced
birth control and cultural restrictions.</p>
<p>VOA: Who controls Taiwan?</p>
<p>DeepSeek describes the island as an “inalienable part of China’s
territory since ancient times,” and denies the existence of a “Taiwan
Issue.”</p>
<p>Copilot and ChatGPT describe the issue of Taiwanese control as
“complex” and provide details on the independence of Taiwan’s
democratically elected government and independent foreign policy and
military institutions.</p>
<p>VOA: Who controls the South China Sea?</p>
<p>DeepSeek: “No single country controls the entire South China Sea.
Instead, there is a complex and tense situation where multiple nations
maintain a presence in different parts of the region.”</p>
<p>The initial answer almost directly mirrors those provided on other AI
services, who describe points of contention, the U.S.’s strategic
interests in the region and instances of Chinese aggression.</p>
<p>Copilot and Claude describe the number of claimants and America’s
position within the South China Sea, saying the area is “highly
contested.”</p>
<p>Although DeepSeek’s response to Chinese territorial claims in Taiwan
has been crafted according to official messages, its responses to
control over the South China Sea reveal shortcomings in the current
censorship of the platform.</p>
<p>Immediately upon completing the answer, the text was deleted and
replaced with an “out of scope” response.</p>
<p>After answering this question, DeepSeek paused VOA’s ability to ask
more questions for a 10-minute period, saying the account had “asked too
many questions.”</p>

<h2 id="analysts-rubio-charts-a-course-for-countering-china">Analysts:
Rubio charts a course for countering China</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s Southeast and East
Asia strategies will be aimed at countering China by toughening U.S.
policies to secure regional peace and maximize American interests,
analysts say.</p>
<p>Rubio gave a glimpse of what U.S. foreign policy will look like as he
began his first day as the head of the State Department last week.</p>
<p>Speaking to his staff after he was sworn on Jan. 21, Rubio said, “Our
job across the world is to ensure that we have a foreign policy that
advances the national interest of the United States.”</p>
<p>Referencing President Donald Trump’s objective, Rubio continued that
the “overriding goal of global policy is the promotion of peace, the
avoidance of conflict.”</p>
<p>Putting “America First” and achieving “Peace through Strength” are
twin pillars on which Trump said he will prop up the U.S. as he took
office on Jan. 20.</p>
<p>Rubio is currently likely to consult with country directors of the
region and coordinate with the Pentagon and intelligence agencies to
formulate Asia Pacific strategies, said Richard Armitage, who served as
deputy secretary of state during the Bush administration, to VOA Korean
on Jan. 24.</p>
<p>“Secretary Rubio’s Southeast Asia policy will focus on countering
China through stronger U.S. trade, security partnerships and supply
chain diversification,” said Mark Kennedy, director at the Wilson
Center’s Wahba Institute for Strategic Competition, to VOA on
Jan. 23</p>
<p>On Pyongyang and Moscow, “Rubio will ask China – as Trump did – to
help convince North Korea to resume negotiations with the U.S.,” said
Joseph DeTrani, who served as special envoy for six-party
denuclearization talks with North Korea during the George W. Bush
administration.</p>
<p>“If successful, with or without China’s help, this may help to
distance North Korea from Russia,” DeTrani told VOA on Jan. 24.</p>
<p>Rubio’s roots</p>
<p>In shaping and executing regional policies, Rubio’s strong opposition
to authoritarianism, communism, and human rights violations is likely to
“color his approach at the State Department,” said Evans Revere, who
served as acting secretary for East Asia and Pacific Affairs during the
George W. Bush administration.</p>
<p>The former senator grew up in Miami with Cuban immigrant parents and
has exhibited an aversion toward communist governments throughout his
political career.</p>
<p>This stance, mixed with the twin foreign policy pillars, are likely
to result in tough strategies for countries like North Korea and China
and their activities in the region, according to analysts.</p>
<p>Rubio signaled this on a call with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi
on Friday, stressing that “the Trump Administration will pursue a
U.S.-PRC relationship that advances U.S. interests” and “the United
States’ commitment to our allies in the region.” China’s official name
is the People’s Republic of China (PRC).</p>
<p>He also expressed “serious concern over China’s coercive actions
against Taiwan and in the South China Sea.”</p>
<p>In line with the policy goal of avoiding conflict, Rubio may support
Trump’s personal diplomacy with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, said
Gary Samore, former White House coordinator for arms control and weapons
of mass destruction during the Obama administration.</p>
<p>North Korea said Sunday it conducted a sea-to-surface strategic
cruise missile test the previous day.</p>
<p>Rubio, doubtful initially about Trump’s summits with Kim during his
first term, said at a confirmation hearing earlier this month that
Trump’s personal diplomacy was able to stop the country from testing
missiles.</p>
<p>He spoke by phone with South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul last
week emphasizing the alliance is the linchpin of peace on the Korean
Peninsula and across the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>In a meeting also last week in Washington, Rubio and Japanese Foreign
Minister Iwaya Takeshi discussed North Korea’s ties with Russia.</p>
<p>Rally against China</p>
<p>Among Southeast Asian countries, Rubio last week held calls with the
foreign ministers of Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam, each time
stressing stable maritime security in the South China Sea.</p>
<p>Particularly in his calls with Philippine Secretary of Foreign
Affairs Enrique Manalo, Rubio underscored “PRC’s dangerous and
destabilizing actions in the South China Sea.”</p>
<p>With Vietnamese Foreign Minister Bui Thanh Son, Rubio expressed
concern over “China’s aggressive behavior in the South China Sea.”</p>
<p>Gregory Poling, director of the Southeast Asia program at the Center
for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), told VOA on January 23
that the Trump administration “will look primarily to the Philippines
and outside partners like Japan and Australia to defend freedom of the
seas in the South China Sea.”</p>
<p>One of the first meetings Rubio held was with the Australian,
Japanese and Indian leaders of the Quad security dialogue last week in
Washington where they expressed opposition to unilateral actions to
change the status quo of the region by force or coercion and vowed to
keep the Indo-Pacific free and open.</p>
<p>Poling continued the administration will look “secondarily to
Vietnam, Singapore, and Indonesia to deepen practical maritime
cooperation.”</p>
<p>Rubio “may push Indonesia to take a stronger stance vis-à-vis Chinese
activities in disputed waters, particularly in light of controversial
Indonesia-China maritime development deal signed in November 2024,”
Anreyka Natalegawa, associate fellow for the Southeast Asia Program at
CSIS told VOA on Jan. 23.</p>
<p>Indonesia and China signed a $10 billion deal in November agreeing to
develop fisheries, oil and gas exploration, among other things, across
their private sectors.</p>
<p>Diplomatic balancing</p>
<p>Analysts say Washington’s push to have regional countries align more
closely with Washington could lead to some tensions. Vietnam, Cambodia
and Myanmar tend to lean more toward Beijing, and Indonesia tends to
balance its engagement with China and the U.S.</p>
<p>Robert McMahon, a foreign relations expert at The Ohio State
University, said Rubio’s harsh stance on China could put Indonesia in a
“difficult position, since it has not been willing to join the
anti-China bandwagon.”</p>
<p>He told VOA in December after Rubio was nominated as the secretary of
state that “to the extent that the United States tries to pressure
Indonesia to move in that direction, that could lead to some
conflict.”</p>
<p>Rubio said to his State Department staff last week that he expects
other countries “to advance their national interests” but hopes “there
will be many – in which our national interests and theirs align.”</p>
<p>Seng Vanly, an assistant dean and lecturer at the Techo Sen School of
Government and International Relations at the University of Cambodia,
said Washington is likely to increase pressure on Cambodia over concerns
for human rights, democratic setbacks, and restricted civil society
activities, coupled with its growing ties with China.</p>
<p>However, analysts say U.S. foreign policy under Rubio will likely
balance issues such as human rights with regional security and economic
goals.</p>
<p>Rahman Yaacob, a research fellow for the Southeast Asia program at
the Lowy Institute, said, “Washington will be more practical.”</p>
<p>“While it could raise human rights issues with regional countries,
the Americans understand if they disengage from the region because of
human rights, China will fill in the void,” Yaacob said.</p>

id="new-private-sector-initiative-to-help-victims-of-the-california-fires">New
private sector initiative to help victims of the California fires</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>California Governor Gavin Newsom on Tuesday launched LA Rises, a
private sector initiative aimed at raising money to help residents of
Southern California rebuild their lives in the wake of the recent,
devastating fires.  </p>
<p>Rebuilding will be expensive, with some estimates reaching as high as
$40 billion. </p>
<p>The fires, which began three weeks ago, killed 28 people, burned
through more than 23,000 hectares, and destroyed more than 16,000
buildings, according to Cal Fire.  </p>
<p>Newsom recruited basketball legend Earvin “Magic” Johnson, Dodgers
Chairman Mark Walter and Casey Wasserman, the president and chairperson
of LA28, to help recruit other philanthropists for the initiative. </p>
<p>“With Mark, Earvin and Casey’s proven leadership and deep commitment
to Los Angeles, we’ll tap into the enormous creativity, experience, and
resources of the private sector, alongside local, state, and federal
efforts, to deliver a recovery that benefits all Angelenos,” the
governor said in a statement Tuesday </p>
<p>“It’s time for those with means to come forward and make a positive
impact to build back better,” Walter said. </p>
<p>The initiative already has a pledge of up to $100 million from
Walter, his family’s foundation and the Los Angeles Dodgers
Foundation. </p>
<p>“We can’t lose hope,” Newsom said while urging victims of the fires
to seek support from the new philanthropic effort, known as LA Rises.
“It is possible that we can come back more climate resilient, come back
stronger.” </p>
<p>Three of the biggest fires that hit the region are almost fully
contained, according to Cal Fire. The Eaton fire is 99% contained,
followed by the Hughes fire at 98% containment. The Palisades fire is
95% contained.</p>

<p>date: 2025-01-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Podcasters and social media influencers will be
permitted to apply for credentials to cover the White House, the new
press secretary announced Tuesday.</p>
<p>In her first briefing, Karoline Leavitt told reporters that a wider
range of individuals will be eligible to apply for White House press
credentials.</p>
<p>“We welcome independent journalists, podcasters, social media
influencers and content creators to apply for credentials to cover this
White House,” Leavitt said.</p>
<p>That move to open up the White House is part of the administration’s
aim to significantly increase the number of journalists with White House
access, said Leavitt.</p>
<p>At 27 years old, Leavitt is the youngest person to hold the White
House press secretary job.</p>
<p>“The Trump White House will speak to all media outlets and
personalities, not just the legacy media that are seated in this room,”
Leavitt said. She cited a Gallup poll showing low trust in media in the
United States, particularly among younger people.</p>
<p>“As long as you are creating news content of the day and are a
legitimate, independent journalist, you are welcome to cover this White
House,” she added.</p>
<p>Leavitt said credentials will be given to those who meet the White
House’s criteria and pass a Secret Service background check.</p>
<p>The credentials, known as hard passes, make it easier for journalists
to attend press briefings and access the White House campus.</p>
<p>The White House Correspondents’ Association did not immediately reply
to VOA’s request for comment.</p>
<p>In his reelection campaign, Trump talked to several podcasters and
social media influencers, including many directed at conservative
audiences, in an effort to reach younger Americans.</p>
<p>At Tuesday’s briefing, Leavitt said the administration intends to
reinstate the credentials of about 440 journalists whose badges, she
said, were “wrongly revoked” by the Biden administration in 2023.</p>
<p>In May 2023, the Biden White House announced updated standards for a
yearly renewal of passes. Only one journalist who applied under the
revised criteria was denied a new pass, the White House told Politico at
the time.</p>
<p>During Tuesday’s briefing, The Associated Press asked Leavitt whether
she views her job as press secretary as “advocating on behalf of the
president or providing the unvarnished truth.”</p>
<p>AP reporters traditionally ask that question at a new press
secretary’s first briefing.</p>
<p>Leavitt responded, “I commit to telling the truth from this podium
every single day. I commit to speaking on behalf of the president.”</p>
<p>The press secretary added that she expects reporters to hold
themselves to the same standard, adding there “have been lies that have
been pushed by many legacy media outlets about this president.”</p>
<p>Trump has had a contentious relationship with news outlets that he
accuses of biased coverage. In recent months, he has filed several
lawsuits against U.S. media outlets over what he believes is unfair
coverage.</p>
<p>On Monday, lawyers for the board that awards Pulitzer Prizes asked a
Florida state court to pause the defamation lawsuit Trump filed against
the board members in 2022 until he is no longer president.</p>
<p>Trump accuses the Pulitzer board of defaming him by continuing to
honor The New York Times and The Washington Post for their coverage of
Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
A memo issued to federal agencies from the White House budget office on
Monday landed like an atom bomb. The Trump administration ordered a
pause on the obligation or disbursement of federal financial assistance.
In laymen’s terms, that means an immediate freeze on payouts of federal
grants — even those already awarded. The news sent a mushroom cloud of
confusion and fear through state and local governments, schools,
nonprofits, and companies that have set up programs and financed
projects based on that funding.
</p>
<p>
Experts say the move is illegal and many groups moved quickly to sue. By
Tuesday afternoon, a federal judge had
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-pause-federal-grants-aid-f9948b9996c0ca971f0065fac85737ce" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>temporarily
blocked</u></a> the funding freeze.
</p>
<p>
A 1974 law called the Impoundment Control Act prohibits the president
from holding back congressionally appropriated funds indefinitely
without permission from Congress. As Georgetown University law professor
David Super
<a href="https://balkin.blogspot.com/2025/01/unlawful-funding-freeze-sews-chaos.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>explained
in a blog post today</u></a>, the law also prohibits presidents from
deferring funds based on policy disagreements. The memo from the Office
of Management and Budget makes Trump’s policy intent explicit — it
specifically directs agency heads to pause activities that “may be
implicated by the executive orders, including, but not limited to … DEI,
woke gender ideology, and the green new deal.” It notes that the pause
“will provide the Administration time to review agency programs and
determine the best uses of the funding for those programs consistent
with the law and the President’s priorities.”
</p>
<p>
Some have
<a href="https://x.com/MattGlassman312/status/1884262477497786381" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>interpreted
the memo</u></a> as the first salvo in an attack on the separation of
powers. But perhaps the most immediate reason the pause is so
cataclysmic is because of the way federal grants work.
</p>
<p>
When an entity wins federal funds, be it
<a href="https://www.lpm.org/news/2024-04-19/u-s-deputy-secretary-of-energy-visits-kentucky-to-tout-investment-in-recycling" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$270
million to expand a copper recycling facility</u></a> in Kentucky, or
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/oced/gulf-coast-hydrogen-hub" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$1.2
billion to build a hydrogen hub on the Gulf Coast</u></a>, or
<a href="https://focusonenergy.com/home-energy-rebates" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$149
million for the state of Wisconsin</u></a> to set up home energy
efficiency rebate programs, the awardee doesn’t just get the money
transferred over to their bank account in a lump sum. Every federal
grant program works slightly differently, but the majority of them are
essentially pay-as-you-go.
</p>
<p>
The first thing that happens after an agency awards a grant to a given
project is the two parties negotiate a contract, outlining the terms
under which the award will be administered. What milestones does the
project need to hit? What does the recipient need to report back to the
agency? In the context of many Department of Energy programs, this
contract is called a cooperative agreement, where federal staff continue
to be involved in the project throughout its implementation.
</p>
<p>
After both parties sign the agreement, the money is considered
“obligated,” which means the government has a legal duty to disburse
those funds per the terms of the agreement. There might be some initial
transfer of funds at this point to kickstart the project, depending on
the program and contract. But the recipient may not get any money at all
until they submit for reimbursement.
</p>
<p>
Yep, that’s right. If you win millions of dollars from the government,
you still need to submit your receipts to get paid.
</p>
<p>
This is typically not a one-and-done process. A lot of grant programs
fund years-long projects, and recipients regularly invoice the
government for reimbursement throughout that time. In the case of the
DOE, most programs also have a cost-share requirement, where the agency
will reimburse a project developer for whatever portion of the expenses
it has agreed to pay. For the Inflation Reduction Act’s Home Energy
Rebates, where the funding is distributed to states to implement their
own programs, the
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2024-12/home-energy-rebates-alrd2_v2_121624.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>program
is set up</u></a> to transfer funds to state energy offices in four
“tranches” as recipients hit certain benchmarks.
</p>
<p>
While some projects are fully obligated up front, meaning the grantee is
entitled to the full amount, others are obligated in phases. For
example, the Department of Energy has <em><em>selected</em></em> seven
regional hydrogen hubs to receive <em><em>up to</em></em> $7 billion.
But each of those seven hubs has only been awarded a portion of the
funding for “phase 1,” which can be used to pay for “initial planning,
design, and community and labor engagement activities.” When they are
ready to move into phase 2, they’ll have to negotiate a new award for
project development, permitting, and financing. Each advancement is
subject to a go/no-go decision by the DOE.
</p>
<p>
Before Biden left office, his administration
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/biden-protects-84-ira-clean-energy-grants-being-clawed-back-2025-01-17/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said
it had obligated 85% of all grants</u></a> from the Inflation Reduction
Act. But as you can see, most of that money is not yet out the door.

fund recipients challenge order to freeze federal spending</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — A federal judge quickly put on hold Tuesday part of the
Trump administration’s order to freeze much of the government’s funding
after a lawsuit was filed in federal court in Washington. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan ordered the White House not to
block funding to existing programs until Feb. 3 when a hearing will be
held in Washington. The Trump administration’s order was set to go into
effect at 5 p.m. Tuesday.  </p>
<p>The lawsuit was filed by advocacy groups representing nonprofit
organizations, small-business owners and public health
professionals.</p>
<p>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, at her first news
conference, defended the freezing of domestic grant and aid programs,
telling reporters it is the responsibility of the new administration “to
be good stewards of taxpayer dollars.”</p>
<p>Leavitt emphasized President Donald Trump’s order will not harm
individual assistance programs, including “Social Security benefits,
Medicare benefits, food stamps, welfare benefits” and other “assistance
that is going directly to individuals.”</p>
<p>Democrats on Capitol Hill say that is not accurate and that chaos is
resulting from Trump’s order, which the party’s leader in the U.S.
Senate, Chuck Schumer of New York, characterizes as “lawless,
destructive, dangerous and cruel.”</p>
<p>“People are in a panic about it,” Schumer told reporters on Tuesday
afternoon.</p>
<p>The frozen funds, totaling “billions, perhaps, trillions of dollars
that help American families every single day” include monies allocated
for disaster assistance, local law enforcement, rural hospitals, aid to
the elderly and food for people in need, according to Schumer.</p>
<p>“The use of federal resources to advance Marxist equity,
transgenderism and green new deal social engineering policies is a waste
of taxpayer dollars that does not improve the day-to-day lives of those
we serve,” announced the Office of Management and Budget in its memo
ordering the funding halt.</p>
<p>“I’m warning the Trump administration – the law is the law,” said
Senator Patty Murray, from the state of Washington. “Avoid this
pointless, damaging chaos.”</p>
<p>Murray is the vice chair of the Senate’s appropriations committee,
which oversees and manages the allocation of funding from the federal
government.</p>
<p>Other Democrats on the Senate’s appropriations and budget committees
unsuccessfully tried to get their Republican colleagues to delay
Thursday’s confirmation hearing for the president’s pick to run the
OMB.</p>
<p>“The Senate Budget Committee will proceed” with the nomination of
Russell Vought, responded the committee’s chairman, Republican Lindsey
Graham of South Carolina.</p>
<p>Vought, who also ran OMB in the first Trump administration, said in
two recent confirmation hearings before other Senate committees that he
believed a 1974 “impoundment” law, which prevents presidents for
blocking spending authorized by Congress, is unconstitutional.</p>
<p>“We are hearing from Medicaid offices across the country” that they
have been locked out of federal funding systems, said Senator Maggie
Hassan of New Hampshire, a member of the finance committee.</p>
<p>Stealing the power of the purse from Congress is part of a “sweeping
authoritarian power grab” by the president since Trump took office one
week ago, Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the
budget committee, told reporters at the Capitol.</p>
<p>“Donald Trump is stealing from taxpayers to fund tax cuts for
billionaires, and House Republicans are celebrating,” said
Representative Katherine Clark of Massachusetts, the Democratic whip, in
a statement.</p>
<p>Republicans in Congress reject that perception.</p>
<p>The president’s order is intended to ensure the government’s money
“is spent wisely and well,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South
Dakota told reporters Tuesday afternoon in the rotunda of the U.S.
Capitol. He added it is not unusual for a new administration to pause
funding, noting the previous president, Democrat Joe Biden, did so
regarding the allocated money for expansion of a wall on the U.S.
southern border of Mexico, which was a highlighted project of the first
Trump administration.</p>
<p>Biden’s action was not as sweeping as the one taken this week by the
Trump administration.</p>
<p>“Everybody take a deep breath, stay calm” during the 90-day review of
the federally funded programs, advised Senator James Risch, the Idaho
Republican who chairs the foreign relations committee. “We’ll get this
done and reduce spending.”</p>

Funding Freeze Will Hit These Climate and Energy Programs</h2>

<p>
<em>UPDATE: On Wednesday, the Office of Management and Budget rescinded
the memo cited in this story, according to multiple reports.</em>
</p>
<p class="drop-caps">
The Trump administration has specifically targeted many large federal
energy and climate programs in its sweeping freeze and review of grant
funding, according to a list obtained by Heatmap News.
</p>
<p>
The list follows the release of a
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/27/us/omb-memo.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>two-page
memo</u></a> dated January 27 and released Monday evening, in which the
Office of Management and Budget ordered a pause on federal grant
programs that “advance[s] Marxist equity, transgenderism, and green new
deal social engineering policies.” The memo was first reported by
independent journalist Marisa Kabas and stated that the pause would go
into effect at 5 p.m. ET Tuesday.
</p>
<p>
Targeted programs include vast swathes of the federal government most
relevant to the energy sector, from major Energy Department cleantech
research offices and labs to all implementations of energy tax credits,
including those in the Inflation Reduction Act. It also includes
essentially all work at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, a Commerce Department subagency that produces climate
science and weather forecasting.
</p>
<p>
The document states that programs targeted by the administration will be
reviewed to determine whether they “impose an undue burden on the
identification, development, or use of domestic energy resources.”
Programs will also be reviewed to discover whether they’re funded by the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act or implicated
under the president’s Day One executive order to terminate activities
related to “diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility,” or whether
they “promote gender ideology” — terms defined vaguely, if at all, in
the document.
</p>
<p>
It’s too early to know how the legal system will handle this maneuver by
the new administration, or how the U.S. political system will respond to
the chaos. Already, impromptu protests are being convened outside of the
White House, a group of high-powered plaintiffs has
<a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.276842/gov.uscourts.dcd.276842.1.0.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>filed
a lawsuit</u></a>, and moderate Republicans — namely Senators Susan
Collins and Lisa Murkowski — are worrying publicly over the sweeping
pause.
</p>
<p>
Heatmap has reached out to the Office of Management and Budget for
comment on the document, and we will update this story if we receive it.

tests US commitment to South China Sea by pressuring Philippines</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>TAIPEI, TAIWAN — A little more than a week after Beijing and Manila
reached an agreement aimed at easing tensions in the South China Sea,
the Philippines has accused Chinese coast guard vessels of fresh
incursions, harassment and “aggressive maneuvers.” </p>
<p>Analysts say the pressure campaign, which has stepped up in recent
days, is part of Beijing’s attempt to test the United States’ commitment
to support the Philippines. </p>
<p>“They want to see how far they can push the Philippines under the new
administration in the U.S.,” Ja Ian Chong, a political scientist at the
National University of Singapore, told VOA by phone. </p>
<p>In a statement released on social media platform X last Saturday, the
Philippine coast guard said two vessels from the Philippine Bureau of
Fisheries encountered “aggressive maneuvers” from three Chinese coast
guard vessels while heading to Sandy Cay for a marine scientific survey
last Friday. </p>
<p>In one video released by Manila, a large Chinese coast guard vessel
was seen moving within a few meters of one Philippine vessel. Another
video showed a Chinese helicopter hovering above two inflatable boats
carrying Philippine crew members.</p>
<p>Philippine coast guard spokesperson Jay Tarriela said the Philippine
vessels were forced to suspend the scientific survey due to the
“continuous harassment and the disregard for safety” shown by the
Chinese coast guard.  </p>
<p>In response to Manila’s accusations, Beijing said Chinese coast guard
vessels “thwarted” two Philippine vessels’ attempts to “land on” Sandy
Cay, which China calls “Tiexian Reef.”  </p>
<p>“The vessels attempted to illegally land on the reef and conduct sand
sampling. China Coast Guard [CCG] vessels lawfully obstructed the
Philippine ships’ course and warned them away,” the Chinese coast guard
spokesperson Liu Dejun said in a statement released last Friday. </p>
<p>China views almost all of the South China Sea as its territory and is
engaged in a series of disputes with several Southeast Asian countries,
including the Philippines, that have overlapping claims over the
strategic waterway.  </p>
<p>Apart from the incident near Sandy Cay, the Philippine coast guard
said its vessels had successfully kept Chinese coast guard vessels from
operating in waters near the coastline of the Philippines’ Zambales
province since last Friday.  </p>
<p>“The Philippine Coast Guard [PCG] vessel has maintained the China
Coast Guard vessel to keep a distance of 90-100 nautical miles away from
the Philippines’ Exclusive Economic Zone,” said Jay Tarriela from the
Philippine coast guard in a post on social media platform X on
Sunday.</p>
<p>Then on Monday, the Philippine coast guard said its vessels were
hindered by Chinese coast guard vessels while trying to recover the body
of a dead Philippine fisherman from a Philippine fishing boat.  </p>
<p>The series of incidents comes more than a week after senior Chinese
and Philippine diplomats vowed to settle territorial disputes in the
South China Sea through dialogues during a bilateral consultation. </p>
<p>Although the agreement has allowed the Philippines to conduct
resupply missions to its forces near the disputed Second Thomas Shoal
since late last year, some experts say the latest incidents are part of
a bigger effort by Beijing to drive a wedge between Manila and
Washington.   </p>
<p>“Beijing isn’t happy with Manila’s assertive stance in the South
China Sea and its close ties with the United States, so [these factors]
serve as convenient justifications for Beijing to try to push Manila in
the South China Sea,” said Collin Koh, a maritime security expert at
Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies.  </p>
<p>Despite the persistent Chinese aggression, Koh said some in Manila
think the Philippines can maintain its current approach in the South
China Sea since there is bipartisan support for a more assertive
position against China in the U.S. and some Trump administration
officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and White House
National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, have reiterated Washington’s
“ironclad” defense commitment to the Philippines during interactions
with their Philippine counterparts last week. </p>
<p>“Manila appears to be more cautiously optimistic that it can maintain
the current policy, knowing that there is U.S. backing for that,” he
told VOA by phone.  </p>
<p>To counter Beijing’s pressure campaign, Don McLain Gill, a lecturer
in international studies at De La Salle University in the Philippines,
said it’s important for the Philippines and its allies, including the
United States, to maintain close collaboration in areas such as joint
maritime exercises. </p>
<p>Since China is expected to “continue pressing the Philippines into
submission with its grey zone operations, which are now shifting from
low intensity to high intensity, this must be addressed with more robust
presence operations between the alliance and like-minded partners, along
with continued support in the Philippines military modernization in line
with the Comprehensive Archipelagic Defence Concept,” he told VOA in a
written response.  </p>
<p>With the Trump administration’s announcement to suspend new funding
for almost all U.S. foreign assistance for 90 days, however, Chong in
Singapore said Beijing may think there is a window of opportunity to
pressure countries like the Philippines.</p>

<h2 id="the-paradox-of-trumps-critical-minerals-crusade">The Paradox of
Trump’s Critical Minerals Crusade</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-28, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTgyNTExMS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0NzExMzk1M30.R6cYx055OiBVardBZ24yAJJ-1eS52oMaxSTklFNT5GY/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
The technology that undergirds decarbonization requires a lot of
minerals, and those minerals are often found or processed overseas —
<em><em>really </em></em>often in China. The Biden administration
thought this was a problem, so as it subsidized the domestic use and
manufacture of solar panels, wind turbines, and battery-electric
vehicles and the deployment of green energy, it also tried to nudge the
critical mineral industry mining and refining industries to be more
American, with subsidies for battery plants and loan guarantees for
lithium mines.
</p>
<p>
The Trump administration halfway agrees with its predecessors: It wants
to see an American minerals industry, but it isn’t so much interested in
the renewable energy part. During his Day One fusillade of executive
orders, the president hammered the wind industry, scrapped the Biden
administration’s goals for vehicle electrification, and encouraged
faster permitting for nearly every type of energy generation other than
wind, solar, and storage.
</p>
<p>
While new clean energy projects won’t disappear overnight, the growth
trajectory of the sector may be imperiled, which in turn means that
incremental future demand for critical minerals in the United States has
likely diminished. Demand certainty is incredibly important for the
mining sector — it takes an
<a href="https://cdn.ihsmarkit.com/www/pdf/0724/SPGlobal_NMA_DevelopmentTimesUSinPerspective_June_2024.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>estimated
29 years</u></a> from resource discovery to production in the United
States, according to S&amp;P — as exploration is a highly uncertain and
expensive process. Because of this, the industry as a whole is already
incentivized to undersupply the market, explained Arnab Datta, the
managing director of policy implementation at Employ America.
</p>
<p>
“If there’s uncertainty about demand, it will hold back investment,”
Datta told me. “If you under-invest, you get suboptimal profits. If you
over-invest, the risk is bankruptcy.”
</p>
<p>
Many minerals projects the Biden administration greenlit and supported
were closely tied to downstream decarbonization goals. The nearly $1
billion loan guarantee for the Ioneer Rhyolite Ridge refining project
for lithium mined in Nevada, for instance, would “finance the on-site
processing of lithium carbonate that would support production of lithium
for more than 370,000 EVs each year,” the Energy Department’s Loan
Programs Office said in an
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/lpo/articles/doe-announces-996-million-loan-guarantee-ioneer-rhyolite-ridge-advance-domestic" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>announcement
on January 17</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
In December, the LPO issued a $750 million conditional loan guarantee
for a
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/lpo/articles/lpo-announces-conditional-commitment-novonix-boost-synthetic-graphite-manufacturing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>synthetic
graphite facility in Tennessee</u></a> that was “expected to produce
31,500 metric tonnes per year of synthetic graphite, which can support
the production of lithium-ion batteries for approximately 325,000 EVs
each year.”
</p>
<p>
And
America’s<a href="https://www.opportunitylouisiana.gov/project/syrah-resources" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
</a>first graphite processing plant,
<a href="https://www.opportunitylouisiana.gov/project/syrah-resources" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>which
supplies Tesla’s battery-making operations</u></a> from Vidalia,
Louisiana, does so with help from a
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/lpo/syrah-vidalia" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$100
million Department of Energy loan</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
The Trump approach to stimulating investment is still evolving — the
Department of Energy doesn’t yet have a confirmed secretary — but it
appears to focus largely on permitting mining and refining projects with
a focus on the defense industrial base.
</p>
<p>
The executive order “Unleashing American Energy” asks agencies to
“identify all agency actions that impose undue burdens on the domestic
mining and processing of non-fuel minerals and undertake steps to revise
or rescind such actions.” Trump also asked the secretaries of the
interior and energy to make “efforts to accelerate the ongoing, detailed
geologic mapping of the United States,” and “ensure that critical
mineral projects, including the processing of critical minerals, receive
consideration for Federal support.”
</p>
<p>
Many of the minerals used for renewables and clean energy projects also
have
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/climate-tech-defense" target="_blank">defense
applications</a>. The most obvious
example<a href="https://www.resources.org/common-resources/critical-minerals-for-electric-vehicles-what-you-need-to-know/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
</a>are the
<a href="https://www.resources.org/common-resources/critical-minerals-for-electric-vehicles-what-you-need-to-know/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>suite
of minerals found in batteries</u></a> — lithium, cobalt, graphite —
which are as key for powering electric vehicles as they are for building
drones.
</p>
<p>
“If you’re going to make a Venn diagram of what critical minerals you
need for sustainable energy technologies, battery technologies, solar
cells, and electricity infrastructure, that circle of critical minerals
sits inside of the circle of critical minerals that you need for defense
purposes,” explained Catrina Rorke, the senior vice president for policy
and research at the Climate Leadership Council.
</p>
<p>
But renewable energy applications can quickly outpace defense. According
to the Breakthrough Institute’s Seaver Wang, “In many cases the business
for these projects would be difficult to sustain on the defense
applications alone unless DOD is throwing tons of money to make those
projects too big to fail.”
</p>
<p>
The F-35 fighter
jet<a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3700059/dod-looks-to-establish-mine-to-magnet-supply-chain-for-rare-earth-materials/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">

<a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3700059/dod-looks-to-establish-mine-to-magnet-supply-chain-for-rare-earth-materials/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>around
900 pounds of rare earth elements,</u></a> and the Pentagon is looking
at maintaining a fleet of about 2,400. A single offshore wind turbine,
meanwhile, can use up to
<a href="https://www.windsystemsmag.com/24015-2/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>thousands
of pounds</u></a>. To get a sense of how much rare earth metal even a
modestly sized offshore wind operation requires, you’d have to look at
something like a destroyer, which needs over 5,000 pounds of them.
</p>
<p>
Not all analysts see a strong tension between the Trump administration’s
renewable energy policy and its critical minerals policy, however.
Morgan Bazilian, director of the Payne Institute and a public policy
professor at the Colorado School of Mines, told me that it was
“simplistic” to say “you need supply and demand to meet somewhere.”
</p>
<p>
“There’s still going to be a need for copper whether or not the U.S.
builds a lot of transmission lines,” Bazilian said. “There’s still going
to be the need for light and heavy rare earths, and there’s a need for
tellurium and nickel on global markets. The problem is not robust demand
in the United States, which is one piece of the pie.”
</p>
<p>
No matter what these minerals are used for or where their ultimate
destination is, the United States is desperately looking for any
foothold in mining and processing in order to compete with China, which
dominates many sectors of the industry.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>“What we need to do now is to get some domestic mining and
processing going,” Bazilian said. The U.S. “doesn’t have to be dominant
or be the biggest producer of these things. We need to get on the map a
little bit. We have precious little going on.”
</p>
<p>
<span></span>Even if U.S. demand slows, “I don’t think it will stop,”
Bazilian said. “I don’t see that in itself kneecapping anything.”
</p>
<p>
Regardless of the level of demand, it will need mines and processing
facilities to meet it, which requires permitting and financing. What
investors and companies looking to open mines and refining facilities
need is not just assurance of demand over the long term, Rorke
explained, but also the go-ahead to build.
</p>
<p>
“If you’re only focused on the demand side,” Rorke said, “you’re really
investing in a long-term problem because you are not matching it with
the supply that can come on to satisfy that demand over the long term.”

<p class="drop-caps">
Back in 2019, the year I bought my Tesla Model 3, Elon Musk was more
nuisance than accused neo-Nazi. He released an offbeat autotuned rap
<a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/4/1/18290425/elon-musk-rip-harambe-rap-song-hyperloop" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>song</u></a>
about Harambe the gorilla and was acquitted of defamation charges after
calling a rescuer in the Thailand cave incident of being a
“<a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/12/06/785747858/los-angeles-jury-finds-no-defamation-in-elon-musks-pedo-guy-tweet#:~:text=Jury%20Clears%20Elon%20Musk%20In,'Pedo%20Guy'%20Tweet%20:%20NPR&text=Hourly%20News-,Jury%20Clears%20Elon%20Musk%20In%20Defamation%20Suit%20Over%20'Pedo%20Guy,coach%20in%20Thailand%20last%20year." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pedo
guy</u></a>.” Both events feel eons ago in internet time. They also feel
ancient as part of the gradual progression of Tesla’s CEO from real-life
Tony Stark to right-wing agitator and propagandist.
</p>
<p>
Lots of people who purchased Tesla EVs before Musk took off the mask are
understandably miffed. Anyone who buys a Cybertruck and has been on the
internet before should know they’re driving an extension of Elon’s id.
But millions of people worldwide bought Teslas over the past several
years with no intention of puttering around in a MAGA machine. The
sentiment can be seen in the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/anti-elon-bumper-sticker-tesla" target="_self"><u>bumper
stickers</u></a> that now appear on Model 3s and Ys around blue states,
declaring some version of “I bought it before Elon was crazy.” A new
<a href="https://insideevs.com/news/747944/tesla-owners-musk-survey-netherlands/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>study</u></a>
in the Netherlands put a number to the notion: The survey found that one
in three Tesla owners wants to unload their cars rather than continue to
drive a vehicle associated with Musk.
</p>
<p>
This is a time when social media abounds with lists of companies to
avoid because of their political stances and contributions; anyone who
wants to vote with their wallet by not buying Tesla absolutely can and
probably should buy some other carmaker’s EV instead (unless Tesla,
which is slated to release its earning this week, winds up the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/musk-trump-tesla-tax-credits" target="_self"><u>last</u></a>
EV-maker standing). But don’t ditch your Model S or Y just to avoid
driving around in an advertisement for his company.
</p>
<p>
I’ve thought a lot about this as a Model 3 owner for five-plus years.
It’s not uncommon to meet someone who can’t wait to tell you they’d
never buy a Tesla because of Musk’s politics or noxious behavior on X.
Fair enough. But plenty of those people drive gas-only or hybrid
vehicles. The oil company CEOs who make money selling gasoline and
diesel have been far worse for the climate than Musk, even if his
Trump-ward turn is closing the gap. They just know enough not to tweet.
Or buy Twitter.
</p>
<p>
It certainly doesn’t make climate sense to dispose of a Tesla in favor
of a non-EV. But even trading one in for another company’s EV just to
get Musk out of your life is a bad deal. When you sell your car, it
becomes somebody else’s car. That person inherits the symbolic weight of
owning one of Musk’s products and takes over the Supercharging dole,
paying Tesla for energy every time they need to charge away from home.
More importantly, you’ll probably wind up purchasing a new EV that
needed a reasonable amount of carbon emissions to create (not to mention
water and other resources), and will need years of driving on cleaner
energy to make up for it. What’s gained in virtue signaling is lost in
carbon dioxide.
</p>
<p>
This personal conundrum is reminiscent of the macroeconomic controversy
over fossil fuel divestment, where universities, companies, and other
institutions have been pressured to rid themselves of investment that
support coal, oil, and gas. In theory, selling off such assets is
supposed to harm the fossil fuel industry. But as the <em><em>Harvard
Business Review</em></em>
<a href="https://hbr.org/2022/11/how-fossil-fuel-divestment-falls-short" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>writes</u></a>:
“What looks good on paper often falls short in practice. There’s one
major problem with divestment: Selling an asset requires someone to buy
it. In other words, for you to divest, someone else needs to invest.”
Institutions get to pat themselves on the back and tell constituents
they greened their portfolio, but the fossil fuel business carries on
unchanged.
</p>
<p>
In fact, the <em><em>Review</em></em> directly compares divestment to
the car problem. Companies, they say, should think about sunsetting
their fossil fuel investments rather than selling immediately just to
wash their hands of a dirty industry. It’s just like how driving an old
car into the ground is better than selling it — since selling requires
buying, and buying adds a new car to the roads.
</p>
<p>
So it goes for aging Teslas. You might feel a wave of satisfaction by
selling off your Model Y and derive great pleasure from not having to
think about Musk when you get in your car. But if, like me, you bought
an electric car for climate reasons, and it just so happened that a
Tesla was the most practical one you could get, then the best thing to
do once it’s paid off is to keep it as long as it will run.
</p>
<p>
An owner can keep more of their money from lining Musk’s pocket by
charging at home or at other companies’ DC fast-chargers instead of
Superchargers, or by having the vehicle repaired and serviced by
independent shops rather than by Tesla itself. But it is quite literally
not worth it to sell your Tesla just to avoid having to explain to other
people, or to yourself, why you drive one.

takes aim at DEI, COVID expulsions and transgender troops</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — U.S. President Donald Trump signed a series of executive
orders on Monday to remove diversity, equity and inclusion, DEI, from
the military, reinstate thousands of troops who were kicked out for
refusing COVID-19 vaccines during the pandemic, and take aim at
transgender troops.</p>
<p>Earlier on Monday, Pete Hegseth, who narrowly secured enough votes to
become defense secretary, referred to the names of Confederate generals
that were once used for two key bases during his remarks to reporters as
he entered the Pentagon on his first full day on the job.  </p>
<p>Trump signed the executive orders while flying back from Miami to
Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>One of the executive orders signed by Trump said that expressing a
“gender identity” different from an individual’s sex at birth did not
meet military standards.</p>
<p>While the order banned the use of “invented” pronouns in the
military, it did not answer basic questions including whether
transgender soldiers currently serving in the military would be allowed
to stay and, if not, how they would be removed.</p>
<p>Trump’s plans have been heavily criticized by advocacy groups, which
say his actions would be illegal.  </p>
<p>“President Trump has made clear that a key priority for his
administration is driving transgender people back into the closet and
out of public life altogether,” Joshua Block, with the ACLU, said
earlier on Monday.  </p>
<p>During his first term, Trump announced that he would ban transgender
troops from serving in the military. He did not fully follow through
with that ban  his administration froze their recruitment while allowing
serving personnel to remain.  </p>
<p>Biden overturned the decision when he took office in 2021.  </p>
<p>The military has about 1.3 million active-duty personnel, Department
of Defense data shows. While transgender rights advocates say there are
as many as 15,000 transgender service members, officials say the number
is in the low thousands.  </p>
<p>When Trump announced his first ban in 2017, he said the military
needed to focus on “decisive and overwhelming victory” without being
burdened by the “tremendous medical costs and disruption” of having
transgender personnel.</p>
<p>Internal focus  </p>
<p>Hegseth has promised to bring major changes to the Pentagon, and he
has made eliminating DEI from the military a top priority.  </p>
<p>Trump’s executive order on ending DEI in the military said service
academies would be required to teach “that America and its founding
documents remain the most powerful force for good in human history.”</p>
<p>The Air Force said on Sunday that it will resume instruction of
trainees using a video about the first Black airmen in the U.S.
military, known as the Tuskegee Airmen, which has passed review to
ensure compliance with Trump’s ban on DEI initiatives.</p>
<p>Hegseth was warmly greeted on the steps of the Pentagon by the top
U.S. military officer, Air Force General Charles Brown, whom Hegseth
criticized in his latest book. Asked if he might fire Brown, Hegseth
joked that he was standing right next to him.</p>
<p>“I’m standing with him right now. I look forward to working with
him,” as he patted Brown on the back.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Reuters has previously reported about the possibility of mass firing
among top brass, something Hegseth repeatedly refused to rule out during
his confirmation process.</p>
<p>Hegseth referred to Fort Moore and Fort Liberty by their previous
names, Fort Benning and Fort Bragg, while speaking with reporters.</p>
<p>The names honoring Confederate officers were changed under former
President Joe Biden as part of an effort to reexamine U.S. history and
the Confederate legacy.</p>
<p>“I’m thinking about the guys and gals in Guam, Germany, Fort Benning
and Fort Bragg,” Hegseth said.</p>
<p>Much of Hegseth’s focus at the Pentagon could be internal to the
military, including making good on Trump’s executive order on bringing
back troops discharged for refusing COVID vaccines.</p>
<p>Thousands of service members were removed from the military after the
Pentagon made the vaccine mandatory in 2021.</p>
<p>US missile defense</p>
<p>Trump also signed an executive order that “mandated a process to
develop an ‘American Iron Dome’.”</p>
<p>The short-range Iron Dome air defense system was built by Israel’s
Rafael Advanced Defense Systems with U.S. backing, and it was built to
intercept rockets fired by the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas in
Gaza toward Israel.</p>
<p>Each truck-towed unit fires radar-guided missiles to blow up
short-range threats such as rockets, mortars and drones in midair.</p>
<p>The system determines whether a rocket is on course to hit a
populated area. If not, the rocket is ignored and allowed to land
harmlessly.</p>
<p>Any such effort would take years to implement in the United
States.</p>

Justice Department says it has fired employees involved in prosecutions
of president</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Justice Department said Monday that it had fired
more than a dozen employees who worked on criminal prosecutions of
President Donald Trump, moving rapidly to pursue retribution against
lawyers involved in the investigations and signaling an early
willingness to take action favorable to the president’s personal
interests. </p>
<p>The abrupt termination targeting career prosecutors who worked on
special counsel Jack Smith’s team is the latest sign of upheaval inside
the Justice Department and is consistent with the administration’s
determination to purge the government of workers it perceives as
disloyal to the president. </p>
<p>The norm-shattering move, which follows the reassignment of multiple
senior career officials across divisions, was made even though
rank-and-file prosecutors by tradition remain with the department across
presidential administrations and are not punished by virtue of their
involvement in sensitive investigations. The firings are effective
immediately. </p>
<p>“Today, Acting Attorney General James McHenry terminated the
employment of a number of DOJ officials who played a significant role in
prosecuting President Trump,” said a statement from a Justice Department
official. “In light of their actions, the Acting Attorney General does
not trust these officials to assist in faithfully implementing the
President’s agenda. This action is consistent with the mission of ending
the weaponization of government.” </p>
<p>It was not immediately clear which prosecutors were affected by the
order, or how many who worked on the investigations into Trump remained
with the department as Trump took office last week. It was also not
immediately known how many of the fired prosecutors intended to
challenge the terminations by arguing that the department had cast aside
civil service protections afforded to federal employees. </p>
<p>The action was the latest effort to turn the table on criminal
investigations that for years shadowed Trump, resulting in separate
indictments that never went to trial and were ultimately abandoned. </p>
<p>On his first day in office, he issued sweeping pardons and sentence
commutations to the more than 1,500 supporters charged in the Jan. 6
riot at the U.S. Capitol, a massive clemency grant that benefited even
those found guilty of violent attacks on police, as well as leaders of
far-right extremist groups convicted of failed plots to keep the
Republican in power. </p>
<p>Trump has long sought to exert control over a Justice Department that
investigated him both during his first term as well as during the last
four years under former Attorney General Merrick Garland. He has
repeatedly said he expects loyalty from a law enforcement community
trained to put facts, evidence and the law ahead of politics. </p>
<p>He’s moved to put close allies in high-level positions, including
replacing his first FBI director, Christopher Wray, with loyalist Kash
Patel. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Trump’s pick for attorney general, Pam Bondi, said at her
confirmation hearing this month that she would not play politics but did
not rule out the potential for investigations into Trump adversaries
like Smith. </p>
<p>Smith resigned from the department earlier this month after
submitting a two-volume report on the twin investigations into Trump’s
efforts to undo the 2020 presidential election and his hoarding of
classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. At least one
other key member of the team, Jay Bratt, also retired from the
department this month after serving as a lead prosecutor in the
classified documents case. </p>
<p>Both the election interference case and the classified documents
prosecution were withdrawn by Smith’s team following Trump’s
presidential win in November, in keeping with longstanding Justice
Department policy. </p>
<p>The firings were first reported by Fox News.</p>

“The use of Federal resources to advance Marxist equity, transgenderism,
and green new deal social engineering policies is a waste of taxpayer
dollars that does not improve the day-to-day lives of those we serve,”
wrote the OMB’s acting director Matthew J. Vaeth. The pause will allow
agencies to review grant and loan programs and make sure they align with
President Trump’s many executive orders, which have sought to sharply
curtail climate initiatives and clean energy spending, among other
programs. Some experts say the order is too vague to be legal. Still, it
triggered panic and confusion across many state and local governments
and programs. “It will mean missed payrolls and rent payments and
everything in between,”

<li>Los Angeles grapples with toxic wildfire debris
</h3>
<p>
As Los Angeles starts down the long path to recovery after its
devastating wildfires, a debate is growing over what to do with all the
debris leftover from the blazes. Some people are considering hiring
private firms to clean up their properties, but that could cost some
$170,000, the <em><em>Los Angeles Times</em></em>

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is offering to clear away the debris
for free, and the Environmental Protection Agency is also working on the
cleanup, but officials warned locals at a town hall meeting Sunday that
the process could take up to 18 months. That timeline was met with
outrage. The EPA plans to send the debris to some L.A. County’s foothill
communities to be processed for disposal, but residents there aren’t
happy about the idea of being dumped with toxic wildfire waste. “The
potential risks associated with hazardous materials, particularly
lithium electric vehicle batteries, which are highly flammable and pose
environmental contamination risks, are a matter of significant concern,”

House pauses federal grant, loan other assistance programs</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Trump administration has temporarily paused grant,
loan and other financial assistance programs at the Office of Management
and Budget, according to a memo seen by Reuters, prompting criticism
from congressional Democrats.</p>
<p>The memo referenced the executive orders, including those seeking to
dismantle programs related to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI),
President Donald Trump has signed since taking office last week.</p>
<p>“In the interim, to the extent permissible under applicable law,
federal agencies must temporarily pause all activities related to
obligation or disbursement of all federal financial assistance, and
other relevant agency activities that may be impacted by the executive
orders, including, but not limited to, financial assistance for foreign
aid, nongovernmental organizations, DEI, woke gender ideology, and the
green new deal,” Matthew J. Vaeth, the acting director of the Office of
Management and Budget, wrote in the memo.</p>
<p>The suspension goes into effect on Jan. 28 at 5 p.m. eastern time,
according to the memo.</p>
<p>Top Democratic congressional budget appropriation lawmakers responded
to reports of the memo by sending a letter demanding the OMB reverse its
decision.</p>

sends air force planes to bring home migrants deported from the US</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A Colombian Air Force jet was expected to land back in the country
early Tuesday carrying 110 Colombians deported from the United
States.</p>
<p>The flight from San Diego, along with another traveling from Houston
back to Colombia, follows a dispute sparked Sunday when Colombian
President Gustavo Petro refused to allow U.S. military planes to send
deported Colombians back home.</p>
<p>Petro said such treatment was disrespectful. His refusal prompted
U.S. President Donald Trump to threaten to impose tariffs, which Petro
said he would reciprocate before the two countries announced they had
reached an agreement to defuse the situation.</p>
<p>Petro said the Colombian Air Force flights would allow the migrants
to travel home “without being handcuffed.”</p>
<p>“This provision: dignity for deportees, will be applied to all
countries that send deportations to us,” Petro said.</p>
<p>Trump has quickly moved to carry out deportations, one of his
campaign pledges, since taking office last week. He said Monday that if
countries do not accept their migrants fast, “they’ll pay a very high
economic price, and we’re going to immediately install massive
tariffs.”</p>
<p>While Colombia balked at the U.S. military flights, Guatemala has
accepted several U.S. Air Force flights carrying Guatemalan migrants
deported from the United States in recent days.</p>
<p>The latest flight took place Monday, with 64 Guatemalans returning
home.</p>
<p>Guatemala’s Vice President Karin Herrera said Monday she was
monitoring the care and condition of migrants arriving from the United
States.</p>
<p>“Guatemalan migrants are people with rights and dignity. Our
commitment is to guarantee that their arrival in the country, to their
land, is in the best conditions,” Herrera said.</p>
<p>U.S. deportation flights are not new, with U.S. Immigration and
Customs Enforcement carrying out hundreds of the flights each year. But
the use of military flights is new, with the agency previously using
commercial and chartered flights to deport people who are illegally in
the United States.</p>

and Lammy reaffirm US-UK partnership on Indo-Pacific security, China
challenges</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>State Department — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke with his
British counterpart, Foreign Secretary David Lammy, on Monday to discuss
a range of pressing global issues and joint initiatives aimed at
promoting a free and open Indo-Pacific that is secure and stable.</p>
<p>“They affirmed the depth of the U.S.-UK Special Relationship and the
crucial nature of our partnership in addressing issues like the conflict
in the Middle East, Russia’s war against Ukraine, and China’s malign
influence,” State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a
statement.</p>
<p>The U.K. government said that Lammy and Rubio look forward to meeting
in person soon.</p>
<p>“They both welcomed the opportunity for the UK and the US to work
together in alignment to address shared challenges including the
situation in the Middle East, Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine, the
challenges posed by China and the need for Indo-Pacific security,” the
British statement read.</p>
<p>The call between Rubio and Lammy came amid a report by The Guardian
that China’s Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, is expected to visit Britain
next month for the first U.K.-China strategic dialogue since 2018.</p>
<p>In Beijing, Chinese officials did not confirm Wang’s plans to visit
the U.K. but noted what they described as “sound and steady growth” in
relations between the two countries.</p>
<p>“China and the U.K. are both permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council and major economies in the world,” Mao Ning, spokesperson for
the Chinese Foreign Ministry, stated during a briefing on Monday. She
added it is in the common interest of the two countries to enhance
strategic communication and deepen political mutual trust.</p>
<p>Wang is expected to attend the Munich Security Conference between
Feb. 14 and 16, making it likely that his visit to the U.K. will take
place either before or after the event.</p>
<p>In the past, U.S. Secretaries of State have typically attended the
high-profile annual gathering at the Munich Security Conference.</p>
<p>The State Department has not responded to VOA’s inquiry about whether
Rubio plans to hold talks with Wang during the conference.</p>
<p>Last week, the State Department outlined U.S. policy toward China
under President Donald Trump’s administration. </p>
<p>“Strategic competition is the frame through which the United States
views its relationship with the People’s Republic of China (PRC). The
United States will address its relationship with the PRC from a position
of strength in which we work closely with our allies and partners to
defend our interests and values,” the State Department said on
Jan. 20.</p>

id="chinas-deepseek-ai-rattles-wall-street-but-questions-remain">China’s
DeepSeek AI rattles Wall Street, but questions remain</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Chinese researchers backed by a Hangzhou-based hedge fund recently
released a new version of a large language model (LLM) called
DeepSeek-R1 that rivals the capabilities of the most advanced U.S.-built
products but reportedly does so with fewer computing resources and at
much lower cost.</p>
<p>High Flyer, the hedge fund that backs DeepSeek, said that the model
nearly matches the performance of LLMs built by U.S. firms like OpenAI,
Google and Meta, but does so using only about 2,000 older generation
computer chips manufactured by U.S.-based industry leader Nvidia while
costing only about $6 million worth of computing power to train.</p>
<p>By comparison, Meta’s AI system, Llama, uses about 16,000 chips, and
reportedly costs Meta vastly more money to train.</p>
<p>Open-source model</p>
<p>The apparent advance in Chinese AI capabilities comes after years of
efforts by the U.S. government to restrict China’s access to advanced
semiconductors and the equipment used to manufacture them. Over the past
two years, under President Joe Biden, the U.S. put multiple export
control measures in place with the specific aim of throttling China’s
progress on AI development.</p>
<p>DeepSeek appears to have innovated its way to some of its success,
developing new and more efficient algorithms that allow the chips in the
system to communicate with each other more effectively, thereby
improving performance.</p>
<p>At least some of what DeepSeek R1’s developers did to improve its
performance is visible to observers outside the company, because the
model is open source, meaning that the algorithms it uses to answer
queries are public.</p>
<p>Market reaction</p>
<p>The news about DeepSeek’s capabilities sparked a broad sell-off of
technology stocks on U.S. markets on Monday, as investors began to
question whether U.S. companies’ well-publicized plans to invest
hundreds of billions of dollars in AI data centers and other
infrastructure would preserve their dominance in the field. When the
markets closed on Monday, the tech-heavy Nasdaq index was down by 3.1%,
and Nvidia’s share price had plummeted by nearly 17%.</p>
<p>However, not all AI experts believe the markets’ reaction to the
release of DeepSeek R1 is justified, or that the claims about the
model’s development should be taken at face value.</p>
<p>Mel Morris, CEO of U.K.-based Corpora.ai, an AI research engine, told
VOA that while DeepSeek is an impressive piece of technology, he
believes the market reaction has been excessive and that more
information is needed to accurately judge the impact DeepSeek will have
on the AI market.</p>
<p>“There’s always an overreaction to things, and there is today, so
let’s just step back and analyze what we’re seeing here,” Morris said.
“Firstly, we have no real understanding of exactly what the cost was or
the time scale involved in building this product. We just don’t know. …
They claim that it’s significantly cheaper and more efficient, but we
have no proof of that.”</p>
<p>Morris said that while DeepSeek’s performance may be comparable to
that of OpenAI products, “I’ve not seen anything yet that convinces me
that they’ve actually cracked the quantum step in the cost of operating
these sorts of models.”</p>
<p>Doubts about origins</p>
<p>Lennart Heim, a data scientist with the RAND Corporation, told VOA
that while it is plain that DeepSeek R1 benefits from innovative
algorithms that boost its performance, he agreed that the general public
actually knows relatively little about how the underlying technology was
developed.</p>
<p>Heim said that it is unclear whether the $6 million training cost
cited by High Flyer actually covers the whole of the company’s
expenditures — including personnel, training data costs and other
factors — or is just an estimate of what a final training “run” would
have cost in terms of raw computing power. If the latter, Heim said, the
figure is comparable to the costs incurred by better U.S. models.</p>
<p>He also questioned the assertion that DeepSeek was developed with
only 2,000 chips. In a blog post written over the weekend, he noted that
the company is believed to have existing operations with tens of
thousands of Nvidia chips that could have been used to do the work
necessary to develop a model that is capable of running on just
2,000.</p>
<p>“This extensive compute access was likely crucial for developing
their efficiency techniques through trial and error and for serving
their models to customers,” he wrote.</p>
<p>He also pointed out that the company’s decision to release version R1
of its LLM last week — on the heels of the inauguration of a new U.S.
president — appeared political in nature. He said that it was “clearly
intended to rattle the public’s confidence in the United States’ AI
leadership during a pivotal moment in U.S. policy.”</p>
<p>Dean W. Ball, a research fellow at George Mason University’s Mercatus
Center, was also cautious about declaring that DeepSeek R1 has somehow
upended the AI landscape.</p>
<p>“I think Silicon Valley and Wall Street are overreacting to some
extent,” he told VOA. “But at the end of the day, R1 means that the
competition between the U.S. and China is likely to remain fierce, and
that we need to take it seriously.”</p>
<p>Export control debate</p>
<p>The apparent success of DeepSeek has been used as evidence by some
experts to suggest that the export controls put in place under the Biden
administration may not have had the intended effects.</p>
<p>“At a minimum, this suggests that U.S. approaches to AI and export
controls may not be as effective as proponents claim,” Paul Triolo, a
partner with DGA-Albright Stonebridge Group, told VOA.</p>
<p>“The availability of very good but not cutting-edge GPUs — for
example, that a company like DeepSeek can optimize for specific training
and inference workloads — suggests that the focus of export controls on
the most advanced hardware and models may be misplaced,” Triolo said.
“That said, it remains unclear how DeepSeek will be able to keep pace
with global leaders such as OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Mistral, Meta and
others that will continue to have access to the best hardware
systems.”</p>
<p>Other experts, however, argued that export controls have simply not
been in place long enough to show results.</p>
<p>Sam Bresnick, a research fellow at Georgetown’s University’s Center
for Security and Emerging Technology told VOA that it would be “very
premature” to call the measures a failure.</p>
<p>“The CEO of DeepSeek has gone on record saying the biggest constraint
they face is access to high-level compute resources,” Bresnick said. “If
[DeepSeek] had as much compute at their fingertips as Google, Microsoft,
OpenAI, etc, there would be a significant boost in their performance. So
… I don’t think that DeepSeek is the smoking gun that some people are
claiming it is [to show that export controls] do not work.”</p>
<p>Bresnick noted that the toughest export controls were imposed in only
2023, meaning that their effects may just be starting to be felt. He
said that the real test of their effectiveness will be whether U.S.
firms are able to continue to outpace China in coming years.</p>

<h2 id="cdc-ordered-to-stop-working-with-who-immediately">CDC ordered to
stop working with WHO immediately</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — U.S. public health officials have been told to stop
working with the World Health Organization, effective immediately.</p>
<p>A U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official, John
Nkengasong, sent a memo to senior leaders at the agency on Sunday night
telling them that all staff who work with the WHO must immediately stop
their collaborations and “await further guidance.”</p>
<p>Experts said the sudden stoppage was a surprise and would set back
work on investigating and trying to stop outbreaks of Marburg virus and
mpox in Africa, as well as brewing global threats. It also comes as
health authorities around the world are monitoring bird flu outbreaks
among U.S. livestock.</p>
<p>The Associated Press viewed a copy of Nkengasong’s memo, which said
the stop-work policy applied to “all CDC staff engaging with WHO through
technical working groups, coordinating centers, advisory boards,
cooperative agreements or other means — in person or virtual.” It also
says CDC staff are not allowed to visit WHO offices.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump last week issued an executive order to begin
the process of withdrawing the U.S. from WHO, but that did not take
immediate effect. Leaving WHO requires the approval of Congress and that
the U.S. meets its financial obligations for the current fiscal year.
The U.S. also must provide a one-year notice.</p>
<p>His administration also told federal health agencies to stop most
communications with the public through at least the end of the
month.</p>
<p>“Stopping communications and meetings with WHO is a big problem,”
said Dr. Jeffrey Klausner, a University of Southern California public
health expert who collaborates with WHO on work against sexually
transmitted infections.</p>
<p>“People thought there would be a slow withdrawal. This has really
caught everyone with their pants down,” said Klausner, who said he
learned of it from someone at CDC.</p>
<p>“Talking to WHO is a two-way street,” he added, noting that the two
agencies benefit from each other’s expertise. The collaboration allows
the U.S. to learn about new tests, new treatments and emerging outbreaks
— information “which can help us protect Americans abroad and at home,”
Klausner said.</p>
<p>The CDC details nearly 30 people to WHO and sends many millions of
dollars to it through cooperative agreements. The U.S. agency also has
some of the world’s leading experts in infectious diseases and public
health threats, and the two agencies’ staffers are in daily contact
about health dangers and how to stop them.</p>
<p>The collaboration halt isn’t the only global health effect of Trump’s
executive orders. Last week, the president froze spending on another
critical program, PEPFAR or the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS
Relief.</p>
<p>The anti-HIV program is credited with saving 25 million lives,
including those of 5.5 million children, since it was started by
Republican President George W. Bush. It was included in a Trump
administration freeze on foreign aid spending slated to last at least
three months.</p>
<p>PEPFAR provides HIV medication to more than 20 million people “and
stopping its funding essentially stops their HIV treatment,”
International AIDS Society President Beatriz Grinsztejn said in a
statement. “If that happens, people are going to die and HIV will
resurge.”</p>
<p>A U.S. health official confirmed that the CDC was stopping its work
with WHO. The person was not authorized to talk about the memo and spoke
on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>A WHO spokesperson referred questions about the withdrawal to U.S.
officials.</p>
<p>Officials at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services didn’t
immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. And CDC officials
didn’t respond to the AP’s request to speak with Nkengasong about the
memo.</p>

Maps to rename ‘Gulf of Mexico’ to ‘Gulf of America’ for US users</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Google Maps will change the name of “Gulf of Mexico” to
“Gulf of America” once it is officially updated in the U.S. Geographic
Names System, it said in an X post on Monday.</p>
<p>The change will be visible in the U.S., but it will remain “Gulf of
Mexico” in Mexico. Outside of the two countries, users will see both
names.</p>
<p>The Trump administration’s Interior Department said on Friday it had
officially changed the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of
America, and the Alaskan peak Denali to Mount McKinley.</p>
<p>Google Maps, which is owned by Alphabet’s Google, will make a similar
change with Mount McKinley.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump ordered the name changes as part of a flurry
of executive actions hours after taking office last Monday, making good
on a campaign promise.</p>
<p>“As directed by the President, the Gulf of Mexico will now officially
be known as the Gulf of America and North America’s highest peak will
once again bear the name Mount McKinley,” the Interior Department said
in a statement last week.</p>

replica of Anne Frank’s hidden annex opens in New York City</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — A full-scale replica of the secret annex where Anne Frank
penned her famous diary opened in New York City on Monday as the world
marked International Holocaust Remembrance Day.</p>
<p>The exhibit at the Center for Jewish History in Manhattan represents
the first time the annex has been completely recreated outside of
Amsterdam, where the space is a central part of the Anne Frank House
museum.</p>
<p>But while the original annex has been intentionally left empty, the
New York reconstruction shows the five rooms as they would have looked
while the Frank family and others lived in hiding.</p>
<p>The spaces are filled with furniture and possessions, including a
reconstruction of the writing desk where Frank wrote her diary.</p>
<p>Ronald Leopold, director of the Anne Frank House, said furnishing the
recreated space was important to tell Anne’s story in a new and
immersive way, especially for those who may not get to visit the
Amsterdam museum, which also houses Frank’s original diary.</p>
<p>“We very much hope that we will be able to touch people’s hearts
here, because education is the focus of this exhibition,” Leopold said
at Monday’s opening. “And education starts with empathy — empathy with
what happened here, what happened in Amsterdam during those years, what
was done to Anne Frank.”</p>
<p>The Frank family hid with other Jews for two years in the attic of
patriarch Otto Frank’s office in Amsterdam as the Nazi German army
occupied the Netherlands during World War II.</p>
<p>They were eventually discovered in 1944 and sent to concentration
camps, including Auschwitz-Birkenau, which was liberated by Soviet
troops 80 years ago Monday. Anne and her older sister Margot died of
typhus at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1945.</p>
<p>Their father, Otto, was the only person from the annex to survive the
Holocaust. After the war, he published his 15-year-old daughter’s diary,
which is considered one of the most important works of the 20th century.
Frank died in 1980 at the age of 91.</p>
<p>Hannah-Milena Elias, the granddaughter of Anne Frank’s cousin, Buddy
Elias, said she found it emotional walking through the exhibit
rooms.</p>
<p>“It is quite overwhelming and quite touching to see what a tiny space
the families had to stay in and live for more than two years,” said the
29-year-old, who lives in Switzerland.</p>
<p>Her sister, Leyv-Anouk Elias, hoped the exhibit would encourage
visitors to reflect on what it means to face discrimination or be a
minority today.</p>
<p>“History, unfortunately, is repeating itself in different ways,” the
27-year-old Berlin resident said. “We have to be very, very careful how
to act and to do stuff against it, to not ever make this happen
again.”</p>
<p>The New York exhibit, which runs through April 30, spans more than
696 square meters (7,500 square feet) and includes more than 100 photos
and other artifacts — many never before displayed publicly, according to
officials.</p>
<p>Among the items are Anne Frank’s first photo album and her
handwritten poetry, as well as a replica of her famous diary. There are
also nearly 80 translated editions of her diary and even the Oscar won
by Shelley Winters for the 1959 film The Diary of Anne Frank.</p>
<p>The installation is presented chronologically, tracing the Frank
family’s life in Germany through the rise of the Nazi regime, the
family’s flight to Amsterdam and their life in hiding and eventual
capture.</p>
<p>Henry Byrne, a junior at Xavier, a Catholic high school in Manhattan,
said learning about the family’s saga helped him grasp the enormity of
the Holocaust.</p>
<p>“It taught me a lot about how just because you see one story, walk
into these rooms and all the beds and the tables, that’s just one
person’s life,” the 16-year-old said. “And there were millions that were
lost.”</p>

id="scott-bessent-wins-senate-confirmation-as-us-treasury-secretary">Scott
Bessent wins Senate confirmation as US Treasury secretary</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The U.S. Senate on Monday confirmed Scott Bessent to be President
Donald Trump’s Treasury secretary, giving the billionaire hedge fund
manager a central role in shaping the new administration’s policy
ambitions around tax cuts and spending and managing economic
relationships with allies and adversaries alike.</p>
<p>As the 79th Treasury secretary, Bessent will have sway over the
nation’s tax collections and its $28 trillion Treasury debt market, with
vast influence over fiscal policy, financial regulations, international
sanctions and investments from overseas.</p>
<p>The vote was 68-29, with 16 Democrats supporting the nomination.</p>
<p>Bessent, 62, is already shaping up to be a forceful advocate for
Trump’s economic agenda, which centers on reducing taxes and imposing
steep tariffs that Democrats, and some economists, argue could undo some
of the progress the Federal Reserve has made in getting inflation under
control.</p>
<p>In his confirmation hearing, Bessent warned that failure to renew $4
trillion in tax cuts expiring at the end of this year would be a
“calamity” for middle-class Americans, and made the case that tariffs
would help combat unfair trade practices, increase revenues, and bolster
U.S. leverage in international negotiations.</p>
<p>He also pushed back against the idea that Trump’s policies would be
inflationary, and said that the administration’s efforts to increase oil
production would actually help bring down prices.</p>
<p>As Trump’s top economic official, Bessent will face a range of
challenges, the most immediate of which will be managing federal cash
flows after the government hit its statutory debt limit on Trump’s
second day in office. Even before he was sworn in, the Treasury
Department was using “extraordinary measures” to avoid breaching the cap
and triggering a catastrophic default. Bessent told senators in his
confirmation hearing that there would be no default on his watch.</p>
<p>Bessent will also need to deal with the prospect of rising budget
deficits and added government debt estimated to run into the trillions
of dollars, if tax cut extensions and other promised tax breaks cannot
be offset by revenue increases or spending cuts. If precedent holds, he
will be a central actor working with Congress on the size and shape of
any tax reforms.</p>
<p>More than 60% of the federal debt is scheduled to roll over on his
watch — and that’s before taking into account issuance growth that has
been running at more than $2 trillion a year since the COVID-19
pandemic.</p>
<p>‘Out of control’</p>
<p>Worries about rising budget deficits and stickier inflation have in
recent weeks sent long-term bond yields up as investors demand more
compensation for risk. That in turn has driven up the average rate on
30-year fixed-rate mortgages to more than 7%, a pain point with saliency
for Americans looking to buy a home.</p>
<p>Bessent used his confirmation hearing to talk tough on deficits,
declaring that government spending is “out of control,” though it is not
clear how much he could do to rein it in. He backed Trump’s pledge not
to touch the Social Security retirement program and Medicare insurance
plan for seniors, among the biggest line items in the federal budget,
along with interest expense, determined by market rates that the
Treasury does not control.</p>
<p>Born and raised in South Carolina, Bessent says he still listens to
farm radio. He earned a bachelor’s degree in political science from Yale
University and has spent his career in finance, working for investors
George Soros and Jim Chanos, and running his own firm Key Square.
Bessent — as fifth in line to the presidency — is also the highest
ranking openly gay federal official in history. He is married with two
children.</p>

id="earthquake-rattles-houses-in-maine-felt-as-far-away-as-pennsylvania">Earthquake
rattles houses in Maine, felt as far away as Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SCARBOROUGH, Maine — A 3.8-magnitude earthquake centered near the
Maine coast rattled houses in northern New England on Monday and was
felt by surprised residents of states hundreds of miles away. </p>
<p>The earthquake took place at about 10:22 a.m. Monday and was centered
about six miles (10 kilometers) southeast of York Harbor in southern
Maine, the United States Geological Survey reported. It was reported at
a depth of about eight miles (13 kilometers) the survey said. </p>
<p>Officials said the quake could be felt in every state in New England
and as far away as Pennsylvania. In southern Maine, many residents
reported feeling houses and buildings shake as the surprising earthquake
interrupted a sunny winter morning. </p>
<p>The quake sent residents and officials in Maine and New Hampshire
looking to assess any possible damage. In most cases, residents and
businesses reported confusion over what had happened. Many shared
stories on social media indicating they initially thought there may have
been a nearby car accident or possibly an explosion. </p>
<p>The Maine Emergency Management Agency asked residents to only call
911 in the event of an emergency. The earthquake did not appear to cause
any major damage, said Vanessa Corson, a spokesperson for the agency.
Corson also said local emergency management agencies did not report any
damage. </p>
<p>New Hampshire’s Department of Safety said the state’s 911 number did
not receive any calls about damage or injuries. </p>
<p>“We have not received word of any issues. We’ve spoken with the
directors at York and Cumberland County EMA, and everything seems to be
in order,” Corson said. </p>
<p>Justine Wenger, a freelance copywriter working from her Scarborough
home, said she was texting with a friend when she felt the earthquake.
The vibrations lasted about 30 seconds and shook her house. At first,
she thought it was a passing truck, then feared her furnace might blow
up so she went out onto her deck. </p>
<p>“I wasn’t terrified, but this felt different than a normal rumbling,”
she said. “It felt substantial. There was an instinct to get out of the
house.” </p>
<p>Authorities said residents who felt the earthquake could report it to
the USGS website. Earthquakes in the center and eastern parts of the
U.S. are less frequent than in western states, but they are typically
felt over a much broader region, the survey said on its website. </p>
<p>It’s common for there to be two small earthquakes a year in New
England, the survey said. A slightly stronger earthquake based in New
Jersey shook the Northeast in April. </p>
<p>“People in New England, and in its geological extension southward
through Long Island, have felt small earthquakes and suffered damage
from infrequent larger ones since colonial times,” according to the
survey’s website. </p>
<p>An earthquake of close to 4.0 or slightly higher in magnitude in the
Northeast states “is not particularly common, but it’s not all that
rare, either,” said Maureen Long, the chair of the Department of Earth
and Planetary Sciences at Yale University. Long cited the April
earthquake in New Jersey as an example. </p>
<p>A 2002 earthquake in upstate New York was measured at a magnitude of
5.1. There was also a magnitude 4.7 event near Hollis Center, Maine, in
2012, Long said. </p>
<p>Residents of cities including Boston and Providence, Rhode Island,
also reported feeling the quake. </p>
<p>In Kennebunk, Maine, school superintendent Terri Cooper assured
parents via e-mail that staff was looking through schools for any damage
and everything seemed fine. </p>
<p>“Our operations department has checked all district buildings and
systems to ensure they are in working order and no damage has been
discovered,” Cooper’s e-mail said.</p>

id="woman-gets-more-than-3-year-prison-term-in-us-birthright-tourism-case">Woman
gets more than 3-year prison term in ‘US birthright tourism’ case</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Los Angeles — A California woman was sentenced Monday to more than 3
years in prison in a long-running case over a business that helped
pregnant Chinese women travel to the United States to deliver babies who
automatically became American citizens. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge R. Gary Klausner gave Phoebe Dong a 41-month
sentence and ordered her immediately taken into custody from his federal
court in Los Angeles. Dong and her husband were convicted in September
of conspiracy and money laundering through their company, USA Happy
Baby. </p>
<p>The sentencing came as birthright citizenship has been thrust into
the spotlight in the United States with the return of President Donald
Trump to the White House. Since taking office, Trump issued an executive
order to narrow the definition of birthright citizenship, a move quickly
blocked by a federal judge who called it “blatantly
unconstitutional.” </p>
<p>Dong and her husband, Michael Liu, were among more than a dozen
people charged in an Obama-era crackdown on so-called “birth tourism”
schemes that helped Chinese women hide their pregnancies while traveling
to the United States to give birth. Such businesses have long operated
in various states catering to people from China, Russia, Nigeria and
elsewhere. </p>
<p>Under the 14th Amendment, any child born in the United States is an
American citizen. Many have seen these trips as a way to help their
children secure a U.S. college education and a better future —
especially since the tourists themselves can apply for permanent
residency once the children turn 21. </p>
<p>During her sentencing hearing, Dong wiped away tears as she recalled
growing up without siblings due to China’s strict “one-child” policy and
told the court that the Chinese government forced her mother to have an
abortion. Moving to the United States was challenging, she said, but
Dong grew hopeful after having children of her own and saw she could
help Chinese women who want to have additional children in
California. </p>
<p>“I don’t want to lose my kids,” she told the court. “I hope you can
give me fair judgment. I will take all my responsibility.” </p>
<p>Federal prosecutors sought a more than five-year sentence for Dong
and argued that she and Liu helped more than 100 pregnant Chinese women
travel to the United States. They said the pair worked with others to
coach women on how to trick customs officials by flying into airports
believed to be more lax while wearing loose-fitting clothing to hide
their pregnancies. </p>
<p>“For tens of thousands of dollars each, defendant helped her numerous
customers deceive U.S. authorities and buy U.S. citizenship for their
children,” prosecutors said in court filings. They declined to comment
after the sentencing. </p>
<p>In December, Liu was also sentenced to 41 months in prison. Dong’s
lawyer, John McNicholas, asked that she be allowed to serve her term
after Liu completes his sentence because of their three children. The
youngest is 13. </p>
<p>Federal prosecutor Kevin Fu agreed to the delay, but Klausner refused
and had her taken into custody immediately. Dong removed a necklace and
gave it to a family member before she was led away. </p>
<p>The USA Happy Baby case was part of a broader probe into businesses
that helped Chinese women travel to give birth in California. The
operator of another business is believed to have fled to China,
McNicholas wrote in court filings, while another was sentenced in 2019
to 10 months in prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy and visa
fraud for running the company known as “You Win USA.” </p>
<p>McNicholas said he feels Dong was given a much longer sentence
because the government and Klausner blame her for the babies that were
born U.S. citizens. That, he said, is unrelated to the allegations that
she and Liu helped women travel to the United States to give birth. </p>
<p>“Our position was these children are born in America. They’re
citizens,” McNicholas said, adding that Dong will appeal. “Implicitly,
he’s saying being born here is not enough.”</p>

intelligence advocates have not been deterred from their claims of a
utopian future made possible by AI. Whatever problems we face —
including climate change — one day, we are told, they will be solved by
the magical power of computing. The breathless headlines have been
around for years:
“<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/artificial-intelligence-climate-change" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>How

Artificial intelligence can’t solve climate change because doing so will
always require passing through the bottleneck of politics.

For those hoping to bring us to a glorious future guided by

much as the entire nation of Japan, the world’s fourth-largest economy.
Countries around the world are rushing to develop their own AI systems
(the surprising capabilities of a new Chinese system called DeepSeek
just sent the stock market
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/27/tech/deepseek-stocks-ai-china/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>tumbling</u></a>),
any of which could entail the same scale of energy demand as the ones
created by American tech giants.
</p>
<p>
But imagine if we could snap our fingers and make that problem
disappear? That’s what OpenAI CEO Sam Altman suggested in a recent
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2025-sam-altman-interview" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>interview</u></a>
with <em><em>Bloomberg</em></em>. “Fusion’s going to work,” he said when
asked about AI’s energy demands, going on to say that “quickly
permitting fusion reactors” is the answer — particularly those made by
Helion Energy, a company whose executive chairman is, you guessed it,
Sam Altman.
</p>
<p>
Of course, Helion has no fusion reactors to permit yet because no one
does. Fusion’s promise of essentially limitless clean energy at low cost
is tantalizing, which is why billions of public and private dollars have
been
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/fusion" target="_self"><u>invested</u></a>
in fusion research. But while technological gains are being made, there
is still a great deal of uncertainty about how long it will take until
fusion can reach commercial scale. It might be 10 years, or 20, or 50 or
100 — no one knows for sure.
</p>
<p>
But blithely insisting that incredibly complex problems will be solved
easily and quickly is a specialty of tech barons. And if AI itself finds
the solution to our energy problems? Even better.
</p>
<p>
There’s no question that AI is improving at a rapid pace, even if there
are some things it’s still terrible at. And when it comes to climate,
over time it will probably help produce incremental gains across a wide
number of areas, from manufacturing efficiency to
<a href="https://www.archdaily.com/1012951/artificial-intelligence-and-urban-planning-technology-as-a-tool-for-city-design" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>urban
planning</u></a>. But the more dramatic and consequential any idea is —
whether it comes from AI or not — the more likely it is that it will
have to move through the political process in order to be implemented.
</p>
<p>
And that’s where AI can’t help. A machine learning system can’t tell you
the precise formula to please a recalcitrant senator or navigate a
hundred city councils with different ideas about what kinds of clean
energy projects they’ll allow in their towns. Politics is about people —
their goals, their incentives, their fears, their prejudices — and it’s
far too messy to be solved with numeric calculation, even by the most
powerful AI system imaginable.
</p>
<p>
Let’s say that a year from now, an AI came up with both an entirely new
way to design a fusion reactor and a revolutionary battery design that
offered longer and denser storage, together solving so many of the
problems scientists and engineers struggle with today. How would the
fossil fuel industry react to this development? Would it say, “Oh well,
oil and gas had a pretty good run, but now the world can move on”?
</p>
<p>
Of course not. It would use its extraordinary resources to battle
against their competition, just as they always have. That’s what it did
in the last election cycle, when it spent
<a href="https://climatepower.us/research-polling/big-oil-spent-450-million-to-influence-trump-the-119th-congress/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$450
million</u></a> on campaigns and lobbying to preserve the industry and
the riches it generates.
</p>
<p>
And while many hoped that the Republican Party would moderate its views
on climate, at the moment it looks more like it is going backward — not
just looking to undo every bit of progress made under the Biden
administration, but also undermining renewable energy wherever it can.
President Trump seems determined to
<a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/spotlight/trump-executive-order-wind" target="_self"><u>destroy
wind energy</u></a> in America, which has been growing rapidly in recent
years. Whether he succeeds will be up to the political system, not the
inherent usefulness of a millennium-old technology.
</p>
<p>
In politics, good ideas don’t always win out. Who has power and what
they are after will always matter a great deal, as Trump and the people
he is bringing into the federal government are showing us right now.
</p>
<p>
AI can be a tool that helps us reduce emissions and mitigate the effects
of climate change; the fact that its boosters regularly offer absurdly
optimistic timelines for societal transformation doesn’t mean the
underlying technology isn’t remarkable. But “solving” climate change
isn’t merely a technological problem. It will always be a political one
as well, and even the smartest piece of software won’t solve it for us.

id="trumps-sanctions-could-force-russias-putin-to-negotiating-table-some-experts-say">Trump’s
sanctions could force Russia’s Putin to negotiating table, some experts
say</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — On Jan. 22, Donald Trump — just two days after being
inaugurated for his second term as U.S. president — again called on
Russian President Vladimir Putin to negotiate an end to the “ridiculous”
war with Ukraine, but this time he added a threat.</p>
<p>“If we don’t make a ‘deal,’ and soon, I have no other choice but to
put high levels of Taxes, Tariffs, and Sanctions on anything being sold
by Russia to the United States, and various other participating
countries,” Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social.</p>
<p>The following day, Trump told reporters that Ukrainian President
Volodymyr Zelenskyy had told him he’s ready to negotiate an end to the
war. In an interview with Fox News aired that same day, Trump said
Zelenskyy is “no angel” and “shouldn’t have allowed this war to
happen.”</p>
<p>Does the new U.S. administration have sufficient economic leverage
over Russia to force it to make peace, or at least talk about peace?</p>
<p>According to Konstantin Sonin, John Dewey distinguished service
professor at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy
and former vice rector of Moscow’s Higher School of Economics, the U.S.
has economic leverage, but some of its levers are clearly weaker than
others.</p>
<p>“Russia’s trade with the U.S. is very small — less than $3 billion a
year,” he told Danila Galperovich of VOA’s Russian Service.
“Accordingly, even if any opportunity for U.S. companies to trade with
Russia is completely closed, the damage to Russia will be small. There
is an opportunity to strengthen secondary sanctions — that is,
additional pressure, first of all, on China, on India, on other
countries, so that they more strictly comply with the primary
sanctions.</p>
<p>“There is also an opportunity to continue what [former U.S. President
Joe] Biden did with sanctions against the Russian shadow tanker fleet,”
Sonin added, referring to vessels that Russia uses to sell oil and evade
Western sanctions.</p>
<p>“This requires great international cooperation, but, in principle, it
can be done,” said Sonin.</p>
<p>Economist Vladislav Inozemtsev, a special adviser to the Russian
Media Studies Project at MEMRI, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, and
director of the Moscow-based Center for Post-Industrial Studies, also
stressed the significance of secondary sanctions on countries that do
business with Russia.</p>
<p>“Trump can somehow influence other countries so that they do not buy
Russian products,” Inozemtsev told VOA. “For example, let’s say he can
say that if India buys Russian oil, then the United States will impose
15% duties on all goods from India. This would have the most radical
consequences. [I]f… countries trading with Russia are getting serious
problems in the United States for all their products, then I think that
this will be a very sobering moment. If it is possible to impose a
virtually complete trade blockade through U.S. sanctions, then these
will be devastating sanctions, of course.”</p>
<p>Sonin said that, over the longer term, deregulating oil production
internationally would reduce world oil prices and thereby hinder
Moscow’s ability to finance its military operations against Ukraine.</p>
<p>“Trump is famous for his good relations with Saudi Arabia, although
they are unlikely to be so good that they will reduce oil prices at his
request,” he said. “But nevertheless, it is possible to work towards
lowering oil prices, which even without sanctions will reduce Russian
income.”</p>
<p>Trump spoke with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in a Jan. 22
telephone call.</p>
<p>Still, Sonin said that economic levers, in and of themselves, cannot
force Putin to do anything. “I would say that the most direct impact is
still the supply of more powerful weapons to Ukraine. I do not know to
what extent Trump wants to do this, but he mentioned it, and, in
principle, it is possible to supply Ukraine with more powerful weapons
in larger quantities.”</p>
<p>Inozemtsev, however, said that Putin, who has not previously changed
his behavior in response to ultimatums, could do so this time.</p>
<p>“Trump is a person whose degree of radicalism and unpredictability
corresponds to Putin’s,” he said. “Here, perhaps, it would be better for
Putin to change his mind a bit. If Trump offers him: ‘Vladimir, let’s
go, we’ll meet there, sit down at the negotiating table, bring your
team, I’ll bring mine, and we’ll agree on something, we’ll discuss it
for a day or two, but the issue needs to be resolved,’ I think Putin
will go.”</p>

DeepSeek Ends the Party for U.S. Energy Stocks</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-27, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTk5ODAyOS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0NTI0MjcwOX0.wy9pZ8gIj8YbRCBEtspKggrzhHxhmUL--WhF_RJdciY/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
It’s not just tech stocks that are reeling after the release of Chinese
artificial intelligence company DeepSeek’s open-source R1 model, which
performs similarly to state-of-the-art models from American companies
while using less expensive hardware far more efficiently. Energy and
infrastructure companies — whose share prices had soared in the past
year on the promise of powering a massive artificial intelligence
buildout — have also seen their stock prices fall early Monday.
</p>
<p>
Shares in GE Vernova, which manufactures turbines for gas-fired power
plants, were down 19% in early trading Monday. Since the company’s
spinoff from GE last April, the share price had risen almost 200%
through last Friday, largely based on optimism about its
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/ge-vernova-natural-gas-ai" target="_self"><u>ability
to supply higher electricity demand</u></a>. Oklo, the advanced nuclear
company backed by OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman, is down 25%, after
rising almost 300% in the past year. Constellation Energy, the
independent power producer that’s
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/microsoft-three-mile-island-nuclear-constellation" target="_self"><u>re-powering
Three Mile Island</u></a> in partnership with Microsoft, saw its shares
fall almost 20% in early trading. It had risen almost 190% in the year
prior to Monday.
</p>
<p>
“DeepSeek’s power implications for AI training punctures some of the
capex euphoria which followed major commitments from Stargate and Meta
last week,” Jefferies infrastructure analyst Graham Hunt and his
colleagues wrote in a note to clients Monday. “With DeepSeek delivering
performance comparable to GPT-4 for a fraction of the computing power,
there are potential negative implications for the builders, as pressure
on AI players to justify ever increasing capex plans could ultimately
lead to a lower trajectory for data center revenue and profit growth.”
</p>
<p>
Investors fear that the proliferation of cheaper, more efficient models
may hurt the prospects of technology companies — and their suppliers —
that are spending tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars on
artificial intelligence investments.
</p>
<p>
Just last week, both Altman and Mark Zuckerberg, the founder and chief
executive of Meta, announced huge new investments in artificial
intelligence infrastructure.
</p>
<p>
Altman’s OpenAI is part of Stargate, the joint venture with Microsoft
and SoftBank that got a splashy White House-based announcement and
<a href="https://openai.com/index/announcing-the-stargate-project/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>promises
to invest $500 billion in artificial intelligence
infrastructure</u></a>. There was already some skepticism of these
numbers, with Altman-nemesis Elon Musk charging that certain members
would be

to fulfill their ends of the deal</u></a>, Microsoft Chief Executive
Satya Nadella
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/22/24349798/satya-nadella-on-elons-stargate-accusations-all-i-know-is-im-good-for-my-80-billion" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>told
CNBC from Davos</u></a>, “I’m good for my $80 billion.”
</p>
<p>
Zuckerberg, meanwhile,
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/pfbid034qCLXYjAC7vjhWHoin1iyzdx4GkUtH6xPkrkvLUmTreDAmspWsUbrmrGb17DfFyvl" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said
late last week</u></a> that his company was building a data center “so
large it would cover a significant part of Manhattan,” which would
require 2 gigawatts of electricity to power. (For scale, reactors 3 and
4 of the Vogtle nuclear plant in Georgia are a little over 1 gigawatt
each.) He also said that Meta had planned up to $65 billion of capital
expenditure this year.
</p>
<p>
These escalating announcements have been manna to investors in any
company that provides the building blocks for large artificial
intelligence systems — namely chips and energy, with companies like
Nvidia, the chip designer, and power companies and energy infrastructure
companies posting some of the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/ge-vernova-natural-gas-ai" target="_self"><u>best
stock market performances</u></a> last year.
</p>
<p>
But exactly how cheaper artificial intelligence plays out in terms of
real investment remains to be seen. Late Sunday night Redmond,
Washington-time, Nadella posted a
<a href="https://x.com/satyanadella/status/1883753899255046301" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>link
on X</u></a> to the Wikipedia page for Jevons Paradox. The idea
<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/12/20/the-efficiency-dilemma" target="_blank"><u>dates
from 19th century Britain</u></a>, and posits that increased efficiency
in using a resource (in Jevons’ case, coal) could actually accelerate
its depletion, as the resource becomes cheaper for the same economic
output, encouraging more use of it (in Jevons’ case, iron).
</p>
<p>
“Jevons paradox strikes again!,” Nadella wrote. “As AI gets more
efficient and accessible, we will see its use skyrocket, turning it into
a commodity we just can’t get enough of.”
</p>
<p>
Investors in chips and energy companies are hoping that’s the case; at
least so far, the market doesn’t appear to agree.

Startup Finds Critical Minerals in the Unlikeliest of Places</h2>

<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTk5OTI5Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3MTE5OTQyNn0.8idd3qGIhC8cZv0M2Cxb2yq9Qvd1LAGt-zXlqCT-WIw/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
A century ago, prospectors tromped through remote areas, hoping to spot
valuable, mineralized rocks simply poking out of the ground. Eventually,
after they found all of the obvious stuff, they progressed to doing
airborne geophysical surveys that used tools such as electromagnetic
sensing to identify minerals that were just below the surface or highly
concentrated. But there’s always been a lot more out there than we had
the mechanisms to find. So now, companies are training artificial
intelligence models on heaps of historical data to help locate untouched
reserves of minerals that are key to clean energy technologies such as
electric vehicle batteries and wind turbines.
</p>
<p>
One of the biggest players in this space is Earth AI, a Sydney-based
startup that today announced a $20 million Series B round, bringing the
company’s total investment to over $38 million since its founding in
2017. While the company had initially sought to raise $15 million in
this round, investor interest was so strong that it exceeded its target
by $5 million. Lead investors were Tamarack Global and Cantos Ventures.
</p>
<p>
Earth AI has a two-stage business model. First, it uses its proprietary
software to locate likely deposits and purchases the mineral rights to
the land. Then, it sends in its drilling rig and in-house team of
geologists to produce mineral samples. The team then shows these samples
to mining companies to prove that the area warrants further development
and — assuming the miners are interested — sells them the mineral
rights. “Because of the scarcity of this, because of the deficit of
where we are and where we’re going, these price tags are $500 million to
$2.5 billion,” Monte Hackett, Earth AI’s chief financial officer, told
me. Huge as that may sound, it’s much less than what a mining company
would typically spend doing traditional exploration themselves. This
latest funding will allow the startup to purchase additional drill rigs
and increase its project pipeline to over 50 sites.
</p>
<p>
“The problem is obvious,” Hackett told me. “We need
<a href="https://about.bnef.com/blog/transition-metals-become-10-trillion-opportunity-as-demand-rises-and-supply-continues-to-lag/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$10
trillion of critical metal production</u></a> by 2050. We’re producing
<a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-critical-minerals-outlook-2024/executive-summary#:~:text=Strong%20growth%20in%20demand%20produces,its%20own%20attains%20that%20scale." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$320
billion</u></a>, a $9.7 trillion shortfall.” To better locate the
trillions of dollars worth of minerals necessary for the energy
transition, the startup’s CEO, geoscientist Roman Teslyuk, digitized
decades of old Australian geophysical survey data, then overlaid that
with remote sensing data such as satellite imagery to train a model to
recognize the Earth systems and geological processes that created
minerals deposits millennia ago. “Another way I like to think about it
is that our algorithm looks for the geological shadow that is cast by a
dense mineral body,” Hackett explained in a follow-up email.
</p>
<p>
Hackett told me that Earth AI focuses specifically on “greenfield”
applications — that is, areas where no mining activity or substantial
minerals exploration has previously occurred. So far, the company’s
discoveries include a
<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/earth-ai-and-legacy-minerals-announce-first-ever-greenfield-palladium-discovery-using-artificial-intelligence-in-new-south-wales-302312289.html#:~:text=This%20significant%20discovery%20of%20palladium,to%20contain%20no%20magmatic%20nickel." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>significant
deposit of palladium</u></a>, which also contains platinum and nickel,
<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/earth-ai-discovers-new-gold-system-close-to-existing-molybdenum-project-at-willow-glen-302336813.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>as
well as a gold deposit</u></a> and a
<a href="https://www.mining.com/machine-learning-helps-earth-ai-find-high-grade-molybdenum-in-unexpected-place/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>molybdenum
deposit</u></a>. “We’re finding things that go against what has been the
common sense of the industry so far,” Hackett told me, referencing the
company’s palladium discovery. “There was geological consensus that
there was no platinum palladium on the East Coast of Australia, and our
algorithm learned what it looked like on the West Coast and then
identified it on the East Coast.”
</p>
<p>
While Hackett said Earth AI is open for business anywhere, right now all
of its projects are in Australia, where the company has “600 ’x’s on our
treasure map” — that is, likely areas for deposits, Hackett wrote in a
follow-up email. Outlining the advantages of doing business there, he
explained, “We don’t have to go somewhere where there’s unsavory working
conditions or there are issues where we have to put our principles into
balance. Here, everything is very regulated and above board.” Plus,
mining has long been an important component of the Australian economy.
“They’re incredibly efficient at doing this well. So the timeline for
development is the shortest compared to other places,” Hackett told me.
</p>
<p>
This tech could have important domestic implications too, though. As the
newly-inaugurated President Trump
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/declaring-a-national-energy-emergency/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>prioritizes
ramping up</u></a> U.S. production of critical minerals, Earth AI could
one day help locate deposits here, as well. And since Australia is a
close American ally, the nation could play a key role in helping wean
the U.S. off of Chinese imports, providing the U.S. with critical
minerals that it can’t now, or perhaps ever, produce in sufficient
quantities itself.

<p>LONDON/SINGAPORE — Investors hammered technology stocks on Monday,

possibly marking a turning point in the level of investment needed for
AI.  </p>
<p>Futures on the Nasdaq 100 slid almost 4%, suggesting the index could
see its biggest daily slide since September 2022 later on Monday, if
those losses are sustained. </p>
<p>Those on the S&amp;P 500 dropped 2%. Shares in AI chipmaker Nvidia
fell more than 11%, rival Oracle dropped 8.5% and AI data analytics
company Palantir lost 6.5% in pre-market trading.  </p>
<p>DeepSeek, which by Monday had overtaken U.S. rival ChatGPT in terms
of downloads on the Apple Store, offers the prospect of a viable,
cheaper AI alternative which has raised questions about the
sustainability of the level of spending and investment on AI by Western
companies, including Apple and Microsoft.  </p>
<p>From Tokyo to Amsterdam, shares in AI players tumbled. </p>
<p>“We still don’t know the details and nothing has been 100% confirmed
in regards to the claims, but if there truly has been a breakthrough in
the cost to train models from $100 million+ to this alleged $6 million
number this is actually very positive for productivity and AI end users
as cost is obviously much lower meaning lower cost of access,” Jon
Withaar, a senior portfolio manager at Pictet Asset Management,
said. </p>
<p>The hype around AI has powered a huge inflow of capital into the
equity markets in the last 18 months in particular, as investors have
bought into the technology, inflating company valuations and sending
stock markets to record highs. </p>
<p>Little is known about the small Hangzhou startup behind DeepSeek. Its
researchers wrote in a paper last month that the DeepSeek-V3 model,
launched on Jan. 10, used Nvidia’s H800 chips for training, spending
less than $6 million - the figure referenced by Pictet’s Withaar. </p>
<p>H800 chips are not top-of-the-line. Initially developed as a
reduced-capability product to get around restrictions on sales to China,
they were subsequently banned by U.S. sanctions. </p>
<p>‘Sputnik moment’  </p>
<p>Marc Andreessen, the Silicon Valley venture capitalist, said in a
post on X on Sunday that DeepSeek’s R1 model was AI’s “Sputnik moment,”
referencing the former Soviet Union’s launch of a satellite that marked
the start of the space race in the late 1950s. </p>
<p>“Deepseek R1 is one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs
I’ve ever seen — and as open source, a profound gift to the world,” he
said in a separate post.  </p>
<p>In Europe, ASML which counts Taiwan’s TSMC, Intel and Samsung as its
customers, dropped almost 7.5%, while Siemens Energy lost nearly 18%. In
Japan, startup investor SoftBank Group slid more than 8%. Last week it
announced a $19 billion commitment to fund Stargate, a data-center joint
venture with OpenAI. </p>
<p>Given the volatility, investors sought out safe-havens such as U.S.
Treasuries, which pushed 10-year yields down nearly 10 basis points to
4.52%, while low-yielding currencies like the Japanese yen and the Swiss
franc soared against the dollar.  </p>
<p>Big Tech has ramped up spending on developing AI capabilities and
optimism over the possible returns has driven stock valuations
sky-high. </p>
<p>Nvidia alone has risen by over 200% in about 18 months and trades at
56 times the value of its earnings, compared with a 53% rise in the
Nasdaq .IXIC, which trades at a multiple of 16 to the value of its
constituents’ earnings, according to LSEG data. </p>
<p>Nick Ferres, chief investment officer at Vantage Point Asset
Management in Singapore said the market was questioning the capex spend
of the major tech companies. </p>
<p>Masahiro Ichikawa, chief market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui DS
Asset Management said: “The idea that the most cutting-edge technologies
in America, like Nvidia and ChatGPT, are the most superior globally,
there’s concern that this perspective might start to change.”  </p>
<p>“I think it might be a bit premature,” Ichikawa said.</p>

an executive order establishing a review council to assess the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, and said the agency needs to be
“drastically” improved. The council will have no more than 20 members,
and will include department heads as well as people from outside the
government that are appointed by Trump himself. “These non-Federal
members shall have diverse perspectives and expertise in disaster relief
and assistance, emergency preparedness, natural disasters, Federal-State
relationships, and budget management,” the order states. This new
council will be tasked with scrutinizing the agency’s disaster relief
efforts and making recommendations for improvement. Trump has slammed
FEMA and the prior administration for their responses to recent natural
disasters, including Hurricane Helene and the wildfires in Los Angeles.

<p class="drop-caps">
Now that President Donald Trump has been officially inaugurated and
issued his barrage of executive orders
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/national-energy-emergency" target="_self"><u>celebrating
fossil fuels</u></a> and shelving climate technologies such as
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/wind-executive-order-trump" target="_self"><u>wind
energy</u></a> and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/trump-ev-executive-order" target="_self"><u>electric
vehicles</u></a>, climate tech startups are in a pickle. Federal funding
can play a critical role in helping companies scale up and build out
first-of-a-kind projects and facilities. So how to work with a
government hostile to one of these startups’ core value propositions:
aiding in the energy transition?
</p>
<p>
Talk of clean tech and electrification may be out of vogue, but its
utility is not. The potential of many of these companies goes beyond
mitigating climate change and into the realm of energy security and
resilience — something the Department of Defense is well aware of.
</p>
<p>
The White House’s
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/climate" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>climate
webpage has gone dark</u></a>; the Department of Defense’s
<a href="https://www.climate.mil/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>climate
resilience portal</u></a> lasted a little longer, but that’s now down,
too. Once upon a time, though, the site read, “The changing climate is
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-national-security" target="_self"><u>one
of many threat multipliers</u></a> to National Security, which adds
complexity to Department of Defense decisions.” That’s a major reason
why this agency can’t stop, won’t stop funding climate technologies.
Another reason is that many technologies that happen to be good for the
planet might also simply be the best tool for the job, meaning the DOD
need not utter the word “climate” at all when justifying its decision to
deploy new solutions.
</p>
<p>
“The Defense Department, so far in our experience, has framed things
largely in terms of alternative benefits that our technology can have,
such as fuel supply chain redundancy and reliability,” Ted McKlveen,
co-founder and CEO of the hydrogen storage company Verne, told me. Verne
received a $250,000 Small Business Innovation Research
<a href="https://www.verneh2.com/news-article/verne-receives-award-to-develop-cryo-compressed-hydrogen-solutions-for-the-u-s-army" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>grant
from the Army</u></a> last May to work on the development of hydrogen
vehicles.
</p>
<p>
Cindy Taff, CEO of the next-generation geothermal startup Sage
Geosystems, told me something similar. “What the military likes to talk
about is energy resilience,” she said, though she has heard the DOD tout
the climate benefits of her company’s tech, too. Sage currently has
multiple DOD engagements, including feasibility studies with both the
<a href="https://www.sagegeosystems.com/sage-geosystems-to-advance-energy-resilience-with-geothermal-energy-solutions-at-fort-bliss/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Army</u></a>
and

</p>
<p>
That’s not to say it’s clear what the Department of Defense’s funding
priorities under Trump will be. When I contacted the DOD in mid-December
to request an interview for this story, a spokesperson initially told me
they would help connect me to the right person. But as Trump’s
inauguration drew nearer, I got a message saying the agency would have
to hold off until it got more guidance, as “it remains to be seen in the
next few weeks what direction the new administration is
going.<em><em>”</em></em>
</p>
<p>
Regardless of how the priorities shake out, practically every
climate-focused company and venture capitalist I talk to emphasizes that
their companies will only succeed if they can make or invest in products
that can compete on economics and/or quality alone, sans government
support. That was true even before a second Trump turn in the White
House started to look like an inevitability, and this new administration
will at least partially reveal which companies can do that. But while
everybody <em><em>aims </em></em>to be independent of federal support,
they might not actually <em><em>need</em></em> to say goodbye to that
funding stream, so long as they can tout their economic and performance
benefits to the right customers.
</p>
<p>
Take Pyka, for example. When Michael Norcia co-founded the autonomous
electric aircraft company in 2017, the ultimate goal was to design a
passenger plane. “We want that to be our legacy, but we were also very,
very realistic about the challenges associated with actually doing
that,” he told me. So when the DOD took an interest in the company’s
commercial cargo planes and their potential ability to deliver supplies
in contested environments, the startup jumped at the opportunity,
delivering its first aircraft to AFWERX, the innovation arm of the
Department of the Air Force, early last year. Interest from such a
lucrative government customer helped the company to close its
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/23/pyka-fields-interest-from-defense-as-40m-round-goes-to-scaling-up-its-electric-autonomous-planes/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$40
million Series B</u></a> round in September.
</p>
<p>
Of course, the decarbonization benefits of electrifying military cargo
delivery would be huge. But unsurprisingly, Norcia told me that the DOD
primarily frames the opportunity in terms of the capabilities of
all-electric or hybrid-electric planes, which could take a variety of
fuels, operate quietly, and give off minimal heat, making them more
difficult to detect via thermal imaging. Plus, the more equipment is
electrified the better, “in terms of having them be able to operate in a
highly contested environment, where moving fuel around maybe is not
feasible,” Norcia explained. Not to mention the fact that if a manned
aircraft is shot down, people die, meaning that in a counterfactual
sense, Pyka’s tech is saving lives.
</p>
<p>
Verne’s North Star is also decarbonization. And given that the military
is the world’s largest oil consumer, McKlveen was excited to partner
with the Army to put its hydrogen storage tech to use in medium and
heavy-duty vehicles. The company stores hydrogen (ideally green
hydrogen, produced via renewables-powered electrolysis) at high density
as a cold, compressed gas, making it possible to build hydrogen vehicles
with greater range and lower cost than has traditionally been done.
Similar to Pyka, the Army is enthused that these vehicles would be
difficult for adversaries to detect, as they’re quiet and give off
little heat. Likewise, McKlveen told me that hydrogen power could
replace the Army’s notoriously noisy generators.
</p>
<p>
While Verne has also partnered with the
<a href="https://www.verneh2.com/news-article/verne-receives-award-through-doe-commercialization-support-program" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Department
of Energy</u></a> and its R&amp;D arm,
<a href="https://arpa-e.energy.gov/programs-and-initiatives/search-all-projects/decoupling-high-density-hydrogen-liquid-hydrogen-infrastructure-catalyst-filled-heat-exchangers-modular-cryo-compressors" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ARPA-E</u></a>,
McKlveen said that working with the DOD has been unique in a few ways.
“The key difference is the DOD is a customer and a grant provider. So
they can say both what their needs are as a potential customer and
represent a potential customer,” he explained. This, along with the
agency’s clear, phased approach that it puts companies through, helps
bring a level of transparency to the whole process, from pilot to
full-fledged military implementation, that McKlveen appreciates.
</p>
<p>
And lest we forget, “they also have a very large budget,” he told me.
For fiscal year 2025, the DOD has requested
<a href="https://www.armed-services.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/fy24_ndaa_conference_executive_summary1.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$849.8
billion</u></a>, while the DOE, by comparison, has requested a mere
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2024-03/doe-fy-2025-budget-in-brief-v2.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$51.4
billion</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
“I find military people to be get-it-done type of people,” Taff of Sage
Geosystems told me. “So I think that helps to create a sense of urgency
and also push things along a lot faster than you would see with maybe
other organizations.” Sage uses drilling technologies adopted from the
oil and gas industry to access heat for clean electricity production
across a wide variety of geographies. This is an especially attractive
option for the DOD as the majority of geothermal infrastructure is
underground, and thus well protected from attack. And unlike other
renewables, this tech can provide 24/7 energy no matter the weather
conditions. So it’s no surprise that the military is pouring money into
this sector, pursuing partnerships with other big names in the
geothermal space such as
<a href="https://www.diu.mil/latest/three-additional-next-generation-geothermal-technology-companies-advancing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Fervo
Energy</u></a> and
<a href="https://www.eavor.com/press-releases/u-s-defense-department-awards-eavor-contract-to-power-military-base-through-advanced-geothermal-system/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Eavor.</u></a>
</p>
<p>
Electric planes, hydrogen, and geothermal all felt intuitively
justifiable to me from a defense standpoint, but I was more surprised to
learn that the DOD has gotten into the alternative proteins, a.k.a.
“fake meat”, industry. Though meat substitutes won’t power tankers or
keep the lights on, the Defense Department’s
<a href="https://www.fooddive.com/news/better-meat-awarded-grant-department-of-defense/725392/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$1.4
million grant</u></a> to The Better Meat Co. is intended to strengthen
the American supply chain. China’s Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Affairs views
<a href="https://time.com/6143109/china-future-of-cultivated-meat/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>lab-grown
meat as critical</u></a> to its five-year agricultural plan. “So we
don’t want to have the United States be importing clean protein in the
way that we’re currently dependent on Asia for our semiconductors and
photovoltaics,” Paul Shapiro, the company’s CEO, told me.
</p>
<p>
The Better Meat Co. produces a protein called Rhiza that’s derived from
microscopic fungi, which it then sells as an ingredient to other
companies to make either 100% animal-free meat or a meat blend. “This
isn’t an alternative protein program. It’s a
<a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3878835/dod-releases-seven-awards-for-distributed-bioindustrial-manufacturing-program/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>domestic
biomanufacturing program</u></a>,” Shapiro told me when I asked if
military funding for meat substitutes could be
<a href="https://heatmap.news/lifestyle/lab-grown-meat-trump-rfk" target="_self"><u>at
risk under Trump</u></a>. Looking at some of the other companies that
got grants through the same program, he said, “it’s literally like bio
manufacturing things for military planes and jet lubricants and chemical
catalysts for bullets.” That is, probably not Republican targets for
defunding. “It’s clearly solely about wanting the U.S. to be a leader in
biomanufacturing for the products that the world is going to depend on
in the future.”
</p>
<p>
The DOD also sees promise in numerous other clean energy technologies,
including
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/nuclear-microreactors-radiant-westinghouse-bwx-technologies" target="_self"><u>nuclear
microreactors</u></a> for their portability and ability to provide
off-grid energy in remote locations and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/northvolt-lyten-zeta" target="_self"><u>alternate
battery chemistries</u></a> that could help the U.S. move away from a
dependence on Chinese-produced lithium-ion batteries.
</p>
<p>
But despite the deep well of funding and pragmatic approach to
deployment that the Department of Defense offers, agreeing to work with
the DOD isn’t always an obvious choice. Many fear their company’s tech
could be used in ways and in wars that they oppose. In 2018, for
example, thousands of Google employees
<a href="https://static01.nyt.com/files/2018/technology/googleletter.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>signed
a letter opposing the company’s participation in Project Maven</u></a>,
a partnership with the Pentagon that uses artificial intelligence to
improve the accuracy of drone strikes. Supporters of the project said it
would lead to fewer civilian deaths, while protestors argued that Google
“should not be in the business of war.” Google did not renew the
contract. More recently, employees at
<a href="http://www.notechforapartheid.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Microsoft,
Google, and Amazon</u></a> have signed petitions opposing their
company’s provision of cloud computing and AI services to the Israeli
government.
</p>
<p>
Norcia noted that most, but not all of his employees were neutral to
positive when it came to working with the Air Force, while “for a small
minority of the company, it unfortunately was not something that they
really wanted to devote their life to.” While he understands that
perspective, Norcia does believe that Pyka’s work with the DOD is a net
positive for the world. “If you assume wars are going to keep happening
— which, unfortunately, I think is the reality — I’d rather have it be
the case that they’re more of a robot war than a human war,” he told me.
And at the end of the day, passenger planes are still the goal.
</p>
<p>
As for his team at Verne, McKlveen told me everybody was on board. “The
Defense Department has led to some of the biggest innovations of the
last century, whether that’s the internet or GPS. And our team knows
that.” Plus, even if the DOD doesn’t talk much about the climate
benefits of sustainability-focused tech, that doesn’t negate them.
<a href="https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/files/cow/imce/papers/Pentagon%20Fuel%20Use%2C%20Climate%20Change%20and%20the%20Costs%20of%20War%20Revised%20November%202019%20Crawford.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>A
2019 study</u></a> revealed that the Pentagon purchases an average of
100 million barrels of oil per year, so from that perspective, “it’s
hard to find a bigger customer that we can address,” McKlveen told me.
</p>
<p>
Norcia agreed. “I think the gains of your impact get turned way up if
you’re doing work with the DOD,” he said, “as opposed to, you know,
building an app that makes something incrementally more efficient or
more addictive.”

id="percival-everetts-james-awarded-carnegie-medal-for-fiction">Percival
Everett’s ‘James’ awarded Carnegie Medal for fiction</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — For author Percival Everett, libraries have long been a
source of knowledge and discovery and pleasure, even of the forbidden
kind.</p>
<p>“I remember making friends at age 13 with the librarian at the
University of South Carolina, and she used to let me go through the
stacks when I wasn’t supposed to,” Everett, who spent part of his
childhood in Columbia, said during a telephone interview Sunday.</p>
<p>“One of the wonderful things about libraries is that when you’re
looking for one book, it’s surrounded by other books that may not be
connected to it. That’s what you get (online) with links, but (in
libraries) no one’s decided what the links are.”</p>
<p>Everett’s latest honor comes from the country’s public libraries. On
Sunday, the American Library Association announced that Everett’s
“James” was this year’s winner of the Carnegie Medal for Excellence in
Fiction, which includes a $5,000 cash award. Kevin Fedarko’s “A Walk in
the Park: The True Story of a Spectacular Misadventure in the Grand
Canyon” was chosen for nonfiction.</p>
<p>Everett’s acclaimed reworking of Mark Twain’s “The Adventures of
Huckleberry Finn” from the perspective of Jim, Huck Finn’s enslaved
companion, has already received the National Book Award and the Kirkus
Prize and is a finalist for a National Book Critics Circle award.
“James” has even topped The New York Times fiction hardcover list, a
rare feat in recent years for a literary work that wasn’t a major book
club pick or movie tie-in.</p>
<p>“Percival Everett has written a modern masterpiece, a beautiful and
important work that offers a fresh perspective from the eyes of a
classic character,” Allison Escoto, chair of the award’s selection
committee, said in a statement. “Kevin Fedarko’s unforgettable journey
through the otherworldly depths of the Grand Canyon shows us the
triumphs and pitfalls of exploration and illuminates the many vital
lessons we can all learn from our precious natural world.”</p>
<p>Fedarko is a former Time magazine correspondent whose work also has
appeared in The New York Times and Esquire. A Pittsburgh native
fascinated by distant places, Fedarko has a long history with libraries
— Carnegie libraries. He remembers visiting two while growing up,
notably one in the suburb of Oakmont near the hairdressing salon his
parents ran. He would read biographies of historical figures from George
Washington to Daniel Boone, and otherwise think of libraries as
“important threads running through his life,” windows to a “wider
world.”</p>
<p>Now a resident of Flagstaff, Arizona, Fedarko says that he relied in
part on the library at the nearby Northern Arizona University campus for
both “A Walk in the Park” and its predecessor, also about the Grand
Canyon, “The Emerald Mile.”</p>
<p>“The library has an important and unique collection about the Grand
Canyon, and it’s the backbone of the kind of history that helps form the
framework of both books,” he says. “Neither of them could have been done
without the library.”</p>
<p>Previous winners of the medals, established in 2012 with a grant from
the Carnegie Corporation of New York, includes Donna Tartt’s “The
Goldfinch,” Colson Whitehead’s “The Underground Railroad” and Doris
Kearns Goodwin’s “The Bully Pulpit.”</p>
<p>This year’s finalists besides “James” in the fiction category were
Jiaming Tang’s “Cinema Love” and Kavin Akbar’s “Martyr!”</p>
<p>Adam Higginbotham’s “Challenger: A True Story of Heroism and Disaster
on the Edge of Space” and Emily Nussbaum’s “Cue the Sun! The Invention
of Reality TV” were the nonfiction runners-up.</p>
<p>All three fiction nominees were published by Penguin Random House and
all three nonfiction finalists by Simon &amp; Schuster.</p>

id="mel-gibsons-flight-risk-is-no.-1-at-box-office-the-brutalist-expands">Mel
Gibson’s ‘Flight Risk’ is No. 1 at box office, ‘The Brutalist’
expands</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — Critics lambasted it and audiences didn’t grade it much
better. But despite the turbulence, Mel Gibson’s “Flight Risk” managed
to open No. 1 at the box office with a modest $12 million, according to
studio estimates Sunday. </p>
<p>On a quiet weekend, even for the typically frigid movie-going month
of January, the top spot went to the Lionsgate thriller starring Mark
Wahlberg as a pilot flying an Air Marshal (Michelle Dockery) and
fugitive (Topher Grace) across Alaska. But it wasn’t a particularly
triumphant result for Gibson’s directorial follow-up to 2016’s “Hacksaw
Ridge.” Reviews (21% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and audience scores (a
“C” CinemaScore) were terrible. </p>
<p>President Donald Trump recently named Gibson a “special ambassador”
to Hollywood, along with Jon Voight and Sylvester Stallone. </p>
<p>Going into the weekend, Hollywood’s attention was more focused on the
Sundance Film Festival and on Thursday’s Oscar nominations, which were
twice postponed by the wildfires in the Los Angeles region. </p>
<p>The weekend was also a small test as to whether the once more common
Oscar “bump” that can sometimes follow nominations still exists. Most
contenders have by now completed the bulk of their theatrical runs and
are more likely to see an uptick on VOD or streaming. </p>
<p>But the weekend’s most daring gambit was A24 pushing Brady Corbet’s
“The Brutalist” a three–and-a-half-hour epic nominated for 10 Academy
Awards, into wide release. Though some executives initially greeted “The
Brutalist,” which is running with an intermission, as
“un-distributable,” Corbet has said, A24 acquired the film out of the
Venice Film Festival and it’s managed solid business, collecting $6
million in limited release. </p>
<p>In wide release, it earned $2.9 million — a far from blockbuster sum
but the best weekend yet for “The Brutalist.” </p>
<p>The audience was downright miniscule for another best-picture
nominee: RaMell Ross’ “Nickel Boys.” Innovatively shot almost entirely
in first-person POV, the Amazon MGM Studios release gathered just
$340,171 in 540 locations after expanding by 300 theaters. </p>
<p>Coming off one of the lowest Martin Luther King Jr. weekends in
years, no new releases made a major impact. </p>
<p>Steven Soderbergh’s “Presence,” a well-reviewed horror film shot from
the perspective of a ghost inside a suburban home, debuted with $3.4
million in 1,750 locations. The film, released by Neon and acquired out
of last year’s Sundance, was made for just $2 million. </p>
<p>The top spots otherwise went to holdovers. The Walt Disney Co.’s
“Mufasa: The Lion King,” in its sixth weekend of release, scored $8.7
million to hold second place. After starting slowly, the Barry
Jenkins-directed film has amassed $626.7 million globally. </p>
<p>“One of Them Days,” the Keke Palmer and SZA-led comedy from Sony
Pictures, held well in its second weekend, dropping just 32% with $8
million in ticket sales. In recent years, few comedies have found
success on the big screen, but “One of Them Days” has proven an
exception. </p>
<p>Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian
theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released
Monday. </p>

id="us-colombia-reach-migrant-deportation-deal-after-tariff-threats">US,
Colombia reach migrant deportation deal after tariff threats</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The White House announced late Sunday the United States was backing
off a series of retaliatory measures levied against Colombia, saying the
two countries had reached an agreement on U.S. flights sending Colombian
migrants back home.</p>
<p>A White House statement said the two countries agreed Colombia would
accept its migrants without restriction, including having them sent back
on U.S. military aircraft.  </p>
<p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro had earlier rejected two U.S.
military planes and said he would only accept migrants when the U.S.
treated them with dignity, including using civilian planes for
deportations.</p>
<p>The White House also said it would hold new tariffs and sanctions
against Colombia “in reserve, and not signed, unless Colombia fails to
honor this agreement.”</p>
<p>State Department visa sanctions against several Colombian officials,
as well as enhanced customs inspections would remain in place until the
first planeload of Colombian migrants lands in Colombia, the White House
said.</p>
<p>Colombia’s Foreign Ministry said late Sunday it had overcome the
impasse with the United States, and that Foreign Minister Luis Gilberto
Murillo and Colombian Ambassador to the U.S. Dnaiel García-Peña were
traveling to Washington for high-level meetings to follow up on the
agreement.</p>
<p>Colombia said it would welcome its people home and would guarantee
them decent conditions as citizens with rights.</p>
<p>The statements reversed a fast-evolving series of escalatory
statements from the leaders of the two countries, which featured U.S.
President Donald Trump announcing an immediate 25% tariff on Colombian
goods, which would rise to 50% in a week, and the suspension of visa
processing at the U.S. Embassy in Bogota.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Petro announced a 25% tariff on U.S. goods in return, saying the
United States “will never rule us.”</p>
<p>“A migrant is not a criminal and must be treated with the dignity
that a human being deserves,” Petro said. “That is why I returned the
U.S. military planes that were carrying Colombian migrants. … In
civilian planes, without being treated like criminals, we will receive
our fellow citizens.”</p>
<p>Colombia is America’s third-largest trading partner in Latin
America.</p>
<p>The row came about after U.S. authorities began arresting hundreds of
undocumented migrants per day and sending them back to their home
countries, carrying out Trump’s 2024 campaign pledge to deport masses of
migrants who have illegally entered the United States.</p>
<p>“We’re going to enforce immigration laws,” Vice President JD Vance
told CBS News’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday.</p>
<p>More than 1,000 migrants were arrested with hundreds repatriated to
other countries, including Guatemala last week, during the first days of
the new Trump administration, according to figures compiled by the U.S.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency and the White House.  </p>
<p>Watch related report by Veronica Balderas Iglesias:</p>
<p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said it made 956
arrest nationwide Sunday.</p>
<p>It did not specify how many were part of an operation focused in the
Chicago area that was witnessed by several top Trump administration
officials, including “border czar” Tom Homan.</p>
<p>ICE said in a statement it worked with other federal agencies to
conduct “enhanced targeted operations today in Chicago to enforce U.S.
immigration law and preserve public safety and national security by
keeping potentially dangerous criminal aliens out of our
communities.”</p>
<p>Homan told ABC’s “This Week” show Sunday, “There will be more arrests
nationwide.” </p>
<p>Trump authorized sending 1,500 troops to the U.S.-Mexico border, and
Homan said, “You’ll see the numbers increase. They’re down there to
create a secure border.”</p>
<p>He said the U.S. is deporting “as many as we can” arrest, with the
focus first on those convicted of U.S. crimes and then moving on to
detain and deport those whose asylum requests have been rejected by U.S.
officials.</p>
<p>“We’re in the beginning stages,” Homan said.</p>
<p>About 11 million undocumented migrants are believed to be living in
the U.S., a staggering number that most officials believe will be
impossible to deport.</p>
<p>Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a staunch Trump ally, urged his
Republican colleagues in Congress to authorize more spending for the
deportation effort.</p>
<p>“We haven’t given the Trump team the resources,” Graham said on NBC’s
“Meet the Press” show. He said Homan “needs to substantially hire more
[immigration] agents. He needs to finish the [border] wall [with Mexico]
and technology. He needs to go from 41,000 detention beds to 150,000
detention beds to make this work.”</p>
<p>“So, to my Republican colleagues, particularly in the House [of
Representatives], as we fiddle, our immigration plans are hitting walls.
We’re not building walls, we’re hitting walls. We need to give Tom Homan
the money now to execute the plan that he’s come up with. And without
congressional funding this is going to hit a wall,” Graham declared.</p>
<p>The Trump administration has stopped taking appointments for migrants
waiting in Mexico to request asylum through a mobile app, but Trump’s
anti-immigration edicts are facing legal challenges. One judge has
already temporarily blocked Trump from declaring that he no longer
recognizes constitutionally guaranteed citizenship for children of
undocumented migrants born in the United States.</p>

id="as-hegseth-takes-charge-at-pentagon-here-are-what-changes-could-be-in-store">As
Hegseth takes charge at Pentagon, here are what changes could be in
store</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — When Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth starts his first
official day on Monday morning, he will face a daunting array of issues
to tackle — from global conflicts and border security to administrative
tasks. </p>
<p>At the top of his list is addressing President Donald Trump’s
priority to strengthen the U.S. military presence along the southern
border and reviewing whether active-duty forces should be used for law
enforcement — something done rarely. </p>
<p>Dozens of other issues will compete for his attention, including
developing the Pentagon’s massive budget, decisions about aid to
Ukraine, support for the ceasefire in Gaza, troop deployments in the
Middle East. Not to mention Trump directives to rid the federal
government of diversity programs and personnel as well as moves to cut
waste and remove any lingering Biden administration backers. </p>
<p>In a message to the force shortly after he was sworn in Saturday,
Hegseth cited the challenges he sees ahead. Some are ones his
predecessors also faced, such as reorienting the military from decades
of a Middle East focus and better deterring China. Continued conflict in
the region, including the October 2023 attack on Israel by Hamas, has
made that shift impossible to execute. </p>
<p>Hegseth also told service members about other priorities, including
strengthening the defense industrial base and getting the Pentagon to
pass an audit, while ensuring that the United States remains “the
strongest and most lethal force in the world.” </p>
<p>He made an unannounced stop to the Pentagon on Saturday after the
swearing-in ceremony at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. There
was no media coverage of his arrival. The Pentagon later released an
official photo saying Hegseth was “ready to get to work on behalf of
America’s warriors.” </p>
<p>Already, support staff have been meeting with military leaders,
including Gen. CQ Brown Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. But
Hegseth will get to experience what many describe as “drinking from a
firehose” as he works to quickly get up to speed on what his 2.1 million
service members and 780,000 civilians in the department are doing. Among
them are tens of thousands serving overseas, including in combat
zones. </p>
<p>Then there are the cultural issues that Hegseth railed on as a media
personality that did not make it into Hegseth’s message to the military.
Many expect they will surface in the coming days. </p>
<p>Here are some key issues that Hegseth, who was confirmed in a
tiebreaking vote Friday by Vice President JD Vance, will face right
away: </p>
<p>Border deployments </p>
<p>In trying to meet Trump’s demand of securing the border, Hegseth will
face a barrage of information about what troops are available, what
assistance the Border Patrol needs and where, as well as how to house,
feed and transport the troops and border personnel and how to ensure
none of this affects other national security requirements. </p>
<p>One of his first big decisions is whether he will recommend that
active-duty troops deployed to the border become involved in law
enforcement, a move that military leaders in recent years have pushed to
avoid. </p>
<p>Active-duty forces are prohibited from doing law enforcement duties
on U.S. soil under the Posse Comitatus Act. Trump has signed an
executive order directing that his defense and homeland security
secretaries report back within 90 days on whether they think he should
invoke the 1807 law called the Insurrection Act, which allows troops to
be used for civilian law enforcement on U.S. soil during
emergencies. </p>
<p>During previous deployments, troops have been used for
transportation, intelligence, logistics, wall-building and other support
tasks, freeing up the Border Patrol to interact with migrants and
conduct the law enforcement duties.</p>
<p>Transgender troops</p>
<p>In his first executive order, Trump again stripped protections for
transgender troops that Democratic President Joe Biden had restored
after Trump banned those members from serving during his first term in
office. </p>
<p>The ban previously faced legal challenges, and lawyers who
represented transgender forces last time are readying to take it up in
the courts again. While Trump has not announced a ban, his decision to
revoke protections is seen as a first step toward that. </p>
<p>It is unclear how many troops would be affected. The Defense
Department has no exact figure on the number of transgender troops
serving because not every transgender person is in the same state of
medical transition and not every transgender person identifies as such
in military paperwork. </p>
<p>The department has referred queries on how many transgender troops
there are to the services; the services have said they have no way to
track. </p>
<p>The budget and Ukraine </p>
<p>Hegseth will have to become familiar with the complicated
construction of the Pentagon budget, which right now is about $850
billion. Trump ran on a vow to make the U.S. military more lethal —
something Hegseth has echoed. But they also have spoken extensively
about cutting waste. </p>
<p>So Hegseth’s imprint on the budget will be studied to determine how
that’s being done. </p>
<p>Woven into those discussions will be security assistance to Ukraine.
The State Department has ordered a freeze on new funding for almost all
U.S. foreign aid, and there was no indication of a waiver for military
assistance for Ukraine like there was for Israel and Egypt. </p>
<p>The Biden administration provided Kyiv with more than $66 billion in
military aid and weapons during the war with Russia. It had left unspent
about $3.85 billion in congressionally authorized funding to send more
weapons to Ukraine from existing U.S. stockpiles — a sum that is not
affected by the foreign aid freeze. But it is now up to Hegseth and
Trump to decide whether or not to spend it, and Trump hasn’t said what
he will do on Ukraine aid.</p>
<p>Diversity, equity and inclusion rollbacks</p>
<p>Hegseth will take over the Pentagon’s push to implement Trump’s
executive order to get rid of DEI programs, coming as military officers
fret over whether they will be fired for being “woke,” as Hegseth has
pledged to do. </p>
<p>During his Senate hearing, Hegseth affirmed his commitment to focus
on lethality and to eliminate wokeness, arguing that DEI policies
“divide” troops and do not prioritize “meritocracy.” </p>
<p>Officials said the Defense Department doesn’t have any full-time
workers assigned to DEI so they don’t expect to have to fire people, as
other federal agencies have. </p>
<p>But senior leaders have been poring over their websites to delete
pages that mention diversity. Lacking clear guidance, staffers were
pulling websites down in often inconsistent ways. The Army, for example,
temporarily removed its sexual assault guidelines before they later came
back online. </p>
<p>Hegseth also has railed against women in combat in his books and on
podcasts and said standards were lowered for them, which is not true. He
has since toned down his criticism after substantial pushback from
lawmakers. </p>
<p>He most recently told senators that he’s not aware that Trump wants
to roll back the decision to allow women to serve in all combat jobs.
Instead, he has talked about doing a review of standards.</p>
<p>Reproductive care</p>
<p>After the Supreme Court in 2022 ended constitutional protections for
abortion that were set out in Roe v. Wade, then-Defense Secretary Lloyd
Austin came out with a policy that would allow service members to take
leave and be reimbursed for travel expenses to obtain reproductive care
— including abortions and in-vitro fertilization — if the military base
they were assigned to was in a state that had banned that care. </p>
<p>It’s not clear whether Hegseth will seek to further revise that
policy to remove the reimbursement provisions. It has been only scarcely
used, and the department does not break down what the travel was for due
to medical privacy laws.</p>

id="thousands-wait-to-return-to-northern-gaza-trump-urges-jordan-egypt-to-take-palestinians">Thousands
wait to return to northern Gaza, Trump urges Jordan, Egypt to take
Palestinians</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Cairo — Tens of thousands of Palestinians waited, blocked on the
road, to return to their homes in northern Gaza on Sunday, voicing
frustration after Israel accused Hamas of breaching a ceasefire
agreement and refused to open crossing points. </p>
<p>A day after a second exchange of Israeli hostages held in Gaza for
Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, the holdup underlined the risks
hanging over the truce between the militant group and Israel, longtime
adversaries in a series of Gaza wars. </p>
<p>In central areas of Gaza, columns of people were waiting along the
main roads leading north, some in vehicles and some on foot, witnesses
said. </p>
<p>“A sea of people is waiting for a signal to move back to Gaza City
and the north, people are fed up and they want to go home,” said Tamer
Al-Burai, a displaced person from Gaza City. “This is the deal that was
signed, isn’t it?” </p>
<p>“Many of those people have no idea whether their houses back home are
still standing. But they want to go regardless, they want to put up the
tents next to the rubble of their houses, they want to feel home,” he
told Reuters via a chat app. </p>
<p>On Sunday, witnesses said many people had slept overnight on the
Salahuddin Road, the main thoroughfare running north to south and on the
coastal road leading north, waiting to go past the Israeli military
positions in the Netzarim corridor running across the center of the Gaza
Strip. </p>
<p>Vehicles, trucks and rickshaws were overloaded with mattresses, food,
and with the tents that used to shelter them for over a year in the
central and southern areas of the enclave, and volunteers were
distributing water and food. </p>
<p>Under the agreement worked out with Egyptian and Qatari mediators and
backed by the United States, Israel was meant to allow Palestinians
displaced from the homes in the north to return to their homes. </p>
<p>But Israel said that Hamas’ failure to hand over a list detailing
which of the hostages scheduled for release is alive or to hand over
Arbel Yehud, an Israeli woman taken hostage during the Hamas attack on
Israel on October 7, 2023 meant it had violated the agreement. </p>
<p>As a result, checkpoints in the central Gaza Strip would not be
opened to allow crossings into the northern Gaza Strip, it said in a
statement. Hamas issued a statement accusing Israel of stalling and
holding it responsible for the delay. </p>
<p>‘Demolition site’ </p>
<p>On Saturday, U.S. President Donald Trump instructed the U.S. military
to release 2,000-pound bombs that his predecessor, Joe Biden, had
ordered to be withheld from delivery to Israel over concern about their
impact on the civilian population of Gaza. </p>
<p>He also called on Egypt and Jordan to take on more Palestinians from
Gaza either temporarily or permanently, saying “we should just clear out
the whole thing.” </p>
<p>“It’s literally a demolition site, almost everything is demolished
and people are dying there,” he told reporters after a call with
Jordan’s King Abdullah. </p>
<p>An official of Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that runs Gaza,
reacted with suspicion to the remarks, echoing longstanding Palestinian
fears about being driven permanently from their homes. </p>
<p>Palestinians “will not accept any offers or solutions, even if [such
offers] appear to have good intentions under the guise of
reconstruction, as announced in the proposals of U.S. President Trump,”
Basem Naim, a member of the Hamas political bureau, told Reuters. </p>
<p>Al-Awda Hospital officials said four people were wounded by Israeli
fire, from soldiers apparently trying to prevent people coming too
close. </p>
<p>The Israeli military issued warnings to Palestinians not to approach
its positions in Gaza and said soldiers had fired warning shots on
several occasions but said “as of now, we are unaware of any harm caused
to the suspects as a result of the shooting.”</p>

id="trump-discussing-tiktok-purchase-with-multiple-people-decision-in-30-days">Trump
discussing TikTok purchase with multiple people; decision in 30
days</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE — U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday
he was in talks with multiple people over buying TikTok and would likely
have a decision on the popular app’s future in the next 30 days.</p>
<p>“I have spoken to many people about TikTok and there is great
interest in TikTok,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One during a
flight to Florida.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, Reuters reported two people with knowledge of the
discussions said Trump’s administration is working on a plan to save
TikTok that involves tapping software company Oracle and a group of
outside investors to effectively take control of the app’s
operations.</p>
<p>Under the deal being negotiated by the White House, TikTok’s
China-based owner, ByteDance, would retain a stake in the company, but
data collection and software updates would be overseen by Oracle, which
already provides the foundation of TikTok’s Web infrastructure, one of
the sources told Reuters.</p>
<p>However, in his comments to reporters on the flight, Trump said he
had not spoken to Oracle’s Larry Ellison about buying the app.</p>
<p>Asked if he was putting together a deal with Oracle and other
investors to save TikTok, Trump said: “No, not with Oracle. Numerous
people are talking to me, very substantial people, about buying it and I
will make that decision probably over the next 30 days. Congress has
given 90 days. If we can save TikTok, I think it would be a good
thing.”</p>
<p>The sources did say the terms of any potential deal with Oracle were
fluid and likely to change. One source said the full scope of the
discussions was not yet set and could include the U.S. operations as
well as other regions.</p>
<p>National Public Radio on Saturday reported the deal talks for
TikTok’s global operations, citing two people with knowledge of the
negotiations. Oracle had no immediate comment.</p>
<p>The deal being negotiated anticipates participation from ByteDance’s
current U.S. investors, according to the sources. Jeff Yass’s
Susquehanna International Group, General Atlantic, Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts and Sequoia Capital are among ByteDance’s U.S. backers.</p>
<p>Representatives for TikTok, ByteDance investors General Atlantic,
KKR, Sequoia and Susquehanna could not immediately be reached for
comment.</p>
<p>Others vying to acquire TikTok, including the investor group led by
billionaire Frank McCourt and another involving Jimmy Donaldson, better
known as the YouTube star Mr. Beast, are not part of the Oracle
negotiation, one of the sources said.</p>
<p>Oracle responsible</p>
<p>Under the terms of the deal, Oracle would be responsible for
addressing national security issues. TikTok initially struck a deal with
Oracle in 2022 to store U.S. users’ information to alleviate
Washington’s worries about Chinese government interference.</p>
<p>TikTok’s management would remain in place, to operate the short video
app, according to one of the sources.</p>
<p>The app, which is used by 170 million Americans, was taken offline
temporarily for users shortly before a law that said it must be sold by
ByteDance on national security grounds, or be banned, took effect on
Jan. 19.</p>
<p>Trump, after taking office a day later, signed an executive order
seeking to delay by 75 days the enforcement of the law that was put in
place after U.S. officials warned that under ByteDance, there was a risk
of Americans’ data being misused.</p>
<p>Officials from Oracle and the White House held a meeting on Friday
about a potential deal, and another meeting has been scheduled for next
week, NPR reported.</p>
<p>Oracle was interested in a TikTok stake “in the tens of billions,”
but the rest of the deal is in flux, the NPR report cited the source as
saying.</p>
<p>Trump has said he “would like the United States to have a 50%
ownership position in a joint venture” in TikTok.</p>
<p>NPR cited another source as saying that appeasing Congress is seen as
a key hurdle by the White House.</p>
<p>Free speech advocates have opposed TikTok’s ban under a law passed by
the U.S. Congress and signed by former President Joe Biden.</p>
<p>The company has said U.S. officials have misstated its ties to China,
arguing its content recommendation engine and user data are stored in
the United States on cloud servers operated by Oracle while content
moderation decisions that affect American users are also made in the
U.S.</p>

id="rubio-threatens-bounties-on-taliban-leaders-over-detained-americans">Rubio
threatens bounties on Taliban leaders over detained Americans</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Saturday
threatened bounties on the heads of Afghanistan’s Taliban leaders,
sharply escalating the tone as he said more Americans may be detained in
the country than previously thought.</p>
<p>The threat comes days after the Afghan Taliban government and the
United States swapped prisoners in one of the final acts of former U.S.
President Joe Biden.</p>
<p>The new top U.S. diplomat issued the harsh warning via social media,
in a rhetorical style strikingly similar to his boss, President Donald
Trump.</p>
<p>“Just hearing the Taliban is holding more American hostages than has
been reported,” Rubio wrote on X.</p>
<p>“If this is true, we will have to immediately place a VERY BIG bounty
on their top leaders, maybe even bigger than the one we had on bin
Laden,” he said, referring to the al-Qaida leader killed by U.S. forces
in 2011.</p>
<p>Rubio did not describe who the other Americans may be, but there have
long been accounts of missing Americans whose cases were not formally
taken up by the U.S. government as wrongful detentions.</p>
<p>In the deal with the Biden administration, the Taliban freed the
best-known American detained in Afghanistan, Ryan Corbett, who had been
living with his family in the country and was seized in August 2022.</p>
<p>Also freed was William McKenty, an American about whom little
information has been released.</p>
<p>The United States in turn freed Khan Mohammed, who was serving a life
sentence in a California prison.</p>
<p>Mohammed was convicted of trafficking heroin and opium into the
United States and was accused of seeking rockets to kill U.S. troops in
Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The United States offered a bounty of $25 million for information
leading to the capture or killing of Osama bin Laden shortly after the
September 11, 2001, terror attacks, with Congress later authorizing the
secretary of state to offer up to $50 million.</p>
<p>No one is believed to have collected the bounty for bin Laden, who
was killed in a U.S. raid in Pakistan.</p>
<p>Harder line on Taliban?</p>
<p>Trump is known for brandishing threats in his speeches and on social
media. But he is also a critic of U.S. military interventions overseas
and in his second inaugural address Monday said he aspired to be a
“peacemaker.”</p>
<p>In his first term, the Trump administration broke a then-taboo and
negotiated directly with the Taliban – with Trump even proposing a
summit with the then-insurgents at the Camp David presidential retreat –
as he brokered a deal to pull U.S. troops and end America’s longest
war.</p>
<p>Biden carried out the agreement, with the Western-backed government
swiftly collapsing and the Taliban retaking power in August 2021 just
after U.S. troops left.</p>
<p>The scenes of chaos in Kabul brought strong criticism of Biden,
especially when 13 American troops and scores of Afghans died in a
suicide bombing at the city’s airport.</p>
<p>The Biden administration had low-level contacts with Taliban
government representatives but made little headway.</p>
<p>Some members of Trump’s Republican Party criticized even the limited
U.S. engagements with the Taliban government and especially the
humanitarian assistance authorized by the Biden administration, which
insisted the money was for urgent needs in the impoverished country and
never routed through the Taliban.</p>
<p>Rubio on Friday froze nearly all U.S. aid around the world.</p>
<p>No country has officially recognized the Taliban government, which
has imposed severe restrictions on women and girls under its
ultra-conservative interpretation of Islam.</p>
<p>The International Criminal Court’s chief prosecutor on Thursday said
he was seeking arrest warrants for senior Taliban leaders over the
persecution of women.</p>

id="rain-in-southern-california-creates-mudflows-but-helps-firefighters">Rain
in southern California creates mudflows but helps firefighters</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — More rain fell Monday on parts of southern California
after causing mudflows over the weekend, helping firefighters but
boosting the risk of toxic ash runoff in areas scorched by Los
Angeles-area wildfires.</p>
<p>Flood watches were in effect for burn areas from recent fires that
broke out around the Pacific Palisades neighborhood in Los Angeles,
Altadena and Castaic Lake, said Joe Sirard, a meteorologist for the
National Weather Service in Oxnard.</p>
<p>“All these fresh burns are very susceptible to rapid runoff,” Sirard
said, warning of even small amounts of rain in a few minutes’ time.
“What that means is we have a fairly high danger of mud and debris flows
once we get above those thresholds.”</p>
<p>Los Angeles International Airport reported a little under 2.5
centimeters of rain in a 24-hour period ending at 3 a.m. Monday, the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported. Surrounding
areas reported lesser amounts.</p>
<p>School was closed Monday for the four Malibu schools in the Santa
Monica-Malibu Unified School District “due to dangerous road conditions
and challenges with access to our schools,” school officials posted
online.</p>
<p>A portion of the Pacific Coast Highway in Los Angeles County was
closed as of Sunday afternoon due to mudflows in Topanga Canyon, the
California Department of Transportation said. Heavy snow fell in the
mountains in San Bernardino and Riverside counties.</p>
<p>One benefit that could come from the rain: It may help firefighters
who are reining in multiple wildfires after weeks of windy and dry
weather.</p>
<p>Los Angeles County crews spent much of last week removing vegetation,
shoring up slopes and reinforcing roads in devastated areas of the
Palisades and Eaton fires, which reduced entire neighborhoods to rubble
and ash after breaking out during powerful winds on Jan. 7.</p>
<p>The Palisades Fire, the largest of the blazes that destroyed
thousands of homes and killed at least 11 people, reached 90%
containment Sunday. The Eaton Fire, which broke out near Altadena and
has killed at least 16 people, was 98% contained.</p>
<p>The Hughes Fire, which ignited last week north of Los Angeles and
caused evacuation orders or warnings for more than 50,000 people, was
95% contained as of Sunday evening.</p>
<p>In San Diego County, firefighters made progress to contain the
smaller Border 2 Fire as it burned through a remote area of the Otay
Mountain Wilderness near the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>
<p>Most of the region was forecast to get about an inch of precipitation
over several days, but the weather service warned of a risk of localized
cloudbursts causing mud and debris to flow down hills.</p>
<p>“So the problem would be if one of those showers happens to park
itself over a burn area,” weather service meteorologist Carol Smith said
on social media. “That could be enough to create debris flows.”</p>
<p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass issued an executive order last week to
expedite cleanup efforts and mitigate the environmental impacts of
fire-related pollutants. LA County supervisors also approved an
emergency motion to install flood-control infrastructure and expedite
and remove sediment in fire-impacted areas.</p>
<p>Fire crews filled sandbags for communities, while county workers
installed barriers and cleared drainage pipes and basins.</p>
<p>Officials cautioned that ash in recent burn zones was a toxic mix of
incinerated cars, electronics, batteries, building materials, paints,
furniture and other household items. It contains pesticides, asbestos,
plastics and lead. Residents were urged to wear protective gear while
cleaning up.</p>
<p>Concerns about post-fire debris flows have been especially high since
2018, when the town of Montecito, up the coast from Los Angeles, was
ravaged by mudslides after a downpour hit mountain slopes burned bare by
a huge blaze. Hundreds of homes were damaged and 23 people died.</p>
<p>The rain snapped a near-record streak of dry weather for southern
California. Most of southern California is currently in “extreme
drought” or “severe drought,” according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.</p>

id="cia-covid-likely-originated-in-a-lab-but-agency-has-low-confidence-in-report">CIA:
COVID likely originated in a lab, but agency has ‘low confidence’ in
report</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The CIA now believes the virus responsible for the
COVID-19 pandemic most likely originated from a laboratory, according to
an assessment released Saturday that points the finger at China even
while acknowledging that the spy agency has “low confidence” in its own
conclusion.</p>
<p>The finding is not the result of any new intelligence, and the report
was completed at the behest of the Biden administration and former CIA
Director William Burns. It was declassified and released Saturday on the
orders of President Donald Trump’s pick to lead the agency, John
Ratcliffe, who was sworn in Thursday as director.</p>
<p>The nuanced finding suggests the agency believes the totality of
evidence makes a lab origin more likely than a natural origin. But the
agency’s assessment assigns a low degree of confidence to this
conclusion, suggesting the evidence is deficient, inconclusive or
contradictory.</p>
<p>Earlier reports on the origins of COVID-19 have split over whether
the coronavirus emerged from a Chinese lab, potentially by mistake, or
whether it arose naturally. The new assessment is not likely to settle
the debate. In fact, intelligence officials say it may never be
resolved, due to a lack of cooperation from Chinese authorities.</p>
<p>The CIA “continues to assess that both research-related and natural
origin scenarios of the COVID-19 pandemic remain plausible,” the agency
wrote in a statement about its new assessment.</p>
<p>Instead of new evidence, the conclusion was based on fresh analyses
of intelligence about the spread of the virus, its scientific properties
and the work and conditions of China’s virology labs.</p>
<p>Lawmakers have pressured America’s spy agencies for more information
about the origins of the virus, which led to lockdowns, economic
upheaval and millions of deaths. It’s a question with significant
domestic and geopolitical implications as the world continues to grapple
with the pandemic’s legacy.</p>
<p>Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, chairman of the Senate
Intelligence Committee, said Saturday he was “pleased the CIA concluded
in the final days of the Biden administration that the lab-leak theory
is the most plausible explanation,” and he commended Ratcliffe for
declassifying the assessment.</p>
<p>“Now, the most important thing is to make China pay for unleashing a
plague on the world,” Cotton said in a statement.</p>
<p>China’s embassy in Washington did not immediately return messages
seeking comment. Chinese authorities have in the past dismissed
speculation about COVID’s origins as unhelpful and motivated by
politics.</p>
<p>While the origin of the virus remains unknown, scientists think the
most likely hypothesis is that it circulated in bats, like many
coronaviruses, before infecting another species, probably racoon dogs,
civet cats or bamboo rats. In turn, the infection spread to humans
handling or butchering those animals at a market in Wuhan, where the
first human cases appeared in late November 2019.</p>
<p>Some official investigations, however, have raised the question of
whether the virus escaped from a lab in Wuhan. Two years ago, a report
by the Energy Department concluded a lab leak was the most likely
origin, though that report also expressed low confidence in the
finding.</p>
<p>The same year then-FBI Director Christopher Wray said his agency
believed the virus “most likely” spread after escaping from a lab.</p>
<p>Ratcliffe, who served as director of national intelligence during
Trump’s first term, has said he favors the lab leak scenario, too.</p>
<p>“The lab leak is the only theory supported by science, intelligence,
and common sense,” Ratcliffe said in 2023.</p>
<p>The CIA said it will continue to evaluate any new information that
could change its assessment.</p>

leader: Trump administration’s deportation plans will be
‘catastrophic’</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ROME — The president of Haiti’s transitional presidential council
said the Trump administration’s decisions to freeze aid programs, deport
migrants and block refugees will be “catastrophic” for Haiti.</p>
<p>Leslie Voltaire made the comment in an interview with The Associated
Press in Rome on Saturday following a meeting with Pope Francis at the
Vatican. He visited the pope to ask for help for Haiti.</p>
<p>“I’m knocking on the doors of people who love Haiti. The pope loves
Haiti, and he is eager to help,” Haiti’s interim president said.</p>
<p>The pontiff and Voltaire discussed the dire situation in Haiti where
gangs have killed civilians and operate across the Caribbean nation with
impunity. Half of Haiti’s 11.4 million people are already hungry,
according to Voltaire, and losing humanitarian assistance will make the
situation dramatically worse.</p>
<p>“Trump said that Haiti is a ‘shithole,’ so I don’t think he will care
about Haiti,” Voltaire said, noting that thousands of people are already
being repatriated from the Dominican Republic every week and gangs are
terrorizing the populace. With the new U.S. policies, “the situation
will be catastrophic.”</p>
<p>During his first administration, President Donald Trump used blunt
language to question why the U.S. would accept immigrants from Haiti and
other countries in Africa. At the time, the White House did not deny his
remark but issued a statement saying Trump supports immigration policies
that welcome “those who can contribute to our society.”</p>
<p>Voltaire said there are roughly 1.5 million Haitians in the United
States and roughly 150,000 who were accepted under a program called the
“Temporary Protection System.”</p>
<p>“Trump says that he will expel all of them,” Voltaire said, adding
that Haiti, which is already struggling with hunger and internally
displaced people, cannot handle the influx.</p>
<p>In a report released this month, the U.N. migration agency said
internal displacement within Haiti has tripled over the last year and
now surpasses 1 million people. The situation has been largely caused by
gang violence in the Caribbean country. The new figure provided by the
International Organization for Migration represents a record for
Haiti.</p>
<p>IOM said that “relentless gang violence” in Haitian capital of
Port-au-Prince has fueled a near-doubling of displacement in the city
and a collapse of health care and other services and worsening food
insecurity. About 200,000 people have been forcibly returned to Haiti
over the last year mostly from the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>Voltaire and his transitional government have been tasked with
leading the country to general elections, an elusive goal but he is
convinced they can make it happen by next November despite powerful
gangs that rule 85% of the capital and are gaining ground in surrounding
areas.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Voltaire is positive that — if Haiti’s multinational
police force is boosted with several thousand additional officers — they
can go ahead with elections this year.</p>
<p>Kenya is leading the multinational police force with a total
deployment of more than 600, below the 1,000 officers the country’s
president pledged. An additional 150 Guatemalans and an advance team of
eight Salvadorean troops have also arrived, but the force remains far
below its anticipated strength of 2,500 officers. Voltaire said Benin
has pledged an additional 2,000 soldiers.</p>
<p>“We have to do a referendum on a new constitution and also the
election at the end of November. I say that we can do the elections
because we have like eight departments, like 80% of the country. We can
do the election.”</p>
<p>The power of gangs in Haiti has grown since the 2021 assassination of
President Jovenel Moïse. Some gangs have even indicated they want to be
part of the political process. Voltaire excluded that possibility, “I
don’t think they should be around the table.”</p>
<p>More than 5,600 people were reported killed across Haiti last year,
according to the United Nations. The number of killings increased by
more than 20% compared with all of 2023, according to the U.N. Human
Rights Office.</p>
