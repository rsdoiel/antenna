id="deepseek-vs.-chatgpt-fuels-debate-over-ai-building-blocks">DeepSeek
vs. ChatGPT fuels debate over AI building blocks</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — When Chinese startup DeepSeek released its AI
model this month, it was hailed as a breakthrough, a sign that China’s
artificial intelligence companies could compete with their Silicon
Valley counterparts using fewer resources.</p>
<p>The narrative was clear: DeepSeek had done more with less, finding
clever workarounds to U.S. chip restrictions. However, that storyline
has begun to shift.</p>
<p>OpenAI, the U.S.-based company behind ChatGPT, now claims DeepSeek
may have improperly used its proprietary data to train its model,
raising questions about whether DeepSeek’s success was truly an
engineering marvel.</p>
<p>In statements to several media outlets this week, OpenAI said it is
reviewing indications that DeepSeek may have trained its AI by mimicking
responses from OpenAI’s models.</p>
<p>The process, known as distillation, is common among AI developers but
is prohibited by OpenAI’s terms of service, which forbid using its model
outputs to train competing systems.</p>
<p>Some U.S. officials appear to support OpenAI’s concerns. At his
confirmation hearing this week, Commerce secretary nominee Howard
Lutnick accused DeepSeek of misusing U.S. technology to create a “dirt
cheap” AI model.</p>
<p>“They stole things. They broke in. They’ve taken our IP,” Lutnick
said of China.</p>
<p>David Sacks, the White House czar for AI and cryptocurrency, was more
measured, saying only that it is “possible” that DeepSeek had stolen
U.S. intellectual property.</p>
<p>In an interview with the cable news network Fox News, Sacks added
that there is “substantial evidence” that DeepSeek “distilled the
knowledge out of OpenAI’s models,” adding that stronger efforts are
needed to curb the rise of “copycat” AI systems.</p>
<p>At the center of the dispute is a key question about AI’s future: how
much control should companies have over their own AI models, when those
programs were themselves built using data taken from others?</p>
<p>AI data fight</p>
<p>The question is especially relevant for OpenAI, which faces its own
legal challenges. The company has been sued by several media companies
and authors who accuse it of illegally using copyrighted material to
train its AI models.</p>
<p>Justin Hughes, a Loyola Law School professor specializing in
intellectual property, AI, and data rights, said OpenAI’s accusations
against DeepSeek are “deeply ironic,” given the company’s own legal
troubles.</p>
<p>“OpenAI has had no problem taking everyone else’s content and
claiming it’s ‘fair,’” Hughes told VOA in an email.</p>
<p>“If the reports are accurate that OpenAI violated other platforms’
terms of service to get the training data it has wanted, that would just
add an extra layer of irony – dare we say hypocrisy – to OpenAI
complaining about DeepSeek.”</p>
<p>DeepSeek has not responded to OpenAI’s accusations. In a technical
paper released with its new chatbot, DeepSeek acknowledged that some of
its models were trained alongside other open-source models – such as
Qwen, developed by China’s Alibaba, and Llama, released by Meta –
according to Johnny Zou, a Hong Kong-based AI investment specialist.</p>
<p>However, OpenAI appears to be alleging that DeepSeek improperly used
its closed-source models – which cannot be freely accessed or used to
train other AI systems.</p>
<p>“It’s quite a serious statement,” said Zou, who noted that OpenAI has
not yet presented evidence of wrongdoing by DeepSeek.</p>
<p>Proving improper distillation may be difficult without disclosing
details on how its own models were trained, Zou added.</p>
<p>Even if OpenAI presents concrete proof, its legal options may be
limited. Although Zou noted that the company could pursue a case against
DeepSeek for violating its terms of service, not all experts believe
such a claim would hold up in court.</p>
<p>“Even assuming DeepSeek trained on OpenAI’s data, I don’t think
OpenAI has much of a case,” said Mark Lemley, a professor at Stanford
Law School who specializes in intellectual property and technology.</p>
<p>Even though AI models often have restrictive terms of service, “no
model creator has actually tried to enforce these terms with monetary
penalties or injunctive relief,” Lemley wrote in a recent paper with
co-author Peter Henderson.</p>
<p>The paper argues that these restrictions may be unenforceable, since
the materials they aim to protect are “largely not copyrightable.”</p>
<p>“There are compelling reasons for many of these provisions to be
unenforceable: they chill good faith research, constrain competition,
and create quasi-copyright ownership where none should exist,” the paper
noted.</p>
<p>OpenAI’s main legal argument would likely be breach of contract, said
Hughes. Even if that were the case, though, he added, “good luck
enforcing that against a Chinese company without meaningful assets in
the United States.”</p>
<p>Possible options</p>
<p>The financial stakes are adding urgency to the debate. U.S. tech
stocks dipped Monday after following news of DeepSeek’s advances, though
they later regained some ground.</p>
<p>Commerce nominee Lutnick suggested that further government action,
including tariffs, could be used to deter China from copying advanced AI
models.</p>
<p>But speaking the same day, U.S. President Donald Trump appeared to
take a different view, surprising some industry insiders with an
optimistic take on DeepSeek’s breakthrough.</p>
<p>The Chinese company’s low-cost model, Trump said, was “very much a
positive development” for AI, because “instead of spending billions and
billions, you’ll spend less, and you’ll come up with hopefully the same
solution.”</p>
<p>If DeepSeek has succeeded in building a relatively cheap and
competitive AI model, that may be bad for those with investment – or
stock options – in current generative AI companies, Hughes said.</p>
<p>“But it might be good for the rest of us,” he added, noting that
until recently it appeared that only the existing tech giants “had the
resources to play in the generative AI sandbox.”</p>
<p>“If DeepSeek disproved that, we should hope that what can be done by
a team of engineers in China can be done by a similarly resourced team
of engineers in Detroit or Denver or Boston,” he said.</p>

support for denuclearization talks with Russia, China raises hopes</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>white house — Arms control advocates are hoping U.S. President Donald
Trump’s fresh words of support for denuclearization will lead to talks
with Russia and China on arms reduction.</p>
<p>U.S. negotiations with the Russians and Chinese on denuclearization
and eventual agreements are “very possible,” according to Trump, who
addressed the World Economic Forum a week ago in Davos, Switzerland.</p>
<p>“Tremendous amounts of money are being spent on nuclear [weapons],
and the destructive capability is something that we don’t even want to
talk about because you don’t want to hear,” he said. “It’s too
depressing.”</p>
<p>Trump noted that in his first term, he discussed the topic with
Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>“We were talking about denuclearization of our two countries, and
China would have come along,” according to Trump. “President Putin
really liked the idea of cutting back on nuclear [armaments], and I
think the rest of the world — we would have gotten them to follow.”</p>
<p>Just months before leaving office, former U.S. President Joe Biden
met with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the APEC summit in Peru where
both agreed that decisions regarding the use of nuclear weapons should
remain under human control. That consensus was seen as a positive step
after the Chinese, four months previously, suspended nuclear arms
control talks with Washington to protest American arms sales to
Taiwan.</p>
<p>The horror of nuclear attacks first became evident to many in the
world through magazines in the West, which printed photographs of the
radiation-burned survivors of the U.S. atomic attack on two Japanese
cities in 1945 to end World War II. In subsequent years during the Cold
War, U.S. government films captured the destructive force of test
detonations in the Nevada desert, eventually prompting public
demonstrations to “ban the bomb” and diplomacy to reduce or eliminate
all nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>A major breakthrough occurred in 1987 with the Intermediate-Range
Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) between the United States and the Soviet
Union. It entered into full force the following year. By 1991, nearly
2,700 missiles had been dismantled. That was the first time the two
nuclear superpowers achieved a reduction of such weapons rather than
just limiting their growth.</p>
<p>Over the years, the Americans and the Russians lost their monopoly on
nuclear weapons. Nine countries presently have nuclear arsenals,
although Israel has never acknowledged possession of such weaponry.</p>
<p>The United States and Russia each have more than 5,000 nuclear
warheads — 90% of the world’s total. The combined global force of all
countries’ nuclear weapons could destroy the world many times over,
according to arms control advocates.</p>
<p>The current New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), signed in
2010 by U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian President Dmitry
Medvedev, set limits on the number of deployed strategic nuclear
warheads and delivery systems, while including on-site inspection and
exchanges of data for verification.</p>
<p>The treaty expires in early February 2026, which adds urgency to
Trump’s call for talks with Russia and China, according to Xiaodon
Liang, senior analyst for nuclear weapons policy and disarmament at the
Arms Control Association.</p>
<p>“And because of that, this issue has to be at the top of the agenda,
and having a signal that the president is concerned about this issue and
thinking about it is very positive,” Liang told VOA.</p>
<p>Since a formal, comprehensive agreement could take years to negotiate
— possibly spanning beyond the four years of the second Trump presidency
— Liang suggests the U.S. president consider an “executive agreement”
with Putin, an informal consensus or a series of unilateral steps to
continue adhering to the numbers in New START for an indefinite
period.</p>
<p>“That would be a stabilizing factor in this important bilateral
relationship,” Liang added.</p>
<p>There are analysts who advocate a more aggressive tactic.</p>
<p>Trump should consider ordering a resumption of nuclear testing to
demonstrate to America’s adversaries that the U.S. arsenal of weapons of
mass destruction remains viable and as an act of resolve, writes Robert
Peters, a research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative
think tank seen as having a dominant influence on Trump administration
policies.</p>
<p>Peters also suggests that Trump might want to withdraw from the 1963
Test Ban Treaty made with Moscow and “conduct an above-ground test
either at the Nevada National Security Site or in the Pacific Ocean over
open water, where nuclear fallout can be minimized” to stave escalatory
moves by an adversary to the United States.</p>
<p>The Heritage Foundation did not respond to multiple requests from VOA
to interview Peters.</p>
<p>Moscow is not known to have conducted any sort of test causing a
nuclear chain reaction, known as criticality, since 1990. Two years
later, the United States announced it would no longer test nuclear
weapons, although subcritical simulations continue. The other nuclear
nations have followed suit except North Korea, which last triggered a
nuclear test explosion in 2017.</p>
<p>The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists on Tuesday moved up the hands
of its “Doomsday Clock” by one second to 89 seconds to midnight, meant
to signify the peril from weapons of mass destruction and other
existential threats.</p>
<p>“We set the clock closer to midnight because we do not see positive
progress on the global challenges we face, including nuclear risk,
climate change, biological threats and advances in disruptive
technology,” said Daniel Holz, a physics professor at the University of
Chicago, just after the hands of this year’s clock were unveiled at the
U.S. Institute of Peace.</p>
<p>While the Doomsday Clock is merely symbolic, Liang at the Arms
Control Association sees it as an annual important ritual highlighting
the risks to Americans and everyone else posed by the world’s nuclear
arsenals.</p>
<p>“It is a good tool for bringing this to more people’s attention, and
you can’t blame Americans for having so many other issues on their
plate. And having this [clock] as a reminder, I think, is an effective
communications tool,” Liang said.</p>
<p>At the Doomsday Clock ceremony, VOA asked former Colombian President
and Nobel laureate Juan Manuel Santos what he viewed as the biggest
hurdle to Trump, Putin and Xi making progress on denuclearization.</p>
<p>“The biggest challenge, in my view, is for them to understand that
they should sit down and talk about how the three of them can take
decisions to save their own countries and the whole world,” he said.</p>
<p>Liang compared the situation to U.S. President John F. Kennedy’s call
to Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis,
which led Washington and Moscow to pull back from the brink of nuclear
war.</p>
<p>That resolution turned the hands of the Doomsday Clock the following
year back to 12 minutes to midnight in recognition of the Americans,
Soviets and British banning nuclear testing in the atmosphere, in space
and under water.</p>
<p>It has been several years since the United States engaged in any
denuclearization negotiations. Those working-level talks in 2019 in
Sweden between the first Trump administration and North Korean officials
did not yield any agreement, with Pyongyang’s chief negotiator, Kim
Myong Gil, telling reporters that the Americans had raised expectations
with promises of flexibility but would not “give up their old viewpoint
and attitude.”</p>
<p>The State Department spokesperson at the time, Morgan Ortagus, said
in a statement the two countries could not be expected to “overcome a
legacy of 70 years of war and hostility on the Korean Peninsula in the
course of a single Saturday,” but such weighty issues “require a strong
commitment by both countries. The United States has that
commitment.”</p>

id="spain-well-short-of-nato-defense-target-as-trump-demands-huge-additional-spending">Spain
well short of NATO defense target, as Trump demands huge additional
spending</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>As U.S. President Donald Trump demands a large increase in defense
spending by NATO allies, the spotlight has fallen on Spain, which spends
the least on defense of all member states relative to the size of its
economy.</p>
<p>Spain is the eurozone’s fourth-biggest economy. The country spent an
estimated $21.3 billion on defense last year, equating to 1.28% of its
gross domestic product (GDP), putting it at the bottom of the league
among the 32-nation Atlantic alliance.</p>
<p>That’s despite a pledge made by all NATO members in 2014 to spend at
least 2% of GDP on defense, according to the bloc.</p>
<p>NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte visited Madrid and Lisbon earlier
this week and warned all members of the need to boost spending beyond
existing targets.</p>
<p>“The goal of 2%, now set a decade ago, will not be enough to meet the
challenges of tomorrow. The threat from Russia may seem distant, but let
me assure you, it is not,” Rutte said at a press conference in Lisbon on
Jan. 27.</p>
<p>“NATO is strong today. To keep NATO strong we must, however, continue
to adapt. And to guarantee our security in the future, we also need to
ramp up our efforts now. It also means we need to spend more in our
defense,” he said.</p>
<p>Only 23 of the 32 NATO member states were expected to meet the 2%
target by 2024, according to the alliance.</p>
<p>Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has rejected criticism that his
government has been too slow to boost defense spending.</p>
<p>In a statement, the prime minister’s office said Monday that Spain
was a “serious, responsible and committed ally of NATO,” noting that the
government had increased defense spending by 70% in the last decade.</p>
<p>“Spain’s commitment to reach 2% of defense spending by 2029 is firm,”
the statement said.</p>
<p>Spanish troops are also helping to train Ukrainian forces as Kyiv
battles Russia’s invasion.</p>
<p>Trump criticism</p>
<p>That’s unlikely to be enough to satisfy NATO’s biggest spender, the
United States, which spent 3.38% of its GDP on defense in 2024.</p>
<p>Earlier in January, Trump described Spain’s contribution to NATO as
“very low” and has demanded a much higher spending target from European
allies.</p>
<p>“I’m also going to ask all NATO nations to increase defense spending
to 5% of GDP, which is what it should have been years ago,” Trump told
delegates by video link at the World Economic Forum in Davos on
Jan. 23.</p>
<p>Trump has long complained that European allies are taking advantage
of the United States, insisting that they should share the burden of
defense spending.</p>
<p>However, the 5% target is unrealistic for Spain, according to analyst
Pere Ortega of the Delas Center for Peace Studies in Madrid.</p>
<p>“Reaching 5% is impossible. That would mean that Spain would have to
spend almost 65 billion euros [$67.7 billion]. That is impossible,
because we do not have that economic capacity,” Ortega told VOA.</p>
<p>“No political program would ask for an increase in military spending
to reach 3, 4 or 5% … because that would be in some way making
sacrifices in the social security sphere. And the Spanish population
would penalize that with their vote at the polls,” Ortega added.</p>
<p>Lithuania boost</p>
<p>Trump does have some support in Europe. Lithuania plans to raise
defense spending to 5% or 6% of GDP by 2026. Announcing the increase on
January 17, Lithuanian Minister of Defense Dovile Sakaliene said the
policy was a response to regional threats.</p>
<p>“We are fitting in with NATO defense plans, which are vital to our
region,” he said.</p>
<p>Poland and Estonia have also indicated their intention to boost
defense spending toward Trump’s target of 5%.</p>
<p>France has also urged allies to invest more, although Paris only met
the 2% target itself in 2023.</p>
<p>“What will we do in Europe tomorrow if our American ally withdraws
its warships from the Mediterranean? If they send their fighter jets
from the Atlantic to the Pacific?” French President Emmanuel Macron said
Jan. 20 in an address to members of the French military. “These are
scenarios that we need to prepare for. These are the scenarios that we
are preparing for.”</p>
<p>At his first NATO summit as U.S. president in 2017, Trump berated
other members for failing to spend enough on defense. European allies,
including Spain, are braced for further robust diplomacy ahead of the
next summit, scheduled to be held in The Hague in June.</p>

id="teen-skaters-group-of-hunters-and-students-among-victims-of-air-crash">Teen
skaters, group of hunters and students among victims of air crash</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WICHITA, KANSAS — The victims of a crash between an American Airlines
jet and an Army helicopter included teen figure skaters returning from a
national meet with their mothers and coaches, an Ohio college student
coming from her grandfather’s funeral, two Chinese nationals and a group
of hunters headed back from a guided trip in Kansas.</p>
<p>They were among 60 travelers and four crew members on board the
commercial flight late Wednesday when it collided with the Black Hawk
helicopter, which was carrying three soldiers. Officials say there were
no survivors.</p>
<p>As the search for remains continued Thursday, communities grieved.
Faith leaders held a vigil Thursday in the city council chambers. “The
only way we will get through this is together,” said the Rev. Pamela
Hughes Mason of Wichita’s St. Paul AME Church.</p>
<p>American Airlines set up a hotline as well as centers in Washington
and Wichita for people searching for information about family members
who may have been aboard the downed flight.</p>
<p>Here’s what we know about some of the people killed in Wednesday
night’s crash:</p>
<p>From the Skating Club of Boston</p>
<p>Skaters Jinna Han and Spencer Lane were among those killed, according
to Doug Zeghibe, CEO of the Skating Club of Boston. Their mothers, Jin
Han and Christine Lane, as well as their coaches Evgenia Shishkova and
Vadim Naumov also died. Han and Lane, who was about 16, were returning
from the U.S. Figure Skating Championships.</p>
<p>“We watched Jinna just grow up here from just a tiny little tyke into
this amazingly mature 13-year-old,” he said. “A great performer, a great
competitor, and off the ice, a great kid.”</p>
<p>Spencer Lane, who was from Barrington, Rhode Island, took part in his
first professional show in December with Elin Schran’s company, Joy
Skate Productions.</p>
<p>“He started to discover this connection with the audience and that
joy that he was giving to other people through his gift,” Schran
said.</p>
<p>In a statement, the Lane family recalled Christine Lane for both her
singular talents and her dedication to parenting. “Christine exuded
creativity throughout her life, using her formal graphic design training
as a jumping-off point for seemingly endless creative pursuits across
areas such as photography, quilting, knitting, and more. She brought
even greater passion to her role as a mother to Spencer and his brother
Milo,” the family said.</p>
<p>Their coaches, Shishkova and Naumov, won the pairs title at the 1994
world championships in Chiba, Japan. The Russia-born pair also competed
twice in the Olympics.</p>
<p>More young athletes and coaches</p>
<p>Skating organizations in Philadelphia and the Washington area also
said some of their young athletes had been aboard the plane.</p>
<p>Several athletes on the flight had attended a development camp held
after the U.S. Figure Skating Championships ended Sunday in Wichita,
Kansas.</p>
<p>Wichita Skating Center manager Sean O’Reilly said the championships
brought a “groundswell of positivity,” drawing enthusiastic parents and
young athletes from across the U.S. He was “gutted” to learn some of
those skaters had been killed.</p>
<p>In Virginia’s Loudoun County, a coach at a skating club was also
identified as among the passengers, Virginia Rep. Suhas Subramanyam
confirmed. The club, Ashburn Ice House, said that its “figure skating
community has been directly affected,” but did not give further
details.</p>
<p>Students</p>
<p>Students and parents at Cedarville University in Ohio said one of the
passengers on the plane was Grace Maxwell, a junior majoring in
mechanical engineering. Maxwell’s father, Dean Maxwell, said she was
returning to campus from her home in Wichita, Kansas, after attending
her grandfather’s funeral, The Wichita Eagle reported.</p>
<p>Grace Maxwell had been working on a project this semester to create a
hand-stabilizing device to help a boy in the area feed himself instead
of relying on others, the university said in a statement.</p>
<p>“Grace was a quiet person with a keen interest in helping others
through engineering,” said Tim Norman, who served as her secondary
adviser.</p>
<p>Three other students from schools in Fairfax County, Virginia, and
six parents from the district were also on board the plane,
superintendent Michelle Reid said in a letter to families. She did not
identify them, but she said the students were from different schools and
that two of the parents were current or former district staffers.</p>
<p>Chinese citizens, Philippines police officer</p>
<p>Chinese citizens and a cop from the Philippines Philippine Police
Col. Pergentino Malabed Jr., who headed the supply management division
of the national police, was among the dead.</p>
<p>He had traveled to the U.S. to inspect equipment the Philippines was
planning to purchase for its 232,000-member force, according to the
Philippine police.</p>
<p>“His untimely passing is a profound loss to the Philippine National
Police, where he served with honor, with integrity and dedication
throughout his career,” Philippine police said in a statement.</p>
<p>The Chinese Embassy in the U.S. said two Chinese nationals were also
among the victims. It did not offer further details. The country’s
Ministry of Foreign Affairs offered its condolences for the crash
victims and requested the U.S. to “promptly report any progress with the
search and rescue and find out the cause of the accident as soon as
possible.”</p>
<p>Hunters headed home from a trip</p>
<p>Seven people returning from a guided hunting trip in Kansas were
killed, according to a Facebook post by Fowl Plains, the guide
service.</p>
<p>The Fowl Plains team said they had grown close to the hunters on
board the flight over the years and considered them to be family
members. The post doesn’t identify the hunters by name, but it says they
had spent the past week on a guided hunt, “laughing, talking about our
families and sharing memories.”</p>
<p>“Heartbroken is an understatement,” the company said.</p>
<p>Members of a Maryland union</p>
<p>Those killed also included four steamfitters, all members of a United
Association union local in suburban Maryland, union leaders said in a
social media post Thursday.</p>
<p>“Our focus now is on providing support and care to the families of
our brothers as we continue to gather more information in the coming
days,” said the post by UA General President Mark McManus and Chris
Madello, the business manager of Local 602.</p>
<p>From the military</p>
<p>The victims also include three soldiers who were aboard the
helicopter. Officials said their remains will be at Air Force Mortuary
Affairs Operations at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware. That office
coordinates the dignified transfer of fallen service members. The
officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details not yet
announced.</p>
<p>No identities of the crew have been released. But the wife of one of
the helicopter pilots said on Facebook that her husband, Andrew Eaves of
Noxubee County, Mississippi, was killed.</p>
<p>In a phone call, Carrie Eaves confirmed the post was hers. “We ask
that you pray for our family and friends and for all the other families
that are suffering today. We ask for peace while we grieve,” her post
read.</p>
<p>The three soldiers were doing an annual night proficiency training
flight, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said, adding they were a “fairly
experienced crew.” Officials were notifying relatives, he said.</p>

confirms North Dakota’s Burgum as Trump interior secretary</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The U.S. Senate on Thursday confirmed Doug Burgum, the former
governor of North Dakota, as President Donald Trump’s interior
secretary.</p>
<p>The vote was 79-18.</p>
<p>Burgum, 68, will lead an agency that guides the use of 202 million
hectares of federal and tribal land, a fifth of the nation’s surface
area.</p>
<p>He is expected to pursue Trump’s goal of maximizing energy and
mineral production on public lands, likely by ratcheting up new leasing
in oil-producing states like Wyoming and New Mexico and in the Gulf of
Mexico, which Trump has said is now officially called the Gulf of
America.</p>
<p>A wealthy former software executive, Burgum has portrayed himself as
a traditional, business-minded conservative.</p>
<p>During his nomination hearing, Burgum said he would expand oil and
gas drilling rights auctions and support permitting reforms that could
speed development of energy projects like transmission lines and
pipelines.</p>
<p>His comments signaled a sharp turn in federal policy after former
President Joe Biden’s administration sought to limit oil and gas
drilling on federal lands and promote renewable energy sources like wind
and solar as part of its climate change agenda.</p>
<p>Burgum ran against Trump for the Republican presidential nomination
before quitting and becoming a Trump supporter. He is also being
considered to head a new national council to coordinate policies to
boost U.S. energy output.</p>

id="judge-extends-court-monitoring-agreement-for-children-in-customs-and-border-protection-custody">Judge
extends court-monitoring agreement for children in Customs and Border
Protection custody</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>McALLEN, TEXAS — A federal judge extended a court agreement on
Thursday ensuring safe and sanitary conditions for migrant children in
federal custody a day after U.S. Customs and Border Protection was set
to begin self-monitoring.</p>
<p>The agreement originally ended Wednesday, but District Judge Dolly M.
Gee in California decided to extend it by 18 months.</p>
<p>“CBP is not yet capable of wholly fulfilling its responsibilities
under the 2022 Settlement and the FSA (Flores Settlement Agreement)
without the additional support provided by the JCM (Juvenile Care
Monitor) and the Court,” the judge wrote in her order.</p>
<p>Customs and Border Protection did not immediately respond to a
request for comment.</p>
<p>A court-appointed monitor will continue to visit and report on
conditions for children in custody at U.S. Customs and Border Protection
facilities in the Rio Grande Valley and El Paso, Texas.</p>
<p>Concerns were initially raised during the first Trump administration
when reports surfaced of children separated from family for weeks and
held in poor sanitary conditions. In 2019, a Guatemalan teenager died in
custody as a result of a flu outbreak and a lack of proper medical care
in a federal facility in Weslaco, Texas.</p>
<p>The parties reached an agreement that was implemented in July 2022
for 2½ years. It allowed a court monitor to keep track of progress made
by Customs and Border Protection. In the last report filed in December,
the monitor noted positive changes while also mentioning a continued
practice of separating some parents from their children during their
time in custody.</p>
<p>The monitor later told the court of discrepancies with Customs and
Border Protection data suggesting the agency underreported the number of
children who had exceeded the recommended time in custody of three
days.</p>
<p>Customs and Border Protection was scheduled to begin self-monitoring
its facilities on Wednesday. The agency said in December it was ready
for the task after issuing new guidance on family unity and increased
training on detention policies, guidelines and regulations that rolled
back court oversight under the Biden administration. Plaintiffs argued
the agency was not ready, citing testimony from minors held in Customs
and Border Protection facilities, and they requested the renewal of the
court agreement.</p>
<p>“No child should be forced to spend weeks inside a windowless pod in
dirty clothes with no access to the outdoors. We are relieved the Court
ruled to force CBP to meet its obligations under the settlement,” Mishan
Wroe, senior attorney for the National Youth Law Center, said in a
statement.</p>
<p>Trump officials have said they plan to end “catch-and-release”
policies and stop the release of migrants into the U.S. while they wait
for immigration court hearings. The changes could result in longer
detention times exceeding the court-recommended 72 hours for
families.</p>

<h2 id="dick-button-olympic-great-and-voice-of-skating-dies-at-95">Dick
Button, Olympic great and voice of skating, dies at 95</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Dick Button was more than the most accomplished men’s
figure skater in history. He was one of his sport’s greatest innovators
and promoters.</p>
<p>Button, winner of two Olympic gold medals and five consecutive world
championships, died Thursday, said his son, Edward, who did not provide
a cause. He was 95.</p>
<p>As an entrepreneur and broadcaster, Button promoted skating and its
athletes, transforming a niche sport into the showpiece of every Winter
Olympics.</p>
<p>“Dick was one of the most important figures in our sport,” Scott
Hamilton said. “There wasn’t a skater after Dick who wasn’t helped by
him in some way.”</p>
<p>Button’s impact began after World War II. He was the first U.S. men’s
champion — and his country’s youngest at age 16 — when that competition
returned in 1946. Two years later, he took the title at the St. Moritz
Olympics, competing outdoors. He performed the first double axel in any
competition and became the first American to win the men’s event.</p>
<p>“By the way, that jump had a cheat on it,” Button told the U.S.
Olympic Committee website. “But listen, I did it and that was what
counted.”</p>
<p>That began his dominance of international skating, and U.S. amateur
sports. He was the first figure skater to win the prestigious Sullivan
Award in 1949 — no other figure skater won it until Michelle Kwan in
2001.</p>
<p>In 1952, while a Harvard student, he won a second gold at the Oslo
Games, making more history with the first triple jump (a loop) in
competition. Soon after, he won a fifth world title, then gave up his
eligibility as an amateur. All Olympic sports were subject to an
amateur/professional division at the time.</p>
<p>“I had achieved everything I could have dreamed of doing as a
skater,” said Button, who earned a law degree from Harvard in 1956. “I
was able to enjoy the Ice Capades (show) and keep my hand in skating,
and that was very important to me.”</p>
<p>With the Emmy Award-winning Button as the TV analyst, viewers got to
learn not only the basics but the nuances of a sport foreign to many as
he frankly broke down the performances. He became as much a fixture on
ABC’s Wide World of Sports as Jim McKay and the hapless ski jumper
tumbling down the slope.</p>
<p>“Dick Button is the custodian of the history of figure skating and
its quintessential voice,” 1988 Olympic champion Brian Boitano said in
Button’s autobiography. “He made the words ‘lutz’ and ‘salchow’ part of
our everyday vocabulary.”</p>
<p>After a 1961 plane crash killed the entire U.S. figure skating team
on the way to the world championships, which then were canceled, Button
persuaded ABC Sports executive Roone Arledge to televise the 1962 event
on Wide World. That’s when he joined the network as a commentator.</p>
<p>Button’s death coincided with another tragedy in the skating world,
Wednesday night’s crash of an American Airlines flight that collided
with an Army helicopter and plummeted into the Potomac River outside
Washington, D.C., killing everyone on board. Two teenage figure skaters,
their mothers, and two former world champions who were coaching at the
Skating Club of Boston were among the 14 people killed from the skating
community.</p>
<p>Button skated for the Boston club and remained close to it for the
rest of his life. The trophy room at the club is named in his honor.</p>
<p>He also provided opportunities for skaters to make money after their
competitive careers. He ran professional events he created for TV for
years, attracting many top names in the sport — Hamilton, Torvill and
Dean, Kristi Yamaguchi, Kurt Browning and Katarina Witt.</p>
<p>Button’s Candid Productions, formed 1959, also produced such
made-for-TV programs as Battle of the Network Stars. He also dabbled in
acting, but the rink was his realm.</p>
<p>“Dick Button created an open and honest space in figure skating
broadcasting where no topic or moment was off-limits,” said Johnny Weir,
the three-time U.S. champion and current NBC Sports figure skating
analyst. “He told it like it was, even when his opinion wasn’t a popular
one. His zingers were always in my mind when I would perform for him,
and I wanted to make him as happy and proud as I would my coaches.</p>
<p>“I think that is something very special about commentating figure
skating. As an athlete, we rarely have an opportunity to speak, and we
rely on the TV voices to tell our story for us. Nobody could do it like
Mr. Button.”</p>

economy grows solid 2.3% in October-December on eve of Trump return to
White House</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — A humming American economy ended 2024 on a solid note
with consumer spending continuing to drive growth, and ahead of what
could be a significant change in direction under a Trump
administration.</p>
<p>The Commerce Department reported Thursday that gross domestic product
— the economy’s output of goods and services — expanded at a 2.3% annual
rate from October through December.</p>
<p>For the full year, the economy grew a healthy 2.8%, compared with
2.9% in 2023.</p>
<p>The fourth-quarter growth was a tick below the 2.4% economists had
expected, according to a survey of forecasters by the data firm
FactSet.</p>
<p>Consumer spending grew at a 4.2% pace, fastest since January-March
2023 and up from 3.7% in July-September last year. But business
investment tumbled as investment in equipment plunged after two straight
strong quarters.</p>
<p>Wednesday’s report also showed persistent inflationary pressure at
the end of 2024. The Federal Reserve’s favored inflation gauge — called
the personal consumption expenditures index, or PCE — rose at a 2.3%
annual pace last quarter, up from 1.5% in the third quarter and above
the Fed’s 2% target. Excluding volatile food and energy prices,
so-called core PCE inflation was 2.5%, up from 2.2% in the
July-September quarter.</p>
<p>A drop in business inventories shaved 0.93 percentage points off
fourth-quarter growth.</p>
<p>But a category within the GDP data that measures the economy’s
underlying strength rose at a healthy 3.2% annual rate from July through
September, slipping from 3.4% in the third quarter. This category
includes consumer spending and private investment but excludes volatile
items like exports, inventories and government spending.</p>
<p>Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics,
said that figure “suggests the economy remains strong, particularly
given the fourth-quarter disruptions,’’ including a strike at Boeing and
the aftermath of two hurricanes.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump has inherited a healthy economy. Growth has
been steady and unemployment low — 4.1% in December.</p>
<p>The economy has proven remarkably resilient after the Fed’s inflation
fighters raised rates 11 times in 2022 and 2023 to combat the biggest
surge in consumer prices since the 1980s. Instead of sliding into a
recession, as most economists predicted, GDP kept expanding. Growth has
now topped 2% in nine of the last 10 quarters.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the Fed left its benchmark interest rate unchanged
after making three cuts since September. With the economy rolling along,
Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters, “we do not need to be in a
hurry’’ to make more cuts. The Fed is also cautious because progress
against inflation has stalled in recent months after falling from
four-decade highs hit in mid-2022.</p>
<p>The European Central Bank cut its benchmark rate by a quarter point
Thursday, underlining the contrast between more robust growth in the
U.S. economy and stagnation in Europe, which recorded zero growth at the
end of last year.</p>
<p>The U.S. economic outlook has become more cloudy, however. Trump has
promised to cut taxes and ease regulations on business, which could
speed GDP growth. But his plan to impose big taxes on imports and to
deport millions of immigrants working in the United States illegally
could mean slower growth and higher prices.</p>
<p>Trump said last week that he would lower oil prices and then
“demand’’ lower interest rates – a topic he said he’d take up with
Powell. But the Fed chair deflected questions about Trump’s comments
Wednesday and said he’d had no contact with the president.</p>
<p>Trump has also tried to reshape the federal government, offering
buyouts to workers and issuing a memo Monday night freezing federal
grants, then rescinding the memo Wednesday after a public outcry.</p>
<p>Citing the “squeeze’’ on the federal government, Ashworth wrote in a
commentary,”we wouldn’t be surprised to see a reversal in the first
quarter. As a starting point, we expect first-quarter GDP growth to slow
marginally below 2%.’’</p>
<p>Thursday’s GDP release was the first of three Commerce Department
estimates of October-December growth.</p>

to boost military spending in the face of the threat from Russia. Spain

crash mars long record of US aviation safety</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A collision between a passenger jet and U.S. Army helicopter near
Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport late Wednesday marked the
first time in more than 15 years that there had been a mass fatality
event in U.S. airspace related to commercial aviation.</p>
<p>The accident, which killed a reported 67 people, took place while
American Airlines Flight 5342 was making its final approach to the
runway. The Bombardier CRJ700 regional jet and the Sikorsky H-60,
commonly known as a Black Hawk, collided only a few hundred meters above
the ground, officials said.</p>
<p>The plane was carrying 60 passengers and four crew members. There
were three service members aboard the military helicopter, including the
pilot. Both aircraft crashed into the icy waters of the Potomac River,
and authorities said Thursday that they didn’t believe there were any
survivors.</p>
<p>The accident took place in darkness at 8:47 p.m., and no significant
weather problems were reported. As of Thursday, authorities had not
identified the cause of the accident.</p>
<p>However, The New York Times on Thursday, citing an “internal
preliminary Federal Aviation Administration safety report” it reviewed,
reported that staffing at the airport’s air traffic control tower was
“not normal” Wednesday night. The newspaper said a single air traffic
controller was directing incoming and outgoing plane traffic as well as
helicopter traffic in the area. Those jobs are usually split between two
controllers.</p>
<p>Experts consider crash an anomaly</p>
<p>Aviation experts said as tragic as the accident was, it should be
considered an anomaly in an air traffic system that has been notably
free of major disasters for many years.</p>
<p>“Some of it was luck. Some of it is technology. And mostly it was the
tremendous job that the pilots and air traffic controllers do,” former
United Airlines pilot Captain Ross “Rusty” Aimer told VOA.</p>
<p>“They literally perform miracles every day because our system is
extremely congested everywhere you go. … And Washington National Airport
is, perhaps in my 60 years in aviation, one of the most demanding and
busiest airports in the world.”</p>
<p>It is necessary to look back to 2009 to find a comparable commercial
disaster in U.S. airspace. At that time, a Colgan Air jet en route from
New Jersey to Buffalo, New York, stalled during its approach and crashed
into a house, killing 49 passengers and crew, as well as one individual
in the house.</p>
<p>In 2013, an Asiana Airlines jet crashed while landing in San
Francisco, California. Two passengers who were not wearing seat belts
were killed when they were thrown from the plane, and another person
died after being struck by an emergency response vehicle on the tarmac.
There were 187 other people who suffered injuries, many serious, but no
other fatalities.</p>
<p>While there have been a number of other high-profile incidents
involving U.S. airlines recently, none involved mass casualties. Last
year, for example, a door plug blew out of an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737
Max in midflight, but the plane landed safely, though some passengers
suffered minor injuries.</p>
<p>Experts stressed that such events occur in only a tiny fraction of
the millions of flights that take place in the U.S. every year.</p>
<p>Robert W. Mann Jr., an airline industry analyst and former senior
airline executive, told VOA that the U.S. commercial aviation industry
experiences an extremely low level of safety incidents and “an even
lower level of fatality accidents.”</p>
<p>“That’s not luck, that’s effort,” he said. “We’re thankful to have so
many professionals in the operating environment. In the oversight
environment, focus on safety is the number one priority.”</p>
<p>Crash occurs in crowded airspace</p>
<p>The accident took place in one of the most crowded — and highly
regulated — sectors of airspace in the United States. The Washington
region has three major airports, 11 regional airports and dozens of
heliports — not counting the multiple military installations in the
region with aviation operations.</p>
<p>Keith M. Cianfrani, a retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel who served
as a flight instructor and an accident investigator, told VOA he flew
helicopters in the area where the accident took place while on active
duty and later as a commercial pilot.</p>
<p>“It’s congested,” said Cianfrani, who now works as an aviation safety
consultant and adjunct professor at Embry‑Riddle Aeronautical
University. “So, it’s not unusual to cross the path of an incoming
[plane] as long as there is traffic separation.”</p>
<p>Traffic separation refers to the distance, in time and space, between
aircraft in the same area.</p>
<p>But because of the congestion, there are very clear rules about where
aircraft are allowed to be and when they can be there, Cianfrani said.
Helicopters are required to follow specific routes when passing through
the region, he said, calling it “very uncommon” to see something like
Wednesday’s crash take place.</p>
<p>“As a whole, the general aviation industry in the United States is
outstanding,” he said. “They all have to adhere to what we call SMS —
safety management systems. On a regular basis, they get audited. They
have an internal audit program, and they’re constantly being looked at
by people like myself going in and auditing their safety program. So,
it’s outstanding.”</p>
<p>Turnover in federal aviation oversight</p>
<p>Wednesday’s accident took place at a time when leadership of the
federal agencies in charge of flight safety is being overhauled by the
new administration of President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>The day after his inauguration, Trump dismissed Transportation
Security Administration Administrator David Pekoske and disbanded the
Aviation Security Advisory Committee, which provides the federal
government with recommendations for aviation safety. He also initiated a
hiring freeze, preventing the hiring of new air traffic controllers.</p>
<p>Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, who oversees the Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA), was sworn in the day before the
crash.</p>
<p>Michael Whitaker, who served as administrator of the FAA in former
President Joe Biden’s administration, announced in December that he
would resign his post on January 20, the day Trump took office.</p>
<p>The new president has not yet nominated a permanent replacement for
Whitaker, but on Thursday he named Chris Rocheleau, a former Air Force
officer who has spent more than 20 years at the FAA, as interim
administrator.</p>
<p>Trump spreads blame</p>
<p>With recovery teams still searching for bodies in the Potomac River
on Thursday, Trump held a press conference and attempted to pin blame
for the accident on the previous presidential administration. He
asserted, with no proof or evidence, that the Biden administration had
lowered hiring standards for air traffic controllers as part of its
“diversity, equity, and inclusion” efforts.</p>
<p>Trump took particular aim at former Transportation Secretary Pete
Buttigieg, saying he had driven the agency “right into the ground with
his diversity.”</p>
<p>Buttigieg responded with a post on the social media platform X.</p>
<p>“Despicable,” Buttigieg wrote. “As families grieve, Trump should be
leading, not lying. We put safety first, drove down close calls, grew
Air Traffic Control, and had zero commercial airline crash fatalities
out of millions of flights on our watch.</p>
<p>“President Trump now oversees the military and the FAA,” he added.
“One of his first acts was to fire and suspend some of the key personnel
who helped keep our skies safe. Time for the President to show actual
leadership and explain what he will do to prevent this from happening
again.”</p>

Trump faces tough task to denuclearize North Korea</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The White House says President Donald Trump is going to
pursue the denuclearization of North Korea, although analysts say that
is easier said than done.</p>
<p>White House National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes told
VOA Korean via email this week that “President Trump had a good
relationship with [North Korean leader] Kim Jong Un,” and that Trump’s
“mix of toughness and diplomacy led to the first-ever leader-level
commitment to complete denuclearization.”</p>
<p>Trump and Kim met three times in 2018-19, in Singapore, Hanoi and
over the inter-Korean border at Panmunjom.</p>
<p>Trump, who has recently called North Korea “a nuclear power,” said in
an interview with Fox News last week that he would reach out to Kim
again, adding, “He liked me, and I got along with him.”</p>
<p>Commitment to denuclearization</p>
<p>Former U.S. government officials say there is no doubt that Trump is
serious about resuming talks with Kim.</p>
<p>Susan Thornton, a former senior U.S. diplomat for Asian affairs, told
VOA Korean on Wednesday via email it “seems clear that President Trump
plans to pick up where he left off with Kim Jong Un in his first
administration.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thornton, who was acting assistant secretary of state for East Asian
and Pacific affairs during the first Trump administration, said Trump
would “like to hold Kim and North Korea to the 2018 Singapore joint
statement that included Kim’s commitment to the complete
denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.”  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>However, “much has changed since then, and Kim’s hand is stronger, so
it won’t be easy,” Thornton said, referring to Pyongyang’s development
of more advanced weapons.</p>
<p>The state-run Korean Central News Agency, or KCNA, reported Wednesday
that Kim said it was “indispensable” to bolster nuclear forces, as North
Korea continues to face “confrontations with the most vicious, hostile
countries.”</p>
<p>Last Saturday, the North test-fired what it said were sea-to-surface
strategic cruise-guided missiles. Kim, who inspected the test launch,
said the country’s war deterrence means are “being perfected more
thoroughly,” according to KCNA.</p>
<p>Evans Revere, former acting secretary for East Asia and Pacific
affairs during the George W. Bush administration, told VOA Korean on the
phone Wednesday that Kim would agree to come back to the table if he
believed reengaging with Washington “could help him attain any of his
own goals with respect to his nuclear and missile programs and relations
with the United States.”</p>
<p>Revere is skeptical that any of Kim’s goals would include his
regime’s denuclearization.</p>
<p>“The North Koreans might dangle the possibility of a discussion about
denuclearization to attract the United States into a dialogue, but it
would not be a serious proposal,” he said. “Quite frankly, they are
determined to keep their weapons, keep their capabilities, which they
regard as essential to their own existence.”</p>
<p>Daunting task</p>
<p>Frank Aum, a senior expert on North Korea at the U.S. Institute of
Peace who worked at the Department of Defense from 2010 to 2017, said
denuclearization is not a realistic goal to achieve in the near or
medium term. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“The best thing Trump can do to increase the odds of North Korea’s
engagement is to resolve Russia’s war in Ukraine, which would decrease
North Korea’s leverage and signal that a U.S. offer better than the one
in Hanoi might be on the table,” Aum said in an email to VOA Korean.</p>
<p>North Korea has sent about 10,000 troops to Russia to help Moscow in
its war against Ukraine. In return, North Korea has received military or
financial assistance, according to U.S. and South Korean officials.</p>
<p>The February 2019 talks, in which Trump and Kim met for the second
time, collapsed after Kim asked for full lifting of sanctions in
exchange for the dismantling of the country’s main nuclear complex in
Yongbyon, about 100 kilometers north of Pyongyang. Trump demanded more
should be done on Kim’s end.</p>
<p>Aum said Kim would likely not have budged from his position
then. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Trump may probe to see if he can get Kim to accept partial sanctions
relief instead, like he tried at Hanoi, or offer more for Yongbyon,” Aum
said. “It seems clear that Kim will not offer any more security
concessions than Yongbyon.”</p>
<p>Sydney Seiler, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, told VOA Korean via email on Wednesday that “for
now, it is unlikely any meeting, if it takes place, will reasonably be
related to denuclearization.”</p>
<p>“Trump will likely seek to keep the ultimate goal of denuclearization
alive while exploring ways in which to reduce the threat,” Seiler
said.</p>
<p>Referring to recent comments by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio
on the failure of sanctions to halt the North Korean nuclear program,
Seiler speculated that sanctions relief may be offered for significant
steps in the new talks between Washington and Pyongyang.</p>
<p>Seiler added that military exercises and extended deterrence may also
be reduced in terms of their frequency, volume and scale, in exchange
for a halt or slowing of Kim’s long-range missile launches and nuclear
tests.</p>
<p>In June 2018, Trump decided to suspend major military exercises with
South Korea in an apparent gesture of good faith, right after his first
meeting with Kim in Singapore. It raised some fears among South Koreans
that such a move could weaken defense against the North.</p>

id="us-lawmakers-weigh-cost-of-foreign-aid-freeze-in-competition-with-china">US
lawmakers weigh cost of foreign aid freeze in competition with
China</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. lawmakers Thursday weighed the impact that President Donald
Trump’s 90-day foreign aid freeze will have on competition with
China.</p>
<p>Trump signed an executive order within hours of being sworn in as
president ordering a halt to all U.S. international assistance while the
new administration determines whether the aid aligns with his “America
First” policy.</p>
<p>Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jim Risch said the move
was a necessary step to prioritize fiscal responsibility as the U.S.
faces a debt of $36 trillion.</p>
<p>“This is obviously a work in progress,” Risch, a Republican from
Idaho, said Thursday.</p>
<p>“It was intended to underscore the fact that we’re going into debt at
the rate of $1 trillion every 100 days. I think that has certainly been
underscored as a result of this. If you think this is bad, when our
debtors come and want their money and we can’t pay it, that’s going to
be really bad,” Risch said. “It’s caused everyone to take a breath and
look at how we’re spending our money, where we’re spending our money,
seeing that it’s done as efficiently as possible. Admittedly, there have
been some inconveniences along the line, but they’re continuing to work
on this.”</p>
<p>Democrats said the pause in aid creates a void that will be filled by
the People’s Republic of China (PRC).</p>
<p>“I’m particularly concerned about the expansion of China’s influence,
both at home and abroad, as a result of a freeze on our foreign
assistance — and, in particular, the way it’s implemented in its
cascading effect,” Democratic Senator Chris Coons of Delaware said in a
hearing about Chinese influence abroad.</p>
<p>“There is nothing China wants to do more than limit the reach of our
global influence, than to reinforce its imprint,” Coons added. “[That
way] we’re an unreliable partner with countries throughout the world and
particularly in the Global South, and my concern is that we put our
security, our economic and our diplomatic interest at risk with an
abrupt pause that puts a halt to actions to counter malign activity by
the PRC, to advance to invest in infrastructure.”</p>
<p>But Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the top Democrat on the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Democrats should not be the
only ones concerned about evaluating and restoring the aid.</p>
<p>“I hope that all of you on the other side of the aisle will share
your concerns with the administration and point out that this is not a
partisan issue,” she said. “This is about what are we going to do to
ensure that our influence continues around the world in the interest of
our own national security.”</p>
<p>Around the world, U.S.-funded foreign aid programs have already begun
shutting down their programming and laying off staff in the wake of the
freeze. The U.S. is the world’s largest foreign aid provider but is
outspent by China in some areas. According to the Government
Accountability Office, between 2013 and 2022, China spent $679 billion
on global infrastructure projects compared with the United States’ $76
billion.</p>
<p>“Foreign aid is a really important arrow in the quiver of U.S.
national security, along with other tools such as diplomacy, military
assistance and so on,” Jennifer Lind, an associate professor of
government at Dartmouth College, told lawmakers Thursday. “And so
ideally, we would want to be using all of our different tools in a
coordinated fashion to achieve our objectives. For that reason, I think
it’s understandable if the administration wants to take a short pause
and assess: Are we using the right tools in the right way?”</p>
<p>But Melanie Hart of the Atlantic Council said the freeze “is hobbling
America’s ability to compete with China in every domain.”</p>
<p>“Over $1 billion more foreign military financing for Taiwan. Frozen.
NDI [National Democratic Institute] and IRI [International Republican
Institute] are shutting down global operations. Human rights
organizations — frozen,” she said. “Washington has effectively abandoned
the Hong Kong pro-democracy movement.”</p>
<p>Hart said she understood the administration’s desire to maximize the
strategic focus of the aid and appreciated the State Department’s
waivers, but that “this broad freeze hobbles America at a moment when we
are in the battle of the century.”</p>
<p>“It is a massive gift to Beijing. The longer it goes on, the harder
it will be to regain the ground we are already losing today, tomorrow
and this week,” Hart said.</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a waiver last Friday
unfreezing emergency food assistance and earlier this week issued
another waiver unfreezing humanitarian assistance.</p>
<p>The top Democrat on the House Select Committee on Strategic
Competition with China on Thursday welcomed Rubio’s waivers but said
more had to be done.</p>
<p>“While periodic review of foreign assistance programs’ contribution
to U.S. national security is necessary, abruptly freezing any foreign
assistance directly cedes ground to our foremost adversary: the CCP,”
said Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, a Democrat from Illinois, in a
statement.</p>
<p>“At a time when the CCP is aggressively investing abroad, rerouting
supply chains and buying authoritarian favor, the United States must
double down on foreign assistance — not kneecap ourselves.”</p>

<h2 id="after-fires-los-angeles-gets-moonshot-moment-to-rebuild">After
fires, Los Angeles gets moonshot moment to rebuild</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>As Los Angeles recovers from its devastating wildfires, environmental
engineers, urban planners and natural disaster experts are casting
forward with visions of what could come next for neighborhoods that have
been reduced to ash and rubble.</p>
<p>Apartment buildings could spring up where strip malls and parking
lots once stood, with locals walking to ground-floor shops, offices and
cafes, European-style.</p>
<p>The city could “infill” vertically to add affordable housing in safer
downtown areas, rather than outwards with more single-family homes on
fire-prone hills.</p>
<p>Some blocks could be turned into buffer zones, where no building was
allowed. And the city’s trademark palm trees, which burn like Roman
candles, could be replaced with fire-resistant native trees.</p>
<p>These are some of the bold ideas academics have for Los Angeles as it
recovers from the Eaton and Palisades fires, which killed 28 people and
damaged or destroyed nearly 16,000 structures. Together, the blazes
charred 152 square kilometers — an area larger than Paris.</p>
<p>The city is far from rebuilding, with many people only now being
allowed back to their burned neighborhoods. When construction does
begin, few of the dozen experts Reuters spoke to expected their dream
plans to be adopted, citing factors ranging from lack of future
insurance coverage to political pressure to rebuild as before.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, experts in urban development, climate change and housing
said Los Angeles has a chance to think outside the box. Many also said
there should be no rush to rebuild. Instead, residents of Pacific
Palisades and Altadena should be afforded time to decide what their
future communities should look like and dream big.</p>
<p>“The biggest thing is how do we promote infill development in safer
areas,” said Emily Schlickman, assistant professor of landscape
architecture and environmental design at the University of California,
Davis, who suggests retreating from fire-prone peripheries.</p>
<p>Model cities</p>
<p>Los Angeles could learn from cities like Kobe, Japan, decimated by a
1995 earthquake, where officials imposed a two-month building
moratorium, said Columbia University’s Jeffrey Schlegelmilch.</p>
<p>“One of the most important things is to give yourself time to come up
with a robust solution,” said Schlegelmilch, director of the National
Center for Disaster Preparedness at the university’s climate school.</p>
<p>Then there are Houston’s Harris County and the city of San Antonio,
Texas, which bought up homes and properties to reduce future flood risk.
In the case of Harris County, authorities offered willing sellers
pre-flood market values for homes flooded during Hurricane Harvey in
2017 then demolished them.</p>
<p>Char Miller, a professor of environmental analysis and history at
Pomona College in Claremont, California, is among those who point to
Texas’ experience. While buying up properties in Pacific Palisades and
Altadena would be costly, Miller said, it would be possible with the
financial support of the city, county, state and possibly insurers.</p>
<p>Burned-out lots could be turned into what he envisions as fire buffer
zones. While disruptive to residents, Miller believes many would be
willing to use the money to relocate.</p>
<p>“People go, ‘Yeah, I don’t want to be in danger, and you’re buying me
out. Yeah, thank you,’” said Miller.</p>
<p>He despairs at city and state efforts to fast-track redevelopment in
areas that burned at a similar housing density.</p>
<p>“They just pulled the plug on the moonshot,” Miller said.</p>
<p>Alice Hill, a senior fellow for energy and the environment at the
Council on Foreign Relations think tank, wants to see more green spaces
like playing fields and bike paths between fire-risk areas and
homes.</p>
<p>“It simply is unsafe to rebuild communities where they were, and
retreating may be the wisest approach,” Hill wrote in a Jan. 14
essay.</p>
<p>A little more panache</p>
<p>Other experts advocate rebuilding the communities but in a way that
will resist fire.</p>
<p>“The only way to do this impactfully is to do it communitywide so if
the fire gets in, it has a hard time moving on,” said Michael Gollner, a
professor of mechanical engineering at University of California,
Berkeley.</p>
<p>Gollner tests prototype houses to see how they handle flames. Homes
can be made more fire-resistant by moving a wooden fence back five feet
(1.5 meters), surrounding a house with gravel and putting mesh over
attic vents to stop embers, he said.</p>
<p>Then there is landscaping, a contentious subject for some
homeowners.</p>
<p>“Who wants to cut down their juniper? But come a wildfire, your
juniper is a torch,” said Gollner.</p>
<p>Ecologists suggest Los Angelenos replace palms, junipers and
eucalyptus with trees that evolved to survive fire, such as California
oaks. The species has thick bark that resists flames and leathery leaves
that burn slowly.</p>
<p>“There are lots of people who are working to plant oaks, and I think
there’s some effort in giving them more panache,” said Alexandra
Syphard, a San Diego-based wildfire ecologist at the Conservation
Biology Institute.</p>
<p>For Hussam Mahmoud, a professor in civil and environmental
engineering at Colorado State University, the key is predicting the path
of future fires.</p>
<p>He has developed a model that calculates which buildings will burn,
allowing a community to fire-harden “super spreader” structures, rather
than fully adapt every house to resist wildfires.</p>
<p>Hardening a home begins with using metal or concrete for a roof and
fire-retardant materials on the sides. Multipane windows are less likely
to break from the heat and cause a home to burn from within.</p>
<p>“When the fires hit L.A., it’s clear that nobody knew what was going
to happen, which buildings were more likely to burn,” said Mahmoud.</p>

id="republican-senator-airs-concerns-about-supporting-rfk-jr-to-be-us-health-secretary">Republican
senator airs concerns about supporting RFK Jr to be US health
secretary</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — A key Republican senator on Thursday said he was
struggling with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s nomination by President Donald
Trump to run the top U.S. health agency, saying he had reservations
about the nominee’s “misleading arguments” on vaccines.   </p>
<p>“Your past of undermining confidence in vaccines with unfounded or
misleading arguments concerns me,” Republican Senator Bill Cassidy, a
physician from Louisiana, told Kennedy. </p>
<p>“I have been struggling with the nomination,” he said at the end of
Thursday’s Senate health committee hearing to consider Kennedy to run
the massive Department of Health and Human Services. </p>
<p>“Does a 70-year-old man … who spent decades criticizing vaccines and
who’s financially vested in finding fault with vaccines, can he change
his attitudes and approach now that he’ll have the most important
position influencing vaccine policy in the United States?” Cassidy
said. </p>
<p>The hearing was the second in two days for Kennedy during which he
squared off with Democrats and some Republicans over his past comments
on vaccines, abortion and COVID-19 among other topics. </p>
<p>The Finance Committee, which Kennedy appeared before on Wednesday,
has not yet said if it will send Kennedy’s nomination to the full
Republican-controlled Senate, which has not rejected any of Trump’s
nominees so far. </p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Finance Committee said a vote could
potentially take place next week, but that one had not yet been
scheduled.   </p>
<p>Cassidy, who sits on both committees, told Kennedy at the end of
Thursday’s hearing that Kennedy would be hearing from him over the
weekend, presumably regarding questions he has over the
nomination.   </p>
<p>Kennedy’s nomination could fail to move to the Senate for
consideration if all Democrats on the Finance Committee voted against
him and were joined by Cassidy.   </p>
<p>During wide-ranging questioning on Thursday, Kennedy spoke more
confidently than the day prior, adjusting the characterization of
previous statements, and saying he would support the U.S. children’s
vaccination schedule, research and development for bird flu, and
scientific data on vaccine safety. </p>
<p>Kennedy also said he would address rapidly increasing rates of
chronic disease. </p>
<p>“Our country is not going to be destroyed because we get the marginal
tax rate wrong. It is going to be destroyed if we get this issue wrong,”
he said of chronic diseases. “And I am in a unique position to be able
to stop this epidemic.” </p>
<p>He was asked about comments he has made over decades, including that
it was “highly likely” that Lyme disease was a military bioweapon. He
said he never said that it was definitively created in a biolab.   </p>
<p>He would not answer a question from Senator Bernie Sanders about
whether he agreed that vaccines do not cause autism. He also said he did
not know if the coronavirus vaccine saved millions of lives. </p>
<p>“If you come out unequivocally, ‘vaccines are safe, it does not cause
autism’ that would have an incredible impact,” Cassidy said.   </p>
<p>Kennedy has said vaccines are linked to autism, and he opposed state
and federal restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic. The
causes of autism are unclear, though theories that childhood vaccines
cause autism have been widely debunked and are contrary to scientific
evidence.   </p>
<p>Kennedy, who founded the anti-vaccine group Children’s Health
Defense, argued during both hearings that he was not against vaccines.
The group has sued in state and federal courts over vaccines. </p>
<p>“News reports and many in the hearing yesterday have claimed that I’m
anti-vaccine and anti-industry. Well, I’m neither,” Kennedy said,
repeating that his children are vaccinated.   </p>
<p>Thursday’s hearing in front of the Senate Committee on Health,
Education, Labor and Pensions is a courtesy hearing with no vote
involved. However, Republican Senators Cassidy, Lisa Murkowski and Susan
Collins sit on the committee, all of whom are seen as potential swing
votes against Kennedy. </p>
<p>Supporters of Kennedy wearing “Make America Healthy Again” hats
crowded around the committee hearing room on Thursday, while some
opposing his confirmation wore “Reject RFK Jr” stickers on their
shirts. </p>
<p>‘Catastrophic’ impacts   </p>
<p>If confirmed, Kennedy would run HHS, which oversees more than $3
trillion in healthcare spending, including at the Food and Drug
Administration and the agency in charge of the Medicare and Medicaid
health insurance programs covering nearly half of all Americans.   </p>
<p>He said he would follow Trump’s direction on abortion and would hire
for his department those who are against abortion rights.   </p>
<p>Kennedy also said gender-affirming care for children has
“catastrophic” impacts and that children are not equipped to make
judgments about receiving such care. He said he would rescind a
Biden-era rule that requires medical providers who receive federal
funding to offer gender-affirming care.   </p>
<p>Kennedy said farmers should be offered an off-ramp from chemically
intensive agriculture, and that illness in farm communities is
“undoubtedly” related to the use of pesticides. Some farm and food
groups have expressed concern about Kennedy’s positions on pesticides
and food additives.   </p>
<p>Opposition groups have ramped up their efforts to persuade Republican
senators to vote against Kennedy. Caroline Kennedy, another member of
the storied American political family, on Tuesday urged senators to vote
against her cousin’s nomination, calling him a predator with dangerous
views on health care. </p>
<p>Kennedy has also faced scrutiny over his ties to Wisner Baum, a law
firm specializing in pharmaceutical drug injury cases. He has an
arrangement to earn 10% of fees awarded in contingency cases he refers
to the firm, according to a letter Kennedy wrote to an HHS ethics
official released last week. </p>
<p>If confirmed, Kennedy would retain that financial interest in cases
that do not directly impact the U.S. government, the letter said.   </p>
<p>If his nomination goes to the full Senate, Kennedy would need the
support of at least 50 senators, which would allow Vice President JD
Vance to cast another tie-breaking vote to confirm his nomination.</p>

<p>
The nation’s largest electricity market expects to be delivering a lot
more power through the end of the next decade — even more than it
expected last year.
</p>
<p>
PJM Interconnection, which covers some or all of 13 states (and
Washington, D.C.) between Maryland and Illinois, released its
<a href="https://insidelines.pjm.com/2025-long-term-load-forecast-report-predicts-significant-increase-in-electricity-demand/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>latest
long-term forecast</u></a> last week, projecting that its summer peak
demand would climb by almost half, from 155,000 megawatts in 2025 to
around 230,000 in 2039.
</p>
<p>
The electricity market attributed the increased demand to “the
proliferation of data centers, electrification of buildings and
vehicles, and manufacturing,” and noted
(<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/pjm-interconnection-forecast-electricity-data-centers-evs" target="_self"><u>not
for the first time</u></a>) that the demand surge comes at the same time
many fossil fuel power plants are scheduled to close, especially coal
plants. Already, some natural gas and even some
<a href="https://www.spglobal.com/commodity-insights/en/news-research/latest-news/electric-power/110524-us-power-generators-pump-the-brakes-on-coal-plant-retirements#:~:text=Duke%20Energy%20Indiana%2C%20in%20an,and%20natural%20gas%20through%202038." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>coal
plants in PJM</u></a>
and<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/coal-gas-plant-retirements" target="_self">
</a>elsewhere that were
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/coal-gas-plant-retirements" target="_self"><u>scheduled
to close</u></a> have seen their retirement dates pushed out in order to
handle forecast electricity demand.
</p>
<p>
This is just the latest eye-popping projection of forthcoming
electricity demand from PJM and others — last year, PJM forecast
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/pjm-interconnection-forecast-electricity-data-centers-evs" target="_self"><u>summer
peak demand of about 180,000 megawatts in 2035</u></a>, a figure that
jumped to around 220,000 megawatts in this year’s forecast.
</p>
<p>
While summer is typically when grids are most taxed due to heavy demand
from air conditioning, as more of daily life gets electrified —
especially home heating — winter demand is forecast to rise, too. PJM
forecast that its winter peak demand would go from 139,000 megawatts in
2025, or 88% of the summer peak, to 210,000 megawatts in 2039, or 95% of
its summer peak demand forecast for that year.
</p>
<p>
Systems are designed to accommodate their peak, but winter poses special
challenges for grids. Namely, the electric grid can freeze, with natural
gas plants and pipelines posing a special risk in cold weather — not to
mention that it’s typically not a great time for solar production,
either.
</p>
<p>
Aftab Khan, PJM’s executive vice president for operations, planning, and
security, said in a statement Thursday that much of the recent demand
increase was due to data centers growing “exponentially” in PJM’s
territory.
</p>
<p>
The disparity between future demand and foreseeable available supply in
the short term has already led to a colossal increase in “capacity”
payments within PJM, where generators are paid to guarantee they’ll be
able to deliver power in a crunch. These payments tend to favor coal,
natural gas, and nuclear power plants, which can produce power
(hopefully) in all weather conditions whenever it’s needed, in a way
that variable energy generation such as wind and solar — even when
backed up by batteries — cannot as yet.
</p>
<p>
Prices at the latest capacity auction were high enough to induce
Calpine, the independent power company that operates dozens of natural
gas power plants and recently announced a merger with Constellation, the
owner of the Three Mile Island nuclear plant, to say it would
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/pjm-natural-gas" target="_self"><u>look
at building new power plants</u></a> in the territory.
</p>
<p>
The expected relentless increase in power demand, power capacity, and
presumably, profits for power companies, was thrown into doubt, however,
when the Chinese artificial intelligence company DeepSeek released a
large language model that appears to require far less power than state
of the art models developed by American companies such as OpenAI. While
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/deepseek-ge-vernova-oklo-constellation" target="_self"><u>the
biggest stock market victim</u></a> has been the chip designer Nvidia,
which has shed hundreds of billions of dollars of market capitalization
this week, a number of power companies including Constellation and
Vistra are down around 10%, after being some of the best stock market
performers in 2024.

dealers selling handguns to adults under the age of 21 is
unconstitutional, a U.S. appeals court held on Thursday, citing recent
U.S. Supreme Court rulings expanding gun rights.</p>
<p>The ruling by the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
marked the first time a federal appeals court has held that the
prohibition violated the right to keep and bear arms enshrined in the
U.S. Constitution’s Second Amendment.</p>
<p>The appeals court had previously upheld that same ban in 2012. But
that was before the 6-3 conservative majority U.S. Supreme Court handed
down a landmark ruling in 2022 that established a new test for assessing
modern firearms laws.</p>
<p>In New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Association v. Bruen, the
Supreme Court held that modern gun restrictions were required to be
“consistent with this nation’s historical tradition of firearm
regulation.”</p>
<p>The federal ban on sales to people under 21 was first adopted by
Congress in 1968 as part of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets
Act.</p>
<p>A group of individuals between the ages of 18 and 20 along with the
gun rights groups the Firearms Policy Coalition and the Second Amendment
Foundation challenged the ban in 2020 and was appealing a lower-court
judge’s decision upholding the statutes.</p>
<p>U.S. Circuit Judge Edith Jones, writing for Thursday’s three-judge
panel, said that decision was wrong, as the statutes were
“unconstitutional in light of our Nation’s historic tradition of firearm
regulation.”</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Justice during Democratic former President Joe
Biden’s tenure had defended the ban. But Jones said it put forth “scant”
evidence to show that the gun rights of adults ages 18 to 20 were
similarly restricted during the nation’s founding era in the 1700s.</p>
<p>“Ultimately, the text of the Second Amendment includes
eighteen-to-twenty-year-old individuals among “the people” whose right
to keep and bear arms is protected,” wrote Jones, who like the other
panel members was appointed by a Republican president.</p>
<p>Brandon Combs, the Firearms Policy Coalition’s president, in a
statement called the ruling a victory against “an immoral and
unconstitutional age-based gun ban.”</p>
<p>The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

the Renewable Energy Industry Is Processing Trump 2.0</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-30, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NjEyMjMxMS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0OTEzNTMzN30.qGSzmhzKETUwUQtpiDvB-6iJJGK-gilI7OimaafzKO8/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=142%2C0%2C143%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
This week we’re talking to Carl Fleming, a renewables attorney with
McDermott Will &amp; Emory who was an advisor to Commerce Secretary Gina
Raimondo under the Biden administration. We chatted the morning after
the Trump administration attempted to freeze large swathes of federal
spending. My goal? To understand whether this chaos and uncertainty was
trickling down into the transition as we spoke. But Fleming had a sober
perspective and an important piece of wisdom: stay calm and remain on
course.
</p>
<p>
The following conversation has been lightly edited for clarity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>How are you seeing the private sector respond to all of this
news? </strong>
</p>
<p>
My view is, you can read a lot into what people publish in the EOs and
what’s written and what’s issued and you can sometimes read a good deal
into what hasn’t been issued and what hasn’t been said. In the executive
orders that got first issued in a flurry we saw a few that got pointed
directly at onshore wind, some on offshore wind, but solar and
standalone storage – as predicted – remained pretty much intact.
</p>
<p>
We were under the impression and we stood by it that we had the guidance
in hand, bankable guidance, from the IRS prior to the change in
administration and prior to any look-back window that people had been
transacting on over the past year at kind of a record pace. Standalone
storage has just had a breakout year. Solar continues to go, to continue
to be put on the grid. And we also have manufacturing of solar panels,
the domestic supply chain. This year we stood up is nowhere near what we
need to fulfill our requirements to get everything we need to do
domestically to fill our generation requirements [but] its a pretty
great step in the right direction. And those credits have been pretty
good to the economy and Republican states.
</p>
<p>
The way I’ve seen people react is, I’ve probably been busier than ever
the past two weeks, not only fielding questions like that but also for
tax credit transfers, all of the corporates we work with. We work in
both the buy and the sell side of all these credit transfers. We’re
working with a lot of solar module manufacturers to sell the credits
under the IRA. We’re working with a lot of buyers to purchase those
credits. And we’re working with the buyers and sellers under the
generation of these projects.
</p>
<p>
All of the buyers have come out and continued with their 2025 strategy
to buy more of these credits, if not more so. And all of the developers
we represent continue to produce more of these credits. So I haven’t
seen a hiccup or slowdown in actual transactions. If anything, I’ve seen
stuff pick up in the solar space and in the manufacturing space. I
continue to be very optimistic about those two fundamental parts of the
energy transition, because if you need to go be an energy superpower,
you wouldn’t want to turn off solar, turn off storage –
</p>
<p>
<strong>Is that argument that if you were trying to deal with “energy
security,” you wouldn’t turn off solar and storage – is that enough to
assuage uncertainty in the investor space? </strong>
</p>
<p>
I think it’s helpful. If you’re a private equity investor or you’re any
sort of lender or a developer, you’re probably not going to base your
whole model on the hopes that our energy security strategy syncs up with
what most people think it should look like. But when you layer it on top
of some of the fundamentals… I want to say that solar did not go away
eight years ago. When Trump first came in, we saw more renewables
deployed in his administration. At times, we saw more beneficial
guidance, issuance of tax guidance under that administration, than we
would hope for from some more favorable administrations.
</p>
<p>
The fact that the IRA has disproportionately benefited red states is
just a fact that can’t be overlooked. I met with a group of about two
dozen lawmakers a few weeks ago to talk about the IRA and there’s quite
a few of those folks in the room that say, <em><em>“Whatever we do, we
can’t dismantle the IRA.” </em></em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>But how has the chaos in the last week and a half impacted
investment in renewable energy, though? </strong>
</p>
<p>
I think the renewable energy industry is used to a lack of
predictability. It’s kind of a lawyer’s job, our team’s job, to help
folks mitigate risk [and] to see what potential pitfalls there may be
and to structure and draft around those.
</p>
<p>
You might see as things get more unpredictable, as folks go out to
investors to raise capital, you might see a little bit of tightening
around different portfolios or different types of companies based on
their pipelines or how they’re put together. But I think one investor’s
look on a project or pipeline may vary widely from another investor
who’s got a different project or pipeline. There’s a lot of capital out
there to be deployed. I think people are looking to invest.
</p>
<p>
I think you just need to partner the right developers with the right
investors.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Are you seeing any slowdown in solar investment though?
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I don’t see folks taking a hardline approach or stopping any time soon.
</p>
<p>
This is not an existential crisis while the ITC [investment tax credit]
and PTC [production tax credit] exist. It’s not even, could you go back
in time to unwind these credits. It’s moreso, going forward, what will
the IRA look like? Will there be additional technologies added to the
IRA? That’s possible to help stand up other technologies. Will the
runway for the credit, instead of it being unlimited for at least 10
years, will [it] be pared back a bit? There’s potential, but it’s
unlikely.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Okay last question and it’s a fun one: what was the last song
you listened to? </strong>
</p>
<p>
I’m not going to lie, I’m an Eagles fan. And I’m from Philly and a huge
Meek Mill fan. So “Uptown Vibes” by Meek Mill is in the car.

<strong>1. Freeze, don’t move – </strong>The Trump administration this
week attempted to freeze essentially all discretionary grant programs in
the federal government. A list
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-memo-climate-programs" target="_self">we
obtained</a> showed this would halt major energy programs and somehow
also involve targeting work on IRA tax credits.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Despite a court ruling that was supposed to lift the freeze, key climate
programs – like the EPA’s Solar For All effort – remain
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/epa-cuts-off-ira-solar-money-already-under-contract/" target="_blank">reportedly
on ice</a>.
</li>

Our guts here at Heatmap tell us there’ll be a lot more news to come on
this front. Stay tuned.

<strong>2. Sorry, California –</strong> The Bureau of Ocean Energy
Management canceled public meetings on the environmental impact
statement for offshore wind lease areas in California, indicating the
Trump wind lease pause will also affect pre-approval activities.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
BOEM claimed the meeting was only “postponed,” but did not provide a
date for rescheduling. “We will provide additional information as it
becomes available,” the agency stated in a notice

Gov. Brad Little this week signed an executive order dubbed
<a href="https://gov.idaho.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/eo-2025-02.pdf" target="_blank">the
SPEED Act</a> aimed at expediting all energy projects, including
potentially renewables, transmission, and mining projects.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The order creates an Idaho permitting council to “design, implement, and
facilitate” a new coordinated permitting process. The council will also
“identify sections of statute or administrative rule that are
duplicative, unnecessary, or unreasonably prolong the state’s permitting
process.”

<h2 id="deathwatch-for-atlantic-shores">Deathwatch for Atlantic
Shores?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-30, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NjEyMjI0Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4OTc2MDg3Nn0.n4CkIjWspIs7P2-u3oSBB7kdNzkOhY4XwfMp3y3MJzM/image.jpg?width=1200&height=886&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
<strong>1. Atlantic County, New Jersey – </strong>The Atlantic Shores
offshore wind project is on deathwatch.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Earlier today, Shell
<a href="https://www.workboat.com/wind/shell-withdraws-from-atlantic-shores-wind-project" target="_blank"><u>announced</u></a>
it would pull out of its 50-50 joint venture with EDF Renewables to
develop the Atlantic Shores offshore wind project off the coast of New
Jersey.<br/>
</li>
<li>
Atlantic Shores then sent us a statement unprompted, saying they’re
“committed” to developing New Jersey’s first offshore wind site.
</li>
<li>
“Business plans, projects, portfolio projections and scopes evolve over
time – and as expected for large, capital-intensive infrastructure
projects like ours, our shareholders have always prepared long-term
strategies that contemplate multiple scenarios that enable Atlantic
Shores to reach its full potential,” the statement read.
</li>
<li>
It continued: “While we can’t comment on the views of shareholders,
Atlantic Shores intends to continue progressing New Jersey’s first
offshore wind project and our portfolio in compliance with our
obligations to local, state and federal partners under existing leases
and relevant permits.”
</li>
<li>
As we previously
<a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/spotlight/trump-executive-order-wind" target="_self"><u>explained</u></a>,
we anticipate this project to face challenges to the legality of its
permits and leases, as
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/wind-executive-order-trump" target="_self"><u>previewed
by</u></a> the Trump administration.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>2. Waldo County, Maine –</strong> The Sears Island saga is
moving to the state legislature, as a cadre of lawmakers push to block
construction of a floating offshore wind turbine construction facility
there before Trump leaves office.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
As we previously explained, Sears Island – a bucolic recreation
destination off the coast of Maine – is the state’s favored spot for
building an assembly site for floating offshore wind turbines. Floating
offshore wind is preferred by some Maine politicians, including
Gov. Janet Mills, because it would reduce impacts to fisheries closer to
the shoreline.
</li>
<li>
Despite Trump’s edict blocking offshore wind, Maine has a pathway to
stay the course toward eventual development, because researchers have a
lease to test more floating offshore wind turbines in the Gulf of Maine.
There’s a world where development of a construction port on Sears Island
happens in tandem with that research.
</li>
<li>
However, we’re watching this risk to that pathway: a group of
Republicans in the state legislature – joined by a Democratic lawmaker
and a non-voting representative of the Passamaquoddy Tribe – have
<a href="https://legislature.maine.gov/backend/App/services/getDocument.aspx?documentId=108609" target="_blank"><u>introduced
a bill</u></a> to permanently turn Sears Island into a conservation
site, taking the island off the table for wind development.
</li>
<li>
Hindering offshore wind development overall might be the goal of the
bill, which was introduced the day after Trump restricted all new
offshore development Its lead author is state Rep. Reagan Paul, who has
also
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/15bH5GzbpX/" target="_blank"><u>called
on the governor</u></a> to stop all state spending on offshore wind.
Paul was in D.C. for Trump’s
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/r/15n8s96n6w/" target="_blank"><u>inauguration
celebrations</u></a>.
</li>
<li>
It’s unclear whether the legislation stands a chance at becoming law.
But it is clear some state Republicans are going to do what they can to
stop the Sears Island wind port, which will matter if the state tries to
get project permits under Trump.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>3. San Luis Obispo County, California – </strong>The Moss
Landing battery fire has sparked a new push for the state to slow
approvals for BESS development. Unlike Sears Island, the push is being
led by a Democratic lawmaker who has supported rapid climate action.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
State assemblywoman Dawn Addis – who represents Moss Landing and
communities impacted by the disaster – just introduced legislation that
would remove battery storage facilities from the California Energy
Commission’s opt-in certification program, effectively giving cities and
counties much more control over BESS siting.<br/>
</li>
<li>
“I absolutely have been a champion, believe that we live in a climate
crisis and have to have solutions,” Addis said at a press conference
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/v/15kAbifG2X/" target="_blank"><u>announcing
the bill</u></a>. “Along with those solutions, we have to have
safety.”<br/>
</li>
<li>
This bill would give locals more control because the opt-in program lets
companies ask the state to override concerns at the municipal level. It
would also likely stop a Vistra Energy battery project in Morro Bay,
where the company has been stonewalled and decided to go to
<a href="https://www.newtimesslo.com/news/vistra-is-seeking-state-approval-for-its-proposed-morro-bay-battery-plant-bypassing-the-city-15945103" target="_blank"><u>the
Commission instead</u></a>.<br/>
</li>
<li>
It’s too early to tell whether the bill stands a chance at becoming law,
but it’s clear the state is trying to reassure residents that BESS is
safe. Earlier this week state regulators proposed updating their
emergency response guidance for
<a href="https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/news-and-updates/all-news/cpuc-issues-proposal-to-enhance-safety-of-battery-energy-storage-facilities" target="_blank"><u>responding
to BESS fires</u></a>.<br/>
</li>
<li>
This is all despite the Moss Landing fire being
<a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-storage/moss-landing-fire-reveals-flaws-in-the-battery-industrys-early-designs" target="_blank"><u>tied
to very unique circumstances</u></a>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>4. Greene County, New York – </strong>A solar farm fight is
testing whether the state of New York’s climate law can be used to
override local opposition to renewables projects.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
A mid-level appellate judge
<a href="https://www.timesunion.com/capitol/article/ruling-citing-ny-climate-act-reverses-town-s-ban-20052286.php" target="_blank"><u>ruled
this week</u></a> that the state’s 2019 Climate Act provides a legal
basis for the state to conclude construction of some new solar and wind
projects are in the overall public interest.<br/>
</li>
<li>
The case surrounds a Freeport Solar project in the town of Athens, where
the local zoning board rejected the project claiming it was not a
“public necessity.” Athens has said they will now take the case to the
Court of Appeals, New York’s highest court.
</li>
</ul>

<p class="drop-caps">
Solar energy so far is avoiding the Trump-era challenge posed to wind
energy. But it’s unclear the good times will continue, as chaos reigns
in Washington and threats loom on the horizon.
</p>
<p>
Last week, Trump issued a
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/renewables-permitting-pause" target="_self"><u>60-day
pause</u></a> on all permits for solar projects on federal lands. Many
solar projects are not sited on federal lands, so there’s little Trump
could do in the short term to stop those projects. But some utility
scale projects definitely <em><em>are</em></em> on federal lands in the
Southwest, most often in Nevada, where
<a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/spotlight/nevada-joe-lombardo-blm-solar" target="_self"><u>considerable
opposition exists</u></a> in rural, untouched pockets of the state.
Several sit in various stages of the permitting process. In fact, there
are over 12 gigawatts worth of challenged projects currently planned for
the state, according to Heatmap Pro’s database.
</p>

</p>
<p>
Developers and industry representatives I spoke with believe Trump will
lift this pause on permits and let the solar projects flow through the
pipeline. EDF Renewables, whose Bonanza solar farm was approaching the
end of the permitting process when Trump came into office, told me they
“have no reason to believe that the project should not be approved.”
Balanced Rock Power, the developer of the Samantha solar project in
Nevada which is in the early stages of permitting, told me the company
is “continuing to work closely with” agencies “to complete all the major
milestones on schedule.”
</p>
<p>
“President Trump has specifically said that he loves solar – and as
energy demand soars, we know that solar is the most efficient and
affordable way to add a lot of energy to the grid, fast,” Abigail Ross
Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association,
told me in a statement.
</p>
<p>
But there’s a quiet unease amongst some in the sector about whether
recent actions around permits and federal funding mean the next shoe to
drop is going to hit them.
</p>
<p>
Trump’s got complaints about solar and land use, including those he made
in that presidential debate immediately after the “big fan” comment.
There was also an interview with Fox News last week where he came out
against utility-scale solar projects. “You know what else people don’t
like,” Trump told
<a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/news/trump-pushes-for-more-oil-and-gas-says-u-s-can-supply-the-whole-world-with-energy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>host
Sean Hannity</u></a>. “Those massive solar fields built over land that
covers 10 miles by 10 miles. I mean, they’re ridiculous, the whole
thing.”
</p>
<p>
Brendan Bell, a top executive at asset manager Aligned Capital and a
former senior official in DOE’s loan programs office, told me the
biggest question in solar right now is “whether they can do anything to
stop it.”
</p>
<p>
“If you’re developing a project on BLM land, you’re probably putting
that on the backburner,” said Brendan Bell, a top executive at asset
manager Aligned Capital. Bell served as director of strategic
initiatives for the Energy Department’s Loan Programs Office under the
Obama administration. “But that’s not the only place we build solar
projects.”
</p>
<p>
Indeed, from a permitting perspective, it may prove quite tricky to
undermine solar projects. Even on BLM land. That’s because permitting
decisions and even indecision can be litigated. Rarely does the Bureau
of Land Management actually deny projects – of any fuel type – so a step
change against solar would require a wholescale change to how permitting
staff ordinarily operate.
</p>
<p>
The most serious threat, in my view, is actually whether the Trump
administration will take on the “protect farmland” mantle that activists
in some states have used to derail large-scale solar projects. Under the
Farmlands Protection Policy Act, the Agriculture Department is tasked
with minimizing how federal programs impact the conversion of farmland
to non-agricultural uses, attorney Bob Greenslade told me in an email.
Farmland impacts “may be relevant” now to renewable energy development
in any area with a federal nexus, including land use.
</p>
<p>
And there’s a nascent effort to strip tax credits from renewables
projects sited on farmland. On Tuesday, Republican congressman Tom
Tiffany of Wisconsin
<a href="https://www.hudsonstarobserver.com/news/rep-tom-tiffany-hosts-listening-session-on-xcel-energy-s-prospective-solar-farm/article_fd74445e-ddcb-11ef-9443-03a4ca9a882d.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>announced</u></a>
he would reintroduce legislation to disqualify renewables projects from
receiving tax benefits under the Inflation Reduction Act if their
project is on “prime farmland,” a term of art defined by the Agriculture
Department.
</p>
<p>
Mark Fowler, director of government affairs for Ameresco, told me that
he believes tax credits and access to federal funds will be a bigger
issue for solar than permitting in the immediate term, especially in
light of the (now lifted) Trump freeze on discretionary funds. Ameresco
is an integrator and developer of renewable energy projects. “The
biggest thing right now is uncertainty around the tax credits. The
discussion right now is they’re going to change in some form the IRA tax
credits. We don’t know what the changes are going to look like.”

<p class="drop-caps">
Since his re-election, President Trump has repeatedly threatened to
impose big tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico.
</p>
<p>
And in recent days, he’s made it clear: Yes, he really means <em><em>all
</em></em>imports.
</p>
<p>
“We don’t need them to make our cars, we make a lot of them. We don’t
need their lumber because we have our own forests,” he
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y725r90k5o" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>told</u></a>
Davos attendees last week. “We don’t need their oil and gas, we have
more than anybody.”
</p>
<p>
The president is mistaken about the American fossil fuel industry — at
least in its current structure. Even though the United States is the
world’s No. 1 producer of oil and natural gas, the industry really
does<em> </em>depend on oil imported from its neighbors, especially
Canada. If Trump makes good on his threats to tariff oil imports from
Canada and Mexico, then he will cost the American oil and gas industry
tens of billions of dollars while causing gasoline prices to rise across
much of the country.
</p>
<p>
That’s because not all petroleum is created equal. The type of crude
that oozes out of wells in Alberta and Saskatchewan is not identical to
what’s extracted by frackers in Texas and Oklahoma. But the types of
petroleum now produced in Canada and in America pair especially well
together — meaning that if the price of Canadian oil goes up, then
American refineries, as well as American consumers, will pay the price.
</p>
<p>
That could hurt the president’s ability to fulfill one of his core
promises. In his inaugural address, Trump promised to “rapidly bring
down costs and prices” in part by fighting “escalating energy costs.”
Levying tariffs on Canadian oil imports would likely raise energy
prices.
</p>
<p>
But it could have more complicated environmental effects. Western
Canadian petroleum has a higher carbon intensity than other crude oils,
and American climate activists fought last decade to keep it from
entering the United States. Trump, counterintuitively, could succeed
more thoroughly than they did.
</p>
<p>
To understand why, you have to know a little bit of chemistry — and a
bit of history, too.
</p>
<h3>
A brief digression
</h3>
<p>
We often talk about oil as an homogenous and fungible commodity, but
that’s not really true. In reality, oil and natural gas usually come out
of the ground as a slurry of hydrocarbons.
</p>
<p>
A hydrocarbon is a chain of hydrogen and carbon atoms bonded together.
Sometimes those chains are relatively short — as in methane, the major
component of natural gas — and sometimes they’re longer — as in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octane" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>octane</u></a>,
a liquid and a major component of gasoline. As the number of carbon
atoms keeps growing, the substance starts to get
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraffin_wax" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>waxier</u></a>
until the chains get
<a href="https://personal.ems.psu.edu/~radovic/coal_structure.gif" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>absolutely</u></a>
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-44045-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>enormous</u></a>
and become the kind of molecule you find in coal. Nitrogen, oxygen, and
sulfur atoms are sometimes jammed into the hydrocarbon chains too.
</p>
<p>
In other words, all fossil fuels exist on a spectrum — and crude oil, a
melange of hydrocarbons of different lengths and properties, occupies
the messy middle. Those properties can vary based on how and why in the
past a crude field formed. Petroleum engineers classify it along two
axes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Its <em><em>weight. </em></em>When oil has more short-chain
hydrocarbons, it flows more easily, and petroleum engineers talk about
it as being “light.” When oil has more long-chain hydrocarbons and is
more viscous, they say that it’s “heavy.”
</li>
<li>
Its <em><em>sulfur content. </em></em>Some hydrocarbon chains contain
sulfur atoms mixed in with the hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen. But sulfur
is generally a bad thing in oil: It produces toxic and corrosive
byproducts when refined, and burning sulfur-heavy fuels can lead to acid
rain. Engineers say that sulfur-rich crude is “sour,” while sulfur-light
crude is “sweet.”
</li>
</ul>
<p>
American fracking wells tend to produce light, sweet crude. The oil from
Alberta is heavy and sour.
</p>
<p>
Normally, heavy and sour oil trades at a discount compared to light and
sweet oil. That’s because the highest volume products that come out of a
refinery — gasoline or jet fuel, for instance — are made of short
hydrocarbons, not long ones. Light, sweet crudes are closer to the
finished product, and thus require less refining.
</p>
<p>
Yet heavy, sour crudes are crucial to the U.S. oil industry anyway.
American refiners use heavy crudes to bring down their input costs for
refined products such as gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel.
</p>
<p>
Why? That’s where the history comes in.
</p>
<h3>
North America is an integrated energy system
</h3>
<p>
Nearly two decades ago, as oil prices reached painful highs as global
demand outstripped supply, many refineries across the United States
began to invest in technologies that would let them break down heavier,
sour petroleum into something more commercially viable. They built
coking refineries, expensive pieces of equipment that use extreme heat
to break down long hydrocarbon chains into shorter ones. The cost of
such a refinery can
<a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-86884-0_3#:~:text=The%20investment%20cost%20of%20a,cost%20more%20than%20%246%20billion." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>exceed
$10 billion</u></a>. Many were purpose-built for breaking down the
sludgy, sour oil coming from Canada.
</p>
<p>
In the early 2010s, as the fracking revolution turned the United States
into an oil-drilling superpower, those coking refineries remained
important. They helped stretch the value out of the light, tight crude
coming out of fracking wells, Rory Johnston, an oil markets analyst and
the author of the Commodity Context newsletter, told me last week.
</p>
<p>
It does not make sense to use the coking refineries on oil from fracking
wells, because that oil is already largely composed of short-chain
hydrocarbons. But by breaking down Canadian oil in coking refineries,
and blending it with American oil, the industry can make a wider blend
of producers at a lower cost.
</p>
<p>
“Heavy crude’s cheaper, and they want to refine this into valuable end
products,” Johnston said in a separate conversation recorded this week
on Heatmap’s Shift Key podcast. “And so because of this, to just run
light crude through that, you would instantly render economically
worthless all of this very, very expensive equipment.”
</p>
<p>
Many of America’s refineries — especially those in the Midwest — are now
tuned specifically to process light fracking oil and heavy Canadian
sludge together, he said. What this means in practice is that the United
States exports as a finished product much of the crude oil that it
imports from Canada. Under the current situation, the U.S. earns more
money selling refined products <em><em>made </em></em>from Canadian
crude than it spends importing raw petroleum from Canada, Johnston
added.
</p>
<p>
Tariffs will collapse the price relationships that allow for that
mutually beneficial situation to persist. It will boost the cost of
Canadian oil by at least $5 a barrel on each side of the border, raising
pump prices by about 13 cents in the Midwest, Johnston told me.
</p>
<p>
That may not sound so bad for consumers. But it would be terrible for
refiners. “The total effect of Trump’s actions so far is to nuke the
economics of U.S. coking refineries. It’s truly magnificent,” he said.
“You couldn’t create a better scenario to destroy the economics of U.S.
coking refineries.”
</p>
<p>
If U.S. oil companies lose access to cheap Canadian oil, they will
struggle to replace it. That’s because the next best place to get heavy,
sour crude is
<a href="https://www.pmi.com.mx/Public/Paginas/Tipoproducto_En.aspx?IdSec=27&IdPag=128" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Mexico</u></a>
— and Mexican imports, too, would likely face 25% tariffs under most
scenarios where Canada is levied. The next places to get heavy, sour
crude are Venezuela (where the Trump administration wants to tighten
sanctions) and Colombia (where Trump nearly imposed tariffs last
weekend).
</p>
<p>
One reason Canadian oil is so cheap in the United States is that
companies have invested billions integrating the two countries’ oil
infrastructure. A network of pipelines and storage tanks bring millions
of barrels of oil from Canada down to the U.S. Gulf Coast every day. The
countries — and especially their fossil fuel industries — are
interdependent.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, only one pipeline system —
<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/bakx-tmx-pipeline-oil-wcs-1.6780054" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
Trans Mountain pipeline</u></a> — connects Alberta’s oil fields to the
Pacific coast.
</p>
<p>
If you begin to play out how each country might react to a tariff,
Johnston said, “you get into these completely absurd scenario
discussions,” Johnston said. “The result is everyone would be poorer in
that scenario.”
</p>
<p>
None other than the U.S. oil industry itself has opposed the tariffs.
</p>
<p>
“We import a lot of oil from both Mexico and Canada, and we refine it
here in the most sophisticated refinery system in the world,” Mike
Sommers, the CEO of the American Petroleum Institute,
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/api-seeks-to-shield-oil-from-trumps-tariffs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said</u></a>
at an event in Washington last week. “We’re going to continue to work
with the Trump administration on this so that they understand how
important it is that we continue these trade relationships.”
</p>
<p>
On Monday, <em><em>The Wall Street Journal </em></em>reported that some
Trump aides
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/americas/trump-aides-want-to-hit-mexico-canada-with-tariffs-before-talks-3ff27f14" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>are
eager to hit</u></a> Canada and Mexico with tariffs this weekend, even
though the president has yet to reopen talks — or even describe his
demands — for a reworked U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement.
Canadian and Mexican officials have said that they are not sure what
Trump actually wants in the talks.
</p>
<p>
One irony of this fracas is that the tariffs would have a more uncertain
environmental effect. Western Canadian crude is
<a href="https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/sites/default/files/classic/fuels/lcfs/crude-oil/2019_crude_average_ci_value_final.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>unusually
carbon-intensive</u></a> to extract and refine. If its price rose — or
if Canadian officials responded to tariffs in part by shutting down
production — then Trump could accidentally, if marginally, decrease
carbon emissions. American refineries might also respond to tariffs by
importing heavy, sour crude oil from abroad, essentially just shifting
production around the planet.
</p>
<p>
Still, it remains ridiculous that Trump, who has spent his first days in
the White House attacking a “Green New Deal” agenda that never actually
passed Congress, might succeed in raising the cost of oil consumption
and production in the U.S. where a decade of climate activism has
largely failed.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps that’s why many still doubt it would happen. On Wednesday
morning, President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/29/us/politics/mexico-president-sheinbaum-trump-tariffs.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said</u></a>
that she did not think Trump would ultimately impose sanctions on her
country. And even within the oil industry, tariffs on Canadian oil seem
unthinkable. A 25% tariff would whack the industry hardest, even though
it
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/business/energy-environment/oil-trump-drill-baby-drill.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has
allied itself</u></a> closely with Trump. Trump’s likely energy
secretary, Chris Wright, is the CEO of Liberty Energy, an oilfield
services company.
</p>
<p>
“A lot of the people I’m hearing on the Canadian side are saying, ‘Maybe
we should try to speak with these people around Trump. Maybe Wright or
[Trump’s energy czar Doug] Burgum understand what’s happening,’”
Johnston said.
</p>
<p>
But Trump has already made demands that strike the North American oil
industry as bizarre. At the same Davos meeting where he said the United
States didn’t need Canadian oil, Trump
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c17ewl98kgvo" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>demanded</u></a>
that OPEC and Saudi Arabia cut global oil prices so that global interest
rates could fall. Such a move would cut profits in the American oil
industry while hampering Trump’s goal of increasing U.S. oil production.
</p>
<p>
The irony that a Republican president would push off Canadian crude to
increase America’s reliance on OPEC is hard to comprehend, Johnston
said.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know that anyone has a great sense of where Trump’s true
philosophical anchor is,” he said, “other than that we are now getting a
clear picture that he views any and all trade deficits as a sin unto
themselves.”

disappointing Q4 results for 2024 yesterday, with revenue and earnings
per share both missing analysts expectations. Revenue came in at $25.71
billion, down 8% compared to the same period in 2023. Earnings per share
were $0.73, compared to projections of $0.77. Gross profit margin fell
to 13.6% year-over-year, less than the 16.2% forecast. Tesla’s stock
dipped on the news, but rebounded after CEO Elon Musk tried to make some
reassurances during the earnings call. He said Tesla planned to launch a
driverless ride-hailing service in Austin, Texas, in June, and expects
to begin producing the Cybercab robotaxi fleet in 2026. He talked up the
Optimus humanoid robot and the company’s AI and robotics investments.
And he said the company plans to start producing “more affordable
models” of its EVs in the first half of 2025. (Worth noting that the

decade, he didn’t show it, predicting that the next few years will be
“epic” for the company. “I see a path for Tesla being the most valuable
company in the world, by far, not even close,” he said. “There is a path
where Tesla is worth more than the next top five companies combined.”

“Tesla investors are fuelled by optimism around Full Self-Driving and
the upcoming affordable model, two key catalysts that could drive
Tesla’s next leg of growth,” said Hargreaves Lansdown’s Matt Britzman.
Others were less optimistic. “While the long-term narrative remains, the

Have No Patience for Bureaucracy’: an Exit Interview With DOE’s Vanessa
Chan</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-30, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NjEwNjIxNC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTgwMDkzNDAzMX0.7dI20iuaWrDTgKABmlPgJgS917SjKacYPjcP2QF3iTk/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Vanessa Chan didn’t think she had the right temperament to work in
government. After a 13-year stint as a partner at McKinsey, six years as
a partner at the angel investment firm Robin Hood Ventures, and four
years at the University of Pennsylvania, most recently as professor of
practice in innovation and entrepreneurship, Chan considered herself to
be an impatient, get-it-done type — anathema to the traditionally slow,
procedurally complex work of governing.
</p>
<p>
But the
<a href="https://www.energy.senate.gov/services/files/32B4E9F4-F13A-44F6-A0CA-E10B3392D47A" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Energy
Act of 2020</u></a> had just formalized a new role within the Department
of Energy ideally suited to her skills: Chief Commercialization Officer,
which would also serve as the director of the Office of Technology
Transitions. Who would fill these dual roles was to be the decision of
then-incoming Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm, who found a kindred
spirit in Chan. Under her leadership, Chan told me, “I found someone
who’s less patient than me.”
</p>
<p>
In her four years at the DOE, the OTT’s annual budget — which she
referred to as “literally a rounding error to most people” — grew from
$12.6 million to $56.6 million. She leveraged it to its fullest extent,
establishing a precedent for the potential of this small but mighty
office. Chan spearheaded the
“<a href="https://liftoff.energy.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Pathways
to Commercial Liftoff</u></a>” reports that provide investors with a
path to market for the most important decarbonization technologies, and
announced over
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/technologytransitions/articles/doe-announces-over-41m-funding-deliver-clean-energy-solutions-market" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$41
million in funding</u></a> for 50 clean energy projects across all of
the nations 17 national labs through the
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/technologytransitions/technology-commercialization-fund" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Technology
Commercialization Fund</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
She also changed the way the DOE, national labs, venture capitalists,
and startups alike talk about getting ready for primetime with the
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/technologytransitions/adoption-readiness-levels-arl-framework" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Adoption
Readiness Level framework</u></a>, which put a much-needed focus on
factors such as economic viability, regulatory hurdles, and supply chain
constraints in the same way that the established
<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/somd/space-communications-navigation-program/technology-readiness-levels/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Technology
Readiness Levels</u></a>, pioneered by NASA, focus on the question of
whether a technology actually works.
</p>
<p>
Now Chan is back at the University of Pennsylvania in a new, extremely
apt role: the Inaugural Vice-Dean of Innovation and Entrepreneurship.
She’s weaving lessons learned from her time in the public and private
sectors into academia, where her goal is to help incorporate real-world
skills into the education of engineers and PhD scholars to prime them
for maximum impact upon graduation.
</p>
<p>
“It’s such a disservice if you invent something and it never sees the
light of day,” she told me. “So we need to make sure that isn’t
happening and we increase our odds of things making it to the market.”
</p>
<p>
Over two separate interviews, one before President Trump’s inauguration
and one after, I asked Chan how her work with the DOE has helped climate
technologies move from the lab to the market, the challenges that
remain, and what to keep an eye on in the new administration. Our
conversation has been edited for length and clarity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>How did you get recruited for this job? Was government work even
on your radar before?</strong>
</p>
<p>
No, this was never on my vision board. But the way in which this came
about was in 2016, there was a workshop that was being led by DOE on a
potential new foundation that was going to be focused on
commercialization. And one of my former clients told the person running
the workshop, <em><em>if you’re talking about technology
commercialization, you have to talk to Vanessa Chan</em></em>. And when
I was there, I just yapped off about all the issues that I see with
commercialization and what the federal government should be doing about
it. And I didn’t think anything of it.
</p>
<p>
And then fast forward to 2020, I get this cryptic email saying, “Hey,
the Biden-Harris administration is interested in you.” I spent all the
time during the interview [with the Biden-Harris team] going, “Here’s my
thing about commercialization, but I don’t think you guys want me,
because I’m someone who works really fast. I have no patience for
bureaucracy. I like to disrupt. I don’t like the status quo.” And
they’re like, that’s exactly what we want.
</p>
<p>
<strong>How did the DOE, and the OTT in particular, really undergo a
shift in the Biden administration?</strong>
</p>
<p>
Historically, DOE has been very focused on research and development. And
then when the [Bipartisan Infrastructure Law] and [Inflation Reduction
Act] got passed, now there was half-a-trillion dollars going towards
demonstration and deployment, and it became a lot more fun being the
chief commercialization officer.
</p>
<p>
The mantra that we’ve had is that the clean energy transition — and
quite frankly, commercialization — has to be private sector-led but
government-enabled. Because in the end, it’s the private sector that’s
actually commercializing. It’s not the government. DOD can buy stuff to
bring things to market, but DOE, we’re an enabler. And unless the
private sector has sustainable, viable economic models, nothing will
ever be commercialized.
</p>
<p>
<strong>How does your work intersect with other DOE agencies that are
focused on commercialization, like the Office of Clean Energy
Demonstrations and the Loan Programs Office?</strong>
</p>
<p>
I worked very closely with all of them. In particular, one of the things
that was really important to do was to get us on the same page of what
it actually means to deploy technologies. So I quarterbacked an effort
called
<a href="https://liftoff.energy.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
Pathways to Commercial Liftoff</u></a>, which OCED, LPO, and any program
office that was touching research, development, demonstration, and
deployment was a part of.
</p>
<p>
If we use hydrogen hubs as an example, OCED was given $8 billion towards
hydrogen. When we did the
<a href="https://liftoff.energy.gov/clean-hydrogen/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>hydrogen
liftoff report</u></a>, what we found was a few things. One is that
electrolyzer costs are super high, and so we have to be able to drive
those downward to make the unit economics work. We have an issue where
there is no midstream infrastructure. We also had a chicken-and-the egg,
which is pretty classic: No one wants to buy hydrogen until the supply
chain is stood up, [but] the supply chain doesn’t want to stand up until
they know they actually have offtake agreements.
</p>
<p>
What we did with OCED was, we took $7 billion to invest in
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/oced/regional-clean-hydrogen-hubs-0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>seven
hydrogen hubs</u></a> across the nation, and then we reserved $1 billion
to create an
<a href="https://h2di.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>offtake
demand mechanism</u></a>. And that’s the first time ever that the
federal government has actually focused on a demand activation program.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Have these liftoff reports been well received on both sides of
the aisle? Do you think they’ll continue to be referenced in the new
administration? </strong>
</p>
<p>
We were very, very, very fact-driven. There’s no policy by design,
because in the end it’s all about, what does it take for a technology to
make sense, for it to be in the market? So it’s not Republican or
Democratic, it’s just — what does the private sector have to do? I’m
really hoping they’re not seen as partisan and really more a synthesis
of what’s required for the private sector to actually scale technology.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What are some additional successes from your time at the
DOE?</strong>
</p>
<p>
An example program is
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/technologytransitions/articles/doe-awards-over-11-million-through-make-it-prize-boost-domestic" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>MAKE
IT</u></a>, which is Manufacturing of Advanced Key Energy Infrastructure
Technologies, which was a program that we created with OCED in order to
figure out ways in which we could try to help bolster manufacturing
across the nation. We also have this program called
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/technologytransitions/energy-program-innovation-clusters" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>EPIC</u></a>,
the Energy Program for Innovation Clusters, and we have funded over 80
incubators and accelerators across the nation, which are supporting
startups.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/technologytransitions/voucher-program" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>We’ve
created a voucher program</u></a> for startups and smaller organizations
— sometimes there’s very tactical things that they need help on, and
they need a small dollar amount, like a couple-hundred-thousand-dollars
to tackle that. We’re like, <em><em>Oh, you need to do techno-economic
analysis? We’re going to pair you with this organization here that can
do it</em></em>, and you don’t have to negotiate anything with them.
We’re just going to send them the money, you’re given a voucher, and you
just call them.
</p>
<p>
<strong>When I talk with venture capitalists, something that often comes
up is the difficulty of getting startups through the
</strong><a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/missing-middle" target="_self"><u><strong>so-called
Valley of Death</strong></u></a><strong>, the funding gap between a
company’s initial rounds and its commercial scale-up. How do you think
about the public sector’s role in helping companies through this
stage?</strong>
</p>
<p>
First of all, this private sector-led, government-enabled idea around
commercialization is really important. And the work we’ve done with
Liftoff and how we’ve gotten money out the door has really worked,
because for every dollar going out the door from DOE, we’ve seen $6
matching from the private sector. That in itself is showing that there’s
a way for the public sector to nudge the private sector to act.
</p>
<p>
What I’ll tell you, though, is that I think there needs to be a
wholesale reframe around how the private sector thinks about investments
and the returns that they want on them. Right now, we are in the Squid
Games, where everyone is first in line to be sixth or seventh, no one is
first in line to be first, second, or third, because they know the
person who is first, second, or third is going to lose money. So what we
need to do is figure out, how do we have the ecosystem crowdsource the
first 10 of a kind, so that we get to the tipping point where the unit
economics are working? How do we get the private sector to promise to
buy technologies when they’re not quite there? How do we in the public
sector help on the back end?
</p>
<p>
<strong>What are other primary barriers to commercialization that you
see?</strong>
</p>
<p>
Another big barrier is that the time clock for moving up the learning
curve and moving down the cost curve is quite long in some of these
hard-tech technologies. And so the challenge is, how do we convince CEOs
to make investments in something which is not going to benefit
<em><em>them</em></em>, but benefit a CEO two or three down the line?
Humans just don’t work that way, right? They’re all about earnings per
share and quarterly earning reports and so forth.
</p>
<p>
Now the challenge is, if we don’t do it, then countries like China are
going to do it. This is what happened in solar: We invented the
technology, but China was willing to take a loss in order to get up the
learning curve and drive down the cost curve, and we need to figure out
how to do the same.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Have you been in touch with anyone from the Trump
administration? Do you know who your successor will be? </strong>
</p>
<p>
No idea. My team didn’t even know who I was until day one. But what I’ll
tell you is that OTT has really strong bipartisan support because we’re
commercializing technologies, which is creating jobs, and I think
everyone understands the importance of this. Also for the [Foundation
for Energy Security and Innovation] I was very deliberate with the other
<em><em>ex officio</em></em> board members to make sure we had a
bipartisan board. We have 13 board members that we appointed here at
DOE, and I have representation from every single administration since
George H.W. Bush, including two Trump appointees.
</p>
<p>
I really do hope that whoever sits in my seat will reach out, and I left
a letter offering that, too. Hopefully they do give me a call because I
really want to wish them every success in the work that they’re doing.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What’s it like to be back at the University of Pennsylvania,
watching this new administration from a civilian perspective?</strong>
</p>
<p>
This was the best job ever, so I’m just sad in general to not be at the
Department of Energy because I really enjoyed the work that we were
doing there. A lot of the money from the BIL and IRA were used to
catalyze many, many red states. I am hopeful that people in power
recognize this and are going to do right by those counties. Because I
think, in the end, what we’re trying to do is really help with American
jobs and competitiveness.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Any thoughts on
</strong><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><strong>the
executive order</strong></u></a><strong> that’s frozen disbursement of
funds from BIL and IRA? </strong>
</p>
<p>
I don’t know, because I always think it’s not right to be on the outside
in, trying to figure out what different executive orders are trying to
say or not say. We all have to wait to see how these get executed upon.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What do you think people should be keeping an eye on to gauge
the impacts that these sweeping executive orders are having? </strong>
</p>
<p>
In my mind it’s really, is the private sector spooked? Are they going to
continue to invest the money that’s needed for these manufacturing
plants to continue and so forth? Because in the end, it’s the private
sector that actually is driving American competitiveness — the federal
government is a catalyst. And so I think what I’d be looking to is the
private sector. Are they stopping the momentum that we helped to
kickstart?

rights chief seeks $500 million in 2025, warning that lives are at
risk</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>GENEVA — The U.N. human rights chief appealed on Thursday for $500
million in funding for 2025 to support its work, such as investigating
human rights abuses around the world from Syria to Sudan, warning that
lives hang in the balance.</p>
<p>The U.N. human rights office has been grappling with chronic funding
shortages that some worry could be exacerbated by cuts to U.S. foreign
aid by President Donald Trump. The annual appeal is for funds beyond the
allocated U.N. funds from member states’ fees, which make up just a
fraction of the office’s needs.</p>
<p>“In 2025, we expect no let-up in major challenges to human rights,”
High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk told member states in a
speech at the U.N. in Geneva.</p>
<p>“I am very concerned that if we do not reach our funding targets in
2025, we will leave people … to struggle and possibly fail, without
adequate support,” he said.</p>
<p>He said any shortfall would mean more people remain in illegal
detention; that governments are allowed to continue with discriminatory
policies; violations may go undocumented; and human rights defenders
could lose protection.</p>
<p>“In short, lives are at stake,” Turk said.</p>
<p>The human rights office gets about 5% of the regular U.N. budget, but
the majority of its funding comes voluntarily in response to its annual
appeal announced on Thursday.</p>
<p>Western states give the most, with the United States donating $35
million last year or about 15% of the total received in 2024, followed
by the European Commission, U.N. data showed. Still, the office received
only about half of the $500 million it sought last year.</p>

panel to question director of national intelligence nominee Gabbard</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee is set to question former
Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard as she seeks confirmation to become the
nation’s director of national intelligence.</p>
<p>Gabbard is expected to face questions about her 2017 visit to Syria,
when during her time in Congress she met with then-President Bashar
al-Assad.</p>
<p>At the time she faced criticism for what opponents of the trip said
was legitimizing Assad amid the Syrian civil war.</p>
<p>The military veteran, who ran for the Democratic Party nomination in
the 2020 presidential election, was a critic of the Biden
administration’s support for Ukraine, including questioning sending aid
for Ukrainian troops instead of using resources for domestic issues.</p>
<p>“This war and suffering could have easily been avoided if Biden
Admin/NATO had simply acknowledged Russia’s legitimate security
concerns,” Gabbard said as Russia began its invasion of Ukraine in
2022.</p>
<p>In announcing her nomination, U.S. President Donald Trump said
Gabbard would “bring the fearless spirit that has defined her
illustrious career to our Intelligence Community, championing our
Constitutional Rights, and security Peace through Strength.”</p>
<p>If approved by a simple majority in the Senate, Gabbard would oversee
18 U.S. intelligence agencies.</p>
<p>Trump’s Republican Party holds a 53-47 Senate majority.</p>

Meta CEOs defend hefty AI spending after DeepSeek stuns tech world</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Days after Chinese upstart DeepSeek revealed a breakthrough in cheap
AI computing that shook the U.S. technology industry, the chief
executives of Microsoft and Meta defended massive spending that they
said was key to staying competitive in the new field.</p>
<p>DeepSeek’s quick progress has stirred doubts about the lead America
has in AI with models that it claims can match or even outperform
Western rivals at a fraction of the cost, but the U.S. executives said
on Wednesday that building huge computer networks was necessary to serve
growing corporate needs.</p>
<p>“Investing ‘very heavily’ in capital expenditure and infrastructure
is going to be a strategic advantage over time,” Meta CEO Mark
Zuckerberg said on a post-earnings call.</p>
<p>Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, said the spending was needed to
overcome the capacity constraints that have hampered the technology
giant’s ability to capitalize on AI.</p>
<p>“As AI becomes more efficient and accessible, we will see
exponentially more demand,” he said on a call with analysts.</p>
<p>Microsoft has earmarked $80 billion for AI in its current fiscal
year, while Meta has pledged as much as $65 billion towards the
technology.</p>
<p>That is a far cry from the roughly $6 million DeepSeek said it has
spent to develop its AI model. U.S. tech executives and Wall Street
analysts say that reflects the amount spent on computing power, rather
than all development costs.</p>
<p>Still, some investors seem to be losing patience with the hefty
spending and lack of big payoffs.</p>
<p>Shares of Microsoft — widely seen as a front runner in the AI race
because of its tie to industry leader OpenAI - were down 5% in extended
trading after the company said that growth in its Azure cloud business
in the current quarter would fall short of estimates.</p>
<p>“We really want to start to see a clear road map to what that
monetization model looks like for all of the capital that’s been
invested,” said Brian Mulberry, portfolio manager at Zacks Investment
Management, which holds shares in Microsoft.</p>
<p>Meta, meanwhile, sent mixed signals about how its bets on AI-powered
tools were paying off, with a strong fourth quarter but a lackluster
sales forecast for the current period.</p>
<p>“With these huge expenses, they need to turn the spigot on in terms
of revenue generated, but I think this week was a wake-up call for the
U.S.” said Futurum Group analyst Daniel Newman.</p>
<p>“For AI right now, there’s too much capital expenditure, not enough
consumption.”</p>
<p>There are some signs though that executives are moving to change
that.</p>
<p>Microsoft CFO Amy Hood said the company’s capital spending in the
current quarter and the next would remain around the $22.6 billion level
seen in the second quarter.</p>
<p>“In fiscal 2026, we expect to continue to invest against strong
demand signals. However, the growth rate will be lower than fiscal 2025
(which ends in June),” she said.</p>

id="state-department-says-trump-froze-foreign-aid-to-root-out-waste">State
Department says Trump froze foreign aid to ‘root out waste’</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The State Department on Wednesday sought to clarify
President Donald Trump’s order to freeze and review foreign development
aid after the top U.S. diplomat blunted some of the chaos that ensued
with an emergency order that could shield the world’s largest HIV
program from the 90-day funding freeze.   </p>
<p>At the White House, Trump said his pauses to foreign and domestic
funding are part of his administration’s effort to root out “tremendous
waste and fraud and abuse.” </p>
<p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s late-Tuesday waiver exempts
humanitarian aid, which he classifies as “life-saving medicine, medical
services, food, shelter, and subsistence assistance, as well as supplies
and reasonable administrative costs as necessary to deliver such
assistance.”  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The United Nations’ AIDS program welcomed the news, emphasizing the
value of the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR,
which serves 20 million people in 55 countries.  </p>
<p>“UNAIDS welcomes this waiver from the U.S. government, which ensures
that millions of people living with HIV can continue to receive
life-saving HIV medication during the assessment of U.S. foreign
development assistance,” said Executive Director Winnie Byanyima. “This
urgent decision recognizes PEPFAR’s critical role in the AIDS response
and restores hope to people living with HIV.” </p>
<p>‘Blocking woke programs’</p>
<p>In a Wednesday memo sent to journalists, the State Department
explained its rationale for the freeze during the review and lauded
early cost cuts, saying that “even at this early stage, over
$1,000,000,000 in spending not aligned with an America First agenda has
been prevented.”  </p>
<p>The U.S. spent about $70 billion in foreign aid in fiscal year 2023,
the most recent data available. </p>
<p>“We are rooting out waste,” the memo said. “We are blocking woke
programs. And we are exposing activities that run contrary to our
national interests. None of this would be possible if these programs
remained on autopilot.”  </p>
<p>The president, who said Wednesday at the White House that he “could
stand here all day” and give examples of wasted fraud and abuse in the
U.S. government, highlighted a few. </p>
<p>“We identified and stopped $50 million being sent to Gaza to buy
condoms for Hamas,” he said. “Fifty million. And you know what’s
happened to them? They’ve used them as a method of making bombs. How
about that?”   </p>
<p>The State Department echoed this, saying in a statement, “Without the
pause, U.S. taxpayers would have provided condoms [and other
contraceptive services] in Gaza, climate justice marketing services in
Gabon, clean energy programs for women in Fiji, gender development
programs in D.C., family planning throughout Latin America, sex
education and pro-abortion programs for young girls globally, and much
more. These types of programs do not make America stronger, safer or
more prosperous.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>A day earlier, the State Department sent a memo citing examples of
unworthy projects, including $102 million to fund humanitarian aid
nonprofit International Medical Corps’ work in war-battered Gaza.  </p>
<p>A USAID report says the agency delivered about $7 million worth of
male condoms and about $1 million in female condoms in the 2023 fiscal
year. In total, the agency said it disbursed nearly 138 million male
condoms and 1.7 million female condoms worldwide. </p>
<p>Under USAID, the main administrator for U.S. foreign development
funds, the bulk of contraceptive items were delivered to African
countries, according to the report. Jordan was the only country in the
Middle East to receive a shipment, which consisted of injectable and
oral contraceptives valued at $45,680.  </p>
<p>‘Dramatic overreach’</p>
<p>At the U.S. Capitol, lawmakers not only affirmed the need for
accountability but also emphasized that Congress, not the White House,
decides how U.S. taxpayer money is spent.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I think it’s appropriate to have a review,” said Senator Kevin
Cramer, a North Dakota Republican.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“It would be my hope, however, that the aid can be reinstated and
flow to Ukraine,” Cramer said. “And then we’ll see in the next
appropriation cycle whether or not Congress still has the will to
continue that aid.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“This is dramatic overreach by the White House, by the president,”
said Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, a Democrat. “It’s unprecedented,
uncalled for. This is money that we have appropriated in our role as
members of the Senate and the House.”</p>

survivors after regional jet, US military helicopter collide at
Washington airport</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Dozens of people were feared dead Thursday after a passenger jet and
a U.S. military helicopter collided as the jet approached to land at
Ronald Reagan National Airport near Washington.</p>
<p>Emergency crews including boats and divers worked through the night
in the murky, frigid water of the Potomac River adjacent to the airport
where the wreckage fell after the collision around 9 p.m. Wednesday.</p>
<p>Officials said three U.S. Army soldiers were on the helicopter, which
was conducting a training flight. American Airlines, which operated the
flight traveling from Wichita, Kansas, to Washington, said in a
statement there were 60 passengers and four crew members on the
plane.</p>
<p>Authorities at an early Thursday briefing with reporters did not
confirm any deaths from the crash, saying the focus at that time was on
a rescue operation.</p>
<p>When asked if there were any survivors, Washington Fire Chief John
Donnelly said, “We don’t know yet, but we’re working.”</p>
<p>Donnelly said crews involving about 300 responders were working in
dark, difficult conditions, with frigid waters about 2.5 meters deep in
the areas where the wreckage was located.</p>
<p>U.S. Senator Roger Marshall of Kansas told the briefing, “We mourn
with the families that lost loved ones.”</p>
<p>“All those lives are so valuable, and it is such a tragedy that we
lost them,” Marshall said.</p>
<p>U.S. Figure Skating said several members of its community, including
athletes, coaches and family members, were among the passengers on the
plane.</p>
<p>“We are devastated by this unspeakable tragedy and hold the victims’
families closely in our hearts,” the organization said.</p>
<p>The Kremlin and Russian media said Russian figure skaters, including
world champion couple Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov, were on the
plane.</p>
<p>“It’s bad news today from Washington. We are sorry and send our
condolences to families and friends,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov
told reporters.</p>
<p>Video of the crash captured from a camera at the nearby Kennedy
Center shows two sets of lights converging before a fireball erupts.
Data from the plane showed it was at an altitude of about 120 meters at
the time of the collision.</p>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump said on his Truth Social platform, “What
a terrible night this has been.”</p>
<p>“It is a CLEAR NIGHT, the lights on the plane were blazing, why
didn’t the helicopter go up or down, or turn. Why didn’t the control
tower tell the helicopter what to do instead of asking if they saw the
plane,” Trump said. “This is a bad situation that looks like it should
have been prevented. NOT GOOD!!!”</p>
<p>U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called the situation “absolutely
tragic.”</p>
<p>“Search and rescue efforts still ongoing. Prayers for all impacted
souls, and their families,” Hegseth said on X.</p>
<p>American Airlines CEO Robert Isom said he and a team from the company
were traveling to Washington to provide assistance.</p>
<p>“This is a difficult day for all of us at American airlines and our
efforts now are focused entirely now on the needs of our passengers,
crew members, partners, first responders, along with their families and
loved ones,” Isom said in a video statement.</p>
<p>The last fatal U.S. passenger plane crash happened in 2009 in
Buffalo, New York.</p>

Federal Reserve holds rates steady, sees inflation as ‘elevated’</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left its benchmark interest rate
unchanged Wednesday after cutting it three times in a row last year, a
sign of a more cautious approach as the Fed seeks to gauge where
inflation is headed and what policies President Donald Trump may
pursue.</p>
<p>In a statement, the Fed said the job market is “solid,” and noted
that the unemployment rate “has stabilized at a low level in recent
months.” The Fed also appeared to toughen its assessment of inflation,
saying that it “remains somewhat elevated.” Both a healthier job market
and more stubborn inflation typically would imply fewer Fed rate cuts in
the coming months.</p>
<p>In a news conference Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell
largely deflected questions about recent comments from Trump, including
one from last week, when the president said he would lower oil prices
and then “demand” lower rates. He also said he would speak with Powell
about it.</p>
<p>“I’m not going to have any response or comment on whatever the
president said,” Powell said. Asked if Trump had communicated his desire
for lower rates directly to Powell, the Fed chair said he had “no
contact.”</p>
<p>Regarding the Fed’s key rate, Powell conveyed a more deliberate
approach, noting that the economy is mostly healthy — the unemployment
rate is a low 4.1% and growth topped 3% at an annual rate in the
fall.</p>
<p>“With … the economy remaining strong, we do not need to be in a hurry
to adjust our policy stance,” Powell said.</p>
<p>Asked about the potential impact of the sharp policy changes Trump
has proposed regarding tariffs, immigration, tax cuts and deregulation,
Powell said Fed policymakers are “waiting to see which policies are
enacted.”</p>
<p>“We don’t know what will happen,” he added. “We need to let those
policies be articulated before we can even begin to make a plausible
assessment of what their implications for the economy will be.”</p>
<p>Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide Financial, said
Powell’s comments suggest the Fed won’t cut rates again until the middle
of this year.</p>
<p>“We are all in wait-and-see mode, including the Fed,” she said.</p>
<p>The Fed reduced its rate last year to 4.3% from 5.3%, in part out of
concern that the job market was weakening. Hiring had slowed in the
summer and the unemployment rate ticked up, leading Fed officials to
approve an outsized half-point cut in September. Yet hiring rebounded
last month and the unemployment rate declined slightly, to a low
4.1%.</p>
<p>Powell has said it is harder to gauge where inflation is headed, in
part because of increased uncertainty around what policies Trump will
adopt and how quickly they will affect the economy. Higher tariffs and
tax cuts could push inflation higher, while deregulation could possibly
reduce it.</p>
<p>The Fed typically keeps interest rates high to slow borrowing and
spending and cool inflation.</p>
<p>In December, Fed officials signaled they may reduce their rate just
twice more this year. Goldman Sachs economists believe those cuts won’t
happen until June and December.</p>
<p>In November, inflation was just 2.4%, according to the Fed’s
preferred measure, not far from its 2% target. But excluding the
volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose a more painful
2.8% from a year earlier. The Fed pays close attention to core prices
because they are often a better guide to inflation’s future path.</p>
<p>Powell said the Fed wants to see “real progress on inflation or …
some weakness in the labor market before we consider” making further
cuts.</p>
<p>In a post to his Truth Social account late Wednesday, Trump
criticized the Fed for failing to curtail inflation, saying he would do
so by “unleashing American Energy production, slashing Regulation,
rebalancing international Trade, and reigniting American
Manufacturing.”</p>
<p>During the news conference, Powell was also asked about Trump’s
executive orders intended to limit diversity, equity and inclusion
programs, which Powell has previously backed.</p>
<p>“As has been our practice over many administrations, we are working
to align our policies with the executive orders as appropriate and
consistent with applicable law,” he said.</p>

id="trump-says-he-will-detain-undocumented-migrants-at-guantanamo-bay">Trump
says he will detain undocumented migrants at Guantanamo Bay</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>white house — U.S. President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he
would sign an executive action directing his administration to prepare
to detain undocumented migrants at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.</p>
<p>The U.S. detention facility is known mostly for housing military
prisoners and terror suspects, including those involved in the 9/11
attacks and members of the Taliban.</p>
<p>His order will instruct the Defense and Homeland Security departments
to prepare the U.S. naval base to hold 30,000 migrants, Trump said.</p>
<p>“Some of them are so bad we don’t even trust the countries to hold
them because we don’t want them coming back. So we’re going to send them
out to Guantanamo,” Trump added. “This will double our capacity
immediately. And tough, it’s a tough place to get out of.”</p>
<p>Trump made the announcement during a White House event during which
he signed the Laken Riley Act into law. It was the first legislation
he’d signed in his second term. The bill, named after a 22-year-old
nursing student who was murdered last year by an undocumented Venezuelan
immigrant, aims to expand the federal government’s mandate to detain
immigrants who are in the country illegally.</p>
<p>It’s unclear how the administration proposes to do this. Asked by
reporters, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said this was
something the White House was “working on, to use resources that we
currently have there at Guantanamo Bay.”</p>
<p>“We’ll go through the process,” she said, adding that the
administration was working with lawmakers to fund it. She offered no
estimate of the cost.</p>
<p>A White House official, speaking on background, a method often used
by U.S. officials to remain anonymous, told VOA that Trump had signed a
presidential memorandum regarding housing migrants at Guantanamo.</p>
<p>Presidential memoranda are less formal than executive orders. For
example, they do not have to be submitted to the Federal Register for
publication.</p>
<p>Late Wednesday, the White House published the executive
memorandum.</p>
<p>Trump’s border czar, Tom Homan, said Wednesday that U.S. Coast Guard
personnel already tasked to intercept illegal migrants at sea “can take
them straight to Guantanamo Bay.”</p>
<p>Homan told reporters that migrants had been housed there before.</p>
<p>“So we’re just going to expand upon the existing migrant center
logistics to work for that,” he said.</p>
<p>According to a September 2024 report from the International Refugee
Assistance Project, the U.S. has for decades detained migrants
intercepted at sea in the Migrant Operations Center at Guantanamo Bay
under prisonlike conditions.</p>
<p>IRAP and other immigration rights advocates have called for the
immediate closure of the migrant center. The organization also called on
Congress to investigate alleged human rights abuses at the facility and
called for the end of migrant detention operations everywhere.</p>
<p>Later Wednesday, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called
Guantanamo Bay the “perfect place” for criminal migrants. Hegseth told
Fox News that Guantanamo Bay could also temporarily hold other
undocumented immigrants while they’re waiting to be sent back to their
home countries.</p>
<p>“It’s folks who maybe are in transit to their home country or a safe
harbor country, and it’s taking a little time to move with that
processing of the paperwork,” he said, adding, “Better they be held at a
safe location, like Guantanamo Bay, which is meant and built for
migrants, meant and built to sustain that away from the American
people.”</p>
<p>According to media reports, Immigration and Customs Enforcement
averaged 710 arrests per day from Thursday through Monday, more than
double the daily average of 311 recorded in the 12-month period through
September under President Joe Biden.</p>
<p>If ICE officers continue with these detentions, it would exceed the
agency’s previous record set during President Barack Obama’s
administration in 2013, when daily arrests averaged 636.</p>
<p>The Trump administration has intensified deportations, with ICE
regularly updating arrest figures. The swift removals have sometimes
created challenges in determining where to send deportees, especially
when certain countries refuse to accept them.</p>
<p>Closing Guantanamo</p>
<p>Democratic administrations under Obama and Biden had sought to close
the notorious detention camp. It was built by the George W. Bush
administration in the Guantanamo Bay U.S. naval base facility in 2002
following the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan that began shortly after the
9/11 attacks of 2001.</p>
<p>Rights groups say that Guantanamo is a symbol of U.S. disregard for
the rule of law, as many detainees were held there without charge or
trial.</p>
<p>Sue Hendrickson, president and CEO of Human Rights First, said in a
statement that sending migrants to Guantanamo would create a human
rights catastrophe.</p>
<p>“Housing accused terrorists at Guantanamo has been a debacle. For the
past 20 years, the U.S. government has locked up people it never even
accused of taking action against the United States while continually
failing to try those credibly charged with serious crimes,” she
wrote.</p>
<p>“The Trump administration may find the symbolism of sending migrants
to Guantanamo darkly appealing; its practical result would be more
injustice, waste and self-inflicted loss of credibility,” Hendrickson
added.</p>
<p>At its height during the Global War on Terror, the detention facility
held about 680 prisoners. According to the Pentagon, as of January 6,
there were just 15 detainees at the facility.</p>
<p>Before being used to detain terror suspects, the U.S. naval facility
was also used to house migrants from Cuba and Haiti in the early 1990s,
per the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.</p>
<p>“At one point in late 1994, the migrant population of the naval
station approached 45,000,” a CRS report dated August 2022 said. The
report noted the last of the migrants had left by the end of January
1996.</p>

<p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President Donald Trump’s nominee to serve as
the nation’s top health official, faced tough questions from senators
Wednesday about his views on vaccinations, COVID-19 and the nation’s
health care system. A member of one of America’s most famous political
families, Kennedy could face a tough road to confirmation. VOA’s

id="former-us-senator-menendez-gets-11-years-in-prison-for-bribes-acting-as-agent-of-egypt">Former
US Senator Menendez gets 11 years in prison for bribes, acting as agent
of Egypt</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Former U.S. Senator Bob Menendez was sentenced Wednesday
to 11 years in prison for accepting bribes of gold and cash and acting
as an agent of Egypt — crimes his own lawyer said earned him the
nickname “Gold Bar Bob.” </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Sidney H. Stein announced the sentence after the
Democrat tearfully addressed the judge, saying he’d lost everything he
cared about, except for his family. </p>
<p>“You were successful, powerful, you stood at the apex of our
political system,” the judge said. ”Somewhere along the way, and I don’t
know when it was, you lost your way and working for the public good
became working for your good.” </p>
<p>Menendez’s actions, the judge said, feeds the cynicism of
voters. </p>
<p>“What’s been the result?” he said, noting a lengthy investigation of
a five-year crime. “You lost your senate seat. You lost your
chairmanship and you lost your good name.” </p>
<p>Menendez, 71, who tearfully told the judge in court that he was
chastened, was defiant when he stepped before cameras at a bank of
microphones outside the Manhattan courthouse, saying: “I am
innocent.” </p>
<p>He then railed against the judicial system and aligned himself with
President Donald Trump’s recent criticisms of the judicial system,
particularly in New York City. </p>
<p>“President Trump is right. This process is political and it’s
corrupted to the core. I hope President Trump cleans up the cesspool and
restores the integrity to the system,” he said, reading from a sheet of
paper and calling himself the victim of “the Wild West of political
prosecutions.” </p>
<p>Prosecutors had requested a 15-year prison term for Menendez, who was
convicted of multiple charges including acting as an agent for Egypt for
selling his once-considerable clout in Washington for bribes worth
hundreds of thousands of dollars. </p>
<p>Menendez: I’ve done more good than bad</p>
<p>Given a chance to speak in court, Menendez broke down several times
as he described his accomplishments. </p>
<p>“You really don’t know the man you are about to sentence,” Menendez
told Stein as he stood before him with his hands in his pockets, except
when he wiped his face several times with a tissue. </p>
<p>“Your honor, I am far from a perfect man. I have made more than my
share of mistakes and bad decisions,” he added. “I’ve done far more good
than bad. I ask you, your honor, to judge me in that context.” </p>
<p>Attorney Adam Fee told Stein to give Menendez credit for a “lifetime
of extraordinary public service and personal sacrifices.” </p>
<p>“Despite his decades of service, he is now known more widely as Gold
Bar Bob,” Fee said. </p>
<p>Menendez’s lawyers had said prior to the sentencing that their client
deserves less than two years in prison, describing how the son of Cuban
immigrants rose from poverty to become “the epitome of the American
Dream” before his conviction had “rendered him a national
punchline.” </p>
<p>He’d beaten a prosecution once before. </p>
<p>In 2015, he was charged with selling his influence to a wealthy
Florida eye doctor and entrepreneur who prosecutors said lavished him
with luxury vacations and campaign contributions. But the jury in that
case couldn’t reach a unanimous verdict. Federal prosecutors dropped the
case rather than put him on trial again. </p>
<p>Businessmen sentenced</p>
<p>Before sentencing Menendez, Stein sentenced two men convicted of
bribing Menendez, giving Fred Daibes, a real estate developer, a
seven-year prison term and Wael Hana, an entrepreneur, eight years
behind bars. </p>
<p>Prior to the announcement of his sentence, Daibes, 67, tearfully told
Stein the jury verdict had left him “borderline suicidal,” and requested
leniency so that he could care for his 30-year-old autistic son. </p>
<p>Hana told the judge, “I am an innocent man.” </p>
<p>A third businessman pleaded guilty and testified against Menendez at
a trial last year. </p>
<p>Menendez resigned from the Senate after his conviction last year,
though he lost much of his power in fall 2023 when the charges against
him were revealed and he was forced to surrender his powerful post as
chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. </p>
<p>Wife faces trial</p>
<p>The trial traced Menendez’s dealings with Egyptian officials and his
quest to aid three men who showered him with lucrative gifts found
during a 2022 raid on the Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, home he shared
with his wife, Nadine. His wife faces a March trial on many of the same
charges as her husband. </p>
<p>FBI agents who searched the house found $480,000, some of it stuffed
inside boots and the pockets of clothing hung in the couple’s closets.
They also seized gold bars worth an estimated $150,000. </p>
<p>Prosecutors said Menendez had “put his high office up for sale in
exchange for this hoard of bribes,” including by serving Egypt’s
interests as he worked to protect a meat certification monopoly Hana had
established with the Egyptian government. </p>
<p>Among other things, Menendez provided Egyptian officials with
information about the staff at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo and ghostwrote
a letter to fellow senators encouraging them to lift a hold on $300
million in military aid to Egypt. </p>
<p>Prosecutors said that for other bribes, Menendez attempted to
persuade a federal prosecutor in New Jersey to go easy on Daibes, a
politically influential real estate developer accused of bank
fraud. </p>
<p>And at the trial, another businessman, Jose Uribe, testified that he
helped Nadine Menendez get a Mercedes-Benz convertible after the senator
sought to pressure state prosecutors to drop criminal probes of his
associates. </p>
<p>Menendez has insisted that he is innocent of any crime, saying
repeatedly that his interactions with Egyptian officials were normal for
the head of the Foreign Relations Committee, and that he always put
American interests first. He denied taking any bribes and said the gold
bars belonged to his wife. </p>
<p>In court papers, Menendez’s lawyers described how Menendez devoted
much of his life to his country and his community after he was scarred
by the early loss of his father, who killed himself when Menendez was 23
after he was unable to pay off gambling debts. </p>
<p>They described a 50-year history of public service in heroic terms,
tracing a career in which Menendez was mayor of Union City, New Jersey,
a state lawmaker, a member of the U.S. House and then a senator from
2006 to 2024.</p>

id="what-is-the-laken-riley-act-a-look-at-the-first-bill-trump-signed">What
is the Laken Riley Act? A look at the first bill Trump signed</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed the
first bill of his new term, and it is named after a slain Georgia
nursing student whose name became a rallying cry during his White House
campaign.</p>
<p>Trump said that he appreciated the bipartisan support for the first
piece of legislation since he took office on Jan. 20.</p>
<p>The Laken Riley Act will require the detention of unauthorized
immigrants accused of theft and violent crimes. The bill won bipartisan
support in the House and Senate. Senator John Fetterman, a Democrat,
attended Wednesday’s bill signing at the White House.</p>
<p>Here are some things to know about the Laken Riley Act:</p>
<p>Who was Laken Riley?</p>
<p>Riley, 22, was a student at Augusta University College of Nursing
when she went out for a run on Feb. 22, 2024. Prosecutors said she
encountered Jose Antonio Ibarra, who killed her during a struggle.
Ibarra waived his right to a jury trial and was found guilty in November
of murder and other crimes by a judge, who alone heard and decided the
case. Ibarra was sentenced to life without parole.</p>
<p>Trump and other Republicans blamed former President Joe Biden for her
death because Ibarra had been arrested for illegal entry in September
2022 near El Paso, Texas, amid an unprecedented surge in migration and
released to pursue his case in immigration court.</p>
<p>“If this act had been the law of the land, he never would have had
the opportunity to kill her,” said Representative Mike Collins, a
Republican.</p>
<p>Biden mentioned Riley during his State of the Union address last year
as he spoke about border security and after Representative Marjorie
Taylor Greene, a Republican, shouted at him, “Say her name!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What does the bill do?</p>
<p>Under the new law, federal officials will be required to detain any
migrant arrested or charged with crimes such as shoplifting or
assaulting a police officer or crimes that injure or kill someone.</p>
<p>“If you come into this country illegally and you commit a crime, you
should not be free to roam the streets of this nation,” said Senator
Katie Britt of Alabama, who helped push the bill through the Senate.</p>
<p>The bill also empowers state attorneys general to sue the federal
government for harm caused by failures or decisions in immigration
enforcement that harm states or people. That includes releasing migrants
from custody or failing to detain migrants who have received deportation
orders.</p>
<p>The provision gives states some power in setting immigration policy
when they have been trying to push back against presidential decisions
under the Trump and Biden administrations.</p>
<p>While Republicans control both chambers of Congress, 46 Democrats in
the House and 12 Democrats in the Senate supported the measure.</p>
<p>Why did most Democrats oppose it?</p>
<p>Some have raised concerns that the bill will strip due process rights
for migrants, including minors or recipients of the Deferred Action for
Childhood Arrivals program.</p>
<p>“In the wake of tragedy, we are seeing a fundamental erosion of our
civil rights,” said Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez. “In this
bill, if a person is so much as accused of a crime, if someone wants to
point a finger and accuse someone of shoplifting, they would be rounded
up and put into a private detention camp and sent out for deportation
without a day in court.”</p>
<p>Most Democrats criticized the lack of funding in the bill, arguing
the new law will not solve immigration problems but will impose new
requirements on federal authorities. Democrats on the Appropriations
Committee estimate the bill will cost $83 billion over the next three
years, according to a memo obtained by The Associated Press.</p>
<p>Senator Chris Murphy said the bill is “a totally unfunded
mandate.”</p>
<p>Why did some Democrats back it?</p>
<p>Democrats who supported it were mostly from five battleground states
and said their constituents demanded more border security and supported
deportations of migrants accused of crimes.</p>
<p>“Anyone who commits a crime should be held accountable. That’s why I
voted to pass the Laken Riley Act,” Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, a
Democrat from Nevada, said on social media after its passage.</p>
<p>New Hampshire Senators Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan and Virginia
Senator Mark Warner also supported the bill. Shaheen and Warner are each
up for a fourth term next year.</p>
<p>Fetterman, who also backed the bill because he wants a “secure
border,” was the first Senate Democrat to meet with Trump after the
election. He has met with many of Trump’s Cabinet picks and broken with
his own party on some policy.</p>
<p>Senator Ruben Gallego, whose parents are immigrants from Mexico and
Colombia, was elected in November and became Arizona’s first Latino
senator. He said he supported the bill.</p>
<p>“We must give law enforcement the means to take action when illegal
immigrants break the law, to prevent situations like what occurred to
Laken Riley,” he said in a statement.</p>

id="kennedy-struggles-to-answer-questions-at-confirmation-hearing-for-top-health-post">Kennedy
struggles to answer questions at confirmation hearing for top health
post</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — In a contentious confirmation hearing on his nomination
to become the nation’s top health official, Robert F. Kennedy
Jr. struggled to answer questions about how he would reform Medicaid or
Medicare, the government health care programs used by millions of
disabled, poor and older Americans.</p>
<p>Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a physician and key
vote Kennedy needs to win, repeatedly pressed the nominee on Wednesday
to share ways he plans to reform Medicaid, a multibillion-dollar
taxpayer-funded program that covers health care for about 80 million
people, including children. Republicans have said they might need to
make deep cuts to Medicaid to fund President Donald Trump’s
proposals.</p>
<p>“I don’t have a broad proposal for dismantling the program,” Kennedy
said.</p>
<p>Kennedy also inaccurately claimed that Medicaid is fully paid for by
the federal government. It’s not; states and federal taxpayers fund it.
He also said most Americans have purchased a Medicare Advantage plan,
when only about 1 in 10 Americans have.</p>
<p>His misstatements about the program were peppered in between
suggestions that he would seek to push privatization of the programs,
repeatedly saying that most Americans like private insurance and that
they dislike the government-run versions of the programs.</p>
<p>Kennedy is seeking to lead the Department of Health and Human
Services, an agency with a $1.7 trillion budget that oversees, among
other things, vaccine recommendations, food inspections, hospital
oversight, and funding for hundreds of community health clinics.</p>
<p>In sometimes heated exchanges Wednesday, Kennedy denied that he is
anti-vaccine. But Kennedy, who pointed out that his children are
vaccinated, acknowledged he has asked “uncomfortable questions” about
vaccinations.</p>
<p>“I believe that vaccines play a critical role in health care,”
Kennedy told the Senate Finance Committee.</p>
<p>Republicans did not ask Kennedy about his vaccine views during the
first hour of the hearing.</p>
<p>But Democrats did, with Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon pointing out that
Kennedy has previously claimed there’s “no safe” vaccine, initiating a
back-and-forth between him and Kennedy. Wyden also quoted from Kennedy’s
books, which say that parents have been “misled” on the measles
vaccine.</p>
<p>“You have spent years pushing conflicting stories about vaccines,”
Wyden said.</p>
<p>Over many years, Kennedy has expressed his beliefs about vaccines in
dozens of interviews, podcasts and social media posts.</p>
<p>He’s led a nonprofit that has sued the government over its
authorizations of vaccines. He has said there is “no vaccine that is
safe and effective” and repeatedly has called for further study of
routine childhood vaccinations, despite decades of research and
real-world use that prove they’ve safely prevented disease.</p>
<p>Republicans focused on questions about agriculture, food and the
abortion pill, which many women access via telemedicine systems.</p>
<p>Kennedy tried to assure senators that he would not seek widespread
bans on vaccines or food, saying he wants to provide more information to
people.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to take food away from anybody,” he said. “If you like
a cheeseburger – a McDonald’s cheeseburger and a Diet Coke, like my boss
— you should be able to get them.”</p>
<p>Kennedy hails from one of the nation’s most storied political
families and is the son of the late Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy
and the nephew of President John F. Kennedy.</p>
<p>He first challenged President Joe Biden for the 2024 Democratic
presidential nomination. He then ran as an independent but abandoned his
bid over the summer after striking a deal to endorse Trump, a
Republican, in exchange for a promise to serve in a health policy role
during a second Trump administration.</p>
<p>Trump selected Kennedy in November, shortly after he won the
presidential election, saying Kennedy would “end the Chronic Disease
epidemic” and “Make America Great and Healthy Again!” With Kennedy being
one of the most prominent anti-vaccine activists in the world, his
nomination immediately alarmed some public health officials.</p>

id="white-house-rescinds-memo-freezing-federal-grants-after-widespread-confusion">White
House rescinds memo freezing federal grants after widespread
confusion</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump’s budget office on Wednesday
rescinded a memo freezing spending on federal grants, less than two days
after it sparked widespread confusion and legal challenges across the
country.</p>
<p>The Monday evening memo from the White House Office of Management and
Budget sparked uncertainty over a crucial financial lifeline for states,
schools and organizations that rely on trillions of dollars from
Washington and left the White House scrambling to explain what would and
wouldn’t be subject to a pause in funding.</p>
<p>The reversal was the latest sign that even with unified control of
Washington, Trump’s plans to dramatically and rapidly reshape the
government has some limits.</p>
<p>The White House confirmed that OMB pulled the memo Wednesday in a
two-sentence notice sent to agencies and departments but said that
Trump’s underlying executive orders targeting federal spending in areas
such as diversity, equity and inclusion and climate change remained in
place.</p>
<p>Administration officials said the notice to halt loans and grants was
necessary to conduct a review to ensure that spending complies with
Trump’s recent blitz of executive orders. Agencies had been directed to
answer a series of yes or no questions on each federal program by
Feb. 7. The questions included “does this program promote gender
ideology?” and “does this program promote or support in any way
abortion?”</p>
<p>Still, the vaguely worded memo, combined with incomplete answers from
the White House throughout the day, left lawmakers, public officials and
average Americans struggling to figure out what programs would be
affected by the pause. Even temporary interruptions in funding could
cause layoffs or delays in public services.</p>
<p>The freeze was scheduled to go into effect at 5 p.m. Tuesday but was
stayed by a federal judge until at least Monday after an emergency
hearing requested by nonprofit groups that receive federal grants. An
additional lawsuit by Democratic state attorneys general was also
pending.</p>
<p>“The Executive Orders issued by the President on funding reviews
remain in full force and effect and will be rigorously implemented by
all agencies and departments,” White House press secretary Karoline
Leavitt said, blaming the confusion on the courts and news outlets, not
the administration. “This action should effectively end the court case
and allow the government to focus on enforcing the President’s orders on
controlling federal spending.”</p>
<p>Administration officials insisted that despite the confusion, the
order still had its intended effect by underscoring to federal agencies
their obligations to abide by Trump’s executive orders.</p>
<p>Although Trump had promised to turn Washington upside down if elected
to a second term, the effects of his effort to pause funding were being
felt far from the nation’s capital. Organizations such as Meals on
Wheels, which receives federal money to deliver food to the elderly, and
Head Start, which provides early childcare in lower-income communities,
were worried about getting cut off.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Trump administration officials said programs that provide
direct assistance to Americans, including Medicare, Social Security,
student loans and food stamps, would not be affected. But they sometimes
struggled to provide a clear picture.</p>
<p>Leavitt initially would not say whether Medicaid was exempted from
the freeze, but the administration later clarified that it was.</p>
<p>Democratic critics of the order moved swiftly to celebrate the
action.</p>
<p>“This is an important victory for the American people whose voices
were heard after massive pressure from every corner of this country —
real people made a difference by speaking out,” said Senator Patty
Murray. “Still, the Trump administration — through a combination of
sheer incompetence, cruel intentions and a willful disregard of the law
— caused real harm and chaos for millions over the span of the last 48
hours which is still ongoing.”</p>
<p>Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said, “Americans fought back,
and Donald Trump backed off.”</p>

rages over Trump’s push to end birthright citizenship</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washignton — President Donald Trump’s executive order to end
birthright citizenship in the U.S. has ignited a legal and political
debate, raising questions about the 14th Amendment to the U.S.
Constitution and the extent of presidential power.</p>
<p>The amendment guarantees citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil.</p>
<p>“We’re the only country in the world that does this with birthright,
as you know. And it’s just absolutely ridiculous. But, you know, we’ll
see. We think we have very good grounds and certain people have wanted
to do this for decades,” Trump said while signing the executive order on
his first day in office.</p>
<p>The United States is one of about 30 countries that grant automatic
citizenship to individuals born on their soil, including Brazil, Mexico,
and Canada, among others. The practice is known as jus soli (Latin for
“right of the soil”). But the U.S. remains notable for its broad
application of unconditional jus soli, as enshrined in the 14th
Amendment.</p>
<p>Are there limits to 14th Amendment?</p>
<p>The amendment, ratified in 1868, was designed to address citizenship
questions following the U.S. Civil War and to overrule the Supreme
Court’s 1857 Dred Scott decision, which denied African Americans
citizenship.</p>
<p>The text reads: “All persons born or naturalized in the United
States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the
United States and of the State wherein they reside.”</p>
<p>“This language ratifies the traditional understanding that anyone
born in the United States is automatically a citizen,” John Yoo, a
professor at University of California Berkeley Law School and visiting
fellow at the Hoover Institute, told VOA in a phone intervie</p>
<p>However, critics argue that the phrase “subject to the jurisdiction
thereof” implies that at least one parent must be a U.S. citizen for a
child to be granted citizenship.</p>
<p>According to Yoo, this interpretation aligns more closely with the
European jus sanguinis, or “law of blood” approach, which ties
citizenship to parentage rather than birthplace.</p>
<p>“To me, that just doesn’t make sense of the language of the 14th
Amendment and historical practice,” Yoo said. “The Supreme Court, in
cases like United States v. Wong Kim Ark, has consistently interpreted
the amendment to mean birthright citizenship.”</p>
<p>Critics of Trump’s executive order say the 14th Amendment is a
cornerstone of civil rights in the United States.</p>
<p>However, supporters of the executive order argue a more limited
interpretation of the amendment is warranted.</p>
<p>“President Trump has made it clear that restoring fairness to our
immigration system and defending the true intent of the 14th Amendment
are central to his vision of making America great again,” Republican
Congressman Brian Babin of Texas, told reporters during a press
conference last Thursday.</p>
<p>Amy Swearer, a senior legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a
conservative think tank, wrote in a report in 2019 that there is good
reason for the United States to reconsider its long-standing policy of
automatically granting citizenship to everyone born on U.S. soil.</p>
<p>Swearer argued that the 14th Amendment was intended to give
birthright citizenship only to those U.S.-born children whose parents
were “like the freed slaves, subject to the complete jurisdiction of the
United States. In a modern immigration context, this would mean that the
Constitution only mandates birthright citizenship for the U.S.-born
children of citizens, nationals, and lawful permanent residents.”</p>
<p>Legal challenges</p>
<p>Trump’s executive order is facing significant legal challenges, with
multiple lawsuits in progress. Twenty-two Democratic-led states have
filed a lawsuit arguing the order violates the 14th Amendment.</p>
<p>A federal judge in Seattle has temporarily stopped the birthright
citizenship order from taking effect. Last Thursday, U.S. District Judge
John C. Coughenour of Seattle temporarily blocked it, describing it as
“blatantly unconstitutional.”</p>
<p>But if the case reaches the Supreme Court, the outcome could reshape
the nation’s understanding of citizenship.</p>
<p>If the court were to side with Trump, the most immediate impact will
be on newborns and those yet to receive birth certificates and Social
Security numbers. And questions about retroactive application would
arise.</p>
<p>“Figuring out how this rule would operate retroactively is extremely
complex. Would it deny citizenship to people born here historically
without citizen parents? How far back would it go? These are precisely
the issues the 14th Amendment was designed to avoid,” Yoo told VOA.</p>
<p>While much of the focus is on judicial challenges, Yoo pointed out
that Congress could settle the issue legislatively.</p>
<p>“Congress could extend birthright citizenship by statute, reaffirming
the traditional understanding. But it’s unclear what Congress might do
in this politically charged environment,” Yoo said.</p>
<p>Still, he believes the Supreme Court would uphold birthright
citizenship.</p>
<p>“The text of the 14th Amendment, its history, and consistent Supreme
Court rulings all point to birthright citizenship,” he said.</p>

id="defense-secretary-pulls-trump-critic-gen.-milleys-security-clearance-protective-detail">Defense
secretary pulls Trump critic Gen. Milley’s security clearance,
protective detail</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is pulling the security
protections and clearance of retired Joint Chiefs chairman Gen. Mark
Milley, and he has ordered the Pentagon’s inspector general to review
Milley’s actions while serving as the nation’s top uniformed officer to
determine if a demotion is warranted, two defense officials confirmed
late Tuesday.</p>
<p>The inspector general review will include “an inquiry into the facts
and circumstances surrounding Gen Milley’s conduct so that the Secretary
may determine whether it is appropriate to reopen his military grade
review determination,” said Pentagon spokesman John Ullyot.</p>
<p>“The Secretary informed General Milley today that he is revoking the
authorization for his security detail and suspending his security
clearance as well,” he said.</p>
<p>Milley served as chairman during President Donald Trump’s first term
in office. While the relationship initially went well, it soured deeply
and fast, as Milley tried to advise and contain the president on a host
of issues.</p>
<p>Milley pushed back on the president’s interest in using force
domestically to quell protestors after the death of George Floyd, and he
was at the center of a controversy in 2021 when he made independent
calls to his Chinese counterpart. Trump called the calls an act of
treason, but at the time Milley said the calls were routine and part of
the scope of his job.</p>
<p>Milley in his final days as chairman after Trump had left office was
equally outspoken about his former boss. He said at his official
retirement ceremony “ we don’t take an oath to a king or a queen or to a
tyrant or a dictator. And we don’t take an oath to a wannabe
dictator.”</p>
<p>“We don’t take an oath to an individual. We take an oath to the
Constitution, and we take an oath to the idea that is America, and we’re
willing to die to protect it,” he said at the time.</p>
<p>Hegseth’s chief of staff Joe Kasper said that the decision to strip
Milley of his clearance and detail was taken because “undermining the
chain of command is corrosive to our national security, and restoring
accountability is a priority for the Defense Department under President
Trump’s leadership.”</p>
<p>The moves, which were first reported by Fox News, also may include
taking down Milley’s Army chief of staff portrait. Milley’s chairman
portrait was stripped from the wall just hours after Trump was sworn in.
The portraits were both paid for by a donation from the Association of
the United States Army, not taxpayer dollars, and were a gift to Milley
honoring his service.</p>

vast swathes of the federal government most relevant to the energy

National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a Commerce Department
subagency that produces climate science and weather forecasting. The
order was set to take effect at 5 p.m. but a federal judge temporarily

from the World Weather Attribution. Warmer weather, drier conditions,
and a longer fire season all supercharged the fires, the group said,
making them not only more likely, but 6% more intense. It also found
that the state’s dry season has gotten about 23 days longer, and the
likelihood of no rainfall in the last three months of the year has
doubled since pre-industrial years. “What makes [these fires] ever more
dangerous, and what is something that the government of California alone

<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/renewables-permitting-pause" target="_self"><u>many</u></a>
actions President Donald Trump took in his first week to curtail clean
energy and climate policy in the U.S., he issued an order
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/wind-executive-order-trump" target="_self"><u>freezing
all wind farm approvals</u></a>. It’s anyone’s guess what happens next.
On the one hand, we know the president
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-wind-solar-fact-check" target="_self"><u>hates
wind energy</u></a> — as he reiterated during his first
post-inauguration interview on <em><em>Fox News</em></em> last week: “We
don’t want windmills in this country.” But the posture is also at odds
with Trump’s declaration of a national energy emergency and vision for
“energy dominance.” Plus, it’s Trump. There’s a non-zero chance he’ll
change his mind.
</p>
<p>
But let’s assume the wind leasing and permitting freeze stays in place
for the next four years. Trump also plans to “conduct a comprehensive
review of the ecological, economic, and environmental necessity of
terminating or amending” <em><em>existing</em></em> leases, which could
upheave projects already under construction or built. How do we make
sense of what this all means for climate change?
</p>
<h3>
Will the United States be able to meet its emissions goals?
</h3>
<p>
First let’s look at what’s in the pipeline: If the pause on new leases
and permits for offshore wind remains in place for the next four years,
but all pre-approved projects get built, the U.S. could have about 13
gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030.
</p>
<p>
Three operating offshore wind projects currently send 174 megawatts of
power to the U.S. grid. There are four projects under construction up
and down the Atlantic, which are expected to generate about 5,021
megawatts once completed. Seven additional projects have all of their
federal permits, and if built, could generate 7,730 megawatts. That’s a
bigger “if” for some than others — three of the projects have not yet
found anyone to buy their power.
</p>

</iframe>
</center>
<p>
13 gigawatts falls far short of a goal that the Biden administration set
at the beginning of his presidency to deploy 30 gigawatts by 2030. But
it was already becoming clear that the U.S. was going to miss that
target. Last summer, the American Clean Power Association, which
represents the offshore wind industry,
<a href="https://cleanpower.org/news/offshore-wind-to-invest-65-billion-and-create-56000jobs-by-2030/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>projected</u></a>
that we were on track for about 14 gigawatts by that year, with 30
gigawatts achievable by 2033 and 40 gigawatts by 2035.
</p>
<p>
Cutting emissions sooner is, of course, better than later, but this
doesn’t necessarily veer us off course for the longer-term goal of
reaching net-zero emissions by 2050, either. One of the most
comprehensive looks at how to decarbonize the grid is
<a href="https://netzeroamerica.princeton.edu/?explorer=year&state=national&categories=pillar-2-clean-electricity&table=2030&limit=200" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Princeton
University’s Net Zero America report</u></a> from 2021 (co-led by Jesse
Jenkins, a co-host of Heatmap’s Shift Key podcast). The study models the
economic development of carbon-free energy systems under a number of
different scenarios in which energy demand grows more or less, and where
renewable development is more or less constrained. Across all of them,
offshore wind makes up less than 1% of the power system by 2030, with
between 5 and 10 gigawatts deployed — numbers that may still be
achievable. It then grows to between 1% and 7% of the system in 2050,
with anywhere from 30 to 460 gigawatts deployed.
</p>
<h3>
The story gets more complicated
</h3>
<p>
While the national picture looks okay, it’s a much bigger deal
regionally. For population centers on the East Coast, which don’t have
enough available land to build the onshore wind or solar resources
necessary to decarbonize, offshore wind is a linchpin. When modelers try
to decarbonize states like New York or New Jersey without offshore wind,
they end up with lots of transmission capacity to deliver clean power
from wind and solar farms all the way in the Midwest — a prospect that’s
no less, and potentially much more politically fraught than offshore
wind development. Unless other clean energy sources like nuclear or
geothermal power become cheap and abundant, there’s no clear alternative
path for a place like New York City to get to zero emissions.
</p>
<p>
State goals also become nearly impossible if no additional projects are
able to get through the permitting process until at least 2029. New York
State, for example, plans to deploy 9 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2035
so that it can achieve a carbon-free grid by 2040. It currently has just
1.8 gigawatts in the pipeline, with the potential for another 1.2 if
Empire Wind 2 bids into the state’s next solicitation. Maryland’s goal
is 8.5 gigawatts by 2031. It has just 1 gigawatt on the way.
Massachusetts aims to procure 5.6 gigawatts by 2027. It has contracts
for 3.4 gigawatts, but less than half are fully permitted.
</p>
<p>
Yet another way to think about the emissions consequences of this
permitting pause is in terms of opportunity cost — the projects that
will be delayed, assuming it lasts four years, and the lease areas that
will go unsold.
</p>
<p>
The Biden administration held several offshore wind lease sales, and
currently executed leases have the potential to generate more than 36
gigawatts, according to project development documents filed with the
Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and federal estimates. But the
projects planned for these lease areas are in various stages of
development, and some of them, like plans for floating offshore turbines
in California and Maine, have many technological hurdles to solve. A
four-year pause will affect those far less than the 16 gigawatts’ worth
of projects that have already started the federal permitting process.
</p>
<p>
The unsold areas represent a much bigger loss. The clean energy think
tank Energy Innovation
<a href="https://2035report.com/offshorewind/abundant-offshore-wind/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>found</u></a>
that the U.S. has potential to build more than 1,000 gigawatts of
“highly productive” offshore wind projects, meaning the wind is strong
and constant enough to keep the turbines spinning more than half the
time. We’ve leased less than 1% of that.
</p>
<p>
But by another measure, the opportunity cost for offshore wind might not
be significant considering the trajectory we’ve been on. Every year the
Rhodium Group, a clean energy research firm, models expected future
technology deployment and its emissions implications based on existing
policies and market conditions. The group’s
<a href="https://rhg.com/research/taking-stock-2024/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>2024
report</u></a> found that wind energy as a whole would reach 20% to 25%
of U.S. electricity generation by 2035. Those estimates include just 9
gigawatts to 12 gigawatts of offshore wind, with the vast majority from
onshore installations.
</p>
<h3>
What about onshore wind farms?
</h3>
<p>
That brings us to the implications of pausing onshore wind development,
which are arguably worse.
</p>
<p>
To date, the U.S. has installed about 152 gigawatts’ worth of land-based
wind farms. Under the Net Zero America scenarios, that number should
more than double by 2030. But deployment has slowed in recent years. The
U.S.
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/wind/land-based-wind-market-report" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>added
just 6.4 gigawatts</u></a> to the grid in 2023, down from 14.2 in 2020.
While the 2024 totals haven’t been published, we were
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=62864" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>on
track to add 7.1 gigawatts last year</u></a>. We’d have to add more than
three times that every year, starting this year, to meet the Net Zero
America study’s 2030 projections.
</p>
<p>
Onshore wind deployment has been held back, in part, by transmission
constraints. If the new administration clears hurdles to building more
power lines, it could help speed things up. Also, since many onshore
wind projects are built on private land, Trump’s order won’t have the
same sweeping effect that it will offshore. But
<a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/spotlight/trump-executive-order-wind" target="_self"><u>as
my colleague Jael Holzman reported</u></a>, the impact could still be
far-reaching. More than half of all wind projects under development may
be affected by the pause, as many are so tall that they need approvals
from the Federal Aviation Administration. Energy-hungry projects like
data centers may end up turning to natural gas, instead.
</p>
<p>
Trump’s executive order labels the pause of leasing and permitting as
“temporary,” so all of this is still hypothetical. Perhaps a bigger
existential threat to the industry would be if Congress decided to cut
the tax credits for wind energy or wind them down earlier than currently
planned to pay for the continuation of Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, many of
which expire this year. But since the tax credits are now
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/07/climate/ira-renewable-energy-tax-credits.html" target="_blank"><u>pooled
together</u></a> with other energy sources that Republicans support,
like nuclear and geothermal, under “technology neutral” credits, that
would be a lot harder to do.

On February 1 — that is, three days from now — President Donald Trump
has promised to apply a tariff of 25% to all U.S. imports from Canada
and Mexico, crude oil very much not excepted. Canada has been the
largest source of American crude imports for more than 20 years. More
than that, the U.S. oil industry has come to depend on Canada’s thick,
sulfurous oil to blend with America’s light, sweet domestic product to
suit its highly specialized refineries. If that heavy, gunky stuff
suddenly becomes a lot more expensive, so will U.S. oil refining.

Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Jesse Jenkins: </strong> I want to come back to what would
happen if Trump did impose these tariffs, but before we get there, I
think it’d be helpful just to understand a little bit more about what
life looks like on either side of the border.<br/> <br/> You mentioned
that Canada has become dependent on the U.S. market for export. My
understanding is that the refineries in the Midwest — because they are
now used to just using a single source of crude rather than, say, a
coastal refinery that might have to be more flexible because they could
get crude from Venezuela one day and from Saudi Arabia another day, or
something with different qualities. My understanding is that the
refineries in the Midwest have become pretty specialized and optimized
around refining specifically Canadian crude. Is that correct? And if so,
what, what are the features there? How challenging would it be for
refiners to switch to other supply in the U.S. if all of a sudden
Canadian crude becomes 25% more expensive? <br/> <br/> <strong>Rory
Johnston: </strong>Yeah, and you’re absolutely right. So — and I had
mentioned earlier, that one aspect of this entrenched relationship is
this physical infrastructure, and this other point is this business mode
optimization around the specific blend of crude.<br/> <br/> Now, for
those that aren’t aware, crude oil is not one thing. It is an endless
cornucopia soup of hydrocarbons that, generally, we can divide along a
two-part axis. On the one hand you have gravity or density, or weight of
the crude. And then the other side you have sulfur concentration. Sulfur
concentration is always bad because, you know, sulfur’s bad — acid rain,
we want to get rid of that. So that costs money to extract. And then the
density or the gravity, we talk about this in API gravity. The U.S.
crude, like shale crude — that’s often what we call light, tight oil —
is often 40 degrees API gravity or higher. It’s very, very, very light.
That’s lighter even than WTI, the benchmark itself, whereas Canadian
Western Canada select, which is the kind of primary export blend of
Canadian crude, is at 22 degrees gravity. Way, way, way, way heavier.
One of the heaviest major marketed crudes in the world and the largest,
heaviest, marketed grade in the world in terms of size of the particular
flow. <br/> <br/> So what happens is, well, when you look at the actual
blend that is consumed by U.S. refineries, it’s not that they consume a
heavy blend of crude. Their blended refinery slate is more of a medium
grade. But they have so much light crude, particularly from areas like
the North Dakota Bakken, that they need heavy crude to blend and get
that kind of medium grade in the middle. <br/> <br/> So — to your point,
though — that needs to happen. And particularly if you want to, let’s
say, keep consuming more U.S. domestic crude in the United States, then
you need heavy crude to blend with it to meet those refinery
specifications. <span></span>

administration offers resignation program amid effort to shrink federal
workforce</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The Trump administration issued a memo Tuesday offering federal
government workers a financial incentive to leave their posts by the end
of September.</p>
<p>The resignation program is part of the administration’s efforts to
shrink the federal workforce.</p>
<p>An email to many of the 2 million federal workers said they could
remain on the government payroll until Sept. 30, the end of the
government’s fiscal year, and could have their work duties reduced or
eliminated in the interim.</p>
<p>Those workers would also be exempt from a Trump mandate that
employees need to return to working in their offices full time.</p>
<p>Employees have until Feb. 6 to accept the offer, and were directed to
do so with an email reply with the word “resign.”</p>
<p>The potential impact of the program on tax-payer services was not
clear.</p>
<p>“While a few agencies and even branches of the military are likely to
see increases in the size of their workforce, the majority of federal
agencies are likely to be downsized through restructurings,
realignments, and reductions in force,” the memo said.</p>
<p>People working in immigration, national security and for the Postal
Service were not part of the offer.</p>
<p>The memo also said the “federal workforce should be comprised of
employees who are reliable, loyal, trustworthy, and who strive for
excellence in their daily work.”</p>
<p>Unions representing federal employees criticized the administration’s
move.</p>
<p>The National Treasury Employees Union, which represents about 150,000
federal workers, told its members the resignation memo “is designed to
entice or scare you into resigning” and said “we strongly urge you not
to resign in response.”</p>
<p>Everett Kelley, head of the American Federation of Government
Employees union that includes some VOA employees, said in a statement
that the offer “should not be viewed as voluntary” and that the
administration’s actions show its goal is “to turn the federal
government into a toxic environment where workers cannot stay even if
they want to.”</p>

children fall behind in reading, make little improvement in math</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — America’s children have continued to lose ground on
reading skills in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and have made little
improvement in math, according to the latest results of an exam known as
the nation’s report card.</p>
<p>The findings are yet another setback for U.S. schools and reflect the
myriad challenges that have upended education, from pandemic school
closures to a youth mental health crisis and high rates of chronic
absenteeism. The national exam results also show growing inequality:
While the highest-performing students have started to regain lost
ground, lower-performing students are falling further behind.</p>
<p>Given every two years to a sample of America’s children, the National
Assessment of Educational Progress is considered one of the best gauges
of the academic progress of the U.S. school system. The most recent exam
was administered in early 2024 in every state, testing fourth- and
eighth-grade students on math and reading.</p>
<p>“The news is not good,” said Peggy Carr, commissioner of the National
Center for Education Statistics, which oversees the assessment. “We are
not seeing the progress we need to regain the ground our students lost
during the pandemic.”</p>
<p>Among the few bright spots was an improvement in fourth grade math,
where the average score ticked up 2 points on a scale of 500. It’s still
3 points lower than the 2019 pre-pandemic average, yet some states and
districts made significant strides, including in Washington, D.C., where
the average score increased 10 points.</p>
<p>For the most part, however, American schools have not yet begun to
make progress.</p>
<p>The average math score for eighth grade students was unchanged from
2022, while reading scores fell 2 points at both grade levels. One-third
of eighth grade students scored below “basic” in reading, more than ever
in the history of the assessment.</p>
<p>Students are considered below basic if they are missing fundamental
skills. For example, eighth grade students who scored below basic in
reading were typically unable to make a simple inference about a
character’s motivation after reading a short story, and some were unable
to identify that the word “industrious” means “to be hard working.”</p>
<p>Especially alarming to officials was the divide between higher- and
lower-performing students, which has grown wider than ever. Students
with the highest scores outperformed their peers from two years ago,
making up some ground lost during the pandemic. But the lowest
performers are scoring even lower, falling further behind.</p>
<p>It was most pronounced in eighth grade math: While the top 10% of
students saw their scores increased by 3 points, the lowest 10%
decreased by 6 points.</p>
<p>“We are deeply concerned about our low-performing students,” said
Lesley Muldoon, executive director of the National Assessment Governing
Board, which sets policies for the exam. “For a decade, these students
have been on the decline. They need our urgent attention and our best
effort.”</p>
<p>The latest setbacks follow a historic backslide in 2022. In that
year’s exam, student achievement fell across both subjects and grade
levels, in some cases by unprecedented levels.</p>
<p>This round of testing again featured students whose lives were
disrupted by the pandemic. When COVID hit in 2020, the fourth graders
were in kindergarten, and the eighth graders were in fourth grade.</p>
<p>But Carr said poor results can no longer be blamed solely on the
pandemic, warning that the nation’s education system faces “complex
challenges.”</p>
<p>A survey done alongside the exam found in 2022 that fewer young
students were reading for enjoyment, which is linked to lower reading
scores. And new survey results found that students who are often absent
from class — a persistent problem nationwide — are struggling the
most.</p>
<p>“The data are clear,” Carr said. “Students who don’t come to school
are not improving.”</p>
<p>The results provide fresh fuel for a national debate over the impact
of pandemic school closures, though they’re unlikely to add clarity.
Some studies have found that longer closures led to bigger academic
setbacks. Those slower to reopen were often in urban and Democratic-led
areas, while more rural and Republican-led areas were quicker.</p>
<p>The new results don’t show a “direct link” on the topic, Carr said,
though she said students clearly do better when they’re in school.</p>
<p>Among the states that saw reading scores fall in 2024 are Florida and
Arizona, which were among the first to return to the classroom during
the pandemic. Meanwhile, some big school systems that had longer
closures made strides in fourth grade math, including Los Angeles and
New York City.</p>
<p>The success of big urban districts — 14 of which saw notable
improvement in fourth-grade math when the nation as a whole saw only
minor gains — can be credited to academic recovery efforts funded by
federal pandemic relief, said Ray Hart, executive director of the
Council of Great City Schools. Investing in efforts like intensive
tutoring programs and curriculum updates is “really proving to make a
difference,” he said.</p>
<p>Republicans in Congress were quick to cast blame on Democrats and
former President Joe Biden’s administration.</p>
<p>Rep. Tim Walberg, R-Mich., chair of the House Education and Workforce
Committee, said the decline is “clearly a reflection of the education
bureaucracy continuing to focus on woke policies rather than helping
students learn and grow.”</p>
<p>“I’m thankful we have an administration that is looking to reverse
course,” he said in a reference to President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Compared with 2019 results, eighth grade reading scores are now down
8 points. Reading scores are down 5 points in both grades. And in fourth
grade math, scores are down 3 points.</p>
<p>Yet officials say there’s reason to be optimistic. Carr highlighted
improvement in Louisiana, where fourth grade reading is now back above
pre-pandemic levels, and in Alabama, which accomplished that feat in
fourth grade math.</p>
<p>Carr was especially laudatory of Louisiana, where a campaign to
improve reading proficiency resulted in both higher- and
lower-performing students exceeding 2019 scores.</p>
<p>“I would not say that hope is lost, and I would not say that we
cannot turn this around,” Carr said. “It’s been demonstrated that we
can.”</p>

id="ice-to-use-us-military-base-in-colorado-to-detain-undocumented-migrants">ICE
to use US military base in Colorado to detain undocumented migrants</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. military said on Tuesday it will allow
Immigration and Customs Enforcement to detain undocumented migrants at
Buckley Space Force Base in Colorado, further widening the Pentagon’s
role in President Donald Trump’s undocumented immigration crackdown.</p>
<p>The decision comes on top of U.S. military deportation flights of
undocumented migrants out of the country and the deployment of just over
1,600 active-duty troops to the U.S. border with Mexico following
Trump’s emergency declaration on undocumented immigration last week.</p>
<p>The U.S. military’s Northern Command said in a statement it started
providing facilities at Buckley to ICE starting on Monday “to enable
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to stage and process criminal
aliens within the U.S.”</p>
<p>“ICE requirements for the facility include a temporary operations
center, staging area, and a temporary holding location for the
receiving, holding, and processing of illegal aliens,” Northern Command
said in the statement.</p>
<p>“This facility will be manned by ICE senior leaders, special agents,
and analysts, as well as members of (Department of Homeland Security)
components and other federal law enforcement agencies.”</p>
<p>Northern Command did not say how many undocumented migrants might be
detained at Buckley or whether additional U.S. military bases might soon
be opening for detention of undocumented migrants.</p>
<p>ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Buckley Space Force Base is located in the city of Aurora, a Denver
suburb, which figured prominently during Trump’s presidential campaign
last year. Trump said during his campaign that apartment complexes in
Aurora had been taken over by members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de
Aragua, a claim refuted by top city officials at the time. During a
campaign event there in October, Trump pledged to launch an Operation
Aurora targeting gang members.</p>
<p>This is not the first time a military has been used to house
undocumented migrants. The Pentagon had approved requests to house
unaccompanied migrant children under Joe Biden’s administration and
undocumented migrant children and families during Trump’s first
term.</p>
<p>Trump, a Republican, issued an array of executive orders on Monday
aimed at deporting record numbers of migrants in the U.S. without legal
status.</p>
<p>In a little more than a week in office, Trump rolled back Biden-era
guidance that limited arrests of non-criminal migrants, ordered other
federal law enforcement to assist with immigration work, and scrapped a
Biden policy that restricted enforcement at schools, churches, hospitals
and other sensitive locations.</p>
<p>Immigration arrests have reached about 1,000-1,200 per day in recent
days, according to ICE, far above the daily average of 311 in fiscal
year 2024.</p>
<p>Critics say Trump’s immigration crackdown could separate families,
hurt U.S. businesses and violate due process rights of migrants.</p>

id="caroline-kennedy-calls-on-us-lawmakers-to-oppose-rfk-jr.s-health-post">Caroline
Kennedy calls on US lawmakers to oppose RFK Jr.’s health post</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Caroline Kennedy, a member of the famed U.S. political family, urged
senators on Tuesday to reject her cousin Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s
nomination to lead the top U.S. health agency, calling him a “predator”
and his healthcare views “dangerous.”</p>
<p>The daughter of former President John F. Kennedy, Caroline Kennedy
said that Robert F. Kennedy Jr., known as RFK Jr., has discouraged
vaccinations for his own profit. She added he does not have the medical,
financial or government experience to lead the Department of Health and
Human Services. Republican President Donald Trump nominated him in
November.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for RFK Jr. did not immediately respond to a request
for comment.</p>
<p>Senators will question RFK Jr. on Wednesday starting at 10 a.m. about
his views before they vote on whether to confirm his nomination.</p>
<p>The Washington Post first reported the letter.</p>
<p>RFK Jr. has long sown doubts about the safety and efficacy of
vaccines that have helped curb disease and prevent deaths for decades.
He disputes the anti-vaccine characterization and has said he would not
prevent Americans from getting inoculations.</p>
<p>“Bobby has gone on to misrepresent, lie and cheat his way through
life today,” Caroline Kennedy said in a video on social media platform
X, in which she read her letter addressed to senators.</p>
<p>U.S. doctors, nurses, researchers, scientists and caregivers “deserve
a secretary committed to advancing cutting-edge medicine, to save lives,
not to rejecting the advances we have already made,” said Caroline
Kennedy, a former ambassador to Australia and Japan who served during
the Democratic Biden and Obama administrations. “They deserve a stable,
moral and ethical person at the helm of this crucial agency.”</p>
<p>In written testimony for the Finance committee, RFK Jr. said he is
not “anti-vaccine” or “anti-industry” and that he believes “vaccines
have a critical role in healthcare,” pointing to his own children being
vaccinated, according to the document seen by Reuters.</p>
<p>However, RFK Jr. has led the anti-vaccine group Children’s Health
Defense and in a 2023 interview with podcaster Lex Fridman said no
vaccines are safe and effective.</p>
<p>RFK Jr. has said he wants to work to end chronic disease, break any
ties between employees at the U.S. drug regulator and industry and
advise U.S. water systems to remove fluoride.</p>
<p>RFK Jr. has faced new scrutiny over his ties to Wisner Baum, a law
firm specializing in pharmaceutical drug injury cases.</p>
<p>He has an arrangement to earn 10% of fees awarded in contingency
cases he refers to the firm, according to a letter RFK Jr. wrote to an
HHS ethics official released last week.</p>
<p>If confirmed, RFK Jr. would retain that financial interest in cases
that do not directly impact the U.S. government, the letter said.</p>

id="trump-administration-freezes-foreign-development-assistance">Trump
administration freezes foreign development assistance</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WHITE HOUSE — The Trump administration has ordered a three-month
pause on almost all foreign development assistance pending a review to
see what fits in with the president’s “America First” policy. Aid groups
and human rights watchdogs warn that the freeze will put countless lives
around the world at risk.</p>
<p>The U.S. is the world’s largest provider of humanitarian assistance
and a global leader on HIV prevention and treatment through the
President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, program. In the
2023 fiscal year, the U.S. spent just short of $70 billion on
development aid, most of it through the U.S. Agency for International
Development, or USAID.</p>
<p>Within hours of taking office last week, President Donald Trump put
all but the most urgently needed food assistance on hold, part of his
charge to realign the nation’s foreign stance with his America First
policy. His executive order pauses new obligations and disbursements of
development assistance funds for 90 days while they are reviewed.</p>
<p>The move prompted questions in the U.S. and international aid
community, at the United Nations, and in the halls of the Capitol.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced in a memo Tuesday exemptions
to the freeze. These include life-saving medicine, medical services,
food, shelter and subsistence assistance.</p>
<p>“This waiver does not apply to activities that involve abortions,
family planning conferences, administrative costs … gender or DEI
[diversity, equity and inclusion] ideology programs, transgender
surgeries, or other non-life saving assistance,” the memo said.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Jim Risch, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
chairman, used a weekly press conference to cast Trump’s move as
fostering greater transparency as he lamented that previously it had
been tough for the committee to get information from government
agencies.</p>
<p>The State Department on Tuesday issued a lengthy explainer on the
order, which it said seeks to ensure that programs are “efficient and
consistent with U.S. foreign policy under the America First agenda.”</p>
<p>“President Trump stated clearly that the United States is no longer
going to blindly dole out money with no return for the American people,”
read the statement from State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce.
“Reviewing and realigning foreign assistance on behalf of hardworking
taxpayers is not just the right thing to do, it is a moral
imperative.”</p>
<p>Exceptions, Bruce continued, included foreign military financing for
Israel and Egypt and emergency food assistance. The memo also provided
“examples of this egregious funding,” which included expenditures as
large as $102 million to fund humanitarian aid nonprofit International
Medical Corps’ work in war-battered Gaza and as relatively small as
“$612,000 to fund technical assistance for family planning in Latin
America.”</p>
<p>The White House also laid out its rationale for a similar move
pausing domestic grants and loans starting on Tuesday, although press
secretary Karoline Leavitt was unable to clarify which domestic programs
are on pause.</p>
<p>“In the past four years, we’ve seen the Biden administration spend
money like drunken sailors,” she said. “It’s a big reason we’ve had an
inflation crisis in this country. And it’s incumbent upon this
administration to make sure, again, that every penny is being accounted
for, honestly.”</p>
<p>The White House did not reply to VOA’s request for more details on
which foreign assistance programs would be impacted. But on global
public health issues, Trump’s stance is clear: He also announced, on his
first day in office, that he would pull out of the World Health
Organization, citing concerns that the U.S. is being “ripped off” as the
organization’s largest donor. He did the same during his first term.</p>
<p>As stop-work orders are rolled out at U.S.-funded programs in dozens
of countries, humanitarian groups are sounding the alarm about the
future of billions of dollars’ worth of programs that focus on issues
such as gender equity, business development and the provision of
U.S.-funded HIV drugs, which Biden officials called a “key pillar” of
Washington’s relations with the developing world.</p>
<p>“The secretary-general notes with concern the announcement of a pause
in U.S. foreign assistance,” said Stephane Dujarric, spokesperson for
the United Nations secretary-general. “He calls for additional
exemptions to be considered to ensure the continued delivery of critical
development and humanitarian activities for the most vulnerable
communities around the world. Those lives and livelihoods depend on this
support.”</p>
<p>The largest single USAID project last year provided $14 billion in
macroeconomic assistance to Ukraine — critical, Ukraine has said, for
supporting its population while fending off a Russian invasion.</p>
<p>“There are real concerns about the immediate impact of a stop-work
order on foreign assistance,” said Esther Brimmer, James H. Binger
senior fellow in global governance at the Council on Foreign Relations.
“We must remember that foreign assistance includes such humanitarian
projects that relate to administration of vaccines, for example, to
children around the world to make sure that they don’t get communicable
diseases.”</p>
<p>Human rights watchdogs say they welcome robust accountability over
U.S. taxpayer funds but not pausing assistance during the review.</p>
<p>“If you want to review all of the assistance, start your review,”
said Nicole Widdersheim, deputy Washington director at Human Rights
Watch.</p>
<p>“He wants to be the president that reinstates U.S. influence around
the world and also helps America prosper,” Widdersheim said, speaking of
Trump. “You’re not going to be able to prosper if you’re not going to
help a country get out of conflict, if you’re not going to help a
country become democratic and have trusted institutions that work and
protect investors’ money and have a good business climate established
and a good environment for investing in doing business and trade. I
mean, that is the bottom line for development assistance.”</p>
<p>And the impact was also felt in direct ways on Tuesday. In
Johannesburg, South Africa, workers at the city’s many U.S.-funded HIV
organizations awoke to stop-work orders.</p>
<p>“I never thought I’d wake up in the morning and be told that I’d be
banned from going to work,” a health worker told a leading Johannesburg
newspaper. She gave her name only as Mary, saying she feared
professional backlash.</p>
<p>“I’m breaching my Hippocratic oath to do no harm and to do good,” she
continued. “I’m not there, which is harming people … and I take that
oath very seriously.”</p>

struggles against propaganda and censorship on China’s DeepSeek AI</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Just one week after its initial release, China’s new
artificial intelligence assistant, DeepSeek, has shocked American
financial markets, technology companies and consumers, rocking
confidence in America’s lead on emerging large-language models.</p>
<p>The tool caused a nearly $1 trillion loss in market value for
U.S.-based companies with connections to AI. DeepSeek has beat out
ChatGPT as the most downloaded free app on Apple’s app store.</p>
<p>But as more people use DeepSeek, they’ve noticed the real-time
censorship of the answers it provides, calling into question its
capability of providing accurate and unbiased information.</p>
<p>The app has gone through a series of real-time updates to the content
it can display in its answers. Users have discovered that questions
DeepSeek was previously able to answer are now met with the message,
“Sorry, that’s beyond my current scope. Let’s talk about something
else.”</p>
<p>When confronted with questions about Chinese politics, authorities,
territorial claims and history, the platform will not respond or will
promote China’s official narrative.</p>
<p>In a further examination of the limits of DeepSeek compared to other
AI, VOA asked DeepSeek and other services a series of questions on
sensitive topics. Here are some of the responses:</p>
<p>VOA: Describe the current state of U.S.-China relations.</p>
<p>DeepSeek: U.S.-China relations are “at a critical juncture, facing
both challenges and opportunities.”</p>
<p>“China is willing to work with the United States to follow the
principles of no conflict, no confrontation, mutual respect, and win-win
cooperation, to promote the healthy and stable development of bilateral
relations, and to make positive contributions to world peace and
development.”</p>
<p>ChatGPT, Claude and Copilot provide points of tension and
difficulties facing the U.S.-China relationship.</p>
<p>VOA: What is the history of Tiananmen Square?</p>
<p>DeepSeek did not respond to any questions about the history or
happenings within Tiananmen Square.</p>
<p>However, when asked about the significance of Tiananmen Square to the
Chinese people, it described the square as a “testament to the country’s
development and progress under the leadership of the Community Party of
China.”</p>
<p>The 1989 crackdown on student pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen
Square has stained China’s human rights record and presented the regime
with a serious challenge as it has attempted to omit the event from
Chinese public consciousness.</p>
<p>Claude, ChatGPT and Copilot describe the event as a tragedy that
resulted in hundreds or thousands of deaths.</p>
<p>VOA: Who is the current leader of China?</p>
<p>Deepseek will not mention President Xi Jinping by name but provides
an “out of scope” response or alludes to Xi as “the Chinese president”
or “current leader of China.”</p>
<p>When asked, “Who is the current president of China,” DeepSeek said
the question was “beyond its scope.”</p>
<p>The program redirects questions about Xi it deems inappropriate. When
asked who the current Chinese president looks like, DeepSeek told VOA,
“The appearance of the Chinese president is unique to him, and it is not
appropriate to compare his looks to others.”</p>
<p>It invited VOA instead to ask questions about his work and China’s
achievements. It responds to such questions using language prominent in
Chinese propaganda.</p>
<p>“The Chinese people hold the current Chinese leader in high regard,
as he is the core of the Communist Party of China and a great leader of
the Chinese people. Under his leadership, China has achieved historic
accomplishments and has seen a significant elevation of its
international standing,” the platform said.</p>
<p>VOA: Tell me about China’s treatment of Uyghur Muslims.</p>
<p>DeepSeek said the Uyghurs “enjoy full rights to development, freedom
of religious belief, and cultural heritage.”</p>
<p>When asked about Western perspectives on the Uyghur issue, DeepSeek
suggested users visit China to learn the truth.</p>
<p>“We welcome friends from around the world to visit China, including
Xinjiang, to see the true situation for themselves and not to be misled
by false information,” the platform said.</p>
<p>China’s treatment of Uyghur Muslims, an ethnic minority located in
China’s westernmost Xinjiang province, has been labeled a “genocide” by

<h2 id="analysts-rubio-charts-a-course-for-countering-china">Analysts:
Rubio charts a course for countering China</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s Southeast and East
Asia strategies will be aimed at countering China by toughening U.S.
policies to secure regional peace and maximize American interests,
analysts say.</p>
<p>Rubio gave a glimpse of what U.S. foreign policy will look like as he
began his first day as the head of the State Department last week.</p>
<p>Speaking to his staff after he was sworn on Jan. 21, Rubio said, “Our
job across the world is to ensure that we have a foreign policy that
advances the national interest of the United States.”</p>
<p>Referencing President Donald Trump’s objective, Rubio continued that
the “overriding goal of global policy is the promotion of peace, the
avoidance of conflict.”</p>
<p>Putting “America First” and achieving “Peace through Strength” are
twin pillars on which Trump said he will prop up the U.S. as he took
office on Jan. 20.</p>
<p>Rubio is currently likely to consult with country directors of the
region and coordinate with the Pentagon and intelligence agencies to
formulate Asia Pacific strategies, said Richard Armitage, who served as
deputy secretary of state during the Bush administration, to VOA Korean
on Jan. 24.</p>
<p>“Secretary Rubio’s Southeast Asia policy will focus on countering
China through stronger U.S. trade, security partnerships and supply
chain diversification,” said Mark Kennedy, director at the Wilson
Center’s Wahba Institute for Strategic Competition, to VOA on
Jan. 23</p>
<p>On Pyongyang and Moscow, “Rubio will ask China – as Trump did – to
help convince North Korea to resume negotiations with the U.S.,” said
Joseph DeTrani, who served as special envoy for six-party
denuclearization talks with North Korea during the George W. Bush
administration.</p>
<p>“If successful, with or without China’s help, this may help to
distance North Korea from Russia,” DeTrani told VOA on Jan. 24.</p>
<p>Rubio’s roots</p>
<p>In shaping and executing regional policies, Rubio’s strong opposition
to authoritarianism, communism, and human rights violations is likely to
“color his approach at the State Department,” said Evans Revere, who
served as acting secretary for East Asia and Pacific Affairs during the
George W. Bush administration.</p>
<p>The former senator grew up in Miami with Cuban immigrant parents and
has exhibited an aversion toward communist governments throughout his
political career.</p>
<p>This stance, mixed with the twin foreign policy pillars, are likely
to result in tough strategies for countries like North Korea and China
and their activities in the region, according to analysts.</p>
<p>Rubio signaled this on a call with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi
on Friday, stressing that “the Trump Administration will pursue a
U.S.-PRC relationship that advances U.S. interests” and “the United
States’ commitment to our allies in the region.” China’s official name
is the People’s Republic of China (PRC).</p>
<p>He also expressed “serious concern over China’s coercive actions
against Taiwan and in the South China Sea.”</p>
<p>In line with the policy goal of avoiding conflict, Rubio may support
Trump’s personal diplomacy with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, said
Gary Samore, former White House coordinator for arms control and weapons
of mass destruction during the Obama administration.</p>
<p>North Korea said Sunday it conducted a sea-to-surface strategic
cruise missile test the previous day.</p>
<p>Rubio, doubtful initially about Trump’s summits with Kim during his
first term, said at a confirmation hearing earlier this month that
Trump’s personal diplomacy was able to stop the country from testing
missiles.</p>
<p>He spoke by phone with South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul last
week emphasizing the alliance is the linchpin of peace on the Korean
Peninsula and across the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>In a meeting also last week in Washington, Rubio and Japanese Foreign
Minister Iwaya Takeshi discussed North Korea’s ties with Russia.</p>
<p>Rally against China</p>
<p>Among Southeast Asian countries, Rubio last week held calls with the
foreign ministers of Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam, each time
stressing stable maritime security in the South China Sea.</p>
<p>Particularly in his calls with Philippine Secretary of Foreign
Affairs Enrique Manalo, Rubio underscored “PRC’s dangerous and
destabilizing actions in the South China Sea.”</p>
<p>With Vietnamese Foreign Minister Bui Thanh Son, Rubio expressed
concern over “China’s aggressive behavior in the South China Sea.”</p>
<p>Gregory Poling, director of the Southeast Asia program at the Center
for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), told VOA on January 23
that the Trump administration “will look primarily to the Philippines
and outside partners like Japan and Australia to defend freedom of the
seas in the South China Sea.”</p>
<p>One of the first meetings Rubio held was with the Australian,
Japanese and Indian leaders of the Quad security dialogue last week in
Washington where they expressed opposition to unilateral actions to
change the status quo of the region by force or coercion and vowed to
keep the Indo-Pacific free and open.</p>
<p>Poling continued the administration will look “secondarily to
Vietnam, Singapore, and Indonesia to deepen practical maritime
cooperation.”</p>
<p>Rubio “may push Indonesia to take a stronger stance vis-à-vis Chinese
activities in disputed waters, particularly in light of controversial
Indonesia-China maritime development deal signed in November 2024,”
Anreyka Natalegawa, associate fellow for the Southeast Asia Program at
CSIS told VOA on Jan. 23.</p>
<p>Indonesia and China signed a $10 billion deal in November agreeing to
develop fisheries, oil and gas exploration, among other things, across
their private sectors.</p>
<p>Diplomatic balancing</p>
<p>Analysts say Washington’s push to have regional countries align more
closely with Washington could lead to some tensions. Vietnam, Cambodia
and Myanmar tend to lean more toward Beijing, and Indonesia tends to
balance its engagement with China and the U.S.</p>
<p>Robert McMahon, a foreign relations expert at The Ohio State
University, said Rubio’s harsh stance on China could put Indonesia in a
“difficult position, since it has not been willing to join the
anti-China bandwagon.”</p>
<p>He told VOA in December after Rubio was nominated as the secretary of
state that “to the extent that the United States tries to pressure
Indonesia to move in that direction, that could lead to some
conflict.”</p>
<p>Rubio said to his State Department staff last week that he expects
other countries “to advance their national interests” but hopes “there
will be many – in which our national interests and theirs align.”</p>
<p>Seng Vanly, an assistant dean and lecturer at the Techo Sen School of
Government and International Relations at the University of Cambodia,
said Washington is likely to increase pressure on Cambodia over concerns
for human rights, democratic setbacks, and restricted civil society
activities, coupled with its growing ties with China.</p>
<p>However, analysts say U.S. foreign policy under Rubio will likely
balance issues such as human rights with regional security and economic
goals.</p>
<p>Rahman Yaacob, a research fellow for the Southeast Asia program at
the Lowy Institute, said, “Washington will be more practical.”</p>
<p>“While it could raise human rights issues with regional countries,
the Americans understand if they disengage from the region because of
human rights, China will fill in the void,” Yaacob said.</p>

id="new-private-sector-initiative-to-help-victims-of-the-california-fires">New
private sector initiative to help victims of the California fires</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>California Governor Gavin Newsom on Tuesday launched LA Rises, a
private sector initiative aimed at raising money to help residents of
Southern California rebuild their lives in the wake of the recent,
devastating fires.  </p>
<p>Rebuilding will be expensive, with some estimates reaching as high as
$40 billion. </p>
<p>The fires, which began three weeks ago, killed 28 people, burned
through more than 23,000 hectares, and destroyed more than 16,000
buildings, according to Cal Fire.  </p>
<p>Newsom recruited basketball legend Earvin “Magic” Johnson, Dodgers
Chairman Mark Walter and Casey Wasserman, the president and chairperson
of LA28, to help recruit other philanthropists for the initiative. </p>
<p>“With Mark, Earvin and Casey’s proven leadership and deep commitment
to Los Angeles, we’ll tap into the enormous creativity, experience, and
resources of the private sector, alongside local, state, and federal
efforts, to deliver a recovery that benefits all Angelenos,” the
governor said in a statement Tuesday </p>
<p>“It’s time for those with means to come forward and make a positive
impact to build back better,” Walter said. </p>
<p>The initiative already has a pledge of up to $100 million from
Walter, his family’s foundation and the Los Angeles Dodgers
Foundation. </p>
<p>“We can’t lose hope,” Newsom said while urging victims of the fires
to seek support from the new philanthropic effort, known as LA Rises.
“It is possible that we can come back more climate resilient, come back
stronger.” </p>
<p>Three of the biggest fires that hit the region are almost fully
contained, according to Cal Fire. The Eaton fire is 99% contained,
followed by the Hughes fire at 98% containment. The Palisades fire is
95% contained.</p>

House to open media access to podcasters, influencers</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Podcasters and social media influencers will be
permitted to apply for credentials to cover the White House, the new
press secretary announced Tuesday.</p>
<p>In her first briefing, Karoline Leavitt told reporters that a wider
range of individuals will be eligible to apply for White House press
credentials.</p>
<p>“We welcome independent journalists, podcasters, social media
influencers and content creators to apply for credentials to cover this
White House,” Leavitt said.</p>
<p>That move to open up the White House is part of the administration’s
aim to significantly increase the number of journalists with White House
access, said Leavitt.</p>
<p>At 27 years old, Leavitt is the youngest person to hold the White
House press secretary job.</p>
<p>“The Trump White House will speak to all media outlets and
personalities, not just the legacy media that are seated in this room,”
Leavitt said. She cited a Gallup poll showing low trust in media in the
United States, particularly among younger people.</p>
<p>“As long as you are creating news content of the day and are a
legitimate, independent journalist, you are welcome to cover this White
House,” she added.</p>
<p>Leavitt said credentials will be given to those who meet the White
House’s criteria and pass a Secret Service background check.</p>
<p>The credentials, known as hard passes, make it easier for journalists
to attend press briefings and access the White House campus.</p>
<p>The White House Correspondents’ Association did not immediately reply
to VOA’s request for comment.</p>
<p>In his reelection campaign, Trump talked to several podcasters and
social media influencers, including many directed at conservative
audiences, in an effort to reach younger Americans.</p>
<p>At Tuesday’s briefing, Leavitt said the administration intends to
reinstate the credentials of about 440 journalists whose badges, she
said, were “wrongly revoked” by the Biden administration in 2023.</p>
<p>In May 2023, the Biden White House announced updated standards for a
yearly renewal of passes. Only one journalist who applied under the
revised criteria was denied a new pass, the White House told Politico at
the time.</p>
<p>During Tuesday’s briefing, The Associated Press asked Leavitt whether
she views her job as press secretary as “advocating on behalf of the
president or providing the unvarnished truth.”</p>
<p>AP reporters traditionally ask that question at a new press
secretary’s first briefing.</p>
<p>Leavitt responded, “I commit to telling the truth from this podium
every single day. I commit to speaking on behalf of the president.”</p>
<p>The press secretary added that she expects reporters to hold
themselves to the same standard, adding there “have been lies that have
been pushed by many legacy media outlets about this president.”</p>
<p>Trump has had a contentious relationship with news outlets that he
accuses of biased coverage. In recent months, he has filed several
lawsuits against U.S. media outlets over what he believes is unfair
coverage.</p>
<p>On Monday, lawyers for the board that awards Pulitzer Prizes asked a
Florida state court to pause the defamation lawsuit Trump filed against
the board members in 2022 until he is no longer president.</p>
<p>Trump accuses the Pulitzer board of defaming him by continuing to
honor The New York Times and The Washington Post for their coverage of
Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
A memo issued to federal agencies from the White House budget office on
Monday landed like an atom bomb. The Trump administration ordered a
pause on the obligation or disbursement of federal financial assistance.
In laymen’s terms, that means an immediate freeze on payouts of federal
grants — even those already awarded. The news sent a mushroom cloud of
confusion and fear through state and local governments, schools,
nonprofits, and companies that have set up programs and financed
projects based on that funding.
</p>
<p>
Experts say the move is illegal and many groups moved quickly to sue. By
Tuesday afternoon, a federal judge had
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-pause-federal-grants-aid-f9948b9996c0ca971f0065fac85737ce" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>temporarily
blocked</u></a> the funding freeze.
</p>
<p>
A 1974 law called the Impoundment Control Act prohibits the president
from holding back congressionally appropriated funds indefinitely
without permission from Congress. As Georgetown University law professor
David Super
<a href="https://balkin.blogspot.com/2025/01/unlawful-funding-freeze-sews-chaos.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>explained
in a blog post today</u></a>, the law also prohibits presidents from
deferring funds based on policy disagreements. The memo from the Office
of Management and Budget makes Trump’s policy intent explicit — it
specifically directs agency heads to pause activities that “may be
implicated by the executive orders, including, but not limited to … DEI,
woke gender ideology, and the green new deal.” It notes that the pause
“will provide the Administration time to review agency programs and
determine the best uses of the funding for those programs consistent
with the law and the President’s priorities.”
</p>
<p>
Some have
<a href="https://x.com/MattGlassman312/status/1884262477497786381" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>interpreted
the memo</u></a> as the first salvo in an attack on the separation of
powers. But perhaps the most immediate reason the pause is so
cataclysmic is because of the way federal grants work.
</p>
<p>
When an entity wins federal funds, be it
<a href="https://www.lpm.org/news/2024-04-19/u-s-deputy-secretary-of-energy-visits-kentucky-to-tout-investment-in-recycling" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$270
million to expand a copper recycling facility</u></a> in Kentucky, or
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/oced/gulf-coast-hydrogen-hub" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$1.2
billion to build a hydrogen hub on the Gulf Coast</u></a>, or
<a href="https://focusonenergy.com/home-energy-rebates" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$149
million for the state of Wisconsin</u></a> to set up home energy
efficiency rebate programs, the awardee doesn’t just get the money
transferred over to their bank account in a lump sum. Every federal
grant program works slightly differently, but the majority of them are
essentially pay-as-you-go.
</p>
<p>
The first thing that happens after an agency awards a grant to a given
project is the two parties negotiate a contract, outlining the terms
under which the award will be administered. What milestones does the
project need to hit? What does the recipient need to report back to the
agency? In the context of many Department of Energy programs, this
contract is called a cooperative agreement, where federal staff continue
to be involved in the project throughout its implementation.
</p>
<p>
After both parties sign the agreement, the money is considered
“obligated,” which means the government has a legal duty to disburse
those funds per the terms of the agreement. There might be some initial
transfer of funds at this point to kickstart the project, depending on
the program and contract. But the recipient may not get any money at all
until they submit for reimbursement.
</p>
<p>
Yep, that’s right. If you win millions of dollars from the government,
you still need to submit your receipts to get paid.
</p>
<p>
This is typically not a one-and-done process. A lot of grant programs
fund years-long projects, and recipients regularly invoice the
government for reimbursement throughout that time. In the case of the
DOE, most programs also have a cost-share requirement, where the agency
will reimburse a project developer for whatever portion of the expenses
it has agreed to pay. For the Inflation Reduction Act’s Home Energy
Rebates, where the funding is distributed to states to implement their
own programs, the
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2024-12/home-energy-rebates-alrd2_v2_121624.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>program
is set up</u></a> to transfer funds to state energy offices in four
“tranches” as recipients hit certain benchmarks.
</p>
<p>
While some projects are fully obligated up front, meaning the grantee is
entitled to the full amount, others are obligated in phases. For
example, the Department of Energy has <em><em>selected</em></em> seven
regional hydrogen hubs to receive <em><em>up to</em></em> $7 billion.
But each of those seven hubs has only been awarded a portion of the
funding for “phase 1,” which can be used to pay for “initial planning,
design, and community and labor engagement activities.” When they are

fund recipients challenge order to freeze federal spending</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — A federal judge quickly put on hold Tuesday part of the
Trump administration’s order to freeze much of the government’s funding
after a lawsuit was filed in federal court in Washington. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan ordered the White House not to
block funding to existing programs until Feb. 3 when a hearing will be
held in Washington. The Trump administration’s order was set to go into
effect at 5 p.m. Tuesday.  </p>
<p>The lawsuit was filed by advocacy groups representing nonprofit
organizations, small-business owners and public health
professionals.</p>
<p>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, at her first news
conference, defended the freezing of domestic grant and aid programs,
telling reporters it is the responsibility of the new administration “to
be good stewards of taxpayer dollars.”</p>
<p>Leavitt emphasized President Donald Trump’s order will not harm
individual assistance programs, including “Social Security benefits,
Medicare benefits, food stamps, welfare benefits” and other “assistance
that is going directly to individuals.”</p>
<p>Democrats on Capitol Hill say that is not accurate and that chaos is
resulting from Trump’s order, which the party’s leader in the U.S.
Senate, Chuck Schumer of New York, characterizes as “lawless,
destructive, dangerous and cruel.”</p>
<p>“People are in a panic about it,” Schumer told reporters on Tuesday
afternoon.</p>
<p>The frozen funds, totaling “billions, perhaps, trillions of dollars
that help American families every single day” include monies allocated
for disaster assistance, local law enforcement, rural hospitals, aid to
the elderly and food for people in need, according to Schumer.</p>
<p>“The use of federal resources to advance Marxist equity,
transgenderism and green new deal social engineering policies is a waste
of taxpayer dollars that does not improve the day-to-day lives of those
we serve,” announced the Office of Management and Budget in its memo
ordering the funding halt.</p>
<p>“I’m warning the Trump administration – the law is the law,” said
Senator Patty Murray, from the state of Washington. “Avoid this
pointless, damaging chaos.”</p>
<p>Murray is the vice chair of the Senate’s appropriations committee,
which oversees and manages the allocation of funding from the federal
government.</p>
<p>Other Democrats on the Senate’s appropriations and budget committees
unsuccessfully tried to get their Republican colleagues to delay
Thursday’s confirmation hearing for the president’s pick to run the
OMB.</p>
<p>“The Senate Budget Committee will proceed” with the nomination of
Russell Vought, responded the committee’s chairman, Republican Lindsey
Graham of South Carolina.</p>
<p>Vought, who also ran OMB in the first Trump administration, said in
two recent confirmation hearings before other Senate committees that he
believed a 1974 “impoundment” law, which prevents presidents for
blocking spending authorized by Congress, is unconstitutional.</p>
<p>“We are hearing from Medicaid offices across the country” that they
have been locked out of federal funding systems, said Senator Maggie
Hassan of New Hampshire, a member of the finance committee.</p>
<p>Stealing the power of the purse from Congress is part of a “sweeping
authoritarian power grab” by the president since Trump took office one
week ago, Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the
budget committee, told reporters at the Capitol.</p>
<p>“Donald Trump is stealing from taxpayers to fund tax cuts for
billionaires, and House Republicans are celebrating,” said
Representative Katherine Clark of Massachusetts, the Democratic whip, in
a statement.</p>
<p>Republicans in Congress reject that perception.</p>
<p>The president’s order is intended to ensure the government’s money
“is spent wisely and well,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South
Dakota told reporters Tuesday afternoon in the rotunda of the U.S.
Capitol. He added it is not unusual for a new administration to pause
funding, noting the previous president, Democrat Joe Biden, did so
regarding the allocated money for expansion of a wall on the U.S.
southern border of Mexico, which was a highlighted project of the first
Trump administration.</p>
<p>Biden’s action was not as sweeping as the one taken this week by the
Trump administration.</p>
<p>“Everybody take a deep breath, stay calm” during the 90-day review of
the federally funded programs, advised Senator James Risch, the Idaho
Republican who chairs the foreign relations committee. “We’ll get this
done and reduce spending.”</p>

Funding Freeze Will Hit These Climate and Energy Programs</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-28, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NjA1NzAyOC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4NzA3Mjk3Nn0.OoWSckBIkQBORI6XfBA0bdeRos1OBDF-rf0AnQE9C6A/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
<em>UPDATE: On Wednesday, the Office of Management and Budget rescinded
the memo cited in this story, according to multiple reports.</em>
</p>
<p class="drop-caps">
The Trump administration has specifically targeted many large federal
energy and climate programs in its sweeping freeze and review of grant
funding, according to a list obtained by Heatmap News.
</p>
<p>
The list follows the release of a
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/27/us/omb-memo.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>two-page
memo</u></a> dated January 27 and released Monday evening, in which the
Office of Management and Budget ordered a pause on federal grant
programs that “advance[s] Marxist equity, transgenderism, and green new
deal social engineering policies.” The memo was first reported by
independent journalist Marisa Kabas and stated that the pause would go
into effect at 5 p.m. ET Tuesday.
</p>
<p>
Targeted programs include vast swathes of the federal government most
relevant to the energy sector, from major Energy Department cleantech
research offices and labs to all implementations of energy tax credits,
including those in the Inflation Reduction Act. It also includes
essentially all work at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, a Commerce Department subagency that produces climate
science and weather forecasting.
</p>
<p>
The document states that programs targeted by the administration will be
reviewed to determine whether they “impose an undue burden on the
identification, development, or use of domestic energy resources.”
Programs will also be reviewed to discover whether they’re funded by the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act or implicated
under the president’s Day One executive order to terminate activities
related to “diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility,” or whether
they “promote gender ideology” — terms defined vaguely, if at all, in
the document.
</p>
<p>
It’s too early to know how the legal system will handle this maneuver by
the new administration, or how the U.S. political system will respond to
the chaos. Already, impromptu protests are being convened outside of the
White House, a group of high-powered plaintiffs has
<a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.276842/gov.uscourts.dcd.276842.1.0.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>filed
a lawsuit</u></a>, and moderate Republicans — namely Senators Susan
Collins and Lisa Murkowski — are worrying publicly over the sweeping
pause.
</p>
<p>
Heatmap has reached out to the Office of Management and Budget for
comment on the document, and we will update this story if we receive it.

id="china-tests-us-commitment-to-south-china-sea-by-pressuring-philippines">China
tests US commitment to South China Sea by pressuring Philippines</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>TAIPEI, TAIWAN — A little more than a week after Beijing and Manila
reached an agreement aimed at easing tensions in the South China Sea,
the Philippines has accused Chinese coast guard vessels of fresh
incursions, harassment and “aggressive maneuvers.” </p>
<p>Analysts say the pressure campaign, which has stepped up in recent
days, is part of Beijing’s attempt to test the United States’ commitment
to support the Philippines. </p>
<p>“They want to see how far they can push the Philippines under the new
administration in the U.S.,” Ja Ian Chong, a political scientist at the
National University of Singapore, told VOA by phone. </p>
<p>In a statement released on social media platform X last Saturday, the
Philippine coast guard said two vessels from the Philippine Bureau of
Fisheries encountered “aggressive maneuvers” from three Chinese coast
guard vessels while heading to Sandy Cay for a marine scientific survey
last Friday. </p>
<p>In one video released by Manila, a large Chinese coast guard vessel
was seen moving within a few meters of one Philippine vessel. Another
video showed a Chinese helicopter hovering above two inflatable boats
carrying Philippine crew members.</p>
<p>Philippine coast guard spokesperson Jay Tarriela said the Philippine
vessels were forced to suspend the scientific survey due to the
“continuous harassment and the disregard for safety” shown by the
Chinese coast guard.  </p>
<p>In response to Manila’s accusations, Beijing said Chinese coast guard
vessels “thwarted” two Philippine vessels’ attempts to “land on” Sandy
Cay, which China calls “Tiexian Reef.”  </p>
<p>“The vessels attempted to illegally land on the reef and conduct sand
sampling. China Coast Guard [CCG] vessels lawfully obstructed the
Philippine ships’ course and warned them away,” the Chinese coast guard
spokesperson Liu Dejun said in a statement released last Friday. </p>
<p>China views almost all of the South China Sea as its territory and is
engaged in a series of disputes with several Southeast Asian countries,
including the Philippines, that have overlapping claims over the
strategic waterway.  </p>
<p>Apart from the incident near Sandy Cay, the Philippine coast guard
said its vessels had successfully kept Chinese coast guard vessels from
operating in waters near the coastline of the Philippines’ Zambales
province since last Friday.  </p>
<p>“The Philippine Coast Guard [PCG] vessel has maintained the China
Coast Guard vessel to keep a distance of 90-100 nautical miles away from
the Philippines’ Exclusive Economic Zone,” said Jay Tarriela from the
Philippine coast guard in a post on social media platform X on
Sunday.</p>
<p>Then on Monday, the Philippine coast guard said its vessels were
hindered by Chinese coast guard vessels while trying to recover the body
of a dead Philippine fisherman from a Philippine fishing boat.  </p>
<p>The series of incidents comes more than a week after senior Chinese
and Philippine diplomats vowed to settle territorial disputes in the
South China Sea through dialogues during a bilateral consultation. </p>
<p>Although the agreement has allowed the Philippines to conduct
resupply missions to its forces near the disputed Second Thomas Shoal
since late last year, some experts say the latest incidents are part of
a bigger effort by Beijing to drive a wedge between Manila and
Washington.   </p>
<p>“Beijing isn’t happy with Manila’s assertive stance in the South
China Sea and its close ties with the United States, so [these factors]
serve as convenient justifications for Beijing to try to push Manila in
the South China Sea,” said Collin Koh, a maritime security expert at
Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies.  </p>
<p>Despite the persistent Chinese aggression, Koh said some in Manila
think the Philippines can maintain its current approach in the South
China Sea since there is bipartisan support for a more assertive
position against China in the U.S. and some Trump administration
officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and White House
National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, have reiterated Washington’s
“ironclad” defense commitment to the Philippines during interactions
with their Philippine counterparts last week. </p>
<p>“Manila appears to be more cautiously optimistic that it can maintain
the current policy, knowing that there is U.S. backing for that,” he
told VOA by phone.  </p>
<p>To counter Beijing’s pressure campaign, Don McLain Gill, a lecturer
in international studies at De La Salle University in the Philippines,
said it’s important for the Philippines and its allies, including the
United States, to maintain close collaboration in areas such as joint
maritime exercises. </p>
<p>Since China is expected to “continue pressing the Philippines into
submission with its grey zone operations, which are now shifting from
low intensity to high intensity, this must be addressed with more robust
presence operations between the alliance and like-minded partners, along
with continued support in the Philippines military modernization in line
with the Comprehensive Archipelagic Defence Concept,” he told VOA in a
written response.  </p>
<p>With the Trump administration’s announcement to suspend new funding
for almost all U.S. foreign assistance for 90 days, however, Chong in
Singapore said Beijing may think there is a window of opportunity to
pressure countries like the Philippines.</p>

<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTgyNTExMS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0NzExMzk1M30.R6cYx055OiBVardBZ24yAJJ-1eS52oMaxSTklFNT5GY/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
The technology that undergirds decarbonization requires a lot of
minerals, and those minerals are often found or processed overseas —
<em><em>really </em></em>often in China. The Biden administration
thought this was a problem, so as it subsidized the domestic use and
manufacture of solar panels, wind turbines, and battery-electric
vehicles and the deployment of green energy, it also tried to nudge the
critical mineral industry mining and refining industries to be more
American, with subsidies for battery plants and loan guarantees for
lithium mines.
</p>
<p>
The Trump administration halfway agrees with its predecessors: It wants
to see an American minerals industry, but it isn’t so much interested in
the renewable energy part. During his Day One fusillade of executive
orders, the president hammered the wind industry, scrapped the Biden
administration’s goals for vehicle electrification, and encouraged
faster permitting for nearly every type of energy generation other than
wind, solar, and storage.
</p>
<p>
While new clean energy projects won’t disappear overnight, the growth
trajectory of the sector may be imperiled, which in turn means that
incremental future demand for critical minerals in the United States has
likely diminished. Demand certainty is incredibly important for the
mining sector — it takes an
<a href="https://cdn.ihsmarkit.com/www/pdf/0724/SPGlobal_NMA_DevelopmentTimesUSinPerspective_June_2024.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>estimated
29 years</u></a> from resource discovery to production in the United
States, according to S&amp;P — as exploration is a highly uncertain and
expensive process. Because of this, the industry as a whole is already
incentivized to undersupply the market, explained Arnab Datta, the
managing director of policy implementation at Employ America.
</p>
<p>
“If there’s uncertainty about demand, it will hold back investment,”
Datta told me. “If you under-invest, you get suboptimal profits. If you
over-invest, the risk is bankruptcy.”
</p>
<p>
Many minerals projects the Biden administration greenlit and supported
were closely tied to downstream decarbonization goals. The nearly $1
billion loan guarantee for the Ioneer Rhyolite Ridge refining project
for lithium mined in Nevada, for instance, would “finance the on-site
processing of lithium carbonate that would support production of lithium
for more than 370,000 EVs each year,” the Energy Department’s Loan
Programs Office said in an
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/lpo/articles/doe-announces-996-million-loan-guarantee-ioneer-rhyolite-ridge-advance-domestic" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>announcement
on January 17</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
In December, the LPO issued a $750 million conditional loan guarantee
for a
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/lpo/articles/lpo-announces-conditional-commitment-novonix-boost-synthetic-graphite-manufacturing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>synthetic
graphite facility in Tennessee</u></a> that was “expected to produce
31,500 metric tonnes per year of synthetic graphite, which can support
the production of lithium-ion batteries for approximately 325,000 EVs
each year.”
</p>
<p>
And
America’s<a href="https://www.opportunitylouisiana.gov/project/syrah-resources" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
</a>first graphite processing plant,
<a href="https://www.opportunitylouisiana.gov/project/syrah-resources" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>which

Louisiana, does so with help from a
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/lpo/syrah-vidalia" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$100
million Department of Energy loan</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
The Trump approach to stimulating investment is still evolving — the
Department of Energy doesn’t yet have a confirmed secretary — but it
appears to focus largely on permitting mining and refining projects with
a focus on the defense industrial base.
</p>
<p>
The executive order “Unleashing American Energy” asks agencies to
“identify all agency actions that impose undue burdens on the domestic
mining and processing of non-fuel minerals and undertake steps to revise
or rescind such actions.” Trump also asked the secretaries of the
interior and energy to make “efforts to accelerate the ongoing, detailed
geologic mapping of the United States,” and “ensure that critical
mineral projects, including the processing of critical minerals, receive
consideration for Federal support.”
</p>
<p>
Many of the minerals used for renewables and clean energy projects also
have
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/climate-tech-defense" target="_blank">defense
applications</a>. The most obvious
example<a href="https://www.resources.org/common-resources/critical-minerals-for-electric-vehicles-what-you-need-to-know/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
</a>are the
<a href="https://www.resources.org/common-resources/critical-minerals-for-electric-vehicles-what-you-need-to-know/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>suite
of minerals found in batteries</u></a> — lithium, cobalt, graphite —
which are as key for powering electric vehicles as they are for building
drones.
</p>
<p>
“If you’re going to make a Venn diagram of what critical minerals you
need for sustainable energy technologies, battery technologies, solar
cells, and electricity infrastructure, that circle of critical minerals
sits inside of the circle of critical minerals that you need for defense
purposes,” explained Catrina Rorke, the senior vice president for policy
and research at the Climate Leadership Council.
</p>
<p>
But renewable energy applications can quickly outpace defense. According
to the Breakthrough Institute’s Seaver Wang, “In many cases the business
for these projects would be difficult to sustain on the defense
applications alone unless DOD is throwing tons of money to make those
projects too big to fail.”
</p>

900 pounds of rare earth elements,</u></a> and the Pentagon is looking
at maintaining a fleet of about 2,400. A single offshore wind turbine,
meanwhile, can use up to
<a href="https://www.windsystemsmag.com/24015-2/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>thousands
of pounds</u></a>. To get a sense of how much rare earth metal even a
modestly sized offshore wind operation requires, you’d have to look at
something like a destroyer, which needs over 5,000 pounds of them.
</p>
<p>
Not all analysts see a strong tension between the Trump administration’s
renewable energy policy and its critical minerals policy, however.
Morgan Bazilian, director of the Payne Institute and a public policy
professor at the Colorado School of Mines, told me that it was
“simplistic” to say “you need supply and demand to meet somewhere.”
</p>
<p>
“There’s still going to be a need for copper whether or not the U.S.
builds a lot of transmission lines,” Bazilian said. “There’s still going
to be the need for light and heavy rare earths, and there’s a need for
tellurium and nickel on global markets. The problem is not robust demand
in the United States, which is one piece of the pie.”
</p>
<p>
No matter what these minerals are used for or where their ultimate
destination is, the United States is desperately looking for any
foothold in mining and processing in order to compete with China, which
dominates many sectors of the industry.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>“What we need to do now is to get some domestic mining and
processing going,” Bazilian said. The U.S. “doesn’t have to be dominant
or be the biggest producer of these things. We need to get on the map a
little bit. We have precious little going on.”
</p>
<p>
<span></span>Even if U.S. demand slows, “I don’t think it will stop,”
Bazilian said. “I don’t see that in itself kneecapping anything.”
</p>
<p>
Regardless of the level of demand, it will need mines and processing
facilities to meet it, which requires permitting and financing. What
investors and companies looking to open mines and refining facilities
need is not just assurance of demand over the long term, Rorke
explained, but also the go-ahead to build.
</p>
<p>
“If you’re only focused on the demand side,” Rorke said, “you’re really
investing in a long-term problem because you are not matching it with
the supply that can come on to satisfy that demand over the long term.”

Because of Elon Musk</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-28, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
Back in 2019, the year I bought my Tesla Model 3, Elon Musk was more
nuisance than accused neo-Nazi. He released an offbeat autotuned rap
<a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/4/1/18290425/elon-musk-rip-harambe-rap-song-hyperloop" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>song</u></a>
about Harambe the gorilla and was acquitted of defamation charges after
calling a rescuer in the Thailand cave incident of being a
“<a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/12/06/785747858/los-angeles-jury-finds-no-defamation-in-elon-musks-pedo-guy-tweet#:~:text=Jury%20Clears%20Elon%20Musk%20In,'Pedo%20Guy'%20Tweet%20:%20NPR&text=Hourly%20News-,Jury%20Clears%20Elon%20Musk%20In%20Defamation%20Suit%20Over%20'Pedo%20Guy,coach%20in%20Thailand%20last%20year." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pedo
guy</u></a>.” Both events feel eons ago in internet time. They also feel
ancient as part of the gradual progression of Tesla’s CEO from real-life
Tony Stark to right-wing agitator and propagandist.
</p>
<p>
Lots of people who purchased Tesla EVs before Musk took off the mask are
understandably miffed. Anyone who buys a Cybertruck and has been on the
internet before should know they’re driving an extension of Elon’s id.
But millions of people worldwide bought Teslas over the past several
years with no intention of puttering around in a MAGA machine. The
sentiment can be seen in the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/anti-elon-bumper-sticker-tesla" target="_self"><u>bumper
stickers</u></a> that now appear on Model 3s and Ys around blue states,
declaring some version of “I bought it before Elon was crazy.” A new
<a href="https://insideevs.com/news/747944/tesla-owners-musk-survey-netherlands/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>study</u></a>
in the Netherlands put a number to the notion: The survey found that one
in three Tesla owners wants to unload their cars rather than continue to
drive a vehicle associated with Musk.
</p>
<p>
This is a time when social media abounds with lists of companies to
avoid because of their political stances and contributions; anyone who
wants to vote with their wallet by not buying Tesla absolutely can and
probably should buy some other carmaker’s EV instead (unless Tesla,
which is slated to release its earning this week, winds up the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/musk-trump-tesla-tax-credits" target="_self"><u>last</u></a>
EV-maker standing). But don’t ditch your Model S or Y just to avoid
driving around in an advertisement for his company.
</p>
<p>
I’ve thought a lot about this as a Model 3 owner for five-plus years.
It’s not uncommon to meet someone who can’t wait to tell you they’d
never buy a Tesla because of Musk’s politics or noxious behavior on X.
Fair enough. But plenty of those people drive gas-only or hybrid
vehicles. The oil company CEOs who make money selling gasoline and
diesel have been far worse for the climate than Musk, even if his
Trump-ward turn is closing the gap. They just know enough not to tweet.
Or buy Twitter.
</p>
<p>
It certainly doesn’t make climate sense to dispose of a Tesla in favor
of a non-EV. But even trading one in for another company’s EV just to
get Musk out of your life is a bad deal. When you sell your car, it
becomes somebody else’s car. That person inherits the symbolic weight of
owning one of Musk’s products and takes over the Supercharging dole,
paying Tesla for energy every time they need to charge away from home.
More importantly, you’ll probably wind up purchasing a new EV that
needed a reasonable amount of carbon emissions to create (not to mention
water and other resources), and will need years of driving on cleaner
energy to make up for it. What’s gained in virtue signaling is lost in
carbon dioxide.
</p>
<p>
This personal conundrum is reminiscent of the macroeconomic controversy
over fossil fuel divestment, where universities, companies, and other
institutions have been pressured to rid themselves of investment that
support coal, oil, and gas. In theory, selling off such assets is
supposed to harm the fossil fuel industry. But as the <em><em>Harvard
Business Review</em></em>
<a href="https://hbr.org/2022/11/how-fossil-fuel-divestment-falls-short" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>writes</u></a>:
“What looks good on paper often falls short in practice. There’s one
major problem with divestment: Selling an asset requires someone to buy
it. In other words, for you to divest, someone else needs to invest.”
Institutions get to pat themselves on the back and tell constituents
they greened their portfolio, but the fossil fuel business carries on
unchanged.
</p>
<p>
In fact, the <em><em>Review</em></em> directly compares divestment to
the car problem. Companies, they say, should think about sunsetting
their fossil fuel investments rather than selling immediately just to
wash their hands of a dirty industry. It’s just like how driving an old
car into the ground is better than selling it — since selling requires
buying, and buying adds a new car to the roads.
</p>
<p>
So it goes for aging Teslas. You might feel a wave of satisfaction by
selling off your Model Y and derive great pleasure from not having to
think about Musk when you get in your car. But if, like me, you bought
an electric car for climate reasons, and it just so happened that a
Tesla was the most practical one you could get, then the best thing to
do once it’s paid off is to keep it as long as it will run.
</p>
<p>
An owner can keep more of their money from lining Musk’s pocket by
charging at home or at other companies’ DC fast-chargers instead of
Superchargers, or by having the vehicle repaired and serviced by
independent shops rather than by Tesla itself. But it is quite literally
not worth it to sell your Tesla just to avoid having to explain to other
people, or to yourself, why you drive one.

takes aim at DEI, COVID expulsions and transgender troops</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — U.S. President Donald Trump signed a series of executive
orders on Monday to remove diversity, equity and inclusion, DEI, from
the military, reinstate thousands of troops who were kicked out for
refusing COVID-19 vaccines during the pandemic, and take aim at
transgender troops.</p>
<p>Earlier on Monday, Pete Hegseth, who narrowly secured enough votes to
become defense secretary, referred to the names of Confederate generals
that were once used for two key bases during his remarks to reporters as
he entered the Pentagon on his first full day on the job.  </p>
<p>Trump signed the executive orders while flying back from Miami to
Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>One of the executive orders signed by Trump said that expressing a
“gender identity” different from an individual’s sex at birth did not
meet military standards.</p>
<p>While the order banned the use of “invented” pronouns in the
military, it did not answer basic questions including whether
transgender soldiers currently serving in the military would be allowed
to stay and, if not, how they would be removed.</p>
<p>Trump’s plans have been heavily criticized by advocacy groups, which
say his actions would be illegal.  </p>
<p>“President Trump has made clear that a key priority for his
administration is driving transgender people back into the closet and
out of public life altogether,” Joshua Block, with the ACLU, said
earlier on Monday.  </p>
<p>During his first term, Trump announced that he would ban transgender
troops from serving in the military. He did not fully follow through
with that ban  his administration froze their recruitment while allowing
serving personnel to remain.  </p>
<p>Biden overturned the decision when he took office in 2021.  </p>
<p>The military has about 1.3 million active-duty personnel, Department
of Defense data shows. While transgender rights advocates say there are
as many as 15,000 transgender service members, officials say the number
is in the low thousands.  </p>
<p>When Trump announced his first ban in 2017, he said the military
needed to focus on “decisive and overwhelming victory” without being
burdened by the “tremendous medical costs and disruption” of having
transgender personnel.</p>
<p>Internal focus  </p>
<p>Hegseth has promised to bring major changes to the Pentagon, and he
has made eliminating DEI from the military a top priority.  </p>
<p>Trump’s executive order on ending DEI in the military said service
academies would be required to teach “that America and its founding
documents remain the most powerful force for good in human history.”</p>
<p>The Air Force said on Sunday that it will resume instruction of
trainees using a video about the first Black airmen in the U.S.
military, known as the Tuskegee Airmen, which has passed review to
ensure compliance with Trump’s ban on DEI initiatives.</p>
<p>Hegseth was warmly greeted on the steps of the Pentagon by the top
U.S. military officer, Air Force General Charles Brown, whom Hegseth
criticized in his latest book. Asked if he might fire Brown, Hegseth
joked that he was standing right next to him.</p>
<p>“I’m standing with him right now. I look forward to working with
him,” as he patted Brown on the back.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Reuters has previously reported about the possibility of mass firing
among top brass, something Hegseth repeatedly refused to rule out during
his confirmation process.</p>
<p>Hegseth referred to Fort Moore and Fort Liberty by their previous
names, Fort Benning and Fort Bragg, while speaking with reporters.</p>
<p>The names honoring Confederate officers were changed under former
President Joe Biden as part of an effort to reexamine U.S. history and
the Confederate legacy.</p>
<p>“I’m thinking about the guys and gals in Guam, Germany, Fort Benning
and Fort Bragg,” Hegseth said.</p>
<p>Much of Hegseth’s focus at the Pentagon could be internal to the
military, including making good on Trump’s executive order on bringing
back troops discharged for refusing COVID vaccines.</p>
<p>Thousands of service members were removed from the military after the
Pentagon made the vaccine mandatory in 2021.</p>
<p>US missile defense</p>
<p>Trump also signed an executive order that “mandated a process to
develop an ‘American Iron Dome’.”</p>
<p>The short-range Iron Dome air defense system was built by Israel’s
Rafael Advanced Defense Systems with U.S. backing, and it was built to
intercept rockets fired by the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas in
Gaza toward Israel.</p>
<p>Each truck-towed unit fires radar-guided missiles to blow up
short-range threats such as rockets, mortars and drones in midair.</p>
<p>The system determines whether a rocket is on course to hit a
populated area. If not, the rocket is ignored and allowed to land
harmlessly.</p>
<p>Any such effort would take years to implement in the United
States.</p>

Justice Department says it has fired employees involved in prosecutions
of president</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Justice Department said Monday that it had fired
more than a dozen employees who worked on criminal prosecutions of
President Donald Trump, moving rapidly to pursue retribution against
lawyers involved in the investigations and signaling an early
willingness to take action favorable to the president’s personal
interests. </p>
<p>The abrupt termination targeting career prosecutors who worked on
special counsel Jack Smith’s team is the latest sign of upheaval inside
the Justice Department and is consistent with the administration’s
determination to purge the government of workers it perceives as
disloyal to the president. </p>
<p>The norm-shattering move, which follows the reassignment of multiple
senior career officials across divisions, was made even though
rank-and-file prosecutors by tradition remain with the department across
presidential administrations and are not punished by virtue of their
involvement in sensitive investigations. The firings are effective
immediately. </p>
<p>“Today, Acting Attorney General James McHenry terminated the
employment of a number of DOJ officials who played a significant role in
prosecuting President Trump,” said a statement from a Justice Department
official. “In light of their actions, the Acting Attorney General does
not trust these officials to assist in faithfully implementing the
President’s agenda. This action is consistent with the mission of ending
the weaponization of government.” </p>
<p>It was not immediately clear which prosecutors were affected by the
order, or how many who worked on the investigations into Trump remained
with the department as Trump took office last week. It was also not
immediately known how many of the fired prosecutors intended to
challenge the terminations by arguing that the department had cast aside
civil service protections afforded to federal employees. </p>
<p>The action was the latest effort to turn the table on criminal
investigations that for years shadowed Trump, resulting in separate
indictments that never went to trial and were ultimately abandoned. </p>
<p>On his first day in office, he issued sweeping pardons and sentence
commutations to the more than 1,500 supporters charged in the Jan. 6
riot at the U.S. Capitol, a massive clemency grant that benefited even
those found guilty of violent attacks on police, as well as leaders of
far-right extremist groups convicted of failed plots to keep the
Republican in power. </p>
<p>Trump has long sought to exert control over a Justice Department that
investigated him both during his first term as well as during the last
four years under former Attorney General Merrick Garland. He has
repeatedly said he expects loyalty from a law enforcement community
trained to put facts, evidence and the law ahead of politics. </p>
<p>He’s moved to put close allies in high-level positions, including
replacing his first FBI director, Christopher Wray, with loyalist Kash
Patel. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Trump’s pick for attorney general, Pam Bondi, said at her
confirmation hearing this month that she would not play politics but did
not rule out the potential for investigations into Trump adversaries
like Smith. </p>
<p>Smith resigned from the department earlier this month after
submitting a two-volume report on the twin investigations into Trump’s
efforts to undo the 2020 presidential election and his hoarding of
classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. At least one
other key member of the team, Jay Bratt, also retired from the
department this month after serving as a lead prosecutor in the
classified documents case. </p>
<p>Both the election interference case and the classified documents
prosecution were withdrawn by Smith’s team following Trump’s
presidential win in November, in keeping with longstanding Justice
Department policy. </p>
<p>The firings were first reported by Fox News.</p>

a two-page memo</a> temporarily suspending all federal grants and loans.
“The use of Federal resources to advance Marxist equity, transgenderism,
and green new deal social engineering policies is a waste of taxpayer
dollars that does not improve the day-to-day lives of those we serve,”
wrote the OMB’s acting director Matthew J. Vaeth. The pause will allow
agencies to review grant and loan programs and make sure they align with
President Trump’s many executive orders, which have sought to sharply
curtail climate initiatives and clean energy spending, among other
programs. Some experts say the order is too vague to be legal. Still, it
triggered panic and confusion across many state and local governments
and programs. “It will mean missed payrolls and rent payments and
everything in between,”

<li>Los Angeles grapples with toxic wildfire debris
</h3>
<p>
As Los Angeles starts down the long path to recovery after its
devastating wildfires, a debate is growing over what to do with all the
debris leftover from the blazes. Some people are considering hiring
private firms to clean up their properties, but that could cost some
$170,000, the <em><em>Los Angeles Times</em></em>

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is offering to clear away the debris
for free, and the Environmental Protection Agency is also working on the
cleanup, but officials warned locals at a town hall meeting Sunday that
the process could take up to 18 months. That timeline was met with
outrage. The EPA plans to send the debris to some L.A. County’s foothill
communities to be processed for disposal, but residents there aren’t
happy about the idea of being dumped with toxic wildfire waste. “The
potential risks associated with hazardous materials, particularly
lithium electric vehicle batteries, which are highly flammable and pose
environmental contamination risks, are a matter of significant concern,”

House pauses federal grant, loan other assistance programs</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Trump administration has temporarily paused grant,
loan and other financial assistance programs at the Office of Management
and Budget, according to a memo seen by Reuters, prompting criticism
from congressional Democrats.</p>
<p>The memo referenced the executive orders, including those seeking to
dismantle programs related to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI),
President Donald Trump has signed since taking office last week.</p>
<p>“In the interim, to the extent permissible under applicable law,
federal agencies must temporarily pause all activities related to
obligation or disbursement of all federal financial assistance, and
other relevant agency activities that may be impacted by the executive
orders, including, but not limited to, financial assistance for foreign
aid, nongovernmental organizations, DEI, woke gender ideology, and the
green new deal,” Matthew J. Vaeth, the acting director of the Office of
Management and Budget, wrote in the memo.</p>
<p>The suspension goes into effect on Jan. 28 at 5 p.m. eastern time,
according to the memo.</p>
<p>Top Democratic congressional budget appropriation lawmakers responded
to reports of the memo by sending a letter demanding the OMB reverse its
decision.</p>
<p>“The scope of what you are ordering is breathtaking, unprecedented,
and will have devastating consequences across the country. We write
today to urge you in the strongest possible terms to uphold the law and
the Constitution and ensure all federal resources are delivered in
accordance with the law,” Democratic Senator Patty Murray and Democratic
Representative Rosa DeLauro wrote.</p>
<p>Agencies have until Feb. 10 to submit detailed information on any
programs, projects or activities subject to the pause, the memo
states.</p>
<p>The suspension will provide the administration with time to review
agency programs and determine the best uses of funding for those
programs consistent with the law and Trump’s priorities, it added.</p>
<p>Agencies must identify legally mandated actions or deadlines for
assistance programs before completing the analysis, it added.</p>
<p>Vaeth directed federal agencies to halt all activities associated
with open notices of funding opportunities.</p>
<p>“This memorandum requires federal agencies to identify and review all
federal financial assistance programs and supporting activities
consistent with the president’s policies and requirement,” Vaeth
wrote.</p>

sends air force planes to bring home migrants deported from the US</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A Colombian Air Force jet was expected to land back in the country
early Tuesday carrying 110 Colombians deported from the United
States.</p>
<p>The flight from San Diego, along with another traveling from Houston
back to Colombia, follows a dispute sparked Sunday when Colombian
President Gustavo Petro refused to allow U.S. military planes to send
deported Colombians back home.</p>
<p>Petro said such treatment was disrespectful. His refusal prompted
U.S. President Donald Trump to threaten to impose tariffs, which Petro
said he would reciprocate before the two countries announced they had
reached an agreement to defuse the situation.</p>
<p>Petro said the Colombian Air Force flights would allow the migrants
to travel home “without being handcuffed.”</p>
<p>“This provision: dignity for deportees, will be applied to all
countries that send deportations to us,” Petro said.</p>
<p>Trump has quickly moved to carry out deportations, one of his
campaign pledges, since taking office last week. He said Monday that if
countries do not accept their migrants fast, “they’ll pay a very high
economic price, and we’re going to immediately install massive
tariffs.”</p>
<p>While Colombia balked at the U.S. military flights, Guatemala has
accepted several U.S. Air Force flights carrying Guatemalan migrants
deported from the United States in recent days.</p>
<p>The latest flight took place Monday, with 64 Guatemalans returning
home.</p>
<p>Guatemala’s Vice President Karin Herrera said Monday she was
monitoring the care and condition of migrants arriving from the United
States.</p>
<p>“Guatemalan migrants are people with rights and dignity. Our
commitment is to guarantee that their arrival in the country, to their
land, is in the best conditions,” Herrera said.</p>
<p>U.S. deportation flights are not new, with U.S. Immigration and
Customs Enforcement carrying out hundreds of the flights each year. But
the use of military flights is new, with the agency previously using
commercial and chartered flights to deport people who are illegally in
the United States.</p>

and Lammy reaffirm US-UK partnership on Indo-Pacific security, China
challenges</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>State Department — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke with his
British counterpart, Foreign Secretary David Lammy, on Monday to discuss
a range of pressing global issues and joint initiatives aimed at
promoting a free and open Indo-Pacific that is secure and stable.</p>
<p>“They affirmed the depth of the U.S.-UK Special Relationship and the
crucial nature of our partnership in addressing issues like the conflict
in the Middle East, Russia’s war against Ukraine, and China’s malign
influence,” State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a
statement.</p>
<p>The U.K. government said that Lammy and Rubio look forward to meeting
in person soon.</p>
<p>“They both welcomed the opportunity for the UK and the US to work
together in alignment to address shared challenges including the
situation in the Middle East, Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine, the
challenges posed by China and the need for Indo-Pacific security,” the
British statement read.</p>
<p>The call between Rubio and Lammy came amid a report by The Guardian
that China’s Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, is expected to visit Britain
next month for the first U.K.-China strategic dialogue since 2018.</p>
<p>In Beijing, Chinese officials did not confirm Wang’s plans to visit
the U.K. but noted what they described as “sound and steady growth” in
relations between the two countries.</p>
<p>“China and the U.K. are both permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council and major economies in the world,” Mao Ning, spokesperson for
the Chinese Foreign Ministry, stated during a briefing on Monday. She
added it is in the common interest of the two countries to enhance
strategic communication and deepen political mutual trust.</p>
<p>Wang is expected to attend the Munich Security Conference between
Feb. 14 and 16, making it likely that his visit to the U.K. will take
place either before or after the event.</p>
<p>In the past, U.S. Secretaries of State have typically attended the
high-profile annual gathering at the Munich Security Conference.</p>
<p>The State Department has not responded to VOA’s inquiry about whether
Rubio plans to hold talks with Wang during the conference.</p>
<p>Last week, the State Department outlined U.S. policy toward China
under President Donald Trump’s administration. </p>
<p>“Strategic competition is the frame through which the United States
views its relationship with the People’s Republic of China (PRC). The
United States will address its relationship with the PRC from a position
of strength in which we work closely with our allies and partners to
defend our interests and values,” the State Department said on
Jan. 20.</p>

DeepSeek AI rattles Wall Street, but questions remain</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Chinese researchers backed by a Hangzhou-based hedge fund recently
released a new version of a large language model (LLM) called
DeepSeek-R1 that rivals the capabilities of the most advanced U.S.-built
products but reportedly does so with fewer computing resources and at
much lower cost.</p>
<p>High Flyer, the hedge fund that backs DeepSeek, said that the model
nearly matches the performance of LLMs built by U.S. firms like OpenAI,
Google and Meta, but does so using only about 2,000 older generation
computer chips manufactured by U.S.-based industry leader Nvidia while
costing only about $6 million worth of computing power to train.</p>
<p>By comparison, Meta’s AI system, Llama, uses about 16,000 chips, and
reportedly costs Meta vastly more money to train.</p>
<p>Open-source model</p>
<p>The apparent advance in Chinese AI capabilities comes after years of
efforts by the U.S. government to restrict China’s access to advanced
semiconductors and the equipment used to manufacture them. Over the past
two years, under President Joe Biden, the U.S. put multiple export
control measures in place with the specific aim of throttling China’s
progress on AI development.</p>
<p>DeepSeek appears to have innovated its way to some of its success,
developing new and more efficient algorithms that allow the chips in the
system to communicate with each other more effectively, thereby
improving performance.</p>
<p>At least some of what DeepSeek R1’s developers did to improve its
performance is visible to observers outside the company, because the
model is open source, meaning that the algorithms it uses to answer
queries are public.</p>
<p>Market reaction</p>
<p>The news about DeepSeek’s capabilities sparked a broad sell-off of
technology stocks on U.S. markets on Monday, as investors began to
question whether U.S. companies’ well-publicized plans to invest
hundreds of billions of dollars in AI data centers and other
infrastructure would preserve their dominance in the field. When the
markets closed on Monday, the tech-heavy Nasdaq index was down by 3.1%,
and Nvidia’s share price had plummeted by nearly 17%.</p>
<p>However, not all AI experts believe the markets’ reaction to the
release of DeepSeek R1 is justified, or that the claims about the
model’s development should be taken at face value.</p>
<p>Mel Morris, CEO of U.K.-based Corpora.ai, an AI research engine, told
VOA that while DeepSeek is an impressive piece of technology, he
believes the market reaction has been excessive and that more
information is needed to accurately judge the impact DeepSeek will have
on the AI market.</p>
<p>“There’s always an overreaction to things, and there is today, so
let’s just step back and analyze what we’re seeing here,” Morris said.
“Firstly, we have no real understanding of exactly what the cost was or
the time scale involved in building this product. We just don’t know. …
They claim that it’s significantly cheaper and more efficient, but we
have no proof of that.”</p>
<p>Morris said that while DeepSeek’s performance may be comparable to
that of OpenAI products, “I’ve not seen anything yet that convinces me
that they’ve actually cracked the quantum step in the cost of operating
these sorts of models.”</p>
<p>Doubts about origins</p>
<p>Lennart Heim, a data scientist with the RAND Corporation, told VOA
that while it is plain that DeepSeek R1 benefits from innovative
algorithms that boost its performance, he agreed that the general public
actually knows relatively little about how the underlying technology was
developed.</p>
<p>Heim said that it is unclear whether the $6 million training cost
cited by High Flyer actually covers the whole of the company’s
expenditures — including personnel, training data costs and other
factors — or is just an estimate of what a final training “run” would
have cost in terms of raw computing power. If the latter, Heim said, the
figure is comparable to the costs incurred by better U.S. models.</p>
<p>He also questioned the assertion that DeepSeek was developed with
only 2,000 chips. In a blog post written over the weekend, he noted that
the company is believed to have existing operations with tens of
thousands of Nvidia chips that could have been used to do the work
necessary to develop a model that is capable of running on just
2,000.</p>
<p>“This extensive compute access was likely crucial for developing
their efficiency techniques through trial and error and for serving
their models to customers,” he wrote.</p>
<p>He also pointed out that the company’s decision to release version R1
of its LLM last week — on the heels of the inauguration of a new U.S.
president — appeared political in nature. He said that it was “clearly
intended to rattle the public’s confidence in the United States’ AI
leadership during a pivotal moment in U.S. policy.”</p>
<p>Dean W. Ball, a research fellow at George Mason University’s Mercatus
Center, was also cautious about declaring that DeepSeek R1 has somehow
upended the AI landscape.</p>
<p>“I think Silicon Valley and Wall Street are overreacting to some
extent,” he told VOA. “But at the end of the day, R1 means that the
competition between the U.S. and China is likely to remain fierce, and
that we need to take it seriously.”</p>
<p>Export control debate</p>
<p>The apparent success of DeepSeek has been used as evidence by some
experts to suggest that the export controls put in place under the Biden
administration may not have had the intended effects.</p>
<p>“At a minimum, this suggests that U.S. approaches to AI and export
controls may not be as effective as proponents claim,” Paul Triolo, a
partner with DGA-Albright Stonebridge Group, told VOA.</p>
<p>“The availability of very good but not cutting-edge GPUs — for
example, that a company like DeepSeek can optimize for specific training
and inference workloads — suggests that the focus of export controls on
the most advanced hardware and models may be misplaced,” Triolo said.
“That said, it remains unclear how DeepSeek will be able to keep pace
with global leaders such as OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Mistral, Meta and
others that will continue to have access to the best hardware
systems.”</p>
<p>Other experts, however, argued that export controls have simply not
been in place long enough to show results.</p>
<p>Sam Bresnick, a research fellow at Georgetown’s University’s Center
for Security and Emerging Technology told VOA that it would be “very
premature” to call the measures a failure.</p>
<p>“The CEO of DeepSeek has gone on record saying the biggest constraint
they face is access to high-level compute resources,” Bresnick said. “If
[DeepSeek] had as much compute at their fingertips as Google, Microsoft,
OpenAI, etc, there would be a significant boost in their performance. So
… I don’t think that DeepSeek is the smoking gun that some people are
claiming it is [to show that export controls] do not work.”</p>
<p>Bresnick noted that the toughest export controls were imposed in only
2023, meaning that their effects may just be starting to be felt. He
said that the real test of their effectiveness will be whether U.S.
firms are able to continue to outpace China in coming years.</p>

<h2 id="cdc-ordered-to-stop-working-with-who-immediately">CDC ordered to
stop working with WHO immediately</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — U.S. public health officials have been told to stop
working with the World Health Organization, effective immediately.</p>
<p>A U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official, John
Nkengasong, sent a memo to senior leaders at the agency on Sunday night
telling them that all staff who work with the WHO must immediately stop
their collaborations and “await further guidance.”</p>
<p>Experts said the sudden stoppage was a surprise and would set back
work on investigating and trying to stop outbreaks of Marburg virus and
mpox in Africa, as well as brewing global threats. It also comes as
health authorities around the world are monitoring bird flu outbreaks
among U.S. livestock.</p>
<p>The Associated Press viewed a copy of Nkengasong’s memo, which said
the stop-work policy applied to “all CDC staff engaging with WHO through
technical working groups, coordinating centers, advisory boards,
cooperative agreements or other means — in person or virtual.” It also
says CDC staff are not allowed to visit WHO offices.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump last week issued an executive order to begin
the process of withdrawing the U.S. from WHO, but that did not take
immediate effect. Leaving WHO requires the approval of Congress and that
the U.S. meets its financial obligations for the current fiscal year.
The U.S. also must provide a one-year notice.</p>
<p>His administration also told federal health agencies to stop most
communications with the public through at least the end of the
month.</p>
<p>“Stopping communications and meetings with WHO is a big problem,”
said Dr. Jeffrey Klausner, a University of Southern California public
health expert who collaborates with WHO on work against sexually
transmitted infections.</p>
<p>“People thought there would be a slow withdrawal. This has really
caught everyone with their pants down,” said Klausner, who said he
learned of it from someone at CDC.</p>
<p>“Talking to WHO is a two-way street,” he added, noting that the two
agencies benefit from each other’s expertise. The collaboration allows
the U.S. to learn about new tests, new treatments and emerging outbreaks
— information “which can help us protect Americans abroad and at home,”
Klausner said.</p>
<p>The CDC details nearly 30 people to WHO and sends many millions of
dollars to it through cooperative agreements. The U.S. agency also has
some of the world’s leading experts in infectious diseases and public
health threats, and the two agencies’ staffers are in daily contact
about health dangers and how to stop them.</p>
<p>The collaboration halt isn’t the only global health effect of Trump’s
executive orders. Last week, the president froze spending on another
critical program, PEPFAR or the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS
Relief.</p>
<p>The anti-HIV program is credited with saving 25 million lives,
including those of 5.5 million children, since it was started by
Republican President George W. Bush. It was included in a Trump
administration freeze on foreign aid spending slated to last at least
three months.</p>
<p>PEPFAR provides HIV medication to more than 20 million people “and
stopping its funding essentially stops their HIV treatment,”
International AIDS Society President Beatriz Grinsztejn said in a
statement. “If that happens, people are going to die and HIV will
resurge.”</p>
<p>A U.S. health official confirmed that the CDC was stopping its work
with WHO. The person was not authorized to talk about the memo and spoke
on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>A WHO spokesperson referred questions about the withdrawal to U.S.
officials.</p>
<p>Officials at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services didn’t
immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. And CDC officials
didn’t respond to the AP’s request to speak with Nkengasong about the
memo.</p>

Maps to rename ‘Gulf of Mexico’ to ‘Gulf of America’ for US users</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Google Maps will change the name of “Gulf of Mexico” to
“Gulf of America” once it is officially updated in the U.S. Geographic
Names System, it said in an X post on Monday.</p>
<p>The change will be visible in the U.S., but it will remain “Gulf of
Mexico” in Mexico. Outside of the two countries, users will see both
names.</p>
<p>The Trump administration’s Interior Department said on Friday it had
officially changed the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of
America, and the Alaskan peak Denali to Mount McKinley.</p>
<p>Google Maps, which is owned by Alphabet’s Google, will make a similar
change with Mount McKinley.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump ordered the name changes as part of a flurry
of executive actions hours after taking office last Monday, making good
on a campaign promise.</p>
<p>“As directed by the President, the Gulf of Mexico will now officially
be known as the Gulf of America and North America’s highest peak will
once again bear the name Mount McKinley,” the Interior Department said
in a statement last week.</p>

id="full-scale-replica-of-anne-franks-hidden-annex-opens-in-new-york-city">Full-scale
replica of Anne Frank’s hidden annex opens in New York City</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — A full-scale replica of the secret annex where Anne Frank
penned her famous diary opened in New York City on Monday as the world
marked International Holocaust Remembrance Day.</p>
<p>The exhibit at the Center for Jewish History in Manhattan represents
the first time the annex has been completely recreated outside of
Amsterdam, where the space is a central part of the Anne Frank House
museum.</p>
<p>But while the original annex has been intentionally left empty, the
New York reconstruction shows the five rooms as they would have looked
while the Frank family and others lived in hiding.</p>
<p>The spaces are filled with furniture and possessions, including a
reconstruction of the writing desk where Frank wrote her diary.</p>
<p>Ronald Leopold, director of the Anne Frank House, said furnishing the
recreated space was important to tell Anne’s story in a new and
immersive way, especially for those who may not get to visit the
Amsterdam museum, which also houses Frank’s original diary.</p>
<p>“We very much hope that we will be able to touch people’s hearts
here, because education is the focus of this exhibition,” Leopold said
at Monday’s opening. “And education starts with empathy — empathy with
what happened here, what happened in Amsterdam during those years, what
was done to Anne Frank.”</p>
<p>The Frank family hid with other Jews for two years in the attic of
patriarch Otto Frank’s office in Amsterdam as the Nazi German army
occupied the Netherlands during World War II.</p>
<p>They were eventually discovered in 1944 and sent to concentration
camps, including Auschwitz-Birkenau, which was liberated by Soviet
troops 80 years ago Monday. Anne and her older sister Margot died of
typhus at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1945.</p>
<p>Their father, Otto, was the only person from the annex to survive the
Holocaust. After the war, he published his 15-year-old daughter’s diary,
which is considered one of the most important works of the 20th century.
Frank died in 1980 at the age of 91.</p>
<p>Hannah-Milena Elias, the granddaughter of Anne Frank’s cousin, Buddy
Elias, said she found it emotional walking through the exhibit
rooms.</p>
<p>“It is quite overwhelming and quite touching to see what a tiny space
the families had to stay in and live for more than two years,” said the
29-year-old, who lives in Switzerland.</p>
<p>Her sister, Leyv-Anouk Elias, hoped the exhibit would encourage
visitors to reflect on what it means to face discrimination or be a
minority today.</p>
<p>“History, unfortunately, is repeating itself in different ways,” the
27-year-old Berlin resident said. “We have to be very, very careful how
to act and to do stuff against it, to not ever make this happen
again.”</p>
<p>The New York exhibit, which runs through April 30, spans more than
696 square meters (7,500 square feet) and includes more than 100 photos
and other artifacts — many never before displayed publicly, according to
officials.</p>
<p>Among the items are Anne Frank’s first photo album and her
handwritten poetry, as well as a replica of her famous diary. There are
also nearly 80 translated editions of her diary and even the Oscar won
by Shelley Winters for the 1959 film The Diary of Anne Frank.</p>
<p>The installation is presented chronologically, tracing the Frank
family’s life in Germany through the rise of the Nazi regime, the
family’s flight to Amsterdam and their life in hiding and eventual
capture.</p>
<p>Henry Byrne, a junior at Xavier, a Catholic high school in Manhattan,
said learning about the family’s saga helped him grasp the enormity of
the Holocaust.</p>
<p>“It taught me a lot about how just because you see one story, walk
into these rooms and all the beds and the tables, that’s just one
person’s life,” the 16-year-old said. “And there were millions that were
lost.”</p>

really is not in a position to do because of the [semiconductor] export
controls that the United States is placing,” said Dean W. Ball, a

there are signs that China is catching up with U.S. companies in key AI
metrics by relying on open-source software.</p>

id="scott-bessent-wins-senate-confirmation-as-us-treasury-secretary">Scott
Bessent wins Senate confirmation as US Treasury secretary</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The U.S. Senate on Monday confirmed Scott Bessent to be President
Donald Trump’s Treasury secretary, giving the billionaire hedge fund
manager a central role in shaping the new administration’s policy
ambitions around tax cuts and spending and managing economic
relationships with allies and adversaries alike.</p>
<p>As the 79th Treasury secretary, Bessent will have sway over the
nation’s tax collections and its $28 trillion Treasury debt market, with
vast influence over fiscal policy, financial regulations, international
sanctions and investments from overseas.</p>
<p>The vote was 68-29, with 16 Democrats supporting the nomination.</p>
<p>Bessent, 62, is already shaping up to be a forceful advocate for
Trump’s economic agenda, which centers on reducing taxes and imposing
steep tariffs that Democrats, and some economists, argue could undo some
of the progress the Federal Reserve has made in getting inflation under
control.</p>
<p>In his confirmation hearing, Bessent warned that failure to renew $4
trillion in tax cuts expiring at the end of this year would be a
“calamity” for middle-class Americans, and made the case that tariffs
would help combat unfair trade practices, increase revenues, and bolster
U.S. leverage in international negotiations.</p>
<p>He also pushed back against the idea that Trump’s policies would be
inflationary, and said that the administration’s efforts to increase oil
production would actually help bring down prices.</p>
<p>As Trump’s top economic official, Bessent will face a range of
challenges, the most immediate of which will be managing federal cash
flows after the government hit its statutory debt limit on Trump’s
second day in office. Even before he was sworn in, the Treasury
Department was using “extraordinary measures” to avoid breaching the cap
and triggering a catastrophic default. Bessent told senators in his
confirmation hearing that there would be no default on his watch.</p>
<p>Bessent will also need to deal with the prospect of rising budget
deficits and added government debt estimated to run into the trillions
of dollars, if tax cut extensions and other promised tax breaks cannot
be offset by revenue increases or spending cuts. If precedent holds, he
will be a central actor working with Congress on the size and shape of
any tax reforms.</p>
<p>More than 60% of the federal debt is scheduled to roll over on his
watch — and that’s before taking into account issuance growth that has
been running at more than $2 trillion a year since the COVID-19
pandemic.</p>
<p>‘Out of control’</p>
<p>Worries about rising budget deficits and stickier inflation have in
recent weeks sent long-term bond yields up as investors demand more
compensation for risk. That in turn has driven up the average rate on
30-year fixed-rate mortgages to more than 7%, a pain point with saliency
for Americans looking to buy a home.</p>
<p>Bessent used his confirmation hearing to talk tough on deficits,
declaring that government spending is “out of control,” though it is not
clear how much he could do to rein it in. He backed Trump’s pledge not
to touch the Social Security retirement program and Medicare insurance
plan for seniors, among the biggest line items in the federal budget,
along with interest expense, determined by market rates that the
Treasury does not control.</p>
<p>Born and raised in South Carolina, Bessent says he still listens to
farm radio. He earned a bachelor’s degree in political science from Yale
University and has spent his career in finance, working for investors
George Soros and Jim Chanos, and running his own firm Key Square.
Bessent — as fifth in line to the presidency — is also the highest
ranking openly gay federal official in history. He is married with two
children.</p>

rattles houses in Maine, felt as far away as Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SCARBOROUGH, Maine — A 3.8-magnitude earthquake centered near the
Maine coast rattled houses in northern New England on Monday and was
felt by surprised residents of states hundreds of miles away. </p>
<p>The earthquake took place at about 10:22 a.m. Monday and was centered
about six miles (10 kilometers) southeast of York Harbor in southern
Maine, the United States Geological Survey reported. It was reported at
a depth of about eight miles (13 kilometers) the survey said. </p>
<p>Officials said the quake could be felt in every state in New England
and as far away as Pennsylvania. In southern Maine, many residents
reported feeling houses and buildings shake as the surprising earthquake
interrupted a sunny winter morning. </p>
<p>The quake sent residents and officials in Maine and New Hampshire
looking to assess any possible damage. In most cases, residents and
businesses reported confusion over what had happened. Many shared
stories on social media indicating they initially thought there may have
been a nearby car accident or possibly an explosion. </p>
<p>The Maine Emergency Management Agency asked residents to only call
911 in the event of an emergency. The earthquake did not appear to cause
any major damage, said Vanessa Corson, a spokesperson for the agency.
Corson also said local emergency management agencies did not report any
damage. </p>
<p>New Hampshire’s Department of Safety said the state’s 911 number did
not receive any calls about damage or injuries. </p>
<p>“We have not received word of any issues. We’ve spoken with the
directors at York and Cumberland County EMA, and everything seems to be
in order,” Corson said. </p>
<p>Justine Wenger, a freelance copywriter working from her Scarborough
home, said she was texting with a friend when she felt the earthquake.
The vibrations lasted about 30 seconds and shook her house. At first,
she thought it was a passing truck, then feared her furnace might blow
up so she went out onto her deck. </p>
<p>“I wasn’t terrified, but this felt different than a normal rumbling,”
she said. “It felt substantial. There was an instinct to get out of the
house.” </p>
<p>Authorities said residents who felt the earthquake could report it to
the USGS website. Earthquakes in the center and eastern parts of the
U.S. are less frequent than in western states, but they are typically
felt over a much broader region, the survey said on its website. </p>
<p>It’s common for there to be two small earthquakes a year in New
England, the survey said. A slightly stronger earthquake based in New
Jersey shook the Northeast in April. </p>
<p>“People in New England, and in its geological extension southward
through Long Island, have felt small earthquakes and suffered damage
from infrequent larger ones since colonial times,” according to the
survey’s website. </p>
<p>An earthquake of close to 4.0 or slightly higher in magnitude in the
Northeast states “is not particularly common, but it’s not all that
rare, either,” said Maureen Long, the chair of the Department of Earth
and Planetary Sciences at Yale University. Long cited the April
earthquake in New Jersey as an example. </p>
<p>A 2002 earthquake in upstate New York was measured at a magnitude of
5.1. There was also a magnitude 4.7 event near Hollis Center, Maine, in
2012, Long said. </p>
<p>Residents of cities including Boston and Providence, Rhode Island,
also reported feeling the quake. </p>
<p>In Kennebunk, Maine, school superintendent Terri Cooper assured
parents via e-mail that staff was looking through schools for any damage
and everything seemed fine. </p>
<p>“Our operations department has checked all district buildings and
systems to ensure they are in working order and no damage has been
discovered,” Cooper’s e-mail said.</p>

id="woman-gets-more-than-3-year-prison-term-in-us-birthright-tourism-case">Woman
gets more than 3-year prison term in ‘US birthright tourism’ case</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Los Angeles — A California woman was sentenced Monday to more than 3
years in prison in a long-running case over a business that helped
pregnant Chinese women travel to the United States to deliver babies who
automatically became American citizens. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge R. Gary Klausner gave Phoebe Dong a 41-month
sentence and ordered her immediately taken into custody from his federal
court in Los Angeles. Dong and her husband were convicted in September
of conspiracy and money laundering through their company, USA Happy
Baby. </p>
<p>The sentencing came as birthright citizenship has been thrust into
the spotlight in the United States with the return of President Donald
Trump to the White House. Since taking office, Trump issued an executive
order to narrow the definition of birthright citizenship, a move quickly
blocked by a federal judge who called it “blatantly
unconstitutional.” </p>
<p>Dong and her husband, Michael Liu, were among more than a dozen
people charged in an Obama-era crackdown on so-called “birth tourism”
schemes that helped Chinese women hide their pregnancies while traveling
to the United States to give birth. Such businesses have long operated
in various states catering to people from China, Russia, Nigeria and
elsewhere. </p>
<p>Under the 14th Amendment, any child born in the United States is an
American citizen. Many have seen these trips as a way to help their
children secure a U.S. college education and a better future —
especially since the tourists themselves can apply for permanent
residency once the children turn 21. </p>
<p>During her sentencing hearing, Dong wiped away tears as she recalled
growing up without siblings due to China’s strict “one-child” policy and
told the court that the Chinese government forced her mother to have an
abortion. Moving to the United States was challenging, she said, but
Dong grew hopeful after having children of her own and saw she could
help Chinese women who want to have additional children in
California. </p>
<p>“I don’t want to lose my kids,” she told the court. “I hope you can
give me fair judgment. I will take all my responsibility.” </p>
<p>Federal prosecutors sought a more than five-year sentence for Dong
and argued that she and Liu helped more than 100 pregnant Chinese women
travel to the United States. They said the pair worked with others to
coach women on how to trick customs officials by flying into airports
believed to be more lax while wearing loose-fitting clothing to hide
their pregnancies. </p>
<p>“For tens of thousands of dollars each, defendant helped her numerous
customers deceive U.S. authorities and buy U.S. citizenship for their
children,” prosecutors said in court filings. They declined to comment
after the sentencing. </p>
<p>In December, Liu was also sentenced to 41 months in prison. Dong’s
lawyer, John McNicholas, asked that she be allowed to serve her term
after Liu completes his sentence because of their three children. The
youngest is 13. </p>
<p>Federal prosecutor Kevin Fu agreed to the delay, but Klausner refused
and had her taken into custody immediately. Dong removed a necklace and
gave it to a family member before she was led away. </p>
<p>The USA Happy Baby case was part of a broader probe into businesses
that helped Chinese women travel to give birth in California. The
operator of another business is believed to have fled to China,
McNicholas wrote in court filings, while another was sentenced in 2019
to 10 months in prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy and visa
fraud for running the company known as “You Win USA.” </p>
<p>McNicholas said he feels Dong was given a much longer sentence
because the government and Klausner blame her for the babies that were
born U.S. citizens. That, he said, is unrelated to the allegations that
she and Liu helped women travel to the United States to give birth. </p>
<p>“Our position was these children are born in America. They’re
citizens,” McNicholas said, adding that Dong will appeal. “Implicitly,
he’s saying being born here is not enough.”</p>

Today’s internet is inundated with
“<a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/the-new-ai-buzzword-is-slop-and-its-messing-with-you-what-to-watch-out-for/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>AI
slop</u></a>,” and mocking the often bizarre outputs produced of
language models (recall the Google AI that
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/30/24168344/google-defends-ai-overviews-search-results" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>recommended</u></a>
making pizza with glue) has become an online pastime. Yet artificial
intelligence advocates have not been deterred from their claims of a
utopian future made possible by AI. Whatever problems we face —
including climate change — one day, we are told, they will be solved by
the magical power of computing. The breathless headlines have been
around for years:
“<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/artificial-intelligence-climate-change" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>How
artificial intelligence can tackle climate change</u></a>”;
“<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/26/tech/ai-climate-solutions/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>How

“<a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/02/ai-combat-climate-change/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>9
ways AI is helping tackle climate change</u></a>.”
</p>
<p>
Like much of the hype around AI, the specifics aren’t necessarily wrong.
AI <em><em>could</em></em> help us
<a href="https://collections.unu.edu/eserv/UNU:9738/Harnessing_the_Power_of_AI__Obringer__2024_.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>understand</u></a>
the impacts of climate change more comprehensively, and
<em><em>can</em></em> be used to locate solutions to particular
challenges in technology and manufacturing. But as the extraordinary
energy demands AI will impose on our system are coming into focus, and
as some of the most important corporate AI
leaders<a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-ai-openai-oracle-softbank-son-altman-ellison-be261f8a8ee07a0623d4170397348c41" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>
join hands</u></a> with what could be the most anti-environment
administration in history, the big picture problem becomes even clearer.
Artificial intelligence can’t solve climate change because doing so will
always require passing through the bottleneck of politics.
</p>
<p>
For those hoping to bring us to a glorious future guided by
superintelligent computers, claiming that AI will solve climate change
has become more urgent as the energy demands of the technology increase.
Google
<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/03/tech/google-ai-greenhouse-gas-emissions-environmental-impact/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reported</u></a>
last summer that since 2019, its emissions have increased by 48% because
of its use of AI. The International Energy Agency
<a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/electricity-2024/executive-summary" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>projects</u></a>
that by 2026, AI will consume 1,000 terawatt-hours of electricity, as
much as the entire nation of Japan, the world’s fourth-largest economy.
Countries around the world are rushing to develop their own AI systems
(the surprising capabilities of a new Chinese system called DeepSeek
just sent the stock market
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/27/tech/deepseek-stocks-ai-china/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>tumbling</u></a>),
any of which could entail the same scale of energy demand as the ones
created by American tech giants.
</p>
<p>
But imagine if we could snap our fingers and make that problem
disappear? That’s what OpenAI CEO Sam Altman suggested in a recent
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2025-sam-altman-interview" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>interview</u></a>
with <em><em>Bloomberg</em></em>. “Fusion’s going to work,” he said when
asked about AI’s energy demands, going on to say that “quickly
permitting fusion reactors” is the answer — particularly those made by
Helion Energy, a company whose executive chairman is, you guessed it,
Sam Altman.
</p>
<p>
Of course, Helion has no fusion reactors to permit yet because no one
does. Fusion’s promise of essentially limitless clean energy at low cost
is tantalizing, which is why billions of public and private dollars have
been
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/fusion" target="_self"><u>invested</u></a>
in fusion research. But while technological gains are being made, there
is still a great deal of uncertainty about how long it will take until
fusion can reach commercial scale. It might be 10 years, or 20, or 50 or
100 — no one knows for sure.
</p>
<p>
But blithely insisting that incredibly complex problems will be solved
easily and quickly is a specialty of tech barons. And if AI itself finds
the solution to our energy problems? Even better.
</p>
<p>
There’s no question that AI is improving at a rapid pace, even if there
are some things it’s still terrible at. And when it comes to climate,
over time it will probably help produce incremental gains across a wide
number of areas, from manufacturing efficiency to
<a href="https://www.archdaily.com/1012951/artificial-intelligence-and-urban-planning-technology-as-a-tool-for-city-design" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>urban
planning</u></a>. But the more dramatic and consequential any idea is —
whether it comes from AI or not — the more likely it is that it will
have to move through the political process in order to be implemented.
</p>
<p>
And that’s where AI can’t help. A machine learning system can’t tell you
the precise formula to please a recalcitrant senator or navigate a
hundred city councils with different ideas about what kinds of clean
energy projects they’ll allow in their towns. Politics is about people —
their goals, their incentives, their fears, their prejudices — and it’s
far too messy to be solved with numeric calculation, even by the most
powerful AI system imaginable.
</p>
<p>
Let’s say that a year from now, an AI came up with both an entirely new
way to design a fusion reactor and a revolutionary battery design that
offered longer and denser storage, together solving so many of the
problems scientists and engineers struggle with today. How would the
fossil fuel industry react to this development? Would it say, “Oh well,
oil and gas had a pretty good run, but now the world can move on”?
</p>
<p>
Of course not. It would use its extraordinary resources to battle
against their competition, just as they always have. That’s what it did
in the last election cycle, when it spent
<a href="https://climatepower.us/research-polling/big-oil-spent-450-million-to-influence-trump-the-119th-congress/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$450
million</u></a> on campaigns and lobbying to preserve the industry and
the riches it generates.
</p>
<p>
And while many hoped that the Republican Party would moderate its views
on climate, at the moment it looks more like it is going backward — not
just looking to undo every bit of progress made under the Biden
administration, but also undermining renewable energy wherever it can.
President Trump seems determined to
<a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/spotlight/trump-executive-order-wind" target="_self"><u>destroy
wind energy</u></a> in America, which has been growing rapidly in recent
years. Whether he succeeds will be up to the political system, not the
inherent usefulness of a millennium-old technology.
</p>
<p>
In politics, good ideas don’t always win out. Who has power and what
they are after will always matter a great deal, as Trump and the people
he is bringing into the federal government are showing us right now.
</p>
<p>
AI can be a tool that helps us reduce emissions and mitigate the effects
of climate change; the fact that its boosters regularly offer absurdly
optimistic timelines for societal transformation doesn’t mean the
underlying technology isn’t remarkable. But “solving” climate change
isn’t merely a technological problem. It will always be a political one
as well, and even the smartest piece of software won’t solve it for us.

id="trumps-sanctions-could-force-russias-putin-to-negotiating-table-some-experts-say">Trump’s
sanctions could force Russia’s Putin to negotiating table, some experts
say</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — On Jan. 22, Donald Trump — just two days after being
inaugurated for his second term as U.S. president — again called on
Russian President Vladimir Putin to negotiate an end to the “ridiculous”
war with Ukraine, but this time he added a threat.</p>
<p>“If we don’t make a ‘deal,’ and soon, I have no other choice but to
put high levels of Taxes, Tariffs, and Sanctions on anything being sold
by Russia to the United States, and various other participating
countries,” Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social.</p>
<p>The following day, Trump told reporters that Ukrainian President
Volodymyr Zelenskyy had told him he’s ready to negotiate an end to the
war. In an interview with Fox News aired that same day, Trump said
Zelenskyy is “no angel” and “shouldn’t have allowed this war to
happen.”</p>
<p>Does the new U.S. administration have sufficient economic leverage
over Russia to force it to make peace, or at least talk about peace?</p>
<p>According to Konstantin Sonin, John Dewey distinguished service
professor at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy
and former vice rector of Moscow’s Higher School of Economics, the U.S.
has economic leverage, but some of its levers are clearly weaker than
others.</p>
<p>“Russia’s trade with the U.S. is very small — less than $3 billion a
year,” he told Danila Galperovich of VOA’s Russian Service.
“Accordingly, even if any opportunity for U.S. companies to trade with
Russia is completely closed, the damage to Russia will be small. There
is an opportunity to strengthen secondary sanctions — that is,
additional pressure, first of all, on China, on India, on other
countries, so that they more strictly comply with the primary
sanctions.</p>
<p>“There is also an opportunity to continue what [former U.S. President
Joe] Biden did with sanctions against the Russian shadow tanker fleet,”
Sonin added, referring to vessels that Russia uses to sell oil and evade
Western sanctions.</p>
<p>“This requires great international cooperation, but, in principle, it
can be done,” said Sonin.</p>
<p>Economist Vladislav Inozemtsev, a special adviser to the Russian
Media Studies Project at MEMRI, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, and
director of the Moscow-based Center for Post-Industrial Studies, also
stressed the significance of secondary sanctions on countries that do
business with Russia.</p>
<p>“Trump can somehow influence other countries so that they do not buy
Russian products,” Inozemtsev told VOA. “For example, let’s say he can
say that if India buys Russian oil, then the United States will impose
15% duties on all goods from India. This would have the most radical
consequences. [I]f… countries trading with Russia are getting serious
problems in the United States for all their products, then I think that
this will be a very sobering moment. If it is possible to impose a
virtually complete trade blockade through U.S. sanctions, then these
will be devastating sanctions, of course.”</p>
<p>Sonin said that, over the longer term, deregulating oil production
internationally would reduce world oil prices and thereby hinder
Moscow’s ability to finance its military operations against Ukraine.</p>
<p>“Trump is famous for his good relations with Saudi Arabia, although
they are unlikely to be so good that they will reduce oil prices at his
request,” he said. “But nevertheless, it is possible to work towards
lowering oil prices, which even without sanctions will reduce Russian
income.”</p>
<p>Trump spoke with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in a Jan. 22
telephone call.</p>
<p>Still, Sonin said that economic levers, in and of themselves, cannot
force Putin to do anything. “I would say that the most direct impact is
still the supply of more powerful weapons to Ukraine. I do not know to
what extent Trump wants to do this, but he mentioned it, and, in
principle, it is possible to supply Ukraine with more powerful weapons
in larger quantities.”</p>
<p>Inozemtsev, however, said that Putin, who has not previously changed
his behavior in response to ultimatums, could do so this time.</p>
<p>“Trump is a person whose degree of radicalism and unpredictability
corresponds to Putin’s,” he said. “Here, perhaps, it would be better for
Putin to change his mind a bit. If Trump offers him: ‘Vladimir, let’s
go, we’ll meet there, sit down at the negotiating table, bring your
team, I’ll bring mine, and we’ll agree on something, we’ll discuss it
for a day or two, but the issue needs to be resolved,’ I think Putin

DeepSeek Ends the Party for U.S. Energy Stocks</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-27, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTk5ODAyOS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0NTI0MjcwOX0.wy9pZ8gIj8YbRCBEtspKggrzhHxhmUL--WhF_RJdciY/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
It’s not just tech stocks that are reeling after the release of Chinese
artificial intelligence company DeepSeek’s open-source R1 model, which
performs similarly to state-of-the-art models from American companies
while using less expensive hardware far more efficiently. Energy and
infrastructure companies — whose share prices had soared in the past
year on the promise of powering a massive artificial intelligence
buildout — have also seen their stock prices fall early Monday.
</p>
<p>
Shares in GE Vernova, which manufactures turbines for gas-fired power
plants, were down 19% in early trading Monday. Since the company’s
spinoff from GE last April, the share price had risen almost 200%
through last Friday, largely based on optimism about its
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/ge-vernova-natural-gas-ai" target="_self"><u>ability
to supply higher electricity demand</u></a>. Oklo, the advanced nuclear
company backed by OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman, is down 25%, after
rising almost 300% in the past year. Constellation Energy, the
independent power producer that’s
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/microsoft-three-mile-island-nuclear-constellation" target="_self"><u>re-powering
Three Mile Island</u></a> in partnership with Microsoft, saw its shares
fall almost 20% in early trading. It had risen almost 190% in the year
prior to Monday.
</p>
<p>
“DeepSeek’s power implications for AI training punctures some of the
capex euphoria which followed major commitments from Stargate and Meta
last week,” Jefferies infrastructure analyst Graham Hunt and his
colleagues wrote in a note to clients Monday. “With DeepSeek delivering
performance comparable to GPT-4 for a fraction of the computing power,
there are potential negative implications for the builders, as pressure
on AI players to justify ever increasing capex plans could ultimately
lead to a lower trajectory for data center revenue and profit growth.”
</p>
<p>
Investors fear that the proliferation of cheaper, more efficient models
may hurt the prospects of technology companies — and their suppliers —
that are spending tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars on
artificial intelligence investments.
</p>
<p>
Just last week, both Altman and Mark Zuckerberg, the founder and chief
executive of Meta, announced huge new investments in artificial
intelligence infrastructure.
</p>
<p>
Altman’s OpenAI is part of Stargate, the joint venture with Microsoft
and SoftBank that got a splashy White House-based announcement and
<a href="https://openai.com/index/announcing-the-stargate-project/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>promises
to invest $500 billion in artificial intelligence
infrastructure</u></a>. There was already some skepticism of these
numbers, with Altman-nemesis Elon Musk charging that certain members
would be
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-22/musk-says-firms-backing-trump-ai-initiative-don-t-have-the-money" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>unable
to fulfill their ends of the deal</u></a>, Microsoft Chief Executive
Satya Nadella
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/22/24349798/satya-nadella-on-elons-stargate-accusations-all-i-know-is-im-good-for-my-80-billion" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>told
CNBC from Davos</u></a>, “I’m good for my $80 billion.”
</p>
<p>
Zuckerberg, meanwhile,
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/pfbid034qCLXYjAC7vjhWHoin1iyzdx4GkUtH6xPkrkvLUmTreDAmspWsUbrmrGb17DfFyvl" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said
late last week</u></a> that his company was building a data center “so
large it would cover a significant part of Manhattan,” which would
require 2 gigawatts of electricity to power. (For scale, reactors 3 and
4 of the Vogtle nuclear plant in Georgia are a little over 1 gigawatt
each.) He also said that Meta had planned up to $65 billion of capital
expenditure this year.
</p>
<p>
These escalating announcements have been manna to investors in any
company that provides the building blocks for large artificial
intelligence systems — namely chips and energy, with companies like
Nvidia, the chip designer, and power companies and energy infrastructure
companies posting some of the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/ge-vernova-natural-gas-ai" target="_self"><u>best
stock market performances</u></a> last year.
</p>
<p>
But exactly how cheaper artificial intelligence plays out in terms of
real investment remains to be seen. Late Sunday night Redmond,
Washington-time, Nadella posted a
<a href="https://x.com/satyanadella/status/1883753899255046301" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>link
on X</u></a> to the Wikipedia page for Jevons Paradox. The idea
<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/12/20/the-efficiency-dilemma" target="_blank"><u>dates
from 19th century Britain</u></a>, and posits that increased efficiency
in using a resource (in Jevons’ case, coal) could actually accelerate
its depletion, as the resource becomes cheaper for the same economic
output, encouraging more use of it (in Jevons’ case, iron).
</p>
<p>
“Jevons paradox strikes again!,” Nadella wrote. “As AI gets more
efficient and accessible, we will see its use skyrocket, turning it into
a commodity we just can’t get enough of.”
</p>
<p>
Investors in chips and energy companies are hoping that’s the case; at
least so far, the market doesn’t appear to agree.

Startup Finds Critical Minerals in the Unlikeliest of Places</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-27, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTk5OTI5Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3MTE5OTQyNn0.8idd3qGIhC8cZv0M2Cxb2yq9Qvd1LAGt-zXlqCT-WIw/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
A century ago, prospectors tromped through remote areas, hoping to spot
valuable, mineralized rocks simply poking out of the ground. Eventually,
after they found all of the obvious stuff, they progressed to doing
airborne geophysical surveys that used tools such as electromagnetic
sensing to identify minerals that were just below the surface or highly
concentrated. But there’s always been a lot more out there than we had
the mechanisms to find. So now, companies are training artificial
intelligence models on heaps of historical data to help locate untouched
reserves of minerals that are key to clean energy technologies such as
electric vehicle batteries and wind turbines.
</p>
<p>
One of the biggest players in this space is Earth AI, a Sydney-based
startup that today announced a $20 million Series B round, bringing the
company’s total investment to over $38 million since its founding in
2017. While the company had initially sought to raise $15 million in
this round, investor interest was so strong that it exceeded its target
by $5 million. Lead investors were Tamarack Global and Cantos Ventures.
</p>
<p>
Earth AI has a two-stage business model. First, it uses its proprietary
software to locate likely deposits and purchases the mineral rights to
the land. Then, it sends in its drilling rig and in-house team of
geologists to produce mineral samples. The team then shows these samples
to mining companies to prove that the area warrants further development
and — assuming the miners are interested — sells them the mineral
rights. “Because of the scarcity of this, because of the deficit of
where we are and where we’re going, these price tags are $500 million to
$2.5 billion,” Monte Hackett, Earth AI’s chief financial officer, told
me. Huge as that may sound, it’s much less than what a mining company
would typically spend doing traditional exploration themselves. This
latest funding will allow the startup to purchase additional drill rigs
and increase its project pipeline to over 50 sites.
</p>
<p>
“The problem is obvious,” Hackett told me. “We need
<a href="https://about.bnef.com/blog/transition-metals-become-10-trillion-opportunity-as-demand-rises-and-supply-continues-to-lag/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$10
trillion of critical metal production</u></a> by 2050. We’re producing
<a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-critical-minerals-outlook-2024/executive-summary#:~:text=Strong%20growth%20in%20demand%20produces,its%20own%20attains%20that%20scale." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$320
billion</u></a>, a $9.7 trillion shortfall.” To better locate the
trillions of dollars worth of minerals necessary for the energy
transition, the startup’s CEO, geoscientist Roman Teslyuk, digitized
decades of old Australian geophysical survey data, then overlaid that
with remote sensing data such as satellite imagery to train a model to
recognize the Earth systems and geological processes that created
minerals deposits millennia ago. “Another way I like to think about it
is that our algorithm looks for the geological shadow that is cast by a
dense mineral body,” Hackett explained in a follow-up email.
</p>
<p>
Hackett told me that Earth AI focuses specifically on “greenfield”
applications — that is, areas where no mining activity or substantial
minerals exploration has previously occurred. So far, the company’s
discoveries include a
<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/earth-ai-and-legacy-minerals-announce-first-ever-greenfield-palladium-discovery-using-artificial-intelligence-in-new-south-wales-302312289.html#:~:text=This%20significant%20discovery%20of%20palladium,to%20contain%20no%20magmatic%20nickel." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>significant
deposit of palladium</u></a>, which also contains platinum and nickel,
<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/earth-ai-discovers-new-gold-system-close-to-existing-molybdenum-project-at-willow-glen-302336813.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>as
well as a gold deposit</u></a> and a
<a href="https://www.mining.com/machine-learning-helps-earth-ai-find-high-grade-molybdenum-in-unexpected-place/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>molybdenum
deposit</u></a>. “We’re finding things that go against what has been the
common sense of the industry so far,” Hackett told me, referencing the
company’s palladium discovery. “There was geological consensus that
there was no platinum palladium on the East Coast of Australia, and our
algorithm learned what it looked like on the West Coast and then
identified it on the East Coast.”
</p>
<p>
While Hackett said Earth AI is open for business anywhere, right now all
of its projects are in Australia, where the company has “600 ’x’s on our
treasure map” — that is, likely areas for deposits, Hackett wrote in a
follow-up email. Outlining the advantages of doing business there, he
explained, “We don’t have to go somewhere where there’s unsavory working
conditions or there are issues where we have to put our principles into
balance. Here, everything is very regulated and above board.” Plus,
mining has long been an important component of the Australian economy.
“They’re incredibly efficient at doing this well. So the timeline for
development is the shortest compared to other places,” Hackett told me.
</p>
<p>
This tech could have important domestic implications too, though. As the
newly-inaugurated President Trump
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/declaring-a-national-energy-emergency/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>prioritizes
ramping up</u></a> U.S. production of critical minerals, Earth AI could
one day help locate deposits here, as well. And since Australia is a
close American ally, the nation could play a key role in helping wean
the U.S. off of Chinese imports, providing the U.S. with critical
minerals that it can’t now, or perhaps ever, produce in sufficient
quantities itself.

‘Sputnik moment’ prompts investors to sell big AI players</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LONDON/SINGAPORE — Investors hammered technology stocks on Monday,
sending the likes of Nvidia and Oracle plummeting, as the emergence of a
low-cost Chinese artificial intelligence model cast doubts on Western
companies’ dominance in this sector. </p>
<p>Startup DeepSeek last week launched a free assistant it says uses
less data at a fraction of the cost of incumbent players’ models,
possibly marking a turning point in the level of investment needed for
AI.  </p>
<p>Futures on the Nasdaq 100 slid almost 4%, suggesting the index could
see its biggest daily slide since September 2022 later on Monday, if
those losses are sustained. </p>
<p>Those on the S&amp;P 500 dropped 2%. Shares in AI chipmaker Nvidia
fell more than 11%, rival Oracle dropped 8.5% and AI data analytics
company Palantir lost 6.5% in pre-market trading.  </p>
<p>DeepSeek, which by Monday had overtaken U.S. rival ChatGPT in terms
of downloads on the Apple Store, offers the prospect of a viable,
cheaper AI alternative which has raised questions about the
sustainability of the level of spending and investment on AI by Western
companies, including Apple and Microsoft.  </p>
<p>From Tokyo to Amsterdam, shares in AI players tumbled. </p>
<p>“We still don’t know the details and nothing has been 100% confirmed
in regards to the claims, but if there truly has been a breakthrough in
the cost to train models from $100 million+ to this alleged $6 million
number this is actually very positive for productivity and AI end users
as cost is obviously much lower meaning lower cost of access,” Jon
Withaar, a senior portfolio manager at Pictet Asset Management,
said. </p>
<p>The hype around AI has powered a huge inflow of capital into the
equity markets in the last 18 months in particular, as investors have
bought into the technology, inflating company valuations and sending
stock markets to record highs. </p>
<p>Little is known about the small Hangzhou startup behind DeepSeek. Its
researchers wrote in a paper last month that the DeepSeek-V3 model,
launched on Jan. 10, used Nvidia’s H800 chips for training, spending
less than $6 million - the figure referenced by Pictet’s Withaar. </p>
<p>H800 chips are not top-of-the-line. Initially developed as a
reduced-capability product to get around restrictions on sales to China,
they were subsequently banned by U.S. sanctions. </p>
<p>‘Sputnik moment’  </p>
<p>Marc Andreessen, the Silicon Valley venture capitalist, said in a
post on X on Sunday that DeepSeek’s R1 model was AI’s “Sputnik moment,”
referencing the former Soviet Union’s launch of a satellite that marked
the start of the space race in the late 1950s. </p>
<p>“Deepseek R1 is one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs
I’ve ever seen — and as open source, a profound gift to the world,” he
said in a separate post.  </p>
<p>In Europe, ASML which counts Taiwan’s TSMC, Intel and Samsung as its
customers, dropped almost 7.5%, while Siemens Energy lost nearly 18%. In
Japan, startup investor SoftBank Group slid more than 8%. Last week it
announced a $19 billion commitment to fund Stargate, a data-center joint
venture with OpenAI. </p>
<p>Given the volatility, investors sought out safe-havens such as U.S.
Treasuries, which pushed 10-year yields down nearly 10 basis points to
4.52%, while low-yielding currencies like the Japanese yen and the Swiss
franc soared against the dollar.  </p>
<p>Big Tech has ramped up spending on developing AI capabilities and
optimism over the possible returns has driven stock valuations
sky-high. </p>
<p>Nvidia alone has risen by over 200% in about 18 months and trades at
56 times the value of its earnings, compared with a 53% rise in the
Nasdaq .IXIC, which trades at a multiple of 16 to the value of its
constituents’ earnings, according to LSEG data. </p>
<p>Nick Ferres, chief investment officer at Vantage Point Asset
Management in Singapore said the market was questioning the capex spend
of the major tech companies. </p>
<p>Masahiro Ichikawa, chief market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui DS
Asset Management said: “The idea that the most cutting-edge technologies
in America, like Nvidia and ChatGPT, are the most superior globally,
there’s concern that this perspective might start to change.”  </p>
<p>“I think it might be a bit premature,” Ichikawa said.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
Now that President Donald Trump has been officially inaugurated and
issued his barrage of executive orders
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/national-energy-emergency" target="_self"><u>celebrating
fossil fuels</u></a> and shelving climate technologies such as
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/wind-executive-order-trump" target="_self"><u>wind
energy</u></a> and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/trump-ev-executive-order" target="_self"><u>electric
vehicles</u></a>, climate tech startups are in a pickle. Federal funding
can play a critical role in helping companies scale up and build out
first-of-a-kind projects and facilities. So how to work with a
government hostile to one of these startups’ core value propositions:
aiding in the energy transition?
</p>
<p>
Talk of clean tech and electrification may be out of vogue, but its
utility is not. The potential of many of these companies goes beyond
mitigating climate change and into the realm of energy security and
resilience — something the Department of Defense is well aware of.
</p>
<p>
The White House’s
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/climate" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>climate
webpage has gone dark</u></a>; the Department of Defense’s
<a href="https://www.climate.mil/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>climate
resilience portal</u></a> lasted a little longer, but that’s now down,
too. Once upon a time, though, the site read, “The changing climate is
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-national-security" target="_self"><u>one
of many threat multipliers</u></a> to National Security, which adds
complexity to Department of Defense decisions.” That’s a major reason
why this agency can’t stop, won’t stop funding climate technologies.
Another reason is that many technologies that happen to be good for the
planet might also simply be the best tool for the job, meaning the DOD
need not utter the word “climate” at all when justifying its decision to
deploy new solutions.
</p>
<p>
“The Defense Department, so far in our experience, has framed things
largely in terms of alternative benefits that our technology can have,
such as fuel supply chain redundancy and reliability,” Ted McKlveen,
co-founder and CEO of the hydrogen storage company Verne, told me. Verne
received a $250,000 Small Business Innovation Research
<a href="https://www.verneh2.com/news-article/verne-receives-award-to-develop-cryo-compressed-hydrogen-solutions-for-the-u-s-army" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>grant
from the Army</u></a> last May to work on the development of hydrogen
vehicles.
</p>
<p>
Cindy Taff, CEO of the next-generation geothermal startup Sage
Geosystems, told me something similar. “What the military likes to talk
about is energy resilience,” she said, though she has heard the DOD tout
the climate benefits of her company’s tech, too. Sage currently has
multiple DOD engagements, including feasibility studies with both the
<a href="https://www.sagegeosystems.com/sage-geosystems-to-advance-energy-resilience-with-geothermal-energy-solutions-at-fort-bliss/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Army</u></a>
and
<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241003555153/en/Sage-Geosystems-Expands-Collaboration-with-the-DoD-to-Enhance-Energy-Resilience-through-Geothermal-Energy-at-Naval-Air-Station-Corpus-Christi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Navy</u></a>
and a $1.9 million grant to build a demonstration project for the
<a href="https://www.afmc.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/3915653/air-force-awards-contract-to-test-clean-power-plant-technology/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Air
Force</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
That’s not to say it’s clear what the Department of Defense’s funding
priorities under Trump will be. When I contacted the DOD in mid-December
to request an interview for this story, a spokesperson initially told me
they would help connect me to the right person. But as Trump’s
inauguration drew nearer, I got a message saying the agency would have
to hold off until it got more guidance, as “it remains to be seen in the
next few weeks what direction the new administration is
going.<em><em>”</em></em>
</p>
<p>
Regardless of how the priorities shake out, practically every
climate-focused company and venture capitalist I talk to emphasizes that
their companies will only succeed if they can make or invest in products
that can compete on economics and/or quality alone, sans government
support. That was true even before a second Trump turn in the White
House started to look like an inevitability, and this new administration
will at least partially reveal which companies can do that. But while
everybody <em><em>aims </em></em>to be independent of federal support,
they might not actually <em><em>need</em></em> to say goodbye to that
funding stream, so long as they can tout their economic and performance
benefits to the right customers.
</p>
<p>
Take Pyka, for example. When Michael Norcia co-founded the autonomous
electric aircraft company in 2017, the ultimate goal was to design a
passenger plane. “We want that to be our legacy, but we were also very,
very realistic about the challenges associated with actually doing
that,” he told me. So when the DOD took an interest in the company’s
commercial cargo planes and their potential ability to deliver supplies
in contested environments, the startup jumped at the opportunity,
delivering its first aircraft to AFWERX, the innovation arm of the
Department of the Air Force, early last year. Interest from such a
lucrative government customer helped the company to close its
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/23/pyka-fields-interest-from-defense-as-40m-round-goes-to-scaling-up-its-electric-autonomous-planes/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$40
million Series B</u></a> round in September.
</p>
<p>
Of course, the decarbonization benefits of electrifying military cargo
delivery would be huge. But unsurprisingly, Norcia told me that the DOD
primarily frames the opportunity in terms of the capabilities of
all-electric or hybrid-electric planes, which could take a variety of
fuels, operate quietly, and give off minimal heat, making them more
difficult to detect via thermal imaging. Plus, the more equipment is
electrified the better, “in terms of having them be able to operate in a
highly contested environment, where moving fuel around maybe is not
feasible,” Norcia explained. Not to mention the fact that if a manned
aircraft is shot down, people die, meaning that in a counterfactual
sense, Pyka’s tech is saving lives.
</p>
<p>
Verne’s North Star is also decarbonization. And given that the military
is the world’s largest oil consumer, McKlveen was excited to partner
with the Army to put its hydrogen storage tech to use in medium and
heavy-duty vehicles. The company stores hydrogen (ideally green
hydrogen, produced via renewables-powered electrolysis) at high density
as a cold, compressed gas, making it possible to build hydrogen vehicles
with greater range and lower cost than has traditionally been done.
Similar to Pyka, the Army is enthused that these vehicles would be
difficult for adversaries to detect, as they’re quiet and give off
little heat. Likewise, McKlveen told me that hydrogen power could
replace the Army’s notoriously noisy generators.
</p>
<p>
While Verne has also partnered with the
<a href="https://www.verneh2.com/news-article/verne-receives-award-through-doe-commercialization-support-program" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Department
of Energy</u></a> and its R&amp;D arm,
<a href="https://arpa-e.energy.gov/programs-and-initiatives/search-all-projects/decoupling-high-density-hydrogen-liquid-hydrogen-infrastructure-catalyst-filled-heat-exchangers-modular-cryo-compressors" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ARPA-E</u></a>,
McKlveen said that working with the DOD has been unique in a few ways.
“The key difference is the DOD is a customer and a grant provider. So
they can say both what their needs are as a potential customer and
represent a potential customer,” he explained. This, along with the
agency’s clear, phased approach that it puts companies through, helps
bring a level of transparency to the whole process, from pilot to
full-fledged military implementation, that McKlveen appreciates.
</p>
<p>
And lest we forget, “they also have a very large budget,” he told me.
For fiscal year 2025, the DOD has requested
<a href="https://www.armed-services.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/fy24_ndaa_conference_executive_summary1.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$849.8
billion</u></a>, while the DOE, by comparison, has requested a mere
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2024-03/doe-fy-2025-budget-in-brief-v2.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$51.4
billion</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
“I find military people to be get-it-done type of people,” Taff of Sage
Geosystems told me. “So I think that helps to create a sense of urgency
and also push things along a lot faster than you would see with maybe
other organizations.” Sage uses drilling technologies adopted from the
oil and gas industry to access heat for clean electricity production
across a wide variety of geographies. This is an especially attractive
option for the DOD as the majority of geothermal infrastructure is
underground, and thus well protected from attack. And unlike other
renewables, this tech can provide 24/7 energy no matter the weather
conditions. So it’s no surprise that the military is pouring money into
this sector, pursuing partnerships with other big names in the
geothermal space such as
<a href="https://www.diu.mil/latest/three-additional-next-generation-geothermal-technology-companies-advancing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Fervo
Energy</u></a> and
<a href="https://www.eavor.com/press-releases/u-s-defense-department-awards-eavor-contract-to-power-military-base-through-advanced-geothermal-system/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Eavor.</u></a>
</p>
<p>
Electric planes, hydrogen, and geothermal all felt intuitively
justifiable to me from a defense standpoint, but I was more surprised to
learn that the DOD has gotten into the alternative proteins, a.k.a.
“fake meat”, industry. Though meat substitutes won’t power tankers or
keep the lights on, the Defense Department’s
<a href="https://www.fooddive.com/news/better-meat-awarded-grant-department-of-defense/725392/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$1.4
million grant</u></a> to The Better Meat Co. is intended to strengthen
the American supply chain. China’s Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Affairs views
<a href="https://time.com/6143109/china-future-of-cultivated-meat/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>lab-grown
meat as critical</u></a> to its five-year agricultural plan. “So we
don’t want to have the United States be importing clean protein in the
way that we’re currently dependent on Asia for our semiconductors and
photovoltaics,” Paul Shapiro, the company’s CEO, told me.
</p>
<p>
The Better Meat Co. produces a protein called Rhiza that’s derived from
microscopic fungi, which it then sells as an ingredient to other
companies to make either 100% animal-free meat or a meat blend. “This
isn’t an alternative protein program. It’s a
<a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3878835/dod-releases-seven-awards-for-distributed-bioindustrial-manufacturing-program/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>domestic
biomanufacturing program</u></a>,” Shapiro told me when I asked if
military funding for meat substitutes could be
<a href="https://heatmap.news/lifestyle/lab-grown-meat-trump-rfk" target="_self"><u>at
risk under Trump</u></a>. Looking at some of the other companies that
got grants through the same program, he said, “it’s literally like bio
manufacturing things for military planes and jet lubricants and chemical
catalysts for bullets.” That is, probably not Republican targets for
defunding. “It’s clearly solely about wanting the U.S. to be a leader in
biomanufacturing for the products that the world is going to depend on
in the future.”
</p>
<p>
The DOD also sees promise in numerous other clean energy technologies,
including
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/nuclear-microreactors-radiant-westinghouse-bwx-technologies" target="_self"><u>nuclear
microreactors</u></a> for their portability and ability to provide
off-grid energy in remote locations and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/northvolt-lyten-zeta" target="_self"><u>alternate
battery chemistries</u></a> that could help the U.S. move away from a
dependence on Chinese-produced lithium-ion batteries.
</p>
<p>
But despite the deep well of funding and pragmatic approach to
deployment that the Department of Defense offers, agreeing to work with
the DOD isn’t always an obvious choice. Many fear their company’s tech
could be used in ways and in wars that they oppose. In 2018, for
example, thousands of Google employees
<a href="https://static01.nyt.com/files/2018/technology/googleletter.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>signed
a letter opposing the company’s participation in Project Maven</u></a>,
a partnership with the Pentagon that uses artificial intelligence to
improve the accuracy of drone strikes. Supporters of the project said it
would lead to fewer civilian deaths, while protestors argued that Google
“should not be in the business of war.” Google did not renew the
contract. More recently, employees at
<a href="http://www.notechforapartheid.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Microsoft,
Google, and Amazon</u></a> have signed petitions opposing their
company’s provision of cloud computing and AI services to the Israeli
government.
</p>
<p>
Norcia noted that most, but not all of his employees were neutral to
positive when it came to working with the Air Force, while “for a small
minority of the company, it unfortunately was not something that they
really wanted to devote their life to.” While he understands that
perspective, Norcia does believe that Pyka’s work with the DOD is a net
positive for the world. “If you assume wars are going to keep happening
— which, unfortunately, I think is the reality — I’d rather have it be
the case that they’re more of a robot war than a human war,” he told me.
And at the end of the day, passenger planes are still the goal.
</p>
<p>
As for his team at Verne, McKlveen told me everybody was on board. “The
Defense Department has led to some of the biggest innovations of the
last century, whether that’s the internet or GPS. And our team knows
that.” Plus, even if the DOD doesn’t talk much about the climate
benefits of sustainability-focused tech, that doesn’t negate them.

2019 study</u></a> revealed that the Pentagon purchases an average of
100 million barrels of oil per year, so from that perspective, “it’s
hard to find a bigger customer that we can address,” McKlveen told me.
</p>
<p>
Norcia agreed. “I think the gains of your impact get turned way up if
you’re doing work with the DOD,” he said, “as opposed to, you know,
building an app that makes something incrementally more efficient or
more addictive.”

id="percival-everetts-james-awarded-carnegie-medal-for-fiction">Percival
Everett’s ‘James’ awarded Carnegie Medal for fiction</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — For author Percival Everett, libraries have long been a
source of knowledge and discovery and pleasure, even of the forbidden
kind.</p>
<p>“I remember making friends at age 13 with the librarian at the
University of South Carolina, and she used to let me go through the
stacks when I wasn’t supposed to,” Everett, who spent part of his
childhood in Columbia, said during a telephone interview Sunday.</p>
<p>“One of the wonderful things about libraries is that when you’re
looking for one book, it’s surrounded by other books that may not be
connected to it. That’s what you get (online) with links, but (in
libraries) no one’s decided what the links are.”</p>
<p>Everett’s latest honor comes from the country’s public libraries. On
Sunday, the American Library Association announced that Everett’s
“James” was this year’s winner of the Carnegie Medal for Excellence in
Fiction, which includes a $5,000 cash award. Kevin Fedarko’s “A Walk in
the Park: The True Story of a Spectacular Misadventure in the Grand
Canyon” was chosen for nonfiction.</p>
<p>Everett’s acclaimed reworking of Mark Twain’s “The Adventures of
Huckleberry Finn” from the perspective of Jim, Huck Finn’s enslaved
companion, has already received the National Book Award and the Kirkus
Prize and is a finalist for a National Book Critics Circle award.
“James” has even topped The New York Times fiction hardcover list, a
rare feat in recent years for a literary work that wasn’t a major book
club pick or movie tie-in.</p>
<p>“Percival Everett has written a modern masterpiece, a beautiful and
important work that offers a fresh perspective from the eyes of a
classic character,” Allison Escoto, chair of the award’s selection
committee, said in a statement. “Kevin Fedarko’s unforgettable journey
through the otherworldly depths of the Grand Canyon shows us the
triumphs and pitfalls of exploration and illuminates the many vital
lessons we can all learn from our precious natural world.”</p>
<p>Fedarko is a former Time magazine correspondent whose work also has
appeared in The New York Times and Esquire. A Pittsburgh native
fascinated by distant places, Fedarko has a long history with libraries
— Carnegie libraries. He remembers visiting two while growing up,
notably one in the suburb of Oakmont near the hairdressing salon his
parents ran. He would read biographies of historical figures from George
Washington to Daniel Boone, and otherwise think of libraries as
“important threads running through his life,” windows to a “wider
world.”</p>
<p>Now a resident of Flagstaff, Arizona, Fedarko says that he relied in
part on the library at the nearby Northern Arizona University campus for
both “A Walk in the Park” and its predecessor, also about the Grand
Canyon, “The Emerald Mile.”</p>
<p>“The library has an important and unique collection about the Grand
Canyon, and it’s the backbone of the kind of history that helps form the
framework of both books,” he says. “Neither of them could have been done
without the library.”</p>
<p>Previous winners of the medals, established in 2012 with a grant from
the Carnegie Corporation of New York, includes Donna Tartt’s “The
Goldfinch,” Colson Whitehead’s “The Underground Railroad” and Doris
Kearns Goodwin’s “The Bully Pulpit.”</p>
<p>This year’s finalists besides “James” in the fiction category were
Jiaming Tang’s “Cinema Love” and Kavin Akbar’s “Martyr!”</p>
<p>Adam Higginbotham’s “Challenger: A True Story of Heroism and Disaster
on the Edge of Space” and Emily Nussbaum’s “Cue the Sun! The Invention
of Reality TV” were the nonfiction runners-up.</p>
<p>All three fiction nominees were published by Penguin Random House and
all three nonfiction finalists by Simon &amp; Schuster.</p>

id="mel-gibsons-flight-risk-is-no.-1-at-box-office-the-brutalist-expands">Mel
Gibson’s ‘Flight Risk’ is No. 1 at box office, ‘The Brutalist’
expands</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — Critics lambasted it and audiences didn’t grade it much
better. But despite the turbulence, Mel Gibson’s “Flight Risk” managed
to open No. 1 at the box office with a modest $12 million, according to
studio estimates Sunday. </p>
<p>On a quiet weekend, even for the typically frigid movie-going month
of January, the top spot went to the Lionsgate thriller starring Mark
Wahlberg as a pilot flying an Air Marshal (Michelle Dockery) and
fugitive (Topher Grace) across Alaska. But it wasn’t a particularly
triumphant result for Gibson’s directorial follow-up to 2016’s “Hacksaw
Ridge.” Reviews (21% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and audience scores (a
“C” CinemaScore) were terrible. </p>
<p>President Donald Trump recently named Gibson a “special ambassador”
to Hollywood, along with Jon Voight and Sylvester Stallone. </p>
<p>Going into the weekend, Hollywood’s attention was more focused on the
Sundance Film Festival and on Thursday’s Oscar nominations, which were
twice postponed by the wildfires in the Los Angeles region. </p>
<p>The weekend was also a small test as to whether the once more common
Oscar “bump” that can sometimes follow nominations still exists. Most
contenders have by now completed the bulk of their theatrical runs and
are more likely to see an uptick on VOD or streaming. </p>
<p>But the weekend’s most daring gambit was A24 pushing Brady Corbet’s
“The Brutalist” a three–and-a-half-hour epic nominated for 10 Academy
Awards, into wide release. Though some executives initially greeted “The
Brutalist,” which is running with an intermission, as
“un-distributable,” Corbet has said, A24 acquired the film out of the
Venice Film Festival and it’s managed solid business, collecting $6
million in limited release. </p>
<p>In wide release, it earned $2.9 million — a far from blockbuster sum
but the best weekend yet for “The Brutalist.” </p>
<p>The audience was downright miniscule for another best-picture
nominee: RaMell Ross’ “Nickel Boys.” Innovatively shot almost entirely
in first-person POV, the Amazon MGM Studios release gathered just
$340,171 in 540 locations after expanding by 300 theaters. </p>
<p>Coming off one of the lowest Martin Luther King Jr. weekends in
years, no new releases made a major impact. </p>
<p>Steven Soderbergh’s “Presence,” a well-reviewed horror film shot from
the perspective of a ghost inside a suburban home, debuted with $3.4
million in 1,750 locations. The film, released by Neon and acquired out
of last year’s Sundance, was made for just $2 million. </p>
<p>The top spots otherwise went to holdovers. The Walt Disney Co.’s
“Mufasa: The Lion King,” in its sixth weekend of release, scored $8.7
million to hold second place. After starting slowly, the Barry
Jenkins-directed film has amassed $626.7 million globally. </p>
<p>“One of Them Days,” the Keke Palmer and SZA-led comedy from Sony
Pictures, held well in its second weekend, dropping just 32% with $8
million in ticket sales. In recent years, few comedies have found
success on the big screen, but “One of Them Days” has proven an
exception. </p>
<p>Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian
theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released
Monday. </p>

id="us-colombia-reach-migrant-deportation-deal-after-tariff-threats">US,
Colombia reach migrant deportation deal after tariff threats</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The White House announced late Sunday the United States was backing
off a series of retaliatory measures levied against Colombia, saying the
two countries had reached an agreement on U.S. flights sending Colombian
migrants back home.</p>
<p>A White House statement said the two countries agreed Colombia would
accept its migrants without restriction, including having them sent back
on U.S. military aircraft.  </p>
<p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro had earlier rejected two U.S.
military planes and said he would only accept migrants when the U.S.
treated them with dignity, including using civilian planes for
deportations.</p>
<p>The White House also said it would hold new tariffs and sanctions
against Colombia “in reserve, and not signed, unless Colombia fails to
honor this agreement.”</p>
<p>State Department visa sanctions against several Colombian officials,
as well as enhanced customs inspections would remain in place until the
first planeload of Colombian migrants lands in Colombia, the White House
said.</p>
<p>Colombia’s Foreign Ministry said late Sunday it had overcome the
impasse with the United States, and that Foreign Minister Luis Gilberto
Murillo and Colombian Ambassador to the U.S. Dnaiel García-Peña were
traveling to Washington for high-level meetings to follow up on the
agreement.</p>
<p>Colombia said it would welcome its people home and would guarantee
them decent conditions as citizens with rights.</p>
<p>The statements reversed a fast-evolving series of escalatory
statements from the leaders of the two countries, which featured U.S.
President Donald Trump announcing an immediate 25% tariff on Colombian
goods, which would rise to 50% in a week, and the suspension of visa
processing at the U.S. Embassy in Bogota.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Petro announced a 25% tariff on U.S. goods in return, saying the
United States “will never rule us.”</p>
<p>“A migrant is not a criminal and must be treated with the dignity
that a human being deserves,” Petro said. “That is why I returned the
U.S. military planes that were carrying Colombian migrants. … In
civilian planes, without being treated like criminals, we will receive
our fellow citizens.”</p>
<p>Colombia is America’s third-largest trading partner in Latin
America.</p>
<p>The row came about after U.S. authorities began arresting hundreds of
undocumented migrants per day and sending them back to their home
countries, carrying out Trump’s 2024 campaign pledge to deport masses of
migrants who have illegally entered the United States.</p>
<p>“We’re going to enforce immigration laws,” Vice President JD Vance
told CBS News’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday.</p>
<p>More than 1,000 migrants were arrested with hundreds repatriated to
other countries, including Guatemala last week, during the first days of
the new Trump administration, according to figures compiled by the U.S.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency and the White House.  </p>
<p>Watch related report by Veronica Balderas Iglesias:</p>
<p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said it made 956
arrest nationwide Sunday.</p>
<p>It did not specify how many were part of an operation focused in the
Chicago area that was witnessed by several top Trump administration
officials, including “border czar” Tom Homan.</p>
<p>ICE said in a statement it worked with other federal agencies to
conduct “enhanced targeted operations today in Chicago to enforce U.S.
immigration law and preserve public safety and national security by
keeping potentially dangerous criminal aliens out of our
communities.”</p>
<p>Homan told ABC’s “This Week” show Sunday, “There will be more arrests
nationwide.” </p>
<p>Trump authorized sending 1,500 troops to the U.S.-Mexico border, and
Homan said, “You’ll see the numbers increase. They’re down there to
create a secure border.”</p>
<p>He said the U.S. is deporting “as many as we can” arrest, with the
focus first on those convicted of U.S. crimes and then moving on to
detain and deport those whose asylum requests have been rejected by U.S.
officials.</p>
<p>“We’re in the beginning stages,” Homan said.</p>
<p>About 11 million undocumented migrants are believed to be living in
the U.S., a staggering number that most officials believe will be
impossible to deport.</p>
<p>Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a staunch Trump ally, urged his
Republican colleagues in Congress to authorize more spending for the
deportation effort.</p>
<p>“We haven’t given the Trump team the resources,” Graham said on NBC’s
“Meet the Press” show. He said Homan “needs to substantially hire more
[immigration] agents. He needs to finish the [border] wall [with Mexico]
and technology. He needs to go from 41,000 detention beds to 150,000
detention beds to make this work.”</p>
<p>“So, to my Republican colleagues, particularly in the House [of
Representatives], as we fiddle, our immigration plans are hitting walls.
We’re not building walls, we’re hitting walls. We need to give Tom Homan
the money now to execute the plan that he’s come up with. And without
congressional funding this is going to hit a wall,” Graham declared.</p>
<p>The Trump administration has stopped taking appointments for migrants
waiting in Mexico to request asylum through a mobile app, but Trump’s
anti-immigration edicts are facing legal challenges. One judge has
already temporarily blocked Trump from declaring that he no longer
recognizes constitutionally guaranteed citizenship for children of
undocumented migrants born in the United States.</p>

id="as-hegseth-takes-charge-at-pentagon-here-are-what-changes-could-be-in-store">As
Hegseth takes charge at Pentagon, here are what changes could be in
store</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — When Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth starts his first
official day on Monday morning, he will face a daunting array of issues
to tackle — from global conflicts and border security to administrative
tasks. </p>
<p>At the top of his list is addressing President Donald Trump’s
priority to strengthen the U.S. military presence along the southern
border and reviewing whether active-duty forces should be used for law
enforcement — something done rarely. </p>
<p>Dozens of other issues will compete for his attention, including
developing the Pentagon’s massive budget, decisions about aid to
Ukraine, support for the ceasefire in Gaza, troop deployments in the
Middle East. Not to mention Trump directives to rid the federal
government of diversity programs and personnel as well as moves to cut
waste and remove any lingering Biden administration backers. </p>
<p>In a message to the force shortly after he was sworn in Saturday,
Hegseth cited the challenges he sees ahead. Some are ones his
predecessors also faced, such as reorienting the military from decades
of a Middle East focus and better deterring China. Continued conflict in
the region, including the October 2023 attack on Israel by Hamas, has
made that shift impossible to execute. </p>
<p>Hegseth also told service members about other priorities, including
strengthening the defense industrial base and getting the Pentagon to
pass an audit, while ensuring that the United States remains “the
strongest and most lethal force in the world.” </p>
<p>He made an unannounced stop to the Pentagon on Saturday after the
swearing-in ceremony at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. There
was no media coverage of his arrival. The Pentagon later released an
official photo saying Hegseth was “ready to get to work on behalf of
America’s warriors.” </p>
<p>Already, support staff have been meeting with military leaders,
including Gen. CQ Brown Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. But
Hegseth will get to experience what many describe as “drinking from a
firehose” as he works to quickly get up to speed on what his 2.1 million
service members and 780,000 civilians in the department are doing. Among
them are tens of thousands serving overseas, including in combat
zones. </p>
<p>Then there are the cultural issues that Hegseth railed on as a media
personality that did not make it into Hegseth’s message to the military.
Many expect they will surface in the coming days. </p>
<p>Here are some key issues that Hegseth, who was confirmed in a
tiebreaking vote Friday by Vice President JD Vance, will face right
away: </p>
<p>Border deployments </p>
<p>In trying to meet Trump’s demand of securing the border, Hegseth will
face a barrage of information about what troops are available, what
assistance the Border Patrol needs and where, as well as how to house,
feed and transport the troops and border personnel and how to ensure
none of this affects other national security requirements. </p>
<p>One of his first big decisions is whether he will recommend that
active-duty troops deployed to the border become involved in law
enforcement, a move that military leaders in recent years have pushed to
avoid. </p>
<p>Active-duty forces are prohibited from doing law enforcement duties
on U.S. soil under the Posse Comitatus Act. Trump has signed an
executive order directing that his defense and homeland security
secretaries report back within 90 days on whether they think he should
invoke the 1807 law called the Insurrection Act, which allows troops to
be used for civilian law enforcement on U.S. soil during
emergencies. </p>
<p>During previous deployments, troops have been used for
transportation, intelligence, logistics, wall-building and other support
tasks, freeing up the Border Patrol to interact with migrants and
conduct the law enforcement duties.</p>
<p>Transgender troops</p>
<p>In his first executive order, Trump again stripped protections for
transgender troops that Democratic President Joe Biden had restored
after Trump banned those members from serving during his first term in
office. </p>
<p>The ban previously faced legal challenges, and lawyers who
represented transgender forces last time are readying to take it up in
the courts again. While Trump has not announced a ban, his decision to
revoke protections is seen as a first step toward that. </p>
<p>It is unclear how many troops would be affected. The Defense
Department has no exact figure on the number of transgender troops
serving because not every transgender person is in the same state of
medical transition and not every transgender person identifies as such
in military paperwork. </p>
<p>The department has referred queries on how many transgender troops
there are to the services; the services have said they have no way to
track. </p>
<p>The budget and Ukraine </p>
<p>Hegseth will have to become familiar with the complicated
construction of the Pentagon budget, which right now is about $850
billion. Trump ran on a vow to make the U.S. military more lethal —
something Hegseth has echoed. But they also have spoken extensively
about cutting waste. </p>
<p>So Hegseth’s imprint on the budget will be studied to determine how
that’s being done. </p>
<p>Woven into those discussions will be security assistance to Ukraine.
The State Department has ordered a freeze on new funding for almost all
U.S. foreign aid, and there was no indication of a waiver for military
assistance for Ukraine like there was for Israel and Egypt. </p>
<p>The Biden administration provided Kyiv with more than $66 billion in
military aid and weapons during the war with Russia. It had left unspent
about $3.85 billion in congressionally authorized funding to send more
weapons to Ukraine from existing U.S. stockpiles — a sum that is not
affected by the foreign aid freeze. But it is now up to Hegseth and
Trump to decide whether or not to spend it, and Trump hasn’t said what
he will do on Ukraine aid.</p>
<p>Diversity, equity and inclusion rollbacks</p>
<p>Hegseth will take over the Pentagon’s push to implement Trump’s
executive order to get rid of DEI programs, coming as military officers
fret over whether they will be fired for being “woke,” as Hegseth has
pledged to do. </p>
<p>During his Senate hearing, Hegseth affirmed his commitment to focus
on lethality and to eliminate wokeness, arguing that DEI policies
“divide” troops and do not prioritize “meritocracy.” </p>
<p>Officials said the Defense Department doesn’t have any full-time
workers assigned to DEI so they don’t expect to have to fire people, as
other federal agencies have. </p>
<p>But senior leaders have been poring over their websites to delete
pages that mention diversity. Lacking clear guidance, staffers were
pulling websites down in often inconsistent ways. The Army, for example,
temporarily removed its sexual assault guidelines before they later came
back online. </p>
<p>Hegseth also has railed against women in combat in his books and on
podcasts and said standards were lowered for them, which is not true. He
has since toned down his criticism after substantial pushback from
lawmakers. </p>
<p>He most recently told senators that he’s not aware that Trump wants
to roll back the decision to allow women to serve in all combat jobs.
Instead, he has talked about doing a review of standards.</p>
<p>Reproductive care</p>
<p>After the Supreme Court in 2022 ended constitutional protections for
abortion that were set out in Roe v. Wade, then-Defense Secretary Lloyd
Austin came out with a policy that would allow service members to take
leave and be reimbursed for travel expenses to obtain reproductive care
— including abortions and in-vitro fertilization — if the military base
they were assigned to was in a state that had banned that care. </p>
<p>It’s not clear whether Hegseth will seek to further revise that
policy to remove the reimbursement provisions. It has been only scarcely
used, and the department does not break down what the travel was for due
to medical privacy laws.</p>

wait to return to northern Gaza, Trump urges Jordan, Egypt to take
Palestinians</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Cairo — Tens of thousands of Palestinians waited, blocked on the
road, to return to their homes in northern Gaza on Sunday, voicing
frustration after Israel accused Hamas of breaching a ceasefire
agreement and refused to open crossing points. </p>
<p>A day after a second exchange of Israeli hostages held in Gaza for
Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, the holdup underlined the risks
hanging over the truce between the militant group and Israel, longtime
adversaries in a series of Gaza wars. </p>
<p>In central areas of Gaza, columns of people were waiting along the
main roads leading north, some in vehicles and some on foot, witnesses
said. </p>
<p>“A sea of people is waiting for a signal to move back to Gaza City
and the north, people are fed up and they want to go home,” said Tamer
Al-Burai, a displaced person from Gaza City. “This is the deal that was
signed, isn’t it?” </p>
<p>“Many of those people have no idea whether their houses back home are
still standing. But they want to go regardless, they want to put up the
tents next to the rubble of their houses, they want to feel home,” he
told Reuters via a chat app. </p>
<p>On Sunday, witnesses said many people had slept overnight on the
Salahuddin Road, the main thoroughfare running north to south and on the
coastal road leading north, waiting to go past the Israeli military
positions in the Netzarim corridor running across the center of the Gaza
Strip. </p>
<p>Vehicles, trucks and rickshaws were overloaded with mattresses, food,
and with the tents that used to shelter them for over a year in the
central and southern areas of the enclave, and volunteers were
distributing water and food. </p>
<p>Under the agreement worked out with Egyptian and Qatari mediators and
backed by the United States, Israel was meant to allow Palestinians
displaced from the homes in the north to return to their homes. </p>
<p>But Israel said that Hamas’ failure to hand over a list detailing
which of the hostages scheduled for release is alive or to hand over
Arbel Yehud, an Israeli woman taken hostage during the Hamas attack on
Israel on October 7, 2023 meant it had violated the agreement. </p>
<p>As a result, checkpoints in the central Gaza Strip would not be
opened to allow crossings into the northern Gaza Strip, it said in a
statement. Hamas issued a statement accusing Israel of stalling and
holding it responsible for the delay. </p>
<p>‘Demolition site’ </p>
<p>On Saturday, U.S. President Donald Trump instructed the U.S. military
to release 2,000-pound bombs that his predecessor, Joe Biden, had
ordered to be withheld from delivery to Israel over concern about their
impact on the civilian population of Gaza. </p>
<p>He also called on Egypt and Jordan to take on more Palestinians from
Gaza either temporarily or permanently, saying “we should just clear out
the whole thing.” </p>
<p>“It’s literally a demolition site, almost everything is demolished
and people are dying there,” he told reporters after a call with
Jordan’s King Abdullah. </p>
<p>An official of Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that runs Gaza,
reacted with suspicion to the remarks, echoing longstanding Palestinian
fears about being driven permanently from their homes. </p>
<p>Palestinians “will not accept any offers or solutions, even if [such
offers] appear to have good intentions under the guise of
reconstruction, as announced in the proposals of U.S. President Trump,”
Basem Naim, a member of the Hamas political bureau, told Reuters. </p>
<p>Al-Awda Hospital officials said four people were wounded by Israeli
fire, from soldiers apparently trying to prevent people coming too
close. </p>
<p>The Israeli military issued warnings to Palestinians not to approach
its positions in Gaza and said soldiers had fired warning shots on
several occasions but said “as of now, we are unaware of any harm caused
to the suspects as a result of the shooting.”</p>

id="trump-discussing-tiktok-purchase-with-multiple-people-decision-in-30-days">Trump
discussing TikTok purchase with multiple people; decision in 30
days</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE — U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday
he was in talks with multiple people over buying TikTok and would likely
have a decision on the popular app’s future in the next 30 days.</p>
<p>“I have spoken to many people about TikTok and there is great
interest in TikTok,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One during a
flight to Florida.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, Reuters reported two people with knowledge of the
discussions said Trump’s administration is working on a plan to save
TikTok that involves tapping software company Oracle and a group of
outside investors to effectively take control of the app’s
operations.</p>
<p>Under the deal being negotiated by the White House, TikTok’s
China-based owner, ByteDance, would retain a stake in the company, but
data collection and software updates would be overseen by Oracle, which
already provides the foundation of TikTok’s Web infrastructure, one of
the sources told Reuters.</p>
<p>However, in his comments to reporters on the flight, Trump said he
had not spoken to Oracle’s Larry Ellison about buying the app.</p>
<p>Asked if he was putting together a deal with Oracle and other
investors to save TikTok, Trump said: “No, not with Oracle. Numerous
people are talking to me, very substantial people, about buying it and I
will make that decision probably over the next 30 days. Congress has
given 90 days. If we can save TikTok, I think it would be a good
thing.”</p>
<p>The sources did say the terms of any potential deal with Oracle were
fluid and likely to change. One source said the full scope of the
discussions was not yet set and could include the U.S. operations as
well as other regions.</p>
<p>National Public Radio on Saturday reported the deal talks for
TikTok’s global operations, citing two people with knowledge of the
negotiations. Oracle had no immediate comment.</p>
<p>The deal being negotiated anticipates participation from ByteDance’s
current U.S. investors, according to the sources. Jeff Yass’s
Susquehanna International Group, General Atlantic, Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts and Sequoia Capital are among ByteDance’s U.S. backers.</p>
<p>Representatives for TikTok, ByteDance investors General Atlantic,
KKR, Sequoia and Susquehanna could not immediately be reached for
comment.</p>
<p>Others vying to acquire TikTok, including the investor group led by
billionaire Frank McCourt and another involving Jimmy Donaldson, better
known as the YouTube star Mr. Beast, are not part of the Oracle
negotiation, one of the sources said.</p>
<p>Oracle responsible</p>
<p>Under the terms of the deal, Oracle would be responsible for
addressing national security issues. TikTok initially struck a deal with
Oracle in 2022 to store U.S. users’ information to alleviate
Washington’s worries about Chinese government interference.</p>
<p>TikTok’s management would remain in place, to operate the short video
app, according to one of the sources.</p>
<p>The app, which is used by 170 million Americans, was taken offline
temporarily for users shortly before a law that said it must be sold by
ByteDance on national security grounds, or be banned, took effect on
Jan. 19.</p>
<p>Trump, after taking office a day later, signed an executive order
seeking to delay by 75 days the enforcement of the law that was put in
place after U.S. officials warned that under ByteDance, there was a risk
of Americans’ data being misused.</p>
<p>Officials from Oracle and the White House held a meeting on Friday
about a potential deal, and another meeting has been scheduled for next
week, NPR reported.</p>
<p>Oracle was interested in a TikTok stake “in the tens of billions,”
but the rest of the deal is in flux, the NPR report cited the source as
saying.</p>
<p>Trump has said he “would like the United States to have a 50%
ownership position in a joint venture” in TikTok.</p>
<p>NPR cited another source as saying that appeasing Congress is seen as
a key hurdle by the White House.</p>
<p>Free speech advocates have opposed TikTok’s ban under a law passed by
the U.S. Congress and signed by former President Joe Biden.</p>
<p>The company has said U.S. officials have misstated its ties to China,
arguing its content recommendation engine and user data are stored in
the United States on cloud servers operated by Oracle while content
moderation decisions that affect American users are also made in the
U.S.</p>

id="rubio-threatens-bounties-on-taliban-leaders-over-detained-americans">Rubio
threatens bounties on Taliban leaders over detained Americans</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Saturday
threatened bounties on the heads of Afghanistan’s Taliban leaders,
sharply escalating the tone as he said more Americans may be detained in
the country than previously thought.</p>
<p>The threat comes days after the Afghan Taliban government and the
United States swapped prisoners in one of the final acts of former U.S.
President Joe Biden.</p>
<p>The new top U.S. diplomat issued the harsh warning via social media,
in a rhetorical style strikingly similar to his boss, President Donald
Trump.</p>
<p>“Just hearing the Taliban is holding more American hostages than has
been reported,” Rubio wrote on X.</p>
<p>“If this is true, we will have to immediately place a VERY BIG bounty
on their top leaders, maybe even bigger than the one we had on bin
Laden,” he said, referring to the al-Qaida leader killed by U.S. forces
in 2011.</p>
<p>Rubio did not describe who the other Americans may be, but there have
long been accounts of missing Americans whose cases were not formally
taken up by the U.S. government as wrongful detentions.</p>
<p>In the deal with the Biden administration, the Taliban freed the
best-known American detained in Afghanistan, Ryan Corbett, who had been
living with his family in the country and was seized in August 2022.</p>
<p>Also freed was William McKenty, an American about whom little
information has been released.</p>
<p>The United States in turn freed Khan Mohammed, who was serving a life
sentence in a California prison.</p>
<p>Mohammed was convicted of trafficking heroin and opium into the
United States and was accused of seeking rockets to kill U.S. troops in
Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The United States offered a bounty of $25 million for information
leading to the capture or killing of Osama bin Laden shortly after the
September 11, 2001, terror attacks, with Congress later authorizing the
secretary of state to offer up to $50 million.</p>
<p>No one is believed to have collected the bounty for bin Laden, who
was killed in a U.S. raid in Pakistan.</p>
<p>Harder line on Taliban?</p>
<p>Trump is known for brandishing threats in his speeches and on social
media. But he is also a critic of U.S. military interventions overseas
and in his second inaugural address Monday said he aspired to be a
“peacemaker.”</p>
<p>In his first term, the Trump administration broke a then-taboo and
negotiated directly with the Taliban – with Trump even proposing a
summit with the then-insurgents at the Camp David presidential retreat –
as he brokered a deal to pull U.S. troops and end America’s longest
war.</p>
<p>Biden carried out the agreement, with the Western-backed government
swiftly collapsing and the Taliban retaking power in August 2021 just
after U.S. troops left.</p>
<p>The scenes of chaos in Kabul brought strong criticism of Biden,
especially when 13 American troops and scores of Afghans died in a
suicide bombing at the city’s airport.</p>
<p>The Biden administration had low-level contacts with Taliban
government representatives but made little headway.</p>
<p>Some members of Trump’s Republican Party criticized even the limited
U.S. engagements with the Taliban government and especially the
humanitarian assistance authorized by the Biden administration, which
insisted the money was for urgent needs in the impoverished country and
never routed through the Taliban.</p>
<p>Rubio on Friday froze nearly all U.S. aid around the world.</p>
<p>No country has officially recognized the Taliban government, which
has imposed severe restrictions on women and girls under its
ultra-conservative interpretation of Islam.</p>
<p>The International Criminal Court’s chief prosecutor on Thursday said
he was seeking arrest warrants for senior Taliban leaders over the
persecution of women.</p>

id="rain-in-southern-california-creates-mudflows-but-helps-firefighters">Rain
in southern California creates mudflows but helps firefighters</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — More rain fell Monday on parts of southern California
after causing mudflows over the weekend, helping firefighters but
boosting the risk of toxic ash runoff in areas scorched by Los
Angeles-area wildfires.</p>
<p>Flood watches were in effect for burn areas from recent fires that
broke out around the Pacific Palisades neighborhood in Los Angeles,
Altadena and Castaic Lake, said Joe Sirard, a meteorologist for the
National Weather Service in Oxnard.</p>
<p>“All these fresh burns are very susceptible to rapid runoff,” Sirard
said, warning of even small amounts of rain in a few minutes’ time.
“What that means is we have a fairly high danger of mud and debris flows
once we get above those thresholds.”</p>
<p>Los Angeles International Airport reported a little under 2.5
centimeters of rain in a 24-hour period ending at 3 a.m. Monday, the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported. Surrounding
areas reported lesser amounts.</p>
<p>School was closed Monday for the four Malibu schools in the Santa
Monica-Malibu Unified School District “due to dangerous road conditions
and challenges with access to our schools,” school officials posted
online.</p>
<p>A portion of the Pacific Coast Highway in Los Angeles County was
closed as of Sunday afternoon due to mudflows in Topanga Canyon, the
California Department of Transportation said. Heavy snow fell in the
mountains in San Bernardino and Riverside counties.</p>
<p>One benefit that could come from the rain: It may help firefighters
who are reining in multiple wildfires after weeks of windy and dry
weather.</p>
<p>Los Angeles County crews spent much of last week removing vegetation,
shoring up slopes and reinforcing roads in devastated areas of the
Palisades and Eaton fires, which reduced entire neighborhoods to rubble
and ash after breaking out during powerful winds on Jan. 7.</p>
<p>The Palisades Fire, the largest of the blazes that destroyed
thousands of homes and killed at least 11 people, reached 90%
containment Sunday. The Eaton Fire, which broke out near Altadena and
has killed at least 16 people, was 98% contained.</p>
<p>The Hughes Fire, which ignited last week north of Los Angeles and
caused evacuation orders or warnings for more than 50,000 people, was
95% contained as of Sunday evening.</p>
<p>In San Diego County, firefighters made progress to contain the
smaller Border 2 Fire as it burned through a remote area of the Otay
Mountain Wilderness near the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>
<p>Most of the region was forecast to get about an inch of precipitation
over several days, but the weather service warned of a risk of localized
cloudbursts causing mud and debris to flow down hills.</p>
<p>“So the problem would be if one of those showers happens to park
itself over a burn area,” weather service meteorologist Carol Smith said
on social media. “That could be enough to create debris flows.”</p>
<p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass issued an executive order last week to
expedite cleanup efforts and mitigate the environmental impacts of
fire-related pollutants. LA County supervisors also approved an
emergency motion to install flood-control infrastructure and expedite
and remove sediment in fire-impacted areas.</p>
<p>Fire crews filled sandbags for communities, while county workers
installed barriers and cleared drainage pipes and basins.</p>
<p>Officials cautioned that ash in recent burn zones was a toxic mix of
incinerated cars, electronics, batteries, building materials, paints,
furniture and other household items. It contains pesticides, asbestos,
plastics and lead. Residents were urged to wear protective gear while
cleaning up.</p>
<p>Concerns about post-fire debris flows have been especially high since
2018, when the town of Montecito, up the coast from Los Angeles, was
ravaged by mudslides after a downpour hit mountain slopes burned bare by
a huge blaze. Hundreds of homes were damaged and 23 people died.</p>
<p>The rain snapped a near-record streak of dry weather for southern
California. Most of southern California is currently in “extreme
drought” or “severe drought,” according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.</p>

id="cia-covid-likely-originated-in-a-lab-but-agency-has-low-confidence-in-report">CIA:
COVID likely originated in a lab, but agency has ‘low confidence’ in
report</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The CIA now believes the virus responsible for the
COVID-19 pandemic most likely originated from a laboratory, according to
an assessment released Saturday that points the finger at China even
while acknowledging that the spy agency has “low confidence” in its own
conclusion.</p>
<p>The finding is not the result of any new intelligence, and the report
was completed at the behest of the Biden administration and former CIA
Director William Burns. It was declassified and released Saturday on the
orders of President Donald Trump’s pick to lead the agency, John
Ratcliffe, who was sworn in Thursday as director.</p>
<p>The nuanced finding suggests the agency believes the totality of
evidence makes a lab origin more likely than a natural origin. But the
agency’s assessment assigns a low degree of confidence to this
conclusion, suggesting the evidence is deficient, inconclusive or
contradictory.</p>
<p>Earlier reports on the origins of COVID-19 have split over whether
the coronavirus emerged from a Chinese lab, potentially by mistake, or
whether it arose naturally. The new assessment is not likely to settle
the debate. In fact, intelligence officials say it may never be
resolved, due to a lack of cooperation from Chinese authorities.</p>
<p>The CIA “continues to assess that both research-related and natural
origin scenarios of the COVID-19 pandemic remain plausible,” the agency
wrote in a statement about its new assessment.</p>
<p>Instead of new evidence, the conclusion was based on fresh analyses
of intelligence about the spread of the virus, its scientific properties
and the work and conditions of China’s virology labs.</p>
<p>Lawmakers have pressured America’s spy agencies for more information
about the origins of the virus, which led to lockdowns, economic
upheaval and millions of deaths. It’s a question with significant
domestic and geopolitical implications as the world continues to grapple
with the pandemic’s legacy.</p>
<p>Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, chairman of the Senate
Intelligence Committee, said Saturday he was “pleased the CIA concluded
in the final days of the Biden administration that the lab-leak theory
is the most plausible explanation,” and he commended Ratcliffe for
declassifying the assessment.</p>
<p>“Now, the most important thing is to make China pay for unleashing a
plague on the world,” Cotton said in a statement.</p>
<p>China’s embassy in Washington did not immediately return messages
seeking comment. Chinese authorities have in the past dismissed
speculation about COVID’s origins as unhelpful and motivated by
politics.</p>
<p>While the origin of the virus remains unknown, scientists think the
most likely hypothesis is that it circulated in bats, like many
coronaviruses, before infecting another species, probably racoon dogs,
civet cats or bamboo rats. In turn, the infection spread to humans
handling or butchering those animals at a market in Wuhan, where the
first human cases appeared in late November 2019.</p>
<p>Some official investigations, however, have raised the question of
whether the virus escaped from a lab in Wuhan. Two years ago, a report
by the Energy Department concluded a lab leak was the most likely
origin, though that report also expressed low confidence in the
finding.</p>
<p>The same year then-FBI Director Christopher Wray said his agency
believed the virus “most likely” spread after escaping from a lab.</p>
<p>Ratcliffe, who served as director of national intelligence during
Trump’s first term, has said he favors the lab leak scenario, too.</p>
<p>“The lab leak is the only theory supported by science, intelligence,
and common sense,” Ratcliffe said in 2023.</p>
<p>The CIA said it will continue to evaluate any new information that
could change its assessment.</p>

id="haitian-leader-trump-administrations-deportation-plans-will-be-catastrophic">Haitian
leader: Trump administration’s deportation plans will be
‘catastrophic’</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ROME — The president of Haiti’s transitional presidential council
said the Trump administration’s decisions to freeze aid programs, deport
migrants and block refugees will be “catastrophic” for Haiti.</p>
<p>Leslie Voltaire made the comment in an interview with The Associated
Press in Rome on Saturday following a meeting with Pope Francis at the
Vatican. He visited the pope to ask for help for Haiti.</p>
<p>“I’m knocking on the doors of people who love Haiti. The pope loves
Haiti, and he is eager to help,” Haiti’s interim president said.</p>
<p>The pontiff and Voltaire discussed the dire situation in Haiti where
gangs have killed civilians and operate across the Caribbean nation with
impunity. Half of Haiti’s 11.4 million people are already hungry,
according to Voltaire, and losing humanitarian assistance will make the
situation dramatically worse.</p>
<p>“Trump said that Haiti is a ‘shithole,’ so I don’t think he will care
about Haiti,” Voltaire said, noting that thousands of people are already
being repatriated from the Dominican Republic every week and gangs are
terrorizing the populace. With the new U.S. policies, “the situation
will be catastrophic.”</p>
<p>During his first administration, President Donald Trump used blunt
language to question why the U.S. would accept immigrants from Haiti and
other countries in Africa. At the time, the White House did not deny his
remark but issued a statement saying Trump supports immigration policies
that welcome “those who can contribute to our society.”</p>
<p>Voltaire said there are roughly 1.5 million Haitians in the United
States and roughly 150,000 who were accepted under a program called the
“Temporary Protection System.”</p>
<p>“Trump says that he will expel all of them,” Voltaire said, adding
that Haiti, which is already struggling with hunger and internally
displaced people, cannot handle the influx.</p>
<p>In a report released this month, the U.N. migration agency said
internal displacement within Haiti has tripled over the last year and
now surpasses 1 million people. The situation has been largely caused by
gang violence in the Caribbean country. The new figure provided by the
International Organization for Migration represents a record for
Haiti.</p>
<p>IOM said that “relentless gang violence” in Haitian capital of
Port-au-Prince has fueled a near-doubling of displacement in the city
and a collapse of health care and other services and worsening food
insecurity. About 200,000 people have been forcibly returned to Haiti
over the last year mostly from the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>Voltaire and his transitional government have been tasked with
leading the country to general elections, an elusive goal but he is
convinced they can make it happen by next November despite powerful
gangs that rule 85% of the capital and are gaining ground in surrounding
areas.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Voltaire is positive that — if Haiti’s multinational
police force is boosted with several thousand additional officers — they
can go ahead with elections this year.</p>
<p>Kenya is leading the multinational police force with a total
deployment of more than 600, below the 1,000 officers the country’s
president pledged. An additional 150 Guatemalans and an advance team of
eight Salvadorean troops have also arrived, but the force remains far
below its anticipated strength of 2,500 officers. Voltaire said Benin
has pledged an additional 2,000 soldiers.</p>
<p>“We have to do a referendum on a new constitution and also the
election at the end of November. I say that we can do the elections
because we have like eight departments, like 80% of the country. We can
do the election.”</p>
<p>The power of gangs in Haiti has grown since the 2021 assassination of
President Jovenel Moïse. Some gangs have even indicated they want to be
part of the political process. Voltaire excluded that possibility, “I
don’t think they should be around the table.”</p>
<p>More than 5,600 people were reported killed across Haiti last year,
according to the United Nations. The number of killings increased by
more than 20% compared with all of 2023, according to the U.N. Human
Rights Office.</p>
