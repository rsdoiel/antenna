**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-06-27, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

BTW, I think the right way to read Scripting News is getting the nightly email. That's the pulse. I jot stuff down during the day, mostly in the morning, and later add links and finish stuff up. The scripting.com feed is updated in realtime. So you may get many versions of an item over the course of a day, which might be a problem with feed readers that don't watch for changes. I noticed that my changes to my podcast shownotes page don't flow back out to Pocket Casts, which is the client I use on my Android phone. FeedLand btw, records changes, and they flow through to the timeline. Coupled with rssCloud, which is supported in every WordPress site, makes the whole thing realtime. People assume that feeds have to perform like a feed reader. But if you have a component running on the open internet, hooked up via websockets to the client, you get the flow they get in twitter-like systems. And the thing is we didn't have to invent anything that didn't already exist in 2009.

I'm working my way through The Bear, and it's great because you remember that you love all these characters and you can immediately start living the ongoing drama of their lives. The scene they paint is intriguing. I feel like a cat perched on a window watching everyone doing their daily stuff. Looking forward to going back to the beginning and starting over.

## ★ More on Apple’s Trust-Eroding ‘F1 The Movie’ Wallet Ad

date: 2025-06-27, updated: 2025-06-27, from: Daring Fireball

Sending this ad is completely destructive to all the hard work other teams at Apple have done to make Apple Wallet actually private — and, more importantly, *to get users to believe that it’s private*.

## The Age of Integrity

date: 2025-06-27, updated: 2025-06-26, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>We need to talk about data integrity.</p>
<p>Narrowly, the term refers to ensuring that data isn’t tampered with, either in transit or in storage. Manipulating account balances in bank databases, removing entries from criminal records, and murder by removing notations about allergies from medical records are all integrity attacks.</p>
<p>More broadly, integrity refers to ensuring that data is correct and accurate from the point it is collected, through all the ways it is used, modified, transformed, and eventually deleted. Integrity-related incidents include malicious actions, but also inadvertent mistakes...</p>

And doesn’t understand the leadership <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/01/152316.html?title=whatWouldCuomoDo">Cuomo</a> uniquely provided at the height of Covid. It’s pretty likely what’s <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg430dx702o">starting</a> in NYC will be worse than Covid or 9-11. Funny thing is Krugman <i>did</i> get it, a few weeks ago when the crisis in Los Angeles was peaking. He wrote a <a href="https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/this-is-not-a-drill">piece</a> that was terrified, and realistic. The National Guard had been nationalized. Marines were invading California. But now that Calif hasn't been in the news, it's easy to swing back. I bet if the election had happened during the worst of it, Cuomo would've won.

## Productivity traps I fall into regularly

date: 2025-06-26, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>There’s some productivity traps I fall into on a regular basis. They all tie into my personal flavor of ADHD but it’s not totally fair to blame the ol’ meat-wad brain when I know when, where, and why it happens.</p>
<ol>
<li>There’s a Big Thing to do, so I can’t do anything else</li>
<li>Boredom in meetings leads internet wanderings</li>
<li>I should blog this real quick turns into work avoidance</li>
</ol>
<h2>The Big Thing…</h2>
<p>One of my ADHD quirks is that if there’s a Big Thing to do that day (doctor’s appointment, package delivery, big presentation) then 100% of my brain goes to that important event. I can’t miss it. Nothing else gets done until The Big Thing gets done.</p>
<p>Conversely, after The Big Thing gets done, nothing else gets done either because my brain –flooded with dopamine– feels an enormous sense of accomplishment for remembering to do The Big Thing. I did The Big Thing. The Big Thing is done. Mission accomplished.</p>
<p>Completing that big task should free up new brain RAM allocation for the next task… but it doesn’t work that way. I spent so much energy keeping the horses in the barn, my brain won’t even consider letting them out again until much later in the evening. Hands numb from sitting on them try to grab a new task from the shelf, but can’t.</p>
<p>If anyone deals with this and knows how to either a) make The Big Thing less blocking or b) perform a tactial reset after The Big Thing, I’d love to know.</p>
<h2>Boredom in meetings…</h2>
<p>I have a bad habit where I get dopamine starved in a meeting and I naturally hop over to YouTube and start queuing up interesting videos. This regrettably creates a backlog of open tabs for me to clear out when I’m out of the meeting. This isn’t good. It’s so bad because I’ll even look for other videos to watch <em>while I’m watching a video</em>. Why do I do this to myself?</p>
<p>I need to reprogram my brain to smell boredom and find dopamine another –more temporary– way. I used to speed cube during meetings, that was probably my most successful era of doing meetings. I should try and go back to that. Or 3D print a bunch of fidgets. I bought a big drawing pad at Five Below and put it next to my desk and have had a little success sketching during meetings, but YouTube and social media are so damn convenient.</p>
<p>It’s not just video, it happens with blog posts too. One social media link. Links to another link. Links to another. Now I have 5,000 tabs. Oof.</p>
<p><a href="https://daverupert.com/2025/01/raycast-focus/">Focus</a> tools to block social media sites has been effective, but any other strategies I need to know about?</p>
<h2>Blog this real quick…</h2>
<p>If I ever think about something too much and it’s blogpost-worthy content, I try to fire up a draft to get the idea out of my head. If I can create a rough outline in my second brain now, I can come back to it later… but it’s a worm hole.</p>
<p>While the intent is to capture the idea, I naturally switch into writing mode trying to fill out sentences and shape paragraphs. I think it’s dopamine starvation again. When I’m writing in my note taking app, I’m in a fun place where I’m a high functioning adult and the desire to go back to trudging through thousands of lines of JSON is low in comparison.</p>
<p>Of all these productivity traps, writing a blog post is the least offensive to me. Writing ideas helps cement knowledge and that’s a good thing for a knowledge worker. It also keeps a skill I use at work (writing) sharp. But when it’s a form of escapism from what I actually need to do, I need to find efficient ways to curb that behavior. Time-boxing seems like a good idea here.</p>
<h2>Here be dragons</h2>
<p>I’m sharing these traps in the hope that I become more cognizant and accountable to myself. I can almost see myself falling down these traps in a third-person over camera angle. “The Big Thing” probably gets me the most often, I’d love to overcome it.</p>
<p>I’m curious about other brains. Have you found other traps I need to know about? Do you embrace the chaos and let the day fall apart? Do you have systems built up to self-correct?</p>

Here's what I say. Forget about ever rising from the ashes of what remains of the party. Right now, the issue is how to defend the city from the coming war with the US government. They're already holding the current mayor hostage. This will be worse than 9-11 and Covid. We have no leadership. We're totally fucked, what the Democratic Party does or doesn't do, at this point, simply doesn't matter.

Before we moved to Flushing when I was in 5th grade, we lived on 92nd St and 34th Ave. What a difference that must make.

## Finding Frontier

date: 2025-06-25, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I tried an experiment, <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/06/25/asfarasyoucango.png">go back</a> as far as I can in archive.org on scripting.com and see where it gets me. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19961114163115/http://scripting.com/">first try</a> got me to a classified ads site I was experimenting with in mid-November 1996. A few weeks later, on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19961203224609/http://scripting.com/">December 3,</a> there was a colorful directory that took you to all the sub-sites on the server, DaveNet, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19961203224624/http://www.scripting.com/frontier/">Frontier</a>, Classified ads, our Midas Website (Macintosh Internet Developers Association), DocServer, a BBS, and Guestbook.  </p>
<p>I went digging around in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19961203224624/http://www.scripting.com/frontier/">Frontier</a> part. Lots of stuff there. By then we had been working on Frontier for eight years. It had been reborn once, from a Mac-focused single-user scripting environment to a networked one, all because the web had exploded and Apple didn't want us making system software for their platform. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span> </p>
<p>BTW, some of this stuff is <a href="http://scripting.com/frontier/olddefault.html">still here</a>. </p>
<p>There are lots of paths to try out.</p>
<p>This was where my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19961203224710/http://www.scripting.com/frontier/news.html">blog home page</a> was then. </p>
<p>Then to DaveNet, and in the left margin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19961203224727/http://www.scripting.com/davenet/aboutthiswebsite.html">Nerd's guide to this website</a>. </p>
<p>I love the screen shots that show what a good match the Frontier object database was to the way a website is organized.  </p>

## Inverse text-sizing based on text-length with attr()

date: 2025-06-25, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>Text reflow on the web has an interesting relationship with Responsive Web Design. As a column gets smaller text wraps and becomes taller<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>. But for large format display text, that’s not always what you want<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>. What I’ve wanted for awhile now is a way to inversely size text based on the text length (where the font-size gets smaller as the heading gets longer).</p>
<p>I’ve been chasing the white whale of responsive text-sizing for over a decade and I think I’ve got my best attempt to-date with the new <code>attr()</code> upgrades that landed in CSS (Chromium-only at time of writing).</p>
<p class="codepen" data-height="400" data-default-tab="result" data-slug-hash="jEPbMqp" data-pen-title="inverse text-sizing with attr" data-user="davatron5000" style="height: 400px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;">
  <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/davatron5000/pen/jEPbMqp">
  inverse text-sizing with attr</a> by Dave Rupert (<a href="https://codepen.io/davatron5000">@davatron5000</a>)
  on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>
<p>CSS’s <code>attr()</code> function got an upgrade this year where you can use it independent of <code>content</code> in pseudo-elements. They also added the ability to cast types to the values. Before that change all attributes were text strings and if you tried to use it in a <code>calc()</code> function, CSS would bail because you can’t multiply a pixel by a text string. With the new upgraded <code>attr()</code> function you can specify a type in the new <code>type()</code> function as the second parameter of <code>attr()</code>: <code>attr(foo type(&lt;number&gt;))</code> .</p>
<p>Having these pieces of technology in place lets us mix in HTML attributes to our CSS math.</p>
<div class="language-css highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="css"><span class="nt">h1</span> <span class="p">{</span>

  <span class="py">--min-font-size</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">1.2rem</span><span class="p">;</span>

  <span class="nl">font-size</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">clamp</span><span class="p">(</span>
	  <span class="n">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">--min-font-size</span><span class="p">),</span> 
	  <span class="n">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">--max-font-size</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="err">*</span> <span class="n">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">--ratio</span><span class="p">),</span> 
	  <span class="n">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">--max-font-size</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>We start with an <code>--ideal-cpl</code>, which is a typographic notion that there’s an ideal line-length at or near 66 characters per line and perhaps smaller on mobile (source: <a href="https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/optimal-line-length-for-readability/">UXPin</a>). Headings are probably less. We take that number and divide it by <code>--numchars</code> from our <code>data-numchars</code> attribute to get a ratio to multiply our text by (e.g. <code>45cpl / 60numchars = 0.75</code> or <code>45cpl / 30numchars = 1.5</code>).</p>
<p>Then set some min/max variables and chuck it all into a <code>clamp()</code> function to enforce some limits. Anything under the <code>--ideal-cpl</code> will clamped to the <code>--max-font-size</code> and titles over the <code>--ideal-cpl</code> will shrink down until they hit the <code>--min-font-size</code>.</p>
<p>To help with graceful degradation in unsupported browsers (Safari, Firefox), we need to use the CSSOM <code>@property</code> syntax to typecast our <code>--numchars</code> custom property. This is a hint to browsers like Mobile Safari that <code>--numchars</code> is going to be a <code>&lt;number&gt;</code> and we can set a fallback value as well.</p>
<div class="language-css highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="css"><span class="c">/* Property used to provide fallback to other browsers */</span>
<span class="k">@property</span> <span class="n">--numchars</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="py">syntax</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">"&lt;number&gt;"</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="py">inherits</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">false</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="py">initial-value</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">45</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c">/* set to same value as --ideal-cpl */</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Hopefully the “magic” here is pretty easy to understand but for completion’s sake, you’ll need to add <code>data-numchars</code> to your HTML to make this work.</p>
<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;h1</span> <span class="na">data-numchars=</span><span class="s">"71"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur
  adipisicing elit. Vitae, maxime.
<span class="nt">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Templating languages can help. Here’s what I do in my Liquid templates for Jekyll:</p>
<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="ruby">
<span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">h1</span> <span class="n">data</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">numchars</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"{{ title.size }}"</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">{{</span> <span class="n">title</span> <span class="p">}}</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sr">/h1&gt;

</span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>If you don’t have access to your template but somehow have access to JavaScript, you can do something this:</p>
<div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="js"><span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">querySelectorAll</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">h1</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">forEach</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">el</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> 
	<span class="nx">el</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">dataset</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">numchars</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">el</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">textContent</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">length</span>
<span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>I’ve went ahead and rolled this technique out on my entire site and made a <a href="/all-titles">All Titles</a> page where I can tweak variables to my liking. The result is I get to keep my chonky headlines on mobile, but almost no heading wrap more than three lines. One improvement might be to use more CSS math to snap to different short/medium/long sizes, so its less cacophonous… but on my site you only see one display title at a time, so it’s less of a big deal.</p>
<h2>Scaling text responsi<del>ve</del>bly</h2>
<p>With all that in place, we have a HTML/CSS-based solution for responsive text-sizing with minimal overhead, no JS required, no extra DOM, and a graceful degradation to older browsers. I intentionally kept this dumb to allow for text wrapping, but <a href="https://codepen.io/paulirish/pen/YPXyxeZ">Paul Irish forked me</a> to make a <code>contenteditable</code> demo work edge-to-edge like Kizu’s <a href="https://kizu.dev/fit-to-width/">Fit-to-Width</a> or Zach Leatherman’s old <a href="https://github.com/zachleat/BigText">BigText</a> jQuery plugin.</p>
<p class="codepen" data-height="400" data-default-tab="result" data-slug-hash="YPXyxeZ" data-pen-title="inverse text-sizing with attr - bigtext.js style - contenteditable dealio" data-user="paulirish" style="height: 400px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;">
  <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/paulirish/pen/YPXyxeZ">
  inverse text-sizing with attr - bigtext.js style - contenteditable dealio</a> by Paul Irish (<a href="https://codepen.io/paulirish">@paulirish</a>)
  on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>
<p>Impressive. There’s lots of ways to resize text responsively and I’ve added another one to the pile, so here’s a little guide with how I’m thinking about all the options.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you want <em>exact</em> edge-to-edge text-sizing I’d probably recommend Kizu’s clever Fit-to-Width technique.</li>
<li>If you (and your designers) are okay with not-so-exact edge-to-edge sizing, Paul’s approach seems like a good candidate.</li>
<li>Don’t forget about SVG. Converting display text to outlines in Figma and exporting as SVG is also a nice option for exact fitting text one-offs, but doesn’t localize well.</li>
<li>If you want text to scale-inversely to its length but still wrap, use the approach in this post.</li>
<li>If you want text to be a bit more fluid between breakpoints, use <code>clamp()</code> + <code>vw</code> units.</li>
<li>If you want text to scale based on it’s parent’s width like a vector, then <strong>DON’T USE</strong> FitText and use <code>clamp(var(--min-font-size), 10cqi, var(--max-font-size))</code> with a CSS container instead.</li>
<li>If you want strict typographic control at every breakpoint, use <code>rem</code> or <code>px</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lots of options for scalable type out there that give type-setting control freak nerds nightmares, have fun!</p>

<p>Images have the opposite problem, wide desktop images lose hierarchy as the viewport gets smaller. And then portrait images get too much hierarchy when they scale up. <a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-backref">↩</a></p>

<p>Large format display text wrapping on mobile can even cause accessibility issues, whether it’s cognitive issue with one word per line or a motor issue where long words break the container and cause horizontal scrolling. <a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-backref">↩</a></p>

But then I remembered that's the point of a linkblog. And it flows through to the feed, and the blogroll software understands. So now I have an end-to-end linkblog.

## Generative AI as a magic system

date: 2025-06-25, from: Tracy Durnell Blog

We treat generative AI like magic&#8230; and magic systems have rules. When creating fantasy worlds, writers think about who can use magic, how magic is performed, what it&#8217;s able to do, what its constraints are, what the source of magic is, and what it costs. I&#8217;m applying a bit of reverse worldbuilding to the real [&#8230;]

## Setting up an Ubuntu Desktop installation for SSH, quickly

date: 2025-06-24, from: Jeff Geerling blog

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Setting up an Ubuntu Desktop installation for SSH, quickly</span>

            <p>I've enjoyed using Ubuntu Server's GitHub SSH pubkey importer for a long time, it's a quick and easy way when doing an interactive server installation to get the built-in OpenSSH server configured for remote SSH access.</p>

<p>However, many computers I work on have Ubuntu Desktop installed instead, and it doesn't even include OpenSSH Server in the default packages!</p>

<p>So I thought I'd write up a quick guide for how to set up SSH on Ubuntu Desktop pulling in my GitHub SSH public keys quickly, since I haven't found a similar guide elsewhere:</p>

<h2>Install OpenSSH</h2>

<p>Open Terminal and enter the commands:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt install openssh-server -y
sudo systemctl enable ssh
sudo systemctl start ssh
</code></pre>

<p>OpenSSH is running with Ubuntu's default configuration. You can edit the configuration inside <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> if you want (make sure to <code>systemctl restart ssh</code> after doing so).</p>

<h2>Import your GitHub public keys</h2>

<p>Ubuntu includes a handy utility that does this for you:</p>

## How I make thumbnails for YouTube

date: 2025-06-24, from: Jeff Geerling blog

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">How I make thumbnails for YouTube</span>

            <p>Over on the 2nd channel, I posted a video detailing my process for making thumbnails for my YouTube channel:</p>


.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }


<p>My videos target a more technical audience—and often deal with subjects crowds like those on HN might find interesting.</p>

<p>Technical audiences don't often enjoy the feeling of being 'bamboozled', especially in subtle ways that feels like marketing or deception.</p>

<p>Therefore YouTube thumbnails are often a contentious topic. In the early days, thumbnails were just a still frame from the video, meaning it was harder (but not impossible) to 'game the system' and introduce <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickbait">clickbait</a>.</p>

He liked the idea of WordPress as the OS of the open social web. Glad that resonated. It has so much more than the other possible platforms. The others couldn't even realistically claim to be part of the web. They don't support writers very well. We're going to build slowly and deliberately around this idea, always staying open for competitors, because that's the most important thing about the web, beyond its simplicity, it <i>never</i> locks its users in. That's a deal-stopper. As I've learned how WordPress works internally, I immediately saw that they embraced the concepts of the web not just as words, but in their practice. I never hit a wall that kept me out of doing something they already did. And they also appear to never break users and developers. That's one of the basic rules of the web, it's an unchanging thing, no one can break it because everyone is a <a href="https://this.how/googleAndHttp/">guest</a>. Anyway, there is only one web. Keep that in mind. Nothing exclusive about it.

## If only DESQview/X had been launched when Quarterdeck starting talking about it

date: 2025-06-23, from: Liam on Linux

A response to an <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44353673">HN comment</a>...<br /><br />The PC press had rumours of Quarterdeck's successor to DESQview, Desqview/X, from around 1987-1988.<p>That is roughly when I entered the computer industry.<br /><br />Dv/X was remarkable tech, and if it had shipped earlier could have changed the course of the industry. Sadly, it came too late.&nbsp;Dv/X was rumoured  then, but the state of the art was OS/2 1.1, released late 1988 and the  first version of OS/2 with a GUI.</p><p>Dv/X was not released until <a href="https://winworldpc.com/product/desqview/desqview-x-1x">about 5Y later</a>...&nbsp;1992. That's the same year as Windows 3.1, but critically, Windows 3.0 was in 1990, 2 years <i>earlier</i>.</p><p>Windows 3.0 was a result of the flop of OS/2 1.x.</p><p>OS/2 1.x was a new 16-bit multitasking networking kernel -- but that meant new drivers.</p><p>MS  discarded the radical new OS, it discarded networking completely (until  later), and moved the multitasking into the GUI layer, allowing Win3 to  run on top of the single-tasking MS-DOS kernel. That meant excellent  compatibility: it ran on almost anything, can it could run almost all  DOS apps, <i>and multitask them</i>. And thanks to a brilliant  skunkworks project, mostly by one man, David Weise, assisted by Murray  Sargent, it combined 3 separate products (Windows 2, Windows/286 and  Windows/386) into a single product that ran on all 3 types of PC and  took good advantage of all of them. I wrote about its development here: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/18/how_windows_got_to_v3/" rel="nofollow">https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/18/how_windows_got_to_v3...</a></p><p>It  also did bring in some of the GUI design from OS/2 1.1, mainly from  1.2, and 1.3 -- the Program Manager and File Manager UI, the  proportional fonts, the fake-3D controls, some of the Control Panel, and  so on. It kept the best user-facing parts and threw away the fancy  invisible stuff underneath which was problematic.</p><p>Result: smash  hit, redefined the PC market, and when Dv/X arrived it was doomed: too  late, same as OS/2 2.0, which came out the same year as Dv/X.</p><p>If Dv/X had come out in the late 1980s, before Windows 3, it could have changed the way the PC industry went.</p><p>Dv/X  combined the good bits of DOS, 386 memory management and multitasking,  Unix networking and Unix GUIs into an interesting value proposition:  network your DOS PCs with Unix boxes over Unix standards, get remote  access to powerful Unix apps, and if vendors wanted, it enabled ports of  Unix apps to this new multitasking networked DOS.</p><p>In the '80s  that could have been a contender. Soon afterwards it was followed by  Linux and the BSDs, which made that Unix stuff free and ran on the same  kit. That would have been a great combination -- Dv/X PCs talking to BSD  or Linux servers, when those Unix boxes didn't really have useful GUIs  yet.</p><p>Windows 3 offered a different deal: it combined the good bits  of DOS, OS/2 1.x's GUI, and Windows 2.x into a whole that ran on  anything and could run old DOS apps and new GUI apps, side by side.</p>Networking  didn't follow until Windows for Workgroups which followed Windows 3.1.  Only businesses wanted that, so MS postponed it. Good move.<br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><img src="https://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=liam_on_linux&ditemid=95984" width="30" height="12" alt="comment count unavailable" style="vertical-align: middle;"/> comments

## Largest DDoS Attack to Date

date: 2025-06-23, updated: 2025-06-23, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>It was a recently unimaginable <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/06/record-ddos-pummels-site-with-once-unimaginable-7-3tbps-of-junk-traffic/">7.3 Tbps</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The vast majority of the attack was delivered in the form of User Datagram Protocol packets. Legitimate UDP-based transmissions are used in especially time-sensitive communications, such as those for video playback, gaming applications, and DNS lookups. It speeds up communications by not formally establishing a connection before data is transferred. Unlike the more common Transmission Control Protocol, UDP doesn&#8217;t wait for a connection between two computers to be established through a handshake and doesn&#8217;t check whether data is properly received by the other party. Instead, it immediately sends data from one machine to another...</p></blockquote>

One more thing about the linkblog, it no longer cross-posts to social media sites. I want to see if I miss having the links there. It also won't have the limits. Maybe it'll be better if my accounts are a bit more quiet. Also the RSS feed is in a new location, I want to wait a bit to make sure it works before publicizing the URL.

## WordCamp Canada in October

date: 2025-06-22, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I'm keynoting the <a href="https://canada.wordcamp.org/2025/">WordCamp Canada</a> conference in October in Ottawa. It's the first conference I've attended since before the pandemic. </p>
<p>The timing is ideal, and the location is significant. As an American, I don't want to try to attract people from around the world to a meeting in my country. Right now, I wouldn't come here if I didn't live here. </p>
<p>I'm also not happy with the tech industry of the US. I'd like a fresh start, a return to our roots, with the assumption that the people control their destiny and the role of developers is to give them to the tools to try out new ideas. </p>
<p>With <a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a> I've created a product <a href="https://this.how/wordland/">for writers</a>, filling a need that's been there since the beginning of the web, using the practices in writing tools we learned in the 80s. It doesn't have the artificial <a href="https://textcasting.org/">limits</a> imposed by Twitter et al. I think they're senseless. So we're going to blow that door wide open. No character limits. Simple styling. Links. Editable. </p>
<p>And it's also a product for developers. There's no lock-in anywhere in this stack. So you can make a different style of editor. Or play with new ways to view timelines.</p>
<p>I wanted to take discourse in a different direction too. A good design for the social web shouldn't require intense moderation. The reward for spammers is practically nil. Also, it'll be good for small groups in a way that Twitter et al never have been. </p>
<p>So far I haven't invented any new formats. We're building on what works now. WordPress is a remarkably deep product, so deep it could be used as operating system. and that's exactly how I've chosen to view it and it works incredibly well. Some of what we're building on is based on work I did with Joseph Scott of Automattic in <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22joseph%20scott%22">2009</a>, believe it or not.</p>
<p>And as a bonus we get a great bridge into ActivityPub, from the great work Automattic is doing in bridging WordPress to ActivityPub. Think about it and you'll see how connections in and out of WordPress can facilitate a lot of interop, not just via RSS, but any format that comes along that people want to use.  </p>
<p>We'll have a lot to talk about in October! </p>

## RSS on a timeline

date: 2025-06-22, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>More on the vision for WordLand and RSS. </p>
<p>Imagine that <a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a> is the editor of a <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22twitter-like%22">twitter-like</a> system built around <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a>. It saves your writing to WordPress, where it is published on a website and via RSS. You don't have to use WordLand or WordPress, because RSS is an open format. <i>Any editor that generates RSS is part of the network. </i>Designed to be simple. </p>
<p>All that's missing is a timeline viewer, and that's what I'm working on now. It's coming together pretty nicely, imho. Not an easy project, though on the surface it looks like it should be. Also there's nothing proprietary about my timeline viewer. There could be a thousand of them. Anyone who has written an RSS feed reader will have all the low-level bits they need. </p>
<p>Hoping to have all the connections working by the end of the summer. </p>
<p>Once done, it will be the completion of the vision for RSS as the foundation of the open social web, the place that all the open formats agree on, so we can get on with interop and say goodbye to lock-in. It can be done, I'm almost 100 percent sure of that now. Still have a little ways to go. As they say -- <i>still diggin!</i></p>
