**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-06-24, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

<a class="anchorRightMargin" href="https://herve.bzh/wordpress-wordland-and-the-open-web/"><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/04/24/cheshireCat.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;"></a><a href="https://github.com/jeherve">Jeremy Herve</a> is a developer at Automattic. Here's <a href="https://herve.bzh/wordpress-wordland-and-the-open-web/">what he said</a> about yesterday's <a href="https://shownotes.scripting.com/scripting/2025/06/23/wordpressAndMe.html">podcast</a>. He liked the idea of WordPress as the OS of the open social web. Glad that resonated. It has so much more than the other possible platforms. The others couldn't even realistically claim to be part of the web. They don't support writers very well. We're going to build slowly and deliberately around this idea, always staying open for competitors, because that's the most important thing about the web, beyond its simplicity, it <i>never</i> locks its users in. That's a deal-stopper. As I've learned how WordPress works internally, I immediately saw that they embraced the concepts of the web not just as words, but in their practice. I never hit a wall that kept me out of doing something they already did. And they also appear to never break users and developers. That's one of the basic rules of the web, it's an unchanging thing, no one can break it because everyone is a <a href="https://this.how/googleAndHttp/">guest</a>. Anyway, there is only one web. Keep that in mind. Nothing exclusive about it.

## My Big Beta Weekend

This weekend I decided to bite the&#160;bullet&#160;and embrace the “betas” released by Apple at the recent WWDC. I wanted to try out all the new features that Apple had&#160;announced&#160;and&#160;separate the&#160;wheat from the chaff.&#160; No, I didn’t download the beta on my main machines. My every day iPhone,&#160;iPad,&#160;and Mac Studio have been untouched. The only everyday &#8230;

## Back after a break

If you think it has been quiet around these ramparts, then it is intentional. I decided to take a break from&#160;everything,including writing and social media. Instead, I picked up my camera,&#160;packed&#160;my bags, and went on a&#160;photo&#160;trip to Svalbard.&#160; I have not been on photo adventures for almost a year, mostly because I was losing my &#8230;

## If only DESQview/X had been launched when Quarterdeck starting talking about it

date: 2025-06-23, from: Liam on Linux

A response to an <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44353673">HN comment</a>...<br /><br />The PC press had rumours of Quarterdeck's successor to DESQview, Desqview/X, from around 1987-1988.<p>That is roughly when I entered the computer industry.<br /><br />Dv/X was remarkable tech, and if it had shipped earlier could have changed the course of the industry. Sadly, it came too late.&nbsp;Dv/X was rumoured  then, but the state of the art was OS/2 1.1, released late 1988 and the  first version of OS/2 with a GUI.</p><p>Dv/X was not released until <a href="https://winworldpc.com/product/desqview/desqview-x-1x">about 5Y later</a>...&nbsp;1992. That's the same year as Windows 3.1, but critically, Windows 3.0 was in 1990, 2 years <i>earlier</i>.</p><p>Windows 3.0 was a result of the flop of OS/2 1.x.</p><p>OS/2 1.x was a new 16-bit multitasking networking kernel -- but that meant new drivers.</p><p>MS  discarded the radical new OS, it discarded networking completely (until  later), and moved the multitasking into the GUI layer, allowing Win3 to  run on top of the single-tasking MS-DOS kernel. That meant excellent  compatibility: it ran on almost anything, can it could run almost all  DOS apps, <i>and multitask them</i>. And thanks to a brilliant  skunkworks project, mostly by one man, David Weise, assisted by Murray  Sargent, it combined 3 separate products (Windows 2, Windows/286 and  Windows/386) into a single product that ran on all 3 types of PC and  took good advantage of all of them. I wrote about its development here: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/18/how_windows_got_to_v3/" rel="nofollow">https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/18/how_windows_got_to_v3...</a></p><p>It  also did bring in some of the GUI design from OS/2 1.1, mainly from  1.2, and 1.3 -- the Program Manager and File Manager UI, the  proportional fonts, the fake-3D controls, some of the Control Panel, and  so on. It kept the best user-facing parts and threw away the fancy  invisible stuff underneath which was problematic.</p><p>Result: smash  hit, redefined the PC market, and when Dv/X arrived it was doomed: too  late, same as OS/2 2.0, which came out the same year as Dv/X.</p><p>If Dv/X had come out in the late 1980s, before Windows 3, it could have changed the way the PC industry went.</p><p>Dv/X  combined the good bits of DOS, 386 memory management and multitasking,  Unix networking and Unix GUIs into an interesting value proposition:  network your DOS PCs with Unix boxes over Unix standards, get remote  access to powerful Unix apps, and if vendors wanted, it enabled ports of  Unix apps to this new multitasking networked DOS.</p><p>In the '80s  that could have been a contender. Soon afterwards it was followed by  Linux and the BSDs, which made that Unix stuff free and ran on the same  kit. That would have been a great combination -- Dv/X PCs talking to BSD  or Linux servers, when those Unix boxes didn't really have useful GUIs  yet.</p><p>Windows 3 offered a different deal: it combined the good bits  of DOS, OS/2 1.x's GUI, and Windows 2.x into a whole that ran on  anything and could run old DOS apps and new GUI apps, side by side.</p>Networking  didn't follow until Windows for Workgroups which followed Windows 3.1.  Only businesses wanted that, so MS postponed it. Good move.<br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><img src="https://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=liam_on_linux&ditemid=95984" width="30" height="12" alt="comment count unavailable" style="vertical-align: middle;"/> comments

## Largest DDoS Attack to Date

date: 2025-06-23, updated: 2025-06-23, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>It was a recently unimaginable <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/06/record-ddos-pummels-site-with-once-unimaginable-7-3tbps-of-junk-traffic/">7.3 Tbps</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The vast majority of the attack was delivered in the form of User Datagram Protocol packets. Legitimate UDP-based transmissions are used in especially time-sensitive communications, such as those for video playback, gaming applications, and DNS lookups. It speeds up communications by not formally establishing a connection before data is transferred. Unlike the more common Transmission Control Protocol, UDP doesn&#8217;t wait for a connection between two computers to be established through a handshake and doesn&#8217;t check whether data is properly received by the other party. Instead, it immediately sends data from one machine to another...</p></blockquote>

## WordCamp Canada in October

date: 2025-06-22, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I'm keynoting the <a href="https://canada.wordcamp.org/2025/">WordCamp Canada</a> conference in October in Ottawa. It's the first conference I've attended since before the pandemic. </p>
<p>The timing is ideal, and the location is significant. As an American, I don't want to try to attract people from around the world to a meeting in my country. Right now, I wouldn't come here if I didn't live here. </p>
<p>I'm also not happy with the tech industry of the US. I'd like a fresh start, a return to our roots, with the assumption that the people control their destiny and the role of developers is to give them to the tools to try out new ideas. </p>
<p>With <a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a> I've created a product <a href="https://this.how/wordland/">for writers</a>, filling a need that's been there since the beginning of the web, using the practices in writing tools we learned in the 80s. It doesn't have the artificial <a href="https://textcasting.org/">limits</a> imposed by Twitter et al. I think they're senseless. So we're going to blow that door wide open. No character limits. Simple styling. Links. Editable. </p>
<p>And it's also a product for developers. There's no lock-in anywhere in this stack. So you can make a different style of editor. Or play with new ways to view timelines.</p>
<p>I wanted to take discourse in a different direction too. A good design for the social web shouldn't require intense moderation. The reward for spammers is practically nil. Also, it'll be good for small groups in a way that Twitter et al never have been. </p>
<p>So far I haven't invented any new formats. We're building on what works now. WordPress is a remarkably deep product, so deep it could be used as operating system. and that's exactly how I've chosen to view it and it works incredibly well. Some of what we're building on is based on work I did with Joseph Scott of Automattic in <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22joseph%20scott%22">2009</a>, believe it or not.</p>
<p>And as a bonus we get a great bridge into ActivityPub, from the great work Automattic is doing in bridging WordPress to ActivityPub. Think about it and you'll see how connections in and out of WordPress can facilitate a lot of interop, not just via RSS, but any format that comes along that people want to use.  </p>
<p>We'll have a lot to talk about in October! </p>

## RSS on a timeline

date: 2025-06-22, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>More on the vision for WordLand and RSS. </p>
<p>Imagine that <a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a> is the editor of a <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22twitter-like%22">twitter-like</a> system built around <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a>. It saves your writing to WordPress, where it is published on a website and via RSS. You don't have to use WordLand or WordPress, because RSS is an open format. <i>Any editor that generates RSS is part of the network. </i>Designed to be simple. </p>
<p>All that's missing is a timeline viewer, and that's what I'm working on now. It's coming together pretty nicely, imho. Not an easy project, though on the surface it looks like it should be. Also there's nothing proprietary about my timeline viewer. There could be a thousand of them. Anyone who has written an RSS feed reader will have all the low-level bits they need. </p>
<p>Hoping to have all the connections working by the end of the summer. </p>
<p>Once done, it will be the completion of the vision for RSS as the foundation of the open social web, the place that all the open formats agree on, so we can get on with interop and say goodbye to lock-in. It can be done, I'm almost 100 percent sure of that now. Still have a little ways to go. As they say -- <i>still diggin!</i></p>
