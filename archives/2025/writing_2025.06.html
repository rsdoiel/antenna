What better way to start the year than reading a novel by my favourite
horror author, Grady Hendrix. If you’ve been following Hendrix’s work,
you’ll know he’s been putting his unique spin on the tropes of horror
fiction. He’s tackled exorcisms (<strong>My Best Friend’s
Exorcism</strong>), demonic rock ’n’ roll (<strong>We Sold Our

“My recommendation to anybody who is writing animation is to take
advantage of the things you can do in animation that you can’t do in
live action, which is to spend an infinite amount of money, right? If
you and I are going to write a scene and you say, ‘Oh, let’s set it on a
battleship, but then space aliens come and suddenly we’re transported to
Jupiter,’ it better be animation because if it’s not, we’re never going
to be able to shoot that. But if it is animation, that’s exactly what we
should be doing all the time. You want to create the most expensive set
in the world because it costs nothing to draw that battleship and send
us to Jupiter. And that’s really the glory of an animated show,” says
Brent Forrester, about what he learned writing for <em>The Simpsons</em>
for three seasons. <br><br>On today’s episode, we chat with Emmy-winning
writer Brent Forrester about his prolific comedy writing career that
includes shows like <em>The Office, King of the Hill</em> and <em>Space
Force</em>. He shares why the writing room for <em>The Simpsons</em> was
so intimidating and his surprise when <em>The Office</em> showrunners
had to teach him the specific tone and structure for the show after he
turned in his first episode and just wasn’t getting it. <br><br>“I had
gotten the tone wrong – it was largely my attempt to make it wall to
wall funny. I wasn’t getting that you really had to make it serious.
There were other aspects, too, that I had to pick up. One of them is the
use of what are called ‘talking heads.’ It’s when the character speaks
directly to camera. It comes from reality TV where they pull the subject
of a reality show aside and ask them a question and they just speak
directly to camera. So we stole that device and it’s<br>a great crutch
for writers because one of the hardest things for us is getting the
exposition across,” says Forrester. <br><br>He also shares his advice
for writing a great TV pilot that will hook the reader and offers a
simple formula for writing jokes by mixing the sacred with the
profane. <br><br>To hear more, listen to the podcast.

Oh, we love our magazines! It was a great year for some, but the final
year for others. Venues changed frequency (usually down), others moved
away from print, some added other forums and opportunities for readers.
Overall, we saw fewer new venues than in previous years. Revenue is
still coming from Kickstarter, Patreon, and other crowdfunding for a lot

As screenwriters, we probably all have some variation of this dream—to
make a film, and get accepted into a prestigious festival like Sundance
or SXSW, and stand on the stage afterward to face an applauding
crowd.<br><br>It’s a great dream. But how do you create a screenplay,
and final project, that stands out among thousands of
submissions? <br><br>To add another layer of potential difficulty, what
if you’re making a genre film that some might see as overplayed? In this
case, what if you make a
<a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/writer-director-abe-forsythe-serves-up-big-fun-in-little-monsters">movie
with zombies</a>? <br><br>Since George Romero took us into that isolated
farmhouse in <span style="font-style: italic;">Night of the Living
Dead</span>, zombies have been something of a mainstay, appearing in
almost every flavor of story under the sun.<br><br>Except, perhaps, as
stand-ins for grief in a post-apocalyptic story following a snarky
podcaster.<br><br>That’s loosely the plot of <span
style="font-style: italic;">Didn’t Die</span>, which premiered in the
Midnight section at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival.<br><br>Co-written
and directed by <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3652021/">Meera
Menon</a>, the film follows Vinita
(<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1454280/?ref_=tt_cst_t_1">Kiran
Deol</a>), a podcast host working during the zombie apocalypse while
clinging to a thinning audience. <br><br>Rather than following
traditional zombie tropes, Menon and co-writer Paul Gleason created
something more intimate and smaller in scale—a quiet meditation on loss,
survival, and finding meaning at the end of the world.<br><br>Menon is
an experienced writer/director, whose work as director includes episodes
of <span style="font-style: italic;">Westworld, Ms. Marvel, For All
Mankind, The Terror,</span> and even <span
style="font-style: italic;">The Walking Dead</span> (hey!). As a writer,
her experience is in shorts and indies. <br><br>What’s interesting about
her team’s approach is the film’s unconventional development. Working
from a 40-page script, they built scenes through actor collaboration and
on-set improv.<br><br>We talked with Menon about her writing process to
uncover insights for screenwriters who want to
<a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/what-genre-is-my-screenplay">play
in established genres</a>. She suggests that sometimes the best path
forward isn’t following traditional rules. It might be more important to
find your voice, and stick to it.<br><br><span
style="font-weight: bold;">Final Draft: You talk about the film coming
from a place of experiencing a lot of loss and catastrophe. What do you
think is so therapeutic or cathartic about writing from these
experiences?</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Meera
Menon</span>: It’s interesting because we made the film before
experiencing a lot of loss recently. I think we wrote it from a place of
fear and a search for answers. <br><br>Our movie has a lot of ideas
batting around, and the script was developed in conversation with the
actors. We asked ourselves, “What would you hold onto if the entire
world around you fell apart?” Unfortunately we find ourselves asking
that question too often these days. <br><br><span
style="font-weight: bold;">Final Draft: What came first—the zombie story
or the podcast host character? How did you develop the initial
idea?</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Menon</span>: The
initial concept was to make a more character focused, meditative film
set in the zombie apocalypse. We were very explicitly not looking to
make <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/why-horror-never-dies">a
horror film</a>, but rather, use the world to tell more of a ghost
story, about living with the dead. <br><br>So the zombie story came
first, and we felt that Kiran would be a dynamic hero at the center of
the story, one who could carry the microphone quite
literally. <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Final Draft: You
co-wrote the film with Paul Gleason. Could you describe your
collaborative writing process?</span><br><br><span
style="font-weight: bold;">Menon</span>: Paul and I wrote an
<a href="https://www.finaldraft.com/learn/how-to-outline-a-screenplay/">outline</a>
for the film that we gradually fleshed out with the actors. We held Zoom
sessions with them in various groups to fill out their backstories and
then let them largely improvise on set. <br><br>The entire process was
very quick, very collaborative, very iterative. We wrote the first
outline in September and were shooting in December. <br><br><span
style="font-weight: bold;">Final Draft: The film is described as a
dramedy. What’s your advice for finding that tone on the
page?</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Menon</span>: For
me, this film was an experiment. The story navigates a journey through
grief, and that is not a linear journey. One moment you are crying, the
next laughing hysterically. I deliberately wanted to switch track
between humor, dread, and poignancy because I feel like that is the
journey that grief takes you on. <br><br>So I think tone is all about
intention. And as long as your intention is clear, you can go anywhere
you want. <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Final Draft: The
press notes mention you worked from a 40-page script. What made you
decide to keep the script shorter and leave room for
improvisation?</span><br><br><span
style="font-weight: bold;">Menon</span>: I wanted to keep a light foot
because we made this film quite quickly, with so few resources and the
smallest of crews. Being loose with a script allowed us to make choices
based on what worked, and not what the script was dictating. <br><br>You
have to be open to the moment, always, but especially when the fun of
the moment is your only and primary resource. <br><br><span
style="font-weight: bold;">Final Draft: What’s your daily writing
routine like when you’re working on a screenplay?</span><br><br><span
style="font-weight: bold;">Menon</span>: I’m a morning person, so it’s
usually 3-4 hours at my computer in the morning and then a lot of
watching other movies in the afternoon. <br><br><span
style="font-weight: bold;">Final Draft: What was the biggest writing
challenge you faced with this project?</span><br><br><span
style="font-weight: bold;">Menon</span>: I did not want to make a horror
film, but rather, a story about family, loss and finding meaning in the
zombie apocalypse. <br><br>As such, the flow of the movie was always
going to be something crafted through feeling, and less through
conventional structure. Making people okay with our approach in this
genre will be a challenge, but one I am excited about as I think the
zombie world is under-explored in terms of tone and genre.<br><br><span
style="font-weight: bold;">Final Draft: What advice would you give to
writers working on their first feature screenplay?</span><br><br><span
style="font-weight: bold;">Menon</span>: Don’t be afraid to get
weird. <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Final Draft: Do you have
any advice for getting a film into Sundance?</span><br><br><span
style="font-weight: bold;">Menon</span>: I don’t, other than sticking to
your guns. I think Sundance is still a place that appreciates truly
<a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/how-to-give-your-screenplay-your-voice">unique
voices</a>, and the only way to stand out is to be yourself.

When I settled in to read Maiga Doocy’s debut, <strong>Sorcery and Small
Miracles</strong>, I expected an ‘‘en­emies to lovers’’ romance with
magic between the unserious but sweet protagonist, Leovander ‘‘Leo’’
Loveage, and his classmate, the brooding, often surly, Sebastian Grimm.
Both of them are students at the Fount, learning to be sorcerers for
reasons that
