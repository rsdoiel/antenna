## Elise Jesse’s Philly Cheesesteak Zucchini Boats

date: 2025-07-28, from: Taste of Home

If you're craving the bold, savory flavors of a classic Philly cheesesteak but want something a little lighter for summer, these Philly cheesesteak zucchini boats are the answer. I make them with tender slices of NY strip steak and sauteed bell peppers, onions and mushrooms, all tucked into roasted zucchini halves and topped with melted provolone. It's a healthy twist on the sandwich we know and love, without sacrificing flavor. This dish is hearty, satisfying and weeknight-friendly. —Elise Jesse, Cincinnati, Ohio

## GUINNESS OSSO BUCO

date: 2025-07-28, from: Irish Food Hub

<p>Description:Guinness Osso Buco is a bold Irish twist on the classic Italian dish. Instead of white wine, this version uses the deep, malty richness of Guinness stout to slow-braise veal or beef shanks until meltingly tender. Perfect for hearty dinners or special occasions, it’s traditionally served with mashed potatoes or creamy polenta to soak up the flavorful gravy. Preparation Time: 20 minutesCooking Time: 2.5 to 3 hoursServing Size: Serves 4 📝 Ingredients 4 veal or beef shanks, about 2 inches thick Salt and freshly ground black pepper 3 tbsp plain flour (for dusting) 2 tbsp olive oil 1 onion, finely chopped 2 carrots, diced 2 celery stalks, diced 4 garlic cloves, minced 1 tbsp tomato paste 440ml (1 can) Guinness stout 500ml beef stock 1 bay leaf 1 tsp fresh thyme leaves (or ½ tsp dried) Zest of 1 lemon (optional, for gremolata) 2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley (optional, for gremolata) 👨‍🍳 Instructions Preheat oven to 160°C (320°F). Season the shanks with salt and pepper, then lightly dust with flour. In a large Dutch oven, heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Brown the shanks on all sides, then transfer to a plate. Add onions, carrots, celery, and garlic to the pot. Sauté until softened, about 6–8 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste and cook for 2 minutes. Pour in the Guinness and scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Add beef stock, bay leaf, and thyme. Return the shanks to the pot, ensuring they’re mostly submerged in liquid. Cover and place in the oven. Braise for 2.5 to 3 hours, or until the meat is fall-off-the-bone tender. Optional: Mix lemon zest and parsley to make a gremolata. Sprinkle over the dish just before serving for a fresh contrast. Serve hot with mashed potatoes, polenta, or rustic bread. 🍽️ Serving Tip This dish pairs beautifully with extra Guinness or a bold red wine, and makes an impressive centrepiece for a cold-weather dinner.</p>

## TIKTOK AND SOCIAL MEDIA’S INFLUENCE ON IRISH FOOD TRENDS – THE RISE OF VIRAL FOOD CRAZES IN IRELAND

date: 2025-07-28, from: Irish Food Hub

<p>Table of Contents 1. The Digital Kitchen: A New Era for Irish Food 2. From Coddle to Cloud Bread: TikTok’s Influence on Irish Palates 3. Food Creators, Micro-Influencers, and the Rise of Irish TikTok Chefs 4. Social Media as a Launchpad for Local Irish Food Businesses 5. What’s Next? Predicting the Future of Irish Food Trends Online The Digital Kitchen: A New Era for Irish Food Once rooted firmly in the traditions of family recipes and local food rituals, Irish cuisine is now undergoing a digital transformation. Thanks to platforms like TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts, a new food culture is emerging—one that is faster, more visual, and highly influenced by trends born online. This digital kitchen isn’t just changing how food is presented; it&#8217;s changing what Irish people cook and eat. Young Irish creators and food lovers are at the forefront of this movement, using smartphones instead of cookbooks to guide their meals. Whether it’s whipping up a viral butter board, perfecting an air-fried snack, or trying a Korean-inspired garlic cheese bread, Irish kitchens are now places of constant experimentation. Global food trends are being adapted to local tastes—sometimes with surprising results. During the pandemic lockdowns, interest in home cooking soared across Ireland, and TikTok emerged as a culinary lifeline. With short, fast-paced videos showcasing unique recipes and easy techniques, people of all ages began to explore food in new ways. For many Irish families, dinner became less about tradition and more about inspiration—from people halfway around the world. This shift isn’t just about recipes. It’s about how food is talked about, how it looks on camera, and how it fits into a lifestyle of sharing and engagement. Hashtags like #IrishFoodTok and #EasyIrishRecipes now help define what&#8217;s trending, and many content creators have gone from amateur cooks to social media influencers, sparking new interest in Irish food both at home and abroad. The digital kitchen has brought Irish food into a global conversation—where a simple TikTok clip can launch a national craving, and where what’s popular today might be gone tomorrow. In this ever-changing space, food isn’t just eaten—it’s performed, recorded, and shared. From Coddle to Cloud Bread: TikTok’s Influence on Irish Palates For generations, traditional Irish meals like Dublin coddle, boxty, and Irish stew were passed down through families with little variation. But now, a new generation is blending these beloved dishes with internet trends, creating mashups that are as surprising as they are shareable. From air-fried potato farls to Guinness-infused ramen, TikTok has opened the floodgates for culinary creativity in Irish homes. One of the most noticeable changes is how global food crazes are being interpreted through an Irish lens. When cloud bread went viral on TikTok—a fluffy, meringue-like creation made with just egg whites, sugar, and cornstarch—it wasn’t long before Irish versions began appearing, sometimes dyed green or infused with local ingredients like Baileys or Irish butter. Another example is the butter board, a viral charcuterie-style trend where softened butter is spread across a board and topped with sweet or savory ingredients. In Ireland, this trend evolved into rustic farmhouse versions featuring Kerrygold butter, sea salt flakes, fresh herbs, and even for dipping—turning a global fad into a uniquely Irish bite. Even classic Irish breakfasts are being reimagined. TikTok videos show everything from deconstructed breakfast rolls to Irish-style breakfast tacos. The once-staple black pudding is now being diced and added to pasta dishes, salad bowls, or even fusion tacos that bring Irish flavours to life in completely new formats. This creative spirit has also encouraged more experimentation with plant-based and allergy-friendly alternatives. Vegan colcannon, gluten-free soda bread, and dairy-free Irish coffee substitutes are thriving in the algorithm-driven world of social media—giving traditional dishes a modern, inclusive twist. As viral trends sweep across the globe, Irish cooks are no longer passive observers. They’re active participants—remixing food trends in a way that celebrates both innovation and heritage. Food Creators, Micro-Influencers, and the Rise of Irish TikTok Chefs The rise of Irish food content creators on TikTok and Instagram has given a fresh face—and voice—to Irish cuisine. Gone are the days when food media was controlled by a handful of celebrity chefs or cookbook publishers. Today, a college student in Galway or a home cook in Wexford can build a loyal following simply by sharing relatable, mouthwatering content. These micro-influencers—many with just a few thousand followers—often have more engagement than big-name personalities. Their authenticity, local accents, and Irish kitchen quirks make them instantly relatable. Whether they&#8217;re filming in a tiny apartment or a countryside kitchen, these creators are making Irish food feel both modern and deeply personal. Some focus on recreating childhood favourites with a twist, while others highlight affordable meals for students or busy families. You’ll find accounts dedicated to Irish baking, air fryer meals, gluten-free options, and humorous takes on nostalgic recipes like chicken curry chips or jambons. The common thread? An eagerness to entertain, teach, and celebrate Irish food culture in all its forms. Short-form video has proven particularly effective. A 30-second clip showing how to make Tayto-crusted chicken goujons can rack up hundreds of thousands of views in a weekend. Hashtags like #IrishFoodie, #TikTokIreland, and #IrishRecipes connect creators to a growing audience that’s hungry for something both familiar and fresh. Some creators are even building full-time careers from their content, launching cookbooks, collaborating with Irish food brands, or offering cooking classes online. What began as a few cooking clips in lockdown has blossomed into a dynamic food scene fueled by humour, creativity, and community. It’s not just a trend—it’s a movement. And these creators are leading the way in how Ireland sees, cooks, and shares its food with the world. Social Media as a Launchpad for Local Irish Food Businesses Social media isn’t just changing how Irish people cook—it’s transforming how they launch and grow food businesses. From market stalls to family-run cafés and home bakers, small Irish food entrepreneurs are turning to TikTok and Instagram to reach audiences far beyond their local</p>
