<h2 id="foss-infrastructure-is-under-attack-by-ai-companies">FOSS
infrastructure is under attack by AI companies</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-20, from: OS News</p>
<p>What do SourceHut, GNOME’s GitLab, and KDE’s GitLab have in common,
other than all three of them being forges? Well, it turns out all three
of them have been dealing with immense amounts of traffic from “AI”
scrapers, who are effectively performing DDoS attacks with such ferocity
it’s bringing down the infrastructures of these major open source
projects. Being open source, and thus publicly accessible, means these
scrapers have unlimited access, unlike with proprietary projects. These
“AI” scrapers do not respect robots.txt, and have so many expensive
endpoints it’s putting insane amounts of pressure on infrastructure. Of
course, they use random user agents from an effectively infinite number
of IP addresses. Blocking is a game of whack-a-mole you can’t win, and
so the GNOME project is using a rather nuclear option called Anubis now,
which aims to block “AI” scrapers with a heavy-handed approach that
sometimes blocks real, genuine users as well. The numbers are insane, as
Niccolò Venerandi at Libre News details. Over Mastodon, one GNOME
sysadmin, Bart Piotrowski, kindly shared some numbers to let people
fully understand the scope of the problem. According to him, in around
two hours and a half they received 81k total requests, and out of those
only 3% passed Anubi’s proof of work, hinting at 97% of the traffic
being bots – an insane number! ↫ Niccolò Venerandi at Libre News Fedora
is another project dealing with these attacks, with infrastructure
sometimes being down for weeks as a result. Inkscape, LWN, Frama
Software, Diaspora, and many more – they’re all dealing with the same
problem: the vast majority of the traffic to their websites and
infrastructure now comes from attacks by “AI” scrapers. Sadly, there’s
doesn’t seem to be a reliable way to defend against these attacks just
yet, so sysadmins and webmasters are wasting a ton of time, money, and
resources fending off the hungry “AI” hordes. These “AI” companies are
raking in billions and billions of dollars from investors and
governments the world over, trying to build dead-end text generators
while sucking up huge amounts of data and wasting massive amounts of
resources from, in this case, open source projects. If no other
solutions can be found, the end game here could be that open source
projects will start to make their bug reporting tools and code
repositories much harder and potentially even impossible to access
without jumping through a massive amount of hoops. Everything about this
“AI” bubble is gross, and I can’t wait for this bubble to pop so a
semblance of sanity can return to the technology world. Until the next
hype train rolls into the station, of course. As is tradition.</p>

id="memory-safety-for-web-fonts-in-chrome-google-replaces-freetype-with-rust-based-alternative">Memory
safety for web fonts in Chrome: Google replaces FreeType with Rust-based
alternative</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-20, from: OS News</p>
<p>There’s no escaping Rust, and the language is leaving its mark
everywhere. This time around, Chrome has replaced its use of FreeType
with Skrifa, a Rust-based replacement. Skrifa is written in Rust, and
created as a replacement for FreeType to make font processing in Chrome
secure for all our users. Skifra takes advantage of Rust’s memory
safety, and lets us iterate faster on font technology improvements in
Chrome. Moving from FreeType to Skrifa allows us to be both agile and
fearless when making changes to our font code. We now spend far less
time fixing security bugs, resulting in faster updates, and better code
quality. ↫ Dominik Röttsches, Rod Sheeter, and Chad Brokaw The move to
Skrifa is already complete, and it’s being used now by Chrome users on
Linux, Android, and ChromeOS, and as a fallback for users on Windows and
macOS. The reasons for this change are the same as they always are for
replacing existing tools with new tools written in Rust: security.
FreeType is a security risk for Chrome, and by replacing it with
something written in a memory-safe language like Rust, Google was able
to eliminate a whole slew of types of security issues. To ensure
rendering correctness, Google performed a ton of pixel comparison tests
to compare FreeType output to Skrifa output. On top of that, Google is
continuously running similar tests to ensure no quality degradation
sneaks into Skrifa as time progresses. Whether anyone likes Rust or not,
the reality of the matter is that using Rust provides tangible benefits
that reduce cost and lower security risks, and as such, its use will
keep increasing, and tried and true tools will continue to be replaced
by Rust counterparts.</p>

bigger boot partition</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-20, from: OS News</p>
<p>Long ago, during the time of creation, I confidently waved my hand
and allocated a 1GB ESP partition and a 1GB boot partition, thinking to
myself with a confident smile that this would surely be more than enough
for the foreseeable future. However, this foreseeable future quickly
vanished along with my smile. What was bound to happen eventually came,
but I didn’t expect it to arrive so soon. What could possibly require
such a large boot partition? And how should we resolve this? Here, I
would like to introduce the boot partition issue I encountered, as well
as temporary coping methods and final solutions, mentioning the problems
encountered along the way for reference. ↫ fernvenue Some of us will
definitely run into this issue at some point, so if you’re doing a fresh
installation it might make sense to allocate a bit more space to your
boot partition. If you have a running system and are bumping into the
limitations of your boot partition and don’t want to reinstall, the
linked article provides some possible solutions.</p>

<h2 id="gnome-48-released">GNOME 48 released</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-19, from: OS News</p>
<p>One of the two major open source desktop environments, GNOME, just
released version 48, and it’s got some very big and welcome
improvements. First and foremost there’s dynamic triple-buffering, a
feature that took over five years of extensive testing to get ready. It
will improve the smoothness and fluidity of animations and other
movements on the screen, as it did for KDE when it landed there in the
middle of last year. GNOME 48 also brings notification stacking,
combining notifications from the same source, improvements to the new
default image viewer such as image editing features, a number of digital
well-being options, as well as the introduction of a new, basic audio
player designed explicitly for quickly playing individual audio files.
There’s also a few changes to GNOME’s text editor, and following in
KDE’s recent footsteps, GNOME 48 also brings HDR support. Another major
change are the new default fonts. Finally, Cantarell is gone, replaced
by slightly modified versions of Inter and Iosevka. Considering I
absolutely adore Inter and installing and setting it as my main font is
literally the first thing I do on any system that allows me to, I’m
fully behind this change. Inter is exceptional in that it renders great
in both high and low DPI environments, and its readability is
outstanding. GNOME 48 will make its way to your distribution’s
repositories soon enough.</p>

<h2 id="java-24-released">Java 24 released</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-19, from: OS News</p>
<p>Oracle, the company owned by a guy who purchased a huge chunk of the
Kingdom of Hawaii from the Americans, has released Java 24. I’ll be
honest and upfront: I just don’t care very much at all about this, as
the only interaction I’ve had with Java over the past, I don’t know, 15
years or so, is either because of Minecraft, or because of my obsession
with ancient UNIX workstations where Java programs pop up in the
weirdest of places. I know Java is massive and used everywhere, but
going through the list of changes and improvements does not spark any
joy in me at all, and just makes me want to stick my pinky in an
electrical socket to make something interesting happen. If you work with
Java, you know all of this stuff already anyway, as you’ve been
excitedly trying to impress Nick from accounting with your knowledge of
Flexible Constructor Bodies and Quantum-Resistant Module-Lattice-Based
Key Encapsulation Mechanisms because he’s just so dreamy and you
desperately want to ask him out for a hot cup of coffee, but you’re not
sure if he’s married or has a boy or girlfriend so you’re just kind of
scoping things out a bit too excitedly and now you’re worried you might
be coming off as too desperate for his attention. Anyway, that’s how
offices work, right? I’ve never worked for anyone but myself and office
settings induce a deep sense of existential dread in me, so my knowledge
of office work, and Java if we’re honest, may be based a bit too much on
’90s sitcoms and dramas. Whatever, Java 24 is here. Do a happy
dance.</p>

<h2 id="after-47-years-openvms-gets-a-package-manager">After 47 years,
OpenVMS gets a package manager</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-18, from: OS News</p>
<p>As of the 18th of February, OpenVMS, known for its stability and
high-availability, 47 years old and ported to 4 different CPU
architecture, has a package manager! This article shows you how to use
the package manager and talks about a few of its quirks. It’s an early
beta version, and you do notice that when using it. A small list of
things I noticed, coming from a Linux (apt/yum/dnf) background: There
seems to be no automatic dependency resolution and the dependencies it
does list are incomplete. No update management yet, no removal of
packages and no support for your own package repository, only the VSI
official one. Service startup or login script changes are not done
automatically. Packages with multiple installer files fail and require
manual intervention. It does correctly identify the architectures, has
search support and makes it way easier to install software. The time
saved by downloading, manually copying and starting installation is
huge, so even this early beta is a very welcome addition to OpenVMS. ↫
Remy van Elst Obviously, a way to install software packages without
having to manually download them is a huge step forward for OpenVMS. The
listed shortcomings might raise some eyebrows considering most of us are
used to package management on Linux/BSD, which is far more advanced.
Bear in mind, however, that this is a beta product, and it’s quite
obvious these missing essential features will be added over time.
Luckily it at least lists dependencies, so let’s hope actually
automating installing them is in the works and will be available soon. I
actually have an OpenVMS virtual machine set up and running, but I find
using it incredibly difficult – but only because of my own lack of
experience with and knowledge about OpenVMS, of course. Any experience
of knowledge rooted in UNIX-based and Windows operating systems is
useless here, even for the most basic of CLI tasks. If I find the time,
I’d love to spend more time with it and get more acquainted with the way
it works, including this new package manager.</p>

id="pebble-unveils-new-devices-and-strongly-suggests-you-dump-ios-for-android">Pebble
unveils new devices, and strongly suggests you dump iOS for Android</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-18, from: OS News</p>
<p>It’s barely been two months after the announcement that Pebble would
return with new watches, and they’re already here – well, sort of.
Pebble has announced two new watches for preorder, the Core 2 Duo and
the Core Time 2. The former is effectively a Pebble 2, upgraded with new
internals, while the Core Time 2 is very similar, but comes with a
colour e-ink display and a metal case. They’re up for preorder now at
$149 and $225, respectively, with the Core 2 Duo shipping in July, and
the Core Time 2 shipping in December. Alongside this unveil, Eric
Migicovsky, the creator of Pebble, also published a blog post detailing
the trouble Pebble is and will have with making smartwatches for iOS
users. Apple effectively makes it impossible for third parties to make a
proper smartwatch for iOS, since access to basic functionality you’d
come to expect from such a device are locked by Apple, reserved only for
its own Apple Watch. As such, Migicovsky makes it explicitly clear that
iOS users who want to buy one of these new Pebbles will are going to
have a very degraded experience compared to Android users. Not only will
Android users with Pebble have access to a ton more functionality, any
Pebble features that could exist for both Android and iOS users will
always come to Android first, and possibly iOS later. In fact,
Migicovksy goes as far as suggesting that if you want a Pebble, you
should buy an Android phone. I don’t want to see any tweets or blog
posts or complaints or whatever later on about this. I’m publishing this
now so you can make an informed decision about whether to buy a new
watch or not. If you’re worried about this, the easiest solution is to
buy an Android phone. ↫ Eric Migicovsky I have to hand it to Migicovksy
– I love the openness about this, and the fact he’s making this
explicitly clear to any prospective buyers. There’s no sugarcoating or
PR speak to try and please Tim Cook – he’s putting the blame squarely
where it belongs: on Apple. It’s kind of unreal to see such directness
about a new product, but as a Dutch person, it feels quite natural. We
need more of this style of communication in the technology world, as it
makes it much clearer that you’re getting – and not getting. I do hope
that Pebble’s Android support functions without the need for Google Play
Services or other proprietary Google code, since it would be great to
have a proper, open source smartwatch fully supported by de-Googled
Android.</p>

<h2 id="gimp-3.0-released">GIMP 3.0 released</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>It’s taken a Herculean seven-year effort, but GIMP 3.0 has finally
been released. There are so many new features, changes, and improvements
in this release that it’s impossible to highlight all of them. First and
foremost, GIMP 3.0 marks the shift to GTK3 – this may be surprising
considering GTK4 has been out for a while, but major applications such
as GIMP tend to stick to more tried and true toolkit versions. GTK4 also
brings with it the prickly discussion concerning a possible adoption of
libadwaita, the GNOME-specific augmentations on top of GTK4. The other
major change is full support for Wayland, but users of the legacy X11
windowing system don’t have to worry just yet, since GIMP 3.0 supports
that, too. As far as actual features go, there’s a ton here.
Non-destructive layer effects is one of the biggest improvements.
Another big change introduced in GIMP 3.0 is non-destructive (NDE)
filters. In GIMP 2.10, filters were automatically merged onto the layer,
which prevented you from making further edits without repeatedly undoing
your changes. Now by default, filters stay active once committed. This
means you can re-edit most GEGL filters in the menu on the layer
dockable without having to revert your work. You can also toggle them on
or off, selectively delete them, or even merge them all down
destructively. If you prefer the original GIMP 2.10 workflow, you can
select the “Merge Filters” option when applying a filter instead. ↫ GIMP
3.0 release notes There’s also much better color space management,
better layer management and control, the user interface has been
improved across the board, and support for a ton of file formats have
been added, from macOS icons to Amiga ILBM/IFF formats, and much more.
GIMP 3.0 also improves compatibility with Photoshop files, and it can
import more palette formats, including proprietary ones like Adobe Color
Book (ACB) and Adobe Swatch Exchange (ASE). This is just a small
selection, as GIMP 3.0 truly is a massive update. It’s available for
Linux, Windows, and macOS, and if you wait for a few days it’ll probably
show up in your distribution’s package repositories.</p>

and 350. It had faster RAM and came with more of it, and boasted quicker
graphics with double the vertical resolution built right into the logic
board. The 380 still has its faults, notably being two-thirds the speed
of the 11/73 and having no cache, plus all of the 325/350’s
incompatibilities. Taken on its merits, though, it’s a tank of a
machine, a reasonably powerful workstation, and the most practical
PDP-adjacent thing you can actually slap on a (large) desk. This
particular unit is one of the few artifacts I have left from a massive
DEC haul almost twelve years ago. It runs PRO/VENIX, the only official
DEC Unix option for the Pros, but in its less common final release
(we’ll talk about versions of Venix). I don’t trust the clanky ST-506
hard drive anymore, so today we’ll convert it to solid state and double
its base RAM to make it even more professional, and then play around in
VENIX some for a taste of old-school classic Unix — after, of course,
some history. ↫ Cameron Kaiser Detailed, interesting, fascinating, and

id="apples-long-lost-hidden-recovery-partition-from-1994-has-been-found">Apple’s
long-lost hidden recovery partition from 1994 has been found</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>In 1994, a single Macintosh Performa model, the 550, came from the
factory with a dedicated, hidden recovery partition that contained a
System 7 system folder and a small application that would be set as
bootable if the main operating system failed to boot. This application
would then run, allowing you to recover your Mac using the system folder
inside the recovery partition. This feature was apparently so obscure,
few people knew it existed, and nobody had access to the original
contents of the recovery partition anymore. It took Doug Brown a lot of
searching to find a copy of this recovery partition. The issue is that
nobody really knows how this partition is populated with the recovery
data, so the only way to explore its contents was to somehow find a
Performa 550 hard drive with a specific version of Mac OS that had never
been reformatted after leaving the factory. The thing is, this whole
functionality was super obscure. It’s understandable that people weren’t
familiar with it. Apple publicly stated it was only included with this
one specific Performa model. Their own documentation also said that it
would be lost if you reformatted the hard drive. It was hiding in the
background, so nobody really knew it was there, let alone thought about
saving it. Also, I can say that the first thing a lot of people do when
they obtain a classic computer is erase it in order to restore it to the
factory state. Little did anyone know, if they reformatted the hard
drive on a Performa 550, they could have been wiping out rare data that
hadn’t been preserved! ↫ Doug Brown Brown found a copy, and managed to
get the whole original functionality working again. It’s a fairly basic
way of doing this, but we shouldn’t forget we’re talking 1994 here, and
I don’t think any other operating system at the time had the ability to
recover from an unbootable state like this. Like Brown, I wonder why it
was abandoned so quickly. Perhaps Apple was unwilling to sacrifice the
hard drive space? Groundbreaking or not, it’s still great to have this
recovered and preserved for the ages.</p>

accidentally cares about its users, releases update that unintentionally

<p>date: 2025-03-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>It’s rare in this day and age that proprietary operating system
vendors like Microsoft and Apple release updates you’re more than happy
to install, but considering even a broken clock is right twice a day,
we’ve got one for you today. Microsoft released KB5053598 (OS Build
26100.3476) which “addresses security issues for your Windows operating
system”. One of the “security issues” this update addresses, is
Microsoft’s “AI” text generator, Copilot. To address this glaring
security issue, this update removes Copilot from your Windows
installation altogether. Sadly, it’s only by mistake, and not by design.
We’re aware of an issue with the Microsoft Copilot app affecting some
devices. The app is unintentionally uninstalled and unpinned from the
taskbar. Microsoft is working on a resolution to address this issue. In
the meantime, affected users can reinstall the app from the Microsoft
Store and manually pin it to the taskbar. ↫ Microsoft Support Well, at
least until Microsoft “fixes” this “issue” with KB5053598, consider this
update a simple way to get rid of Copilot. Microsoft accidentally cared
about its users for once, so cherish this moment – it won’t happen
again.</p>

<p>date: 2025-03-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>It’s been a while, but there’s a new release of Ironclad, the
formally verified, hard real-time capable kernel written in SPARK and
Ada. Aside from the usual bugfixes, this release moves Ironclad from
multiboot to Limine, adds x86_64 ACPI support for poweroff and reboot,
improvements to PTY support, the VFS layer, and much more. The easiest
way to try out Ironclad is to download Gloire, a distribution that uses
Ironclad and the GNU tools. It can be installed in both a virtual
machine and on real hardware.</p>

<h2 id="a-look-at-firefox-forks">A look at Firefox forks</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>Mozilla’s actions have been rubbing many Firefox fans the wrong way
as of late, and inspiring them to look for alternatives. There are many
choices for users who are looking for a browser that isn’t part of the
Chrome monoculture but is full-featured and suitable for day-to-day use.
For those who are willing to stay in the Firefox “family” there are a
number of good options that have taken vastly different approaches. This
includes GNU IceCat, Floorp, LibreWolf, and Zen. ↫ Joe Brockmeier It’s a
tough situation, as we’re all aware. We don’t want the Chrome
monoculture to get any worse, but with Mozilla’s ever-increasing number
of dubious decisions some people have been warning about for years, it’s
only natural for people to look elsewhere. Once you decide to drop
Firefox, there’s really nowhere else to go but Chrome and Chrome skins,
or the various Firefox skins. As an aside, I really don’t think these
browsers should be called Firefox “forks”; all they really do is change
some default settings, add in an extension or two, and make some small
UI tweaks. They may qualify as forks in a technical sense, but I think
that overstates the differentiation they offer. Late last year, I tried
my best to switch to KDE’s Falkon web browser, but after a few months
the issues, niggles, and shortcomings just started to get under my skin.
I switched back to Firefox for a little while, contemplating where to go
from there. Recently, I decided to hop onto the Firefox skin train just
to get rid of some of the Mozilla telemetry and useless ‘features’
they’ve been adding to Firefox, and after some careful consideration I
decided to go with Waterfox. Waterfox strikes a nice balance between the
strict choices of LibreWolf – which most users of LibreWolf seem to
undo, if my timeline is anything to go by – and the choices Mozilla
itself makes. On top of that, Waterfox enables a few very nice KDE
integrations Firefox itself and the other Firefox skins don’t have,
making it a perfect choice for KDE users. Sadly, Waterfox isn’t packaged
for most Linux distributions, so you’ll have to resort to a third-party
packager. In the end, none of the Firefox skins really address the core
problem, as they’re all still just Firefox. The problem with Firefox is
Mozilla, and no amount of skins is going to change that.</p>
