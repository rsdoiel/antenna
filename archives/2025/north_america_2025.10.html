<p>date: 2025-03-13, from: Market Place, Make me Smart</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p>
In this episode, Kai and Kimberly divide into the back and forth over
tariffs. The on-again, off-again levies are making it tough for
industries to plan and trade. With all the uncertainty, are markets —
from stocks to agriculture — on the verge of becoming untradable? Plus,
we’ll wryly smile at a biting, century-old song about farmers who were
ticked off about tariffs. (Thanks to our listener, Robert, for sharing
his rendition!)

<p>
A new contender has entered the podcast landscape: wait, is that
California Governor Gavin Newsom? His show features a surprisingly
conservative guest list, including MAGA stars Steve Bannon and Charlie
Kirk. Kai and Kimberly break down the fourth wall and discuss whether
there’s value in platforming guests who hold a different set of values.
Plus, more federal layoffs took place this past week, this time in the
U.S. Department of Education and its civil rights division. Then, the
hosts get smiley about rescue dogs in a sled dog race (thanks, Abigail!)
and the birds in Kai’s neighborhood.

</p>
<p>
Five years ago, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a
pandemic. Since then, there have been lockdowns, a recession, two
presidential elections and more than a million American lives lost from
the disease. In many ways, life feels like it’s back to normal, but
David Wallace-Wells, a writer for The New York Times, argues that the
pandemic still has a grip on American life, from our faith in public
health institutions to the way consumers feel about the economy. On the
show today, Wallace-Wells walks us through how Americans neglected to
process the seismic impact of the pandemic in the rush to recover from
it, and how it’s left us more self-interested and less empathetic. Plus,
how this can help explain disgruntled consumers and a growing appetite
for risk-taking in the economy.
</p>
<p>

<p>
Then, we’ll get into how responses to public health emergencies have
shifted to the realm of the private sector. And, we’ll hear listeners’
reflections on the COVID-19 pandemic, five years on.

On today’s episode, Kai and Kimberly discuss the future of Biden-era
clean energy tax credits under Trump 2.0. A group of GOP lawmakers want
them to stay. Meanwhile, the administration is rescinding memos that
pushed for climate change-resilient infrastructure. Plus, the hosts
weigh in on the arrest of a Palestinian activist and Columbia University
student by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. Is this the first
arrest of “many to come?” Finally, we’ll smile as the cherry blossoms in
Washington, D.C., get closer to full bloom.
