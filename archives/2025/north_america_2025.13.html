<h2 id="the-tariff-countdown">The tariff countdown</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-01, from: Market Place, Make me Smart</p>
<p>
President Donald Trump has promised that a fresh wave of tariffs on
April 2 will usher in an era of growth in American manufacturing. But
does history bear that out? We’ll explain how steel tariffs under
President George W. Bush did more harm than good. And, in response to
Trump’s trade agenda, the “buy Canadian” movement is gaining steam.
American exporters are already feeling it. Plus, we’ll smile about
flowers, parties and the unspoken rules of texting.
