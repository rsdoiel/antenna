<p>date: 2025-04-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>Another six months have passed, so it’s time for a new OpenBSD
release: OpenBSD 7.7 to be exact. Browsing through the long, detailed
list of changes, a few important bits jump out. First, OpenBSD 7.7 adds
support for Ryzen AI 300 (Strix Point, Strix Halo, Krackan Point),
Radeon RX 9070 (Navi 48), and Intel’s Arrow Lake, adding support for the
latest x86 processors to OpenBSD. There seems to be quite a few entries
in the list related to power management, from work on hibernation and
suspend, to more fine-grained control over performance profiles when on
battery or plugged in. There’s also the usual long list of driver
improvements, new drivers, and tons and tons of other fixes and changes.
OpenBSD 7.7 also ships with the latest GNOME and KDE releases, and
contains fixes and improvements for a whole slew of obscure and outdated
architectures.</p>

Wii homebrew library contains code stolen from Nintendo, RTEMS</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>The Wii homebrew community has been dealt a pretty serious blow, as
developers of The Homebrew Channel for the Wii have discovered that not
only does an important library most Wii homebrew software rely on use
code stolen straight from Nintendo, that same library also uses code
taken from an open source real-time operating system without giving
proper attribution. Most Wii homebrew software is built atop a library
called libogc. This library apparently contains code stolen from
Nintendo’s SDK as well as from games using this SDK, decompiled and
cleaned. This has been known for a while, but it was believed that
large, important parts of libogc were at least original, but that, too,
turns out to be untrue. Recently it has been discovered that libogc’s
threading/OS implementation has been stolen from RTEMS, an open source
real-time operating system. The developers of libogc have indicated that
they do not care, intend to do nothing about it, and deleted any issues
reporting the stolen code. What’s wild about the code stolen from RTEMS
is that it’s an open source operating system with a nice, permissive
license; there was no need to steal the code at all, and all it would
take to address it is proper attribution. As such, the fail0verflow
group, which develops The Homebrew Channel for the Wii, has ceased all
development on The Homebrew Channel, and archived the code repository.
The Wii homebrew community was all built on top of a pile of lies and
copyright infringement, and it’s all thanks to shagkur (who did the
stealing) and the rest of the team (who enabled it and did nothing when
it was discovered). Together, the developers deceived everyone into
believing their work was original. Please demand that the leaders and
major contributors to console or other proprietary device SDKs and
toolkits that you use and work with do things legally, and do not
tolerate this kind of behavior. ↫ The Homebrew Channel GitHub page
Considering Nintendo is on a crusade to shutdown emulators, stuff like
this is really not helping anyone trying to argue that consoles should
be open devices, that emulators play an important role in preservation,
and that people have a right to play the games they own on a device
other than the console it’s intended for. I’m sure this isn’t the last
we’ll hear about this development.</p>

<p>date: 2025-04-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>Few things in life make me happier than a new 9front release. This
new release, 9front “CLAUSE 15 COMMON ELEMENTS OF MAUS AND STAR TYPE”,
comes with a variety of fixes and new features, such as temperature
sensor support for Ryzen processors, a new Intel i225 2.5 GbE driver, a
number of low-level kernel improvements, and so, so many more small
fixes and changes. If you use 9front, you already know all of this, and
you’re too cool to read OSNews anyway. If you’re new to 9front and want
to join the cool people club, you can download images for PC, Raspberry
Pi, MNT Reform, and QEMU.</p>

<p>date: 2025-04-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>RetrOS-32 is a 32bit operating system written from scratch, with
graphics, multitasking and networking capabilities. The kernel is
written in C and assembly, while the userspace applications are written
in C++, using Make for compilation, all licensed under the MIT license.
It runs on Qemu, of course, but a variety of real hardware is also
supported, which is pretty cool and relatively unique for a small hobby
project like this. The UI is delightfully retro – as the name obviously
implies – and it comes with a set of basic applications, as well as
games like Wolfenstein 3D.</p>
