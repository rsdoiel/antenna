Rudd cosplays 1991 Paul Rudd in throwback Switch 2 commercial</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-21, updated: 2025-04-21, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>As all Ruddheads know, actor Paul Rudd made his acting debut in an
iconic 1991 Super Nintendo commercial as a radical-looking 22-year-old
playing games like F-Zero and a then-unnamed The Legend of Zelda: A Link
to the Past on a gigantic, drive-in movie theater screen. And now,
almost 35 years later, Rudd is back to […]</p>

<p>We finally know the identity of the mysterious Force ghost that
briefly haunts Anakin Skywalker’s back in the lava-filled showdown at
the end of Revenge of the Sith. If you’ve watched Revenge of the Sith

<p>This week is all about tension on TV. Like flowers blossoming on your
spring walks, it’s everywhere you look. Whether it’s a creepy stalker
returning triumphant to New York, now clothed in wealth and prestige
(You season 5), or the nascent Rebel Alliance trying their best to
hobble the Empire in whatever way they can […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-04-21, updated: 2025-04-21, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>To be blunt, you’d have to be high not to trade in your Xbox Series X
to GameStop since it promises Pro members $420.69
(hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha) in store credit through April 26.
No matter how long you’ve had your Series X — a day, or going on almost

<p>Diablo 4’s next season is all about the new bosses being added to the
game, but it also marks the first time Blizzard is deliberately trying
to ramp the action RPG’s difficulty up. After a year of players blazing
through the game at faster and faster speeds, Blizzard wants to slow
things down and make […]</p>

<p>A new idle clicker game has overtaken Banana on the Steam charts.
That’s Bongo Cat, published by Irox Games, which takes the general idea
of Banana and the rest of the genre and tweaks it a little. You don’t
really play Bongo Cat, necessarily; the cute little kitty lives as an

<p>Nintendo is asking a California court to force Discord to give up the
identity of the person behind last year’s massive Pokémon data breach,
known among the Pokémon community as the “Teraleak.” It’s called the
Teraleak because of just how much information was released online; the
leaker claimed to have source code for the upcoming […]</p>

<p>Hands down, Ryan Coogler’s 1930s-set crime film/historical
thriller/vampire horror-show Sinners is one of the best movies of 2025
so far. The Black Panther and Fruitvale Station director has made a
project that’s simultaneously audacious and personal, the kind of
big-swing original story that cinephiles are always clamoring for around
the edges of the endless franchise […]</p>

<p>Look Outside is a horror game with teeth — quite literally: They’re
bursting through my neighbors’ skin and gnashing on anything that gets
too close. Look Outside was originally released on March 21, and the
game has since consistently floated to the top of my social media feeds
as people marvel about the scares this […]</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals is doomed to forever be compared to Overwatch. It’s a
team-based shooter with heroes, and some of those heroes happen to have
a lot in common with the ones in Overwatch. NetEase has never directly
said Blizzard’s game was an inspiration, but a now-removed line in
Marvel Rivals’ code confirms that someone on […]</p>
