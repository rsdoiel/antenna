<p>The endless sprawl of modern action and action-adjacent games is a
common source of frustration for me. While I admire the detailed,
expansive worlds some of these games evoke, sometimes I just want to
play a level-based game that feels like the slimmed-down action
adventures of my youth. Which is why I was absolutely delighted […]</p>

<p>Horror movies are constantly calling out for experimentation; it’s a
whole genre based around rules that are just waiting to be bent,
twisted, or broken into a brand-new shape. Which is exactly why it’s
such a shame that so many new horror movies are just slight variations
on the same old ideas. But just last […]</p>

<p>What is an “Xbox game”? Fairly recently, the answer was simple: An

X</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-21, updated: 2025-04-21, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>To be blunt, you’d have to be high not to trade in your Xbox Series X
to GameStop since it promises Pro members $420.69
(hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha) in store credit through April 26.
No matter how long you’ve had your Series X — a day, or going on almost
five years — taking a deal that has […]</p>

<p>Diablo 4’s next season is all about the new bosses being added to the
game, but it also marks the first time Blizzard is deliberately trying
to ramp the action RPG’s difficulty up. After a year of players blazing
through the game at faster and faster speeds, Blizzard wants to slow
things down and make […]</p>

<p>A new idle clicker game has overtaken Banana on the Steam charts.
That’s Bongo Cat, published by Irox Games, which takes the general idea
of Banana and the rest of the genre and tweaks it a little. You don’t
really play Bongo Cat, necessarily; the cute little kitty lives as an
overlay on your screen, […]</p>

<p>Nintendo is asking a California court to force Discord to give up the
identity of the person behind last year’s massive Pokémon data breach,
known among the Pokémon community as the “Teraleak.” It’s called the
Teraleak because of just how much information was released online; the
leaker claimed to have source code for the upcoming […]</p>

<p>Hands down, Ryan Coogler’s 1930s-set crime film/historical
thriller/vampire horror-show Sinners is one of the best movies of 2025
so far. The Black Panther and Fruitvale Station director has made a
project that’s simultaneously audacious and personal, the kind of
big-swing original story that cinephiles are always clamoring for around
the edges of the endless franchise […]</p>

<p>Look Outside is a horror game with teeth — quite literally: They’re
bursting through my neighbors’ skin and gnashing on anything that gets
too close. Look Outside was originally released on March 21, and the

<p>Marvel Rivals is doomed to forever be compared to Overwatch. It’s a
team-based shooter with heroes, and some of those heroes happen to have
a lot in common with the ones in Overwatch. NetEase has never directly

Marvel Rivals’ code confirms that someone on […]</p>
