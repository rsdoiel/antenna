PC handhelds like Steam Deck really competitors for Switch 2?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-06, updated: 2025-04-04, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>When Nintendo launched the Switch in 2017, it had no competition in
dedicated handheld gaming, a sector it had established with the Game Boy
in 1989 and ruled ever since. Sega had come and gone; Sony, after two
determined attempts with the PlayStation Portable and PlayStation Vita,
had just about given up. As Switch 2 […]</p>

<p>As it barrels through its characteristically outlandish fourth and
final season, Danny McBride’s HBO comedy The Righteous Gemstones has
cemented a reputation for itself. Yes, it’s side-splittingly funny. Yes,
its “failchildren of a crumbling empire” narrative is surprisingly
relevant. Yes, there is a core of sincerity at the center of the
madness. But Gemstones’ legacy […]</p>

<p>At a glance, House House’s 2019 honking sensation Untitled Goose Game

<p>All the best Assassin’s Creed games are about family.  The Ezio

Assassin’s Creed theme” — is titled “Ezio’s Family.” […]</p>

<p>Nintendo’s Switch 2 ramp-up week started with a cheerful bang (a

new console’s release date, launch games, and features. Donkey Kong hype
abounded online, at least until the company’s news releases started
trickling out to outlets like Polygon, and sticker shock took over.
