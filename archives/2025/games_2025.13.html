<p>date: 2025-04-03, updated: 2025-04-03, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>After watching A Minecraft Movie in the theater, I decided to stick

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2’s hardware is no longer a secret, which means
we can finally see how it stacks up against the Steam Deck. Nintendo
dropped a full list of the specs after its Switch 2 Direct, and there
are a few surprising features that make it more of a direct competitor
to Valve’s handheld […]</p>

<p>Pokémon Go’s “Stunning Styles” event runs from April 3-7 and focuses

like Shellos, Burmy, and Castform (all of which have different forms)
are featured as part of the event. During the […]</p>

<p>Nintendo announced its Switch 2 Joy-Cons could be used as a mouse —
in either hand, even — during its Switch 2 Direct on April 2. Mice and
other pointers have been aiding in making certain game movements more
precise for decades, so the idea of a console-based mouse is tempting,
