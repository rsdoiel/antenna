alleviates septic cardiomyopathy by targeting the Mff/MAVS axis</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectiveTo investigate the protective role of microRNA-27b (miR-27b)
in septic cardiomyopathy (SCM) and its regulatory mechanism on the
mitochondrial fission factor (Mff)/mitochondrial antiviral signaling
protein (MAVS) axis.MethodsTranscriptome data from septic patients’
cardiac tissues (GSE79962) were analyzed. Serum miR-27b expression was
measured in SCM patients (n=11), sepsis-only patients (n=22), and
healthy controls (n=30). Mouse SCM model and HL-1 cardiomyocyte model
were established by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induction. The molecular
mechanism was investigated using miR-27b agonist/antagonist and Mff
intervention, combined with RT-qPCR, Western blot, immunofluorescence,
and transmission electron microscopy.ResultsBioinformatics analysis
revealed significant downregulation of miR-27b in SCM cardiac tissues
(log2FC=-3.9, P&lt;0.001). Clinical validation showed lower miR-27b
expression in SCM patients’ serum compared to sepsis-only patients and
healthy controls (P&lt;0.05). LPS-induced SCM model exhibited cardiac
dysfunction, myocardial injury, mitochondrial abnormalities, decreased
miR-27b expression, and increased Mff and MAVS levels. miR-27b targeted
Mff to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis, thus attenuating LPS-induced
cardiomyocyte inflammation and apoptosis, while Mff overexpression
reversed this protective effect.ConclusionmiR-27b alleviates myocardial
injury and inflammation in SCM by targeting the Mff/MAVS axis to
maintain mitochondrial homeostasis, representing a potential novel
therapeutic target for SCM.</p>

the potential impact of salidroside on Chikungunya virus-induced acute
interstitial nephritis via network pharmacology, molecular docking and
in vitro experiments</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection is often linked to acute
interstitial nephritis (AIN) in fatal cases. Given the global spread of
CHIKV and the lack of targeted antiviral treatments, there is an urgent
need for effective therapeutic strategies against CHIKV-induced AIN.
This study explored the therapeutic potential of salidroside (Sal) using
an integrative approach involving network pharmacology, molecular
docking and in vitro validation. Network pharmacology analysis
identified 18 overlapping targets between Sal and AIN, including TNF,
IL6 and AKT1. Molecular docking revealed strong binding affinities
between Sal and key pathway proteins (Vina scores &lt; –6), notably TNF,
IL6 and BCL2. In vitro assays using CHIKV-infected 293T cells
demonstrated that Sal (7.8125–2000 μM) enhanced cell viability by
8.9–25.9%, with the greatest effect observed at 1000 μM, without
significantly altering viral replication. Mechanism analysis using the
KEGG and FerrDB databases implicated apoptosis and ferroptosis in
CHIKV-induced AIN pathogenesis. RT-qPCR analysis confirmed that Sal
significantly downregulated ferroptosis-related genes (IL-6, IL-1β,
SIRT1, PARP1, HMOX1) and apoptosis-associated markers (Bax, TNF-α,
PARP1) in infected cells. Consistent with these findings, molecular
docking demonstrated that Sal binds strongly to the ferroptosis-related
protein GPX4 (Vina score: –6.3) and the apoptosis regulator NFKB1 (Vina
score: –6.0). These results suggest that Sal is a promising therapeutic
candidate for the treatment of CHIKV-induced AIN.</p>

next-generation sequencing-based characterization of the viral spectrum
in clinical pulmonary and peripheral blood samples of patients</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundMetagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) enables
comprehensive profiling of viral communities in clinical samples.
However, comparative analyses of the virome across anatomical
compartments and disease states remain limited. This study aims to
characterize the virome in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and
peripheral blood samples from patients with various clinical conditions
using mNGS.MethodsA total of 338 clinical samples—including 240 BALF and
69 blood samples for DNA sequencing, and 18 BALF and 11 blood samples
for RNA sequencing—underwent shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Following
removal of host-derived reads, high-quality non-human sequences were
aligned to a viral reference database. Virome composition was assessed
through alpha and beta diversity metrics. Principal coordinates analysis
was used to evaluate disease-related variation, and virus–bacteria
associations in BALF were investigated via Spearman
correlation.ResultsSequencing yielded an average of 51 million raw reads
per sample, resulting in approximately 8 million non-human reads after
host filtering. Distinct virome profiles were observed between BALF and
blood samples. Bacteriophages dominated all groups, with Siphoviridae
and Myoviridae as the most abundant families, although only 13.6% of
viral abundance could be assigned to known families. Diversity analyses
revealed significant differences between BALF and peripheral blood, and
DNA-sequenced BALF samples showed disease-specific viral signatures in
pulmonary infections. In contrast, tumor presence had no significant
effect on virome composition in either BALF or blood. Network analysis
identified complex virus–bacteria correlations in BALF, with genera such
as Haemophilus, Megasphaera, and Treponema as key bacterial
hosts.ConclusionsThis study reveals pronounced differences in virome
composition between the respiratory and circulatory systems and
highlights the specific influence of pulmonary disease—but not tumors—on
the pulmonary virome. The observed virus–bacteria networks provide novel
insights into pulmonary microbial ecology and underscore the importance
of integrating host and disease context in virome studies.</p>

J-shaped association between the ratio of neutrophil counts to
prognostic nutritional index and mortality in ICU patients with sepsis:
a retrospective study based on the MIMIC database</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundThe ICU faces persistent challenges with sepsis, marked by
systemic inflammation and metabolic disruptions, often leading to poor
outcomes. Despite advances, reliable biomarkers for predicting sepsis
outcomes are needed. This study introduces a novel indicator combining
neutrophil count and prognostic nutritional index (PNI) to improve
predictive accuracy by addressing both inflammatory and
nutritional-immune aspects.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective cohort
study analyzing data from the MIMIC-IV database, focusing on adults
diagnosed with sepsis per Sepsis 3.0 criteria. We excluded those younger
than 18, with ICU stays under 48 hours, multiple ICU admissions, or
incomplete data. Participants’ neutrophil counts/PNI ratios were
calculated and correlated with 30, 60, and 90-day hospital and ICU
mortality, utilising Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, Cox proportional
hazards models, restricted cubic spline (RCS) models and subgroup
analysis.ResultsWe included 2,116 patients from 22,517 eligible cases.
Survival analysis demonstrated lower survival probabilities for higher
neutrophil counts/PNI ratios across all observed time windows. Cox
regression models revealed a significant association between higher
neutrophil counts/PNI ratios and increased short- to medium-term
mortality. The restricted cubic spline regression models illustrated a
J-shaped relationship between neutrophil counts/PNI and
mortality.ConclusionThe neutrophil counts/PNI ratio is a promising
prognostic biomarker for sepsis-related outcomes in ICU settings,
offering improved risk stratification and potentially guiding
therapeutic interventions. Further research is warranted to validate
these findings across diverse populations.</p>

generation of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 reporter viruses and replicons for
antiviral research</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThe large size of coronavirus genome, along with the
instability of certain genomic sequences, makes the construction of
reverse genetics for coronaviruses particularly challenging. The rapid
development and application of reverse genetics systems for
coronaviruses require further exploration.MethodsUsing
transformation-associated recombination (TAR) cloning in yeast and the
in vitro CRISPR-Cas9 system, reverse genetics systems of two mild
coronaviruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E were rapidly established.
Antiviral assays, high-content imaging, and NanoLuc luciferase assays
were used to characterize reporter viruses and replicon
systems.ResultsWe rapidly assembled infectious clones for two mild
coronaviruses, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E, using transformation-associated
recombination (TAR) cloning in yeast. The infected clones could stably
express the mGreenLantern reporter gene. We further generated T7
promoter-driven RNA replicon of HCoV-229E and CMV promoter-driven DNA
replicon of HCoV-OC43, with the readout of NanoLuc luciferase activity.
The effectiveness of these tools for antiviral study was evaluated using
the broad-spectrum RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor remdesivir,
exhibiting high sensitivity, efficiency, and convenience.DiscussionThe
application of yeast-based TAR cloning significantly facilitates the
rapid assembly of large viral genome, and the establishment of HCoV-OC43
and HCoV-229E reverse genetics systems provides valuable platforms for
studying the biology and developing antivirals against
coronaviruses.</p>

and optimization of a novel nanocarrier SabiWhite-loaded ethosomal gel
for targeted skin inflammation complicated by multidrug-resistant
pathogens</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundThis study aimed to develop and evaluate SabiWhite-loaded
ethosomes (SW-ETH) for topical application, focusing on improving
stability, biocompatibility, and therapeutic efficacy. Ethosomal
formulations are known for their enhanced drug delivery properties,
making them suitable for skin inflammation.MethodsThe SW-ETH
formulations were developed utilizing an adapted cold preparation
technique. A 3² factorial design was used to optimize phospholipid
concentration and ethanol content, and their impact on vesicle size and
entrapment efficiency (EE%) was assessed. Structural characterization of
SabiWhite was performed using melting point determination,
Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray Diffraction
(XRD). In vitro drug release was assessed using a Franz diffusion cell,
and anti-inflammatory and skin irritation studies were performed on
Wistar rats.ResultsSabiWhite exhibited a melting point of 96°C and
characteristic FTIR peaks, confirming its identity and purity. XRD
analysis revealed its crystalline nature, while ethosomal formulations
showed a shift to an amorphous state. The optimized SW-ETH formulation
(SW-ETH 6) had a vesicle size of 184.4 nm, an EE% of 92.5%, and a zeta
potential of -13.50 mV, indicating stable and uniform vesicles. In-vitro
drug release from SW-ETH 6 showed a sustained release profile with
93.12% drug release over 24 hours. In vivo, SW-ETH demonstrated
significant anti-inflammatory effects with 36.17% edema inhibition at
150 minutes, comparable to Diclofenac gel (41.92%). No skin irritation
was observed, and the formulation was classified as non-irritant.
Stability tests confirmed minimal changes in appearance, viscosity, and
drug content over 120 days at different storage
conditions.ConclusionSW-ETH demonstrated effective drug encapsulation,
enhanced anti-inflammatory activity, and excellent biocompatibility,
making it a promising candidate for topical therapy. Further clinical
validation is warranted to confirm its therapeutic potential.</p>

id="helile-formula-from-tai-ping-sheng-hui-fang-anti-helicobacter-pylori-activity-gut-microbiota-modulation-and-inflammatory-response-regulation">Helile
formula from “Tai ping sheng hui fang”: anti-Helicobacter pylori
activity, gut microbiota modulation, and inflammatory response
regulation</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundHelicobacter pylori (HP) is a major gastric pathogen linked
to chronic gastritis, peptic ulcers, and gastric cancer. The emergence
of antibiotic resistance has prompted the search for alternative
treatments. Helile formula, derived from the ancient “Taiping
Shenghuifang,” is known to treat various degrees of diarrhea and has
potential for treating gastrointestinal disorders. However, the
antibacterial efficacy, material basis, and action mechanisms of the
helile formula against HP remain undetermined.MethodsThe chemical
constituents were analyzed using ultra-high-performance liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) and
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The in vitro anti-HP
activity and underlying mechanisms were investigated through a series of
assays, including the determination of minimum inhibitory concentration
(MIC), N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine (NPN) uptake assay, scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) to observe morphological changes, cell viability and
cell adhesion activity assays, assessment of nitric oxide (NO)
production, and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain
reaction (RT-qPCR) for gene expression analysis. For the in vivo anti-HP
infection study and mechanism exploration, techniques such as
hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining for histological examination,
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for cytokine and antibody
quantification, 16S ribosomal DNA (16S rDNA) sequencing for microbial
community profiling, and metabolomics for global metabolite analysis
were employed.ResultsMultiple constituents of helile formula, namely
ellagic acid, gallic acid, chebulagic acid, chebulic acid, and
corilagin, were identified. In vitro, helile formula increased bacterial
outer-membrane permeability, disrupted HP structure, inhibited
toxin-related genes, and suppressed cell adhesion. In male Kunming mice,
helile formula effectively reversed HP-induced inflammation. It
modulated key metabolites, such as adenine, panaxytriol,
4-hydroxyglutamate semialdehyde, and N-alpha-Acetyl-L-lysine. It
influenced the gut microbiota, especially families like Muribaculaceae
and Lactobacillaceae. Adenine, in particular, repaired HP-caused damage
to GES1 cells, reduced HP - mediated cell adhesion, and inhibited
HP-induced interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)
production.ConclusionThese findings demonstrated the remarkable anti-HP
efficacy of the helile formula in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that the
helile formula represents a highly promising therapeutic candidate for
the management of HP infections.</p>

metabolic reprogramming modulates cytokine networks in nucleos(t)ide
analogue-treated chronic hepatitis B patients</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Background &amp; aimsHepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a
global health challenge. Tryptophan metabolism influences immune
regulation, but its interplay with cytokines during antiviral therapy is
unclear. We investigated associations between tryptophan pathways and
cytokine profiles in the chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients with varying
treatment outcomes.MethodsThis retrospective study included 106 CHB
patients (including 29 functional cure cases) receiving nucleos(t)ide
analogues (NAs) and 29 healthy controls. Plasma levels of 20 tryptophan
metabolites (kynurenine, serotonin, and bacterial pathways) were
quantified by HPLC-MS/MS, and 12 cytokines were measured via flow
cytometry. Multivariate analyses were performed.ResultsFunctional cure
patients showed unique metabolic patterns. Indole-3-carboxaldehyde
(IAld) levels increased progressively from HBsAg positive groups
(HBeAg-: 63.324 nmol/L; HBeAg+: 65.938 nmol/L) to functional cure (91.44
nmol/L) and healthy controls (130.634 nmol/L) (P &lt; 0.01), exhibiting
negative correlations with HBsAg (r = -0.31) and IFN-γ (r = -0.53) but
positive correlation with IL-1β (r = 0.47). Picolinic acid (PA) was
significantly elevated in the functional cure group (P &lt; 0.001),
associated with reduced HBsAg, IL-2 and increased IL-1β, IL-10 levels,
indicating potential antiviral effects. Serotonin (5-HT) levels were
higher in cured patients and correlated with IL-1β and IFN-α (P &lt;
0.05). HBeAg-positive patients displayed increased
kynurenine-to-tryptophan (Kyn/Trp) ratios (P &lt; 0.05), while non-cured
patients showed metabolic blockade downstream of 3-hydroxykynurenine
(elevated 3-HK/Kyn ratios and reduced KA, XA/3-HK, 3-HAA/3-HK, and NAA
levels; P &lt; 0.05).ConclusionsThe tryptophan metabolites (IAld, PA,
5-HT) were found to correlate with cytokine levels (IL-1β, IL-10),
potentially implicating their involvement in immune regulation and
antiviral responses. These observations delineate a metabolic-immune
framework that may inform future therapeutic development for HBV.</p>
