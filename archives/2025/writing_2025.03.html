<strong>Days of Shattered Faith</strong>, the third book in Adrian
Tchaikovsky’s Tyrant Philoso­phers sequence, continues to examine the
effects of the long-running, world-conquering program of the nation of
Pallesand, a resolutely rationalist, religion-detesting nation
determined to bring its notion of secular perfection to a world that is
filled with supernatural

<p>
Jesse Ball, <strong>The Repeat Room </strong>(Catapult 9/24) This absurd
dystopian (and possibly truly Kaf­kaesque) SF novel details a jury system
where a single juror is chosen to relive the defendant’s experience; in
this case, a menial worker experi­ences an illicit psychosexual
relationship with a tragic end. “It’s in the novel’s absurdity that we
are asked to view justice and the worth of a single human life in a new
light.”

“People think sequels are easier, and I’m like, ‘No, no, it’s much
harder. It is much harder to write.’ They have never written sequels,
those people, because you need to do everything as well as the first and
yet better, and go to new places, follow all the world rules, but create
new ones. I mean, it’s just so many balls in the air,” says Meg LeFauve,
co-writer for <em>Inside Out 2</em>, along with Dave
Holstein. <br><br>In this special episode live from the Writer’s Guild
Foundation Library, Meg LeFauve and Dave Holstein talk about tackling a
whole new set of challenges as they wrote the sequel to the beloved
movie <em>Inside Out</em>. They also discuss the 5-year Pixar
development process that includes the concept of failing
fast.<br><br>“They really want you pushing to things that are new and
innovative, so they expect you to fail. They actually want you to fail
but they want you to do that quickly, right? Because we only have five
years, so it’s always like, hurry up, hurry up. You know, fail. Go
again. Go again,” she says.<br><br>Holstein shared some very personal
advice for writing coming of age stories, like the <em>Inside Out</em>
movies: get micro-focused.<br><br>“Sometimes it’s better to zoom in than
to zoom out. For me, it helps to zoom in on a detail and let the detail
be a microcosm for the rest of it. I know that when we were writing this
film, I was thinking about my anxiety at that age and where that came
from. I had a speech impediment, I had a stutter, so I hated Spanish
class because I had to read out loud, and my stutter always came out in
front of people, which made me very, very anxious. And I feel like, for
Riley, there’s a three-day hockey camp that could determine the rest of
her life. That’s where I sort of sunk into and if I was writing a
different story about me, I would have gone into those details. But for
me, it was about finding something very specific and very small,” says
Holstein.<br><br>To hear more about the writing process, listen to the
podcast.

Shepard penned by Christopher Priest for The Guardian. Priest felt that
