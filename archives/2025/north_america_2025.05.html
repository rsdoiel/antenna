braces for fallout from US tariffs on Chinese goods</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh instructed his
Cabinet to prepare for a possible global trade war after U.S. President
Donald Trump imposed tariffs of 10% on all Chinese products.</p>
<p>“Prepare for the possibility of a world trade war this year,” the
prime minister said at a Cabinet meeting on Wednesday, according to
the Dan Tri online newspaper.</p>
<p>Pham spoke after Trump announced a pause in his threatened tariffs
against Mexico and Canada for 30 days.</p>
<p>Pham told the Cabinet that the situation in the world and the region
was “developing very unpredictably, directly affecting our country,
especially on exports, production and business, and the macro
economy.”</p>
<p>He emphasized that if a global trade war were to occur, with
countries imposing retaliatory tariffs on each other’s exports, it could
disrupt supply chains and shrink the country’s export markets, posing
significant risks to Vietnam’s economy.</p>
<p>Pham did not specifically mention Trump’s tariffs on products from
China, a strategic trade partner and a neighboring country of
Vietnam.</p>
<p>There are worries that Trump’s tariffs may cause rising product
prices and reduced consumer purchasing power in Vietnam, a highly open
economy that relies heavily on exports and foreign direct investment,
with China as its leading trade partner.</p>
<p>Vietnamese businesses and consumers are bracing for U.S. tariffs on
China to drive up the costs of some goods as the country imports
machinery and electronic devices, such as computers and cellphones, from
the U.S., with elements or pieces that originated from China.</p>
<p>The country will also likely have to cope with pressure from Beijing
to import more Chinese products, analysts said.</p>
<p>“Vietnam may be under pressure to import more products from China as
Chinese products are levied higher tariffs by the U.S.,” Nguyen Quang A,
an economic political observer and businessman in Hanoi, told VOA this
week.</p>
<p>Others predict that as American markets close to Chinese companies,
they will increasingly turn to regional trading partners, like
Vietnam.</p>
<p>In 2024, Vietnam’s exports to China totaled $61.2 billion. Meanwhile,
imports from China surged to $144 billion, according to the Vietnam
Chamber of Commerce and Industry.</p>
<p>With the United States, the situation is reversed, with Vietnam’s
trade surplus in 2024 exceeding $123 billion, Reuters reported.</p>
<p>According to analysts, Hanoi’s pledges to import more from the U.S.
as well as other offsetting measures could spare Vietnam from the Trump
administration’s tariffs.</p>
<p>Nguyen noted a major hidden risk for Vietnam is that Chinese
companies are setting up factories in Vietnam to import products for
re-export, meaning they would repackage Chinese products with minimal
labor by cheap Vietnamese workers and export them under the “Made in
Vietnam” label to avoid tariffs.</p>
<p>“Chinese businesses [are] moving to Vietnam and are processing their
imported materials from China and then labeling their products as ‘Made
in Vietnam’ before exporting to the U.S. The U.S. will definitely
examine this issue carefully,” Nguyen said.</p>
<p>Vietnam, which has long had geopolitical tensions with China, may
face the risk of potential reprisal measures from China as Beijing said
it would impose retaliatory tariffs on some U.S. goods as soon as next
week.</p>
<p>However, Vietnam seemed to win big in Trump’s first-term trade war
with China as the Southeast Asian country attracted manufacturers
wanting to avoid Chinese tariffs.</p>
<p>If Trump’s tariffs are extended to Vietnam, the economic effects
could ripple through trade balances, exchange rates, supply chains and
foreign direct investment, said Vo Tri Thanh, former vice president at
the Central Institute for Economic Management and a member of the
National Financial and Monetary Policy Advisory Council, writing in
Vietnam News.</p>
<p>The sweeping tariffs have triggered the phenomenon of goods being
stockpiled in Vietnam and in the region to avoid tax hikes, driving up
demand for container shipping and pushing freight costs to new
highs.</p>
<p>Despite these pressures, Vietnam may find itself positioned to
capitalize on global supply chain shifts, Nguyen Hong Dien, Vietnam’s
minister of industry and trade, told Tuoi Tre Online, explaining that
the country could attract more investment in high-value sectors.</p>

continue search for plane missing in Alaska</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Rescuers in Alaska continued their search Friday for an airplane that
went missing Thursday with nine passengers and a pilot onboard.</p>
<p>Several groups were involved in the search, including the Alaska
State Troopers, the U.S. Coast Guard, the Alaska Air National Guard, the
Alaska Army National Guard and local search teams.</p>
<p>Authorities said a Jayhawk helicopter was brought in Friday morning
to help with the search.</p>
<p>The FBI was also providing technical assistance, including cellphone
analysis, to help locate the aircraft.</p>
<p>The Bering Air Caravan flight was traveling in western Alaska, just
south of the Arctic Circle, from Unalakleet to Nome. State troopers said
they were notified Thursday at 4 p.m. about the plane’s
disappearance.</p>
<p>The Coast Guard said on X that the flight was 19 kilometers offshore
when its position was lost.</p>
<p>The families of the passengers have been notified, according to the
Nome Volunteer Fire Department, but passengers’ names have not been
released.</p>
<p>The fire department posted on X that it was conducting an active
ground search, but weather and visibility conditions were hampering the
department’s air search. The department urged people not to form their
own search parties because of hazardous weather conditions in the
region, which is prone to sudden snow squalls and high winds.</p>
<p>Airplanes are often the only method of transportation between rural
Alaskan villages.</p>
<p>Nome is well-known as the last stop in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog
Race.</p>
<p>The missing flight is the third major U.S. aviation incident in
recent days. On January 29, a commercial airliner and an Army helicopter
collided near Washington’s Reagan National Airport. Two days later, a
medical transportation plane crashed into a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,
neighborhood shortly after takeoff, killing six people onboard and
another person on the street.</p>
<p>Some information for this report came from The Associated Press.</p>

id="us-judge-to-temporarily-block-trump-from-taking-some-steps-to-dismantle-usaid">US
judge to temporarily block Trump from taking some steps to dismantle
USAID</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — A U.S. judge on Friday said he would enter a “limited”
order temporarily blocking the Trump administration from taking some
steps to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development, adding
that 2,200 employees from the agency would not immediately be placed on
administrative leave. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols in Washington, who was nominated by
Trump during his first term, announced the decision at a hearing on a
lawsuit from the largest U.S. government workers’ union and an
association of foreign service workers, who sued to stop the
administration from dismantling the agency. </p>
<p>Nichols said the written ruling would be issued later Friday. </p>
<p>The administration in a notice sent to the foreign aid agency’s
workers on Thursday said it would keep 611 essential workers on board at
USAID out of a worldwide workforce that totals more than 10,000. </p>
<p>“The major reduction in force, as well as the closure of offices, the
forced relocation of these individuals were all done in excess of the
executive’s authority in violation of the separation of powers,” Karla
Gilbride, a lawyer for the unions, said at the hearing. </p>
<p>A Justice Department official, Brett Shumate, told Nichols that about
2,200 USAID employees would be put on paid leave under the
administration’s plans, adding that 500 had already been placed on
leave. </p>
<p>“The president has decided there is corruption and fraud at USAID,”
Shumate said. </p>
<p>However, the judge said his order would prevent those 2,200 employees
from being immediately placed on administrative leave and would also
pause the relocation of certain humanitarian workers stationed outside
the United States. </p>
<p>Hours after he was inaugurated on Jan. 20, Trump ordered all U.S.
foreign aid be paused to ensure it was aligned with his “America First”
policy. Chaos has since consumed USAID, which distributes billions of
dollars of humanitarian aid around the world. </p>
<p>The State Department issued worldwide stop-work directives after the
executive order was issued, effectively freezing all foreign aid with
the exception of emergency food assistance. That brought USAID programs
covering lifesaving aid around the globe to a grinding halt, in a move
that experts warned risked killing people. </p>
<p>The gutting of the agency has largely been overseen by businessman
Elon Musk, the world’s richest man and a close Trump ally spearheading
the president’s effort to shrink the federal bureaucracy.  </p>
<p>In fiscal 2023, the United States disbursed, partly via USAID, $72
billion of aid worldwide on everything from women’s health in conflict
zones to access to clean water, HIV/AIDS treatments, energy security and
anti-corruption work. </p>
<p>The U.S. provided 42% of all humanitarian aid tracked by the United
Nations in 2024, yet that represents less than 1% of its total
budget.</p>

id="trump-pauses-repeal-of-tariff-on-packages-as-they-pile-up-at-us-customs">Trump
pauses repeal of tariff on packages as they pile up at US customs</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON/LONDON/LOS ANGELES — U.S. President Donald Trump paused
his administration’s repeal of duty-free treatment of low-cost packages
from China on Friday, giving the Commerce Department time to make the
order workable, after the rapid change sparked chaos for customs
inspectors, postal and delivery services and online retailers.</p>
<p>The cancellation of de minimis means low-value e-commerce packages
arriving in the United States with goods from China must use the “formal
entry” process that requires additional information and duties before
entering the country — a more time-consuming process.</p>
<p>The stop and restart of the United States Postal Service acceptance
of those packages set off a swarm of disruptions that backed up Customs
clearance for packages — even those that had paid duties — at New York
City’s John F. Kennedy International Airport.</p>
<p>“Well, that was a fun Tuesday through Friday, if you work in global
e-commerce,” said Derek Lossing, CEO of e-commerce and global supply
chain firm Cirrus Global Advisors.</p>
<p>The change, implemented with just 48 hours’ notice, caused the USPS
to temporarily stop accepting packages from China and Hong Kong earlier
this week.</p>
<p>Popular online retailers, including Shein, Temu and Amazon.com’s new
Haul service, fly packages direct from Chinese factories to U.S.
shoppers and use de minimis to keep prices low. Those retailers did not
immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p>The Trump administration’s revision to the order was signed on
Wednesday and published today, a White House spokesperson said.</p>
<p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which has the job of screening
e-commerce packages and collecting duties on them, on Thursday held a
meeting with logistics professionals to discuss the status of more than
1 million packages piling up at JFK Airport, according to a source
familiar with the meeting.</p>
<p>One logistics executive on Friday told Reuters that customs had begun
releasing packages it was holding at JFK, which has been taking in about
60 million de minimis e-commerce packages annually.</p>
<p>Trump scrapped the duty-free treatment for Chinese goods with the
stated aim of stopping the flow of fentanyl and precursor chemicals into
the United States.</p>
<p>White House officials have said Canada and Mexico are conduits for
shipments of fentanyl and its precursor chemicals into the U.S. in small
packages that are not often inspected by customs agents. While fentanyl
traffickers have exploited a U.S. trade law, public data shows 0.2% of
all fentanyl seized in the U.S. comes from the Canadian border, while
the vast majority originates from the southern border.</p>
<p>Many shipping experts and attorneys warned that switch would
overwhelm customs inspections because the agency does not have systems
and processes in place. Its staff are also stretched thin because they
fall under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which also is
responsible for border security.</p>
<p>Companies like Shein and Temu had halted some air cargo flights,
invoking force majeure to cancel agreements without penalties, said
Kathy Liu, Director of Global sales and marketing, Asia-focused freight
forwarder Dimerco.</p>
<p>U.S. shoppers also got hit with bills for duties on purchases of
dresses, tops and baby clothing that previously were exempt. It is not
immediately clear whether those consumers would be eligible for refunds
for any duties paid.</p>
<p>“We’re navigating these significant changes to U.S. trade policy as
they come, as best we can on behalf of our clients,” said Brian Bourke,
global chief commercial officer for SEKO Logistics, which moves
e-commerce packages targeted with new duties.</p>
<p>Delivery firms UPS, FedEx and DHL also handle those packages. Their
representatives did not immediately comment on the Trump
administration’s pause on duty collection.</p>

id="trump-updates-iran-peace-deal-effort-to-reflect-new-realities-analysts-say">Trump
updates Iran peace deal effort to reflect new realities, analysts
say</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump’s peace overtures toward
Iran this week —  made as he signed a directive to put the country under
“maximum pressure” for malign behavior — signal a revived policy that
some analysts say has evolved from his first term as he adapts to Iran’s
new circumstances.</p>
<p>Trump made his overture in a Wednesday post on his Truth Social
platform, saying he seeks a “Verified Nuclear Peace Agreement, which
will let Iran peacefully grow and prosper” in return for ensuring that
the Islamic Republic “cannot have a Nuclear Weapon.”</p>
<p>A day earlier, Trump also told a news conference with visiting
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, “I would love to be able to
make a great deal [with Iran], a deal where you can get on with your
lives, and you’ll do wonderfully.”</p>
<p>In 2020, during Trump’s first term, Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law
and then a senior adviser, made a similar, if more muted, appeal to
Iran’s then-President Hassan Rouhani, in an interview with VOA.</p>
<p>“For President Rouhani, I would say it’s time for the region to move
forward. Let’s stop being stuck in conflicts of the past. It’s time for
people to get together and to make peace,” he said.</p>
<p>At the time, Trump said a key goal of his original “maximum pressure”
campaign was to negotiate a new bilateral agreement to end Iran’s
perceived malign behaviors that he said were not sufficiently addressed
by Tehran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Trump withdrew the
United States from that deal in 2018 and started the pressure
policy.</p>
<p>Trump revived his “maximum pressure” policy by signing a presidential
memorandum Tuesday, directing a series of economic and legal measures to
counter Iranian activities that threaten U.S. national interests. The
document highlighted Iran’s development of nuclear weapons-related
capabilities, ballistic missiles and its regional aggression through
support of proxy forces.</p>
<p>‘Higher ambitions and more tools for pressure’</p>
<p>The new Iran policy is “qualitatively different” from what Trump
pursued in his first term, Brian Katulis, a senior fellow of the
Washington-based Middle East Institute, told VOA.</p>
<p>“It has higher ambitions and more tools for pressure,” he said.</p>
<p>Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei responded to Trump’s
new policy Friday, saying Trump’s withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal
shows that negotiating with the U.S. “is neither rational, nor
intelligent, nor honorable, and [we] should not engage in negotiations
with it.”</p>
<p>Iranian state media said Khamenei made the comment while speaking to
a gathering of air force personnel. They also quoted him as issuing the
following warning to the U.S.: “If they threaten us, we will threaten
them. If they carry out their threat, we will carry out our threat. And
if they disrupt the security of our nation, we will definitely disrupt
their security as well.”</p>
<p>Iran long has denied seeking nuclear weapons. The International
Atomic Energy Agency has said Iran suspended an active nuclear weapons
program in 2003, but Israel, a U.S. ally, said in 2018 its agents in
Tehran stole documents indicating the Iranian government had covertly
continued that program.</p>
<p>Trump’s new “maximum pressure” memorandum includes two specific
measures that were prominent features of his first term campaign —
seeking to drive Iran’s export of oil, its highest revenue-earner, to
zero and calling for a snapback, or return, of international sanctions
the U.N. Security Council lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal.</p>
<p>In the first announcement of new sanctions in Trump’s second term,
the U.S. Treasury Department on Thursday, targeted Iran’s oil exports by
sanctioning an international network it said facilitates the shipment of
“millions of barrels of Iranian crude oil worth hundreds of millions of
dollars” to China, Iran’s top oil customer.</p>
<p>Trump’s goals of reducing Iranian oil exports to zero and restoring
international sanctions on Iran were not fully achieved in his first
term.</p>
<p>An October 2024 report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration
said Iran’s crude oil and condensate exports reached a low of 0.4
million barrels per day in 2020 “due to the U.S. reimposition of
sanctions in November 2018 and the decline in demand because of the
COVID-19 pandemic.”</p>
<p>Trump’s first administration also unilaterally declared a restoration
of international sanctions on Iran in September 2020, but most other
U.N. Security Council members rejected the move. They asserted the
U.S. had forfeited its right to trigger the return of international
sanctions by quitting the 2015 nuclear deal that lifted those
sanctions.</p>
<p>One provision of Trump’s new Iran memorandum, setting a goal that was
not explicitly stated in his first term, is ensuring neither Iraq nor
the Gulf countries can be used by Tehran to evade sanctions.</p>
<p>Trump’s first administration had tried to stop such evasion by Iran,
according to Elliott Abrams, a Council on Foreign Relations senior
fellow who served as U.S. special envoy for Iran at the end of Trump’s
first term.</p>
<p>Responding to a VOA question in a Federalist Society webinar on
Thursday, Abrams said, “There were points at which we said to the
Emiratis, ‘Look, Dubai is being used by the Iranians to get around
sanctions. Close that down.’”</p>
<p>He said the second Trump administration appears to be giving that
objective more public attention.</p>
<p>Another new feature of Trump’s pressure campaign is its order to
“modify or rescind sanctions waivers … that provide Iran any degree of
economic or financial relief … related to Iran’s Chabahar port
project.”</p>
<p>India has been developing a terminal at the Iranian port under a 2016
agreement and secured a waiver from the first Trump administration in
2018 to continue the project to facilitate humanitarian aid to
Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The Biden administration extended the waiver, but when India signed a
deal last year to operate the Iranian port for a decade, Biden’s State
Department said that “anyone considering business deals with Iran, they
need to be aware of the potential risk that they are opening themselves
up to … sanctions.”</p>
<p>‘Enhanced’ campaign seen</p>
<p>Jason Brodsky, policy director of U.S. advocacy group United Against
Nuclear Iran, told VOA he expects to see Trump pursue an “enhanced”
maximum pressure campaign that is tailored to the “changed geopolitical
realities of 2025, rather than to 2018.”</p>
<p>One of those new realities is a major rebound in Iranian oil exports,
primarily due to what Brodsky said was lax Biden administration
sanctions enforcement.</p>
<p>The U.S. Energy Information Administration’s October report, citing
data from international energy analytics company Vortexa, said Iran’s
oil exports increased to an average of 1.5 million barrels per day in
the first eight months of last year.</p>
<p>The Biden administration rejected accusations of lax sanctions
enforcement made by critics of its Iran policy while it was in office,
highlighting its sanctioning of hundreds of entities for Iran-related
activities. But Biden’s treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, said in April
2024 that Iran was “continuing to export some oil” and added, “there may
be more that we could do.”</p>
<p>Other new factors Brodsky cited as reasons for Trump to enhance his
maximum pressure strategy include Iran’s progress in uranium enrichment
during the Biden administration and Tehran’s recent regional losses. In
the past year, Israel killed the leaders of Iran’s terror proxies
Hezbollah and Hamas in Lebanon and Gaza, while Islamist rebels in Syria
ousted longtime Iran-backed leader Bashar al-Assad from power.</p>
<p>But Brodsky said the new maximum pressure memorandum also raises
questions about what Trump wants out of a potential new deal with
Iran.</p>
<p>He noted the document calls for ending the “[Iranian] regime’s
nuclear extortion racket” and asked whether this means Trump will demand
that Iran stop uranium enrichment, as Trump did in his first term.</p>
<p>“We don’t have answers right now,” Brodsky said.</p>

<p>VOA Russian spoke to U.S. experts who outline how a mix of U.S.
sanctions, export controls and other methods of applying pressure on the
Russian economy can help President Donald Trump’s administration to
force Moscow to stop the war in Ukraine. Experts agree that if Russian
President Vladimir Putin does not engage in negotiations, the U.S.
should expand punitive economic measures to hurt the Russian economy, so
Moscow simply won’t have resources to continue the war. </p>

employers added just 143,000 jobs last month, jobless rate slips to 4%
to start the year</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — U.S. employers added just 143,000 jobs last month, but
the jobless rate slipped to 4% to start 2025 and the government revised
November and December payrolls higher.</p>
<p>The first job report of Donald Trump’s second presidency suggested
that he inherited a labor market that is solid but unspectacular.
Economists had expected about 170,000 new jobs in January.</p>
<p>It’s a downshift from 2024 which averaged 186,000 new jobs a month,
including a surge of 256,000 in December. The unemployment rate is
expected to remain low at 4.1%.</p>
<p>The future is cloudier.</p>
<p>A federal judge on Thursday temporarily blocked President Donald
Trump’s plan to push out federal workers by offering them financial
incentives, yet a federal hiring freeze that Trump imposed January 20 is
a “negative for employment growth,’’ Bradley Saunders, an economist at
Capital Economics, wrote in a commentary last week.</p>
<p>The freeze came after the Labor Department collected the January jobs
numbers, so any impact would be revealed in upcoming employment
data.</p>
<p>Likewise, a cold snap that probably increased seasonal layoffs in the
Midwest and Northeast occurred late in January and won’t register in
government jobs data until the February numbers come out, Saunders
wrote.</p>
<p>Economists are also worried about Trump’s threat to wage a trade war
against other countries. He’s already imposed a 10% tax on imports from
China.</p>
<p>Canada and Mexico — America’s two largest trading partners — remain
in his crosshairs, although he gave them a 30-day reprieve from the 25%
tariffs he was planning to sock them with on Tuesday, allowing time for
negotiations. Trump says that America’s two neighbors and allies haven’t
done enough to stem the flow of undocumented immigrants and fentanyl
into the United States.</p>
<p>Trump is also ready to slap tariffs on the European Union; pointing
to America’s deficit in the trade of goods with the EU, which came to
$236 billion last year, he says that Europe treats U.S. exporters
unfairly.</p>
<p>The tariffs, which are paid by U.S. importers who generally try to
pass along the cost to customers, could rekindle inflation – which has
fallen from the four-decade high it reached in mid-2022 but is still
stuck above the Fed’s 2% target. If the tariffs push prices higher, the
Fed may cancel or postpone the two interest-rate cuts it had forecast
for this year. And that would be bad for economic growth and job
creation.</p>
<p>The job market already has cooled from the red-hot days of 2021-2023.
American payrolls increased by 2.2 million last year, down from 3
million in 2023, 4.5 million in 2022 and a record 7.2 million in 2021 as
the economy roared back from COVID-19 lockdowns. The Labor Department
also reports that employers are posting fewer jobs. Monthly job openings
have tumbled from a record 12.2 million in March 2022, to 7.6 million in
December – still a decent number by historical standards.</p>
<p>As the labor market cools, American workers are losing confidence in
their ability to find better pay or working conditions by changing jobs.
The number of people quitting has fallen from a record 4.5 million near
the height of the hiring boom in April 2022, to December’s 3.2 million,
which is below pre-pandemic levels.</p>
<p>Still, layoffs remain below pre-pandemic levels, creating an unusual
situation: If you are employed, you probably enjoy job security. If
you’re looking for one, things have gotten tougher.</p>
<p>The Labor Department also is expected to report annually released
revisions Friday that will show job creation from April 2023 through
March 2024 wasn’t as strong as originally reported.</p>
<p>A preliminary version of the revisions, released in August, showed
that 818,000 fewer jobs were created over those 12 months – lowering
average monthly hiring during that span from 242,000 to 174,000. Because
they are not final, the August estimates have not yet been added to the
official government payroll numbers. The revisions out Friday will
become official and part of the historic data.</p>

id="irans-supreme-leader-criticizes-proposed-nuclear-talks-with-us">Iran’s
supreme leader criticizes proposed nuclear talks with US</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES — Iran’s supreme leader said Friday that
negotiations with America “are not intelligent, wise or honorable” after
U.S. President Donald Trump floated the idea of nuclear talks with
Tehran.</p>
<p>Ayatollah Ali Khamenei also suggested that “there should be no
negotiations with such a government” but stopped short of issuing a
direct order not to engage with Washington.</p>
<p>Khamenei’s remarks upend months of signals from Tehran to the United
States that it wanted to negotiate over its rapidly advancing nuclear
program in exchange for the lifting of crushing economic sanctions worth
billions of dollars.</p>
<p>What happens next remains unclear, particularly as reformist
President Masoud Pezeshkian promised as recently as Thursday to enter a
dialogue with the West.</p>
<p>Khamenei’s remarks to air force officers in Tehran appeared to
contradict his own earlier remarks in August that opened the door to
talks.</p>
<p>However, the 85-year-old Khamenei has always been careful with
remarks about negotiating with the West. That includes balancing the
demands of reformists within the country who want the talks against
hard-line elements within Iran’s theocracy, including the paramilitary
Revolutionary Guard.</p>
<p>Khamenei noted that Trump unilaterally withdrew from the earlier
nuclear deal under which Iran drastically limited its enrichment of
uranium and overall stockpile of the material, in exchange for crushing
sanctions being removed.</p>
<p>“The Americans did not uphold their end of the deal,” Khamenei said.
“The very person who is in office today tore up the agreement. He said
he would, and he did.”</p>
<p>He added: “This is an experience we must learn from. We negotiated,
we gave concessions, we compromised — but we did not achieve the results
we aimed for. And despite all its flaws, the other side ultimately
violated and destroyed the agreement.”</p>
<p>Mixed messages from Trump</p>
<p>It’s not clear what sparked Khamenei’s remarks. However, they come
after Trump suggested he wanted to deal with Tehran, even while signing
an executive order to reimpose his “maximum pressure” approach to Iran
on Tuesday.</p>
<p>“I’m going to sign it, but hopefully we’re not going to have to use
it very much,” he said from the Oval Office. “We will see whether or not
we can arrange or work out a deal with Iran.</p>
<p>“We don’t want to be tough on Iran. We don’t want to be tough on
anybody,” Trump said. “But they just can’t have a nuclear bomb.”</p>
<p>Trump followed with another online message on Wednesday, saying:
“Reports that the United States, working in conjunction with Israel, is
going to blow Iran into smithereens, ARE GREATLY EXAGGERATED.</p>
<p>“I would much prefer a Verified Nuclear Peace Agreement, which will
let Iran peacefully grow and prosper,” he wrote on Truth Social. “We
should start working on it immediately, and have a big Middle East
Celebration when it is signed and completed.”</p>
<p>He did not elaborate.</p>
<p>Nuclear enrichment</p>
<p>Khamenei, like other Iranian leaders, uses elliptical comments to
indirectly govern policy while not boxing himself into any one decision.
As supreme leader, he’s also created a vast bureaucracy that competes
with itself for influence, including with its civilian leadership under
Pezeshkian.</p>
<p>As recently as Thursday, Pezeshkian suggested Iran could open itself
up to even more inspections from the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog,
the International Atomic Energy Agency.</p>
<p>“They [can] come and inspect one hundred times more since we are not
supposed to go after” a nuclear weapon, Pezeshkian told foreign
diplomats.</p>
<p>Iranian diplomats have long pointed to Khamenei’s preachings as a
binding fatwa, or religious edict, that Iran won’t build an atomic
bomb.</p>
<p>Iran has long insisted its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.
However, it now enriches uranium to 60% purity — a short, technical step
from weapons-grade levels of 90%. Iranian officials increasingly suggest
Tehran could pursue an atomic bomb. U.S. intelligence agencies assess
that Iran has yet to begin a weapons program but has “undertaken
activities that better position it to produce a nuclear device, if it
chooses to do so.”</p>
<p>Gaza and oil sanctions</p>
<p>Earlier in the week, Trump also said that displaced Palestinians in
Gaza could be permanently resettled outside the war-torn territory and
proposed the U.S. take “ownership” in redeveloping the area into “the
Riviera of the Middle East.”</p>
<p>Khamenei appeared to reference Trump’s Gaza proposal in his
remarks.</p>
<p>“The Americans sit, redrawing the map of the world — but only on
paper, as it has no basis in reality,” Khamenei said. “They make
statements about us, express opinions and issue threats. If they
threaten us, we will threaten them in return. If they act on their
threats, we will act on ours. If they violate the security of our
nation, we will, without a doubt, respond in kind.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Iran’s Foreign Ministry separately criticized the U.S.
Treasury’s move to levy sanctions Thursday against firms trading
sanctioned Iranian crude oil to China. The Treasury described the firms
as forming an “international network for facilitating the shipment of
millions of barrels of Iranian crude oil worth hundreds of millions of
dollars.”</p>
<p>Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei called the Treasury’s
decision “completely unjustified and contrary to international rules and
regulations.”</p>

id="historical-precedent-legal-questions-swirl-around-trump-plan-to-detain-migrants-at-guantanamo">Historical
precedent, legal questions swirl around Trump plan to detain migrants at
Guantanamo</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The Trump administration’s expansion of migrant detention facilities,
notably its use of the U.S. naval station at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, has
reignited debate among human rights advocates and legal experts.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump campaigned on a promise to curb legal
migration and deport those in the U.S. without legal status.</p>
<p>Late last month, he instructed his administration to prepare the
facility for the detention of up to 30,000 “high-priority” unauthorized
immigrants with criminal records. The first group arrived on
Tuesday.</p>
<p>Described as the “the worst of the worst” by administration
officials, the detainees were identified by the Department of Homeland
Security as part of the transnational criminal organization “Tren de
Aragua,” which the U.S. designated a foreign terrorist organization on
January 20.</p>
<p>VOA sent numerous requests to U.S. Immigration and Customs
Enforcement regarding what crimes the migrants committed. ICE directed
VOA to contact the Department of Homeland Security, which has not
responded to emails.</p>
<p>Miriam Pensack, a historian who studies Latin America and the
Caribbean and is a postgraduate scholar at Princeton University, said
the U.S. government has been using Guantanamo Bay to hold migrants on
and off for 30 years.</p>
<p>“There is an ICE office in Guantanamo. … But obviously what we’re
seeing now is a huge expansion of that capacity,” she said.</p>
<p>Trump’s decision to use the naval base as a migrant detention center
follows his signing of the Laken Riley Act, which mandates detention for
those accused of theft or violent crimes while in the country
unlawfully.</p>
<p>Supporters say that using Guantanamo will alleviate pressure on
overcrowded detention facilities and serve as a stronger deterrent
against illegal crossings to the United States.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth described
Guantanamo as the “perfect place” to detain migrants as he visited the
border with Mexico.</p>
<p>The Pentagon will provide any necessary assets “to support the
expulsion and detention of those in our country illegally,” he told
Agence France-Presse.</p>
<p>Guantanamo and migrant detention</p>
<p>The U.S. first used Guantanamo Bay to detain migrants, mostly Haitian
and Cuban asylum-seekers under President George H.W. Bush in the early
1990s.</p>
<p>Following a military coup in Haiti in 1991, thousands fled by boat to
the U.S. but were intercepted at sea and taken to Guantanamo. In 1994,
Guantanamo became the site of the world’s first and only prison camp for
people with HIV, where more than 300 Haitian refugees, including
children, were confined behind razor wire.</p>
<p>“These were refugees fleeing slaughter in their country, whose
credible fear of persecution the U.S. officials who screened them
acknowledged, who were held for no reason other than their HIV status.
When these people protest detention, the response was brutal,” said
Pardiss Kebriaei, senior staff attorney at the U.S.-based Center for
Constitutional Rights, to reporters during a press call last
Thursday.</p>
<p>Legal challenges eventually forced the U.S. government to release the
detainees, setting a precedent that indefinite offshore detention
without due process is legally dubious.</p>
<p>In 2002, the George W. Bush administration built a detention camp in
Guantanamo Bay to hold terror suspects following the U.S. invasion of
Afghanistan shortly after the 9/11 attacks of 2001.</p>
<p>But Guantanamo’s use for migrant detention continued with at least
two presidents, Bill Clinton and Joe Biden, using the base.</p>
<p>The Biden administration sought to close Guantanamo, but Congress
never passed the legislation, leaving the base operational for future
use.</p>
<p>“The idea of closing Guantanamo as a prison is one thing; closing
Guantanamo as a 45-square-mile base held in Cuba is another,” Pensack
said.</p>
<p>Legal and human rights concerns</p>
<p>Advocates warn that offshore detention facilities allow the U.S. to
sidestep domestic constitutional protections and limit oversight.</p>
<p>Eunice Cho, attorney at the ACLU National Prison Project, told
reporters during the press call last Thursday that “detaining immigrants
on military bases in the United States and Guantanamo would subject
people to dangerous conditions … and attempt to avoid scrutiny by
lawyers, the press, and congressional oversight.”</p>
<p>Historically, legal challenges have helped curb indefinite detentions
at Guantanamo. The Supreme Court ruling in Rasul v. Bush (2004)
established that Guantanamo detainees have the right to challenge their
detention in U.S. courts. However, the Trump administration could
attempt to argue that civil immigration detainees fall outside this
precedent.</p>
<p>While prior administrations may have seen Guantanamo as a law-free
zone, “That is not the case today,” said Kebriaei of the Center for
Constitutional Rights, adding that migrants at Guantanamo now “have due
process rights under the Constitution.”</p>
<p>“[Meanwhile], people would be detained. … and [litigation] would go
on and people would suffer during that time,” she said.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the Trump’ administration border czar Tom Homan told
reporters outside the White House on Thursday that “President Trump made
a commitment that the worst of the worst will go to Gitmo.”</p>
<p>Broader immigration, policy implications</p>
<p>The Guantanamo facility has historically been used in moments of
crisis, from Cuban and Haitian exoduses to post-9/11 military detention.
The Trump administration’s decision to include Guantanamo in its mass
detention strategy signals a shift toward increasingly punitive
measures, according to some analysts.</p>
<p>Stacy Suh, program director at Detention Watch Network, emphasized
the link between detention expansion and deportations.</p>
<p>“Detention plays a crucial role in deportation. … More detention
means more people would be deported,” she said.</p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security has yet to clarify whether the
latest White House policy includes detention of migrants without

administration plans to slash all but a fraction of USAID jobs,
officials say</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Trump administration presented a plan Thursday to
dramatically cut staffing worldwide for U.S. aid projects as part of its
dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development, leaving
fewer than 300 workers out of thousands.</p>
<p>Late Thursday, federal workers associations filed suit asking a
federal court to stop the shutdown, arguing that President Donald Trump
lacks the authority to shut down an agency enshrined in congressional
legislation.</p>
<p>Two current USAID employees and one former senior USAID official told
The Associated Press of the administration’s plan, presented to
remaining senior officials of the agency Thursday. They spoke on
condition of anonymity due to a Trump administration order barring USAID
staffers from talking to anyone outside their agency.</p>
<p>The plan would leave fewer than 300 staffers on the job out of what
are currently 8,000 direct hires and contractors. They, along with an
unknown number of 5,000 locally hired international staffers abroad,
would run the few life-saving programs that the administration says it
intends to keep going for the time being.</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear whether the reduction to 300 would be
permanent or temporary, potentially allowing more workers to return
after what the Trump administration says is a review of which aid and
development programs it wants to resume.</p>
<p>The administration earlier this week gave almost all USAID staffers
posted overseas 30 days, starting Friday, to return to the U.S., with
the government paying for their travel and moving costs. Workers who
choose to stay longer, unless they received a specific hardship waiver,
might have to cover their own expenses, a notice on the USAID website
said late Thursday.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters Monday in El Salvador, Secretary of State Marco
Rubio described the agency as historically “unresponsive” to Congress
and the White House, even though the agency, he claimed, is supposed to
take its direction from the State Department.</p>
<p>“USAID has a history of sort of ignoring that and deciding that
there’s somehow a global charity separate from the national interest,”
Rubio said. “These are taxpayer dollars, and we owe the American people
assurances that every dollar we are spending abroad is being spent on
something that furthers our national interest.”</p>
<p>Speaking in the Dominican Republic on Thursday, Rubio said the U.S.
government will continue providing foreign aid.</p>
<p>“But it is going to be foreign aid that makes sense and is aligned
with our national interest,” he told reporters.</p>
<p>The Trump administration and billionaire ally Elon Musk, who is
running a budget-cutting Department of Government Efficiency, have
targeted USAID hardest so far in an unprecedented challenge of the
federal government and many of its programs.</p>
<p>Since Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration, a sweeping funding freeze has
shut down most of the agency’s programs worldwide, and almost all of its
workers have been placed on administrative leave or furloughed. Musk and
Trump have spoken of eliminating USAID as an independent agency and
moving surviving programs under the State Department.</p>
<p>Democratic lawmakers and others call the move illegal without
congressional approval.</p>
<p>The same argument was made by the American Foreign Service
Association and the American Federation of Government Employees in their
lawsuit, which asks the federal court in Washington to compel the
reopening of USAID’s buildings, return its staffers to work and restore
funding.</p>
<p>Government officials “failed to acknowledge the catastrophic
consequences of their actions, both as they pertain to American workers,
the lives of millions around the world, and to U.S. national interests,”
the suit says.</p>

id="trump-to-create-religious-office-in-white-house-target-anti-christian-bias">Trump
to create religious office in White House, target ‘anti-Christian
bias’</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday he would create a White
House faith office and direct Attorney General Pam Bondi to lead a task
force on eradicating what he called anti-Christian bias within the
federal government.</p>
<p>Trump delivered remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast at the U.S.
Capitol and used his speech to call for unity, telling lawmakers his
relationship with religion has changed since a pair of failed
assassination attempts last year.</p>
<p>At a second prayer breakfast in Washington, Trump struck a more
partisan tone, took a victory lap for getting “rid of woke over the last
two weeks” and announced steps to protect Christians from what he said
was religious discrimination.</p>
<p>“The mission of this task force will be to immediately halt all forms
of anti-Christian targeting and discrimination within the federal
government, including at the DOJ, which was absolutely terrible, the
IRS, the FBI and other agencies,” Trump said.</p>
<p>He vowed his attorney general would work to “fully prosecute
anti-Christian violence and vandalism in our society and to move heaven
and earth to defend the rights of Christians and religious believers
nationwide.”</p>
<p>The president did not cite specific examples of anti-Christian bias
during his remarks but has previously claimed that the Biden
administration used the federal government to target Christians
specifically.</p>
<p>Trump signed an executive order on Thursday to establish the task
force and its responsibilities, which include recommending steps to
terminate “violative policies, practices, or conduct.”</p>
<p>Biden’s administration announced a strategy in December for
countering anti-Muslim and anti-Arab bigotry, and a similar plan to
fight antisemitism in September 2023.</p>
<p>The actions announced on Thursday could pose constitutional questions
about the separation of church and state, with the U.S. Constitution’s
First Amendment limiting government endorsement of religion.</p>
<p>In the last three election cycles, white evangelical Christian
voters, who make up a critical piece of the Republican base, have
supported Trump. He has embraced the conservative Christian world view
and policies that speak to the bloc’s anxiety about changing gender
norms and family patterns.</p>
<p>The president on Thursday also announced he will create a White House
Faith Office, led by the Rev. Paula White, who has served as a religious
adviser to him for many years.</p>
<p>Trump established a similar office at the White House during his
first term and regularly consulted with a tight group of evangelical
advisers.</p>
<p>Trump also said he would create a new commission on religious
liberty, and he criticized the Biden administration for the
“persecution” of believers for prosecuting anti-abortion advocates.</p>
<p>In 2023, the National Prayer Breakfast split into two events, the one
on Capitol Hill attended by lawmakers and a separate private event for
thousands at a hotel ballroom after some lawmakers sought to distance
themselves from the private religious group following questions over how
it was run and funded.</p>

<h2 id="trump-imposes-sanctions-on-international-criminal-court">Trump
imposes sanctions on International Criminal Court</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday authorized
economic and travel sanctions targeting people who work on International
Criminal Court investigations of U.S. citizens or U.S. allies such as
Israel, repeating action he took during his first term.  </p>
<p>The move coincides with a visit to Washington by Israel’s Prime
Minister Benajmin Netanyahu, who – along with his former defense
minister and a leader of Palestinian militant group Hamas – is wanted by
the ICC over the war in the Gaza Strip.  </p>
<p>It was unclear how quickly the U.S. would announce names of people
sanctioned. During the first Trump administration in 2020, Washington
imposed sanctions on then-prosecutor Fatou Bensouda and one of her top
aides over the ICC’s investigation into alleged war crimes by American
troops in Afghanistan. </p>
<p>The ICC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The
sanctions include freezing any U.S. assets of those designated and
barring them and their families from visiting the United States. </p>
<p>The 125-member ICC is a permanent court that can prosecute
individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and the
crime of aggression against the territory of member states or by their
nationals. The United States, China, Russia and Israel are not members.
 </p>
<p>Trump signed the executive order after U.S. Senate Democrats last
week blocked a Republican-led effort to pass legislation setting up a
sanctions regime targeting the war crimes court.  </p>
<p>The court has taken measures to shield staff from possible U.S.
sanctions, paying salaries three months in advance, as it braced for
financial restrictions that could cripple the war crimes tribunal,
sources told Reuters last month. </p>
<p>In December, the court’s president, judge Tomoko Akane, warned that
sanctions would “rapidly undermine the Court’s operations in all
situations and cases, and jeopardize its very existence.”</p>
<p>Russia has also taken aim at the court. In 2023, the ICC issued an
arrest warrant for President Vladimir Putin, accusing him of the war
crime of illegally deporting hundreds of children from Ukraine. Russia
has banned entry to ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan and placed him and
two ICC judges on its wanted list.</p>

<h2 id="us-senate-confirms-trump-budget-director-pick-vought">US Senate
confirms Trump budget director pick Vought</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Republican-led U.S. Senate confirmed President
Donald Trump’s nominee Russell Vought as budget director on Thursday,
placing the reins of government funding in the hands of a hard-line
conservative who has advocated for reducing Congress’s power over
taxpayer dollars.</p>
<p>The Senate voted 53-47 to confirm Vought after a marathon overnight
session during which Democrats denounced him as a dangerous far-right
ideologue and blasted Republicans for rubber-stamping Trump’s
nomination.</p>
<p>Vought, who also headed the Office of Management and Budget during
Trump’s first presidential term, raised concerns among members of both
parties by criticizing a 1974 law preventing presidents from
unilaterally blocking congressionally approved funding, a practice known
as “impoundment.”</p>
<p>In his two confirmation hearings, Vought repeatedly said he believed
a 1974 law was unconstitutional, a position that even the Republican
committee chairmen said they did not fully support.</p>
<p>Last week, the White House Budget Office issued a memo freezing
hundreds of billions of dollars in federal grants and loans. The White
House said the freeze was necessary to ensure aid programs were aligned
with Trump’s priorities including his executive orders to end diversity,
equity and inclusion efforts.</p>
<p>The White House rescinded the memo and a federal judge temporarily
blocked the freeze, but not before the action raised widespread fears
about the future critical government-funded services and concerns that
Trump could take unilateral action against other government funding.</p>
<p>Democrats sought to link Vought’s role in the hard-right Project 2025
policy initiative to a range of administration actions, including the
Trump administration’s unilateral actions to essentially shutter the
U.S. Agency for International Development and fire prosecutors at the
Justice Department.</p>
<p>“Whether it’s with federal workers, whether it’s at USAID, whether
it’s hurting Justice Department prosecutors, all of that is Russell
Vought at work,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said on a floor
speech.</p>
<p>“He’s working to hurt you, Mr. and Mrs. America.”</p>
<p>Republicans championed Vought’s experience as budget director and the
role they expect him to play in cutting wasteful government
spending.</p>
<p>“Identifying ways to rein in our spending – and to target government
waste – has to be a priority. And I’m confident that Mr. Vought will
help lead that charge,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune said this
week. “There is no question that he will be able to hit the ground
running.”</p>

<h2 id="treaty-obliges-us-to-defend-panama-canal-says-rubio">Treaty
obliges US to defend Panama Canal, says Rubio</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>STATE DEPARTMENT — The United States has a treaty obligation to
protect the Panama Canal if it comes under attack, U.S. Secretary of
State Marco Rubio said Thursday, amid confusion and what Panama has
described as “lies” regarding whether U.S. Navy ships can transit the
Panama Canal for free.</p>
<p>“I find it absurd that we would have to pay fees to transit a zone
that we are obligated to protect in a time of conflict. Those are our
expectations. … They were clearly understood in those conversations,”
Rubio said during a press conference in Santo Domingo, the capital of
the Dominican Republic. He held talks with Panamanian President Jose
Rauu Mulino in Panama City on Sunday.</p>
<p>Rubio was referring to a treaty signed by the U.S. and Panama in
1977.</p>
<p>The top U.S. diplomat told reporters that while he respects Panama’s
democratically elected government and acknowledges that it has “a
process of laws and procedures that it needs to follow,” the treaty
obligation “would have to be enforced by the armed forces the United
States, particularly the U.S. Navy.”</p>
<p>The U.S. intends to pursue an amicable resolution, Rubio said.</p>
<p>Mulino posted on X that he planned to speak with U.S. President
Donald Trump on Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the U.S. State Department said, via a social media post
on X, that U.S. government vessels can now transit the Panama Canal
without incurring fees, saving the U.S. government millions of dollars
annually.</p>
<p>But the Panama Canal Authority, an autonomous agency overseen by the
Panamanian government, disputed the U.S. claim, saying that it has made
no adjustments to these fees. It also expressed its willingness to
engage in dialogue with relevant U.S. officials.</p>
<p>During his weekly press conference on Thursday, the Panamanian
president denied his country had reached a deal allowing U.S. warships
to transit the Panama Canal for free, saying he completely rejected the
State Department’s statement.</p>
<p>Belt and Road Initiative</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mulino told reporters that the Panamanian Embassy in
Beijing had provided China with the required 90-day notice of its
decision to exit the Belt and Road Initiative, also known as BRI.</p>
<p>He denied that the decision was made at Washington’s request, saying
that he was taking time to assess Panama’s relationship with China and
decide what would best serve his country’s interests.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what the incentive was for the person who signed that
agreement with China,” Mulino said in Spanish, adding that he did not
think the BRI had brought major benefits to his country.</p>
<p>Panama joined China’s BRI under former President Juan Carlos Varela.
The agreement was signed in 2018, following Panama’s decision in 2017 to
establish its diplomatic relations with China and sever ties with
Taiwan.</p>
<p>Rubio has welcomed Panama’s decision not to renew its participation
in China’s BRI.</p>
<p>China describes the BRI, which was launched in 2013 under President
Xi Jinping, as a vast infrastructure initiative designed to connect
multiple continents through land and maritime routes.</p>
<p>The United States has warned that the project is driven by China’s
mission to manipulate and undermine the global rules-based trading
system for its own benefit.</p>
<p>In Beijing, Chinese officials dismissed what they called the U.S.’s
“irresponsible remarks on the Panama Canal issue” and accused Washington
of intentionally distorting, attacking and mischaracterizing relevant
cooperation.</p>
<p>“China firmly opposes it and made stern demarches to the U.S. side,”
said Lin Jian, a spokesperson for China’s Foreign Ministry.</p>
<p>While in Santo Domingo, Rubio met with Dominican President Luis
Abinader and Foreign Minister Roberto Alvarez.</p>
<p>The Dominican Republic is the final stop on Rubio’s five-nation tour
across Central America and the Caribbean, which focuses on curbing
illegal immigration, combating drug trafficking and countering China’s
growing influence in the Western Hemisphere.</p>
<p>Some information for this report came from The Associated Press,
Agence France Presse and Reuters.</p>

House monitoring China’s complaint on Trump tariffs at WTO</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>white house — The White House on Thursday said it was monitoring a
complaint by China to the World Trade Organization that accuses the
United States of making “unfounded and false allegations” about China’s
role in the fentanyl trade to justify tariffs on Chinese products.</p>
<p>The complaint was made Wednesday, a day after President Donald Trump
raised tariffs on Chinese goods by 10%. The White House said the new
duties on Chinese goods were aimed at halting the flow of fentanyl
opioids and their precursor chemicals.</p>
<p>China said it was imposing retaliatory tariffs on some American goods
beginning February 10, including 15% duties on coal and natural gas
imports and 10% on petroleum, agricultural equipment, high-emission
vehicles and pickup trucks. The country also immediately implemented
restrictions on the export of certain critical minerals and launched an
antitrust investigation into American tech giant Google.</p>
<p>In the WTO filing, China said the U.S. tariff measures were
“discriminatory and protectionist” and violated international trade
rules. Beijing has requested a consultation with Washington.</p>
<p>China’s request will kick-start a process within the WTO’s Appellate
Body, which has the final say on dispute settlements. A White House
official told VOA the administration was monitoring Beijing’s file but
did not provide further details.</p>
<p>Analysts say Beijing’s move is largely performative and unlikely to
yield much relief. The Appellate Body has been largely paralyzed
following the first Trump administration’s 2019 move to block
appointments of appellate judges over what it viewed as judicial
overreach. The Biden administration continued the policy.</p>
<p>China recognizes the WTO is not going to put a lot of pressure on the
United States because Washington is fully capable of blocking any legal
process there, said Jeffrey Schott, senior fellow at the Peterson
Institute for International Economics.</p>
<p>“So instead, I think the Chinese reaction has been moderate in
indicating that they will act tit for tat against U.S. trade,” he told
VOA.</p>
<p>Schott added that there’s “a desire to keep things cool” and moderate
the damage, just as what happened during the first Trump administration
when a trade deal was agreed upon after initial retaliatory trade
actions.</p>
<p>On the U.S. side, the 10% tariffs against China are much lower than
the up to 60% that Trump promised during his presidential campaign, he
said. </p>
<p>Trump-Xi call</p>
<p>Trump imposed import duties on Beijing after delaying his actions to
impose 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada following conversations Monday
with their leaders. Tariff critics are hoping that a conversation
between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping could lead to similar
results.</p>
<p>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday that the
call “is being scheduled and will happen very soon.”</p>
<p>However, Trump has dismissed the negative impact of China’s tariffs
and said he was “in no rush” to speak with Xi.</p>
<p>“We’ll speak to him at the appropriate time,” Trump told reporters at
the White House on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Unlike Trump’s deal with Mexico and Canada, an agreement with Beijing
is unlikely to come quickly, considering strong bipartisan support for
placing tariffs on China because of concern about the influx of illegal
drugs and other national security concerns, said Rachel Ziemba, an
adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security.</p>
<p>“Even if they come up with some kind of agreement to settle this
particular tariff or to remove the countertariffs, there will probably
be more tariffs on China later in this administration,” she told
VOA.</p>
<p>The U.S. Postal Service on Tuesday announced that it was suspending
acceptance of inbound packages from China and Hong Kong, closing a
loophole that Chinese garment and other consumer goods companies have
used in the past. These companies, including Shein and Temu as well as
Amazon vendors, bypassed existing U.S. tariffs by shipping to American
customers directly from China.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, USPS reversed its decision, saying it would work with
Customs and Border Protection on a way to collect the new tariffs. </p>
<p>The Postal Service “will continue accepting all international inbound
mail and packages from China and Hong Kong Posts,” it said. “The USPS
and Customs and Border Protection are working closely together to
implement an efficient collection mechanism for the new China tariffs to
ensure the least disruption to package delivery.”</p>
<p>It is unclear how the fee will be collected in such direct
transactions between Chinese sellers and American buyers.</p>
<p>Trump’s trade actions on China, Canada and Mexico, as well as his
threat to impose duties on all foreign shipments into the country,
including from European allies, have caused confusion and uncertainty
across global trade. </p>
<p>Businesses usually respond to trade uncertainty by holding off on
investments or passing on increased costs to customers. But the damage
goes beyond small and large businesses domestically and abroad, Ziemba
said.</p>
<p>“If one of the U.S. goals is relying less on China and Chinese supply
chains for critical minerals, for energy, for other things like that,
then the uncertainty about whether there’s going to be tariffs and
investment restrictions on its allies fly in the face of that goal,” she
said.</p>

<p>date: 2025-02-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The new tariffs on Chinese imports, imposed by President Donald Trump
this month, include a provision that will close a loophole that Chinese
online retailers used for their U.S.-bound exports. The “de minimis”
exemption that applies to packages worth less than $800 is commonly used
by Chinese online retailers such as Shein and Temu to ship goods at a
lower price directly to U.S. consumers.</p>

id="us-judge-blocks-trump-offer-for-government-workers-until-at-least-monday">US
judge blocks Trump offer for government workers until at least
Monday</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A U.S. judge on Thursday temporarily blocked the Trump
administration’s proposed incentive for federal workers until at least
Monday, giving an initial win to labor unions that sued to stop it. </p>
<p>The ruling by U.S. District Judge George O’Toole in Boston pushes
back a midnight deadline set by the Trump administration, which is
pressing federal workers to leave their jobs in an unprecedented drive
to overhaul the federal government. </p>
<p>O’Toole could opt to delay the buyout further or block it on a more
permanent basis when he next considers the legal challenge by the unions
at a hearing on Monday. </p>
<p>The proposal has upended Washington, sparking street protests and
accusations by labor unions and opposition Democrats that Republican
President Donald Trump is violating multiple laws. </p>
<p>The offer promises to pay employees’ salaries until October, but that
may not be ironclad. Current spending laws expire on March 14 and there
is no guarantee that salaries will be funded beyond that point. </p>
<p>The Education Department told staffers who accept it that their
paychecks could stop at any time, media outlets reported. Labor unions
and Democrats have said the offer is not trustworthy.  </p>
<p>Some federal employees said they were heartened by Thursday’s court
ruling. </p>
<p>“It’s a glimmer of hope that the courts might help us and block the
whole resignation program,” said an employee at the General Services
Administration, which manages federal properties.  </p>
<p>The buyout encompasses not only employees at domestic agencies like
the Environmental Protection Agency that have traditionally drawn the
ire of Trump’s Republicans, but intelligence agencies like the CIA as
well. </p>
<p>White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said more than 40,000
federal employees had accepted the offer so far, roughly 2% of the
federal government’s 2.3 million civilian workforce. </p>
<p>Roughly 6% of federal workers retire or resign in a typical year,
according to the nonprofit Partnership for Public Service. </p>
<p>The administration said earlier in the day that those who do not
accept the buyout could lose their jobs. </p>
<p>The White House has sought to identify workers hired within the last
two years, who lack full civil-service protections and would be easier
to fire. </p>
<p>It has also ordered agency officials to identify those appointed by
Trump’s predecessor, former President Joe Biden, who remain in
civil-service jobs, as well as those who have received poor performance
ratings. </p>
<p>Federal workers say they are operating in a climate of fear and
uncertainty. </p>
<p>Workers said they were downloading pay and benefit records that they
feared could be erased from government computers as they weighed whether
to take a buyout deal that might not be honored or stay on with the
knowledge they could be fired. </p>
<p>The White House says it is following through on Trump’s campaign
promise to cut wasteful spending and slim down a bureaucracy that many
conservatives see as left-leaning and unresponsive to the president’s
agenda. </p>
<p>Trump has tasked Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, with leading
the overhaul effort. </p>
<p>Musk and his aides have moved rapidly, turning up at agencies
throughout Washington to demand access to sensitive information,
including personnel files. Their efforts have resulted in purges of
staff in several departments and a significant scaling down of
operations of America’s main humanitarian aid agency, the U.S. Agency
for International Development.  </p>
<p>Among the data Musk’s team has been examining are Medicare and
Medicaid payments to older Americans and lower-income enrollees.</p>

id="though-china-might-aim-to-fill-aid-void-left-by-usaid-its-own-challenges-could-limit-it">Though
China might aim to fill aid void left by USAID, its own challenges could
limit it</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. foreign aid agency broadly shut down by the
Trump administration has long been criticized by Beijing. But as USAID
projects wind down, will Beijing step in to try to build influence? Some
analysts say although China will want to fill the vacuum, its own
economic problems could limit what it will do.  </p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is now the acting director
of U.S. Agency for International Development, said he will bring the
agency’s activities in line with the agenda of the new government. </p>
<p>“These are taxpayer dollars, and we owe the American people
assurances that every dollar we are spending abroad is being spent on
something that furthers our national interest,” he told reporters while
visiting El Salvador earlier this week. </p>
<p>USAID had an annual budget of more than $40 billion and managed aid
programs around the world, including a China-related program that has
become a target of criticism by the White House. </p>
<p>On a “waste and abuse” fact sheet released on Feb. 3, the White House
said USAID had given millions of dollars to EcoHealth Alliance, a U.S.
organization working on protections against infectious disease. The
organization has been accused of working with Wuhan Institute of
Virology on coronavirus research that had caused the COVID-19 pandemic.
Both EcoHealth Alliance and the Chinese government have rejected those
accusations. </p>
<p>Agency has framed funding as strategy</p>
<p>In recent years, USAID has increasingly framed its funding for
China-related programs as a strategy to contain China’s global expansion
through aid and investments. </p>
<p>An archived page of USAID’s now-closed website shows that the agency
lauded its “Countering Chinese Influence Fund” as one of its “key
accomplishments.” The fund “will advance national-security goals” to
“build more resilient partners that are able to withstand pressure from
the CCP and other malign actors.” </p>
<p>Michael Schiffer, former USAID assistant administrator for Asia, told
a congressional panel in 2023 that the agency had for more than a decade
supported data collection on China’s overseas investments through
AidData, a research group at the College of William and Mary in the U.S.
state of Virginia.</p>
<p>The funding freeze has put at least one such USAID-funded project in
financial trouble. Brian Eyler, a researcher at the Stimson Center in
Washington, wrote in a public post on Facebook that his project, Mekong
Dams Monitor, has difficulty continuing operation because of the
freeze. </p>
<p>“We are ordered to stop work on those grants for 90 days pending
further review. And that means our Southeast Asia program might not be
able to keep the lights on,” he wrote.   </p>
<p>Eyler’s project was launched by the State Department during the first
Trump administration to study how dams built by China and other
countries on the Mekong River in southeast Asia have negatively affected
communities downstream. According to Eyler’s post, the project received
funding from both the State Department and USAID.   </p>
<p>Chinese state media had accused the project of smearing China. </p>
<p>VOA Mandarin reached out to Stimson Center for more details but did
not receive a response.   </p>
<p>On Wednesday, Rubio said the Trump administration is in the process
of identifying programs that are exempted from the funding freeze.  </p>
<p>“This [is] not about ending foreign aid. It is about structuring it
in a way that furthers the national interest of the United States,”
Rubio said during his multiday trip to Latin America.</p>
<p>Critics of USAID </p>
<p>USAID also has been a target of Beijing’s ire. China’s foreign
ministry released a report last year accusing USAID programs of
corruption and prioritizing the advancement of U.S. interests.</p>
<p>The shutdown of USAID has been met with cheers and celebrations on
the Chinese internet, where anti-U.S. narratives permeate. Many users
praised Elon Musk, the billionaire and head of the Department of
Government Efficiency, for closing the agency.   </p>
<p>Musk previously posted on X describing USAID as “a criminal
organization” and that it is time “for it to die.” </p>
<p>USAID critics</p>
<p>Critics of the funding freeze and the shuttering of USAID worry that
Beijing will see this as an opportunity to fill the void left by the
U.S. </p>
<p>“China has spent trillions of dollars in numerous countries because
it is interested in pulling them into its sphere of influence,” U.S.
Democratic Senator Chris Coons wrote in The Washington Post. </p>
<p>Steven Balla, an associate professor of political science and
international affairs at George Washington University in Washington,
D.C., told VOA Mandarin he agrees with the assessment. But he said
China’s plan to expand foreign aid is likely to be hindered by its
lingering domestic problems. </p>
<p>“You think about youth unemployment; you think about the real estate
bubble and so forth,” he said. “That might make it difficult for the Xi
administration to aggressively expand into new parts of the world
because the U.S is pulling back.”</p>
<p>Some activists worry that even if China tries to fill the void,
certain areas where there once were U.S. aid programs will not receive
the same kind of funding, if at all.   </p>
<p>A former environmental lawyer in China who now lives in the U.S. told
VOA Mandarin that, compared to U.S. aid programs, China’s assistance is
of a more transactional nature and seeks financial returns. She wants to
remain anonymous because she fears harassment from Beijing. </p>
<p>A 2021 report released by China shows that between 2013 and 2018,
China had spent $376 billion on foreign aid, 45% of which went to Africa
in areas such as agriculture, medical assistance, food supply, disease
control, and climate change. </p>
<p>The former environmental lawyer said if it is entirely left for China
to provide aid, areas such as women’s rights and natural resource
management will lose a large portion of funding, if not entirely,
because China is not interested in improving local governance. </p>
<p>“There will certainly be a very severe impact on the African people,”
she said, “which isn’t something you’ll be able to see within just a day
or two.”</p>

<h2 id="us-imposes-new-sanctions-targeting-iran-oil-exports">US imposes
new sanctions targeting Iran oil exports</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The U.S. Treasury Department announced on Thursday new sanctions on
Iran’s oil industry, targeting an international network that facilitates
the shipment of millions of barrels of Iranian oil to China.</p>
<p>In a release, the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets
Control, or OFAC, said the sanctions target Sepehr Energy, a front
company through which Iran’s Armed Forces General Staff, or AFGS, ships
the oil. The sanctions include entities and individuals in China, India
and the United Arab Emirates, as well as several vessels.</p>
<p>The office said Sepehr Energy and its affiliate companies, which
operate under the AFGS, use “deceitful evasion methods,” including the
falsification of maritime documents, to disguise the Iranian origin of
the oil that it trades and transports to overseas buyers, including
China.</p>
<p>The OFAC said each year, the illicit sales generate the equivalent of
billions of dollars, which Iran uses to fund its destabilizing regional
activities and support of multiple regional terrorist groups, including
Hamas, the Houthis and Hezbollah.</p>
<p>Iran’s mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately
respond to a request for comment from Reuters.</p>
<p>In the statement, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Iran
also uses the funds to develop its nuclear program and the production of
deadly ballistic missiles and military drones.</p>
<p>“The United States is committed to aggressively targeting any attempt
by Iran to secure funding for these malign activities,” he said.</p>
<p>In a separate statement, U.S. State Department spokesperson Tammy
Bruce said the United States will not tolerate Iran’s destructive and
destabilizing behavior.</p>
<p>“We will use all tools at our disposal to hold the regime accountable
for its destabilizing activities and pursuit of nuclear weapons that
threaten the civilized world,” she said.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive
order mandating the U.S. government impose maximum pressure on Tehran to
dissuade it from pursuing its nuclear program. Iran has said its nuclear
program is for peaceful purposes.</p>
<p>Some information for this report came from The Associated Press and
Reuters.</p>

lawmakers push to ban AI app DeepSeek from US government devices</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — A bipartisan duo in the U.S. House is proposing
legislation to ban the Chinese artificial intelligence app DeepSeek from
federal devices, similar to the policy already in place for the popular
social media platform TikTok.</p>
<p>Lawmakers Josh Gottheimer, a Democrat from New Jersey, and Darin
LaHood, a Republican from Illinois, on Thursday introduced the “No
DeepSeek on Government Devices Act,” which would ban federal employees
from using the Chinese AI app on government-owned electronics. They
cited the Chinese government’s ability to use the app for surveillance
and misinformation as reasons to keep it away from federal networks.</p>
<p>“The Chinese Communist Party has made it abundantly clear that it
will exploit any tool at its disposal to undermine our national
security, spew harmful disinformation, and collect data on Americans,”
Gottheimer said in a statement. “We simply can’t risk the CCP
infiltrating the devices of our government officials and jeopardizing
our national security.”</p>
<p>The proposal comes after the Chinese software company in January
published an AI model that performed at a competitive level with models
developed by American firms like OpenAI, Meta, Alphabet and others.
DeepSeek purported to develop the model at a fraction of the cost of its
American counterparts. The announcement raised alarm bells and prompted
debates among policymakers and leading Silicon Valley financiers and
technologists.</p>
<p>The churn over AI is coming at a moment of heightened competition
between the U.S. and China in a range of areas, including technological
innovation. The U.S. has levied tariffs on Chinese goods, restricted
Chinese tech firms like Huawei from being used in government systems,
and banned the export of state of the art microchips thought to be
needed to develop the highest end AI models.</p>
<p>Last year, Congress and then-President Joe Biden approved a
divestment of the popular social media platform TikTok from its Chinese
parent company or face a ban across the U.S.; that policy is now on
hold. President Donald Trump, who originally proposed a ban of the app
in his first term, signed an executive order last month extending a
window for a long-term solution before the legally required ban takes
effect.</p>
<p>In 2023, Biden banned TikTok from federal-issued devices.</p>
<p>“The technology race with the Chinese Communist Party is not one the
United States can afford to lose,” LaHood said in a statement. “This
commonsense, bipartisan piece of legislation will ban the app from
federal workers’ phones while closing backdoor operations the company
seeks to exploit for access. It is critical that Congress safeguard
Americans’ data and continue to ensure American leadership in AI.”</p>
<p>The bill would single out DeepSeek and any AI application developed
by its parent company, the hedge fund High-Flyer, as subject to the ban.
The legislation includes exceptions for national security and research
purposes that would allow federal employers to study DeepSeek.</p>
<p>Some lawmakers wish to go further. A bill proposed last week by
Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, would bar the import or
export of any AI technology from China writ large, citing national
security concerns.</p>

service member, 3 contractors die in plane crash in Philippines</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MANILA, PHILIPPINES — One U.S. service member and three defense
contractors were killed Thursday when a plane contracted by the U.S.
military crashed in a rice field in the southern Philippines, U.S.
Indo-Pacific Command said.</p>
<p>The aircraft was conducting a routine mission “providing
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance support at the request of
our Philippine allies,” the command said in a statement. It said the
cause of the crash was under investigation.</p>
<p>The Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines also confirmed the
crash of a light plane in Maguindanao del Sur province. It did not
immediately provide other details.</p>
<p>The bodies of the four people were retrieved from the wreckage in
Ampatuan town, said Ameer Jehad Tim Ambolodto, a safety officer of
Maguindanao del Sur. Indo-Pacific Command said the names of the crew
were being withheld pending family notifications.</p>
<p>Windy Beaty, a provincial disaster-mitigation officer, told The
Associated Press that she received reports that residents saw smoke
coming from the plane and heard an explosion before the aircraft
plummeted to the ground less than a kilometer from a cluster of
farmhouses.</p>
<p>Nobody was reported injured on or near the crash site, which was
cordoned off by troops, Beaty said.</p>
<p>U.S. forces have been deployed in a Philippine military camp in the
country’s south for decades to help provide advice and training to
Filipino forces battling Muslim militants. The region is the homeland of
minority Muslims in the largely Roman Catholic nation.</p>

<h2 id="trumps-us-trade-negotiator-pick-vows-hard-line-policies">Trump’s
US trade negotiator pick vows hard-line policies</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Jamieson Greer, President Donald Trump’s choice to be
the top U.S. trade negotiator, promised to pursue the president’s
hard-line trade policies in testimony Thursday before the Senate Finance
Committee. But he faced pushback from senators unsettled by Trump’s
unpredictable actions on trade.</p>
<p>Trump’s protectionist approach — involving the heavy use of taxes on
foreign goods — will give Americans “the opportunity to work in
good-paying jobs producing goods and services they can sell in this
market and abroad to earn an honest living,” Greer said in remarks
prepared ahead of his confirmation hearing.</p>
<p>As U.S. trade representative, Greer would have responsibility along
with commerce secretary nominee Howard Lutnick for one of Trump’s top
policy priorities: waging — or at least threatening — trade war with
countries around the world, America’s friends and foes alike.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Trump signed orders imposing tariffs on Canada and
Mexico — America’s two biggest trading partners. Then on Monday, he
turned around and gave those countries a 30-day reprieve from the
tariffs after their leaders made modest concessions on stopping the flow
of undocumented immigrants and illegal drugs into the United States.</p>
<p>“Trump governs by whim, and in trade that hurts American families,”
said Oregon Senator Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the finance
committee. “His tariff bluff created huge uncertainty that is costing
American businesses and putting the global economy on a month-to-month
lease.”</p>
<p>Trump believes that imposing tariffs — import taxes — on U.S. trade
partners can reduce America’s massive trade deficits, protect U.S.
industry from competition, bring manufacturing back to the United States
and pressure other countries into making concessions on a variety of
issues, including reducing illegal immigration and cracking down on drug
trafficking.</p>
<p>The hostilities have already begun. On Tuesday, the United States
imposed a 10% tariff on Chinese imports on top of levies imposed in
Trump’s first term. Beijing promptly lashed back, announcing tariffs on
U.S. coal, crude oil and other products, restricting exports of critical
minerals and launching an antitrust investigation of Google.</p>
<p>But the Chinese tariffs don’t take effect until Monday, buying time
for the two countries to reach some kind of truce. That is what happened
earlier this week. Trump had signed an order Saturday hitting imports
from America’s two biggest trade partners, Canada and Mexico, with 25%
tariffs. They were supposed to take effect Tuesday, too, but were called
off — and delayed for 30 days — after Mexican President Claudia
Sheinbaum and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau agreed Monday to do
more to stop the flow of undocumented immigrants and fentanyl across
U.S. borders.</p>
<p>Economists have warned that Trump’s tariffs would disrupt trade and
drive up prices for American consumers. Democrats and others have also
criticized the impulsive and unpredictable way that Trump conducts trade
policy and his decision to target America’s neighbors and allies, not
limiting his tariff onslaught to U.S. geopolitical rival China.</p>
<p>Wyden expressed concern about Trump’s campaign promises to impose an
across-the-board “universal” tariff on imports as opposed to targeting
China and other countries for unfair trade practices or protecting
workers in specific industries struggling with foreign competition.</p>
<p>The universal tariffs, Wyden said, amount to a “prescription for
hitting our citizens, small businesses, really hard and also raising
inflationary pressures.”</p>
<p>Greer responded that universal tariffs “should be studied” as a way
to possibly lower America’s massive trade deficits. Greer was a veteran
of Trump’s first-term trade battles, serving as chief of staff to
then-U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. In that position,
Greer was involved in a U.S.-China trade brawl that saw the world’s two
biggest economies slap tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth
of each other’s goods.</p>
<p>He also played a role in Trump’s contentious and successful campaign
to rewrite a North American trade agreement with Mexico and Canada and
to get Congress to approve the new pact.</p>
<p>Earlier, Greer, a graduate of the University of Virginia law school,
served as a lawyer in the U.S. Air Force’s Advocate General’s Corps,
doing a tour in Iraq and serving as a prosecutor and defense counsel in
criminal cases involving U.S. airmen.</p>
<p>After Trump’s first term, Greer joined the Washington law firm King
&amp; Spalding, representing clients in cases before the Commerce
Department, the International Trade Commission and federal courts.</p>

<h2 id="trump-attends-national-prayer-breakfast">Trump attends National
Prayer Breakfast</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump said Thursday that his
relationship with religion had “changed” after a pair of failed
assassination attempts last year, as he advocated at the National Prayer
Breakfast at the Capitol for Americans to “bring God back into our
lives.”</p>
<p>Trump joined a Washington tradition of more than 70 years that brings
together a bipartisan group of lawmakers for fellowship. He was also to
speak at a separate prayer breakfast at a Washington hotel sponsored by
a private group.</p>
<p>“I really believe you can’t be happy without religion, without that
belief,” Trump said. “Let’s bring religion back. Let’s bring God back
into our lives.”</p>
<p>Trump reflected on having a bullet coming close to killing him at a
rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, last year, telling lawmakers and
attendees, “It changed something in me, I feel.”</p>
<p>He continued: “I feel even stronger. I believed in God, but I feel, I
feel much more strongly about it. Something happened.”</p>
<p>He drew laughs when he expressed gratitude that the episode “didn’t
affect my hair.” The president, who’s a nondenominational Christian,
called religious liberty “part of the bedrock of American life” and
called for protecting it with “absolute devotion.”</p>
<p>Trump and his administration have already clashed with religious
leaders, including him disagreeing with the Reverend Mariann Budde’s
sermon the day after his inauguration, when she called for mercy for
members of the LGBTQ+ community and migrants who are in the country
illegally.</p>
<p>Vice President JD Vance, who is Catholic, has sparred with top U.S.
leaders of his own church over immigration issues. And many clergy
members across the country are worried about the removal of churches
from the sensitive-areas list, allowing federal officials to conduct
immigration actions at places of worship.</p>
<p>The Republican president made waves at the final prayer breakfast
during his first term. That year the gathering came the day after the
Senate acquitted him in his first impeachment trial.</p>
<p>Trump in his remarks then threw not-so-subtle barbs at Democratic
then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, who publicly said she
prayed for Trump, and Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, who had cited his
faith in his decision to vote to convict Trump. “I don’t like people who
use their faith as justification for doing what they know is wrong.”</p>
<p>Trump said then in his winding speech, in which he also held up two
newspapers with banner headlines about his acquittal. “Nor do I like
people who say, ‘I pray for you,’ when they know that that’s not
so.”</p>
<p>Dwight D. Eisenhower was the first president to attend the prayer
breakfast, in February 1953, and every president since has spoken at the
gathering.</p>
<p>Democratic Senator Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire and Republican
Senator Roger Marshall of Kansas are the honorary co-chairs of this
year’s prayer breakfast.</p>
<p>In 2023, the National Prayer Breakfast split into two dueling events,
the one on Capitol Hill largely attended by lawmakers and government
officials and a larger private event for thousands at a hotel
ballroom.</p>
<p>The split occurred when lawmakers sought to distance themselves from
the private religious group that for decades had overseen the bigger
event, due to questions about its organization and how it was funded. In
2023 and 2024, President Joe Biden, a Democrat, spoke at the Capitol
Hill event, and his remarks were livestreamed to the other
gathering.</p>

id="mexico-deploys-the-first-of-10000-troops-to-us-border-after-trumps-tariff-threat">Mexico
deploys the first of 10,000 troops to US border after Trump’s tariff
threat</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CIUDAD JUÁREZ, MEXICO — A line of Mexican National Guard and Army
trucks rumbled along the border separating Ciudad Juárez and El Paso,
Texas, on Wednesday, among the first of 10,000 troops Mexico has sent to
its northern frontier following tariff threats by President Donald
Trump. </p>
<p>Masked and armed National Guard members picked through brush running
along the border barrier on the outskirts of Ciudad Juárez, pulling out
makeshift ladders and ropes tucked away in the trenches, and pulling
them onto trucks. Patrols were also seen on other parts of the border
near Tijuana. </p>
<p>It comes after a turbulent week along the border after Trump
announced he would delay imposing crippling tariffs on Mexico for at
least a month. In exchange, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum promised
she would send the country’s National Guard to reinforce the border and
crack down on fentanyl smuggling. </p>
<p>Trump has declared an emergency on the border despite migration
levels and fentanyl overdoses significantly dipping over the past year.
The U.S. said it would, in turn, do more to stop American guns from
being trafficked into Mexico to fuel cartel violence, which has rippled
to other parts of the country as criminal groups fight to control the
lucrative migrant smuggling industry. </p>
<p>On Tuesday, the first of those forces arrived in border cities,
climbing out of government planes. Guard members in the Wednesday patrol
confirmed that they were part of the new force. </p>
<p>“There will be permanent surveillance on the border,” José Luis
Santos Iza, one of the National Guard leaders heading off the deployment
in the city, told media upon the arrival of the first set of soldiers.
“This operation is primarily to prevent drug trafficking from Mexico to
the United States, mainly fentanyl.” </p>
<p>At least 1,650 troops were expected to be sent to Ciudad Juárez,
according to government figures, making it one of the biggest receivers
of border reinforcements in the country, second only to Tijuana, where
1,949 are slated to be sent. </p>
<p>During U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s trip through Latin
America — where migration was at the top of the agenda — the top
American diplomat thanked the Mexican government for the forces,
according to a statement by the Mexican government. </p>
<p>The negotiation by Sheinbaum was viewed by observers as a bit of
shrewd political maneuvering by the newly elected Mexican leader. Many
had previously cast doubt that she’d be able to navigate Trump’s
presidency as effectively as her predecessor and ally, former President
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.</p>

<p>The Panama Canal Authority did not immediately respond to a request
for comment.</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Panama’s President Jose
Raul Mulino on Sunday during a trip to Central America.</p>
<p>Panama has become a focal point of the Trump administration as
President Donald Trump has accused the Central American country of
charging excessive rates to use its passage.</p>
<p>“If the principles, both moral and legal, of this magnanimous gesture
of giving are not followed, then we will demand that the Panama Canal be
returned to us, in full, and without question,” Trump said last
month.</p>
<p>Mulino has dismissed Trump’s threat that the U.S. retake control of
the canal, which it largely built. The U.S. administered territory
surrounding the passage for decades.</p>
<p>But the U.S. and Panama signed a pair of accords in 1977 that paved
the way for the canal’s return to full Panamanian control. The United
States handed it over in 1999 after a period of joint
administration.</p>

citizenship?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>President Donald Trump is reigniting a fierce debate: Should everyone
born on U.S. soil automatically become a citizen? This question strikes
at the heart of American identity, history and law. Trump signed an
executive order last month seeking to end the right, but two federal
judges have placed injunctions on the order, pausing it indefinitely.
Here’s what you need to know about birthright citizenship.</p>

id="new-attorney-general-orders-review-of-trump-cases-as-she-takes-over-the-justice-dept.">New
attorney general orders review of Trump cases as she takes over the
Justice Dept.</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — New Attorney General Pam Bondi on Wednesday issued a
series of directives designed to overhaul a Justice Department that
President Donald Trump says is biased against conservatives.</p>
<p>Hours after she was sworn in at the White House, Bondi called for the
creation of “weaponization working group” that will scrutinize the work
of special counsel Jack Smith, who charged Trump in two criminal cases.
The group will also review “unethical prosecutions” stemming from the
Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, among other things, according to
the memo.</p>
<p>Trump and his allies have contended that the Justice Department under
the Biden administration had become weaponized against conservatives.
Some of the department’s most high-profile probes concerned the
Democratic president and his son, and there’s been no evidence to
support the idea that the prosecutions against Trump were launched for a
partisan purpose.</p>
<p>It was one of 14 directives signed by Bondi designed to roll back
Biden administration policies and align the Justice Department with the
priorities of a White House that seeks to exert control over federal law
enforcement and purge agencies of career employees it views as
disloyal.</p>
<p>Among other directives Bondi signed were orders to lift the
moratorium on the federal death penalty and end federal grants
administered by the Justice Department for jurisdictions that
“unlawfully interfere with federal law enforcement.”</p>
<p>The Justice Department will provide quarterly reports to the White
House on the progress of the working group’s review, which will look for
instances where agencies’ actions “appear to have been designed to
achieve political objectives or other improper aims rather than pursuing
justice,” according to the memo.</p>
<p>In another memo, Bondi wrote that prosecutors could face firings if
they refuse to sign onto briefs or appear in court to argue on behalf of
the administration, saying it’s the department lawyers’ job to
“vigorously defend presidential policies and actions against legal
challenges.”</p>
<p>The flurry of activity signals a dramatic reshaping of the Justice
Department under Bondi, a longtime Trump ally and former Florida
attorney general who defended the president during his first impeachment
trial against allegations that he abused the power of his office.</p>
<p>Democrats who opposed Bondi’s confirmation have raised concerns about
whether she would be able to lead a Justice Department free of influence
from the White House given her close relationship with the president,
who repeatedly suggested on the campaign trail that he would seek to use
the justice system to exact revenge on his perceived enemies.</p>
<p>Bondi has said that politics will play no role in her
decision-making, but she also refused at her confirmation hearing last
month to rule out potential investigations into Trump’s adversaries. She
also has repeated Trump’s claims that the prosecutions against him
amounted to political persecution, telling senators that the Justice
Department “had been weaponized for years and years and years, and it’s
got to stop.”</p>
<p>Despite the wide-ranging ambitions of the “weaponization working
group” memo, there’s no indication that the group will have
prosecutorial powers or tools such as subpoenas that could compel
subjects of the inquiries to cooperate with the new unit.</p>
<p>And though the memo purports to take aim at the “weaponization” of
the Justice Department, it excludes from review investigations into
Democrats by Biden’s Justice Department, including special counsel
probes into the former president’s handling of classified information
and his son Hunter’s gun and tax allegations, which resulted in felony
convictions before he was pardoned by his father in December.</p>
<p>Smith’s team investigated Trump over his efforts to overturn the 2020
presidential election and his hoarding of classified documents at his
Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Both of those cases resulted in
indictments that were withdrawn after Trump’s November presidential win
because of long-standing Justice Department policy prohibiting the
federal prosecution of a sitting president.</p>
<p>Bondi takes over department, which has been roiled by the firings of
career prosecutors and senior FBI officials, along with the highly
unusual scrutiny of thousands of agents involved in the sprawling Jan. 6
investigation.</p>
<p>FBI agents this week sued after the Justice Department demanded that
the bureau turn over the names of all agents involved in the Jan. 6
probe, which agents believe may be a precursor to mass firings.</p>

id="greenlanders-explore-pacific-islands-relationship-with-washington">Greenlanders
explore Pacific Islands’ relationship with Washington</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Greenland’s representative in the United States met
recently with at least one ambassador from the Pacific Islands to learn
more about a political arrangement that some think could create an
opportunity for the Arctic island and Washington, VOA has learned.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump has repeatedly expressed his interest in
either buying or taking control of Greenland, a resource-rich
semiautonomous territory of Denmark, noting its strategic importance and
position in the Arctic Ocean where Russia and China are rapidly
advancing. But there has been pushback from the island’s residents,
political leaders, Denmark and Europe.</p>
<p>Greenland representatives have declined to comment to VOA on their
meeting that focused on a framework that Pacific Island nations have
with Washington — known as the Compacts of Free Association, or COFA.
The compacts give the United States military access to three strategic
Pacific Islands — the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated
States of Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau — in exchange for
economic aid.</p>
<p>Jackson Soram, ambassador to the United States from the Federated
States of Micronesia, told VOA that the discussions took place at the
end of January and focused on “basic questions” on the “provisions of
economic assistance, and also the security and defense provisions of the
compacts.”</p>
<p>Soram said he met with representatives from Greenland and the Faroe
Islands, another self-ruled Danish territory.</p>
<p>Alexander Gray, a former National Security Council chief of staff
during the first Trump administration who worked on Pacific Island
issues, told VOA he encouraged the Pacific Islands’ ambassadors to
conduct these meetings.</p>
<p>“[The Greenlanders] want independence from Denmark,” Gray, who is now
a managing partner of American Global Strategies, said in an emailed
response. “An independent Greenland, with a tiny population and the
second-least densely populated geography on the planet, will quickly
become dominated and its sovereignty undermined by Beijing and
Moscow.”</p>
<p>Russia has been reopening bases in the region even as Beijing has
invested more than $90 billion in infrastructure projects in the Arctic
Circle. Both the United States and Denmark have military bases in
Greenland.</p>
<p>Gray said arctic dominance by Moscow and Beijing poses “a unique
strategic threat” to the United States. He said a COFA “would allow
Greenland to maintain its sovereignty, while allowing the U.S. to ensure
that sovereignty is truly protected.”</p>
<p>Denmark’s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has repeatedly told Trump
that Greenland is “not for sale.” But Monday, she said Copenhagen
welcomes additional U.S. military investment in the strategic
island.</p>
<p>“So, if this is about securing our part of the world, we can find a
way forward,” she said.</p>
<p>US-Greenland defense agreement</p>
<p>Some analysts say that neither Washington nor Nuuk needs a COFA
agreement to increase the U.S. military presence in Greenland. In 2004,
the United States, Greenland and Denmark signed the Igaliku Agreement to
reduce the U.S. military presence in Greenland to a single air base, the
Thule Air Base, which has been renamed Pitfuffik Space Base. It provides
Washington with missile defense and space surveillance.</p>
<p>The 2004 agreement provides for “any significant changes to U.S.
military operations or facilities” in Greenland to be made through
consultation between Washington, Nuuk and Copenhagen.</p>
<p>“Washington can already achieve its objectives through working with
Greenland and Denmark,” Otto Svendsen, an associate fellow at the Center
for Strategic and International Studies, wrote last month on CSIS’s
website.</p>
<p>A Danish Institute for International Studies policy brief in 2022
pointed out that COFA has created economic dependence between the
Marshall Islands and the United States, as U.S. donor money makes up 70%
of the Marshall Islands’ total GDP. This is the opposite of what
Greenland’s leaders say they want.</p>
<p>Search for independence</p>
<p>A 2009 law called the Act on Greenland Self-Government outlines a
“road map” —-drawn up by Nuuk and Copenhagen — for an independent
Greenland, which requires a successful referendum.</p>
<p>In his New Year’s address, Greenland Prime Minister Mute Egede said,
“The upcoming new election period must, together with the citizens,
create these new steps,” opening the door for a referendum during
parliamentary elections in April.</p>
<p>A 2019 survey suggested that more than two-thirds of Greenlanders
want independence at some point. Yet in a poll released in January by
two newspapers in Denmark and Greenland, 85% say they do not want to be
part of the United States. Fifty-five percent, however, see Trump’s
interest in Greenland as an opportunity.</p>
<p>Gray told VOA that the U.S., Denmark and Greenland should enter
trilateral discussions for a compact.</p>
<p>“Working together, Washington, Copenhagen, and Nuuk can find common
ground and move forward on a post-independence arrangement that works
for all parties,” he said in an emailed response.</p>
<p>Read Greenland’s 2010 letter to the United Nations</p>
<p>As far back as 2010, Greenland told the United Nations it was
exploring the idea of negotiating independence through a “free
association” with Denmark.</p>
<p>Egede said he is ready to meet with Trump, but, “We do not want to be
Danes. We do not want to be Americans.”</p>
<p>Soram said he is trying to get ambassadors from Palau and the
Marshall Islands to attend additional meetings with Greenland, the Faroe
Islands and Denmark.</p>

<h2 id="fcc-launches-media-investigations-reinstates-complaints">FCC
launches media investigations, reinstates complaints</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Federal Communications Commission has launched
investigations over the past two weeks into three news outlets and
reinstated complaints against three others. </p>
<p>Earlier this week, CBS News complied with an FCC request to hand over
the raw footage and transcript from an October interview with Democratic
presidential candidate Kamala Harris. </p>
<p>The FCC’s request for the material was “unusual,” according to Harold
Furchtgott-Roth, a Republican who served as an FCC commissioner under
President Bill Clinton.</p>
<p>“The commission doesn’t usually ask for transcripts,” he said. </p>
<p>That interview is at the center of one FCC complaint — and a $10
billion lawsuit from President Donald Trump — that says CBS doctored the
interview. CBS denied any wrongdoing when Trump filed the lawsuit, but
its parent company, Paramount, is now considering a settlement,
according to media reports.   </p>
<p>The FCC complaint against CBS is one of four that former FCC chair
Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, dismissed earlier in January, saying
the complaints “seek to weaponize the licensing authority of the FCC in
a way that is fundamentally at odds with the First Amendment.”</p>
<p>Rosenworcel’s successor, Trump-appointed Republican chair Brendan
Carr, revived the CBS complaint, plus complaints against NBC and ABC. He
did not revive a complaint against Fox News, which Rosenworcel had also
dismissed. </p>
<p>In an interview with CNN, Carr defended the inquiry into CBS. </p>
<p>“I don’t see how the FCC can reasonably adjudicate this claim of news
distortion without seeing what was actually said,” Carr said. </p>
<p>On Wednesday afternoon, CBS published the unedited transcripts on its
website, showing that the shows “60 Minutes” and “Face the Nation” used
slightly different parts of the same answer from Harris, which is common
practice in journalism.</p>
<p>FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez, a Democrat, has said the move against
CBS was “designed to instill fear in broadcast stations.” On Wednesday,
she called on the FCC to “dismiss this fishing expedition to avoid
further politicizing our enforcement actions” because the transcript and
footage showed “no evidence” that CBS and its affiliates had violated
FCC rules.</p>
<p>The “news distortion” complaint against ABC claims fact-checking by
the moderators in the preelection Harris-Trump TV debate favored
Harris. </p>
<p>The complaint against NBC claims Harris’ appearance on the comedy
show “Saturday Night Live” shortly before the election violated “equal
time” rules that govern political programming. Soon after, NBC provided
Trump with equal time by giving him a chance to directly address voters
following a NASCAR race. </p>
<p>ABC, CBS and NBC did not reply to VOA’s email requesting
comment. </p>
<p>The Center for American Rights, which filed the three complaints,
told VOA it applauded Carr’s decision to reopen them.</p>
<p>“Broadcasters are required to serve the public interest in exchange
for their access to the public airwaves,” Daniel Suhr, the group’s
president, said in an emailed statement. </p>
<p>“Free speech does not include blatantly distorting the news or
violating long-standing commission rules,” Suhr added. “We are
encouraged to see Chairman Carr addressing these serious issues.”</p>
<p>But Kim Zarkin, a professor of communication at Westminster
University in Utah who has researched the FCC for three decades, told
VOA she believes the three complaints don’t have any merit because NBC
eventually gave Trump equal time, and the CBS and ABC complaints pertain
to content. </p>
<p>“It’s the idea that the FCC would punish news organizations for
editorial decisions,” she said. “It challenges almost the entire history
of the FCC and how the FCC looks at content.” </p>
<p>The FCC has also launched investigations into NPR, PBS and the San
Francisco-based radio station KCBS. </p>
<p>“It is possible that NPR and PBS member stations are broadcasting
underwriting announcements that cross the line into prohibited
commercial advertisements,” Carr wrote in a Jan. 29 letter notifying the
two outlets about the investigations. </p>
<p>The FCC does not directly regulate NPR, PBS or other major networks.
But the independent government agency does evaluate the actions of
public broadcasting stations around the U.S. that hold FCC licenses to
use public airwaves.</p>
<p>If an FCC investigation finds wrongdoing, the agency can impose a
fine or revoke a station’s broadcast license.</p>
<p>Public broadcasting stations are not allowed to run commercials, so
they run corporate underwriting spots, which are similar to commercials
but don’t include a “call to action” urging listeners to do things like
buy a specific product. </p>
<p>Both NPR and PBS have rejected any wrongdoing. </p>
<p>What stood out to Zarkin about the NPR and PBS investigations is how
broad they are, she said. These kinds of investigations are typically
directed at specific member stations and refer to specific incidents,
she said, but that’s not the case here.  </p>
<p>“The idea that they’re sweepingly investigating NPR and PBS just in
general — that’s not how the FCC has historically done business,” said
Zarkin, who has written two books on the FCC. </p>
<p>On Monday, Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene invited
the CEOs of NPR and PBS to testify at a subcommittee hearing on what she
considers “systemically biased news coverage” from the outlets. NPR and
PBS receive a small amount of federal funding from the U.S.-chartered
Corporation for Public Broadcasting.</p>
<p>Their reporting should “serve the entire public,” Greene said, “not
just a narrow slice of like-minded individuals.” </p>
<p>In his letter to NPR and PBS, Carr said he was sharing it with
lawmakers because he thought it could inform the debate about whether to
cut funding to the two outlets. </p>
<p>“For my own part, I do not see a reason why Congress should continue
sending taxpayer dollars to NPR and PBS given the changes in the media
marketplace,” Carr wrote.</p>
<p>During his campaign, Trump threatened to revoke broadcasters’
licenses if elected. The recent flurry of FCC investigations and
complaints has raised press freedom concerns among media experts and
current and former Democratic FCC commissioners.</p>

id="second-bird-flu-strain-found-in-us-dairy-cattle-agriculture-agency-says">Second
bird flu strain found in US dairy cattle, agriculture agency says</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. dairy cattle tested positive for a strain of bird flu that
previously had not been seen in cows, the U.S. Department of Agriculture
said on Wednesday, ramping up concerns about the persistent spread of
the virus. </p>
<p>The H5N1 virus has reduced milk output in cattle, pushed up egg
prices by wiping out millions of hens, and infected nearly 70 people
since April as it has spread across the country. </p>
<p>Genome sequencing of milk from Nevada identified the different
strain, known as the D1.1 genotype, in dairy cows for the first time,
the USDA said. Previously, all 957 bird flu infections among dairy herds
reported since last March had been caused by another strain, the B3.13
genotype, according to the agency. </p>
<p>Reuters reported news of the detection of the second strain on
Wednesday ahead of USDA’s announcement. </p>
<p>The second strain was the predominant genotype among wild birds this
past fall and winter and has also been found in poultry, the USDA said.
It was identified in dairy cattle through an agency program that began
testing milk for bird flu in December. </p>
<p>“We’re seeing the H5N1 virus itself be smarter than all of us,” said
Beth Thompson, South Dakota’s state veterinarian.  </p>
<p>“It’s modifying itself so it’s not just staying in the poultry and
the wild waterfowl. It’s picking up a home in the mammals.”  </p>
<p>Wild birds likely transmitted the second strain to cattle in Nevada,
said J.J. Goicoechea, Nevada’s agriculture director. Farmers need to
ramp up safety and security measures to protect their animals, he
said. </p>
<p>“We obviously aren’t doing everything we can and everything we should
or the virus wouldn’t be getting in,” he said. </p>
<p>The Nevada Department of Agriculture said on Jan. 31 that herds in
two counties had been placed under quarantine because of bird flu
detections.  </p>
<p>It is important for the USDA to contain the outbreak in the state
quickly, so the strain does not spread to dairy cattle elsewhere, said
Gail Hansen, a veterinary and public health consultant. </p>
<p>Last year, bird flu spread across the country as infected cattle were
shipped from Texas after the virus first leapt to cows from wild
birds. </p>
<p>“We didn’t get a hold on it before,” Hansen said. “We want to avoid
that same scenario from happening in Nevada.” </p>
<p>Dairy herds that were formerly infected may be at risk again from the
second strain, experts said. </p>
<p>“Now it looks like we have new strains of virus that may escape some
of the immunity associated with the other strains of viruses that could
exacerbate the epidemics among animals and wildlife,” said Gregory Gray,
a University of Texas Medical Branch professor studying cattle
diseases.  </p>
<p>“It’s alarming.”</p>

<p>President Donald Trump’s 25% tariff on imports from Mexico,
temporarily put on hold this week, could disrupt the strategy of Chinese
companies that have relocated to northern Mexico in recent years. By
moving production closer to the U.S. market, these firms have been able

id="rubio-to-meet-with-dominican-officials-to-close-latin-america-tour">Rubio
to meet with Dominican officials to close Latin America tour</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>STATE DEPARTMENT — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is in the
Dominican Republic for talks Thursday with Dominican leaders on the last
stop of multination tour of Latin America.</p>
<p>Rubio is set to meet with Dominican President Luis Abinader and
Foreign Minister Roberto Alvarez in Santo Domingo.</p>
<p>He traveled from Guatemala, where he announced U.S. plans to support
Guatemala with new infrastructure projects and to sign waivers on
foreign aid to strengthen the U.S. partnership with that country
Wednesday.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the two countries have reached a new migration arrangement
under which Guatemala will accept 40% more deportation flights from the
United States, including both Guatemalan nationals and individuals of
other nationalities.</p>
<p>Speaking alongside Guatemalan President Bernardo Arévalo in a joint
news conference, Rubio said he had signed “a letter of support” pledging
full State Department cooperation on a partnership between Guatemala and
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.</p>
<p>The initiative aims to “begin preliminary planning for the expansion”
of “two new port facilities,” along with highway and railroad
connections to position Guatemala as a regional trade hub and boost its
economic opportunities.</p>
<p>“Today, I’ll be signing waivers on foreign aid that will continue
that partnership, and hope to build on it,” Rubio told reporters.</p>
<p>He said U.S. foreign aid has contributed to the arrest and
extradition of criminals, including members of transnational groups.</p>
<p>“Certain individuals” and “fugitives” can be extradited, and they are
actually “strategic objectives” for both the U.S. and its allies, Rubio
said while visiting a facility near the Guatemalan Air Force base, where
deportation flights arrive.</p>
<p>According to the State Department, this initiative has led to the
arrest of more than 1,400 criminal fugitives upon arrival in Guatemala
City.</p>
<p>Deportation flight</p>
<p>President Arévalo, after talks with Rubio, said the two countries
will establish working groups to finalize the details and processes for
increasing deportation flights from the United States.</p>
<p>“In this framework, we have agreed to increase by 40% the number of
flights of deportees,” both of Guatemalan nationals and “deportees from
other nationalities” for repatriation, said the president through a
translator.</p>
<p>He clarified that the “safe third country” was not discussed in title
or content, emphasizing that the new arrangement with the U.S. ensures
safe and humane conditions for repatriation.</p>
<p>The United States repatriated nearly 70,000 Guatemalans in 2024.</p>
<p>“Along with the agreement on Monday in El Salvador, as well as the
tightening of the migration accord and repatriation flights with Panama,
the Trump administration is focused on choke points on the approach to
the southern border. Panama, El Salvador, Guatemala, and maintaining
migration enforcement with Mexico will likely lead to a drastic
reduction in migrants at the southern border,” Ryan Berg, director of
the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies, told VOA on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Safe third-country agreement</p>
<p>In 2019, former Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales signed an Asylum
Cooperative Agreement, commonly known as the safe third country
agreement, with the first Trump administration.</p>
<p>The agreement was seen as part of Trump’s strategy to curb the flow
of migrants to the United States.</p>
<p>In 2021, the Biden administration fulfilled a campaign promise and
suspended the agreement, which allowed the U.S. to deny asylum seekers
at the border and deport them to a designated third country, where they
would be required to apply for asylum.</p>
<p>Critics argued that the policy exposed asylum seekers to unsafe
conditions.</p>
<p>Guatemala-Taiwan ties</p>
<p>Guatemala remains one of the few countries maintaining official ties
with Taiwan. President Arévalo has reaffirmed his commitment to
recognizing Taiwan throughout his term, despite China’s efforts to sway
Guatemala toward Beijing.</p>
<p>“We have stated from the first moment that we maintain our diplomatic
relationship with Taiwan,” Arévalo said through an interpreter during
the press conference when asked about his stance on China and Taiwan. He
added his government seeks to “further develop” ties with Taiwan in
“economics and investment.”</p>
<p>Secretary of State Rubio expressed U.S. support for expanding
Guatemala-Taiwan ties beyond diplomacy to economic cooperation.</p>
<p>In recent years, several Western Hemisphere nations—Panama, Dominican
Republic, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Honduras—have switched diplomatic
recognition from Taiwan to China. These switches have been influenced by
China’s growing economic investment in Latin America.</p>
<p>Speaking in Guatemala City, Rubio cautioned against what he described
as China’s “debt trap.”</p>
<p>“We’ve seen case after case where the Chinese Government comes in
with billions of dollars, they promise, they start a project” and “bring
in their own workers to do the work” but “in the end the project is
either incomplete” or countries are left with massive debts.</p>
<p>In Washington, Chinese Embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu dismissed
Rubio’s remarks as “malicious slander,” urging the U.S. to focus on
promoting “mutually beneficial cooperation” and “common global
development.”</p>
<p>Guatemala marks the fourth stop on Rubio’s five-nation tour across
Central America and the Caribbean, focusing on curbing illegal
immigration and combating drug trafficking.</p>
<p>Following meetings in Panama, El Salvador, Costa Rica, and Guatemala,
Rubio traveled to Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, for further
discussions with regional leaders.</p>

<h2 id="high-threat-illegal-aliens-arrive-at-guantanamo-bay">10
‘high-threat illegal aliens’ arrive at Guantanamo Bay</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PENTAGON — The first undocumented migrants — described by U.S.
officials as the “the worst of the worst” — are being held in jail cells
at the U.S. detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, waiting to be sent
home. </p>
<p>The Pentagon Wednesday confirmed 10 “high-threat illegal aliens”
arrived Tuesday at the detention facility, where they are being held
under the watch of officers with U.S. Immigration and Customs
Enforcement, or ICE.  </p>
<p>VOA first reported on the transfer — and arrival — of the migrants,
flown from Fort Bliss, Texas, to Guantanamo Bay aboard a U.S. military
C-17 cargo plane Tuesday.</p>
<p>According to the Pentagon, the detention of the high-threat migrants
at the Guantanamo Bay detention facility is a temporary measure. </p>
<p>ICE “is taking this measure to ensure the safe and secure detention
of these individuals until they can be transported to their country of
origin or other appropriate destination” the Pentagon said in a
statement. </p>
<p>U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Tuesday posted photos
on X of some of the migrants as they prepared to board the military
cargo plane, calling them “the worst of the worst,” and warning the
effort to deport them is just getting started. </p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security later said all of the migrants on
the military flight were members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan street
gang with transnational reach. Officials did not say when or how they
were first taken into custody.   </p>
<p>The White House has announced plans to designate Tren de Aragua as a
Foreign Terrorist Organization. </p>
<p>Noem, posting on X on Wednesday, said her department has overseen the
arrest of “convicted murderers, rapists, child abusers, drug
traffickers, MS-13 gang members, cartel members,” in just the past few
days. </p>
<p>Since President Donald Trump’s executive order last month, the
Pentagon has deployed 300 Marines to Guantanamo to expand the facilities
to support holding operations for undocumented immigrants. According to
media reports, they have set up tents to house the migrants inside a
fenced area at a separate part of the naval base. Those facilities are
not yet ready for migrants, according to Fox News. </p>
<p>“The number of service members will continue to fluctuate as
additional forces are tasked to deploy and will be scaled, based on the
requirements of the Department of Homeland Security, which is the lead
federal agency,” U.S. Southern Command, which oversees operations in
South America, Central America and the Caribbean, announced in a
statement on Monday. </p>
<p>The migrants who arrived Tuesday will be held at the U.S. detention
facility, according to a U.S. official who spoke on background. The
facility is known mostly for housing military prisoners and terror
suspects, including those involved in the September 11, 2001, attacks
and members of the Taliban. </p>
<p>“If you’re a violent gang banger, and you’ve been taken out of our
country, and we’re waiting to bring you to your country, we’re going to
put you in a cell box built for al-Qaida,” Secretary of Defense Pete
Hegseth told Fox News this week. </p>
<p>In his executive order last month, Trump instructed the departments
of Defense and Homeland Security to prepare the U.S. naval base to hold
up to 30,000 migrants. </p>
<p>“Some of them are so bad we don’t even trust the countries to hold
them because we don’t want them coming back. So, we’re going to send
them out to Guantanamo,” Trump said. </p>
<p>Closing Guantanamo      </p>
<p>Democratic administrations under former Presidents Barack Obama and
Joe Biden had sought to close the detention camp, which was built by the
administration of former President George W. Bush in 2002, following the
U.S. invasion of Afghanistan that began shortly after the 9/11 attacks
of 2001. </p>
<p>Sue Hendrickson, president and CEO of Human Rights First, said in a
statement that sending migrants to Guantanamo would create a human
rights catastrophe. </p>
<p>“The Trump administration may find the symbolism of sending migrants
to Guantanamo darkly appealing; its practical result would be more
injustice, waste and self-inflicted loss of credibility,” Hendrickson
said. </p>
<p>At its height during the global war on terror campaign, the detention
facility held about 680 prisoners. As of January 6, there were just 15
detainees at the facility, according to the Pentagon. </p>
<p>Before being used to detain terror suspects, the U.S. naval facility
was also used to house migrants from Cuba and Haiti in the early
1990s. </p>

deportation flight carrying illegal Indian migrants lands in Punjab</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New Delhi — A U.S. deportation flight carrying Indian nationals
accused of entering the U.S. illegally landed in the northern state of
Punjab Wednesday – the first such flight to India since the Trump
administration launched a crackdown on illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>The military aircraft, which landed amid tight security, brought 104
deportees, according to media reports. Authorities did not confirm the
number, but said the deportees will be received in a friendly
manner.</p>
<p>New Delhi, which does not want to make illegal immigration a
contentious issue with Washington, has said that it is open to the
return of undocumented Indians in the United States if their nationality
is verified.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump said last week that Indian Prime Minister
Narendra Modi had assured him that the country would “do what’s right”
in taking back illegal immigrants. His comment came following a phone
conversation with Modi.</p>
<p>In New Delhi, foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal told a
media briefing on Friday that India and the United States are engaged in
a process to deter illegal migration and “cooperation between India and
the U.S. is strong and effective in this domain. This will be evident in
times to come.”</p>
<p>Trade and migration are expected to be key issues during a meeting
that could take place next week between Trump and Modi.</p>
<p>“India does not want to focus on the issue of illegal migrants being
deported. We know it is big business in India, sending migrants
illegally. Instead, the government’s interest is in ensuring that legal
migration channels to the U.S. for Indian nationals are not restricted
by the Trump administration,” according to Manoj Joshi, Distinguished
Fellow at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi.</p>
<p>Those legal routes are H-1B visas for skilled workers and visas for
students.</p>
<p>“Both sides are engaged in a process to deter illegal migration,
while also creating more avenues for legal migration from India to the
U.S.,” Jaiswal has said.</p>
<p>The number of Indian migrants attempting to enter the U.S. unlawfully
has grown in recent years, with India now accounting for the largest
number of illegal immigrants to the United States from Asian countries,
according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data.</p>
<p>Their overall numbers, however, are still small; Indians account for
only about 3 percent of illegal crossings.</p>
<p>The United States has identified some 18,000 undocumented Indian
migrants to be sent back home, according to a Bloomberg report last
week.</p>
<p>Deportation flights to India are not new — between October 2023 and
September 2024, more than 1,000 Indian nationals were repatriated, but
Wednesday’s flight was the first time that they were sent back via
military aircraft.</p>
<p>The deportation flight was routed to Amritsar city in Punjab, which
is among the three states where much of the illegal migration from India
to the U.S. originates. The others are Haryana in the north and the
western state of Gujarat.</p>
<p>Hours before the flight landed, Punjab’s minister for NRI
(Non-Resident Indians) Affairs, Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal, urged people in
the state to avoid illegal migration and instead focus on acquiring
skills and education to access global opportunities through legal
channels.</p>

Postal Service to accept inbound parcels from China, Hong Kong after
suspension</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>HONG KONG/SEOUL/SHANGHAI — The U.S. Postal Service said on Wednesday
it would accept parcels from China and Hong Kong, in a U-turn after a
suspension following President Donald Trump ending a trade provision
used by retailers including Temu, Shein, and Amazon AMZN.O to ship
low-value packages duty-free to the U.S. </p>
<p>“The USPS and Customs and Border Protection are working closely
together to implement an efficient collection mechanism for the new
China tariffs to ensure the least disruption to package delivery,” it
said in a statement. </p>
<p>The Trump administration imposed an additional 10% tariff on Chinese
goods and closed the “de minimis” exemption that allows U.S. shoppers to
avoid paying tariffs for shipments below $800 from China. </p>
<p>USPS did not immediately comment on whether its temporary suspension
had been tied to Trump’s order ending de minimis shipments from China,
which was announced on Saturday and came into force from one minute past
midnight on Tuesday. </p>
<p>“There has really been absolutely zero time for anyone to prepare for
this,” said Maureen Cori, co-founder at New York-based consultancy
Supply Chain Compliance. “What we really need is direction from the
government on how to handle this without warning or notice.” </p>
<p>Currently, de minimis parcels are consolidated so that customs can
clear hundreds or thousands of shipments at once, but they will now
require individual clearances, significantly increasing the burden for
postal services, brokers and customs agents, said Cori.</p>

pilot Harry Stewart, Jr., one of the last surviving Tuskegee Airmen,
dies at 100</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Retired Lt. Col. Harry Stewart Jr, a decorated World War II pilot who
broke racial barriers as a Tuskegee Airmen and earned honors for his
combat heroism, has died. He was 100.</p>
<p>Stewart was one of the last surviving combat pilots of the famed
332nd Fighter Group also known as the Tuskegee Airmen. They were the
nation’s first Black military pilots.</p>
<p>The Tuskegee Airmen National Historical Museum confirmed his death.
The organization said he died peacefully at his home in Bloomfield
Hills, Michigan, on Sunday.</p>
<p>Stewart earned the Distinguished Flying Cross for downing three
German aircraft during a dogfight on April 1, 1945. He was also part of
a team of four Tuskegee Airmen who won the U.S. Air Force Top Gun flying
competition in 1949, although their accomplishment would not be
recognized until decades later.</p>
<p>“Harry Stewart was a kind man of profound character and
accomplishment with a distinguished career of service he continued long
after fighting for our country in World War II,” Brian Smith, president
and CEO of the Tuskegee Airmen National Historical Museum, said.</p>
<p>Born on July 4, 1924, in Virginia, his family moved to New York when
he was young. Stewart had dreamed of flying since he was a child when he
would watch planes at LaGuardia airport, according to a book about his
life titled “Soaring to Glory: A Tuskegee Airmen’s Firsthand Account of
World War II.” In the wake of Pearl Harbor, an 18-year-old Stewart
joined what was then considered an experiment to train Black military
pilots. The unit sometimes was also known as the Tuskegee Airmen for
where they trained in Alabama or the Red Tails because of the red tips
of their P-51 Mustangs.</p>
<p>“I did not recognize at the time the gravity of what we are facing. I
just felt as though it was a duty of mine at the time. I just stood up
to my duty,” Stewart said of World War II in a 2024 interview with CNN
about the war.</p>
<p>Having grown up in a multicultural neighborhood, the segregation and
prejudice of the Jim Crow-era South came as a shock to Stewart, but he
was determined to finish and earn his wings according to the book about
his life. After finishing training, the pilots were assigned to escort
U.S. bombers in Europe. The Tuskegee Airmen are credited with losing
significantly fewer escorted bombers than other fighter groups.</p>
<p>“I got to really enjoy the idea of the panorama, I would say, of the
scene I would see before me with the hundreds of bombers and the
hundreds of fighter planes up there and all of them pulling the
condensation trails, and it was just the ballet in the sky and a feeling
of belonging to something that was really big,” Stewart said in a 2020
interview with WAMC.</p>
<p>Stewart would sometimes say in a self-effacing way that he was too
busy enjoying flying to realize he was making history, according to his
book.</p>
<p>Stewart had hoped to become a commercial airline pilot after he left
the military, but was rejected because of his race. He went on to earn a
mechanical engineering degree at New York University. He relocated to
Detroit and retired as vice president of a natural gas pipeline
company.</p>
<p>Stewart told Michigan Public Radio in 2019 that he was moved to tears
on a recent commercial flight when he saw who was piloting the
aircraft.</p>
<p>“When I entered the plane, I looked into the cockpit there and there
were two African American pilots. One was the co-pilot, and one was the
pilot. But not only that, the thing that started bringing the tears to
my eyes is that they were both female,” Stewart said.</p>
<p>The Air Force last month briefly removed training courses with videos
of its storied Tuskegee Airmen and the Women Airforce Service Pilots, or
WASPs in an effort to comply with the Trump administration’s crackdown
on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. The materials were
quickly restored following a bipartisan backlash.</p>

<p>date: 2025-02-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump said he wants the U.S. to take ownership
of Gaza, moving beyond his earlier statements of forcing Gazans to
relocate to neighboring Jordan and Egypt. Trump made the stunning
announcement Tuesday evening, as he hosted Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House. White House Bureau Chief Patsy

<h2 id="trump-says-us-will-take-ownership-of-gaza">Trump says US will
take ownership of Gaza</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump said he wants the United
States to take ownership of Gaza, moving beyond his earlier statements
of forcing Palestinians in the war-torn enclave to relocate to
neighboring Jordan and Egypt.</p>
<p>“The U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip, and we will do a job with
it, too,” he said during a joint press conference with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House Tuesday evening.</p>
<p>In recent days hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in the southern
parts of Gaza have marched north toward their homes after Israel allowed
people to return as part of the ceasefire for a hostage release deal
with Hamas.</p>
<p>Trump said he wants to develop the area into what he calls “the
Riviera of the Middle East.”</p>
<p>“Everybody I’ve spoken to loves the idea of the United States owning
that piece of land, developing and creating thousands of jobs with
something that will be magnificent, in a really magnificent area,” he
said.</p>
<p>Netanyahu said one of his war goals is to ensure that Hamas never
poses a threat to Israel again. But Trump, Netanyahu said, is “taking it
to a much higher level.”</p>
<p>“I think it’s something that could change history, and it’s
worthwhile really pursuing this avenue,” he added.</p>
<p>Trump did not share details on how he plans to exert control over the
area ravaged by 15 months of war, but he did not rule out sending U.S.
troops.</p>
<p>“If it’s necessary, we’ll do that. We’re going to take over that
piece, and we’re going to develop it,” he said.</p>
<p>Trump’s comments mark a remarkable shift from his criticism of
America’s involvement in Middle East conflicts. He sees a “long-term
ownership position,” for the U.S. that would bring “great stability to
that part of the Middle East, and maybe the entire Middle East.”</p>
<p>“This was not a decision made lightly,” he said.</p>
<p>However, any discussion of relocation will certainly be met with
resistance from Palestinians. Hundreds of thousands were driven from
their homes in what is now called Israel: in the 1948 war surrounding
Israel’s creation and during Israel’s 1967 seizure of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>There are currently 2.1 million people in Gaza, according to the
United Nations.</p>
<p>The Palestinian Authority said Wednesday that Trump’s proposal would
be “a serious violation of international law.”</p>
<p>Egypt’s Foreign Ministry also expressed opposition, highlighting the
need to carry out post-war reconstruction “without moving the
Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip.”</p>
<p>China, Australia, Turkey and France all backed the need to pursue a
two-state solution for peace in the region.</p>
<p>It’s unclear how occupying Gaza would fit into Trump’s own stated
goal of expanding the Abraham Accords to include Riyadh. He brokered the
deal that normalized ties between Israel and Arab countries in 2020.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia quickly reacted to Trump’s Gaza comments by saying it
will not establish diplomatic relations with Israel without the creation
of a Palestinian state, and that its position is nonnegotiable.</p>
<p>“The kingdom of Saudi Arabia also stresses what it had previously
announced regarding its absolute rejection of infringement on the
legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, whether through Israeli
settlement policies, annexation of Palestinian lands or efforts to
displace the Palestinian people from their land,” the Saudi Foreign
Ministry said in a statement.</p>
<p>Trump’s statement on Gaza is his latest signaling of expansionist
ambitions, following his statements to acquire Greenland from Denmark,
taking over the Panama Canal, and absorbing Canada.</p>
<p>Ceasefire renegotiation</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters at the White House earlier Tuesday, U.S. Middle
East envoy Steve Witkoff said the administration has begun negotiations
toward Phase 2 of the three-phase ceasefire-for-hostage-release deal,
which includes the release of all remaining hostages held in Gaza, a
permanent halt in fighting and Israel’s withdrawal from the
territory.</p>
<p>Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group, has released 18 hostages so
far, while Israel has freed hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.</p>
<p>Witkoff suggested that the administration is considering
renegotiating parts of the agreement that took effect on Jan. 19, the
day before Trump was inaugurated.</p>
<p>“Part of the problem is that it wasn’t such a wonderful agreement
that was first signed. That was not dictated by the Trump
administration. We had nothing to do with it,” he said. “Now we’re
working within that rubric, and we’re figuring things out.”</p>
<p>He doubled down on Trump’s suggestion to remove Gazans, saying that
the five-year reconstruction plan for Gaza as outlined in phase three is
“physically impossible.”</p>
<p>Trump’s insistence on relocating Gazans could signal a desire to
renegotiate the ceasefire deal, particularly the second phase, said
Ahmed Fouad Alkhatib, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council.</p>
<p>“The goal might be to force Hamas into choosing between relinquishing
control of Gaza or leaving the Strip if it wants an Israeli withdrawal
or reconstruction, or risk the entirety of the population facing
forcible removal, though how that would be carried out is unknown,” he
told VOA.</p>
<p>Also Tuesday, Trump ended support for the UN agency that helps
Palestinian refugees and withdrew the U.S. from what he calls the
antisemitic UN Human Rights Council.</p>
<p>Iran nuclear</p>
<p>Shortly before his meeting with Netanyahu, Trump directed his aides
to restore his “maximum pressure” campaign on Iran to prevent it from
getting a nuclear weapon and to drive down its oil exports to zero.</p>
<p>“I’m unhappy to do it, but I really have not so much choice, because
we have to be strong and firm, and I hope that it’s not going to have to
be used in any great measure at all,” he said. “It’s very simple. Iran
cannot have a nuclear weapon.”</p>
<p>As of September 2024, U.S. intelligence concluded in a report that
Iran is not building a nuclear weapon. However, Iran has “undertaken
activities that better position it to produce one, if it so chooses,”
the report said.</p>
<p>In November, the Justice Department under the Biden administration
announced that an Iranian plot to kill Trump before the presidential
election had been thwarted. Trump said he has directed his aides to
“obliterate” Tehran if the Iranian regime moves to assassinate him.</p>
<p>“If they did that they would be obliterated,” Trump said. “I’ve left
instructions if they do it, they get obliterated, there won’t be
anything left.”</p>
<p>Pressure on Netanyahu</p>
<p>Trump’s meeting with Netanyahu comes as the Israeli leader faces
pressure from his right-wing coalition to end the ceasefire.</p>
<p>Both Trump and Netanyahu share the goal of ending Hamas’ rule in Gaza
and return the remaining Israeli hostages, said Jonathan Rynhold, head
of the Department of Political Studies at Bar Ilan University. However,
the two men place different priorities on different aspects of the
goal.</p>
<p>For Netanyahu, the priority is to ensure Hamas has no political
future, Rynhold told VOA, while for Trump it’s to maintain the ceasefire
“so that he can move to an Israeli-Saudi Arabian normalization
agreement.”</p>
<p>U.S. administrations under Presidents George W. Bush to Joe Biden
have stated their support for Palestinian statehood under the two-state
solution. In 2020 during his first term, Trump announced his Middle East
peace plan that would deny Palestinians having their own state.</p>
<p>Trump was non-committal when asked Tuesday whether he supports the
two-state solution. His plan on Gaza “doesn’t mean anything about a
two-state or one-state or any other state,” he said.</p>
<p>The war in Gaza began with the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack that killed
1,200 people in Israel and took about 250 people hostage. Israel’s
counteroffensive has killed more than 47,500 Palestinians, more than
half of them women and children. Israel’s military says the death toll
includes 17,000 Hamas militants.</p>

<h2 id="senate-confirms-pam-bondi-as-us-attorney-general">Senate
confirms Pam Bondi as US attorney general</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Senate confirmed Pam Bondi as U.S. attorney general
on Tuesday evening.</p>
<p>The vote fell almost entirely along party lines, with only Sen. John
Fetterman, a Pennsylvania Democrat, joining with all Republicans to pass
her confirmation 54-46.</p>
<p>Bondi, a former Florida attorney general and corporate lobbyist, is
expected to oversee a radical reshaping of the department that has been
the target of Trump’s ire over the criminal cases it brought against
him. She enters with the FBI, which she will oversee, in turmoil over
the scrutiny of agents involved in investigations related to the
president, who has made clear his desire to seek revenge on his
perceived adversaries.</p>
<p>Republicans have praised Bondi as a highly qualified leader they
contend will bring much-needed change to a department they believe
unfairly pursued Trump through investigations resulting in two
indictments.</p>
<p>“Pam Bondi has promised to get the department back to its core
mission: prosecuting crime and protecting Americans from threats to
their safety and their freedoms,” said Senate Majority Leader John
Thune, R-S.D.</p>
<p>But Bondi has faced intense scrutiny over her close relationship with
the president, who during his term fired an FBI director who refused to
pledge loyalty to him and forced out an attorney general who recused
himself from the Justice Department’s investigation into potential ties
between Russia and his 2016 presidential campaign.</p>
<p>While Bondi has sought to reassure Democrats that politics would play
no part in her decision-making, she also refused at her confirmation
hearing last month to rule out potential investigations into Trump’s
adversaries. And she has repeated Trump’s claims that the prosecutions
against him amounted to political persecution, saying the Justice
Department “had been weaponized for years and years and years, and it’s
got to stop.”</p>
<p>Bondi’s confirmation vote came just hours after FBI agents sued the
Justice Department over efforts to develop a list of employees involved
in the January 6 prosecutions, which agents fear could be a precursor to
mass firings.</p>
<p>Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove last week ordered the acting
FBI director to provide the names, titles and offices of all FBI
employees who worked on the January 6 cases — which Trump has described
as a “grave national injustice.” Bove, who defended Trump in his
criminal cases before joining the administration, said Justice
Department officials would carry out a “review process to determine
whether any additional personnel actions are necessary.”</p>
<p>Justice Department officials have also recently forced out senior FBI
executives, fired prosecutors on special counsel Jack Smith’s team who
investigated Trump and terminated a group of prosecutors in the District
of Columbia’s U.S. attorney’s office who were hired to help with the
massive Jan. 6 investigation.</p>
<p>Bondi repeatedly stressed at her confirmation hearing that she would
not pursue anyone for political reasons, and vowed that the public, not
the president, would be her client. But her answers at times echoed
Trump’s campaign rhetoric about a politicized justice system.</p>

<h2 id="high-threat-undocumented-migrants-sent-to-guantanamo">‘High
threat’ undocumented migrants sent to Guantanamo</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PENTAGON — A small number of migrants were transferred from Texas to
a detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, on Tuesday via U.S.
military aircraft, U.S. defense officials told VOA.</p>
<p>Fewer than 20 migrants, which the administration has deemed to be
“high threat,” are being transported on the first C-17 flight from Fort
Bliss, one defense official said, speaking to VOA on background, a
method often used by U.S. officials to remain anonymous, before the
flight landed in Cuba.</p>
<p>U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Tuesday posted photos
on X of some of the migrants as they prepared to board the military
cargo plane, calling them “the worst of the worst,” and warning the
effort to deport them is just getting started.</p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security later said all of the migrants on
the military flight from Texas to Guantanamo Bay were members of Tren de
Aragua, a Venezuelan street gang with transnational reach. Officials did
not say when or how they were first taken into custody.</p>
<p>The White House has announced plans to designate Tren de Aragua as a
Foreign Terrorist Organization.</p>
<p>Since President Donald Trump’s executive order last month, the
Pentagon has deployed 300 Marines to Guantanamo to expand the facilities
to support holding operations for undocumented immigrants. According to
media reports, they have set up tents to house the migrants inside a
fenced area at a separate part of the naval base. Those facilities are
not yet ready for migrants, according to Fox News.</p>
<p>“The number of service members will continue to fluctuate as
additional forces are tasked to deploy and will be scaled, based on the
requirements of the Department of Homeland Security, which is the lead
federal agency,” U.S. Southern Command, which overseas operations in
South America, Central America and the Caribbean, announced in a
statement on Monday.</p>
<p>The migrants who arrived Tuesday will be held at the U.S. detention
facility, according to a U.S. official who spoke on background. The
facility is known mostly for housing military prisoners and terror
suspects, including those involved in the September 11, 2001, attacks
and members of the Taliban.</p>
<p>“If you’re a violent gang banger, and you’ve been taken out of our
country, and we’re waiting to bring you to your country, we’re going to
put you in a cell box built for al-Qaida,” Secretary of Defense Pete
Hegseth told Fox News this week.</p>
<p>In his executive order last month, Trump instructed the departments
of Defense and Homeland Security to prepare the U.S. naval base to hold
up to 30,000 migrants.</p>
<p>“Some of them are so bad we don’t even trust the countries to hold
them because we don’t want them coming back. So, we’re going to send
them out to Guantanamo,” Trump said.</p>
<p>Closing Guantanamo</p>
<p>Democratic administrations under Barack Obama and Joe Biden had
sought to close the detention camp, which was built by the George W.
Bush administration in 2002 following the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan
that began shortly after the 9/11 attacks of 2001.</p>
<p>Sue Hendrickson, president and CEO of Human Rights First, said in a
statement that sending migrants to Guantanamo would create a human
rights catastrophe.</p>
<p>“The Trump administration may find the symbolism of sending migrants
to Guantanamo darkly appealing; its practical result would be more
injustice, waste and self-inflicted loss of credibility,” Hendrickson
said.</p>
<p>At its height during the Global War on Terror, the detention facility
held about 680 prisoners. As of January 6, there were just 15 detainees
at the facility, according to the Pentagon.</p>
<p>Before being used to detain terror suspects, the U.S. naval facility
was also used to house migrants from Cuba and Haiti in the early
1990s.</p>

American Iron Dome reduces nuclear coercion but drives arms race</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump’s order to build an American
version of the Iron Dome to shield the U.S. from aerial attacks will
deter China and Russia from coercing the U.S. using nuclear weapons but
could drive a three-way arms race, said analysts.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The U.S. government’s Missile Defense Agency on Friday asked the
defense industry to identify technologies and capabilities available to
construct the Iron Dome for America. The deadline is the end of
February.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It made the request in response to Trump’s executive order signed on
Jan. 27, setting forth a motion to build an American Iron Dome.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“The United States will provide for the common defense of its
citizens and the Nation by deploying and maintaining a next-generation
missile defense shield,” the executive order stated.</p>
<p>The American Iron Dome will defend the U.S. “against ballistic,
hypersonic, advanced cruise missiles, and other next-generation aerial
attacks from peer, near-peer, and rogue adversaries,” according to the
statement.</p>
<p>It will ensure the U.S. has “its second-strike capability,” meaning
it would be able to launch nuclear retaliation.</p>
<p>The Iron Dome would also include a review of missile defense posture
to identify ways for U.S. allies and partners to increase cooperation on
missile defense development and operations.</p>
<p>Trump ordered Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to draw up a plan in the
next three months to build the missile shield.</p>
<p>Strengthening deterrence</p>
<p>Robert Peters, research fellow for Nuclear Deterrence and Missile
Defense at the Heritage Foundation, said on Thursday via phone, the Iron
Dome for America “will take away the option for nuclear coercion that an
actor could try to hold over the U.S.” in addition to defending the U.S.
from an actual strike.</p>
<p>“It is feasible for us to build an Iron Dome,” he said, “and there is
no reason why we should not do so, particularly given that we are seeing
the autocrats in North Korea, China, and Russia engaging in nuclear
coercion.”</p>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has threatened to use nuclear
weapons multiple times during an ongoing war in Ukraine that began with
its invasion in 2022.</p>
<p>In November, Putin revised the Russian threshold for using nuclear
weapons in a doctrine issued after former U.S. President Joe Biden
allowed Ukraine to strike targets inside Russia with U.S.-made
longer-range missiles.</p>
<p>The doctrine announced that Russia has the right to use nuclear
weapons to respond to a conventional weapons attack. Previously, Russia
reserved the right to use nuclear weapons only when an attack threatened
its existence.</p>
<p>Patrycja Bazylczyk, a research associate for the Missile Defense
Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said, “If
implemented well, an ‘iron dome for America’ could bolster American
defense and affect the strategic calculus of our adversaries.”</p>
<p>She told VOA on Monday, “Improving homeland air and missile defenses
reduces the confidence of a potential attacker, thereby raising the
threshold for attack and contributing to deterrence.”</p>
<p>The Iron Dome plan resembles former President Ronald Reagon’s
proposed dual objective of Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) and
nuclear disarmament, said Hans Kristensen, the director of the Nuclear
Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists (FAS).</p>
<p>The SDI, also came to be called Star Wars, was announced in 1983 to
develop a space-based defense system to protect the U.S. from nuclear
missiles.</p>
<p>Risk of arms race</p>
<p>Trump’s “Iron Dome initiative, to some extent, echoes his concern
about nuclear weapons,” but “a stronger U.S. missile defense system
would almost certainly make it more difficult to reach a nuclear
agreement with Russia and China because of their concern that more
effective missile defenses would increase the threat to their nuclear
retaliatory capability,” continued Kristensen.  </p>
<p>Trump said in a video message to the World Economic Forum in Davos,
Switzerland, on Jan. 23 that he wants to discuss “denuclearization” with
Russia, and that China would need to come along.</p>
<p>Kristensen told VOA on Thursday that “FAS applauds Trump’s remarks
about the need for nuclear limits and eventually denuclearization and
urge the administration to pursue these goals.”</p>
<p>He added, “Nuclear deterrence can be maintained with far fewer
nuclear weapons” and having nuclear reduction talks is “urgent because
the New START treaty expires in about one year.”</p>
<p>The New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START), a nuclear arms
reduction treaty between the U.S. and Russia, is set to expire in
February 2026.</p>
<p>Daryl Kimball, executive director of Arms Control Association, told
VOA on Friday Trump envisions “more ambitious system to thwart strategic
missile attacks by Russia or China” than his efforts in 2019.</p>
<p>“It is not realistic to believe that an effective system would be
feasible anytime soon, if ever, mainly because adversaries will respond
by seeking to overwhelm missile defense systems in order to maintain
their own capacity to deter U.S. conventional or nuclear attack,” he
said.</p>
<p>Kimball added, however, “We welcome Trump’s interest in negotiating
agreements with Russia and China to reduce the ‘tremendous’ costs of
nuclear weapons by reducing or ‘denuclearizing’ with Russia and China.
Without such a deal, we could see a costly three-way offensive nuclear
arms races that no one can win.”</p>
<p>The U.S. has about 5,044 nuclear warheads while Russia has over,
5,500 and China has approximately 500 nuclear warheads, according to the
FAS.  </p>
<p>The Pentagon in its annual report released in December on China’s
military estimates that China will have more than 1,000 operational
nuclear warheads by 2030.</p>
<p>North Korea, through its state-run KCNA, on Monday expressed
opposition to the U.S. plan to build the Iron Dome, describing it as a
“hegemonic attempt to maintain its military supremacy.”</p>
<p>The Chinese Embassy in Washington told VOA on Monday that it does not
have any comments on the issue at this time.</p>
<p>A top Russia diplomat quoted by the state news agency Tass on
Thursday said America’s Iron Dome “puts an end to the prospects of
strategic offensive arms reduction on nuclear and missile arsenals in
favor of their quantitative and qualitative increase.”</p>
<p>Richard Weitz, director for the Center for Political-Military
Analysis at Hudson Institute, said, “The Russians and Chinese have
always said that if the U.S. builds better defenses, they’re going to
build better offenses so they can overcome these defenses.”</p>
<p>He told VOA on Thursday, the Iron Dome effort, along with Trump’s
interest in having nuclear reduction talks with China and Russia, aims
to reduce overall threats to the U.S., but it would be difficult to get
China on board denuclearization talks.</p>

judge blocks Trump from sending transgender women to men’s prisons</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — A U.S. judge on Tuesday blocked President Donald Trump’s
administration from moving transgender women to men’s prisons and ending
their gender-affirming care.</p>
<p>In a broad ruling temporarily halting an executive order that Trump,
a Republican, signed on his first day back in office on Jan. 20, U.S.
District Judge Royce Lamberth in Washington found that three transgender
inmates who sued would likely succeed in arguing the policy was
unconstitutional.</p>
<p>The decision marked the second time that a federal judge had sided
with LGBTQ+ legal rights groups who sued to prevent the U.S. Bureau of
Prisons from implementing the order.</p>
<p>Lamberth’s order applies to all 16 transgender women currently housed
in federal women’s prisons. It goes further than a Jan. 26 decision by a
federal judge in Boston blocking prison officials from transferring an
individual transgender woman to a men’s facility.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Justice Department, which defended the Trump
administration in court, declined to comment. The Bureau of Prisons did
not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>The three transgender women who brought the Washington case argued
transgender women would face violence and sexual assault in men’s
prisons, which would violate their right to not be subjected to cruel
and unusual punishment as guaranteed by the Eighth Amendment to the U.S.
Constitution.</p>
<p>U.S. Justice Department attorney John Robinson had argued that the
Bureau of Prisons has broad authority to make inmate placement
decisions. He urged Lamberth, an appointee of Republican President
Ronald Reagan, to wait for the agency to revise its policies before
issuing any order compelling the continuation of medical treatment.</p>
<p>In his decision, Lamberth wrote that the government did not dispute
the plaintiffs’ assertion that transgender persons were at a higher risk
of physical and sexual violence than other inmates when housed in a
facility corresponding to their biological sex.</p>
<p>Trump’s executive order directed the federal government to only
recognize two, biologically distinct sexes, male and female; house
transgender women in men’s prisons; and cease funding for any
gender-affirming medical care for inmates.</p>
<p>Prior to Trump’s order, the Bureau of Prisons had been operating
under guidelines adopted in 2022 during Democratic former President Joe
Biden’s tenure requiring prisons to consider inmates’ “current gender
expression” when deciding where to house them.</p>
<p>Biden’s policy was a reversal from earlier guidance during Trump’s
first term.</p>
<p>The lawsuit filed on Jan. 30 also argued that Trump’s executive order
discriminates against transgender people on the basis of sex in
violation of the U.S. Constitution’s Fifth Amendment.</p>
<p>About 2,230 transgender inmates are housed in federal custodial
facilities and halfway houses, according to the U.S. Department of
Justice. About two thirds of them, 1,506, are transgender women, most of
whom are housed in men’s prisons.</p>

id="trump-takes-aim-at-new-south-african-land-expropriation-law">Trump
takes aim at new South African land expropriation law</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WHITE HOUSE — President Donald Trump has taken aim at a new South
African law meant to address the nation’s apartheid legacy of racially
unequal land distribution, threatening to withdraw funding, including to
the world’s largest HIV treatment program.</p>
<p>Africa observers told VOA on Tuesday that some members of the U.S.
Congress have jumped on this grievance to “upend the status quo in
U.S.-South Africa relations as a response.”</p>
<p>Trump fired the first volley Sunday night, in a post on his social
media site.</p>
<p>“South Africa is confiscating land, and treating certain classes of
people VERY BADLY,” Trump wrote. He continued to describe the situation
as “a massive Human Rights VIOLATION, at a minimum.”</p>
<p>South African politicians — both the supporters and the opponents of
the newly inked Expropriation Act that Trump was referring to — quickly
fired back at his description of the new law, which repeals
apartheid-era legislation to align land distribution with the nation’s
progressive constitution.</p>
<p>Under the apartheid system, laws such as the 1913 Natives Land Act
severely restricted Black land ownership. Other now-defunct laws
determined where members of the nation’s Black majority could travel or
live, what public facilities they could use, and whom they could
marry.</p>
<p>Apartheid also denied full citizenship rights to Black people until
its fall in the early 1990s. Black people first gained the right to vote
in the 1994 elections that ushered in democratic rule.</p>
<p>“South Africa, like the United States of America and other countries,
has always had expropriation laws that balance the need for public usage
of land and the protection of rights of property owners,” South African
President Cyril Ramaphosa said in a statement this week. “We look
forward to engaging with the Trump administration over our land reform
policy and issues of bilateral interest. We are certain that out of
those engagements, we will share a better and common understanding over
these matters.”</p>
<p>The new law allows for limited cases of land expropriation without
compensation, and that clause alone provoked years of public
consultations and debate in South African parliament and civil society
before it was adopted recently by the nation’s newly sworn-in coalition
government.</p>
<p>In her article on the website The Conversation, law professor Zsa-Zsa
Temmers Boggenpoel of Stellenbosch University explained the move as “a
potential tool to reduce land inequality.”</p>
<p>“This has become a matter of increasing urgency,” she wrote. “South
Africans have expressed impatience with the slow pace of land
reform.”</p>
<p>A government land audit in 2017 found that 72% of the country’s farms
and agricultural holdings were white-owned.</p>
<p>“I am not convinced that the act, in its current form, is the silver
bullet to effect large-scale land reform — at least not the type of
radical land reform that South Africa urgently needs,” Boggenpoel wrote.
“Understandably, the act will have a severe impact on property rights.
But it still substantially protects landowners affected by
expropriation. Only in very limited cases would they not be
compensated.”</p>
<p>South Africa’s opposition parties stood against the new law.</p>
<p>After the bill was signed last month, opposition party ActionSA ,
which vowed to pursue legal action, said in a statement, “While other
parties assert that this bill does not compromise the ‘willing buyer,
willing seller doctrine,’ it ultimately allows the government to
unilaterally set the price if an agreement cannot be reached.”</p>
<p>The center-right Democratic Alliance party not only strenuously
opposed the new law — along with ActionSA and the pro-Afrikaner Freedom
Front Plus party — it also objected to Trump’s characterization, calling
it “unfortunate.”</p>
<p>“It would be a tragedy if this funding were terminated because of a
misunderstanding of the facts,” the party said in a statement. It
continued: “It is not true that the Act allows land to be seized by the
state arbitrarily, and it does require fair compensation for legitimate
expropriations in terms of Section 25 of the Constitution.”</p>
<p>But these nuances may not be seized upon by the U.S. Congress, which
has bristled at some of Pretoria’s moves — not least, the nation’s
decision to pursue a genocide case against Israel at the U.N.’s highest
court, said Michael Walsh, an Africa analyst at the Foreign Policy
Research Institute,</p>
<p>The U.S. strenuously opposed South Africa’s petition to the court in
late 2023, with the White House telling VOA the case was “without
merit.”</p>
<p>“My key takeaway was [Trump’s] reference to massive human rights
violations,” Walsh told VOA. “That terminology will play into the hands
of those interest groups who have been pushing for Magnitsky sanctions
to be imposed on ANC and EFF officials prior to the G20 Johannesburg
Summit,” he added, referring to the African National Congress,
Ramaphosa’s party, and the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters.</p>
<p>The 2012 Magnitsky Act allows the U.S. to impose sanctions on human
rights violators.</p>
<p>“Many South African experts have assumed that any Magnitsky sanctions
would be based on acts of corruption,” Walsh said. “However, members of
Congress are considering Magnitsky sanctions on the grounds of human
rights violations as well.”</p>
<p>This all sets up the scene, he said, for a diplomatic showdown when
world leaders converge in Johannesburg in November for the summit of G20
nations.</p>
<p>Host nation South Africa has set the agenda for that meeting of the
world’s top 20 economies to include two issues that don’t jibe with
Trump’s isolationist, pro-energy exploration, America-first approach:
mobilizing climate financing and increasing debt relief for developing
countries.</p>

Treasury says Musk team has ‘read-only access’ to payment data</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Treasury said on Tuesday that Elon Musk’s
government-efficiency team has been granted “read-only access” to its
payment system codes and denied that this cut off any government
payments including for Social Security or Medicare.  </p>
<p>The confirmation of a Musk associate’s access to the system codes
came in a letter from a Treasury official to Democratic Senator Ron
Wyden. The letters said the review was being undertaken to “maximize
payment integrity for agencies and the public.” </p>
<p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has not commented on reports in
recent days that Musk’s informal Department of Government Efficiency had
gained access to the system responsible for disbursing more than $6
trillion of annual government spending.  </p>
<p>Several thousand people gathered outside the Treasury on Tuesday to
protest DOGE’s Treasury access amid his sweeping incursion into
government operations, which this week led to the shutdown of the U.S.
Agency for International Development, merging its aid mission into the
State Department. </p>
<p>The payment system review “is not resulting in the suspension or
rejection of any payment instructions submitted to Treasury by other
federal agencies across the government,” Jonathan Blum, principal deputy
assistant secretary in the Office of Legislative Affairs wrote to
Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon.  </p>
<p>The DOGE team at Treasury conducting the review is led by technology
firm chief executive Tom Krause, whom the letter described as a
“Treasury employee.” Krause is CEO of Cloud Software Group, which owns
former independent software firms Citrix and Tibco. </p>
<p>Wyden raised alarms over the weekend when reports first surfaced that
a team under the direction of Musk, appointed by President Donald Trump
to conduct a broad review of government operations, was at the Treasury.
 </p>
<p>“I’m sure the Treasury Secretary and the president want to save face
and downplay the risks as Elon Musk seizes power, but nothing they’re
saying is believable or trustworthy,” Wyden said in response to Blum’s
letter. </p>
<p>Outside the Treasury, protesters waved placards with slogans
including: “Nobody Elected Musk” and “Bessent, you have 1 job!! Protect
our money. You already failed.” </p>
<p>About three dozen Democratic members of the Senate and House of
Representatives tried to enter the Treasury to confront Bessent on the
issue but they said they were denied access. </p>
<p>Rebecca Weiss, who lives in suburban Maryland, told Reuters that she
attended the protest because she is worried about what Musk will do with
the payments data. </p>
<p>“He’s obviously a data guy, and now he has access, potentially, to
everybody’s personal identifiable information, which he might take
advantage of for his business purposes,” she said. “The bottom line is,
we didn’t elect him.”</p>

id="trump-reimposes-maximum-pressure-on-iran-aims-to-drive-oil-exports-to-zero">Trump
reimposes ‘maximum pressure’ on Iran, aims to drive oil exports to
zero</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday restored his
“maximum pressure” campaign on Iran that includes efforts to drive its
oil exports down to zero in order to stop Tehran from obtaining a
nuclear weapon.</p>
<p>Ahead of his meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
Trump signed the presidential memorandum reimposing Washington’s tough
policy on Iran that was practiced throughout his first term.</p>
<p>As he signed the memo, Trump described it as very tough and said he
was torn on whether to make the move. He said he was open to a deal with
Iran and expressed a willingness to talk to the Iranian leader.</p>
<p>“With me, it’s very simple: Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon,” Trump
said. Asked how close Tehran is to a weapon, Trump said: “They’re too
close.”</p>
<p>Iran’s mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately
respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Iran is accelerating enrichment of uranium to up to 60% purity, close
to the roughly 90% weapons-grade level, the U.N. nuclear watchdog chief
told Reuters in December. Iran has denied wanting to develop a nuclear
weapon.</p>
<p>Trump’s memo, among other things, orders the U.S. Treasury secretary
to impose “maximum economic pressure” on Iran, including sanctions and
enforcement mechanisms on those violating existing sanctions.</p>
<p>It also directs the Treasury and State Department to implement a
campaign aimed at “driving Iran’s oil exports to zero.” U.S. oil prices
pared losses on Tuesday on the news that Trump planned to sign the
memo.</p>
<p>Tehran’s oil exports brought in $53 billion in 2023 and $54 billion a
year earlier, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration
estimates. Output during 2024 was running at its highest level since
2018, based on OPEC data.</p>
<p>Trump had driven Iran’s oil exports to near-zero during part of his
first term after re-imposing sanctions. They rose under Biden’s tenure
as Iran succeeded in evading sanctions.</p>
<p>The Paris-based International Energy Agency believes Saudi Arabia,
the United Arab Emirates and other OPEC members have spare capacity to
make up for any lost exports from Iran, also an OPEC member.</p>
<p>China does not recognize U.S. sanctions and Chinese firms buy the
most Iranian oil. China and Iran have also built a trading system that
uses mostly Chinese yuan and a network of middlemen, avoiding the dollar
and exposure to U.S. regulators.</p>
<p>Kevin Book, an analyst at ClearView Energy, said the Trump
administration could enforce the 2024 Stop Harboring Iranian Petroleum
(SHIP) law to curtail some Iranian barrels.</p>
<p>SHIP, which the Biden administration did not enforce strictly, allows
measures on foreign ports and refineries that process petroleum exported
from Iran in violation of sanctions. Book said a move last month by the
Shandong Port Group to ban U.S.-sanctioned tankers from calling into its
ports in the eastern Chinese province signals the impact SHIP could
have.</p>
<p>Trump also directed his U.N. ambassador to work with allies to
“complete the snapback of international sanctions and restrictions on
Iran,” under a 2015 deal between Iran and key world powers that lifted
sanctions on Tehran in return for restrictions on its nuclear
program.</p>
<p>Britain, France and Germany told the United Nations Security Council
in December that they are ready — if necessary — to trigger a snapback
of all international sanctions on Iran to prevent the country from
acquiring a nuclear weapon.</p>
<p>They will lose the ability to take such action on October 18 when a
2015 U.N. resolution expires. The resolution enshrines Iran’s deal with
Britain, Germany, France, the United States, Russia and China that
lifted sanctions on Tehran in exchange for restrictions on its nuclear
program.</p>
<p>Iran’s U.N. ambassador, Amir Saeid Iravani, has said that invoking
the “snap-back” of sanctions on Tehran would be “unlawful and
counterproductive.”</p>
<p>European and Iranian diplomats met in November and January to discuss
if they could work to defuse regional tensions, including over Tehran’s
nuclear program, before Trump returned.</p>

id="former-google-engineer-faces-new-us-charges-he-stole-ai-secrets-for-chinese-companies">Former
Google engineer faces new US charges he stole AI secrets for Chinese
companies</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. prosecutors on Tuesday unveiled an expanded 14-count indictment
accusing former Google software engineer Linwei Ding of stealing
artificial intelligence trade secrets to benefit two Chinese companies
he was secretly working for. </p>
<p>Ding, 38, a Chinese national, was charged by a federal grand jury in
San Francisco with seven counts each of economic espionage and theft of
trade secrets. </p>
<p>Each economic espionage charge carries a maximum 15-year prison term
and $5 million fine, while each trade secrets charge carries a maximum
10-year term and $250,000 fine. </p>
<p>The defendant, also known as Leon Ding, was indicted last March on
four counts of theft of trade secrets. He is free on bond. His lawyers
did not immediately respond to requests for comment. </p>
<p>Ding’s case was coordinated through an interagency Disruptive
Technology Strike Force created in 2023 by the Biden
administration. </p>
<p>The initiative was designed to help stop advanced technology from
being acquired by countries such as China and Russia or potentially
threatening national security. </p>
<p>Prosecutors said Ding stole information about the hardware
infrastructure and software platform that lets Google’s supercomputing
data centers train large AI models. </p>
<p>Some of the allegedly stolen chip blueprints were meant to give
Google an edge over cloud computing rivals Amazon and Microsoft, which
design their own, and reduce Google’s reliance on chips from
Nvidia. </p>
<p>Prosecutors said Ding joined Google in May 2019 and began his thefts
three years later when he was being courted to join an early-stage
Chinese technology company. </p>
<p>Ding allegedly uploaded more than 1,000 confidential files by May
2023 and later circulated a PowerPoint presentation to employees of a
China startup he founded, saying that country’s policies encouraged
development of a domestic AI industry. </p>
<p>Google was not charged and has said it cooperated with law
enforcement. </p>
<p>According to court records describing a December 18 hearing,
prosecutors and defense lawyers discussed a “potential resolution” to
Ding’s case, “but anticipate the matter proceeding to trial.” </p>
<p>The case is U.S. v. Ding, U.S. District Court, Northern District of
California, No. 24-cr-00141.</p>

<h2 id="trump-orders-target-several-un-bodies">Trump orders target
several UN bodies</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday stopped U.S.
engagement with the U.N. Human Rights Council, extended a halt to
funding for the Palestinian relief agency UNRWA and ordered a review of
the U.N. cultural agency UNESCO.</p>
<p>“It’s got great potential and based on the potential we’ll continue
to go along with it, but they got to get their act together,” Trump told
reporters. “It’s not being well run, to be honest and they’re not doing
the job.</p>
<p>“A lot of these conflicts that we’re working on should be settled, or
at least we should have some help in settling them. We never seem to get
help. That should be the primary purpose of the United Nations,” the
U.S. president said.</p>
<p>U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said, “From day one, U.S. support
for the United Nations has saved countless lives and advanced global
security.”</p>
<p>“The secretary-general looks forward to continuing his productive
relationship with President Trump and the U.S. government to strengthen
that relationship in today’s turbulent world.”</p>
<p>Trump said that he was not looking to take away money from the
193-member world body, though he complained that Washington had to pay a
disproportionate amount.</p>
<p>Washington is the U.N.’s largest contributor - followed by China -
accounting for 22% of the core U.N. budget and 27% of the peacekeeping
budget. The U.N. has said the U.S. currently owes a total of $2.8
billion, of which $1.5 billion is for the regular budget. These payments
are not voluntary.</p>
<p>UNRWA</p>
<p>Trump’s order on Tuesday was largely symbolic and mirrored moves he
made during his first term in office, from 2017-2021.</p>
<p>Since taking office for a second term on Jan. 20, Trump has ordered
the U.S. to withdraw from the World Health Organization and from the
Paris climate agreement - also steps he took during his first term in
office.</p>
<p>The U.S. was UNRWA’s biggest donor - providing $300 million-$400
million a year - but former President Joe Biden paused funding in
January 2024 after Israel accused about a dozen UNRWA staff of taking
part in the deadly Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Palestinian militants Hamas
that triggered the war in Gaza.</p>
<p>The U.S. Congress then formally suspended contributions to UNRWA
until at least March 2025. UNRWA provides aid, health and education
services to millions of Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank, including
East Jerusalem, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan.</p>
<p>The United Nations has said that nine UNRWA staff may have been
involved in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack and were fired. A Hamas commander
in Lebanon - killed in September by Israel - was also found to have had
a UNRWA job. The U.N. has vowed to investigate all accusations made and
repeatedly asked Israel for evidence, which it says has not been
provided.</p>
<p>Human Rights Council</p>
<p>The first Trump administration also quit the 47-member Human Rights
Council halfway through a three-year term over what it called chronic
bias against Israel and a lack of reform. The U.S. is not currently a
member of the Geneva-based body. Under Biden, the U.S. was re-elected
and served a 2022-2024 term.</p>
<p>A council working group is due to review the U.S. human rights record
later this year, a process all countries undergo every few years. While
the council has no legally binding power, its debates carry political
weight and criticism can raise global pressure on governments to change
course.</p>
<p>Trump’s executive order on Tuesday also asks Secretary of State Marco
Rubio to review and report back to him on international organizations,
conventions, or treaties that “promote radical or anti-American
sentiment.”</p>
<p>He specified that the U.N. Education, Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO) should be reviewed first because Washington had
previously accused it of anti-Israel bias.</p>

<h2 id="the-migrant-workforce-under-trump">The migrant workforce under
Trump</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-05, from: Market Place, Make me Smart</p>
<p>
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
</p>
<p>
It’s hard to overstate the role immigrant workers play in the U.S.
economy. Key industries rely on them —
<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/01/23/trump-deportation-plans-food-system-00200013">nearly
half</a> of meat-processing jobs, for instance, are held by immigrants.
And many work in low-wage jobs that are vulnerable to exploitation.
</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
</p>
<p>
Ted Genoways, a reporter with the Food and Environment Reporting
Network, said Trump’s promises of mass deportations is creating fear and
uncertainty for immigrant workers, both authorized and unauthorized, as
well as for the massive food companies that employ them.
</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
</p>
<p>
“If history is any guide, this will probably mean increased food prices,
if only for companies trying to hedge against the possibility of
something disastrous happening,” said Genoways.
</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
</p>
<p>
On today’s show, Genoways gives us a snapshot of the low-wage immigrant
workforce’s role in our economy and unpacks how Trump’s deportation
plans could disrupt America’s food supply. Plus, why aren’t food
companies held accountable for exploiting their employees?

id="congressional-democrats-to-trump-changes-cant-be-done-in-secrecy">Congressional
Democrats to Trump: Changes can’t be done in secrecy</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Congressional Democratic leadership warned President Donald Trump on
Tuesday that they would use upcoming government funding talks as
leverage to fight the administration’s changes in U.S. government
agencies.</p>
<p>Democrats’ warnings come as the Department of Government Efficiency
(DOGE), led by Elon Musk, moved the U.S. Agency for International
Development (USAID) under the control of the U.S. State Department
earlier this week. The administration has said they are reviewing
USAID’s foreign assistance activities to “ensure it is in alignment with
an America First agenda.”</p>
<p>“Whatever DOGE is doing, it’s not democracy,” Senate Minority Leader
Chuck Schumer told reporters Tuesday. “We know what democracy looks
like. It’s out in the open. It’s not secret.”</p>
<p>Democrats could push back on some of the most recent changes in the
U.S. government by withholding votes on a new spending bill. A
short-term continuing resolution keeping the government running is set
to expire on March 14.</p>
<p>On Monday, congressional Democrats protested outside closed USAID
offices, saying the Trump administration had overreached its
authority.</p>
<p>“If you want to change an agency, introduce a bill and pass a law,”
Democratic Senator Brian Schatz said. “You cannot wave away an agency
that you don’t like or that you disagree with by executive order, or by
literally storming into the building and taking over the servers. That
is not how the American system of government works.”</p>
<p>USAID manages tens of billions of dollars in U.S. foreign assistance
programs.</p>
<p>“The Constitution requires that the funding be spent by the president
and the administration,” House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said
Tuesday. “The Constitution requires the president has a responsibility
to take care that the laws are faithfully executed. Spending agreements
passed through the appropriations process are law, and when those laws
are violated, the Constitution is being violated, which is why there has
been a flurry of righteous litigation that has been unleashed.”</p>
<p>Congressional Republicans have expressed support for attempts to weed
out fraud and abuse in the U.S. aid system.</p>
<p>“I don’t think they’re closing an agency, but I do think they have
the right to review funding and how those decisions are made and what
priorities are being funded,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune told
reporters Tuesday. “I think that’s probably true of any administration.
When they come in, there are lots of programs authorized and funded
through that agency, some which I think are operating the way in which
they were intended, some which aren’t.”</p>
<p>The White House criticized USAID-funded projects supporting
diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives and other efforts it
argues are a waste of taxpayer funds.</p>
<p>“If there’s massive fraud, if the funds aren’t being directed to
where the Congress has appropriated and the president has signed, then
we need to know about that,” Roger Wicker, the Senate Armed Services
chairman, told American news networks CNN and CBS Monday.</p>
<p>“I have felt for a long time that USAID is our way to combat the Belt
and Road Initiative, which is China’s effort to really gain influence
around the world, including Africa and South America and the Western
Hemisphere,” Wicker continued. “So we need an aid program to match the
Chinese effort, but it needs to be done in a way that the policymakers
of the United States have decided ought to be done.”</p>
<p>Schumer said Tuesday he’s supportive of efforts to eliminate fraud
and abuse but criticized the speed and secrecy of the process.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump’s executive order to
establish a nationwide “Iron Dome” missile defense system has sparked

id="rubio-pledges-us-support-for-costa-ricas-fight-against-cyberattacks-drug-trafficking">Rubio
pledges US support for Costa Rica’s fight against cyberattacks, drug
trafficking</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>STATE DEPARTMENT — Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Tuesday pledged
U.S. support to bolster Costa Rica’s cybersecurity defenses, 5G
telecommunications infrastructure, and its battle against narcotics.</p>
<p>Rubio made the statement at a joint press conference with Costa Rican
President Rodrigo Chaves, whose Central American nation faces more than
100 million cyberattacks annually.</p>
<p>“It’s very serious — 110 million cyberattacks a year for a country of
this size — it’s extraordinary, and they have faced it very bravely,”
Rubio told reporters in San Jose, Costa Rica’s capital.</p>
<p>In late 2024, local media reported that Costa Rican officials, in
collaboration with the U.S. Embassy, identified cyber intrusions by
criminal groups in China targeting the country’s telecommunications and
technology system, an allegation the Chinese Embassy in Costa Rica
denied.</p>
<p>In August 2023, Chaves issued a decree regulating 5G mobile network
development, limiting involvement to companies based in signatory-states
to the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime — an international treaty
addressing cybercrime.</p>
<p>San Jose should be lauded for being “very firm,” Rubio said, against
companies “backed by governments like the government of China that likes
to threaten, that likes to sabotage, that likes to use economic coercion
to punish you.”</p>
<p>VOA has reached out to the Chinese Embassy in Washington for comment
but has not yet received a response.</p>
<p>US aid waiver</p>
<p>Rubio also vowed that Washington wouldn’t “eliminate foreign aid” but
prioritize assistance for trusted partners and allies. He pledged
continued cooperation with Costa Rica, offering FBI and Drug Enforcement
Administration support to investigate drug trafficking to the U.S.</p>
<p>“We issued a waiver today because Costa Rica” has used U.S. aid
effectively to fix problems that also benefit the United States, Rubio
said. “They’re stopping drugs, they’re stopping criminals, they’re
identifying terrorists.”</p>
<p>The State Department’s Office of Foreign Assistance has not responded
to VOA’s inquiry for further details on the waiver.</p>
<p>Rubio’s five-nation tour across Central America and the Caribbean
marks his first major diplomatic mission as secretary of state, with key
priorities including curbing illegal immigration into the U.S. and
combating drug trafficking.</p>
<p>On Tuesday afternoon, the secretary arrived in Guatemala following
discussions with leaders from Panama, El Salvador and Costa Rica. He is
scheduled to travel to the Dominican Republic on Wednesday.</p>

id="senate-committee-advances-robert-f.-kennedy-jr.-nomination-to-be-health-secretary">Senate
committee advances Robert F. Kennedy Jr. nomination to be health
secretary</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the controversial environmental
lawyer turned public health critic, cleared his first hurdle on Tuesday
to become the nation’s top health official when the senate finance
committee voted to advance his nomination for a floor vote. </p>
<p>Republicans voted together to advance his nomination, while Democrats
all opposed. </p>
<p>His nomination now will face a full senate vote, despite concerns
about the work he’s done to sow doubts around vaccine safety and his
potential to profit off lawsuits over drugmakers. </p>
<p>To gain control of the $1.7 trillion Health and Human Services
agency, Kennedy will need support from all but three Republicans if
Democrats uniformly oppose him. </p>
<p>Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, who is also a physician
and sits on the finance committee, voted to advance Kennedy’s
confirmation. Last week, during Kennedy’s hearings, Cassidy repeatedly
implored Kennedy to reject a disproven theory that vaccines cause
autism, to no avail. He ended the hearing by saying he was “struggling”
with the vote. </p>
<p>“Your past, undermining confidence in vaccines with unfounded or
misleading arguments, concerns me,” Cassidy told Kennedy. </p>
<p>Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and
Mitch McConnell of Kentucky are all seen as potential no votes, too,
because they voted against President Donald Trump’s defense secretary
nominee and have expressed concerns about Kennedy’s anti-vaccine
work. </p>
<p>In a CBS “60 Minutes” interview that aired Sunday, McConnell declined
to say how he would vote on Kennedy’s nomination but reiterated
“vaccines are critically important.” </p>
<p>Democrats, meanwhile, continue to raise alarms about Kennedy’s
potential to financially benefit from changing vaccine guidelines or
weakening federal lawsuit protections against vaccine makers if
confirmed as health secretary. </p>
<p>“It seems possible that many different types of vaccine-related
decisions and communications — which you would be empowered to make and
influence as Secretary — could result in significant financial
compensation for your family,” Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren of
Massachusetts and Ron Wyden of Oregon wrote in a letter sent over the
weekend to Kennedy. </p>
<p>Kennedy said he’ll give his son all of the referral fees in legal
cases against vaccine makers, including the fees he gets from referring
clients in a case against Merck. Kennedy told the committee he’s
referred hundreds of clients to a law firm that’s suing Merck’s
Gardasil, the human papillomavirus vaccine that prevents cervical
cancer. He’s earned $2.5 million from the deal over the past three
years. </p>
<p>As secretary, Kennedy will oversee vaccine recommendations and public
health campaigns for the $1.7 trillion agency, which is also responsible
for food and hospital inspections, providing health insurance for
millions of Americans and researching deadly diseases. </p>
<p>Kennedy, a longtime Democrat, ran for president but withdrew last
year to throw his support to Trump in exchange for an influential job in
his Republican administration. Together, they have forged a new and
unusual coalition made up of conservatives who oppose vaccines and
liberals who want to see the government promote healthier foods. Trump
and Kennedy have branded the movement as “Make America Healthy
Again.”</p>

outlines pathways to decarbonizing the buildings sector, which produces
about one-third of global emissions. The analysis, from the Energy
Transitions Commission, proposes three main priorities that need to be
tackled:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Electrifying heating and cooking </strong>by swapping out fossil
fuel-based appliances. Doing this comprehensively by 2050 could “bring
annual emissions from building use close to zero” if we manage to
decarbonize the grid.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Boosting energy efficiency of appliances.</strong> Demand for
heat pumps and air conditioners will rise as the planet heats up, so we
need to find ways of squeezing more from these technologies while using
less energy. That includes making our buildings more energy efficient in
general.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Decarbonizing construction </strong>by finding low-carbon ways
to make building materials like steel and concrete, and using fewer
building materials overall. We should also be better utilizing the
buildings we already have.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
“This will require collaboration right across sector, between
governments, industry bodies, and private companies,” said Stephen Hill,
a sustainability and building performance expert at building design firm
Arup. “We need to be ambitious, but if we get it right we can cut
carbon, generate value for our economy, and improve people’s quality of
life through action like improving living conditions and reducing fuel
poverty.”

threaten to use US arms to thwart attempts to retake them</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD  — The Taliban have warned that the military weapons left
behind by the United States in Afghanistan now belong to them as “spoils
of war” and will be utilized to defend against any attempts to reclaim
them. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The statement marks the first official response from the
internationally unrecognized government in Kabul to President Donald
Trump’s pledge on the eve of his Jan. 20 inauguration to retrieve U.S.
arms from the de facto Islamist Afghan leaders.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“The weapons that America abandoned in Afghanistan, as well as those
provided to the former Afghan regime, are now in the possession of the
Mujahideen [or Taliban forces] as spoils of war,” claimed Zabihullah
Mujahid, the chief Taliban spokesperson, while participating in an X
space session late on Monday.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“The Afghan people now own these weapons and are utilizing them to
defend their independence, sovereignty, and Islamic system. No external
force can compel us to surrender these weapons, nor will we accept any
demands for their surrender,” Mujahid stated. “We will use these weapons
to repel invaders who dare to seize them.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>U.S.-led Western troops were stationed in Afghanistan for nearly two
decades to counter terrorist groups and protect the internationally
backed government in Kabul at the time. They hastily and chaotically
withdrew in August 2021, just days after the then-insurgent Taliban
stormed back to power. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>A U.S. Department of Defense report in 2022 found that about $7
billion worth of military hardware was left behind in Afghanistan after
the military withdrawal was completed. The equipment, including
aircraft, air-to-ground munitions, military vehicles, weapons,
communications equipment, and other materials, was subsequently seized
by the Taliban. </p>
<p>Trump stated in his pre-inauguration remarks at a rally in Washington
last month that his predecessor, Joe Biden, “gave our military
equipment, a big chunk of it, to the enemy.” He went on to warn that
future financial assistance to Taliban-ruled Afghanistan would be
contingent upon the return of U.S. military arms.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“If we’re going to pay billions of dollars a year, tell them we’re
not going to give them the money unless they give back our military
equipment,” Trump said then, without elaborating.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mujahid, while speaking on Monday, rejected Trump’s assertions,
saying the Taliban have not received “a single penny” from the U.S. in
financial aid since regaining control of the country. He stated that
Kabul has neither anticipated nor sought any assistance from Washington.
 </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Taliban have displayed U.S. military gear in their so-called
victory day celebrations since returning to power in Afghanistan. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The U.S. troop exit from Afghanistan stemmed from the February 2020
Doha Agreement that the first Trump administration negotiated with the
then-insurgent Taliban. Biden completed and defended the military
withdrawal, saying the choice he had was either to follow through on
that agreement or be prepared to go back to fighting the Taliban.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/remarks/2025/01/remarks-by-president-trump-at-the-world-economic-forum/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Appearing</u></a>
by video connection to the global plutocrats assembled recently at
Davos, Donald Trump interrupted a rambling answer to a question about
liquefied natural gas to proclaim that he had come up with a solution to
the energy demand of artificial intelligence (“I think it was largely my
idea, because nobody thought this was possible”), which is to build
power plants near data centers to power them. And a key part of the
equation should be coal. “Nothing can destroy coal — not the weather,
not a bomb — nothing,” he said. “But coal is very strong as a backup.
It’s a great backup to have that facility, and it wouldn’t cost much
more — more money. And we have more coal than anybody.”
</p>
<p>
There is some truth there — the United States
<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/coal-proved-reserves" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>does
in fact</u></a> have the largest coal reserves in the world — and AI may
be offering something of a lifeline to the declining industry. But with
Trump now talking about coal as a “backup,” it’s a reminder that he
brings up the subject much less often than he used to. Even if coal will
not be phased out as an electricity source quite as quickly as many had
hoped or anticipated, Trump’s first-term promise to coal country will
remain a broken one.
</p>
<p>
Yet in an unusual turn of events, the anticipated explosion of demand
for electricity on its way over the next few years has led some
utilities to
<a href="https://www.spglobal.com/commodity-insights/en/news-research/latest-news/electric-power/110524-us-power-generators-pump-the-brakes-on-coal-plant-retirements#:~:text=Duke%20Energy%20Indiana%2C%20in%20an,and%20natural%20gas%20through%202038." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>scale
back</u></a> their existing plans to shutter coal-fired power plants,
foreseeing that they’ll need every electron they can generate.
Ironically,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/georgia-power-coal" target="_self"><u>especially
in Georgia</u></a>, that need is driven by a boom in green
manufacturing.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, coal’s decline is still remarkable. At the start of the
21st century, coal was the primary source of electricity generation in
32 states; now
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/02/climate/electricity-generation-us-states.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>that
number</u></a> is down to 10 and dropping. As recently as 2007, coal
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/electricity/electricity-in-the-us.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>accounted</u></a>
for half the country’s electricity; the figure is now 16%. Worldwide
coal demand keeps
<a href="https://www.mining.com/web/coal-demand-to-keep-hitting-records-through-2027-iea-says/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>increasing</u></a>,
mostly because of China and India. But here in the United States, the
trajectory is only going in one direction.
</p>
<p>
Confronted with those facts, a politician could take one of two basic
paths. The first is to make impossible promises to voters in coal
country, telling them that the jobs that have disappeared will be
brought back, their communities will be revitalized, and the dignity
they feel they have lost will be returned.
</p>
<p>
That was the path Donald Trump took. He talked a lot about coal in 2016,
making grand promises about the coal revival he would bring if elected.
At a rally in West Virginia, he donned a hardhat, pretended to shovel
some coal,
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/trump-receives-warm-welcome-in-coal-country/2016/05/06/9259c5ea-1327-11e6-a9b5-bf703a5a7191_video.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>and
said</u></a>, “For those miners, get ready, because you’re going to be
working your asses off.” And in Trumpian style, if he couldn’t keep the
promise, he’d just say he did. “The coal industry is back,”
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/05/us/politics/trump-coal-industry.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>he
said</u></a> in 2018, a year which saw the
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=40212#:~:text=In%202018%2C%20plant%20owners%20retired,15%20GW%2C%20occurred%20in%202015." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>second-most
coal capacity retired</u></a> in the country’s history to that point.
“We’re putting our great coal miners back to work,”
<a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/oct/14/donald-trump/fact-checking-trumps-claim-pa-hes-putting-our-grea/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>he
said</u></a> on the campaign trail in 2020, when the number of
coal-producing mines in the U.S.
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=48936" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>declined
by 18%</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
When Trump took office in January 2017, there were just over 50,000 coal
jobs left in the country after
<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CES1021210001" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>decades
of decline</u></a>. When he left office in 2021, the number was down to
38,000. The number is slightly higher today at around 43,000, but it’s
still infinitesimal as a portion of the economy.
</p>
<p>
Trump’s failure to bring back coal jobs wasn’t because his affection for
the fuel source was insincere. He certainly had as coal-friendly an
administration as one could imagine; his second pick to run the
Environmental Protection Agency was a
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/world/trump-nominates-acting-epa-head-an-ex-coal-lobbyist-to-run-agency-idUSKCN1P326H/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>coal
lobbyist</u></a>. But the triumvirate of forces that drove those job
reductions — automation, emissions-limiting regulations, and competition
from fracked natural gas — were irresistible.
</p>
<p>
The second path for a politician confronting the structural decline of
coal is to take concrete steps to create new opportunities in coal
country that offer people a better economic future. That was what the
Biden administration tried to do. As part of its clean energy push,
Biden put a particular focus on siting new projects in underserved
communities, including in areas where coal still defines the culture
even though the jobs are long gone. The administration also
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241107062156/https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-425-million-decarbonize-and-manufacture-clean-energy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>directed</u></a>
hundreds of millions of dollars in funding “to ensure former coal
communities can take full advantage of the clean energy transition and
continue their leading role in powering our nation,” in the words of
then-Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm. Or as the Treasury Department
<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/featured-stories/anchoring-clean-energy-manufacturing-investments-in-coal-country-and-beyond" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>put
it</u></a>, the administration was working “to strengthen the economies
of coal communities and other areas that have experienced
underinvestment in past decades.” These were real commitments, backed up
by real dollars.
</p>
<p>
Today, the new Trump administration is committed to freezing, reversing,
and clawing back as much of Biden’s clean energy agenda as it can.
Whether that includes these investments in coal country remains to be
seen.
</p>
<p>
There’s good reason to believe it will, however, both because of the
antipathy Trump and his team hold for anything that has Biden’s
fingerprints on it, and because Trump understands the fundamental truth
of his political relationship to coal country: Its support for him is
unshakeable, no matter the policy outcome.
</p>
<p>
Take just one example: Harlan County, Kentucky, site of the
extraordinary 1976 documentary
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_County,_USA" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>Harlan
County, USA</em></em></u></a>, which chronicled a strike by miners
demanding fair wages and working conditions. Coal is still being mined
in Harlan County, but
<a href="https://eec.ky.gov/Energy/News-Publications/Quarterly%20Coal%20Reports/2023-Q2.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>as
of 2023</u></a>, only 577 people there were employed in the industry, or
about one in every 19 working-age people in the county. It
<a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/harlancountykentucky/PST045224" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>remains</u></a>
overwhelmingly white and overwhelmingly poor — and the voters there love
Trump. He got 84.9% of the vote in 2016, 85.4% in 2020, and 87.7% in
2024.
</p>
<p>
It might be fair to ask what people in Harlan County and across coal
country have to show for their support for the president. The absolute
best he can offer them is that while coal will continue to decline under
his presidency, it might decline a bit slower than it otherwise would
have. Even if escalating electricity demand offers an opportunity for
the coal industry, there’s little reason to believe it will
<em><em>reverse</em></em> coal’s decline in America. At most it could
flatten the curve, allowing some coal plants to remain in operation a
few years longer than planned.
</p>
<p>
A future where coal is at most a miniscule part of America’s energy mix
with a tiny labor force producing it seems inevitable. Most people in
coal country understand that, as much as they might like it to be
otherwise. If only their favorite politician would admit it to them —
and commit to offering them more than fables — they could start building
something better.

hosting Netanyahu for White House talks amid Gaza ceasefire</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump is set to host Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu for talks Tuesday at the White House with Israel’s
ceasefire with Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip at the top of the
agenda.</p>
<p>The talks come at a key phase in the ceasefire. Israel and Hamas have
less than four weeks to agree on the terms of the second phase, which
would include the release of all remaining hostages held in Gaza, a
permanent halt in fighting and Israel’s withdrawal from the
territory.</p>
<p>“I have no guarantees that the peace is going to hold,” Trump told
reporters Monday.</p>
<p>Ahead of the White House visit, Netanyahu met Monday with U.S. Middle
East envoy Steve Witkoff, who was part of the push to secure the
ceasefire deal.</p>
<p>Netanyahu’s office said in a statement that the meeting was “positive
and friendly,” and that he would meet with his Security Cabinet upon
returning from the U.S. in order to “discus Israel’s overall positions
regarding the second stage of the deal.”</p>
<p>Witkoff is expected to hold talks with Qatari and Egyptian officials
as the three countries continue in their role of mediating the halt in
fighting.</p>
<p>In addition to the ceasefire, Netanyahu said he and Trump would
discuss countering Iranian aggression and expanding diplomatic relations
with Arab countries.</p>
<p>Trump brokered normalization agreements between Israel and four Arab
countries in his first term. He now is seeking a wider agreement in
which Israel would forge ties with Saudi Arabia.  </p>
<p>But Saudi Arabia has said it would only agree to such a deal if the
war in Gaza ends and there is a credible pathway to a Palestinian state
in Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories Israel captured
in the 1967 Middle East war.  </p>
<p>The U.S. supports Palestinian statehood, but Netanyahu’s government
is opposed.</p>
<p>Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group, has released 18 hostages so
far, while Israel has freed hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.</p>
<p>The war in Gaza began with the Oct. 7, 2023, attack in which Hamas
militants killed 1,200 people and took about 250 people hostage.</p>
<p>Israel’s counteroffensive during 15 months of warfare has killed more
than 47,500 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children.
Israel’s military says the death toll includes 17,000 militants it has
killed.   </p>

<h2 id="us-tariffs-on-chinese-goods-go-into-effect">US tariffs on
Chinese goods go into effect</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods went into effect Tuesday, with
China quickly announcing tariffs on U.S. imports in response.</p>
<p>China said it would impose 15% tariffs on U.S. coal and liquified
natural gas, as well as 10% tariffs on crude oil, agricultural machinery
and some automobiles.</p>
<p>The U.S. measures involve a 10% tariff on all Chinese goods, which
Trump announced in an effort to pressure China to take action to prevent
fentanyl smuggling into the United States.   </p>
<p>The U.S. government has identified China as a major source of the
precursor chemicals used by Mexican drug cartels to manufacture
fentanyl.</p>
<p>China has said it has taken steps to crack down on the industry and
illicit drug trade.</p>
<p>“China hopefully is going to stop sending us fentanyl, and if they’re
not, the tariffs are going to go substantially higher,” Trump said.</p>
<p>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday that Trump
would speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping in the coming days.</p>
<p>Trump on Monday announced a one-month pause for the 25% tariffs on
Mexican and Canadian goods after he spoke with Mexican President Claudia
Sheinbaum and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.</p>
<p>Sheinbaum said she would dispatch 10,000 National Guard troops to try
to curb the flow of fentanyl into the United States.</p>
<p>“Mexico will reinforce the northern border … to stop drug trafficking
from Mexico to the United States, in particular fentanyl,” Sheinbaum
posted on X after talking with Trump. “The United States commits to work
to stop the trafficking of high-powered weapons to Mexico.”</p>
<p>The Mexican leader added that the two countries would continue talks
on security and trade and that “the tariffs are put on pause for a month
from now.”</p>
<p>Trudeau said Canada would deploy new technology and personnel along
its border with the United States to stop the flow of fentanyl.</p>
<p>“I just had a good call with President Trump,” Trudeau said on X.
“Proposed tariffs will be paused for at least 30 days while we work
together.”</p>
<p>Both Sheinbaum and Trudeau, representing two of the three biggest
U.S. trading partners along with China, protested Trump’s tariff plans
and vowed to retaliate.</p>
<p>Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council,
said Monday that it was misleading to characterize the showdown over
tariffs as a trade war, despite the planned retaliations from Mexico,
Canada and China and the risk of escalation.</p>
<p>“Read the executive order where President Trump was absolutely, 100%
clear that this is not a trade war,” Hassett said. “This is a drug
war.”</p>
<p>Trump acknowledged Sunday that the new tariffs on the three biggest
U.S. trading partners could hit inflation-weary Americans with higher
prices for groceries, gasoline, cars and other consumer goods, but said
the higher tariffs would be “worth the price” to bolster U.S.
interests.</p>
<p>U.S. consumers could face higher prices because companies that pay
the tariffs to the federal government to import goods from other
countries then often pass on at least part, if not all, of their higher
costs to consumers, rather than absorb their extra expenses
themselves.</p>
<p>Tensions ramped up Monday with the leader of Canada’s most populous
province of Ontario announcing that he is ending a contract with Elon
Musk’s Starlink internet services in response to Trump’s new tariff on
Canada. Musk, possibly the world’s richest man, is a key Trump adviser
seeking to sharply cut U.S. government spending and trim the ranks of
2.3 million federal civilian workforce through buyouts.</p>
<p>Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who said he is also banning American
companies from provincial contracts, signed a $68 million deal with
Musk’s company in November to deliver high-speed internet to remote
residents in rural and northern Ontario.</p>
<p>“We’ll be ripping up the province’s contract with Starlink. Ontario
won’t do business with people hellbent on destroying our economy,” Ford
said in a post on X.</p>

visiting Costa Rica, Guatemala on trip focused on migration and security
ties</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>STATE DEPARTMENT — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is set to hold
meetings Tuesday with officials in Costa Rica and later in Guatemala as
part of a tour of Latin America focused on migration, security
cooperation and countering Chinese influence in the region.</p>
<p>Rubio was in El Salvador for talks Monday with President Nayib
Bukele, and he announced that Bukele had offered to accept any deportees
from the United States, regardless of their nationality.</p>
<p>“He’s also offered to do the same for dangerous criminals currently
in custody and serving their sentences in the United States even though
they’re U.S. citizens or legal residents,” Rubio said.</p>
<p>The U.S. government cannot legally deport U.S. citizens.</p>
<p>Rubio said El Salvador would fully cooperate on the repatriation of
Salvadorans who are in the United States illegally, calling the deal
“the most unprecedented, extraordinary, extraordinary migratory
agreement anywhere in the world.”</p>
<p>Bukele said on X that his government offered the U.S. “the
opportunity to outsource part of its prison system,” with El Salvador
accepting a fee to hold convicted criminals in its Terrorism Confinement
Center mega prison.</p>
<p>“The fee would be relatively low for the U.S. but significant for us,
making our entire prison system sustainable,” Bukele said.</p>
<p>The State Department said Rubio also raised strategies to counter the
influence of the Chinese Communist Party in the Western Hemisphere to
safeguard the sovereignty and interests of both nations and the
region.</p>
<p>His visit comes amid the restructuring of a U.S. agency overseeing
foreign aid, which has sparked a showdown between congressional
Democrats and President Donald Trump’s administration.</p>
<p>Rubio announced that he is now the acting administrator of the U.S.
Agency for International Development but has delegated his authority to
another official. He stressed that the agency must align U.S. foreign
aid with national interests and comply with State Department policy
directives.</p>
<p>Late Monday, the United States and El Salvador also signed a
memorandum of understanding, or MOU, on civil nuclear cooperation,
expanding strategic relations between the two nations.</p>
<p>The State Department said the MOU marks an initial step toward
building a robust civil nuclear partnership, aiming to enhance energy
security and foster economic cooperation.</p>
<p>Curtailing illegal immigration</p>
<p>Bukele is regarded as a key ally of the United States in its regional
efforts to address the migration crisis.</p>
<p>On Oct. 7, 2024, the United States and El Salvador signed a Customs
Mutual Assistance Agreement, further strengthening border security and
facilitating trade between the two countries.</p>
<p>El Salvador was once the third-largest source of nationals captured
at the U.S. southwest border. Today, it no longer ranks among the top
10.</p>
<p>Chinese influence</p>
<p>U.S. President Trump has maintained warm relations with Salvadoran
President Bukele, who also strengthened ties with Chinese President Xi
Jinping following his state visit to Beijing in December 2019.</p>
<p>During Bukele’s visit, China promised millions in development
projects for the Central American country through a series of
agreements. Among them were a soccer stadium, a national library, a
tourist pier, and funding for water treatment improvements.</p>
<p>In April 2024, China and El Salvador began negotiations on a free
trade agreement, though the United States remains El Salvador’s primary
trading partner.</p>
<p>El Salvador formally recognized the People’s Republic of China on
Aug. 21, 2018, severing diplomatic ties with Taiwan.</p>
<p>Panama</p>
<p>Earlier Monday, Rubio observed a U.S.-funded deportation flight
departing from Albrook International Airport in Panama, returning dozens
of undocumented Colombians to their home country. A total of 32 men and
11 women were repatriated, including seven individuals with criminal
records.</p>
<p>The top U.S. diplomat said it sent “a clear message” that people who
sought to enter the U.S. border irregularly would be stopped and sent
back to their countries of origin.</p>
<p>On July 1, 2024, the first day of Panamanian President José Raúl
Mulino’s term, the U.S. and Panama signed a memorandum of understanding
aimed at jointly reducing the number of migrants illegally crossing
through Panama’s Darién region en route to the United States.</p>
<p>The program is funded by the U.S. State Department and implemented by
the Department of Homeland Security. Monday’s deportation was carried
out under the MOU and following a State Department waiver that lifted a
previous pause on U.S. foreign aid.</p>
<p>“This is an effective way to stem the flow of illegal migration, of
mass migration, which is destructive and destabilizing,” Rubio told
reporters at the Albrook International Airport.</p>
<p>“This flight today was possible due to a waiver that we’ve issued,”
he added. “We’re going to issue a broader one to continue this
cooperation.”</p>
<p>Under the 2024 MOU, the United States has provided nearly $2.7
million to fund flights and tickets to repatriate migrants to their
countries of origin.</p>
<p>Since the first repatriation flight on August 20, 2024, over 40
charter flights have been conducted from Panama to more than 14
countries, returning more than 1,700 undocumented migrants. Destinations
have included Colombia, Ecuador, India, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>Panama recently reported a 90% decrease in migrants crossing the
Darién region compared to the same period last year.</p>
<p>Canal controversy</p>
<p>On Sunday, Rubio warned Panama that Washington will “take necessary
measures” if Panama does not take immediate steps to end what U.S.
President Donald Trump described as China’s “influence and control” over
the Panama Canal.</p>
<p>“Secretary Rubio made clear that this status quo is unacceptable,”
State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement after
Rubio’s talks with Mulino.</p>
<p>Mulino also announced that Panama has decided not to renew a 2017
memorandum with China on Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative and will
seek to void agreements with the Chinese government before their
official expiration dates.</p>
<p>“We’ll study the possibility of terminating it early,” Mulino added
on Sunday.</p>
<p>The Belt and Road Initiative, or BRI, is a massive infrastructure
project launched by China in 2013 under President Xi Jinping, aiming to
connect multiple continents through land and maritime routes. The United
States has cautioned that the BRI “is fueled by China’s mission to
manipulate and undermine the global rules-based trading system for its
own benefit.”</p>
<p>At the United Nations, Chinese Ambassador Fu Cong dismissed the
accusations against China as “totally false” and “pointless.” He said
that China has never participated in the management or operation of the
Panama Canal nor interfered in its affairs. He also reaffirmed respect
for Panama’s sovereignty and the canal’s status as a neutral
international gateway.</p>
<p>The Chinese ambassador further called Panama’s decision not to renew
the BRI agreement “regrettable.”</p>
<p>After visiting Panama, El Salvador, Costa Rica and Guatemala, Rubio’s
trip closes with a stop in the Dominican Republic.</p>

suggests Ukraine’s rare minerals as condition for continued support</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump said he would possibly be interested in
continuing U.S. aid to Ukraine in exchange for access to Ukraine’s rare
earth minerals.</p>
<p>“We’re looking to do a deal with Ukraine where they’re going to
secure what we’re giving them with their rare earth and other things,”
Trump said Monday in the Oval Office.</p>
<p>Trump has indicated Ukraine is open to the possibility of an
agreement of delivering rare earth minerals to the U.S. in exchange for
the continuation of U.S. aid to Ukraine for its war against Russia,
according to an Associated Press report.</p>
<p>“We’re putting in hundreds of billions of dollars. They have great
rare earth. And I want security of the rare earth, and they’re willing
to do it,” the U.S. president said.</p>
<p>Rare earth minerals like those in Ukraine, include lithium and
titanium. They are essential for an array of modern high-tech
products.</p>
<p>In his daily address Monday, before Trump’s announcement, Ukraine’s
president reiterated the country’s need to defend itself against
Russia’s ongoing attacks.  He said Russia is “focusing primarily” on
Ukraine’s energy sector.</p>
<p>“They continue their attacks, constantly adjusting their strikes to
the capabilities of our defense, making them more difficult to repel,”
Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.</p>
<p>“There is a constant rapid evolution of electronic warfare,” the
president said and urged Ukraine to “be much faster” in adjusting to the
continuous changes. </p>
<p>The supply of air defense systems for Ukraine is another issue for
the Eastern European country. Zelenskyy said that the supplies are
“critical and must not stop.”   </p>
<p>“We must constantly search worldwide for ways to strengthen defense,
increase production of necessary equipment in Ukraine, expand
localization of production and obtain licenses from our partners,” the
president said. “This is a huge undertaking, and much of Ukraine’s
future depends on it.”</p>
<p>Zelenskyy also said in his daily address that he talked Monday with
Ukraine’s military Commander in Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi about
modernizing the country’s armed forces. </p>
<p>As part of that discussion, the two men also talked about appointing
corps commanders who “must be the most prepared, most promising
officers, with combat experience and [a] modern mindset.” </p>
<p>While the president said, “The army must be modern,” he also said,
“most importantly, it must value its people.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Earlier Monday, Russian officials said that Ukrainian drone attacks
targeted energy facilities in two regions in southwestern Russia.</p>
<p>Volgograd Governor Andrei Bocharov said falling debris from drones
destroyed by Russian air defenses sparked fires at an oil refinery.</p>
<p>Astrakhan Governor Igor Babushkin said the Ukrainian attacks focused
on fuel and energy facilities, starting a fire in his region but causing
no casualties.</p>
<p>The officials did not give details about the sites involved in the
attacks.</p>
<p>Russia’s Defense Ministry said Monday it shot down 70 Ukrainian
drones overnight, including over the Rostov, Volgograd, Astrakhan,
Voronezh, Belgorod and Kursk regions.</p>
<p>Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Telegram the attacks
damaged three houses and an agricultural business.</p>
<p>Ukraine’s military said Monday it destroyed 38 of the 71 drones that
Russian forces launched in overnight attacks.</p>
<p>The intercepts took place over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv,
Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Khmelnytskyi, Kyiv, Poltava, Sumy, Vinnytsia
and Zaporizhzhia regions.</p>
<p>Cherkasy Governor Ihor Taburets said on Telegram that falling drone
debris damaged four residential buildings.</p>
<p>Kharkiv Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported the Russian attack damaged
a school.</p>

in El Salvador to push US migration crackdown, counter China’s growing
influence</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>STATE DEPARTMENT — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited El
Salvador on Monday to press the country to stem the flow of illegal
migration and address other strategic issues. </p>
<p>His visit comes amid the restructuring of a U.S. agency overseeing
foreign aid, which has sparked a showdown between congressional
Democrats and President Donald Trump’s administration.</p>
<p>Rubio announced that he is now the acting administrator of the U.S.
Agency for International Development but has delegated his authority to
another official. He stressed that the agency must align U.S. foreign
aid with national interests and comply with State Department policy
directives. </p>
<p>The same day, Rubio also held one-on-one talks with Salvadoran
President Nayib Bukele at Lake Coatepeque, San Salvador, as part of his
five-nation Central American tour focused on curbing illegal
immigration, countering China’s influence in the Western Hemisphere, and
strengthening security ties.</p>
<p>Late Monday, the United States and El Salvador signed a memorandum of
understanding, or MOU, on civil nuclear cooperation, expanding strategic
relations between the two nations. </p>
<p>The State Department said the MOU marks an initial step toward
building a robust civil nuclear partnership, aiming to enhance energy
security and foster economic cooperation.</p>
<p>Curtailing illegal immigration</p>
<p>Bukele is regarded as a key ally of the United States in its regional
efforts to address the migration crisis.</p>
<p>On Oct. 7, 2024, the United States and El Salvador signed a Customs
Mutual Assistance Agreement, further strengthening border security and
facilitating trade between the two countries.</p>
<p>El Salvador was once the third-largest source of nationals captured
at the U.S. southwest border. Today, it no longer ranks among the top
10.</p>

id="american-bald-eagles-are-having-a-moment-ecologically-culturally">American
bald eagles are having a moment, ecologically, culturally</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WEST ORANGE, New Jersey — Along the long road from American icon to
endangered species and back again, the bald eagle — the national bird of
the United States, often seen against a clear blue sky — is having a
moment.</p>
<p>The eagles find themselves in an environmental updraft of sorts since
the early 2000s, when the federal government took the thriving birds off
its endangered species list with more states following suit. Culturally,
too, the animals are soaring.</p>
<p>In December, Joe Biden signed legislation making the raptor the
country’s national bird (thought that was already the case? More in a
bit). New Jersey became the latest state to delist the bald eagle as
endangered in January, citing a remarkable comeback for the creatures
associated with strength and independence — and that occupied just a
single nest in the state decades ago. And to the chagrin or elation of
football fans, the Philadelphia Eagles will be vying for a championship
in the Super Bowl this weekend.</p>
<p>How did the storied birds find their way back? As with so many tales,
it’s complex.</p>
<p>Their well-being was intertwined with an insecticide</p>
<p>The story — there was a single nesting pair in New Jersey in the
1980s and roughly 300 now, for instance — centers on the banning of DDT,
a chemical insecticide with environmental side effects that included
thin-shelled eagle eggs. That touched off a cratering in the number of
eagles across the country, and officials prohibited the pesticide in
1972.</p>
<p>To rebuild the birds’ numbers in their historic range across the
country, conservationists imported birds from places where their
populations were stable, including from Canada. Early on, they also
removed eggs from nesting birds’ nests, replacing them with artificial
ones for the eagles to “incubate” while the real eggs were safely
hatched outside the nest before being returned, as eaglets for their
parents to raise according to Kathy Clark, the head of New Jersey’s
Endangered and Nongame Species Program.</p>
<p>“They’re one of the few conservation success stories of animals that
almost went extinct on our continent. And so, I think now it’s really
important to make sure people know that story and learn from it,” said
Maia Edwards, the science director at the American Bald Eagle Foundation
in Alaska.</p>
<p>Clark, whose work with the birds spans decades and includes the
period when their numbers were so small they lived only in a remote part
of the state, said the eagles have taught officials a number of lessons.
One is that they’re “fairly adaptable” and now live across densely
populated (with people) New Jersey — from suburban Bergen County near
New York to the wetlands along the shore in the south.</p>
<p>She recalled the story of one fledgling eagle in a suburban town —
New York Giants territory, as it were, sorry, Eagles fans — that found
itself on a backyard woodpile and walking around the street. Volunteer
observers worried over the bird’s well-being, given the realities of
suburban living. But a year later, observers spotted the eagle,
identified by a band. It had apparently made it.</p>
<p>“Those birds that, you know, have that tolerance to live like in such
a densely human structured environment is something I have a hard time
understanding,” she said. “They’re Jersey birds. You got to have
attitude, right?”</p>
<p>The birds do face dangers as they expand into suburbia, though.
Jilian Fazio, director of the Essex County Turtle Back Zoo in suburban
northern New Jersey, said the zoo rescues a number of birds hit by
cars. </p>
<p>There are threats, as well. Habitat preservation and clean, open
water, since the eagles feed heavily on fish, is a worry, but there’s
also the current outbreak of avian influenza or bird flu. Clark says
officials are going to maintain surveillance amid the outbreak.</p>
<p>A resurgence in popularity, too</p>
<p>Beyond the birds coming off endangered lists, they made headlines
recently for finally getting their due as the county’s national bird, an
oversight left undone in law because the bald eagle was already on the
national seal and many thought it already had that status, said Sen. Amy
Klobuchar of Minnesota, who sponsored legislation that Biden signed last
month.</p>
<p>She and colleagues worked with Native American and veterans’ groups
to get buy-in for the legislation, she said, and it passed the typically
divisive House and Senate last year with no dissent. The birds are
revered in several Native American cultures as symbols of strength,
particularly in the Pacific Northwest, according to Paul Apodaca, a
retired academic who specializes in folklore and mythology.</p>
<p>The eagles’ perch as symbols of the country contributes to their
conservation, with experts considering them an “umbrella species,” whose
need for large open spaces and waterways helps preserve lesser-known
wildlife.</p>
<p>“Americans are always going to have that sort of personal
relationship with bald eagles,” Clark said.</p>
<p>New Jersey Sen. Andy Kim, a native of Philadelphia Eagles territory,
took his two young sons to the NFC championship game last week, a memory
he said they won’t forget. “Let’s never forget that Bald Eagle was
officially named America’s national bird at the same time the Eagles are
headed back to the Super Bowl,” he said in a text message.</p>
<p>Experiencing seeing a bird in the wild or even as you’re driving
along a business-lined highway can leave an impression. Dan Day, a
birder who’s spotted bald eagles some 50 times in recent years both on
nature walks and just driving around suburban New Jersey, remembered
never having seen the birds as a kid growing up in Cleveland. Now a New
Jersey resident and Philadelphia Eagles fan, he regularly goes out in
his green “Birds” cap and binoculars.</p>
<p>“Just the mere thrill of seeing one — a lot of people just have
never, ever looked at one,” he said. “It really elevates your day to see
a bald eagle.”</p>
<p>Enjoy watching them, experts say, but give them space, too. Because
rescuing animals threatened with extinction is expensive, uncertain
work. Said Clark, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection
official: “I don’t think I ever will lose that perspective of, of being
on the brink there, not knowing if… if you’re going to be able to save
the species.”</p>

Stradivarius violin could become most expensive instrument ever
auctioned</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — A violin made by the famed Antonio Stradivari in 1714 has
the potential to become the most expensive musical instrument ever sold
when it goes up for auction Friday at Sotheby’s in New York.</p>
<p>The auction house is estimating the value of the “Joachim-Ma
Stradivarius” at $12 million to $18 million. If it sells at the top end
of that range, it could best the $15.9 million paid in 2011 for another
Stradivarius, the “Lady Blunt,” made in 1721 and named by Guinness World
Records as the most expensive instrument ever sold at auction.</p>
<p>Mari-Claudia Jimenez, Sotheby’s Americas president and head of global
business, said Stradivari made the violin during his “Golden Period,”
which began around 1700 and was marked by an improvement in his
craftmanship.</p>
<p>“So, this is the peak of his output,” Jimenez said. “This is the best
violin of this era.”</p>
<p>Sotheby’s says the violin’s preservation is remarkable, and its
ownership history extraordinary.</p>
<p>It’s named for two of its famed owners — violin virtuosos Joseph
Joachim of Hungary, who lived from 1831 to 1907, and Si-Hon Ma, who was
born in China in 1926, moved to the U.S. in 1948 and died 2009.</p>
<p>It is believed that legendary composer Johannes Brahms was influenced
by the Joachim-Ma when he wrote his “Violin Concerto in D Major” because
of its rich, resonant tone, and that Joachim played that violin during
the concerto’s 1879 premiere, according to Sotheby’s.</p>
<p>Ma acquired the violin in 1969, and his estate gifted it to the New
England Conservatory in Boston after his death. Ma attended the
conservatory, where he earned a master’s degree in 1950. The
conservatory is now putting the violin up for auction, with all the
proceeds going to student scholarships.</p>

id="trump-administration-opens-antisemitism-inquiries-at-5-colleges-including-columbia-and-berkeley">Trump
administration opens antisemitism inquiries at 5 colleges, including
Columbia and Berkeley</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The Trump administration is opening new investigations into
allegations of antisemitism at five U.S. universities including Columbia
and the University of California, Berkeley, the Education Department
announced Monday.</p>
<p>It’s part of President Donald Trump’s promise to take a tougher
stance against campus antisemitism and deal out harsher penalties than
the Biden administration, which settled a flurry of cases with
universities in its final weeks. It comes the same day the Justice
Department announced a new task force to root out antisemitism on
college campuses.</p>
<p>In an order signed last week, Trump called for aggressive action to
fight anti-Jewish bias on campuses, including the deportation of foreign
students who have participated in pro-Palestinian protests.</p>
<p>Along with Columbia and Berkeley, the department is now investigating
the University of Minnesota, Northwestern University and Portland State
University. The cases were opened using the department’s power to launch
its own civil rights reviews, unlike the majority of investigations,
which stem from complaints.</p>
<p>Messages seeking comment were left with all five universities.</p>
<p>A statement from the Education Department criticized colleges for
tolerating antisemitism after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel and
a wave of pro-Palestinian protests that followed. It also criticized the
Biden administration for negotiating “toothless” resolutions that failed
to hold schools accountable.</p>
<p>“Today, the Department is putting universities, colleges, and K-12
schools on notice: this administration will not tolerate continued
institutional indifference to the wellbeing of Jewish students on
American campuses,” said Craig Trainor, the agency’s acting assistant
secretary for civil rights.</p>
<p>The department didn’t provide details about the inquiries or how it
decided which schools are being targeted. Presidents of Columbia and
Northwestern were among those called to testify on Capitol Hill last
year as Republicans sought accountability for allegations of
antisemitism. The hearings contributed to the resignation of multiple
university presidents, including Columbia’s Minouche Shafik.</p>
<p>An October report from House Republicans accused Columbia of failing
to punish pro-Palestinian students who took over a campus building, and
it called Northwestern’s negotiations with student protesters a
“stunning capitulation.”</p>
<p>House Republicans applauded the new investigations. Representative
Tim Walberg, chair of the Education and Workforce Committee, said he was
“glad that we finally have an administration who is taking action to
protect Jewish students.”</p>
<p>Trump’s order also calls for a full review of antisemitism complaints
filed with the Education Department since Oct. 7, 2023, including
pending and resolved cases from the Biden administration. It encourages
the Justice Department to take action to enforce civil rights laws.</p>
<p>Last week’s order drew backlash from civil rights groups who said it
violated First Amendment rights that protect political speech.</p>
<p>The new task force announced Monday includes the Justice and
Education departments along with Health and Human Services.</p>
<p>“The Department takes seriously our responsibility to eradicate this
hatred wherever it is found,” said Leo Terrell, assistant attorney
general for civil rights. “The Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism is the
first step in giving life to President Trump’s renewed commitment to
ending anti-Semitism in our schools.”</p>

Department workers put on leave over DEI order</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Dozens of employees at the U.S. Education Department
were put on paid administrative leave in response to President Donald
Trump’s order banning diversity, equity and inclusion programs in the
federal government, according to a labor union that represents hundreds
of workers in the agency.</p>
<p>It’s unclear how many workers were put on leave or for what reasons,
said Sheria Smith, president of American Federation of Government
Employees Local 252. The majority of employees placed on leave do not
work in DEI initiatives and span all branches of the agency, she said,
from an office that sends billions of dollars to K-12 schools to an
office that enforces civil rights laws.</p>
<p>The shakeup comes as Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency,
or DOGE, pushes to cut programs and federal workers at departments
across the government, including the U.S. Agency for International
Development.</p>
<p>A DOGE team was working at the Education Department on Monday to
implement Trump’s executive orders and agenda, said Madison Biedermann,
an Education Department spokesperson.</p>
<p>The department did not immediately comment on the personnel changes
and would not say how many employees were placed on leave.</p>
<p>At least 55 Education Department workers received an email Friday
saying they were being put on paid leave effective immediately pursuant
to Trump’s executive order. It wasn’t being done for “any disciplinary
purpose,” according to a copy of the email obtained by The Associated
Press.</p>
<p>Those placed on leave lost access to their government email accounts
and were told not to report to the office. They include a range of staff
members and managers across the department, which employs more than
4,000 workers in Washington and regional offices across the country.</p>
<p>Most of those on leave appear to have taken a voluntary diversity
training seminar offered by the department, Smith said. The Diversity
Change Agent program has been promoted by the agency for years,
including during Trump’s first term in office.</p>
<p>Graduates of the two-day program were expected to serve as role
models and help improve the department’s “capacity to attract and retain
a diverse workforce,” according to an internal email from 2019 obtained
by the AP.</p>
<p>Smith said hundreds of employees have taken the training, but it was
unclear if all of them were placed on leave. She said many people were
under the impression the training was strongly encouraged or
required.</p>
<p>“It seems unfair to encourage or require people to take a training
and then four or five years later place them on administrative leave,”
Smith said.</p>
<p>Some current employees who are on leave said the action could disrupt
the agency’s core work, including the management of federal student
loans and the FAFSA form for student financial aid. The workers spoke on
the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.</p>
<p>Senator Patty Murray, D-Wash., a former teacher and member of the
Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said Trump is
“purging” employees for taking a training course that his administration
encouraged them to take.</p>
<p>“This won’t help our kids learn or even save us money,” Murray said
on the social media site X. “He’s just breaking services people rely
on.”</p>
<p>Trump’s order called for all DEI staff in the federal government to
be put on paid leave and eventually laid off. It’s part of a broader
crackdown on diversity programs that the Republican president says are
racist.</p>
<p>Trump campaigned on a promise to shut down the Education Department,
which he says has been infiltrated by “radicals, zealots and Marxists.”
He said the agency’s power should be turned over to states and
schools.</p>

<h2 id="us-foreign-aid-programs-face-major-restructuring-under-trump">US
foreign aid programs face major restructuring under Trump</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which manages
tens of billions of dollars’ worth of U.S. foreign aid programs, was
essentially closed down on Monday, with employees locked out of their
offices and computer systems. Several senior figures in the agency were
placed on leave as the Trump administration took steps to fold its
functions into the Department of State. </p>
<p>Speaking to reporters in El Salvador, where he was traveling,
Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he is now USAID’s acting director
and would be taking steps to bring the agency’s activities in line with
the policies of the administration.</p>
<p>Rubio described the agency as historically “unresponsive” to Congress
and the White House, even though the agency, he claimed, is supposed to
take its direction from the State Department.</p>
<p>“USAID has a history of sort of ignoring that and deciding that
there’s somehow a global charity separate from the national interest,”
Rubio said. “These are taxpayer dollars, and we owe the American people
assurances that every dollar we are spending abroad is being spent on
something that furthers our national interest.”</p>
<p>Rubio’s comments were less harsh than those of billionaire Elon Musk,
who President Donald Trump has given significant power to overhaul the
federal government, and whose newly formed Department of Government
Efficiency (DOGE) sent representatives into USAID offices over the
weekend.</p>
<p>“USAID is a criminal organization,” Musk wrote on the social media
platform X on Sunday. “Time for it to die.”</p>
<p>Democrats protest</p>
<p>Democrats in Washington described the effort to dismantle USAID as
blatantly illegal and vowed to challenge it.</p>
<p>On Sunday, all 10 Democratic members of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee sent a letter to Rubio outlining their objections.</p>
<p>“Congress established the U.S. Agency for International Development
(USAID) as an independent agency, separate from the Department of State,
to ensure that we can deploy development expertise and U.S. foreign
assistance quickly, particularly in times of crisis, to meet our
national security goals,” they wrote.</p>
<p>“For this reason, any effort to merge or fold USAID into the
Department of State should be, and by law must be, previewed, discussed,
and approved by Congress,” the letter said.</p>
<p>In a news conference in front of USAID headquarters in Washington,
Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen, a member of the Foreign Relations
Committee, said that he and his colleagues would prevent Trump from
filling vacancies at the State Department in response to the
administration’s actions. </p>
<p>“We will do everything we can to block State Department nominees from
going forward until this illegal action is reversed,” he said.</p>
<p>USAID history</p>
<p>USAID was created in the early 1960s, at a time when there was a
widespread understanding in post-World War II Washington that U.S. aid
efforts, administered by a patchwork of agencies, were inefficient,
often duplicative, and sometimes contradictory.</p>
<p>In many cases, aid was also explicitly tied to the United States’
political priorities, rather than the objective level of need present in
nations receiving assistance.</p>
<p>In 1961, President John F. Kennedy’s administration undertook a broad
review of U.S. aid programs, and he subsequently asked Congress for the
authority to develop a new agency to coordinate foreign aid efforts.</p>
<p>In a message to Congress, Kennedy proposed an agency that would
create country-specific teams that would operate on the ground in
recipient nations to develop long-term plans. He described these as “a
carefully thought-through program tailored to meet the needs and the
resource potential of each individual country, instead of a series of
individual, unrelated projects.”</p>
<p>“Frequently, in the past, our development goals and projects have not
been undertaken as integral steps in a long-range economic development
program,” Kennedy said. “Long-term planning and financing — the only way
to make meaningful and economical commitments.”</p>
<p>Created by executive order</p>
<p>Later that year, Congress passed the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961,
requiring the abolition of several existing aid programs and directing
the president to designate a new entity to take responsibility for their
operations. The act also explicitly separated foreign military aid from
humanitarian aid programs.</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, Kennedy signed the bill into law and issued
Executive Order 10973, creating the U.S. Agency for International
Development.</p>
<p>The agency was structured such that its administrator reported
directly to the Secretary of State, rather than up through the chain of
command within the State Department. It was an arrangement that allowed
USAID some freedom of operation, but one that would be challenged
repeatedly over the years, as successive secretaries of state sought to
force USAID’s priorities into closer alignment with State Department
policies.</p>
<p>Many successes</p>
<p>Over the ensuing 60-plus years, USAID tallied a considerable number
of successes, and also weathered numerous controversies and scandals,
many of which were catalogued by journalist John Norris in a history of
the agency published in 2021, the year of its 60th anniversary.</p>
<p>USAID-provided food aid has saved countless lives around the world,
and its early focus on developing competent local governance structures
was central to helping countries like South Korea and Taiwan develop
flourishing industrial bases.</p>
<p>In the late 1960s, the agency took on a leading role in the global
effort to eradicate smallpox, which had killed an estimated 300 million
people since the dawn of the 20th century alone. The agency helped
spearhead inoculation programs across the developing world that
contributed to the first known global eradication of disease in the
human population through a public health program. </p>
<p>USAID also helped pioneer the use of oral rehydration therapy (ORT)
for children afflicted with diarrhea. By distributing packets of
water-soluble salts and sugars, the agency has helped prevent the deaths
of millions of children in developing countries.</p>
<p>The agency has also been at the forefront of efforts to reduce the
incidence in developing countries of mothers’ deaths during childbirth
and reducing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, in particular
HIV.</p>
<p>Controversies</p>
<p>Despite Kennedy’s hope that the distribution of U.S. aid could be
disentangled from geopolitics, USAID has, many times in its history,
found itself supporting abusive or autocratic governments, frequently in
Latin America, because the federal government believed doing so was in
the national interest.</p>
<p>Public discontent with USAID grew in tandem with frustration at the
war in Vietnam, where the agency had played a major role in unsuccessful
“pacification” programs meant to win the “hearts and minds” of the
Vietnamese people. President Richard Nixon attempted to capitalize on
that discontent to abolish the agency and decentralize foreign aid
programs.</p>
<p>Instead, Congress took steps to refocus the agency’s efforts,
directing it to back away from high-level engagement with foreign
governments in favor of work on rural development and aid to the
neediest.</p>
<p>In the ensuing years, however, controversies continued to emerge,
none more prominent than those arising from the agency’s activities
during the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Widespread questions were
raised, including by members of Congress, about how the agency spent
funds earmarked for reconstruction of those two countries.</p>

Other Funding Freeze Attacks Environmental Justice</h2>

<p class="drop-caps">
Amidst the chaos surrounding President Trump’s
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-ira-funding-pause" target="_self"><u>pause
on infrastructure and climate spending</u></a>, another federal funding
freeze is going very much under the radar, undermining energy and
resilience projects across the U.S. and its territories.
</p>
<p>
Days after Trump took office, acting Energy Secretary Ingrid Kolb
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/doe-halts-diversity-equity-work-and-funding/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reportedly
told</u></a> DOE in a memo to suspend any work “requiring, using, or
enforcing Community Benefit Plans, and requiring, using, or enforcing
Justice40 requirements, conditions, or principles” in any loan or loan
guarantee, any grant, any cost-sharing agreement or any “contracts,
contract awards, or any other source of financial assistance.” The memo
stipulated this would apply to “existing” awards, grants, contracts and
other financial assistance, according to
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hmnorthey.bsky.social" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>E&amp;E
News</em></em></u><u>’ Hannah Northey</u></a>, who first reported the
document’s existence.
</p>
<p>
Justice40 was Biden’s signature
<a href="https://eelp.law.harvard.edu/tracker/rollback-trump-rescinded-bidens-executive-order-14008-that-established-justice40-initiative/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>environmental
justice initiative</u></a>. Community benefit plans were
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250109182715/https://www.energy.gov/infrastructure/local-investments-map-demonstration-and-deployment-projects" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>often
used by Biden’s DOE</u></a> to strengthen the potential benefits that
projects could have on surrounding local economies and were seen as a
vehicle for environmental justice. When we say <em><em>often</em></em>,
we mean it: some high profile examples of these plans include those used
for the
<a href="https://www.powermag.com/doe-loan-programs-office-publishes-community-benefits-plans-for-energy-projects/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Holtec
Palisades nuclear plant restart in Michigan</u></a> and the agency’s
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2024-02/Community-Benefits-Plans-Training-for-DPA-Heat-Pumps-and-Advanced-Manufacturing-Grants-Applicants.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>battery
materials processing and recycling awards</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
After Kolb’s edict went out, companies, states, cities, and other
entities with DOE contracts that had community benefit plans embedded in
them were ordered to stop all work, according to multiple letters to
contract recipients reviewed by Heatmap News. “Recipients and
subrecipients must cease any activities, including contracted
activities, and stop incurring costs associated with DEI and CBP
activities effective as of the date of this letter,” one letter reads,
adding: “Costs incurred after the date of this letter will not be
reimbursed.”
</p>
<p>
One
<a href="https://www.cogr.edu/sites/default/files/CBP%20and%20DEI%20Notification%20to%20existing%20recipients%20-%201.27.2025.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>such
letter</u></a> was posted by the University of Michigan research
department in an advisory notice. The department’s
<a href="https://www.cogr.edu/sites/default/files/CBP%20and%20DEI%20Notification%20to%20existing%20recipients%20-%201.27.2025.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>website</u></a>
summarizes the letter as “directing the suspension” of all work tied to
“any source of DOE funding” if it in any way involved “diversity,
equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs,” as well as Justice40 requirements
and community benefits plans.
</p>
<p>
These letters state companies and other entities with community benefit
plans in their contracts or otherwise involved in their funding awards
would be contacted by DOE to make “modifications” to their contracts.
They only cite President Trump’s executive orders that purportedly
address Diversity, Equity and Inclusion practices; they do not cite a
much-debated Office of Management and Budget
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-funding-freeze-chaos" target="_self"><u>memo
freezing</u></a> all infrastructure law and Inflation Reduction Act
spending, which has been challenged in federal court. It is altogether
unclear if any outcome of the OMB memo litigation is even relevant to
this other freeze.
</p>
<p>
We reached out to the Energy Department about these letters for comment
on how many entities may be impacted and why they targeted community
benefit plans. We will update this story if we hear back.
</p>
<p>
A lot is still murky about this situation. It is unclear how many
entities have been impacted and the totality of the impacts may be
unknown for a while, because a lot of these entities supposed to get
money may want to keep fighting privately to, well, still get their
money. It’s also hazy if all entities that received these letters are
continuing to do any construction or preparatory work or other labor
connected to their funding not tied to the community benefit planning,
or just halting the funded labor altogether.
</p>
<p>
The blast radius from this freeze is hard to parse, said Matthew Tejada,
a former EPA staffer who most recently served as the agency’s deputy
assistant administrator for environmental justice under the Biden
administration. Tejada, who now works for the advocacy group NRDC and
remains connected to advocates in the environmental justice space, said
he was very much aware of this separate freeze when he was first reached
by Heatmap. But “unless you’re able to really have a network of
information bottom up from the recipients, it’s a bit of a black box
we’re operating around because we’re not going to get transparency and
information from the administration.“
</p>
<p>
“Part of their obvious strategy here is to create enough confusion as
possible to make defending as difficult as possible. But I’m fairly
certain the community and various others here – local governments,
tribes – will have plenty to say about cutting through that chaos to
make sure the will of Congress and the outcomes of these programs and
projects are delivered upon.” He believes that any attempts to modify
these contract awards “on the pretext of canceling the contract[s] will
in all likelihood meet a legal challenge.”
</p>
<p>
But the ripple effects of this other freeze are starting to surface in
local news accounts.
</p>
<p>
According to
<a href="https://www.goerie.com/story/news/local/2025/01/28/trump-federal-funding-freeze-affecting-city-of-erie-schember-witherspoon/77993701007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
</u><u><em><em>Erie Times-News</em></em></u></a>, the city of Erie,
Pennsylvania currently cannot access funding for a city-wide audit for
home energy efficiency. And a big road improvement project in the
Mariana Islands – a U.S. territory – was nearly derailed by the freeze,
according to the news outlet
<a href="https://www.mvariety.com/news/local/beach-road-project-barely-escapes-funding-halt-order/article_92296652-debb-11ef-a74f-27fec0895987.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>Mariana’s
Variety</em></em></u></a>, which reported project developers are just
going to try and move forward without the remaining money provided under
contract.
</p>
<p>
We’ll have to wait and see the breadth of the impacts here and whether
this freeze will produce its own legal or regulatory rollercoaster. Hang
on tight.

Tariffs Could Hurt Gas Cars More Than EVs</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-04, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NjE1MzU5NS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3NjA4MzY2NH0.FxjaiVOyJ7SLMhU2BzS0d39Z9HJSKfuT-vwZoiQXHPM/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
If President Trump’s proposed 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada — which
were set to begin tomorrow morning before the two countries’ leaders
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/mexico-tariff-pause" target="_self"><u>negotiated
30-day delays</u></a> — were to go into effect, they would hit
automotive supply chains like a lightning bolt. A single spring inside a
fuel pump can zig-zag across the northern and southern U.S. borders half
a dozen times before making it into a vehicle. The jolt of tariffs would
follow it, gathering force at each crossing before shocking car buyers
with higher prices.
</p>
<p>
Electric vehicles, however, famously do not have as many parts as
conventional cars. There’s no engine, transmission, exhaust system, or
fuel pump. EV drivers will also not have to contend with
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-canada-oil-tariffs" target="_self"><u>the
effect of tariffs on the price of gasoline</u></a>. So does it follow
that, despite Trump’s wish to undo Biden’s EV subsidies, he would
actually be making battery-powered cars more competitive?
</p>
<p>
Experts I spoke with agreed that EV manufacturers might be somewhat less
exposed. But the tariffs will still affect them, and the small edge
could be outweighed by other Trump administration policies.
</p>
<p>
An internal combustion engine vehicle can have 20,000 to 30,000 parts,
Amy Broglin-Peterson, an expert in automotive supply chains at Michigan
State University, told me; an electric vehicle might have anywhere from
several hundred to a few thousand. Many of these components are
manufactured by independent specialists throughout North America.
“They’ll be assembled utilizing cheaper Mexican labor, and then they’ll
cross back into the U.S. and be put into a bigger assembly, which is
then sent back down again for either more assembly work or finished
vehicle production,” she said.
</p>
<p>
Electric vehicles also contain many of the same complex components as
conventional cars, like seats and lights and dashboards and radios and
mirrors. “That’s kind of the great equalizer amongst these different
vehicles,” Mike Wall, an auto analyst at S&amp;P Global Mobility told
me. “They’re all going to be in the same soup in terms of vulnerability
to cross-border trade.”
</p>
<p>
But EVs lack the most complex component of all — the engine. Instead,
EVs have a battery, and many automakers are either already producing
their batteries in the U.S. or are building new factories to do so. As
of December, there were more than 80 facilities making battery
components, assembling battery packs and cells, manufacturing drive
units, producing EV chargers, and doing final EV assembly in the U.S.,
<a href="https://www.charged-the-book.com/na-ev-supply-chain-map" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>according
to a database</u></a> maintained by Wellesley University historian Jay
Turner. But that’s set to increase over the next few years due to tax
incentives and grants that were part of Biden’s Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act, which reward domestic
manufacturing of clean technology components. More than 200 additional
facilities, including critical mineral extraction and processing
facilities, are in various stages of development.
</p>
<p>
Broglin-Peterson told me her quick answer to my question is that EVs
likely wouldn’t be hit quite as hard by tariffs as conventional cars.
But she emphasized that they will still see an impact, and she wasn’t
sure of the extent to which other Trump administration policies would
undermine any tariff-related advantages. “The EV picture right now has
become a lot more murky, obviously, since President Trump was elected,”
she told me. “I do think the traditional automakers are more heavily
leveraged, though, on their internal combustion engine supply chains.”
</p>
<p>
Wall agreed that EVs were somewhat less exposed, but he said it really
depends on which internal combustion engine vehicle you’re comparing
them to. Some engines are assembled in the U.S. and have more
U.S.-manufactured components than others. Battery makers are still
vulnerable, as the processing of the critical minerals that go into EV
batteries is currently
<a href="https://www.resources.org/common-resources/critical-minerals-for-electric-vehicles-what-you-need-to-know/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>heavily
concentrated in China</u></a>, which will also be hit by 10% tariffs on
top of
<a href="https://www.whitecase.com/insight-alert/united-states-finalizes-section-301-tariff-increases-imports-china" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>existing
tariffs</u></a> on Chinese goods. When you take into account the
president’s plans to end the electric vehicle tax credit and leasing
option, which can shave up to $7,500 off a car’s sticker price, EVs
could still end up less competitive than before Trump took office, Wall
said.
</p>
<p>
Some electric vehicle producers will be hit harder than others. Tesla,
for instance, has one of the lowest exposures to non-U.S. content,
according to
<a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/part-583-american-automobile-labeling-act-reports" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>data</u></a>
collected by the Department of Transportation. But some 20% to 25% of
Tesla components come from Mexico.
</p>
<p>
“There’s a lot of uncertainty around tariffs,” Vaibhav Taneja, Tesla’s
chief financial officer, said during an earnings call last week. “Over
the years, we’ve tried to localize our supply chain in every market, but
we are still reliant on parts from across the world for all our
businesses.” The company’s stock price dropped 5% on Monday, though that
may be partly because the company also
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-loses-market-share-sweden-norway-musk-looms-large-2025-02-03/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>lost
market share in Europe</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Rivian builds its EVs in Illinois and is opening a second factory in
Georgia. But the company’s CEO RJ Scaringe
<a href="https://insideevs.com/news/749147/rivian-ceo-trump-tariffs-mexico/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>told
</u><u><em><em>Inside EVs</em></em></u></a> that tariffs will still
hurt. “Many, many, many hundreds of billions of dollars have been
invested in Mexico in production capacity for supply chains that supply
to all of us,” he said. “That will need to get remapped or will just
carry higher costs.”
</p>
<p>
Other manufacturers are more spread out. Ford assembles its Mustang
Mach-E in Mexico and its F-150 Lightning in Michigan. GM makes its Chevy
Silverado, GM Sierra, and Cadillac Escalade EVs in Michigan, but its
Equinox and Blazer EVs in Mexico. Stellantis makes its electric Jeep
Wagoneer in Mexico, but recently
<a href="https://www.stellantis.com/en/news/press-releases/2024/september/stellantis-invests-more-than-406-million-dollars-in-three-michigan-facilities-to-execute-multi-energy-strategy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>invested
more than $400 million</u></a> to prep three of its Michigan factories
for EV assembly.
</p>
<p>
Analysts told me not to expect any sudden moves from car companies.
“Revamping the automotive supply chain to be 100% U.S. based is probably
not realistic,” David Whiston, an equity strategist who covers the auto
sector for Morningstar, told me in an email. “Companies right now are
not willing to pivot capacity on a dime — they won’t allocate capital
without more certainty.”
</p>
<p>
Trump doesn’t have much interest in certainty. After threatening to put
the tariffs into immediate effect last weekend, the president quickly
struck agreements with Mexican president Claudia Sheinbaum and Canadian
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday to pause the tariffs for 30 days
while the countries negotiate. He has yet to discuss next steps with
China.

extends block on Trump administration federal funding freeze</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — A judge in the nation’s capital kept a temporary block
on a Trump administration plan for a freeze on federal funding Monday
after some nonprofit groups said they’re still struggling to get
promised grants and loans.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Loren L. AliKhan extended an order she issued
last week that paused a sweeping plan to freeze potentially trillions in
federal spending. While the memo outlining it has since been rescinded,
the Republican administration has said some kind of funding freeze is
still planned as part of his blitz of executive orders.</p>
<p>A second judge in Rhode Island has also blocked any federal spending
pause in a separate lawsuit filed by nearly two dozen Democratic
states.</p>
<p>In the Washington lawsuit, several groups reported being unable to
access promised federal funding even after the memo was rescinded. They
ranged from childcare in Wisconsin to disability services in West
Virginia to a small business research project on neutron generation and
detection.</p>
<p>“For many, the harms caused by the freeze are non-speculative,
impending, and potentially catastrophic,” AliKhan wrote.</p>
<p>The Trump administration argues a brief pause in funding to align
federal spending with the president’s agenda is within the law, and the
court lacks constitutional authority to block it.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump’s executive orders have sought to increase
fossil fuel production, remove protections for transgender people and
end diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.</p>
<p>AliKhan though, found that “furthering the President’s wishes cannot
be a blank check for OMB to do as it pleases,” she wrote, referring to
the Office of Management and Budget, the White House office that doles
out federal money.</p>
<p>Lawyers with the advocacy group Democracy Forward are representing
the nonprofits. They say the sweeping funding pause breaks federal law,
puts nonprofits at risk of being shuttered and violates their First
Amendment rights.</p>

id="tariff-threats-take-aim-at-fentanyl-trafficking-heres-how-drug-reaches-us">Tariff
threats take aim at fentanyl trafficking; here’s how drug reaches
US</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>President Donald Trump’s plan to impose tariffs on goods from Mexico,
Canada and China is partly aimed at combating the illicit flow of
fentanyl into the U.S., where the opioid is blamed for some 70,000
overdose deaths annually. </p>
<p>Mexico agreed Monday to send 10,000 troops to the U.S.-Mexico border
as part of a deal with Trump to pause the tariffs for a month — and hold
off levying its own. </p>
<p>Neither Canada nor China has signaled major changes to tackle the
flow of fentanyl into the U.S., and each has said it would retaliate for
any U.S. tariffs. </p>
<p>What role do Mexico, Canada and China play in fentanyl reaching the
U.S.? And how much can their governments do? </p>
<p>Where does fentanyl come from? </p>
<p>The ingredients in fentanyl are largely produced by companies in
China and used by pharmaceutical companies to make legal painkillers.
But a portion of those chemicals is purchased by the Sinaloa and Jalisco
cartels in Mexico. </p>
<p>Cartels make the synthetic opioid in labs and then smuggle it into
the U.S., largely at official land crossings in California and Arizona.
The small amounts of fentanyl in any shipment — the drug is 50 times
more potent than heroin — and its lack of odor make detection and
seizures extremely challenging. </p>
<p>Fentanyl is also made in Canada and smuggled into the U.S., but to a
much lesser extent. U.S. customs agents seized 19.5 kilograms (43
pounds) of fentanyl at the Canadian border during the last fiscal year,
compared with 9,570 kilograms (21,100 pounds) at the Mexican
border. </p>
<p>Seizures of fentanyl jumped by as much as tenfold under President Joe
Biden, an increase that may reflect improved detection. </p>
<p>What changed after Trump threatened tariffs? </p>
<p>Mexico announced in December the seizure of more than a ton of
fentanyl pills in what it described as the largest bust of synthetic
opioids in the country’s history. The haul was striking because fentanyl
seizures in Mexico had fallen dramatically in the first half of
2024. </p>
<p>Under President Claudia Sheinbaum, who took office in October,
Mexico’s security forces appear to be far more aggressive than they were
under her predecessor. Former President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador
denied that fentanyl was even produced in Mexico, contradicting
officials in his own administration. </p>
<p>To pause the tit-for-tat tariffs, Mexico agreed to immediately deploy
10,000 National Guard troops to the border to battle drug-trafficking,
while the U.S. committed to do more to stop the trafficking of guns into
Mexico, said Trump and Sheinbaum on social media. </p>
<p>Facing tariff threats, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has
highlighted his country’s recent $1.3 billion investment in border
enforcement, including chemical detection tools at entry ports and a new
unit focused on the oversight of precursor chemicals. </p>
<p>Once Trump ordered the tariffs, Trudeau rebuked the move. </p>
<p>“We, too, are devastated by the scourge that is fentanyl,” Trudeau
said at a press conference Sunday. “As neighbors, we must work
collaboratively to fix this. Unfortunately, the actions taken today by
the White House split us apart instead of bringing us together.” </p>
<p>China defended its efforts to combat fentanyl in what has been years
of touch-and-go cooperation with the U.S. China doesn’t have the same
fentanyl crisis among its own population, and doesn’t view it as a
priority, said Zongyuan Zoe Liu, a senior fellow for China studies at
the Council on Foreign Relations. </p>
<p>How much can Mexico, Canada and China do? </p>
<p>Combating the production and movement of illicit fentanyl is
particularly challenging. </p>
<p>Unlike heroin and cocaine, which are produced from plants, fentanyl
is made with ingredients used for legal pharmaceutical drugs, and can be
made in cheap labs that can be erected relatively quickly. And despite
the dangers, demand in the U.S. for the highly addictive drug remains
strong. </p>
<p>Mike Vigil, the former chief of international operations at the U.S.
Drug Enforcement Agency, said he was skeptical that Mexico’s extra
troops at the border on their own would make much of a dent in
trafficking. </p>
<p>Once fentanyl leaves the labs, it’s usually well concealed in hidden
compartments of vehicles or in huge cargo trucks; better detection
technology is crucial, in addition to more troops, he said. The other
challenge, Vigil said, is that combating the fentanyl trade will likely
require more than just collaboration between the U.S. and its
neighbors. </p>
<p>“Even if Mexico, Canada and these other countries snap their fingers
and did away with the drug trade, as long as we have that demand, there
will be another country that will satisfy that demand.”</p>

athletes bring buzz to New Orleans before Super Bowl</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — The Super Bowl isn’t just a game on Sunday, it’ll
involve a nearly weeklong spectacle taking over New Orleans with
non-stop entertainment leading up to the big showdown between the Kansas
City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles. </p>
<p>While the Chiefs and Eagles gear up for their championship rematch,
the Big Easy will be the epicenter for star-studded concerts, exclusive
parties, a comedy show, and guest lists filled with A-listers. From Post
Malone, Cardi B to Shaquille O’Neal, the city will be buzzing long
before Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs attempt a monumental
three-peat. </p>
<p>“It’s going to be fun. It’s going to be different than other Super
Bowls,” said O’Neal, who will host his popular carnival-themed Shaq’s
Fun House on Friday night. It’s a hot ticket — starting at $199 — for
the NBA legend’s over-the-top festival event featuring headline
performances from Ludacris, John Summit and O’Neal under his stage name
DJ Diesel. </p>
<p>O’Neal’s event will feature several attractions including a Ferris
wheel, circus performers and premium bar. This will be somewhat of a
homecoming week for O’Neal, who played college hoops at Louisiana State
University and visits Louisiana about four times a year. </p>
<p>For Flavor Flav, he wants to help lift morale in New Orleans
following the aftermath of the terror attack that killed 14 people on
New Year’s Day. </p>
<p>“This is going to be special. I’m here to uplift spirits,” said Flav,
who will perform at Guy Fieri’s Flavortown Tailgate along with Diplo and
Cowboy Mouth on Sunday afternoon. It’s free for general admission with
paid upgraded experiences for $49.99 and $349 for a VIP ticket. </p>
<p>“I’m getting on the turntables to make people party and have a good
time,” he said. </p>
<p>Along with those events, here’s a look at some of the invite-only and
public events during a busy Super Bowl week: </p>
<p>Fanatics party </p>
<p>Michael Rubin’s Fanatics Super Bowl party is impossible to get into
without an invite. The star-studded affair on Saturday afternoon is
strictly for the who’s who of sports and entertainment. </p>
<p>Rubin, the founder and CEO of Fanatics, will likely be front and
center, taking in performances from Post Malone, Travis Scott, Don
Tolliver and many more. </p>
<p>The expected attendees include big names such as Kim Kardashian,
Justin Bieber, Lil Baby, Tiffany Haddish and Tom Brady. </p>
<p>Madden Bowl </p>
<p>Just like EA Sports’ iconic phrase, “It’s in the game,” Jelly Roll,
Chris Stapleton and Shaboozey will literally be in the game at the
Madden Bowl. </p>
<p>The trio is set to separately take the stage Friday night, bringing
the hype before the competition kicks off. </p>
<p>“I can’t wait to keep this party going,” Shaboozey said. </p>
<p>Along with performances, the event will include the Madden NFL 25
Championship Series in front of a live audience — where two of the
world’s best players will travel to New Orleans for their share of the
$1 million prize pool. </p>
<p>Double up for some, triple duties for others </p>
<p>The Madden Bowl won’t be the only stage where Stapleton will showcase
his powerhouse vocals. The country star is set to headline the SiriusXM
and Pandora concert Thursday night. </p>
<p>Stapleton’s performance will air on SiriusXM’s Chris Stapleton Radio,
an exclusive channel curated and presented by him and his band. Pandora
listeners can access the Chris Stapleton Radio station. </p>
<p>After Ludacris takes the stage at Shaq’s Fun House on Friday, the
rapper will perform Sunday at On Location’s Super Bowl pregame party.
He’ll be joined by rock band The Revivalists at the Club 67 and
Touchdown Club just outside the Caesars Superdome for One Location — a
premium hospitality provider of the NFL. </p>
<p>Post Malone will be making moves too. He’s scheduled to perform at
three different events. Along with Fanatics, the superstar artist will
hit the stage at the Bud Light Backyard Tour on Friday, then he’s set to
headline the YouTube Tailgate Concert on Sunday near the Superdome. </p>
<p>Diplo will perform at parties for Sports Illustrated and Maxim along
with Guy Fieri’s tailgate event. </p>
<p>Gospel celebration </p>
<p>Bill Bellamy and Rocsi Diaz will bring some gospel flavor to the Big
Easy. </p>
<p>The tandem will host the Super Bowl Soulful Celebration on Wednesday
night. The lineup includes some of music’s best from The Isley Brothers,
Muni Long, Yolanda Adams, Tori Kelly and Jonathan McReynolds. </p>
<p>Other performances include New Orleans natives Master P, Big Freedia,
Lucky Daye and Trombone Shorty. The NFL Players Choir will also
participate. </p>
<p>“Hosting the Super Bowl Soulful Celebration is like hitting the
trifecta: music, faith, and football all in one show,” Bellamy said.
“I’m excited to bring some laughs, some energy and to be part of this
incredible night with an amazing lineup.” </p>
<p>Michael Strahan, an NFL Hall of Famer and Good Morning America
co-anchor, will receive the Lifetime of Inspiration award. He called the
honor “truly special.” </p>
<p>New Orleans Saints player Cameron Jordan will be given the community
award while Los Angeles Rams star rookie Jared Verse will be honored
with the rising star award. </p>
<p>Timbaland and Maxim </p>
<p>Super producer Timbaland will bring his massive hits into New Orleans
with the help of Maxim. </p>
<p>Timbaland will perform at a special concert at the Maxim Saints &amp;
Sinners Big Game Party on Saturday. The show will include performances

Gras,” 50 Cent will hold the Super Bold Comedy Block Party with standups
from Bill Bellamy, Chico Bean and DC Young Fly. </p>
<p>Dom Dolla and Diplo will perform at the Sports Illustrated
Party. </p>
<p>On Friday, Nelly and the Chainsmokers are set to perform at h.wood
Homecoming and the Draft Kings event. Shannon Sharpe and Chad

id="dramatic-drop-in-monarch-butterfly-count-nears-record-30-year-low">Dramatic
drop in monarch butterfly count nears record 30-year low</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MADISON, WISCONSIN — The number of monarch butterflies spending the
winter in the western United States has dropped to its second-lowest
mark in nearly three decades as pesticides, diminishing habitat and
climate change take their toll on the beloved pollinator.</p>
<p>Here’s what to know:</p>
<p>The survey began in 1997</p>
<p>Monarch butterflies, known for their distinctive orange-and-black
wings, are found across North America. Monarchs in the eastern United
States spend their winters in Mexico and are counted by the World
Wildlife Fund, which has yet to release data for this year. Monarchs
west of the Rocky Mountains typically overwinter along the California
coast.</p>
<p>The Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation has been counting
western overwinter populations along the California coast, northern Baja
California and inland sites in California and Arizona for the last 28
years. The highest number recorded was 1.2 million in 1997. The
organization announced Friday that it counted just 9,119 monarchs in
2024, a decrease of 96% from 233,394 in 2023. The total was the second
lowest since the survey began in 1997. The record-low was 1,901 monarchs
in 2020.</p>
<p>The survey noted that a site owned by The Nature Conservancy in Santa
Barbara that saw 33,200 monarchs last winter hosted only 198 butterflies
this year.</p>
<p>Heat may have doomed western monarchs</p>
<p>Monarchs across the continent face mounting threats, chief among them
vanishing milkweed, the host plant for the insect’s caterpillars. The
plant has been disappearing before a combination of drought, wildfires,
agriculture and urban development, according to Monarch Joint Venture, a
group that works to protect monarchs. Pesticides have contaminated much
of the remaining plants, according to the Xerces Society.</p>
<p>It’s unclear what caused such a sharp drop-off in the western
population in just one year, said Emma Pelton, an endangered species
biologist with the Xerces Society. The monarch population is already
small, she said, and triple-digit heat in the western states last year
may have slowed breeding.</p>
<p>Monarchs suffer when the mercury gets up to 37.7 degrees Celsius (100
degrees Fahrenheit) and any temperatures above 42.2 C (108 F) are lethal
to the insects, Pelton said. The western states saw a heat wave in July
that drove temperatures in some areas well past 37.7 C (100 F). Palm
Springs, for example, hit a record 51.1 C (124 F) on July 5. Another
heat wave cooked northern California in early October, with multiple
cities breaking heat records.</p>
<p>Western monarchs’ future looks murky</p>
<p>Pelton said that it’s too early to tell what long-term impact the
dramatic losses might have on the overall western monarch population.
Insects do have the potential for exponential growth, Pelton said. After
bottoming out at 1,901 butterflies in 2020, the population rebounded to
247,246 insects the following year, an increase of nearly 13,000%. The
year after that the survey recorded 335,479 monarchs.</p>
<p>“This is bad news,” Pelton said of the 2024 population drop. “But we
have seen incredible recovery. This doesn’t mean we’re not going to have
western monarchs. It’s hopefully a wake-up call that a bad year can set
them back pretty significantly.”</p>
<p>Federal officials working on protections</p>
<p>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced in December 2024 that it
was working to list monarchs as threatened, a move that would prohibit
anyone from killing them, transporting them or making changes that would
render their property permanently unusable for the species, such as
eradicating all milkweed from the land. The listing also would protect
1,779 hectares (4,395 acres) in seven coastal California counties that
serve as overwinter sites for western monarchs.</p>
<p>A public comment period on the proposal is set to end in March. The
agency has until December to officially list the monarch as threatened
if officials decide to move forward.</p>
<p>Earthjustice, an environmental law firm, petitioned the Environmental
Protection Agency in December 2024 to mandate testing pesticide effects
on insects such as bees, moths and butterflies.</p>

administration moves to end deportation protections for 348,000
Venezuelans</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON/MARACAIBO, Venezuela — U.S. Homeland Security Secretary
Kristi Noem on Monday moved to remove protection against deportation
from hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans in the U.S., part of President
Donald Trump’s expanding immigration crackdown.</p>
<p>The decision means about 348,000 Venezuelans with Temporary Protected
Status, more than half of all Venezuelans in the program, could be
deported and lose work permits in April, according to a government
notice.</p>
<p>The notice said the protections were contrary to U.S. interests and
no longer justified by conditions in Venezuela.</p>
<p>Trump, a Republican, took office on Jan. 20 vowing to crack down on
illegal immigration and humanitarian programs he says go beyond the
intent of U.S. law. Trump tried to end most enrollment in the temporary
protection program during his first term but was stymied by federal
courts.</p>
<p>The status is available to people whose home country has experienced
a natural disaster, armed conflict or other extraordinary event.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what will happen,” said Venezuelan migrant Ana Maria
Pirela, 26, who lives in California and has temporary protected
status.</p>
<p>“Yesterday they fired my husband from his job — he had been managing
a food store for two months — and I’m two months pregnant. I don’t want
to go back to Venezuela,” she said by phone.</p>
<p>Former President Joe Biden, a Democrat, greatly expanded the
temporary protection program. It now covers more than 1 million people
from 17 nations, some in the U.S. for decades, and they could face
immediate deportation if they lose the status.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans arrived in the U.S. during
Biden’s presidency, many via legal humanitarian pathways, and deporting
them has been challenging due to frosty U.S.-Venezuela relations. On
Saturday, Trump said Venezuela had agreed to accept all deported people
but provided few details.</p>
<p>Last week, Noem canceled an 18-month extension of temporary
protections for Venezuelans by her Biden-era predecessor, saying the
Trump administration did not want to be bound by that determination. On
Monday, she stopped their status from automatically renewing for six
months. </p>
<p>About 300,000 additional Venezuelans have Temporary Protected Status
that expires in September and were not affected by Monday’s
decision.</p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security said in the termination notice
that while some challenging conditions remain in Venezuela, “there are
notable improvements in several areas such as the economy, public
health, and crime that allow for these nationals to be safely returned
to their home country.”</p>
<p>The termination will be effective 60 days after publication in the
Federal Register, the notice said, or about the first week in April.</p>
<p>Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro’s government has taken some steps
to control inflation, which previously was in the triple digits, but
economic conditions in Venezuela remain dire for most people. The
monthly minimum wage equals about $3.</p>
<p>Maduro was inaugurated for his third term in January, despite a
six-month-long election dispute, international calls for him to stand
aside and an increase in the U.S. reward offered for his capture.</p>
<p>The U.S. charged Maduro and several allies with drug trafficking in
2020, charges he denies. </p>
<p>The Venezuelan opposition, which has faced arrests and other
crackdown measures since the July election, asked the U.S. to keep the
temporary protection program in place.</p>
<p>Opposition leader Edmundo Gonzalez, who moved abroad after Venezuela
issued an arrest warrant for him, recently said on X that the opposition
was still discussing with the U.S. how to protect Venezuelans there.</p>
<p>Venezuelan migrant Tatiana Vazques, who lives in Atlanta, said by
phone that her family submitted a U.S. asylum application but was
anxious after seeing other Venezuelans arrested by U.S. Immigration and
Customs Enforcement (ICE).</p>
<p>“Yesterday ICE took a friend and her husband. There’s anguish,” she
said.</p>

chief travels to Mexico border as Trump cracks down on migration</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth arrived in Texas on
Monday to visit the southern border as President Donald Trump works to
implement a hard-right agenda that includes boosting the U.S. military
presence to keep out illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>In his first trip as Pentagon chief, Hegseth will survey operations
and meet with U.S. troops who have been rushed to the region under
Trump.</p>
<p>“Looking forward to meeting our great warriors and seeing the hard
work they are doing securing our southern border. We will continue to
deliver on this vital mission,” Hegseth wrote on X in a post announcing
his arrival.</p>
<p>Trump ordered 1,500 additional military personnel to the border just
days after taking office, and his administration carried out highly
publicized immigration raids and arrests. Some migrants have been
deported using military aircraft.</p>
<p>Border security is a key priority for the president, who declared a
national emergency at the U.S. border with Mexico on his first day in
office.</p>
<p>The additional personnel have increased the total number of
active-duty troops deployed there to around 4,000.</p>
<p>Ahead of his border visit, Hegseth posted on X that Trump “wants 100%
operational control of the border — and we will deliver.”</p>

markets pare losses after Trump pauses tariff on Mexican imports</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. stock markets fell sharply in early trading Monday but pared
their losses after President Donald Trump paused a planned 25% tariff on
Mexican imports.</p>
<p>The three major U.S. stock indices — the Dow Jones Industrial Average
of 30 blue chip stocks, the broader S&amp;P 500 and the tech-heavy
NASDAQ — all dropped nearly 2% or more on fears that Trump’s new tariffs
targeting Canada, China and Mexico would threaten the global
economy.</p>
<p>But the losses were cut in half after Trump paused the levy on
Mexican goods for a month, even though his planned 25% tariff on
Canadian goods and a 10% levy on Chinese imports were still set to take
hold at midnight.</p>
<p>Trump was planning further discussions mid-afternoon Monday with
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.</p>
<p>Stock markets in Asia fell Monday amid investor concerns about the
tariffs.</p>
<p>Japan’s Nikkei index closed down 2.66%, while South Korea’s KOSPI
index finished off 2.5%. </p>
<p>Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index was down more than 2% in early trading
before rallying to close down just .07%.</p>
<p>Britain’s FTSE index, Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC40 all dropped
more than 1%.</p>
<p>Canada and Mexico both announced tariffs on U.S. goods in response to
Trump’s move before Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum told Trump she
would send 10,000 National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexico border to try
to curb the flow of the deadly opioid fentanyl into the U.S. and Trump
paused his tariff on Mexican imports.</p>
<p>China has pledged to file a protest with the World Trade Organization
over the Trump tariff increase on its exports to the U.S. </p>
<p>Canada, China and Mexico are the top three U.S. trade partners. </p>

orders creation of US sovereign wealth fund, says it could buy
TikTok</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on
Monday ordering the U.S. Treasury and Commerce Departments to create a
sovereign wealth fund and said it may purchase TikTok. </p>
<p>“We’re going to stand this thing up within the next 12 months. We’re
going to monetize the asset side of the U.S. balance sheet for the
American people,” he told reporters. “There’ll be a combination of
liquid assets, assets that we have in this country as we work to bring
them out for the American people.” </p>
<p>Trump had previously floated such a government investment vehicle as
a presidential candidate, saying it could fund “great national
endeavors” like infrastructure projects such as highways and airports,
manufacturing, and medical research.  </p>
<p>Details on how exactly the fund would operate and be financed were
not immediately available, but Trump previously said it could be funded
by “tariffs and other intelligent things.” Typically such funds rely on
a country’s budget surplus to make investments, but the U.S. operates at
a deficit. </p>
<p>There are over 90 such funds across the world managing over $8
trillion in assets, according to the International Forum of Sovereign
Wealth Funds. </p>
<p>TikTok, which has about 170 million American users, was briefly taken
offline just before a law requiring its Chinese owner ByteDance to
either sell it on national security grounds or face a ban took effect on
Jan. 19.  </p>
<p>Trump, after taking office on Jan. 20, signed an executive order
seeking to delay by 75 days the enforcement of the law. </p>
<p>Trump has said that he was in talks with multiple people over
TikTok’s purchase and would likely have a decision on the popular app’s
future in February.</p>

<p>
U.S. President Donald Trump and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum
announced a month-long pause on across-the-board 25% tariff on Mexican
goods imported into the United States that were to take effect on
Tuesday.
</p>
<p>
In a post on Truth Social, Trump said that Sheinbaum had agreed to
deploy 10,000 Mexican troops to the U.S.-Mexico border, “specifically
designated to stop the flow of fentanyl, and illegal migrants into our
Country.” Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of the Treasury
Scott Bessent, and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick will lead talks
in the coming month over what comes next.
</p>
<p>
“I look forward to participating in those negotiations, with President
Sheinbaum, as we attempt to achieve a ‘deal’ between our two Countries,”
Trump wrote.
</p>
<p>
In her own statement, Sheinbaum said the U.S. had committed to work on
preventing the trafficking of firearms into Mexico.
</p>
<p>
There has still been no pause on planned tariffs on Canadian imports,
which would likely affect the flow of
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-canada-tariffs" target="_self"><u>oil,
minerals, and lumber</u></a>, as well as possibly break automobile
supply chains in the United States. Canadian leaders announced several
measures to counter the tariffs at both the federal and provincial
level.
</p>
<p>
Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau have spoken today, and
<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-trump-speak-trade-war-1.7448805" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>are

not optimistic, however, that they’ll
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/03/us/trump-tariffs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>be
able to get a similar deal</u></a>, a Canadian official told <em><em>The
New York Times</em></em>.
</p>
<p>
<em>UPDATE</em> <em>4:55 p.m. ET:</em> Trudeau
<a href="https://x.com/JustinTrudeau/status/1886529228193022429" target="_blank">announced</a>
that he had reached a similar deal that would stave off the imposition
of tariffs for a month. Following a “good call” with Trump, Trudeau said
in a post on X that he would deploy personnel and resources to his
country’s southern border. “Nearly 10,000 frontline personnel are and
will be working on protecting the border,” Trudeau wrote. He also said
that Canada would have a “Fentanyl Czar” and would “launch a Canada-
U.S. Joint Strike Force to combat organized crime, fentanyl and money
laundering.”<br/>

return to the Potomac River to recover wreckage from DC midair
collision</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Arlington — Crews were on the scene on the Potomac River on Monday to
retrieve the submerged wreckage of an airliner and an Army helicopter
that collided midair in the deadliest U.S. air disaster since 2001.</p>
<p>Authorities have recovered and identified 55 of the 67 people killed
in the crash and Washington, D.C., Fire and EMS Chief John Donnelly has
said they are confident all will be found.</p>
<p>Crews were expected to begin the work of lifting the wreckage on
Monday and at daybreak they could be seen aboard a vessel with a crane.
More than 300 responders were taking part in the recovery effort at a
given time, officials said.</p>
<p>Two Navy barges were also deployed to lift heavy wreckage. Divers and
salvage workers are adhering to strict protocols and will stop moving
debris if a body is found, Col. Francis B. Pera of the Army Corps of
Engineers said Sunday.</p>
<p>The “dignified recovery” of remains takes precedence over all else,
he said.</p>
<p>Portions of the two aircraft that collided over the river Wednesday
night near Reagan Washington National Airport — an American Airlines jet
with 64 people aboard and an Army Black Hawk helicopter with 3 aboard —
will be loaded onto flatbed trucks and taken to a hangar for
investigation.</p>
<p>The crash occurred when the jet, en route from Wichita, Kansas, was
about to land. The Black Hawk was on a training mission. There were no
survivors.</p>
<p>On Sunday, family members were taken in buses with a police escort to
the Potomac River bank near where the two aircraft came to rest after
colliding. The plane’s passengers included figure skaters returning from
the 2025 U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Wichita and a group of
hunters returning from a guided trip.</p>
<p>Army Staff Sgt. Ryan Austin O’Hara, 28, of Lilburn, Georgia; Chief
Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Loyd Eaves, 39, of Great Mills, Maryland; and
Capt. Rebecca M. Lobach, of Durham, North Carolina, were in the
helicopter.</p>
<p>Federal investigators were working to piece together the events that
led to the collision.</p>
<p>Full investigations typically take a year or more. Investigators hope
to have a preliminary report within 30 days. Wednesday’s crash was the
deadliest in the U.S. since Nov. 12, 2001, when a jet slammed into a New
York City neighborhood just after takeoff, killing all 260 people on
board and five on the ground.</p>
<p>Experts stress that plane travel is overwhelmingly safe, but the
crowded airspace around Reagan Airport can challenge even experienced
pilots.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>Trump tariffs on Canada and Mexico loom
</h3>
<p>
On Saturday evening, President Trump signed orders placing 25% tariffs
on all goods imported from Canada and Mexico, and a lower, 10% tariff on
Canadian oil, natural gas, uranium, and other energy sources. Trump also
imposed a 10% tariff on all goods imported from China. If the tariffs go
into effect tomorrow as planned, they will affect nearly half of
America’s imports and reshape some of the world’s most important energy
and trading relationships. They could shrink the United States’ GDP by
0.4%, while increasing taxes by $830 per household, according to

<p>
Climate change will wipe $1.47 trillion off of U.S. home values by 2055,

from First Street. Extreme weather is causing insurance costs to rise,
while also changing the desirability of certain areas. This convergence
“suggests there may be fundamental restructuring of home values across
the U.S. in the coming decades,” with property values expected to fall
across the country. Some statistics from the report:
</p>
<p>
<strong>55 million</strong> – Total number of Americans expected to
voluntarily relocate to avoid climate risks by 2055.<br/><strong>5.2
million</strong> – Americans expected to do so this
year.<br/><strong>12.8 million</strong> – Americans expected to relocate
because of wildfire smoke particulate matter by 2055. Nearly 12 million
will move because of flooding, 14.7 million because of extreme heat, and
11 million due to drought.<br/><strong>31%</strong> – increase in the
cost of homeowners insurance since 2019.<br/><strong>22%</strong> – rise
in inflation during the same time.<br/><strong>322%</strong> – expected
increase in Miami’s insurance premiums by 2055. Florida’s premiums have
already gone up by 47% in just five years due to intensifying
hurricanes.<br/><strong>73%</strong> – share of Americans that consider
climate risks when buying a home.<br/><strong>4,107</strong> –
neighborhoods currently classified as “climate resilient,” with low
climate risks and stable insurance rates. These neighborhoods are
expected to drive much of the population growth through 2055. However,
high-risk areas with rising insurance premiums are also projected to
grow until they reach a “tipping point” into population
decline.<br/><strong>21,750</strong> – “climate abandonment”
neighborhoods that are seeing premiums go up and populations go down.
These represent 26% of all neighborhoods.<span></span>

id="south-africa-defends-itself-against-trump-and-musk-attacks-on-land-policy">South
Africa defends itself against Trump and Musk attacks on land policy</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>JOHANNESBURG — South Africa defended itself on Monday against attacks
on its land confiscation policy by Donald Trump and his South
African-born billionaire backer Elon Musk after the U.S. president said
he would cut off funding to the country over the issue. </p>
<p>Trump said on Sunday, without citing evidence, that “South Africa is
confiscating land” and “certain classes of people” were being treated
“very badly.” </p>
<p>“I will be cutting off all future funding to South Africa until a
full investigation of this situation has been completed!” he said. </p>
<p>South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said the government had not
confiscated any land, and he looked forward to engaging with Trump to
foster a better understanding over the matter. </p>
<p>The United States committed nearly $440 million in assistance to
South Africa in 2023, the most recent U.S. government data showed. The
lion’s share of the sum, $315 million, was for HIV/AIDS. </p>
<p>Ramaphosa said U.S. funding accounted for 17% of South Africa’s
HIV/AIDS program but it was reliant on “no other significant funding”
from the United States. </p>
<p>The president signed into law a bill last month to make it easier for
the state to expropriate land in the public interest, despite objections
by some parties in his ruling coalition. The law aims to address stark
racial disparities in land ownership that persist three decades after
the end of apartheid in 1994. </p>
<p>“The recently adopted Expropriation Act is not a confiscation
instrument, but a constitutionally mandated legal process that ensures
public access to land in an equitable and just manner as guided by the
constitution,” the presidency said. </p>
<p>The question of land reform is highly politically charged in South
Africa due to the legacy of the colonial and apartheid eras, when Black
people were dispossessed of their lands and denied property rights. </p>
<p>Musk, the world’s richest person and a South African-born U.S.
citizen who has Trump’s ear and more than 200 million followers on the X
social media platform that he owns, quickly waded into the dispute. </p>
<p>“Why do you have openly racist ownership laws?” he said in a post on
X, responding to Ramaphosa who had posted the presidency statement. He
was apparently suggesting white people were the victims of the racism he
alleged. </p>
<p>Ramaphosa’s spokesperson Vincent Magwenya urged Musk to talk
constructively with the South African president. </p>
<p>“My brother, you would know that owing to a devastating legacy of
centuries of oppressive and brutal colonialism and apartheid, our
constitution provides for redressing the ills of the past,” he
said. </p>
<p>Under the Expropriation Act, special conditions have to be met before
expropriating land such as it having longtime informal occupants, being
unused and held purely for speculation, or being abandoned. </p>
<p>South Africa’s rand fell nearly 2% against the dollar early on Monday
after Trump’s remarks. Stocks and the benchmark government bond also
tumbled. </p>
<p>Charles Robertson, an emerging markets specialist at FIM Partners,
said that African countries were relatively well positioned to withstand
an attack by Trump because the United States was a far less important
investor than China and Europe. </p>
<p>But any U.S. measures against South Africa would represent a serious
challenge for Ramaphosa, who has been trying to boost the sluggish
economy and attract foreign investors, he said. </p>
<p>“The difficulty with South Africa is, do you want to set up a factory
in a country where today, Trump’s cutting off all aid. Maybe tomorrow,
he’s ripping up AGOA (a trade deal with Africa) and maybe on Wednesday,
he’s adding 25% tariffs because they’re too close to China,” he
said.</p>

staffers told to stay out of Washington headquarters after Musk said
Trump agreed to close it</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Staffers of the U.S. Agency for International
Development were instructed to stay out of the agency’s Washington
headquarters on Monday, according to a notice distributed to them, after
billionaire Elon Musk announced President Donald Trump had agreed with
him to shut the agency.</p>
<p>USAID staffers said they also tracked more than 600 employees who
reported being locked out of the agency’s computer systems overnight.
Those still in the system received emails saying that “at the direction
of Agency leadership” the headquarters building “will be closed to
Agency personnel on Monday, Feb. 3.”</p>
<p>The developments come after Musk, who’s leading an extraordinary
civilian review of the federal government with the Republican
president’s agreement, said early Monday that he had spoken with Trump
about the six-decade U.S. aid and development agency and “he agreed we
should shut it down.”</p>
<p>“It became apparent that its not an apple with a worm it in,” Musk
said in a live session on X Spaces early Monday. “What we have is just a
ball of worms. You’ve got to basically get rid of the whole thing. It’s
beyond repair.”</p>
<p>“We’re shutting it down,” he said.</p>
<p>Musk, Trump and some Republican lawmakers have targeted the U.S. aid
and development agency, which oversees humanitarian, development and
security programs in some 120 countries, in increasingly strident terms,
accusing it of promoting liberal causes.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, the Trump administration placed two top security
chiefs at USAID on leave after they refused to turn over classified
material in restricted areas to Musk’s government-inspection teams, a
current and a former U.S. official told The Associated Press on
Sunday.</p>
<p>Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE, earlier
carried out a similar operation at the Treasury Department, gaining
access to sensitive information including the Social Security and
Medicare customer payment systems. The Washington Post reported that a
senior Treasury official had resigned over Musk’s team accessing
sensitive information.</p>
<p>Democratic lawmakers have protested the moves, saying Trump lacks
constitutional authority to shut down USAID without congressional
approval and decrying Musk’s accessing sensitive government-held
information through his Trump-sanctioned inspections of federal
government agencies and programs.</p>
<p>USAID, whose website vanished Saturday without explanation, has been
one of the federal agencies most targeted by the Trump administration in
an escalating crackdown on the federal government and many of its
programs.</p>
<p>“It’s been run by a bunch of radical lunatics. And we’re getting them
out,” Trump said to reporters about USAID on Sunday night.</p>
<p>Musk’s and Trump’s comments came with Secretary of State Marco Rubio
out of the country, in Central America, on his first trip abroad in
office. Rubio has not spoken publicly about any plans to shut down
USAID.</p>
<p>The Trump administration and Rubio have imposed an unprecedented
freeze on foreign assistance that has shut down much of USAID’s aid
programs worldwide — compelling thousands of layoffs by aid
organizations — and ordered furloughs and leaves that have gutted the
agency’s leadership and staff in Washington..</p>
<p>Peter Marocco, a returning political appointee from Trump’s first
term, was a leader in enforcing the shutdown. USAID staffers say they
believe that agency outsiders with visitors’ badges asking questions of
employees inside the Washington headquarters are members of Musk’s DOGE
team.</p>
<p>Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren said in a post on Sunday that Trump
was allowing Musk to access people’s personal information and shut down
government funding.</p>
<p>“We must do everything in our power to push back and protect people
from harm,” the Massachusetts senator said, without giving details.</p>

proposes budget cut after US exit, defends its work</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>London — World Health Organization member states will discuss cutting
part of its budget by $400 million in light of President Trump’s move to
withdraw the United States, its biggest government funder, from the
agency, a document released on Monday showed.</p>
<p>Opening the agency’s annual executive board meeting, WHO Director
General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also defended the agency’s work and
recent reforms and reiterated a call for the U.S. to reconsider its exit
and enter into dialog with the WHO about further change.</p>
<p>“We would welcome suggestions from the United States, and all member
states, for how we can serve you and the people of the world better,” he
said.</p>
<p>The budget cut will be discussed at the Feb. 3-11 Geneva meeting,
during which member state representatives will discuss the agency’s
funding and work for the 2026-2027 period.</p>
<p>The executive board proposes cutting the base programs section of the
budget from a proposed $5.3 billion to $4.9 billion, according to a
document released on Monday. That is part of the wider $7.5 billion
budget for 2026-2027 that was originally proposed, including money for
polio eradication and tackling emergencies.</p>
<p>“With the departure of the biggest financial contributor, the budget
could not be ‘business as usual,’” the document reads. The U.S. is the
WHO’s biggest government donor, contributing around 18% of its overall
funding. The WHO has already separately taken some cost-cutting steps
after the U.S. move.</p>
<p>However, some board representatives also wanted to send a message
that the WHO would preserve its strategic direction despite the
challenges, the document adds.</p>
<p>The $4.9 billion is roughly the same as the base program budget for
the previous period, 2024-2025.</p>
<p>Trump moved to exit the WHO on his first day in office two weeks ago.
The process will take one year under U.S. law.</p>

leaders to huddle on defense against Russia, economy, and US</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BRUSSELS — European Union leaders gather on Monday to discuss how to
bolster the continent’s defenses against Russia and how to handle U.S.
President Donald Trump after his decision to impose tariffs on goods
from Canada, Mexico and China.</p>
<p>At a royal palace-turned-conference center in Brussels, the leaders
of the EU’s 27 nations will also lunch with NATO Secretary General Mark
Rutte and dine with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.</p>
<p>Antonio Costa, the president of the European Council of EU leaders,
has billed the one-day gathering as a “retreat” devoted to defense
policy rather than a formal summit, aiming for an open discussion
without any official declaration or decisions.</p>
<p>The first session focuses on geopolitics and relations with the
United States, meaning Trump’s sweeping weekend move on tariffs is
certain to come up – particularly as EU officials fear they may soon
face similar measures.</p>
<p>Trump, who began his second term as president on Jan. 20, will also
be a major factor in the talks on defense, as he has demanded that
European nations spend much more on their own protection and rely less
on the United States via the NATO security alliance.</p>
<p>Trump’s call for EU member Denmark to cede Greenland to the United
States - and his refusal to rule out military action or economic
pressure to force Copenhagen’s hand - has also added strains to
trans-Atlantic ties.</p>
<p>The EU leaders are expected to discuss what military capabilities
they need in the coming years, how they could be funded and how they
might cooperate more through joint projects.</p>
<p>“Europe needs to assume greater responsibility for its own defense,”
Costa said in a letter to the leaders. “It needs to become more
resilient, more efficient, more autonomous and a more reliable security
and defense actor.”</p>
<p>Finding funding</p>
<p>The funding discussion will be especially tough, according to
diplomats, as many European countries have little room in their public
finances for big spending hikes.</p>
<p>Some countries, such as the Baltic states and France, advocate joint
EU borrowing to spend on defense. But Germany and the Netherlands are
staunchly opposed.</p>
<p>One compromise could be to borrow to finance loans rather than grants
for defense projects, according to some diplomats.</p>
<p>European countries have ramped up defense spending in recent years,
particularly since Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which brought war
to the EU’s borders.</p>
<p>But many EU leaders have said they will need to spend even more.
Trump has said NATO’s European members should spend 5% of GDP on defense
- a figure no member of the alliance including the United States
currently reaches.</p>
<p>Last year, EU countries spent an average of 1.9% of GDP on defense -
about $334.48 billion, according to EU estimates.</p>
<p>That is a 30% increase from 2021, according to the EU. But it also
masks wide divergences among EU countries.</p>
<p>Poland and the Baltic states are among the biggest defense spenders
in GDP terms, with Warsaw leading the pack at more than 4.1%, according
to NATO estimates. But some of the EU’s biggest economies such as Italy
and Spain spend much less - about 1.5% and 1.3% respectively.</p>

to meet with US Middle East envoy to open US visit</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to meet Monday with
U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff during a visit to Washington
focused on Israel’s ceasefire with Hamas and other regional issues.</p>
<p>Netanyahu’s office said he and Witkoff would discuss Israel’s
ceasefire positions.</p>
<p>The talks come as negotiations are expected to open this week on the
second phase of the ceasefire, with the two sides needing to agree on
matter such as the release of the remaining hostages held by Hamas and
an end to the conflict that began in October 2023.</p>
<p>Witkoff is due to follow his Netanyahu talks by speaking with
officials from Egypt and Qatar, the other two nations that have led the
ceasefire negotiations.</p>
<p>Netanyahu is scheduled to meet Tuesday with U.S. President Donald
Trump, and said those talks would include the war against Hamas,
countering Iranian aggression and expanding diplomatic relations with
Arab countries.</p>
<p>Trump has been a staunch supporter of Israel but also pledged to end
wars in the Middle East and took credit for helping to broker the
ceasefire agreement. </p>
<p>During the first phase of the ceasefire, which lasts six weeks, Hamas
has freed 18 hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners
held by Israel.</p>
<p>Hamas, a U.S. designated terror group, has quickly reasserted its
control over Gaza since the ceasefire took hold last month, despite
Israel saying it would not allow that to occur. The militants have said
they will not release more hostages slated to go free in the second
phase of the truce without an end to the war and the full withdrawal of
Israeli forces from the narrow territory along the shores of the
Mediterranean Sea. </p>
<p>Netanyahu is under mounting pressure from far-right governing
partners to resume the war after the first phase of the truce ends in
early March. </p>
<p>It’s not clear where Trump stands. </p>
<p>Netanyahu has said Israel is still committed to a full victory over
Hamas and the return of all the hostages captured in the militants’
shock Oct. 7, 2023, attack that killed 1,200 people and led to the
capture of 250 hostages. Several dozen remain in Hamas hands, both
living and dead. </p>
<p>Israel’s counteroffensive during 15 months of warfare has killed more
than 47,400 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children.
Israel’s military says the death toll includes 17,000 militants it has
killed. </p>
<p>Even with the ceasefire, periodic attacks are still occurring. </p>
<p>An Israeli airstrike on a vehicle in central Gaza wounded five people
on Sunday, including a child who was in critical condition, according to
Al-Awda Hospital, which received the casualties. The Israeli military
said it fired upon the vehicle because it was bypassing a checkpoint
while heading north in violation of the ceasefire agreement.</p>
<p>Trump brokered normalization agreements between Israel and four Arab
countries in his first term. He now is seeking a wider agreement in
which Israel would forge ties with Saudi Arabia. </p>
<p>But Riyadh has said it would only agree to such a deal if the war in
Gaza ends and there is a credible pathway to a Palestinian state in
Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories Israel captured in
the 1967 Middle East war. </p>
<p>The U.S. supports Palestinian statehood, but Netanyahu’s government
is opposed. </p>
<p>Even as the Gaza ceasefire has mostly held for two weeks, Israel has
ramped up operations in the occupied West Bank. On Sunday, the military
said it was expanding an operation focused on the volatile city of
Jenin, to the town of Tamun. </p>
<p>The West Bank has seen a surge in violence since the start of the war
in Gaza, with Israel launching near-daily military arrest raids. There
has also been a rise in settler violence against Palestinians and
Palestinian attacks on Israelis. </p>

Reuter</p>

id="trump-to-speak-with-canadian-mexican-leaders-after-imposing-new-tariffs">Trump
to speak with Canadian, Mexican leaders after imposing new tariffs</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump said he planned to speak Monday with the
leaders of Canada and Mexico, days after announcing tariffs on goods
from those countries and China that have were met with pledges of
retaliatory tariffs and other actions.</p>
<p>The new tariffs affect the top three U.S. trading partners, but Trump
said the move would be “worth the price” to bolster U.S. interests.</p>
<p>Despite a free-trade pact he negotiated with Canada and Mexico in his
first term in office, Trump on Saturday imposed 25% tariffs on the two
countries set to take effect Tuesday, and hit China with a new 10% levy
in addition to already enacted tariffs. </p>
<p>Trump claimed the three countries were not doing enough to halt
illegal immigration and the deadly opioid fentanyl from entering the
United States. </p>
<p>In Truth Social posts early Sunday, Trump acknowledged American
consumers could face higher prices because of the tariffs.</p>
<p>U.S. companies that pay the tariffs to the federal government to
import goods from other countries then often pass on at least part, if
not all, of their higher costs to consumers rather than absorb their
extra expenses themselves. </p>
<p>Trump aimed most of his comments at Canada, targeting one of the
closest U.S. allies. The U.S. Census Bureau said the U.S. had a $55
billion trade deficit with Canada last year. </p>
<p>“Why? There is no reason,” Trump contended. “We don’t need anything
they have. We have unlimited Energy, should make our own Cars, and have
more Lumber than we can ever use.” </p>
<p>“Without this massive subsidy, Canada ceases to exist as a viable
Country. Harsh but true! Therefore, Canada should become our Cherished
51st State. Much lower taxes, and far better military protection for the
people of Canada — AND NO TARIFFS!” Trump said. </p>
<p>He said, “Canada, Mexico, China, and too many others to name,
continue the decades long RIPOFF OF AMERICA, both with regard to TRADE,
CRIME, AND POISONOUS DRUGS that are allowed to so freely flow into
AMERICA. THOSE DAYS ARE OVER!” </p>
<p>With the new tariffs, Trump said, “Will there be some pain? Yes,
maybe (and maybe not!) But we will Make America Great Again, and it will
all be worth the price that must be paid.” </p>
<p>Trump aides had previously shied from acknowledging that tariffs
could raise U.S. consumer prices. Nationwide polls in the U.S. showed
that consumer frustration over rising prices during the last four years
were a major factor in his November election victory over Democrat
Kamala Harris. </p>
<p>Trump has since acknowledged that it will not be easy to curb higher
grocery prices. Trump put the new tariff on energy imports from Canada
at 10%, apparently seeking to limit an increase in fuel and electricity
prices. </p>
<p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Saturday that his country
would hit back with 25% percent levies of its own on select American
goods worth $106.6 billion, with a first round on Tuesday followed by a
second one in three weeks. </p>
<p>Leaders of several Canadian provinces have already announced
retaliatory actions as well, such as the immediate halt of U.S. liquor
purchases, and more specifically, orange juice produced in the U.S.
state of Florida, whiskey in Tennessee and peanut butter in Kentucky,
three states Trump won in last November’s election and all represented
by Republicans, like Trump, in the U.S. Senate. </p>
<p>Kirsten Hillman, the Canadian ambassador to the U.S., told ABC’s
“This Week” show, “We’re really disappointed” and “perplexed” by Trump’s
actions and said she hoped that Trump would back off before Tuesday. But
she acknowledged that “it’s really in the president’s hands” whether
that happens. </p>
<p>She said that “less than 1% of illegal immigrants” entering the U.S.
travel across its northern border with Canada. She said Canada has
invested “in a lot of equipment” to curb unauthorized border crossings
and conducted joint exercises with the U.S. to catch migrants. </p>
<p>“It’s hard to know what more we could do,” she said. “We’re not at
all interested in escalating” a trade war with the U.S., where she said
99% of the trade is currently tariff-free. “We’re eager to build on
that.” </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said she had directed
her economy minister to “implement Plan B,” which includes
yet-unspecified “tariff and non-tariff measures in defense of Mexico’s
interests,” without specifying what U.S. goods her government will
target.  </p>
<p>U.S. exports to Mexico totaled more than $322 billion in 2023, Census
Bureau data showed, while the U.S. imported more than $475 billion worth
of Mexican products. </p>
<p>Sheinbaum assailed Trump’s contention that her government had joined
forces with drug cartels, a claim he made in announcing the tariff
increases. </p>
<p>“We categorically reject the White House’s slanderous claim that the
Mexico government has alliances with criminal organizations, as well as
any attempt to intervene in our territory,” Sheinbaum wrote on X. “If
there is anywhere that such an alliance in fact exists, it is in the
United States gun factories that sell high-powered weapons to these
criminal groups.” </p>
<p>China denounced the new tariffs on its exports, with Beijing saying
it would challenge them at the World Trade Organization and take
unspecified “countermeasures.” The U.S. had a $279 billion trade deficit
with China in 2023, the largest figure for any of its trading
partners. </p>
<p>That response stopped short of the immediate escalation that had
marked China’s trade showdown with Trump during his first term as
president. </p>
<p>China’s commerce ministry said in a statement that Trump’s move
“seriously violates” international trade rules, urging the U.S. to
“engage in frank dialogue and strengthen cooperation.” </p>
<p>Trump also has often threatened new tariffs against the European
Union. A spokesperson for the bloc said Sunday that it would “respond
firmly to any trading partner that unfairly or arbitrarily imposes
tariffs.”</p>

id="beyoncé-wins-album-of-the-year-at-the-2025-grammys-for-cowboy-carter">Beyoncé
wins album of the year at the 2025 Grammys for ‘Cowboy Carter’</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — Beyoncé won album of the year for “Cowboy Carter” at
Sunday’s Grammys, delivering her — at last — the show’s elusive top
award.</p>
<p>The superstar, who is both the most awarded and nominated artist in
Grammys history, has been up for the category four times before and many
feel she has been snubbed by its top honors.</p>
<p>In winning album of the year with “Cowboy Carter,” Beyoncé has become
the first Black woman to win the top prize in the 21st century. The last
was Lauryn Hill with “The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill” 26 years ago.
Before her was Natalie Cole and Whitney Houston. That means Beyoncé is
only the fourth Black woman to win album of the year at the Grammys.</p>
<p>Members of the Los Angeles Fire Department presented Beyoncé with the
trophy, one of several times the show reflected the recent wildfires
that burned thousands of homes.</p>
<p>“It’s been many, many years,” Beyoncé said in her speech. “I want to
dedicate this to Ms. Martell,” she said, referencing Linda Martell, the
performer who became the first Black woman to play the Grand Ole
Opry.</p>
<p>“We finally saw it happen, everyone,” host Trevor Noah said, nodding
to the long overdue achievement for one of music’s transcendent
artists.</p>
<p>Kendrick Lamar won song and record of the year for his diss track
“Not Like Us,” taking home two of the night’s most prestigious
awards.</p>
<p>“We’re gonna dedicate this one to the city,” Lamar said before
shouting out Los Angeles area neighborhoods.</p>
<p>It is the second hip-hop single to ever win in the category. The
first was Childish Gambino’s “This Is America.”</p>
<p>The Weeknd mends fences, Chappell Roan challenges music industry</p>
<p>The Weeknd has mended his fractious relationship with the Grammy
Awards with a surprise performance of his new single, “Cry For Me” and
“Timeless” with Playboi Carti.</p>
<p>His decision is a direct reflection of the changes the Recording
Academy has made to diversify its voting body, CEO Harvey Mason jr. said
in his introduction. The Weeknd has been openly critical of the Grammys
organization, dating back to 2020 when he wrote on Twitter: “The Grammys
remain corrupt.”</p>
<p>It was just one of many pleasant surprises Sunday night. Chappell
Roan was named best new artist.</p>
<p>She read a speech from a notebook, speaking directly to major labels
and the music industry, instructing them to “offer a living wage and
healthcare, especially to developing artists.” She described getting
signed as a minor, getting dropped and entering the workforce during
COVID-19 with no work experience and no health care. She asked them to
treat artists like “valuable employees.”</p>
<p>“Labels, we got you,” she concluded her speech. “But do you got
us?”</p>
<p>Beyoncé and Chappell Roan give Grammys a country theme</p>
<p>In one of the biggest moments of the evening so far, Taylor Swift
presented the award for best country album to Beyoncé. She became the
first Black woman to ever win in the category.</p>
<p>“Genre is a cold word to keep us in our place as artists,” she said
in her speech. “I’m still in shock. Thank you so much for this
honor.”</p>
<p>Beyoncé entered the night as the leading nominee.</p>
<p>A little bit of the wild west, a little bit of West Hollywood. Roan
brought a rocking version of her “Pink Pony Club” to the Grammy stage.
Joined by a posse of dancing clown cowboys, she sang from atop a giant
pink horse.</p>
<p>Los Angeles on the mind</p>
<p>In incorporating the wildfires throughout the show, the Grammys put
the spotlight on the city’s resiliency.</p>
<p>Noah’s opening speech was dedicated to those affected by the fires,
promising a show that not only celebrates them, but one that also
celebrates “the city that brought us so much of that music.” The Grammys
have also allotted ad time to be used by local businesses affected by
the fires.</p>
<p>As the show neared its end, Noah announced that viewers had
contributed $7 million to relief efforts Sunday night so far.</p>
<p>On a stage set up to look like the mountains of Los Angeles, the LA
born-and-raised Billie Eilish and her brother/collaborator Finneas
performed her hit “Birds of a Feather.” It was one of a number of ways
the show seeks to salute the city. “We love you LA,” she told the crowd
at the end of the set.</p>
<p>The show kicked off with a powerful opening performance of Randy
Newman’s “I Love L.A.” by Dawes — whose members were directly affected
by the Eaton fire — backed by John Legend, Brad Paisley, Sheryl Crow,
Brittany Howard and St. Vincent.</p>
<p>Star studded performances and victories</p>
<p>The first televised award went to Doechii for best rap album for
“Alligator Bites Never Heal.”</p>
<p>The tears were immediate. “This category was introduced in 1989. Two
women have won, Lauryn Hill —” she said, correcting herself. “Three
women have won. Lauryn Hill, Cardi B and Doechii.”</p>
<p>Will Smith introduced a tribute to the late, great, legendary
producer Quincy Jones. “In his 91 years, Q touched countless lives, but
I have to say he changed mine forever,” he said. “You probably wouldn’t
even know who Will Smith was without Quincy Jones.”</p>
<p>Jones died in November at age 91. Kicked off by Cynthia Erivo,
accompanied by Herbie Hancock on piano, the “Wicked” star sang Frank
Sinatra’s “Fly Me to the Moon.” Then came Lainey Wilson and Jacob
Collier with “Let the Good Times Roll,” followed by Stevie Wonder and
Hancock busting out “Bluesette” and “We Are The World.” For the latter,
they were joined by student singers from two schools that were lost in
the LA-area fires.</p>
<p>Then, Janelle Monae with an inspired rendition of “Don’t Stop ’Til
You Get Enough,” channeling Michael Jackson in a sparkly tuxedo and an
effortless moonwalk.</p>
<p>The Beatles’ “Now and Then,” which used AI technology, took home best
rock performance. Sean Lennon accepted the award on behalf of his father
John Lennon. “As far as I’m concerned, it’s the best band of all time,”
he said of the Beatles.</p>
<p>First time winners were abundant. They included Carpenter, Roan,
Doechii, Charli xcx, songwriter Amy Allen, Música Mexicana star Carin
León, French metal band Gojira and country folk artist Sierra
Ferrell.</p>
<p>The Red Hot Chili Peppers’ Anthony Kiedis and Chad Smith led the
crowd in a short singalong of their hit “Under the Bridge,” reminding
the crowd to “support their friends and neighbors as they rebuild their
lives,” said Kiedis. Then they presented the best pop vocal album award
to Carpenter for “Short n’ Sweet.”</p>
<p>“I really wasn’t expecting this,” she said. “This is, woo, my first
Grammy so I’m going to cry.” (She’s now won two, but the earlier award
was handed out a pre-telecast ceremony that many artists don’t attend.)
She also performed.</p>
<p>Winners use speeches to lift marginalized communities in tense
political climate</p>
<p>Shakira won Latin pop album for “Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran” and gave a
powerful, short speech. “I want to dedicate this award to all my
immigrant brothers and sisters in this country,” she said.</p>
<p>Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars teamed up for a cover of “California
Dreamin’.” Later, SZA presented them with the award for best pop
duo/group performance for “Die With A Smile.”</p>
<p>“Trans people are not invisible. … The queer community deserves to be
lifted up,” Gaga said in her speech.</p>
<p>Alicia Keys was awarded the Dr. Dre Global Impact Award “DEI is not a
threat, it’s a gift,” she said in her speech, referencing diversity,
equity and inclusion programs that have been scrapped recently by the
U.S. government and several major corporations.</p>

<h2
id="fbi-staff-ordered-to-reveal-their-roles-in-jan.-6-capitol-riot-probes-by-monday">FBI
staff ordered to reveal their roles in Jan. 6 Capitol riot probes by
Monday</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — FBI employees were ordered Sunday to answer a detailed
list of questions about any work they may have done on criminal cases
related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by supporters of
President Donald Trump, stoking fear among staff about a fresh round of
firings at the law enforcement agency.</p>
<p>“I know myself and others receiving this questionnaire have a lot of
questions and concerns, which I am working hard to get answers to,” Chad
Yarbrough, the assistant director of the Criminal Investigative Division
at FBI headquarters, wrote in a weekend email seen by Reuters.</p>
<p>The list of questions in the memo, seen by Reuters, direct employees
to give their job title, any role they played in the Jan. 6
investigations and whether they helped supervise such investigations.
Yarbrough told employees the answers are due by 3 p.m. ET (2000 GMT) on
Monday</p>
<p>Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove on Friday fired eight senior
FBI officials from agency headquarters as well as the heads of the Miami
and Washington, D.C., field offices.</p>
<p>Another memo written by Bove on Friday also demanded that the FBI by
Tuesday at noon ET (1700 GMT) turn over to him a list of every employee
who worked on Jan. 6 cases, as well as a list of those who worked on a
criminal case filed last year against leaders of the militant Hamas
group in connection with the Gaza war.</p>
<p>Bove last week fired more than a dozen career Justice Department
prosecutors who worked on the two now-dismissed criminal cases brought
by Special Counsel Jack Smith against Trump, one involving actions taken
to try to overturn the 2020 election results and the other involving
classified government documents.</p>
<p>A FBI spokesperson declined to comment on the questionnaire.</p>
<p>Democrats and other critics have said Trump’s team is carrying out a
purge of FBI and Justice Department officials who played roles in the
criminal cases against Trump and the Jan. 6 rioters.</p>
<p>On Trump’s first day back in office on Jan. 20, he commuted the
sentences of 14 people in connection with the Capitol attack and
pardoned the rest — including those who violently attacked law
enforcement officers.</p>
<p>Acting FBI Director Brian Driscoll, in an email Friday to staff
announcing details about the order from Bove, said the request
“encompasses thousands of employees across the country who have
supported these investigative efforts.”</p>
<p>“I am one of those employees, as is acting Deputy Director [Robert]
Kissane,” Driscoll noted.</p>
<p>Despite reports about other firings throughout the bureau, emails
seen by Reuters from both the FBI Agents Association and from James
Dennehy, the assistant FBI director in charge of the New York office,
made it clear that no one else had been asked to resign.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, some employees started to clear out their desks Friday
amid concerns they might be next, according to the FBI Agents
Association email seen by Reuters.</p>
<p>“Today, we find ourselves in the middle of a battle of our own, as
good people are being walked out of the FBI and others are being
targeted because they did their jobs in accordance with the law and FBI
policy,” Dennehy wrote Friday, saying he gave credit to Driscoll and
Kissane for “fighting for this organization.”</p>
<p>Dennehy added that other than the select group of people named in
Bove’s memo, “NO ONE has been told they are being removed at this
time.”</p>

<h2 id="late-president-jimmy-carter-wins-posthumous-grammy">Late
President Jimmy Carter wins posthumous Grammy</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Los Angeles — Former President Jimmy Carter has won a posthumous
Grammy award. </p>
<p>Carter, the peanut farmer who won the presidency in the wake of the
Watergate scandal and Vietnam War, died in December at age 100. Prior to
his passing, Carter was nominated in the audio book, narration, and
storytelling recording category at the 2025 Grammys for “Last Sundays in
Plains: A Centennial Celebration,” recordings from his final Sunday
School lessons delivered at Maranatha Baptist Church in Georgia.
Musicians Darius Rucker, Lee Ann Rimes and Jon Batiste are featured on
the record. </p>
<p>It’s Carter’s fourth Grammy. His posthumous Grammy joins his three
previous ones for spoken word album. </p>
<p>If the former president won before his death, he would’ve become the
oldest Grammy award winner in history. </p>
<p>Jason Carter, Jimmy Carter’s grandson, received the award on his
behalf. “Having his words captured in this way for my family and for the
world is truly remarkable,” he said in an acceptance speech. “Thank you
to the academy.” </p>
<p>In the category, Jimmy Carter beat out Barbra Streisand, George
Clinton, Dolly Parton and producer Guy Oldfield. </p>
<p>If Streisand had won instead of Carter, it would have been her first
Grammy win in 38 years. </p>
<p>Currently, the oldest person to win a Grammy was 97-year-old Pinetop
Perkins in 2011.</p>

Los Angeles wildfires clean-up, residents furious over hazardous
waste</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Duarte, California — Not far from where Ceci Carroll lives, a
rock-mining company has polluted the air with dust across the San
Gabriel Valley, she said. </p>
<p>Now, as crews clean charred remains from the Los Angeles wildfires,
she worries about a new potential source of contamination: a site to
process hazardous debris from the Eaton Fire. </p>
<p>“I’m concerned about the community and also the school districts
here, where we have children,” said Carroll, a Duarte resident of 23
years and former local school board member. </p>
<p>“We’re dealing with the site with the chemicals and hazardous
materials,” she said. “Parents are absolutely concerned.” </p>
<p>Carroll is among residents from Duarte, Azusa and nearby cities
opposing the Environmental Protection Agency’s use of Lario Park in
Irwindale as a temporary site to separate, package and transport
potentially hazardous materials from the Eaton Fire. </p>
<p>In ordinary times, people picnic, bike or ride horses on equestrian
trails in the federally owned land. They now worry about dangerous waste
that could pollute the air or seep into groundwater. </p>
<p>The blazes that began on Jan. 7 charred thousands of buildings, cars
and electronics across the Los Angeles area. The EPA has begun the
enormous task of removing potentially hundreds of tons of hazardous
materials from the Eaton and Palisades fires. That includes paints,
pesticides, solvents, compressed gas cylinders, ammunition and
lithium-ion batteries from electric cars that could turn toxic when
burned. </p>
<p>“The removal of these materials should not come at the cost of
creating a toxic environment for communities already disproportionately
impacted by pollution,” Los Angeles County Supervisor Hilda Solis said
in a statement. </p>
<p>The mostly Latino communities adjacent to the site are exposed to
higher levels of ozone and particulate matter pollution than other
areas, according to data from the California Office of Environmental
Health Hazard Assessment. </p>
<p>Experts acknowledge residents’ concerns, but say hazardous waste is
not necessarily harmful as long as safety measures are in place and the
waste is not stored on site for years. </p>
<p>Residents have questions about waste site </p>
<p>At a town hall Wednesday, California Sen. Susan Rubio and local
mayors opposing the site grilled state and federal officials: How was
the site chosen? Why weren’t we consulted or notified? Why truck toxic
waste 24 kilometers from the burn zone and risk contaminating our
communities? What testing will be done after it’s closed? </p>
<p>Hundreds of residents crammed into the performing arts center and
spilled into the hall. They shouted “Shut it down!” and chanted “Leave
it in Altadena!” </p>
<p>EPA coordinator Tara Fitzgerald told the audience that sites closer
to the Eaton burn zone were being used for emergency fire operations,
including the Rose Bowl and the Santa Anita Park in Pasadena. They chose
the Lario Park site because it suited their needs and was
available. </p>
<p>She emphasized that the EPA has done this work for years across the
state. </p>
<p>“We did the exact same thing” for the Woolsey, Santa Rosa and Napa
fires, Fitzgerald said, and “we did not have any impacts to the
community during the entire process.” </p>
<p>But the Eaton and Palisades fires are unprecedented. Together, they
torched the largest urban area on record in California, according to an
Associated Press analysis, and more than double the urban acreage
consumed by the 2018 Woolsey Fire. </p>
<p>EPA says protective measures being taken </p>
<p>The EPA said it would regularly monitor air, sample soil, use water
trucks to control dust and transport waste out of the area daily. </p>
<p>The agency lines areas with plastic where materials are processed and
uses wattles, earthen berms and other items to control spills. The waste
will be transported on surface streets, not freeways, so trucks can
travel at a slower and safer speed, the EPA’s Celeste McCoy told the
county Board of Supervisors. She said the site would likely be used less
than six months, and more areas are being considered. </p>
<p>With these protective measures, the risks of groundwater
contamination, which takes a long time, are low, said Sanjay Mohanty, a
UCLA associate professor who has studied wildfire effects on water and
soil. </p>
<p>“There’s several feet of soil that the pollutant has to pass through,
and that also requires lots of water to leech from the system,” Mohanty
said. “And even if there is leeching, they would not migrate far into
the soil in a short time.” </p>
<p>The bigger risks are soil and air pollution from possible dust
emissions, he added, but those too can be mitigated. </p>
<p>Residents should stay vigilant </p>
<p>Duarte resident Laura Jasso did not leave the meeting reassured and
remained upset about the lack of transparency from state and federal
officials. </p>
<p>“It’s hard to have confidence when they’ve really done this behind
our backs,” she said. </p>
<p>While crews continue their work, residents should be vigilant to what
is happening at the site and ask how materials are being handled, about
emergency response plans and truck routes and schedules, said Rachael
Jones, professor and director of the UCLA Center for Occupational and
Environmental Health. </p>
<p>“The community has the right to know that information from the EPA
and the Army Corps,” Jones said. </p>
<p>Jasso said her community is committed to holding the EPA accountable
for ensuring safety. </p>
<p>“Ultimately, we don’t want it here, and we’re going to continue to
fight to not have it here,” she said of the site. “But the fact is, it’s
here right now. And so, we have to just acknowledge the safety of our
students, the concerns of our families.”</p>

recalls baby teething sticks over possible choking hazard</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Arlington, Virginia — A baby food maker is recalling edible sticks
meant to ease teething pain over a possible choking hazard. </p>
<p>Gerber announced Friday that it was recalling and discontinuing its
brand of “Sooth N Chew” teething sticks after receiving customer
complaints about choking. The company said one emergency room visit had
been reported. </p>
<p>The teething sticks are edible teethers marketed to parents and
guardians of children six months and older. They come in
strawberry-apple and banana flavors. </p>
<p>Gerber said it was working with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
on the recall. </p>
<p>Customers who bought the teething sticks should return them to stores
where they were purchased for a refund, the company said. </p>
<p>Anyone concerned about an injury or illness should contact a health
care provider. For any additional support needed, Gerber is available
24/7 at 1-800-4-GERBER (1-800-443-7237). </p>
<p>The company says it is working with the U.S. FDA on this recall and
will cooperate with them fully.</p>

<h2 id="new-orleans-super-bowl-gets-beefed-up-security-measures">New
Orleans Super Bowl gets beefed up security measures</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New Orleans, Louisiana — After a New Year’s Day attack struck at the
heart of the French Quarter, officials in New Orleans say they are
confident in the security plans they have in place for the Super
Bowl.</p>
<p>Upwards of 125,000 visitors are expected to converge on the Big Easy
beginning Feb. 5 for parties, concerts and revelry featuring artists
including Post Malone and Diplo and capped off by the Feb. 9 clash
between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles at the
Caesars Superdome stadium to crown this season’s NFL champion.</p>
<p>Following the truck-ramming attack early on Jan. 1 that killed 14
people and injured dozens more along Bourbon Street, one of the city’s
most famous thoroughfares, alleged security lapses triggered multiple
lawsuits and investigations. But the city, the NFL and law enforcement
officials insist that after more than a year of preparations they are
ready to play host.</p>
<p>“We’re going above and beyond what we’ve seen in the past when we’ve
hosted previously,” Mayor LaToya Cantrell said at a news conference. “We
know we’re safer than we’ve ever been before.”</p>
<p>What will the security presence look like?</p>
<p>Thousands of state, federal and local law enforcement officers will
be on the ground during the Super Bowl, NFL Chief Security Officer Cathy
Lanier said. But she and city officials remained tight-lipped about
details.</p>
<p>Drones will be prohibited around the Superdome and downtown New
Orleans throughout the week of the game and there will be flight
restrictions up to 18,000 feet (5,486 meters), according to the Federal
Aviation Administration.</p>
<p>Armed federal air marshals will be stationed around the city’s
transportation hubs scanning for suspicious people or activities and
guarding against drones, said Noel Curtin, supervisory air marshal in
charge with the Transportation Security Administration.</p>
<p>Super Bowl events will sprawl across neighborhoods far beyond the
stadium, said the Homeland Security Department’s Eric DeLaune, who is
leading federal coordination of Super Bowl security.</p>
<p>Federal agencies from the FBI to the Secret Service are bringing in
rooftop snipers and BearCat armored SWAT vehicles around the stadium and
across the city’s historic French Quarter and downtown, DeLaune
said.</p>
<p>No one will be allowed inside the cordoned-off area surrounding the
Superdome without credentials, and the city already has begun shutting
down and limiting traffic on roads near the stadium, where the perimeter
will include blast barriers requiring trucks to pass through giant X-ray
machines typically used at border crossings, DeLaune said.</p>
<p>Dozens of technicians and more than 100 bomb-sniffing dogs are
engaging in a days-long effort to scour the 37,161 square meters
(400,000 square feet) of the Superdome and each of its more than 70,000
seats prior to game day, DeLaune said.</p>
<p>“They’re going to go from top to bottom on that building to make sure
it’s clear and it’s safe. They open every door, check under every seat,”
DeLaune said.</p>
<p>How the New Year’s Day attack has changed security plans</p>
<p>Multiple lawsuits have claimed city authorities were aware of Bourbon
Street’s vulnerabilities to the kind of truck-ramming attack that the
Islamic State group-inspired Shamsud-Din Jabbar carried out. He drove
his F-150 around a police car parked as a makeshift barricade and plowed
into pedestrians before he crashed and was killed by police.</p>
<p>The bollard system of steel columns installed to block vehicle
traffic, which was being replaced at the entrance to Bourbon Street at
the time of the attack, remains on track for completion before the Super
Bowl, officials said.</p>
<p>Authorities say they have brought in more types of physical barriers
to protect entry points resulting from concerns that the new bollard
system was not strong enough to block vehicle attacks.</p>
<p>The NFL and federal and city agencies have “put a fresh set of eyes”
on their plans post-Jan. 1, DeLaune said, noting the New Orleans Police
Department hired former New York City Police Commissioner William
Bratton and his team from high-profile security firm Teneo.</p>
<p>“No specific or credible threats” have surfaced targeting the Super
Bowl, NFL security chief Lanier said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry announced the creation of an “enhanced
security zone” along Bourbon Street to bookend Super Bowl weekend and
said he would deploy 350 national guardsmen.</p>
<p>After authorities found Jabbar had planted ice chests containing
undetonated improvised explosive devices around the French Quarter,
Landry declared a ban on coolers and ice chests in these areas and
ordered mandatory searches of bags for anyone entering Bourbon Street
zone during the Super Bowl weekend.</p>
<p>But in accordance with state law, firearms including permitless
concealed carry guns will be allowed on Bourbon Street, Louisiana State
Police Sgt. Katharine Stegall said, noting they remained banned from
bars.</p>
<p>AI and mobile apps will play security role</p>
<p>The Superdome’s owner, ASM Global, has contracted New York-based
artificial intelligence firm Dataminr to monitor potential and emerging
threats in real time.</p>
<p>The company will draw from over 1 million sources of public data
across 150 languages, from social media to dark web forums to traffic
cameras, Dataminr Chief Security Officer Robert Crowley said.  </p>
<p>“It’s stitching together all these little pieces of the puzzle to get
a holistic, comprehensive view of what has just happened,” Crowley said.
“The faster you know what is occurring, the quicker you can take better
action.”</p>

<h2
id="of-67-victims-of-air-disaster-near-washington-recovered-and-identified-officials-say">55
of 67 victims of air disaster near Washington recovered and identified,
officials say</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Authorities said Sunday they have recovered the remains of 55 of the
67 people killed in the deadliest U.S. air disaster since 2001.</p>
<p>Washington, DC Fire and EMS Chief John Donnelly said at a news
conference that divers still need to find the bodies of 12 more victims
and are committed to the dignified recovery of remains as they prepare
to lift wreckage from the Potomac River as early as Monday morning.</p>
<p>“Reuniting those lost in this tragic incident is really what keeps us
all going,” said Colonel Francis B. Pera of the Army Corps of Engineers.
Portions of the aircraft will be loaded onto flatbed trucks and taken to
a hangar for further investigation.</p>
<p>They spoke hours after families of the victims visited the crash site
just outside Washington, DC, walking along the banks of the Potomac
River near Reagan National Airport to memorialize their loved ones.</p>
<p>Dozens of people arrived in buses with a police escort close to where
an American Airlines jet and an Army Black Hawk helicopter collided
Wednesday, killing all 67 aboard the two aircraft. Federal investigators
were working to piece together the events that led to the crash while
recovery crews were set to pull more wreckage from the chilly water.</p>
<p>Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy on Sunday said he wanted to leave
federal aviation investigators space to conduct their inquiry.</p>
<p>But he posed a range of questions about the crash while appearing on
morning TV news programs.</p>
<p>“What was happening inside the towers? Were they understaffed? … The
position of the Black Hawk, the elevation of the Black Hawk, were the
pilots of the Black Hawk wearing night vision goggles?” Duffy asked on
CNN.</p>
<p>The American Airlines flight with 64 people on board was preparing to
land from Wichita, Kansas. The Army Black Hawk helicopter was on a
training mission and had three soldiers on board. Both aircraft plunged
into the Potomac River after colliding.</p>
<p>The plane’s passengers included figure skaters returning from the
2025 U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Wichita, Kansas, and a group
of hunters returning from a guided trip.</p>
<p>Army Staff Sgt. Ryan Austin O’Hara, 28, of Lilburn, Georgia; Chief
Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Loyd Eaves, 39, of Great Mills, Maryland; and
Cpt. Rebecca M. Lobach, of Durham, North Carolina, were killed in the
helicopter.</p>
<p>The National Transportation Safety Board said Saturday that
preliminary data showed conflicting readings about the altitudes of the
airliner and the Army helicopter.</p>
<p>Investigators also said that about a second before impact, the jet’s
flight recorder showed a change in its pitch. But they did not say
whether that change in angle meant that pilots were trying to perform an
evasive maneuver to avoid the crash.</p>
<p>Data from the jet’s flight recorder showed its altitude as 99 meters,
plus or minus 7.6 meters, when the crash happened Wednesday night, NTSB
officials told reporters. Data in the control tower, though, showed the
Black Hawk 61 meters, the maximum allowed altitude for helicopters in
the area.</p>
<p>The discrepancy has yet to be explained.</p>
<p>Investigators said they hoped to reconcile the difference with data
from the helicopter’s black box, which is taking more time to retrieve
because it became waterlogged after the Black Hawk plunged into the
Potomac. They also said they plan to refine the tower data, which can be
less reliable.</p>
<p>“That’s what our job is, to figure that out,” NTSB member Todd Inman
said.</p>
<p>“This is a complex investigation,” investigator in charge Brice
Banning said. “There are a lot of pieces here. Our team is working hard
to gather this data.”</p>
<p>Banning said the jet’s cockpit voice recorder captured sound moments
before the crash.</p>
<p>“The crew had a verbal reaction,” Banning said, and the flight data
recorder showed “the airplane beginning to increase its pitch. Sounds of
impact were audible about one second later, followed by the end of the
recording.”</p>
<p>Full NTSB investigations typically take at least a year, though
investigators hope to have a preliminary report within 30 days.</p>
<p>Inman said he has spent hours meeting with victims’ families since
the crash. The families are struggling, Inman said.</p>
<p>“Some wanted to give us hugs. Some are just mad and angry,” Inman
said. “They are just all hurt. And they still want answers, and we want
to give them answers.”</p>
<p>More than 300 responders were taking part in the recovery effort at a
given time, officials said. Two Navy salvage barges were also deployed
to lift heavy wreckage.</p>
<p>On Fox News Sunday, Duffy said the Federal Aviation Administration
was looking into staffing in the Reagan Airport control tower.</p>
<p>Investigators said there were five controllers on duty at the time of
the crash: a local controller, ground controller, assistant controller,
a supervisor and supervisor in training.</p>
<p>According to an FAA report obtained by The Associated Press, one
controller was responsible for helicopter and plane traffic. Those
duties are often divided between two people but the airport typically
combines them at 9:30 p.m., once traffic slows down. On Wednesday, the
tower supervisor combined them earlier, which the report called “not
normal.”</p>
<p>“Staffing shortages for air traffic control has been a major problem
for years and years,” Duffy said, promising that President Donald
Trump’s administration would address shortages with “bright, smart,
brilliant people in towers controlling airspace.”</p>
<p>With the nation already grieving, an air ambulance crashed in
Philadelphia on Friday, killing all six people on board, including a
child returning home to Mexico from treatment, and at least one person
on the ground.</p>
<p>Also Friday, the FAA heavily restricted helicopter traffic around
Reagan National, hours after Trump claimed on social media that the Army
helicopter had been flying higher than allowed.</p>
<p>“It was far above the 200-foot limit. That’s not really too
complicated to understand, is it???” Trump wrote on Truth Social.</p>
<p>Wednesday’s crash was the deadliest in the U.S. since Nov. 12, 2001,
when a jet slammed into a residential neighborhood in the New York City
borough of Queens, just after takeoff from Kennedy Airport. The crash
killed all 260 people on board and five people on the ground.</p>
<p>Experts regularly highlight that plane travel is overwhelmingly safe,
but the crowded airspace around Reagan National can challenge even the
most experienced pilots.</p>

USAID staff ousted as Trump administration dismantles aid agency</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The Trump administration removed two top security
officials at the U.S. Agency for International Development during the
weekend after they tried to stop representatives from billionaire Elon
Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) from gaining access to
restricted parts of the building, three sources said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The action added to the dozens of staff at USAID being removed from
their positions, as President Donald Trump’s team moves to abolish the
agency’s independence and possibly bring it under the control of the
State Department.</p>
<p>Nearly 30 career staff in the agency’s Legislative and Public Affairs
bureau lost access overnight to their emails, at least five sources
said, bringing the total number of senior USAID career staff who have
been put on leave over the past week close to 100.</p>
<p>“DOGE did access the building yesterday,” a senior Senate Democratic
aide said, requesting anonymity to discuss the incident. USAID security
officers tried to turn away DOGE personnel without security
clearances.</p>
<p>“They (security personnel) were threatened with action by the federal
Marshals Service,” the aide said. Following the incident, the director
of USAID security John Voorhees and his deputy were removed from their
positions and put on leave, sources said.</p>
<p>The purge follows more than a week of changes inside USAID,
Washington’s primary agency funding billions of dollars’ worth of
life-saving aid globally. Trump ordered a freeze on almost all U.S.
foreign aid, saying his administration will review spending to ensure
money is distributed in line with his “America First” foreign
policy.</p>
<p>Members of the group from DOGE were allowed to access several secure
spaces, including the office of security and the agency’s executive
secretariat.</p>
<p>There was no record of what information DOGE officials were able to
obtain in those areas, but the offices they accessed included classified
files and personal information about Americans who work at USAID, the
sources said.</p>
<p>Katie Miller, a DOGE spokesperson, said on social media platform X
that no classified material was accessed without proper security
clearances.</p>
<p>Matt Hopson, who was appointed as chief of staff by the Trump
administration, has resigned, five sources familiar with the matter
said. A congressional source said his resignation followed the incident
with DOGE officials. USAID did not respond to a request about
Hopson.</p>
<p>CNN was first to report the incident between USAID and DOGE
officials.</p>
<p>Legal battle looms</p>
<p>Congressional Democrats said the changes appeared to violate U.S.
laws establishing USAID and funding it as a separate agency. Two senior
Senate Democratic aides said lawmakers and staff had been meeting on
Sunday and would meet again on Monday to consider further steps,
including legal action.</p>
<p>Senior Democratic members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
including its chair Jeanne Shaheen, on Sunday sent a letter to U.S.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio seeking an explanation over the incident.
Shaheen said that she was working to gather Democrats and Republicans to
ask for answers.</p>
<p>The global freeze on most of U.S. foreign aid is already sending
shockwaves around the world. Field hospitals in Thai refugee camps,
landmine clearance in war zones, and drugs to treat millions suffering
from diseases such as HIV are among the programs at risk of
elimination.</p>
<p>U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Brian Mast on Sunday said
that he would support moving USAID under the State Department and that
there needs to be “more command and control.’</p>
<p>Asked on CBS’ “Face the Nation” if congressional approval was needed
or whether Trump could act unilaterally, Mast did not answer. The
“purging of people throughout the State Department, other agencies” and
freezing aid were “all very important and necessary steps to make sure
that we secure America,” he said.</p>
<p>The State Department and USAID did not respond to requests for
comment.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, billionaire Trump ally Musk on Sunday continued to slam
USAID in his posts and reposts on his X social network. Trump has
assigned Musk to lead a federal cost-cutting panel with broad oversight
powers. Officials from DOGE have made frequent visits to USAID
headquarters in Washington, according to sources familiar with the
matter.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Musk accused USAID of being “a criminal organization”
without providing any evidence and added “Time for it to die”.</p>
<p>Peter Marocco was appointed as head of the Office of Foreign
Assistance at the State Department and is leading the agency’s sweeping
changes, according to three sources familiar with the matter. Marocco
previously served in Trump’s first administration in the Department of
Defense. The State Department did not respond to questions about
Marocco.</p>
<p>USAID’s website has been down since Saturday afternoon, a sign that
the end is near for the agency, whose funding goes to programs on
everything from women’s health in conflict zones to access to clean
water, HIV/AIDS treatments, energy security and anti-corruption
work.</p>

Uzbek: US-Uzbekistan military relationship solid, officials say</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>At a Washington event marking Uzbekistan’s 33rd Armed Forces Day,
held at Uzbekistan’s Embassy, Uzbek and U.S. officials — both civilian
and military — recognized each other for fostering a strong relationship
and maintaining close cooperation in defense and security, particularly
in areas such as Afghanistan and regional stability.</p>
<p>Most of the American planes and helicopters flown to Uzbekistan by
Afghan pilots who fled the Taliban in August 2021 were later donated to
the country. Seven of the assets the Pentagon deemed suitable, including
Black Hawk helicopters, have now been returned to the United States,
officials confirmed.</p>

id="in-us-punxsutawney-phil-sees-his-shadow-predicting-6-more-weeks-of-wintry-weather">In
US, Punxsutawney Phil sees his shadow, predicting 6 more weeks of wintry
weather</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PUNXSUTAWNEY, Pa. — U.S. groundhog Punxsutawney Phil saw his shadow
Sunday and predicted six more weeks of wintry weather, his top-hatted
handlers announced to a raucous, record-sized crowd at Gobbler’s Knob in
Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Phil was welcomed with chants of “Phil, Phil, Phil,” and pulled from
a hatch on his tree stump shortly after sunrise before a member of the
Punxsutawney Groundhog Club read from a scroll in which he boasted:
“Only I know — you can’t trust A.I.”</p>
<p>The woodchuck’s weather forecast is an annual ritual that goes back
more than a century in western Pennsylvania, with far older roots in
European folklore, but it took Bill Murray’s 1993 “Groundhog Day” movie
to transform the event into what it is today, with tens of thousands of
revelers at the scene and imitators scattered around the United States
and beyond.</p>
<p>When Phil is deemed to have not seen his shadow, that is said to
usher in an early spring. When he does see it, there will be six more
weeks of winter.</p>
<p>The crowd was treated to a fireworks show, confetti and live music
that ranged from the Ramones to “Pennsylvania Polka” as they awaited
sunrise and Phil’s emergence. Gov. Josh Shapiro, local and state elected
officials and a pair of pageant winners were among the dignitaries at
the scene.</p>
<p>Self-employed New York gingerbread artist Jon Lovitch has attended
the event for 33 years. “I like the cold, you know, and this is probably
the best and biggest midwinter party in the entire world,” Lovitch said
in Punxsutawney. “And it’s just a really good time.”</p>
<p>Phil has predicted a longer winter far more often than an early
spring, and one effort to track his accuracy concluded he was right less
than half the time. What six more weeks of winter means is
subjective.</p>
<p>Tom Dunkel, president of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club, says there
are two types of people who make the trek to Gobbler’s Knob: the
faithful seeking to validate their beliefs and the doubters who want to
confirm their skepticism.</p>
<p>Phil communicated his forecast to Dunkel through “Groundhog-ese” with
the help of a special cane that Dunkel has inherited as the club’s
leader. It’s not as if he speaks in English words. “He’ll like wink,
he’ll purr, he’ll chatter, he’ll — you know — nod,” Dunkel said.</p>
<p>Attendance is free but it cost $5 to take a bus and avoid a 1.6
kilometer trek from the middle of town to the stage where the prediction
was made, some 123 kilometers northeast of Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>The need for so many buses is why the local schools, where the sports
mascot is the Chucks, close when Groundhog Day falls on a weekday.</p>
<p>Keith Post, his wife and a friend have watched the “Groundhog Day”
movie in each of the past five years and decided this was the time to
make the trip from Ohio to witness the event.</p>
<p>“We booked rooms almost a year in advance and we’re here,” Post said.
“We’re doing it.”</p>
<p>A new welcome center opened four years ago and the club is working on
an elaborate second living space for Phil and family so they can split
time between Gobbler’s Knob and Phil’s longtime home at the town
library. The club also put up large video screens and more powerful
speakers this year to help attendees in the back of the crowd follow the
proceedings.</p>
<p>“It’s a holiday where you don’t really owe anyone anything,” said
A.J. Dereume, who among the club’s 15-member inner circle serves as
Phil’s handler and held him up to loud cheers on Sunday. “You’re
grasping onto the belief, you know, in something that’s just fun to
believe in.”</p>
<p>Jackie Handley agreed a year ago to visit Punxsutawney for the first
time to help a friend check off an item on their bucket list. They were
ready for the subfreezing temperatures. “It’s once in a lifetime — we’re
probably not going to come back. And we have tons of warm clothes,” said
Handley, who lives in Falls Church, Virginia. After the forecast was
made, club members and Phil posed for photos with people from the
crowd.</p>
<p>Phil has a wife, Punxsutawney Phyllis, and two pups born this spring,
Shadow and Sunny, although his family did not join him on stage for the
big event. The groundhog family eats fruits and vegetables, get daily
visits from Dereume and sees a veterinarian at least once a year. The
club’s lore is that Phil is the same woodchuck who has been issuing
weather forecasts for the past century, thanks to an “elixir of life”
that keeps him immortal. “There’s only one Phil, and it’s not something
that can be handed down,” Dunkel said. “Just like Santa Claus and the
Easter Bunny, there’s only one.”</p>
<p>Groundhog Day celebrations, formal and informal, were being held in
many Pennsylvania towns and elsewhere on Sunday. There have been
Groundhog Day events in at least 28 U.S. states and Canadian
provinces.</p>

id="beyonce-competes-for-the-big-prize---again---at-sundays-grammys">Beyonce
competes for the big prize - again - at Sunday’s Grammys</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — The Grammy Awards take center stage in Los Angeles on
Sunday at a celebration that will honor the best of music while
acknowledging the deadly wildfires that scarred a hub of the
industry. </p>
<p>Beyonce will compete for the top Grammy prize of album of the year
with her country record “Cowboy Carter.” The superstar singer has never
won the album trophy despite winning 32 career Grammys, more than any
other musician. </p>
<p>Also in the running for album of the year are megastar Taylor Swift
for “The Tortured Poets Department” and Billie Eilish for “Hit Me Hard
and Soft.” </p>
<p>The ceremony will be broadcast live on CBS starting at 8 p.m. ET
(0100 GMT on Monday) from the Crypto.com Arena in downtown Los Angeles.
Comedian Trevor Noah returns to host the telecast, which will be part
awards show, part fundraiser for musicians and others impacted by the
recent fires. Hundreds of people in the music business were among those
who lost homes in the disaster. </p>
<p>“It will be a little tricky to pull off, but I’m starting to think
they’re going to be able to do it,” said Paul Grein, awards editor at
music publication Billboard. With the fires under control, “people can
take a breather and express gratitude and relief that we made it through
that.” </p>
<p>Eilish and best new artist nominees Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter,
Benson Boone and Teddy Swims are among the night’s scheduled performers.
The show will feature a tribute to Quincy Jones, the prolific music
producer who died in November. </p>
<p>At last year’s Grammys, Beyonce’s husband and rapper Jay-Z argued
that voters had not given proper recognition to Black artists including
his wife. Grammy winners are chosen by the 13,000 singers, songwriters,
producers, engineers and others who make up the Recording Academy. </p>
<p>“I don’t want to embarrass this young lady, but she has more Grammys
than anyone and never won album of the year. So even by your own
metrics, that doesn’t work,” Jay-Z said on stage. </p>
<p>“Cowboy Carter” was viewed by experts and fans as a reclamation and
homage to an overlooked legacy of Black Americans within country music
and culture. It became the first album by a Black woman to land at No. 1
on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart when it was released last
spring. </p>
<p>The Beyonce album was snubbed, however, by voters for the Country
Music Awards in their nominations in September. </p>
<p>The “Cowboy Carter” nomination is Beyonce’s fifth entry in the album
of the year category. Swift has won the honor a record four times,
including last year for “Midnights.” </p>
<p>Beyonce leads all Grammy nominees this year with 11 nods, followed by
Eilish, Charli XCX, Kendrick Lamar and Post Malone with seven
nominations each. Swift landed six nominations and will present one of
the night’s awards. </p>
<p>Beyonce’s other Grammy nods include record and song of the year for
single “Texas Hold ’Em.” </p>
<p>Competitors for song of the year, an award for songwriters, are
Eilish for “Birds of a Feather,” Carpenter for “Please Please Please”
and Roan for “Good Luck, Babe!” </p>
<p>In record of the year, nominees include Carpenter’s “Espresso” and
Swift’s duet with Post Malone, “Fortnight.”</p>

help fellow creators who lost works, archives in L.A. fires</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — Anthony Obi never imagined the night of Jan. 7 would be
the last time he’d step inside his safe haven. </p>
<p>The Houston rapper, known professionally as Fat Tony, has lived in
the Altadena neighborhood for a year and says he and his neighbors were
prepared for heavy winds and perhaps a few days of power outages. </p>
<p>“I totally expected, you know, maybe my windows are going to get
damaged, and I’ll come back in, like, a day or two and just clean it
up,” said the rapper. </p>
<p>But residents like Obi woke up the following morning to news that
thousands of homes and entire neighborhoods had been burned to ash,
destroyed by flames that wiped out large areas of Pacific Palisades and
Altadena. Although the neighborhoods are on opposite ends of the county,
they are known hubs for many of the city’s creative community, housing
filmmakers, actors, musicians and artists of various mediums. </p>
<p>“L.A. is not just rich, famous people who have giant mansions that
were destroyed,” said visual artist Andrea Bowers, who is helping
artists recover. “So many members of our community lost everything. They
lost all their artworks and their archives - that’s irreplaceable, a
lifetime of labor and a lifetime of research.” </p>
<p>“A lot of my collectors lost their homes,” said figurative and
conceptual artist Salomon Huerta, who lost his Altadena home of three
years to the Eaton fire and worries the art scene in L.A. will downsize
as a result of the wildfire. “Before the fire, I was in talks with
certain collectors. And then, after the fire, they’re not in a good
place to talk. I’m hoping that there’s support so that the art scene can
still thrive. But it’s going to be tough.” </p>
<p>Obi and Huerta lost not only personal treasures, business
opportunities and homes but also vital equipment and professional
archives, adding to their emotional burden. </p>
<p>Huerta left behind slides and transparencies of past work that he had
planned to digitize for an upcoming book. </p>
<p>“Everything’s gone,” Obi said. “All of my stuff that is related to
Fat Tony music that was in that house is gone, and it was the motherlode
of it.” </p>
<p>Grief and Hope </p>
<p>Kathryn Andrews never imagined she’d experience another wildfire in
her lifetime. </p>
<p>The conceptual artist was forced to flee her Pacific Palisades
neighborhood as smoke drew near, the second time in four years she’s had
to escape a wildfire. </p>
<p>She lost her Juniper Hills property to the 2020 Bobcat fire, which
burned a large section of rural Los Angeles County. </p>
<p>“I’ve already experienced one home being burned. I think you have a
different focus after that. Maybe we become a little bit less attached
to material things. And we began looking at a bigger long-term picture,
thinking about, you know, how we live together in community, how we live
in relation to the land and how we can work together to solve this,” she
said. </p>
<p>Andrews is the co-founder of relief effort Grief and Hope, which aims
to support creatives financially as they enter the long road ahead and
was founded alongside a group of gallery directors, art professionals
and artists like Bowers, Ariel Pittman, Olivia Gauthier and Julia V.
Hendrickson. </p>
<p>“Our primary goal is getting people triage money for just whatever
the most emergent need is,” said Pittman. </p>
<p>The fundraising effort began shortly after the fires broke out with a
Go Fund Me seeking $500,000. They have now raised over $940,000 of their
new $1 million goal via The Brick, a nonprofit art space. As of Tuesday,
Grief and Hope had received more than 450 inquiries, and Pittman said
the funds would be evenly distributed to applicants. The deadline for
artists to submit a needs survey has concluded, but the relief effort
will continue fundraising until mid-March. </p>
<p>Grief and Hope also has five different groups of volunteers providing
peer-to-peer support, helping with medical needs, safety issues and
renter’s issues, and collecting survey data to better serve their
creative community. </p>
<p>“These are people who already have made very long-term commitments in
their work, including the five of us, towards building community and
building sustainability around artists and art workers in our city and
beyond,” said Pittman. </p>
<p>For Grief and Hope, creating a more sustainable future for artists
throughout the city begins with affordable studio spaces and
housing. </p>
<p>Long road ahead </p>
<p>For photographer Joy Wong, losing her home of eight years meant
losing the beauty of Altadena. She described the overall area as “a
pocket of heaven.” </p>
<p>“I didn’t want to leave,” said Wong, who safely evacuated with her
husband and 2-year-old daughter. “We were just so in love with this
house, and it wasn’t just my house. It was also my studio space.” </p>
<p>Many, like Obi, Wong and Huerta, have started GoFundMe accounts.
Meanwhile, initiatives and relief efforts have popped up around Southern
California, ready to assist with clothing donations, art supplies,
professional equipment for creatives and more. </p>
<p>“I’m applying to everything,” said Obi, who needs to replace his
instruments and recording equipment. </p>
<p>Wong said she’s received much support from family, friends and
colleagues. </p>
<p>“I think I just have to kind of lean on the community and get back
into shooting,” she said. “I got to get all my gear back, too. It’s
going to be a long road, but it’ll be OK.” </p>
<p>Arts scene rebirth </p>
<p>Superchief Gallery co-founder and director Bill Dunleavy said he
believes that this is an opportunity to rebuild long-needed
infrastructure for the arts throughout Los Angeles. </p>
<p>“Quite a lot was lost in the areas affected by the fire. And it’s
going to affect rent prices and studio prices and art markets and
everything else,” said Dunleavy. “I’ve been so impressed with the amount
of compassion that people feel and the sense of duty people have felt to
help with this. … I hope that continues into the coming years.” </p>
<p>Creative director Celina Rodriguez said she hopes freelance artists
and creatives continue to work and shoot production or projects
throughout the city, rather than leaving because of the wildfires. </p>
<p>“Having lost so many locations that we would shoot, typically in
Malibu, Topanga, the Palisades, all throughout, we will have to
absolutely come together and figure out how we can continue working in
Los Angeles … and urge people to shoot productions here,” she said. </p>
<p>Rodriguez and Dunleavy began collecting donations at the Downtown Los
Angeles gallery and within 48 hours transformed it into a bustling
donation center with over 150 volunteers. The duo are now working with
displaced families to make sure their daily needs are being met. </p>
<p>Dunleavy said the relief effort has only encouraged him to take this
work beyond just the donation center and explore the possibilities of
nonprofit work for the community. </p>
<p>“All of our wheels are turning now that we’ve seen the power that
just self-organizing can have.”</p>

<h2 id="trumps-tariffs-are-a-warning">Trump’s Tariffs Are a Warning</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-02, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NjEzMDUzMC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczOTcwMTExNX0.gi2v93PbaOvqwiIHIvfQTueBFmFeeHif9CaHF1MbqrI/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
On Saturday evening, President Donald Trump signed orders placing 25%
tariffs on all goods imported from Canada and Mexico, and a lower, 10%
tariff on Canadian oil, natural gas, uranium, and other energy sources.
</p>
<p>
Trump also imposed a 10% tariff on all goods imported from China.
</p>
<p>
The tariffs will go into effect on Tuesday, giving Trump — who revels in
proposing tariffs but has shown some reluctance to impose them for real
— another 48 hours to maneuver. But if the new tariffs do actually bite,
then they will affect nearly half of America’s imports and reshape some
of the world’s most important energy and trading relationships.
</p>
<p>
Every day, millions of barrels of oil and cubic feet of natural gas flow
across the U.S., Canada, and Mexico borders. The three countries have
developed an integrated and harmonized network of pipelines, storage
tanks, and refineries that has helped turn the United States into the
world’s No. 1 producer of oil and natural gas.
</p>
<p>
The tariffs will almost inevitably disrupt that relationship. They may
also upset the millions of dollars’ worth of electricity that shuttles
from Canada to the United States every day across their shared power
grids.
</p>
<p>
The tariffs will prove economically painful, although just how damaging
is hard to know in advance. They could shrink the United States’ GDP by
0.4%, while increasing taxes by $830 per household, according to
<a href="https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/trump-tariffs-trade-war/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>an
analysis</u></a> by the Tax Foundation, a center-right think tank.
Another estimate from
<a href="https://budgetlab.yale.edu" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
Budget Lab at Yale</u></a> says that the tariffs could push up the
personal consumption expenditures price index — the Fed’s chosen
inflation gauge — by 0.75%, reducing the average household’s purchasing
power by $1,200 over the course of a year.

These costs could worsen as Mexico, Canada, and China raise their own
tariffs or trade barriers in retaliation. Late on Saturday, Prime
Minister Justin Trudeau announced that Canada would impose its own 25%
tariffs on CA$155 billion of goods imported from the United States.
</p>
<p>
The economic hit to the U.S. economy could also be much larger than
estimated if some manufacturers respond to higher costs not by hiking
prices, but rather by delaying or shutting down production.
</p>
<p>
We’ve been reporting on the economic impact of these tariffs at Heatmap
over the past week, documenting their potential impacts for
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-canada-oil-tariffs" target="_self"><u>oil
refineries</u></a> and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/canada-tariffs-electricity" target="_self"><u>the
electricity grid</u></a>. But now that the details are here, a few
things stand out.
</p>
<p>
<strong>First, the tariffs on China are qualitatively different from the
tariffs on our North American neighbors — especially Canada.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Chinese tariffs are not new. Trump engaged China in a trade war during
his first term and ultimately reached a handshake agreement, although he
has since said that China did not buy enough American agricultural
products to keep up its end of the bargain. Some of the tariffs Trump
placed on Chinese imports last time — including eye-watering levies on
solar panels — remain in effect; the new 10% tariff will be added to
those figures.
</p>
<p>
What did <em><em>not </em></em>happen last time was a serious,
out-and-out trade war with Canada and Mexico, America’s neighbors and
biggest trading partners. Although Trump entertained the possibility of
Mexican tariffs during the campaign, he did not propose tariffs on
Canadian imports until after his November election.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Second, the tariffs are
</strong><em><strong><em>quantitatively</em></strong></em><strong>
different, too.</strong> The president has not yet explained why he has
placed higher tariffs on Canada and Mexico, who are our allies, than on
China, which is our economic frenemy at best and our geostrategic
adversary at worst. During the campaign, Trump sometimes proposed a
“universal tariff” of 10% to 20% on all American imported goods,
regardless of their country of origin. That proposed universal tariff —
which was seen by some analysts as an extreme and unlikely proposal —
was at a<em><em> lower </em></em>rate than what he is now levying on
North American imports.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Third, this trade war has apparently been concocted and planned
much more haphazardly than the one during Trump’s first term.</strong>
Last time, the U.S. was careful to exempt electronics — iPhones,
laptops, Xboxes — from its levies, as well as other consumer products.
These tariffs do not do so, at least not yet. Nor do they exempt certain
minerals that are essential to manufacturing electric vehicle batteries
or other high-end electronics. (<em><em>Bloomberg </em></em>has reported
that as recently as Friday, Tesla
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-31/tesla-fights-tariffs-on-ev-graphite-putting-musk-at-odds-with-trump" target="_blank"><u>was
lobbying</u></a> for an exemption for graphite, a mineral crucial to
making EV anodes.)
</p>
<p>
<strong>Finally, what is so striking about these tariffs is how they
will be good for almost nobody.</strong>
</p>
<p>
The tariffs will hurt the American oil industry. As I
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-canada-oil-tariffs" target="_self"><u>wrote
earlier this week</u></a>, U.S. energy companies have spent tens of
billions of dollars on special equipment that can refine the sludgy,
sulfurous crude oil extracted in Canada; Canadian companies, in turn,
have sold us that crude oil at a discount and built infrastructure so
that it can be used by the United States.
</p>

The tariffs will hurt oil refineries. The U.S. refines
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=62624#:~:text=U.S.%20refining%20capacity%20increased%20this,with%20the%20start%20of%202023." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>about

million barrels</u></a> a day. Most of the difference between what it
refines and what it extracts is made up by heavy crude from Canada and
Mexico, which blends well with the lighter petroleum produced by U.S.
fracking wells. By raising the cost of Canadian and Mexican fuel
imports, the cost of all refined products will rise.
</p>
<p>
The tariffs will hurt anyone who buys gasoline in the Midwest and
Mountain West, where Canadian oil plays a much larger role in local
markets. They will hurt diesel and jet fuel prices in those regions too.
</p>
<p>
But the damage will not be limited to the fossil fuel industry.
</p>
<p>
The tariffs will hurt anyone who uses electricity across the parts of
the country, especially the Northeast, that import large amounts of
electricity from Canada’s roaring hydroelectric plants.
</p>
<p>
The tariffs will hurt home builders and construction companies because
the United States gets its best building-grade lumber from Canada. That
lumber — already made more expensive
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/01/why-climate-change-pushing-lumber-prices/621288/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>by
a climate change-intensified supply crisis</u></a> — will now face
additional taxes at the border.
</p>
<p>
The tariffs will hurt anyone who wants to buy or rent a home in the
United States because the lack of lumber will worsen the housing
shortage and general affordability crisis.
</p>
<p>
They will hurt automakers, who in the past three decades have
constructed sophisticated supply chains spanning North America — a
logistical dance that allows a single vehicle’s components and parts to
cross the U.S., Canadian, and Mexico borders many times on their way to
becoming a final product. They will hurt autoworkers, who depend on that
supply chain. They will even hurt car dealerships, who will respond to
higher prices by selling less inventory.
</p>
<p>
If the dollar rises to accommodate the new tariff level, as some White
House officials have argued, then the tariffs will hurt <em><em>all
</em></em>U.S. domestic manufacturers because their products will become
more expensive, and therefore less competitive on the global market.
</p>
<p>
I am not saying, to be clear, that these tariffs are an economic
catastrophe. We don’t actually know their economic cost yet — perhaps it
will be minimal. But even then, they will still be a stupid waste of
money that will help nobody, and which will make the U.S. economy
neither more complex nor more secure.
</p>
<p>
The tariffs are a warning. As recently as last week, Goldman Sachs
analysts
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/pkrugman.bsky.social/post/3lh5rc7we2c2i" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>put
the risk of tariffs</u></a> at only a 20% chance of actually happening.
They ignored what Trump had said<em> </em>he would do because it struck
them as too implausible, too unwise, too patently harmful. Perhaps in
the next two days they will be proven right. But Trump has begun to
blather about many unwise and harmful ideas — invading Panama (where
Secretary of State Marco Rubio is headed
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/01/us/politics/rubio-panama-canal-trump.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>right
now</u></a>), annexing Greenland, making Canada (somehow) the 51st
state. Many seem even more implausible than these tariffs, and yet
Donald Trump says that he wants to do them, too. How much longer can
Republican lawmakers and business leaders pretend that he doesn’t mean
what he says? The chance of calamity has only just begun.

says life-saving HIV treatment can continue during aid pause</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. State Department said Saturday that the
President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) – the world’s
leading HIV initiative – was covered by a waiver for life-saving
humanitarian assistance during a 90-day pause in foreign aid.</p>
<p>Just hours after taking office on Jan. 20, President Donald Trump
ordered the pause so foreign aid contributions could be reviewed to see
if they align with his “America First” foreign policy. The U.S. is the
world’s largest aid donor.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio initially issued a waiver for
emergency food aid and then Tuesday for life-saving medicine, medical
services, food, shelter and subsistence help. However, the lack of
detail in Trump’s order and the ensuing waivers has left aid groups
confused as to whether their work can continue.</p>
<p>So, Saturday the State Department’s Bureau of Global Health Security
and Diplomacy issued a memo, seen by Reuters, clarifying that PEPFAR was
covered by the Jan. 28 memo and spelling out what activities were
allowed.</p>
<p>These include life-saving HIV care and treatment services, including
testing and counseling, prevention and treatment of infections including
tuberculosis (TB), laboratory services, and procurement and supply chain
for commodities/medicines. It also allows prevention of mother-to-child
transmission services.</p>
<p>“Any other activities not specifically mentioned in this guidance may
not be resumed without express approval,” it said.</p>
<p>More than 20 million people living with HIV, who represent two-thirds
of all people living with the disease receiving treatment globally, are
directly supported by PEPFAR.</p>
<p>Under Trump’s foreign aid pause, all payments by U.S. Agency for
International Development (USAID) stopped Tuesday — for the first time
since the fiscal year began on Oct. 1 — and have not resumed, according
to U.S. Treasury data. On Monday USAID paid out $8 million and last week
a total of $545 million.</p>
<p>The Trump administration is also moving to strip a slimmed-down USAID
of its independence and put it under State Department control, two
sources familiar with the discussions said Friday, in what would be a
significant overhaul of how Washington allocates U.S. foreign aid.</p>

<h2 id="us-strikes-stronghold-of-islamic-state-affiliate-in-somalia">US
strikes stronghold of Islamic State affiliate in Somalia</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. warplanes took aim at the Islamic State affiliate
in Somalia, hitting what officials described as high-ranking operatives
in the terror group’s mountainous stronghold.</p>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump announced the precision strike Saturday
on social media, describing the main target as a “Senior ISIS Attack
Planner and other terrorists he recruited and led.”</p>
<p>“These killers, who we found hiding in caves, threatened the United
States and our Allies,” Trump said. “The strikes destroyed the caves
they live in, and killed many terrorists without, in any way, harming
civilians.”</p>
<p>A separate statement from U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said
the strikes targeted an area in Somalia’s Golis mountains, and “further
degrades ISIS’s ability to plot and conduct terrorist attacks
threatening US citizens, our partners, and innocent civilians.”</p>
<p>Neither Trump nor Hegseth named the IS planner, though U.S. officials
said the strikes were carried out in coordination with the Federal
Government of Somalia.</p>
<p>General Adan Abdi Hashi, commander of the Puntland Devish Forces said
the airstrikes targeted at least 10 locations of the Islamic State
militants in the Cal-Miskaad area, which is part of the Golis
mountains.</p>
<p>“The strikes targeted about 10 locations in the Cal-Miskaad areas,
most of them caves, and we believe that many of the militants were
killed,” said the general.</p>
<p>Residents in Qandala, a small town in Bari region of Puntland told
VOA on the condition of anonymity because they feared for their lives,
that they could see from the distance plumes of smoke and flames, and
that they could hear at least seven huge explosions.</p>
<p>Officials from Somalia’s semi-autonomous Puntland region thanked the
U.S. on social media, calling the operation a success.</p>
<p>“The latest airstrike, carried out today, resulted in the elimination
of several high-ranking #ISIS members,” according to the statement.</p>
<p>U.S. Africa Command, which oversees U.S, military efforts on the
continent, said it, too, assessed multiple terror operatives had been
killed.</p>
<p>The Islamic State, also known as IS or Daesh, has increasingly played
a key role in the terror group’s operations in Africa and beyond.</p>
<p>Since 2022, Somalia has been home to al-Karrar, one of nine regional
Islamic State offices established to help sustain the terror group’s
capabilities. As a result, IS-Somalia has become both a key cog in the
IS financial network, funneling money to affiliates in Afghanistan and
elsewhere in Africa.</p>
<p>IS-Somalia has, at the same time, become more influential under the
leadership of Abdulkadir Mumin, a former militant with the
al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab, who is thought to now head IS’ directorate of
provinces, overseeing the terror group’s affiliates in Africa.</p>
<p>Some U.S. officials worry Mumin has risen even higher, perhaps acting
as the Islamic State’s top emir. Others disagree but there is consensus
that Mumin is nonetheless a pivotal figure.</p>
<p>The U.S. previously targeted Mumin in May of last year.</p>
<p>Recent intelligence assessments have further warned IS-Somalia has
more than doubled in size over the past year and may now boast up to as
many as 1,600 fighters, bolstered by an influx of fighters from
Ethiopia, Morocco, Sudan, Syria, Tanzania and Yemen.</p>
<p>Most of IS-Somalia’s manpower has been concentrated in Puntland,
especially in the Golis Mountains, also known as the Cal-Miskaad
mountains.</p>
<p>Saturday’s airstrike, the first against IS in Somalia so far this
year, was carried out by fighter jets launched from the USS Harry S.
Truman, currently in the Red Sea, according to defense officials who
spoke to VOA on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss details
of the operation.</p>
<p>It comes as Somali forces in Puntland continue a military offensive
against ISIS militants hiding in Cal-Miskaad mountains. Puntland also
thanked the United Arab Emirates which they say provided air support to
the ongoing offensive.</p>
<p>The operations, which started in late December, drove militants from
vast areas in the northeastern highlands of Somalia.</p>
<p>The militants, many of them foreigners, have claimed carrying out IED
attacks against Puntland forces.</p>
<p>The fiercest clashes occurred late last week when the regional forces
dislodged the militants from Turmasaale, a strategic location about 150
kilometers southeast of Bosaso.</p>
<p>The Somali government called Saturday’s airstrikes by the U.S. “a
critical step in our shared fight against terrorism.”</p>
<p>“The Federal Government of Somalia welcomes the firm and decisive
counterterrorism efforts led by the United States,” it said in a
statement. “Together, we will continue to dismantle extremist networks …
and build a future free from the scourge of terrorism.”</p>

<h2 id="trump-places-tariffs-on-canada-mexico-china">Trump places
tariffs on Canada, Mexico, China</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WHITE HOUSE — U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order
Saturday that places 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico and
10% tariffs on goods from China starting Tuesday, the White House
said.</p>
<p>“Both Canada and Mexico have allowed an unprecedented invasion of
illegal fentanyl that is killing American citizens, and also illegal
immigrants into our country,” White House press secretary Karoline
Leavitt said during her briefing Friday.</p>
<p>Trump, who is spending the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago estate in
Florida, was not scheduled to speak to reporters.</p>
<p>While Canadian goods will face a 25% tariff, Trump said he would
tariff Canadian crude oil imports at 10%. Mexico’s energy imports are
included in its 25% tariffs. For Canada alone, Trump canceled the “de
minimis” tariff exemption for shipments worth less than $800.</p>
<p>China’s 10% would be on top of various existing tariffs on its
goods.</p>
<p>Under the order, there is no process to seek an exception, but there
is one to escalate the tariff rates if the countries retaliate.</p>
<p>Mexico and Canada responded later Saturday while China denounced
Trump’s action Sunday but left open the possibility for talks to avoid
worsening the situation.</p>
<p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum ordered retaliatory tariffs in
response to the U.S. move, saying in a post on X that her government
would prefer dialogue but had been forced to respond.</p>
<p>“I’ve instructed my economy minister to implement the plan B we’ve
been working on, which includes tariff and nontariff measures in defense
of Mexico’s interests,” she wrote.</p>
<p>She also rejected “the White House’s slander that the Mexican
government has alliances with criminal organizations, as well as any
intention of meddling in our territory.”</p>
<p>“If the United States government and its agencies wanted to address
the serious fentanyl consumption in their country, they could fight the
sale of drugs on the streets of their major cities, which they don’t do,
and the laundering of money that this illegal activity generates that
has done so much harm to its population,” she wrote.</p>
<p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Saturday that Canada
would retaliate against the U.S. action with 25% tariffs on U.S. goods,
saying that the tariffs would apply to $155 billion in U.S. goods, with
those on $30 billion to go into effect Tuesday those on the other $125
billion in 21 days.</p>
<p>He also said Canada is looking at nontariff measures, possibly
relating to critical minerals, energy and other partnerships.</p>
<p>China on Sunday denounced the U.S. tariff on China, saying it would
challenge the move in at the World Trade Organizations and take
“corresponding countermeasures to resolutely safeguard our own rights
and interests.”</p>
<p>While its Commerce Ministry said the U.S. move “seriously violates”
international trade rules, it urged Washington to “engage in frank
dialogue and strengthen cooperation.”</p>
<p>‘Negative impact’ predicted</p>
<p>China, Mexico and Canada account for more than one-third of the goods
and services imported into or bought from the United States.</p>
<p>Some economists warn that the tariffs could backfire.</p>
<p>Imports from Mexico and Canada make up around 3% of U.S. gross
domestic product, while exports make up around 2.5% of U.S. GDP, Brad
Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said.</p>
<p>A 25% tariff on Mexico and Canada amounts to a “tax hike on imports
from those countries” and will “have an immediate and negative impact on
the U.S. economy,” he told VOA. “It’s a strategy for shrinking the U.S.
economy.”</p>
<p>Trump has long threatened to impose tariffs to pressure countries to
help his administration stop illegal immigration and the smuggling of
chemicals used for fentanyl. He has pledged to use tariffs to boost
domestic manufacturing and has praised their use as an effective
economic policy.</p>
<p>Trump believes that “tariffs are a great source of leverage,” and
that he will “convince Canada and Mexico to make big concessions under
the threat of tariffs,” Setser said. “But these measures are going to be
pretty costly to the U.S.”</p>
<p>Trump acknowledged that the tariffs might cause a “short-term
disruption” for consumers but said they would lead to a long-term
benefit for U.S. manufacturing.</p>
<p>“Tariffs don’t cause inflation. Tariffs cause success,” he added.</p>
<p>Trump had vowed Friday to impose sweeping tariffs on semiconductors,
pharmaceuticals, steel and aluminum, and oil and gas.</p>
<p>“All forms of medicine and pharmaceuticals,” Trump said. “And we’ll
be doing, very importantly, steel, and we’ll also be doing chips and
things associated with chips.”</p>
<p>Trump warned he would “absolutely” place tariffs on goods from the
European Union.</p>
<p>“They’re treating us so badly,” he said.</p>
<p>In imposing the tariffs, he invoked the International Emergency
Economic Powers Act. The White House said Saturday the act was needed
because of “the extraordinary threat posed by illegal aliens and drugs,
including deadly fentanyl, constitutes a national emergency.”</p>
<p>Free trade agreement</p>
<p>During his first administration, in 2018, Trump negotiated and signed
the United States-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement, in part to narrow
the large U.S. trade deficit — the gap between what it exports and what
it imports — with its neighbors. He once called the deal “the fairest,
most balanced and beneficial trade agreement we have ever signed into
law.”</p>
<p>However, the U.S. trade deficit in goods with Mexico has widened from
$106 billion in 2019 to $161 billion in 2023, according to government
data. The trade gap in goods with Canada has also increased, from $31
billion in 2019 to $72 billion in 2023.</p>
<p>“He’s now acting like his deal caused a disaster needing an emergency
fix,” said Derek Scissors, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise
Institute.</p>
<p>There is no justification for high tariffs on Canada, a market
economy that is not in the top five of U.S. trade deficits, Scissors
said. “Fentanyl shipments across the Canadian border are tiny,” he
added.</p>
<p>Fentanyl and illegal migration are justifications for border
restrictions on Mexico, Scissors said. However, tariffs “don’t stop
illegal immigration and probably encourage it by threatening jobs in
Mexico.”</p>
<p>Some information for this report came from The Associated Press,
Reuters, and Agence France-Presse.</p>

media organizations ‘rotated’ out of Pentagon press corps offices</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration, in an
unprecedented move, announced late Friday it would remove four media
organizations including The New York Times from their dedicated office
spaces in the Pentagon, citing a desire to make room for others. </p>
<p>The memo on a “New Annual Media Rotation Program” said it would also
remove National Public Radio, NBC News and Politico, which must vacate
their spaces by February 14. In their place, it would give dedicated
office space to the New York Post, One America News Network, Breitbart
News Network and HuffPost News. </p>
<p>Each year going forward, one outlet from print, online, television
and radio will rotate out of the Pentagon “to allow a new outlet from
the same medium that has not had the unique opportunity to report as a
resident member of the Pentagon Press Corps,” the memo said. </p>
<p>“We’re disappointed by the decision to deny us access to a
broadcasting booth at the Pentagon that we’ve used for many decades,” an
NBC News spokesperson said by email. “Despite the significant obstacles
this presents to our ability to gather and report news in the national
public interest, we will continue to report with the same integrity and
rigor NBC News always has.” </p>
<p>The New York Times said it remained committed to covering the
Pentagon “fully and fairly” despite the move. </p>
<p>“Steps designed to impede access are clearly not in the public
interest,” The Times said in a statement. </p>
<p>NPR called on the Defense Department to expand office space available
so all media outlets covering the Pentagon receive equal access. </p>
<p>“This decision interferes with the ability of millions of Americans
to directly hear from Pentagon leadership, and with NPR’s public
interest mission to serve Americans who turn to our network of local
public media stations in all 50 states,” it said. </p>
<p>Politico did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside
regular business hours. </p>
<p>More than two dozen news organizations operate out of the Pentagon,
including Reuters, reporting on the daily activities of the U.S.
military. </p>
<p>“To be clear, the outlets that vacate the spaces loaned them by the
secretary (of defense) will remain full members of the Pentagon Press
Corps,” said John Ullyot, acting assistant to the secretary of defense
for public affairs. </p>
<p>“The only change will be giving up their physical workspaces in the
building to allow new outlets to have their turn to become resident
members of the Pentagon Press Corps.” </p>
<p>The Pentagon Press Association, which represents journalists who
cover the Defense Department, said it was “greatly troubled by this
unprecedented move by DOD to single out highly professional media.” </p>
<p>Reuters correspondent Phil Stewart is a member of the association’s
four-member board of directors.</p>

says Venezuela agrees to receive undocumented migrants captured in
US</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday that
Venezuela has agreed to receive all Venezuelan undocumented migrants
captured in the United States and pay for their transport.</p>
<p>“Venezuela has agreed to receive, back into their country, all
Venezuela illegal aliens who were encamped in the U.S., including gang
members of Tren de Aragua,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social.</p>
<p>He said Venezuela has also agreed to provide transportation.</p>
<p>The Venezuelan government did not immediately reply to a request for
comment.</p>
<p>U.S. envoy Richard Grenell met with Venezuelan President Nicolas
Maduro in the South American country on Friday. Hours after their
meeting, six American hostages were released and returned to the United
States from Venezuela.</p>
<p>The announcement of Venezuela’s decision to accept the return of its
citizens who were illegally in the United States comes one week after
Trump threatened to impose tariffs and sanctions after Colombia refused
to accept military flights carrying deportees.</p>
<p>Colombia reversed its course and agreed to accept migrants following
the threats.</p>
<p>“We are in the process of removing record numbers of illegal aliens
from all countries,” said Trump, who vowed to crack down on illegal
immigration in his 2024 presidential campaign.</p>
<p>Trump, a Republican, issued an array of executive orders to crack
down on illegal immigration after taking office on Jan. 20, including
actions aimed at deporting record numbers of migrants in the U.S.
without legal status.</p>

leading indicator of impacts that are going to be much larger than what
we’re seeing with our program and our company,” Funk told me.
</p>
<p>
I asked Funk about the work ZEN does, the confusion around learning that
its funding was affected, and how he and the customers he serves have
responded. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

<strong>What led you to start Zero Emissions Northwest? </strong>
</p>
<p>
I’ve been in energy for coming up on two decades, so I’ve got experience
in the space. Then the second thing that happened was I married a
farmer’s daughter outside of Spokane — so a 10,000-acre wheat farm — and
that got me a lot closer to agriculture than I had ever been. And the
last thing, about four years ago, I looked at my father in law’s shop
and said, there’s got to be a grant for a farmer to put solar on their
shop. I found the Rural Energy for America Program, wrote him a grant,
successfully won it, and then about six of his neighbors came by and
said, “Hey, how’d you get him money? I want money to go and improve my
farm.” So then I was the most experienced person in eastern Washington.
And the USDA launched a contract called the
<a href="https://www.rd.usda.gov/programs-services/energy-programs/rural-energy-america-technical-assistance-grant-program" target="_blank"><u>Technical
Assistance contract</u></a>, which we won in Idaho and Washington. And
that’s when I quit my job and started ZEN.
</p>
<p>
In rough numbers, our projects have won about $4 million worth of grant
support, and that $4 million worth of grant support is matched by
private capital. And then those projects are going to save $20 million
over their useful life. So call it $30 million of total investment in
rural communities, because the money saved on these farms doesn’t go to
anything other than fertilizer for next year’s crop, and seed, wheat,
and maintenance and mechanics. All of this gets reinvested in making
that farm better or making that business better.
</p>
<p>
<strong>How did you learn that ZEN would be impacted by Trump’s
executive order? </strong>
</p>
<p>
We talked to people in the government, and they have repeatedly told us
that obligated grants have never been removed. So we were operating on
the understanding that once a project is obligated, we can then start
working and helping that farmer execute on that project. So Trump takes
office, we’re still heads down doing what we’re doing — and we do have
this belief that the work that we’re doing is exactly the work that
Trump wants to see.
</p>
<p>
We get paid roughly about four times a year, so basically a quarterly
invoice. So we haven’t been paid since October. We submitted an invoice
in early January for our normal operating procedures, and the USDA
processed that in the first week of the Trump administration, and said,
“Cool. They’ve done everything, press pay<em><em>,</em></em>” and it
didn’t go through. We were told verbally that there were back-end
restrictions.
</p>
<p>
We thought it was all
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-memo-climate-programs" target="_self"><u>tied
to this OMB thing</u></a>. On Tuesday night, [the OMB memo]
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-pause-federal-grants-aid-f9948b9996c0ca971f0065fac85737ce" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>was
blocked</u></a>, and then on Wednesday,
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-pause-federal-grants-aid-6d41961940585544fa43a3f66550e7be" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>it
was rescinded</u></a>. And all of that’s happening in real time with
everybody in the country — not just us citizens, but employees as well.
Bureaucrats going, <em><em>we’re learning about this by tweet, too!
</em></em>And then on Wednesday, we learned in real time with our
partners that [the pause in funding] was actually
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>from
an executive order</u></a>, not from the OMB memo. We made the decision
that day to furlough our employees. If this goes for 90 days, it’ll be
six months of us not getting paid on our largest source of revenue.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Have the farmers and small businesses that you work with had to
halt their in-process projects? </strong>
</p>
<p>
It varies for each project. We have a handful of solar projects that are
up, and we’re just waiting on a utility interconnection. So those
projects we’re finishing. We’ve got equipment like new washing machines
en route to a rural laundromat. That’s going to still happen, because
he’s already bought them, but his second invoice is going to become due
when those show up on site. So he doesn’t really know what’s going on
and how to pause that. But if you haven’t started on your project, we’re
advising people to not take on more risk by spending money and [instead]
just pausing [their projects].
</p>
<p>
<strong>I know it’s only been a few days, but what efforts have you made
thus far to get in touch with the federal government? </strong>
</p>
<p>
I’ve got a long list of people that we’re trying to get in touch with.
I’ve told all of our customers — many of whom are in the GOP in eastern
Washington and northern Idaho — to call their representatives, as well
as if they have Twitter, tweet at Donald Trump. So we’re trying to
empower our customers to really advocate for their projects, and that’s
our main focus.
</p>
<p>
I’m sure a majority of our customers voted for Donald Trump and voted
for the GOP representatives, and we just want them to really explain how
this is damaging their business and their farm.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Given that many of your customers support President Trump, what
has their reaction to this funding freeze been like? </strong>
</p>
<p>
Everybody expected that funding would continue. That was the message
that we were getting from the USDA — the obligated funds have been
obligated, the government has signed a contract. So everybody was
surprised about that. But I’ll be honest, their reactions are mixed.
Some farmers are furious. They have spent this money. They have taken on
a risk. They did so with the expectation that the government would honor
their contract. So that’s one category. We have another category of
farmer that kind of lumps this into weather — things they can’t control.
There’s much more understanding if you did vote for Donald Trump. We
have had a farmer say, “Maybe they’ll find some waste and it’ll filter
through, and we’ll eventually get paid. We can’t control that, but this
might be a good thing for our country.” To which I replied, I want the
filter first, not second!
</p>
<p>
But nobody thinks that their project doesn’t fit this mold of unleashing
American energy. Nobody is really doubting that they might eventually
get paid, because this is aligned with what everybody wants. We’re
helping farmers take control of their costs, generate onsite power, or
conserve energy through upgrades that really benefit their bottom line
and really improve their own farm. We’re helping them reinvest in
themselves through the process. We prioritize Made in America equipment
wherever possible. We want to see these tax dollars and these incentives
stay in the country. So we’ve actually never had a farmer choose to go
with a non-Made in America solar system.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Even if this funding pause ends soon, how do you think about the
future of your organization given President Trump’s apparent antipathy
toward renewable energy and energy efficiency projects — or at least
language that highlights any sustainability-related benefits? </strong>
</p>
<p>
If we’re going to go and apply for more contracts to the USDA, one of my
big concerns right now is if we’re talking about [renewable energy and
energy efficiency], are we going to get blacklisted from doing the work
that we do in rural Washington? We have always been, with our customer
base, really focused on finance, cost savings, practicality — and then
all of the decarbonization benefits of this stuff is very secondary for
all of our projects.
</p>
<p>
When I named the company, all of those things were also in question,
right? I called a farmer and said, “Hi, it’s David Funk from Zero
Emissions Northwest.” And they said, “What? You don’t fart?” And he hung
up on me. We think about, how are we being viewed by our customers? And
with the politicalization of language, are we losing out on a market
segment that we could be helping, just because somebody looks at our
name and says, well, I’m not gonna work with them? It’s an active
discussion always, how we present ourselves on paper.

government web pages have gone dark complying with Trump orders</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Several U.S. government web pages changed or went dark Friday as
agencies scrambled to comply with President Donald Trump’s executive
orders declaring his administration would recognize only two genders and
ordering an end to diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.</p>
<p>In a letter sent Wednesday, the Office of Personnel Management
directed agency heads to terminate grants and contracts related to
“gender ideology,” ask staff to remove pronouns from their government
emails and disband resource groups on the issue, too. The directive,
which ordered agencies to institute changes by 5 p.m. Friday, also asked
agencies to remove the term “gender” from government forms and swap it
out with “sex.”</p>
<p>Here is a list of changes and missing pages seen so far. Several
pages have popped up since being taken down, some with changes:</p>
<p>National Park Service pages for historic sites related to the
internment of Japanese Americans, the Tuskegee Airmen and the Stonewall
Uprising for gay rights were inaccessible. The Tuskegee site was back
online a short time later, but the others remained down Friday
evening.</p>
<p>The State Department removed the “X” gender marker and replaced
“gender” with “sex” on online consular forms. A page with tips for
lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and intersex travelers was
altered. It’s now titled “LGB Travelers” instead of “LGBTQIA+
Travelers.”</p>
<p>The Census Bureau’s homepage was down. Links to reports and topic
pages outlining details about the gender identity, sexual orientation
and characteristics of the nation’s population returned errors. A
message Friday afternoon for one topic page titled “Sexual Orientation
&amp; Gender Identity” read, “The area of census.gov that you are trying
to access is currently unavailable due to maintenance.” Another page
titled “Mental Health Struggles Higher Among LGBT Adults Than Non-LGBT
Adults in All Age Groups” also was unavailable. Archives of both pages
show they were accessible within the past week. The bureau’s homepage
was up Saturday morning.</p>
<p>Intelligence Community Inspector General reports were scrubbed from
the website of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.
Trump previously fired around 17 inspectors general — known as
independent government watchdogs — at multiple federal agencies.</p>
<p>A Bureau of Prisons web page originally titled “Inmate Gender” was
relabeled “Inmate Sex” on Friday. A breakdown of transgender inmates in
federal prisons was no longer included.</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website took down much
public health information: contraception guidance; a fact sheet about
HIV and transgender people; lessons on building supportive school
environments for transgender and nonbinary kids; details about National
Transgender HIV Testing Day; a set of government surveys showing
transgender students suffering higher rates of depression, drug use,
bullying and other problems. The agency also removed its data
repository, data.cdc.gov. A message said “the website will resume
operations once in compliance” with Trump’s executive order.</p>
<p>In addition, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the military to
immediately stop recognizing identity months, including Black History
Month, Women’s History Month, Asian American and Pacific Islander
Heritage Month, National Hispanic Heritage Month, National Disability
Employment Awareness Month and National American Indian Heritage
Month.</p>

marks Black History Month while Pentagon declares ‘identity months
dead’</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Trump White House issued a proclamation Friday
recognizing February as Black History Month around the same time the
U.S. Defense Department issued guidance declaring “identity months
dead.”</p>
<p>The conflicting messages came as President Donald Trump has been
targeting diversity, equity and inclusion programs for removal in the
first weeks of his administration. He has referred to DEI initiatives as
“discrimination” and insisted that the country must instead move toward
a merit-based society.</p>
<p>The White House proclamation calls for “public officials, educators,
librarians and all the people of the United States to observe this month
with appropriate programs, ceremonies and activities,” though there is
no elaboration on what constitutes “appropriate.”</p>
<p>A news release from the Defense Department titled “Identity Months
Dead at DOD” says official resources, including working hours, will no
longer be used to mark cultural awareness months. Black History Month,
Women’s History Month and National Disability Employment Awareness Month
were among the events listed as now barred.</p>
<p>“We are proud of our warriors and their history, but we will focus on
the character of their service instead of their immutable
characteristics,” the Defense Department release read.</p>
<p>In his first two weeks in office, Trump has moved to end affirmative
action in federal contracting and directed that all federal DEI workers
be put on paid leave before eventually being laid off. On Thursday,
hours after a midair collision between a military helicopter and an
American Airlines plane killed 67 people just miles from the White
House, Trump baselessly blamed diversity initiatives for undermining air
safety, despite no evidence of that.</p>
<p>Gerald Ford in 1976 became the first president to issue a message
recognizing February as Black History Month. Since then, presidents have
made annual proclamations marking the month as a celebration of Black
history, culture and education.</p>
<p>Trump’s proclamation Friday specifically noted the contributions of
abolitionists Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman, conservative
economist Thomas Sowell and Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. It
said their achievements “have monumentally advanced the tradition of
equality under the law in our great country” and are a continued
inspiration.</p>
<p>The declaration also listed golfer Tiger Woods as an American great,
saying he was among those who have “pushed the boundaries of excellence
in their respective fields, paving the way for others to follow.”</p>
<p>“This National Black History Month, as America prepares to enter a
historic Golden Age,” the proclamation said, “I want to extend my
tremendous gratitude to black Americans for all they have done to bring
us to this moment, and for the many future contributions they will make
as we advance into a future of limitless possibility under my
administration.”</p>

to elect leader as party struggles to regroup</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>OXON HILL, MARYLAND — Democrats, seeking a new message and messengers
to push back against the Trump administration, will elect a new leader
Saturday in a low-profile Democratic National Committee election that
could have big implications for the party’s future.</p>
<p>More than 400 DNC members from every state and U.S. territory have
gathered in suburban Washington for the election, which features a slate
of candidates dominated by party insiders. Outgoing Chair Jaime Harrison
is not seeking reelection.</p>
<p>Most of the candidates acknowledge that the Democratic brand is badly
damaged, but few are promising fundamental changes. Indeed, nearly three
months after Donald Trump won the popular vote and gained ground among
key Democratic constituencies, there is little agreement on what exactly
went wrong.</p>
<p>Facing an emboldened Trump presidency, however, the leading
candidates are talking tough. “As we reel with shock at the horror that
Trump is visiting on communities across this country, we need a DNC and
a DNC chair who’s ready to bring the intensity, the focus and the fury
to fight back,” said Ben Wikler, the Wisconsin Democratic chair and a
top candidate for DNC chair.</p>
<p>The election comes less than two weeks after Trump’s inauguration and
as Democratic leaders struggle to confront the sheer volume of executive
orders, pardons, personnel changes and controversial relationships
taking shape in the new administration. The next DNC chair would serve
as a face of the Democratic response, while helping to coordinate
political strategy and repair the party’s brand.</p>
<p>Just 31% of voters have a favorable opinion of the Democratic Party,
according to a Quinnipiac University poll released this week that offers
a dramatic contrast with Trump’s GOP. Forty-three percent of voters have
a favorable opinion of the Republican Party.</p>
<p>The leading candidates for DNC chair, Wisconsin’s Wikler and
Minnesota’s Ken Martin, are low-profile state party chairs. They’re
promising to refocus the Democratic message on working-class voters,
strengthen Democratic infrastructure across the country and improve the
party’s anti-Trump rapid response system. They have promised not to shy
away from the party’s dedication to diversity and minority groups, a
pillar of the modern-day Democratic Party.</p>
<p>But if Martin, 51, or Wikler, 43, is elected, as expected, either
would be the first white man to lead the DNC since 2011.</p>
<p>Also in the race: Marianne Williamson, the activist and author;
former Maryland governor and Biden administration official Martin
O’Malley; and Faiz Shakir, who managed Bernie Sanders’ last presidential
campaign.</p>
<p>Shakir has called for sweeping changes within the party, such as more
coordination with labor unions and less focus on minority groups sorted
by race and gender. The only Muslim seeking the chairmanship, Shakir was
alone during a candidate forum this week in opposing the creation of a
Muslim caucus at the DNC. But he has struggled to gain traction. Shakir
declined to raise money for the contest, decorating his modest booth at
this week’s gathering with pictures drawn by his young children with
crayons.</p>
<p>By contrast, Martin and Wikler hosted would-be supporters in large
hotel suites adorned with dozens of professionally printed signs and
offered T-shirts, sunglasses and food.</p>
<p>Wikler has faced questions about his relationship with Democratic
donor Reid Hoffman, the billionaire cofounder of LinkedIn. But he cast
his fundraising connections as an asset. Indeed, the DNC chair is
expected to raise tens of millions of dollars to help Democrats win
elections.</p>
<p>Some Democratic leaders remain concerned about the direction of their
party. “As positive as I am and as hopeful as I am, I’m watching this in
real time, thinking to myself, ‘We’re in real trouble because I don’t
see a desire to change,’” said Kansas Democratic Chair Jeanna Repass, a
candidate for DNC vice chair.</p>

id="trump-administration-fires-prosecutors-involved-in-jan.-6-cases">Trump
administration fires prosecutors involved in Jan. 6 cases</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Friday fired a group of
prosecutors involved in the Jan. 6 criminal cases and demanded the names
of FBI agents involved in those same probes so they can possibly be
ousted, moves that reflect a White House determination to exert control
over federal law enforcement and purge agencies of career employees seen
as insufficiently loyal.</p>
<p>Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove ordered the firings of the
Jan. 6 prosecutors days after President Donald Trump’s sweeping clemency
action benefiting the more than 1,500 people charged in the U.S. Capitol
attack, according to a memo obtained by The Associated Press. About two
dozen employees at the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington were
terminated, said a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the
condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss
personnel issues.</p>
<p>A separate memo by Bove identified more than a half-dozen FBI senior
executives who were ordered to retire or be fired by Monday, and also
asked for the names, titles and offices of all FBI employees who worked
on investigations into the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot — a list the
bureau’s acting director said could number in the thousands. Bove, who
has defended Trump in his criminal cases before joining the
administration, said Justice Department officials would then carry out a
“review process to determine whether any additional personnel actions
are necessary.”</p>
<p>“As we’ve said since the moment we agreed to take on these roles, we
are going to follow the law, follow FBI policy, and do what’s in the
best interest of the workforce and the American people — always,” acting
FBI Director Brian Driscoll wrote in a letter to the workforce.</p>
<p>The prosecutors fired in the D.C. U.S. attorney’s office had been
hired for temporary assignments to support the Jan. 6 cases but were
moved into permanent roles after Trump’s presidential win in November,
according to the memo obtained by the AP. Bove, the acting deputy
attorney general, said he would not “tolerate subversive personnel
actions by the previous administration.”</p>
<p>Any mass firings at the FBI would be a major blow to the historic
independence from the White House of the nation’s premier federal law
enforcement agency but would be in keeping with Trump’s persistent
resolve to bend the law enforcement and intelligence community to his
will. It would be part of a startling pattern of retribution waged on
federal government employees, following the forced ousters of a group of
senior FBI executives earlier this week as well as a broad termination
by the Justice Department of prosecutors on special counsel Jack Smith’s
team who investigated Trump.</p>
<p>The FBI Agents Association said the reported efforts to oust agents
represented “outrageous actions by acting officials” that were
“fundamentally at odds with the law enforcement objectives outlined by
President Trump and his support for FBI Agents.”</p>
<p>“Dismissing potentially hundreds of Agents would severely weaken the
Bureau’s ability to protect the country from national security and
criminal threats and will ultimately risk setting up the Bureau and its
new leadership for failure,” the association said in a statement.</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear what recourse any fired agent might
take, but the bureau has a well-defined process for terminations and any
abrupt action that bypasses that protocol could presumably open the door
to a legal challenge.</p>
<p>When pressed during his confirmation hearing Thursday, Trump’s pick
for FBI director, Kash Patel, said he was not aware of any plans to
terminate or otherwise punish FBI employees who were involved in the
Trump investigations. Patel said if he was confirmed he would follow the
FBI’s internal review processes for taking action against employees.</p>
<p>Asked by Democratic Senator Cory Booker whether he would reverse any
decisions before his confirmation that don’t follow that standard
process, Patel said, “I don’t know what’s going on right now over there,
but I’m committed to you, senator, and your colleagues, that I will
honor the due process of the FBI.”</p>
<p>Before he was nominated for the director’s position, Patel had
remarked on at least one podcast appearance about what he called
anti-Trump “conspirators” in the government and news media who he said
needed to be rooted out.</p>
<p>Trump has for years expressed fury at the FBI and Justice Department
over investigations that shadowed his presidency, including an inquiry
into ties between Russia and his 2016 campaign, and continued over the
last four years. He fired one FBI director, James Comey, amid the Russia
investigation and then replaced his second, Christopher Wray, just weeks
after his win in November.</p>
<p>Asked at the White House on Friday if he had anything to do with the
scrutiny of the agents, he said: “No, but we have some very bad people
over there. It was weaponized at a level that nobody’s never seen
before. They came after a lot of people — like me — but they came after
a lot of people.”</p>
<p>He added, “If they fired some people over there, that’s a good thing,
because they were very bad.”</p>
<p>The FBI and Smith’s team investigated Trump over his efforts to
overturn the 2020 presidential election and his hoarding of classified
documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Both of those cases
resulted in indictments that were withdrawn after Trump’s November
presidential win because of longstanding Justice Department policy
prohibiting the federal prosecution of a sitting president.</p>
<p>The Justice Department also charged more than 1,500 Trump supporters
in connection with the Capitol riot, although Trump on his first day in
office granted clemency to all of them — including the ones convicted of
violent crimes — through pardons, sentence commutations and dismissals
of indictments.</p>
<p>This week, the Justice Department fired more than a dozen prosecutors
who worked on Smith investigations, and a group of senior FBI executives
— including several executive assistant directors and agents in charge
of big-city field offices — have been told to either resign or retire or
be fired Monday.</p>

<p>Donald Trump said Friday that any collective bargaining agreements
reached with federal workers within 30 days of his inauguration will not
be approved, the latest salvo in the U.S. president’s bid to remake the
federal workforce.</p>
<p>In a memo addressed to the heads of all executive departments and
agencies, Trump said former U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration
purposefully finalized collective bargaining agreements with federal
employees in its final days “in an effort to harm my administration by
extending its wasteful and failing policies beyond its time in
office.”</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear how many agreements would be affected by
the new policy, which refers to them as “lame-duck collective bargaining
agreements.”</p>
<p>Collective bargaining agreements are deals between unions and their
employees that outline working conditions, pay and other policies.</p>
<p>The move comes as President Donald Trump embarks on a massive
makeover of the U.S. government, firing and sidelining hundreds of civil
servants in his first steps toward downsizing the bureaucracy and
installing more loyalists.</p>
<p>The memo cites a U.S. Department of Education collective bargaining
agreement reached three days before Trump took office that “generally
prohibits the agency from returning remote employees to their
offices.”</p>
<p>Trump has signed an executive order that would require federal
employees to work in-office five days a week, reversing a remote working
trend that took off in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

id="mushers-dogs-braved-alaska-winter-to-deliver-lifesaving-serum-100-years-ago">Mushers,
dogs braved Alaska winter to deliver lifesaving serum 100 years ago</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ANCHORAGE, ALASKA — The Alaska Gold Rush town of Nome faced a bleak
winter. It was hundreds of miles from anywhere, cut off by the frozen
sea and unrelenting blizzards, and under siege from a contagious disease
known as the “strangling angel” for the way it suffocated children. </p>
<p>Now, 100 years later, Nome is remembering its saviors — the sled dogs
and mushers who raced for more than five days through hypothermia,
frostbite, gale-force winds and blinding whiteouts to deliver lifesaving
serum and free the community from the grip of diphtheria. </p>
<p>Among the events celebrating the centennial of the 1925 “Great Race
of Mercy” are lectures, a dog-food drive and a reenactment of the final
leg of the relay, all organized by the Nome Kennel Club. </p>
<p>Alaskans honor ‘heroic effort’ </p>
<p>“There’s a lot of fluff around celebrations like this, but we wanted
to remember the mushers and their dogs who have been at the center of
this heroic effort and … spotlight mushing as a still-viable thing for
the state of Alaska,” said Diana Haecker, a kennel club board member and
co-owner of Alaska’s oldest newspaper, The Nome Nugget. </p>
<p>“People just dropped whatever they were doing,” she said. “These
mushers got their teams ready and went, even though it was really cold
and challenging conditions on the trail.” </p>
<p>Other communities are also marking the anniversary — including the
village of Nenana, where the relay began, and Cleveland, Ohio, where the
serum run’s most famous participant, a husky mix named Balto, is stuffed
and displayed at a museum. </p>
<p>Jonathan Hayes, a Maine resident who has been working to preserve the
genetic line of sled dogs driven on the run by famed musher Leonhard
Seppala, is recreating the trip. Hayes left Nenana on Monday with 16
Seppala Siberian sled dogs, registered descendants of Seppala’s
team. </p>
<p>A race to save lives</p>
<p>Diphtheria is an airborne disease that causes a thick, suffocating
film on the back of the throat; it was once a leading cause of death for
children. The antitoxin used to treat it was developed in 1890, and a
vaccine in 1923; it is now exceedingly rare in the U.S. </p>
<p>Nome, western Alaska’s largest community, had about 1,400 residents a
century ago. Its most recent supply ship had arrived the previous fall,
before the Bering Sea froze, without any doses of the antitoxin. Those
the local doctor, Curtis Welch, had were outdated, but he wasn’t
worried. He hadn’t seen a case of diphtheria in the 18 years he had
practiced in the area. </p>
<p>Within months, that changed. In a telegram, Welch pleaded with the
U.S. Public Health Service to send serum: “An epidemic of diphtheria is
almost inevitable here.” </p>
<p>The first death was a 3-year-old boy on January 20, 1925, followed
the next day by a 7-year-old girl. By the end of the month, there were
more than 20 confirmed cases. The city was placed under quarantine. </p>
<p>West Coast hospitals had antitoxin doses, but it would take time to
get them to Seattle, Washington, and then onto a ship for Seward,
Alaska, an ice-free port south of Anchorage, Alaska. In the meantime,
enough for 30 people was found at an Anchorage hospital. </p>
<p>It still had to get to Nome. Airplanes with open-air cockpits were
ruled out as unsuited for the weather. There were no roads or trains
that reached Nome. </p>
<p>Instead, officials shipped the serum by rail to Nenana in interior
Alaska, some 1,086 kilometers (675 miles) from Nome via the frozen Yukon
River and mail trails. </p>
<p>Thanks to Alaska’s new telegraph lines and the spread of radio, the
nation followed along, captivated, as 20 mushers — many of them Alaska
Natives — with more than 150 dogs relayed the serum to Nome. They
battled deep snow, whiteouts so severe they couldn’t see the dogs in
front of them, and life-threatening temperatures that plunged at times
to minus minus 51 degrees Celsius (60 degrees Fahrenheit).</p>
<p>The antitoxin was transported in glass vials covered with padded
quilts. Not a single vial broke. </p>
<p>Seppala, a Norwegian settler, left from Nome to meet the supply near
the halfway point and begin the journey back. His team, led by his dog
Togo, traveled more than 320 kilometers (250 miles) of the relay,
including a treacherous stretch across frozen Norton Sound. </p>
<p>After about 5 1/2 days, the serum reached its destination on February
2, 1925. A banner front-page headline in the San Francisco Chronicle
proclaimed “Dogs victors over blizzard in battle to succor stricken
Nome.” </p>
<p>The official record listed five deaths and 29 illnesses. It’s likely
the toll was higher; Alaska Natives were not accurately tracked. </p>
<p>Balto gains fame </p>
<p>Seppala and Togo missed the limelight that went to his assistant,
Gunnar Kaasen, who drove the dog team led by Balto into Nome. Balto was
another of Seppala’s dogs, but was used to only haul freight after he
was deemed too slow to be on a competitive team.</p>
<p>Balto was immortalized in movies and with statues in New York’s
Central Park and one in Anchorage intended as a tribute to all sled
dogs. He received a bone-shaped key to the city of Los Angeles, where
legendary movie actress Mary Pickford placed a wreath around his
neck. </p>
<p>But he and several team members were eventually sold and kept in
squalid conditions at a dime museum in Los Angeles. After learning of
their plight, an Ohio businessman spearheaded an effort to raise money
to bring them to Cleveland, a city in Ohio. After dying in 1933, Balto
was mounted and placed on display at the Cleveland Museum of Natural
History. </p>
<p>Iditarod pays homage to run </p>
<p>Today, the most famous mushing event in the world is the Iditarod
Trail Sled Dog Race, which is not based on the serum run but on the
Iditarod Trail, a supply route from Seward to Nome. Iditarod organizers
are nevertheless marking the serum run’s centennial with a series of
articles on its website and by selling replicas of the medallions each
serum run musher received a century ago, race spokesperson Shannon
Noonan said in an email. This year’s Iditarod starts March 1. </p>
<p>“The Serum Run demonstrated the critical role sled dogs played in the
survival and communication of remote Alaskan communities, while the
Iditarod has evolved into a celebration of that tradition and Alaska’s
pioneering spirit,” Noonan said.</p>

id="what-to-know-about-the-ntsb-the-agency-investigating-the-dc-plane-crash">What
to know about the NTSB, the agency investigating the DC plane crash</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — A collision between an American Airlines passenger jet
and an Army helicopter near Washington, D.C., that killed 67 people
brought renewed focus on the federal agency charged with investigating
aviation disasters.</p>
<p>National Transportation Safety Board Chairwoman Jennifer Hommendy has
described the investigation into the crash as an “all-hands-on-deck
event” for the agency.</p>
<p>Here are some things to know about the NTSB:</p>
<p>What does the agency do?</p>
<p>The NTSB is an independent federal agency responsible for
investigating all civil aviation accidents as well as serious incidents
in the U.S. involving other modes of transportation, such as railroad
disasters and major accidents involving motor vehicles, marine vessels,
pipelines and even commercial space operators.</p>
<p>“We’re here to ensure the American people that we are going to leave
no stone unturned in this investigation,” Homendy said, noting the probe
is in the very early stages. “We are going to conduct a thorough
investigation of this entire tragedy, looking at the facts.”</p>
<p>The agency has five board members who serve five-year terms and are
nominated by the president and confirmed by the U.S. Senate.</p>
<p>How will the investigation work?</p>
<p>For the investigation into Wednesday’s crash, the NTSB will establish
several different working groups, each responsible for investigating
different areas connected to the accident, board member Todd Inman
said.</p>
<p>Inman said those groups include operations, which will examine flight
history and crewmember duties; structures, which will document airframe
wreckage and the accident scene; power plants, which will focus on
aircraft engines and engine accessories; systems, which will study the
electrical, hydraulic and pneumatic components of the two aircraft; air
traffic control, which will review flight track surveillance
information, including radar, and controller-pilot communications;
survival factors, which will analyze the injuries to the crew and
passengers and crash and rescue efforts; and a helicopter group.</p>
<p>The investigation also will include a human-performance group that
will be a part of the operations, air traffic control and helicopter
groups and will study the crew performance and any factors that could be
involved such as human error, including fatigue, medications, medical
histories, training and workload, Inman said.</p>
<p>How long will the investigation take?</p>
<p>NTSB officials did not say Thursday how long the investigation would
take, but accident investigations often take between one to two years to
complete. The agency typically releases a preliminary report within a
few weeks of the accident that includes a synopsis of information
collected at the scene.</p>
<p>What is the NTSB’s history?</p>
<p>The NTSB history dates to 1926, when Congress passed a law charging
the U.S. Department of Commerce with investigating aircraft accidents.
It was established as an independent agency within the U.S. Department
of Transportation in 1967 and then separated by Congress in 1974 as a
stand-alone organization, fully independent from any other federal
agencies. Since its creation in 1967, the agency reports it has
investigated more than 153,000 aviation accidents and incidents.</p>

id="trumps-funding-block-hits-program-for-burmese-students-scholars">Trump’s
funding block hits program for Burmese students, scholars</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to block $45
million in U.S. federal funding for over 400 Burmese students has left
many in shock and dismay as their scholarships were abruptly
canceled.</p>
<p>The move also has raised concerns about the broader impact it could
have on Burmese in Myanmar, a country already grappling with political
turmoil and a collapsing education system under military rule.</p>
<p>Students in limbo</p>
<p>One Burmese student who studies at Chiang Mai University in Thailand
told VOA that she feels completely lost after learning that her
scholarship was being blocked.</p>
<p>“To be honest, I am lost because of this sudden loss of my
scholarship. I had been studying with the goal of earning a degree, and
now I don’t know what to do,” she said. The student spoke with VOA on
condition of anonymity because she fears for her safety if she returns
to Burma, which remains under military control.</p>
<p>She said students like her and others at different academic levels
are now left without financial support.</p>
<p>“There are students doing two-year master’s degrees, others in
four-year bachelor’s programs, and even PhD students. I don’t know
whether I should continue my studies, go home, or what my next step
should be,” she said.</p>
<p>An email sent to recipients of the program, which was shared with
VOA’s Burmese Service, stated that USAID had “exercised its right to
terminate” the Development and Inclusive Scholarship Program as of
Jan. 29, 2025. The email expressed “surprise and disappointment” over
the decision and assured students that officials are “looking closely at
next steps.” It did not confirm whether the scholarship would continue,
though, for those who already had received it.</p>
<p>DISP originally was called the Diversity and Inclusion Scholarship
Program but was recently renamed by USAID, replacing “Diversity” with
“Development.”</p>
<p>DISP was created to support Burmese students from marginalized and
underprivileged backgrounds, giving them opportunities to study at
universities across Asia, including the Philippines, Cambodia, Indonesia
and Thailand. The program also provided funding for online education
through the University of Arizona.</p>
<p>For many, the initiative was their only chance to pursue higher
education outside of Burma, where the junta-controlled education system
has systematically restricted access for those opposing the military
regime.</p>
<p>For some students, the immediate impact has been less severe.</p>
<p>Hlwan Paing Thi Ha, who has been studying at Chiang Mai University
for a year, told VOA: “My education has already been paid for through
the scholarship program, so it hasn’t impacted me yet. Other students
pursuing bachelor’s, master’s and PhD degrees will be severely
affected.”</p>
<p>Future leaders affected</p>
<p>One source who has in-depth understanding of the program said the
impact goes beyond just access to education and opportunities. The
source spoke with VOA on condition of anonymity because they are not
authorized to speak with the media.</p>
<p>More than a quarter of the Burmese students in the program have fled
Myanmar due to the military coup, ongoing fighting and forced
conscription, which has targeted youth.</p>
<p>“The impact is huge,” the source said, adding that currently, more
than 400 Burmese students are attending universities in four countries —
the Philippines, Cambodia, Indonesia and Thailand — through the
USAID-funded program.</p>
<p>“Of these, 110 were directly recruited from Myanmar, while the rest
are students who fled to border regions and Southeast Asian countries
due to the military coup or boycotted Myanmar’s junta-controlled
education system,” the source said.</p>
<p>The program, which was launched in February 2024, was designed as a
five-year initiative, with plans to recruit three batches of students
over that period.</p>
<p>“The goal was to ensure that at least 1,000 Burmese students, the
‘current and future leaders of the country,’ could continue their
studies in universities across the region. The second batch, which would
include hundreds of students, is now in the final stage of the screening
process,” the source explained.</p>
<p>Debate continues</p>
<p>In Washington, a debate over the block and review continues.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the State Department issued a waiver that exempts some
humanitarian aid from the freeze. U.S. lawmakers have also voiced
concerns, warning that the freeze will impact American soft power and
give China an advantage.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Trump defended the funding freeze, specifically calling
out the $45 million allocated for diversity scholarships for Burmese
students.</p>
<p>“We also blocked $45 million for diversity scholarships in Burma.
Forty-five — that’s a lot of money for diversity scholarships in Burma.
You can imagine where that money went,” Trump said. “These were the
types of payments and many others. I could stand here all day and tell
you about things that we found, and we have to find them quickly because
we want the money to flow to proper places.”</p>
<p>Name threatens its demise?</p>
<p>Some note that in addition to the freeze, the name of the program may
also leave it in a difficult position, with some worrying that the
mention of diversity in its title could impact a substantive review of
its impact.</p>
<p>The source with direct knowledge of the initiative for Burmese
students told VOA that the program was swiftly terminated when the Trump
administration began reducing foreign aid, and that its name, “Diversity
and Inclusion,” likely played a major role in its elimination.</p>
<p>“This program was one of the first to be cut as soon as the
administration began making budget reductions in this area,” the source
said.</p>
<p>While all USAID-funded programs have been temporarily frozen, DISP
appears to have been specifically blocked without any review, the source
noted.</p>
<p>“USAID officials have not been able to explain why this program was
halted so suddenly.”</p>
<p>VOA reached out to the State Department to verify whether the
Diversity and Inclusion Scholarship Program was permanently blocked or
still under review, and whether its name played a role in its swift
termination.</p>
<p>In an email response to VOA, a State Department spokesperson referred
to the president’s executive order on reevaluating and realigning United
States foreign aid and the department spokesperson’s statement on its
implementation.</p>
<p>The spokesperson reiterated Secretary of State’s Marco Rubio’s
remarks during his confirmation hearing, emphasizing the U.S. government
will ensure taxpayer dollars are spent wisely and in the best interest
of America.</p>
<p>The response did not clarify, however, whether DISP was individually
reviewed before being blocked or if existing scholarship recipients
would be allowed to complete their studies under prior funding
commitments.</p>
<p>Lifeline for ethnic, religious minorities</p>
<p>The source with direct knowledge of the program also voiced concern
the administration may not understand that the program has no connection
to Myanmar’s military junta and was created solely to support young
people who lost their education due to military oppression.</p>
<p>The Diversity and Inclusion Scholarship Program was established to
reflect Burma’s ethnic and religious diversity, giving equal
opportunities to students from all backgrounds who have historically
faced discrimination under the Burman-dominated and military-controlled
education policies. Burman is the name of the main ethnic group in
Myanmar.</p>
<p>Many recipients of the scholarship program belong to ethnic minority
groups such as the Karen, Kachin, Shan, Chin and Rohingya, who have
historically faced systemic discrimination in Burma’s education
system.</p>
<p>Nyein Chan from VOA’s Burmese Service contributed to this report.</p>

id="health-data-pages-wiped-from-federal-websites-as-trump-officials-target-gender-ideology">Health
data, pages wiped from federal websites as Trump officials target
‘gender ideology’</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Public health data disappeared from websites, entire webpages went
blank and employees erased pronouns from email signatures Friday as
federal agencies scrambled to comply with a directive tied to President
Donald Trump’s order rolling back protections for transgender
people.</p>
<p>The Office of Personnel Management directed agency heads to strip
“gender ideology” from websites, contracts and emails in a memo sent
Wednesday, with changes ordered to be instituted by 5 p.m. Friday. It
also directed agencies to disband employee resource groups, terminate
grants and contracts related to the issue, and replace the term “gender”
with “sex” on government forms.</p>
<p>Some parts of government websites appeared with the message: “The
page you’re looking for was not found.” Some pages disappeared and came
back intermittently.</p>
<p>Asked by reporters Friday about reports that government websites were
being shut down to eliminate mentions of diversity, equity and
inclusion, Trump said he didn’t know anything about it but that he’d
endorse such a move.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. That doesn’t sound like a bad idea to me,” Trump said,
adding that he campaigned promising to stamp out such initiatives.</p>
<p>Much public health information was taken down from the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention’s website: contraception guidance; a fact
sheet about HIV and transgender people; lessons on building supportive
school environments for transgender and nonbinary kids; details about
National Transgender HIV Testing Day; a set of government surveys
showing transgender students suffering higher rates of depression, drug
use, bullying and other problems.</p>
<p>Eliminating health resources creates dangerous gaps in scientific
information, disease experts said. The Infectious Diseases Society of
America, a medical association, issued a statement decrying the removal
of information about HIV and people who are transgender. Access is
“critical to efforts to end the HIV epidemic,” the organization’s
leaders said.</p>
<p>A Bureau of Prisons web page originally titled “Inmate Gender” was
relabeled “Inmate Sex” on Friday. A breakdown of transgender inmates in
federal prisons was no longer included.</p>
<p>The State Department on Friday removed the option to select “X” as a
gender on passport applications for nonbinary applicants. It also
replaced the word “gender” from the descriptor with the word “sex.”</p>
<p>All State Department employees were ordered to remove gender-specific
pronouns from their email signatures. The directive, from the acting
head of the Bureau of Management, said this was required to comply with
Trump’s executive orders and that the department was also removing all
references to “gender ideology” from websites and internal
documents.</p>
<p>“All employees are required to remove any gender identifying pronouns
from email signature blocks by 5:00 PM today,” said the order from Tibor
Nagy. “Your cooperation is essential as we navigate these changes
together.”</p>
<p>An official from the U.S. Agency for International Development said
staffers were directed to flag the use of the word “gender” in each of
thousands of award contracts. Warnings against gender discrimination are
standard language in every such contract. The official spoke on
condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal, under a Trump
administration gag order prohibiting USAID staffers from speaking with
people outside their agency.</p>
<p>The official said staffers fear that programs and jobs related to
inclusion efforts, gender issues and issues specific to women are being
singled out and possibly targeted under two Trump executive orders.</p>
<p>Some Census Bureau and National Park Service pages were also
inaccessible or giving error messages.</p>
<p>Trump’s executive order, signed on his first day back in office,
calls for the federal government to define sex as only male or female
and for that to be reflected on official documents such as passports and
policies such as federal prison assignments.</p>
<p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the military to immediately
stop recognizing identity a day before the start of February’s Black
History Month, saying they “erode camaraderie and threaten mission
execution.”</p>

id="at-least-7-people-dead-in-philadelphia-plane-crash-officials-say">At
least 7 people dead in Philadelphia plane crash, officials say</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA — At least seven people died when a
medevac plane crashed in Philadelphia on Friday, including six Mexicans
aboard the plane and one person who was on the ground, Mexico’s
president and Philadelphia’s mayor said on Saturday. </p>
<p>Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker told a press conference that the
person who died on the ground had been in a car at the site of the
crash. </p>
<p>“Thus far, our count is that there are 19 injured victims,” Parker
said. </p>
<p>Separately, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said in a post on X
that she had asked consular officials to support the families of the six
Mexican citizens who were on the plane and died when it crashed. </p>
<p>Jet Rescue Air Ambulance, based in Mexico and licensed to operate in
the United States, on Friday said its aircraft crashed with four crew
members, one pediatric medical patient and the patient’s mother on
board. </p>
<p>The child was a girl who had just completed treatment for a
life-threatening condition at Shriners Children’s Hospital and was on
her way home with a destination of Tijuana, Shai Gold, who works on
corporate strategy with Jet Rescue Air Ambulance, told CNN on Friday.
Her mother was also aboard, he said.</p>
<p>Gold said the aircraft was operated by a seasoned crew and everyone
involved in the company’s flights goes through rigorous training.</p>
<p>“When an incident like this happens, it’s shocking and surprising,”
Gold told The Associated Press. “All of the aircraft are maintained. Not
a penny is spared because we know our mission is so critical.”</p>
<p>Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro said at a news conference late
Friday that officials expected fatalities in the “awful aviation
disaster.”</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Temple University Hospital-Jeanes Campus, Jennifer
Reardon, said they had treated six people with injuries related to the
crash. Three of those people had since been released and the others were
in fair condition. She wasn’t able to provide information about their
injuries or where the people were when they sustained them.</p>
<p>The crash came just two days after the deadliest U.S. air disaster in
a generation. On Wednesday night, an American Airlines jet carrying 60
passengers and four crew members collided in midair in Washington with
an Army helicopter carrying three soldiers. There were no survivors.</p>
<p>The Philadelphia crash was the second fatal incident in 15 months for
Jet Rescue. In 2023, five crewmembers were killed when their plane
overran a runway in the central Mexican state of Morelos and crashed
into a hillside.</p>
<p>In Philadelphia, a doorbell camera captured video of the plane
plunging in a streak of white and exploding as it hit the ground near a
shopping mall and major road.</p>
<p>“All we heard was a loud roar and didn’t know where it was coming
from. We just turned around and saw the big plume,” said Jim Quinn, the
owner of the doorbell camera.</p>
<p>The crash happened less than 5 kilometers from Northeast Philadelphia
Airport, which primarily serves business jets and charter flights.</p>
<p>The Learjet 55 quickly disappeared from radar after taking off from
the airport at 6:06 p.m. and climbing to an altitude of 487 meters. It
was registered to a company operating as Med Jets, according to the
flight tracking website Flight Aware.</p>
<p>Shortly after 6 p.m., audio recorded by LiveATC captured an air
traffic controller telling “Medevac Medservice 056” to turn right when
departing. About 30 seconds later it repeats the request before asking,
“You on frequency?” Minutes later, the controller says, “We have a lost
aircraft. We’re not exactly sure what happened, so we’re trying to
figure it out. For now the field is going to be closed.”</p>
<p>In a post on the social media platform Truth Social, U.S. President
Donald Trump said, “So sad to see the plane go down in
Philadelphia.”</p>
<p>“More innocent souls lost,” he said. “Our people are totally
engaged.”</p>
<p>The FAA said the National Transportation Safety Board will lead the
investigation. The NTSB said an investigator arrived Friday and more
officials would be there Saturday.</p>

box’ recovered from helicopter involved in Washington midair
collision</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. investigators say the “black box” recorder from an Army Black
Hawk helicopter was recovered Friday, as teams continue to search for
clues into the midair collision that killed 67 people near
Washington.</p>
<p>The Army helicopter and a commercial passenger jet collided late
Wednesday as the jet was attempting to land at Ronald Reagan Washington
National Airport.</p>
<p>Investigators said Friday evening that they are reviewing the flight
data recorder along with two from the plane that they found Thursday as
they try to understand what caused the crash over the Potomac River.</p>
<p>National Transportation Safety Board member J. Todd Inman told
reporters Friday the helicopter’s recorder appeared to be intact.</p>
<p>“We saw no exterior damage that would indicate it was compromised at
this time, so we have a high level of confidence we’ll have a full
extraction,” he said.</p>
<p>The NTSB is the federal agency leading the investigation into the
accident.</p>
<p>The commercial jet, a Bombardier CRJ700 regional craft operated by
American Airlines subsidiary PSA Airlines, carried 64 passengers and
crew, while the U.S. Army UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter carried a crew of
three. Officials say there were no survivors.</p>
<p>Fire and emergency service officials in Washington said Friday that
41 bodies have been recovered from the wreckage. Authorities said that
they would likely be unable to extricate more victims from the plane
without heavier equipment.</p>
<p>Inman said that barges from Virginia Beach will arrive Saturday to
begin more extensive salvage operations. He said rescue workers will
also make sure that the victims are recovered.</p>
<p>U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy announced Friday that
most helicopters would not be allowed to travel through and near Reagan
National Airport for the time being.</p>
<p>He wrote on social media platform X, “Today’s decision will
immediately help secure the airspace near Reagan Airport, ensuring the
safety of airplane and helicopter traffic.”</p>
<p>Speaking Friday before the helicopter’s black box was found, U.S.
Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the recorder would likely determine
who was piloting the helicopter at the time of the crash.</p>
<p>He said Thursday that the helicopter crew, which was conducting a
night-flight training evaluation, included a staff sergeant, a
captain-in-training, and a chief warrant officer, who was an instructor.
The crew had been issued night vision goggles for the flight, but
Hegseth said it was unclear if they were using them.</p>
<p>The defense secretary said the black box also could determine who was
in communication with the airport’s air traffic control tower and if
there was any confusion regarding the instructions they received.</p>
<p>Hegseth also said Thursday that the helicopter’s altitude at the time
of the accident was under investigation.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump said Friday that the Army helicopter was
flying too high at the time of the crash.</p>
<p>“It was far above the 200 foot limit. That’s not really too
complicated to understand, is it???” Trump said in a Friday morning post
on his Truth Social platform.</p>
<p>Citing a government report, The Washington Post reported Thursday
that the control tower was understaffed Wednesday night. The report said
two people were handling the jobs of four inside the tower at the time
of the collision.</p>
<p>A similar report from U.S. broadcaster NBC News, citing a source
familiar with the investigation, said a supervisor in the tower let an
air traffic controller leave their shift early before the collision.</p>
<p>That decision, the report said, left one controller to handle both
airplane traffic and helicopter traffic in the area, whereas typically
there is one controller looking at each type of aircraft.</p>
<p>The NBC report said it is allowable under Federal Aviation
Administration standards for one person to do both jobs, although it is
not considered optimal.</p>
<p>At a news conference Thursday, both Virginia U.S. Senators Tim Kaine
and Mark Warner said they had expressed concerns over the years
regarding the high volume of air traffic in the Washington area, but
that they would await results from the accident probe before revisiting
that specific concern.</p>
<p>During a White House news conference Thursday, Trump suggested
previous presidential administrations, led by Democratic Presidents
Barack Obama and Joe Biden, lowered standards for the hiring of air
traffic controllers and blamed diversity, equity and inclusion, DEI,
initiatives in the federal government for that.</p>
<p>He said he reversed those initiatives with executive orders last
week.</p>
<p>The U.S. Figure Skating organization said several members of its
community, including athletes, coaches and family members, were among
the passengers on the plane.</p>
<p>“We are devastated by this unspeakable tragedy and hold the victims’
families closely in our hearts,” the organization said.</p>
<p>The Kremlin and Russian media said Russian figure skaters, including
world champion couple Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov, also were on
the plane. Trump said his administration would facilitate the return of
their remains to Russia.</p>
<p>Some information for this report was provided by The Associated
Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.</p>

id="venezuela-frees-6-americans-after-meeting-between-maduro-trump-envoy">Venezuela
frees 6 Americans after meeting between Maduro, Trump envoy</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CARACAS, VENEZUELA — Six Americans who had been detained in Venezuela
in recent months were freed by the government of President Nicolas
Maduro after he met Friday with a senior Trump administration
official.</p>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump and his envoy for special missions,
Richard Grenell, announced the release of the six men on social media.
Grenell posted on X a photo showing him and the men aboard an
aircraft.</p>
<p>Grenell’s trip to Venezuela, according to the White House, was
focused on Trump’s efforts to deport Venezuelans back to their home
country, which currently does not accept them, and on the release of the
detained Americans.</p>
<p>“We are wheels up and headed home with these 6 American citizens,”
Grenell wrote on X. “They just spoke to <span class="citation"
data-cites="realDonaldTrump">@realDonaldTrump</span> and they couldn’t
stop thanking him.”</p>
<p>The visit by Grenell came as a shock to many Venezuelans who hoped
that Trump would continue the “maximum pressure” campaign he pursued
against the authoritarian Venezuelan leader during his first term.</p>
<p>Mauricio Claver-Carone, Trump’s special envoy to Latin America,
previewed Grenell’s visit to Caracas in a conference call with
journalists on Friday. He said Grenell, who served as U.S. ambassador to
Germany and acting director of national intelligence during Trump’s
first term, was in Venezuela on a “very specific mission” that in no way
detracts from the Trump administration’s goal of restoring democracy in
the South American nation.</p>
<p>“I would urge the Maduro government, the Maduro regime in Venezuela,
to heed special envoy Ric Grenell’s message,” said Claver-Carone,
himself a former top national security aide to Trump during his first
administration. “Ultimately there will be consequences otherwise.”</p>
<p>The visit comes less than a month after Maduro was sworn in for a
third six-year term despite credible evidence that he lost last year’s
election by a more than 2-to-1 margin. The U.S. government, along with
several other Western nations, does not recognize Maduro’s claim to
victory.</p>
<p>Venezuelan state television aired footage of Grenell and Maduro
speaking in the Miraflores Palace in Caracas, the capital, and said the
meeting had been requested by the U.S. government.</p>
<p>Signing an executive order in the Oval Office on Friday, Trump was
asked if Grenell being filmed meeting with Maduro lent legitimacy to an
administration that the Trump White House hasn’t official
recognized.</p>
<p>“No. We want to do something with Venezuela. I’ve been a very big
opponent of Venezuela and Maduro,” Trump responded. “They’ve treated us
not so good, but they’ve treated, more importantly, the Venezuelan
people, very badly.”</p>
<p>Some Republicans criticized the visit.</p>
<p>“This is terrible timing,” said Elliott Abrams, who served as special
envoy to Venezuela and Iran during the first Trump administration. “A
meeting with Maduro will be used by him to legitimize his rule and show
that the Americans recognize him as president. If the purpose is to
deliver a tough message about migration issues, the president could’ve
done that himself. There was no need to send someone to Caracas.”</p>
<p>Among those detained are as many as 10 Americans. Neither the White
House nor Maduro’s government immediately released the names of the six
who were freed Friday.</p>
