return to the Potomac River to recover wreckage from DC midair
collision</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Arlington — Crews were on the scene on the Potomac River on Monday to
retrieve the submerged wreckage of an airliner and an Army helicopter
that collided midair in the deadliest U.S. air disaster since 2001.</p>
<p>Authorities have recovered and identified 55 of the 67 people killed
in the crash and Washington, D.C., Fire and EMS Chief John Donnelly has
said they are confident all will be found.</p>
<p>Crews were expected to begin the work of lifting the wreckage on
Monday and at daybreak they could be seen aboard a vessel with a crane.
More than 300 responders were taking part in the recovery effort at a
given time, officials said.</p>
<p>Two Navy barges were also deployed to lift heavy wreckage. Divers and
salvage workers are adhering to strict protocols and will stop moving
debris if a body is found, Col. Francis B. Pera of the Army Corps of
Engineers said Sunday.</p>
<p>The “dignified recovery” of remains takes precedence over all else,
he said.</p>
<p>Portions of the two aircraft that collided over the river Wednesday
night near Reagan Washington National Airport — an American Airlines jet
with 64 people aboard and an Army Black Hawk helicopter with 3 aboard —
will be loaded onto flatbed trucks and taken to a hangar for
investigation.</p>
<p>The crash occurred when the jet, en route from Wichita, Kansas, was
about to land. The Black Hawk was on a training mission. There were no
survivors.</p>
<p>On Sunday, family members were taken in buses with a police escort to
the Potomac River bank near where the two aircraft came to rest after
colliding. The plane’s passengers included figure skaters returning from
the 2025 U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Wichita and a group of
hunters returning from a guided trip.</p>
<p>Army Staff Sgt. Ryan Austin O’Hara, 28, of Lilburn, Georgia; Chief
Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Loyd Eaves, 39, of Great Mills, Maryland; and
Capt. Rebecca M. Lobach, of Durham, North Carolina, were in the
helicopter.</p>
<p>Federal investigators were working to piece together the events that
led to the collision.</p>
<p>Full investigations typically take a year or more. Investigators hope
to have a preliminary report within 30 days. Wednesday’s crash was the
deadliest in the U.S. since Nov. 12, 2001, when a jet slammed into a New
York City neighborhood just after takeoff, killing all 260 people on
board and five on the ground.</p>
<p>Experts stress that plane travel is overwhelmingly safe, but the
crowded airspace around Reagan Airport can challenge even experienced
pilots.</p>

<li>Trump tariffs on Canada and Mexico loom
</h3>
<p>
On Saturday evening, President Trump signed orders placing 25% tariffs
on all goods imported from Canada and Mexico, and a lower, 10% tariff on
Canadian oil, natural gas, uranium, and other energy sources. Trump also
imposed a 10% tariff on all goods imported from China. If the tariffs go
into effect tomorrow as planned, they will affect nearly half of
America’s imports and reshape some of the world’s most important energy
and trading relationships. They could shrink the United States’ GDP by
0.4%, while increasing taxes by $830 per household, according to

gasoline in the Midwest and Mountain West</strong>, where Canadian oil
plays a much larger role in local markets. They will hurt diesel and jet

from First Street. Extreme weather is causing insurance costs to rise,
while also changing the desirability of certain areas. This convergence
“suggests there may be fundamental restructuring of home values across
the U.S. in the coming decades,” with property values expected to fall
across the country. Some statistics from the report:
</p>
<p>
<strong>55 million</strong> – Total number of Americans expected to
voluntarily relocate to avoid climate risks by 2055.<br/><strong>5.2
million</strong> – Americans expected to do so this
year.<br/><strong>12.8 million</strong> – Americans expected to relocate
because of wildfire smoke particulate matter by 2055. Nearly 12 million
will move because of flooding, 14.7 million because of extreme heat, and
11 million due to drought.<br/><strong>31%</strong> – increase in the
cost of homeowners insurance since 2019.<br/><strong>22%</strong> – rise
in inflation during the same time.<br/><strong>322%</strong> – expected
increase in Miami’s insurance premiums by 2055. Florida’s premiums have
already gone up by 47% in just five years due to intensifying
hurricanes.<br/><strong>73%</strong> – share of Americans that consider
climate risks when buying a home.<br/><strong>4,107</strong> –
neighborhoods currently classified as “climate resilient,” with low
climate risks and stable insurance rates. These neighborhoods are
expected to drive much of the population growth through 2055. However,
high-risk areas with rising insurance premiums are also projected to
grow until they reach a “tipping point” into population
decline.<br/><strong>21,750</strong> – “climate abandonment”
neighborhoods that are seeing premiums go up and populations go down.
These represent 26% of all neighborhoods.<span></span>

id="south-africa-defends-itself-against-trump-and-musk-attacks-on-land-policy">South
Africa defends itself against Trump and Musk attacks on land policy</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>JOHANNESBURG — South Africa defended itself on Monday against attacks
on its land confiscation policy by Donald Trump and his South
African-born billionaire backer Elon Musk after the U.S. president said
he would cut off funding to the country over the issue. </p>
<p>Trump said on Sunday, without citing evidence, that “South Africa is
confiscating land” and “certain classes of people” were being treated
“very badly.” </p>
<p>“I will be cutting off all future funding to South Africa until a
full investigation of this situation has been completed!” he said. </p>
<p>South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said the government had not
confiscated any land, and he looked forward to engaging with Trump to
foster a better understanding over the matter. </p>
<p>The United States committed nearly $440 million in assistance to
South Africa in 2023, the most recent U.S. government data showed. The
lion’s share of the sum, $315 million, was for HIV/AIDS. </p>
<p>Ramaphosa said U.S. funding accounted for 17% of South Africa’s
HIV/AIDS program but it was reliant on “no other significant funding”
from the United States. </p>
<p>The president signed into law a bill last month to make it easier for
the state to expropriate land in the public interest, despite objections
by some parties in his ruling coalition. The law aims to address stark
racial disparities in land ownership that persist three decades after
the end of apartheid in 1994. </p>
<p>“The recently adopted Expropriation Act is not a confiscation
instrument, but a constitutionally mandated legal process that ensures
public access to land in an equitable and just manner as guided by the
constitution,” the presidency said. </p>
<p>The question of land reform is highly politically charged in South
Africa due to the legacy of the colonial and apartheid eras, when Black
people were dispossessed of their lands and denied property rights. </p>
<p>Musk, the world’s richest person and a South African-born U.S.
citizen who has Trump’s ear and more than 200 million followers on the X
social media platform that he owns, quickly waded into the dispute. </p>
<p>“Why do you have openly racist ownership laws?” he said in a post on
X, responding to Ramaphosa who had posted the presidency statement. He
was apparently suggesting white people were the victims of the racism he
alleged. </p>
<p>Ramaphosa’s spokesperson Vincent Magwenya urged Musk to talk
constructively with the South African president. </p>
<p>“My brother, you would know that owing to a devastating legacy of
centuries of oppressive and brutal colonialism and apartheid, our
constitution provides for redressing the ills of the past,” he
said. </p>
<p>Under the Expropriation Act, special conditions have to be met before
expropriating land such as it having longtime informal occupants, being
unused and held purely for speculation, or being abandoned. </p>
<p>South Africa’s rand fell nearly 2% against the dollar early on Monday
after Trump’s remarks. Stocks and the benchmark government bond also
tumbled. </p>
<p>Charles Robertson, an emerging markets specialist at FIM Partners,
said that African countries were relatively well positioned to withstand
an attack by Trump because the United States was a far less important
investor than China and Europe. </p>
<p>But any U.S. measures against South Africa would represent a serious
challenge for Ramaphosa, who has been trying to boost the sluggish
economy and attract foreign investors, he said. </p>
<p>“The difficulty with South Africa is, do you want to set up a factory
in a country where today, Trump’s cutting off all aid. Maybe tomorrow,
he’s ripping up AGOA (a trade deal with Africa) and maybe on Wednesday,
he’s adding 25% tariffs because they’re too close to China,” he
said.</p>

billionaire Elon Musk announced President Donald Trump had agreed with
him to shut the agency.</p>
<p>USAID staffers said they also tracked more than 600 employees who
reported being locked out of the agency’s computer systems overnight.
Those still in the system received emails saying that “at the direction
of Agency leadership” the headquarters building “will be closed to
Agency personnel on Monday, Feb. 3.”</p>
<p>The developments come after Musk, who’s leading an extraordinary
civilian review of the federal government with the Republican
president’s agreement, said early Monday that he had spoken with Trump
about the six-decade U.S. aid and development agency and “he agreed we
should shut it down.”</p>
<p>“It became apparent that its not an apple with a worm it in,” Musk
said in a live session on X Spaces early Monday. “What we have is just a
ball of worms. You’ve got to basically get rid of the whole thing. It’s
beyond repair.”</p>
<p>“We’re shutting it down,” he said.</p>
<p>Musk, Trump and some Republican lawmakers have targeted the U.S. aid
and development agency, which oversees humanitarian, development and
security programs in some 120 countries, in increasingly strident terms,
accusing it of promoting liberal causes.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, the Trump administration placed two top security
chiefs at USAID on leave after they refused to turn over classified
material in restricted areas to Musk’s government-inspection teams, a
current and a former U.S. official told The Associated Press on
Sunday.</p>
<p>Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE, earlier
carried out a similar operation at the Treasury Department, gaining
access to sensitive information including the Social Security and
Medicare customer payment systems. The Washington Post reported that a
senior Treasury official had resigned over Musk’s team accessing
sensitive information.</p>
<p>Democratic lawmakers have protested the moves, saying Trump lacks
constitutional authority to shut down USAID without congressional
approval and decrying Musk’s accessing sensitive government-held
information through his Trump-sanctioned inspections of federal
government agencies and programs.</p>
<p>USAID, whose website vanished Saturday without explanation, has been
one of the federal agencies most targeted by the Trump administration in
an escalating crackdown on the federal government and many of its
programs.</p>
<p>“It’s been run by a bunch of radical lunatics. And we’re getting them
out,” Trump said to reporters about USAID on Sunday night.</p>
<p>Musk’s and Trump’s comments came with Secretary of State Marco Rubio
out of the country, in Central America, on his first trip abroad in
office. Rubio has not spoken publicly about any plans to shut down
USAID.</p>
<p>The Trump administration and Rubio have imposed an unprecedented
freeze on foreign assistance that has shut down much of USAID’s aid
programs worldwide — compelling thousands of layoffs by aid
organizations — and ordered furloughs and leaves that have gutted the
agency’s leadership and staff in Washington..</p>
<p>Peter Marocco, a returning political appointee from Trump’s first
term, was a leader in enforcing the shutdown. USAID staffers say they
believe that agency outsiders with visitors’ badges asking questions of
employees inside the Washington headquarters are members of Musk’s DOGE
team.</p>
<p>Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren said in a post on Sunday that Trump
was allowing Musk to access people’s personal information and shut down
government funding.</p>
<p>“We must do everything in our power to push back and protect people
from harm,” the Massachusetts senator said, without giving details.</p>

<h2 id="who-proposes-budget-cut-after-us-exit-defends-its-work">WHO
proposes budget cut after US exit, defends its work</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>London — World Health Organization member states will discuss cutting
part of its budget by $400 million in light of President Trump’s move to
withdraw the United States, its biggest government funder, from the
agency, a document released on Monday showed.</p>
<p>Opening the agency’s annual executive board meeting, WHO Director
General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also defended the agency’s work and
recent reforms and reiterated a call for the U.S. to reconsider its exit
and enter into dialog with the WHO about further change.</p>
<p>“We would welcome suggestions from the United States, and all member
states, for how we can serve you and the people of the world better,” he
said.</p>
<p>The budget cut will be discussed at the Feb. 3-11 Geneva meeting,
during which member state representatives will discuss the agency’s
funding and work for the 2026-2027 period.</p>
<p>The executive board proposes cutting the base programs section of the
budget from a proposed $5.3 billion to $4.9 billion, according to a
document released on Monday. That is part of the wider $7.5 billion
budget for 2026-2027 that was originally proposed, including money for
polio eradication and tackling emergencies.</p>
<p>“With the departure of the biggest financial contributor, the budget
could not be ‘business as usual,’” the document reads. The U.S. is the
WHO’s biggest government donor, contributing around 18% of its overall
funding. The WHO has already separately taken some cost-cutting steps
after the U.S. move.</p>
<p>However, some board representatives also wanted to send a message
that the WHO would preserve its strategic direction despite the
challenges, the document adds.</p>
<p>The $4.9 billion is roughly the same as the base program budget for
the previous period, 2024-2025.</p>
<p>Trump moved to exit the WHO on his first day in office two weeks ago.
The process will take one year under U.S. law.</p>

id="eu-leaders-to-huddle-on-defense-against-russia-economy-and-us">EU
leaders to huddle on defense against Russia, economy, and US</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BRUSSELS — European Union leaders gather on Monday to discuss how to
bolster the continent’s defenses against Russia and how to handle U.S.
President Donald Trump after his decision to impose tariffs on goods
from Canada, Mexico and China.</p>
<p>At a royal palace-turned-conference center in Brussels, the leaders
of the EU’s 27 nations will also lunch with NATO Secretary General Mark
Rutte and dine with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.</p>
<p>Antonio Costa, the president of the European Council of EU leaders,
has billed the one-day gathering as a “retreat” devoted to defense
policy rather than a formal summit, aiming for an open discussion
without any official declaration or decisions.</p>
<p>The first session focuses on geopolitics and relations with the
United States, meaning Trump’s sweeping weekend move on tariffs is
certain to come up – particularly as EU officials fear they may soon
face similar measures.</p>
<p>Trump, who began his second term as president on Jan. 20, will also
be a major factor in the talks on defense, as he has demanded that
European nations spend much more on their own protection and rely less
on the United States via the NATO security alliance.</p>
<p>Trump’s call for EU member Denmark to cede Greenland to the United
States - and his refusal to rule out military action or economic
pressure to force Copenhagen’s hand - has also added strains to
trans-Atlantic ties.</p>
<p>The EU leaders are expected to discuss what military capabilities
they need in the coming years, how they could be funded and how they
might cooperate more through joint projects.</p>
<p>“Europe needs to assume greater responsibility for its own defense,”
Costa said in a letter to the leaders. “It needs to become more
resilient, more efficient, more autonomous and a more reliable security
and defense actor.”</p>
<p>Finding funding</p>
<p>The funding discussion will be especially tough, according to
diplomats, as many European countries have little room in their public
finances for big spending hikes.</p>
<p>Some countries, such as the Baltic states and France, advocate joint
EU borrowing to spend on defense. But Germany and the Netherlands are
staunchly opposed.</p>
<p>One compromise could be to borrow to finance loans rather than grants
for defense projects, according to some diplomats.</p>
<p>European countries have ramped up defense spending in recent years,
particularly since Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which brought war
to the EU’s borders.</p>
<p>But many EU leaders have said they will need to spend even more.
Trump has said NATO’s European members should spend 5% of GDP on defense
- a figure no member of the alliance including the United States
currently reaches.</p>
<p>Last year, EU countries spent an average of 1.9% of GDP on defense -
about $334.48 billion, according to EU estimates.</p>
<p>That is a 30% increase from 2021, according to the EU. But it also
masks wide divergences among EU countries.</p>
<p>Poland and the Baltic states are among the biggest defense spenders
in GDP terms, with Warsaw leading the pack at more than 4.1%, according
to NATO estimates. But some of the EU’s biggest economies such as Italy
and Spain spend much less - about 1.5% and 1.3% respectively.</p>

id="netanyahu-to-meet-with-us-middle-east-envoy-to-open-us-visit">Netanyahu
to meet with US Middle East envoy to open US visit</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to meet Monday with
U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff during a visit to Washington
focused on Israel’s ceasefire with Hamas and other regional issues.</p>
<p>Netanyahu’s office said he and Witkoff would discuss Israel’s
ceasefire positions.</p>
<p>The talks come as negotiations are expected to open this week on the
second phase of the ceasefire, with the two sides needing to agree on
matter such as the release of the remaining hostages held by Hamas and
an end to the conflict that began in October 2023.</p>
<p>Witkoff is due to follow his Netanyahu talks by speaking with
officials from Egypt and Qatar, the other two nations that have led the
ceasefire negotiations.</p>
<p>Netanyahu is scheduled to meet Tuesday with U.S. President Donald
Trump, and said those talks would include the war against Hamas,
countering Iranian aggression and expanding diplomatic relations with
Arab countries.</p>
<p>Trump has been a staunch supporter of Israel but also pledged to end
wars in the Middle East and took credit for helping to broker the
ceasefire agreement. </p>
<p>During the first phase of the ceasefire, which lasts six weeks, Hamas
has freed 18 hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners
held by Israel.</p>
<p>Hamas, a U.S. designated terror group, has quickly reasserted its
control over Gaza since the ceasefire took hold last month, despite
Israel saying it would not allow that to occur. The militants have said
they will not release more hostages slated to go free in the second
phase of the truce without an end to the war and the full withdrawal of
Israeli forces from the narrow territory along the shores of the
Mediterranean Sea. </p>
<p>Netanyahu is under mounting pressure from far-right governing
partners to resume the war after the first phase of the truce ends in
early March. </p>
<p>It’s not clear where Trump stands. </p>
<p>Netanyahu has said Israel is still committed to a full victory over
Hamas and the return of all the hostages captured in the militants’
shock Oct. 7, 2023, attack that killed 1,200 people and led to the
capture of 250 hostages. Several dozen remain in Hamas hands, both
living and dead. </p>
<p>Israel’s counteroffensive during 15 months of warfare has killed more
than 47,400 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children.
Israel’s military says the death toll includes 17,000 militants it has
killed. </p>
<p>Even with the ceasefire, periodic attacks are still occurring. </p>
<p>An Israeli airstrike on a vehicle in central Gaza wounded five people
on Sunday, including a child who was in critical condition, according to
Al-Awda Hospital, which received the casualties. The Israeli military
said it fired upon the vehicle because it was bypassing a checkpoint
while heading north in violation of the ceasefire agreement.</p>
<p>Trump brokered normalization agreements between Israel and four Arab
countries in his first term. He now is seeking a wider agreement in
which Israel would forge ties with Saudi Arabia. </p>
<p>But Riyadh has said it would only agree to such a deal if the war in
Gaza ends and there is a credible pathway to a Palestinian state in
Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories Israel captured in
the 1967 Middle East war. </p>
<p>The U.S. supports Palestinian statehood, but Netanyahu’s government
is opposed. </p>
<p>Even as the Gaza ceasefire has mostly held for two weeks, Israel has
ramped up operations in the occupied West Bank. On Sunday, the military
said it was expanding an operation focused on the volatile city of
Jenin, to the town of Tamun. </p>
<p>The West Bank has seen a surge in violence since the start of the war
in Gaza, with Israel launching near-daily military arrest raids. There
has also been a rise in settler violence against Palestinians and
Palestinian attacks on Israelis. </p>
<p>Some material in this report came from The Associated Press and
Reuter</p>

id="trump-to-speak-with-canadian-mexican-leaders-after-imposing-new-tariffs">Trump
to speak with Canadian, Mexican leaders after imposing new tariffs</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump said he planned to speak Monday with the
leaders of Canada and Mexico, days after announcing tariffs on goods
from those countries and China that have were met with pledges of
retaliatory tariffs and other actions.</p>
<p>The new tariffs affect the top three U.S. trading partners, but Trump
said the move would be “worth the price” to bolster U.S. interests.</p>
<p>Despite a free-trade pact he negotiated with Canada and Mexico in his
first term in office, Trump on Saturday imposed 25% tariffs on the two
countries set to take effect Tuesday, and hit China with a new 10% levy
in addition to already enacted tariffs. </p>
<p>Trump claimed the three countries were not doing enough to halt
illegal immigration and the deadly opioid fentanyl from entering the
United States. </p>
<p>In Truth Social posts early Sunday, Trump acknowledged American
consumers could face higher prices because of the tariffs.</p>
<p>U.S. companies that pay the tariffs to the federal government to
import goods from other countries then often pass on at least part, if
not all, of their higher costs to consumers rather than absorb their
extra expenses themselves. </p>
<p>Trump aimed most of his comments at Canada, targeting one of the
closest U.S. allies. The U.S. Census Bureau said the U.S. had a $55
billion trade deficit with Canada last year. </p>
<p>“Why? There is no reason,” Trump contended. “We don’t need anything
they have. We have unlimited Energy, should make our own Cars, and have
more Lumber than we can ever use.” </p>
<p>“Without this massive subsidy, Canada ceases to exist as a viable
Country. Harsh but true! Therefore, Canada should become our Cherished
51st State. Much lower taxes, and far better military protection for the
people of Canada — AND NO TARIFFS!” Trump said. </p>
<p>He said, “Canada, Mexico, China, and too many others to name,
continue the decades long RIPOFF OF AMERICA, both with regard to TRADE,
CRIME, AND POISONOUS DRUGS that are allowed to so freely flow into
AMERICA. THOSE DAYS ARE OVER!” </p>
<p>With the new tariffs, Trump said, “Will there be some pain? Yes,
maybe (and maybe not!) But we will Make America Great Again, and it will
all be worth the price that must be paid.” </p>
<p>Trump aides had previously shied from acknowledging that tariffs
could raise U.S. consumer prices. Nationwide polls in the U.S. showed
that consumer frustration over rising prices during the last four years
were a major factor in his November election victory over Democrat
Kamala Harris. </p>
<p>Trump has since acknowledged that it will not be easy to curb higher
grocery prices. Trump put the new tariff on energy imports from Canada
at 10%, apparently seeking to limit an increase in fuel and electricity
prices. </p>
<p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Saturday that his country
would hit back with 25% percent levies of its own on select American
goods worth $106.6 billion, with a first round on Tuesday followed by a
second one in three weeks. </p>
<p>Leaders of several Canadian provinces have already announced
retaliatory actions as well, such as the immediate halt of U.S. liquor
purchases, and more specifically, orange juice produced in the U.S.
state of Florida, whiskey in Tennessee and peanut butter in Kentucky,
three states Trump won in last November’s election and all represented
by Republicans, like Trump, in the U.S. Senate. </p>
<p>Kirsten Hillman, the Canadian ambassador to the U.S., told ABC’s
“This Week” show, “We’re really disappointed” and “perplexed” by Trump’s
actions and said she hoped that Trump would back off before Tuesday. But
she acknowledged that “it’s really in the president’s hands” whether
that happens. </p>
<p>She said that “less than 1% of illegal immigrants” entering the U.S.
travel across its northern border with Canada. She said Canada has
invested “in a lot of equipment” to curb unauthorized border crossings
and conducted joint exercises with the U.S. to catch migrants. </p>
<p>“It’s hard to know what more we could do,” she said. “We’re not at
all interested in escalating” a trade war with the U.S., where she said
99% of the trade is currently tariff-free. “We’re eager to build on
that.” </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said she had directed
her economy minister to “implement Plan B,” which includes
yet-unspecified “tariff and non-tariff measures in defense of Mexico’s
interests,” without specifying what U.S. goods her government will
target.  </p>
<p>U.S. exports to Mexico totaled more than $322 billion in 2023, Census
Bureau data showed, while the U.S. imported more than $475 billion worth
of Mexican products. </p>
<p>Sheinbaum assailed Trump’s contention that her government had joined
forces with drug cartels, a claim he made in announcing the tariff
increases. </p>
<p>“We categorically reject the White House’s slanderous claim that the
Mexico government has alliances with criminal organizations, as well as
any attempt to intervene in our territory,” Sheinbaum wrote on X. “If
there is anywhere that such an alliance in fact exists, it is in the
United States gun factories that sell high-powered weapons to these
criminal groups.” </p>
<p>China denounced the new tariffs on its exports, with Beijing saying
it would challenge them at the World Trade Organization and take
unspecified “countermeasures.” The U.S. had a $279 billion trade deficit
with China in 2023, the largest figure for any of its trading
partners. </p>
<p>That response stopped short of the immediate escalation that had
marked China’s trade showdown with Trump during his first term as
president. </p>
<p>China’s commerce ministry said in a statement that Trump’s move
“seriously violates” international trade rules, urging the U.S. to
“engage in frank dialogue and strengthen cooperation.” </p>
<p>Trump also has often threatened new tariffs against the European
Union. A spokesperson for the bloc said Sunday that it would “respond
firmly to any trading partner that unfairly or arbitrarily imposes
tariffs.”</p>

id="beyoncé-wins-album-of-the-year-at-the-2025-grammys-for-cowboy-carter">Beyoncé
wins album of the year at the 2025 Grammys for ‘Cowboy Carter’</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — Beyoncé won album of the year for “Cowboy Carter” at
Sunday’s Grammys, delivering her — at last — the show’s elusive top
award.</p>
<p>The superstar, who is both the most awarded and nominated artist in
Grammys history, has been up for the category four times before and many
feel she has been snubbed by its top honors.</p>
<p>In winning album of the year with “Cowboy Carter,” Beyoncé has become
the first Black woman to win the top prize in the 21st century. The last
was Lauryn Hill with “The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill” 26 years ago.
Before her was Natalie Cole and Whitney Houston. That means Beyoncé is
only the fourth Black woman to win album of the year at the Grammys.</p>
<p>Members of the Los Angeles Fire Department presented Beyoncé with the
trophy, one of several times the show reflected the recent wildfires
that burned thousands of homes.</p>
<p>“It’s been many, many years,” Beyoncé said in her speech. “I want to
dedicate this to Ms. Martell,” she said, referencing Linda Martell, the
performer who became the first Black woman to play the Grand Ole
Opry.</p>
<p>“We finally saw it happen, everyone,” host Trevor Noah said, nodding
to the long overdue achievement for one of music’s transcendent
artists.</p>
<p>Kendrick Lamar won song and record of the year for his diss track
“Not Like Us,” taking home two of the night’s most prestigious
awards.</p>
<p>“We’re gonna dedicate this one to the city,” Lamar said before
shouting out Los Angeles area neighborhoods.</p>
<p>It is the second hip-hop single to ever win in the category. The
first was Childish Gambino’s “This Is America.”</p>
<p>The Weeknd mends fences, Chappell Roan challenges music industry</p>
<p>The Weeknd has mended his fractious relationship with the Grammy
Awards with a surprise performance of his new single, “Cry For Me” and
“Timeless” with Playboi Carti.</p>
<p>His decision is a direct reflection of the changes the Recording
Academy has made to diversify its voting body, CEO Harvey Mason jr. said
in his introduction. The Weeknd has been openly critical of the Grammys
organization, dating back to 2020 when he wrote on Twitter: “The Grammys
remain corrupt.”</p>
<p>It was just one of many pleasant surprises Sunday night. Chappell
Roan was named best new artist.</p>
<p>She read a speech from a notebook, speaking directly to major labels
and the music industry, instructing them to “offer a living wage and
healthcare, especially to developing artists.” She described getting
signed as a minor, getting dropped and entering the workforce during
COVID-19 with no work experience and no health care. She asked them to
treat artists like “valuable employees.”</p>
<p>“Labels, we got you,” she concluded her speech. “But do you got
us?”</p>
<p>Beyoncé and Chappell Roan give Grammys a country theme</p>
<p>In one of the biggest moments of the evening so far, Taylor Swift
presented the award for best country album to Beyoncé. She became the
first Black woman to ever win in the category.</p>
<p>“Genre is a cold word to keep us in our place as artists,” she said
in her speech. “I’m still in shock. Thank you so much for this
honor.”</p>
<p>Beyoncé entered the night as the leading nominee.</p>
<p>A little bit of the wild west, a little bit of West Hollywood. Roan
brought a rocking version of her “Pink Pony Club” to the Grammy stage.
Joined by a posse of dancing clown cowboys, she sang from atop a giant
pink horse.</p>
<p>Los Angeles on the mind</p>
<p>In incorporating the wildfires throughout the show, the Grammys put
the spotlight on the city’s resiliency.</p>
<p>Noah’s opening speech was dedicated to those affected by the fires,
promising a show that not only celebrates them, but one that also
celebrates “the city that brought us so much of that music.” The Grammys
have also allotted ad time to be used by local businesses affected by
the fires.</p>
<p>As the show neared its end, Noah announced that viewers had
contributed $7 million to relief efforts Sunday night so far.</p>
<p>On a stage set up to look like the mountains of Los Angeles, the LA
born-and-raised Billie Eilish and her brother/collaborator Finneas
performed her hit “Birds of a Feather.” It was one of a number of ways
the show seeks to salute the city. “We love you LA,” she told the crowd
at the end of the set.</p>
<p>The show kicked off with a powerful opening performance of Randy
Newman’s “I Love L.A.” by Dawes — whose members were directly affected
by the Eaton fire — backed by John Legend, Brad Paisley, Sheryl Crow,
Brittany Howard and St. Vincent.</p>
<p>Star studded performances and victories</p>
<p>The first televised award went to Doechii for best rap album for
“Alligator Bites Never Heal.”</p>
<p>The tears were immediate. “This category was introduced in 1989. Two
women have won, Lauryn Hill —” she said, correcting herself. “Three
women have won. Lauryn Hill, Cardi B and Doechii.”</p>
<p>Will Smith introduced a tribute to the late, great, legendary
producer Quincy Jones. “In his 91 years, Q touched countless lives, but
I have to say he changed mine forever,” he said. “You probably wouldn’t
even know who Will Smith was without Quincy Jones.”</p>
<p>Jones died in November at age 91. Kicked off by Cynthia Erivo,
accompanied by Herbie Hancock on piano, the “Wicked” star sang Frank
Sinatra’s “Fly Me to the Moon.” Then came Lainey Wilson and Jacob
Collier with “Let the Good Times Roll,” followed by Stevie Wonder and
Hancock busting out “Bluesette” and “We Are The World.” For the latter,
they were joined by student singers from two schools that were lost in
the LA-area fires.</p>
<p>Then, Janelle Monae with an inspired rendition of “Don’t Stop ’Til
You Get Enough,” channeling Michael Jackson in a sparkly tuxedo and an
effortless moonwalk.</p>
<p>The Beatles’ “Now and Then,” which used AI technology, took home best
rock performance. Sean Lennon accepted the award on behalf of his father
John Lennon. “As far as I’m concerned, it’s the best band of all time,”
he said of the Beatles.</p>
<p>First time winners were abundant. They included Carpenter, Roan,
Doechii, Charli xcx, songwriter Amy Allen, Música Mexicana star Carin
León, French metal band Gojira and country folk artist Sierra
Ferrell.</p>
<p>The Red Hot Chili Peppers’ Anthony Kiedis and Chad Smith led the
crowd in a short singalong of their hit “Under the Bridge,” reminding
the crowd to “support their friends and neighbors as they rebuild their
lives,” said Kiedis. Then they presented the best pop vocal album award
to Carpenter for “Short n’ Sweet.”</p>
<p>“I really wasn’t expecting this,” she said. “This is, woo, my first
Grammy so I’m going to cry.” (She’s now won two, but the earlier award
was handed out a pre-telecast ceremony that many artists don’t attend.)
She also performed.</p>
<p>Winners use speeches to lift marginalized communities in tense
political climate</p>
<p>Shakira won Latin pop album for “Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran” and gave a
powerful, short speech. “I want to dedicate this award to all my
immigrant brothers and sisters in this country,” she said.</p>
<p>Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars teamed up for a cover of “California
Dreamin’.” Later, SZA presented them with the award for best pop
duo/group performance for “Die With A Smile.”</p>
<p>“Trans people are not invisible. … The queer community deserves to be
lifted up,” Gaga said in her speech.</p>
<p>Alicia Keys was awarded the Dr. Dre Global Impact Award “DEI is not a
threat, it’s a gift,” she said in her speech, referencing diversity,
equity and inclusion programs that have been scrapped recently by the
U.S. government and several major corporations.</p>

id="fbi-staff-ordered-to-reveal-their-roles-in-jan.-6-capitol-riot-probes-by-monday">FBI
staff ordered to reveal their roles in Jan. 6 Capitol riot probes by
Monday</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — FBI employees were ordered Sunday to answer a detailed
list of questions about any work they may have done on criminal cases
related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by supporters of
President Donald Trump, stoking fear among staff about a fresh round of
firings at the law enforcement agency.</p>
<p>“I know myself and others receiving this questionnaire have a lot of
questions and concerns, which I am working hard to get answers to,” Chad
Yarbrough, the assistant director of the Criminal Investigative Division
at FBI headquarters, wrote in a weekend email seen by Reuters.</p>
<p>The list of questions in the memo, seen by Reuters, direct employees
to give their job title, any role they played in the Jan. 6
investigations and whether they helped supervise such investigations.
Yarbrough told employees the answers are due by 3 p.m. ET (2000 GMT) on
Monday</p>
<p>Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove on Friday fired eight senior
FBI officials from agency headquarters as well as the heads of the Miami
and Washington, D.C., field offices.</p>
<p>Another memo written by Bove on Friday also demanded that the FBI by
Tuesday at noon ET (1700 GMT) turn over to him a list of every employee
who worked on Jan. 6 cases, as well as a list of those who worked on a
criminal case filed last year against leaders of the militant Hamas
group in connection with the Gaza war.</p>
<p>Bove last week fired more than a dozen career Justice Department
prosecutors who worked on the two now-dismissed criminal cases brought
by Special Counsel Jack Smith against Trump, one involving actions taken
to try to overturn the 2020 election results and the other involving
classified government documents.</p>
<p>A FBI spokesperson declined to comment on the questionnaire.</p>
<p>Democrats and other critics have said Trump’s team is carrying out a
purge of FBI and Justice Department officials who played roles in the
criminal cases against Trump and the Jan. 6 rioters.</p>
<p>On Trump’s first day back in office on Jan. 20, he commuted the
sentences of 14 people in connection with the Capitol attack and
pardoned the rest — including those who violently attacked law
enforcement officers.</p>
<p>Acting FBI Director Brian Driscoll, in an email Friday to staff
announcing details about the order from Bove, said the request
“encompasses thousands of employees across the country who have
supported these investigative efforts.”</p>
<p>“I am one of those employees, as is acting Deputy Director [Robert]
Kissane,” Driscoll noted.</p>
<p>Despite reports about other firings throughout the bureau, emails
seen by Reuters from both the FBI Agents Association and from James
Dennehy, the assistant FBI director in charge of the New York office,
made it clear that no one else had been asked to resign.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, some employees started to clear out their desks Friday
amid concerns they might be next, according to the FBI Agents
Association email seen by Reuters.</p>
<p>“Today, we find ourselves in the middle of a battle of our own, as
good people are being walked out of the FBI and others are being
targeted because they did their jobs in accordance with the law and FBI
policy,” Dennehy wrote Friday, saying he gave credit to Driscoll and
Kissane for “fighting for this organization.”</p>
<p>Dennehy added that other than the select group of people named in
Bove’s memo, “NO ONE has been told they are being removed at this
time.”</p>

<h2 id="late-president-jimmy-carter-wins-posthumous-grammy">Late
President Jimmy Carter wins posthumous Grammy</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Los Angeles — Former President Jimmy Carter has won a posthumous
Grammy award. </p>
<p>Carter, the peanut farmer who won the presidency in the wake of the
Watergate scandal and Vietnam War, died in December at age 100. Prior to
his passing, Carter was nominated in the audio book, narration, and
storytelling recording category at the 2025 Grammys for “Last Sundays in
Plains: A Centennial Celebration,” recordings from his final Sunday
School lessons delivered at Maranatha Baptist Church in Georgia.
Musicians Darius Rucker, Lee Ann Rimes and Jon Batiste are featured on
the record. </p>
<p>It’s Carter’s fourth Grammy. His posthumous Grammy joins his three
previous ones for spoken word album. </p>
<p>If the former president won before his death, he would’ve become the
oldest Grammy award winner in history. </p>
<p>Jason Carter, Jimmy Carter’s grandson, received the award on his
behalf. “Having his words captured in this way for my family and for the
world is truly remarkable,” he said in an acceptance speech. “Thank you
to the academy.” </p>
<p>In the category, Jimmy Carter beat out Barbra Streisand, George
Clinton, Dolly Parton and producer Guy Oldfield. </p>
<p>If Streisand had won instead of Carter, it would have been her first
Grammy win in 38 years. </p>
<p>Currently, the oldest person to win a Grammy was 97-year-old Pinetop
Perkins in 2011.</p>

id="amid-los-angeles-wildfires-clean-up-residents-furious-over-hazardous-waste">Amid
Los Angeles wildfires clean-up, residents furious over hazardous
waste</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Duarte, California — Not far from where Ceci Carroll lives, a
rock-mining company has polluted the air with dust across the San
Gabriel Valley, she said. </p>
<p>Now, as crews clean charred remains from the Los Angeles wildfires,
she worries about a new potential source of contamination: a site to
process hazardous debris from the Eaton Fire. </p>
<p>“I’m concerned about the community and also the school districts
here, where we have children,” said Carroll, a Duarte resident of 23
years and former local school board member. </p>
<p>“We’re dealing with the site with the chemicals and hazardous
materials,” she said. “Parents are absolutely concerned.” </p>
<p>Carroll is among residents from Duarte, Azusa and nearby cities
opposing the Environmental Protection Agency’s use of Lario Park in
Irwindale as a temporary site to separate, package and transport
potentially hazardous materials from the Eaton Fire. </p>
<p>In ordinary times, people picnic, bike or ride horses on equestrian
trails in the federally owned land. They now worry about dangerous waste
that could pollute the air or seep into groundwater. </p>
<p>The blazes that began on Jan. 7 charred thousands of buildings, cars
and electronics across the Los Angeles area. The EPA has begun the
enormous task of removing potentially hundreds of tons of hazardous
materials from the Eaton and Palisades fires. That includes paints,
pesticides, solvents, compressed gas cylinders, ammunition and
lithium-ion batteries from electric cars that could turn toxic when
burned. </p>
<p>“The removal of these materials should not come at the cost of
creating a toxic environment for communities already disproportionately
impacted by pollution,” Los Angeles County Supervisor Hilda Solis said
in a statement. </p>
<p>The mostly Latino communities adjacent to the site are exposed to
higher levels of ozone and particulate matter pollution than other
areas, according to data from the California Office of Environmental
Health Hazard Assessment. </p>
<p>Experts acknowledge residents’ concerns, but say hazardous waste is
not necessarily harmful as long as safety measures are in place and the
waste is not stored on site for years. </p>
<p>Residents have questions about waste site </p>
<p>At a town hall Wednesday, California Sen. Susan Rubio and local
mayors opposing the site grilled state and federal officials: How was
the site chosen? Why weren’t we consulted or notified? Why truck toxic
waste 24 kilometers from the burn zone and risk contaminating our
communities? What testing will be done after it’s closed? </p>
<p>Hundreds of residents crammed into the performing arts center and
spilled into the hall. They shouted “Shut it down!” and chanted “Leave
it in Altadena!” </p>
<p>EPA coordinator Tara Fitzgerald told the audience that sites closer
to the Eaton burn zone were being used for emergency fire operations,
including the Rose Bowl and the Santa Anita Park in Pasadena. They chose
the Lario Park site because it suited their needs and was
available. </p>
<p>She emphasized that the EPA has done this work for years across the
state. </p>
<p>“We did the exact same thing” for the Woolsey, Santa Rosa and Napa
fires, Fitzgerald said, and “we did not have any impacts to the
community during the entire process.” </p>
<p>But the Eaton and Palisades fires are unprecedented. Together, they
torched the largest urban area on record in California, according to an
Associated Press analysis, and more than double the urban acreage
consumed by the 2018 Woolsey Fire. </p>
<p>EPA says protective measures being taken </p>
<p>The EPA said it would regularly monitor air, sample soil, use water
trucks to control dust and transport waste out of the area daily. </p>
<p>The agency lines areas with plastic where materials are processed and
uses wattles, earthen berms and other items to control spills. The waste
will be transported on surface streets, not freeways, so trucks can
travel at a slower and safer speed, the EPA’s Celeste McCoy told the
county Board of Supervisors. She said the site would likely be used less
than six months, and more areas are being considered. </p>
<p>With these protective measures, the risks of groundwater
contamination, which takes a long time, are low, said Sanjay Mohanty, a
UCLA associate professor who has studied wildfire effects on water and
soil. </p>
<p>“There’s several feet of soil that the pollutant has to pass through,
and that also requires lots of water to leech from the system,” Mohanty
said. “And even if there is leeching, they would not migrate far into
the soil in a short time.” </p>
<p>The bigger risks are soil and air pollution from possible dust
emissions, he added, but those too can be mitigated. </p>
<p>Residents should stay vigilant </p>
<p>Duarte resident Laura Jasso did not leave the meeting reassured and
remained upset about the lack of transparency from state and federal
officials. </p>
<p>“It’s hard to have confidence when they’ve really done this behind
our backs,” she said. </p>
<p>While crews continue their work, residents should be vigilant to what
is happening at the site and ask how materials are being handled, about
emergency response plans and truck routes and schedules, said Rachael
Jones, professor and director of the UCLA Center for Occupational and
Environmental Health. </p>
<p>“The community has the right to know that information from the EPA
and the Army Corps,” Jones said. </p>
<p>Jasso said her community is committed to holding the EPA accountable
for ensuring safety. </p>
<p>“Ultimately, we don’t want it here, and we’re going to continue to
fight to not have it here,” she said of the site. “But the fact is, it’s
here right now. And so, we have to just acknowledge the safety of our
students, the concerns of our families.”</p>

recalls baby teething sticks over possible choking hazard</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Arlington, Virginia — A baby food maker is recalling edible sticks
meant to ease teething pain over a possible choking hazard. </p>
<p>Gerber announced Friday that it was recalling and discontinuing its

<h2 id="new-orleans-super-bowl-gets-beefed-up-security-measures">New
Orleans Super Bowl gets beefed up security measures</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New Orleans, Louisiana — After a New Year’s Day attack struck at the
heart of the French Quarter, officials in New Orleans say they are
confident in the security plans they have in place for the Super
Bowl.</p>
<p>Upwards of 125,000 visitors are expected to converge on the Big Easy
beginning Feb. 5 for parties, concerts and revelry featuring artists
including Post Malone and Diplo and capped off by the Feb. 9 clash
between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles at the
Caesars Superdome stadium to crown this season’s NFL champion.</p>
<p>Following the truck-ramming attack early on Jan. 1 that killed 14
people and injured dozens more along Bourbon Street, one of the city’s
most famous thoroughfares, alleged security lapses triggered multiple
lawsuits and investigations. But the city, the NFL and law enforcement
officials insist that after more than a year of preparations they are
ready to play host.</p>
<p>“We’re going above and beyond what we’ve seen in the past when we’ve
hosted previously,” Mayor LaToya Cantrell said at a news conference. “We
know we’re safer than we’ve ever been before.”</p>
<p>What will the security presence look like?</p>
<p>Thousands of state, federal and local law enforcement officers will
be on the ground during the Super Bowl, NFL Chief Security Officer Cathy
Lanier said. But she and city officials remained tight-lipped about
details.</p>
<p>Drones will be prohibited around the Superdome and downtown New
Orleans throughout the week of the game and there will be flight
restrictions up to 18,000 feet (5,486 meters), according to the Federal
Aviation Administration.</p>
<p>Armed federal air marshals will be stationed around the city’s
transportation hubs scanning for suspicious people or activities and
guarding against drones, said Noel Curtin, supervisory air marshal in
charge with the Transportation Security Administration.</p>
<p>Super Bowl events will sprawl across neighborhoods far beyond the
stadium, said the Homeland Security Department’s Eric DeLaune, who is
leading federal coordination of Super Bowl security.</p>
<p>Federal agencies from the FBI to the Secret Service are bringing in
rooftop snipers and BearCat armored SWAT vehicles around the stadium and
across the city’s historic French Quarter and downtown, DeLaune
said.</p>
<p>No one will be allowed inside the cordoned-off area surrounding the
Superdome without credentials, and the city already has begun shutting
down and limiting traffic on roads near the stadium, where the perimeter
will include blast barriers requiring trucks to pass through giant X-ray
machines typically used at border crossings, DeLaune said.</p>
<p>Dozens of technicians and more than 100 bomb-sniffing dogs are
engaging in a days-long effort to scour the 37,161 square meters
(400,000 square feet) of the Superdome and each of its more than 70,000
seats prior to game day, DeLaune said.</p>
<p>“They’re going to go from top to bottom on that building to make sure
it’s clear and it’s safe. They open every door, check under every seat,”
DeLaune said.</p>
<p>How the New Year’s Day attack has changed security plans</p>
<p>Multiple lawsuits have claimed city authorities were aware of Bourbon
Street’s vulnerabilities to the kind of truck-ramming attack that the
Islamic State group-inspired Shamsud-Din Jabbar carried out. He drove
his F-150 around a police car parked as a makeshift barricade and plowed
into pedestrians before he crashed and was killed by police.</p>
<p>The bollard system of steel columns installed to block vehicle
traffic, which was being replaced at the entrance to Bourbon Street at
the time of the attack, remains on track for completion before the Super
Bowl, officials said.</p>
<p>Authorities say they have brought in more types of physical barriers
to protect entry points resulting from concerns that the new bollard
system was not strong enough to block vehicle attacks.</p>
<p>The NFL and federal and city agencies have “put a fresh set of eyes”
on their plans post-Jan. 1, DeLaune said, noting the New Orleans Police
Department hired former New York City Police Commissioner William
Bratton and his team from high-profile security firm Teneo.</p>
<p>“No specific or credible threats” have surfaced targeting the Super
Bowl, NFL security chief Lanier said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry announced the creation of an “enhanced
security zone” along Bourbon Street to bookend Super Bowl weekend and
said he would deploy 350 national guardsmen.</p>
<p>After authorities found Jabbar had planted ice chests containing
undetonated improvised explosive devices around the French Quarter,
Landry declared a ban on coolers and ice chests in these areas and
ordered mandatory searches of bags for anyone entering Bourbon Street
zone during the Super Bowl weekend.</p>
<p>But in accordance with state law, firearms including permitless
concealed carry guns will be allowed on Bourbon Street, Louisiana State
Police Sgt. Katharine Stegall said, noting they remained banned from
bars.</p>
<p>AI and mobile apps will play security role</p>
<p>The Superdome’s owner, ASM Global, has contracted New York-based
artificial intelligence firm Dataminr to monitor potential and emerging
threats in real time.</p>
<p>The company will draw from over 1 million sources of public data
across 150 languages, from social media to dark web forums to traffic
cameras, Dataminr Chief Security Officer Robert Crowley said.  </p>
<p>“It’s stitching together all these little pieces of the puzzle to get
a holistic, comprehensive view of what has just happened,” Crowley said.
“The faster you know what is occurring, the quicker you can take better
action.”</p>

<h2
id="of-67-victims-of-air-disaster-near-washington-recovered-and-identified-officials-say">55
of 67 victims of air disaster near Washington recovered and identified,
officials say</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Authorities said Sunday they have recovered the remains of 55 of the
67 people killed in the deadliest U.S. air disaster since 2001.</p>
<p>Washington, DC Fire and EMS Chief John Donnelly said at a news
conference that divers still need to find the bodies of 12 more victims
and are committed to the dignified recovery of remains as they prepare
to lift wreckage from the Potomac River as early as Monday morning.</p>
<p>“Reuniting those lost in this tragic incident is really what keeps us
all going,” said Colonel Francis B. Pera of the Army Corps of Engineers.
Portions of the aircraft will be loaded onto flatbed trucks and taken to
a hangar for further investigation.</p>
<p>They spoke hours after families of the victims visited the crash site
just outside Washington, DC, walking along the banks of the Potomac
River near Reagan National Airport to memorialize their loved ones.</p>
<p>Dozens of people arrived in buses with a police escort close to where
an American Airlines jet and an Army Black Hawk helicopter collided
Wednesday, killing all 67 aboard the two aircraft. Federal investigators
were working to piece together the events that led to the crash while
recovery crews were set to pull more wreckage from the chilly water.</p>
<p>Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy on Sunday said he wanted to leave
federal aviation investigators space to conduct their inquiry.</p>
<p>But he posed a range of questions about the crash while appearing on
morning TV news programs.</p>
<p>“What was happening inside the towers? Were they understaffed? … The
position of the Black Hawk, the elevation of the Black Hawk, were the
pilots of the Black Hawk wearing night vision goggles?” Duffy asked on
CNN.</p>
<p>The American Airlines flight with 64 people on board was preparing to
land from Wichita, Kansas. The Army Black Hawk helicopter was on a
training mission and had three soldiers on board. Both aircraft plunged
into the Potomac River after colliding.</p>
<p>The plane’s passengers included figure skaters returning from the
2025 U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Wichita, Kansas, and a group
of hunters returning from a guided trip.</p>
<p>Army Staff Sgt. Ryan Austin O’Hara, 28, of Lilburn, Georgia; Chief
Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Loyd Eaves, 39, of Great Mills, Maryland; and
Cpt. Rebecca M. Lobach, of Durham, North Carolina, were killed in the
helicopter.</p>
<p>The National Transportation Safety Board said Saturday that
preliminary data showed conflicting readings about the altitudes of the
airliner and the Army helicopter.</p>
<p>Investigators also said that about a second before impact, the jet’s
flight recorder showed a change in its pitch. But they did not say
whether that change in angle meant that pilots were trying to perform an
evasive maneuver to avoid the crash.</p>
<p>Data from the jet’s flight recorder showed its altitude as 99 meters,
plus or minus 7.6 meters, when the crash happened Wednesday night, NTSB
officials told reporters. Data in the control tower, though, showed the
Black Hawk 61 meters, the maximum allowed altitude for helicopters in
the area.</p>
<p>The discrepancy has yet to be explained.</p>
<p>Investigators said they hoped to reconcile the difference with data
from the helicopter’s black box, which is taking more time to retrieve
because it became waterlogged after the Black Hawk plunged into the
Potomac. They also said they plan to refine the tower data, which can be
less reliable.</p>
<p>“That’s what our job is, to figure that out,” NTSB member Todd Inman
said.</p>
<p>“This is a complex investigation,” investigator in charge Brice
Banning said. “There are a lot of pieces here. Our team is working hard
to gather this data.”</p>
<p>Banning said the jet’s cockpit voice recorder captured sound moments
before the crash.</p>
<p>“The crew had a verbal reaction,” Banning said, and the flight data
recorder showed “the airplane beginning to increase its pitch. Sounds of
impact were audible about one second later, followed by the end of the
recording.”</p>
<p>Full NTSB investigations typically take at least a year, though
investigators hope to have a preliminary report within 30 days.</p>
<p>Inman said he has spent hours meeting with victims’ families since
the crash. The families are struggling, Inman said.</p>
<p>“Some wanted to give us hugs. Some are just mad and angry,” Inman
said. “They are just all hurt. And they still want answers, and we want
to give them answers.”</p>
<p>More than 300 responders were taking part in the recovery effort at a
given time, officials said. Two Navy salvage barges were also deployed
to lift heavy wreckage.</p>
<p>On Fox News Sunday, Duffy said the Federal Aviation Administration
was looking into staffing in the Reagan Airport control tower.</p>
<p>Investigators said there were five controllers on duty at the time of
the crash: a local controller, ground controller, assistant controller,
a supervisor and supervisor in training.</p>
<p>According to an FAA report obtained by The Associated Press, one
controller was responsible for helicopter and plane traffic. Those
duties are often divided between two people but the airport typically
combines them at 9:30 p.m., once traffic slows down. On Wednesday, the
tower supervisor combined them earlier, which the report called “not
normal.”</p>
<p>“Staffing shortages for air traffic control has been a major problem
for years and years,” Duffy said, promising that President Donald
Trump’s administration would address shortages with “bright, smart,
brilliant people in towers controlling airspace.”</p>
<p>With the nation already grieving, an air ambulance crashed in
Philadelphia on Friday, killing all six people on board, including a
child returning home to Mexico from treatment, and at least one person
on the ground.</p>
<p>Also Friday, the FAA heavily restricted helicopter traffic around
Reagan National, hours after Trump claimed on social media that the Army
helicopter had been flying higher than allowed.</p>
<p>“It was far above the 200-foot limit. That’s not really too
complicated to understand, is it???” Trump wrote on Truth Social.</p>
<p>Wednesday’s crash was the deadliest in the U.S. since Nov. 12, 2001,
when a jet slammed into a residential neighborhood in the New York City
borough of Queens, just after takeoff from Kennedy Airport. The crash
killed all 260 people on board and five people on the ground.</p>
<p>Experts regularly highlight that plane travel is overwhelmingly safe,
but the crowded airspace around Reagan National can challenge even the
most experienced pilots.</p>

USAID staff ousted as Trump administration dismantles aid agency</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The Trump administration removed two top security
officials at the U.S. Agency for International Development during the
weekend after they tried to stop representatives from billionaire Elon
Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) from gaining access to
restricted parts of the building, three sources said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The action added to the dozens of staff at USAID being removed from
their positions, as President Donald Trump’s team moves to abolish the
agency’s independence and possibly bring it under the control of the
State Department.</p>
<p>Nearly 30 career staff in the agency’s Legislative and Public Affairs
bureau lost access overnight to their emails, at least five sources
said, bringing the total number of senior USAID career staff who have
been put on leave over the past week close to 100.</p>
<p>“DOGE did access the building yesterday,” a senior Senate Democratic
aide said, requesting anonymity to discuss the incident. USAID security
officers tried to turn away DOGE personnel without security
clearances.</p>
<p>“They (security personnel) were threatened with action by the federal
Marshals Service,” the aide said. Following the incident, the director
of USAID security John Voorhees and his deputy were removed from their
positions and put on leave, sources said.</p>
<p>The purge follows more than a week of changes inside USAID,
Washington’s primary agency funding billions of dollars’ worth of
life-saving aid globally. Trump ordered a freeze on almost all U.S.
foreign aid, saying his administration will review spending to ensure
money is distributed in line with his “America First” foreign
policy.</p>
<p>Members of the group from DOGE were allowed to access several secure
spaces, including the office of security and the agency’s executive
secretariat.</p>
<p>There was no record of what information DOGE officials were able to
obtain in those areas, but the offices they accessed included classified
files and personal information about Americans who work at USAID, the
sources said.</p>
<p>Katie Miller, a DOGE spokesperson, said on social media platform X
that no classified material was accessed without proper security
clearances.</p>
<p>Matt Hopson, who was appointed as chief of staff by the Trump
administration, has resigned, five sources familiar with the matter
said. A congressional source said his resignation followed the incident
with DOGE officials. USAID did not respond to a request about
Hopson.</p>
<p>CNN was first to report the incident between USAID and DOGE
officials.</p>
<p>Legal battle looms</p>
<p>Congressional Democrats said the changes appeared to violate U.S.
laws establishing USAID and funding it as a separate agency. Two senior
Senate Democratic aides said lawmakers and staff had been meeting on
Sunday and would meet again on Monday to consider further steps,
including legal action.</p>
<p>Senior Democratic members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
including its chair Jeanne Shaheen, on Sunday sent a letter to U.S.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio seeking an explanation over the incident.
Shaheen said that she was working to gather Democrats and Republicans to
ask for answers.</p>
<p>The global freeze on most of U.S. foreign aid is already sending
shockwaves around the world. Field hospitals in Thai refugee camps,
landmine clearance in war zones, and drugs to treat millions suffering
from diseases such as HIV are among the programs at risk of
elimination.</p>
<p>U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Brian Mast on Sunday said
that he would support moving USAID under the State Department and that
there needs to be “more command and control.’</p>
<p>Asked on CBS’ “Face the Nation” if congressional approval was needed
or whether Trump could act unilaterally, Mast did not answer. The
“purging of people throughout the State Department, other agencies” and
freezing aid were “all very important and necessary steps to make sure
that we secure America,” he said.</p>
<p>The State Department and USAID did not respond to requests for
comment.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, billionaire Trump ally Musk on Sunday continued to slam
USAID in his posts and reposts on his X social network. Trump has
assigned Musk to lead a federal cost-cutting panel with broad oversight
powers. Officials from DOGE have made frequent visits to USAID
headquarters in Washington, according to sources familiar with the
matter.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Musk accused USAID of being “a criminal organization”
without providing any evidence and added “Time for it to die”.</p>
<p>Peter Marocco was appointed as head of the Office of Foreign
Assistance at the State Department and is leading the agency’s sweeping
changes, according to three sources familiar with the matter. Marocco
previously served in Trump’s first administration in the Department of
Defense. The State Department did not respond to questions about
Marocco.</p>
<p>USAID’s website has been down since Saturday afternoon, a sign that
the end is near for the agency, whose funding goes to programs on
everything from women’s health in conflict zones to access to clean
water, HIV/AIDS treatments, energy security and anti-corruption
work.</p>

id="in-us-punxsutawney-phil-sees-his-shadow-predicting-6-more-weeks-of-wintry-weather">In
US, Punxsutawney Phil sees his shadow, predicting 6 more weeks of wintry
weather</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PUNXSUTAWNEY, Pa. — U.S. groundhog Punxsutawney Phil saw his shadow
Sunday and predicted six more weeks of wintry weather, his top-hatted
handlers announced to a raucous, record-sized crowd at Gobbler’s Knob in
Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Phil was welcomed with chants of “Phil, Phil, Phil,” and pulled from
a hatch on his tree stump shortly after sunrise before a member of the
Punxsutawney Groundhog Club read from a scroll in which he boasted:
“Only I know — you can’t trust A.I.”</p>
<p>The woodchuck’s weather forecast is an annual ritual that goes back
more than a century in western Pennsylvania, with far older roots in
European folklore, but it took Bill Murray’s 1993 “Groundhog Day” movie
to transform the event into what it is today, with tens of thousands of
revelers at the scene and imitators scattered around the United States
and beyond.</p>
<p>When Phil is deemed to have not seen his shadow, that is said to
usher in an early spring. When he does see it, there will be six more
weeks of winter.</p>
<p>The crowd was treated to a fireworks show, confetti and live music
that ranged from the Ramones to “Pennsylvania Polka” as they awaited
sunrise and Phil’s emergence. Gov. Josh Shapiro, local and state elected
officials and a pair of pageant winners were among the dignitaries at
the scene.</p>
<p>Self-employed New York gingerbread artist Jon Lovitch has attended
the event for 33 years. “I like the cold, you know, and this is probably
the best and biggest midwinter party in the entire world,” Lovitch said
in Punxsutawney. “And it’s just a really good time.”</p>
<p>Phil has predicted a longer winter far more often than an early
spring, and one effort to track his accuracy concluded he was right less
than half the time. What six more weeks of winter means is
subjective.</p>
<p>Tom Dunkel, president of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club, says there
are two types of people who make the trek to Gobbler’s Knob: the
faithful seeking to validate their beliefs and the doubters who want to
confirm their skepticism.</p>
<p>Phil communicated his forecast to Dunkel through “Groundhog-ese” with
the help of a special cane that Dunkel has inherited as the club’s
leader. It’s not as if he speaks in English words. “He’ll like wink,
he’ll purr, he’ll chatter, he’ll — you know — nod,” Dunkel said.</p>
<p>Attendance is free but it cost $5 to take a bus and avoid a 1.6
kilometer trek from the middle of town to the stage where the prediction
was made, some 123 kilometers northeast of Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>The need for so many buses is why the local schools, where the sports
mascot is the Chucks, close when Groundhog Day falls on a weekday.</p>
<p>Keith Post, his wife and a friend have watched the “Groundhog Day”
movie in each of the past five years and decided this was the time to
make the trip from Ohio to witness the event.</p>
<p>“We booked rooms almost a year in advance and we’re here,” Post said.
“We’re doing it.”</p>
<p>A new welcome center opened four years ago and the club is working on
an elaborate second living space for Phil and family so they can split
time between Gobbler’s Knob and Phil’s longtime home at the town
library. The club also put up large video screens and more powerful
speakers this year to help attendees in the back of the crowd follow the
proceedings.</p>
<p>“It’s a holiday where you don’t really owe anyone anything,” said
A.J. Dereume, who among the club’s 15-member inner circle serves as
Phil’s handler and held him up to loud cheers on Sunday. “You’re
grasping onto the belief, you know, in something that’s just fun to
believe in.”</p>
<p>Jackie Handley agreed a year ago to visit Punxsutawney for the first
time to help a friend check off an item on their bucket list. They were
ready for the subfreezing temperatures. “It’s once in a lifetime — we’re
probably not going to come back. And we have tons of warm clothes,” said
Handley, who lives in Falls Church, Virginia. After the forecast was
made, club members and Phil posed for photos with people from the
crowd.</p>
<p>Phil has a wife, Punxsutawney Phyllis, and two pups born this spring,
Shadow and Sunny, although his family did not join him on stage for the
big event. The groundhog family eats fruits and vegetables, get daily
visits from Dereume and sees a veterinarian at least once a year. The
club’s lore is that Phil is the same woodchuck who has been issuing
weather forecasts for the past century, thanks to an “elixir of life”
that keeps him immortal. “There’s only one Phil, and it’s not something
that can be handed down,” Dunkel said. “Just like Santa Claus and the
Easter Bunny, there’s only one.”</p>
<p>Groundhog Day celebrations, formal and informal, were being held in
many Pennsylvania towns and elsewhere on Sunday. There have been
Groundhog Day events in at least 28 U.S. states and Canadian
provinces.</p>

id="beyonce-competes-for-the-big-prize---again---at-sundays-grammys">Beyonce
competes for the big prize - again - at Sunday’s Grammys</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — The Grammy Awards take center stage in Los Angeles on
Sunday at a celebration that will honor the best of music while
acknowledging the deadly wildfires that scarred a hub of the
industry. </p>
<p>Beyonce will compete for the top Grammy prize of album of the year
with her country record “Cowboy Carter.” The superstar singer has never
won the album trophy despite winning 32 career Grammys, more than any
other musician. </p>
<p>Also in the running for album of the year are megastar Taylor Swift
for “The Tortured Poets Department” and Billie Eilish for “Hit Me Hard
and Soft.” </p>
<p>The ceremony will be broadcast live on CBS starting at 8 p.m. ET
(0100 GMT on Monday) from the Crypto.com Arena in downtown Los Angeles.
Comedian Trevor Noah returns to host the telecast, which will be part
awards show, part fundraiser for musicians and others impacted by the
recent fires. Hundreds of people in the music business were among those
who lost homes in the disaster. </p>
<p>“It will be a little tricky to pull off, but I’m starting to think
they’re going to be able to do it,” said Paul Grein, awards editor at
music publication Billboard. With the fires under control, “people can
take a breather and express gratitude and relief that we made it through
that.” </p>
<p>Eilish and best new artist nominees Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter,
Benson Boone and Teddy Swims are among the night’s scheduled performers.
The show will feature a tribute to Quincy Jones, the prolific music
producer who died in November. </p>
<p>At last year’s Grammys, Beyonce’s husband and rapper Jay-Z argued
that voters had not given proper recognition to Black artists including
his wife. Grammy winners are chosen by the 13,000 singers, songwriters,
producers, engineers and others who make up the Recording Academy. </p>
<p>“I don’t want to embarrass this young lady, but she has more Grammys
than anyone and never won album of the year. So even by your own
metrics, that doesn’t work,” Jay-Z said on stage. </p>
<p>“Cowboy Carter” was viewed by experts and fans as a reclamation and
homage to an overlooked legacy of Black Americans within country music
and culture. It became the first album by a Black woman to land at No. 1
on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart when it was released last
spring. </p>
<p>The Beyonce album was snubbed, however, by voters for the Country
Music Awards in their nominations in September. </p>
<p>The “Cowboy Carter” nomination is Beyonce’s fifth entry in the album
of the year category. Swift has won the honor a record four times,
including last year for “Midnights.” </p>
<p>Beyonce leads all Grammy nominees this year with 11 nods, followed by
Eilish, Charli XCX, Kendrick Lamar and Post Malone with seven
nominations each. Swift landed six nominations and will present one of
the night’s awards. </p>
<p>Beyonce’s other Grammy nods include record and song of the year for
single “Texas Hold ’Em.” </p>
<p>Competitors for song of the year, an award for songwriters, are
Eilish for “Birds of a Feather,” Carpenter for “Please Please Please”
and Roan for “Good Luck, Babe!” </p>
<p>In record of the year, nominees include Carpenter’s “Espresso” and
Swift’s duet with Post Malone, “Fortnight.”</p>

help fellow creators who lost works, archives in L.A. fires</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — Anthony Obi never imagined the night of Jan. 7 would be
the last time he’d step inside his safe haven. </p>
<p>The Houston rapper, known professionally as Fat Tony, has lived in
the Altadena neighborhood for a year and says he and his neighbors were
prepared for heavy winds and perhaps a few days of power outages. </p>
<p>“I totally expected, you know, maybe my windows are going to get
damaged, and I’ll come back in, like, a day or two and just clean it
up,” said the rapper. </p>
<p>But residents like Obi woke up the following morning to news that
thousands of homes and entire neighborhoods had been burned to ash,
destroyed by flames that wiped out large areas of Pacific Palisades and
Altadena. Although the neighborhoods are on opposite ends of the county,
they are known hubs for many of the city’s creative community, housing
filmmakers, actors, musicians and artists of various mediums. </p>
<p>“L.A. is not just rich, famous people who have giant mansions that
were destroyed,” said visual artist Andrea Bowers, who is helping
artists recover. “So many members of our community lost everything. They
lost all their artworks and their archives - that’s irreplaceable, a
lifetime of labor and a lifetime of research.” </p>
<p>“A lot of my collectors lost their homes,” said figurative and
conceptual artist Salomon Huerta, who lost his Altadena home of three
years to the Eaton fire and worries the art scene in L.A. will downsize
as a result of the wildfire. “Before the fire, I was in talks with
certain collectors. And then, after the fire, they’re not in a good
place to talk. I’m hoping that there’s support so that the art scene can
still thrive. But it’s going to be tough.” </p>
<p>Obi and Huerta lost not only personal treasures, business
opportunities and homes but also vital equipment and professional
archives, adding to their emotional burden. </p>
<p>Huerta left behind slides and transparencies of past work that he had
planned to digitize for an upcoming book. </p>
<p>“Everything’s gone,” Obi said. “All of my stuff that is related to
Fat Tony music that was in that house is gone, and it was the motherlode
of it.” </p>
<p>Grief and Hope </p>
<p>Kathryn Andrews never imagined she’d experience another wildfire in
her lifetime. </p>
<p>The conceptual artist was forced to flee her Pacific Palisades
neighborhood as smoke drew near, the second time in four years she’s had
to escape a wildfire. </p>
<p>She lost her Juniper Hills property to the 2020 Bobcat fire, which
burned a large section of rural Los Angeles County. </p>
<p>“I’ve already experienced one home being burned. I think you have a
different focus after that. Maybe we become a little bit less attached
to material things. And we began looking at a bigger long-term picture,
thinking about, you know, how we live together in community, how we live
in relation to the land and how we can work together to solve this,” she
said. </p>
<p>Andrews is the co-founder of relief effort Grief and Hope, which aims
to support creatives financially as they enter the long road ahead and
was founded alongside a group of gallery directors, art professionals
and artists like Bowers, Ariel Pittman, Olivia Gauthier and Julia V.
Hendrickson. </p>
<p>“Our primary goal is getting people triage money for just whatever
the most emergent need is,” said Pittman. </p>
<p>The fundraising effort began shortly after the fires broke out with a
Go Fund Me seeking $500,000. They have now raised over $940,000 of their
new $1 million goal via The Brick, a nonprofit art space. As of Tuesday,
Grief and Hope had received more than 450 inquiries, and Pittman said
the funds would be evenly distributed to applicants. The deadline for
artists to submit a needs survey has concluded, but the relief effort
will continue fundraising until mid-March. </p>
<p>Grief and Hope also has five different groups of volunteers providing
peer-to-peer support, helping with medical needs, safety issues and
renter’s issues, and collecting survey data to better serve their
creative community. </p>
<p>“These are people who already have made very long-term commitments in
their work, including the five of us, towards building community and
building sustainability around artists and art workers in our city and
beyond,” said Pittman. </p>
<p>For Grief and Hope, creating a more sustainable future for artists
throughout the city begins with affordable studio spaces and
housing. </p>
<p>Long road ahead </p>
<p>For photographer Joy Wong, losing her home of eight years meant
losing the beauty of Altadena. She described the overall area as “a
pocket of heaven.” </p>
<p>“I didn’t want to leave,” said Wong, who safely evacuated with her
husband and 2-year-old daughter. “We were just so in love with this
house, and it wasn’t just my house. It was also my studio space.” </p>
<p>Many, like Obi, Wong and Huerta, have started GoFundMe accounts.
Meanwhile, initiatives and relief efforts have popped up around Southern
California, ready to assist with clothing donations, art supplies,
professional equipment for creatives and more. </p>
<p>“I’m applying to everything,” said Obi, who needs to replace his
instruments and recording equipment. </p>
<p>Wong said she’s received much support from family, friends and
colleagues. </p>
<p>“I think I just have to kind of lean on the community and get back
into shooting,” she said. “I got to get all my gear back, too. It’s
going to be a long road, but it’ll be OK.” </p>
<p>Arts scene rebirth </p>
<p>Superchief Gallery co-founder and director Bill Dunleavy said he
believes that this is an opportunity to rebuild long-needed
infrastructure for the arts throughout Los Angeles. </p>
<p>“Quite a lot was lost in the areas affected by the fire. And it’s
going to affect rent prices and studio prices and art markets and
everything else,” said Dunleavy. “I’ve been so impressed with the amount
of compassion that people feel and the sense of duty people have felt to
help with this. … I hope that continues into the coming years.” </p>
<p>Creative director Celina Rodriguez said she hopes freelance artists
and creatives continue to work and shoot production or projects
throughout the city, rather than leaving because of the wildfires. </p>
<p>“Having lost so many locations that we would shoot, typically in
Malibu, Topanga, the Palisades, all throughout, we will have to
absolutely come together and figure out how we can continue working in
Los Angeles … and urge people to shoot productions here,” she said. </p>
<p>Rodriguez and Dunleavy began collecting donations at the Downtown Los
Angeles gallery and within 48 hours transformed it into a bustling
donation center with over 150 volunteers. The duo are now working with
displaced families to make sure their daily needs are being met. </p>
<p>Dunleavy said the relief effort has only encouraged him to take this
work beyond just the donation center and explore the possibilities of
nonprofit work for the community. </p>
<p>“All of our wheels are turning now that we’ve seen the power that
just self-organizing can have.”</p>

The tariffs will go into effect on Tuesday, giving Trump — who revels in
proposing tariffs but has shown some reluctance to impose them for real
— another 48 hours to maneuver. But if the new tariffs do actually bite,
then they will affect nearly half of America’s imports and reshape some
of the world’s most important energy and trading relationships.
</p>
<p>
Every day, millions of barrels of oil and cubic feet of natural gas flow
across the U.S., Canada, and Mexico borders. The three countries have
developed an integrated and harmonized network of pipelines, storage
tanks, and refineries that has helped turn the United States into the
world’s No. 1 producer of oil and natural gas.
</p>
<p>
The tariffs will almost inevitably disrupt that relationship. They may
also upset the millions of dollars’ worth of electricity that shuttles
from Canada to the United States every day across their shared power
grids.
</p>
<p>
The tariffs will prove economically painful, although just how damaging
is hard to know in advance. They could shrink the United States’ GDP by
0.4%, while increasing taxes by $830 per household, according to
<a href="https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/trump-tariffs-trade-war/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>an
analysis</u></a> by the Tax Foundation, a center-right think tank.
Another estimate from
<a href="https://budgetlab.yale.edu" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
Budget Lab at Yale</u></a> says that the tariffs could push up the
personal consumption expenditures price index — the Fed’s chosen
inflation gauge — by 0.75%, reducing the average household’s purchasing
power by $1,200 over the course of a year.

These costs could worsen as Mexico, Canada, and China raise their own
tariffs or trade barriers in retaliation. Late on Saturday, Prime
Minister Justin Trudeau announced that Canada would impose its own 25%
tariffs on CA$155 billion of goods imported from the United States.
</p>
<p>
The economic hit to the U.S. economy could also be much larger than
estimated if some manufacturers respond to higher costs not by hiking
prices, but rather by delaying or shutting down production.
</p>
<p>
We’ve been reporting on the economic impact of these tariffs at Heatmap
over the past week, documenting their potential impacts for
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-canada-oil-tariffs" target="_self"><u>oil
refineries</u></a> and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/canada-tariffs-electricity" target="_self"><u>the
electricity grid</u></a>. But now that the details are here, a few
things stand out.
</p>
<p>
<strong>First, the tariffs on China are qualitatively different from the
tariffs on our North American neighbors — especially Canada.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Chinese tariffs are not new. Trump engaged China in a trade war during
his first term and ultimately reached a handshake agreement, although he
has since said that China did not buy enough American agricultural
products to keep up its end of the bargain. Some of the tariffs Trump
placed on Chinese imports last time — including eye-watering levies on
solar panels — remain in effect; the new 10% tariff will be added to
those figures.
</p>
<p>
What did <em><em>not </em></em>happen last time was a serious,
out-and-out trade war with Canada and Mexico, America’s neighbors and
biggest trading partners. Although Trump entertained the possibility of
Mexican tariffs during the campaign, he did not propose tariffs on
Canadian imports until after his November election.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Second, the tariffs are
</strong><em><strong><em>quantitatively</em></strong></em><strong>
different, too.</strong> The president has not yet explained why he has
placed higher tariffs on Canada and Mexico, who are our allies, than on
China, which is our economic frenemy at best and our geostrategic
adversary at worst. During the campaign, Trump sometimes proposed a
“universal tariff” of 10% to 20% on all American imported goods,
regardless of their country of origin. That proposed universal tariff —
which was seen by some analysts as an extreme and unlikely proposal —
was at a<em><em> lower </em></em>rate than what he is now levying on
North American imports.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Third, this trade war has apparently been concocted and planned
much more haphazardly than the one during Trump’s first term.</strong>
Last time, the U.S. was careful to exempt electronics — iPhones,
laptops, Xboxes — from its levies, as well as other consumer products.
These tariffs do not do so, at least not yet. Nor do they exempt certain
minerals that are essential to manufacturing electric vehicle batteries
or other high-end electronics. (<em><em>Bloomberg </em></em>has reported
that as recently as Friday, Tesla
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-31/tesla-fights-tariffs-on-ev-graphite-putting-musk-at-odds-with-trump" target="_blank"><u>was
lobbying</u></a> for an exemption for graphite, a mineral crucial to
making EV anodes.)
</p>
<p>
<strong>Finally, what is so striking about these tariffs is how they
will be good for almost nobody.</strong>
</p>
<p>
The tariffs will hurt the American oil industry. As I
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-canada-oil-tariffs" target="_self"><u>wrote
earlier this week</u></a>, U.S. energy companies have spent tens of
billions of dollars on special equipment that can refine the sludgy,
sulfurous crude oil extracted in Canada; Canadian companies, in turn,
have sold us that crude oil at a discount and built infrastructure so
that it can be used by the United States.
</p>
<p>
The tariffs will hurt oil refineries. The U.S. refines
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=62624#:~:text=U.S.%20refining%20capacity%20increased%20this,with%20the%20start%20of%202023." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>about
18 million barrels of oil</u></a> a day, but it extracts — even today,
around
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61545" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>its
all-time high</u></a> — only
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=63824#:~:text=An%20average%20of%2013.4%20million,has%20maintained%20each%20year%20since." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>13.5
million barrels</u></a> a day. Most of the difference between what it
refines and what it extracts is made up by heavy crude from Canada and
Mexico, which blends well with the lighter petroleum produced by U.S.
fracking wells. By raising the cost of Canadian and Mexican fuel
imports, the cost of all refined products will rise.
</p>
<p>
The tariffs will hurt anyone who buys gasoline in the Midwest and
Mountain West, where Canadian oil plays a much larger role in local
markets. They will hurt diesel and jet fuel prices in those regions too.
</p>
<p>
But the damage will not be limited to the fossil fuel industry.
</p>
<p>
The tariffs will hurt anyone who uses electricity across the parts of
the country, especially the Northeast, that import large amounts of
electricity from Canada’s roaring hydroelectric plants.
</p>
<p>
The tariffs will hurt home builders and construction companies because
the United States gets its best building-grade lumber from Canada. That
lumber — already made more expensive
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/01/why-climate-change-pushing-lumber-prices/621288/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>by
a climate change-intensified supply crisis</u></a> — will now face
additional taxes at the border.
</p>
<p>
The tariffs will hurt anyone who wants to buy or rent a home in the
United States because the lack of lumber will worsen the housing
shortage and general affordability crisis.
</p>
<p>
They will hurt automakers, who in the past three decades have
constructed sophisticated supply chains spanning North America — a
logistical dance that allows a single vehicle’s components and parts to
cross the U.S., Canadian, and Mexico borders many times on their way to
becoming a final product. They will hurt autoworkers, who depend on that
supply chain. They will even hurt car dealerships, who will respond to
higher prices by selling less inventory.
</p>
<p>
If the dollar rises to accommodate the new tariff level, as some White
House officials have argued, then the tariffs will hurt <em><em>all
</em></em>U.S. domestic manufacturers because their products will become
more expensive, and therefore less competitive on the global market.
</p>
<p>
I am not saying, to be clear, that these tariffs are an economic
catastrophe. We don’t actually know their economic cost yet — perhaps it
will be minimal. But even then, they will still be a stupid waste of
money that will help nobody, and which will make the U.S. economy
neither more complex nor more secure.
</p>
<p>
The tariffs are a warning. As recently as last week, Goldman Sachs
analysts
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/pkrugman.bsky.social/post/3lh5rc7we2c2i" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>put
the risk of tariffs</u></a> at only a 20% chance of actually happening.
They ignored what Trump had said<em> </em>he would do because it struck
them as too implausible, too unwise, too patently harmful. Perhaps in
the next two days they will be proven right. But Trump has begun to
blather about many unwise and harmful ideas — invading Panama (where
Secretary of State Marco Rubio is headed
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/01/us/politics/rubio-panama-canal-trump.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>right
now</u></a>), annexing Greenland, making Canada (somehow) the 51st
state. Many seem even more implausible than these tariffs, and yet
Donald Trump says that he wants to do them, too. How much longer can
Republican lawmakers and business leaders pretend that he doesn’t mean
what he says? The chance of calamity has only just begun.

says life-saving HIV treatment can continue during aid pause</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. State Department said Saturday that the
President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) – the world’s
leading HIV initiative – was covered by a waiver for life-saving
humanitarian assistance during a 90-day pause in foreign aid.</p>
<p>Just hours after taking office on Jan. 20, President Donald Trump
ordered the pause so foreign aid contributions could be reviewed to see
if they align with his “America First” foreign policy. The U.S. is the
world’s largest aid donor.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio initially issued a waiver for
emergency food aid and then Tuesday for life-saving medicine, medical
services, food, shelter and subsistence help. However, the lack of
detail in Trump’s order and the ensuing waivers has left aid groups
confused as to whether their work can continue.</p>
<p>So, Saturday the State Department’s Bureau of Global Health Security
and Diplomacy issued a memo, seen by Reuters, clarifying that PEPFAR was
covered by the Jan. 28 memo and spelling out what activities were
allowed.</p>
<p>These include life-saving HIV care and treatment services, including
testing and counseling, prevention and treatment of infections including
tuberculosis (TB), laboratory services, and procurement and supply chain
for commodities/medicines. It also allows prevention of mother-to-child
transmission services.</p>
<p>“Any other activities not specifically mentioned in this guidance may
not be resumed without express approval,” it said.</p>
<p>More than 20 million people living with HIV, who represent two-thirds
of all people living with the disease receiving treatment globally, are
directly supported by PEPFAR.</p>
<p>Under Trump’s foreign aid pause, all payments by U.S. Agency for
International Development (USAID) stopped Tuesday — for the first time
since the fiscal year began on Oct. 1 — and have not resumed, according
to U.S. Treasury data. On Monday USAID paid out $8 million and last week
a total of $545 million.</p>
<p>The Trump administration is also moving to strip a slimmed-down USAID
of its independence and put it under State Department control, two
sources familiar with the discussions said Friday, in what would be a
significant overhaul of how Washington allocates U.S. foreign aid.</p>
