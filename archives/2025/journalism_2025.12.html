<p>date: 2025-03-28, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p>The Department of Justice announced an investigation into UCLA on
Thursday for the alleged use of affirmative action when admitting
students. A 2023 Supreme Court ruling made it illegal to consider race
in the college admissions process nationwide, but affirmative action was
already illegal across the UC at the time due to California voters
passing Proposition 209 – which banned the practice in public
employment, education and contracting – in 1996.</p>
