## NASA IXPE’s ‘Heartbeat Black Hole’ Measurements Challenge Current Theories

date: 2025-08-12, from: NASA breaking news

Written by Michael Allen An international team of astronomers using NASA’s IXPE (Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer), has challenged our understanding of what happens to matter in the direct vicinity of a black hole. With IXPE, astronomers can study incoming X-rays and measure the polarization, a property of light that describes the direction of its electric [&#8230;]

## OSNews goes ad-free, for everyone, and we need your support

date: 2025-08-12, from: OS News

Earlier today, I made the decision to remove all advertising from OSNews. From here on out, you will no longer see any ads, cookie banners, and other ad-related privacy-invasive technologies on this website. While this means a hit to my income, making OSNews even more reliant on our Patreon supporters and Ko-Fi donors, it genuinely feels liberating. I should&#8217;ve made this decision years ago. Read on for how you can support us, and our big fundraiser. I have always been open and honest about my dislike for the modern online advertising industry. It&#8217;s incredibly privacy-invasive, a massive security risk, generally lacking in taste, and genuinely intrusive. As such, despite running ads on OSNews, I have always advocated for the concept of &#8220;your computer, your rules&#8221;, meaning only you, the user, gets to decide what gets run on your computer and displayed on your screen. This includes the use of ad-blockers. I have a Pi-Hole, and you can pry it from my cold, dead hands. Because of this, maintaining ads on OSNews became untenable. Everything about the ads on our site, from the actual ads themselves to the annoying cookie banners talking about &#8220;our 1500 partners&#8221;, gave me the ick, as the young, hip people say, and I&#8217;ve been considering turning them off for a long time. Today, after yet another reader rightfully pointing out how absurd our cookie banner was, I finally made the call. One email to our owner, David Adams, later, and we&#8217;re now entirely ad-free, for everyone. This is a hit to my income, and as such, I kindly ask anyone capable of doing so to support the continued existence of OSNews. How can you support OSNews? We&#8217;ve been online since 1997, meaning soon we&#8217;ll be hitting our 30-year anniversary. Very few websites can boast about such a long, uninterrupted existence, and despite all the changes both the industry and the world at large have gone through, OSNews is still here, doing what it has always done. The removal of ads means we&#8217;re even more dependent on you, dear readers, but I&#8217;m confident in saying that we&#8217;ll make it another 30 years. Thank you for all your continued support over the decades, and let&#8217;s keep going. Without icky ads.

## KWin gets Liquid Glass effects “Only Apple” can make

date: 2025-08-12, from: OS News

Apple, back in June of this year: This is our broadest software design update ever. Meticulously crafted by rethinking the fundamental elements that make up our software, the new design features an entirely new material called Liquid Glass. It combines the optical qualities of glass with a fluidity only Apple can achieve, as it transforms depending on your content or context. ↫ Apple&#8217;s WWDC press release Today, iGerman00, detailing their merge request for adding Liquid Glass effects to a KWin plugin: Added a Concave (lens) refraction mode for a more “Liquid Glass” look, it&#8217;s a lot closer than the current implementation. Also added a Refraction Corner Radius slider (0–200px, 30 steps) to shape the SDF independently of edge size. Because the concave implementation is a bit &#8220;weaker&#8221;, I&#8217;ve raised the maxima to 30 for the relevant sliders. Added some UI logic for irrelevant options between modes. ↫ iGerman00&#8217;s merge request One of the world&#8217;s wealthiest companies, outdone by a random &#8220;amateur hobbyist developer&#8220;. Not only does this merge request recreate Apple&#8217;s Liquid Glass effects, it does so with a detailed settings panel to control every aspect of the effect, something Apple obviously won&#8217;t allow you to do. &#8220;Only Apple&#8221; my ass.

## Firefox’ new “AI” features cause  CPU spikes and battery drain

date: 2025-08-12, from: OS News

Almost three weeks ago, Mozilla released Firefox 141 that, among other features like memory optimizations for Linux and a built-in unit converter, brought controversial AI-enhanced tab groups. Powered by a local AI model, these groups identify related tabs and suggest names for them. There is even a &#8220;Suggest more tabs for group&#8221; button that users can click to get recommendations. Now, several users have taken to the Firefox subreddit to complain about high CPU usage when using the feature, as well as express their disappointment in Mozilla for adding AI to the browser. ↫ David Uzondu at NeoWin Is anybody even asking for &#8220;AI&#8221; features in Firefox? Of the six people still left using Firefox, does even one of them want a chatbot in Firefox? Is any Firefox user the type of user to use some nebulous &#8220;AI&#8221; tool to organize their open tabs? Seeing these kinds of frivolities in Chrome or Edge or whatever makes sense, but in Firefox? At least they&#8217;re easy to disable through about:config &#8211; just set both browser.ml.chat.enabled and browser.tabs.groups.smart.enabled to false. I mean, I guess I can understand Mozilla trying to ride the hype bubble, but at least make this nonsense opt-in, instead of asking users to dig around in obtuse config flags.

You click a link in your chat app, your browser with a hundred tabs comes to the front and opens that page. How hard can it be? Well, you probably know by now that Wayland, unlike X, doesn’t let one application force its idiot wishes on everyone else. In order for an application to bring its window to the front, it needs to make use of the XDG Activation protocol. In essence, an application cannot take focus, it can only receive focus. In the example above, your chat app would request an XDG Activation token from the compositor. It then asks the system to open the given URL (typically launching the web browser) and sends along the token. The browser can then use this token to activate its window. ↫ Kai Uwe After explaining exactly how this mechanism works, KDE developer Kai Uwe details the issue that not every application yet properly supports the XDG Activation protocol, and some that do have bugs that, say, might make an application discard its token too early. In other words, it&#8217;s time to start testing. You&#8217;ll need to use the latest git master brach of KWin, and enable set the &#8220;Focus Stealing Prevention&#8221; option in Window Management to &#8220;Extreme&#8221;. When set to &#8220;Extreme&#8221;, KWin will exclusively activate windows that request activation with a valid token. They&#8217;ve already found and fixed a number of issues in KDE using this method, but more are bound to found, particularly in third-party applications. They&#8217;re planning on turning on KWin&#8217;s focus stealing prevention on Wayland with forgiving settings at first, but increase the strictness of the feature as time progresses and issues are fixed.

## GNOME 49 backlight changes

One of the things I’m working on at Red Hat is HDR support. HDR is inherently linked to luminance (brightness, but ignoring human perception) which makes it an important parameter for us that we would like to be in control of. ↫ Sebastian Wick A really interesting look at how GNOME is going to handle screen brightness.

## GitHub becomes part of Microsoft’s “AI” organisation

date: 2025-08-11, from: OS News

It seems Microsoft is absorbing GitHub deeper into Microsoft. GitHub’s CEO Thomas Dohmke is stepping down, and GitHub will be integrated into a new department within Microsoft. Which department will become the new stewards of GitHub, and the massive pile of open source code it’s hosting? You already know. Still, after all this time, my startup roots have begun tugging on me and I’ve decided to leave GitHub to become a founder again. GitHub and its leadership team will continue its mission as part of Microsoft’s CoreAI organization, with more details shared soon. I’ll be staying through the end of 2025 to help guide the transition and am leaving with a deep sense of pride in everything we’ve built as a remote-first organization spread around the world. ↫ Thomas Dohmke GitHub will become part of a new “AI” engineering group inside Microsoft, led by a former Facebook executive, Jay Parikh. As The Verge notes, this new group includes platform and development tools and Dev Div teams, “with a focus on building an AI platform and tools for both Microsoft and its customers”. In other words, Microsoft is going to streamline taking your code and sucking it up into its “AI” slop machines. If you’re hosting code on GitHub, the best time to move it somewhere else was yesterday, but if you haven’t yet, the second best time is today. Unless you want your code to be sucked up into Microsoft and regurgitated to sloppify Windows and Office, you should be moving your code to GitHub alternatives.

## DisplayPort is better than HDMI, and I will die on this hill

date: 2025-08-11, from: OS News

Over the years, we’ve seen a good number of interfaces used for computer monitors, TVs, LCD panels and other all-things-display purposes. We’ve lived through VGA and the large variety of analog interfaces that preceded it, then DVI, HDMI, and at some point, we’ve started getting devices with DisplayPort support. So you might think it’s more of the same. However, I’d like to tell you that you probably should pay more attention to DisplayPort – it’s an interface powerful in a way that we haven’t seen before. ↫ Arya Voronova at HackADay DisplayPort is a better user experience in every way compared to HDMI. I am so, so sad that HDMI has won out in the consumer electronics space, with all of its countless anti-user features as detailed in the linked article. I refuse to use HDMI when DisplayPort is available, so all of my computers&#8217; displays are hooked up over DP. Whenever I did try to use HDMI, I always ran into issues with resolution, refresh rates, improper monitor detection, and go knows what else. Plug in a DP cable, and everything always just works. Sadly, in consumer electronics, DisplayPort isn&#8217;t all that common. Game consoles, Hi-Fi audio, televisions, and so on, all push HDMI hard and often don&#8217;t offer a DisplayPort option at all. It takes me back to the early-to-late 2000s, when my entire audio setup was hooked up using optical cables, simply because I was a MiniDisc user and had accepted the gospel of optical cables. Back then, too, I refused to buy or use anything that used unwieldy analog cables. Mind you, this had nothing to do with audio quality &#8211; it was a usability thing. If anyone is aware of home audio devices and televisions that do offer DisplayPort, feel free to jump into the comments.

## Zig’s lovely syntax

date: 2025-08-11, from: OS News

It’s a bit of a silly post, because syntax is the least interesting d detail about the language, but, still, I can’t stop thinking how Zig gets this detail just right for the class of curly-braced languages, and, well, now you’ll have to think about that too. On the first glance, Zig looks almost exactly like Rust, because Zig borrows from Rust liberally. And I think that Rust has great syntax, considering all the semantics it needs to express (see “Rust’s Ugly Syntax”). But Zig improves on that, mostly by leveraging simpler language semantics, but also through some purely syntactical tasteful decisions. ↫ Alex Kladov Y&#8217;all know full well I know very little about programming, so there&#8217;s much interesting stuff I can add here. The only slightly related frame of reference I have is how some languages &#8211; as in, the ones we speak &#8211; have a pleasing grammar or spelling, and how even when you can&#8217;t actually speak a language, some of them intrinsically look attractive and pleasing when you see them in written form. I mean, you can&#8217;t look at Scottisch Gaelic and not notice it just looks pleasing: Dh’ éirich mi moch air mhaduinn an-dé‘S gun ghearr mi’n ear-thalmhainn do bhrìgh mo sgéilAn dùil gu ‘m faicinn fhéin rùn mo chléibhOch òin gu ‘m faca ‘s a cùl rium féin. ↫ Mo Shùil Ad Dhèidh by Donald MacNicol I have no idea if programmers can look at programming languages the same way, but I&#8217;ve often been told there&#8217;s more overlap between programming languages and regular language than many people think. As such, it wouldn&#8217;t surprise me if some programming languages look really pleasing to programmers, even if they can&#8217;t use them because they haven&#8217;t really learned them yet.
