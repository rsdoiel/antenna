Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0642 AM CST Thu Jan 30 2025

Valid 301300Z - 311200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR SOUTHEAST
TEXAS INTO CENTRAL AND NORTHERN LOUISIANA AND FAR WESTERN
MISSISSIPPI...

...SUMMARY...
Strong/isolated severe storms will be possible today into tonight
from eastern portions of Texas eastward across the Lower Mississippi
Valley.

...East-central TX into the lower MS Valley...
A large mid to upper-level low centered near the CO/KS/OK/TX border
region will migrate eastward through tonight before reaching the
lower MO Valley early Friday morning.  A belt of 100+ kt 500-mb flow
will move from southwest TX northeastward into eastern OK/north TX
by early evening before overspreading the Ark-La-Miss and lower OH
Valley.  The strongest upper forcing for ascent will shift
northeastward from the southern Great Plains into the Ozarks and
lower OH Valley.  Coincidentally, a weak surface low will move from
northeast TX towards the IL vicinity late tonight.  Surface analysis
this morning indicates a warm frontal zone draped over northeastern
TX and central LA.  Model guidance indicates this feature will
advance into parts of the lower MS Valley/Mid South later this
afternoon/evening.  

Considerable cloudiness today will limit overall destabilization in
combination with relatively marginal mid-level lapse rates
(reference 12 UTC Fort Worth/Del Rio, TX and Shreveport, LA raobs). 
However, a plume of modified Gulf moisture featuring dewpoints
ranging from near 70 to the mid 60s, extends from Deep South TX
northward into eastern TX ahead of the cold front and south of the
northward advancing warm frontal zone.  Uncertainty for severe today
into tonight is related to overall weak instability and storm
development immediately ahead of the front.  It seems plausible
storms will gradually intensify through the morning into the
afternoon.  Forecast soundings show enlarged hodographs which would
support a potential risk for organized line segments/supercells. 
Damaging gusts and an isolated risk for a couple of tornadoes appear
to be the primary threats with the stronger storms as this potential
severe activity shifts east in tandem with a strong LLJ.  Weaker
instability with east extent into the lower MS Valley this
evening/tonight will likely lead to a lessening severe threat with
time.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1246 AM CST Thu Jan 30 2025

Valid 311200Z - 011200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will be limited across the country on Friday.
Widespread rain chances are expected to overspread the mid-MS and OH
River Valleys on Friday as the upper trough currently moving into
the southern Plains migrates east/northeast. A broad, but weak,
surface ridge building across the Four Corners and southern High
Plains will limit wind speeds within the driest air mass over the
country. Consequently, the potential for fire weather concerns
appears limited.

Mesoscale Discussion 0056
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0633 AM CST Tue Jan 28 2025

Areas affected...the Upper Michigan vicinity

Concerning...Heavy snow 

Valid 281233Z - 281700Z

SUMMARY...A period of heavy snow, at rates on the order of 1-2+
inches per hour, appears possible in a corridor overspreading the
central Upper Peninsula of Michigan vicinity by midday.

DISCUSSION...Downstream of a low-amplitude short wave perturbation,
accompanying an intense (110+ kt at 500 mb) jet streak digging
east-southeast of the Canadian Prairies, lower/mid-tropospheric warm
advection is overspreading the Upper Midwest into Great Lakes
region.  Associated forcing for ascent is becoming focused across
the southwestern flank of an arctic air mass now entrenched across
much of the Great Lakes region, particularly near a zone of strong
lower/mid-tropospheric frontogenesis, which is forecast to shift
from northwestern Ontario across the western Lake Superior and
central Upper Peninsula of Michigan vicinity through 17-18z.

Forecast soundings across this region indicate that the sub-freezing
thermodynamic profiles are in the process of saturating, ahead of an
ongoing band of moderate to heavy snow, which appears likely to be
maintained through at least early afternoon.  Temperatures appear
within a few degrees of -15C through an initially deep layer from
lower-levels into the 700-600 mb layer, where conditions will be
most conducive to large dendritic ice crystal growth.  Coinciding
with maximizing lift associated with the frontogenetic forcing, it
appears that this may support a 2-3 hour period of heavy snow rates
on the order of 1-2 inches per hour.  Forecast soundings also
indicate that a layer a steepening mid-level lapse rates may be
accompanied by the development of weak CAPE and embedded convective
development with heavier snow rates possible.

## SPC Jan 26, 2025 Day 4-8 Severe Weather Outlook

date: 2025-01-26, from: NOAA tornado/severe thunderstorm watches, mesoscale discussions, convective outlooks, fire weather outlooks

<br /><a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/exper/day4-8/"><img src="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/exper/day4-8/day48prob.gif" border="1" alt="Day 4-8 Outlook Image" hspace="1" vspace="1" width="815" height="555" align="center" /></a><pre>
Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0359 AM CST Sun Jan 26 2025

Valid 291200Z - 031200Z

...DISCUSSION...
...Wednesday/Day 4 to Thursday/Day 5...
A mid-level low is forecast to move eastward across the Desert
Southwest from Wednesday/Day 4 into Thursday/Day 5. Low-level
moisture advection will take place ahead of the system across the
southern Plains on Wednesday into Wednesday night, with surface
dewpoints increasing into the 60s F across parts of the southern
Plains. Scattered to numerous thunderstorms appear likely to develop
across the western part of the moist sector Wednesday night across
much of central and northern Texas, as large-scale ascent increases
ahead of the approaching system. This, combined with increasing
instability, and strong deep-layer shear along the western edge of
the moist sector should result in a severe threat late Wednesday
night. A cluster of strong and potentially severe storms may develop
in west-central Texas, with the severe threat persisting into
Thursday, as an MCS moves eastward across the southern Plains.
Supercells with isolated large hail and wind damage will be
possible. There is some concern that moisture return could be slower
than forecast. However, the strength of the system could help to
overcome instability concerns, and it appears a severe threat will
be possible as the mid-level jet ejects northeastward into the
southern Plains from Wednesday night into Thursday.

...Friday/Day 6 and Sunday/Day 8...
The mid-level trough is forecast to move across the southern Plains
on Friday/Day 6, as a cold front advances eastward into the lower
Mississippi Valley. On Saturday/Day 7 and Sunday/Day 8, this front
is forecast to move across the eastern U.S. Although thunderstorms
will be possible along and ahead of the front, instability is
forecast to be very weak suggesting a severe threat will be
unlikely.
