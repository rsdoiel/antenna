Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0630 AM CST Mon Jan 27 2025

Valid 271300Z - 281200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not forecast across the contiguous United
States through tonight.

...Synopsis...
A mid-level low will meander slowly east across southern CA into
northwest AZ during the period.  A belt of strong upper flow will
extend from Baja California east across the southern U.S. while a
split flow regime is maintained with troughing over the Great Lakes.
In the low levels, a frontal zone will slide southward into the
northern Gulf from the central Gulf Coast.  Showers and isolated
thunderstorms are possible mainly this morning over the central Gulf
Coast, before the focus for isolated thunderstorms focuses farther
west over the Mojave Desert into western AZ today.  Elsewhere,
quiescent conditions will prevail across much of the remainder of
the CONUS.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0123 AM CST Mon Jan 27 2025

Valid 281200Z - 291200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns appear limited for Tuesday across the country.
The upper low currently over southern California is forecast to
gradually shift east across the southwest states over the next 48
hours. As this occurs, moderately strong mid-level winds will
overspread much of NM, which will support breezy winds around 15 mph
by late afternoon in the vicinity of a weak surface trough that is
forecast to reside across the central portion of the state. Dry
low-level air emanating out of northern Mexico combined with modest
wind speeds may allow some areas to reach elevated wind/RH
thresholds, but the coverage and duration of such conditions appears
limited compared to prior days. Additionally, the axis of the
strongest winds/lowest RH will become increasingly displaced from
the driest fuels located across AZ and far western NM. Across the
Plains, a strong surface pressure gradient will support another day
of 15-20 mph winds with afternoon RH values falling into the 20-35%
range. Localized elevated fire weather conditions are possible, but
confidence in widespread or persistent elevated conditions is too
limited for highlights at this time.

## SPC Jan 26, 2025 Day 4-8 Severe Weather Outlook

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0359 AM CST Sun Jan 26 2025

Valid 291200Z - 031200Z

...DISCUSSION...
...Wednesday/Day 4 to Thursday/Day 5...
A mid-level low is forecast to move eastward across the Desert
Southwest from Wednesday/Day 4 into Thursday/Day 5. Low-level
moisture advection will take place ahead of the system across the
southern Plains on Wednesday into Wednesday night, with surface
dewpoints increasing into the 60s F across parts of the southern
Plains. Scattered to numerous thunderstorms appear likely to develop
across the western part of the moist sector Wednesday night across
much of central and northern Texas, as large-scale ascent increases
ahead of the approaching system. This, combined with increasing
instability, and strong deep-layer shear along the western edge of
the moist sector should result in a severe threat late Wednesday
night. A cluster of strong and potentially severe storms may develop
in west-central Texas, with the severe threat persisting into
Thursday, as an MCS moves eastward across the southern Plains.
Supercells with isolated large hail and wind damage will be
possible. There is some concern that moisture return could be slower
than forecast. However, the strength of the system could help to
overcome instability concerns, and it appears a severe threat will
be possible as the mid-level jet ejects northeastward into the
southern Plains from Wednesday night into Thursday.

...Friday/Day 6 and Sunday/Day 8...
The mid-level trough is forecast to move across the southern Plains
on Friday/Day 6, as a cold front advances eastward into the lower
Mississippi Valley. On Saturday/Day 7 and Sunday/Day 8, this front
is forecast to move across the eastern U.S. Although thunderstorms
will be possible along and ahead of the front, instability is
forecast to be very weak suggesting a severe threat will be
unlikely.
