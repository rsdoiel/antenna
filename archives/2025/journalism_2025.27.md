Bernardo said Klein should not have responded to the “ambiguous” email request from Giovanny, calling his reply &#8220;disrespectful&#8221; and &#8220;highly insensitive.&#8221; He added that he found a change.org petition calling on UCLA to remove Klein that amassed 21,000 signatures to be “a measure of the reputational damage&#8221; that Klein had done to the school.

Klein returned to the stand for further cross-examination. Attorneys representing the UC Board of Regents and Bernardo presented multiple student grievances against Klein, ranging from a Title IX complaint in 2015 to several student evaluations which described Klein as condescending and close-minded.

date: 2025-07-10, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)

Comedy might be the best remedy, but how many jokes can be made before the well runs dry?
Since its arrival to the Westwood stage June 26, “The Reservoir” has entertained audiences with its lighthearted humor and heartfelt intentionality, despite unfortunately skimming over devastating topics.

Leslie Giovanny, who sent the original email to Klein proposing grading accommodations for Black students in June 2020, also took the witness stand. He said in his testimony that he did not find Klein’s email response to be racist.&#160;
“I don’t think he said anything wrong,” Giovanny said.
