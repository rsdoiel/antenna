Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0630 AM CST Mon Feb 17 2025

Valid 171300Z - 181200Z

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms are not expected through tonight.

...Synopsis and Discussion...
A surface cold front is in the process of clearing far south FL and
the Keys this morning. In its wake, expansive high pressure will
dominate much of the central CONUS. Across the western states, a
weak mid-level shortwave trough will advance from the Northwest
towards the central Rockies through the period. With cool and/or dry
conditions expected across a large majority of the CONUS,
thunderstorm potential appears limited through tonight.

Mesoscale Discussion 0110
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0748 AM CST Sun Feb 16 2025

Areas affected...Northern Florida...Southeast Georgia...Eastern
Southern Carolina...Far Southern North Carolina

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 13...

Valid 161348Z - 161545Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 13
continues.

SUMMARY...A threat for damaging wind gusts will continue this
morning from parts of northern Florida northeastward into southeast
Georgia and the Carolinas.

DISCUSSION...The latest mosaic radar imagery shows a line of strong
to severe storms from the eastern Florida Panhandle northeastward
into the central Carolinas. Ahead of the line, surface dewpoints in
the 60s F are contributing to weak instability. The RAP has MUCAPE
less than 500 J/kg in most areas across the Atlantic coastal plains.
In spite of this, frontal forcing is strong near the line, which
will likely help the line to maintain strength over the next few
hours. With the strong low to mid-level flow in place, evident on
regional WSR-88D VWPs, the line is expected to continue to produce
isolated damaging gusts, especially along the parts that are more
organized. The wind-damage threat will likely persist into the mid
to late morning as the line moves through the Atlantic coastal
areas.

Mesoscale Discussion 0109
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0728 AM CST Sun Feb 16 2025

Areas affected...Northern New York...Northern New England

Concerning...Winter mixed precipitation 

Valid 161328Z - 161930Z

SUMMARY...Heavy snow will likely develop across parts of northern
New York and northern New England this morning. Further south into
parts of east-central New York and central New England, a mix of
snow, sleet and freezing rain will be possible this morning.

DISCUSSION...A mid-level trough will quickly move through the
southern and central Appalachians this morning. A surface low will
deepen and move northeastward into the Northeast. Ahead of the
system, a band of strong warm-advection was located from New York
eastward into the southern New England, where widespread
precipitation is ongoing. The freezing line is currently located
from southern New York eastward into southern New England. A zone
(about 100 miles wide) of freezing rain and sleet is located to the
north of the freezing line. This freezing rain and sleet will spread
northward over the next few hours. A changeover to rain will occur
as the freezing line moves northward. In addition, areas that are
experiencing snow may changeover to freezing rain. Freezing rain
rates could exceed 0.05 inches per hour.

Further north into northern New England, surface temperatures are in
the teens and single digits. The cold air in the low to mid-levels
will make snow the primary precipitation type. As strong warm
advection and isentropic lift increase across the region, the
development of heavy snow will likely occur in many areas. Snowfall
rates could exceed 1 inch per hour.
