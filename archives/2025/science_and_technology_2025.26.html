<p>date: 2025-07-02, from: OS News</p>
<p>We need a new framework for how to defend against “trolls”. The
feeding metaphor ran its course many years ago. It is done and will not
be coming back. New online risks demand that we adapt and become
proactive in protecting our spaces. We have to loudly and proudly set
the terms of what is permissible. Those holding social or institutional
power in communities should be willing to drop a few loud fuck offs to
anyone trying to work their way in by weaponizing optics, concern
trolling, or the well known “tolerance paradox”. Conceding through
silence, or self-censorship, only emboldens those who benefit from
attacking a community. ↫ diegoebe Een volk dat voor tirannen zwicht, zal

<h2 id="donkey-kong-country-2-and-open-bus">Donkey Kong Country 2 and
open bus</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-01, from: OS News</p>
<p>Apparently, Donkey Kong Country 2 has runs into a bug in the old SNES
emulator ZSNES, where one of the barrels that you’re supposed to be able
to precisely control the spinning direction of ends up spinning forever.
This bug is caused by ZSNES not emulating open bus behavior. I believe
this was originally discovered by Anomie roughly two decades ago, who
subsequently fixed the same bug in Snes9x. This original fix hardcoded
the specific addresses to return the values that the game depends on
rather than properly emulating open bus, but it fixed DKC2 and probably
didn’t break anything else. The bug was never fixed in ZSNES, which is
now a long abandoned project (last release in 2007). Purely out of
curiosity, I wanted to dig into this a little more to figure out what
exactly in the game code causes these barrels to spin forever in an
emulator that doesn’t emulate open bus behavior. ↫ jsgroth Just in case
you’ve always wanted to know.</p>

experimental layer to run X desktop environments on Wayland</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-29, from: OS News</p>
<p>With X.org being in maintenance mode, with the process of replacing
it with Wayland accelerating pretty quickly now, a lot of projects using
X.org are looking for ways to prepare for the future. Alpine Linux, a
distribution focused on musl, BusyBox, and OpenRC, also wants to reduce
its maintenance burden for X11 applications, and so Alpine Linux
maintainer Ariadne Conill has come up with something interesting.
Wayback is an experimental X compatibility layer which allows for
running full X desktop environments using Wayland components. It is
essentially a stub compositor which provides just enough Wayland
capabilities to host a rootful Xwayland server. It is intended to
eventually replace the classic X.org server in Alpine, thus reducing
maintenance burden of X applications in Alpine, but a lot of work needs
to be done first. ↫ Wayback GitHub page It’s nowhere near done and most
likely contains massive amounts of bugs and issues, but the seed has
been planted. Wayback will make it possible to keep running X11-based
desktop environments even in a full-Wayland environment. This may be
necessary in case you need a specific feature not yet available in the
Wayland version of your desktop environment, or if your desktop
environment of choice simply isn’t going to move to Wayland at all (due
to lack of maintainers or whatever). It’ll also be a boon for
retrocomputing, especially as over the coming years and decades
unmaintained X11 desktop environments become become ever harder to keep
running on modern Linux distributions. While X.org as it exists today
certainly isn’t going anywhere any time soon, it will, eventually, stop
working properly on Linux distributions who don’t ship it by default
anymore, and it’s awesome to already have the beginnings of a project to
address this problem.</p>

id="microsoft-to-remove-all-but-the-latest-versions-of-drivers-from-windows-update">Microsoft
to remove all but the latest versions of drivers from Windows
Update</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-29, from: OS News</p>
<p>This blog post is intended to notify all Windows Hardware program
partners that Microsoft has taken a strategic initiative to clean up
legacy drivers published on Windows Update to reduce security and
compatibility risks. The rationale behind this initiative is to ensure
that we have the optimal set of drivers on Windows Update that cater to
a variety of hardware devices across the windows ecosystem, while making
sure that Microsoft Windows security posture is not compromised. This
initiative involves periodic cleanup of drivers from Windows Update,
thereby resulting in some drivers not being offered to any systems in
the ecosystem. ↫ Microsoft’s Hardware Dev Center The general gist is
that Microsoft is going to remove all drivers from Windows Update for
which newer versions exist – or, to put it in a different way, only the
latest versions of a driver are going to remain available on Windows
Update. It’s effectively a clean-up of Windows Update, and the only way
older versions of drivers will remain available on Windows Update is if
the manufacturer in question can make a “business justification” to keep
them around. Some of this may sound surprising, since many people assume
Windows Update only offers the latest versions of drivers – annoyingly
so, sometimes – but this isn’t the case. Corporations with fleets of
devices can actually determine exactly which drivers get sent to their
devices, including opting for older versions in case newer versions have
regressions or otherwise cause issues. Sometimes you just don’t have a
choice. According to Adam Demasi, the creator and maintainer of the
amazing Legacy Update service, Microsoft hasn’t deleted a single driver
or update from Windows Update since 2001 (save for problematic updates).
This results in a truly massive collection of updates and drivers, and
that’s causing real problems for Microsoft. Windows Update has a pretty
cool system of describing whether an update is necessary to be installed
on the current system, or if it is already installed. It also builds a
relationship graph between updates, to indicate when they have been
replaced by a newer update that includes all changes from the previous
update. That system is also its downfall, causing the Windows Update
service to be incredibly slow in checking for updates, possibly never
completing the check at all. This issue also applies to WSUS, which
despite being based on the very robust SQL Server, struggles with the
number of drivers Microsoft hosts on Windows Update. As of April, we
know that Windows Update hosts 1,799,339 drivers, and this creates a 138
GB database that requires almost 16 days to synchronise down from the
main servers. The WSUS server is brought to its knees, with frequent
timeouts while it furiously tries to complete database queries. (The PC
used is a Ryzen 5700G with 32 GB of 3600 MHz RAM and 500 GB of NVMe,
running Windows Server 2025 and SQL Server 2022.) ↫ Adam Demasi From
this, it’s easy to understand why Microsoft would want to perform some
housekeeping, followed by a new set of rules around only keeping the
latest versions of drivers around in Windows Update. Demasi also notes
that these plans by Microsoft won’t affect drivers for old devices,
since they will still be served their “newest” driver version, and it
won’t affect Legacy Update either.</p>

<p>The GPU in your computer is about 10 to 100 times more powerful than
the CPU, depending on workload. For real-time graphics rendering and
machine learning, you are enjoying that power, and doing those workloads
on a CPU is not viable. Why aren’t we exploiting that power for other
workloads? What prevents a GPU from being a more general purpose
computer? ↫ Raph Levien Fascinating thoughts on parallel computation,
