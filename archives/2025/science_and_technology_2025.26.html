<h2 id="nvidia-is-full-of-shit">NVIDIA is full of shit</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>Since the disastrous launch of the RTX 50 series, NVIDIA has been
unable to escape negative headlines: scalper bots are snatching GPUs
away from consumers before official sales even begin, power connectors
continue to melt, with no fix in sight, marketing is becoming
increasingly deceptive, GPUs are missing processing units when they
leave the factory, and the drivers, for which NVIDIA has always been
praised, are currently falling apart. And to top it all off, NVIDIA is
becoming increasingly insistent that media push a certain narrative when
reporting on their hardware. ↫ Sebin Nyshkim Out of all the issues
listed here – and there are many, and each is bad enough on their own –
it’s the frame generation and related pressure campaigns on reviewers
that really get on my nerves the most. Technologies like DLSS (rendering
at a lower internal resolution scaling that up) and frame generation
(injecting fake “AI” frames to jack up the frame rate) can be fine
technologies when used at the consumer’s discretion to find a balance
between improved perceived performance in exchange for blurry image
quality and artefacting, but we’ve now reached a point where NVIDIA will
only boast about performance figures with these technologies enabled,
downsides be damned. If that wasn’t misleading enough, the company is
also pressuring reviewers who don’t enable these technologies, and focus
on real frames, real resolutions, and this, real performance. If you
don’t comply, you’re not getting the next crop of GPUs in early access.
It’s the kind of shit Apple pulls all the time, and we need less of it,
not more. Just don’t buy NVIDIA. They’re already a terrible choice if
you’re running anything other than Windows, but the company’s recent
behaviour and serious missteps have made the choice for AMD or Intel
only more obvious.</p>

id="redox-gets-network-booting-work-on-unix-domain-sockets-continues">Redox
gets network booting, work on UNIX domain sockets continues</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>Redox continues to make progress, and as another month has passed us
by, it’s time for another monthly update. This past month, the focus has
been on UNIX domain sockets, which are needed for Redox’ goal of running
Wayland. As we continue to move forward with our plans for Wayland, a
key technology for Wayland support is the ability to send file
descriptors over Unix Domain Sockets. File descriptor sending is also an
important part of many other OS features, including Capability-based
Security. Our Redox Summer of Code project to implement that ability has
been progressing very well. Ibuki, a new member of the Redox team, has
jumped right into the deep end, and implemented
the sendmg and recvmsg functionality, and continues to move forward with
work on UDS. ↫ Ribbon and Ron Williams You can read more about the UNIX
domain sockets progress in a detailed post on the Redox website. Redox
now also supports network booting through PXE, but for now, only UEFI is
supported. Of course, all of this work is topped off with the usual slew
of fixes in relibc, RedoxFS, various drivers, and more, as well updated
ports across the board.</p>

<h2 id="is-an-intel-n100-a-better-value-than-a-raspberry-pi">Is an Intel
N100 a better value than a Raspberry Pi?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>All of this to say: value is complicated. The Pi 5 is much more
compact and slightly more power efficient (especially at idle) compared
to the cheapest N1XX Intel systems. The Intel systems are better suited
for a desktop use case. The Pi 5 can be run off PoE power, for easier
one-cable networking + power. The Intel systems are more compatible with
a wider range of software (not the least of which is anything requiring
Windows). ↫ Jeff Geerling Intel’s N100 and N150 are vastly
underappreciated. The mini laptop I reviewed over a year ago is built
around the N100, and I still use it every day for watching YouTube,
writing OSNews posts, and so on. I never run into performance issues,
battery life is excellent, and I don’t have to deal with the annoyances
of using ARM. The catch is that you’re going to want to use Linux – I
use Fedora KDE – because Windows’ performance on the N100 is dreadful. I
don’t think the jump from the N100 to the N150 is worthwhile enough to
buy the new version of my mini laptop, so I’ll stick with what I have. I
do hope Intel continues the Nxxx line or processors, because it offers
something no other x86 chip offers: more than reasonable performance at
low power usage for an incredibly low price.</p>

25.10 to drop support for effectively all existing RISC-V hardware,
focuses on future RISC-V hardware instead</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>A recent bug report filed against Ubuntu’s upgrading tool confirmed a
major change with regards to the RISC-V requirements for the upcoming
Ubuntu 25.10 release — most existing RISC-V devices will not be able to
run Ubuntu 25.10. How come? ↫ Joey Sneddon at omgubuntu.co.uk RISC-V
just isn’t delivering. That’s the cold and harsh truth more and more
people are having to deal with, such as Chimera Linux dropping RISC-V
support because the ecosystem is simply lacking the kind of powerful and
available hardware to sustain itself (Chimera got lucky, though, and
gained access to a Milk-V Pioneer through Adélie Linux). The number of
systems and boards that are both powerful and available is close enough
to zero that it might as well be zero, and if neither users nor
developers can buy RISC-V hardware, what’s the point in supporting it?
The issue for Ubuntu specifically is that version 25.10 of the
distribution intends to target only the RVA23 baseline RISC-V profile,
while currently Ubuntu supports RVA20 as the baseline. This higher
baseline profile requires a number of extensions to the instruction set
that no existing hardware yet supports, making 25.10 effectively a clean
break for all existing RISC-V hardware. In other words, if you’re
running Ubuntu on RISC-V hardware today, you won’t be able to upgrade to
25.10 or higher. RISC-V really needs vastly improved hardware
availability, because right now it’s just not delivering on the years of
promises.</p>

<h2 id="the-amiga-3000-unix-and-sun-microsystems-deal-or-no-deal">The
Amiga 3000 UNIX and Sun Microsystems: deal or no deal?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>Amiga lore is full of exciting tales. Many of them are retold to
demonstrate how the incompetence of Commodore’s management destroyed a
platform that, by rights, was destined for success. Coulda, shoulda, and
the Amiga woulda risen as rightful ruler of all other computer
platforms, forever and ever. Amen. One of those stories is about how Sun
Microsystems allegedly showed interest in the Amiga 3000 during the
early 1990s. It’s a classic Amiga anecdote, usually recounted without
much reflection, and one I’ve certainly helped perpetuate. Alas, the
more I think about it, the less it adds up. Fact or factoid? Let’s
speculate! ↫ Carl Svensson Great speculation with some solid reasoning
and sourcing. Considering that had been some minor joint marketing
between Sun and Commodore, my money is on the talks around that deal
birthing rumours about more extensive Sun involvement in the Amiga 3000.
At this point in time, however, decades after the fact and with several
conflicting account, it’s unlikely we’ll ever get a solid answer.</p>

id="elementary-os-makes-meaningful-accessibility-improvements">Elementary
OS makes meaningful accessibility improvements</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>With recent efforts to improve accessibility in GNOME and KDE, as
well as a renewed focus on highlighting the many issues that still need
fixing, the Linux desktop is making meaningful strides in becoming more
accessible to those among us with disabilities. Obviously, the Linux
desktop is bigger than just GNOME and KDE, so today we have elementary
OS improving its accessibility features in a variety of ways. July is
Disability Pride Month, an opportunity for us to consider how we’re
serving our disabled community and work on breaking down barriers to
access. Last year we had the pleasure of being introduced to Florian—a
fully blind cybersecurity enthusiast—and thanks to his feedback we
completely rewrote navigation in Onboarding to be more keyboard and
screen reader friendly, as well as took another look at Installation and
Initial Setup to vastly improve our entire first run experience for
blind folks. Plus, we implemented the screen reader interface in
the  +  window switcher. Thanks to this feedback, elementary OS 8 can be
installed and set up completely blind, an important win for maintaining
your independence as a person with vision disabilities. Since the
release of OS 8 we’ve been working on things like improving contrast,
support for Dark Mode screenshots and brand colors in AppCenter, turning
on or snoozing Dark Mode without canceling your schedule, expanding the
scope of the “Reduce Motion” setting, and adding more options to reduce
distracting notification bubbles. Plus, thanks to feedback
from Aaron who you may know from his blog series on Linux accessibility,
Notifications and the Shortcut Overlay both got releases that add screen
reader support. ↫ Danielle Foré at elementary’s blog I’m glad we’re
finally putting to rest this idea that accessibility features should be
afterthoughts, relevant to only a minute percentage of people. Not only
is the disabled community way bigger than we might think, many of the
features they require are simply also extremely nice and beneficial to
users who might not actually require them. I know tons of people who,
for instance, love reduce motion features simply because it makes their
operating system feel faster, or people who just don’t want to be
bothered with notifications the instant they arrive. Accessibility goes
far beyond what we traditionally think of as accessibility features,
like screen readers or high contrast modes. Making software more
accessible for those that require it, also makes software more
accessible for those that merely desire it. Even though elementary OS
probably isn’t the type of distribution that appeals to the average
OSNews reader, I’m incredibly happy they’re taking accessibility
seriously, and I intend to continue to highlight such improvements.</p>

id="servers-and-thin-clients-in-every-home-is-the-future-they-stole-from-us">Servers
and thin clients in every home is the future they stole from us</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-02, from: OS News</p>
<p>I’ve used thin clients at home for quite a while – both for
their intended use (remotely accessing a desktop of another system); and
in the sense of “modern thin clients are x86 boxes that are wildly
overpowered for what they run, so they make good mini servers.”
Recently, I saw a bulk lot of Sun Ray thin clients pop up on Trade Me
(NZ’s eBay-like auction site) – and with very little idea of how many
clients were actually included in this lot, I jumped on it. After a 9
hour round-trip drive (on some of the worst roads I’ve seen!), I
returned home with the back of my car completely packed with Sun Rays.
Time for some interesting shenanigans! ↫ catstret.ch I was unaware you
could still set up a Sun Ray environment with latest versions of
OpenIndiana, and that has me quite interested in buying a few Sun Rays
off eBay and follow in the author’s footsteps. It seems like it’s not
too difficult, and while there’s some manual nonsense you have to do to
get everything to install correctly, it’s nothing crazy. To this day, I
firmly believe that the concept of dumb thin clients connected to
powerful servers is an alluring and interesting way of computing. I’m
not talking about connecting up to servers owned by massive technology
corporations – I’m talking about a few powerful servers down in your own
basement or attic or whatever, serving applications and desktops
straight to basic thin clients all around your house. These thin clients
can take the shape of anything, from something like a desktop setup in
your office, down to a basic display in your kitchen for showing
recipes, setting timers, and other basic stuff – and everything in
between. Sun Rays could ‘hot desk’ using personal smart cards, but of
course, in this day and age you’d have your smartphone. The thin clients
around your house would know it was you through your smartphone, and
serve up the applications, desktop, tools, and so on that you use, but
everything would be running on the servers in your house. Of course, my
wife would have her own account on the server, as would our children,
when they are old enough. None of this is impossible with today’s tools
and computing power, but it wouldn’t be easy to set up. There are no
integrated solutions out there to make this happen; you’d have to scrap
it together from disparate parts and tools, and I doubt such a house of
cards would end up being reliable enough not to quickly become a massive
annoyance and time sink. On top of that, we live in a rental apartment,
so we don’t even have a basement or attic to store loud servers in, nor
are we allowed to drill holes and route Ethernet cabling for optimal
performance. Anyway, there’s no chance in hell any of the major
technology companies would build such a complex ecosystem in a world
where it’s much easier and more profitable to force people to subscribe
to shitty services. In my ideal computing world, though – a server in
every home, with cheap thin clients in every room.</p>

proactive in protecting our spaces. We have to loudly and proudly set
the terms of what is permissible. Those holding social or institutional
power in communities should be willing to drop a few loud fuck offs to
anyone trying to work their way in by weaponizing optics, concern
trolling, or the well known “tolerance paradox”. Conceding through
silence, or self-censorship, only emboldens those who benefit from
attacking a community. ↫ diegoebe Een volk dat voor tirannen zwicht, zal

<h2 id="donkey-kong-country-2-and-open-bus">Donkey Kong Country 2 and
open bus</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-01, from: OS News</p>
<p>Apparently, Donkey Kong Country 2 has runs into a bug in the old SNES
emulator ZSNES, where one of the barrels that you’re supposed to be able
to precisely control the spinning direction of ends up spinning forever.
This bug is caused by ZSNES not emulating open bus behavior. I believe
this was originally discovered by Anomie roughly two decades ago, who
subsequently fixed the same bug in Snes9x. This original fix hardcoded
the specific addresses to return the values that the game depends on
rather than properly emulating open bus, but it fixed DKC2 and probably
didn’t break anything else. The bug was never fixed in ZSNES, which is
now a long abandoned project (last release in 2007). Purely out of
curiosity, I wanted to dig into this a little more to figure out what
exactly in the game code causes these barrels to spin forever in an
emulator that doesn’t emulate open bus behavior. ↫ jsgroth Just in case
you’ve always wanted to know.</p>

id="wayback-experimental-layer-to-run-x-desktop-environments-on-wayland">Wayback:
experimental layer to run X desktop environments on Wayland</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-29, from: OS News</p>
<p>With X.org being in maintenance mode, with the process of replacing
it with Wayland accelerating pretty quickly now, a lot of projects using
X.org are looking for ways to prepare for the future. Alpine Linux, a
distribution focused on musl, BusyBox, and OpenRC, also wants to reduce
its maintenance burden for X11 applications, and so Alpine Linux
maintainer Ariadne Conill has come up with something interesting.
Wayback is an experimental X compatibility layer which allows for
running full X desktop environments using Wayland components. It is
essentially a stub compositor which provides just enough Wayland
capabilities to host a rootful Xwayland server. It is intended to
eventually replace the classic X.org server in Alpine, thus reducing
maintenance burden of X applications in Alpine, but a lot of work needs
to be done first. ↫ Wayback GitHub page It’s nowhere near done and most
likely contains massive amounts of bugs and issues, but the seed has
been planted. Wayback will make it possible to keep running X11-based
desktop environments even in a full-Wayland environment. This may be
necessary in case you need a specific feature not yet available in the
Wayland version of your desktop environment, or if your desktop
environment of choice simply isn’t going to move to Wayland at all (due
to lack of maintainers or whatever). It’ll also be a boon for
retrocomputing, especially as over the coming years and decades
unmaintained X11 desktop environments become become ever harder to keep
running on modern Linux distributions. While X.org as it exists today
certainly isn’t going anywhere any time soon, it will, eventually, stop
working properly on Linux distributions who don’t ship it by default
anymore, and it’s awesome to already have the beginnings of a project to
address this problem.</p>

id="microsoft-to-remove-all-but-the-latest-versions-of-drivers-from-windows-update">Microsoft
to remove all but the latest versions of drivers from Windows
Update</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-29, from: OS News</p>
<p>This blog post is intended to notify all Windows Hardware program
partners that Microsoft has taken a strategic initiative to clean up
legacy drivers published on Windows Update to reduce security and
compatibility risks. The rationale behind this initiative is to ensure
that we have the optimal set of drivers on Windows Update that cater to
a variety of hardware devices across the windows ecosystem, while making
sure that Microsoft Windows security posture is not compromised. This
initiative involves periodic cleanup of drivers from Windows Update,
thereby resulting in some drivers not being offered to any systems in
the ecosystem. ↫ Microsoft’s Hardware Dev Center The general gist is
that Microsoft is going to remove all drivers from Windows Update for
which newer versions exist – or, to put it in a different way, only the
latest versions of a driver are going to remain available on Windows
Update. It’s effectively a clean-up of Windows Update, and the only way
older versions of drivers will remain available on Windows Update is if
the manufacturer in question can make a “business justification” to keep
them around. Some of this may sound surprising, since many people assume
Windows Update only offers the latest versions of drivers – annoyingly
so, sometimes – but this isn’t the case. Corporations with fleets of
devices can actually determine exactly which drivers get sent to their
devices, including opting for older versions in case newer versions have
regressions or otherwise cause issues. Sometimes you just don’t have a
choice. According to Adam Demasi, the creator and maintainer of the
amazing Legacy Update service, Microsoft hasn’t deleted a single driver
or update from Windows Update since 2001 (save for problematic updates).
This results in a truly massive collection of updates and drivers, and
that’s causing real problems for Microsoft. Windows Update has a pretty
cool system of describing whether an update is necessary to be installed
on the current system, or if it is already installed. It also builds a
relationship graph between updates, to indicate when they have been
replaced by a newer update that includes all changes from the previous
update. That system is also its downfall, causing the Windows Update
service to be incredibly slow in checking for updates, possibly never
completing the check at all. This issue also applies to WSUS, which
despite being based on the very robust SQL Server, struggles with the
number of drivers Microsoft hosts on Windows Update. As of April, we
know that Windows Update hosts 1,799,339 drivers, and this creates a 138
GB database that requires almost 16 days to synchronise down from the
main servers. The WSUS server is brought to its knees, with frequent
timeouts while it furiously tries to complete database queries. (The PC
used is a Ryzen 5700G with 32 GB of 3600 MHz RAM and 500 GB of NVMe,
running Windows Server 2025 and SQL Server 2022.) ↫ Adam Demasi From
this, it’s easy to understand why Microsoft would want to perform some
housekeeping, followed by a new set of rules around only keeping the
latest versions of drivers around in Windows Update. Demasi also notes
that these plans by Microsoft won’t affect drivers for old devices,
since they will still be served their “newest” driver version, and it
won’t affect Legacy Update either.</p>
