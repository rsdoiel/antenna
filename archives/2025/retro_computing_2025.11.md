## More pro for the DEC Professional 380 (featuring PRO/VENIX)

date: 2025-03-16, from: Old Ventage Computing Research

In computing the DEC PDP-11 is something of a geologic feature. Plus, as most systems in the family were minicomputers, they had the whole monolith thing going for them too (minus murderous apes and sucking astronauts into hyperspace). Its fame is even more notable given that Digital Equipment Corporation was among the <em>last</em> major computer companies to introduce a 16-bit mini architecture, beaten by the IBM 1130 (1965), HP 2116A (1966), TI-960 (1969) and Data General Nova (1969) &mdash; itself a renegade offshoot of the "PDP-X" project which DEC president Ken Olsen didn't support and even cancelled in 1968 &mdash; leaving DEC to bring up the rear with the PDP-11/20 in 1970.
<p>
So it shouldn't be a surprise that DEC, admittedly like many fellow mini makers, was similarly retrograde when it officially entered the personal computer market in 1982. At least on paper the DEC Rainbow was reasonable enough: CP/M was still a thing and MS-DOS was just newly a thing, so Digital put an 8088 and a Z80 inside so it could run both. On the other hand, the DECmate II, ostensibly part of the venerable PDP-8 family, was mostly treated as a word processor and office machine; its operating system was somewhat crippled and various bugs hampered compatibility with earlier software. You could put a Z80 or an 8086 in it and run CP/M and MS-DOS (more or less), but it wasn't a PC, and its practical utility as a micro-PDP didn't fully match the promise.

<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhi3jqlQ0Q2Cyre7Ecx2fvqAn8pxo8S1PJ0tlVbkT0RFdqlwaAly61RupU7c7EgmxD8K_SnQhF0zfKw2EJuwI_uRcAJSnsUuUUWIvnLGHHS8nHfDPE4IbLejP1UGkG_VpPlqv3h8NIuyjxs5nvj-XXrtFBcr2Ct84Pyg0rUqwSzuIchlfQrc4YAN0fhjsQ/s3525/dec-ad-83.jpg" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; "><img alt="" border="0" width="320" data-original-height="2261" data-original-width="3525" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhi3jqlQ0Q2Cyre7Ecx2fvqAn8pxo8S1PJ0tlVbkT0RFdqlwaAly61RupU7c7EgmxD8K_SnQhF0zfKw2EJuwI_uRcAJSnsUuUUWIvnLGHHS8nHfDPE4IbLejP1UGkG_VpPlqv3h8NIuyjxs5nvj-XXrtFBcr2Ct84Pyg0rUqwSzuIchlfQrc4YAN0fhjsQ/s320/dec-ad-83.jpg"/></a></div>

However, what DEC did to the PDP-11 was odder still. The 1982 DEC Professional 350 had the same F-11 ("Fonz") CPU as the bigger PDP-11/23, though that's where the similarity ends, as it implemented a new bus with completely different option cards and an incompatible interrupt system making it all but impossible to run unmodified PDP-11 programs. It had really nice graphics for 1982, but instead of the usual choices its intended system software was the laughably named Professional Operating System, or P/OS &mdash; execrated for its sluggish menus and limited feature set, of which people were only too quick to make the obvious joke. You could get CPU option cards like the DECmate II's to also make it into a weak PC or a weak CP/M machine, but they ran through P/OS too, and they weren't cheap. At the same time, however, in order to be the most inexpensive PDP-11 system ever, the low-binned DEC Professional 325 didn't even have a hard disk.
<p>
All of these systems were originally meant as commodity machines for office work, yet more or less with the exception of the Rainbow, they couldn't run much that office professionals actually <em>wanted</em> to run and little that existing PDP users did. Still, despite questionable technical choices, these machines (the Pros in particular) are some of the most well-built computers of the era. Indeed, they must have sold in <em>some</em> quantity to justify the Pro getting another shot as a <em>high</em> end system. Here's the apex of the line, the 1984 DEC Professional 380.

The Pro 380 upgraded to the beefier J-11 ("Jaws") CPU from the PDP-11/73, running two to three times faster than the 325 and 350. It had faster RAM and came with more of it, and boasted quicker graphics with double the vertical resolution built right into the logic board. The 380 still has its faults, notably being two-thirds the speed of the 11/73 and having no cache, plus all of the 325/350's incompatibilities. Taken on its merits, though, it's a tank of a machine, a reasonably powerful workstation, and the most practical PDP-adjacent thing you can actually slap on a (large) desk.
<p>
This particular unit is one of the few artifacts I have left from a massive DEC haul almost twelve years ago. It runs PRO/VENIX, the only official DEC Unix option for the Pros, but in its less common final release (we'll talk about versions of Venix). I don't trust the clanky ST-506 hard drive anymore, so today we'll convert it to solid state and double its base RAM to make it even more professional, and then play around in VENIX some for a taste of old-school classic Unix &mdash; after, of course, some history.

The rise of the microcomputer in the late 1970s was an existential threat to traditional minicomputer manufacturers. The minicomputer wasn't named for its size, at least not originally; the term initially was a contraction of the "minimal computer" that could do useful computing tasks with a smaller instruction set and less hardware for less money. With the advancement of technology and semiconductor density, however, microcomputers could do nearly as much, do it in a smaller space and do it even cheaper. At the same time, the emerging "supermini" class, embodied most by DEC's own VAX line, was simultaneously eroding the mini market from the high-end by skimming off its most profitable customers.
<p>
As a first salvo in the war, many mini makers chose to simply shrink their existing proprietary architectures further. Hewlett-Packard, for example, made a well-regarded line of "programmable calculators" and technical workstations out of their HP 2100 (later HP 1000) platform by miniaturizing it as the 1975 Binary Processor Chip. This, in turn, yielded reasonably popular systems like the HP 9830 and HP 9845, though HP was careful never to officially bill them as follow-ons to the originals. Texas Instruments also had similar success, at least early on, by turning the TI-990 (an evolution of the TI-960 and TI-980) into the 1976 TMS 9900 and even made inroads with it into the home computer world as the TI 99/4 family (including clones like <a href="/2024/03/after-41-years-my-first-assembly.html">the Tomy Tutor</a>). It, too, was never sold as a successor to the 990; later 990 hardware even used 9900-series CPUs directly. However, TI got greedy and shortsightedly repulsed third-party development, while the 9900 architecture had what turned out to be a fatal dependence on RAM speed and became a technological dead end.
<p>
More problems occurred after the IBM PC scrambled the landscape and mini vendors tried touting their smaller "microminis" as upmarket alternatives, though these systems were deliberately less powerful than and sometimes mostly or totally incompatible with their big systems to avoid cannibalizing high-end sales. Their prices were likewise uncompetitive, so newer cost-sensitive customers continued buying cheaper PC-compatibles while legacy customers were unhappy their existing software might not work. Attempts to entice that low end by adding more typical microcomputer CPUs as compatibility options, usually the 8086 or 8088, simply made them into poor PCs that cost even more. <a href="/search/label/data%20general">Data General</a> was one notorious instance as they repeatedly failed to parlay their successful Nova into smaller offerings, first with the poorly-received 1977 microNOVA, and later with the microECLIPSE in the bizarre 1983 Desktop Generation modular machines. While Data General claimed it could run everything the bigger MV hardware could, such software had to be converted by vendors "with standard software [in] a few hours" (<i>PC Magazine</i> 11/83), and its PC compatibility side was unable to run major applications like Lotus 1-2-3 without patches. Given how expensive the DG was, most developers didn't bother and most potential customers didn't either. For its part, although early rumours talked about a small System/370, IBM never turned any of their mainframes or minis into commodity microcomputers except for various specialized add-on boards, and the 5150 PC itself was all off-the-shelf.
<p>
Surprisingly, DEC was already in this segment, sort of, albeit half-heartedly and in small quantities. As far back as 1974, an internal skunkworks unit had presented management with two small systems prototypes described as a PDP-8 in a VT50 terminal and a portable PDP-11 chassis. Engineers were intrigued but sales staff felt these smaller versions would cut into their traditional product lines, and Olsen duly cancelled the project, famously observing no one would want a computer in their home. Team member David Ahl was particularly incensed and quit DEC in frustration, going on to found <i>Creative Computing</i>. A charitable interpretation says Olsen may have been referring to the size and state of computers at the time, and most people probably <em>wouldn't</em> have wanted one of those in their house, but it wasn't very future-thinking to imply they'd always stay that way. Olsen reiterated to the World Future Society in 1977 that "[t]here is no reason for any individual to have a computer in their home," later arguing in various retrospectives that he meant no one would want a computer at home controlling everything. True to his words, both Ken Olsen and Gordon Bell reportedly had terminals in their residences but no standalone systems.

Nevertheless, like the BPC, the TMS 9900 and the microNOVA, the 12-bit PDP-8 was itself available also in miniature form as the Intersil 6100 (later second-sourced as the Harris HM-6100), and from this DEC produced the 1977 DECstation VT78, consolidating a 2.2MHz 6100 and 16 kilowords of RAM into a VT52 terminal. Notably, DEC specifically advertised the VT78 as compatible with the PDP-8, offering OS/78 as an update to the original OS/8, despite the fact OS/78 by default deliberately locked users out of the low-level monitor (i.e., you could only use CCL, not KMON, though easy workarounds were known). It was still an expensive unit, starting at $7995 with dual RX02 8" floppy drives (in 2025 over $43,000), and the office-specific Word Station 78 configuration (using the WT78 word processing variant running WPS-8, plus dual floppy drive and printer) was an astronomical $13,990 [$75,800]. Strictly business-targetted and profitable almost entirely because of their margins, they did make enough money to justify a follow-on, the 1980 VT278, a/k/a the original DECmate &mdash; a stripped-down version packed into a VT100 shell with a faster 5MHz Intersil/Harris 6120 CPU and 32kW of RAM, though the reduced hardware made it slower to update the screen. Although the DECmate sold rather better, their large systems generated more earnings overall and none of these machines were ever major priorities to DEC.
<p>
In September 1981, however, Ahl alleged in <i>Creative Computing</i> that Olsen's attitude was changing, possibly goaded by the IBM PC's wildly successful launch in August or maybe when Ahl said "his [Olsen's] daughter begged for a computer at home," adding DEC's new low-end computer would be "based on the venerable PDP-8." (This became, of course, the DECmate II.) Olsen subsequently told investors in November to expect a "DEC personal computer" (his words), adding "we are not planning to go after the home computer market" but that it would be "equivalent" to the IBM PC. In early 1982 he intimated further that there would indeed be an updated DECmate soon, plus two new lower-cost "16-bit" systems. This project, administered by DEC's new Small Systems Group (SSG), was internally referred to as the "XT" Computer Terminal (not to be confused with the IBM PC/XT, which IBM didn't release until March 1983).

The DEC XT 100 was designed as "a desk-top computer primarily intended for applications at a single-user work station in an office environment," according to the DEC SSG internal design document. "This system can be used as an intelligent terminal or a general purpose word-processing and computing tool. Applications for the XT include: word processing, multi-function commercial processing, end-node distributed processing, distributed forms processing, and distributed editing. ... The system is intended to be highly usable by persons with no previous knowledge of computers, electronics, or programming." Eventually two basic versions were envisioned, the XT120 "kernel" system with the CPU board and power supply, 128K (64 kilowords) of RAM, monochrome monitor and "bit map video generator," dual floppy drives and connectors for a line printer, serial modem interface and keyboard, and the deluxe XT150 with 256K (128kW) of RAM and a 5MB ST-506 "Winchester" hard disk. For the XT120 configurations an additional 128K was available as an upgrade. All XT variants were based on the same F-11 CPU, a small LSI multichip implementation of the PDP-11 instruction set, and supported an optional FPU. We'll discuss the finer details of the F-11 when we disassemble the hardware.
<p>
The machines were designed around a new interconnect called the Computer Terminal Internal (inexplicably abbreviated "XTI") bus, using a unique ZIF form factor for its interface cards incompatible with any other PDP-11 system prior or since. Both the XT120 and XT150 came with a full six expansion slots. XTI options developed by the designers included additional memory cards; a telephone management board for receiving, making and recording voice calls; a network interface card; and an Advance Video Option [sic] providing planar colour video. Except for the Winchester disks, DEC SSG explicitly intended to manufacture every single component, and it wouldn't be compatible with existing PDP-11s.
<p>
Late in the product cycle SSG management renamed the DEC XT to the DEC Professional (perhaps DEC had heard what IBM was planning to call its next system), changing the XT120 to the DEC Professional 325 and the XT150 to the DEC Professional 350. Critically, the 325 was made cheaper still by removing two of the XT120's slots, and the XT150 hard disk became optional in the 350; on the other hand, both systems also made the FPU standard. With the XT name shelved, the bus thus properly became the CTI bus. Meanwhile, the 128K RAM base was proving inadequate for its consumer menu-based operating system (what would become P/OS), forcing DEC to ship the RAM upgrade option pre-installed to yield 256K. This was an early sign of problems to come.

When the release date in May came around, Olsen unexpectedly rolled out <em>four</em> microcomputers: the DECmate II and the two Professionals, as predicted, but also the previously unannounced DEC Rainbow 100 aimed directly at the IBM PC 5150. In his remarks at the press conference, Ken Olsen called DEC's personal computer initiative "the largest investment in people and manpower" the company had made in its 25 years of existence. All superficially related units, the industrial design of the four computers was strongly based on the DEC XT prototype. Each system used similar or identical cases, the same monitors, the same floppy drives, the same 103-key keyboard and mostly the same cables, though their guts of course were in some cases very different.
<p>
To industry observers' surprise, DEC uncharacteristically seemed to price the DECmate II and Rainbow to sell. The now 8MHz DECmate II had better hardware yet went for much less than the DECmate ($3745 [$12,600] compared to 1982's later price of $5845 [$19,700]), even considering it needed its own keyboard and monitor. However, what really startled people was the Rainbow. Introduced at $3495 [$11,700], DEC had already slashed it to $2675 [$9000] by the fall. At a time when a reasonably configured IBM PC system might set you back itself around $3500-ish in late 1982, with CPU, monochrome display, base 64K RAM and 180K floppy drive(s), a comparable Rainbow setup with 64K, baseline 400K RX50 5.25" dual drives and serial port, hybrid CP/M-86/80, LK201 keyboard and VR201 monochrome display came in at just over $3700 at the later pricing, with MS-DOS support on the way.<!-- Creative Computing 11/82 p30 --> Although the barebone 16K IBM PC started at $1565 [$5260], DEC wisely predicted most people would opt for the larger RAM.
<p>
Even the higher-end Professionals seemed to be aggressively priced, though admittedly mostly when compared to their mini ancestors, starting with the lowest-spec 325 at $3995 [$13,400]. Their 256K base of RAM came from the original 128K plus the 128K upgrade (both as daughtercards) which was now standard. The Professional 325, sold with four CTI slots and no hard disk option, was proudly cited in DEC's Professional Handbook as "the lowest cost PDP-11 system ever produced." However, the two upper tiers got expensive quickly: the midrange configuration, a 350 without a hard disk, was otherwise the same except for its six CTI slots and sold for $4995 [$16,800], and adding the 5MB hard disk and controller card pushed the total bill to $8495 [$28,500].
<p>
The bloom started coming off the rose when manufacturing problems delayed sales; the 325 and 350 didn't hit the market until almost December, and the Rainbow was stalled for months. Even when people could buy them, DEC's unusual design choices started coming home to roost. None of the systems could format their own floppy disks with their shipping operating systems, leading to user revolt when they were expected to buy preformatted media from DEC directly; officially only later versions of CP/M and MS-DOS for the Rainbow could do this, and some Pro users bought a Rainbow specifically for the purpose. While the Rainbow could read and write specially formatted MS-DOS floppies, its native format was the incompatible (but higher capacity) RX50's, and unlike the 5150 PC its text mode acted like a VT220 terminal with initially no graphics support of any kind &mdash; or ISA slots to add some. (Graphics options later became available.) More ominously for the future, the first version of the Rainbow 100 couldn't boot from a hard drive. As for the DECmate II, it was less expensive and more expandable but to buyers' displeasure somewhat less functional than its predecessor, affected by irregularities in the new OS/278<!-- came out 1984, CW 6/84 --> and compatibility problems with older programs. It also offered no built-in options for acting as a standalone terminal (only software), which was a common use for the DECmate I in office environments.
<p>
Meanwhile, power users found the 325 and 350 slow and ponderous compared to larger PDPs and objected to the Pro family's inability to run traditional PDP-11 environments. Reviewers appreciated the sold build quality and modular design, but complained the machines were heavy and the fans and hard drive were unusually loud. While Pro high-resolution graphics were considered by all to be extremely good, even making an appearance at SIGGRAPH, they were slow to update and scroll, and made using the menu-driven P/OS (based on a modified port of the real-time RSX-11M Plus) feel even more sluggish. Consistent with the XT's office aims DEC had promised early adopters a port of VisiCalc and a word processing package, but by summer 1983 little application software of any sort was available which caused retailers and buyers to start cancelling orders. Dan Bricklin, who himself led the P/OS ports of VisiCalc and TK!Solver, blamed P/OS's large memory footprint in particular and cited poor developer relations with DEC generally.
<p>
In the fall DEC leadership concluded their personal computer strategy was failing and SSG VP Andrew Knowles resigned in September 1983,<!-- CW 9/9/1983 --> the sixth vice-president to leave Digital in two years. Analysts cited high prices, ineffective marketing, weak distribution channels and missing software applications, as well as the Pro's substantial production delays which allowed the IBM PC to flourish at its expense. For its part, the Rainbow's unique architecture became an increasing liability as current software now assumed a true PC compatible and directly accessed the hardware, hampering it from running all but simple or well-behaved DOS applications. In April 1984 DEC introduced the Rainbow 100B, adding hard disk support, improved PC hardware compatibility and twice the base memory at the same price, along with a RAM expansion for both the original Rainbow 100 (now the 100A) and the new 100B, and additional software telecommunications options. On the very low end DEC also shrunk the DECmate II into the less-expensive DECmate III, reducing its options, size and clock speed.

As for the Professional family, DEC reluctantly conceded the machines could never sell in volume as commodity PCs, and began shifting back to enterprise and research customers by reintroducing the Pros as premium workstations. Key to this plan was marketing them explicitly as "personal PDP-11s" even though the only thing the minis and the Pros had in common was their CPUs. As part of the refurbishment, DEC finally enabled the 350's network port with the long-promised CTI Ethernet card in April and added support for Decnet to the new P/OS 2.0; to broaden the operating system choices available, DEC started drawing on additional internal operating system options and contracting outside with others. The real-time RT-11 operating system was reworked as PRO/RT-11 and DEC's CTS-300 and the UCSD p-System were ported as well. DEC also commissioned a port of Standard Micro MUMPS 300, supporting up to seven simultaneous users, and TSX-Plus for timesharing under PRO/RT-11.
<p>
A glaring omission was a native Unix, which categorical PDP-11 minis had been able to run almost from the beginning in 1970. VenturCom, another Massachusetts tech company like DEC, was a current licensee of Version 7 Unix and sold their V7 variant with some BSD enhancements as VENIX (hereafter mostly rendered as Venix to save my eyes), which existed as VENIX-11 for the PDP-11/23 since at least 1982. VenturCom also had a Z80 Venix port at one time and after the introduction of the 5150 PC launched "Project Viking" to port it to the 8086 as well, arriving in January 1983 and beating IBM's PC/IX by a year.<!-- CW 1/83 --> Likely as the quickest means to market, DEC contracted VenturCom to port Venix-11 to the Pro 350 as its official Unix option, adding specific support for the Pro video hardware in its graphics library and including Venix's more unusual features like real-time programming, shared data segments, semaphores and code mapping (to dynamically page executable code in and out of main memory on small systems). We'll talk about why these features were important to DEC when we get to using Venix proper. The result was PRO/VENIX, announced in June 1984, and even included a future-facing UNIX System V license from AT&amp;T. (Later on DEC also commissioned Pro ports of XENIX and Whitesmiths Idris, though it's unclear if these were actually completed or sold.)

The performance of the 325 and 350 in the meantime was becoming less competitive against newer upstarts, so that left a couple more things to do: upgrade to new hardware and cut prices on the old. In September 1984 DEC introduced a substantially redesigned top-of-the-line model, the faster and beefier DEC Professional 380, starting at $8995 [$28,000] with LK201 keyboard, VR201 monochrome display, 512K of RAM and a 10MB hard disk. At the same time, while bumping everyone's base RAM to 512K, they reduced the basic 325 package with keyboard and monitor to $3595 [$11,200] and kept it as the entry level system, while slashing the 350 with a 5MB hard disk to $5600 [$17,500] and with a 10MB hard disk to $6995 [$21,800]. Unlike the last time, there would be no delays: DEC took pains to tell everyone the new Pro 380 was available immediately.
<p>
How <em>I</em> wound up with a 380 is a little more prosaic. In 2013 I got contacted &mdash; I don't recall now exactly how &mdash; about a storage unit owned by a recently deceased individual "with a lot of old computers" that had to be cleaned out, and would I like to see what was there before the scrappers came? (I'm happy to do this and save or re-home any systems I can, but here's a protip: if you value your collection, <a href="/2024/06/the-living-computers-museum-finally-isnt.html">don't ever let it get this far</a>.) Whatever I could haul away was mine and what we couldn't haul away went to recycling that afternoon. So I rented a van and talked my friend Jon into coming along as extra muscle and we drove out to Pasadena to have a look.

When we arrived, we rapidly discovered we were in way over our heads. Near as I could determine the late owner, a former Caltech employee &mdash; this was, after all, in Pasadena &mdash; had been squirreling away DEC hardware as it got decommissioned from the University literally over decades. (Hoarding is such a dirty word.) The unit was cavernous and it was painfully obvious there was no way we could save it all. I do not consider myself a DEC expert now and I definitely wasn't then, so we simply tried to grab anything that looked intact, interesting and not (too) immobile.

Here's Jon with a hernia-inducing hard disk we pulled for display purposes, since we'd never seen a clear one that size with nice platters. We couldn't figure out what it belonged to and you really wouldn't want to drop it on your foot, but we found it fascinating and Jon still adores this particular photo to this day. I estimate it weighed about sixty pounds. (Watch <a href="https://thebxi.com/algorithm">ALGORITHM: The Hacker Movie</a>, written and directed by Jon, streaming free on YouTube!

And here is the only PDP-11 mini to date that I've ever had in my personal possession, a UNIBUS <a href="https://gunkies.org/wiki/PDP-11/44">PDP-11/44</a> in a BA11-A enclosure with a 1350W power supply. We selected this one because it looked like it might work and we could actually get it on the dolly into the van.
<p>
Besides the clear monster hard disk and the 11/44, the other things we hauled away were <a href="https://gunkies.org/wiki/RL01/02_disk_drive">an RL02</a> and whatever hard disk packs we could fit, approximately one metric crap-ton of paper tape, some documentation (including, it turned out, a mostly complete set of Venix manuals for the 350), a couple AUI Ethernet hubs, various random cables, two <a href="https://gunkies.org/wiki/VAXstation_100">VAXstation 100s</a> (I told you I didnt know much about DEC hardware at the time), a somewhat thrashed VT100 terminal I thought I could restore, and, relevant to this post, a DECmate II, a VR201 green screen monitor, a VR241 colour monitor, and &mdash; ta-daa! &mdash; two DEC Pro 380s. Everything was dirty and gritty but other than the whacked VT they were intact, and neither of the monitors had evidence of the "mold spots" or "cataracts" that sometimes afflict these models. That was all we could rescue and there was no time for a second trip or to call anyone else; the scrappers were already pulling up as we tried to get the van door closed.
<p>
Over time, I am relieved to say that to the best of my knowledge none of <em>these</em> items ended up in the skip, or at least not on <em>my</em> account. Unlike the other VAXstations (like the VAXstation 3100 M76 I have, currently my only VAX or VMS system), the VAXstation 100 is in fact a graphical terminal that requires a UNIBUS tether, and is of some specific historical interest (which I was unaware of at the time) because it was part of the transition from the W Window System to X. It has its own 68000 CPU, but it is not a standalone machine, and they turned out to be useless to me because I had no idea how to hook them up to the 11/44. Fortunately I found a home for them. In the end we didn't have the space and I was concerned we didn't have the power to actually fire up the 11/44 either, nor did we ever determine what that monster hard disk went with, so the PDP, the monster, the RL02, the disk packs, the beat-up VT100 and the rat's nest of paper tape went to someone else. I kept the monitors, cables, documentation and the remaining computers and tracked down an LK201 keyboard, and if I get around to finding or making boot disks for it, the DECmate II may be the subject of <a href="/search/label/decmate">a future article</a>.

This is the 380 we'll be using, selected simply because it was the easiest one to get access to (the other is in a deskside case in my large storage unit).

It, like all of the computers from the haul, prominently has CALTECH PROPERTY spray-painted with a stencil onto the case. I suppose I could paint that out but it's part of its history. Let's hope that these machines were legally acquired but I think we're a little past the statute of limitations here should someone at the University want them back.

Rear badges. This is a regular Pro 380, so it is a model PC380 (specifically PC380-AA, the North American unit). However, the nearly indestructable 320W power supply sold in all regions is switchable and happily runs on 50 and 60Hz power from 100V to 240V. The circular aperture is for the built-in circuit breaker &mdash; check this first if the machine won't power on.
<p>
At the top is the Caltech asset tag, using its full name as the California Institute of Technology. The location field is blank and the property number is just its DEC serial number, although there's also a notation "Ref 6005" for its "Dept or Contract." I don't know what this means and I couldn't find a department code 6005 (it's possible this was an old grant or sales contract now lost), but we can nevertheless make a good guess about where it was used because a prior user left his name in a file on the hard disk. This person was indeed Caltech faculty, and based on time stamps in the filesystem we can also ascertain that the machine was most likely decommissioned from Caltech around June 1989. More about that later.

Front badge and power switch. I always liked the Professional logo; it looked, you know, professional. Certain purpose-specific variants of the 380 had different badging; perhaps the most common of these were 380s badged as "VAX Consoles" (model PC38N), used as control consoles on early VAX 8800-family systems with added peripheral hardware for real-time monitoring. This was hardly an unusual task for a PDP-11 given that an 11/03 was the front end for the first VAX, the 1977 VAX-11/780.

Another Pro variant was the Interactive Video Information System, based on 350 (IVIS, PC35V) and 380 (IVIS 2000, PC38V) hardware, that could integrate video from an attached laser disc player and display it on a VR241 or a touch-screen VRTS1 DECtouch. Unfortunately, IVIS units are quite rare and frequently separated from their matched playback devices.

Here are the rest of the rear ports. From left to right, they include the AUI network port (not active without the DECNA option card for Ethernet), the RS-423 serial port (DB-25 male) which we will simply use as a "regular" RS-232 in this article, the serial printer/ODT console port (not a PC COM port and wired differently), and the DEC-specific video port. The serial printer port uses a DEC BCC05 cable to connect a printer (or other serial device) and a BCC08 to connect a terminal for debugging purposes. With a BCC05 cable the printer port can be used like a regular serial port and a null modem is not required: any DB-25 to DE-9 converter of the right gender (such as a modem cable) will do.
<p>
Although the DEC Pro (and Rainbow, and DECmate II) use the same monitors and LK201 keyboard, they do not all use the same video cables. Also, a stern warning: since the video cables carry +12V, <em>never</em> connect them with the system turned on or an inadvertent short could fry any attached keyboard. For the monochrome VR201 display, plug a BCC02 cable into the Pro, plug the RJ-type cable from the LK201 into the VR201, and plug the other end of the BCC02 cable into the VR201. A straight-thru female-to-female DA-15 cable, the same port used for earlier PC joysticks or old Mac monitors, substitutes easily and also works for the DECmate II. In this configuration the monitor and keyboard are powered by the computer. The monochrome video signal can also be displayed on just about any composite monitor.
<p>
For the larger VR241 colour display, plug a BCC03 cable into the Pro, plug the RJ-type cable from the LK201 into the box at the other end of the cable, and attach the BNC R, G and B cables to the appropriate connectors on the monitor. The VR241 additionally requires its own source of wall power, and the BCC03 should not be used with the Rainbow (it uses the BCC17). We'll be using the VR241 here; I've since allocated the VR201 to the DECmate II.
<p>
On the far right in this picture are the status LEDs. The rightmost green LED indicates good power (got a DCOK signal from the power supply) and should stay lit. If this light doesn't come on or the system won't power up generally, check the internal circuit breaker first. The other four red LEDs (numbered 4-1, left to right) start lit and then go out in various order as internal system tests are passed. If any remain lit, there was a fault. In broad strokes, LED 4 indicates which type of error and the other three LEDs are an error code in binary, with LED 1 being the least significant bit. if LED 4 is out, then the system is indicating a problem with a particular slot (e.g., LED 3 and LED 2 on means physical slot 6 is bad). If LED 4 is on, then from 1-7 (0 is unpossible), the keyboard failed or was not detected, no boot device could be found, no monitor cable was connected, both logic board memory banks are bad, the low bank of memory is bad, the high bank of memory is bad, or the system module has failed completely (i.e., all LEDs on and will not extinguish). An on-screen display may give more information and/or additional error codes if enough of the system is working. We'll see an example of that a little later.

It's worth comparing this view with the original ports layout of the DEC XT 100. The same ports on the 380 (and 325/350) were present on the XT, just in different order, but an interesting difference is how it dealt with CTI cards that implement their own I/O ports. This was a significant design consideration since the cards themselves can't be externally accessed in their slots with the case on. In the case of the original telephone management system (TMS), the XT100 had special dedicated ports for it; no other such cards were contemplated at the time.
<p>
Eventually this was judged impractical as other option cards were developed and shipped Pros instead have a removable plate where a secondary port module can be installed. This plate has a visibly different colour on my 380 now due to different manufacture and the ravages of time. The real-time module option, such as those used with the VAX Consoles but also sold separately for general data acquisition, exposed ports here such as IEEE-488; the IVIS machines had an entire interface device connected here dubbed the "backpack" which broke out multiple connectors to and from attached playback hardware.
<p>
As for the TMS itself, in its shipped form it provided built-in voice and modem services using a special telephone line interface module with jacks for the phone handset and lines. Since the Pro had no built-in audio, the line module also had a DIN connector that carried power and signals to an external voice unit used for dialing and as a speakerphone. The TMS was capable of digitizing audio data and storing voicemail and audio recordings to the Pro's hard disk, and playing them back via the voice unit or over the phone line. Playback could be controlled directly from the voice unit.
<p>
All of these extra hardware options were generally supported only in P/OS. An obvious disadvantage to this final layout is that only one such module can be installed at a time, but there were never very many such modules to begin with.

The case is easily removed by pulling two latches on the underside (left and right) and lifting it up and off. This exposes the power supply, RD52 hard disk (in this unit) and RX50 dual 5.25" floppy drive. The card cage with the drive controllers is at the rear, which we will come to presently.
<p>
The RX50 is notable in that it has a single spindle for both drives, and that for the bottom drive the disk is to be inserted <em>upside down</em>. This confused enough people using the Rainbow in particular that DEC eventually put a guide direction arrow inside later units, though this earlier example doesn't have it.

Both the hard drive and the floppy drive sit on sleds along rails. Once disconnected from their controllers and power, each can be easily removed by pressing down the metal lock tab and pulling the drive out. Similarly, when replacing a drive, the metal lock tab automatically engages when the sled is fully inserted. We'll go ahead and remove the drives now so we can get a look at the logic board a little later.

A metal side panel comes off with a couple thumbscrews to expose the card cage and inside backplane. These are where the CTI cards live, up to six in the 380. The red ZIF handle is stamped with the DEC device identification number, in octal because DEC, which DEC exclusively maintained (not like there were many, if any, third party options). Device identification codes are universal and one is assigned to everything in the system, not just cards (e.g., 000001 was the LK201 keyboard, and 040001 would be the TEMPEST shielded keyboard option, which I bet was a tank). Here, 000401 is the hard disk controller for the ST-506 "Winchester" RD52 and 002004 is the floppy disk controller for the RX50. Other common codes you might see here include 001002 and 001403 for the Pro 325/350's video card ("bit map controller") and extended bitmap option card, neither of which are used on the 380, and 000034 for 256K CTI RAM expansion cards like the MSC11-CK (54-15488). These cards are transparently and automatically treated as part of main memory, but there are separate internal slots for RAM too, and we'll get to those.

You'll notice that there aren't card slots in the typical sense, or at least not as people used to PCI or ISA would recognise them. Each card has a little plastic alignment rail that it slides along, but instead of a card edge slot, the electrical connections are made through the "jaws" of the card which clamp onto the the contacts to the right. There are no screws required to secure the card. The leftmost 60 pins of the contacts are for the CTI bus proper and the rightmost 30 are for routing signals to on-board connectors (this is how the DECNA Ethernet card can use the existing AUI network connector, for example), so a card that doesn't need to route signals to one of the ports can just clamp onto the bus 60 and use a smaller set of jaws.

The "jaws," which here are the black block at the bottom right of this card (the floppy controller, using our old friend the Intel 8051 with an 8MHz crystal), are opened when you pull out and turn the ZIF handle. You insert the card as far as it will go, which automatically aligns the jaws over the CTI bus contacts, and then close the jaws over them and secure the handle. The whole process is typical DEC overengineering but I really like how smooth it is (the "Zero Insertion Force" is with us). It sure beats the heck out of trying to pull free a card that won't budge without yanking the connector off the backplane.

The logic board ("system module") sits in a tray under the disks. We first remove the cable to the H7862C power supply, a single row of pins. This cable is often jammed in pretty good and the plastic pull tab helps, but be careful not to pull the metal cover off the connector when digging it out.
<p>
The rechargeable battery pack is for the clock, which is now of course thoroughly dead. We're not going to replace it today and the fact that it is indeed dead was actually useful to this entry. Again, more later when we get to the operating system.

With the logic board out, we see a daughtercard attached to it on the left, and then another slot on the right which is currently unoccupied.

Removing the daughterboard, which sits on four plastic posts with little snaps on top, reveals several custom gate arrays, an Intel 27128 EPROM, a bank of 128K of RAM (seen as 64 kilowords) in sixteen 8264 64Kbit chips on the left, and a white hybrid with two smaller chips embedded in it.
<p>
The gate array marked DC363 at the top left is the video chip, and the 64kW of memory is the base framebuffer. This is the same setup that the 325 and 350 require a separate CTI card for, just with twice the memory; here the video hardware is integrated into the logic board as a phantom seventh CTI slot and addressed in the same way. It provides a single plane of a 60Hz 1024x240 or 50Hz  1024x256 bitmap (typical displayed resolution 960x256). The extra 32kW in the 380 can be displayed as another 256 rows for an interlaced 60Hz 1024x480 or 50Hz 1024x512 image, double the vertical resolution.
<p>
Next to the 64-pin daughtercard connector is another gate array marked DC362. This is the I/O interface gate array and handles all CTI bus activity, including DMA and IRQs. It also multiplexes the CPU boot ROM (the EPROM) so that the CPU gets full 16-bit words, handles all system interrupts, handles support for the maintenance terminal mode, and contains support logic and the baud rate clocking signal for the communications ports.

The third gate array is marked DC365, the control gate array. It provides direct access to onboard memory not on the CTI bus, handles system bus timing and arbitration, and provides singlestepping for the low-level debugger accessed via the printer/console port.

The CPU itself is the 60-pin white hybrid DIP. Starting in 1975, DEC began shrinking down the PDP-11 from discrete logic to ever smaller implementations. The first was the 1976 LSI-11 CPU, introduced with the PDP-11/03, which used the Western Digital MCP-1600 chipset with custom microcode (in three chips) to execute the PDP-11 instruction set. The net effect was roughly an 8-bit CPU emulating a 16-bit one and and while the basic cycle time was a respectable 350ns for a nominal clock speed of 2.857MHz, main memory access times became substantially impaired due to the double-pumped data bus. A worst-case instruction could take tens of microseconds to execute, overall making for what Bob Supnik sardonically called "<a href="https://simh.trailing-edge.com/semi/lsi11.html">the slowest PDP-11 ever produced</a>," though they were nevertheless cheaper and the CPU modules in particular became very popular.
<p>
The success of the LSI-11, and its attendant disadvantages, spurred DEC to develop its own designs. These commenced with the <a href="https://simh.trailing-edge.com/semi/f11.html">F-11</a> "Fonz" chipset, used in KDF11 CPUs starting with the 1979 11/23, and was a true 16-bit microarchitecture. In the DEC Pro 325 and 350, it was called the KDF11-CA CPU and consisted of five chips fabricated on a 6-micron process consolidated into three hybrid 40-pin DIPs that implement the standard PDP-11 instruction set, the EIS (extended instruction set), and FP-11 floating point instructions. The data chip (containing all non-float registers and scratchpads, the ALU and conditional branching logic) and the control chip (containing the microcode) are on one DIP together equivalent to the KEV11-B, the MMU is its own DIP equivalent to the KTF11-A, and the floating point adapter is spread over two chips on the third equivalent to the KEF11-A. Interestingly, the actual floating point <em>registers</em> are stored in the MMU. The F-11 as implemented in the 325 and 350 can address up to 4MB (22-bit) with 1MB reserved for option cards and I/O, though it lacks split I+D mode (again, we'll talk about this when we discuss Venix's internals) and has no cache. CPU timings are derived from a 26.666MHz crystal and divided by two to yield the 13.333MHz master CPU clock,<!--OSC H pro300tecV1 5-21 --> which is internally divided again by four to yield its nominal clock rate of 3.333MHz.<!-- access/decode/execute uins overlaps four clock periods, 5-17 -->
<p>
The <a href="https://simh.trailing-edge.com/semi/j11.html">J-11</a> "Jaws" chip shown here in the Pro 380 is more compact than the F-11 and higher performance, but the processor ended up less powerful than it was intended to be: Supnik describes the design as "idiosyncratic," stating that its complexity and size overwhelmed development partner Harris, and the chips had so many problems with yield and bugs that "Jaws" never reached its internal clock speed goal of 5MHz. The basic package consisted of two 4-micron chips on one carrier, a data chip with the ALU, external interfaces, MMU and registers, and a control chip with the microcode. Pads on the underside of the hybrid were to accommodate two more chips, likely for additional instruction set options, but this idea was never implemented. Internally the J-11 also appears to divide its clock by four.<!-- pro300tec provides no new timings for J-11, also https://wfjm.github.io/home/w11/impl/performance.html, also consistent with Supnik's estimates --> The J-11 was introduced with the PDP-11/73 in 1984, using the 15MHz (i.e., 3.75MHz) KDJ11-B CPU card with an 8K write-through cache and a separate floating point accelerator, and likewise implements the base instruction set, the EIS and FP-11. DEC's fastest J-11s eventually topped out at 4.5MHz (on an 18MHz clock), though the Mentec M100 reportedly pushed it to 4.9152MHz (on a 19.66MHz clock). Unfortunately the 380's J-11 (the KDJ11-C) is somewhat gimped by comparison, having been downlocked to 10.08MHz (divided down from the 20.16MHz system master clock crystal near the DC 363) for an effective internal clock speed of 2.52MHz, and lacking any options to add cache or floating point acceleration. However, it does implement split I+D, and Venix even makes use of the feature. Because the J-11 also requires fewer cycles per instruction and the 380's RAM is faster, the 380 is anywhere from two to three times quicker in practice than the 325/350 despite being clocked slower, and the CPU collectively uses less than a fifth of the power.
<p>
A third and even smaller DEC-designed PDP-11 CPU was also available, the 7.5MHz/10MHz <a href="https://simh.trailing-edge.com/semi/t11.html">T-11</a> "Tiny" chip. The T-11 was introduced in 1981 and is a single-chip CPU with no MMU or floating point support fabricated on a 5-micron process with 12,000 transistors. DEC intended this processor for embedded systems and used it in some disk controllers and the VT240 terminal, but its most famous use was as the main CPU of the Atari System 2 arcade board (some of my favourite arcade games like Paperboy, 720 and the best one of all time, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZbCxPDQRQ4">APB</a>, which I played for the first time as a kid in the Disneyland arcade &mdash; who <em>doesn't</em> like donuts, demerits and police brutality?). It was indisputably the most successful of the PDPs-on-some-chips and produced in the hundreds of thousands. These particular CPUs and the PDP-11 architecture generally were all mercilessly ripped off by the Soviets, by the way, and one very small CPU in this family we may visit <a href="/search/label/pdp-11">at another time</a>. For that matter, the Red Menace even made clone Pros!

The daughtercard is the 380-specific version of the Extended Bitmap Option, or EBO (what was called the AVO in the original XT design). On the 325 and 350, this is an additional CTI card connected to the video card with a ribbon cable. In all cases it contains either 128K (64kW, 325/350) or 256K (128kW, 380) of additional memory to add two additional bitplanes and is required for a colour image. On a colour system, the base memory becomes the blue plane, and the two planes on the EBO card provide red and green (and sync moves from blue to green when the EBO is installed); on a monochrome system, the two extra EBO planes add more shades of grey. The 380 EBO has two more DC363s, one for each added plane.
<p>
The hardware supports reducing the horizontal resolution to 512 or 256 to add additional bits to each larger pixel and get more simultaneous colours. In fact, the EBO makes it possible with careful but relatively simple programming to get up to a full 256x256 (on the 380, 256x512) picture in 4096 colours directly supported by the hardware, which was really quite something for a 1982 computer. I'll show you a brief example presently.

Up near the card backplane, where the on-board DC 363 video control gate array sits, are the 20.16MHz system crystal, the Motorola MC146818 real-time clock, and the clock battery terminals (going to the rechargeable battery pack we saw a couple pictures ago).

<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEglpp_1fntWmv0Idf668I3u7wd6oGg3aOcnxrZoXnAL7XJJzTxFiTD8rRhX_PKT5YkIhSjwkGsTcy4D1iFoneADLpO7pymJC-4rpa1sEtSuLRLHzGcuB1fAqPBsT6m9HrFLSRA-8EIv9rKRkgP9MhcqPJHgrAB4e6Ga5XoRGogAGBXMKvE79Omtj8JsNhs/s4080/PXL_20250209_015003690~2.jpg" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; "><img alt="" border="0" width="320" data-original-height="3072" data-original-width="4080" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEglpp_1fntWmv0Idf668I3u7wd6oGg3aOcnxrZoXnAL7XJJzTxFiTD8rRhX_PKT5YkIhSjwkGsTcy4D1iFoneADLpO7pymJC-4rpa1sEtSuLRLHzGcuB1fAqPBsT6m9HrFLSRA-8EIv9rKRkgP9MhcqPJHgrAB4e6Ga5XoRGogAGBXMKvE79Omtj8JsNhs/s320/PXL_20250209_015003690~2.jpg"/></a></div>

The main RAM of the 380 is in the middle, its baseline 512K/256kW. It has a single 40-pin card port that can take an optional 512K/256kW board to double its memory to 1MB. By contrast, the 325 and 350 have no RAM on board; they ship with two ports, both of which originally came with two 128K/64kW daughterboards. Once the logic board slots are occupied, further expansion is only possible with CTI RAM boards like the 256K card. The 380's 512K card is compatible with the 325 and 350 as well, and the two cards in those machines do not have to be the same size. With two 512K modules the 325 and 350 can also reach 1MB. We'll put something here at the end of our upgrade.
<p>
If you do need more than 1MB of RAM you can try to find more CTI cards, though as a practical matter even with a six slot 380 you could only get up to 2MB with the available 256K CTI RAM boards and still have a bootable floppy and hard disk (one slot each). Also visible here are the NEC D7201C and Motorola MC2661PC, which service the printer and RS-423 ports. 
<p>
That suffices as a short tour of the hardware. Let's next get to our first and primary upgrade, converting the hard disk to solid state. I should note that pretty much exactly the same steps will work for the Pro 350 and serve generally for other systems with similar hard drives.

<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhfJ8r4HmqA1Y8eKwGFGPtoFT1GBdNOPc8dqmTeetbjFaErKi39bLahyphenhyphen6C7tVOO1orP9UjRAZx4ZdSRPAVKz01S5qrR68I2resiPr1j_ZS5HK4LwT9Ktmu1JhuR9-LKdHYHUTcKVmG7ey14MbLFFp-NscAu8yathzyCao-1SGPFQa1EZpTm29bvRdUDdy8/s4080/PXL_20250208_204354692.jpg" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; "><img alt="" border="0" height="320" data-original-height="4080" data-original-width="3072" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhfJ8r4HmqA1Y8eKwGFGPtoFT1GBdNOPc8dqmTeetbjFaErKi39bLahyphenhyphen6C7tVOO1orP9UjRAZx4ZdSRPAVKz01S5qrR68I2resiPr1j_ZS5HK4LwT9Ktmu1JhuR9-LKdHYHUTcKVmG7ey14MbLFFp-NscAu8yathzyCao-1SGPFQa1EZpTm29bvRdUDdy8/s320/PXL_20250208_204354692.jpg"/></a></div>

As befits the era, the RD hard disks in the DEC Pros are ST-506 MFM drives; you could get them in 5MB (RD50), 10MB (RD51), 30MB (RD52, this 380) and 70MB (RD53) capacities. ST, in this case, stands for Shugart Technology (for founder Al Shugart) and later Seagate Technology. To modern eyes the immediately distinguishing feature of ST-506 and later ST-412 devices are their separate control and data cables. The control cable is 34-pin and likewise similar to a Shugart floppy drive interface, while the data cable is 20-pin and carries analogue signals. The cables connect to card edges on the drive and pin headers on their external controller card, which interprets the analogue pattern and sends it as data to the computer.
<p>
Just like you can buy SCSI emulators nowadays like the O.G. SCSI2SD and the later ZuluSCSI and BlueSCSI units, and I use them a lot, there are MFM emulators that serve an analogous function for even older drives like these. In my opinion the best one you can get is <a href="https://www.pdp8online.com/mfm/mfm.shtml">David Gesswein's MFM hard disk reader and emulator</a>, which can read an existing drive to an image and then immediately substitute for it. It's not a dirt-cheap device but you get what you pay for. It has separate connectors for reading and for emulation, and looks to the Pro almost exactly like the hard disk that used to be there.

This unit is an older Revision B that I bought directly from Dave a few years ago (the project is now up to Revision D) and it sat on my shelf until this latest round tuit. It is operated by a BeagleBone (Black or, in this case, Green) running <a href="https://www.pdp8online.com/mfm/revb/software.shtml">custom software on Debian Linux</a> for which the rest of the hardware is implemented as a cape. Dave's software is all open-source and included in the operating system image. Although you can power the BeagleBone itself over USB, the cape requires +12V that we'll pull from the connector for the RX50, since we need to keep the other connector to power the RD52. The large bank of capacitors acts as reserve power so that the BeagleBone is able to cleanly shutdown when it notices the main system power is off. We'll take advantage of that for another purpose as well.

<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj0e95CebnbGyzH_m4CGFw_pEWH5T2Il_iaITKlwV7JF8Wvm1hZ5brlLxfIuoIgStEHkbTC3rAq0R1ttOkfGIOVgsIk0wA-cOCYr-m3x8V08kCidwLb5uTZ54kNxLMTJnQstLFfYXVopbvIFr5bT6MrqbKeFbwoiNJpaLo8ltRfIbpAEVlKCtRbT6dclS8/s4080/PXL_20250208_210201566.jpg" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; "><img alt="" border="0" width="320" data-original-height="3072" data-original-width="4080" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj0e95CebnbGyzH_m4CGFw_pEWH5T2Il_iaITKlwV7JF8Wvm1hZ5brlLxfIuoIgStEHkbTC3rAq0R1ttOkfGIOVgsIk0wA-cOCYr-m3x8V08kCidwLb5uTZ54kNxLMTJnQstLFfYXVopbvIFr5bT6MrqbKeFbwoiNJpaLo8ltRfIbpAEVlKCtRbT6dclS8/s320/PXL_20250208_210201566.jpg"/></a></div>

That said, the capacitors ended up more of a hindrance than a help during initial configuration (admittedly Dave warns against this too) and I recommend pulling their jumper unless you want to test them out or until you're ready to leave the emulator installed; it isn't safe to go messing with the BeagleBone when the caps are hot and it's obviously harder to powercycle. On Revision C and later boards there is a drain position for the jumper but on this Revision B the jumper only controls whether the capacitors are actually in-circuit. The red LED indicates when the capacitors are charged because inadvertently shorting these big 10-farad monsters with your finger will likely be highly unpleasant, and even in the drain position (or on this board connecting something like a 560 ohm resistor from R13 to ground) it will take about an hour for the caps to fully discharge. In my case I had to leave the jumper off overnight after doing the initial test.
<p>
The BBG's microUSB USB client port is what we'll use for a serial console since it's easy to access and a bog-standard FTDI that just about anything will have drivers for (it worked out of the box with my POWER9 Fedora Linux box and my M1 MacBook Air). You can also use the usual 3V3 serial adapter on the BeagleBoard itself but this is hard to do with the cape on. Even though USB power is not enough to bring up the entire assembly, you can at least access the BBG separately this way. We aren't going to bother with networking it. Dave supports both Debian 7 and 11 as of this writing, but I've elected for Debian 7 because it uses less of the internal flash and boots faster.

With the BBG connected to the M1 MBA, we are able to get a login prompt (use 115200bps). The login is <tt>root</tt>, no password. Here we'll test out the capacitors before we continue.

The powerfail system is what monitors the power supply and forces the BBG to shut down if the voltage is below a critical level. Here the voltage is as we expect, so we'll next do a test powered restart:

The card duly goes down and immediately comes back up, so we can consider the power subsystem to be good. After logging back in we'll power down the board completely to hook it up. (You may need to forcibly remove and replace the Molex power connector after shutdown to get it to restart.)

The first step in reading the drive is to connect its control and data cables to the pin headers on the MFM emulator, which for this step will act like a controller. There is only one 34-pin control port but the spec allows for multiple drives that can share it, each of which has its own data connection. For the most common situation of a single drive to be cloned and emulated, use the control and data headers sitting next to each other on the side of the board.

<tt>--analyze</tt> is intended for figuring out operating parameters on a disk you don't know, but we already know at least the geometry for the RD52, and it appears it didn't guess quite right which is why I halted it after seeing copy errors. Interestingly it detected the setup as an <tt>Elektronica_85</tt>, which is in fact one of the godless pinko Commie Soviet PDP-11 clones (please send hate mail to <tt>/dev/null</tt>).

However, <tt>--analyze</tt> did correctly get the number of heads and cylinders (8 and 512 respectively), and did properly find the hard disk on drive select 1 as configured from the DEC assembly line. We can try the copy again with a simpler set of options, and this time it succeeds, yielding an 85MB image file. This file is as large as it is because it captures all the transitions for a very accurate copy. We'll leave it on the BBG internal flash for now (Venix does have a fixed-size swap partition but we'll have enough memory so that it won't have to use it much).

To do that, of course, we'll have to remove the old hard disk and pull its cables off.

Naturally, the RD52 isn't made by DEC; it's an OEMmed Quantum Q540. Notice the faded sticker on top with the bad blocks list (or what Quantum called a "media defect report"). A certain number of bad blocks were inevitable in every early hard disk, even factory-new ones, due to their more primitive manufacture. That's one thing about vintage computing I definitely <em>don't</em> miss.

With the cables off, we see the card edges for both the control and data lines. This drive can pull up to 37 watts at 12 volts, which would be a little over three amps.

Most of its chips carry 1983 or 1984 production dates, with the main microcontroller in the centre marked for 40th week 1984 which is roughly the age of the drive. While Quantum's part number is opaque, it is most likely a 4-bit National Semiconductor COP440 or similar with its own internal 2K mask ROM and 128 nybbles of RAM. That said, the 5.0MHz crystal next to it could not (directly) be its clock source as the COP's internal clock divider is only 16x and its maximum cycle time was 4us.

Just to show how far we've come, I plunked the old drive on my wife's kitchen scale (don't worry, I cleaned it afterwards). At 2.836kg, roughly six and a quarter pounds, we've just given the 380 a massive GLP-1 injection. How pro is <em>that</em>?

<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgGlJsgecuk-fumX76RhOCDMDbAGfqpNtEkDNri0-2OmLHaRrYPmLm3fmuHU9XlzP-fQgMO4pkcGalgXdhWiOuQFAPxoRUDVzdTCc_i8TtUBmSVlaKAykjUz-3N9Pjo_U48ai9URLY62ymgeq53iewHO_JtheS1dkiWwg2YK_OKrHGxuQsBa4jxqAS5akw/s4080/PXL_20250208_223327938.jpg" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; "><img alt="" border="0" width="320" data-original-height="3072" data-original-width="4080" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgGlJsgecuk-fumX76RhOCDMDbAGfqpNtEkDNri0-2OmLHaRrYPmLm3fmuHU9XlzP-fQgMO4pkcGalgXdhWiOuQFAPxoRUDVzdTCc_i8TtUBmSVlaKAykjUz-3N9Pjo_U48ai9URLY62ymgeq53iewHO_JtheS1dkiWwg2YK_OKrHGxuQsBa4jxqAS5akw/s320/PXL_20250208_223327938.jpg"/></a></div>

At this point there are no original storage devices in the system, and if you turn on the 380 as such, you'll get an error screen from DEC's much ballyhooed self-test system. Actually, for 1982 (the 325 and 350 use the same screen), it's pretty good: you have a graphical view of the system and if the ROM can localize the error, it will draw it on screen for you along with error codes. The codes have the device identification number which you can either match to a CTI card or look up in the manual. Since neither the RX50 nor the RD52 or its elegant substitute are connected to their controllers, the firmware highlights the first two card slots, and draws an image of a missing boot floppy. As there are multiple "failures" we get a slightly unhelpful device ID 177776 and error code 0377 (remember, everything is octal because DEC), which is technically a "non-existent memory trap."
<p>
We'll call that our point of comparison and now do a final dry run. For this part I temporarily switched the MFM emulator over to a stand-alone power supply. Even though the caps will get the MFM unit through a power-down to enable the drive from the BBG's shell, it's possible to get the device into a state where the caps are charged just enough to make it weird, and then you have to wait for things to drain. Better in this case to just run it off something else.
<p>
With the machine off, let's bring the emulated drive up first:

The Venix kernel comes up, but you can see on the blue plane the error message that was triggered: slot 02, device error 0220, device identification code 002004, which the Technical Manual says was caused when it "[t]ried to access an unavailable diskette." Interestingly, this appears to be a different code from, say, 0030, which means the drives didn't respond at all, and obviously this error does not occur when Venix starts up with empty floppy drives.
<p>
We can continue from this error but I'd really rather have the system come up properly. The simplest thing to do at this point is to put the RX50 drives back in and reconnect them (or replace them with Goteks, but that will be a more involved project &mdash; long story there), and power cycle the system with the MFM emulator still serving the drive.

<tt>fsck</tt> succeeds on both filesystems (<tt>/</tt> and <tt>/usr</tt>). Qapla'!
<p>
Seemingly (that's called foreshadowing, kids) the last step should be to make the BBG automatically start serving the drive on powerup. Dave provides this facility as a <tt>systemd</tt> service. We edit <tt>/etc/mfm_emu.conf</tt> and set <tt>EmuFN1="/opt/mfm/emufile_a"</tt> in that file, then <tt>systemctl enable mfm_emu.service</tt> and
put on the capacitor jumper so we have bridging power.
<p>
When I ran this all from the separate power supply, the board came up and started serving the drive image, I powered on the system, and Venix booted. When I turned off the separate power supply after powering off the system, the board properly shut down. When I ran all this from the <em>system</em> power supply, however, it wouldn't ever see the emulated hard disk and wouldn't ever boot. Can you figure out why?
<p>
Pencils down: the <em>BBG</em> wasn't booting fast enough. I let the whole thing discharge overnight, took the BBG out of the MFM cape and put it on the workbench.

This is still not fast enough for the Pro to see the emulated disk on startup. Even hacking the first three scripts to exit 0 immediately only got me down to about 7 seconds (apparently most of the overhead is from just launching them in the first place), and we've also not accounted for the time needed to bring the MFM emulator up either. I undid these changes; everything else is too slight to significantly matter. We simply can't seem to beat the Pro's firmware to come up first before the Pro concludes no hard disk is present.
<p>
However, we have an alternative. We know that if we give the BBG enough time &mdash; and "enough time" is now around seven or eight seconds &mdash; we <em>can</em> get the system up. We also know from testing and Dave's estimates that the supercapacitor bank will get us at least 30 seconds of runtime (in fact, in practice it seems to be several minutes or more on this Revision B).
<p>
I logged back into the BBG, edited <tt>/etc/mfm_emu.conf</tt> and added <tt>PowerFailOptions="-w 20"</tt> . What this allows us to do is power on the Pro, charge the capacitors (very fast) and start bringing up the BBG while the Pro's initial boot fails. With our new shortened boot time the BBG will be ready and waiting by the time the Pro displays its error screen. We then power <em>the Pro off</em> and power it back on. As long as the power cycle is less than 20 seconds (I eventually upped this to 30 as there appears to be plenty of power available), the BBG will ride the stored charge and keep serving the emulated disk image so that on that <em>second</em> power-on (and every power-on thereafter) the Pro will see the drive and boot from it. When we're done with a session, we power the system off for more than thirty seconds, causing the BBG to shut down cleanly as expected.
<p>
With that sorted, let's do the memory upgrade too.

The hardest part here was finding the 512K upgrade card. Fortunately, someone had a NOS upgrade (MSC11-B) that even came in a sealed antistatic bag with the manual.

The card itself is quite simple, consisting of sixteen 256Kbit DRAMs (yielding 512K/256kW) with some glue logic.

If you remember that open slot over the logic board RAM, that's where we'll be putting it, next to the 380 EBO card. The card sits in its own set of snaps, though only one side of the card snaps actually has mounting posts. That's all you have to do to install it. We'll put the Pro back together for hopefully the last time for awhile.

Let's turn our attention now to Venix for the final segment of this article, which as you'll recall from our prior history was best known for its presence on the original IBM PC (there was even a port of it to the Rainbow). In that specific market it was almost certainly the earliest such licensed Unix (in 1983) and primarily competed against XENIX, Microsoft's dominant "small Unix," which first emerged for XT-class systems as SCO XENIX in 1984. You'd wonder how rogue processes could be prevented from stomping on each other in such systems when neither the Intel 8086/8088 nor the IBM PC nor the PC/XT had an MMU, and the answer was not to try and just hope for the best. It was for this reason that IBM's own Unix variant PC/IX, developed by Interactive Systems Corporation under contract as their intended AT&amp;T killer, was multitasking but single-user since in such an architecture there could be no meaningful security guarantees. Some early 8086 systems got around the problem by implementing their own MMU, but such systems were frequently incompatible with others and required specific support in-kernel. Only with the 80286 and the IBM PC/AT did a more general scheme for protected memory become possible. Venix/86 was the first licensed Unix on the AT as well, upstaging IBM and SCO yet again in 1985.
<p>
Mapping large tracts of memory on a 16-bit system is kludgey. Like the 8086, the PDP-11 is fundamentally limited to a 64K address range, being the largest quantity that can be expressed in 16 bits, and like the 8086, additional address bits to reference more memory are provided by specific segment registers. The 8086 famously uses its segment registers as the most significant 16 bits of a 20-bit address, added to a 16-bit offset. By contrast, PDP-11 systems with memory management hardware define eight available segments (which DEC documentation sometimes called "pages") that can be up to 8K/4kW in 64-byte increments and point anywhere in physical memory on a 64-byte boundary. Each segment register set controls a fixed 8K/4kW slice of the 64K logical address range (e.g., segment 6 controls logical addresses 0140000 to 0157777, or $c000 to $dfff in hexadecimal; segment 0 controls $0000 to $1fff). In the F-11 and J-11, these Page Address Registers are 16 bit, so 16 bits to specify 64-byte blocks allows 22-bit physical addressing (16 + 6). The corresponding Page Description Register has a seven-bit field for specifying the length, thus allowing a maximum segment size of 8K/4kW (128 times 64 is 8192). These segment registers exist at fixed physical locations in high memory. With eight segments of up to 8K each the 64K addressing space was thus fully populated and the mappings could be changed on the fly as needed, with security bits to set how that memory could be used by this or other processes. (Compare with bank switching schemes on 8-bit computers with similar fundamental addressing limits like the Commodore 64 or 128 or Apple IIe, or NES mappers.)
<p>
The J-11 is capable of an additional trick called split I+D, shorthand for split instruction and data. Split I+D provides <em>two</em> sets of segment registers, one for instruction fetches and one for data, effectively turning a notionally Von Neumann CPU into a Harvard one. Instructions, plus their operands, addresses and constants embedded in the instruction stream come from the I-space segments; loads and stores to memory addresses, however, reference the D-space segments. This effectively allows 128K to be addressed more or less at once, albeit with a bit of bookwork. (Again, also compare with the MOS 6509, a 6502 with on-board registers to set execution and indirection banks, though the banks are granular only to the 64K level.)

Venix had several unique properties that made it of interest to DEC, not least of which that it already could run on PDP-11 systems as Venix-11. Because of its heritage on hardware with limited address spaces, Venix-11 and PRO/VENIX natively implement several specific strategies to run program code depending on its size. Simple binaries in Venix-11 and PRO/VENIX use a straightforward linear mapping where segment 7 holds the stack and memory-mapped registers in the upper 8K range and code and data occupy the remaining 56K. If there is enough room after the program text in memory for data, the binary can even be marked "pure" (i.e., it is fixed and unchanging) to allow multiple users to share the same program image. (This was not an unusual thing to do in operating systems of that era with limited memory. One with a similar facility that comes to mind is AMOS, the operating system of <a href="/2020/09/hacking-gopher-client-into-alpha-micro.html">the Alpha Micro</a>, where you can mark programs as reentrant [other users can run the same image] or reuseable [the image doesn't have to be reloaded from disk].)
<p>
Programs that require a much larger code size can be linked with code mapping, where as long as individual object modules (i.e., its component <tt>.o</tt> files) are each less than 8K, segment 1 can be used to page them in and out for a program size that can be as large as physical memory minus the size of the Venix kernel minus the size of the process' data. A fixed segment containing the paging support logic, function mapping table and other code sits in the lowest 8K controlled by segment 0, with up to 48K of data controlled by segments 2-6 and stack in the usual location controlled by segment 7. Alternatively, on J-11 systems the C compiler is split I+D aware and code can be compiled to support it (though such binaries will not run on a 325 or 350). Since both code-mapped and split I+D executables necessarily can't modify their program text, they can be run "pure" too.
<p>
The PDP-11 Venices additionally provide special system calls for its own implementation of shared memory which it calls "shared data segments" (this feature was also available on Venix/86, albeit with different arguments and semantics, and Venix-specific code was generally not portable between architectures). This facility allows a second data segment to be dynamically constructed and mapped into one of the 8K segments. By using a filename a <tt>mmap()</tt>-like facility becomes possible which can also be shared by other processes, and it can page the segment window over a much larger range using a disk-backed file to handle addressing data spaces larger than 56K. IPC is further aided by a simple (though ultimately future-incompatible) implementation of semaphores, permitting local and global locks, which mainline AT&amp;T Unix did not support until System V. Venix additionally supports real-time programming, allowing programs running as root to run at exclusive priority, lock their processes in memory, and directly access I/O by using another Venix-specific system call to point a segment at the device's physical address (usually segment 6, generally free except in code-mapped executables and programs with unusually large text segments). DEC, having a substantial investment in its own real-time operating environments for data acquisition and process automation, particularly valued a Unix option that could do so as well.
<p>
To see a bit of this in operation, consider this complete program in C (written in K&amp;R C, because that was the era). It is a direct C-language port I made of a 4096-colour demonstration originally written in PDP-11 assembly <a href="https://forum.vcfed.org/index.php?threads/my-research-about-graphics-of-the-pro.1244252/page-3#post-1342244">by vol.litwr</a>. Remember, <tt>int</tt> in this environment is 16-bit.

This code maps the registers for the 380's onboard video hardware into segment 6 using Venix's <tt>phys(2)</tt> system call, then manipulates the registers to draw to the individual video planes. There's no cache and the Venix PDP-11 C compiler is fairly simple-minded, so we can simply directly drive the registers in a way that would make a modern C programmer blanch. (Rust programmers, just look away and go to your happy place.) Compiled with <tt>cc -o test test.c</tt>, the result looks like this (<tt>./test</tt>):

Obviously the code is completely un-portable to anything else, and the address to the <tt>phys()</tt> call needs to be adjusted to point to your video card if you try to run this on a 350 (which will vary on the slot). However, it works, and it's very pretty. We'll be messing around more with Pro graphics in <a href="/search/label/decpro">a future article</a>. The code we ran here directly accesses the hardware, but Venix included a complete high-level graphics package for both Venix/86 and PRO/VENIX with more typical drawing functions that operated at the Pro's maximum resolution. This package was in turn used for Unix commands to draw shapes and graphs, which I'll demonstrate.
<p>
VenturCom initially had a Unix Version 7 (V7) license, the last Bell Labs release in 1979 before AT&amp;T took it over and the first iteration of Unix generally considered readily portable. XENIX on x86 was also initially derived from this version. V7 was the earliest mainline release to officially integrate (among other things) the Bourne shell, <tt>awk</tt>, a Fortran-77 compiler, a portable C compiler (though the C compilers in Venix/86 and Venix-11 seem to have different lineages), <tt>uucp</tt>, <tt>tar</tt> and <tt>make</tt>, though development versions of these tools appeared in other Bell Labs variants like Programmer's Workbench (PWB/UNIX). In addition to their custom changes, Venix further added several components from 4BSD, most notably the C-shell (I'm one of <em>those</em> people), <tt>more</tt> and <tt>vi</tt>.
<p>
V7 Unix was the basis for the original Venix-11, which wasn't much of a stretch since V7 Unix already ran there, and by descent PRO/VENIX in July 1984 on the 350. This package was sold explicitly with a future UNIX System V license which had just come out in 1983. In October 1984 VenturCom upgraded PRO/VENIX to "Rev 2.0" (and misnamed it VENIX/PRO in the release notes) which fixed some bugs and added support for the 380 while remaining compatible with the 350. I'm emphasizing the <em>Rev</em> part; it will shortly become salient. Here's PRO/VENIX <em>Rev</em> 2.0 on <a href="https://xhomer.isani.org/xhomer/">Xhomer</a>, a Pro 350 emulator which provides a pre-installed disk image:

If you log into the console as <tt>demo</tt>, you get a little graphics demonstration.

In those days the various ports of Venix were more or less in sync. <em>Rev</em> 2.0 was still based on V7, effectively the Pro version of Venix/86 Encore from September 1984 (and the same release used on the Rainbow as Venix/86R), most easily distinguished because of the missing <tt>uname</tt> command and underlying system call which weren't added until UNIX System III. The kernel is an ordinary executable (again, salient shortly). There is no formal <tt>shutdown</tt> procedure for any of these earlier releases of Venix (<tt>shutdown</tt> doesn't even exist) &mdash; you just get everyone out and turn the computer off.
<p>
PRO/VENIX V2.0 (<em>not</em> Rev 2.0), however, is a different animal. It was released in July 1985 and primarily intended for the 380, though a set of 350 overlay disks patch the kernel and certain other large programs during installation; you can't boot PRO/VENIX V2.0 on a 325 or 350 without them. True to VenturCom's word, it leapfrogged UNIX System III completely and is in fact a derivative of System V Release 2 (SVR2 or V.2). The V is deliberate and capitalised for a reason: it's for System V, not short for Version. V2.0 was explicitly intended to correspond with System V 2.0. It was the final release of PRO/VENIX and the version we have on our 380 here. 
<p>
As a parenthetical note, Venix/86 2.1 was the last of the original version number sequence; 2.1 is actually less advanced than PRO/VENIX V2.0 despite the lower apparent "version" number and better considered as an upgrade to Venix/86 Encore as it remains based on V7.

Our memory upgrade was successful; Venix sees the full megabyte. (I might go hunting for some 256K CTI RAM boards at some point just to really pimp this sucker out.)
<p>
If you boot the operating system unattended, it will still go into normal mode (maintenance mode is single user), but it will also force an <tt>fsck</tt> whether the disk needs it or not:

Fortunately that process is now noticeably faster (and much quieter) with the MFM emulator running things. Let's hop in.

One of Venix's interesting little idiosyncrasies, seen in all three Pro versions, was the <tt>SUPER</tt> prompt when you've logged on as <tt>root</tt> (there is also a <tt>MAINT&gt;</tt> prompt when you're single-user; I'll show that when we actually shut down at the end). This prompt and an associated warning comes from Venix's default <tt>.profile</tt>.
<p>
The screenshot here is a direct monochrome grab from the Pro's planar video using the <tt>pscreen</tt> utility which emits the screen contents as LA50 printer codes; you can also save and load screen images with <tt>sscreen</tt> and <tt>lscreen</tt> respectively in a format I haven't currently deciphered yet. These tools are part of the graphics package and also exist in Venix/86.

Rather than a lot of random screenshots, and to show that this really was intended to make your Pro into a multi-user machine people could remotely log into and use, we're going to hook up a terminal (the Raptor POWER9) to it so that you can see a text transcript. This release of Venix has a proper <tt>/etc/inittab</tt> instead of having to muck around with <tt>/etc/ttys</tt>, though you'll note that the serial port is called <tt>com1</tt> as a PC holdover (how bourgeois). <tt>/dev/lp</tt> is the serial printer port, but Venix limits this to 4800bps, so we'll stick with the faster serial port for logins.
<p>
We'll put <tt>/etc/getty</tt> on <tt>com1</tt> at the highest speed available, 9600bps, and then bounce <tt>init</tt>'s runlevel with <tt>telinit</tt>. When we do, we get a login prompt. There is no banner. (By default, the <tt>root</tt> password is <tt>gnomes</tt>.)

   NOTE:  See the printed PRO/VENIX V2.0 Release Notes which are included in
	  the documentation set	for additional information.

   Do not pass a function the address of a static function if you are using code
   mapping, because the	loader cannot guarantee	that such functions will be
   properly mapped.  For example, do NOT pass signal(2)	the address of a static
   function to handle the signal.  If such usage is necessary, change the static
   function to be a global one and rename it as	necessary to avoid conflicts.

I don't have the V2.0 release notes, but I bet they were interesting. There are in fact <em>no</em> <tt>man</tt> pages in PRO/VENIX because you (are supposed to) have <em>real</em> manuals. Along the way I think we went backwards on this, somewhere. On the other hand, <tt>news(1)</tt> is not in my older copy of the User Reference Manual and appears to have been newly added to V2.0 also.
<p>
A more immediate problem: my terminal setting is pretty messed up because it assumed I was logging in from some other Pro connected via the serial port, so
<p>
<div class="tx"><pre>
$ TERM=vt100
$ export TERM
</pre></div>
<p>
(you can't <tt>export TERM=vt100</tt>). And, well, I'm using the Bourne shell and I hate the Bourne shell, so I set it to C-shell like civilized people. Let's get our bearings.

<p>
There's your proof that this is System V. Also, because our clock battery failed decades ago, the machine is still getting its time from the filesystem. This is useful to us because that tells us when the computer was last likely in use, as we can reasonably assume a regular user would have either gotten the battery replaced or at least set the time correctly. I should also add for the remainder of this session that it is likely this local installation of Venix had some minor removals or modifications.
<p>
Before we explore further, I'm going to customize my environment a little and make it set my terminal correctly when I'm logged in over the serial port. The current Venix license it came with (something to hack later) only allows two users, so a simplistic method will suffice. If we have a functional <tt>awk</tt>, and we should, then we can do this easily in <tt>.login</tt>.

Here we're investigating four different executables and a couple of included libraries (although program text can be shared, there are no shared objects in PRO/VENIX <i>per se</i>). The short program we compiled is an unstripped executable, but most of the essential system binaries like <tt>/bin/date</tt> are marked pure so that they can be shared by other logged in users. However, because <tt>awk</tt> and the <tt>/venix</tt> kernel are so large, they are compiled with split I+D ("separate I&amp;D"), which is more efficient and has fewer restrictions than using code mapping. You can see that when we ask about the object file sizes:
<p>
<div class="tx"><pre>
% size hello
2348+244+1224 = 3816b = 07350b
% size /bin/date
8320+1008+1352 = 10680b = 024670b
% size /usr/bin/awk
31488+21062+11646 = 64196b = 0175304b
% size /venix
52672+47552+0 = 100224b = 0303600b
</pre></div>
<p>
Our unstripped compiled binary has a code size of 2348 bytes, a data size of 244 bytes and a BSS (uninitialized data) size of 1224 bytes. This is actually smaller than <tt>date</tt>, a "pure" executable, which has code, data and BSS sizes all larger at 8320, 1008 and 1352 bytes respectively, showing that the "purity" of an executable has no relationship to its image in memory. On the other hand, our split I+D binaries (<tt>awk</tt> and the kernel) have comparatively large code sizes. Even though the kernel has no BSS portion, there is no way its code and data could simultaneously live in the same 64K space (for that matter, neither could <tt>awk</tt>'s, because the stack is a fixed 8K at the top of the address range). However, since both were compiled split I+D, they don't have to.
<p>
As a point of comparison, here's what you'd see in PRO/VENIX <em>Rev</em> 2.0.

For some reason <tt>/bin/date</tt> in the earlier version is <em>not</em> pure (though for what it's worth <tt>/bin/ls</tt> is, so it's not like it lacks pure executables altogether). <tt>awk</tt> is in a different place, but it is, as expected, a mapped (meaning code-mapped) executable owing to its size. Unexpectedly, one of the archives is also marked as an executable, though it doesn't have execute bits and you can't actually run it. But the biggest surprise is that the kernel itself is <em>not</em> mapped, which is explained when we look at the sizes:

<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEial6iwoMaTRdNgJNy9dxoA6Q8r_vS8Vwk_tDz8zQKMfGnIUDBIZWj6-fk6_ieixw8fd5HVlUGfnouovTc9LCA4X_Dk0UZ931lofBxmUT4wDddHuRPhxoXse-CiIVE7fGRVf_wkF6RmMEGo_if2Gek_g3_nyIkPFCJ_GetqF1iQMUrV9UlWCXNmp0whP4I/s2104/Screenshot%202025-03-14%20at%2012.40.07%E2%80%AFPM.png" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; "><img alt="" border="0" width="320" data-original-height="1060" data-original-width="2104" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEial6iwoMaTRdNgJNy9dxoA6Q8r_vS8Vwk_tDz8zQKMfGnIUDBIZWj6-fk6_ieixw8fd5HVlUGfnouovTc9LCA4X_Dk0UZ931lofBxmUT4wDddHuRPhxoXse-CiIVE7fGRVf_wkF6RmMEGo_if2Gek_g3_nyIkPFCJ_GetqF1iQMUrV9UlWCXNmp0whP4I/s320/Screenshot%202025-03-14%20at%2012.40.07%E2%80%AFPM.png"/></a></div>

It's also worth pointing out that <tt>/bin/ls</tt>, a pure executable, has a size of 7616+842+3852 &mdash; all bigger than <tt>/bin/date</tt>, which isn't &mdash; and again more proof that "purity" says nothing about program size.
<p>
A couple other things:
<p>
<div class="tx"><pre>
% strings /venix
strings: Command not found.
% df 
/usr      (/dev/w0.usr ):    46892 blocks   14010 i-nodes

</pre></div>
<p>
This is (well, was) an RD52, so it's a 30MB drive, the second biggest ever sold for the Pro. However, if you add these numbers up, you only get around 24MB; the rest is in fact a hidden swap partition. 6MB might seem a little excessive when the original memory size of this machine was 512K, but in Venix the swap isn't just for moving processes out so others can run &mdash; it's also used as a precache for certain pure executables that have the sticky bit set such as <tt>ls</tt>. (Again, not an uncommon feature in other operating systems of this era. AMOS could preload certain executables into the system image and always run them from RAM, for example.) These executables are copied to the swap on first use after bootup and executed henceforth from there in specific, precomputed locations, avoiding a walk through the filesystem. This also means, however, that once copied such executables cannot be deleted while the system is up or, in the words of the manual, "the file system will become slightly corrupted." (Eeeek.) Note that no version of PRO/VENIX supported demand paging; that wasn't implemented in AT&amp;T Unix until SVR2.4.
<p>
There is no <tt>/home</tt> or other special mountpoint or partition for home directories; everything else is in <tt>/usr</tt>, as was typical for Unix of this vintage.
<p>
I later copied the files out with <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/pdp11.html">Kermit</a> (it had Kermit on the hard disk) and decided to see what the Fedora Linux POWER9 would make of them.

The strings aren't too-too interesting, but it <em>is</em> notable that in 2025 my Linux box still recognizes what type of executables these are.

Whoever had the system last didn't really clean up much; the <tt>tmac.*</tt> files in particular are macro definitions that look like they were supposed to be put somewhere else. Here's <tt>root</tt>'s <tt>.profile</tt>, by the way:
<p>
<div class="tx"><pre>

# cat /.profile

# @(#).profile	1.5
# "root" login .profile

set `who -r`
if [ $7 = "S" ]
then

Choose run level s to return to Maintenance mode."' 0

	echo "You are now in Maintenance (\"single-user\") mode."
	echo "The system may now be safely halted."
	echo "Type \"telinit 2\" to enter Normal mode."
	sync

fi
if [ ! -s /etc/mnttab ]
then
	echo "*** Warning: /usr and /tmp are not mounted. ***"
fi
echo "\nBeware - you are a super-user!"

# ^D
</pre></div>
<p>
<tt>.profile</tt> must live in <tt>/</tt> because, during maintenance (single-user) mode, <tt>/usr</tt> and <tt>/tmp</tt> aren't even mounted. Once in single-user mode, the system can be powered off.
<p>
<tt>/f0</tt> and <tt>/f1</tt> are mount points for the two RX50 floppies. But, in case you thought Venix could get around the RX50 formatting restriction, guess again: "On PRO/VENIX, floppy formatting is not possible; <tt>format</tt> is useful only for creating file systems on factory-formatted diskettes." Damn you, Kenneth Olsen. Better go buy that Rainbow.

Venix only supported the highest-resolution mode, so the number of colours is limited, but it's really nice sharp graphics for 1982 nonetheless. Like I said, there is much untapped potential in the Pro's video hardware, and thus more to come in future articles.

The name "Tom Caughey" (minus the epenthetic "t") is most likely Thomas K. Caughey, Ph.D., who at the time this machine was in use was a professor of applied mechanics at Caltech. Born in Scotland, he obtained his BS from the University of Glasgow, later moved to the United States as a Fulbright scholar, and completed his Ph.D. at Caltech in 1954. He remained at the University thereafter as a professor until shortly before his death in 2004 at the age of 77. The file has a modification date of June 11, 1989 consistent with his presence there. He was distinguished in his field, winning the American Society of Civil Engineers' Norman Award in 1999, its highest such award, and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics' Theodore von K&aacute;rm&aacute;n Prize in 2002. The American Society of Mechanical Engineers' Thomas K. Caughey Dynamics Award was posthumously established in his honour in 2008 "in recognition of an individual who has made significant contributions to the field of nonlinear dynamics through practice, research, teaching, and/or outstanding leadership." An extensive interview with him in 1987 is available from the <a href="https://oralhistories.library.caltech.edu/142/1/OH_Caughey.pdf">Caltech archives</a> (PDF).
<p>
Unfortunately no other names appear on the disk, and there are no other files on the system that appear related to his research, or anyone else's. There are also no mail files to read, and while this version of Venix supports UUCP, it doesn't look like it was ever used.

UUCP (Unix-to-Unix Copy) was the only networking option supported by Venix of this vintage; no PRO/VENIX or Venix-11 version supported TCP/IP or any other means of networking, serial line or otherwise. Only P/OS officially supported the CTI Ethernet card.
<p>
A subset of the Unix games package is in Venix. The manual says, "If you find that the <i>User Reference Manual</i> is rather prosaic reading, see section 6 for <tt>games</tt>." Strangely, this section of the manual is actually in the <i>Programmer Reference Manual</i>, and I don't like what this is implying. PRO/VENIX Rev 2.0's set is abbreviated compared to <a href="https://gunkies.org/wiki/Unix_Seventh_Edition">V7 Unix</a>'s complement, possibly for space reasons.

Even fewer appear in PRO/VENIX V2.0. These seem to be all it was shipped with as the directory is unmodified.

<p>
This is a different Kermit build than the executable for Rev 2.0, which is a Venix-specific one rather than a generic System III or System V target. It is the easiest way to interchange files with Venix; I used Kermit as the terminal program on the Linux side and on the Venix side used <tt>kermit -is</tt> to push files, or <tt>kermit -ir</tt> to receive them. On the Linux side, transfers should always be in binary mode. A bit of garbage follows the transfer but the files always checked out.

<p>
These are a couple sundry short help files (remember, no <tt>man</tt> pages). <tt>more.help</tt> just explains how <tt>more</tt> works. <tt>basic.help</tt> is for the built-in copy of UBC (University of British Columbia) BASIC, which is a "an ANSI compatible BASIC interpreter that runs under VENIX." It is a standard part of the operating system and can either run separately written programs or act as a simple REPL like other BASICs of the time. There is no graphics support, but it does have floating point. The interpreter is started with the <tt>basic</tt> command:
<p>
<div class="tx"><pre>
% more /usr/help/basic.help
Help information for UBC Basic:

!	cmd	issue system command "cmd" (e.g. !who)
auto	L1,L2	provide line numbers starting at L1, increment of L2
bye		exit from basic
catalog		list files in user's catalog (directory)
clear		clear stack + clear vars
clear	stack	clear execution stack
clear	vars	clear variable symbol table
del	L1,L2	delete lines between L1 and L2
dump		print out current variable names
edit		use system editor on program
help		print out help file
list	L1,L2	list program between lines L1 and L2
load    file	load the program from "file"
merge	file	merge "file" with existing program
old	file	load the program from "file"
renumber L1,L2	renumber program starting at L1 with increment L2
run	L1	start program running (at L1)
save	file	save the current program in "file"
scr		scratch the program, variables etc.
timeoff		turn off run command timing
% basic
&gt;bye
</pre></div>
<p>
<tt>bye</tt> returns to the shell. Interestingly, instead of <tt>new</tt>, UBC BASIC uses <tt>scr</tt> to reset the program and variable area.

I'm not going to go through all of these, and I don't have manual entries for all of them either, but it is a substantial complement and appears to have all of the base tools in System V R2.0 plus the Venix value-adds from 4BSD and a handful of Venix-specific utilities. The <tt>ps</tt> utility in particular is more of a system status utility, printing not only processes and their flags but also swap and memory status. This system additionally has Ted Green's <tt>vedit</tt> (probably a port of the C-language version developed for Xenix) and what look like cross-assemblers. You can also see the tools that were used to draw the graphs I showed you.
<p>
Here are the libraries. Remember, they aren't shared, although the programs that use them might be.

Finally, the pieces of the kernel. This isn't in PRO/VENIX Rev 2.0 either, but Venix/86 2.1 does have the ability to rebuild its older V7 kernel (there are no PDP-11 targets, however).

The 380 target passes <tt>-i</tt> to the linker to enable split I+D spaces. Since the 350 doesn't support that, its target passes <tt>-m</tt> instead to generate a (slower) code-mapped kernel. This won't run as well as Rev 2.0's, but because the kernel is now much larger, it's the only way to boot V2.0 on the 350 at all. The 350 overlay disks replace all split I+D programs, including the kernel, with code-mapped versions. (See these <a href="https://www.tuhs.org/Archive/Distributions/DEC/Venix/ProVenix_2.0/">"reconstructed" PRO/VENIX V2.0 disk images</a>.) It is also worth noting that there is no target for Venix-11 anymore (on real PDP-11 hardware), which seems to have become unsupported by VenturCom after the Pro port. Although the 80286 port comes in both real ("compatibility") and protected mode variations, the kernels otherwise have the same features, though of course you can't actually build a PC kernel on the Pro because there are no binaries and no x86 linker.
<p>
Also, as written, no target will actually build anything because by default there is no <tt>/usr/bin/date</tt>, and there's also a <tt>CHECK = -@[ -f uts.c ] || exit 0 &amp;&amp;</tt> in the <tt>Makefile</tt> &mdash; since <tt>uts.c</tt> is not present, the build will fail when this check is run as well. <tt>uts.c</tt> can be reconstructed and <a href="https://forum.vcfed.org/index.php?threads/finally-a-colour-head-for-my-dec-pro-380.66139/page-2#post-1254690">a very small one</a> will suffice. However, given the absence of anything to write drivers for or a kernel ABI to write them to, or for that matter any source code, building a new kernel right now is mostly an academic exercise.

A simple shutdown script takes the system down by putting it into single-user mode (the <tt>MAINT&gt;</tt> prompt comes from the <tt>.profile</tt> I showed you earlier). At this point you can just turn off the machine.

Let's finish our twin stories, starting with Venix. PRO/VENIX doesn't seem to have sold much given that not many Pros got sold to begin with. This worsened after DEC started to emphasize the Pro's "PDP-11 compatibility," such as it was, since most of these later customers had prior experience with DEC and ran it under P/OS so that they got RSX-11M, or with the RT-11 or COS ports instead. (There was even an unofficial 2.9BSD port to the Pros, included as an example disk image with Xhomer, though none of DEC's own Unices like Ultrix ever made it.) By then VenturCom was making most of their money from the x86 versions instead, so cutting the other ports out was no great loss. VenturCom continued aligning Venix releases with System V release numbers for the rest of Venix's commercial existence; Venix's last SVR2 was V2.4 for the 80286 and 80386 in 1988.

The next major jump was V3.2 in 1989. As small PC Unices started becoming commodity software items, Venix began more aggressively touting its real-time capability as "Venix 386 Real-Time Unix." V3.2 also explicitly advertised NFS (using its recently added support for TCP/IP), X Window System, a "DOS under Unix" mode and compatibility with Xenix, incorporating 386/IX from their former competitor Interactive Systems Corporation who was then owned by Eastman Kodak (prior to Sun buying ISC out). Along with support with fixed scheduling priorities, physical memory and fast timers, it included drivers for AD/DA converters, IEEE-488 interfaces, stepper motor controls and digital I/O. A special Japanese localized version was sold in 1991 intended for industrial process control and the E-Venix variant was a smaller embeddable version with basic networking.
<p>
Although Bill Gates had been their biggest nemesis early on, most of the little Unices that flourished in the 1980s and early 90s met their collective demise at the hands of another man: Linus Torvalds. The proliferation of free Unix alternatives like Linux on commodity PC hardware caused the bottom to fall out of the commercial Unix market, leaving proprietary Unix's last bastion on legacy "big RISC" systems like IBM POWER (AIX) and Sun SPARC (Solaris) &mdash; a situation not unlike what the mini vendors faced back in the late 1970s. VenturCom ceased development of Venix after V4.2.1 in 1993 and shifted to the Windows NT market in 1995, developing an embedded real-time version of NT called RTX under license. Some of this work, including VenturCom's development tools and likely some low-level ported pieces of Venix, became part of the official Windows NT Embedded kernel in 1999. The company later became better known for their UDP netboot infrastructure allowing any x86 PC to be brought up or re-provisioned completely over the network. Changing their name to Ardence in 2004, they were bought out by Citrix in 2006, though former Ardence executives acquired the real-time stack and spun it out into new company IntervalZero in 2008. RTX and RTX64 are still sold today <a href="https://www.intervalzero.com/">as MaxRT</a>.
<p>
Meanwhile, the new DEC personal computer strategy did about as badly as the prior one, though mostly due to the Rainbow which by now was seen by the market as so thoroughly idiosyncratic and incompatible that sales had no chance of rebounding. DEC completed a port of Windows 1.0 to the Rainbow but it made little change to its perception. In 1986 Digital introduced the VAXmate, ostensibly side-by-side with the Rainbow, but secretly intended as its replacement. The VAXmate was a true AT-class all-in-one clone PC, not based on the VAX architecture, but was notable that it could netboot over Ethernet from a VAX/VMS server as well as run regular MS-DOS from a conventional hard disk. Instead of incompatible RX50 floppy drives it had the lower-capacity but PC-interchangeable 1.2MB 5.25" RX33, and did not need nor use Rainbow peripherals. The new 380 did have some takers, but that was a relative statement especially since the PDP-11 market was fading generally and other business units at DEC wanted to promote VAX systems.
<p>
DEC ultimately cancelled both the Professional and Rainbow families in 1987, replacing the 380-based VAX Console with a MicroVAX II for the second-generation VAX 8800s. Of the original 1982 rollout only the DECmate series survived, sold as the DECmate III+ until 1990 when it was no longer seen as competitive with PC word processing options. DEC nevertheless kept trying to sell their proprietary architectures as microcomputers, particularly in the form of the later VAXstations which primarily ran VMS as workstations and were generally compatible with bigger VAXen yet ultimately suffered a similar fate to the Pros. Digital did sell their own lines of PC clone desktops and laptops, and the Alpha had some modest initial success as <a href="/2023/03/refurb-weekend-dec-alphapc-164lx.html">a high-end PC competitor</a> under emulation, but on the whole there were a lot fewer DEC computers in the home than there should have been. DEC was bought out by Compaq in 1998, and Compaq itself was acquired by Hewlett-Packard in 2002.
<p>
This isn't the last you'll see of this machine. I'd like to explore writing some userspace networking options, and like I say, there's a lot of untapped potential in that graphics hardware. Stay tuned for <a href="/search/label/decpro">future articles</a>.
