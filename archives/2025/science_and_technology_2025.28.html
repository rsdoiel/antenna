id="blender-5.0-to-introduce-hdr-support-for-wayland-on-linux-but-not-for-windows">Blender
5.0 to introduce HDR support for Wayland on Linux, but not for
Windows</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>The latest alpha of the upcoming Blender 5.0 release comes with High
Dynamic Range (HDR) support for Linux on Wayland which will, if
everything works out, make it into the final Blender 5.0 release on
October 1, 2025. The post on the developer forum comes with instructions
on how to enable the experimental support and how to test it. If you are
using Fedora Workstation 42, which ships GNOME version 48, everything is
already included to run Blender with HDR. All that is required is an HDR
compatible display and graphics driver, and turning on HDR in the
Display Settings. ↫ Sebastian Wick It’s interesting to note that Blender
on Windows won’t be getting HDR support, and that’s because Windows’ HDR
support is subpar compared to Wayland on Linux, and requires a ton more
work which the Blender team isn’t going to do. It seems the Wayland
developers made all the right choices when it comes to HDR support.
Needless to say, X11 doesn’t have HDR support. The design of the Wayland
color-management protocol, and the resulting active color-management
paradigm of Wayland compositors was a good choice, making it easy for
developers to do the right thing, while also giving them more control if
they so chose. ↫ Sebastian Wick Weird. I was told Wayland was an
unusable mess.</p>

<p>date: 2025-07-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>On Windows, there’s an option to show the seconds on the taskbar
clock, but it comes with a warning that it might reduce battery life if
you switch it on. LTT Labs decided to look into this to see just how
much of a thing this really is, and they concluded that yes, it does
actually affect battery life. They saw a drop of about 5%-15%, depending
on configuration. In percentage terms, the drops weren’t massive. For
most people, it probably won’t make or break your day. But if you’re on
a long flight, running low on battery, or trying to squeeze out every
last bit of endurance, it’s not entirely nothing either. ↫ Woolly Door
at LTT Labs I mean, having the second tick away on the click would drive
me up the wall when I’m trying to use my computer, but I’m sure quite a
few among you do enable the seconds display on your own setups (Windows
or otherwise). I’m curious to see if the same battery life reduction is
measurable on KDE, GNOME, or macOS.</p>

image results from refined calibration of data gathered by New Horizons’

tool to stop “AI” crawler abuse, gains non-JavaScript option</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>In recent weeks and months, you may have noticed that when accessing
some websites, you see a little progress bar and a character, performing
some sort of check. You’ve most likely encountered Anubis, a tool to
distinguish real human browser users from “AI” content crawlers that are
causing real damage and harm. It turns out Anubis is quite effective at
what it does, but it did come with a limitation: it required JavaScript
to be enabled. Well, no more. One of the first issues in Anubis before
it was moved to the TecharoHQ org was a request to support challenging
browsers without using JavaScript. This is a pretty challenging thing to
do without rethinking how Anubis works from a fundamentally low level,
and with v1.20.0, Anubis finally has support for running without
client-side JavaScript thanks to the Meta Refresh challenge. ↫ Xe Iaso
Before this new non-JS challenge, users who disabled client-side
JavaScript or browsers which don’t support JavaScript were straight-up
blocked from passing Anubis’ test, meaning they couldn’t access the
website Anubis was protecting from “AI” scraper abuse. This is now no
longer the case.</p>

normally read through the guides (maybe even poke around the
