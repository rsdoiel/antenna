id="anubis-tool-to-stop-ai-crawler-abuse-gains-non-javascript-option">Anubis,
tool to stop “AI” crawler abuse, gains non-JavaScript option</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>In recent weeks and months, you may have noticed that when accessing
some websites, you see a little progress bar and a character, performing
some sort of check. You’ve most likely encountered Anubis, a tool to
distinguish real human browser users from “AI” content crawlers that are
causing real damage and harm. It turns out Anubis is quite effective at
what it does, but it did come with a limitation: it required JavaScript
to be enabled. Well, no more. One of the first issues in Anubis before
it was moved to the TecharoHQ org was a request to support challenging
browsers without using JavaScript. This is a pretty challenging thing to
do without rethinking how Anubis works from a fundamentally low level,
and with v1.20.0, Anubis finally has support for running without
client-side JavaScript thanks to the Meta Refresh challenge. ↫ Xe Iaso
Before this new non-JS challenge, users who disabled client-side
JavaScript or browsers which don’t support JavaScript were straight-up
blocked from passing Anubis’ test, meaning they couldn’t access the
website Anubis was protecting from “AI” scraper abuse. This is now no
longer the case.</p>

with OpenBSD</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>I’m hardly a “networking” or system admin expert. Even still, I’ve
always been interested in the concept of building out my own home router
with OpenBSD. It seemed so “hacky” and cool! The problem is that most of
the tutorials I stumble across on the internet seem so daunting. I
normally read through the guides (maybe even poke around the
core man docs for a bit as well) but always end up returning to my
default ISP setup. But that all changes today! Best of all, you can come
along for the ride! ↫ Bradley Taunt Exactly what it says on the tin.</p>
