## All the best EV and PHEV rebate deals we could find for April 2025 [update]

date: 2025-04-28, from: Electrek Feed

<p>So if you’re dealing with any of the above, <a href="https://electrek.co/guides/tariffs/">but still hope to slide behind the wheel of a new EV before new tariffs kick in</a>, pay attention: these EVs could get you behind the wheel of a new electric ride sooner than you think!</p>
