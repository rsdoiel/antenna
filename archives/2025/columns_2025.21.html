<h2 id="why-take9-wont-improve-cybersecurity">Why Take9 Won’t Improve
Cybersecurity</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-30, updated: 2025-05-29, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
There’s a new cybersecurity awareness campaign: Take9. The idea is that
people—you, me, everyone—should just pause for nine seconds and think
more about the link they are planning to click on, the file they are
planning to download, or whatever it is they are planning to share.
</p>
<p>
There’s a <a href="https://pausetake9.org/">website</a>—of course—and a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlmplblxsGM">video</a>,
well-produced and scary. But the campaign won’t do much to improve
cybersecurity. The advice isn’t reasonable, it won’t make either
individuals or nations appreciably safer, and it deflects blame from the
real causes of our cyberspace insecurities…

<h2 id="the-fifth-estate">The Fifth Estate</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-30, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
<a href="https://amzn.to/42NSD5n">Careless People</a> is a tell-all book
that walks through Facebook’s rampant (and criminally?) inept responses
to it’s growing role in global policy, from
<a href="https://erinkissane.com/meta-in-myanmar-part-i-the-setup">it’s
role in the Rohingya genocide in Myanmar</a> to the election of Donald
J. Trump. The book, written by Facebook’s former director of foreign
policy Sarah Wynn-Williams, explains that Zuckerberg initially denied
the notion that Facebook could ever impact an election but over time
starts to see Facebook and social media as a powerful “Digital Fifth
Estate”.
</p>
<p>
The three-estate system used to refer to the Clergy, the Nobles, and the
Commoners. In modern times, the three-estate system describes the
legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government. Then
there’s the newly minted (<em>ahem</em>, circa
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Estate">1840</a>) Fourth
Estate comprised of good ol’ fashioned journalism and newspapers. The
Fourth Estate applies pressure on the other estates through shining a
spotlight on important or unaddressed issues. Another form of checks and
balances. I would lump academia into the Fourth Estate as well. And so
does Wikipedia. So. I’m right because an online wiki said so.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of online wikis, what does a “Digital Fifth Estate” look like?
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_Estate">Fifth Estate</a>,
while not recognized in the same way as the first four, includes
bloggers, social media influencers, and other online platforms that can
influence public discourse and politics independently of traditional
media.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I’ve read about the influence of the “man-o-sphere” and MSNBC is tying
itself in knots trying to find “the Joe Rogan of the Left” and I can’t
help but roll my eyes. No doubt the Left needs to consider issues facing
men more, but the Zune had better luck with a product clone. With the
framing of the Fifth Estate though, I understand the desire better.
<a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/651977/americans-trust-media-remains-trend-low.aspx">Most
people have lost trust in the Fourth Estate</a> and the Fifth Estate
explains to me why podcasters, YouTube influencers, and newsletter
goblins have so much political sway these days (certainly during the
last election) and why news organizations and academic scientists don’t
anymore.
</p>
<p>
Estates are for sale. Billionaires also own major portions of the First,
Second, and Third Estates through gifts, bribes, and threat of
primaries. Billionaires like the Murdochs and Bezos (RIP <em>The
Washington Post</em>) and media conglomerates own major portions of the
Fourth Estate. “Mainstream media” has become an effective slur, even
when there’s no true meaning behind it. And in places where the Fourth
Estate isn’t for sale, you slap them with a lawsuit.
</p>
<p>
We commoners have lost trust in the Estates, like we lost trust in the
Clergy and Nobles in the before times. The Fifth Estate is why “flood
the zone with shit” is an effective tactic. We’re not making informed
decisions based on answers from educated individuals. We’re making
decisions based on vibes and standup comics who host pay-per-view fight
clubs. We’re eating Tide Pods to get the toxins out. We’re getting our
news from a guy in a car with a backwards hat and sunglasses. We ask
fancy autocomplete for answers to our personal problems, to do our work,
to write our eulogies.
</p>
<p>
This shift isn’t lost on the wealthy, billionaires like Musk and
Zuckerberg own major portions of the Fifth Estate. They also own the AI.
They create bots to keep us engaged on their apps. Why? Because our
attention powers their products. They’ve captured and commoditized our
attention to auction our eyeballs to advertisers. The flip-side of this
system forced on us is that we know our attention has value. If you want
two good books on the intersection of attention and billionaires, I
recommend Chris Hayes’ book <a href="https://amzn.to/3YEqwTD">The
Sirens’ Call</a> followed up by his other book
<a href="https://amzn.to/4jCvpon">Twilight of the Elites</a>.
</p>
<p>
The concept of a digital Fifth Estate is profound to me because it
appears effective and it’s the one where I have the most choice. My
singular vote pales in comparison to the influence of a well-funded
Super PAC. I don’t get to choose who owns my local newspaper or the
board of the university. I don’t have a legal team to undo Citizens
United. But I do get to choose where I give my time and attention.
</p>
<p>
Where I find hope, if the Fifth Estate is powerful enough to hoodwink
our fellow citizens into authoritarianism, then we –you and me– can
seize power from the already powerful. We can give power –our attention–
to the trustworthy. We can eradicate the “rich ergo good” fallacy. And
the cost of “going indie” in the Fifth Estate is lower than it has ever
been right now with a sizable exodus to Mastodon and Bluesky. Sure, all
your favorite nazis and Russian botnets might be harder to find on the
alternatives, but think about it as an investment in a world that isn’t
owned by wealthy people already.
</p>
<p>
I don’t have the capital to start my own Fourth Estate university or
newspaper. But I do have this blog. A minor stake in the Fifth Estate.
But my blog plus your blog, mix in some RSS and the power of sharing
interesting blogs and podcasts… we might make a dent.

2025-05-30 Fighting against the news
</h1>
<p>
The news is dragging me down. Israel and the genocide in Palestine; the
invasion of Russia into Ukraine; the government in Germany; the
government in the USA … ugh!
</p>
<p>
The world is so terrible that I’m lacking words now that I’m back from
the holidays and have more time to read it. Somehow I also feel that
it’s not OK to just post about random stuff at a place where I see too
much stuff that’s upsetting me. I can’t counteract the terror of reading
about the state of the world by posting about the flowers I see when I
go for a walk. Instead, I’d better go for another walk, I think.
</p>

me that there is an important part about going for walks and maybe
taking pictures of flowers, though: to bring back joy. So I brought back
some pictures. And then I spent some time with music instruments, making
a drum pattern, adding some stuff. It’s not great but it drove away the
sadness.
</p>
<p>
So here’s to life. 😄

Maybe next time I should take pictures of my surroundings, too.

<p>
We drove all the way to Split, visited the old town and what remains of
Diocletians palace, had lunch and then we went walking through Marjan
forest park. Wonderfully quiet.
</p>
<p>
On the way to the city center, I spotted a passion flower. So beautiful.
They look like cosmic spaceships or psychedelic temples in miniature.

perimeter of Diocletian’s palace.

The water is dirty and smells bad.

We went into the cathedral. It’s a small octagonal building because it
used to be Diocletions tomb. I was not impressed.

We had enough after a while, had a small lunch and decided to head into
the Marjan forest park. The stairs up start in the old town.

2025-05-21 The audio stack
</h1>
<p>
Whenever I think about audio on my Debian-based laptops, I feel like I’m
just too old for this. I just don’t get it anymore. Then I read a blog
post like this one and I shake my head because I guess I’m not too old –
the situation truly is miserable!
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Now the audio stack kicks in. Is it PipeWire? PulseAudio? Is ALSA
enabled? Is the correct fallback sink selected? Is the audio device
owned by root? Is the socket exposed to your session? Who knows. –
<a href="https://fireborn.mataroa.blog/blog/i-want-to-love-linux-it-doesnt-love-me-back-post-1-built-for-control-but-not-for-people/">I

But Not for People</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Accessibility matters. The problems blind users encounter are the
problems that sighted people like me will encounter later in life. And
when the complaints are about complexity, brittleness, lack of testing
and lack of backwards compatibility, you know that eventually you’ll get
hit.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A stack implies layers. Order. A single interface at each point. This is
not a stack. This is a tangled mess of everything ever built for Linux
audio still being required right now because no one can kill anything
off without breaking something else. You want to play sound? You need:
ALSA, because it’s the actual driver. PipeWire, because it’s the new
standard. Pulse emulation, because most apps still use Pulse. ALSA
plugins, because some things bypass PipeWire. JACK shims, because a few
pro audio tools never moved on. And config files for all of it—if they
even exist. This isn’t backwards compatibility.  This is a graveyard,
and we’re all just camping in it. –

Want to Love Linux. It Doesn’t Love Me Back: Post 1 – Built for Control,
But Not for People</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I wonder. Isn’t this stack the right thing to do? The new layer with an
emulation of the old layer sitting atop the kernel layer, etc? In the
long lived stacks in the commercial world, the same thing is true
(Windows API, Java API – all continue to offer compatibility layers to
deprecated things). From my perspective the main problem is that the
mess is necessary but it must also be either strictly encapsulated and
controlled or – if composable like in a typical Linux distribution –
supported by tools to inspect and control it across all layers. What we
have right now is a composable stack where we are free to install and
deinstall parts and every layer provides independent inspection and
control tools that work differently from each other. And no overview so
you don’t know which part is failing.
</p>
<p>
My audio stacks also mostly work but if the volume is wrong I always
wonder: what tool do I need to run (on the command line) to change it.
So many mixers! And on every new laptop: do I need Jack? And is PipeWire
or PulseAudio the correct one? Or both? The uncertainty is part of my
problem.

We took the ferry across the channel to Brač. This is the first time we
took a car ferry as adults.

<p>(Clearly a much better word than simplification.) I believe we
generally accept the truth that we should write simple and easy to read
code in order to make it harder to create bugs and cause security
problems. The more complicated code we write, the easier it gets to slip
up, misunderstand or forget something along …

<h2 id="alt-text-on-this-blog">2025-05-27 Alt text on this blog</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-29, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2025-05-27-alt-text-on-this-blog">
2025-05-27 Alt text on this blog
</h1>
<p>
On the web, the alt text is a description of an image to be shown by
browsers when the image cannot be shown – like text browsers or screen
readers. So what about alt text on this blog? What about blog posts full
of photos, specifically? Like the <a href="Croatia">Croatia</a> posts.
</p>
<p>
I think that alt text should be unnecessary on my blog because the text
should carry the entire message. “Welcome to my
<a href="Wall_of_Text">Wall of Text</a>!” 😄
</p>
<p>
On fedi, I like alt text and I both read and write it. I hate clients
that don’t display it. I want to always read it. Therefore, on my blog,
the equivalent of alt text should always be readable. But real alt text
isn’t shown to me – the browser is showing me the pictures, instead. It
makes sense. And on fedi it only works because the applications and
front-ends don’t just use the alt text attribute for images in HTML –
they have an extra user-interface to allow me to read it. Buttons,
mouse-over, long-press, whatever it takes.
</p>
<p>
There are options for this blog, of course. Except I don’t like these
options.
</p>
<p>
I could reuse the alt text as the image title attribute which is shown
on mouse-over by default. I don’t like being forced to use mouse and I
don’t like duplicating the description.
</p>
<p>
In Markdown:
</p>
<pre><code>![alt text](url &quot;title&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>
I could automatically use the alt text as the title attribute but I
still don’t like to use the mouse to read the title attribute and I
wouldn’t be able to switch Markdown rendering engines as easily if I
hack it. Writing some Javascript to produce extra pop-ups or some other
user-interface element would be even worse, and it would need extra
clicking or keyboard navigation as a reader. No way.
</p>
<p>
The last option is the best. Just write the description above the image:
</p>
<pre><code>Description

![](url)
</code></pre>
<p>
I’ve tried using the title attribute for some of my recent picture-heavy
blog posts about Croatia and I’ve been checking the result using Gemini
and Gopher, and I’m not happy.
</p>
<p>
Compare the following two with the
<a href="https://alexschroeder.ch/view/2025-05-17-%C5%A1ibenik">web</a>
version where I can’t read the alt text. (Screenshots from
<a href="https://gmi.skyjake.fi/lagrange/">Lagrange</a> on my phone.)
</p>
<p>
The <a href="gemini://alexschroeder.ch/2025-05-17-šibenik">Gemini</a>
version looks OK with some text paragraphs being links to the images.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-1.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
The <a href="gopher://alexschroeder.ch/02025-05-17-šibenik">Gopher</a>
version shows the alt texts as weird disjointed text paragraphs that
sometimes repeat the preceding paragraph and sometimes don’t.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-2.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
I guess I could write longer alt texts until the Gopher version looks
good but then the Gemini version looks weird and the web version
continues to not show it.
</p>
<p>
Now check the Gemini and Gopher output for the page you’re reading right
now!
</p>
<p>
The <a href="gopher://alexschroeder.ch/02025-05-27-alt-text">Gopher</a>
version is OK. The line-breaks don’t look nice on the phone at the
default resolution so ignore that weird line-break. What we can see is
that the empty alt text generated an empty paragraph. Something I should
fix. 😅 But in general, it looks OK and reads well.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-3.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
The <a href="gemini://alexschroeder.ch/2025-05-27-alt-text">Gemini</a>
version still looks OK. It also links to the Gopher and Gemini versions,
so ignore those extra links. 😅 The browser substitutes the filenames
for the missing alt text. That works for me. I’m not sure what a screen
reader would do. Probably say: “Image. 2025-05-27-alt-text-3.jpg”? And
I’m not sure what a person with bad sight would prefer. At this point
I’d know that I can skip the image since I have already read the
description above.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-4.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
And here’s the same passage a day later, using the text browser
<code>lynx</code>. The inline links look good, and there’s no trace of
the screenshots. This is great! It’s as readable as the Gopher version
with no extra line-breaks, and the inline links are inline (unlike in
the Gemini version).
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-5.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Checking with <code>edbrowse</code>. The inline links are wrapped in
bracers, which looks good, and the images with no alt text are shown as
empty square brackets (<code>[]</code>) which works for me. Ideally, I
guess, they’d just disappear.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-6.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
All in all, I think this solution is better: Instead of alt text, just
write more text above each image.
</p>
<p>
What I’m less sure about is whether this automatically implies that all
images are “decorative” and therefore should have an empty alt text
(instead of no alt text). It seems to me that the filename being shown
is a lot of visual clutter, but that only seems to affect Gemini, not
the text browser.
</p>
<p>
What do you think?

<i>I’m working on something that requires an endless stream of test
posts. Sometimes when I start writing I end up something that should be
published. Should I edit it? Nah.</i>
</p>
<p>
this shit is hard. when it’s done it looks simple. but these pieces must
fit together.
</p>
<p>
that’s why it’s soooo stupid to throw out all the interop, because it’s
going to take you forever to recreate it, if you ever can, which you
probably can’t.
</p>
<p>
this is the lesson that activitypub and atproto are teaching once again.
and the people who are dealing with this have probably known it a long
time.
</p>
<p>
it would be so much faster to use something that already works and is
widely supported.
</p>
<p>
this is why we used mp3 in rss to make podcasting. we could have said oh
shit i don’t understand how mp3 works, so let’s create one that does
only what podcasting needs. only of course it’ll turn out that
podcasting needs everything that mp3 already does.
</p>
<p>
accept a win. don’t feel compelled to reinvent everything. you’ll find
out it wasn’t as easy as it looked.

The point of Gidney and Schmieg’s post and their
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15917">paper</a> is
<a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2025/05/tracking-cost-of-quantum-factori.html">that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
2048-bit RSA encryption could theoretically be broken by a quantum
computer with 1 million noisy qubits running for one week. This is a
20-fold decrease in the number of qubits from
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09749">our previous estimate</a>,
published in 2019. Notably, quantum computers with relevant error rates
currently have on the order of only 100 to 1000 qubits
</blockquote>
They don’t provide an estimate for
<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm">Bitcoin’s
ECDSA</a> but, like RSA, the ECDSA algorithm is a derivative of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor's_algorithm">Schor’s
algorithm</a>.<br /> <br /> So there’s nothing to worry about, right?
NIST has specified the algorithms, quantum computers need to get 1000
times better before they can crack a single RSA key in a week, and NIST
says we have 5 years before there’s a problem.<br /> <br /> At least as
regards cryptocurrencies, I think this is a rather pessimistic estimate.
The point of
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2021/11/the-65b-prize.html"><i>The $65B
Prize</i></a> was that at least Bitcoin’s transition to post-quantum
cryptography faced a particular problem:<br />
<blockquote>
Senator Everett Dirksen is famously alleged to have remarked
“<a href="https://www.dirksencenter.org/research-collections/everett-m-dirksen/dirksen-record/billion-here-billion-there">a
billion here, a billion there, pretty soon you’re talking real
money</a>”. There are a set of Bitcoin wallets containing about a
million Bitcoins that are believed to have been mined by Satoshi
Nakamoto at the very start of the blockchain in 2008. They haven’t moved
since and, if you believe the
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2021/11/making-sure-number-go-up.html">bogus
Bitcoin “price”</a>, are currently “worth” $65B. Even if you’re
skeptical of the “price”, that is “real money”.
</blockquote>
I assume that the fact that Nakamoto’s stash hasn’t moved means that he
no longer has access to the keys, either through death, destruction or
accident. As I write, the stash is “worth” about $107B. I also assume
that the stash is
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2021/11/the-65b-prize.html">included in
Chainalysis’ estimate that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
about <a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/money-supply">20% of
all Bitcoins</a> have been “lost”, or in other words are sitting in
wallets whose keys are inaccessible. … These coins need to be protected
from theft by some public-sprited person with a “sufficiently large
quantum computer” who can transfer them to post-quantum wallets he owns.
</blockquote>
The point is that, without access to the keys for the vulnerable
wallets, there is no way to transfer their contents to new wallets
protected by post-quantum cryptography. Thus 20% of all Bitcoins or 4.2M
BTC, currently “worth” almost $450B, is the reward for the first to
build a “sufficiently powerful quantum computer”. It is generally
thought that VCs need to see the prospect of at least a 10x return on
their investment, so that is enough for $45B of R&amp;D.<br /> <br />

There may now be a viable runner in this race.
<a href="https://www.psiquantum.com/">Psi Quantum</a> is a Palo Alto
based startup that is building a million-qubit optical quantum computer.
They had raised
<a href="https://www.seedtable.com/startups/PsiQuantum-PBDGXRA">$1.2B by
2021</a> and
“<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/quantum-computing-startup-psiquantum-raising-least-750-million-6-billion-2025-03-24/">at
least $750M this year</a>” from investors including Nvidia. Their
website <a href="https://www.psiquantum.com/blueprint">claims</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
In 2024, PsiQuantum announced two landmark partnerships with the
Australian Federal and Queensland State governments, as well as the
State of Illinois and the City of Chicago, to build its first
utility-scale quantum computers in Brisbane and Chicago. Recognizing
quantum as a sovereign capability, these partnerships underscore the
urgency and race towards building million-qubit systems. In 2025,
PsiQuantum will break ground on Quantum Compute Centers at both sites,
where the first utility-scale, million-qubit systems will be deployed.
</blockquote>
Investors have put in about $2B so far. They stand to make a notional
225x return just from Bitcoin, apart from all the other uses of a
“utility-scale quantum computer”.<br /> <br /> But wait! There is an
even better way to monetize a “sufficiently powerful quantum computer”.
Matt Levine has been writing about
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-01-23/crypto-perpetual-motion-machines"><i>Crypto
Perpetual Motion Machines</i></a> for some time, for example:<br />
<blockquote>
MicroStrategy Inc. is, among other things, a proof of concept. The
concept is: “If you buy $100 of Bitcoin and put it in a pot, you can
slice the pot into shares and sell them for $200.” (MicroStrategy owns
about $49 billion of Bitcoin and has a market capitalization of about
$94 billion, because people will buy its shares for more than the value
of the underlying Bitcoin.) This is a very appealing concept, because:
free money! A “perpetual motion machine,” I sometimes call it: The more
shares you sell, the more Bitcoin you can buy, and the more your shares
are worth.
</blockquote>
To do this you need a public company, but as Levine
explains,<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/newsletters/2025-05-27/sell-your-crypto-on-the-stock-exchange">they
aren’t expensive</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
If you have a big pot of Bitcoin or Ethereum or Solana or Dogecoin or
Trumpcoin or anything else, you should wrap it in a US public company
and sell it to stock investors for twice its actual value. But to wrap
it in a public company, you need a public company. There are only so
many of those, and they are busy. If you called, like, Apple Inc. and
said “hey we’d like to merge our big pot of Dogecoin with you so that
our coins are worth more,” Apple would say no. The trick is to call a
company that is (1) a public company but (2) only barely. Those
companies’ phones are ringing off the hook.
</blockquote>
So the monetization strategy for the owner of the first “sufficiently
powerful quantum computer” is:<br />
<ol>
<li>
Buy a cheap public company.
</li>
<li>
Lend it enough money to pay for the quantum computer time to crack the
keys of the 20% of frozen BTC.
</li>
<li>
Transfer the 20% of BTC to post-quantum wallets.
</li>
<li>
Announce that your company now controls 20% of BTC and can prove it by
signing messages with the post-quantum keys of your wallets.
</li>
<li>
Since
<a href="https://saylortracker.com/"><strike>Micro</strike>Strategy
holds about 580K BTC</a> and MSTR is valued at 1.6 times their “price”,
by analogy your 4.2M BTC would give your company’s stock a “market cap”
of around $740B,
</li>
<li>
Now you use (Michael) Saylor’s algorithm:<br />
<blockquote>
<tt><small> float btc = 4,200,000.0; // Initial HODL-ing<br /> float
factor = 1.6; // Market Cap inflator<br /> float fraction = 1.0; // %
Market Cap to use as collateral<br /> float over = 200; // %
Over-collateralization<br /> while (factor &gt; 1.0) {<br />     float
price = btc_price();<br />     float pre_mkt_cap = btc * price *
factor;<br />     float cash = borrow((pre_mkt_cap * fraction) /
over);<br />     btc += cash / price;<br />     // Each time round
Market Cap increases by cap_gain<br />     float cap_gain = cash *
factor;<br /> }<br /> </small> </tt>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
It is really hard to think of a better way to monetize a “sufficiently
powerful quantum computer” than this way, with its at least 370x
return!<br /> <br /> You may think that the market is irrational in
valuing MSTR at 1.6 times its BTC HODL-ings. But, Levine writes,
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/newsletters/2025-05-27/sell-your-crypto-on-the-stock-exchange">that’s
small potatoes</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
SharpLink’s <i>planned</i> $425 million stash of Ethereum is worth $2.5
billion on the stock market.<br /> <br /> Note that SharpLink apparently
doesn’t own any Ether. The investors are contributing $425 million in
dollars, not Ethereum. This is not “we’ve got a stash of Ethereum and
might as well sell it on the stock exchange”; it’s “man the stock
exchange is paying $2 for $1 of Ethereum, we’d better do that arb.” Or,
in this case, $6 for every $1 of Ethereum.
</blockquote>
SharpLink is an el-cheapo public company that Consensys bought to run
Saylor’s algorithm. It is a shame that an <i>actual</i> pot of BTC isn’t
valued like a <i>planned</i> pot of ETH. If it were the post-quantum
company would be valued at around $2.8B, almost as much as APPL. Levine
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/newsletters/2025-05-27/sell-your-crypto-on-the-stock-exchange">takes
this lesson</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
This is not investment advice but honestly what am I doing with my life.
Right now, if you have a few hundred million dollars lying around, you
can buy any crypto you like with it, and the US stock market will give
you an immediate 500+% paper profit. All you need — besides the startup
cash — is a little public company to put your crypto in.
</blockquote>
And, of course, you need to remember to cash out without crashing the
stock price before someone with a “sufficiently powerful quantum
computer” steals the little public company’s stash. Helpfully, Levine
suggests a
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/newsletters/2025-05-27/sell-your-crypto-on-the-stock-exchange">way
to do it</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
In crypto, if you have magic beans that are currently priced at $1
billion, maybe someone will lend you $500 million of real money against
them, with no recourse to you. In the stock market … look you’re going
to have a hard time borrowing 50%, or 10%, of the market value of a 97%
stake in a crypto treasury company whose market cap has increased
100,000% in a week, but, man, I would try.
</blockquote>
<p>We just have to hope that the current infatuation with crypto
treasury companies lasts long enough for PsiQuantum to build the
“sufficiently powerful quantum computer”.<br /> <br /></p>

btw, that’s why I
<a href="http://scripting.com/2025/05/21.html#a135615">wanted</a> Chris
Lydon to do interviews with people in his
<a href="https://radioopensource.org/">audience</a> who are tripping out
on all the new power they’re getting from AI. How is it augmenting their
work? I know Chris well enough that he probably thinks it’s not for him,
too technical – but that’s the point – the excitement with AI is not
technical. That’s the story all the other reporters are missing. It’s
the light in the users’ eyes when they struggle to make you understand
why it’s the most incredible thing ever and they’re so glad to have
lived to see this. <i>That’s</i> the freaking story. Help them get the
ideas through. BTW, we have no idea how AI will rock our boat, we never
did for other similar inventions. Who knew what the Beatles would lead
to when they
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles%27_1964_North_American_tour">came
to America</a>. They said (the Beatles did, with ridiculous humility)
that they expected their fame will last a few years at most. PCs a few
years later were supposed to be for the kitchen. Apple actually
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/05/28/appleKitchenComputer.png">ran
ads</a> saying that in the late 70s. And the web? Well Chris was around
near the beginning of that and knows how our eyes glazed over at the
utopia we were envisioning, and we know, to some extent how all that
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump#First_presidency_(2017%E2%80%932021)">turned</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquisition_of_Twitter_by_Elon_Musk">out</a>.
The AI story is a great one, and as Chris had very little understanding
of blogs when he did the series of podcasts in 2003 and 2004 that should
win the Pulitzer Prize for being so presicent and courageous, he’s the
right guy to get this story, if he has the patience and stamina. This is
the <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/05/22/214121.html">story</a>.
Sure you <i>have</i> to cover Harvard v Trump but AI is a story of love
from the users and that story hasn’t been told yet, and it’s a big one,
like what were the Beatles for and why, in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles%27_1964_North_American_tour">1964</a>.</p>

about Anthony Edwards and how the OKC’s guard against him by
double-teaming, so he can’t have the ball, and that allows them to steal
the ball more often from other Minnesotan ball-handlers, and also limits
Edwards opportunities to shoot, but it does make it more <i>possible</i>
for others on the team to shoot. If he does his job, the pundits and
fans say he’s slumping (low points). But he’s just doing his job. Same
thing, flipped around – when they say Brunson is scoring so many points,
he’s doing great, like LeBron or Kobe, but actually it’s a sign the team
is fucked up. Too dependent on one offensive player, the others are just
standing around in case he wants to pass it to them. I exaggerate, but
it does work out that way. What you want is a team where there are
always lots of options, and to the extent that they’re hot, the team is
impossible to defend. But a Brunson holding the ball all the time makes
it easier to beat the Knicks? That was (as I’ve said a few times) the
problem with Melo. Now we’ve <i>seen</i> the non-Brunsons on the Knicks
kick ass. If the Knicks don’t make it past this round, and it is it
seems pretty likely – next season they should focus on configurations
that have to sink or swim based on whether they can win without Brunson.
Then, next year, we’ll have something, perhaps. But I’m just a fan,
seriously, no sarcasm. Same way I’m a fan of AI, I have no idea how it
works, and I’m happy with that. And don’t tell me it’s like
auto-complete, try using it for a while for real stuff, and tell me how
you know that from using it. You don’t. Each system has quirks that you
have to learn the same way you have to learn the quirks of team members,
and help them do stuff they’re good at, so they can handle the ball and
take shots without you getting involved. That’s how you start to get
teamwork. See how that works kind of like basketball? :-)</p>

<p>I asked ChatGPT to review my
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=Knicks">archive on the
Knicks</a> and to summarize my feelings about the team over the years.
This is what they said. “Your sentiments toward the New York Knicks over
the years appear to be a blend of enduring loyalty, cautious optimism,
and occasional frustration. Your writings reflect a deep-rooted
connection to the team, celebrating their victories and expressing hope
during promising times. At the same time, you don’t shy away from
critiquing management decisions or expressing disappointment during less
successful periods. This combination suggests a passionate fan who
remains committed to the Knicks, appreciating their highs and
thoughtfully analyzing their lows.”</p>

<h2 id="take-my-hand-precious-lord">Take My Hand, Precious Lord</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-27, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
<em>Take My Hand, Precious Lord</em> (also known as the inverse
<em>Precious Lord, Take My Hand</em>) is an old gospel hymn with a
unique and special tie-in to the American Civil Rights story. Written in
1932 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_A._Dorsey">Thomas
Dorsey</a> after he co-founded National Convention of Gospel Choirs and
Choruses (NCGCC), the tune borrowed from a 1844 hymn called “Maitland”
(George N. Allan) and took inspiration from a performance of the song by
Blind Connie Williams.
</p>
<p>
The song was written after the death of Dorsey’s wife Nettie and his son
during childbirth. Tragic doesn’t even begin to describe the situation.
You feel the heartache in the simple refrain, “I am tired, I am weak, I
am worn”. It’s a cry for help and comfort beyond what the world can
offer.
</p>
<p>
One notable fan of the song was MLK. Dr. King would often asked Mahalia
Jackson to sing this particular song at civil rights rallies. He even
made her promise to sing the song at his funeral. And on April 4th, 1968
outside the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee, Dr. King’s last
recorded words were to musician Ben Branch for an event he was
performing that evening…
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“Ben, make sure you play ‘Take My Hand, Precious Lord’ in the meeting
tonight. Play it real pretty.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Moments later, Dr. King was shot and died on the way to the hospital.
This began a bit of a tradition with this song.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WduYIw8Yrnw">Mahalia sang the
song at Dr. King’s funeral in 1968</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://youtu.be/GoBaMglyKh0">Aretha sang the song at Mahalia’s
funeral in 1972</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPAvIMC9g14">Aretha sang the
song at the MLK memorial dedication in 2011</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ay2Fi_Ao_tU">Fantasia sang the
song at Aretha’s funeral in 2018</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Dozens of famous people from Bruce Springsteen to Nina Simone have sung
versions of this song, but to me the best recorded version of this song
comes from Aretha Franklin’s groundbreaking and award-winning gospel
album <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4eiQmJsSsI"><em>Amazing
Grace</em>, recorded in Los Angeles in 1972</a> which is also an
<a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/amazing-grace-2018/">incredible
documentary</a> (2018) if you haven’t already seen it already. The choir
and the bassist do most of the work but it punches you right in the gut.
At one point Aretha appears to sing the wrong verse over the choir, but
she knows what she’s doing. It’s layers upon layers stitched inside a
medley, building up a magical tapestry of song.

<p>
When I’m feeling the pains of the world I often think about this song. I
think about how exhausting it must have been to pick yourself up under
the oppression of Jim Crow. No doubt it would leave you feeling tired,
weak, and worn at the end of each night. To have freedom in a free
country. To have a vote. To have dignity.
</p>
<p>
When I’m tired at end of a night, I sit at the piano and try to play
this song. It never sounds as beautiful as those who have sung it before
but it hits all the same. I think this would be a wonderful song to have
at a funeral. Play it real pretty.

to place in them, and how opaque most of them are about who owns them
and what sorts of data they retain.
</p>
<p>
A
<a href="https://www.techtransparencyproject.org/articles/apple-offers-apps-with-ties-to-chinese-military">new
study</a> found that many commercials VPNS are (often surreptitiously)
owned by Chinese companies.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
It would be hard for U.S. users to avoid the Chinese VPNs. The ownership
of many appeared deliberately opaque, with several concealing their
structure behind layers of offshore shell companies. TTP was able to
determine the Chinese ownership of the 20 VPN apps being offered to
Apple’s U.S. users by piecing together corporate documents from around
the world. None of those apps clearly disclosed their Chinese ownership…

<h1 id="2025-05-25-iphone-gopro-tears">
2025-05-25 iPhone, GoPro, tears
</h1>
<p>
I have a GoPro which I used to take a nice
<a href="/wiki/2024-04-06-maledives-14.mov">6s video of a young
whale</a> when we went to the <a href="2024-04-06-maledives">Maledives
in 2024</a>.
</p>
<p>
I also took hours of not so important video. There is, of course, an
iPhone app for the GoPro. It currently has 45 GB of videos on it. I
can’t access the iPhone from my wife’s Mac without upgrading it.
</p>
<p>
So I use my Linux Laptop to connect to the phone. And my wife’s Mac is
mounted via wifi, and it has the external, encrypted hard disk where the
images and videos should go. Current transfer speed is 1.3 MB/sec.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes I do feel the bars of the golden cage. 😔
</p>
<p>
And there so many random errors. Or a laptop that falls asleep. Or a
duplicate filename. These things always interrupt the process and wait
for user input.
</p>
<p>
This is where the tears come in.

<p>
<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23GoPro">#GoPro</a>

card directly. Perhaps the file formats need converting? Perhaps my
wife’s Mac doesn’t have a working card reader?

Standard formats. Standard connectors.

<h2 id="sumartin-dubrovnik">2025-05-23 Sumartin, Dubrovnik</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-27, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2025-05-23-sumartin-dubrovnik">
2025-05-23 Sumartin, Dubrovnik
</h1>
<p>
When we left our hotel in Postira, the receptionist asked where we were
going next. “Dubrovnik,” we said. “Oh, you will love it,” she said.
“And,” she added, “the price for walking on the old city walls is insane
but it’s still worth it.” She was right. It costs 40€ per person, but
it’s the kind of thing you just do once in a lifetime, as a tourist.
</p>
<p>
We started in Postira on the island of Brač, right across Split, but we
had decided to take a different ferry and drove all the way to Sumartin
and took the ferry to Makarska, then drove to Dubrovnik. Once at the
hotel at Lapad Bay we put on our jogging shoes and jogged to the old
town, paid the price and walked around the old town. After that, the sun
started sinking and we did a quick tour on foot and jogged back.
</p>
<p>
Yet another marina, yet another church.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-23-dubrovnik-1.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Usually, the working vessels are in different harbours or out at sea but
here’s where we saw some of them up close. All these crates. It makes me
want to eat less seafood.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-23-dubrovnik-2.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
We didn’t want to stay in the car so we went to the upper deck. It was
cold and windy. We ended up staying in the car after about half an hour.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-23-dubrovnik-3.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
As we drove along the coast, the landscape changed.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-23-dubrovnik-4.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
We took a break, had some coffee, croissant and a kind of pistachio
cake.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-23-dubrovnik-5.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Finally in Dubrovnik after a long drive, with our running shoes or
sandals, running towards the old town. There are plenty of hotels built
into the rock face, but sometimes you can find angles were it all looks
wild and green.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-23-dubrovnik-6.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
We paid the outrageous price and climbed those walls.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-23-dubrovnik-7.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
This is May. This is off-season. This is why it’s so empty. But
practically everybody you see is a tourist and practically every shop
you see is a restaurant or a souvenir shop. It’s like a stage.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-23-dubrovnik-8.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
This is the entrance into the city. A mass of fortifications and rings.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-23-dubrovnik-9.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Still the entrance, with a bridge over the former ditch. And people and
cars. Happily, no cars inside the old town.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-23-dubrovnik-10.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
This cove is protected by another fort, disconnected from the main
walls.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-23-dubrovnik-11.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
The soldiers used to be smaller, I guess.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-23-dubrovnik-12.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Inside the walls, there are still ruins.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-23-dubrovnik-13.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Outside the walls, the rock face.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-23-dubrovnik-14.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
There’s a hill behind the old town and a cable car that goes up there.
</p>
<p>
You can see the wall with people on it on the left, and you can see that
sometimes the ruins meld into patios and terraces and there are still
people living there.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-23-dubrovnik-15.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Claudia looking into the evening sun.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-23-dubrovnik-16.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Looking back at that little cove protected by that separate fort.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-23-dubrovnik-17.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Looking back inside into courtyards and houses interspersed with
crumbling walls.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-23-dubrovnik-18.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Somebody built a tunnel through the city wall and now there’s a coffee
house on the outside, on the rock face between city walls and the sea.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-23-dubrovnik-19.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Claudia is taking pictures of gardens and orchards within the city
walls. There were some cats down there as well and I think at least half
the tourists were meowing from the walls, trying to get some sort of
reaction out of the cats.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-23-dubrovnik-20.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Looking across an orchard into an alley.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-23-dubrovnik-21.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Sometimes the interesting plants grow on inaccessible roofs. And in the
back is a school, I guess, because there’s one of these multi-functional
sport courts visible. Notice how all of this is invisible from the
alleys.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-23-dubrovnik-22.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
More ruins. And a guy chilling in the back, looking at his phone.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-23-dubrovnik-23.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
I guess the 40€ per person go towards wall maintenance. There was a part
along the walls where new constructions were happening.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-23-dubrovnik-24.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
After having circled around half the old town, there’s a bigger harbour,
also protected by extra forts.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-23-dubrovnik-25.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Looking at the rooftop landscape makes me think of books and games where
thieves run around on these roofs, jumping across alleys. Never!!
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-23-dubrovnik-26.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
The old moat is a road and sometimes there are parking lots.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-23-dubrovnik-27.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
The sun began to set. Notice another basketball court in the lower right
corner.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-23-dubrovnik-28.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Stairs.
</p>
<p>

<h2 id="helping-harvard">Helping Harvard?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-26, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I feel like I should help Harvard, because Harvard helped me, and if you
use podcasting or RSS, it helped you too.
</p>
<p>
In 2002, I was ready to leave Silicon Valley, and
<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> needed a safe
place to be parked, or I felt the tech industry would keep trying to own
it, and make it far more complicated than it needed to be. And I wanted
the intellectuals of academia to blog.
</p>
<p>
So I knocked on the door at Harvard, because I heard they had a program
that was close to being up my alley – the Berkman Center for the
Internet and Society. My friend
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Perry_Barlow">John Perry
Barlow</a> was a founding member. I figured if they could handle a
Grateful Dead lyricist, and general muck-raking rabble-rouser like
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=Barlow">Barlow</a>, they
might be able to appreciate someone of my creative caliber. They
accepted me, gave me run of the place, defended us when we got in
trouble and great things came from it. But I always felt like a bit of a
thorn in the side of the great elite Harvard University.
</p>
<p>
Yet I really really really appreciate what they did, but I think what I
have to offer might not be appreciated.
</p>
<p>
I think they should take advantage of their unique perspective on what’s
happening in the US, and cover it in a way that no news organization
would or could, but the way a great, challenged,
<a href="https://www.harvard.edu/in-focus/harvard-and-the-american-revolution/">revolutionary</a>
academic institution would. And it might be that the people who would
destroy it don’t want to take the risk that Harvard might be heard, and
it might be a bit premature for them to think they can take control of
an organization that in a sense represents the best of the USA since
1636.
</p>
<p>
PS: When Harvard was 140 years old it stood against the King of England
in the
<a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2011/10/harvards-year-of-exile/">American
Revolution</a>. The Continental Army lived on the Harvard Campus in 1775
and 1776. The precedent for revolution is baked into the soul of
Harvard, it seems to me.

<h2 id="the-halliburton-choke">The Halliburton Choke</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-26, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I never really had any opinion about the Indiana Pacers.
</p>
<p>
Honestly I was surprised they even made the playoffs this year.
</p>
<p>
And they did catch the Knicks with their pants down, after clearing out
the reigning champion Boston Celtics in the second round of the playoffs
this year, it took some time before they found their balance again. We
learned, again, that we need to have some minutes every game where
Brunson takes a long well-deserved rest, so there’s room for KAT to lead
the team (our other all-star and all-NBA player), and make sure the
other Knicks get a chance to shine, and give the Pacers something to
guess about. Brunson is great at charging the rim against all odds, but
you don’t make the Finals if that’s the only trick in your quiver.
Hopefully we don’t have to keep learning that lesson.
</p>

The Halliburton Choke.
</div>
</p>
<p>
My advice for Halliburton, take a moment and breathe and realize <i>this
series isn’t over.</i> The Knicks have a say in it too. And the two
teams are remarkably well matched. And despite what the pundits say,
there’s nothing very special about the Pacers, in fact they have some
growing up to do. Halliburton, if they should happen to win another game
this year, should learn that either of the first two games in the series
could easily have gone the other way. And so should the freaking
pundits, when they focus on how great the Pacers were and how pitiful
the Knicks are. The Pacers won the first game by three points, and the
second one by five. And the Knicks won the third game by six. Could have
gone the other way too. And the Knicks are fucking great at overcoming
20-point deficits. The absolute best in the NBA. I have to remember that
too, because there was a point in yesterday’s game where I gave up. Dave
of little faith.
</p>
<p>
They will call this dance The Halliburton Choke.
<a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/155665636105">Reggie Miller</a> made
it famous and Halliburton made it ridiculous, and vice versa.

<h2 id="pete-rose">Pete Rose</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-25, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
It was so predictable. Shortly after Pete Rose died, baseball
<a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/article/calls-escalate-against-rob-manfred-220702792.html">rescinded
his lifetime ban</a>, and
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=May+13%2C+2025%2C+Manfred+instituted+a+change">now
he can</a> be
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=pete+rose+hall+of+fame+induction">inducted</a>
into the Hall of Fame.
</p>
<p>
I grew up with a Pete Rose ethos, why shouldn’t I go for it all? I feel
so sad that he couldn’t have gotten the acceptance he so totally
deserved. How could we not forgive him? He was Charlie Hustle! <span
class="spOldSchoolEmoji">❤️</span>
</p>
<p>
A role model in so many ways, and like all heroes he had fatal flaws.
You may think he set a bad example for kids, but I say the opposite. You
don’t give kids enough credit.
</p>
<p>
What he taught was that a man with average athletic ability could will
himself to achieve.
</p>
<p>
He had
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Rose#Records_and_achievements">more
hits</a> than any baseball player ever.

day away from the blog. Really enjoying the NBA playoffs, even though
the Knicks are still in it. Nice turnaround after the first quarter for
the Minnesotas. Still hoping for a finals between them and the Knicks.
It’ll be interesting to see how the Knicks change their lineup.
Hopefully no more isolation-ball with Brunson. It’s boring and doesn’t
work. Melo 2.0. Might make sense if he was LeBron, but he’s not and
LeBron’s game is boring anyway. Let’s do this well, win or lose.</p>
