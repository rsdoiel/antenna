## This AI-generated Fortnite video is a bleak glimpse at our future

date: 2025-05-25, updated: 2025-05-24, from: Polygon Website

Earlier this week, Google unveiled Flow, a tool that can be used to generate AI video with ease.

## A definitive ranking of Tom Cruise’s 26 best action movies

date: 2025-05-24, updated: 2025-05-24, from: Polygon Website

After spending several months doing not much besides watching Tom Cruise movies, I now spend a lot of time wondering about Tom Cruise running. The Mission: Impossible star is a high-cadence runner. He’s famously short of stature, low to the ground and with short legs. But that build is perfect for cinema, because those arms [&#8230;]

## Rick and Morty team didn’t worry about the lore ‘we owe’ in season 8 — only Rick’s baggage

Rick and Morty remains a staggering work of chaotic creativity. Previewing a handful of episodes from season 8, which premieres Sunday, May 25 with a Matrix-themed story inspired by phone charger theft, I still had that brain-melty “How do they think of this stuff?” feeling from when the show premiered more than a decade ago.

## Despelote might be the best game ever about childhood

date: 2025-05-24, updated: 2025-05-24, from: Polygon Website

One of the great magic tricks of art — or perhaps just of the human brain — is the ability to transmute something hyper-specific and personal into something universal. Despelote is an autobiographical, semi-documentary game about being a kid in Ecuador during the country’s first successful qualifying run for the 2002 World Cup. It’s also [&#8230;]

Blizzard Entertainment rolled out its hero ban feature for Overwatch 2 in April, and if you’ve been playing any competitive games during season 16, you’ve probably noticed that certain heroes (e.g., Sombra, Zarya, Symmetra, Ana, Mercy) are among the most consistently banned characters.

## Turns out, Mario Kart 8 has been gaslighting everyone for a decade

The first time anyone jumps into Mario Kart 8’s 200cc mode can be a shock. The engine class is meant to be the hardest challenge in the game, but even so, racing in 200cc can sometimes feel egregiously punishing.

Elden Ring Nightreign is designed around three-player squads, but solo play is possible. (Whether it’s enjoyable going solo remains to be seen.) But support for duos isn’t part of the plan and won’t be available when the game launches next week.
