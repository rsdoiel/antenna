host humoral innate immune response to the smooth-to-rough adaptation of
Mycobacterium abscessus in chronic infection</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Mycobacterium abscessus is a nontuberculous mycobacterium emerging as
a significant pathogen in individuals with chronic lung diseases,
including cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Current therapeutics have poor efficacy. Strategies of bacterial control
based on host defenses are appealing; however, antimycobacterial
immunity remains poorly understood and is further complicated by the
appearance of smooth and rough morphotypes, which elicit distinct host
responses. We investigated the role of serum components in
neutrophil-mediated clearance of M. abscessus morphotypes. M. abscessus
opsonization with complement enhanced bacterial killing compared to
complement-deficient opsonization. Killing of rough isolates was less
reliant on complement. Complement C3 and mannose-binding lectin 2 (MBL2)
were deposited on M. abscessus morphotypes in distinct patterns, with a
greater association of MBL2 on rough M. abscessus. Killing was dependent
on C3; however, depletion and competition experiments indicate that
canonical complement activation pathways are not involved.
Complement-mediated killing relied on natural IgG and IgM for smooth
morphotypes and on IgG for rough morphotypes. Both morphotypes were
recognized by complement receptor 3 in a carbohydrate- and
calcium-dependent manner. These findings indicate a role for
noncanonical C3 activation pathways for M. abscessus clearance by
neutrophils and link smooth-to-rough adaptation to complement
activation.</p>

and phylogenetic analyses of Bipolaris species associated with Poales
and Asparagales host plants in Iran</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Bipolaris species exhibit various ecological roles, including plant
pathogens, epiphytes, saprophytes, or endophytes, primarily associated
with poaceous hosts, including cultivated cereals. Iran is known for its
diverse climates and rich flora, which serve as a hotspot for fungal
diversity. In this study, to determine the species diversity of
Bipolaris associated with members of the Poales and Asparagales plant
orders, samples with leaf and stem lesion symptoms were collected from
these plants across various locations in Iran between 2010 and 2022.
Based on the morphological characteristics and multi-locus phylogeny
(ITS−rDNA, GAPDH, and TEF1), nine Bipolaris species were identified:
Bipolaris avrinica sp. nov., Bipolaris azarbaijanica sp. nov., Bipolaris
banihashemii sp. nov., Bipolaris hedjaroudei sp. nov., Bipolaris
hemerocallidis sp. nov., Bipolaris iranica sp. nov., Bipolaris persica
sp. nov., Bipolaris crotonis, and Bipolaris salkadehensis. B. crotonis
represents a new record for Iran’s funga, while B. salkadehensis has
been documented on several new hosts globally. The study provides
detailed morphological descriptions and illustrations of all identified
species, along with insights into their habitats, distributions, and
phylogenetic relationships within the Bipolaris genus. This study also
emphasizes the need for further research into fungal biodiversity in
Iran and provides significant data on the distribution and host range of
Bipolaris species.</p>

but non-cultivable state in oral microbiota: a critical review of an
underexplored microbial survival strategy</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The viable but non-cultivable (VBNC) state and persister cells, two
dormancy phenomena in bacteria, differ in various aspects. The entry of
bacteria into the VBNC state as a survival strategy under stressful
conditions has gained increasing attention in recent years, largely due
to the higher tolerance of VBNC cells to antibiotics and antimicrobials
resulting from their low metabolic activity. The oral cavity favors
biofilm growth in dental hard tissues, resulting in tooth decay and
periodontitis. Despite advances in VBNC state detection in the food
industry and environment, the entry capability of oral bacteria into the
VBNC state remains poorly documented. Furthermore, the VBNC state has
recently been observed in oral pathogens, including Porphyromonas
gingivalis, which shows potential relevance in chronic systemic
infections, Enterococcus faecalis, an important taxon in endodontic
infections, and Helicobacter pylori, which exhibits transient presence
in the oral cavity. Further research could create opportunities to
develop novel therapeutic strategies to control oral pathogens. The
inability of conventional culture-based methods to identify VBNC
bacteria and the metabolic reactivation of dormant cells to restore
susceptibility to therapies highlights a notable gap in anti-VBNC state
strategies. The lack of targeted approaches tested for efficacy against
VBNC bacteria underscores the need to develop novel detection methods.
This review discusses the VBNC state, its importance in public health,
and diagnostic techniques, with a special focus on the VBNC state in
oral bacteria.</p>

id="beyond-antibiotics-exploring-multifaceted-approaches-to-combat-bacterial-resistance-in-the-modern-era-a-comprehensive-review">Beyond
antibiotics: exploring multifaceted approaches to combat bacterial
resistance in the modern era: a comprehensive review</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Antibiotics represent one of the most significant medical
breakthroughs of the twentieth century, playing a critical role in
combating bacterial infections. However, the rapid emergence of
antibiotic resistance has become a major global health crisis,
significantly complicating treatment protocols. This paper provides a
narrative review of the current state of antibiotic resistance,
synthesizing findings from primary research and comprehensive review
articles to examine the various mechanisms bacteria employ to counteract
antibiotics. One of the primary sources of antibiotic resistance is the
improper use of antibiotics in the livestock industry. The emergence of
drug-resistant microorganisms from human activities and industrial
livestock production has presented significant environmental and public
health concerns. Today, resistant nosocomial infections occur following
long-term hospitalization of patients, causing the death of many people,
so there is an urgent need for alternative treatments. In response to
this crisis, non-antibiotic therapeutic strategies have been proposed,
including bacteriophages, probiotics, postbiotics, synbiotics, fecal
microbiota transplantation (FMT), nanoparticles (NPs), antimicrobial
peptides (AMPs), antibodies, traditional medicines, and the
toxin-antitoxin (TA) system. While these approaches offer innovative
solutions for addressing bacterial infections and preserving the
efficacy of antimicrobial therapies, challenges such as safety,
cost-effectiveness, regulatory hurdles, and large-scale implementation
remain. This review examines the potential and limitations of these
strategies, offering a balanced perspective on their role in managing
bacterial infections and mitigating the broader impact of antibiotic
resistance.</p>

proteomic landscape of Toxoplasma gondii extracellular vesicles across
diverse host cell types</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionExtracellular vesicles (EVs) are emerging as powerful
tools used by pathogens to manipulate host cells, delivering molecular
cargo that rewires cellular processes and the immune response.
Toxoplasma gondii, a globally distributed parasite capable of infecting
nearly all nucleated animal cells, uses this strategy to thrive in
diverse host species and tissue environments.MethodsHere, we reveal the
adaptability of T. gondii EVs through proteomic analysis of vesicles
released from tachyzoites cultured in four different host cell types:
human fibroblasts, green monkey kidney epithelial cells, mouse myoblasts
and porcine intestinal epithelial cells.ResultsA core set of 1,244
proteins was consistently identified across TgEVs, defining a conserved
signature. Beyond this conserved cargo, host-cell specific variation
revealed how T. gondii fine-tunes EV content to exploit different
cellular environments. Functional enrichment analyses revealed roles for
TgEVs in targeting host protein synthesis and stress response pathways,
with implications for immune evasion and infection
spread.DiscussionThese findings provide insight into the potential role
of EVs in host-pathogen interactions and help us understand the adaptive
strategies used by T. gondii to survive and spread.</p>

acid suppresses porcine epidemic diarrhea virus infection by inhibiting
viral entry and viral main protease</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has resulted in significant
economic losses in the global swine industry, making the development of
effective therapeutic approaches a pressing need. In this study, we
found that chebulinic acid significantly restrained PEDV replication in
CCL-81 and LLC-PK1 cells, demonstrated by reductions in viral genome,
viral protein, and titer. Molecular docking analysis made it clear that
chebulinic acid might bind the key amino acids of binding pocket and the
active center of PEDV main protease. Subsequent in vitro experiments
confirmed the inhibitory effects of chebulinic acid on PEDV main
protease, with an IC50 value of 61.53 ± 2.12 μM determined through a
fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay. Additional
investigations demonstrated that chebulinic acid could inhibit the
attachment and penetration processes of PEDV infection. Overall, our
results provide experimental evidence supporting the inhibitory effects
of chebulinic acid on PEDV infection by targeting viral entry and the
inhibitory effects on main protease. The results of this study offer
potential for creating new treatments for porcine epidemic diarrhea.</p>

genomic comparison of gut significantly enriched microbes in obese
individuals pre- and post-bariatric surgery across diverse
locations</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionObesity, a pressing global health issue, is intricately
associated with distinct gut microbiota profiles. Bariatric surgeries,
such as Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy (LSG), Sleeve Gastrectomy (SG),
and Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB), induce substantial weight loss and
reshape gut microbiota composition and functionality, yet their
comparative impacts remain underexplored.MethodsThis study integrated
four published metagenomic datasets, encompassing 500 samples, and
employed a unified bioinformatics workflow for analysis. We assessed gut
microbiota α-diversity, identified species biomarkers using three
differential analysis approaches, and constructed high-quality
Metagenome-Assembled Genomes (MAGs). Comparative genomic, functional
profiling and KEGG pathway analyses were performed, alongside estimation
of microbial growth rates via Peak-to-Trough Ratios (PTRs).ResultsRYGB
exhibited the most pronounced enhancement of gut microbiota α-diversity
compared to LSG and SG. Cross-cohort analysis identified 39 species
biomarkers: 27 enriched in the non-obesity group (NonOB_Enrich) and 12
in the obesity group (OB_Enrich). Among the MAGs, 177 were NonOB_Enrich
and 14 were OB_Enrich. NonOB_Enrich MAGs displayed enriched carbohydrate
degradation profiles (e.g., GH105, GH2, GH23, GH43, and GT0 families)
and higher gene diversity in fatty acid biosynthesis and secondary
metabolite pathways, alongside significant enrichment in amino acid
metabolism (KEGG analysis). Post-surgery, Akkermansia muciniphila and
Bacteroides uniformis showed elevated growth rates based on
PTRs.DiscussionThese findings underscore RYGB’s superior impact on gut
microbiota diversity and highlight distinct microbial functional
adaptations linked to weight loss, offering insights for targeted
therapeutic strategies.</p>

cord blood level of interleukins used as a predictor of early-onset
neonatal sepsis: a comprehensive review</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Neonatal sepsis (NS) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in
both preterm and term infants; early-onset NS (EONS) occurs in newborns
within the first 72 h of life. Cytokines are messengers with low
molecular weight that are produced by macrophages and lymphocytes in
response to antigenic stimulations or products of inflammation.
Different interleukins (IL) have higher values in EONS, when detected
from peripheral venous blood. This review aims to analyze if the
cytokines determined from the umbilical cord blood (UCB) of newborns may
help in the rapid and accurate diagnosis of EONS in newborns originating
from pregnancies with maternal–fetal infectious risk. Three databases,
namely, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, were searched for original
research articles that assessed the relationship between interleukins
and EONS. The search results retrieved a number of 18 articles that
complied with the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Some studies report
that neonates with EONS had higher umbilical plasma levels of cytokines
such as IL-1ß, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-18, and IL-27. However, results are
controversial, as many authors failed to establish the cut-off values of
cytokines detected from UCB that may predict EONS. The main limitations
of the current studies remain the small study samples, the heterogeneous
population, and the lack of stratification of the studied population
according to gestational age (GA). The cytokines that seem to be more
accurate in the early diagnosis of EONS, as reported by the majority of
the studies, are IL-6 and IL-8. The level of these cytokines may guide
clinicians in the careful administration of antibiotics, thus aiding in
the overall reduction of antimicrobial resistance.</p>

and validation of a clinical prediction model for pneumonia - associated
bloodstream infections</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>PurposeThe aim of this study was to develop a valuable clinical
prediction model for pneumonia-associated bloodstream infections
(PABSIs).Patients and methodsThe study retrospectively collected
clinical data of pneumonia patients at the First Medical Centre of the
Chinese People’s Liberation Army General Hospital from 2019 to 2024.
Patients who met the definition of pneumonia-associated bloodstream
infections (PABSIs) were selected as the main research subjects. A
prediction model for the probability of bloodstream infections (BSIs) in
pneumonia patients was constructed using a combination of LASSO
regression and logistic regression. The performance of the model was
verified using several indicators, including receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curve, calibration curve, decision curve analysis
(DCA) and cross validation.ResultsA total of 423 patients with confirmed
pneumonia were included in the study, in accordance with the Inclusion
Criteria and Exclusion Criteria. Of the patients included in the study,
73 developed a related bloodstream infection (BSI). A prediction model
was constructed based on six predictors: long-term antibiotic use,
invasive mechanical ventilation, glucocorticoids, urinary
catheterization, vasoactive drugs, and central venous catheter
placement. The areas under the curve (AUC) of the training set and
validation set were 0.83 and 0.80, respectively, and the calibration
curve demonstrated satisfactory agreement between the two.ConclusionThis
study has successfully constructed a prediction model for bloodstream
infections associated with pneumonia cases, which has good stability and
predictability and can help guide clinical work.</p>

pneumonia in children: a review</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a major cause of death in
children, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) is the main pathogen of CAP in
children in China. Although Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (MPP) is
usually a self-limiting disease, many children develop multiple
complications due to drug resistance or untimely diagnosis and
treatment, and may even progress to severe MPP or refractory MPP with a
poor prognosis. It is important to explore the value of biomarkers that
can be used in clinical practice to assess the severity of pneumonia and
assist in clinical decision making. In this article, we searched the
literature in the last four years to review the roles of various types
of biomarkers in MPP and the associated clinical predictive models, with
the aim of helping pediatricians to understand the evaluation indexes
related to MPP in children other than microbiology.</p>

gut microbiota promotes the progression of chronic kidney disease in 5/6
nephrectomy mice by Bacillus pumilus gavage</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundOur previous study identified differences in the gut
microbiota between patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and
healthy individuals. We observed that antibiotic-treated mice exhibited
symptoms similar to those of patients with CKD after receiving a gut
microbiota transplant from patients with CKD. Bacillus pumilus (B.
pumilus), an alien microorganism to both human and mouse gut microbiota,
possesses antibiotic properties that can alter the microbial community
structure. Therefore, this study aimed to explore how changes in the gut
microbiota structure induced by the oral gavage of B. pumilus affect the
progression of CKD. We sought to identify the gut microbes and metabolic
pathways associated with CKD to lay the groundwork for future clinical
probiotic applications in patients with CKD.MethodsWe constructed
sham-operated and 5/6 nephrectomy mice as the sham control (SC) and CKD
models, respectively. CKD models were divided into a control group (CG)
and an intervention group (IG). After 16 weeks of normal feeding, the IG
were treated with B. pumilus by oral gavage, while SC and CG were
treated with PBS once daily, 5 days per week, for 7 weeks. Fecal samples
were collected for 16s rRNA sequencing and metabolomic analysis, kidneys
were harvested for histological examination, and the colon was used for
RT-PCR analysis.ResultsB. pumilus intervention exacerbated gut microbial
homeostasis in CKD mice and increased serum creatinine and urea nitrogen
levels, further aggravating kidney damage. 16s rRNA and metabolomic
analysis revealed that Parvibacter and Enterorhabdus were probiotics
related to kidney function, while Odoribacter was associated with kidney
injury. Metabolomic analysis showed that glycerophospholipid and lysine
metabolism were upregulated in CKD model mice, correlating with kidney
damage.ConclusionThis study shows that changes in the gut microbiota can
affect the kidneys through gut metabolism, confirming that the lack of
probiotics and the proliferation of harmful bacteria leading to gut
microbiota dysbiosis are drivers of CKD progression. Our findings
provide a basis for clinical interventions using gut microbes and offer
a reference for targeted probiotic therapy.</p>

<p>date: 2025-03-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Mosquito-borne diseases such as chikungunya, dengue, and Zika
represent a major burden on global public health. To fight against these
arboviruses, vector control strategies are a priority. One existing
strategy is based on the use of an endosymbiotic bacterium, Wolbachia,
which reduces the transmission of arboviruses by the mosquito Aedes
aegypti via a pathogen blocking effect. Wolbachia in Ae. aegypti
disrupts several pathways of the host’s metabolism. Trehalose is a
carbohydrate circulating mainly in insect hemolymph and plays a role in
numerous mechanisms as energy source or stress recovery molecule and in
chitin synthesis. This study explores the importance of trehalose in the
interactions between Wolbachia and Ae. aegypti, and attempts to
understand the pathogen blocking effect.</p>

experience of primary subcutaneous mycoses in Shanghai: a retrospective
analysis</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionPrimary subcutaneous mycoses are a heterogeneous group of
fungal infections caused by pathogenic or opportunistic organisms. In
recent years, cases have steadily increased in Shanghai, an area where
the disease was previously uncommon. This study aimed to summarize
clinical experiences with primary subcutaneous mycoses in Shanghai, to
optimize their management.MethodA retrospective analysis was conducted
at Shanghai Dermatology Hospital from January 2018 to March 2023 and
enrolled 33 patients with confirmed primary subcutaneous mycoses. Their
medical histories, clinical features, histopathological findings,
etiological characteristics, drug sensitivity tests, therapeutic
regimens, and follow-up data were recorded.ResultsIdentification of
pathogens from skin tissue cultures revealed distinct colonial
morphologies across diverse mycological species. The isolates included
yeast (45.5%), mold (30.3%), and dimorphic fungi (24.2%). The most
common species were C. parapsilosis (n = 8, 24.2%), T. rubrum (n = 5,
15.2%), and S. schenckii (n = 8, 24.2%). Thirty-two patients received
systemic antifungal treatment based on the results of the drug
sensitivity test, whereas one patient was treated with complete surgical
resection, owing to a single plaque. Post-treatment surveillance was
important for the effective management of the condition.ConclusionThis
study highlights the considerable diversity among fungal species
implicated in primary cutaneous mycoses and underscores the complexities
involved in their accurate diagnosis and management. Correcting
unhealthy lifestyles, boosting immunity, and completely removing and
avoiding re-exposure to the pathogenic fungi can effectively reduce the
risk of relapse in primary subcutaneous mycoses. Our findings provide
valuable insights into primary subcutaneous mycoses and may contribute
to improved patient prognoses.</p>

surface. In this study, modified Virus Overlay Protein Binding Assay
(VOPBA) was employed to identify P35-interacting proteins from membrane
protein extracts of SV40-immortalized human uroepithelial (SV-HUC-1)
cells. Through recombinant protein binding assays, siRNA-mediated
knockdown, ELISA, Far-Western blot, and inhibition experiments, the
binding mechanisms and functional domains were further elucidated.
Results demonstrated that the P35 lipoprotein interacts with γ-actin
(ACTG1). Recombinant P35 specifically bound to both recombinant and
endogenous ACTG1 on the host cell membrane. ACTG1 partially inhibited
the adhesion of P35 and M. penetrans to host cells. In SV-HUC-1 cells
transfected with ACTG1-siRNA, adhesion of P35 and M. penetrans was
significantly reduced. Further studies identified the functional domains
responsible for binding between P35 and ACTG1 at amino acid residues
35-42 and 179-186. These findings suggest that ACTG1 on the host cell
membrane may act as a receptor for the P35 lipoprotein, facilitating the
adhesion of M. penetrans to host cells. The identified critical binding
regions of P35 represent potential targets for therapeutic interventions
against M. penetrans infections.</p>
