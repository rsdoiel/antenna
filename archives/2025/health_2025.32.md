## Dysbiosis of gut and urinary microbiota in urolithiasis patients and post-surgical cases

date: 2025-08-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundResearch on the microbial roles in urolithiasis primarily focuses on the intestinal microbiota. This study analyzed urine and fecal samples from three cohorts: healthy controls (Control), patients with urinary stones (US), and postoperative patients (PS). We conducted 16S rRNA sequencing analysis to evaluate the variations in microbial communities among these groups during urinary stone production and therapy processes.ResultsIn fecal microbiota, alpha diversity was lower in the stone group versus the control group, with the postoperative group showing the lowest diversity. The β diversity analysis revealed some differences in the microbial community structure of individuals with different health conditions. LEfSe and Wilcoxon analyses were utilized to discover species that exhibited significant differences between groups. Enterobacteriaceae and Bacteroides are more abundant in patients with stones. The increased abundance of Lactobacillus, Lachnospiraceae, Rumenococcaceae, Faecalibacterium, and Prevotella is associated with a reduced risk of kidney stones.ConclusionsAlterations in urinary and intestinal microbiota may indicate urolithiasis status and treatment response. Future studies should explore microbiota modulation (e.g., probiotics) as an adjunctive strategy, while antibiotic stewardship is warranted to minimize microbiota disruption.

## Establishment of reverse transcription recombinase-aided amplification with lateral flow dipstick for the rapid visual detection of Getah virus

date: 2025-08-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionGetah virus (GETV) is a globally spreading zoonotic mosquito-borne virus that primarily affects horses and pigs, causing significant economic losses in the livestock industry. Therefore, there is an urgent need for improved diagnostic methods to manage future outbreaks.MethodsIn this study, we developed a nucleic acid detection assay, reverse transcription recombinase-aided amplification with lateral flow dipstick (RT-RAA-LFD), for the rapid and convenient detection of GETV.ResultsThe RT-RAA-LFD assay could be completed at 40°C for 15 min. Under optimal reaction conditions, the assay demonstrated excellent specificity, with no cross-reactivity observed with other clinically relevant swine pathogens. It achieved a broad detection range and a limit of detection (LOD) of 5.53 × 102 copies/μL, which was lower than that of RT-PCR (5.53 × 103 copies/μL) assay and slightly higher than that of qRT-PCR (5.53 × 101 copies/μL) assay for GETV. When testing 21 blood samples, the results of RT-RAA-LFD were fully consistent with those of the RT-PCR and qRT-PCR assays. In testing 45 tissue samples, the Kappa value for consistency between RT-RAA-LFD and RT-PCR was 0.776 (P < 0.001), with a concordance rate of 95.6% (43/45). The Kappa value for consistency between RT-RAA-LFD and qRT-PCR was 0.845 (P < 0.001), with a concordance rate of 97.8% (44/45).ConclusionsIn conclusion, the RT-RAA-LFD assay shows great potential as a efficient and user-friendly diagnostic tool for GETV screening, particularly in laboratories with limited resources and equipment.

date: 2025-08-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectiveThis study aimed to establish a multiplex molecular point-of-care assay called fastNTM incorporating an ultra-fast sample pre-treatment for direct identification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) and 8 non-tuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM) commonly prioritized in clinical settings, and to evaluate its performance in 149 clinical confirmed mycobacterial-positive samples.MethodsThe study was divided into two stages: a pilot study to establish the methodology and a clinical validation study to evaluate its performance. In the pilot study, we established the fastNTM and analyzed its performance regarding limits of detection, reproducibility, specificity and efficiency. The clinical validation study was performed using 149 clinical confirmed mycobacterial-positive samples, with 16S rRNA identification as the reference standard. The complete process, from patient to result, was accomplished within 90 minutes.ResultsOf the 149 positive clinical mycobacterial cultures analyzed, 136 were within the designed targets. Among these 136 cultures, 133 samples were correctly identified by fastNTM, achieving an accuracy rate of 97.79%.ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that fastNTM with its high accuracy rate are capable to rapidly and effectively differentiate between MTBC and the major NTM species.

## Colistimethate sodium is efficacious and safe for the management of sepsis in hematological diseases patients: a retrospective study in China

date: 2025-08-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

PurposePatients afflicted with hematological diseases are at an elevated risk of infection, with the potential for the development of sepsis. This study aims to analyze the effectiveness and safety of colistimethate sodium (CMS) in the management of sepsis in Chinese patients with hematological diseases.MethodsA retrospective study was conducted on hematological diseases patients diagnosed as sepsis and treated with CMS at the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University between November 2021 and July 2023. Demographics, clinical presentation, causative organisms, clinical outcomes and adverse events (AEs) were recorded. The univariate and multivariate analysis was conducted to identify predictive factors for clinical effectiveness and renal insufficiency.ResultsA total of 81 hematological patients diagnosed with sepsis were included, the mean (change in sequential organ failure assessment [SOFA] score) ΔSOFA when utilizing CMS was 3.90 ± 2.10. Following CMS treatment, a clinical effectiveness rate was observed in 62.96% of patients, while the bacteriological eradication rate was 60.23%. Additionally, the 28-day all-cause mortality rate was 29.63%. The median length of stay in the ICU and total in-hospital stay was 13.5 and 33 days, respectively. AEs were reported in 16 patients (19.75%), including 15 (18.52%) renal insufficiency, 1 (1.23%) hepatic insufficiency, and 1 (1.23%) rash. The multivariate analysis of clinical effectiveness indicated that a higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score, a higher Charlson comorbidity index, the relapse or refractory of hematological diseases, septic shock, and the use of mechanical ventilation was independently associated with a poor clinical effectiveness. The univariate analysis of renal insufficiency demonstrated that allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, aplastic anemia, and gastrointestinal infection had a statistically significant impact on renal function.ConclusionsThe findings of our study demonstrated that CMS was an efficacious treatment for sepsis in Chinese patients with hematological diseases, while concurrently exhibiting an acceptable toxicity profile.

## Endometrial microbiome during early pregnancy among women with and without chronic endometritis: a pilot study

date: 2025-08-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionAlthough chronic endometritis (CE) is strongly associated with infertility and adverse pregnancy outcomes, the specific microbiome of women with CE who can conceive remain unclear.MethodsThis study recruited 100 participants aged 18 to 45 years with spontaneously conceived pregnancy who opted for pregnancy termination, detected their endometrial microbiome by 16S rRNA, and made a diagnosis of CE.ResultsAmong them, 19 were diagnosed with CE. There was a comparable microbial composition within the endometrium between women with and without CE. The relative abundance of Sphingomonas (21%) and Pseudomonas (8%) were the same in both groups. Compared to women without CE, women with CE exhibited higher abundance of Faecalibacterium (6.5% vs 3.8%), Escherichia-Shigella (3.3% vs 2.6%), Akkermansia (1.65% vs 1.1%), and lower abundance of Lactobacillus (10% vs 14%), and Corynebacterium (1.35% vs 2.15%) at the genus level. Streptococcus, Escherichia-Shigella, Akkermansia and Finegoldia exhibited significant interactions with other microbiome in participants with CE.DiscussionIn women with CE, reproductive potential may be associated with the compositional stability of the endometrial microbiome, whereas an imbalance in the abundance of these microbes may be linked to their pregnancy outcomes.

## Identification of an Aeromonas hydrophila strain as a new mosquito pathogen

date: 2025-08-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The gut microbiome plays a major role in promoting organismal homeostasis. Mosquito microbiota influences various aspects of host physiology such as immunity, development and vector competence. Most studies addressing mosquito microbiota consist of microbial diversity profiling and rarely investigate the effects of individual bacteria on host physiology. This remains an important gap of knowledge, especially since not all naturally occurring gut microbes are passive commensals. Here, we identify a pathogenic strain of Aeromonas hydrophila that causes mortality to both Culex pipiens and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes upon ingestion. In addition, we show that A. hydrophila breaches the gut epithelium and gains access to the hemolymph. Parallel to gut damage, we detect a significant increase in the number of proliferative cells in the midguts of A. hydrophila fed mosquitoes. Moreover, we find that this bacterium induces a local immune response in the gut leading to the production of anti-microbial peptides. Finally, whole genome sequencing of the isolated strain revealed that it possesses an arsenal of virulence and resistance genes, which provides mechanistic insights into its mosquitocidal activity. This study reports a novel mosquito pathogen and highlights how a bacterial species inhabiting the gut can impact the host’s survival and homeostasis.

## Gingipains disrupt bone homeostasis via dual regulation of osteogenesis and osteoclastogenesis through exosomal miR-146a-5p/TRAF6 signaling

date: 2025-08-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundGingipains are virulence factors released by Porphyromonas gingivalis that contribute to periodontal destruction by disrupting bone metabolism. This study aimed to evaluate the dual effects of gingipains on bone metabolism by examining their impact on osteogenesis and osteoclastogenesis, hypothesizing that gingipains regulate these processes via direct and exosomal pathways involving microRNA signaling.MethodsClinical samples of gingival crevicular fluid, subgingival plaque, and gingival tissues were collected from 15 patients with stage III-IV periodontitis and 15 healthy controls. The effects of gingipains on bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and RAW264.7 macrophages were assessed using cell proliferation assays, qPCR, western blot, microarray analysis, and dual-luciferase reporter assays. A rat periodontitis model was used to validate the findings in vivo.ResultsPeriodontitis patients exhibited elevated levels of lysine- and arginine-specific gingipains, C5a, and RANKL (p < 0.05). Gingipains inhibited BMSCs proliferation and osteogenic differentiation in a dose-dependent manner while promoting osteoclastogenesis in RAW264.7 macrophages through BMSCs-derived exosomes. Gingipains reduced the levels of miR-146a-5p in exosomes, which enhanced osteoclast differentiation through the miR-146a-5p/TRAF6 signaling pathway. Animal models confirmed that gingipains aggravated alveolar bone loss, which was mitigated by miR-146a-5p overexpression.ConclusionGingipains disrupt bone metabolism by inhibiting BMSCs osteogenesis and promoting osteoclastogenesis through communication via exosomes. Targeting miR-146a-5p offers a potential therapeutic approach to counter gingipain-induced periodontal destruction.

## Microbiota and enteric nervous system crosstalk in diabetic gastroenteropathy: bridging mechanistic insights to microbiome-based therapies

date: 2025-08-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Diabetes mellitus has emerged as a global public health crisis, with over half of patients experiencing gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms that exacerbate glucose fluctuations and impair quality of life. While prior research on the pathophysiology of diabetic gastroenteropathy (DGE) focused primarily on autonomic neuropathy, particularly involving the vagus nerve, recent studies have shifted toward the impairment of the enteric nervous system (ENS). As the largest autonomous neural network governing GI motility independent of central control, structural and functional abnormalities of the ENS constitute the fundamental pathological basis for DGE. This review first delineates gut microbial alterations in diabetes and mechanisms by which dysbiosis compromises the integrity of the ENS. Second, we analyze how microbiota-derived metabolites (short-chain fatty acids, bile acids, tryptophan), gut hormones (glucagon-like peptide-1, ghrelin), and neurotransmitters (acetylcholine, vasoactive intestinal peptide, nitric oxide) multitarget the ENS—collectively establishing the “microbiota-ENS axis” as the central hub for GI sensorimotor control. Finally, we provide an overview of preclinical and clinical evidence for microbiome-targeted therapies (probiotics, prebiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation) in alleviating DGE symptoms and repairing ENS while outlining translational challenges and future research priorities.

## Mechanisms and therapeutic perspectives of mitochondrial dysfunction of macrophages in periodontitis

date: 2025-08-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Periodontitis is a global inflammatory oral disease, and plaque-induced host excessive immune response is recognized as a major cause of its pathogenesis. In recent years, the relevance of mitochondrial dysfunction to periodontitis has been increasingly investigated, particularly with respect to macrophages, the key immune cells in the periodontal immune microenvironment. Mitochondrial dysfunction drives macrophage M1 polarization and osteoclast differentiation through mechanisms such as metabolic reprogramming, reactive oxygen species release, abnormal mitophagy, abnormal mitochondrial biogenesis and damaged mitochondrial dynamic. In addition, mitochondrial transfer in the periodontitis setting has been reported in several researches. In this review, we highlight the impact of mitochondrial dysfunction on macrophages in the periodontitis setting and summarize emerging therapeutic strategies for targeting mitochondria in periodontitis, including antioxidants, modulators of metabolic reprogramming, nanomaterials and photodynamic therapy.

## Diagnostic performance and clinical utility of metagenomic next-generation sequencing in suspected central nervous system infections: a prospective comparative study

date: 2025-08-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectiveTo assess the diagnostic performance and clinical utility of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) in patients with suspected central nervous system (CNS) infections.Methodsprospective study was conducted from December 2019 to January 2024, enrolling 110 patients with suspected CNS infections. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were subjected to mNGS, conventional biochemistry, and culture. Clinical features and outcomes were compared between patients confirmed with CNS infections and those without.ResultsOf the enrolled patients, 69 were diagnosed with CNS infections. mNGS identified pathogens in 62 cases (77.11%), including 54 clinically confirmed true positives (49.09%), significantly surpassing traditional CSF culture (6.36%). mNGS reported results within 24 hours, considerably shorter than the 72~120 hours required for culture. Compared to the non-infection group, patients with CNS infections had significantly higher ICU admission(ICUA) rates, prolonged hospital stays, increased healthcare costs, and elevated rates of antibiotic adjustment and mNGS positivity (P<0.05). CSF turbidity, cell count, and protein levels were significantly elevated, while glucose and chloride levels were reduced. Logistic regression identified mNGS, CSF protein, and glucose levels as independent predictors of CNS infection. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis demonstrated superior diagnostic accuracy for continuous CSF variables over binary ones, with mNGS showing robust performance [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.794].ConclusionmNGS offers rapid and accurate pathogen detection, outperforming conventional methods in sensitivity and turnaround time, and provides valuable guidance for individualized antimicrobial treatment in CNS infections.

## The relationship between immune cell infiltration and necroptosis gene expression in sepsis: an analysis using single-cell transcriptomic data

date: 2025-08-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundSepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. It remains a significant medical challenge due to its high mortality rates and requires a deeper understanding of its underlying mechanisms. This study aims to elucidate the differential expression of necroptosis-related genes in sepsis and their impact on immune characteristics.MethodsWe obtained gene expression profiles and single-cell RNA sequencing data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the limma package, and functional enrichment analysis was performed using the clusterProfiler package for Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) were conducted to explore pathway enrichments. Immune cell infiltration differences between sepsis (SE) and healthy control (HC) groups were quantified using the single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) algorithm. Differential marker genes between SE and HC groups were identified by single-cell data analysis using the Seurat and SingleR packages.ResultsOur results revealed 849 necroptosis-related DEGs, with 843 upregulated and 16 downregulated in the SE group. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression identified 22 key DEGs, including CTSS, MAPK8, and MPRIP. Among these, 157 necroptosis-related DEGs were consistently identified between SE and HC groups. GO analysis indicated significant enrichment in biological processes such as the regulation of apoptotic signaling pathways and IκB kinase/NF-κB signaling. KEGG pathway analysis revealed involvement in necroptosis, apoptosis, and NOD-like receptor signaling pathways. GSVA demonstrated that Wnt signaling was upregulated in the SE group. Significant differences in immune cell infiltration were observed between sepsis and healthy control groups, particularly in activated B cells and CD4 T cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified 33,287 cells categorized into 26 clusters, with neutrophils predominating. Key necroptosis genes such as CTSS, TXN, MYH9, FPR1, FMR1, and MPRIP exhibited differential expression patterns across various immune cell types.ConclusionsOur integrated bioinformatics approach provides insights into the role of necroptosis-related genes in sepsis pathogenesis and their influence on immune responses. These findings improve our understanding of sepsis mechanisms and may guide future therapeutic strategies targeting necroptosis pathways.

## Ferroptosis and mitochondrial ROS are central to SARS-CoV-2-induced hepatocyte death

date: 2025-08-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundAlthough COVID-19 primarily affects the respiratory tract, liver injury has been increasingly reported in infected individuals. The mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 induces hepatocyte damage remain poorly understood. Given the role of mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and regulated cell death in COVID-19 pathogenesis, we investigated the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on hepatocytes using the Huh7.5 cell model.MethodsHuh7.5 hepatocytes were infected with either the ancestral Wuhan (Wh) or Omicron (BA.5) variant of SARS-CoV-2. Viral replication was quantified via RT-qPCR, nucleocapsid protein detection, and infectious particle titration. Mitochondrial function was assessed through mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), mROS production, and mitophagy analysis. Lipid metabolism and regulated cell death (apoptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis) were evaluated by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. The role of specific cell death pathways was probed using chemical inhibitors.ResultsBoth SARS-CoV-2 variants efficiently infected Huh7.5 cells, with distinct replication kinetics. Infection induced mitochondrial fragmentation, elevated mROS levels, and lipid droplet accumulation. Ferroptosis was identified as a predominant mode of cell death, as evidenced by increased lipid peroxidation and the protective effect of ferrostatin-1. Expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), a ferroptosis marker and alternative viral entry receptor, was significantly upregulated post-infection in a variant-dependent manner. Additionally, mROS scavenging with MitoTEMPO impaired viral replication, underscoring the role of oxidative stress in the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle.ConclusionsSARS-CoV-2 disrupts mitochondrial homeostasis and lipid metabolism in hepatocytes, promoting ferroptosis as a major contributor to virus-induced cytopathology. These findings suggest that ferroptosis may play a central role in COVID-19-related liver injury and identify mitochondrial ROS and iron metabolism as potential therapeutic targets.

## Correlation of intestinal bacteria, fungi and dietary nutrient intake in NAFLD patients with spleen deficiency syndrome

date: 2025-08-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundSpleen deficiency syndrome (SDS) is one of the primary Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) syndromes in Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Diet influences NAFLD and SDS through the intestinal microbiota. The current study aimed to investigate the interrelationships of intestinal bacteria, fungi and dietary nutrient intake in NAFLD patients with SDS.MethodsThe NAFLD TCM Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) Scale was administered to evaluate the TCM clinical symptoms of NAFLD patients. The Spleen Deficiency PRO Scale and Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) were employed to respectively diagnose spleen deficiency syndrome and assess dietary nutrient intake, energy-adjusted dietary inflammatory index (E-DII), and dietary diversity scores (DDS) in NAFLD patients. Subsequently, stool samples were collected for 16S rRNA gene and ITS2 region sequencing to analyze the interrelationships among target intestinal bacteria, fungi, and dietary nutrient intake.ResultsThe NAFLD TCM PRO Scale indicated that the average score for symptoms related to SDS in NAFLD patients was 4.13 ± 0.40. Compared with NAFLD patients without SDS, those with SDS had insufficient dietary nutrient intake of diet-derived antioxidants such as carotene and folic acid, stronger pro-inflammatory effects of food, and reduced dietary diversity (P < 0.05). Additionally, sufficient dietary diversity was identified as a protective factor against SDS in NAFLD (OR: 0.424; 95% CI: 0.309, 0.583; P < 0.001). 16S rRNA gene and ITS2 region sequencing results showed that Collinsella (LDA = 3.947, P = 0.046) and Rhizopus (LDA = 3.196, P = 0.01) were enriched in NAFLD patients with SDS, whereas Intestinimonas was markedly increased in NAFLD patients without SDS (LDA = 2.015, P = 0.02). Correlation analysis demonstrated that Gemmiger and Rhizopus were significantly positively correlated (r = 0.778, P < 0.001), as were Candida and Segatella (r = 0.569, P < 0.001). Intestinimonas was positively correlated with the intake of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory nutrients such as dietary fiber, vitamin C, and iron (0.2 < r < 0.5, P < 0.05), while niacin intake was negatively correlated with Rhizopus abundance (r = -0.39, P = 0.025).ConclusionSymptoms related to SDS are common in patients with NAFLD. The independent and interactive effects of intestinal bacteria and fungi might have collectively influenced the immune function and inflammation levels in NAFLD patients with SDS. These processes were likely associated with the intake of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory nutrients, as well as niacin.

## Respiratory diseases and the gut microbiota: an updated review

date: 2025-08-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The gut microbiota constitutes a vital ecosystem within the human body playing a pivotal role in immune regulation and metabolic homeostasis. Emerging research underscores a sophisticated interplay between the gut and lungs, termed the “gut-lung axis.” Gut microbes exert influence over pulmonary immunity and metabolism via immune mediators (e.g., cytokines and interleukins), metabolites (e.g., short-chain fatty acids) and direct microbial translocation. Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota has been implicated in a spectrum of respiratory diseases, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), acute lung injury (ALI), Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), lung cancer, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) and tuberculosis (TB). Although multi-omics technologies have elucidated certain mechanisms underlying the gut-lung axis, numerous pathways remain to be fully delineated. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the role of gut microbiota and their metabolites in respiratory diseases and assesses their therapeutic potential. Future investigations should prioritize strategies to restore and maintain microbial homeostasis, such as dietary modifications, probiotic supplementation and fecal microbiota transplantation to pioneer novel preventive and therapeutic approaches. These summaries of advances in gut microbiology research promise better management and exploration of therapeutic strategies for respiratory diseases.

## Predictive analysis of all-cause mortality of previously untreated pulmonary tuberculosis patients complicated by hypertension

date: 2025-08-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectiveTo investigate the risk factors for all-cause mortality of previously untreated pulmonary tuberculosis patients complicated by hypertension and construct a predictive model.MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of inpatients with previously untreated pulmonary tuberculosis complicated by hypertension from 2019 to 2021 in Changsha Central Hospital. Patients’ survival status and cardiovascular events were collected through telephone follow-up. LASSO regression was utilized to screen predictive variables, and binary logistic regression identified mortality risk factors. A predictive nomogram model was developed using R software, and its precision and reliability were verified.ResultsAmong the 1,014 patients, there were 100 (9.86%) deaths and 82 (8.09%) cardiovascular events. LASSO regression screened out 13 predictive variables. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that smoking history, sputum bacteriology, pleural effusion, coronary heart disease, and chronic kidney disease were independent risk factors. Based on the training set data, a nomogram prognostic model was developed, showing an AUC of 0.712 (95% CI: 0.777-0.847), with 50.0% sensitivity and 84.3% specificity. The model’s fit was confirmed through internal and external validations.ConclusionThe prediction model constructed in this study has high predictive ability and satisfactory clinical efficacy, and can provide an effective individualized prediction tool for assessing all-cause mortality risk in patients with previously untreated pulmonary tuberculosis complicated by hypertension.

## Evolution, dissemination, and genetic dynamics of the carbapenem resistance gene blaNDM in China

date: 2025-08-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundBlaNDM, which encodes a metallo-β-lactamase that can hydrolyze most β-lactam antibiotics, has become a serious public health concern in China. It is crucial to investigate the evolution, dissemination, and genetic dynamics of blaNDM to develop potential strategies to control the proliferation of blaNDM.MethodsIn this study, we collected 1021 blaNDM-positive isolates, which features 67 new genomes from our laboratory and 954 genomes from NCBI. Through epidemiological big data analysis, phylogenetic tree-based geographic transmission analysis, and upstream-downstream genetic clustering evolution analysis, we systematically analyzed the evolution, dissemination, and genetic dynamics of blaNDM-positive bacteria.ResultsAnalysis results indicate that blaNDM-5 is gradually supplanting blaNDM-1 in China and Acinetobacter has been replaced as the primary blaNDM-harboring genus by the Enterobacter, Escherichia, and Klebsiella, which are both within the Enterobacteriaceae family and more easily transmitted among humans. Furthermore, blaNDM-positive bacteria exhibit a distinct livestock-environment-human transmission cycle, while the phylogenetic diversity of blaNDM and tet(X)-co-carrying genera is progressively expanding with concomitantly enhanced resistance phenotypes. Currently, the predominant blaNDM-positive bacterial strains have likely disseminated from southwest China to coastal regions. We further identified multiple transposon structures beyond Tn125 that may facilitate blaNDM transfer.ConclusionsThe diversity of the blaNDM and its carrier bacterial strains is continuously increasing, and its transmission range is also expanding. Of greater concern, super-resistant strains co-harboring blaNDM and tet(X) genes exhibit high potential for imminent emergence in human populations. Considering that the blaNDM-carrier bacteria are increasingly adapted to inter-human spread, the analysis results above can provide methodological and data support for epidemiological surveillance, tracing, and early warning alerts.

## Deletion of the E3 ubiquitin ligase LRSAM1 fosters intracellular Staphylococcus aureus survival

date: 2025-08-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundIntracellular invasion and persistence of Staphylococcus aureus can lead to chronic infection and is an effective strategy for the pathogen to evade the host immune response and antibiotic therapy. Selective ubiquitination of bacterial surfaces via E3 ubiquitin ligases is a mechanism by which host cells combat intracellular bacteria and target them for autophagosomal degradation. However, knowledge of the E3 ligases involved in intracellular recognition of S. aureus is still very limited.MethodsWe studied A549 lung epithelial cells during S. aureus infection, focusing on the role of the E3 ligase leucine rich repeat and sterile alpha motif containing 1 (LRSAM1). We used the CRISPR-Cas9 system to generate LRSAM1-deficient A549 cells and monitored intracellular bacterial survival, activation of host cellular signalling pathways related to cytokine production, and host cell death during S. aureus infection.ResultsIn LRSAM1-deficient host cells we observed a significant increase in intracellular bacterial load, which was accompanied by an increased host cell death and elevated secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6. Despite induced selective autophagy, LRSAM1 knockout host cells were incapable of lowering and eliminating the pathogen, which seems to be caused by the reduced ubiquitination of the bacterial surface.ConclusionThe results indicate a significant role of LRSAM1 in the clearance of intracellular S. aureus. This contributes to a deeper understanding of the host cellular responses to S. aureus infection and will facilitate the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat intracellularly persistent S. aureus.

## Puf4 -mediated oxidative stress virulence attenuation in Cryptococcus neoformans

date: 2025-08-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionCryptococcus neoformans is a ubiquitous environmental fungal pathogen whose pathogenicity is closely linked to its ability to adapt to host environments. The RNA-binding protein Puf4 plays a key role in regulating the cell wall of C. neoformans. However, the specific mechanisms by which Puf4 regulates metabolism and virulence remain unclear.MethodsIn this study, we systematically investigated the role of Puf4 in the metabolism and virulence of C. neoformans using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), biochemical analysis, and in vivo animal experiments.ResultsColony-spotting assay assays show that Puf4 affects the cell membrane and oxidative stress. RNA-seq analysis revealed that Puf4 was enriched in key metabolic pathways, including carbohydrate metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and glycolysis. Biochemical analysis revealed that Puf4 overexpression led to significant increases in both total carbohydrate and glycogen content. Additionally, the Puf4-overexpressing strain showed elevated ROS levels, and reduced resistance to antimycin A, indicating decreased oxidative stress tolerance. Notably, Puf4 overexpression resulted in reduced capsule size and decreased L-DOPA production, accompanied by downregulated expression of the capsule-associated gene CAP10 and the melanin biosynthesis gene LAC1. In vivo animal experiments further confirmed that the virulence of the Puf4-overexpressing strain was significantly attenuated.DiscussionThese findings suggest that Puf4 may serve as a regulator linking metabolic status and pathogenic potential in C. neoformans, although the underlying mechanisms require further elucidation.

## Morphology and molecular phylogeny of Dothideomycetes fungi associated with Dracaena plants

date: 2025-08-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Dracaena species are widely recognized for their exceptional drought tolerance, making them ideal candidates for sustainable landscaping and ecological restoration in arid regions. Limestone outcrops hosting Dracaena are unique ecosystems characterized by extreme environmental conditions such as nutrient-poor substrates. Thus, they provide valuable opportunities for studying fungal diversity and their adaptations. Despite their ecological importance, knowledge concerning fungal communities associated with limestone-inhabiting Dracaena species remains limited, particularly within the diverse biogeographic contexts of Thailand. Microfungal samples were collected from dead wood and leaves of Dracaena species across seven provinces in Thailand (Chiang Rai, Kanchanaburi, Krabi, Nakhon Si Thammarat, Ratchaburi, Songkhla, and Tak). Fungal taxa were identified and characterized through detailed morphological examinations combined with multi-gene phylogenetic analyses using Actin (act), Internal transcribed spacer (ITS), the large subunit of nuclear ribosomal RNA (LSU), translation elongation fac-tor 1-alpha (tef1-α), and beta-tubulin (tub) gene regions. This study documents eleven fungal taxa isolated from Dracaena substrates, belonging to seven families across five fungal orders. Three new species viz. Cladosporium dracaenae, C. dracaenicola and Torula dracaenae were described, and eight new host records were established (Bipolaris coffeana, Curvularia lunata, Lasiodiplodia bruguierae, L. lignicola, L. thailandica, Longididymella clematidis, Ochroconis musae and Zasmidium citrigriseum). Species de-scriptions, color photographic plates, phylogenetic trees and updated taxonomic notes are provided for all isolated taxa. The findings advance the current understanding of microfungal diversity associated with limestone outcrop habitats and Dracaena species, contributing to broader ecological and conservation efforts. By revealing novel fungal species and previously undocumented host-fungus interactions, this study underscores the rich but underexplored fungal biodiversity of limestone ecosystems in Thailand.

## Comparison of pathogen detection performance between metagenomic next-generation sequencing and conventional culture in organ preservation fluids and recipient wound drainage fluids

date: 2025-08-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundPrompt identification and management of donor-derived infections post-kidney transplantation are critical. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) in detecting pathogens within donor organ preservation fluids and recipient wound drainage fluids, with a comparison made against conventional culture methods.MethodsThis study involved 141 kidney transplant patients (May 1st, 2020 to Jan 31st, 2024). Donor organ preservation fluids and recipient wound drainage fluids were collected and analyzed by mNGS and conventional culture. Pathogen detection differences between mNGS and culture were evaluated. The antibiotic adjustment and infectious complications of the recipients were recorded.ResultsFor organ preservation fluids, the positive rate of convention culture were lower than that of mNGS (24.8% (35/141) vs 47.5% (67/141), p<0.05). For recipient wound drainage fluids, the positivity rate of convention culture were lower than that of mNGS (2.1% (3/141) vs 27.0% (38/141), p<0.05). Compared to traditional culture-based methods, mNGS demonstrated a significantly higher positive detection rate for the combination of ESKAPE pathogens and/or fungi (28.4% (40/141) vs 16.3% (23/141) p< 0.05). Of the pathogens detected through convention culture, mNGS was capable of detecting 79.2% (19/24) of combinations comprising Enterobacteriaceae and non-fermenting bacteria, yet it detected only 22.2% (2/9) of Gram-positive bacteria, and 55.6% (5/9) of fungi. Certain clinically atypical pathogens, mainly Mycobacterium, Clostridium tetanus, and parasites, can solely be detected via mNGS. The rehospitalization rate due to infections was 13.5% (19/141), while the donor-derived infection rate amounted to 2.8% (4/141). Guided by mNGS and bacterial culture results, adjustments were made to antibiotic administration, with no severe vascular complications arising.ConclusionsBy employing mNGS to analyze drainage fluids and organ preservation fluids, highly pathogenic and atypical pathogenic microorganisms can be rapidly identified with high throughput. While limitations exist in detecting fungi and Gram-positive bacteria, mNGS are need to be jointly applied with conventional culture under current conditions.
