<h2 id="asterinas-a-new-linux-compatible-kernel-project">Asterinas: a
new Linux-compatible kernel project</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-23, from: OS News</p>
<p>Asterinas is a new Linux-ABI-compatible kernel project written in
Rust, based on what the authors call a “framekernel architecture”. The
project overlaps somewhat with the goals of the Rust for Linux project,
but approaches the problem space from a different direction by trying to
get the best from both monolithic and microkernel designs. ↫ Ronja
Koistinen at LWN.net Ronja Koistinen has done an outstanding job diving
into this new operating system kernel and approach to kernel
architecture, including its intended focus and goals. Head on over to
the source and read it over there.</p>

<h2 id="the-x-window-system-didnt-immediately-have-x-terminals">The X
Window System didn’t immediately have X terminals</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-23, from: OS News</p>
<p>For a while, X terminals were a reasonably popular way to give people
comparatively inexpensive X desktops. These X terminals relied on X’s
network transparency so that only the X server had to run on the X
terminal itself, with all of your terminal windows and other programs
running on a server somewhere and just displaying on the X terminal. For
a long time, using a big server and a lab full of X terminals was
significantly cheaper than setting up a lab full of actual workstations
(until inexpensive and capable PCs showed up). Given that X started with
network transparency and X terminals are so obvious, you might be
surprised to find out that X didn’t start with them. ↫ Chris Siebenmann
I did indeed assume X terminals were part of the ecosystem from day one,
but it makes sense that it took a while, and that they didn’t enter the
scene until X had established itself as the standard windowing system in
the UNIX world. I’ve been trying to get my hands on specifically the
last HP X terminal, but they’re hard to find and often very expensive.
I’d love to get a taste of a proper networked X environment on real
UNIX, in the way people actually used to use it professionally. As a
sidenote, Siebenmann is doing such an excellent job with these stories
about UNIX, X11, and related matters. He’s like the Raymond Chen of the
UNIX world.</p>

released with systemd</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-23, from: OS News</p>
<p>This is it, the one that adds systemd to postmarketOS! We have talked
about the decision at length on this blog, make sure to read the initial
announcement if this is the first time you are hearing about this. ↫
postmarketOS v25.06 release announcement While adding systemd to
postmarketOS is certainly the tentpole feature of this release, it also
updates the various user interfaces – GNOME’s and KDE’s mobile shells
and applications – and moves to Alpine Linux 3.22 as its base. The
mobile user interfaces for both Firefox and Thunderbird have been
updated as well, there’s a ton of improvements and additions for
individual devices, and a lot more. PostmarketOS, in case you are
unaware, is a Linux distribution optimised for smartphones, focused on
running mobile shells and applications. It’s not ready for prime-time
quite yet, and device support will probably be the biggest hurdle for
anyone wanting to try it out.</p>

<h2 id="youtubes-new-anti-adblock-measures">YouTube’s new anti-adblock
measures</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>Over the past few months, YouTube has been trying another round of
anti-adblock measures. Currently the anti-adblock stuff is being A/B
tested, and one of my accounts is in the experimental group. I wrote a
filter that partially avoids one of the anti-adblock measures, fake
buffering, on uBlock Origin (and Brave browser, since it uses the same
filter rules). (It’s already in the default filter lists, you don’t need
to manually add the filter.) One thing that people have ran into is
“fake buffering”, where videos will take a while to load due to a lot of
buffering, but only at the very start of the video (there’s no mid-video
fake buffering). As I’ll explain, the fake buffering is 80% of the
length of the ads you would’ve seen, so even with fake buffering you’re
still saving time using an adblocker. ↫ iter.ca The battle between
YouTube on one side, and users wanting a non-shitty experience without
paying for YouTube Premium on the other, is unlikely to end any time
soon. Your computer, your rules, so I’m on the side of the people
wanting to block ads on YouTube – the same applies to OSNews if you
don’t want to pay for our ad-free version – but I’m still intrigued to
find out just how far Google is willing to go. I sometimes see YouTube
with ads at other people’s homes. It’s a nightmare.</p>
