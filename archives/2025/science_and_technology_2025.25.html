gets new “blue” screen of death and automated boot recovery</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>The blue screen of death has been such a core part of Windows that’s
it’s become part of humanity’s collective consciousness. They’re not
nearly as common anymore as they used to be back in the Windows 9x and
early Windows XP days, but they do still occasionally when dealing with
broken hardware, shoddy drivers, or other such faults. Well, the blue
screen of death is losing its eponymous blue colour, and will now
clearly mention the stop code and where – in which driver – the kernel
panic occurred. The Windows 11 24H2 release included improvements to
crash dump collection which reduced downtime during an unexpected
restart to about two seconds for most users. We’re introducing a
simplified user interface (UI) that pairs with the shortened experience.
The updated UI improves readability and aligns better with Windows 11
design principles, while preserving the technical information on the
screen for when it is needed. ↫ David Weston at the Windows Blogs This
is part of a new feature in Windows 11 called quick machine recovery, or
QMR. If a Windows PC gets stuck in a boot loop, ending up in the Windows
Recovery Environment, Microsoft can now deploy fixes and remediations
through WinRE. This feature will become available later this year by
default on Windows 11 Home, while on Windows 11 Pro and Enterprise,
administrators can control how this feature works. So far, it seems QMR
is only intended to be used for widespread outages, but I wonder if it
would be possible to eventually use QMR locally. It would be pretty neat
if Microsoft released the server-side component of QMR so individuals
can run and (ab)use it locally for their own machines.</p>

id="microsoft-is-moving-antivirus-providers-out-of-the-windows-kernel">Microsoft
is moving antivirus providers out of the Windows kernel</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-26, from: OS News</p>
<p>It’s been nearly a year since a faulty CrowdStrike update took down
8.5 million Windows-based machines around the world, and Microsoft wants
to ensure such a problem never happens again. After holding a summit
with security vendors last year, Microsoft is poised to release a
private preview of Windows changes that will move antivirus (AV) and
endpoint detection and response (EDR) apps out of the Windows kernel. ↫
Tom Warren at The Verge After the CrowdStrike incident, one of the first
things Microsoft hinted as was moving antivirus and EDR applications out
of the kernel, building an entirely new framework for these applications
instead. The company has been working together with several large
security vendors on these new frameworks and APIs, and it’s now finally
ready to show off this new work to the outside world. Instead of
designing the new frameworks and APIs in-house and just dumping them on
the security vendors, Microsoft requested the security vendors send them
detailed documentation on how they want the new frameworks and APIs to
work. This first preview of the new implementation will be private, and
will allow security vendors to request changes and additional features.
Microsoft states it will take a few iterations before it’s ready for
general availability, and on top of that, security software is only the
first focus of this new effort. It turns out Microsoft wants to move
more stuff out of the kernel, with anti-cheat software – more accurately
described as rootkits, like Riot’s Vanguard – being an obvious next
target. Perhaps this effort could have some beneficial side effects for
gaming on Linux, which you should be doing anyway if you want better
performance, because Windows games seem to perform better on Linux than
they do on Windows.</p>

<p>Jokes aside, this is exciting news. PNG is back to its former glory

Library of Congress, Library and Archives Canada, and the National

current and competitive. After 20 years of stagnation, PNG is back with
renewed vigor! With these titans behind it, the image format is back
with full momentum. Work has already begun on the next two PNG spec
updates. ↫ Chris Blume The new PNG specification update adds proper HDR
support, which is probably its most important new features. Chris Lilly,
one of the original creators of PNG and actively involved in these new
updates as well, has a detailed blog post diving into how HDR in PNG
works. Other changes include officially adding Mozilla’s animated PNG
implementation to PNG, support for EXIF data, and a ton of smaller
changes and cleanups.</p>

grants stay of execution for Windows 10 users: use OneDrive, and get one
additional free year of security updates</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-24, from: OS News</p>
<p>For a while now I’ve been wondering if Microsoft would blink when it
comes to Windows 10’s rapidly approaching end of support date. Only a
few weeks ago, Microsoft at the very least twitched by extending support
for Microsoft Office on Windows 10, which should’ve been an indication
of what was to come. Today, Microsoft actually blinked: regular
consumers wishing to keep using Windows 10 after support ends in October
will now be able to sign up for an additional year of security updates.
Microsoft is making this possible by allowing Windows 10 users to sign
up for the Windows 10 Extended Security Update program for one year of
extended updates, for free. This program is normally only available to
paying enterprise customers, and this marks the first time the company
is letting regular consumers make use of it. The “for free” requires
some serious caveats, though, as depending on how you look at it, it’s
not free at all. You options are to either pay around $30, pay 1000
Microsoft points, or to sign up for the Windows Backup application to
synchronise your settings to Microsoft’s computers (the “cloud”). This
last option is technically free, but not only does the free tier include
just 5GB of online storage, it also makes use of OneDrive, so if you’re
using OneDrive to store your documents and other files you may need to
pay for additional storage. On top of that, anything that requires the
use of OneDrive is simply not “free”, and only allows Microsoft to
further get its claws in you. If Sartre was alive today, Huis clos
would’ve declared “L’enfer, c’est OneDrive” instead. Regardless, it’s
the stay of execution many Windows 10 users have been waiting for, even
if it isn’t entirely perfect. Sure, choosing between an unmaintained
Windows 10, Windows 11, and using OneDrive is about as pleasant as
shoving shards of glass underneath your fingernails, and I have a
feeling quite a few people are about to find out.</p>

id="if-you-want-to-keep-using-kde-and-gnome-youre-going-to-have-to-move-to-wayland">If
you want to keep using KDE and GNOME, you’re going to have to move to
Wayland</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-23, from: OS News</p>
<p>With the transition from X11 to Wayland in full swing, from popular
distributions removing X11 sessions altogether and the two major desktop
environments planning for the removal of X11 support as well, there’s a
ton of questions people are dealing with. Both the KDE and GNOME project
published detailed blog posts about the matter. First, KDE’s Nathan
Graham makes it very clear that KDE Plasma’s X11 sessions continues to
be maintained. This means KDE Plasma will continue to work on X11, major
bugs in the session (e.g. can’t log in) will be fixed, and really bad
regressions in the session may eventually be fixed. That being said,
minor bugs will probably not be fixed unless someone pays for it, and
new features in the X11 session will not happen at all, unless someone
pays for it. KDE currently has no time frame for when X11 support will
be dropped from KDE Plasma, and Graham doesn’t expect it to happen
within the next two years. The KDE project maintains a list of known
significant issues with KDE Plasma on Wayland, and KDE plans on
addressing everything on that list before removing X11 support. Graham
notes that in the end, dropping X11 support from KDE Plasma is mostly up
to distributions, as it wouldn’t make any sense to drop it if
distributions aren’t on board. At the moment, about 70-80% of KDE Plasma
users are using Wayland, he notes. On the GNOME side of things, Jordan
Petridis also detailed GNOME’s position on Wayland and X11. GNOME will
be disabling the X11 session in GNOME 49, with a full removal of the X11
code in GNOME 50. This won’t break any X11 applications (on either GNOME
or KDE), since even if they don’t have a Wayland backend, they’ll run
just fine using XWayland, which is an X server running on top of
Wayland. XWayland isn’t going anywhere any time soon. According to
Petridis, the Wayland session is as functional as the X11 session, and
“in plenty of cases a lot more capable and efficient”. He further adds
that “there’s some niche workflows that are only possible on X11, but
there isn’t any functionality regression”. Basically, if you’re using
your spacebar as a heater, you might run into problems. As for
accessibility, Wayland is actually doing pretty great. There has been a
lot of concerned trolling and misinformation specifically around this
topic sadly from people that don’t care about it and have been abusing
the discourse as a straw man argument. Drowning all the people that rely
on it and need to be heard. Thankfully Aaron of fireborn fame wrote
recently a blogpost talking about all this in detail and clearing up
misconceptions. ↫ Jordan Petridis Finally, Petridis summarises why the
Linux desktop world is moving to Wayland: No, the Xorg Server is still
very much maintained, however its development is halted. It still
receives occasional bugfixes and there are timely security releases when
needed. The common sentiment, shared among Xorg, Graphics, Kernel,
Platform and Application developers is that any future development is a
dead-end and shortcomings can’t be addressed without breaking X11.
That’s why the majority of Xorg developers moved on to make a new,
separate, thing: Wayland. ↫ Jordan Petridis This pill is so hard to
swallow for some people that they go full bananas and start seeing red
hats and Illuminati symbols everywhere, losing their minds and spiraling
deep into ludicrous conspiracy theories. The truth of the matter is,
however, blatantly banal: the people developing X.org realised long ago
that meaningfully improving it would irrevocably break it, and as such
they developed something new so they wouldn’t have to break X11. That’s
it. X.org will continue to exist and live on in its maintained state,
and desktops relying on it will continue to function. If you want to
keep using GNOME and KDE, though, you’ll have to drop X11, because the
kinds of features and improvements these desktops want to deliver are
not possible without breaking X11. Would you want an X11 that’s broken
for everyone, or an X11 that keeps working as-is, while those that want
to move on do so somewhere else?</p>

new Linux-compatible kernel project</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-23, from: OS News</p>
<p>Asterinas is a new Linux-ABI-compatible kernel project written in
Rust, based on what the authors call a “framekernel architecture”. The
project overlaps somewhat with the goals of the Rust for Linux project,
but approaches the problem space from a different direction by trying to
get the best from both monolithic and microkernel designs. ↫ Ronja
Koistinen at LWN.net Ronja Koistinen has done an outstanding job diving
into this new operating system kernel and approach to kernel
architecture, including its intended focus and goals. Head on over to
the source and read it over there.</p>

<h2 id="the-x-window-system-didnt-immediately-have-x-terminals">The X
Window System didn’t immediately have X terminals</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-23, from: OS News</p>
<p>For a while, X terminals were a reasonably popular way to give people
comparatively inexpensive X desktops. These X terminals relied on X’s
network transparency so that only the X server had to run on the X
terminal itself, with all of your terminal windows and other programs
running on a server somewhere and just displaying on the X terminal. For
a long time, using a big server and a lab full of X terminals was
significantly cheaper than setting up a lab full of actual workstations
(until inexpensive and capable PCs showed up). Given that X started with
network transparency and X terminals are so obvious, you might be
surprised to find out that X didn’t start with them. ↫ Chris Siebenmann
I did indeed assume X terminals were part of the ecosystem from day one,
but it makes sense that it took a while, and that they didn’t enter the
scene until X had established itself as the standard windowing system in
the UNIX world. I’ve been trying to get my hands on specifically the
last HP X terminal, but they’re hard to find and often very expensive.
I’d love to get a taste of a proper networked X environment on real
UNIX, in the way people actually used to use it professionally. As a
sidenote, Siebenmann is doing such an excellent job with these stories
about UNIX, X11, and related matters. He’s like the Raymond Chen of the
UNIX world.</p>

<p>date: 2025-06-23, from: OS News</p>
<p>This is it, the one that adds systemd to postmarketOS! We have talked
about the decision at length on this blog, make sure to read the initial
announcement if this is the first time you are hearing about this. ↫
postmarketOS v25.06 release announcement While adding systemd to
postmarketOS is certainly the tentpole feature of this release, it also
updates the various user interfaces – GNOME’s and KDE’s mobile shells
and applications – and moves to Alpine Linux 3.22 as its base. The
mobile user interfaces for both Firefox and Thunderbird have been
updated as well, there’s a ton of improvements and additions for
individual devices, and a lot more. PostmarketOS, in case you are
unaware, is a Linux distribution optimised for smartphones, focused on
running mobile shells and applications. It’s not ready for prime-time
quite yet, and device support will probably be the biggest hurdle for
anyone wanting to try it out.</p>

<h2 id="youtubes-new-anti-adblock-measures">YouTube’s new anti-adblock
measures</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>Over the past few months, YouTube has been trying another round of
anti-adblock measures. Currently the anti-adblock stuff is being A/B
tested, and one of my accounts is in the experimental group. I wrote a
filter that partially avoids one of the anti-adblock measures, fake
buffering, on uBlock Origin (and Brave browser, since it uses the same
filter rules). (It’s already in the default filter lists, you don’t need
to manually add the filter.) One thing that people have ran into is
“fake buffering”, where videos will take a while to load due to a lot of
buffering, but only at the very start of the video (there’s no mid-video
fake buffering). As I’ll explain, the fake buffering is 80% of the
length of the ads you would’ve seen, so even with fake buffering you’re
still saving time using an adblocker. ↫ iter.ca The battle between
YouTube on one side, and users wanting a non-shitty experience without
paying for YouTube Premium on the other, is unlikely to end any time
soon. Your computer, your rules, so I’m on the side of the people
wanting to block ads on YouTube – the same applies to OSNews if you
don’t want to pay for our ad-free version – but I’m still intrigued to
find out just how far Google is willing to go. I sometimes see YouTube
with ads at other people’s homes. It’s a nightmare.</p>
