<h2 id="youtubes-new-anti-adblock-measures">YouTube’s new anti-adblock
measures</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>Over the past few months, YouTube has been trying another round of
anti-adblock measures. Currently the anti-adblock stuff is being A/B
tested, and one of my accounts is in the experimental group. I wrote a
filter that partially avoids one of the anti-adblock measures, fake
buffering, on uBlock Origin (and Brave browser, since it uses the same
filter rules). (It’s already in the default filter lists, you don’t need
to manually add the filter.) One thing that people have ran into is
“fake buffering”, where videos will take a while to load due to a lot of
buffering, but only at the very start of the video (there’s no mid-video
fake buffering). As I’ll explain, the fake buffering is 80% of the
length of the ads you would’ve seen, so even with fake buffering you’re
still saving time using an adblocker. ↫ iter.ca The battle between
YouTube on one side, and users wanting a non-shitty experience without
paying for YouTube Premium on the other, is unlikely to end any time
soon. Your computer, your rules, so I’m on the side of the people
wanting to block ads on YouTube – the same applies to OSNews if you
don’t want to pay for our ad-free version – but I’m still intrigued to
find out just how far Google is willing to go. I sometimes see YouTube
with ads at other people’s homes. It’s a nightmare.</p>
