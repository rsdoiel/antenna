**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-04-16, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

<a href="http://scripting.com/2025/03/26/154836.html">Join a Parade Today</a>. When people talk about What You Can Do on podcasts or on TV, they say lame things that don't work that well. One thing for sure is that when Bernie and Alexandria do a rally in your area, you can go and enjoy the energy. This is a good thing because it gives the TV cameras something to focus on. But here's what I think the best thing to do is. Don't start something, join something. Because two is way more powerful than one, and three is way more powerful than two. When people work together on something good, more people doing it is usually even better.

As someone curating a newsletter and dabbling in AI, I am feeling both overwhelmed and bored with news about yet another AI model being released by Company XYZ that will be a &#8220;game changer&#8221; and &#8220;leaves the others in the dust&#8221;. It feels hard to guess what I should be excited about. The size of [&#8230;]

## CVE Program Almost Unfunded

date: 2025-04-16, updated: 2025-04-16, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Mitre&#8217;s CVE&#8217;s program&#8212;which provides common naming and other informational resources about cybersecurity vulnerabilities&#8212;was about to <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3963190/cve-program-faces-swift-end-after-dhs-fails-to-renew-contract-leaving-security-flaw-tracking-in-limbo.html">be cancelled</a>, as the US Department of Homeland Security failed to renew the contact. It was funded for eleven more months at the last minute.</p>
<p>This is a big deal. The CVE program is one of those pieces of common infrastructure that everyone benefits from. Losing it will bring us back to a world where there&#8217;s no single way to talk about vulnerabilities. It&#8217;s kind of crazy to think that the US government might damage its own security in this way&#8212;but I suppose no crazier than any of the other ways the US is working against its own interests right now...</p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-04-15, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

Looking for help from people who know how to create WordPress themes. The goal is to create a default theme that works well for <a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a>-authored sites. It was suggested I try the <a href="https://wordpress.com/theme/retrospect?tab_filter=blog">Retrospect theme</a>, and it does <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/04/15/siteshot.png">look</a> quite nice when I <a href="https://github.com/scripting/wordlandSupport/issues/54#issuecomment-2807218882">switched over</a> the <a href="https://daveverse.wordpress.com/2025/04/15/this-is-not-the-america-we-grew-up-in/">daveverse site</a> to use it. Is it possible to fork a WordPress theme? If so, here's a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/wordlandSupport/issues/54#issuecomment-2807241008">list of changes</a> I'd like in a new theme.

## It's easier than ever to de-censor videos

date: 2025-04-15, from: Jeff Geerling blog

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">It's easier than ever to de-censor videos</span>

            <p>Last month I asked people to <a href="https://youtu.be/gaV-O6NPWrI?t=297">hack part of my YouTube video</a>, specifically to de-pixelate the contents of a folder I had pixelated starting at the 4:57 mark.</p>



  
  Your browser does not support the video tag.



<p>For years, people have used the censor tool to blur or pixelate out parts of videos where there's sensitive information. And for years, every time I've used it, I get a few comments from people saying that's not a safe way to censor information.</p>

<p>So is that true?</p>

<p>I wanted to find out, so I put a message saying I'd send fifty bucks to anyone who could tell me what it said under the pixelation. And you know what? Less than a day later, <em>three</em> people solved it, using three slightly different techniques—scary!</p>

<p>This blog post is a lightly edited transcript of the following video:</p>

Last Tuesday Cliff Lynch delivered an abbreviated version of his traditional closing summary and <i>bon voyage</i> to CNI's <a href="https://www.cni.org/events/membership-meetings/past-meetings/spring-2025">2025 Spring Membership Meeting</a> via Zoom from his sick-bed. Last Thursday night he died, still serving as Executive Director. CNI has posted <a href="https://www.cni.org/news/in-memoriam-clifford-lynch"><i>In Memoriam: Clifford Lynch</i></a>.<br />
<br />
Cliff impacted a wide range of areas. The best overview is <a href="http://blogs.loc.gov/digitalpreservation/2013/05/digital-preservation-pioneer-clifford-lynch/">Mike Ashenfelder's 2013 profile of Cliff Lynch</a> in the Library of Congress' <i>Digital Preservation Pioneer</i> series, which starts:<br />
<blockquote>
Clifford Lynch is widely regarded as an oracle in the culture of networked information. Lynch monitors the global information ecosystem for cultural trends and technological developments. He ponders their variables, interdependencies and influencing factors. He confers with colleagues and draws conclusions. Then he reports his observations through lectures, conference presentations and writings. People who know about Lynch pay close attention to what he has to say.<br />
<br />
Lynch is a soft-spoken man whose work, for more than thirty years, has had an impact — directly or indirectly — on the computer, information and library science communities.
</blockquote>
Below the fold are some additional personal notes on Cliff's contributions.<br />
<span><a name='more'></a></span>
<br />
Ashenfelder notes Cliff's focus on collaboration:<br />
<blockquote>
Lynch is also a catalyst for action. He helps steer the conversation toward real results, such as standards creation, funding, tool development, metadata creation and interoperability. Ultimately, Lynch seems most fervent about collaboration as a crucial force.<br />
<br />
“I would be reluctant to attribute much of anything just to my actions,” he said. “Most important successes come through the work of a lot of different people, collaborating and pulling it together. Maybe I can think of a place or two where there was a meeting that I spoke at or convened or I wrote or did something that just happened to fall at a pivotal moment. But any of that to me feels a bit accidental, at best just good luck, being in the right place at the right time.”
</blockquote>
Michael Nelson and Herbert Van de Sompel's <a href="https://ws-dl.blogspot.com/2025/04/cliff-lynch-invisible-influencer-in.html"><i>Cliff Lynch: The Invisible Influencer in Information Infrastructure</i></a> provides an in-depth account of one occasion when Cliff was "in the right place at the right time" to spark a collaboration. The occasion was an October 1999 meeting in Santa Fe:<br />
<blockquote>
In order to further optimize the chances of success for the meeting, the collaboration of Cliff Lynch and Don Waters as moderators had been secured and turned out to be fundamentally important. In the Acknowledgments section of his <a href="https://hdl.handle.net/1854/LU-522209">PhD thesis</a>, Herbert put Cliff’s impact on the direction of the meeting and on his own thinking as follows:<br />
<blockquote>
When starting to work on this thesis, I went back reading several of his early papers and could not feel other than intimidated by the far forward-looking vision expressed therein. At several occasions, I heard Cliff address large audiences, discussing complicated digital library matters with an amazing clarity. Cliff's work has always been a great inspiration to me. I met Cliff for the first time in person at the Open Archives meeting in Santa Fe, for which he had enthusiastically accepted my invitation to serve as a moderator. His involvement was crucial to the successful conclusion of the meeting.
</blockquote>
...<br />
Prior to the start of the second day, he vented his frustration about the lack of progress to Cliff, who was about to start moderating the first session. Cliff was nice enough to let him ramble on a bit, and, in a manner that exemplified one of Cliff’s many unparalleled capabilities, he went on to open the meeting by providing two discussion topics regarding interoperability that he somehow had been able to synthesize from the first day’s discussions, which most had experienced as enjoyable yet lacking in any sense of concrete direction. One was whether archive functions, such as data collection and maintenance, should be decoupled from user functions, such as search. The other was about the choice between distributed searching across repositories and harvesting from them to build cross-repository search engines.

The meeting solidified the long and productive collaboration between Van de Sompel and Nelson.<br />
<br />
But easily the best way to understand how Cliff worked is the <a href="http://www.educopia.org/sites/educopia.org/files/ANADP_Educopia_2012.pdf"><i>Report of ANADP I</i></a> from 13 years ago.  Cliff's "Closing Thoughts" are transcribed verbatim starting on page 309, and they are a wonderful example of his ability to summarize a meeting and set the agenda for future work with an extemporaneous address. You have to read all twelve pages — it is hard to summarize Cliff's summary, but here are a couple of gems:<br />
<blockquote>
With a portfolio of aligned strategies, we can collectively speak more effectively about the importance of the work we do, and certainly that has come up in a background way again and again as we’ve spoken about economics, education, about legal issues and barriers. I think that this question of really clarifying the fundamental importance of digital preservation to maintaining the cultural and intellectual record, the memory of our nations and of the world, has got to be a central objective. We have a great challenge in educating both the broad public in our nations and the governments that represent these publics; to the extent that we can align strategies we can make that case better.
</blockquote>
And:
<blockquote>
There are two words that I didn’t hear in the technical discussions. I get very scared whenever I hear a lengthy discussion of technical issues in digital preservation that doesn’t mention these two words. The first is <i>Monoculture</i>. There is a possibility, a danger, of doing too much alignment here. The reason for that is the second word that I didn’t hear, which is <i>Hubris</i>. We need to acknowledge that we don’t really know how to do long-term digital preservation. We’re going to have a lot more confidence that we know what we’re doing here about a hundred years from now as we look at what efforts actually brought data successfully a hundred years into the future. But in the relatively early stages of technologies like these, it’s much easier to identify failures than long-term successes.
</blockquote>
From <a href="https://www.cni.org/news/in-memoriam-clifford-lynch">CNI's <i>In Memoriam</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Active on many advisory boards and visiting committees throughout his career, including serving as co-chair of the National Academies Board on Research Data and Information (BRDI) from 2011-16, Lynch’s contributions were recognized with numerous awards, including the American Library Association’s Joseph W. Lippincott Award, the American Society for Information Science and Technology’s Award of Merit, and the EDUCAUSE Leadership Award in Public Policy and Practice. He was a past president of the American Society for Information Science, and a fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the National Information Standards Organization.

</ul>
Cliff made a very valuable contribution to my career by inviting me to debug important talks before I gave them "for real" by giving early versions to the the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250315013526/https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/events/ias">Information Access Seminar</a> at U.C. Berkeley's <a href="https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/">School of Information</a>. Fortified by tea and cookies, I could talk and then be subject to detailed and insightful questioning by Cliff and the participants. I always meant to take notes during the questioning but I was so into it I never did. I had to re-construct the necessary changes to the talk from memory.<br />

A few days ago I <a href="https://mastodon.social/@dave@social.masto.land/114335522071398061">wrote</a>: ChatGPT is to Google what Google was to library card catalogs. The great thing about Google when it was first out was that unlike previous search products, they searched everything, including our blogs, and that opened up knowledge to us that had been previously, for all of our history as a species, not accessible. And LLMs are similarly revolutionary. I'm doing much better, deeper work, with great results for my users, than I could have accomplished with the network defined by Google.

<p>I got a <a href="https://mastodon.social/@dave@social.masto.land/114341684650193975">chance</a> to explain.</p>
<p>The great thing about Google when it was first out was that unlike previous search products, they searched everything, including our blogs, and that opened up knowledge to us that had been previously, for all of our history as a species, not accessible.</p>
<p>And LLMs are similarly revolutionary. I'm doing much better, deeper work, with great results for my users, than I could ever have accomplished with the system defined by Google. and for crying out loud it's not natural language search, all that tells me is you haven't bothered to use the freaking products before having a cynical opinion about them.</p>

It would be as sacred as academic freedom is in the university, or the First Amendment of the Constitution. It seemed to me that a university is the perfect place to create something like this. If we had such a setup, anywhere, at this time -- we would be working in earnest on an open alternative to twitter, one that is truly billionaire-proof right now, as opposed to "would be nice to have sometime in the future."

## What is Inbound RSS?

date: 2025-04-14, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I wrote a complex piece here earlier, but it's much simpler than it made it sound, so I decided to start again.</p>
<p>Feed readers view RSS as inbound, and blogging tools regard it as outbound. Same feed, different contexts. Like trains going in and out of a station. Inbound and outbound. </p>
<p>But some software views RSS in both directions. The best example is Twitter and its successors such as Mastodon, Threads and Bluesky. These products are for both for reading and writing. It makes sense to have outbound feeds, like a blogging tool, and it makes just as much sense as a consumer of feeds, like a feed reader, so we can easily publish stuff from other environments and people can subscribe to them exactly as if they used their editor to write it. No reason anyone needs to know. <i>This is absolutely the simplest and most web-like way to do federation. </i>And you don't need any new formats or protocols. It's all <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> on both sides. We totally know how to do RSS. It's ready to go. </p>
<p>What got me thinking about this a few years ago was Substack. I wanted to publish a nightly email newsletter from what I had posted that day on my blog, but I didn't have the patience to copy and paste and then reformat the text, by hand, when I already have that automated. They wanted to turn me into a computer. I tried that with Medium for a couple of years and it was awful. No thanks. What I needed them to have support Inbound RSS. </p>
<p>That's it. You now know all there is to know about <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22Inbound%20RSS%22">Inbound RSS</a>. 😀 </p>

## China Sort of Admits to Being Behind Volt Typhoon

<p><i>The Wall Street Journal</i> has the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/in-secret-meeting-china-acknowledged-role-in-u-s-infrastructure-hacks-c5ab37cb?st=UfFBTh&#038;reflink=article_copyURL_share">story</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Chinese officials acknowledged in a secret December meeting that Beijing was behind a widespread series of alarming cyberattacks on U.S. infrastructure, according to people familiar with the matter, underscoring how hostilities between the two superpowers are continuing to escalate.</p>
<p>The Chinese delegation linked years of intrusions into computer networks at U.S. ports, water utilities, airports and other targets, to increasing U.S. policy support for Taiwan, the people, who declined to be named, said.</p></blockquote>

## Blogs are personal infrastructure

Nice reflection on blogs today from Jay: A blog in 2025 should be a destination. They don’t just distribute—they accumulate. They hold time, build presence and concretise thought.

Their story says they know they need to be replaceable. But until they deliver on replaceability, it's a 5-alarm fire because of what happened with Twitter. It should not have been possible to acquire Twitter's user base. In hindsight we know it could have been avoided. And it can be avoided by Bluesky, but my guess is the last thing they want is to be replaced. If they really meant it, we could make it happen in a few weeks, and then we could build some really incredible systems, starting in late May, early June. I really believe that. Next journalist that interviews them should ask about this. Thanks for listening.

## 2025-04-04 Aufsteigende Rüstungsklasse

date: 2025-04-13, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-04-04-aufsteigende-rüstungsklasse">2025-04-04 Aufsteigende Rüstungsklasse</h1>

<p>Ich hatte schon vor einiger Zeit angefangen, über einen Wechsel zur aufsteigenden Rüstungsklasse nachzudenken. Neue Spieler fanden die traditionelle, absteigende Rüstungsklasse meistens doof. Die Leute, mit denen ich schon spielte, hatten sich an die absteigende Rüstungsklasse gewöhnt und wollten nicht umsteigen. Was tun? Mir gefällt die Absteigende Rüstungsklasse und die kleine Tabelle, wo man sich aufschreibt, welche Rüstungsklasse welchen Wurf benötigt, oder die seltsame Notation aus AD&amp;D Zeiten mit dem ETW0 (Engl. THAC0).</p>

<p>Irgendwann hatte ich mich halb durchgerungen, einen Versuch zu starten. Positiv aufgefallen ist sofort, dass die Tabellen im Handbuch für die Spielenden kompakter werden. Auf den Charakterbögen hat es nun auch etwas mehr Platz. Beides finde ich sehr positiv.</p>

<p>Eher unangenehm war, dass in allen anderen Dokumenten immer noch absteigende Rüstungsklassen zu finden war. Oje! Mit dem aktuellen Update hoffe ich, sie alle gefunden zu haben. Und wer ansonsten eine Rüstungsklasse unter 10 findet, konvertiert wie folgt:</p>

<ul>
<li>Für Menschen ohne Rüstung wird RK 9 zu RK 10.</li>
<li>Für alle anderen ist die aufsteigende Rüstungsklasse = 20 minus die absteigende Rüstungsklasse.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beispielsweise: Ork mit RK 6 wird zu Ork mit RK 14.</p>

<p>Warum nicht &ldquo;19 minus die absteigende Rüstungsklasse&rdquo;? Nun ist alles um eins besser geschützt, würde man meinen. Der Vorteil ist aber, dass es nun zu neueren D&amp;D Versionen passt. Wenn ich beispielsweise bei D&amp;D 3.5 reinschaue:</p>

<p>Krieger mit Stufe 1 hat einen Angriffsbonus von +1 (gleich wie die Stufe, was mir sehr gefällt). Die Rüstungen sind: beschlagene Lederrüstung 13 (20-7); Kettenpanzer 15 (20-5); Plattenpanzer 17 (20-3). Aus dem Rahmen fällt &ldquo;ohne Rüstung&rdquo;, denn 10 ist nicht 20-9. Tja… Dafür habe ich keine Lösung. RK 11 für Leute ohne Rüstung gefällt mir auch nicht.</p>

<p>Und was ist mit den Trefferchancen? Vorher benötigte ein Krieger Stufe 1 eine 13 um einen Ork mit RK 6 zu treffen. Jetzt hat der Krieger einen Bonus von +1 um eine Ork mit RK 14 (20-6) zu treffen und braucht also immer noch eine 13. Insofern ist also alles gleich geblieben.</p>

<p>Neue Versionen:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/pdfs/Hellebarden-und-Helme.pdf">Hellebarden &amp; Helme</a>, Regeln</li>
<li><a href="/pdfs/rauchberg/Rauchberg.pdf">Rauchberg</a>, ein Megadungeon</li>

Developers: <a href="https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/api/">This is the WordPress API</a>. Compare it to AT Proto and ActivityPub. It's got a lot of advantages. It does the basics of social media. It scales, is mature, stable, and well-managed. A stronger, stable, more broad and better foundation imho to build on than the others.
