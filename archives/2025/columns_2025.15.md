## What is Inbound RSS?

date: 2025-04-14, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>A question on a <a href="https://www.manton.org/2025/04/13/rob-fahrni-blogs-more-thoughts.html">thread</a> on Manton's micro.blog site wishing to know what Inbound RSS is. Here's an edited version of my response.  </p>
<p>It looks like the first time I used the <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22Inbound%20RSS%22">term</a> on my blog was in 2022, when I was <a href="http://scripting.com/2022/03/14.html#a132511">explaining</a> how I was thinking, in 2017, about using Substack to do email distribution of my blog. I asked if I could use <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> to feed my writing into Substack, instead of having to copy/paste it from where I wrote it. They apparently didn’t read the question and they told me about how Substack supports the outbound variety of RSS. It was at that point that I realized there needed to be a distinction between inbound and outbound RSS.</p>
<p>I thought it was pretty straightforward and almost self-explanatory. Feed readers view RSS as inbound, and blogging tools regard it as outbound. Same feed, in different contexts. Like trains going in and out of a station. They come in, they go out. Inbound and outbound. </p>
<p>But sometimes you want a feed reader to generate RSS feeds as <a href="https://feedland.com/">FeedLand</a> does, and sometimes you want blogging software to handle inbound feeds, thus acting a bit like a feed reader. As Manton points out, <a href="http://scripting.com/2022/10/13/133536.html?title=substackVsMicroblog#a133533">micro.blog</a> does this.</p>
<p>Now it makes total sense to me and I think it will make sense to everyone else pretty soon that twitter-like systems which are starting to support outbound RSS would also support inbound.</p>
<p>The reason this is a good thing as in the case of Substack, is that I can use the writing tools I like best to publish through Substack. In fact I wasn’t willing to do the copy/paste thing, I had tried it with Medium and I hated it. It turned me into a piece of software. I have spent a considerable portion of my career working on APIs that get software to take their input from anywhere, not just from their own often pretty shitty editors. But, apparently, Substack doesn’t want you using someone else’s editor, because that’s where a good portion of their lock-in comes from. And I suspect we’ll encounter resistance to the idea from Bluesky because despite their <a href="https://this.how/bluesky/">hype</a> about the wonders of AT Proto, they really want you living in their environment and not posting to it from outside, so they benefit by making it hard to do so, while as it has been pointed out, their APIs make it possible to do it anyway. It’s the friction and complexity and fragility that helps keep them from being replaced. If they realllly believed in the open web, they would imho jump at the opportunity to support inbound RSS.</p>
<p>Here's a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/issues/19">thread</a> if you have questions about Inbound RSS.</p>
<p>PS: I had a <a href="https://claude.ai/share/33a0a2cf-7e3c-4a66-bdda-66e695b8177e">conversation</a> with Claude.ai about inbound RSS. It had not heard of the term, so I gave it some pointers and it was able to explain it in more detail than I have here. Remarkable tools. Every day I read misinformed stories about AI software that thinks it's just used for students to cheat on their homework or (recently) by politicians to create policy for them. Yeah I suppose people had similar arguments against search engines, though I don't recall, but I do remember as a freshman in college it being controversial for students to bring a calculator into a chemistry exam. Today it seems ridiculous for a human to take a chemistry test that actually tests their ability to do arithmetic! Pick your battles. </p>

## China Sort of Admits to Being Behind Volt Typhoon

<blockquote><p>Chinese officials acknowledged in a secret December meeting that Beijing was behind a widespread series of alarming cyberattacks on U.S. infrastructure, according to people familiar with the matter, underscoring how hostilities between the two superpowers are continuing to escalate.</p>
<p>The Chinese delegation linked years of intrusions into computer networks at U.S. ports, water utilities, airports and other targets, to increasing U.S. policy support for Taiwan, the people, who declined to be named, said.</p></blockquote>

## Blogs are personal infrastructure

Nice reflection on blogs today from Jay: A blog in 2025 should be a destination. They don’t just distribute—they accumulate. They hold time, build presence and concretise thought.

Their story says they know they need to be replaceable. But until they deliver on replaceability, it's a 5-alarm fire because of what happened with Twitter. It should not have been possible to acquire Twitter's user base. In hindsight we know it could have been avoided. And it can be avoided by Bluesky, but my guess is the last thing they want is to be replaced. If they really meant it, we could make it happen in a few weeks, and then we could build some really incredible systems, starting in late May, early June. I really believe that. Next journalist that interviews them should ask about this. Thanks for listening.

## 2025-04-04 Aufsteigende Rüstungsklasse

date: 2025-04-13, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-04-04-aufsteigende-rüstungsklasse">2025-04-04 Aufsteigende Rüstungsklasse</h1>

<p>Ich hatte schon vor einiger Zeit angefangen, über einen Wechsel zur aufsteigenden Rüstungsklasse nachzudenken. Neue Spieler fanden die traditionelle, absteigende Rüstungsklasse meistens doof. Die Leute, mit denen ich schon spielte, hatten sich an die absteigende Rüstungsklasse gewöhnt und wollten nicht umsteigen. Was tun? Mir gefällt die Absteigende Rüstungsklasse und die kleine Tabelle, wo man sich aufschreibt, welche Rüstungsklasse welchen Wurf benötigt, oder die seltsame Notation aus AD&amp;D Zeiten mit dem ETW0 (Engl. THAC0).</p>

<p>Irgendwann hatte ich mich halb durchgerungen, einen Versuch zu starten. Positiv aufgefallen ist sofort, dass die Tabellen im Handbuch für die Spielenden kompakter werden. Auf den Charakterbögen hat es nun auch etwas mehr Platz. Beides finde ich sehr positiv.</p>

<p>Eher unangenehm war, dass in allen anderen Dokumenten immer noch absteigende Rüstungsklassen zu finden war. Oje! Mit dem aktuellen Update hoffe ich, sie alle gefunden zu haben. Und wer ansonsten eine Rüstungsklasse unter 10 findet, konvertiert wie folgt:</p>

<ul>
<li>Für Menschen ohne Rüstung wird RK 9 zu RK 10.</li>
<li>Für alle anderen ist die aufsteigende Rüstungsklasse = 20 minus die absteigende Rüstungsklasse.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beispielsweise: Ork mit RK 6 wird zu Ork mit RK 14.</p>

<p>Warum nicht &ldquo;19 minus die absteigende Rüstungsklasse&rdquo;? Nun ist alles um eins besser geschützt, würde man meinen. Der Vorteil ist aber, dass es nun zu neueren D&amp;D Versionen passt. Wenn ich beispielsweise bei D&amp;D 3.5 reinschaue:</p>

<p>Krieger mit Stufe 1 hat einen Angriffsbonus von +1 (gleich wie die Stufe, was mir sehr gefällt). Die Rüstungen sind: beschlagene Lederrüstung 13 (20-7); Kettenpanzer 15 (20-5); Plattenpanzer 17 (20-3). Aus dem Rahmen fällt &ldquo;ohne Rüstung&rdquo;, denn 10 ist nicht 20-9. Tja… Dafür habe ich keine Lösung. RK 11 für Leute ohne Rüstung gefällt mir auch nicht.</p>

<p>Und was ist mit den Trefferchancen? Vorher benötigte ein Krieger Stufe 1 eine 13 um einen Ork mit RK 6 zu treffen. Jetzt hat der Krieger einen Bonus von +1 um eine Ork mit RK 14 (20-6) zu treffen und braucht also immer noch eine 13. Insofern ist also alles gleich geblieben.</p>

<p>Neue Versionen:</p>

Developers: <a href="https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/api/">This is the WordPress API</a>. Compare it to AT Proto and ActivityPub. It's got a lot of advantages. It does the basics of social media. It scales, is mature, stable, and well-managed. A stronger, stable, more broad and better foundation imho to build on than the others.
