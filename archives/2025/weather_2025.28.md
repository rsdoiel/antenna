Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0735 AM CDT Mon Jul 14 2025

Valid 141300Z - 151200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE NORTHERN PLAINS...EAST...MID-SOUTH...AND SOUTHEAST ARIZONA...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms are possible across parts of
the northern Plains, East, Mid-South, and southeast Arizona this
afternoon into tonight.

...Northern Plains to Northern Minnesota...
As an upper trough digs southward from British Columbia to the
northern Rockies today, a belt of enhanced mid-level westerlies will
extend along/near the international border from MT to MN. At the
surface, a front should also extend generally west-east across this
region, displaced slightly south of the mid-level jet. The western
portion of this front (across MT/ND) is forecast to move southward
tonight as a surface low gradually develops/consolidates near the
MT/ND/SD border.

Forcing for ascent will remain weak for much of the day as mid-level
heights remain neutral. Still, high-based convection may develop
across the northern Rockies and adjacent High Plains by this
afternoon/evening. With steep low/mid-level lapse rates and modest
westerly mid-level flow present, some of these thunderstorms could
pose an isolated threat for severe winds/hail as they move eastward
through the evening. The potential for surface-based convection to
develop in proximity to the front remains unclear. A conditionally
favorable environment for severe thunderstorms will exist near the
front, but weak forcing and increasing MLCIN/warmer temperatures
aloft with southward extent cast considerable uncertainty regarding
overall thunderstorm coverage this afternoon/evening. A better
chance exists for elevated thunderstorms to occur tonight as the
upper trough overspreads the northern Rockies. This activity could
pose an isolated threat for mainly severe hail given ample MUCAPE
and strong shear forecast in the cloud-bearing layer.

...Eastern States...
As a weak mid-level shortwave trough moves eastward from the OH
Valley across the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast today, scattered to
numerous thunderstorms are expected to initially develop across the
higher terrain of these regions. While mid-level flow and related
deep-layer shear are both expected to remain fairly modest, some of
this convection could congeal into multiple loosely organized
clusters. With daytime heating of a moist low-level airmass,
moderate instability should develop across the lower terrain east of
the Blue Ridge/Appalachians. Modestly steepened low-level lapse
rates should also aid in some enhancement to convective downdrafts,
with isolated strong to damaging winds possible as thunderstorms
spread generally eastward through the afternoon and evening.

Farther south across parts of FL and southeast GA, convection should
develop along/near the Atlantic Coast before spreading
south-southwestward and inland across much of the FL Peninsula this
afternoon/evening. This activity will be associated with a weak
low/mid-level trough currently off the FL Atlantic Coast. While
low-level and deep-layer shear are both forecast to remain modest,
some enhancement to mid/upper-level north-northeasterlies could
promote multiple clusters capable of producing isolated strong to
severe winds given moderate to locally strong instability.

...Mid-South...
A remnant MCV will drift east-northeastward today over the Mid-South
and vicinity while gradually weakening. Modest enhancement to the
low/mid-level flow attendant to this feature could support an
isolated damaging wind threat with convection that develops this
afternoon. But, with deep-layer shear expected to remain weak, the
overall severe threat will likely remain quite isolated/marginal.

...Arizona...
A mid-level anticyclone will remain anchored over the southern Great
Basin today. On the periphery of this anticyclone, around 20-25 kt
of northeasterly mid-level flow may aid thunderstorms that develop
over the higher terrain of southeast AZ/southwest NM in moving
southwestward this afternoon/evening across lower elevations. A very
deeply mixed boundary layer may support isolated severe wind gusts
with this activity, even though instability and deep-layer shear
will likely remain weak.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0329 AM CDT Mon Jul 14 2025

Valid 171200Z - 221200Z

...DISCUSSION...
Upper ridging will build across the south-central and southeastern
U.S. during the Day 4-8 period. This will confine a series of
low-amplitude upper troughs to the northern tier of the U.S. along
the international border. Bouts of strong to severe thunderstorm
potential will be possible through the period as individual
shortwaves provide modestly enhanced mid/upper westerly flow from
the northern Plains to the Great Lakes vicinity. Given the generally
low-amplitude nature the upper pattern across the northern U.S.
through at least Day 6 or 7/Sat or Sun, the main driver of severe
potential each day will be mesoscale features tied to prior days
convective evolution, not well resolved at longer time scales. As a
result, predictability is low.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0144 AM CDT Mon Jul 14 2025

Valid 151200Z - 161200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF EASTERN NEVADA INTO
WESTERN UTAH AND NORTHERN ARIZONA...

...Synopsis...
A deepening mid-level wave will bring an increase in winds and
potential for dry thunderstorms across the Great Basin on Tuesday.
Elevated to Critical conditions can be expected in portions of
eastern Nevada, western Utah, northern Arizona and southern Idaho.

...Eastern Nevada, western Utah, northern Arizona...
Increasing southwesterly flow around 10-20 mph will overlap with
afternoon relative humidity reductions to around 10-15 percent on
Tuesday afternoon. The best overlap of Critical winds and relative
humidity appears to be across eastern Nevada into western Utah.
Further south into northern Arizona and the Arizona Strip, winds may
be at or just below Critical thresholds. However, ongoing fires with
a history of erratic fire behavior warrant inclusion into the
Critical area. Gusty and erratic winds from nearby thunderstorms
will also be possible. 

...Dry Thunderstorms...
Isolated dry thunderstorms will be possible on the periphery of
deeper monsoonal moisture across portions of northern Arizona into
western Colorado, Utah, far southern Idaho, western Wyoming, and
Nevada. Within these regions, PWs generally around 0.25-0.50" are
expected with moisture remaining primarily mid-level with drier
boundary layer conditions below. This will promote high based
convection with little precipitation amid faster storm motions with
the mid-level trough passage. Fuels within these regions are
receptive to ignition and as such an isolated dry thunder area was
maintained with this outlook.

0341 PM CDT Sun Jul 13 2025

Areas affected...Parts of east TX into far southeast OK...northwest

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 132041Z - 132245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Storms with locally damaging winds are possible through
the remainder of the afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Some increase in storm coverage and intensity has been
noted within a very moist and strongly buoyant environment across
east-central TX, along a composite outflow to the east of a
well-defined MCV over central TX. Deep-layer shear is relatively
weak, but modest southwesterly low/midlevel flow attendant to the
MCV and further outflow consolidation could result in a
northeastward-moving storm cluster that will move toward the
ArkLaTex region through the remainder of the afternoon. Such a
cluster could be accompanied by isolated damaging winds. Additional
storm development will be possible ahead of this developing cluster
into northeast TX and southwest AR, which may also be capable of
producing localized downbursts.

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible

SUMMARY...Storms are expected to increase in coverage and intensity
through the afternoon and into the evening, posing a severe wind
risk.  A severe thunderstorm watch is possible.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms have initiated over the high terrain this
afternoon across the region.  While moisture is meager for this time
of year, it is sufficient to support 500-1000 J/kg of MLCAPE and
robust updrafts.  The 18Z Tucson sounding represents the
characteristic well-mixed, inverted-V sounding profiles across the
region.  Certainly, this environment will support dry-microburst
potential for the strongest storms.  With northeasterly midlevel
flow expected to increase this afternoon and evening, a more
organized wind threat could develop and move south-southwestward off
the higher terrain.  Convective trends will continue to be monitored
for the possibility of watch issuance.

Areas affected...Parts of central/eastern VA...central MD...the
eastern WV Panhandle

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 131941Z - 132115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated damaging wind remains possible through late
afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Earlier convection across MD and eastern VA has
generated a westward-moving outflow approaching central VA.
Meanwhile, other storms have developed this afternoon along/east of
the Blue Ridge. Deep-layer flow is quite weak across the region,
resulting in generally disorganized storms. However, strong heating
of a very moist airmass (PW around 2 inches) has resulted in MLCAPE
increasing above 3000 J/kg in areas outside of convective outflow.
The large PW and favorable buoyancy will support a threat of
localized wet microbursts, both with storms along the
westward-moving outflow, and the storms moving slowly eastward off
of the Blue Ridge. Outflow collisions may result in brief upticks in
storm intensity through the remainder of the afternoon.

Mesoscale Discussion 1661

0214 PM CDT Sun Jul 13 2025

Areas affected...eastern Florida peninsula

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 131914Z - 132145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms are expected to continue developing and
moving southward through the afternoon posing an isolated damaging
wind threat.  A severe thunderstorm watch is unlikely.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms continue to develop along the eastern
peninsula of Florida in a very moist and unstable environment. 
While the deep-layer flow/shear is weak (per XMR 15Z sounding),
there does appear to be enhanced north-northwesterly low-level flow
likely associated with the midlevel low off the east coast of
Florida.  As a result, 0-3 km northerly shear is around 20 knots
(per MLB VWP), which is at least modestly supportive of
southward-propagating clusters capable of producing severe, damaging
wind gusts through the afternoon.  The localized, isolated nature of
the threat will preclude watch issuance.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0250 PM CDT Sun Jul 13 2025

Valid 132000Z - 141200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS SOUTHEAST
ARIZONA...CENTRAL PENNSYLVANIA INTO NORTHERN NEW YORK...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms are possible today through early
tonight in the Upper Midwest, Mid-Atlantic/Northeast, Southwest,
south-central Texas to the Lower Ohio Valley, and Florida.

...20Z Update...
Adjustments were made to the general thunderstorm area based on
current observations. The forecast is otherwise unchanged. See the
previous forecast for additional details.

..Wendt.. 07/13/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1128 AM CDT Sun Jul 13 2025/

...Northeast/Mid-Atlantic States...
Moist low-level convergence, orographic effects, and glancing ascent
from an exiting shortwave trough will combine to support widespread
thunderstorm development from western/central NY southward into
central VA today. Shear is weak across much of the region, with a
generally disorganized multicellular mode anticipated. As such,
water-loaded downbursts will be the primary risk. However, modestly
stronger mid-level southwesterlies could support some sustained
multicells from central/northern NY into central PA. Consequently,
there is corridor of greater severe potential across this region
where storm clustering and linear segments appear more likely.

...Southwest...
Modest northerly flow aloft is forecast across northern NM, turning
more northeasterly over southeast AZ. Widespread storms are expected
to develop off the higher terrain and then progress
southward/southwestward from mid-afternoon to mid-evening. Given
moderate northeasterly flow, the potential for strong gusts exists,
particularly across southeast AZ, where high-based storms coming off
the higher terrain will move into a deeply mixed airmass.  

...Upper Midwest...
Satellite imagery shows some modest drying over far southern MB and
western ND associated with a low-amplitude shortwave trough embedded
within the northwesterly flow aloft. Modest large-scale ascent
attendant to this wave will augment convergence along a surface
trough progressing through the region to support thunderstorms
during the late afternoon/early evening. Strengthening mid-level
northwesterly flow will result in hodographs supportive of potential
discrete supercells and large hail production. However, relatively
warm profiles (i.e. modest mid-level lapse rates) and lingering
convective inhibition should limit overall storm intensity/coverage.
Isolated large hail/severe gusts from a few widely spaced supercells
seem plausible from late afternoon until around sunset.

...TX Hill Country into South-Central/East Texas...
Morning radar and satellite imagery show a well-defined MCV centered
over the Concho/McCulloch/Menard county vicinity. This MCV is not
expected to move much today as it drifts slowly south/southeastward.
However, outflow associated with thunderstorms generated by this MCV
is pushing eastward/southeastward into the very moist and buoyant
airmass downstream. Primary threat with this system is likely flash
flooding (see WPC EROs/MPDs for details), but a few water-loaded
downbursts capable of wind damage are possible as the composite
outflow pushes into more of south-central/east TX this afternoon and
evening.

...Mid-South/Lower Ohio Valley...
A pair of convectively enhanced vorticity maxima are apparent across
the region on recent radar and satellite imagery. The southernmost
vorticity max is currently moving eastward across the central OK/AR
border, while the northernmost max is moving through central MO.
Both of these features are expected to progress
eastward/northeastward today, interacting with the moist and buoyant
airmass downstream to promote widespread thunderstorms from the
Lower OH Valley into the Mid-South vicinity. Modest but deep
southwesterly flow will be in place, which could potentially support
some clustering/upscale growth along a northeastward-progressing
cold pool, particularly from the MO Bootheel vicinity into western
KY and southern IN where the highest storm coverage is expected.
Some risk for damaging gusts could accompany this cluster.

...Lower MS Valley...
A few water-loaded downbursts are possible within the very moist
(i.e. PWAT greater than 2") and strongly buoyant (i.e. MLCAPE over
2500 J/kg) airmass over the region this afternoon. Updraft longevity
will be limited by weak shear but new development is likely on any
outflow boundaries.

...Florida...
A modest mid-level cyclone will drift closer to the Southeast coast
today. Mid-level northerly/northwesterly flow around the western
periphery of this cyclone is expected across the northern and
central FL Peninsula today. Even though it will be relatively modest
(i.e. 20 to 25 kt at 500 mb), it should still be enough to foster
some long-lived updrafts within the very moist and unstable airmass
that is in place. As a result, damaging gusts will be possible
within wet microbursts from mid-afternoon to early evening.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE UPPER
MIDWEST TO THE CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS AND ACROSS THE MID MISSISSIPPI
VALLEY...

CORRECTED FOR NDFD FILL ERROR

...SUMMARY...
Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms are possible Tuesday
afternoon and evening across portions of the central Plains to Upper
Midwest and Mid Mississippi Valley.

...Northern/Central Plains to the Upper Midwest...
A broad upper trough and multiple convectively enhanced shortwave
perturbations moving out of southern Canada should move
east/southeastward over the Northern Rockies Tuesday. A belt of
enhanced mid-level flow (30-40 kt) will also spread eastward,
overlapping with a sagging cold front from the western Great Lakes,
across the northern Plains and into the Rockies. Along and south of
the front, rich low-level moisture is expected with dewpoints in the
upper 60s to low 70s F contributing to 2500-3000 J/kg of MLCAPE.
Ascent from the approach trough and flow aloft will aid in deepening
a lee low across the central High Plains at the junction of the
front and a prominent lee trough. Convergence along these features,
should support scattered thunderstorms Tuesday afternoon and
evening.

With deep-layer shear increasing to 30-35 kt, scattered
thunderstorms organized into multicell clusters or supercell
structures is possible along the cold front from the eastern Dakotas
to the western Great Lakes and within the broader warm sector across
southern SD to central NE. More isolated storms will also be
possible along and east of the lee trough trailing the surface low
to the south. Steep low mid-level lapse rates of 8+ C/km will be
more than sufficient for isolated severe storms capable of damaging
gusts and some hail. Consideration was given to higher severe
probabilities given large forecast buoyancy and more focused forcing
along the front/triple point. However, variability in the timing of
the front and overnight convective influences at this range lend low
confidence to any one solution.

At least an isolated severe risk should also extend westward within
the post-front upslope regime across far southern MT and into
eastern WY and western SD. While buoyancy will be reduced, low-level
moist advection and upslope flow behind the front will support
isolated to widely scattered storms within enhanced mid-level flow.
Hail and isolated damaging gusts are possible.

...Mid MS Valley...
Multiple model solutions show a rather well-defined MCV moving out
of the southern Plains and Ozarks into the mid MS Valley by Tuesday
morning. A very warm and humid air mass will remain in place ahead
of this feature supporting sufficient buoyancy for scattered
thunderstorms. The exact placement and intensity of this feature
remains very uncertain owing to different mesoscale
solutions/convective influence in the coming days. Still, some
enhancement of the low/mid-level flow field could support some
organized clusters capable of damaging gusts.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM SOUTHERN
NEW ENGLAND TO THE MID ATLANTIC AND THE NORTHERN ROCKIES/PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms are possible across portions
of the northern Plains/Rockies and across the Mid Atlantic and
Southern New England Monday.

...Mid Atlantic to southern New England...
Weak troughing at the northern periphery of the subtropical ridge
will shift northward across parts of the Northeast Monday. At the
surface, a wind shift/weak front will move from the eastern Great
Lakes into the upper OH/St Lawrence Valley by early afternoon. A
very warm and humid air mass is in place east of the front with
dewpoints in the 70s F expected. Despite some lingering cloud cover,
diurnal heating should support moderate destabilization over much of
the Northeast. Widespread thunderstorm activity is expected along
and ahead of the surface boundary from northern VA into southern NY.
Slight enhancement of the flow aloft to near 20 kt from the
approaching shortwave could be enough to foster some longer-lived
clusters with damaging gust potential from northern VA into southern
NY. Elsewhere across the East, confidence in storm coverage/damaging
wind potential is lower, but any stronger storms will remain cable
of damaging outflow gusts from heavily water-loaded downdrafts.

...Northern Rockies and Plains...
An upper trough, forecast to emanate from southern Canada, will move
eastward over the northern Rockies/Plains Monday and Monday night.
Ascent from this feature will overspread a weak cold front and lee
trough/low, that will serve as a focus for scattered thunderstorms
through afternoon and evening. Along the southern fringes of
enhanced westerly flow aloft, a mix of multicells and transient
supercells is expected. Modest surface moisture and deep
boundary-layer mixing will support moderate buoyancy atop inverted-v
structures favorable for damaging gusts and some hail with storms
from northern WY into the western Dakotas.

Late in the evening and into the overnight hours, low-level warm
advection and continued ascent from the upper trough are expected to
intensify along and north of the cold front from eastern MT into ND.
A belt of strong mid-level flow (35-50 kt) will overlap with
elevated destabilization north of the front. While not overly
robust, sufficient buoyancy (MUCAPE ~1000 J/kg) and elongated
hodographs should support a few organized elevated storms (including
supercell structures) capable of isolated hail.

...Southeast States...
A seasonably warm and moist air mass will again reside across much
of the southeastern US beneath broad subtropical ridging aloft.
Scattered to numerous storms expected Monday afternoon and evening
amid strong diurnal heating and weak background ascent. With PWATs
near or exceeding two inches and moderate buoyancy, a few stronger
thunderstorm clusters may develop. With weak vertical shear below 15
kt, organized storms on a widespread basis are not expected. Still,
sporadic damaging gusts from wet microbursts are possible.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1212 PM CDT Sun Jul 13 2025

Valid 131700Z - 141200Z

CORRECTED FOR IMPROPER LABEL

...Mogollon Rim...
Daytime heating and instability within a corridor of precipitable
water values of 0.50-0.75 inches will support isolated dry
thunderstorm development across the Mogollon Rim this afternoon.
Heavier precipitation cores in the lower desert areas in southern
Arizona (with PWATs of around one inch) will limit new ignition
potential to the Mogollon Rim corridor where dry fuels exist.

..Williams.. 07/13/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1134 PM CDT Sat Jul 12 2025/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level wave will begin to traverse the northern periphery of
the western ridge today, bringing an increase in westerly flow
across the Cascades in central Washington and northern Oregon.
Elevated fire weather conditions will be likely across the Cascade
Gaps and into the Columbia Basin, where relative humidity reductions
around 20 percent will overlap winds sustained 10-15 mph (locally
higher). An Elevated was maintained with this outlook to support
potential for increased fire spread potential.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
A mix of wet/dry thunderstorms will be possible in Northern Arizona
today. Moisture banked across the Mogollon Rim becomes less with
northern extent, where PWs drop to around 0.25-0.50". Storm motions
will be around 10-20 mph, but coverage should allow multiple rounds
of storms. However, outside of heavier cores and where less coverage
is expected across the western rim, there could be a few instances
of dry lightning. Overall, the small coverage of this risk does not
warrant inclusion of an area at this time.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM NORTHERN NEW
YORK INTO CENTRAL PENNSYLVANIA AND ACROSS FAR SOUTHEAST ARIZONA....

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms are possible today through early
tonight in the Upper Midwest, Mid-Atlantic/Northeast, Southwest,
south-central Texas to the Lower Ohio Valley, and Florida.

...Northeast/Mid-Atlantic States...
Moist low-level convergence, orographic effects, and glancing ascent
from an exiting shortwave trough will combine to support widespread
thunderstorm development from western/central NY southward into
central VA today. Shear is weak across much of the region, with a
generally disorganized multicellular mode anticipated. As such,
water-loaded downbursts will be the primary risk. However, modestly
stronger mid-level southwesterlies could support some sustained
multicells from central/northern NY into central PA. Consequently,
there is corridor of greater severe potential across this region
where storm clustering and linear segments appear more likely.

...Southwest...
Modest northerly flow aloft is forecast across northern NM, turning
more northeasterly over southeast AZ. Widespread storms are expected
to develop off the higher terrain and then progress
southward/southwestward from mid-afternoon to mid-evening. Given
moderate northeasterly flow, the potential for strong gusts exists,
particularly across southeast AZ, where high-based storms coming off
the higher terrain will move into a deeply mixed airmass.  

...Upper Midwest...
Satellite imagery shows some modest drying over far southern MB and
western ND associated with a low-amplitude shortwave trough embedded
within the northwesterly flow aloft. Modest large-scale ascent
attendant to this wave will augment convergence along a surface
trough progressing through the region to support thunderstorms
during the late afternoon/early evening. Strengthening mid-level
northwesterly flow will result in hodographs supportive of potential
discrete supercells and large hail production. However, relatively
warm profiles (i.e. modest mid-level lapse rates) and lingering
convective inhibition should limit overall storm intensity/coverage.
Isolated large hail/severe gusts from a few widely spaced supercells
seem plausible from late afternoon until around sunset.

...TX Hill Country into South-Central/East Texas...
Morning radar and satellite imagery show a well-defined MCV centered
over the Concho/McCulloch/Menard county vicinity. This MCV is not
expected to move much today as it drifts slowly south/southeastward.
However, outflow associated with thunderstorms generated by this MCV
is pushing eastward/southeastward into the very moist and buoyant
airmass downstream. Primary threat with this system is likely flash
flooding (see WPC EROs/MPDs for details), but a few water-loaded
downbursts capable of wind damage are possible as the composite
outflow pushes into more of south-central/east TX this afternoon and
evening.

...Mid-South/Lower Ohio Valley...
A pair of convectively enhanced vorticity maxima are apparent across
the region on recent radar and satellite imagery. The southernmost
vorticity max is currently moving eastward across the central OK/AR
border, while the northernmost max is moving through central MO.
Both of these features are expected to progress
eastward/northeastward today, interacting with the moist and buoyant
airmass downstream to promote widespread thunderstorms from the
Lower OH Valley into the Mid-South vicinity. Modest but deep
southwesterly flow will be in place, which could potentially support
some clustering/upscale growth along a northeastward-progressing
cold pool, particularly from the MO Bootheel vicinity into western
KY and southern IN where the highest storm coverage is expected.
Some risk for damaging gusts could accompany this cluster.

...Lower MS Valley...
A few water-loaded downbursts are possible within the very moist
(i.e. PWAT greater than 2") and strongly buoyant (i.e. MLCAPE over
2500 J/kg) airmass over the region this afternoon. Updraft longevity
will be limited by weak shear but new development is likely on any
outflow boundaries.

...Florida...
A modest mid-level cyclone will drift closer to the Southeast coast
today. Mid-level northerly/northwesterly flow around the western
periphery of this cyclone is expected across the northern and
central FL Peninsula today. Even though it will be relatively modest
(i.e. 20 to 25 kt at 500 mb), it should still be enough to foster
some long-lived updrafts within the very moist and unstable airmass
that is in place. As a result, damaging gusts will be possible
within wet microbursts from mid-afternoon to early evening.
