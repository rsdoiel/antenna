Mesoscale Discussion 1738
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0241 PM CDT Sun Jul 20 2025

Areas affected...south-central South Dakota across western Nebraska
and toward northwest Kansas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 201941Z - 202215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered severe storms appear likely later this afternoon
from south-central SD across west-central NE and toward northwest
KS. A few cells may produce large hail, with locally damaging gusts.
A tornado is possible over southern SD into far northern NE after
23Z. A portion of the area may require a watch.

DISCUSSION...Surface map shows low pressure extending from southwest
SD across western NE and into the CO/KS border area, with strong
heating. This trough will continue to deepen, and sufficient
convergence within the uncapped air mass should allow for widely
scattered storms to develop late this afternoon.

Of particular note is the warm front area which currently curls
northwestward out of northern NE and into south-central SD. Here,
heating is occurring on the cool side of the boundary, where
dewpoints remain above 70 F and low-level shear is enhanced. Any
supercell that develops here, most likely after 23Z, could be
tornadic at times, and produce very large hail as it proceeds
southeastward, aided by a modest evening low-level jet.

Farther south into the deeper/heated air mass, higher based storms
are expected, and overall shear is weaker as well. However, steep
lapse rates will favor locally severe gusts, and even some hail in
the early and robust formation stages.

Mesoscale Discussion 1737
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0135 PM CDT Sun Jul 20 2025

Areas affected...southern Indiana and Ohio...northern Kentucky

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 201835Z - 202130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A few strong storms producing locally damaging gusts
cannot be ruled out later this afternoon from southern Indiana
across southern Ohio and northeast Kentucky.

DISCUSSION...An MCV continues to move rapidly eastward across
northern IN, well north of a stalled front draped across southern
IL/IN and southwest OH. Meanwhile, a very moist air mass remains
near this boundary, with heating occurring upstream across the Mid
MS and OH Valleys.

While the entire warm sector is unstable, areas near the front exist
beneath slightly stronger deep-layer mean winds, on the southern
periphery of the larger scale trough (and MCV) influence.

Visible imagery show increasing CU fields from southern IN into
northern and eastern KY, and scattered storms are likely within this
zone. Locally strong downbursts will be possible, but any more
substantial wind threat would be conditional on a large cluster of
storms producing outflow, and tracking east/southeast near the
boundary. At this time, it appears a watch will not be necessary.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0256 PM CDT Sun Jul 20 2025

Valid 211200Z - 221200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHWESTERN AND NORTH-CENTRAL
NEVADA...

The Critical area across northwest Nevada was expanded to include
portions of north-central Nevada with this update. Latest ensemble 
guidance suggests high probabilities that Critical conditions will
continue into this region on Monday afternoon. Otherwise, the
Elevated area remains unchanged. See previous discussion for more
information.

..Thornton.. 07/20/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1249 AM CDT Sun Jul 20 2025/

...Synopsis...
The upper-level trough in the Northwest will continue to dig
southward through the day on Monday. Some increase in the mid-level
jet is expected to occur from northwest Nevada into the northern
Rockies. A surface low will deepen in the northern Great Basin.

...Central/northern Great Basin into western Wyoming...
A broad area of elevated fire weather conditions are expected across
these regions. Surface winds will reach 15-20 mph in most locations,
though areas of higher speeds are possible in terrain-favored areas.
Single digit RH is possible in parts of central/northern Nevada, but
15-20% will be more common elsewhere.

Critical conditions are expected along the Sierra Front in northwest
Nevada. Here, the mid-level jet will enhance winds aloft during the
afternoon. While the surface low will not be overly deep, the
combination of these factors will support winds around 20 mph near
the terrain. Gusts to around 30 mph are also possible. There is some
potential for high level clouds to limit RH reductions. Even with
some of these marginal factors, wind speeds should be sufficient to
promote rapid fire spread in fuels that are very dry (ERCs above
90th percentile).

## SPC Jul 20, 2025 2000 UTC Day 1 Convective Outlook

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0239 PM CDT Sun Jul 20 2025

Valid 202000Z - 211200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PORTIONS OF
THE CENTRAL INTO NORTHERN PLAINS...PARTS OF THE OHIO VALLEY...AND
PARTS OF THE NORTHEAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms appear most likely this afternoon into this
evening across parts of the Northeast, portions of the northern and
central Plains, and perhaps the Ohio Valley.

...20Z Update...
The primary change made to the Day 1 outlook was to add 5 percent
tornado probabilities across south-central SD into north-central NE.
Here, a cluster of supercells is expected to develop along a diffuse
warm-frontal boundary, where directional low-level shear will be
present. Up to 200 m2/s2 effective SRH in this region may support
the development of a tornado in addition to severe winds and very
large hail, given 2500-4000 J/kg MLCAPE by evening. 

Consideration was also given to remove Slight risk and 2 percent
tornado probabilities over the OH Valley given remnant cloud cover
and overall lack of upper support to foster an organized severe
threat. However, on the immediate southern periphery of this cloud
deck resides an axis of overlapping 2000+ MLCAPE and 30+ kts of
effective bulk shear. Should storms manage to develop, especially
before nocturnal cooling commences, a conditional risk for scattered
damaging gusts or a brief tornado would exist, so 15 percent severe
wind/2 percent tornado probabilities have been maintained.

Otherwise, the previous forecast (see below) remains on track.

..Squitieri.. 07/20/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1130 AM CDT Sun Jul 20 2025/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will amplify across the Northeast today with
increasing mid-level flow ahead of an approaching jet streak. A
low-amplitude ridge will build somewhat across the Upper Midwest.
Farther west, mid-level flow will strengthen across the northern
Rockies into the northern Plains as a trough amplifies on the
Pacific Northwest coast. 

...Northeast...
Weak to moderate instability is forecast to develop across the
Northeast through mid afternoon as the airmass continues to
destabilize.  Midday surface analysis indicates temperatures are
warming into the 80s with dewpoints in the upper 60s to lower 70s. 
As the cold front advances east into this uncapped airmass,
scattered thunderstorms should develop. Shear of 30 to 35 knots and
relatively long/straight hodographs will support the potential for
supercells. Weak mid-level lapse rates will be the primary limiting
factor for large hail, but the overall favorable shear with strong
venting aloft and potential supercells may support some isolated
large hail. 

Damaging wind gusts will be the primary threat, both from initial
cells and also from any clusters which develop. Any stronger
clusters with bowing segments could support a better organized
damaging wind swath. The greatest wind damage threat will likely
exist from western Massachusetts to far southern Maine. 

...Southeast MT into the Dakotas and Central Plains...
Lee troughing is forecast to extend southward from eastern MT into
the central High Plains near and south of the westerlies confined to
the northern tier of states.  Elevated weak thunderstorm activity
along the ND/SD border may continue but considerable uncertainty
exists whether these storms will intensify and pose a severe risk
this afternoon.  Meanwhile, farther west, moist low levels arc from
southeast MT southeastward through west-central SD and south into
NE/northwest KS.  Strong heating will contribute to a moderate to
very unstable airmass from the central Plains states into eastern
MT.  Easterly low-level flow beneath 30-40 kt 500 mb flow in
southeast MT will support organized storms, including supercell
potential.  Isolated to scattered storms are forecast to develop and
spread east into the Dakotas.  Other isolated to widely scattered
storms are possible from SD southward into NE/CO/KS border vicinity
late this afternoon into the evening.  

Large to very large hail will be possible with any supercells that
develop within this general region.  However, the severe wind threat
may increase by this evening and become the main threat as storms
congeal into one or more clusters or MCS.

...Ohio Valley...
Visible-satellite/radar composite shows an elongated area of
showers/thunderstorms from northern MO east into western OH in
conjunction with an MCV moving east from IL into IN.  Additional
storm development along the composite front/trailing outflow
boundary is expected, but timing of this storm activity remains
unclear.  Nonetheless, differential heating along the baroclinic
zone will yield 2000 to 3000 J/kg MLCAPE amidst moderate effective
shear (25-35 kt).  A few clusters are forecast to eventually evolve
later this afternoon into the evening with the stronger storms
capable primarily of a wind-damage threat.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0230 PM CDT Sun Jul 20 2025

Valid 221200Z - 231200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE UPPER MIDWEST...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong/severe thunderstorms may impact parts of the
northern Great Plains into the Upper Midwest Tuesday into Tuesday
night, posing a risk for severe wind and hail. Damaging thunderstorm
wind gusts are also possible across parts of the Southeast.

...Northern Plains to the Upper Midwest...
Along the northwestern periphery of an expansive midlevel ridge
centered on Mid MS Valley, moderate west-southwesterly midlevel flow
will be in place from the northern Plains to the Upper Midwest --
downstream of a persistent midlevel trough over the Northwest.
Several embedded impulses should advance through the belt of
west-southwesterlies, while a surface low moves slowly eastward
across the Dakotas. Downstream of the surface low, middle/upper 70s
dewpoints beneath a steep midlevel lapse rate plume will contribute
to a corridor of extreme surface-based buoyancy along a warm-front
type feature draped across the Upper Midwest. While subtle forcing
for ascent and potential early-day convection cast uncertainty on
the overall convective scenario here, a broad/strong low-level jet
(and related warm-air advection), the extreme buoyancy, and strong
deep-layer shear will support robust/organized storms capable of
producing swaths of severe wind and hail. 

Farther west over eastern MT into the Dakotas, subtle midlevel
height falls atop seasonably rich boundary-layer moisture will also
favor strong to severe storms, with a risk of severe wind gusts and
large hail.

...Southeast...
A very high PW air mass will be in place across the Southeast, where
diurnal heating will contribute to moderate surface-based buoyancy.
As a weak cold front impinges on this air mass during the afternoon,
modestly enhanced midlevel northerly flow will support loosely
organized storm clusters capable of producing damaging winds.

1230 PM CDT Sun Jul 20 2025

Valid 211200Z - 221200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
EASTERN/CENTRAL MONTANA...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms capable of producing severe wind gusts and
large hail are expected across parts of the northern Great Plains.
Damaging thunderstorm wind gusts are also possible across parts of
the Ohio Valley and the Southeast.

...Northern Plains...
Downstream of a slow-moving midlevel trough over the Northwest, a
related southwesterly jet streak will emerge over the northern
Rockies into the adjacent High Plains during the day. Related
forcing for ascent will aid in widely scattered thunderstorm
development within a deeply mixed air mass over western/central MT.
As storms track eastward into an increasingly moist and unstable air
mass over central/eastern MT, around 50 kt of effective shear will
promote supercells and small organized clusters. Any longer-lived
storms will be capable of producing severe wind gusts and large
hail. 

...Ohio Valley and the Southeast...
Modestly enhanced west-northwesterly flow will be in place from the
OH/TN Valleys to the Southeast. Here, diurnal heating amid deep
tropospheric moisture will contribute to an environment favorable
for locally damaging thunderstorm wind gusts through the afternoon.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1154 AM CDT Sun Jul 20 2025

Valid 201700Z - 211200Z

...Dry Thunderstorms...
A few isolated thunderstorms will be possible across west-central
Nevada. Overall, PWs around 0.75" and generally slow storm motions
around 5-10 kts should promote wetting rainfall. However, strikes
outside of the core may promote new starts, given critically dry
fuels. Overall, this risk looks to remain too isolated for inclusion
of a dry thunderstorm area.

No changes are needed to the previous D1 Fire Weather Outlook
Elevated area. See previous discussion below for more information.

..Thornton.. 07/20/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1248 AM CDT Sun Jul 20 2025/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough will begin to sag into northern California and
the northern Great Basin today. A surface trough will develop from
the Northwest into the central Great Basin.

Elevated to locally critical conditions are possible from northern
Nevada into the Snake River Plain and western Wyoming. RH will be
lowest in Nevada where 10-20% is expected. Farther north and east,
15-20% will be more common. Surface wind speeds will generally range
from 15-20 mph in most locations. With some terrain enhancement in
the Snake River Plain, there is some potential for briefly stronger
winds. This location has a greater probability for sustained
critical conditions, though ensemble guidance continues to suggest
it will remain quite localized.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1130 AM CDT Sun Jul 20 2025

Valid 201630Z - 211200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PORTIONS OF
THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL PLAINS...OHIO VALLEY...AND PARTS OF THE
NORTHEAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms appear most likely this afternoon into this
evening across parts of the Northeast, portions of the northern and
central Plains, and perhaps the Ohio Valley.

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will amplify across the Northeast today with
increasing mid-level flow ahead of an approaching jet streak. A
low-amplitude ridge will build somewhat across the Upper Midwest.
Farther west, mid-level flow will strengthen across the northern
Rockies into the northern Plains as a trough amplifies on the
Pacific Northwest coast. 

...Northeast...
Weak to moderate instability is forecast to develop across the
Northeast through mid afternoon as the airmass continues to
destabilize.  Midday surface analysis indicates temperatures are
warming into the 80s with dewpoints in the upper 60s to lower 70s. 
As the cold front advances east into this uncapped airmass,
scattered thunderstorms should develop. Shear of 30 to 35 knots and
relatively long/straight hodographs will support the potential for
supercells. Weak mid-level lapse rates will be the primary limiting
factor for large hail, but the overall favorable shear with strong
venting aloft and potential supercells may support some isolated
large hail. 

Damaging wind gusts will be the primary threat, both from initial
cells and also from any clusters which develop. Any stronger
clusters with bowing segments could support a better organized
damaging wind swath. The greatest wind damage threat will likely
exist from western Massachusetts to far southern Maine. 

...Southeast MT into the Dakotas and Central Plains...
Lee troughing is forecast to extend southward from eastern MT into
the central High Plains near and south of the westerlies confined to
the northern tier of states.  Elevated weak thunderstorm activity
along the ND/SD border may continue but considerable uncertainty
exists whether these storms will intensify and pose a severe risk
this afternoon.  Meanwhile, farther west, moist low levels arc from
southeast MT southeastward through west-central SD and south into
NE/northwest KS.  Strong heating will contribute to a moderate to
very unstable airmass from the central Plains states into eastern
MT.  Easterly low-level flow beneath 30-40 kt 500 mb flow in
southeast MT will support organized storms, including supercell
potential.  Isolated to scattered storms are forecast to develop and
spread east into the Dakotas.  Other isolated to widely scattered
storms are possible from SD southward into NE/CO/KS border vicinity
late this afternoon into the evening.  

Large to very large hail will be possible with any supercells that
develop within this general region.  However, the severe wind threat
may increase by this evening and become the main threat as storms
congeal into one or more clusters or MCS.

...Ohio Valley...
Visible-satellite/radar composite shows an elongated area of
showers/thunderstorms from northern MO east into western OH in
conjunction with an MCV moving east from IL into IN.  Additional
storm development along the composite front/trailing outflow
boundary is expected, but timing of this storm activity remains
unclear.  Nonetheless, differential heating along the baroclinic
zone will yield 2000 to 3000 J/kg MLCAPE amidst moderate effective
shear (25-35 kt).  A few clusters are forecast to eventually evolve
later this afternoon into the evening with the stronger storms
capable primarily of a wind-damage threat.

Mesoscale Discussion 1735
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0735 AM CDT Sun Jul 20 2025

Areas affected...Portions of far east-central IL into central IN

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 201235Z - 201430Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...A small complex of thunderstorms may pose a gradually
increasing threat for damaging winds over the next few hours. Watch
issuance is possible later this morning if this activity can
intensify.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms are ongoing this morning across parts of
central IL, aided by modest west-southwesterly low-level warm
advection and a low-amplitude mid-level perturbation. This
convection should continue to track generally east-southeastward
this morning across parts of central IN along an instability
gradient evident in latest mesoanalysis. While low/mid-level flow is
not overly strong, recent VWPs from KILX/KIND do show some
strengthening with height through mid levels. Resultant 25-30 kt of
effective bulk shear should continue to support some updraft
organization, with a recent supercell structure noted with a
thunderstorm near the IL/IN border. If a small bowing cluster can
become established as some recent high-resolution guidance suggests,
then a greater threat for scattered severe/damaging winds may be
realized across parts of central IN later this morning as the
boundary layer gradually destabilizes with filtered daytime heating.
While not immediately likely, Severe Thunderstorm Watch issuance may
eventually be needed if the ongoing activity can intensify.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0728 AM CDT Sun Jul 20 2025

Valid 201300Z - 211200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PARTS OF THE
NORTHEAST...MIDWEST...OHIO VALLEY...AND NORTHERN PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Strong to severe storms appear most likely later today into this
evening across parts of the Northeast, Midwest and Ohio Valley, and
northern Plains.

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will amplify across the Northeast today with
increasing mid-level flow ahead of an approaching jet streak. A
low-amplitude ridge will build somewhat across the Upper Midwest.
Farther west, mid-level flow will strengthen across the northern
Rockies into the northern Plains as a trough amplifies on the
Pacific Northwest coast. 

As of 12Z, an elongated frontal zone exists from the Northeast to
the Ohio Valley/southern Great Lakes and into the northern Plains.
Ongoing thunderstorms are present across the eastern Great Lakes,
the Midwest, and the northern Plains. This is correlated with the
stronger ascent and the areas with the greatest severe weather
potential today. 

...Northeast...
Weak to moderate instability is forecast to develop across the
Northeast today as temperatures warm into the 80s with dewpoints in
the upper 60s, and as mid-level temperatures gradually cool through
the day. As the cold front advances east into this uncapped airmass,
scattered thunderstorms should develop. Shear of 30 to 35 knots and
relatively long/straight hodographs will support the potential for
supercells. Weak mid-level lapse rates will be the primary limiting
factor for large hail, but the overall favorable shear with strong
venting aloft and potential supercells may support some isolated
large hail. 

Damaging wind gusts will be the primary threat, both from initial
cells and also from any clusters which develop. Any stronger
clusters with bowing segments could support a better organized
damaging wind swath. The greatest wind damage threat will likely
exist from western Massachusetts to far southern Maine. 

...Ohio Valley...
A large mass of thunderstorms continues east across eastern Iowa and
northern Illinois this morning. Heating is anticipated south and
east of this activity which should result in an increasing severe
weather threat by late morning to early afternoon. It remains
unclear whether the afternoon severe threat may materialize out of
ongoing thunderstorm activity, or from additional storm development
along the front or the outflow boundary associated with these
storms. Nonetheless, 1000 to 1500 J/kg MLCAPE and effective shear of
35 to 40 knots will support an organized severe weather threat
including the potential for supercells. Despite the supercell mode,
the hail threat should remain minimal given the weak mid-level lapse
rates and warm mid-level temperatures with high freezing levels.
Damaging wind gusts will be the primary threat from these storms
with the greatest threat from central Indiana to southwest Ohio and
northern Kentucky. 

...Northern Plains...
Weak lee troughing is forecast in the western Nebraska vicinity
today as moderate mid-level flow overspreads the northern Plains. A
dryline will extend southward from this surface low into the central
High Plains. Isolated storms are possible along this boundary this
afternoon/evening. Moderate destabilization is forecast across
central South Dakota and vicinity as low-level moisture is advected
westward to the north of the surface low. 

Diurnal thunderstorm activity is forecast to be relatively isolated
along the dryline with perhaps slightly greater coverage across
eastern Minnesota amid cooler temperatures aloft. However, the
ongoing cluster of storms across North Dakota is forecast to linger
as isentropic ascent is maintained through the day. Eventual upscale
growth and a southeastward movement along the instability gradient
is anticipated. RAP forecast soundings show an environment favorable
for large hail initially with any supercells which develop. However,
the severe wind threat may increase by this evening as storms
congeal into a MCS with potential linear, bowing segments.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0345 AM CDT Sun Jul 20 2025

Valid 231200Z - 281200Z

...DISCUSSION...
The latest medium-range output offers little change from prior runs
concerning the general large-scale pattern evolution during the
middle to latter portion of the coming work week.  It still appears
that a fairly significant mid-level low currently emerging from the
northwestern Canadian Arctic latitudes will slowly progress across
and east-southeast of the Hudson Bay vicinity, to the north of an
increasingly prominent mid-level high evolving across the Ohio
Valley.  As this contributes to a belt of strengthening westerly to
northwesterly flow between the two features, it appears that
low-level moistening in a corridor beneath the southern periphery of
this regime will support substantive destabilization, and increasing
potential for organized strong to severe thunderstorm development.

The extent to which this corridor evolves south of the international
border, across parts of the Upper Midwest and adjacent Great Lakes
region toward the St. Lawrence Valley/New England remains at least a
bit unclear.  Adding to this uncertainty, forcing for this potential
convective development will be largely associated with sub-synoptic
perturbations with low predictability at this extended time frame.

Mesoscale Discussion 1724
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0346 PM CDT Sat Jul 19 2025

Areas affected...Parts of the northern High Plains

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 192046Z - 192245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...A gradual increase in storm coverage and intensity is
expected through late afternoon. The primary concerns will be large
hail and severe wind gusts. A watch should eventually be needed for
parts of the area.

DISCUSSION...Boundary-layer cumulus is gradually deepening along the
northern High Plains this afternoon, where low-level lapse rates
continue to steepen ahead of an approaching midlevel trough. Over
the next several hours, weak midlevel height falls and continued
diurnal heating should support widely scattered thunderstorms which
will spread eastward into an increasingly moist/unstable air mass.
Around 40-50 kt of effective shear will promote supercells and
organized clusters, capable of producing large to very large hail
and severe gusts. A tornado or two cannot be ruled out with any
supercells that evolve over eastern MT into this evening, given
sufficient low-level hodograph curvature. Generally weak large-scale
forcing for ascent and lingering low-level inhibition cast
uncertainty on timing of convective development/maturation, though
current thinking is a watch will eventually be needed for parts of
the area.

Areas affected...Portions of the Lower-Missouri Valley into northern
Missouri

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 192042Z - 192245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Elevated thunderstorms developing over the lower-Missouri
River Valley may intensify through early evening and pose a severe
hail/wind threat. Exact storm evolution is uncertain, but watch
issuance may be needed if intensification occurs.

DISCUSSION...Latest GOES imagery and lightning data show the
development of elevated thunderstorms over far northwest MO on the
eastern fringe of a plume of steeper (7-8 C/km) mid-level lapse
rates and within a zone of focused isentropic ascent between 925-850
mb. Although these storms are currently elevated, recent forecast
soundings suggests that lingering MLCIN will be increasingly
diminished as surface temperatures approach the low 90s. As such, it
is possible that this activity gradually becomes surface based over
the next 1-2 hours through peak heating and begins to fully realize
the 2000-2500 J/kg MLCAPE environment. GOES visible imagery and
derived wind products also show strong directional and speed shear
across the region, which should aid in storm organization and
intensification - likely into supercells with an attendant threat
for severe winds and large hail - if storms can be maintained. While
exact convective evolution is uncertain, watch issuance may be
needed if storms begin to intensify and pose a more robust severe
threat into northern MO.

Mesoscale Discussion 1722
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0321 PM CDT Sat Jul 19 2025

Areas affected...Eastern Virginia and far northeast North Carolina

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 526...

Valid 192021Z - 192215Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 526
continues.

SUMMARY...The threat for damaging/severe winds will become
increasingly concentrated across eastern Virginia over the next
several hours.

DISCUSSION...A mixture of semi-discrete cells and convective
clusters continue to evolve across central VA and northern NC, and
have a history of sporadic wind damage and small hail. Recent GOES
IR imagery and MRMS vertically integrated liquid/echo top data
continue to show transient, but intense, convective cores developing
across the region as storms move into, or develop within, a very
buoyant environment. Recent RAP mesoanalysis estimates suggest
MLCAPE has increased to 2000-3000 J/kg across eastern VA as
temperatures climb into the upper 80s and low 90s with low-level
lapse rates between 7-7.5 C/km. The trajectories of ongoing cells
and clusters suggests that storm interactions/convergence will
become increasingly likely across eastern VA within this CAPE
maximum over the next several hours. As this occurs, the favorable
thermodynamic environment should support an uptick in storm coverage
along with increasing probability for damaging downburst winds and
perhaps small hail.

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 191925Z - 192130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Monitoring the area for increasing severe-storm potential
this afternoon. Large hail, severe wind gusts, and a couple
tornadoes will all be possible. A watch will likely be issued for
parts of the area.

DISCUSSION...The latest visible satellite imagery and radar data
show increasingly agitated boundary-layer cumulus and first signs of
convective initiation within a zone of differential heating along a
composite outflow-surface front in west-central NE. While weak
large-scale forcing for ascent casts uncertainty on timing/evolution
of convection this afternoon, continued heating amid rich
boundary-layer moisture (lower 70s dewpoints) should support
isolated to widely scattered thunderstorms along the outflow
boundary and possibly farther west over the High Plains. A
long/mostly straight hodograph (around 50-60 kt of effective shear)
and strongly unstable air mass should initially support splitting
supercells with a risk of large to very large hail and severe gusts.
However, a strengthening low-level jet and increasing SRH will also
favor an increasing tornado risk into this evening. A watch will
likely be needed for parts of the area this afternoon.

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Southern Maryland
  Northern into Northeastern North Carolina
  Central into Southeast Virginia
  Coastal Waters

* Effective this Saturday afternoon and evening from 320 PM until
  1000 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 65 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1 inch in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Scattered thunderstorms are forecast to intensify through
the afternoon and evolve into several clusters posing mainly a
wind-damage risk (55-65 mph gusts).  This activity will gradually
shift eastward across the Watch and towards the coast by the early
to mid evening.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 80
statute miles north and south of a line from 55 miles west northwest
of South Hill VA to 40 miles northeast of Norfolk VA. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU6).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1 inch. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 55 knots. A few
cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
24015.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 527
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
315 PM CDT Sat Jul 19 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Western into Central Nebraska

* Effective this Saturday afternoon and evening from 315 PM until
  1100 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A couple tornadoes possible
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 75
    mph possible
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2.5
    inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Isolated to scattered thunderstorms are forecast to
develop and intensify this afternoon and pose a risk for large to
very large hail.  The stronger storms will be supercells.  The risk
for tornadoes will begin late this afternoon and maximize during the
evening.  The risk for severe gusts will probably increase during
the evening as one or two clusters possibly evolves.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 80 statute miles
north and south of a line from 75 miles west of Mullen NE to 10
miles north northeast of Broken Bow NE. For a complete depiction of
the watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS
WOU7).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 526...

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 2.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 65 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 550. Mean
storm motion vector 29025.

Mesoscale Discussion 1719
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0713 AM CDT Sat Jul 19 2025

Areas affected...southeast Iowa...northeast Missouri...and western
Illinois

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 525...

Valid 191213Z - 191345Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 525
continues.

SUMMARY...A damaging wind threat may persist this morning. A
downstream watch is possible.

DISCUSSION...A mature line of storms which developed earlier across
northern Iowa has progressed south with several measured gusts of 40
to 49 knots. Despite these near-severe wind gusts, no measured
severe wind gusts or wind damage has been reported thus far. A brief
TDS was sampled earlier by the KDMX WSR-88D, but quickly weakened
with minimal additional circulations observed. 

Considerable uncertainty remains on the evolution of ongoing storms
as daytime heating begins. A slightly more favorable orientation of
the line has developed across east-central Iowa, but a north-south
oriented line of storms is advancing ahead of this portion of the
line which may limit any more favorable wind damage threat which
could materialize. The portion of the line across central Iowa
should continue to move south-southeast, but it is unclear whether
surface heating can occur quickly enough before increasing CIN
weakens this portion of the line. In addition, the low-level jet
which supported/helped maintain the MCS has weakened/veered and will
likely provide limited support going forward.

Therefore, these competing factors will continue to be monitored and
a downstream severe thunderstorm watch may be issued if a severe
weather threat appears likely south and east of watch 525.

Mesoscale Discussion 1718
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0653 AM CDT Sat Jul 19 2025

Areas affected...West-central to east-central Wisconsin

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 191153Z - 191330Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...An isolated supercell produced large hail and severe wind
this morning. Additional development is possible.

DISCUSSION...A very strong supercell developed across Marathon
county this morning and produced hail up to 1.5 inches and several
reports of wind damage. This supercell developed and persisted along
the far northern periphery of weak elevated instability with strong
mid-upper-level flow (70-80 knots at 6-8km per area VWPs). Recent
radar trends suggest this supercell may weaken before it reaches the
Green Bay area. However, additional development is beginning farther
west across west-central Wisconsin. It is unclear whether this
activity will develop into one or more strong supercells, similar to
the lead supercell. However, instability is greater across
west-central Wisconsin than the environment which supported the
earlier supercell with similarly strong shear. Therefore, it is at
least a possibility that one or more additional supercells could
develop with a large hail/wind threat.

The uncertainty and relatively isolated nature of the threat
precludes the need for a watch at this time. However, if several
supercells develop and start to move east (a low but non-zero
probability), a watch could be necessary.

## SPC Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0341 PM CDT Fri Jul 18 2025

Valid 201200Z - 261200Z

A mid/upper-level tough is forecast to deepen across the Pacific
Northwest Day 3/Sunday into Day 4/Monday. Thereafter, the evolution
of the trough is somewhat uncertain, largely due to
inter/intra-model variability. Though, many recent solutions now
suggest some form of splitting with a portion of the trough ejecting
across the northern Rockies and another becoming cutoff (or
redeveloping) off/near the coast of California/Oregon through the
remainder of the week. 

...Day 3/Sunday - Day 5/Tuesday: Wind/RH...
Increasing mid-level winds - associated with the aforementioned
trough - will promote a broadening area of dry/breezy southwesterly
flow Day 3/Sunday across portions of the northern Great Basin, far
northeastern California, southeastern Oregon, and southwest Montana.
At this time, locally critical conditions appear most likely across
wind-prone areas of the Snake River Plain in Idaho. 

Fire weather conditions are forecast to shift a bit southward while
also increasing in coverage and intensity Day 4/Monday, as the
aforementioned trough continues to deepen. While an area of critical
fire weather conditions appears probable, relatively poor run-to-run
model consistency precludes increasing critical probabilities to 70%
at this time.  
 
Dry/breezy conditions are forecast to linger into Day 5/Tuesday
across the Great Basin. Though, relaxing mid-level winds and reduced
surface pressure gradients should promote lighter surface winds and
locally elevated fire weather conditions.

...Day 4/Monday - Day 5/Tuesday: Dry Thunderstorms...
Isolated dry thunderstorms are possible Day 4/Monday into Day
5/Tuesday across portions of northern Great Basin, Northwest, and
northern Rockies, as increasing moisture associated with the
aforementioned trough impinges on the area. While forecast guidance
suggests precipitable water values may be relatively high (0.8 - 1+
inch), somewhat fast-moving storm motions and critically receptive
fuels suggest a mix of wet/dry modes. At this time, uncertainty
remains too large to introduce probabilities for dry thunderstorms.

Mesoscale Discussion 1701
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0348 PM CDT Thu Jul 17 2025

Areas affected...portions of northern and central Montana

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 172048Z - 172245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated to widely scattered thunderstorms are expected
this afternoon and evening. A few supercells capable of hail and
damaging winds are expected. A WW is possible, although it is
uncertain when the severe risk will maximize.

DISCUSSION...Afternoon visible and radar imagery show initial
thunderstorm development is underway across far northern MT and
southern Canada. Aided by synoptic ascent from a shortwave trough
within northwesterly flow and heating along a stalled frontal
boundary, continued convective development is expected over the next
several hours. Modest moisture and somewhat cool surface
temperatures have limited boundary-layer destabilization so far this
afternoon. Still, with little inhibition, weak MLCAPE (500-700 J/kg)
will be sufficient for stronger updrafts. Additional destabilization
is expected as low-level warm advection along the boundary increases
into this evening. Elongated hodographs owing to enhanced
northwesterly flow aloft observed from the 18z TFX RAOB and area
VADs will support a supercell storm mode capable of hail and
isolated damaging gusts.

Despite weaker buoyancy, continued ascent along the stalled front
will likely serve as a focus for storm intensification over the next
couple of hours. This is supported by recent CAM guidance which
shows a few longer-lived supercells into this evening. The exact
timing of the severe risk remains unclear as destabilization
continues and storms may take some time to mature. However, at least
an isolated severe risk should gradually increase over the next few
hours. Given the broadly favorable environment for large hail and
severe gusts, a WW may be needed.

Mesoscale Discussion 1700
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0340 PM CDT Thu Jul 17 2025

Areas affected...Portions of VT...NH...and ME

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 521...

Valid 172040Z - 172245Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 521
continues.

SUMMARY...Threat for damaging gusts and/or a brief tornado or two
continues across portions of VT, NH, and ME.

DISCUSSION...Early afternoon soundings (i.e. 18Z) at CAR and GYX
sampled a moist and unstable airmass across the region, with little
to no convective inhibition. The CAR sounding also sampled moderate
vertical shear (i.e. 0-6 km bulk shear of 43 kt), while notably
weaker deep-layer shear (i.e. 0-6 km bulk shear of 25 kt) was
sampled farther south at GYX. This variance in shear matches
previous expectations and continues to place the greatest severe
risk across northern ME. 

An initially more cellular mode has trended towards a more
cell-in-line mode over the last hour or so. Even so, the
environmental conditions favor a continued threat for strong to
severe storms. Strong downbursts remain the greatest risk,
particularly as mid-level flow gradually strengthens. There is
enough low-level shear (i.e. 0-1 km 15 to 20 kt) to support a brief
tornado as well.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 521
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
225 PM EDT Thu Jul 17 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Western and Northern Maine
  Northern and Central New Hampshire
  Far Northern New York
  Northern and Central Vermont

* Effective this Thursday afternoon and evening from 225 PM until
  900 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 65 mph possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Scattered thunderstorms are forecast to develop and
intensify this afternoon across the Watch area.  A couple of
transient supercells are possible as well as a few organized
multicells.  The primary severe hazard will be strong to severe
gusts (50-65 mph) capable of wind damage, but a tornado is possible
with the more intense transient supercells.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 75
statute miles east and west of a line from 20 miles north northwest
of Caribou ME to 15 miles south southwest of Montpelier VT. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU1).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1 inch. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 55 knots. A few
cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 400. Mean storm motion vector
23030.

0350 PM CDT Tue Jul 15 2025

Areas affected...northeastern Nevada...northern Utah...southeastern
Idaho...and southwestern Wyoming

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 152050Z - 152315Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Storms will increase in coverage and intensity through the
afternoon, posing a threat of dry microburst winds.  Convective
trends will be monitored for the possibility of a watch.

DISCUSSION...A glancing influence from the shortwave trough to the
north is resulting in some large-scale ascent and an increase in
midlevlel winds this afternoon.  Initial storms are increasing in
coverage and intensity across northeastern Nevada, and this activity
is expected to spread east-northeastward through the afternoon into
southwestern Wyoming.  The 17Z DPG sounding characterizes the very
steep lapse rates (near dry adiabatic up to around 500 mb) in which
these storms are forming.  This environment will support very strong
downdrafts and dry-microburst potential.  Recent VWPs from Salt Lake
City indicate around 30 knots of mid-to-upper-level flow, which may
support some storm organization and propagation.  If storms are able
to organize into clusters, a severe thunderstorm watch may be
considered.

Mesoscale Discussion 1676
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0312 PM CDT Tue Jul 15 2025

Areas affected...eastern Idaho...southern Montana...and
northern/central Wyoming

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 152012Z - 152215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Storms are expected to increase in coverage and intensity
through the afternoon posing a risk of severe hail and winds. 
Convective trends will be monitored for the possibility of a watch.

DISCUSSION...Large-scale ascent ahead of a midlevel trough (evident
over the northern Intermountain West in water vapor imagery) is
resulting in thunderstorm development over portions of eastern Idaho
and southwestern Montana.  As this ascent overspreads Wyoming where
better instability is developing, storms are expected to intensify
and organize later this afternoon into the evening.  

Recent VWPs from the Pocatello radar indicate that midlevel westerly
flow has increased to around 40 knots as this disturbance
approaches.  Consequently, there should be enough shear for some
storm organization despite limited instability.  Steep midlevel
lapse rates may support some hail threat with the initial updraft
cores, but the primary threat will be severe winds, as these storms
are developing and moving into deep, well-mixed boundary layers. 
This environment will favor strong evaporative cooling and
dry-microburst potential.  If storms are able to grow upscale into
clusters, a more organized severe-wind threat may materialize
warranting watch issuance.

Mesoscale Discussion 1675
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0258 PM CDT Tue Jul 15 2025

Areas affected...south-central South Dakota into much of central
Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 151958Z - 152230Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Storms will erupt across south-central South Dakota into
northern and west-central Nebraska in the next 1-2 hours, producing
large hail initially followed by damaging winds.

DISCUSSION...A cold front stretches from east-central SD into
western NE and far eastern CO, with a surface low over western NE.
Satellite imagery shows strong heating and building CU fields along
the front and near the low, and this is where initiation will occur.

Deep-layer lapse rates continue to steepen as a midlevel wave
approaches from the west, and surface temperatures warm. When
combined with mid to upper 60s F dewpoints, moderately strong
instability is noted with MLCAPE to around 3000 J/kg.

Modest westerlies aloft combined with a persistent southerly
boundary-layer winds will support southeastward-moving storms. A few
supercells producing damaging hail are possible initially, but an
evolution to severe MCS is anticipated from late afternoon through
evening. Corridors of significant wind damage may occur.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 514
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
350 PM CDT Tue Jul 15 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Northern Kansas
  Western and Central Nebraska
  Southeast South Dakota

* Effective this Tuesday afternoon and evening from 350 PM until
  1100 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 80
    mph likely
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
    inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Scattered thunderstorms are forecast to develop along a
front this afternoon into the evening and grow upscale into a linear
cluster.  Large hail will be the primary severe hazard this
afternoon before storms increase in coverage and congeal into one or
two linear clusters.  Severe gusts will become the primary severe
hazard during the evening as this activity moves east-southeast
across the Watch area.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 85
statute miles east and west of a line from 35 miles east northeast
of Chamberlain SD to 20 miles south southeast of Mccook NE. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU4).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

Mesoscale Discussion 1670
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0318 PM CDT Mon Jul 14 2025

Areas affected...eastern Wyoming...southwestern South Dakota...and
Nebraska Panhandle

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 142018Z - 142215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Storms are expected to increase in coverage and intensity
through the afternoon and evening.  Convective trends will be
monitored for the possibility of a severe thunderstorm watch.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms initiated early this afternoon over the
higher terrain of Wyoming, as ascent associated with an approaching
midlevel shortwave trough overspreads the area.  Continued
initiation over the higher terrain along with new initiation farther
east along the a surface pressure trough will eventually pose a
severe-weather threat later this afternoon and evening.  

Although low-level moisture is mixing out across much of the area
this afternoon (upper 40s to low 50s F 2-m Td), very steep low-level
and midlevel lapse rates (per 18Z UNR sounding) are still resulting
in over 1000 J/kg of MLCAPE.  The inverted-v thermodynamic profiles
across the region will support an isolated dry-microburst threat for
the strongest storms.  For a more organized severe threat,
deep-layer shear is marginally supportive and strongest (around 30
knots) with northward extent into northeastern Wyoming and
southwestern South Dakota.  The latest CAM guidance suggests some
potential for upscale growth of convection into clusters posing an
organized severe-wind threat.  Convective trends will be monitored
for this scenario and the possibility of a watch.

Areas affected...southeastern Georgia into northern/central Florida

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 141918Z - 142145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms are expected to increase in coverage and
intensity through the afternoon, posing an isolated threat of
damaging winds.  A severe thunderstorm watch is unlikely.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms have initiated on low-level convergence
boundaries across the region this afternoon in a hot, unstable
(~2500 J/kg MLCAPE) airmass.  While upper-tropospheric flow is weak
(per XMR 14Z sounding), enhanced low-to-midlevel northerly flow on
the west side of the low off the Atlantic coast may help storm
organization.  Local VWPs indicate around 25-30 knots of flow
between 700 and 500 mb, which may help to organize
southward-to-south-southwestward-propagating clusters as cold pools
begin to merge.  These storms will pose a damaging-wind threat this
afternoon, but the impacts are expected to be too isolated to
warrant a watch.

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 132041Z - 132245Z

SUMMARY...Storms with locally damaging winds are possible through
the remainder of the afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Some increase in storm coverage and intensity has been
noted within a very moist and strongly buoyant environment across
east-central TX, along a composite outflow to the east of a
well-defined MCV over central TX. Deep-layer shear is relatively
weak, but modest southwesterly low/midlevel flow attendant to the
MCV and further outflow consolidation could result in a
northeastward-moving storm cluster that will move toward the
ArkLaTex region through the remainder of the afternoon. Such a
cluster could be accompanied by isolated damaging winds. Additional
storm development will be possible ahead of this developing cluster
into northeast TX and southwest AR, which may also be capable of
producing localized downbursts.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms have initiated over the high terrain this
afternoon across the region.  While moisture is meager for this time
of year, it is sufficient to support 500-1000 J/kg of MLCAPE and
robust updrafts.  The 18Z Tucson sounding represents the
characteristic well-mixed, inverted-V sounding profiles across the
region.  Certainly, this environment will support dry-microburst
potential for the strongest storms.  With northeasterly midlevel
flow expected to increase this afternoon and evening, a more
organized wind threat could develop and move south-southwestward off
the higher terrain.  Convective trends will continue to be monitored
for the possibility of watch issuance.

Mesoscale Discussion 1662
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0241 PM CDT Sun Jul 13 2025

Areas affected...Parts of central/eastern VA...central MD...the
eastern WV Panhandle

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 131941Z - 132115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated damaging wind remains possible through late
afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Earlier convection across MD and eastern VA has
generated a westward-moving outflow approaching central VA.
Meanwhile, other storms have developed this afternoon along/east of
the Blue Ridge. Deep-layer flow is quite weak across the region,
resulting in generally disorganized storms. However, strong heating
of a very moist airmass (PW around 2 inches) has resulted in MLCAPE
increasing above 3000 J/kg in areas outside of convective outflow.
The large PW and favorable buoyancy will support a threat of
localized wet microbursts, both with storms along the
westward-moving outflow, and the storms moving slowly eastward off
of the Blue Ridge. Outflow collisions may result in brief upticks in
storm intensity through the remainder of the afternoon.

Mesoscale Discussion 1661
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0214 PM CDT Sun Jul 13 2025

Areas affected...eastern Florida peninsula

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 131914Z - 132145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms are expected to continue developing and
moving southward through the afternoon posing an isolated damaging
wind threat.  A severe thunderstorm watch is unlikely.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms continue to develop along the eastern
peninsula of Florida in a very moist and unstable environment. 
While the deep-layer flow/shear is weak (per XMR 15Z sounding),
there does appear to be enhanced north-northwesterly low-level flow
likely associated with the midlevel low off the east coast of
Florida.  As a result, 0-3 km northerly shear is around 20 knots
(per MLB VWP), which is at least modestly supportive of
southward-propagating clusters capable of producing severe, damaging
wind gusts through the afternoon.  The localized, isolated nature of
the threat will preclude watch issuance.
