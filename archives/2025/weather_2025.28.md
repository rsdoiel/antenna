Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0341 PM CDT Fri Jul 18 2025

Valid 201200Z - 261200Z

A mid/upper-level tough is forecast to deepen across the Pacific
Northwest Day 3/Sunday into Day 4/Monday. Thereafter, the evolution
of the trough is somewhat uncertain, largely due to
inter/intra-model variability. Though, many recent solutions now
suggest some form of splitting with a portion of the trough ejecting
across the northern Rockies and another becoming cutoff (or
redeveloping) off/near the coast of California/Oregon through the
remainder of the week. 

...Day 3/Sunday - Day 5/Tuesday: Wind/RH...
Increasing mid-level winds - associated with the aforementioned
trough - will promote a broadening area of dry/breezy southwesterly
flow Day 3/Sunday across portions of the northern Great Basin, far
northeastern California, southeastern Oregon, and southwest Montana.
At this time, locally critical conditions appear most likely across
wind-prone areas of the Snake River Plain in Idaho. 

Fire weather conditions are forecast to shift a bit southward while
also increasing in coverage and intensity Day 4/Monday, as the
aforementioned trough continues to deepen. While an area of critical
fire weather conditions appears probable, relatively poor run-to-run
model consistency precludes increasing critical probabilities to 70%
at this time.  
 
Dry/breezy conditions are forecast to linger into Day 5/Tuesday
across the Great Basin. Though, relaxing mid-level winds and reduced
surface pressure gradients should promote lighter surface winds and
locally elevated fire weather conditions.

...Day 4/Monday - Day 5/Tuesday: Dry Thunderstorms...
Isolated dry thunderstorms are possible Day 4/Monday into Day
5/Tuesday across portions of northern Great Basin, Northwest, and
northern Rockies, as increasing moisture associated with the
aforementioned trough impinges on the area. While forecast guidance
suggests precipitable water values may be relatively high (0.8 - 1+
inch), somewhat fast-moving storm motions and critically receptive
fuels suggest a mix of wet/dry modes. At this time, uncertainty
remains too large to introduce probabilities for dry thunderstorms.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0224 PM CDT Fri Jul 18 2025

Valid 182000Z - 191200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE CENTRAL PLAINS INTO THE MIDWEST AND PARTS OF THE MID-ATLANTIC...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms with large hail, damaging winds, and
a couple of tornadoes are possible across parts of the Corn Belt in
Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, and South Dakota this evening into
tonight. Scattered damaging winds are possible across parts of
Virginia and North Carolina this afternoon.

...20Z Update...
The primary change to the Day 1 20Z Convective Outlook update was to
make minor eastward expansions of wind probabilities into eastern
IA, as some of the latest convection allowing guidance depicts an
MCS persisting into this region. Otherwise, the previous forecast
(see below) remains on track, with very small adjustments made to
thunder/severe probabilities to account for observational trends
and/or guidance consensus updates.

..Squitieri.. 07/18/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1106 AM CDT Fri Jul 18 2025/

...Virginia/North Carolina to the Mid-South...
Late morning surface analysis places a stationary front draped from
west to east from the mid MS Valley eastward into the Mid-Atlantic
states.  Visible satellite/radar mosaic imagery shows a couple of
weak MCVs moving east over the northern VA/MD vicinity and over far
eastern KY.  The latter disturbance will probably prove instrumental
in aiding storm development across VA into northern NC this
afternoon.  

South of the front, rich low-level moisture and heating will act to
offset weak mid-level lapse rates and yield moderate to strong
buoyancy from southeast MO eastward to the Mid-Atlantic coast. 
Early indications of a swelling cumulus field over the WV/VA
mountains will gradually evolve into a cluster of storms as
convective inhibition continues to erode through early afternoon. 
Other clusters of storms will develop and move west to east given
marginal deep-layer mean westerly flow.  Although small hail
0.50-1.00 inch in diameter is possible with the strongest cores, the
primary hazard with the stronger storms will be damaging gusts
(50-65 mph) with the more intense water-loaded downdrafts.  This
activity will likely diminish by the early to mid evening.

...South Dakota/Nebraska into Minnesota/Iowa...
Gradual low-level moistening is forecast through this evening ahead
of a weak front forecast to be in place over the eastern Dakotas
into western NE.  An initially appreciable capping inversion will
inhibit surface-based storm development until heating gradually
weakens inhibition by late afternoon.  A very unstable airmass is
forecast by late afternoon/early evening, but nebulous forcing lends
uncertainty in terms of storm development/timing.  Models suggest
storms will primarily develop this evening associated with
strengthening low-level theta-e advection.  Supercells are possible
early in the convective life cycle with a risk for all hazards,
including the possibility for a couple of tornadoes, but large hail
may be the main hazard.  Upscale growth into a cluster or MCS is
possible near the terminus of a southwesterly 850-mb LLJ with severe
gusts the becoming the primary threat.  Models vary considerably
whether storm intensity is maintained through much of the overnight
and beyond the Day-1 period, or if a gradual diminishing in severe
occurs.  

...Great Basin into Wyoming and Far Southern Montana...
Initially high-based convection should develop this afternoon across
parts of the Great Basin into WY as modest ascent associated with a
weak/low-amplitude mid-level impulse spreads eastward across these
areas.  Steep low/mid-level lapse rates and a deep, very well-mixed
boundary layer should support isolated severe gusts with the
stronger thunderstorms.  Somewhat greater low-level moisture should
be present this afternoon across parts of southern MT into
northern/eastern WY, generally along/east of the Bighorn/Laramie
Mountains. Isolated severe hail may occur with marginal supercells
given greater instability/shear forecast across these areas.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0219 PM CDT Fri Jul 18 2025

Valid 201200Z - 211200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE MID
ATLANTIC WESTWARD ACROSS OHIO VALLEY AND INTO THE NORTHERN PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong storms with at least isolated severe potential will
be possible from the Mid Atlantic into Ohio and Missouri Valleys and
central Plains Sunday into Sunday night.

...Synopsis...
A large area of cyclonic flow aloft will exist over the Northeast as
an upper low moves southeastward across Quebec. To the south, and
upper high will be centered over the Gulf Coast states, with an
enhanced belt of midlevel westerlies across the Midwest.

At the surface, a cold front will push southeastward across New
England and toward the Mid Atlantic by late afternoon, with the
western extension of this same boundary stalling into the Mid MO
Valley.

A very moist air mass will exist ahead of the main front, aiding
episodes of strong storms from southern New England/Mid Atlantic
Coast area, the OH Valley, and from SD into NE.

...Mid Atlantic/Northeast...
Scattered thunderstorms are likely in association with the cold
front beginning relatively early in the day. The air mass will be
very moist, and heating will result in up to 1500 J/kg MUCAPE prior
to the front moving offshore late in the day. Forecast soundings
indicate poor lapse rates aloft, but strong gusts may occur with
fast moving clusters of storms as far south as NJ.

...Central to northern Plains...
A surface trough will deepen from eastern MT into western SD/NE/KS,
with strong heating. Southeast surface winds will maintain moisture
into the Dakotas and NE, with locally strong instability developing
within a narrow uncapped zone. A few storms capable of large hail
and localized wind damage may occur from late afternoon into early
evening. Storm motions should remain relatively slow and severe
threat localized as shear will remain marginal this far south. A
small Slight Risk could be needed in later outlooks as precision
increases.

...OH Valley...
Early day storms near/north of the elongated front may linger across
parts of IL/IN/OH, with a diurnal uptick as heating occurs from near
St. Louis eastward across KY and into western VA. Poor lapse rates
aloft and modest westerlies aloft suggest only localized severe
potential within the broader thunderstorm area, with a few damaging
downbursts possible.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0152 PM CDT Fri Jul 18 2025

Valid 191200Z - 201200Z

Tomorrow's (Day 2/Saturday) fire weather forecast remains largely
on-track, with only modest areal adjustments needed to the outlook
areas based on the latest ensemble forecast guidance. The primary
change with this update was to expand the Elevated area across the
northern Great Basin a bit farther north/northeast into southwest
Montana and also westward into portions of northern California and
southeast Oregon. Locally critical conditions are most likely across
the wind-prone portions of the Snake River Plain and Upper Snake
River Valley in Idaho, where localized areas of sustained surface
winds exceeding 20 mph and RH values less than 15% are possible for
several hours during the afternoon/evening.

Please see the discussion below for more information on tomorrow's
fire weather forecast.

..Elliott.. 07/18/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1218 AM CDT Fri Jul 18 2025/

...Synopsis...
A low-amplitude upper level trough will pivot through the Northwest
on Saturday. In the lee of the northern Rockies, a surface low will
deepen in central Montana. Mid-level moisture will be pushed
slightly southward and eastward by the sagging upper trough in the
Northwest. Additional thunderstorms are possible in the parts of the
central/eastern Great Basin. However, PWAT values and slower storm
motions do not suggest a significant threat for new ignitions.

...Columbia Basin and northern Nevada/southern Idaho...
Elevated fire weather conditions are again expected in the Columbia
Basin. With the core of the mid-level jet primarily being east of
the region by the afternoon, the overall setup should favor slightly
less strong wind coverage. Winds of 15-20 mph are still possible. RH
may be a touch higher than on Friday with around 20% being probable
during the afternoon.

With the trough sagging southward and the surface low deepening, a
zone of 15-20 mph (locally higher) winds is possible in parts of the
northern Great Basin. RH could fall as low as 10-15% by the
afternoon.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1227 PM CDT Fri Jul 18 2025

Valid 191200Z - 201200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM IOWA EASTWARD
TOWARD OHIO...AND OVER THE CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe storms are possible over parts of the Midwest, and
over the central High Plains. Areas of damaging winds and hail will
be possible.

...Midwest...
A conditional and complex severe risk is forecast, beginning
Saturday morning over eastern IA and vicinity. Here, models indicate
an MCS will likely be ongoing, but whether this system persists
across IL and IN during day is uncertain. Most likely, this system
will weaken, which will allow daytime destabilization across the
area. However, redevelopment is also uncertain during the day across
southern WI/IL/IN, and may depend on mesoscale boundaries from
earlier storms. In any event, a moist and unstable air mass will
develop, and conditionally favor severe storms. This will exist
beneath moderate west to northwest flow aloft, and deep-layer shear
may even favor supercells. Any supercells that can develop during
the afternoon or early evening will be capable of large hail,
perhaps a tornado, and damaging gusts. Additional storms are likely
overnight in the warm advection regime from southern IA/northern MO
into western IL.

Farther east and late, west/southwest flow around 850 mb will aid
lift and destabilization with clusters of storms possible from OH
into western PA and NY. Scattered damaging gusts appear to be the
main concern.

...Central High Plains...
High pressure over the northern Plains will maintain moist easterly
surface winds near a stalled front near the KS/NE border, with
moderate instability developing as far west as southeast WY and
northeast CO. Afternoon storms will likely form in this uncapped air
mass over the High Plains, with a few supercells producing large
hail expected. Capping will be a concern farther east, but eventual
outflow production may allow an MCS to develop with damaging winds
spreading into parts of northwest KS and southwest NE.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1110 AM CDT Fri Jul 18 2025

Valid 181700Z - 191200Z

Scattered thunderstorms with a combination of wet/dry modes are
expected across portions of the Northern Great Basin today as
relatively deeper moisture from an upper-low over southern
California impinges on the area. At 12 UTC, the precipitable water
value at Elko, NV was 0.71 inches (near the 90th percentile) and at
Salt Lake City, UT 0.87 inches (near the 80th percentile), with
ensemble guidance suggesting further increases today. Despite the
scattered thunderstorm coverage, new ignitions may be somewhat
limited by the trend toward wetter storm modes. Nevertheless, at
least isolated dry thunderstorms will be possible on the fringe of
the deeper moisture and along the periphery of any stronger storm
cores. Additionally, gusty and erratic outflow winds in excess of 50
mph are possible from nearby thunderstorms - especially across
portions of northeast Nevada, northwest Utah, southeast Idaho,
western Wyoming, and southwest Montana. Please see the latest SPC
Day 1 Convective Outlook for more information on the severe weather
potential in this area. 

Elevated to locally critical fire weather conditions remain possible
this afternoon from the Cascade gaps into the Columbia Basin and
central Oregon. The forecast remains mostly on-track across this
area with only minor adjustments needed based on the latest ensemble
forecast guidance. 

Please see the previous discussion below for more information on
today's fire weather forecast.

..Elliott.. 07/18/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1216 AM CDT Fri Jul 18 2025/

...Synopsis...
Ridging aloft will be present across the southern half of the CONUS
with a belt of stronger mid-level winds within the northern tier
states. A weak upper-level low will remain nearly stationary in
southern California/northern Baja.

...Northwest...
Dry and windy conditions are most likely to occur within the Cascade
gaps eastward into Columbia Basin and central Oregon. Here, surface
winds of 15-20 mph will overlap afternoon RH of 15-20%. Some locally
critical fire weather is possible in the Cascade gaps where winds
will be stronger. However, RH may only briefly fall to critical
levels.

...Northern Great Basin...
Modest mid-level moisture return will be aided by the weak upper low
in southern California. A few dry thunderstorms are possible on the
northern/northwest fringe of the mid-level moisture. Storms may be a
combination of both wet/dry modes due to relatively weak
mid/upper-level flow.

Scattered severe thunderstorms with large hail, damaging winds, and
a couple of tornadoes are possible across parts of the Corn Belt in

Mesoscale Discussion 1701

0348 PM CDT Thu Jul 17 2025

Areas affected...portions of northern and central Montana

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 172048Z - 172245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated to widely scattered thunderstorms are expected
this afternoon and evening. A few supercells capable of hail and
damaging winds are expected. A WW is possible, although it is
uncertain when the severe risk will maximize.

DISCUSSION...Afternoon visible and radar imagery show initial
thunderstorm development is underway across far northern MT and
southern Canada. Aided by synoptic ascent from a shortwave trough
within northwesterly flow and heating along a stalled frontal
boundary, continued convective development is expected over the next
several hours. Modest moisture and somewhat cool surface
temperatures have limited boundary-layer destabilization so far this
afternoon. Still, with little inhibition, weak MLCAPE (500-700 J/kg)
will be sufficient for stronger updrafts. Additional destabilization
is expected as low-level warm advection along the boundary increases
into this evening. Elongated hodographs owing to enhanced
northwesterly flow aloft observed from the 18z TFX RAOB and area
VADs will support a supercell storm mode capable of hail and
isolated damaging gusts.

Despite weaker buoyancy, continued ascent along the stalled front
will likely serve as a focus for storm intensification over the next
couple of hours. This is supported by recent CAM guidance which
shows a few longer-lived supercells into this evening. The exact
timing of the severe risk remains unclear as destabilization
continues and storms may take some time to mature. However, at least
an isolated severe risk should gradually increase over the next few
hours. Given the broadly favorable environment for large hail and
severe gusts, a WW may be needed.

Mesoscale Discussion 1700

Areas affected...Portions of VT...NH...and ME

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 521...

Valid 172040Z - 172245Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 521
continues.

SUMMARY...Threat for damaging gusts and/or a brief tornado or two
continues across portions of VT, NH, and ME.

DISCUSSION...Early afternoon soundings (i.e. 18Z) at CAR and GYX
sampled a moist and unstable airmass across the region, with little
to no convective inhibition. The CAR sounding also sampled moderate
vertical shear (i.e. 0-6 km bulk shear of 43 kt), while notably
weaker deep-layer shear (i.e. 0-6 km bulk shear of 25 kt) was
sampled farther south at GYX. This variance in shear matches
previous expectations and continues to place the greatest severe
risk across northern ME. 

An initially more cellular mode has trended towards a more
cell-in-line mode over the last hour or so. Even so, the
environmental conditions favor a continued threat for strong to
severe storms. Strong downbursts remain the greatest risk,
particularly as mid-level flow gradually strengthens. There is
enough low-level shear (i.e. 0-1 km 15 to 20 kt) to support a brief
tornado as well.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 521
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
225 PM EDT Thu Jul 17 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Western and Northern Maine
  Northern and Central New Hampshire
  Far Northern New York
  Northern and Central Vermont

* Effective this Thursday afternoon and evening from 225 PM until
  900 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 65 mph possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Scattered thunderstorms are forecast to develop and
intensify this afternoon across the Watch area.  A couple of
transient supercells are possible as well as a few organized
multicells.  The primary severe hazard will be strong to severe
gusts (50-65 mph) capable of wind damage, but a tornado is possible
with the more intense transient supercells.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 75
statute miles east and west of a line from 20 miles north northwest
of Caribou ME to 15 miles south southwest of Montpelier VT. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU1).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1 inch. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 55 knots. A few
cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 400. Mean storm motion vector
23030.

Areas affected...northeastern Nevada...northern Utah...southeastern
Idaho...and southwestern Wyoming

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 152050Z - 152315Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Storms will increase in coverage and intensity through the
afternoon, posing a threat of dry microburst winds.  Convective
trends will be monitored for the possibility of a watch.

DISCUSSION...A glancing influence from the shortwave trough to the
north is resulting in some large-scale ascent and an increase in
midlevlel winds this afternoon.  Initial storms are increasing in
coverage and intensity across northeastern Nevada, and this activity
is expected to spread east-northeastward through the afternoon into
southwestern Wyoming.  The 17Z DPG sounding characterizes the very
steep lapse rates (near dry adiabatic up to around 500 mb) in which
these storms are forming.  This environment will support very strong
downdrafts and dry-microburst potential.  Recent VWPs from Salt Lake
City indicate around 30 knots of mid-to-upper-level flow, which may
support some storm organization and propagation.  If storms are able
to organize into clusters, a severe thunderstorm watch may be
considered.

Mesoscale Discussion 1676
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0312 PM CDT Tue Jul 15 2025

Areas affected...eastern Idaho...southern Montana...and
northern/central Wyoming

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 152012Z - 152215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Storms are expected to increase in coverage and intensity
through the afternoon posing a risk of severe hail and winds. 
Convective trends will be monitored for the possibility of a watch.

DISCUSSION...Large-scale ascent ahead of a midlevel trough (evident
over the northern Intermountain West in water vapor imagery) is
resulting in thunderstorm development over portions of eastern Idaho
and southwestern Montana.  As this ascent overspreads Wyoming where
better instability is developing, storms are expected to intensify
and organize later this afternoon into the evening.  

Recent VWPs from the Pocatello radar indicate that midlevel westerly
flow has increased to around 40 knots as this disturbance
approaches.  Consequently, there should be enough shear for some
storm organization despite limited instability.  Steep midlevel
lapse rates may support some hail threat with the initial updraft
cores, but the primary threat will be severe winds, as these storms
are developing and moving into deep, well-mixed boundary layers. 
This environment will favor strong evaporative cooling and
dry-microburst potential.  If storms are able to grow upscale into
clusters, a more organized severe-wind threat may materialize
warranting watch issuance.

Mesoscale Discussion 1675
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0258 PM CDT Tue Jul 15 2025

Areas affected...south-central South Dakota into much of central
Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 151958Z - 152230Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Storms will erupt across south-central South Dakota into
northern and west-central Nebraska in the next 1-2 hours, producing
large hail initially followed by damaging winds.

DISCUSSION...A cold front stretches from east-central SD into
western NE and far eastern CO, with a surface low over western NE.
Satellite imagery shows strong heating and building CU fields along
the front and near the low, and this is where initiation will occur.

Deep-layer lapse rates continue to steepen as a midlevel wave
approaches from the west, and surface temperatures warm. When
combined with mid to upper 60s F dewpoints, moderately strong
instability is noted with MLCAPE to around 3000 J/kg.

Modest westerlies aloft combined with a persistent southerly
boundary-layer winds will support southeastward-moving storms. A few
supercells producing damaging hail are possible initially, but an
evolution to severe MCS is anticipated from late afternoon through
evening. Corridors of significant wind damage may occur.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 514
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
350 PM CDT Tue Jul 15 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Northern Kansas
  Western and Central Nebraska
  Southeast South Dakota

* Effective this Tuesday afternoon and evening from 350 PM until
  1100 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 80
    mph likely
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
    inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Scattered thunderstorms are forecast to develop along a
front this afternoon into the evening and grow upscale into a linear
cluster.  Large hail will be the primary severe hazard this
afternoon before storms increase in coverage and congeal into one or
two linear clusters.  Severe gusts will become the primary severe
hazard during the evening as this activity moves east-southeast
across the Watch area.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 85
statute miles east and west of a line from 35 miles east northeast
of Chamberlain SD to 20 miles south southeast of Mccook NE. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU4).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

Mesoscale Discussion 1670
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0318 PM CDT Mon Jul 14 2025

Areas affected...eastern Wyoming...southwestern South Dakota...and
Nebraska Panhandle

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 142018Z - 142215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Storms are expected to increase in coverage and intensity
through the afternoon and evening.  Convective trends will be
monitored for the possibility of a severe thunderstorm watch.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms initiated early this afternoon over the
higher terrain of Wyoming, as ascent associated with an approaching
midlevel shortwave trough overspreads the area.  Continued
initiation over the higher terrain along with new initiation farther
east along the a surface pressure trough will eventually pose a
severe-weather threat later this afternoon and evening.  

Although low-level moisture is mixing out across much of the area
this afternoon (upper 40s to low 50s F 2-m Td), very steep low-level
and midlevel lapse rates (per 18Z UNR sounding) are still resulting
in over 1000 J/kg of MLCAPE.  The inverted-v thermodynamic profiles
across the region will support an isolated dry-microburst threat for
the strongest storms.  For a more organized severe threat,
deep-layer shear is marginally supportive and strongest (around 30
knots) with northward extent into northeastern Wyoming and
southwestern South Dakota.  The latest CAM guidance suggests some
potential for upscale growth of convection into clusters posing an
organized severe-wind threat.  Convective trends will be monitored
for this scenario and the possibility of a watch.

Areas affected...southeastern Georgia into northern/central Florida

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 141918Z - 142145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms are expected to increase in coverage and
intensity through the afternoon, posing an isolated threat of
damaging winds.  A severe thunderstorm watch is unlikely.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms have initiated on low-level convergence
boundaries across the region this afternoon in a hot, unstable
(~2500 J/kg MLCAPE) airmass.  While upper-tropospheric flow is weak
(per XMR 14Z sounding), enhanced low-to-midlevel northerly flow on
the west side of the low off the Atlantic coast may help storm
organization.  Local VWPs indicate around 25-30 knots of flow
between 700 and 500 mb, which may help to organize
southward-to-south-southwestward-propagating clusters as cold pools
begin to merge.  These storms will pose a damaging-wind threat this
afternoon, but the impacts are expected to be too isolated to
warrant a watch.

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 132041Z - 132245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Storms with locally damaging winds are possible through
the remainder of the afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Some increase in storm coverage and intensity has been
noted within a very moist and strongly buoyant environment across
east-central TX, along a composite outflow to the east of a
well-defined MCV over central TX. Deep-layer shear is relatively
weak, but modest southwesterly low/midlevel flow attendant to the
MCV and further outflow consolidation could result in a
northeastward-moving storm cluster that will move toward the
ArkLaTex region through the remainder of the afternoon. Such a
cluster could be accompanied by isolated damaging winds. Additional
storm development will be possible ahead of this developing cluster
into northeast TX and southwest AR, which may also be capable of
producing localized downbursts.

Mesoscale Discussion 1663
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0338 PM CDT Sun Jul 13 2025

Areas affected...southwestern New Mexico and southeastern Arizona

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 132038Z - 132315Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Storms are expected to increase in coverage and intensity
through the afternoon and into the evening, posing a severe wind
risk.  A severe thunderstorm watch is possible.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms have initiated over the high terrain this
afternoon across the region.  While moisture is meager for this time
of year, it is sufficient to support 500-1000 J/kg of MLCAPE and
robust updrafts.  The 18Z Tucson sounding represents the
characteristic well-mixed, inverted-V sounding profiles across the
region.  Certainly, this environment will support dry-microburst
potential for the strongest storms.  With northeasterly midlevel
flow expected to increase this afternoon and evening, a more
organized wind threat could develop and move south-southwestward off
the higher terrain.  Convective trends will continue to be monitored
for the possibility of watch issuance.

Mesoscale Discussion 1662
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0241 PM CDT Sun Jul 13 2025

Areas affected...Parts of central/eastern VA...central MD...the
eastern WV Panhandle

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 131941Z - 132115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated damaging wind remains possible through late
afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Earlier convection across MD and eastern VA has
generated a westward-moving outflow approaching central VA.
Meanwhile, other storms have developed this afternoon along/east of
the Blue Ridge. Deep-layer flow is quite weak across the region,
resulting in generally disorganized storms. However, strong heating
of a very moist airmass (PW around 2 inches) has resulted in MLCAPE
increasing above 3000 J/kg in areas outside of convective outflow.
The large PW and favorable buoyancy will support a threat of
localized wet microbursts, both with storms along the
westward-moving outflow, and the storms moving slowly eastward off
of the Blue Ridge. Outflow collisions may result in brief upticks in
storm intensity through the remainder of the afternoon.

Mesoscale Discussion 1661
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0214 PM CDT Sun Jul 13 2025

Areas affected...eastern Florida peninsula

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 131914Z - 132145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms are expected to continue developing and
moving southward through the afternoon posing an isolated damaging
wind threat.  A severe thunderstorm watch is unlikely.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms continue to develop along the eastern
peninsula of Florida in a very moist and unstable environment. 
While the deep-layer flow/shear is weak (per XMR 15Z sounding),
there does appear to be enhanced north-northwesterly low-level flow
likely associated with the midlevel low off the east coast of
Florida.  As a result, 0-3 km northerly shear is around 20 knots
(per MLB VWP), which is at least modestly supportive of
southward-propagating clusters capable of producing severe, damaging
wind gusts through the afternoon.  The localized, isolated nature of
the threat will preclude watch issuance.

Mesoscale Discussion 1658
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0329 PM CDT Sat Jul 12 2025

Areas affected...Parts of southern IN...southwest
OH...northern/western KY...far southern IL/southeast MO

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 122029Z - 122200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Locally damaging wind will remain possible through late
afternoon.

DISCUSSION...A compact storm cluster is moving quickly eastward
across southern IN and adjacent western KY late this afternoon.
While convection associated with this cluster is not particularly
well-organized, it has a history of producing localized near-severe
gusts, and also has a relatively strong cold pool. Strong downstream
heating has resulted in MLCAPE increasing above 2500 J/kg and
steepening low-level lapse rates. Deep-layer shear is weak, but
given the favorable buoyancy and presence of a propagating cold
pool, some threat for isolated damaging wind may accompany this
storm cluster as it continues to move eastward. 

Other strong storms are ongoing across parts of western/central OH,
and also along the trailing outflow into far western KY into
southern IL and southeast MO. These storms will be capable of
producing localized damaging downburst winds, given favorable
buoyancy and large PW.

Mesoscale Discussion 1657
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0235 PM CDT Sat Jul 12 2025

Areas affected...central Texas and the Texas Hill Country

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 121935Z - 122130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Widespread thunderstorms will be capable of sporadic
damaging gusts and small hail this afternoon/evening. A WW is not
anticipated.

DISCUSSION...Across portions of west-central TX, numerous
thunderstorms have redeveloped/intensified ahead of a weak cold
front and MCV. Strong diurnal heating of a very moist air mass
(dewpoints in the mid 70s F) is supporting moderate destabilization
despite poor mid-level lapse rates. Numerous thunderstorms with
occasional stronger updrafts are expected. Deep-layer shear is weak
with flow aloft generally blow 20 kt. This should keep storm
organization transient at best. Still, deep, saturated thermodynamic
profiles and PWATS near 1.8-2 inches will favor heavily water-loaded
downdrafts in these storms. This could support sporadic damaging
gusts with wet microbursts, along with small hail and localized
torrential rainfall rates (see WPC MPD: #0660).

Severe potential will be maximized where storm coverage is highest.
This is most likely ahead of the MCV and along the sagging front
across central TX and the western Hill Country. As downdrafts
intensify, gradually consolidation into more persistent clusters
that spread eastward with time is likely. While some severe risk is
possible, the negligible deep-layer shear and localized risk for
damaging gusts and hail suggests a severe watch is unlikely.
