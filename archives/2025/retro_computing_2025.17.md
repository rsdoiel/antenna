## FDISK 1.4.4

date: 2025-04-27, from: FreeDOS News

<div class="markdown_content"><p>Free FDISK is a tool to manage the partitions on disks of up to 2 TiB in size using a Master Boot Record (MBR) partition table. Thanks to Bernd BÃ¶ckmann, there's a new version. This is a bug fix release; from the release notes: "FAT-16 LBA (partition type 0x0e) was incorrectly shown as "FAT32 LBA" when listing logical partitions via the menu. The bug did not occur when using FDISK /info." You can get the new version at <a class="" href="https://github.com/FDOS/fdisk" rel="nofollow">FDISK on GitHub</a>. We've also mirrored the new release in the FreeDOS Files Archive at Ibiblio, under <a class="" href="https://ibiblio.org/pub/micro/pc-stuff/freedos/files/dos/fdisk/1.4.4/" rel="nofollow">/freedos/files/dos/fdisk</a>.</p></div>
