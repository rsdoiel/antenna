## Hetal Vasavada’s Sandwich Bread

date: 2025-07-14, from: Taste of Home

Why pay $6 for a loaf of sandwich bread when you can make one at home for just $2.52? This soft, fluffy bread is my go-to for everything from grilled cheese to French toast. It’s a one-bowl, no-fuss recipe that uses instant yeast. Instant yeast doesn't require blooming or warm liquid, it’s cheaper than active dry yeast, and it has a much longer shelf life. The bread gets its cloud-like texture from a triple proof, which gives it extra time to develop gluten and build structure, resulting in a softer, airier crumb. Each rise allows more gas to form and stretches the dough gently, creating that pillowy texture you want in a good sandwich bread. Brushing the loaf with melted butter before and after baking gives it a golden crust and a glossy finish. It’s a simple step that makes homemade bread taste (and look) bakery-level! —Hetal Vasavada, San Francisco, California

## TRADITIONAL IRISH WEDDING FEASTS: THEN AND NOW – WHAT USED TO BE SERVED AT WEDDINGS VERSUS TODAY

date: 2025-07-14, from: Irish Food Hub

<p>Explore the evolution of Irish wedding banquets, from oatcakes and mead to gourmet lamb and Guinness-infused desserts. A journey through Ireland’s celebratory cuisine, past and present. Table of Contents Introduction: Weddings as Feasts of Tradition The Ancient Wedding Table: Pre-1800s Celebrations Victorian Influences and Rural Banquets (1800s–Early 1900s) Modern Irish Wedding Menus: Local Meets Luxe Fusion and Revival: How Old Traditions Are Returning Introduction: Weddings as Feasts of Tradition Irish weddings have long been more than mere ceremonies—they’ve been community events, celebrations of union and continuity, and above all, feasts of abundance. Food has always played a central role in these joyful gatherings, not just for sustenance but for symbolism, hospitality, and festivity. From humble countryside spreads to lavish banquet hall menus, the Irish wedding feast has evolved alongside society. What was once a table of soda bread, lamb stew, and poitín now often includes oysters, Champagne, and tiered cakes adorned with edible gold. Yet through all the change, one thing remains constant: food brings people together to honour love. Let us now take a journey through Irish wedding cuisine—from ancient customs to the modern farm-to-fork renaissance. Whether you&#8217;re planning your own Irish celebration or simply curious about the cultural roots of these festive meals, you&#8217;ll find plenty to feast on. The Ancient Wedding Table: Pre-1800s Celebrations Before formal menus and printed invitations, traditional Irish weddings—especially in rural and Gaelic communities—were rooted in local customs, seasonal ingredients, and sacred symbolism. The feast was often held in the home of the bride’s family or in communal outdoor gatherings. What mattered most was not refinement, but generosity and togetherness. Key Foods of Ancient Irish Wedding Feasts Oatcakes and Brown Bread: Grain-based breads were staples, often baked fresh by women in the family. Oats symbolized fertility and prosperity. Boiled Meats and Broths: Meat, often mutton or pork, was slow-cooked and shared. In leaner regions, salted fish might take the place of fresh meat. Colcannon and Champ: Simple mashed potato dishes with cabbage or scallions. These were considered hearty and communal, ideal for large gatherings. Buttermilk and Ale: Rather than wine, guests drank homemade mead, ale, or buttermilk—fermented beverages with festive flair. Honey and Berries: Sweet treats were rare but symbolic. Honey, in particular, was associated with abundance and became the root of the “honeymoon” tradition. Customs Around the Table In early Irish society, food was also spiritual. Bread might be blessed by a family elder, and portions of the meal set aside for deceased ancestors. There was no formal seating—guests gathered freely, with music and storytelling flowing between dishes. Though the menu was simple by modern standards, it was a deeply meaningful, rustic celebration of land and kinship. These feasts were more about honouring life’s blessings than displaying wealth. As Ireland entered the 19th century, the structure of wedding celebrations changed—but many of these ancient flavors and customs would linger for generations to come. Victorian Influences and Rural Banquets (1800s–Early 1900s) As Ireland moved through the 19th century, wedding traditions began to absorb Victorian influences—especially in wealthier or urban households. At the same time, in rural Ireland, time-honoured practices persisted. This era saw a blend of rustic charm and rising aspiration, where weddings reflected a family’s status and hospitality. Popular Dishes at Rural Irish Weddings Roast Goose or Chicken: For families who could afford it, poultry—especially goose—was a wedding-day delicacy, often served with potatoes and root vegetables. Potato Farls and Boxty: These versatile potato-based cakes were easy to prepare in large batches and could be fried or baked. Stewed Rabbit or Mutton: Readily available meats like rabbit were slow-cooked in hearty stews and served with thick gravy and crusty bread. Apple Tart and Rhubarb Pie: Homemade fruit tarts became a mainstay dessert, using what was seasonally available in cottage gardens. Tea and Fruitcake: A Victorian influence that took root, fruitcakes were rich, spiced, and often soaked in whiskey—an early version of the Irish wedding cake we know today. Drink and Celebration Whiskey became more central to Irish wedding feasts during this time, especially for toasts. Tea—newly popularized—was served alongside desserts, symbolizing both comfort and status. The feast might last all day, especially in rural areas where guests walked or rode carts from miles around. There were also unique customs such as the “bride’s portion”—a plate of food saved for the bride while she mingled—and dancing that often spilled out into courtyards or barns. The wedding meal was not only nourishment but a statement of generosity and pride. As the 20th century approached, more structured receptions would emerge, but the heart of the Irish wedding feast—warmth, music, and local food—remained firmly in place. Modern Irish Wedding Menus: Local Meets Luxe Today’s Irish wedding feasts are a refined blend of tradition and contemporary taste. Whether hosted in historic castles, boutique hotels, or countryside estates, modern receptions emphasize quality, presentation, and local ingredients. Couples often work with chefs to design bespoke menus that reflect both heritage and personality. What’s on the Menu Today? Starter Courses: Think smoked salmon on brown bread, crab claws with garlic butter, wild mushroom soup, or goat cheese tartlets with beetroot. Main Dishes: Rack of lamb, fillet of beef with red wine jus, pan-seared hake, or vegetarian risotto made with Irish blue cheese and seasonal veg. Accompaniments: Creamy mashed potatoes, buttered baby carrots, roast root vegetables, and fresh sourdough rolls are commonly served. Desserts: Individual pavlovas, chocolate fondants, Baileys cheesecake, and apple tart with custard often top the list. Drinks and Pairings Wine pairings are now standard, alongside Champagne or prosecco for the toast. But Irish craft beers, gins, and whiskeys are also having a moment—many couples offer a tasting tray of local spirits. Mead has even made a comeback in artisan form, linking back to ancient customs. The Irish Wedding Cake Fruitcake remains traditional for the base layer, often soaked in whiskey and covered in almond paste and fondant. However, modern cakes may include tiers of chocolate biscuit cake, lemon sponge, or red velvet. Sugar flowers and Celtic patterns offer</p>
