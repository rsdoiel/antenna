Mesoscale Discussion 0700
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0348 PM CDT Mon May 05 2025

Areas affected...portions of southeastern Texas

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 225...

Valid 052048Z - 052215Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 225
continues.

SUMMARY...The severe threat continues across Severe Thunderstorm
Watch 225. Large hail remains the main concern, but a tornado could
still occur if a supercell can become surface based.

DISCUSSION...Multiple supercell structures have developed across
southeast Texas, and have been progressing eastward on the immediate
cool side of a baroclinic zone. These supercells are likely still
elevated, and given adequate buoyancy above 700 mb (per RAP forecast
soundings), severe hail could still occur given elongated mid to
upper-level hodographs and corresponding 50+ kts of effective bulk
shear. Closer to the Gulf Coast, multiple thunderstorms continue to
intensify within a WAA regime. These storms are associated with a
relatively more unstable, surface-based airmass. Regional VADs on
the warm side of the baroclinic boundary show low-level hodographs
with modest size and curvature, with around 300 m2/s2 SRH present
(per 19Z mesoanalysis). It is unclear if these storms can organize
and intensify into mature surface-based supercells before reaching
the cool side of the baroclinic boundary. If they do though, a
tornado remains possible.

Mesoscale Discussion 0699
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0311 PM CDT Mon May 05 2025

Areas affected...east-central and southeast FL

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 224...

Valid 052011Z - 052215Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 224
continues.

SUMMARY...Potential for isolated large hail and localized severe
gusts should persist through early to mid evening across southeast
and east-central Florida.

DISCUSSION...Several cells across southeast FL have somewhat
weakened after earlier producing large hail reported up to ping-pong
ball size. This activity may still produce marginal hail/wind as
storms oscillate in the near-term. Large-scale convective outflow
has surged south and west, potentially serving as a focus for storm
development in the interior peninsula into early evening. 

Farther north, the Melbourne VWP has consistently sampled around
40-45 kt 0-6 km shear. Although thunderstorm development has been
subdued to an extent, additional storms may yet form along the
Atlantic sea breeze to the quasi-stationary front. Ample buoyancy
will favor isolated large hail and localized severe gusts.

Mesoscale Discussion 0697
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0210 PM CDT Mon May 05 2025

Areas affected...eastern NC and southeast VA

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 223...

Valid 051910Z - 052115Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 223
continues.

SUMMARY...A mixed severe hail/damaging wind threat should persist
across eastern North Carolina and advance/shift north-northeast
across southeast Virginia through early evening.

DISCUSSION...Numerous cells have been prevalent, especially across
central into eastern NC this afternoon. Here, a south-southwesterly
deep-layer wind profile, per area VWPs, along with transient
supercell structures has resulted in convection largely progressing
northeastward thus far. But activity should pivot to a greater
northerly component given the evolution of the upstream vort
max/attendant mid-level jetlet. Air mass appears to be modestly
unstable downstream across southeast VA with MLCAPE of 1000-1500
J/kg. This should help sustain a severe hail/damaging wind threat
through early evening. Despite numerous cells and hail reports, peak
severe magnitude has only reached 1 inch thus far.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0214 PM CDT Mon May 05 2025

Valid 071200Z - 081200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE EDWARDS
PLATEAU TO SOUTHEAST TEXAS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe storms are possible from the Edwards Plateau to
Southeast Texas.

...Edwards Plateau to Southeast Texas...
A stalled front will exist across southern Texas on Wednesday.
Strong surface heating will lead to strong instability along this
front in an environment featuring long, straight hodographs. Forcing
will be somewhat nebulous along the front, but with uncapped
forecast soundings and neutral to slightly falling heights along the
frontal zone, expect at least isolated supercell development. Any
supercells which develop will pose a threat for large to potentially
very large hail. Storm coverage precludes higher probabilities at
this time. 

If the front/composite outflow boundary remains onshore across the
central Gulf Coast, the Marginal Risk may need to be expanded into
this region. However, at this time, there is significant uncertainty
how Day 2 convection will evolve which will impact the front/outflow
location across Louisiana and southern Mississippi. 

...Oklahoma...
A weak cold front is forecast to move south through Oklahoma during
the day Wednesday. Diurnal destabilization ahead of the front could
provide ample instability for a few thunderstorms. Moisture quality
along the front is uncertain which precludes a Marginal Risk at this
time. However, if low to mid 60s dewpoints appear likely ahead of
the front, sufficient instability would exist beneath the cold air
aloft to support severe weather probabilities.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0249 PM CDT Mon May 05 2025

Valid 052000Z - 061200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS PORTIONS OF THE
SOUTHERN PLAINS...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS PARTS OF THE UPPER
OHIO VALLEY/MID-ATLANTIC...AND PARTS OF THE EASTERN FLORIDA
PENINSULA...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are expected across southeast New Mexico into
Texas this afternoon into tonight. Scattered large to very large
hail and severe winds are the primary threats, though a few
tornadoes are also possible. Additional strong to severe
thunderstorms should occur across the upper Ohio Valley/Mid-Atlantic
and the eastern Florida Peninsula this afternoon and evening.

...20z Update...
Minor adjustments were made to the D1 Outlook to extend the Slight
Risk further south and east across portions of south-central Texas
near the Houston Metro. A persistent supercell has been shifting
south and east along a boundary of more favorable CAPE, producing
large hail. Additional thunderstorms may traverse this region
through the afternoon/evening posing some risk for severe wind and
hail. 

Additional development across portions of western Texas and
southeastern New Mexico is expected to intensify late
afternoon/evening. The Slight was expanded northwestward to account
for latest trends in storm development. See MCD#696 for more
information. 

See previous discussion below for more information.

..Thornton/Gleason.. 05/05/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1130 AM CDT Mon May 05 2025/

...Southern Plains...
Generally elevated convection is ongoing late this morning from
portions of northwest to south-central TX. This activity is largely
being driven by low-level warm/moist advection atop a surface front.
Given the presence of steep mid-level lapse rates and strong
effective bulk shear, some of these thunderstorms should continue to
pose a threat for mainly isolated large hail in the short term. If
the convection across south-central TX can persist through the
afternoon, it will have some chance to become surface based and pose
a greater threat for hail, damaging winds, and perhaps a tornado
with eastward extent towards the Gulf Coast, as the surface front
attempts to lift slowly northward. Severe probabilities have been
expanded eastward some to account for this potential.

Farther west, a closed mid/upper-level low will move slowly eastward
across the Southwest through the period. Difluent flow aloft will
encourage weak lee cyclogenesis across far west TX through this
evening, and low-level moisture will continue to stream
northwestward along/south of a front across south-central/west TX
into southeast NM. Moderate to locally strong instability will
likely be in place by late afternoon along/east of a surface dryline
across far west TX, and south of the front. There is still a fair
amount of uncertainty regarding the timing of robust convective
initiation across the southern High Plains, as stronger mid-level
height falls/ascent attendant to the upper low begin to overspread
the warm sector mainly this evening.

Even with this continued uncertainty, it appears likely that several
supercells will erupt by no later than this evening across southeast
NM into parts of west and south-central TX. Given a rather favorable
thermodynamic and kinematic environment, along with steep mid-level
lapse rates, very large hail will be a concern with these
supercells. A strengthening southeasterly low-level jet through the
evening will also act to increase low-level shear and provide
enhanced boundary-layer hodograph curvature/elongation. The threat
for a few tornadoes with any sustained supercell remains apparent.
The potential for convection to grow upscale into one or more
clusters this evening/overnight remains uncertain. Still, some
threat for severe winds will exist with any supercell or clusters.
Based on latest guidance trends, the Enhanced Risk has been expanded
southeastward towards Del Rio.

...Upper Ohio Valley/Mid-Atlantic to Eastern North Carolina...
A closed upper low will remain centered over the OH Valley today. A
mid-level shortwave trough and attendant jet is forecast to move
northward from the Carolinas to the southern Mid-Atlantic through
the afternoon and evening. Large-scale ascent will likely encourage
scattered thunderstorms to form generally along and west of a
surface front that arcs from southeast VA to western/central PA.
Daytime heating of a modestly moist low-level airmass and cool
temperatures aloft associated with the upper low should aid in the
development of around 500-1500 J/kg of MLCAPE by mid afternoon
across parts of the upper OH Valley into the southern Mid-Atlantic
and eastern NC. Even though low-level flow will tend to remain
fairly muted, southeasterly winds near the surface are forecast to
gradually veer to southerly and strengthen with height at mid/upper
levels. This should support sufficient deep-layer shear for
organized convection. A mix of multicells and supercells are
anticipated, with a threat for scattered large hail and damaging
winds as they spread northward through the afternoon and evening.
Based on latest observational and guidance trends, some westward and
southward expansions have been made to the Slight Risk across these
regions.

...Florida Peninsula...
Much of the FL Peninsula will remain displaced south of the stronger
mid/upper-level flow and forcing associated with an upper low over
the OH Valley today. Still, seasonably cool temperatures aloft
combined with modest enhancement to the mid-level westerlies should
foster adequate instability and deep-layer shear to support modest
updraft organization. Thunderstorms are expected to preferentially
favor the Atlantic Coast sea breeze today, with a stalled front over
the central FL Peninsula also serving as a potential low-level
forcing mechanism. Any convection which does develop may pose a
threat for severe hail and damaging winds before it moves offshore
by early evening. Given increased confidence in scattered to
numerous thunderstorms, along with long/straight hodographs aloft, a
Slight Risk for hail has been added for parts of the eastern FL
Peninsula with this update.

...Western Dakotas...
Even with low-level moisture remaining limited across the northern
Plains today, weak instability should develop by this afternoon in a
narrow zone focused along a front extending across the western
Dakotas. Widely scattered thunderstorms should initiate along this
boundary by this afternoon as glancing large-scale ascent from a
shortwave trough over the Canadian Prairie provinces overspreads the
region. A well-mixed boundary layer and steep lapse rates should
promote efficient momentum transfer with downdrafts, and isolated
strong to severe winds and perhaps some hail may occur with
pulse-type and loosely organized clusters.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0238 PM CDT Mon May 05 2025

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

Locally elevated fire weather conditions, particularly along leeward
terrain features across far western Texas, are still expected
Tuesday afternoon. However, widespread fire weather threat should be
limited as surface pressure gradients weaken, flow aloft relaxes,
and a mid-level trough translates eastward into the Southern Plains.
See previous discussion below for more information.

..Williams.. 05/05/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0200 AM CDT Mon May 05 2025/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather potential appears limited for Tuesday across the
country. Residual dry/windy conditions are possible across parts of
southwest TX and far southern NM as a westerly downslope flow regime
becomes established with the eastward departure of a deepening
surface low. Elevated fire weather conditions will be possible,
especially on the leeward side of more prominent terrain features
where downslope winds and drying may be enhanced. While most
solutions agree on the general flow regime, disparity in the wind
speed forecast among deterministic models and ensemble guidance
limits confidence in the potential for a sustained fire weather
threat.

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS NORTHWEST
TEXAS...AND CENTRAL TEXAS INTO THE SABINE VALLEY...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are possible from portions of the southern
Plains into the lower Mississippi Valley on Tuesday. Severe winds,
large to very large hail, and a few tornadoes are possible.
Additional isolated strong to severe storms capable of large hail
and isolated wind damage are possible within parts of the northern
Mid-Atlantic states.

...Synopsis...
A mid-level blocking pattern will start to break down during the day
2 period with the mid-level low in the Southwest and the Ohio Valley
starting to advance east-northeast. A weak surface low will linger
near the eastern Great Lakes through the period on Tuesday. Broad
low pressure will persist across Texas with a sharpening dryline
during the afternoon across central Texas and a warm front extending
from northeast Texas into northern Louisiana and southern
Mississippi. 

...Mid Atlantic to Northeast...
Upper 50s to near 60s dewpoints will advect north across parts of
the Mid-Atlantic and into the Northeast on Tuesday. This, combined
with some surface heating and cool temperatures aloft beneath the
upper low, should support weak to moderate instability. Scattered
strong to severe storms are expected during the afternoon/early
evening with a threat for large hail and damaging wind gusts. 

...Central/Eastern Texas into LA and southern MS...
A cluster of supercells or MCS will likely be ongoing at the
beginning of the period across central Texas. This will continue to
pose a threat for large hail and severe wind gusts through the
morning as it moves along a warm front in the region. As the warm
front continues to advect inland, destabilization will occur ahead
of this ongoing convection. This will likely result in additional
development along the warm front and also on the southern end of the
ongoing activity. Strong shear will support supercells capable of
large hail and severe wind gusts. In addition, a few tornadoes are
possible with any supercells which can remain rooted within the warm
sector.

In the wake of the morning activity in central Texas, surface
heating is expected along the dryline in central Texas during the
afternoon. It is unclear whether substantial recovery will occur for
additional supercell development in this region during the
afternoon/evening, but if supercells develop they will pose a threat
for large to very large hail and severe wind gusts.  

...Northwest Texas Vicinity...
As morning convection/cloud cover clears out to the northeast,
substantial heating may occur beneath the upper low for some
low-topped supercell development along an occluded front which will
extend from central Texas into northwest Texas. These storms will be
capable of large hail and perhaps a brief tornado. 

...South Texas...
Isolated supercells are possible along the dryline Tuesday
afternoon/evening. Extreme instability and very strong shear will
support supercells capable of very large hail with any sustained
supercells that form. However, only weak height falls during the
afternoon and limited convergence along the dryline, as low-level
flow veers across the warm sector, should keep supercells
development isolated. The HRRR has more robust convective
development with storms off higher terrain in northern Mexico and
additional development in South Texas. Should this occur, higher
hail/wind probabilities would be necessary given the environment.
However, forcing does not support this scenario with height rises
across South Texas and a low-level jet focused across
Louisiana/southern Mississippi.

No changes necessary to the Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook as forecast
remains on track. See previous discussion below for more
information.

..Williams.. 05/05/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0153 AM CDT Mon May 05 2025/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will persist across parts of the northern
Plains with more localized fire weather potential expected across
parts of southwest TX this afternoon. 

...Red River Valley of the North...
Southerly winds will continue across the northern Plains ahead of a
southward advancing cold front for much of the day. Diurnal heating
and mixing will promote a slight uptick in wind speeds across
eastern ND and northwest MN by late afternoon. Most guidance
suggests winds near 15 mph are likely, which should be sufficient to
promote fire spread given afternoon RH minimums near 20% and
receptive fine fuels already in place (as evidenced by fire activity
over the past two days).

...Southwest Texas...
06 UTC surface observations and RTMA analyses show a developing
dryline extending from south-central NM southeastward along the Rio
Grande. This boundary is expected to mix northeast through late
afternoon as southwesterly winds increase to 15-20 mph. The 00 UTC
EPZ sounding sampled this dry air mass with near-surface RH values
in the low teens. Similar RH minimums are expected this afternoon
across southwest TX behind the dryline, which when combined with
breezy winds, should promote elevated to locally critical fire
weather conditions. ERC values between the 80th to 90th percentile
along the Rio Grande should support the fire threat. Although
thunderstorm development is possible across the region, recent CAM
guidance suggests convection will most likely remain east of the
Elevated risk area.

THE SOUTHERN PLAINS...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE UPPER OHIO VALLEY/MID-ATLANTIC...AND PARTS OF THE EASTERN
FLORIDA PENINSULA...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are expected across southeast New Mexico into
Texas this afternoon into tonight. Scattered large to very large
hail and severe winds are the primary threats, though a few
tornadoes are also possible. Additional strong to severe
thunderstorms should occur across the upper Ohio Valley/Mid-Atlantic
and the eastern Florida Peninsula this afternoon and evening.

...Southern Plains...
Generally elevated convection is ongoing late this morning from
portions of northwest to south-central TX. This activity is largely
being driven by low-level warm/moist advection atop a surface front.

across the Southwest through the period. Difluent flow aloft will
encourage weak lee cyclogenesis across far west TX through this
evening, and low-level moisture will continue to stream
northwestward along/south of a front across south-central/west TX

threat for severe winds will exist with any supercell or clusters.
Based on latest guidance trends, the Enhanced Risk has been expanded
southeastward towards Del Rio.

...Upper Ohio Valley/Mid-Atlantic to Eastern North Carolina...
A closed upper low will remain centered over the OH Valley today. A
mid-level shortwave trough and attendant jet is forecast to move
northward from the Carolinas to the southern Mid-Atlantic through
the afternoon and evening. Large-scale ascent will likely encourage
scattered thunderstorms to form generally along and west of a
surface front that arcs from southeast VA to western/central PA.
Daytime heating of a modestly moist low-level airmass and cool
temperatures aloft associated with the upper low should aid in the
development of around 500-1500 J/kg of MLCAPE by mid afternoon
across parts of the upper OH Valley into the southern Mid-Atlantic
and eastern NC. Even though low-level flow will tend to remain
fairly muted, southeasterly winds near the surface are forecast to

Based on latest observational and guidance trends, some westward and
southward expansions have been made to the Slight Risk across these
regions.

...Florida Peninsula...
Much of the FL Peninsula will remain displaced south of the stronger
mid/upper-level flow and forcing associated with an upper low over
the OH Valley today. Still, seasonably cool temperatures aloft
combined with modest enhancement to the mid-level westerlies should
foster adequate instability and deep-layer shear to support modest
updraft organization. Thunderstorms are expected to preferentially
favor the Atlantic Coast sea breeze today, with a stalled front over
the central FL Peninsula also serving as a potential low-level
forcing mechanism. Any convection which does develop may pose a
threat for severe hail and damaging winds before it moves offshore
by early evening. Given increased confidence in scattered to
numerous thunderstorms, along with long/straight hodographs aloft, a
Slight Risk for hail has been added for parts of the eastern FL
Peninsula with this update.

...Western Dakotas...
Even with low-level moisture remaining limited across the northern
Plains today, weak instability should develop by this afternoon in a
narrow zone focused along a front extending across the western
Dakotas. Widely scattered thunderstorms should initiate along this
boundary by this afternoon as glancing large-scale ascent from a
shortwave trough over the Canadian Prairie provinces overspreads the

...DISCUSSION...
From Thursday into the weekend, the upper-level pattern will be
characterized by an elongated trough in the East and a building
ridge in the West. With this weakly blocking pattern, slow
progression of these features can be expected. With the trough in
the East, moisture will be present south of a surface boundary
across parts of the Southeast and eventually into the Florida
Peninsula. Though organized severe potential appears low with this
activity, enough remnant mid-level flow could promote localized
strong storms. By next week, models currently suggest some troughing
is possible in the West. With preceding days of offshore winds
across the western Gulf, moisture quality ahead of any potential
trough is likely to be low.

SUMMARY...Supercells are expected to intensify across southeast New
Mexico into parts of far west Texas through early evening. Hail is
the primary hazard, likely reaching golf to tennis ball size.
Isolated severe gusts to 70 mph and a brief tornado are possible.

DISCUSSION...Overall forecast remains as advertised. Storm
intensification has been gradual, but largely focused near the
Sacramento Mountains in Otero and Lincoln counties, and separately
over Eddy and Chaves, spreading into Lea within NM. These cells and
others that should develop off the higher terrain of the northern
Trans-Pecos in TX will likely intensify during the next few hours. A
ribbon of surface dew points near 50 F have held along the Pecos
Valley, supporting a confined corridor of moderate buoyancy. With
onset of strengthening low-level flow around 22Z, supercell
coverage/intensity should peak into early evening. Thereafter, drier
low-level air over the TX South Plains and eastern Permian Basin
should result in increased ingest of MLCIN deeper into the evening.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 222
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
120 PM MDT Sun May 4 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Southeast New Mexico
  West Texas

* Effective this Sunday afternoon and evening from 120 PM until
  900 PM MDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2.5
    inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Supercell thunderstorms will pose a threat for mainly
large to very large hail up to 1.5-2.5 inches in diameter this
afternoon and evening. Isolated severe gusts of 60-70 mph may also
occur, along with a tornado or two primarily this evening.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 70
statute miles east and west of a line from 75 miles north of Roswell
NM to 45 miles south southwest of Wink TX. For a complete depiction
of the watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS
WOU2).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector

## SPC May 4, 2025 1300 UTC Day 1 Convective Outlook

<br /><a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/day1otlk.html"><img src="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/day1otlk.gif" border="1" alt="Day 1 Outlook Image" hspace="1" vspace="1" width="815" height="555" align="center" /></a><pre>
Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0750 AM CDT Sun May 04 2025

Valid 041300Z - 051200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS EASTERN NEW
MEXICO AND FAR WEST TEXAS...

...SUMMARY...
Strong to potentially severe storms are expected across east-central
and southeast New Mexico and far west Texas this afternoon and
evening, with a threat for large hail, isolated severe wind gusts,
and possibly a tornado. Other strong to locally severe storms are
possible from Florida northward into the Mid-Atlantic and Allegheny
Plateau.

...New Mexico/West Texas...
In advance of the upper trough over the Southwest Deserts,
increasing height falls and strongly diffluent flow aloft will
overspread a modestly moist boundary layer with prevalent 40s to
near 50F surface dewpoints. Beneath steep mid-level lapse rates,
upwards of 500-1000 J/kg MLCAPE is expected by late afternoon.
Scattered thunderstorms are expected across northern into
east-central New Mexico, with more isolated storms expected into far
southeast New Mexico and west Texas. Wind profiles veering with
height and increasing mid-level southwesterly winds will provide
sufficient deep-layer shear for storm organization, including the
probable development of a few supercells. Large hail and localized
severe wind gusts will be possible. In addition, enlarging low-level
hodographs and gradually improving low-level moisture could support
a tornado or two if any mature supercells can persist through late
afternoon into the evening.

...Florida...
A cluster of storms across the north-central Peninsula, and to a
lesser extent across the south-central Peninsula, may pose a
localized severe risk as they continue eastward today. Existing
cloud cover may tend to somewhat mute more robust heating, but
gradual destabilization should still occur particularly along the
east coast, which will also probably influence storm development.
Effective shear of 25-30 kt will support potentially organized
storms capable of hail and isolated damaging gusts, and some tornado
threat may exist particularly in the vicinity of the sea breeze or
any other boundaries.

...Allegheny Plateau into the Carolinas...
East of the semi-stacked/closed low, cloud breaks and cold
temperatures aloft should support modest diurnal destabilization
across parts of Ohio and West Virginia into western Pennsylvania.
Storm development should be aided one or more low-amplitude
vorticity maxima rotating around the midlevel cyclone amidst
diffluent flow aloft. Low-level winds are expected to remain rather
weak, but modestly veering wind profiles and moderate mid-level flow
could support some storm organization, if sufficient buoyancy can be
realized. Hail and locally gusty winds could accompany the strongest
storms, and a corridor of higher severe probabilities (Slight Risk
caliber) may be warranted if a scenario with somewhat greater
destabilization appears likely.

Farther south into the Carolinas and parts of the Mid-Atlantic
region, somewhat stronger diurnal heating is expected, and MLCAPE
may increase to near/above 1000 J/kg. However, storm coverage is
more uncertain, with a notable mid-level dry slot and only weak to
modest large-scale ascent expected with southward extent. Any storms
that can mature within this environment could become modestly
organized with a threat of isolated hail and damaging gusts. 

...Eastern Idaho/southwest Montana...
Scattered storm development is expected this afternoon and evening
across eastern Idaho into southwest Montana, within an environment
characterized by cool temperatures aloft and steep lapse rates.
Deep-layer shear will be relatively modest, but a few stronger
storms with small hail and gusty winds could occur. Subsequent
outlooks will reevaluate the need for a potential introduction of
low-end severe probabilities.

Mesoscale Discussion 0677
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0547 AM CDT Sun May 04 2025

Areas affected...eastern North Carolina into far southeast Virginia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 041047Z - 041345Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated strong gusts, and perhaps a brief/weak tornado,
cannot be ruled out over eastern North Carolina and eventually into
far southeast Virginia.

DISCUSSION...A line of convection with wind shift continues to push
east, now completely out of SC and over eastern NC. Earlier, a 50 kt
gust was measured near North Myrtle Beach. 

In addition to the narrow north-south line of convection, other
storms have developed ahead of the line. These storms have shown
periodic weak mesocyclones. Other storms continue to show
near-severe inbound velocities mainly over the water, but this
activity may eventually move inland.

The air mass is marginally unstable, but sufficient for isolated
severe reports this morning. Low-level SRH with 0-1 km values of
100-150 m2/s2 will continue to favor rotation within the stronger
storms, though any tornado risk should remain low-end in nature.
