Build Your Dreams <a href="https://electrek.co/guides/byd/">(BYD)</a> is
gearing up for what has the makings of an epic launch event this coming
Monday. The Chinese automaker announced several incoming debuts coming
early next week, including a new “BYD Super e-Platform,” described as a
“new benchmark in electric.” What’s most interesting, however, is that
BYD is teasing a new ultra-fast EV charger with up to 1,000 kW of power
– that’s twice as powerful as the current best on the market.

In yet another new example of an industry defying progress out of
preference for “the old ways”, X Games riders and fans are going to be
seeing a lot fewer electric motorcycles in the air this year. That’s
after a new rule change has quietly banned electric motorcycles from
competing. And the reasoning? It’s not fair to the gassers who are
trying to keep up.

The latest addition to
<a href="https://www.orbea.com/us-en/">Orbea’s</a> electric road bike
lineup is here, and it’s designed to handle more than just pavement. The
Orbea Denna, announced today, is a gravel-optimized electric road bike
that builds on the company’s previous experience with models like the
Gain and Terra. Featuring a mid-drive motor “tuned specifically for
off-road conditions”, the Denna aims to blend power, range, and
versatility for riders looking to tackle everything from steep climbs to
loose trails.

Designed for riders who want a mix of commuting practicality and
off-road capability, this e-bike brings a powerful motor, excellent
comfort, and a surprising amount of premium features at a relatively
affordable price. But how well does it actually perform? I put it to the
test to find out.

Rumors about a large order backlog for Tesla’s new Model Y in China are

It’s still too early to say whether it will enable Tesla to grow its
best-selling vehicle program or not.

<p>
A new niche EV brand, Longbow, has emerged into the public eye, hailing
itself as ” the first-ever British electric sports car manufacturer. ”
It has unveiled its first two featherweight models, inspired by British
automotive icons and designed with real-road performance and the overall
driver experience in mind. Despite debuting today, the limited
hand-built production of these two featherweight EVs is expected to
begin relatively quickly, and they start at a price that doesn’t just
cater to the affluent.

<p>
Cynics will point at big rebates and claim they mean the vehicle isn’t
selling, but that just exposes them as industry noobs. A rebate is a
powerful financial tool that helps dealers overcome obstacles like
negative equity, poor credit, down payment requirements, and interest
rate objections so you can drive home in the car of your dreams today.

<p>
If you’re dealing with any of the above, pay attention: these EVs could
get you behind the wheel of a new electric ride sooner than you think!

Lease deals get all the hype, but most people still want to own the car

buy with 0% financing this March … <strong>and that includes a zero
percent Tesla deal</strong>!
