Chinese Open-Source AI</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-19, from: Om Malik blog</p>
<p>Don’t believe the Chinese AI open-source hype, warns good friend,
Pete Warden. Their large language models come at a price — the models
are programmed to deliberately obscure historical truths, he writes on
his blog. He points out that this isn’t just censorship; it’s engineered
misinformation at scale, baked into the foundation of future
AI. Warden compares answers to the same query using different models to
support his conclusions.</p>

<p>I’ve been working on the search function for this blog, and now we
have all the DaveNet pieces between 1994 and 2004 in the database. So
here’s a search for
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22menu%20sharing%22">menu
sharing</a> which was a technology we made on the Mac that allowed
people to write menus of scripts in Frontier that appear inside other
apps. Netscape supported it as did MSIE, Quark, Eudora and many others.
It was kind of magical, esp when the apps themselves were scriptable
(many of them were in the 90s). Next up, I’m going to import the home
page of Scripting News from 1997 to 2010. It was mostly a linkblog
then.</p>

Years of Mathematical Cryptanalysis (1937-1987)</a>,” by Glenn F.
Stahly, with a lot of redactions.

Weirdly, this is the second time the NSA has declassified the document.
John Young got a

I don’t know any Celtics fans, but I imagine there are some subscribers
who are. Hard to imagine how hard the last series hit you all. I don’t
have anything against the Celtics these days although Paul Pierce is an
asshole, and I hope you all know that. Just watched the OKC win over
Denver. All around an incredible group in the final four, very diverse
and inclusive. And btw now that I think of it, Jaylen Brown was
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSu9DYgvn1E">grabbing</a>
Knicks players by the balls. I hope you all come to terms with that. We
do love Kristaps in New York, a true gentleman. Maybe he and Giannis can
