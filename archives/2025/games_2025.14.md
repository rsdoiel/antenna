## All Team-Up abilities in Marvel Rivals and how to do them

date: 2025-04-11, updated: 2025-04-11, from: Polygon Website

Team-Up abilities are thematically appropriate moves in Marvel Rivals, allowing two or more heroes from the Marvel Universe to pair up and kick ass as a group. These unique effects can be extremely powerful, and can even change the tide of battle if you know what you’re doing. Season 2 added several new Team-Ups while [&#8230;]

## Blue Prince, an almost perfect puzzle game, still tragically lacks a colorblind mode

date: 2025-04-11, updated: 2025-04-11, from: Polygon Website

There are very few flaws with Blue Prince, a new indie puzzle game about exploring a mansion whose room layout changes daily — with said room placement decided by the player as they explore and discover the mysterious properties of each room and the mansion as a whole. The game does have a big problem [&#8230;]

For as tremendous as FromSoftware games are, none of them are particularly good at co-op. You can’t just invite your friend and join a party in Elden Ring.

For longtime movie-lovers Ryan Sloan and Ariella Mastroianni, the 2020 lockdowns turned a New Jersey attic into a welcome creative pressure cooker. The pair always dreamed of making a movie, but the uncertainty of the moment — not to mention the tight quarters — created a sense of urgency. Under duress, vibes came pouring out.&#160; [&#8230;]

## Marvel Rivals tier list and best characters for season 1.5

The Marvel Rivals tier list is proof of an inherent truth: not every hero (or villain) is built equally.

## Return to Tarkir: The art and craft of the Magic callback set

In 2014, Magic: The Gathering had an irrefutable hit on its hands. Khans of Tarkir, the card game’s 65th expansion, introduced players to a realm at war, as five distinct clans fought for power and glory.

## Warfare is more an excellent horror movie than a war film

It doesn’t feel quite right to call Warfare a war movie. At least not in the traditional sense. War movies generally have arcs and scope; they search for meaning in the violence.

## These fan-made Helldivers 2 cinematics have convinced me a movie could work

That’s a statement I’m reasonably confident about, but not totally, because I know almost nothing about professional golf. But not completely nothing. I know that in J.R.R.

A sequel to a beloved anthology TV episode might seem like a cash grab; two in one season could reek of desperation.

## The first trailer for Murderbot reveals an awkward cyborg workplace comedy with laser explosions

date: 2025-04-09, updated: 2025-04-09, from: Polygon Website

The first images from Murderbot, Apple TV’s adaptation of Martha Wells’ The Murderbot Diaries series, lacked personality. In retrospect, this makes a certain amount of sense; the titular cyborg of the books is, after all, only just learning to express its personality in the first place.
