date: 2025-04-07, updated: 2025-04-05, from: Polygon Website

Straight from Critical Role’s Exandria setting comes Der Katzenprinz &#38; Other Zemnian Tales, a fully illustrated collection of fairy tales.

## Why the Switch 2 is so expensive, according to Nintendo

date: 2025-04-07, updated: 2025-04-07, from: Polygon Website

Last week, Nintendo revealed a ton of information about the Switch 2. And while there were some surprises — like a bizarrely destructive Donkey Kong game — the real shock was that of the sticker variety. The prices of both the Switch 2 console ($449.99) and its games (as much as $79.99 for Mario Kart [&#8230;]

Nintendo has made its own Discord-like chat app for the Switch 2, and it’s going to charge you for it. Once the free period is over on March 31, 2026, GameChat, and the C button that activates it, will require a Nintendo Switch Online (NSO) membership. So what happens if you aren’t a subscriber and [&#8230;]

## Why music will likely never return to Nintendo’s eShops

date: 2025-04-07, updated: 2025-04-07, from: Polygon Website

There is something perfectly simple and catchy about the Wii eShop’s theme song. It’s been remixed and parodied, even becoming the perfect sketch fodder for Nirvana the Band the Show. You’re probably already humming it right now. While that music was so iconic, there is a surprisingly practical reason that later system shops, like the [&#8230;]

## Nintendo won’t tell us how the Switch 2 Joy-Cons will avoid drift

date: 2025-04-07, updated: 2025-04-04, from: Polygon Website

While Nintendo shared a lot about the hardware for Switch 2 during its April 2 Direct and subsequent Treehouse streams, the company still won’t share the exact workings of the second iteration of Joy-Con or Pro Controller directional inputs. Specifically, it won’t confirm if the new sticks will use Hall effect technology, which has been [&#8230;]

The Switch 2 won’t be joining the Xbox and PlayStation consoles with its own system-wide achievements, Nintendo confirmed to Polygon in a recent interview.

Friend codes continue to exist on Nintendo Switch 2, but adding people will be slightly easier than it was on Switch 1, Nintendo confirmed to Polygon in a recent interview. The heart of the friends list system on Switch 2 remains the same as it was on Switch 1. That’s why you can transfer it [&#8230;]

## Are PC handhelds like Steam Deck really competitors for Switch 2?

date: 2025-04-06, updated: 2025-04-04, from: Polygon Website

When Nintendo launched the Switch in 2017, it had no competition in dedicated handheld gaming, a sector it had established with the Game Boy in 1989 and ruled ever since. Sega had come and gone; Sony, after two determined attempts with the PlayStation Portable and PlayStation Vita, had just about given up. As Switch 2 [&#8230;]

## How the Righteous Gemstones brought sci-fi to church with the magic of jetpacks

date: 2025-04-06, updated: 2025-04-06, from: Polygon Website

As it barrels through its characteristically outlandish fourth and final season, Danny McBride’s HBO comedy The Righteous Gemstones has cemented a reputation for itself. Yes, it’s side-splittingly funny. Yes, its “failchildren of a crumbling empire” narrative is surprisingly relevant. Yes, there is a core of sincerity at the center of the madness. But Gemstones’ legacy [&#8230;]

I did something horrible. I told Jafar, the scheming vizier villain in Disney’s Aladdin, about cryptocurrency, and now he’s determined to get WyshCoin off the ground by selling the luxurious lifestyle associated with the brand.
