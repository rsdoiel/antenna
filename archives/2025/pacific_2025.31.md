## 80 years ago today, Aug. 9, 1945

date: 2025-08-07, updated: 2025-08-07, from: Marianas Variety

ON July 31, 1945, the Project Alberta team on Tinian, working with the 509th Composite Group, conducted a complete dress rehearsal of the Little Boy atomic bomb drop.  Maj. Charles Sweeney piloted his plane, the Great Artist, and Capt. George Marquardt piloted Necessary Evil, accompanied by Tibbets, who was piloting the yet unnamed Enola Gay.  They flew from Tinian to Iwo Jima, where an atomic bomb loading pit had been constructed.  If something happened to Enola Gay along the way, they were to land at Iwo, move the bomb from Enola Gay to the standby aircraft, the Big Stink.  Tibbets would then fly Big Stink to the target. The test was deemed fully successful.

date: 2025-08-04, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>LAHAINA, Maui &#8212; On a crystalline morning, with humpback whales leaping in the indigo waters offshore, a group of archivists, curators, conservators and volunteers gathered in a makeshift field station at the Lahaina Jodo Mission, a once-magnificent Japanese Buddhist temple compound that was largely obliterated in the wildfires of Aug. 8, 2023. They were there to take on a &#8220;CSI&#8221;-like challenge: identifying, cleaning and cataloging the surprising array of artifacts that survived the fires, some nearly unrecognizable beneath flaking metal, scorch marks, ashes and soot.</p>
