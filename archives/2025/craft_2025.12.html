<h2 id="doormaking-and-window-making-the-introduction">Doormaking and
Window-Making – The Introduction</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-25, from: Lost Arg Press blog</p>
<p>As the Industrial Revolution mechanized the jobs of the joiner –
building doors and windows by hand – one anonymous joiner watched the
traditional skills disappear and decided to do something about it. That
joiner wrote two short illustrated booklets that explained how to build
doors and windows by hand. And what was most unusual about…</p>

<h2 id="jim-olson">100: Jim Olson</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-24, from: Luthier on Luthier with Michael Bashkin</p>
<p>
For episode 100 of the podcast, I talk with the legendary Jim Olson.
</p>
<p>
Jim should need little introduction to most Luthier on Luthier
listeners. His guitars have been played and cherished by artists
including James Taylor (you can even spot the trademark headstock “O”
during Taylor’s appearance on the Simpsons), Paul Simon, Phil Keaggy,
Zac Brown and Patty Larkin.
</p>
<p>
Though he creates some of the most valuable flattop guitars around, his
build process is all about efficiency and quality control. Jim talks
about how his tooling and processes have changed over the years, how Bob
Taylor talked him into his first CNC, early career challenges (“I
couldn’t give them away,” he says about his first guitars), and about
the subjective nature of a “better” guitar.
