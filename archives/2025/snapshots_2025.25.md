## Quoting Kent Beck

<blockquote cite="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSXaxOdVtAQ&amp;t=12m30s"><p>So you can think really big thoughts and the leverage of having those big thoughts has just suddenly expanded enormously. I had <a href="https://twitter.com/KentBeck/status/1648413998025707520">this tweet</a> two years ago where I said "90% of my skills just went to zero dollars and 10% of my skills just went up 1000x". And this is exactly what I'm talking about - having a vision, being able to set milestones towards that vision, keeping track of a design to maintain or control the levels of complexity as you go forward. Those are hugely leveraged skills now compared to knowing where to put the ampersands and the stars and the brackets in Rust.</p></blockquote>
