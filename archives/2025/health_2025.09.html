the Gut Microbiota Profile in Prehypertensive Individuals Exhibiting
Phlegm-Dampness Constitution</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundPrehypertension is the preclinical stage of hypertension,
which is more likely to develop into hypertension than normal blood
pressure. Although the body may experience pathological changes at this
stage, there are often no symptoms. Chinese medicine constitution theory
is widely used to assess an individual’s health and disease status,
which provides a new method for disease prevention. The phlegm-dampness
constitution (PDC) is the main constitution in prehypertension.
Dysbiosis of the intestinal flora is considered to be related to the
development of hypertension. However, the characteristics of the
intestinal flora in prehypertensive populations with PDCs are still
unknown.Methods16S rRNA gene sequencing of fecal samples was performed
in this study, which included 30 prehypertensive subjects with PDCs, 30
nonphlegm-dampness constitution (NPDC) prehypertensive individuals with
balanced constitution, and 30 ideal blood pressure subjects with
balanced constitution (BC). On the basis of the composition of the
intestinal flora, a random forest classifier was constructed to screen
the specific bacteria of the prehypertensive PDC population, and the
diagnostic efficiency was determined by the area under the curve
(AUC).ResultsAt the phylum level, the abundance of Bacteroidetes
decreased in the PDC group compared with the NPDC group. Bacteroides was
the most important genus at the genus level. Compared with those in the
NPDC or BC group, the relative abundances of o_RF39,
f_Porphyromonadaceae, f_Christensenellaceae, g_parabacteroides, and
g_nitrobacteria in the PDC group were significantly greater. The random
forest analysis results revealed that Alistipes, Butyricimonas,
Odoribacter, Parabacteroides, and Corynebacterium are bacterial genera
that significantly differ between the PDC and NPDC groups and greatly
contribute to group differentiation. Receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) analysis revealed that the AUC range of differential bacteria and
its combined diagnostic model ranged from 0.653 (95% CI: 0.511–0.794) to
0.706 (95% CI: 0.573–0.838), suggesting that it is a potential risk
marker for phlegm-dampness constitution with
prehypertension.ConclusionsOur study indicates that PDC individuals with
prehypertension can be distinguished from NPDC individuals according to
their gut microbiome characteristics. Prevention and treatment measures
based on these biomarkers may be beneficial in opening new ideas and
directions for identifying more aggressive and effective interventions
for prehypertensive populations.</p>

of the gut tract in the therapeutic mechanisms of polydopamine for acute
cerebral infarction: neuro-immune interaction through the gut-brain
axis</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundRecent research has made significant progress in
elucidating gastrointestinal complications following acute cerebral
infarction (ACI), which includes disorders in intestinal motility and
dysbiosis of the gut microbiota. Nevertheless, the role of the gut
(which is acknowledged as being the largest immune organ) in the
immunoreactive effects of polydopamine nanoparticles (PDA) on acute
ischemic stroke remains inadequately understood. In addition to its
function in nutrient absorption, the gut acts as a protective barrier
against microbes. Systemic immune responses, which are triggered by the
disruption of gut barrier integrity, are considered as one of the
mechanisms underlying acute ischemic stroke, with the gut-brain axis
(GBA) playing a pivotal role in this process.MethodsIn this study, we
used a PDA intervention in an ACI model to investigate ACI-like
behavior, intestinal barrier function, central and peripheral
inflammation, and hippocampal neuron excitability, thus aiming to
elucidate the mechanisms through which PDA improves ACI via the
GBA.ResultsOur findings indicated that as ACI mice experienced dysbiosis
of the gut microbiota and intestinal barrier damage, the levels of
proinflammatory factors in the serum and brain significantly increased.
Additionally, the activation of astrocytes in the hippocampal region and
neuronal apoptosis were observed in ACI mice. Importantly, our study is
the first to provide evidence demonstrating that PDA effectively
suppresses the neuroimmune interactions of the gut-brain axis and
significantly improves intestinal epithelial barrier
integrity.ConclusionWe hope that our discoveries will serve as a
foundation for further explorations of the therapeutic mechanisms of PDA
in ACI, particularly in elucidating the protective roles of gut
microbiota and intestinal barrier function, as well as in the
development of more targeted clinical interventions for ACI.</p>

resistance in Mycoplasma pneumoniae in adult patients</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Mycoplasma pneumoniae is one of the most significant pathogens
responsible for<br>respiratory infections in humans. Macrolides are
recommended as the first-line treatment for M. pneumoniae infection. The
prevalence of macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae has increased
significantly in recent decades, particularly in China. The mechanisms
of resistance in M. pneumoniae to macrolides have been extensively
studied in pediatric patients. However, a paucity reports regarding the
resistance characteristics and mechanisms exhibited in adults. The aim
of this study was to elucidate the resistance of M. pneumoniae to
macrolides and the underlying mechanisms in adult patients. Pharyngeal
swab specimens were collected from adult patients presenting with
subacute cough or community-acquired pneumonia at our hospital from
January 2011 to June 2017 to identify and isolate M. pneumoniae strains.
The antimicrobial susceptibility of these isolates to 3 macrolide
antibiotics was assessed using broth microdilution method. The 23S rRNA
genes of macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae strains were sequenced, and
the presence of target methylation genes (ermA, ermB, and ermC), efflux
pump genes (mefA, mefA/E, msrA, and msrA/B), and the macrolide
resistance gene mphC was identified through polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) testing. Additionally, MICs were determined with and without the
efflux pump inhibitor reserpine. A total of 72 M. pneumoniae strains
were isolated from adult patients, with 41.7% (30/72) exhibiting
macrolide resistance. Among the 3 macrolides tested, the
16-membered-ring midecamycin exhibited the greatest activity (MIC90: 16
µg/ml) against M. pneumoniae. All macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae
strains harbored mutations at the 2063 site in domain V of the 23S rRNA
gene. Two macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae clinical isolates were found
to harbor the efflux pump genes msrA/B and mefA. The efflux pump
inhibitor reserpine reduced the MIC for azithromycin in these two
strains to a quarter of their original values. In summary,
macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae is commonly observed among adults in
Beijing. Point mutations are the primary mechanism responsible for
macrolide resistance in adults with M. pneumoniae. Additionally, the
efflux pump mechanism may contribute partially to this resistance.
Midecamycin presents a promising alternative drug for treating M.
pneumoniae infections, particularly in cases of azithromycin-resistant
M. pneumoniae infection in young children.</p>

environmental survey of Scedosporium species in Lebanon</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundScedosporium species are filamentous fungi causing a wide
spectrum of infections in healthy and debilitated individuals. Despite
their clinical significance, the ecology of Scedosporium species remains
understudied, particularly in the Middle East.MethodsIn this context, we
conducted an environmental study to elucidate the distribution and
ecological preferences of Scedosporium species in the North of Lebanon.
One hundred and fifty-five soil samples were collected from different
environmental areas and analyzed for several chemical parameters.
Scedosporium isolates were then selected for species identification and
genotyping.ResultsOverall, 39 (25.16%) were positive for Scedosporium
species, with a predominance of S. apiospermum (80.56%). Soil analysis
revealed associations between the fungal presence and pH, nitrogen,
phosphorus, and organic matter content. Moreover, genotyping analysis
using MultiLocus Sequence Typing identified five major clusters.
Interestingly, a number of Lebanese isolates formed an Asian-specific
cluster (V) with one clinical Chinese isolate, whereas two clusters (II
and III) showed a close association with German isolates, and clusters
(I and IV) contained isolates with a global distribution.ConclusionThese
findings provide new insights into the ecology of Scedosporium species,
bridging a gap in our knowledge of their distribution on the Asian
continent and laying the groundwork for future clinical investigations.
Future international collaborations are essential to trace the origin of
S. apiospermum.</p>

and antibiofilm activities of star anise-cinnamon essential oil against
multidrug-resistant Salmonella Thompson</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThe emergence of foodborne multidrug-resistant (MDR)
Salmonella has attracted considerable global attention. Given that food
is the primary transmission route, our study focuses on Bellamya
quadrata, a freshwater snail that is commonly consumed as a specialty
food in Guangxi, China.MethodsEight MDR Salmonella strains were isolated
from Bellamya quadrata samples collected across various markets.
Previous animal experiments have confirmed their lethality in mice. We
determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and fractional
inhibitory concentration (FIC) indices of cinnamon essential oil (CEO)
and star anise essential oil (SAEO) using the microdilution plate and
checkerboard methods. The time-kill curve method was employed to assess
the antibacterial activity of the cinnamon-star anise essential oil
(SCEO) against planktonic MDR Salmonella. The alkaline phosphatase assay
and fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that SCEO causes damage to
bacterial cell walls and membranes. Crystal violet staining and scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) were used to observe changes in biofilms after
SCEO treatment. Quantitative real-time PCR was utilized to analyze the
expression of genes related to biofilm formation following SCEO
treatment.ResultsThe MIC of SAEO was determined to be 25 mg/mL, whereas
that of CEO was significantly lower at 0.62 mg/mL. The FIC index
calculated was 0.375, which suggests a synergistic interaction between
the two. When SCEO was used in combination at specific ratios, it
demonstrated enhanced antibacterial and anti-biofilm capabilities
compared to the individual effects of CEO or SAEO, potentially through
the disruption of bacterial cell membranes and cell walls. However, in
Salmonella treated with SCEO, an upregulation in the expression of
biofilm-associated genes was observed, including csgA, adrA, bcsA, and
csgD. This increase may be attributed to stress-induced transcriptional
responses within the bacteria.DiscussionSCEO significantly impacts cell
wall integrity, suggesting its crucial role in reducing biofilm
formation. These findings indicate that SCEO holds potential as an
alternative to traditional antibiotics and merits further scientific
investigation and development.</p>

CD4+ T cells through gut microbiota: therapeutic potential of
traditional Chinese medicine in inflammatory bowel disease</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is an autoimmune disease
characterized by chronic relapsing inflammation of the intestinal tract.
Gut microbiota (GM) and CD4+T cells are important in the development of
IBD. A lot of studies have shown that GM and their metabolites like
short-chain fatty acids, bile acids and tryptophan can be involved in
the differentiation of CD4+T cells through various mechanisms, which in
turn regulate the immune homeostasis of the IBD patients. Therefore,
regulating CD4+T cells through GM may be a potential therapeutic
direction for the treatment of IBD. Many studies have shown that
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) formulas and some herbal extracts can
affect CD4+T cell differentiation by regulating GM and its metabolites.
In this review, we mainly focus on the role of GM and their metabolites
in regulating the differentiation of CD4+T cells and their correlation
with IBD. We also summarize the current research progress on the
regulation of this process by TCM.</p>
