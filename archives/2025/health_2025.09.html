environmental survey of Scedosporium species in Lebanon</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundScedosporium species are filamentous fungi causing a wide
spectrum of infections in healthy and debilitated individuals. Despite
their clinical significance, the ecology of Scedosporium species remains
understudied, particularly in the Middle East.MethodsIn this context, we
conducted an environmental study to elucidate the distribution and
ecological preferences of Scedosporium species in the North of Lebanon.
One hundred and fifty-five soil samples were collected from different
environmental areas and analyzed for several chemical parameters.
Scedosporium isolates were then selected for species identification and
genotyping.ResultsOverall, 39 (25.16%) were positive for Scedosporium
species, with a predominance of S. apiospermum (80.56%). Soil analysis
revealed associations between the fungal presence and pH, nitrogen,
phosphorus, and organic matter content. Moreover, genotyping analysis
using MultiLocus Sequence Typing identified five major clusters.
Interestingly, a number of Lebanese isolates formed an Asian-specific
cluster (V) with one clinical Chinese isolate, whereas two clusters (II
and III) showed a close association with German isolates, and clusters
(I and IV) contained isolates with a global distribution.ConclusionThese
findings provide new insights into the ecology of Scedosporium species,
bridging a gap in our knowledge of their distribution on the Asian
continent and laying the groundwork for future clinical investigations.
Future international collaborations are essential to trace the origin of
S. apiospermum.</p>

and antibiofilm activities of star anise-cinnamon essential oil against
multidrug-resistant Salmonella Thompson</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThe emergence of foodborne multidrug-resistant (MDR)
Salmonella has attracted considerable global attention. Given that food
is the primary transmission route, our study focuses on Bellamya
quadrata, a freshwater snail that is commonly consumed as a specialty
food in Guangxi, China.MethodsEight MDR Salmonella strains were isolated
from Bellamya quadrata samples collected across various markets.
Previous animal experiments have confirmed their lethality in mice. We
determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and fractional
inhibitory concentration (FIC) indices of cinnamon essential oil (CEO)
and star anise essential oil (SAEO) using the microdilution plate and
checkerboard methods. The time-kill curve method was employed to assess
the antibacterial activity of the cinnamon-star anise essential oil
(SCEO) against planktonic MDR Salmonella. The alkaline phosphatase assay
and fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that SCEO causes damage to
bacterial cell walls and membranes. Crystal violet staining and scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) were used to observe changes in biofilms after
SCEO treatment. Quantitative real-time PCR was utilized to analyze the
expression of genes related to biofilm formation following SCEO
treatment.ResultsThe MIC of SAEO was determined to be 25 mg/mL, whereas
that of CEO was significantly lower at 0.62 mg/mL. The FIC index
calculated was 0.375, which suggests a synergistic interaction between
the two. When SCEO was used in combination at specific ratios, it
demonstrated enhanced antibacterial and anti-biofilm capabilities
compared to the individual effects of CEO or SAEO, potentially through
the disruption of bacterial cell membranes and cell walls. However, in
Salmonella treated with SCEO, an upregulation in the expression of
biofilm-associated genes was observed, including csgA, adrA, bcsA, and
csgD. This increase may be attributed to stress-induced transcriptional
responses within the bacteria.DiscussionSCEO significantly impacts cell
wall integrity, suggesting its crucial role in reducing biofilm
formation. These findings indicate that SCEO holds potential as an
alternative to traditional antibiotics and merits further scientific
investigation and development.</p>

CD4+ T cells through gut microbiota: therapeutic potential of
traditional Chinese medicine in inflammatory bowel disease</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is an autoimmune disease
characterized by chronic relapsing inflammation of the intestinal tract.
Gut microbiota (GM) and CD4+T cells are important in the development of
IBD. A lot of studies have shown that GM and their metabolites like
short-chain fatty acids, bile acids and tryptophan can be involved in
the differentiation of CD4+T cells through various mechanisms, which in
turn regulate the immune homeostasis of the IBD patients. Therefore,
regulating CD4+T cells through GM may be a potential therapeutic
direction for the treatment of IBD. Many studies have shown that
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) formulas and some herbal extracts can
affect CD4+T cell differentiation by regulating GM and its metabolites.
In this review, we mainly focus on the role of GM and their metabolites
in regulating the differentiation of CD4+T cells and their correlation
with IBD. We also summarize the current research progress on the
regulation of this process by TCM.</p>
