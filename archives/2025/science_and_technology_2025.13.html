<p>Nova Custom, based in The Netherlands, makes laptops focused on
privacy, customisation, and freedom. Nova Custom laptops ship with
either Linux, Windows, or no operating system, and they’re uniquely
certified for Qubes OS (the V54 model will be certified soon), the
ultra-secure and private operating system. On top of that, Nova Custom
laptops come with Dasharo coreboot firmware preinstalled, which is
completely open source, instead of a proprietary BIOS. Nova Custom can
also disable the Intel Management Engine for you, and you can opt for
Dasharo coreboot+Heads for the ultimate in boot security. Nova Custom
offers visual customisations, too, including engraving a logo or text of
your choice on the metal screen lid and/or palmrest and adding your own
boot logo. They also offer privacy customisations like removing the
microphone and webcam, installing a privacy screen, and more. A small
touch I personally appreciate: Nova Custom offers a long, long list of
keyboard layouts, as well as the option to customise the super key. Nova
Custom products enjoy 3 years of warranty, as well as updates and spare
parts for at least seven years after the launch of a product, which
includes everything from motherboard replacements down to sets of
screws. Nova Custom laptops can be configured with a wide variety of

A powerful mathematical technique is used to model melting ice and other
phenomena. But it has long been imperiled by certain “nightmare
scenarios.” A new proof has removed that obstacle.

id="the-32bit-risc-os-needs-to-be-ported-to-64bit-to-survive-seeks-help">The
32bit RISC OS needs to be ported to 64bit to survive, seeks help</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>RISC OS, the operating system from the United Kingdom originally
designed to run on Acorn Computer’s Archimedes computers – the first ARM
computers – is still actively developed today. Especially since the
introduction of the Raspberry Pi, new life was breathed into this ageing
operating system, and it has gained quite a bit of steady momentum ever
since, with tons of small updates, applications, and new hardware
support, including things like support for wireless networking. This
development has always been a bit piecemeal, though, and the pace has
never been exceptionally fast. Now, though, time really is ticking for
RISC OS: popular RISC OS platforms like the Raspberry Pi are moving to
64bit ARM only, and this poses a big problem for RISC OS: most of it is
written in pure 32bit ARM assembly. As you can imagine, the supply of
capable 32bit ARM boards is going to dwindle over the coming years,
which would put RISC OS right back where it was before the launch of the
Raspberry Pi: floundering, relying on old hardware. This is obviously
not ideal, and as such, RISC OS Open Limited wants to take a big leap to
address this. Since 2011, ROOL has successfully delivered dozens of
community-funded improvements through its bounty scheme. While this
model has enabled steady progress, it is not suited to the scale of work
now required to modernise RISC OS. The Moonshots initiative represents a
fundamental shift: focused, multi-year development projects undertaken
by full-time engineers. The first Moonshot aims to make the RISC OS
source code portable and compatible with 64-bit Arm platforms, a
prerequisite for future hardware support. ROOL has already scoped the
work, identified key milestones, and built cost models based on
realistic employment and project management needs. ↫ Steve Revill in a
ROOL press release They’re going to need a dedicated team of several
developers working over the course of several years to port RISC OS to
64bit ARM. That’s going to require quite a bit of money, manpower, and
expertise, and considering ROOL has only collected about £100000 worth
of donations over the past 14 years, I can see why they’re aiming to go
big for this effort. All these giant technology corporations with
trillion dollar stock valuations are currently relying on ARM
technology, so you’d think they could empty a few socks and cough up a
few million to get this effort funded properly, but alas, we all know
that’s not going to happen. I hope ROOL can make this work. RISC OS is a
ton of fun to use, and occupies a unique place in computing history. I
would be incredibly sad to see technological progress leave it behind,
when what amount to chump change for so many wealthy companies and
individuals could save it.</p>

makes it even harder to use a local account on Windows 11</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>Do you want to install Windows 11 without internet access or without
an online Microsoft Account? It seems Microsoft really doesn’t want you
to, as it has removed a very common and popular way of bypassing this
requirement. In the release notes for the latest builds from the Dev and
Beta channels, the company notes: We’re removing the bypassnro.cmd
script from the build to enhance security and user experience of Windows
11. This change ensures that all users exit setup with internet
connectivity and a Microsoft Account. Let me blow your minds and state
that I don’t think online accounts for an operating system are
inherently a bad idea. I would love it if I could install Fedora KDE on
a new machine, optionally log into some online “Fedora Account”, and
have my customisations and applications synchronise automatically. It
would save me some time and effort, and assuming it’s all properly
encrypted and secured, I don’t think the risk factors are particularly
high. The keyword here is, of course, optionally. Microsoft wants every
Windows 11 user to have a Microsoft Account instead of a local account,
and would rather not make it optional at all. Of course, this is still
Microsoft, a company wholly incapable of doing anything right when it
comes to operating systems, so even making this script available again
during installation is stupidly easy. It took a few nerds mere moments
to discover you could just make some registry changes during
installation, reboot, and have the script return to its rightful place.
Oh Microsoft. Never change.</p>

id="microsoft-releases-windows-11-roadmap-tool-to-help-make-sense-of-windows-11s-development">Microsoft
releases Windows 11 roadmap tool to help make sense of Windows 11’s
development</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>I’ve complained about the utter inscrutability of the Windows release
process for a long time, with Microsoft seemingly using channels, build
numbers, code names, date-based version numbers, and so on
interchangeably, making it incredibly hard to keep track of what is
being released when. It turns out even Microsoft itself started losing
track, because it’s now released a roadmap for Windows 11 development.
In the roadmap tool – of course it’s a tool – you can select a platform,
which isn’t x86 or ARM, but Windows PC or Copilot+ PC, a version (23H2
or 24H2 for now), a status (In preview, Gradually rolling out, or
Generally available), and a channel (Canary, Dev, Beta, or Retail),
after which the roadmap tool will list whatever features match those
criteria. Do you now see why people might want such a tool to keep track
of what the hell is going on with Windows? Anyway, as the date-based
version numbers – 23H2 and 24H2 – may already make clear, this seems
more like a roadmap about where development’s been than where
development’s going. The problem for Microsoft, of course, is that it
maintains several different Windows variants with different feature sets
and update schedules, and users, too, can of course opt to stick to
certain versions before moving on. The end result is this spaghetti,
which makes it hard to untangle when you’re getting which feature.
Anyway, if you’re elbow-deep in the Windows spaghetti, this tool may be
of use to you.</p>
