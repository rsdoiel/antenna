NixOS and reproducible builds could have detected the xz backdoor for
the benefit of all</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-25, from: OS News</p>
<p>Some more light reading: While it was already established that the
open source supply chain was often the target of malicious actors, what
is stunning is the amount of energy invested by Jia Tan to gain the
trust of the maintainer of the xz project, acquire push access to the
repository and then among other perfectly legitimate contributions
insert – piece by piece – the code for a very sophisticated and
obfuscated backdoor. This should be a wake up call for the OSS
community. We should consider the open source supply chain a high value
target for powerful threat actors, and to collectively find
countermeasures against such attacks. In this article, I’ll discuss the
inner workings of the xz backdoor and how I think we could have
mechanically detected it thanks to build reproducibility. ↫ Julien Malka
It’s a very detailed look at the situation and what Nix could to prevent
it in the future.</p>

<p>date: 2025-03-24, from: OS News</p>
<p>What if you want to use a web browser like Dillo, which lacks
JavaScript support and can’t play audio or video inside the browser?
Dillo doesn’t have the capability to play audio or video directly from
the browser, however it can easily offload this task to other programs.
This page collects some examples of how to do watch videos and listen to
audio tracks or podcasts by using an external player program. In
particular we will cover mpv with yt-dlp which supports YouTube and
Bandcamp among many other sites. ↫ Dillo website The way Dillo handles
this feels very UNIX-y, in that it will call an external program – mpv
and yt-dlp, for instance – to play a YouTube from an “Open in mpv”
option in the right-click menu for a link. It’s nothing earth-shattering
or revolutionary, of course, but I very much appreciate that Dillo bakes
this functionality right in, allowing you to define any such actions and
add them to the context menu.</p>
