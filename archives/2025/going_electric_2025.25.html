<p>
A new electric hub motor just dropped at Eurobike 2025, and it’s a big
deal – mainly because it’s so small. Developed through a partnership
between Moving Magnet Technologies (MMT), Swiss mechatronics firm
Sonceboz, and French e-bike software company eBikeLabs, the new motor
aims to set a new benchmark for premium urban e-bikes.
</p>
<p>
And based on the specs alone, it just might.

<p>
Raleigh is rolling out a new chapter in its long legacy of bicycle
design with the launch of the <em>Raleigh ONE</em>, a sleek, smart
e-bike aimed squarely at the European urban mobility market. Officially
unveiled today, the Raleigh ONE combines classic British cycling
heritage with modern connected tech, delivering what the company calls
“the only e-bike you’ll need in the city.”
</p>
<p>
Taking a page out of Big Tech’s playbook, Raleigh is also offering a
membership program to unlock extra features. But will riders pay up, or
will they balk?

Tesla has requested that NHTSA withhold its response to the numerous
questions the regulators had about its recent Robotaxi launch.

As for the agency, it said that it is aware of some disturbing videos in
which we can see Tesla’s system making serious mistakes on its first
day.

With much of the US sweltering under
<a href="https://electrek.co/2025/06/22/your-secret-weapon-against-summer-heat-home-solar-power-battery/">a

EV and renewable investments in the US are stalling – and May was
another tough month. Businesses canceled $1.4 billion worth of clean
energy factories and projects last month, according to the latest
numbers
from <a href="https://e2.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">E2</a> and
the <a href="https://cleaneconomytracker.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clean
Economy Tracker</a>. That pushes total canceled investments to $15.5
billion this year, wiping out nearly 12,000 potential jobs.

Working on e-bikes can be a pain – literally – if you’re hoisting 70,
80, or even 100-pound (up to 45 kg) bikes onto a repair stand for
assembly or maintenance –
<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/11/07/review-the-awd-fucare-gemini-x-electric-moped-has-dual-batteries-and-attitude/">something
I seem to be doing on an all too regular basis</a>. That’s why I was
excited to get and test out a Remco electric bike lift stand, a
motorized work stand that does the heavy lifting for you. And after
using it for a few months while assembling and maintaining a revolving
door of hefty e-bikes, I can safely say that this thing is a game
changer – especially if your back is tired of playing bike mechanic.

Tesla spent years selling its Full Self-Driving software, for
<a href="https://electrek.co/2022/09/05/tesla-raises-full-self-driving-price-to-15000-is-it-worth-it/">as
much as $15,000</a>, with the promise that owners would be able to use
that software to send their cars out as robotaxis to earn money when
they’re not being used otherwise.
</p>
<p>
Just today, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that Tesla will be charging a
flat fee of $4.20 for rides in its
<a href="https://electrek.co/2025/06/20/tesla-releases-details-robotaxi-launch-safety-monitor-front-seat/">highly-supervised
“robotaxi”.</a> But that brings up the question: if Tesla spent so many
years promising that you could use your car to earn money, and
<em>it’s</em> using <em>its</em> cars to earn money, then why can’t you?

A leaked 2026 order guide shows the price on several Volvo models going

higher destination charges, fewer discounts, and precious little in the
way of new tech or features to justify the price hike.
