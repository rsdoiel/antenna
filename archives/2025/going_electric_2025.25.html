With the Tesla Semi making headlines consistently since its first public
appearance <em>waaay</em> back back in 2017, you might think they were
some kind of market leaders. Meanwhile, Volvo Trucks has quietly
delivered its 5,000th electric semi truck … and they’re just getting

No matter how badly a fleet may want to electrify, harsh economic

For the better part of a year, Tesla has been promising “more affordable

to go into production in the next 2 days, but it sure feels like that

TQ, the German force behind some of the lightest and quietest e-bike

weeks after debuting the lightweight HPR60 e-bike drive system, the
company has introduced the HPR40, now claiming the title of the lightest

value of such a system.

G300 Pro</a> is the epitome of an out-of-class electric bike. That is to
say, it has many of the components of an electric bicycle, key among
them the functional pedals, but its extremely high power and speed place
it well outside the limits of traditional e-bike classifications. The
result? Basically, an electric motorcycle with pedals. And I’ve got some
thoughts about that.

Electric bikes have exploded in popularity – and so have the risks. In
Huntington Beach, California, rising e-bike crashes involving young
riders prompted the city’s police department to launch what may be
California’s first police-led e-bike safety course for kids, and it
might be exactly the kind of inventive community-based program more
places need.

<p>
I know, it sounds like clickbait math, but it’s real: you can cover
6,000 miles for just $160 in fuel. There’s a catch, though. It’s not
gasoline. Oh, and it’s not even in a car. You’ll need to trade in your
four wheels for two. Specifically, you’ll need something like the Ryvid
Anthem, a lightweight, street-legal electric motorcycle that was
purpose-built for efficient urban commuting.

<p>
Recently, the up-and-coming electric motorcycle manufacturer Stark
Future invited us to the mountains of Spain to get hands-on with the
Stark Varg EX – a fully electric street-legal enduro motorcycle selling
in the U.S for $12,990 for the 60 HP configuration and $13,990 for the
insane 80 HP configuration. After 2 days on trails, my biggest surprise
was just how approachable and easy to ride the EX turned out to be for
such a high-performance machine. It’s still far from being optimal as a
commuter bike, but then again, that’s not quite what the EX is for.

With short runs at low speeds under heavy loads in a controlled space,
heavy-duty terminal tractors represent an almost ideal use case for

Electric bikes are getting better, safer, and more affordable every
year. Even so, in the US, e-bikes are still relatively expensive despite
being such an incredibly price-sensitive market. Whenever someone asks
me to recommend an e-bike for them, one of their first requirements is
invariably that it doesn’t cost a fortune. Though the tradeoffs for
dropping the price can sometimes rear their ugly head with their own
hidden costs.
</p>
<p>
And let’s be real: the sub-$1,000 category has always been a bit of a
minefield. For every great deal, there are a dozen cheap frames with
underpowered motors, sketchy brakes, or batteries that make me nervous
just looking at them. But with a lot of digging (and a lot of riding),
I’ve managed to find a few standout electric bikes that prove you
<em>can</em> get a surprisingly good ride without breaking the bank.

And thanks to their ridership of exclusively Tesla influencers, almost

livestreamed, which gives us plenty of footage to discover what’s gone
right and what’s gone wrong.

The countdown is on for another exciting week of solar car racing! Over
30 teams from the US, Canada, and worldwide have registered their
hand-designed and built solar cars to compete in the 2025 Electrek

notable, aside from the impressive number of teams we expect to see, is
that it marks the 25th anniversary of the track event, first held in
2000.

A new electric hub motor just dropped at Eurobike 2025, and it’s a big
deal – mainly because it’s so small. Developed through a partnership
between Moving Magnet Technologies (MMT), Swiss mechatronics firm
Sonceboz, and French e-bike software company eBikeLabs, the new motor
aims to set a new benchmark for premium urban e-bikes.
</p>

And based on the specs alone, it just might.

Raleigh is rolling out a new chapter in its long legacy of bicycle
design with the launch of the <em>Raleigh ONE</em>, a sleek, smart
e-bike aimed squarely at the European urban mobility market. Officially
unveiled today, the Raleigh ONE combines classic British cycling
heritage with modern connected tech, delivering what the company calls
“the only e-bike you’ll need in the city.”

<p>
Taking a page out of Big Tech’s playbook, Raleigh is also offering a
membership program to unlock extra features. But will riders pay up, or
will they balk?

EV and renewable investments in the US are stalling – and May was
another tough month. Businesses canceled $1.4 billion worth of clean
energy factories and projects last month, according to the latest
numbers
from <a href="https://e2.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">E2</a> and
the <a href="https://cleaneconomytracker.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clean

billion this year, wiping out nearly 12,000 potential jobs.

Working on e-bikes can be a pain – literally – if you’re hoisting 70,
80, or even 100-pound (up to 45 kg) bikes onto a repair stand for
assembly or maintenance –
<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/11/07/review-the-awd-fucare-gemini-x-electric-moped-has-dual-batteries-and-attitude/">something
I seem to be doing on an all too regular basis</a>. That’s why I was
excited to get and test out a Remco electric bike lift stand, a
motorized work stand that does the heavy lifting for you. And after
using it for a few months while assembling and maintaining a revolving
door of hefty e-bikes, I can safely say that this thing is a game
changer – especially if your back is tired of playing bike mechanic.

Tesla spent years selling its Full Self-Driving software, for
<a href="https://electrek.co/2022/09/05/tesla-raises-full-self-driving-price-to-15000-is-it-worth-it/">as
much as $15,000</a>, with the promise that owners would be able to use
that software to send their cars out as robotaxis to earn money when
they’re not being used otherwise.
</p>
<p>
Just today, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that Tesla will be charging a
flat fee of $4.20 for rides in its
<a href="https://electrek.co/2025/06/20/tesla-releases-details-robotaxi-launch-safety-monitor-front-seat/">highly-supervised
“robotaxi”.</a> But that brings up the question: if Tesla spent so many
years promising that you could use your car to earn money, and
<em>it’s</em> using <em>its</em> cars to earn money, then why can’t you?

A leaked 2026 order guide shows the price on several Volvo models going

The Senate version of the repubilcans’ tax bill won’t just add trillions
of dollars to the deficit through a
<a href="https://electrek.co/2025/05/22/house-republicans-vote-to-send-us-ev-jobs-to-china-give-trillions-to-us-elites/">massive
giveaway to wealthy elites</a>, it will also take the US Postal
Service’s awesome new EVs and sell them off for pennies on the dollar,
wasting money simply out of spite for vehicles that were already
cleaning your air and making your community safer.
