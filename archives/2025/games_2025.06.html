<p>date: 2025-02-10, updated: 2025-02-10, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>The Super Bowl is as much about the spectacle as it is about the
football. That tradition of spectacle includes the commercials: Super
Bowl ads tend to be big swings, featuring a lot of celebrities and
attention-grabbing ploys. That usually includes movie trailers for the
year’s upcoming blockbusters (and hopeful blockbusters). In recent
years, though, […]</p>

<p>While we don’t know everything about Marvel Studios’ upcoming
Thunderbolts* (like what the asterisk stands for), thanks to the new
trailer released during the Super Bowl, we have an even clearer
confirmation of who the villain is. Seen in the newly released footage
as a shadowy form like a silhouette of a caped man, the […]</p>

PlayStation Network outage</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-09, updated: 2025-02-09, from: Polygon Website</p>
