7, Tomb Raider, and more new games out this week</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-10, updated: 2025-02-07, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Progress is the theme of the new game releases this week, whether
it’s building an empire over the course of history or piecing your life
back together and writing a song about it. These new games challenge you
with meaningful, incremental progress in the face of what can feel like
impossible odds. It’s not always […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-02-10, updated: 2025-02-10, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds’s open beta 2 provides another opportunity to
test the next of Capcom’s action role-playing series before its launch
later this month. While previously there was a staggered rollout
starting with PS5 owners, this time all platforms can play from the off,
and for those who can’t play over the first set of […]</p>

Auger in Destiny 2</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-10, updated: 2025-02-10, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Finality’s Auger is an exotic weapon in Destiny 2, and is a possible
reward from completing the Sundered Doctrine dungeon. This Linear Fusion
Rifle is a powerhouse in the power slot, with some interesting tricks up
its frilly sleeves, and pairs up nicely with perks and features of the
the Episode is debuts in — […]</p>

<p>The Sundered Doctrine dungeon takes Destiny 2 players back to Rhulk’s
Pyramid for more monsters, more riddles, and most importantly, more
loot. Veterans of the Vow of the Disciple raid will recognise the
mechanics here, albeit with some new twists. Sundered Doctrine is on the
shorter side as far as dungeons go, with just three […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-02-10, updated: 2025-02-10, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>The Super Bowl is such a huge annual event that it transcends
football. A time-honored tradition, even for non-football fans, is to
check out the Super Bowl commercials. With so many eyes on the big game,
and brands bringing their best efforts, there are usually a few fun
shorts to watch. We’ve rounded up the […]</p>

<p>The Super Bowl is as much about the spectacle as it is about the
football. That tradition of spectacle includes the commercials: Super
Bowl ads tend to be big swings, featuring a lot of celebrities and
attention-grabbing ploys. That usually includes movie trailers for the
year’s upcoming blockbusters (and hopeful blockbusters). In recent
years, though, […]</p>

<p>While we don’t know everything about Marvel Studios’ upcoming
Thunderbolts* (like what the asterisk stands for), thanks to the new
trailer released during the Super Bowl, we have an even clearer
confirmation of who the villain is. Seen in the newly released footage
as a shadowy form like a silhouette of a caped man, the […]</p>

PlayStation Network outage</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-09, updated: 2025-02-09, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Sony’s PlayStation Network was down from Friday to Saturday evening.
Surpassing 24 hours, it was one of the decade’s longest unscheduled
outages of a major video game network. The outage was wide-reaching,
including PSN’s account management, social features, the PlayStation
Store, and more. Yet as the service returned online, information on the
cause (let alone the […]</p>
