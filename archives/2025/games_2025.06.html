2025 roadmap includes a new map</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-10, updated: 2025-02-10, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Phasmophobia, the wildly popular co-op ghost hunting game, has been
blowing up on Twitch since at least 2020, and developers Kinetic Games
said Monday that it’s sold more than 22 million copies so far. In 2025,
the team has a jam-packed developmental roadmap, including plans for an
updated look for its famously nondescript player character […]</p>

<p>The candy cloud machine is among the last cooking stations you’ll
unlock in Hello Kitty Island Adventure, and it allows you to make cotton
candy clouds for your besties to much on. While no characters have candy
clouds as their “favorite” items to be gifted, some of the items, like
the Toasted Marshmallow Cloud, are […]</p>

<p>Cyrus is a trainer card that’s taken over battles in Pokémon TCG
Pocket. In the video games, he’s the big boss of the devious Team
Galactic and a major antagonist in the Sinnoh generation. Ever since the

<p>Don’t shoot the messenger, but Valentine’s Day is coming up quickly.

<p>Healing your units after a retreat is critical to winning wars in
Civilization 7 — a game where wars are inevitable, even if you’re not
looking for a Military Victory. But healing in Civilization 7 isn’t very
straightforward, and your units will continue to hang out at low health
unless you know what to do. […]</p>

<p>It felt like magic. The Steam Deck played practically everything when
Valve launched the handheld in 2022. By toggling to low graphical
settings, even Elden Ring ran on the diminutive screen. But in 2025,
gaming’s latest visual spectacles — including critical darlings Indiana
Jones and Dragon’s Dogma 2 — won’t boot on Valve’s now-aging hardware.

<p>Hold your competitive rank close, because it’s going to disappear
next week when Marvel Rivals’ midseason patch drops. In a dev diary post
today, developer NetEase announced that ranks will be reset twice per

<p>Sid Meier’s Civilization 7 doesn’t officially launch until Tuesday,
but players have already assembled a laundry list of criticisms for the
latest installment of the 4X franchise, many of them pointed
particularly at the obtuse UI and lack of basic features from previous
entries. Firaxis has already released a statement detailing plans for
upcoming changes […]</p>

<p>I know I say this every week, but: Damn, what a Severance. But

<p>Sid Meier’s Civilization 7 doesn’t officially launch until Feb. 11,
but that hasn’t stopped folks from data mining the strategy game during
its advanced access period and potentially uncovering future content. A

it’s building an empire over the course of history or piecing your life
back together and writing a song about it. These new games challenge you

<p>Monster Hunter Wilds’s open beta 2 provides another opportunity to
test the next of Capcom’s action role-playing series before its launch
later this month. While previously there was a staggered rollout

<p>Finality’s Auger is an exotic weapon in Destiny 2, and is a possible
reward from completing the Sundered Doctrine dungeon. This Linear Fusion
Rifle is a powerhouse in the power slot, with some interesting tricks up
its frilly sleeves, and pairs up nicely with perks and features of the

<p>The Sundered Doctrine dungeon takes Destiny 2 players back to Rhulk’s
Pyramid for more monsters, more riddles, and most importantly, more
loot. Veterans of the Vow of the Disciple raid will recognise the
mechanics here, albeit with some new twists. Sundered Doctrine is on the
shorter side as far as dungeons go, with just three […]</p>

<p>The Super Bowl is such a huge annual event that it transcends
football. A time-honored tradition, even for non-football fans, is to

<p>The Super Bowl is as much about the spectacle as it is about the
football. That tradition of spectacle includes the commercials: Super
Bowl ads tend to be big swings, featuring a lot of celebrities and
attention-grabbing ploys. That usually includes movie trailers for the
