<p>date: 2025-08-12, from: Taste of Home</p>
<p>You better keep an eye on these fun treats before they disappear!
These cake donuts are dipped in white glaze and drizzled with dark red
corn syrup. Gummy candies and chocolate chips are used for the rest of
the design. They’re fun, creepy and so delicious. —Ronna Farley,

Description: These soft, pillowy bao buns are filled with slices of
rich, savoury Irish black pudding, crisp vegetables, and a tangy sauce

street food nights, or as a creative twist on traditional black pudding
dishes. Preparation Time: 25 minutes Cooking Time: 15 minutes Serving
Size: Makes 8 bao buns Ingredients: 8 ready-made bao buns (steamed) 200g
Irish black pudding, sliced into 1cm thick rounds 1 tbsp vegetable oil ½
cucumber, thinly sliced 1 medium carrot, julienned Small handful fresh
coriander leaves 2 tbsp hoisin sauce (or sweet chilli sauce for extra
kick) 1 tsp sesame seeds (optional, for garnish) Instructions: Cook the
black pudding: Heat vegetable oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Add
black pudding slices and cook for 2–3 minutes per side until crisp on

serve immediately while warm. Tips: For extra flavour, lightly toast the
sesame seeds before sprinkling over the buns. Try adding a few slices of
pickled red onion for a tangy crunch. If making your own bao dough,
allow extra preparation time for proving and steaming.

<h2 id="seaweed-pesto-pasta">SEAWEED PESTO PASTA</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-11, from: Irish Food Hub</p>
<p>
Description: This vibrant and nutrient-packed pasta dish combines the
fresh, herby flavour of traditional pesto with the unique umami taste of
Irish seaweed. Perfect for a quick lunch or dinner, it’s a delicious way
to enjoy the health benefits of seaweed while adding a coastal twist to
your meal. Preparation Time: 10 minutes Cooking Time: 12 minutes Serving
Size: Serves 4 Ingredients: 350g spaghetti or linguine 2 tbsp dried
Irish seaweed flakes (such as dillisk or wakame) 50g fresh basil leaves
50g toasted pine nuts (or walnuts) 2 cloves garlic 60g grated Parmesan
cheese (or vegan alternative) 100ml extra virgin olive oil Juice of ½
lemon Salt and pepper, to taste Instructions: Cook the pasta: Bring a
large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the pasta according to
package instructions until al dente. Reserve ½ cup of cooking water
before draining. Prepare the pesto: In a food processor, combine seaweed
flakes, basil, pine nuts, garlic, Parmesan, and lemon juice. Pulse until
coarsely blended. Add the oil: With the processor running, slowly pour
in olive oil until the mixture becomes a smooth paste. Season with salt
and pepper to taste. Combine: Toss the drained pasta with the pesto,
adding a splash of reserved cooking water if needed to loosen the sauce.
Serve: Divide between bowls and garnish with extra Parmesan and a
sprinkle of seaweed flakes if desired. Tips: For a dairy-free version,
use nutritional yeast instead of Parmesan. Mix in some sautéed cherry
tomatoes or roasted vegetables for extra colour and flavour. Use fresh
chopped seaweed if available for an even more intense flavour.

NORTHERN IRELAND’S UNIQUE HONEYCOMB TREAT – THE STORY OF THIS FAIRGROUND

The Origins of Yellowman Crafting the Perfect Crunch: How Yellowman Is
Made Yellowman at the Auld Lammas Fair Preserving a Sugary Legacy in
Modern Times Introduction: What Is Yellowman? If you’ve ever wandered
through the bustling streets of Ballycastle in County Antrim during the
late summer, you’ve likely seen stalls stacked high with golden, brittle
slabs of a mysterious treat known as Yellowman. This crunchy,
honeycomb-like confection has been a beloved feature of Northern
Ireland’s fairgrounds and festivals for generations, instantly
recognisable by its bright yellow hue and irresistible sugary aroma.
Despite its name, Yellowman doesn’t contain honey—though its airy
texture and caramelised sweetness might remind you of it. Instead, it’s
a type of traditional boiled sugar sweet, similar in structure to
honeycomb toffee or cinder toffee, but with a distinct flavour and
appearance that make it uniquely Northern Irish. Made from a simple
combination of sugar, golden syrup, vinegar, and bicarbonate of soda,
the magic of Yellowman lies in the chemical reaction that causes the
mixture to froth and harden into a crisp, bubbly texture. For many
locals, the sight of Yellowman signals more than just a sugar rush—it
evokes memories of childhood visits to the Auld Lammas Fair, where
generations have snapped off shards of this golden treat from wax paper
wrappers. Its nostalgic appeal continues to draw crowds year after year,
connecting the present-day sweet tooth to centuries-old traditions. A
Sweet Tradition: The Origins of Yellowman The exact origins of Yellowman
are somewhat shrouded in mystery, much like many cherished regional
treats passed down through generations. While similar honeycomb-style
confections can be found in various cultures, Yellowman’s distinct name,
bright colour, and strong association with Northern Ireland set it
apart. It is most famously linked to the Auld Lammas Fair in
Ballycastle, a festival that has been running for over 400 years and is
one of the oldest traditional fairs in Ireland. Some food historians
suggest that Yellowman may have evolved from older European
sugar-boiling traditions, where caramelised sugar was aerated to create
a light, brittle texture. As sugar became more accessible in the 19th
and early 20th centuries, rural Irish sweet-makers may have adapted
these methods, adding their own twist—including the signature
golden-yellow colour that would make the confection stand out in crowded
markets. Others believe the treat was initially made by local
confectioners to attract children and visitors at seasonal fairs. Its
low-cost ingredients, long shelf life, and eye-catching appearance made
it ideal for selling in large quantities. Wrapped in greaseproof paper
and sold in hefty slabs, Yellowman quickly became synonymous with
festive gatherings in County Antrim and beyond. The name “Yellowman”
itself likely emerged as a simple, descriptive term—referring to its
striking colour and perhaps to the ‘man’ or vendor selling it at the
fair. Over time, the treat gained an almost legendary status, with some
families passing down their own guarded recipes, tweaking the balance of
syrup, sugar, and aeration for the perfect crunch. By the mid-20th
century, Yellowman had cemented its role as a cultural icon of Northern
Irish fairs. Its history is not only about sugar and syrup—it’s about
community, shared memories, and the enduring appeal of a humble yet
delightful sweet that continues to bring people together. Crafting the
Perfect Crunch: How Yellowman Is Made While Yellowman’s ingredients are
simple, the magic lies in the method. At its heart, Yellowman is made
from sugar, golden syrup, vinegar, and bicarbonate of soda. Yet,
achieving the perfect texture—light, airy, and crisp without being too
hard—requires skill, timing, and an understanding of the old-fashioned
art of sugar boiling. The process begins by gently heating sugar and
golden syrup in a large pan until they dissolve together into a thick,
bubbling liquid. The vinegar is added next—not for flavour, but to help
prevent the sugar from crystallising, ensuring a smooth, even texture.
Once the mixture reaches the right temperature, the heat is removed, and
the most important ingredient—bicarbonate of soda—is whisked in. This is
the moment of transformation. The bicarbonate reacts with the hot syrup,
releasing carbon dioxide and causing the mixture to foam dramatically.
It’s this reaction that creates the network of tiny air bubbles, giving
Yellowman its signature honeycomb texture. The frothy mixture is quickly
poured onto a prepared surface or tray, where it’s left to cool and
harden. Once set, the slab of Yellowman is broken into pieces—often with
a satisfying crack. Traditionally, it’s wrapped in greaseproof or waxed
paper to keep it fresh and to prevent the sticky edges from clumping
together. Unlike chocolate-coated honeycomb found elsewhere, Yellowman
is served plain, allowing its golden colour and pure caramelised flavour
to shine. Homemade versions are still made in some Northern Irish
kitchens, particularly around fair time, but most people enjoy it from
market stalls, sweet shops, or specialty confectioners who have
perfected their recipes over decades. The challenge lies in balancing
the ingredients so the Yellowman is crunchy yet light, without being
overly sticky or brittle. For those willing to try making it at home,
caution is key—boiled sugar can cause serious burns, and precise timing
is crucial to avoid undercooking or burning. But for those who master
it, the reward is a truly authentic taste of Northern Ireland’s culinary
heritage. Yellowman at the Auld Lammas Fair No discussion of Yellowman
is complete without mentioning the Auld Lammas Fair in Ballycastle,
County Antrim. Held annually on the last Monday and Tuesday of August,
this centuries-old event is one of Ireland’s oldest traditional fairs,
with roots stretching back over 400 years. Originally a harvest market
where livestock, farm goods, and crafts were traded, it has evolved into
a vibrant celebration of music, culture, and food—of which Yellowman is
undoubtedly the star attraction. Stalls selling towering stacks of
Yellowman line the streets during the fair. Vendors wrap the slabs in
waxed paper, often weighing them out in generous portions. The sight of
children clutching their golden sweets as they weave through the
