## The Signal Chat Leak and the NSA

date: 2025-03-31, updated: 2025-03-30, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>US National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, who started the now-infamous group chat coordinating a US attack against the Yemen-based Houthis on March 15, is seemingly now suggesting that the secure messaging service Signal has security vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>&#34;I didn&#8217;t see this loser in the group,&#34; Waltz <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-admins-shifting-explanations-journalist-added-signal-chat/story?id=120179649">told</a> Fox News about <em>Atlantic</em> editor in chief Jeffrey Goldberg, whom Waltz <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/">invited</a> to the chat. &#34;Whether he did it deliberately or it happened in some other technical mean, is something we&#8217;re trying to figure out.&#34;</p>

## HTTPS RR in curl

RFC 9460 describes a DNS Resource Record (RR) named HTTPS. To highlight that it is exactly this DNS record called HTTPS we speak of, we try to always call it HTTPS RR using both words next to each other. curl currently offers experimental support for HTTPS RR in git. Experimental means you need to enable &#8230; <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2025/03/31/https-rr-in-curl/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">HTTPS RR in curl</span> <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>

## 2025-03-28 Locarno Camellia park

<h1 id="2025-03-28-locarno-camellia-park">2025-03-28 Locarno Camellia park</h1>

<p>It’s spring and we went there. Locarno is in the canton Ticino, in the south of Switzerland, at the shores of Lago Maggiore (“big lake”) that it shares with Italy.</p>

<p>They have a fantastic camellia park. In early spring, it&rsquo;s the best place to be.</p>

<p>I tried to take pictures with my trusty Olympus EP-5 and the 30mm 1:3.5 macro lens. Sadly, I have been untrained by the phone and was confused by the settings and the tiny screen. Oh my! So this is mix of camera pictures and phone pictures.</p>

## 2025-03-29 Botanical garden of Gambarogno

<h1 id="2025-03-29-botanical-garden-of-gambarogno">2025-03-29 Botanical garden of Gambarogno</h1>

<p>We went to see the private <a href="https://www.parcobotanicogambarogno.ch/">botanical garden</a> of the Eisenhut gardening center in Gabarogno, across the lake and up the hill from Locarno. They claim to have about a thousand camellia variants and about six hundred magnolia variants. As we’ve been to the <a href="2025-03-25-camellias">camellia park</a> yesterday, we focused on the magnolia in bloom.</p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-03-30, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/images/2024/02/01/runner.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">A new Bluesky news feed, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/radiofreeameri.ca">Radio Free America</a>. It will also be on a web page as a river of news, and of course in <a href="https://feedland.social/opml?screenname=davewiner&catname=radiofree">dynamic OPML</a> so it can be reproduced in lots of places. It will be hard to shut down, if it catches on. The idea: deliver news stories, blog posts and podcasts from sources with ideas and facts an informed person would want. We hope we are helping the United States respond to threats to our freedom, well-being, the rule of law, and our country's friendships around the world. As the depth of what's happening is understood across the country, I believe we may need more flexible sources of news. We use mature tech that's widely deployed, well-understood. And it is completely and utterly one hundred percent billionaire-proof. We start out today with two feeds, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/factpostnews.bsky.social/post/3lfn5pghprs26">FactPost</a> which is the official rapid response page of the Democratic Party, and <a href="http://scripting.com/?tab=links">my linkblog feed</a>, so I can easily test the system. The part that hooks up to Bluesky is relatively new, so we'll need to look at problems. As they say -- <i>still diggin!</i>

## 2025-03-30 Don't visit the USA

date: 2025-03-30, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-03-30-don-t-visit-the-usa">2025-03-30 Don&rsquo;t visit the USA</h1>

<p>When people talk about minimal laptop installs, burner phones, and the
mess of US border crossings, I wonder where they habe been the last
twenty years. A dude from work flew to the states to work for HP as a
student, got turned back at the airport and put on a flight back. He
got to make one family call, his dad called HP, they called some
lawyers and by the time they go there he was already on a plane. And
those were the good days, before 9/11, Homeland Security and all that.</p>

<p>Have you seen the forms they have you sign on the Visa Waiver program?
The border agents have total discretion over you. Those are not &ldquo;passenger
rights&rdquo; but &ldquo;small mercies&rdquo;. And that was long before Trump. It&rsquo;s
terrible fuckery now, but it wasn&rsquo;t great before that. Not travelling
to the states? I&rsquo;ve told people at the office that I won&rsquo;t be going to
the states for work ever since 9/11. The last time I went happily was,
uh, when The Phantom Menace came out?</p>

<p>I went once more when
my wife wanted to go to Hawaii. Somebody there held my hand and
prayed for me on a parking lot. Somebody there gave me an ad for an
underground firing range. I learned how the US treated the locals. No,
visiting the US was never an easy call to make. And those were the
good days.</p>

<p>And what about boycotting the US? It is with despair that I see my
employer buying more and more into Windows and Microsoft and Azure and
Amazon S3. Have they not learned anything from Snowden? American IT is
not to be trusted. I mean, it&rsquo;s probably not be trusted anywhere, but
when give a choice, there is no reason to trust the USA. The agencies
can get all the information they want and hand out gag orders to prevent
the well-meaning corporations to warning you. From the outside, they
are just as bad as the rest of them. And they will use their power against
you. And Snowden was during the good years!</p>

<p>And yes, Fortress Europe is not great, either. Two things being not
great doesn&rsquo;t make a right, though. The first step is to realise how
bad the situation is, how bad the situation has been.</p>

<p>And now the situation really is fucked up.</p>

<p>If you look at the attempts at regime change in recent years,
I think the lessons are obvious: It can only succeed with long, weekly
mass demonstrations, in broad coalitions.</p>

<p>The only way out of a corrupt government
that controls access to jobs, controls the institutions, controls most
media is weekly protest. It takes a long time to grow. You have to
be there, every time. &ldquo;Pumpaj!” Keep the pressure up.</p>

<p>Join whatever protest is on this week.</p>

<p>I also think it is important to not conflate the man with the mob.
Name no names! Because it’s never just one person. If it looks like
one person then that person is the face man of the mob. The people that
need kicking are all those that got their jobs from the mob. All these
greedy incompetents whose only qualification is how far they can bend
over.</p>

<p>Yeet them into the sun. Send them off to Mars. Whatever.</p>

<p>To think that Canadians or Greenlanders want to be part of the USA is
about as absurd to me as Taiwanese wanting to be part of mainland China
or Ukrainians wanting to be part of Russia. The only ones not getting it
are the sympathisers of the dread regimes in China, in Russia &ndash; and in the USA.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23USA">#USA</a></p>

<p><strong>2025-03-31</strong>. I keep learning new things. This is from a post about US politicians visiting Greenland.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Americans might chuckle at that idea, but such arrogance is unwarranted. We are the only ones ever to have invoked Article 5, the mutual defense obligation of the NATO treaty, after 9/11; and our European allies did respond. Per capita more Danish soldiers were killed in the Afghan war than were American soldiers … and of course defending against a Russian attack is the NATO mission. But right now the United States is supporting Russia in its war against Ukraine. No one is doing more to contain the Russian threat than Ukraine. Indeed, Ukraine is in effect fulfilling the entire NATO mission, right now, by absorbing a huge Russian attack. – <a href="https://snyder.substack.com/p/vance-in-greenland">The Imperialism Has no Clothes</a>, by Timothy Snyder</p>

## ★ ‘The Studio’ Is Fantastic So Far

date: 2025-03-30, updated: 2025-03-30, from: Daring Fireball

Perhaps Apple’s leadership simply believes, as I do, that cinema is the grandest and greatest form of art the world has ever seen — one that encompasses acting, writing, photography and/or illustration, and music — and but that great cinema is expensive and delicate and needs, from deep-pocketed studios and their deeper-pocketed corporate parents, more than patrons, but *champions*.
