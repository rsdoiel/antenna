## Rational Astrologies and Security

date: 2025-04-02, updated: 2025-04-01, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>John Kelsey and I wrote a short paper for the <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/events/rossfest/">Rossfest Festschrift</a>: &#8220;<a href="https://www.schneier.com/academic/archives/2025/03/rational-astrologies-and-security.html">Rational Astrologies and Security</a>&#8220;:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is another non-security way that designers can spend their security budget: on making their own lives easier. Many of these fall into the category of what has been called rational astrology. First identified by Randy Steve Waldman [Wal12], the term refers to something people treat as though it works, generally for social or institutional reasons, even when there’s little evidence that it works&#8212;­and sometimes despite substantial evidence that it does not...</p></blockquote>

## Running the LAMP Stack in a Lamp Rack

date: 2025-04-01, from: Jeff Geerling blog

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Running the LAMP Stack in a Lamp Rack</span>

            <p></p>

<p>I typically don't do anything for April Fool's Day, but this year I thought I'd unite a bit of a meme in the homelab community with something I wanted to make a video on anyway: a <em>lamp rack</em>.</p>

<p>What's a lamp rack? Well, you're looking at one! It's a floor lamp with an integrated <a href="https://mini-rack.jeffgeerling.com">mini rack</a>!</p>

<p>I didn't want to make a video about a floor lamp, but more on the fact you don't <em>need</em> fancy racks or any new hardware at <em>all</em> to start a homelab.</p>

How did the music industry get through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)#Hip-hop">hip-hop sampling</a> in the 80s without blowing itself up?

## Cell Phone OPSEC for Border Crossings

date: 2025-04-01, updated: 2025-03-30, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>I have heard stories of more aggressive interrogation of electronic devices at US border crossings. I know a lot about securing computers, but very little about securing phones.</p>
<p>Are there easy ways to delete data&#8212;files, photos, etc.&#8212;on phones so it can&#8217;t be recovered? Does resetting a phone to factory defaults erase data, or is it still recoverable? That is, does the reset erase the old encryption key, or just sever the password that access that key? When the phone is rebooted, are deleted files still available?</p>
<p>We need answers for both iPhones and Android phones. And it&#8217;s not just the US; the world is going to become a more dangerous place to oppose state power...</p>

The <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2025/03/25/severanceArt.png">beautiful art</a> that came with the season finale of Severance could have been drawn by ChatGPT, it's that good, in the way that machine art is good. There's a point of view reflected in its creations, looking into a soul that in no way exists. We're learning about it, but it's a moving target, evolving before our eyes, in huge steps.

It coughed up a link to <a href="http://scripting.com/2023/02/02/133127.html">this piece</a> from two years ago, when Twitter pulled the plug on their API. It knocked everything I had built on the Twitter API off the air. Every thing. Just like that. That's what tonight was like here. It was just some of my apps, suddenly, not working. Whew.

It’s like a consortium of sketchy pawn shops complaining to the authorities after a retailer successfully cracked down on an organized shoplifting/pickpocketing ring, and the authorities then fining the retailer for the damage to the pawnbrokers’ business fencing stolen goods — and for exposing the police as ineffective.

## 2025-03-30 Don't visit the USA

date: 2025-03-31, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-03-30-don-t-visit-the-usa">2025-03-30 Don&rsquo;t visit the USA</h1>

<p>When people talk about minimal laptop installs, burner phones, and the
mess of US border crossings, I wonder where they habe been the last
twenty years. A dude from work flew to the states to work for HP as a
student, got turned back at the airport and put on a flight back. He
got to make one family call, his dad called HP, they called some
lawyers and by the time they go there he was already on a plane. And
those were the good days, before 9/11, Homeland Security and all that.</p>

<p>Have you seen the forms they have you sign on the Visa Waiver program?
The border agents have total discretion over you. Those are not &ldquo;passenger
rights&rdquo; but &ldquo;small mercies&rdquo;. And that was long before Trump. It&rsquo;s
terrible fuckery now, but it wasn&rsquo;t great before that. Not travelling
to the states? I&rsquo;ve told people at the office that I won&rsquo;t be going to
the states for work ever since 9/11. The last time I went happily was,
uh, when The Phantom Menace came out?</p>

<p>I went once more when
my wife wanted to go to Hawaii. Somebody there held my hand and
prayed for me on a parking lot. Somebody there gave me an ad for an
underground firing range. I learned how the US treated the locals. No,
visiting the US was never an easy call to make. And those were the
good days.</p>

<p>And what about boycotting the US? It is with despair that I see my
employer buying more and more into Windows and Microsoft and Azure and
Amazon S3. Have they not learned anything from Snowden? American IT is
not to be trusted. I mean, it&rsquo;s probably not be trusted anywhere, but
when give a choice, there is no reason to trust the USA. The agencies
can get all the information they want and hand out gag orders to prevent
the well-meaning corporations from warning you. From the outside, they
are just as bad as the rest of them. And they will use their power against
you. And Snowden was during the good years!</p>

<p>And yes, Fortress Europe is not great, either. Two things being not
great doesn&rsquo;t make a right, though. The first step is to realise how
bad the situation is, how bad the situation has been.</p>

<p>And now the situation really is fucked up.</p>

<p>If you look at the attempts at regime change in recent years,
I think the lessons are obvious: It can only succeed with long, weekly
mass demonstrations, in broad coalitions.</p>

<p>The only way out of a corrupt government
that controls access to jobs, controls the institutions, controls most
media is weekly protest. It takes a long time to grow. You have to
be there, every time. &ldquo;Pumpaj!” Keep the pressure up.</p>

<p>Join whatever protest is on this week.</p>

<p>I also think it is important to not conflate the man with the mob.
Name no names! Because it’s never just one person. If it looks like
one person then that person is the face man of the mob. The people that
need kicking are all those that got their jobs from the mob. All these
greedy incompetents whose only qualification is how far they can bend
over.</p>

<p>Yeet them into the sun. Send them off to Mars. Whatever.</p>

<p>To think that Canadians or Greenlanders want to be part of the USA is
about as absurd to me as Taiwanese wanting to be part of mainland China
or Ukrainians wanting to be part of Russia. The only ones not getting it
are the sympathisers of the dread regimes in China, in Russia &ndash; and in the USA.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23USA">#USA</a></p>

<p><strong>2025-03-31</strong>. I keep learning new things. This is from a post about US politicians visiting Greenland.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Americans might chuckle at that idea, but such arrogance is unwarranted. We are the only ones ever to have invoked Article 5, the mutual defense obligation of the NATO treaty, after 9/11; and our European allies did respond. Per capita more Danish soldiers were killed in the Afghan war than were American soldiers … and of course defending against a Russian attack is the NATO mission. But right now the United States is supporting Russia in its war against Ukraine. No one is doing more to contain the Russian threat than Ukraine. Indeed, Ukraine is in effect fulfilling the entire NATO mission, right now, by absorbing a huge Russian attack. … Denmark meanwhile has given more than four times as much aid to Ukraine, per capita, as does the United States. … The US is is 24th in the world in the happiness rankings. Not bad. But Denmark is number two (after Finland). On a scale of 1 to 100, Freedom House ranks Denmark 97 and the US 84 on freedom — and the US will drop a great deal this year. An American is about ten times more likely to be incarcerated than a Dane. Danes have access to universal and essentially free health care; Americans spend a huge amount of money to be sick more often and to be treated worse when they are. Danes on average live four years longer than Americans. In Denmark university education is free; the average balance owed by the tens of millions of Americans who hold student debt in the US is about $40,000. Danish parents share a year of paid parental leave. In the US, one parent might get twelve weeks of unpaid leave. – <a href="https://snyder.substack.com/p/vance-in-greenland">The Imperialism Has no Clothes</a>, by Timothy Snyder</p>

## More ChatGPT fun

date: 2025-03-31, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Yesterday I uploaded an image of a pizza pie, in a New York pizzeria, with a couple dressed in evening clothes with a NYC cop and off-duty sanitation worker lurking in the background. </p>
<p>Paolo Valdemarin writes from London, "Have you tried adding more images to a prompt? From my experiments it can easily keep 'in mind' five different images and mix them. You can get a bunch of people sitting in the same room, with a very detailed version of the room." He sent two examples which are somewhat embarrassing, but you'll probably enjoy them. :-)</p>
<p>First, he uploaded my profile picture from Facebook. And asked ChatGPT to add me to the picture and then to "sit him next to the couple, with both of them kissing him on the cheek, and as you can see ChatGPT complied!</p>

## The Signal Chat Leak and the NSA

date: 2025-03-31, updated: 2025-03-30, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>US National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, who started the now-infamous group chat coordinating a US attack against the Yemen-based Houthis on March 15, is seemingly now suggesting that the secure messaging service Signal has security vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>&#34;I didn&#8217;t see this loser in the group,&#34; Waltz <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-admins-shifting-explanations-journalist-added-signal-chat/story?id=120179649">told</a> Fox News about <em>Atlantic</em> editor in chief Jeffrey Goldberg, whom Waltz <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/">invited</a> to the chat. &#34;Whether he did it deliberately or it happened in some other technical mean, is something we&#8217;re trying to figure out.&#34;</p>

## 2025-03-28 Locarno Camellia park

<h1 id="2025-03-28-locarno-camellia-park">2025-03-28 Locarno Camellia park</h1>

<p>It’s spring and we went there. Locarno is in the canton Ticino, in the south of Switzerland, at the shores of Lago Maggiore (“big lake”) that it shares with Italy.</p>

<p>They have a fantastic camellia park. In early spring, it&rsquo;s the best place to be.</p>

<p>I tried to take pictures with my trusty Olympus EP-5 and the 30mm 1:3.5 macro lens. Sadly, I have been untrained by the phone and was confused by the settings and the tiny screen. Oh my! So this is mix of camera pictures and phone pictures.</p>

<p>We went to see the private <a href="https://www.parcobotanicogambarogno.ch/">botanical garden</a> of the Eisenhut gardening center in Gabarogno, across the lake and up the hill from Locarno. They claim to have about a thousand camellia variants and about six hundred magnolia variants. As we’ve been to the <a href="2025-03-25-camellias">camellia park</a> yesterday, we focused on the magnolia in bloom.</p>

It will also be on a web page as a river of news, and of course in <a href="https://feedland.social/opml?screenname=davewiner&catname=radiofree">dynamic OPML</a> so it can be reproduced in lots of places. It will be hard to shut down, if it catches on. The idea: deliver news stories, blog posts and podcasts from sources with ideas and facts an informed person would want. We hope we are helping the United States respond to threats to our freedom, well-being, the rule of law, and our country's friendships around the world. As the depth of what's happening is understood across the country, I believe we may need more flexible sources of news. We use mature tech that's widely deployed, well-understood. And it is completely and utterly one hundred percent billionaire-proof. We start out today with two feeds, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/factpostnews.bsky.social/post/3lfn5pghprs26">FactPost</a> which is the official rapid response page of the Democratic Party, and <a href="http://scripting.com/?tab=links">my linkblog feed</a>, so I can easily test the system. The part that hooks up to Bluesky is relatively new, so we'll need to look at problems. As they say -- <i>still diggin!</i>

## ★ ‘The Studio’ Is Fantastic So Far

Perhaps Apple’s leadership simply believes, as I do, that cinema is the grandest and greatest form of art the world has ever seen — one that encompasses acting, writing, photography and/or illustration, and music — and but that great cinema is expensive and delicate and needs, from deep-pocketed studios and their deeper-pocketed corporate parents, more than patrons, but *champions*.
