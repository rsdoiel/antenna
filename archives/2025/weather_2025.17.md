Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0344 AM CDT Fri May 02 2025

Valid 051200Z - 101200Z

...DISCUSSION...
...Day 4/Monday - Southern High Plains...
Lee cyclogenesis will strengthen on Monday in the southern High
Plains as a mid-level trough advects eastward. As this occurs, rich
low-level moisture will advect into West Texas which will result in
strong instability as temperatures continue to cool aloft. Expect
scattered thunderstorm development along the dryline during the
afternoon/evening. However, more widespread storm development is
likely after 00Z as the low-level jet strengthens across West Texas.
Initial supercells will have a threat for all severe weather hazards
before eventual upscale growth into a MCS likely results in a
greater severe wind threat. 

...Day 5/Tuesday - Central/East Texas into Louisiana...
Day 4 thunderstorms will likely be ongoing at the beginning of the
period along a frontal zone across central/East Texas and persist
eastward through the day. Destabilization remains questionable as
strong high pressure and the low-latitude nature of the mid-level
trough may limit northward movement of the warm front. The potential
for this front to be stationary, in addition to widespread
convection/cloud cover concerns along the front, preclude severe
weather probabilities at this time. However, there will likely be a
corridor along the frontal zone with some greater severe weather
threat which may become more clear as the event draws closer.

Additional severe storms will be possible Day 6 and 7 along the
frontal zone/composite outflow in Texas, but the location of this
feature and degree of destabilization along it will be highly
dependent on prior days convective activity. For these reasons, no
probabilities have been added at this time.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0140 AM CDT Fri May 02 2025

Valid 031200Z - 041200Z

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will continue to be focused across the
Southwest as isolated to scattered thunderstorms develop through
late Saturday afternoon. Upper ridging is expected to spread across
the High Plains through the day as an upper wave begins to approach
the West Coast. Southerly low/mid-level flow ahead of the upper wave
will help maintain a modestly moist air mass (characterized by 0.4
to 0.6 inch PWAT values) across the Southwest into the Great Basin.
Increasing broad scale ascent, coupled with antecedent steep
mid-level lapse rates, will promote isolated thunderstorms from
central NM to central NV by late afternoon. Limited moisture
throughout the column combined with deep boundary layers will act to
limit precipitation amounts and support dry lightning strikes. While
this potential is noted across a broad swath of the region, the fire
weather threat will be greatest across eastern AZ into NM where fuel
conditions are currently the driest per recent fuel and drought
guidance.

Mesoscale Discussion 0634
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0322 PM CDT Thu May 01 2025

Areas affected...western MD/eastern WV Panhandles into south-central
PA

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 012022Z - 012145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A single, slow-moving supercell may persist for the next
couple hours with a threat of large hail and localized damaging
winds. Confidence is low in greater coverage/longevity for a
potential severe thunderstorm watch.

DISCUSSION...A supercell centered on Allegany County, MD has had the
most impressive observational structure per radar/satellite trends,
relative to other severe storms in the Upper OH Valley/Lower Great
Lakes region. This cell appears to be anchored near a slow-moving
warm front, likely ingesting a mesoscale ribbon of mid 60s surface
dew points southeastward along the WV/VA/MD border area. Given the
relatively confined region of this enhancement, with a substantially
drier air mass both to the northeast and south, the longevity of a
sustained supercell structure is questionable. However, it is
plausible that a localized severe hail/wind threat may continue for
the next couple hours.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0246 PM CDT Thu May 01 2025

Valid 012000Z - 021200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS OF
THE OHIO VALLEY AND ACROSS TEXAS AND OKLAHOMA....

...SUMMARY...
Lines and/or clusters of strong to severe thunderstorms are likely
to impact parts of the Ohio Valley into lower Great Lakes, parts of
the lower Mississippi Valley, and the southern Great Plains through
tonight.

...20z...
The broad and rather nebulous severe threat continues across much of
the central and eastern CONUS. Damaging wind and marginally severe
hail potential will continue across parts of the OH Valley ahead of
the intensifying band of thunderstorms this afternoon/evening.
Trimming was done behind the line over the lower Great lakes and
Midwest, where limited forcing for ascent, less buoyancy and weaker
vertical shear are in place. While an isolated stronger storm
remains possible, the lack of greater storm organization should
curtail higher severe potential through the remainder of today.

Farther south across the Mid MS and TN Valley, isolated strong to
occasionally severe storms will remain possible over a broad area
this afternoon. The warm and moist air mass will support some risk
for occasional strong, water-loaded downdrafts with damaging gust
potential. However, the coverage of severe storms appears low and
the SLGT has been removed.

Otherwise, the severe risk remains largely unchanged over parts of
the Southern Plains. Isolated storms, including a few supercells,
are possible over parts of central TX with a risk for damaging winds
and hail. High-based convection ongoing over southeastern CO should
continue to gradually grow upscale into this evening over parts of
the TX/OK Panhandles. Damaging gusts and some hail are possible. By
late tonight, an increasingly strong southerly low-level jet will
support the development of additional storms ahead of this complex.
Merging cells and bowing structures will pose a risk of damaging
gusts, hail and isolated tornadoes overnight across parts of central
OK and the Red River valley.

..Lyons.. 05/01/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1109 AM CDT Thu May 01 2025/

...OH Valley...
Morning water vapor imagery shows a progressive and large shortwave
trough moving across parts of MO/IL.  Forcing ahead of this trough
will lead to scattered thunderstorm development over eastern IN and
central KY, with storms spreading northeastward through the
afternoon and early evening.  Forecast soundings show deep and
moderately strong southwest flow aloft.  This coupled with
sufficient CAPE will pose a threat of organized lines/clusters of
storms capable of damaging wind gusts.  Activity is expected to
spread into western NY/PA during the early evening before weakening.


...Central TX...
A weak surface boundary extends from west-central LA westward into
central TX this morning.  Strong heating and ample moisture
along/south of the boundary will yield max CAPE values over 4000
J/kg by late afternoon.  Most 12z CAM solutions indicate at least
isolated intense convection forming in this corridor.  Those storms
that form will pose a risk of very large hail and damaging winds. 
Other intense storms may form off the high terrain of northern
Mexico and build into parts of central TX this evening.

...TX Panhandle into OK...
A combination of strong heating and upslope low-level winds into the
Raton mesa will aid in the development of a cluster of thunderstorms
over southeast CO this afternoon.  This activity will track
southeastward into a progressively more moist/unstable air mass over
the TX panhandle and western OK, where a few more intense storms are
expected.  Cells and bowing structures will pose a risk of large
hail and damaging winds.  By late tonight, other storms are expected
to form ahead of this complex, affecting parts of central OK with a
risk of large hail.

Valid 031200Z - 041200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS MAINLY SATURDAY
AFTERNOON/EVENING FROM THE SOUTHEAST INTO THE MID-ATLANTIC AND
SOUTHERN NEW ENGLAND...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated strong to severe storms are possible on Saturday from the
Southeast to southern New England and across deep South Texas.

...Mid-Atlantic into the Southeast...
Somewhat of a blocking pattern will evolve over the CONUS by
Saturday, with a closed low over the mid MS/lower OH Valleys,
downstream from a ridge over the Plains, and another closed low near
southern CA.  Weak surface cyclogenesis is expected across the OH
Valley downstream from the closed midlevel low, with a cold front
trailing southwestward to south TX.  A broad warm sector with
boundary-layer dewpoints in the 60s is expected from the
Mid-Atlantic into the Southeast, though substantial convection
through Friday/D2 casts some uncertainty on the quality of buoyancy
in the warm sector from the OH Valley into AL by Saturday.  Assuming
a few pockets of surface heating coincident with the band of
stronger midlevel flow east-through-southeast of the midlevel low,
there could be a few clusters/line segments capable of producing
isolated wind damage.  

Stronger surface heating/destabilization is expected east of the
Appalachians, but forcing for ascent will be weak and storm coverage
is uncertain well east of the higher terrain during the afternoon,
with storm development more probable from the Piedmont and Blue
Ridge northeastward into eastern PA/southeastern NY.  Isolated wind
damage and some hail will be possible.

There is potential for an eventual upgrade to SLGT risk for a
portion of the MRGL area, pending more clarity regarding the
influence of convection prior to D3.

...Deep South TX...
A surface cold front, likely modified by convective outflow Friday
night, is expected to move southward into South TX early Saturday. 
There is substantial uncertainty regarding the location of the
effective front, which likewise casts doubt on the potential for
additional storm development by Saturday afternoon.  Will maintain
the MRGL in this update, but it may need to be removed in subsequent
updates.

Valid 021200Z - 031200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FRIDAY AFTERNOON
INTO EARLY FRIDAY NIGHT FROM CENTRAL TEXAS TO MIDDLE TENNESSEE AND
CENTRAL KENTUCKY...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong to severe thunderstorms are expected from central
Texas to middle Tennessee and central Kentucky Friday afternoon into
early Friday night.  Large hail and damaging winds are the main
threats.

...Synopsis...
Downstream from a ridge over the Great Basin, a shortwave trough now
amplifying over the northern High Plains will continue southeastward
across KS/OK/MO/AR on Friday.  A separate/lead shortwave trough will
eject quickly northeastward from the Great Lakes to the Saint
Lawrence Valley.  The lead shortwave trough will be associated with
a weak surface cyclone across southeast QC and a trailing cold front
into the lower Great Lakes.  Farther southwest, the surface pattern
will likely be modulated by the effects of overnight convection from
D1 that will likely be ongoing at the start of the period from north
TX and southern/eastern OK into western AR.

...Central TX to middle TN...
Differential heating and outflow from the early convection will
reinforce a baroclinic zone during the day from north/central TX
into central AR.  Surface heating/destabilization in advance of the
remnant morning convection should result in re-invigoration of the
convection by early afternoon across parts of the Mid-South and TN
Valley, where the storm environment will favor clusters/line
segments capable of producing occasional wind damage and large hail.


Strong surface heating will occur south of the morning convection in
TX where afternoon MLCAPE will likely exceed 2000 J/kg.  The eastern
extension of an EML, effective bulk shear of 30-40 kt and stronger
flow aloft will favor a mix of supercells and multicell clusters
capable of producing large hail (2 to 3 inches in diameter with the
more persistent supercells).  There will also be some increase in
the threat for wind damage as storms consolidate into one or more
larger clusters and continue moving southeastward toward the TX
coast and south central TX into Friday night.  

...Southern Appalachians to eastern NY...
The ejecting/lead shortwave trough will provide a glancing influence
across NY during the afternoon, where a weakly unstable warm sector
is expected.  Though buoyancy will not be particularly large (MLCAPE
generally less than 1000 J/kg), some enhancement to midlevel flow
(up to 40 kt) and steepened low-level lapse rates in the afternoon
could support isolated wind damage with cell/small clusters. 
Farther south, flow aloft will be weaker, though stronger surface
heating/larger buoyancy will compensate.  Storm coverage is expected
to remain widely scattered (more probable closer to the higher
terrain/Blue Ridge), but thermodynamic profiles will favor
sufficiently strong downdrafts for isolated wind damage.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1156 AM CDT Thu May 01 2025

Valid 011700Z - 021200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

Very dry conditions are expected across southern Arizona into West
Texas. Downslope winds leeward of the Sacramento Mountains in
southeast New Mexico could support brief period of a localized
elevated fire weather threat this afternoon, but larger scale
Elevated highlights are not expected across southern New Mexico.
Otherwise, forecast (see below) remains on track.

..Williams.. 05/01/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1228 AM CDT Thu May 01 2025/

...Synopsis...
On the backside of a midlevel trough over the Midwest, surface high
pressure will build over the western CONUS. This large-scale pattern
will limit the overlap of dry/windy conditions over dry fuels across
the CONUS -- mitigating fire-weather concerns.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1109 AM CDT Thu May 01 2025

Valid 011630Z - 021200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE LOWER MS
VALLEY THROUGH THE TN AND OH VALLEYS INTO THE LOWER GREAT
LAKES...AND FROM THE TX/OK PAHANDLES EASTWARD ACROSS OK AND NORTH
AND CENTRAL TX....

...SUMMARY...
Lines and/or clusters of strong to severe thunderstorms are likely
to impact parts of the Ohio Valley into lower Great Lakes, parts of
the lower Mississippi Valley, and the southern Great Plains this
afternoon through tonight.

...OH Valley...
Morning water vapor imagery shows a progressive and large shortwave
trough moving across parts of MO/IL.  Forcing ahead of this trough
will lead to scattered thunderstorm development over eastern IN and
central KY, with storms spreading northeastward through the
afternoon and early evening.  Forecast soundings show deep and
moderately strong southwest flow aloft.  This coupled with
sufficient CAPE will pose a threat of organized lines/clusters of
storms capable of damaging wind gusts.  Activity is expected to
spread into western NY/PA during the early evening before weakening.


...Central TX...
A weak surface boundary extends from west-central LA westward into
central TX this morning.  Strong heating and ample moisture
along/south of the boundary will yield max CAPE values over 4000
J/kg by late afternoon.  Most 12z CAM solutions indicate at least
isolated intense convection forming in this corridor.  Those storms
that form will pose a risk of very large hail and damaging winds. 
Other intense storms may form off the high terrain of northern
Mexico and build into parts of central TX this evening.

...TX Panhandle into OK...
A combination of strong heating and upslope low-level winds into the
Raton mesa will aid in the development of a cluster of thunderstorms
over southeast CO this afternoon.  This activity will track
southeastward into a progressively more moist/unstable air mass over
the TX panhandle and western OK, where a few more intense storms are
expected.  Cells and bowing structures will pose a risk of large
hail and damaging winds.  By late tonight, other storms are expected
to form ahead of this complex, affecting parts of central OK with a
risk of large hail.

Mesoscale Discussion 0623
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0307 PM CDT Wed Apr 30 2025

Areas affected...Eastern Kentucky

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 302007Z - 302200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated damaging winds and potentially marginally severe
hail may occur with the strongest storms. A watch is not likely this
afternoon.

DISCUSSION...A very moist airmass (mid/upper 60s F dewpoints) is in
place in the Upper Ohio Valley vicinity. On the southern fringe of a
belt of stronger mid-level flow, effective shear is a modest 25-30
kts. Around 1500 J/kg MLCAPE will promote a few stronger to
marginally severe storms. Low-level lapse rates are steep and
damaging winds are the primary threat. Mid-level lapse rates
(sampled by this mornings soundings) are modest. Small to perhaps
isolated, marginally severe hail may occur with the strongest
storms.

0253 PM CDT Wed Apr 30 2025

Areas affected...western and central Arkansas

Concerning...Tornado Watch 197...

Valid 301953Z - 302200Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 197 continues.

SUMMARY...A line of strong to severe storms will continue eastward
the next several hours. Damaging gusts and a tornado or two remain
possible. A downstream watch will likely be needed.

DISCUSSION...The line of convection across western AR will continue
to shift east at around 35 kt the next few hours. downstream,
filtered heating has allowed temperatures to warm into the low/mid
80s amid low/mid 60s F dewpoints. Midlevel lapse rates remain
modest, but the moist environment is fostering modest instability
amid a moderately sheared environment. Given stronger heating ahead
of the line, low-level lapse rates have steepened considerable, and
this may foster a continued risk for damaging gusts into early
evening. A new watch downstream from Tornado Watch 197 will likely
be needed in the next hour.

Mesoscale Discussion 0621
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0240 PM CDT Wed Apr 30 2025

Areas affected...East-central Missouri into southern Illinois

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 301940Z - 302145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...A few storms are possible along an outflow boundary. All
severe hazards would be possible. A watch is uncertain in the short
term, but issuance is possible this afternoon depending on
observational trends.

DISCUSSION...Airmass modification after earlier convection has been
evident over the past couple of hours in central Missouri and
southern Illinois. The primary outflow boundary is situated just
south of St. Louis and extends into far southern Illinois and
southern Indiana. Dewpoints south of the boundary have increased to
upper 60s F except for parts of southeastern Missouri which has only
recovered into the low 60s F. North of the outflow boundary, stable
billow clouds remain. However, very near the boundary temperatures
and dewpoints have increased and at least some MLCIN has been
removed and convection has begun to slowly deepen.

With 40 kts of effective shear (more favorably oriented across the
boundary on its western half), supercells would be expected if
storms develop. Large hail and damaging winds would be possible. A
tornado or two would also be possible for storms interacting with
the more backed easterly/southeasterly winds on the cooler side of
the boundary. Being in the wake of an earlier MCV, forcing for
ascent will be nebulous and will depend on heating/destabilization
along the outflow. Trends will continue to be monitored. A watch is
possible this afternoon.

evening from the southern Plains into the Lower Ohio Valley, with
the greatest risk expected across north-central Texas into the
ArkLaTex region. Large to very large hail, damaging winds, and
tornadoes are all possible, with some strong-tornado potential.

...Synopsis...
Early morning satellite imagery shows a mature convective complex
over western OK and northwest TX, another decaying convective
complex over southern MO, and a shortwave trough moving across the
Southwest. Recent surface analysis shows a mesolow associated with
western OK/northwest TX MCS over the SPS vicinity, with another,
more substantial low back southwest near SNK. An outflow boundary
from prior convection extends from south-central OK through
southeastern OK before becoming more diffuse and merging with the
stationary front over central AR.

The ongoing MCS is forecast to continue eastward/northeastward
throughout the day while the Southwest shortwave progresses into the
southern High Plains. Farther east, the stationary front that
extends from AR into the Mid-Atlantic is expected to begin
translating back northward as a warm front. 

...North TX/Southern OK into the Arklatex and Mid-South...
The well-organized MCS currently tracking across southwest OK and
northwest TX is forecast to continue east-northeastward throughout
much of the period. The northern portion of this system will likely
remain progressive, moving through southern OK and north TX.
Damaging gusts and occasional hail will be possible with this system
throughout much of its lifecycle. Buoyancy decreases with eastern
extent, so the system should begin to lose intensity, but its
organized character limits the predictability of where that will
occur. Not only that, but downstream destabilization could lead to
potential reintensification/redevelopment along the outflow during
the late afternoon. Vertical shear will be modest, suggesting
reorganization into a severe convective line appears unlikely. 

The southwestern portion of this MCS is expected to trail behind the
more forward-progression portion as it becomes more parallel to the
deep-layer shear vector. This orientation would likely keep deep
convection out of central/northeast TX before this afternoon. Storm
development appears probable across central TX as the surface low
and associated dryline shifts eastward ahead of the Southwest
shortwave trough. Development is possible ahead of this dryline
within the destabilized warm sector over northeast TX as well. Lapse
rates will be modest, but ample low-level moisture will still result
in moderate to strong buoyancy during the afternoon. Additionally, a
belt of stronger low-level flow is anticipated to persist,
supporting strong low-level shear and veering low-level hodographs.
The conditions support the potential for supercells capable of all
severe hazards, including tornadoes.

Eventual storm clustering could lead to development of a nocturnal
MCS that could eventually approach parts of the lower MS Valley,
with at least an isolated severe threat.  

...West TX into Northwest TX/Southwest OK...
Additional strong to severe storms will be possible across parts of
west TX, in closer proximity to shortwave trough moving across the
southern High Plains. Cold temperatures aloft and steep lapse rates
will support a threat of hail and localized severe gusts, even
though deep-layer flow/shear will be more modest within this regime.
These storms may eventually spread toward southwest OK/northwest TX
before weakening. 

...Parts of MS/OH Valleys...
Afternoon thunderstorm development is anticipated amid modest
low-level moisture advection in the wake of the convective cluster
currently moving through southwest MO. Modest buoyancy and shear
across the region suggest there is some potential for at least
transient storm organization in the vicinity of the frontal zone,
with an attendant threat for hail, locally damaging wind, and
possibly a tornado.

...Southern VA/northern NC...
Scattered storm development will be possible near the front across
parts of VA/NC. Deep-layer flow/shear will generally be weak, but
steep low-level lapse rates could support locally damaging outflow
winds with the strongest storms.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 196
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1255 AM CDT Wed Apr 30 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Southwest and South-Central Oklahoma
  Northwest and North-Central Texas

* Effective this Wednesday morning from 1255 AM until 800 AM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
    inches in diameter likely
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Strong to severe thunderstorms are expected to persist
throughout the night in the vicinity of an outflow boundary that
extends across the region. Hail will be the primary risk with this
more cellular development. There is also some potential for the
storms in west TX to evolve into an organized line segment that
could progress across the region later. Damaging gusts would be the
primary risk with this more linear activity.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 50
statute miles north and south of a line from 50 miles south
southwest of Altus OK to 30 miles south southeast of Mcalester OK.
For a complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch
outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU6).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

Areas affected...Portions of South Plains into western North Texas

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 190...

Valid 292055Z - 292230Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 190
continues.

SUMMARY...A localized corridor of tornado potential may develop over
the next few hours. Storms will need to root along/east of the
surface boundary for this potential to be realized.

DISCUSSION...A cluster of supercells, some of which have produced
greater than 2 inch hail, are generally rooted just on the cool side
of the surface cold front. If storms can remain discrete and track
with a more eastward motion, warm/moist easterly surface winds are
in the warm sector. Greater tornado potential would exist should
that scenario occur. Given at least a modest increase in low-level
flow this evening, it is possible the boundary moves slightly
northwestward. Trends will be monitored.

Mesoscale Discussion 0607

0335 PM CDT Tue Apr 29 2025

Areas affected...Parts of eastern Oklahoma into Northwest Arkansas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 292035Z - 292230Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Storms that are currently elevated may produce marginally
severe hail. A watch is not anticipated in the short term, but
trends will be monitored.

DISCUSSION...Storms in central Oklahoma have remained elevated and
sub-severe so far. The observed 18Z Norman sounding showed modestly
steep mid-level lapse rates, but relatively weak buoyancy due to
cloud cover/precipitation. This activity will generally move to the
east/northeast behind an outflow boundary. Recent surface
observations have shown some airmass modification/recovery in
east-central Oklahoma where temperatures have warmed back into the
low 70s. There is at least low potential that storms nearest to the
outflow boundary could become near to surface based. A locally
greater severe threat would be possible in that scenario. Overall,
however, storms will primarily be capable of marginally severe hail
and perhaps isolated damaging gusts.

0327 PM CDT Tue Apr 29 2025

Areas affected...southern IL/IN into southwest OH.

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 188...189...

Valid 292027Z - 292230Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 188, 189
continues.

SUMMARY...Strong to severe thunderstorms producing damaging wind
gusts will move from southern Illinois into southern Indiana the
next 1-2 hours. Additional severe risk may redevelop into southwest
Ohio this evening.

DISCUSSION...A mature MCS continues to move from southern IL into
southern IN this afternoon. This activity has sporadically produced
damaging gusts and isolated hail over the last couple of hours, with
a couple areas of line-embedded rotation also noted. These storms
should maintain intensity as it moves east across a moderately
unstable airmass with steepening low-level lapse rates continuing to
support damaging wind potential across Severe Thunderstorm Watch
189. 

By evening, this MCS is expected to approach southwest OH and Severe
Thunderstorm Watch 188. The airmass across this area has shown signs
of recovery from a midday cluster of severe storms now approaching
western PA. Temperatures have rebounded into the mid/upper 70s with
dewpoints in the mid/upper 60s. This area could support a continued
severe risk into this evening. As such, watch clearance has not been
recommended as redevelopment of new convection is possible.
Likewise, the cluster moving into southern IN also may approach this
area in the next 2-3 hours.

0552 AM CDT Tue Apr 29 2025

Areas affected...central into northeast Oklahoma...far southeast
Kansas

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 186...

Valid 291052Z - 291345Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 186
continues.

SUMMARY...Locally severe gusts remain possible from central into
northeast Oklahoma.

DISCUSSION...The leading edge of a small MCS which moved out of
northwest TX and pivoted into southwest OK continues to produce
measured severe gusts, most recently in Grady County as of 1030Z.
North of this area, storms have gradually increased along the cold
front extending from southeast KS into north-central OK. This line
of storms is also beginning to produce outflow as well.

An unstable air mass remains ahead of both convective systems, and
it appears these storms will merge from central into northeast OK.
Damaging gusts will remain the most likely threat, although hail of
1.00+" is likely in the stronger storm cores.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 186
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
235 AM CDT Tue Apr 29 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Far Northwest Arkansas
  South-Central/Southeast Kansas
  Far Southwest Missouri
  Northern Oklahoma
  Far Northeast Texas Panhandle

* Effective this Tuesday morning from 235 AM until 1000 AM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
    inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms are expected to develop across northwest OK
and the far northeast TX Panhandle in the vicinity of a cold front
progressing southward. This initial activity could pose a threat for
large hail. This development will likely grow upscale with an
attendant threat for damaging gusts as it moves eastward across
northern OK and south-central/southeast KS into far southwest MO and
far northwest AR. Some hail is possible within the stronger cells
across these areas as well.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 60
statute miles north and south of a line from 95 miles west southwest
of Alva OK to 20 miles east northeast of Joplin MO. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU6).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector

PUBLIC SEVERE WEATHER OUTLOOK  
NWS STORM PREDICTION CENTER NORMAN OK
0852 PM CDT MON APR 28 2025

...Severe thunderstorms expected over parts of the Upper Midwest
this evening and overnight...

* LOCATIONS...
  Wisconsin
  Northern Iowa
  Far Southeast Minnesota

* HAZARDS...
  Several tornadoes, a few intense
  Scattered large hail, some baseball size
  Scattered damaging winds

* SUMMARY...
  Multiple corridors of severe thunderstorms will continue this
  evening from the Upper Midwest into the central and southern
  Plains. Tornadoes, large hail, and severe gusts all remain
  possible, including some potential for strong tornadoes.

Preparedness actions...

Tornadoes at night can be particularly dangerous because they 
are usually fast-moving and difficult to see. Stay tuned to
NOAA Weather Radio, weather.gov, or other media for watches and
warnings. A tornado watch means that conditions are favorable
for tornadoes to form during the next several hours. If a tornado
warning is issued for your area, move to a place of safety,
ideally in a basement or interior room on the lowest floor of a
sturdy building.

Mesoscale Discussion 0588
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0333 PM CDT Mon Apr 28 2025

Areas affected...Edwards Plateau into western/central Oklahoma

Concerning...Severe potential...Tornado Watch likely 

Valid 282033Z - 282300Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...A tornado watch will likely be needed this afternoon as
storms are expected to develop along the dryline in the next 2-3
hours. All severe hazards will be possible. The tornado threat will
steadily increase from late afternoon into the evening.

DISCUSSION...Signs of mid-level ascent have been evident across the
southern Plains with visible satellite showing increasing amounts of
mid/high-level clouds moving in from the southwest. As a shortwave
perturbation lifts northeastward this afternoon/evening, this ascent
and additional surface heating should erode capping along/near the
dryline. A high-based storm has already formed northeast of Fort
Stockton in the last hour. Additional storms are expected to develop
later this afternoon, perhaps within the next 2-3 hours.

The environment will be quite favorable for supercells capable of
all severe hazards. Very steep mid-level lapse rates were observed
within the High Plains region on this mornings soundings. Large to
potentially giant hail will be possible along with severe winds.
Tornadoes will also be possible, particularly from southwest
Oklahoma into the Texas Rolling Plains where dewpoints have remained
in the upper 60s/low 70s F. The tornado threat will steadily
increase with time as 850 mb winds increase east of the dryline from
late afternoon into the evening. A strong tornado cannot be ruled
out within this more favorable mesoscale zone.

Mesoscale Discussion 0587
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0328 PM CDT Mon Apr 28 2025

Areas affected...far southeast NE...southwest into central
IA...northwest MO...northeast KS

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 282028Z - 282300Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Widely scattered thunderstorms will pose a risk for a few
tornadoes (a couple strong), large to very large hail (up to 3 inch
diameter), and isolated damaging gusts through evening. A tornado
watch will likely be needed for portions of the discussion area from
central Iowa into northeast Kansas.

DISCUSSION...Deepening cumulus is noted along a dryline from eastern
NE/northwest IA southward into northeast KS. An 18z RAOB from OAX
indicated an EML around 700 mb, but only weak capping remained.
Additional heating into the low/mid 80s F amid mid/upper 60s F
dewpoints beneath steep midlevel lapse rates around 7.5-8.5 C/km 
immediately downstream from the surface dryline is support strong
instability with MLCAPE greater than 2000 J/kg noted in latest SPC
Mesoanalysis and the 18z OAX RAOB. In addition to this this
favorable thermodynamic environment, vertical shear is very
favorable for supercell thunderstorms, as evident in enlarged,
looping low-level hodographs becoming somewhat elongated above 2-3
km. 

Large-scale ascent will remain somewhat weaker with southward extent
into the MO Valley vicinity, and storm coverage is a bit uncertain,
especially with southward extent. Timing of convective initiation is
also uncertain, but seems most likely in the 22-00z time frame.
Regardless, any storms developing in this environment will likely
have robust updrafts and become intense, posing a risk for very
large hail, a few tornadoes and damaging gusts. A tornado watch will
likely be needed for portions of the MCD area in the next 1-2 hours.

Mesoscale Discussion 0586
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0225 PM CDT Mon Apr 28 2025

Areas affected...central/southeast MN...western WI...northern IA

Concerning...Severe potential...Tornado Watch likely 

Valid 281925Z - 282130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Severe thunderstorm potential will increase through late
afternoon. All severe hazards, including tornadoes (some strong),
very large hail (to 3 inch diameter) and damaging gusts (to 70 mph)
are possible.

DISCUSSION...A line of convection along a surface front across
southwest MN into northwest IA will continue to shift east/northeast
this afternoon. Ahead of this convection, the downstream airmass
across central/southeast MN, northern IA and western WI continues to
moisten and destabilize. Surface dewpoints have increased into the
low to mid 60s as far north as the Minneapolis metro area, with
upper 50s to near 60 F to the north and east. Continued northward
moisture transport on a 50+ kt low level jet should continue to aid
in further destabilization over the next few hours as large-scale
ascent overspreads the region. 

Region VWP data from KMPX/KDMX/KARX already show impressive vertical
shear favorable for supercells. Enlarged, curved low-level
hodographs amid the strengthening low-level jet is aiding in 0-1 km
SRH greater than 250 m2/s2. As weak MLCIN continues to erode,
convection moving into this environment is likely to become better
organized, with an increase in storm coverage expected into northern
IA. Intense convection is expected to move across the MCD from late
this afternoon into this evening, posing an all-hazards severe risk.
A tornado watch will likely be needed in the next 1-2 hours.

Day 3 Convective Outlook CORR 1
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0317 AM CDT Mon Apr 28 2025

Valid 301200Z - 011200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS PORTIONS OF
NORTH-CENTRAL TEXAS INTO SOUTHERN OKLAHOMA...

CORRECTED FOR INCORRECT DAY REFERENCE

...SUMMARY...
Widely scattered thunderstorm activity is expected from the southern
Plains to the Great Lakes on Wednesday as a mid-level trough ejects
into the southern Plains. Severe thunderstorms will be possible
across east-central Texas into central/eastern Oklahoma.

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will eject across the southern Plains on Tuesday.
Surface low development is expected across western Texas on
D2-Tuesday, with a weak low tracking eastward into east-central
Texas by the D3-Wednesday period. Overnight thunderstorm activity is
expected at the beginning of the D3 period across portions of
central Oklahoma into east-central Texas. By the afternoon,
additional scattered thunderstorm development along the dryline near
the Red River on Wednesday afternoon will pose potential for severe
wind, hail, and a tornado.

...East-Central Texas into southern Oklahoma...
Scattered thunderstorm development along the dryline across central
Texas into Oklahoma on Wednesday afternoon will pose some severe
potential. Some uncertainty arises in coverage of morning convection
and cloud cover. However, it appears a corridor of favorable
instability and shear will overlap by the afternoon along and ahead
of the dryline. Shear profiles will be supportive of supercells
before clusters begin to form and attempts at upscale growth occur.
Large hail and damaging wind will be the primary risks given steep
lapse rates, though forecast soundings do show some curvature of low
level hodographs favorable for some tornado risk with early
supercell modes.

Mesoscale Discussion 0577
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0349 PM CDT Sun Apr 27 2025

Areas affected...parts of nw TX into the TX Pnhdl

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 272049Z - 272245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Probabilities for thunderstorm development appear low, but
may not be negligible late this afternoon into early evening, with
the environment conditionally supportive of supercells posing a risk
for large hail and tornadoes.  If and when it becomes more certain
that storms will form, a severe weather watch will probably be
needed.

DISCUSSION...Boundary-layer moisture characterized by lower/mid 60s
surface dew points is being maintained across the Lubbock through
Amarillo vicinities, beneath a deep warm elevated mixed-layer based
between 850-700 mb, just east of a dryline which may mix only slowly
northeastward/eastward into early evening.  This appears to be
contributing to strong potential instability (3000+ J/kg), beneath
moderate to strong southwesterly mid/upper flow (including 40-70+ kt
in the 500-300 mb layer), and an environment conditionally
supportive of intense supercells.

Perhaps due to the warm/dry air at mid-levels, and weak large-scale
forcing for ascent, convection allowing guidance, in particular,
continues to indicate generally low potential for thunderstorm
initiation through early evening.  However, at least attempts at
deepening convective development are evident to the west of the
dryline, and objective analysis indicates a possible secondary
maximum in dryline convergence developing near/north of Lubbock
toward areas west of Amarillo.   

Of particular concern, if a sustained storm does develop during the
next couple of hours, there appears potential for rapid
intensification while propagating across the dryline.  Toward
23-00Z, strengthening south-southeasterly low-level flow (in excess
of 30 kt around 850 mb) may contribute to enlarging clockwise curved
low-level hodographs increasingly supportive of potential for
tornadoes, in addition to large, potentially damaging hail.

Mesoscale Discussion 0576
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0347 PM CDT Sun Apr 27 2025

Areas affected...Western Kansas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 272047Z - 272245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Watch issuance in western Kansas is currently unlikely.
Significant severe would be possible if storms develop.
Observational trends will be monitored.

DISCUSSION...Periodic enhancement to the cumulus field in western
Kansas has been noted in day cloud phase satellite imagery,
primarily in the vicinity of Goodland. Low 60s F dewpoints ahead of
the surface trough/modest dryline has allowed around 2500 J/kg
MLCAPE to develop. With the generally weak dryline circulation and
uncertain/subtle mid-level ascent, the development of deep
convection is far from a given. Only the more aggressive of the CAM
models suggests development later this afternoon. However, despite
this uncertainty, the environment will be conditionally favorable
for significant severe if storms can form. Supercells would be
likely given 40-45 kts of effective shear perpendicular to the
dryline. Furthermore, a strong increase in 850 mb winds after 00Z
would support a tornado threat.

Watch issuance appears unlikely at this time, but observational
trends (including observed sounding data) will be monitored over the
next few hours.

Mesoscale Discussion 0575
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0329 PM CDT Sun Apr 27 2025

Areas affected...2Nebraska Panhandle into the Sandhills and
Southwest Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 272029Z - 272230Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated to widely scattered supercell potential should
increase over the next 2-3 hours. Large/very-large hail and severe
gusts will be possible. The tornado threat will initially be low,
but will increase for storms persisting near/after sunset. Trends
will be monitored for watch issuance.

DISCUSSION...As the lee trough continues to deepen this afternoon,
clusters of cumulus clouds have begun to develop in northeast
Colorado. With time and the approach of a shortwave trough, a
surface low will become more evident in eastern Colorado. Low 60s F
dewpoints have already reached parts of northwest Kansas and should
continue north and west as low-level winds respond to the surface
cyclone.

Effective shear of around 45 kts across the trough axis will promote
discrete storm development. Steep mid-level lapse rates and
initially long, straight hodographs will promote a risk for
large/very-large hail and severe winds. As the low-level jet
increases this evening, any mature supercells ongoing will have an
increased potential to produce a tornado. Storm coverage is somewhat
uncertain, but isolated to widely scattered supercells appear
possible given at least modest mid-level ascent expected over the
next few hours.

0255 PM CDT Sun Apr 27 2025

Areas affected...,parts of swrn TX

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 271955Z - 272100Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...The initiation of a couple of storms appears increasingly
likely near and northwest through north of Fort Stockton through 4-5
PM CDT.  More rapid thunderstorm intensification accompanied by
increasing potential for large hail and locally damaging wind gusts
may be initially slow, before probably increasing toward early
evening around the Midland through Big Spring vicinities.

DISCUSSION...The boundary-layer is becoming strongly heated and
deeply mixed across the Davis Mountains vicinity of southwest Texas
into the Texas South Plains.  The dryline is sharpening east through
north of Fort Stockton, where 2-hourly surface pressure falls around
2.0+ mb have been observed the past couple of hours, and low-level
convergence appears strongest.

Deepening convective development is ongoing within the deeper
mixed-boundary layer around Fort Stockton, where surface
temperature/dew point spreads are around 50 F (95/44), but forecast
soundings and HREF guidance suggests that the initiation of at least
isolated thunderstorm development is increasingly probable through
21-22Z.  It appears that this may be aided by forcing associated
with a mid-level speed maximum within southwesterly flow emanating
from the northern Mexican Plateau.

Downstream of slow moving large-scale mid-level troughing over the
southern Great Basin and Southwest, after at least some further
eastward mixing of the dryline late this afternoon, it probably will
begin to retreat northwest across the Pecos Valley vicinity toward
23-00Z.  As this occurs, convection may acquire more substantively
unstable updraft inflow (including most unstable CAPE up to
2000-3000+ J/kg), supporting increasing potential for rapid
thunderstorm intensification, in the presence of strong deep-layer
shear.  This may including a splitting supercell or two, posing a
risk for large hail and a few strong surface gusts.

Until then, though, initial thunderstorm development will probably
be more modest in strength, but could still pose some risk for
producing severe hail and wind.
