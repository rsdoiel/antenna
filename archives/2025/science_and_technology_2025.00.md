## Running NetBSD on an IBM ThinkPad 380Z

date: 2025-01-02, from: OS News

Launched in 1998, the 380Z was one very fine ThinkPad. It was the last ThinkPad to come in the classic bulky and rectangular form factor. It was also one of the first to feature a huge 13.3&#8243; TFT display, powerful 233MHz Pentium II, and whopping 160 megs of RAM. I recently stumbled upon one in perfect condition on eBay, and immediately thought it&#8217;d be a cool vintage gadget to put on the desk. I only wondered if I could still use it for some slow-paced, distraction-free coding, using reasonably modern software. ↫ Luke&#8217;s web space You know where this is going, right? I evaluated a bunch of contemporary operating systems, including different variants of BSD and Linux. Usually, the experience was underwhelming in terms of performance, hardware support and stability. Well&#8230; except for NetBSD, which gave me such perfectly smooth ride, that I thought it was worth sharing. ↫ Luke&#8217;s web space Yeah, of course it was going to be NetBSD (again). This old laptop, too, can run X11 just fine, with the EMWM that we discussed quite recently &#8211; in fact, bringing up X required no configuration, and a simple startx was all it needed out of the box. For web browsing, Dillo works just great, and building it took only about 20 minutes. It can even play some low-fi music streams from the internet, only stuttering when doing other processor-intensive tasks. In other words, this little machine with NetBSD turns out to be a great machine for some distraction-free programming. Look, nobody is arguing that a machine like this is all you need. However, it can perform certain specific, basic tasks &#8211; anything being better than sending it to a toxic landfill, with all the transportation waste and child labour that entails. If you have old laptops lying around, you should think twice about just sending them to &#8220;recycling&#8221; (which is Western world speak for &#8220;send to toxic landfill manned by children in poor countries&#8221;), since it might be quite easy to turn it into something useful, still.

## NASA Anticipates Lunar Findings From Next-Generation Retroreflector

date: 2025-01-02, from: NASA breaking news

Apollo astronauts set up mirror arrays, or “retroreflectors,” on the Moon to accurately reflect laser light beamed at them from Earth with minimal scattering or diffusion. Retroreflectors are mirrors that reflect the incoming light back in the same incoming direction. Calculating the time required for the beams to bounce back allowed scientists to precisely measure [&#8230;]

## The Windows CE Developer’s Kit from 1999

date: 2024-12-31, from: OS News

Rare, hard to come by, but now available on the Internet Archive: the complete book set for the Windows CE Developer&#8217;s Kit from 1999. It contains all the separate books in their full glory, so if you ever wanted to write either a Windows CE application or driver for Windows CE 2.0, here&#8217;s all the information you&#8217;ll ever need. The Microsoft Windows CE Developer’s Kit provides all the information you need to write applications for devices based on the Microsofte Windowso CE operating system. ↫ Windows CE Developer&#8217;s Kit The Microsoft Windows CE Programmer’s Guide details the architecture of the operating system, how to write applications, how to implement synchronisation with a PC, and much more that pertains to developing applications. The Microsoft Windows CE User Interface Services Guide can be seen as an important addition to the Programmer&#8217;s Guide, as it details everything related to creating a GUI and how to handle various input methods. Going a few steps deeper, and we arrive at the Microsoft Windows CE Communications Guide, which, as the name implies, tells you all you need to know about infrared connections, telephony, networking and internet connections, and related matter. Finally, we arrive at the Microsoft Windows CE Device Driver Kit, which, as the name implies, is for those of us interested in writing device drivers for Windows CE, something that will surely be of great importance in the future, since Windows CE is sure to dominate our mobile life. To get started, you do need to have Microsoft Visual C++ version 6.0 and the Microsoft Windows CE Toolkit for Visual C++ version 6.0 up and running, since all code samples in the Programmer&#8217;s Guide are developed with it, but I&#8217;m sure you already have this taken care of &#8211; why would you be developing for any other platforms, am I right?

## LineageOS 22.1, based on Android 15 QPR1, released

date: 2024-12-31, from: OS News

LineageOS, the Debian of the custom Android ROM world, released version 22 &#8211; or, 22.1 to be more exact &#8211; today. On the verge of the new year, they managed to complete the rebase to Android 15, released in September, making this one of their fastest rebases ever. We’ve been hard at work since Android 15’s release in September, adapting our unique features to this new version of Android. Android 15 introduced several complex changes under the hood, but due to our previous efforts adapting to Google’s UI-centric adjustments in Android 12 through 14, we were able to rebase onto Android 15’s code-base faster than anticipated. Additionally, this is far-and-away the easiest bringup cycle from a device perspective we have seen in years. This means that many more devices are ready on day one that we’d typically expect to have up this early in the cycle! ↫ Nolen Johnson LineageOS is also changing its versioning scheme to better match that of Google&#8217;s new quarterly Android releases, and that&#8217;s why this new release is 22.1: it&#8217;s based on Android 15 QPR1. In other words, the 22 aligns with the major Android version number, and the .1 with the QPR it&#8217;s based on. LineageOS 22.1 brings all the same new features as Android 15 and QPR1, as well as two brand new applications: Twelve, a replacement for LineageOS&#8217; aging music player application, and Camelot, a new PDF reader. The list of supported devices is pretty good for a new LineageOS release, and adds the Pixel 9 series of devices right off the bat. LineageOS 22.1 ships with the November Android security patches, and also comes with a few low-level changes, like completely new extract utilities written in Python, which massively improve extracting performance, virtIO support, and much more.

## Chimera Linux enters beta

date: 2024-12-30, from: OS News

We&#8217;ve talked about Chimera Linux before &#8211; it&#8217;s a unique Linux distribution that combines a BSD userland with the LLVM/Clang toolchain, and musl. Its init system is dinit, and it uses apk-tools from Alpine as its package manager. None of this has anything to do with being anti-anything; the choice of BSD&#8217;s tools and userland is mostly technical in nature. Chimera Linux is available for x86-64, AArch64, RISC-V, and POWER (both little and big endian). I am unreasonably excited for Chimera Linux, for a variety of reasons &#8211; first, I love the above set of choices they made, and second, Chimera Linux&#8217; founder and lead developer, q66, is a well-known and respected name in this space. She not only founded Chimera Linux, but also used to maintain the POWER/PowerPC ports of Void Linux, which is the port of Void Linux I used on my POWER9 hardware. She apparently also contributed quite a bit to Enlightenment, and is currently employed by Igalia, through which she can work on Chimera. With the description out of the way, here&#8217;s the news: Chimera Linux has officially entered beta. Today we have updated apk-tools to an rc tag. With this, the project is now entering beta phase, after around a year and a half. In general, this does not actually mean much, as the project is rolling release and updates will simply keep coming. It is more of an acknowledgement of current status, though new images will be released in the coming days. ↫ Chimera Linux&#8217;s website Despite my excitement, I haven&#8217;t yet tried Chimera Linux myself, as I figured its pre-beta stage wasn&#8217;t meant for an idiot like me who can&#8217;t contribute anything meaningful, and I&#8217;d rather not clutter the airwaves. Now that it&#8217;s entered beta, I feel like the time is getting riper and riper for me to dive in, and perhaps write about it here. Since the goal of Chimera Linux is to be a general-purpose distribution, I think I&#8217;m right in the proper demographic of users. It helps that I&#8217;m about to set up my dual-processor POWER9 machine again, and I think I&#8217;ll be going with Chimera Linux. As a final note, you may have noticed I consistently refer to it as &#8220;Chimera Linux&#8221;. This is very much on purpose, as there&#8217;s also something called ChimeraOS, a more standard Linux distribution aimed at gaming. To avoid confusion, I figured I&#8217;d keep the naming clear and consistent.

## Running NetBSD 10.1 on a 1998 Toshiba laptop

date: 2024-12-30, from: OS News

Here are my notes on running NetBSD 10.1 on my first personal laptop that I still keep, a 1998 i586 Toshiba Satellite Pro with 81Mb of RAM and a 1Gb IBM 2.5&#8243; IDE HD. In summary, the latest NetBSD runs well on this old hardware using an IDE to CF adapter and several changes to the i386 GENERIC kernel. ↫ Joel P. I don&#8217;t think the BSD world &#8211; and NetBSD in particular &#8211; gets enough recognition for supporting both weird architectures and old hardware as well as it does. This here is a 26 year old laptop running the latest version of NetBSD, working X11 server and all, while other operating systems drop support for devices only a few years old. So many devices could be saved from toxic landfills if only more people looked beyond Windows and macOS.
