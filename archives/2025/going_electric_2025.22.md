## No, Honda didn’t just launch its first electric motorcycle (and you can’t buy it)

date: 2025-06-02, from: Electrek Feed

<div class="feat-image"><img src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/06/E-VO-motorcycle-head.jpg?quality=82&#038;strip=all&#038;w=1600" /></div><p>The electric motorcycle market is a small and highly interconnected one, with a limited amount of suppliers and an even smaller number of actual honest-to-goodness motorcycle manufacturers. While Covid-era progress led to a series of highly-funded <a href="https://electrek.co/2022/07/20/ryvid-anthem-electric-motorcycle-unveil/">rapid advancements</a> and <a href="https://electrek.co/2020/11/18/damon-unveils-two-new-electric-motorcycles-based-on-novel-hyperdrive-platform/">flashy announcements</a>, the last few years have been hard on the industry as funding and excitement have both dwindled, resulting in a smaller number of big releases. So it makes sense that people would jump at news that Honda is now producing its first electric motorcycle and that you can already buy it. The only problem is that none of that is true – finally some <em>real</em> fake news. </p>
