## MeetOne Tour full-suspension electric trike review: The most powerful and most comfortable e-trike yet

I may not be a silver-haired fox (yet), but even at a ripe 36 years old, I can appreciate the advantages of a comfortable e-trike just as much as their larger market of mature riders. </p>



<p>I don’t think age or accessibility should be the only factors when considering the advantages of three wheels over two, and the MeetOne Tour dual motor electric trike is a great example of that. Sure, it’d be awesome for folks who can no longer feel the same confidence or stability from two-wheelers. But it’s also just a blast to ride at any age and ability level!</p>

## No, Honda didn’t just launch its first electric motorcycle (and you can’t buy it)

<div class="feat-image"><img src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/06/E-VO-motorcycle-head.jpg?quality=82&#038;strip=all&#038;w=1600" /></div><p>The electric motorcycle market is a small and highly interconnected one, with a limited amount of suppliers and an even smaller number of actual honest-to-goodness motorcycle manufacturers. While Covid-era progress led to a series of highly-funded <a href="https://electrek.co/2022/07/20/ryvid-anthem-electric-motorcycle-unveil/">rapid advancements</a> and <a href="https://electrek.co/2020/11/18/damon-unveils-two-new-electric-motorcycles-based-on-novel-hyperdrive-platform/">flashy announcements</a>, the last few years have been hard on the industry as funding and excitement have both dwindled, resulting in a smaller number of big releases. So it makes sense that people would jump at news that Honda is now producing its first electric motorcycle and that you can already buy it. The only problem is that none of that is true – finally some <em>real</em> fake news. </p>
