There are original stories, there are unique sto­ries, and then there are
Marie-Helene Bertino stories. Take something painfully ordinary – a
painting left behind, helium balloons, a sitcom – and somehow turn it
into a gem. If you can do that, you’ll end up with something akin to a
Bertino story, and <strong>Exit </strong>

What makes a successful writer tick? How do they handle bad news? How
have others changed their lives and how do they pay it
forward? <br><br>If you want to learn from the best, you’ve come to the
right place. Read on below for a deep dive into the mind of Jonathan
Groff, writer and showrunner for such series as <em>Black-ish, Happy
Endings, Scrubs</em> and <em>How I Met Your Mother</em>. <br><br><span
style="font-weight: bold;">FD: Do you have any projects in development
right now? </span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Jonathan
Groff:</span> I do. I’m still at 20th. I was at ABC Signature for many
years and then they got folded into 20th last fall and they extended my
deal. I’ve done a lot of work for them over the years. Sometimes I’m in
a sort of supervisory role all the way from the very beginning of an
idea through the development of it. Sometimes I come in a little bit
later. And then I have my own projects, too. <br><br><span
style="font-weight: bold;">FD: Do you have a life or career motto of any
kind? </span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Jonathan
Groff:</span> I think a good career motto is the idea that success is
working on stuff you like with people you like. And then other success
generally will follow. I’ve been very, very blessed. I haven’t had toxic
work environments. When I first started out, I had a couple experiences
early on that were less positive, so I learned early that when I’m in
charge, I’m going to try to make it pretty positive for people. So
that’s one motto.<br><br>My brother also said one that I like a lot.
He’s a wonderful writer, and he may have borrowed this, but it’s: just
do the next right thing. <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">FD:
“Do the next right thing” is a great one. There’s a productivity hack
called The Hunter Method that leans into that idea of only focusing on
‘the one’ task before you. Nothing else exists until you complete that
one thing. Supposed to help a lot with
procrastination.</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Speaking
of procrastination — what’s your go-to when you find yourself
procrastinating or side-tracked?</span><br><br><span
style="font-weight: bold;">Jonathan Groff:</span> I try to turn my
procrastination into something positive, so then I see it as not really
being procrastination in that way. Like I try to go and do something,
exercise, take a hike, and that actually, if I let it, can also be this
great way to clear your brain and get past writer’s block or to think
about something differently, because I’m literally getting the blood
flowing. It’s nothing new, but, you know, I think it was Madonna who
said, “If all you do is exercise in a day, at least you’ve exercised.”
So you’ve got to give yourself credit for the things you do get
done. <br><br>Also, though, like all writers, I do have a
<em>little</em> bit of the chores/cleaning disease, but just a bit. My
wife will tell you that I don’t have it as acutely as she would like.

What Is a Final Girl?
</h2>
<p>
A <span style="font-weight: bold;">Final Girl</span> is
<a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/using-film-tropes-in-screenwriting">a
trope</a> and
<a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/mean-screenplay-arch">character
archetype</a> associated with the horror
<a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/what-genre-is-my-screenplay">genre</a>
and sometimes more specifically the slasher subgenre (although Final
Girls aren’t limited to slasher films). <br><br>One crucial element to a
Final Girl is they’re the protagonist and survivor of a film with a body
count (hence, why they often appear in slasher films). A cast of
characters are slowly killed off by the film’s antagonist and, in most
cases, the Final Girl has to face the antagonist head on, after trying
to evade them throughout the film and always narrowly escaping.
Typically, the Final Girl bests or kills the antagonist and lives to see
another day (and sometimes a sequel if not <span
style="font-style: italic;">several</span> sequels). <br><br>This
trope/archetype was especially popular in 1980s horror films, but you’ll
still find Final Girls in many movies today. Because of this,
screenwriters are always looking to put a new spin on the Final Girl and
this presents a challenge: how do you create one that’s fresh and
different from their predecessors? And how do you make the reader
connect with and care about them? <br><br>But before we give tips on how
to write a Final Girl, let’s take a look at some past examples.

It’s both exciting and terrifying to start a new screenplay — whether
it’s your first, second, third, or beyond. <br><br>The excitement takes
hold because you’ve had this idea playing in your head for a while and
you’re finally committed to getting that idea — and its story and
character elements — onto the page. It’s always exciting to see your
concepts come to life. <br><br>The terror can reside in the fact that
you now have to bring those visuals and thoughts into the realm of
screenwriting structure by way of laying it out in script format, story
structure, scene description, dialogue, and
characterization. <br><br>That’s the thrill though. That’s why
screenwriters do this. You want to see your ideas and concepts grow into
compelling and engaging cinematic tales that entice Hollywood to buy
them and bring them to life on the screen for audiences to
experience. <br><br>But for all of that to happen, your scripts have to
not just be good — they need to be amazing. You always want to showcase
your best work to the powers that be. <br><br>With that in mind, here
we’ll share five screenwriting prep exercises you should do <span
style="font-weight: bold;">before you write a single word</span>.
Front-end screenwriting tasks are key to the success of any screenplay.
If you do the front-end work before you jump into the writing process,
your script will be far, far more successful than just jumping into the
writing and “vomiting” out a quick first draft.

If there’s one thing I can’t abide, it’s nontechnical technothrillers.
You know the trope: “We’ve got eight minutes to crack this mainframe,
but it’s protected with encryption that is rated for ten minutes. We’re
gonna have to hack really hard. Come on, hacker, HACK AWAY!”
</p>
<p>
Technothrillers are consumed by an increasingly computer-savvy audience,
which means that the kind of technical elision and corner-cutting that
dominates the field grows thinner by
