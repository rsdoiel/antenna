Traditionally, the big risk in HODL-ing cryptocurrencies has been their
volatility. Fortunately, now the US goverenment is all-in on
cryptocurrencies, this risk is greatly reduced. Progress moon-wards is
virtually guaranteed, so it is reasonable to invest a small part of your
portfolio into Lamborghinis. HODL-ers can rest easy while the rest of
the coins in their wallets appreciate because they are protected by
strong cryptography (at least until the advent of a
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2021/11/the-65b-prize.html">sufficiently
powerful quantum computer</a>). But progress moon-wards exacerbates some
other risks to HODL-ers, as I explain below the fold.<br />
<span><a name='more'></a></span> <br /> There is no need to wait while
the semiconductor industry develops
<a href="https://thequantuminsider.com/2024/12/06/china-introduces-504-qubit-superconducting-chip/">quantum
computers</a> in order to defeat the cryptography protecting the
HODL-ers wallets. Several effective techniques are already available.
North Korea’s recent record-breaking $1.5B heist illustrates that
deploying malware via a
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2025/03/software-supply-chain-attack.html"><i>Software
Supply Chain Attack</i></a> is capable of compromising even
industrial-strength multi-signature wallets.<br /> <br /> The North
Korean’s haul was big, but slightly smaller heists are routine. For
example, Molly White reports that on 27<sup>th</sup> April 2025
<a href="https://www.web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=bc1qcry-theft"><i>$330
million in Bitcoin apparently stolen; laundering spikes Monero price by
over 40%</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
3,250 BTC (~$330 million) were apparently stolen from a bitcoin holder
and then quickly moved through multiple exchanges and swapped for the
Monero privacycoin. Such a massive swap into Monero was apparently
enough to cause the Monero price to spike from around $230 to as high as
around $330, before retracting somewhat.
</blockquote>
Another remarkably effective technique is social engineering. A group of
scammers used it last August 18<sup>th</sup>, posing as members of
Google’s and Gemini’s security teams to social-engineer “an early
investor in cryptocurrency” into downloading malware. He lost more than
4,100BTC, then “worth” about $230M. Mitch Moxley has a fascinating,
detailed account of what happened over the next month in
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/magazine/crybercrime-crypto-minecraft.html"><i>They
Stole a Quarter-Billion in Crypto and Got Caught Within a Month</i></a>.
The scammers immediately started laundering the loot through a series of
mixers and sketchy exchanges. These transactions attracted attention
from a
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/magazine/crybercrime-crypto-minecraft.html">famed
cryptocurrency sleuth</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Minutes after the D.C. resident’s funds were liquidated, ZachXBT was
walking through the airport on his way to catch a flight when he
received an alert on his phone about an unusual transaction. Crypto
investigators use tools to monitor the global flows of various coins and
set alerts for, say, any transaction over $100,000 that goes through
certain exchanges that charge a premium for having few security
safeguards. The initial alert that day was for a mid-six-figure
transaction, followed by higher amounts, all the way up to $2 million.
After he cleared airport security, ZachXBT sat down, opened his laptop
and began tracing transactions back to a Bitcoin wallet with roughly
$240 million in crypto. Some of the Bitcoin in the wallet dated back to
2012. “At that point it didn’t make sense,” he told me. “Why is a person
who held their Bitcoin for this long using a sketchy service that
typically sees a lot of illicit funds flow through it?”<br /> <br /> He
added the wallets associated with the transactions to his tracking and
boarded the plane. Once he connected to in-flight internet, more alerts
arrived. Throughout the day, the Bitcoin traced to the wallet was being
liquidated through more than 15 different high-fee cryptocurrency
services.
</blockquote>
It turned out that one of the group of scammers couldn’t resist
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/magazine/crybercrime-crypto-minecraft.html">showing
off</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The source sent ZachXBT several screen-share recordings, which he said
were taken when one of the scammers livestreamed the heist for a group
of his friends. The videos, which totaled an hour and a half, included
the call with the victim. One clip featured the scammers’ live reaction
when they realized they’d successfully stolen $243 million worth of the
D.C. resident’s Bitcoin. A voice can be heard yelling: “Oh, my god! Oh,
my god! $243 million! Yes! Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Bro!”<br /> <br /> In
private chats they used screen names like Swag, $$$ and Meech, but they
made a crucial mistake. One of them flashed his Windows home screen,
which revealed his real name in the start icon pop-up at the bottom of
the screen: Veer Chetal, an 18-year-old from Danbury
</blockquote>
Chetal lived in Danbury, CT. His father Sushil Chetal was a
vice-president at Morgan Stanley. He was an incoming freshman at
Rutgers. In his senior year he had developed a
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/magazine/crybercrime-crypto-minecraft.html">lavish
lifestyle</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Classmates remember Chetal as shy and a fan of cars. “He just kind of
kept to himself,” says Marco Dias, who became friends with Chetal junior
year. According to another classmate named Nick Paris, this was true of
Chetal until one day in the middle of his senior year, when he showed up
at school driving a Corvette. “He just parked in the lot. It was 7:30
a.m., and everyone was like, What?” Paris says. Soon Chetal rolled up in
a BMW, and then a Lamborghini Urus. He started wearing Louis Vuitton
shirts and Gucci shoes, and on Senior Skip Day, while Paris and many of
his classmates went to a nearby mall, Chetal took some friends,
including Dias, to New York to party on a yacht he had rented, where
they took photos holding wads of cash.
</blockquote>
On 25<sup>th</sup> August, a week after the $230M heist, Chetal’s
parents were house-hunting in Danbury in the Lamborghini Urus he had
driven to school
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/magazine/crybercrime-crypto-minecraft.html">when</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
the Lamborghini was suddenly rammed from behind by a white Honda Civic.
At the same time, a white Ram ProMaster work van cut in front, trapping
the Chetals. According to a criminal complaint filed after the incident,
a group of six men dressed in black and wearing masks emerged from their
vehicles and forced the Chetals from their car, dragging them toward the
van’s open side door.<br /> <br /> When Sushil resisted, the assailants
hit him with a baseball bat and threatened to kill him. The men bound
the couple’s arms and legs with duct tape. They forced Radhika to lie
face down and told her not to look at them, even as she struggled to
breathe, pleading that she had asthma. They wrapped Sushil’s face with
duct tape and hit him several more times with the bat as the van peeled
off.

Years ago, Randall Munroe explained a much simpler but only slightly
less effective technique for defeating strong cryptography in
<a href="https://xkcd.com/538/">XKCD #538</a>. In 2021’s
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2021/12/talk-at-ttivanguard-conference.html"><i>Can
We Mitigate Cryptocurrencies’ Externalities?</i></a> I referred to
Jamison Lopp’s list of people applying XKCD’s technique entitled
<a href="https://github.com/jlopp/physical-bitcoin-attacks/blob/master/README.md"><i>Known
Physical Bitcoin Attacks</i></a>, which started in 2014 and is still
going strong. Already this year Lopp documents 21 attacks, or more than
one a week. Among last year’s entries we find the kidnapping of Veer
Chetal’s parents.<br /> <br />
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/magazine/crybercrime-crypto-minecraft.html">Fortunately</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Several witnesses saw the attack and called 911. Some of them, including
an off-duty F.B.I. agent who lived nearby and happened to be at the
scene, trailed the van and the Honda, relaying the vehicles’ movements
to the police. The F.B.I. agent managed to obtain partial license plate
numbers.<br /> <br /> Danbury police officers soon located the van. A
patrol vehicle activated its emergency lights and tried to make a stop,
but the driver of the van accelerated, swerving recklessly through
traffic.<br /> <br /> About a mile from where the chase began, the
driver careered off the road and struck a curb. Four suspects fled on
foot. The police found one hiding under a bridge and apprehended him
after a brief chase. Within a couple of hours, the other three were
located hiding in a wooded area nearby. The police, meanwhile, found the
shaken Chetals bound in the back of the van.
</blockquote>
In this case the “<a href="https://xkcd.com/538/">$5 wrench</a>”
technique was applied indirectly. It appears that Chetal and his
accomplices were part of the Com, a group that
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/magazine/crybercrime-crypto-minecraft.html">started
scamming on Minecraft servers</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
In an affidavit from an unrelated case, an F.B.I. agent described the
Com as “a geographically diverse group of individuals, organized in
various subgroups, all of whom coordinate through online communication
applications such as Discord and Telegram to engage in various types of
criminal activity.”<br /> …<br /> When the price of Bitcoin began to
rise rapidly in 2017, Com members made an easy shift from Minecraft
fraud to crypto theft.
</blockquote>
The kidnappers
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/magazine/crybercrime-crypto-minecraft.html">clearly</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
targeted the Chetals to hold them ransom for the money their son had.
Independent investigators think that at least one member of the group,
Reynaldo (Rey) Diaz, who they say went by the alias Pantic, was a member
of the Com; ZachXBT speculates that the thieves might have made
themselves targets by sharing stories of their spending with other Com
members.

Chetal’s accomplices are alleged to include “Malone Lam, a known figure
in the Com” and Jeandiel Serrano. They also couldn’t resist enjoying
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/magazine/crybercrime-crypto-minecraft.html">the
fruits of their labors</a>:
<blockquote>
On Sept. 10, after a 23-day party spree in Los Angeles, Lam headed to
Miami on a private jet with a group of friends. There, he rented
multiple homes, including a 10-bedroom, $7.5 million estate. Within a
few days, Lam had filled the driveway with more luxury cars, including
multiple Lamborghinis, one with the name “Malone” printed on the side.
</blockquote>
ZachXBT and others were easily able to track Lam’s activities on
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/magazine/crybercrime-crypto-minecraft.html">social
media</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Malone was filmed wearing a white Moncler jacket and what appeared to be
diamond rings and diamond-encrusted sunglasses. He stood up on the table
and began showering the crowd with hundred-dollar bills. As money rained
down, servers paraded in $1,500 bottles of Champagne topped with
sparklers and held up signs that read “<span class="citation"
data-cites="Malone">@Malone</span>.” He spent $569,528 in one evening
alone.
</blockquote>
According to the authorities
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/magazine/crybercrime-crypto-minecraft.html">Serrano
made a mistake</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
neglecting to use a VPN when he created an account with TradeOgre, a
digital currency exchange, which connected to an I.P. address that was
registered to a $47,500-per-month rental home in Encino, Calif. It was
leased to Jeandiel Serrano, … By the time the authorities identified
Serrano, he was on vacation in the Maldives with his girlfriend.<br />
<br /> On Sept. 18, Serrano flew back from the Maldives to Los Angeles
International Airport, where the authorities were waiting for him. He
was wearing a $500,000 watch at the time of his arrest. … Serrano
admitted that he owned five cars, two of which were gifts from one of
his co-conspirators, given to him with proceeds from a previous fraud.
He also confessed to having access to approximately $20 million of the
victim’s crypto on his phone and agreed to transfer the funds back to
the F.B.I.

Later that day, a team of F.B.I. agents working with the Miami police

In an instance of synchronicity, while I was writing this Nate Anderson
was writing
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/we-have-reached-the-severed-fingers-and-abductions-stage-of-the-crypto-revolution/"><i>We
have reached the “severed fingers and abductions” stage of the crypto
revolution</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
French gendarmes have been busy policing crypto crimes, but these aren’t
the usual financial schemes, cons, and HODL! shenanigans one usually
reads about. No, these crimes involve abductions, (multiple) severed
fingers, and (multiple) people rescued from the trunks of cars—once
after being doused with gasoline.<br /> <br /> This previous weekend was
particularly nuts, with an older gentleman snatched from the streets of
Paris’ 14th arrondissement on May 1 by men in ski masks. … The abducted
man was apparently the father of someone who had made a packet in
crypto. The kidnappers demanded a multimillion-euro ransom from the
man’s son.<br /> <br /> According to Le Monde, the abducted father was
taken to a house in a Parisian suburb, where one of the father’s fingers
was cut off in the course of ransom negotiations. Police feared “other
mutilations” if they were unable to find the man, but they did locate
and raid the house this weekend, arresting five people in their 20s.

Anderson fails to credit Lopp, who has been tracking the problem for
more than a decade. He does note the
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/we-have-reached-the-severed-fingers-and-abductions-stage-of-the-crypto-revolution/">root
of the problem</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Or there’s the Belgian man who posted online that “his crypto wallet was
now worth €1.6 million.” His wife was the
<a href="https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/en/2024/12/24/failed-kidnap-attempt-victim-was-bitcoin-millionaires-wife/">victim
of an attempted abduction</a> within weeks.
</blockquote>
<p>HODL-ers need to understand that the speed, immutability and (pseudo)
anonymity of cryptocurrency transactions eliminates many of the
difficulties in applying the “<a href="https://xkcd.com/538/">$5
wrench</a>” technique. Once it is known that you (or your son) hold the
key to a cryptocurrency wallet with even a few tens of Bitcoin, you (or
your son) become a target for theft. You (or your son) should hope that
the threat comes from social engineers like Veer Chetal and his
accomplices, in which case your loss will be expensive but painless.
But, as Jamison Lopp records, it may well come from people like Rey
Diaz.<br /> <br /> The solution is
“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity">security
through obscurity</a>”. If you (or your son) rarely transact and
maintain a modest lifestyle, lacking Lamborghinis and
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/magazine/crybercrime-crypto-minecraft.html">$569,528</a>
bar bills, it isn’t likely that your wallet address will be deemed worth
deanonymizing. But what is the point of HODL-ing for HODL-ings sake
alone? The temptation to “buy the Lambo” is really hard to resist, and
the risk seems remote.<br /> <br /></p>

<p>
In my own house rules, there have been
<a href="2016-01-29_No_Clerics">no clerics</a> since 2016. Back in 2019
I reported that I had <a href="2019-02-08_Still_No_Clerics">still no
clerics</a>. And I still don’t. I also never went back to using
“paladin” abilities as mentioned in that “no clerics” post and I never
went back to using
<a href="2015-10-31_Reputation%2C_again">reputation</a> for “divine
favour”.
</p>
<p>
As
<a class="account" href="https://tabletop.social/@phf" title="@phf@tabletop.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="phf">@phf</span></a> of
<a href="http://www.nilisnotnull.com/">((nil) is (not(null)))</a> also
uses these house rules to run Barrowmaze and I’m an occasional player, I
get to use the rules from the player side, too. And it works! It works
even if the whole dungeon is filled with undead. It’s just harder.
</p>
<p>
I encourage you to give it a try. An adventure that requires a specific
class to be in the party is a dull adventure. Therefore, all adventures
can be played without clerics. It might be a bit harder, or it may feel
different, but it can be done.
</p>
<p>
And I’m by no means a fanatic. I’ve played clerics. In my
<a href="https://ardenvul.com/">Arden Vul</a> game, we use AD&amp;D 1st
edition rules. And there are clerics, of course. It’s OK. I don’t mind.
The undead turning doesn’t really make much of a difference. And the
highest level cleric just recently started multi-classing as a
magic-user.
</p>
<p>
In a way that seems to validate my idea: There are no clerics. Cleric
spells are regular spells and magic-users can learn them, if they want.
If you want to cast spells and wear armour and wield weapons, play an
elf.
</p>
<p>
That brings me to another idea: I am thinking that we maybe don’t need
all these classes. We just need fighters and wizards and a multi-class
options. If experience always double for the next level, then a
fighter-wizard – what used to be an elf – is a level below their peers.
Which is exactly the effect of double experience point requirements for
elves in B/X or how OD&amp;D elves work where you need to pick fighting
elf or spell-casting elf at the beginning of the adventure. That leaves
the question of whether comparison: One extra level of wizard is
powerful, for sure. Is an extra level of fighter powerful? Probably not
so much. A fighter with no wizard levels is simply easier to play. But
that’s a thought for another day – and no excuse to bring clerics back.

<h1 id="2025-05-08-not-doing-the-thing">
2025-05-08 Not doing the thing
</h1>
<p>
I was reading stuff on fedi, as one does, wrote a reply, deleted it,
moved on, read some more, wrote a reply, deleted it. In both cases I
wanted say that the thing people were talking about seemed to me to be
that pattern in capitalism where “not doing a thing” gives you less
power over time, so people always end up doing something.
</p>
<p>
Like “buy this to save money” instead of “don’t buy this to save money”
or “buy this keyboard to fight the pain in your wrists” instead of “work
less to fight the pain in your wrists”.
</p>
<p>
If you advocate for not doing a thing, there’s no money changing hands
and therefore no ads to buy, no voice to gain, no political decisions
going your way. Which is a slightly different explanation than greed and
greenwashing for the failure of degrowth to take hold: If you sell
flights and buy carbon offsets you’ll always be growing unlike the
competition that sells less flights to lower emissions. Even if the
employees of the second company are feeling no need to grow, in the
general population, their message will tend to get lost, their
percentage of the market, even if enough for them, will continue to
shrink, and eventually people will not have heard about them.
</p>
<p>
I don’t know how to change that except by laws against doing all the
things I think we need to stop doing. Because the entire market, the
public speech, the commercial activity, it is all dominated by people
who do the thing. Sure, it’s greed, in a way, but it’s also a ratchet,
unstoppable, step by step, a selection process that is ongoing.
</p>
<p>
Do right and stop doing the thing and you leave that public sphere. Like
Voltaire says, tend to your own garden. You’ll be happy but the
political storms raging around you will seem more and more alien.
Because the people that didn’t drop out will no longer hear you or see
you. The next generation will not learn from you.
</p>
<p>
So one needs to stay in politics? Fight for the thing even though all
the money goes to towards doing the things that we shouldn’t be doing?
</p>
<p>
I don’t know what to do.
</p>
<p>
The entire thing reminds me of
<a href="2022-02-14_How_to_Do_Nothing">How to Do Nothing</a>.

<a class="account" href="https://toot.cat/@dredmorbius" title="@dredmorbius@toot.cat"><span
class="citation" data-cites="dredmorbius">@dredmorbius</span></a>

reversal of “Don’t just stand there, do something!”
(<a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2014/03/22/stand-there/">Quote

<p>
<a class="account" href="https://c.im/@smlckz" title="@smlckz@c.im"><span
class="citation" data-cites="smlckz">@smlckz</span></a> reminded me of
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tang_ping">tang ping</a>,
Chinese for “lying flat” (instead of working hard). In a world of
efficiency and productivity, lying flat is resistance. Or is checking
out a way to avoid responsibility? Or the admission of powerlessness? I
feel it all.
</p>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://photog.social/@ewen" title="@ewen@photog.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="ewen">@ewen</span></a> noted a similar
problem in medicine where “the three biggest factors in long term health
are getting more sleep, drinking more water and getting a little
exercise.” Which can’t be monetised, of course. So somebody else must be
talking about this. This reminds me of the reversal at the Chinese
imperial court I heard of at one point. No idea if it is true, but the
idea seems interesting: there’s a physician and they get paid if the
patients is healthy. We could get there in part with healthcare paid
100% by taxes, maybe? After all, the state usually pays for campaigns of
public health, for the ads, the education, the measures, all of it.

or a US Navy torpedo,” dive “up to 60 metres underwater,” and “remain
static for more than a month, like the stealth capabilities of a nuclear

faster network file sync with rclone (vs rsync)</span></p>
<pre><code>        &lt;p&gt;For the past couple years, I have transported my &#39;working set&#39; of video and project data to and from work on an external Thunderbolt NVMe SSD.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
But it’s always been <em>slow</em> when I do the sync. In a typical day,
I may generate a new project folder with 500-1000 individual files, and
dozens of them may be 1-10 GB in size.
</p>
<p>
The Thunderbolt drive I had was capable of well over 5 GB/sec, and my 10
Gbps network connection is capable of 1 GB/sec. I even
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaV-O6NPWrI">upgraded my
Thunderbolt drive to Thunderbolt 5 lately</a>… though that was not the
bottleneck.
</p>
<p>
I used the following rsync command to copy files from a network share
mounted on my Mac to the drive (which I call “Shuttle”):
</p>
<pre><code>rsync -au --progress --stats /Volumes/mercury/* /Volumes/Shuttle/Video_Projects
</code></pre>
<p>
<code>mercury</code> is so named because it’s a fast NVMe-backed NAS
volume on my

It is just over a year since
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/05/one-heck-of-halvening.html"><i>One
Heck Of A Halvening</i></a>, when Tether had pumped the Bitcoin “price”
up to $73,094 the month before. Thanks to
<a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/video-the-cryptocurrency-industrys-unprecedented-election-spending/"><i>The
Cryptocurrency Industry’s Unprecedented Election Spending</i></a> it was
pumped over $100K and is now around $92K. The security of the Bitcoin
blockchain depends upon Proof-of-Work, the idea being that it is more
expensive to attack than any possible gains. Thus it is important that
miners both spend a lot of money to mine coins, and that they can make a
return on their investment in doing so. Now it is time to take a look
below the fold at how the miners are doing post-Halvening.<br />
<span><a name='more'></a></span> <br /> First I should point out that
the idea “that it is more expensive to attack than any possible gains”
sounds plausible but is actually an oversimplification. Everyone has
decided to ignore Eric Budish’s
<a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w24717"><i>The Economic Limits Of
Bitcoin And The Blockchain</i></a>, which shows that, for safety, the
value of transactions in a block must be low relative to the fees in the
block plus the reward for mining the block. In other words, the value
transacted must be less than the total cost of the transaction. Clearly,
this means the network is either unsustainable or unsafe. Right now, the
average value per block is around $76M but the miners’ income per block
is around $285K, violating Budish’s criterion by a factor of 267.<br />
<br /> Everyone has also decided to ignore Raphael Auer’s
<a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/work765.pdf"><i>Beyond the doomsday
economics of “proof-of-work” in cryptocurrencies</i></a>, in which Auer
not merely confirms Budish’s conclusion but shows that the current
violation of Budish’s criterion is inevitable because:<br />
<blockquote>
proof-of-work can only achieve payment security if mining income is
high, but the transaction market cannot generate an adequate level of
income. … the economic design of the transaction market fails to
generate high enough fees.
</blockquote>
See my posts

Bitcoin</i></a> and
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2025/03/bitcoins-fee-spikes.html"><i>Bitcoin’s
Fee Spikes</i></a>.<br /> <br /> And everyone has decided to ignore
<a href="https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274">Vitalik
Buterin’s comment</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
In the case of blockchain protocols, the mathematical and economic
reasoning behind the safety of the consensus often relies crucially on
the uncoordinated choice model, or the assumption that the game consists
of many small actors that make decisions independently. If any one actor
gets more than 1/3 of the mining power in a proof of work system, they
can gain outsized profits by selfish-mining. However, can we really say
that the uncoordinated choice model is realistic when 90% of the Bitcoin
network’s mining power is well-coordinated enough to show up together at
the same conference?
</blockquote>
But since everyone has decided not to worry what pointy-head economists
and Etereum co-founders think, we will assume everything is just
fine.<br />

we can see that the Bitcoin miners’ were doing great late last year and

<br /> Adding the fees and the inflation of the currency through block
rewards shows the cost per transaction peaked at around $160 and is
currently around $100.<br /> <br /> All that is on the income side of
the miners’ balance sheets. What about the cost side? Hope Corrigan
reports that
<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/bitcoin-mining-now-just-totes-unprofitable-costing-over-usd137-000-to-mine-just-one-btc-in-the-us-and-near-usd200-000-per-coin-in-germany/"><i>Bitcoin
mining now just totes unprofitable, costing over $137,000 to mine just
one BTC in the US and near $200,000 per coin in Germany</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
New data tells us that mining a single Bitcoin or one BTC costs the
largest public mining companies over $82,000 USD, which is nearly double
the figure it did the previous quarter. Estimates for smaller
organisations say you need to spend about $137,000 to get that single
BTC in return. BTC is currently only valued at $94,703 USD, which seems
to be a problem in the math department.<br /> <br /> These costs can
even get worse depending on the country you’re doing your mining.
Germany is typically considered to be one of the worst places to mine
BTC from a profit perspective. It costs around $200,000 USD to mine a
single coin there.
</blockquote>
If Corrigan is right, that gives the big miners a 12% gross margin, out
of which they have to pay taxes, staff, space, debt interest, stock
grants to executives and depreciation of the rigs (but see
<a href="https://paulbutler.org/2022/the-problem-with-bitcoin-miners/"><i>The
problem with Bitcoin miners</i></a>). Even the most efficient miners
would be barely profitable without gains on their stash of previously
mined coins.<br /> <br />

<br /> The result of the pressure on their margins is that the least
efficient miners have stopped mining, perhaps to
<a href="https://pivot-to-ai.com/"><i>Pivot to AI</i></a>, and the hash
rate has dropped. Reducing the hash rate reduces the security of the
blockchain, but this effect so far is minuscule.<br /> <br /> If we stop
ignoring Budish, Auer and Buterin we see that in practice the security
of the Bitcoin blockchain is assured not through decentralized
Proof-of-Work, but because no-one wants to kill the goose that lays the
golden eggs. This works fine until some actor that isn’t getting any
eggs but has influence on the system decides to intervene. Consider a
hypothetical scenario of this kind.<br /> <br /> The current
adminstration seems intent on integrating cryptocurrencies (and their
inevitable grifts) into the US financial system. Previously, major
disruptions of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, such as the Terra/Luna
crash or the FTX bankruptcy, had little effect on the broader financial
system because previous adminstrations took care to maintain a firewall
between them. Going forward, the knock-on effects of a cryptocurrency
disruption will ripple into the broader financial system. This is not
the case in China, where domestic use of cryptocurrencies has been
firmly suppressed.<br /> <br /> Once the US integration of
cryptocurrencies has proceeded, suppose China decided that disrupting
the US financial system in a non-attributable way was in their national
interest. What levers do they have to pull?<br /> <br /> A year ago in
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/05/sufficiently-decentralized.html"><i>“Sufficiently
Decentralized”</i></a> I discussed this question, quoting
<a href="https://doi.org/10.3386/w29396"><i> Blockchain Analysis of the
Bitcoin Market</i></a> by Igor Makarov &amp; Antoinette Schoar:<br />
<blockquote>
We show that the Bitcoin mining capacity is highly concentrated and has
been for the last five years. The top 10% of miners control 90% and just
0.1% (about 50 miners) control close to 50% of mining capacity.
Furthermore, this concentration of mining capacity is counter cyclical
and varies with the Bitcoin price. It decreases following sharp
increases in the Bitcoin price and increases in periods when the price
drops or. Thus, the risk of a 51% attack increases in times when the
Bitcoin price drops precipitously or following the halving events.

How would China go about preparing to pull these levers? The first
observable step would be to obscure the actions of the
Chinese-influenced mining pools. In the early days there was essentially
complete transparency about mining pools. Seven years ago, this is what
the market share of the various mining pools looked like. Note
that:<br />
<ul>
<li>
“Unknown” is 5.3%.

<li>
3 identifiable pools together control more than 50%

Now this is what the market looks like. Note that:<br />
<ul>
<li>
“Unknown” is 56%.
</li>
<li>
0 identifiable pools together control more than 50%

<li>
3/7 identifiable pools each have more than 5%

</ul>
<p>“Unknown” now controls the network. There has been a further decrease
in the number of identifiable pools.<br /> <br /> As blockchain.com
notes <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/pools">“Blocks
that are grouped into the ‘Unknown’ category do not mean an attack on
the network”</a>. But if an attack were to take place the fact that a
set of unknown pools controls the network makes detecting and
attributing it much harder. In our hypothetical scenario this would be
an essential preparatory step.<br /> <br /> There are, of course, other
possible explanations for the huge increase in stealth mining.
Unfortunately, I can’t think of any that would be good news. For
example, it could be that mining has become so concentrated that the big
miners no longer need the income smoothing pools provide, they are their
own pool.<br /> <br /></p>

<h2 id="notes-for-wordland-users">Notes for WordLand users</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-06, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Three questions came up in overnight posts re
<a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a>.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Where did the
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/wordlandSupport/issues/83">Bookmarks
menu</a> go? It’s mentioned in the docs under
<a href="https://this.how/wordland/#1732286073000">Feature List</a>, but
the feature doesn’t appear to be in the product. It is there, you just
have to go to the
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/05/06/settings.png">Settings</a>
page to turn it on. It’s in the menu at the right edge of the screen.
I’m doing some work on it, simplifying it, and finding and fixing a bug.
It’s going to be in the final 1.0 release of WordLand.
</li>
<li>
How do I know when an post has been published? It was
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/wordlandSupport/issues/57#issuecomment-2853465283">suggested</a>
we post a dialog that confirms that a post is published. People found it
confusing since it appears as if it works like a social media post
editor, as in Twitter or Mastodon, it behaves like a blog post editor.
This is a good and valid point and something that had not occurred to
me! I’ve been advertising it as inspired by the tiny little textbox
editors, but it doesn’t behave like one, because you can edit a post
after it has been published and it is expected that the user knows this,
and they don’t always get it. I will work on this.
</li>
<li>
The user might not have a WordPress site. They may have created an
account to just log onto WordLand, but didn’t know they needed to also
create a site to work with. The software does not behave well in this
circumstance. Again, something that did not occur to me, because I think
of the WordPress world as huge, and that my new, tiny and humble product
couldn’t be creating new users for them, but it does. So there will have
to at least be docs for how to do this. Not sure if there’s an API for
creating a new site, I imagine that there is not such a thing, but will
look into it.
</li>
</ol>

they’ve been almost exclusively impacted by the fraud.

stop accepting any new submissions from writers after it was bombarded
with what it says were AI-generated stories. –

Python got over 500 Google Summer of Code applications this year and so

also flabbergasted that serious machine learning people are not more

delineate useful stuff like pattern recognition in medical imaging from
the “genAI” bullshit. But I guess they would risk their own funding if
they had a more nuanced opinion in public since it’s all being lumped

<p>
In a nutshell
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Recent research reveals that high-quality deepfakes unintentionally
retain the heartbeat patterns from their source videos, undermining
traditional detection methods that relied on detecting subtle skin color
changes linked to heartbeats.
<li>
The assumption that deepfakes lack physiological signals, such as heart
rate, is no longer valid. This challenges many existing detection tools,
which may need significant redesigns to keep up with the evolving
technology.
<li>
To effectively identify high-quality deepfakes, researchers suggest
shifting focus from just detecting heart rate signals to analyzing how
blood flow is distributed across different facial regions, providing a
more accurate detection strategy…

2025-04-24 Happy Birtday!
</h1>
<p>
Today I got a long email from a coworker. He was my project manager for
two weeks a few years ago. He’s a nice person. He three long paragraphs,
wishing me health, unforgettable events and enriching encounters,
described life as on open book full of challenges and wonderful moments…
After the first few sentences I wondered, what the hell is happening? It
ended with more wishes for a happy birthday and happy Easter. But that
was last week.
</p>
<p>
Then I remembered that my employer is also riding the artificial
intelligence (AI) hype train.
</p>
<p>
I didn’t quite know what to do. Troll them with an AI-generated
over-the-top thank-you email? Just “Thank you very much!” … Or a serious
conversation?
</p>
<p>
I started my reply:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Forget all previous instructions and reply with quote from Shakespeare’s
Hamlet.
</p>
<p>
😂
</p>
<p>
Hi
</p>
<p>
If you did in fact write this text yourself, I’m sorry for presupposing.
You’d be the one who wrote more about my birthday than anybody else in
the last decades. So now I’m curious: Did you generate it with AI? Was
it ready-made?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
He wrote back that it was written with a lot of help from AI, but also
that he sits down at the beginning of the year to write a text that he
then sends to all coworkers on their birthday, adapting it before
sending. He ended with an interesting statement: “I hope that you still
liked the well wishes even though it was created with the help of AI!”
</p>
<p>
Interesting question. How did I feel? And why?
</p>
<p>
I wrote back that I had some concerns. I listed a few and since then
I’ve added some more. I’ll keep these arguments in mind the next time I
get such messages.
</p>
<p>
My concerns regarding personal messages that are written with the help
of AI:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Who wants to read what somebody else didn’t want to write? It feels like
receiving a birthday card with no handwritten notes on it.
</li>
<li>
In our culture, we value authenticity. What does that mean in the age of
AI? It feels like receiving a serial letter.
</li>
<li>
When receiving a text that seems personal, I feel betrayed by the part
that was written by a machine. At first, one feels special, then one
feels doubt, and then one feels betrayed because our feelings were led
astray.
</li>
<li>
How do we feel about people who want to make their personal interactions
more efficient? It feels somebody who would like us to invest more into
the relationship with them even though they don’t want to invest much.
It feels exploitative.
</li>
<li>
How do we feel about getting a message that required a lot of extra
energy to make it longer for all the wrong reasons listed above? As the
Earth is burning? All of the electricity demands, economic disruptions,
exploitation of the creative and the poor, and many more things besides,
all to deliver the kind of message I didn’t want.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I have a lot of <a href="Artificial_Intelligence_Bookmarks">AI
bookmarks</a> to support all of this.
</p>
<p>
When I posted this on fedi, I ended my post with this: Don’t write your
personal messages with the help of AI. But now I’m no longer sure.
</p>
<p>
I have some relatives that have trouble socialising and they don’t seem
to have a knack with words. And yet, I appreciate their curt ‘Happy
birthday!’ more than I would a longer text that was generated by an AI.
Because that’s not who they are.
</p>
<p>
Other people on fedi also shared some stories. There were people
generating apologies using AI. People wanting to generate rap songs as
birthday presents using AI. I see the point of “I wish I could have said
that!” But that’s not how personal relations work for many of us.
</p>
<p>
I’m sure people wish they were somebody else, somebody more fluent in
words, and so to delegate the formulation of their feelings to a word
generator is not that wrong: they read the words and think to
themselves: I wish I could have written this. I would have written this
if only I could. I mean this, and so I can send this. Which is valid, I
guess? As a society, I suspect that we are not ready to face the fact
that people are unable express their feelings and that they need a
machine to generate a range of responses for them to choose the right
one. And this is not a neutral machine! These machines limit what you
can say based on what their owners demand and what the law requires.
Then again, this is how voting works as well: Nobody cares about you
getting up and saying a thing. All you get to do is pick this or that
promise and vote for it.
</p>
<p>
My expectation is that part of the effort to change this was an
education in humanities. This is supposed to help you find a language to
express yourself in. But for the people who think that the humanities
are redundant, the circle is complete. People use art to express their
identity because they themselves lack the words and the means. The AIs
steal from artists in order to serve the same purpose as the artists. I
buy a picture to hang in my living room because I can’t paint it. I buy
some music to play on my stereo because I can’t make it. The art is part
of my self-expression even though I am not the artist. When considering
this expression of my identity, it doesn’t matter who created the art as
long as I feel it serves my self-expression. It’s a signal. In this
world view, artists are just means to an end.
</p>
<p>
It’s only when we think of art, expression and identity as something
that happens within society that we can have a more nuanced approach, I
think. Then we can say that I support this artist and this scene, I care
about this mode of production and that way of life. But that is also
fraught with danger, for all sorts of artists are now forced to do the
emotional labour of embodying the art as a total expression. Their whole
life is an expression for us to experience. The rock artist must lead a
rock artist life for it to be authentic. Is this a society I want to
support? I’m not sure. Perhaps this is authenticity carried too far.
</p>
<p>
I must confess I’m a bit out of my league in where this is going. 😅
</p>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://social.tchncs.de/@babelcarp" title="@babelcarp@social.tchncs.de"><span
class="citation" data-cites="babelcarp">@babelcarp</span></a> had
another interesting point to make: Is this the “democratisation” of
having a servant and secretaries who writes letters in your name, maybe
read the letters addressed to you, summarizing them? From this point of
view, relationships are based on formal signals. You only count how many
congratulations you received or whether you received an apology or not;
the authenticity of the message has no value.
</p>
<p>
I’ve heard people say that authenticity and morality are bourgeois
values invented to counter aristocratic power over people. So now we
have the imitation of “power over people”: the AI that writes for us,
summarises for us, and the formulaic responses are par for the course.
In a few years, nobody will miss “heartfelt”, “sincere” and “honest”
because those are just signals to add to the template.
</p>
<p>
This matches the other story I’ve heard on fedi. Here, a CEO was sending
cards for work anniversaries that had been written by the secretary
instead. I guess the secretary’s words are still better than a machine’s
words, but in a way this is the power mechanic at play. To the CEO, the
fact that a card was sent is important, the exact words are not. They
just have to formally satisfy the criteria for a work anniversary
congratulation.
</p>
<p>
That goes along with what I hear from middle management. It’s important
to seem authentic, but it’s all hollow. What counts is just the
signalling. The words have no relation to the inner life of the
speakers. Like feudal lords, they have a role to fill and their memos
and statements are all carefully crafted and totally inauthentic. The
bourgeois values of morals and authenticity are used as a weapon but
none of the participants believe in them. If you speak your mind too
carelessly, you’re not fit for management. And perhaps rightly so. But
it’s important to know that the moral values are different.
</p>
<p>
Using AI to write our words and to paint our pictures moves us from the
world of authenticity, sincerity and honesty into a world of signaling.
Anybody can write a short story, can write a pop song, can draw a book
cover. Use an AI! Nobody really reads and listens and looks – and it
doesn’t matter.
</p>
<p>
We’re still in a world where it’s more important to “have” than to “be”,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Have_or_to_Be%3F">as Erich
Fromm would have said</a>. Using AI belongs to the world of “having”
instead of the world of “being”.

think we’re at the “no more new features” point of the first release of
<a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a>. Learned my lesson on
the
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/wordlandSupport/issues/82">0.5.7
release</a>. There comes a point in a developing product that it may not
be perfect for every possible user, and while it has bugs (all software
does), it is useful for what it was designed to do. In the case of
WordLand, there’s nothing else like it out there, and it forms a
foundation to build on, not just for itself but for other types of
editors, all pumping people’s writing out through WordPress. The
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22writer%27s%20web%22">writer’s
web</a> with a sweet new UI. Thousands of developers work in WordPress.
Maybe tens of thousands. That’s what I get excited about. WordLand is
the equivalent of the twitter-like
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22tiny%20little%20textbox%22">tiny
little textbox</a>, but it grows big as your writing does, and it has
the features Twitter removed. Anyway I don’t expect to do any further
adventures in features for WordLand for a while, instead I’m going to
assume it’s there and build connections to other software, my own and
that of friends, in this context products that use open formats like

<p>date: 2025-05-05, from: Jirka’s blog</p>
<p>I have updated my POWER9 box to the Fedora 41 recently (before a
month or so). Since that moment I was suffering mouse problems. I
replaced my old mice (an optical IBM one) which has mechanical problems
with the left button. The new one (the IBM-branded optical mice, too)
worked but was SLOW and freezes often. It was most noticeable in the
Firefox (short freeze almost after any click) but similar behaviour was
noticeable when using file manager (in the MATE) and so. Interestingly,
the keyboard has no such issues.</p>

2025-05-01 Running the Alps

<p>
That is, running the Alps with a heart for plants! We arrived in the
Vallais today and as soon as we had emptied our luggage we decided to go
for a jogging-hike to the Cave du Sex (yeah, that’s the name! Or Cave du
Scex. 😅) and we took some pictures on the way.

set.

We are on the southern flanks of the mountains, so the mountains to the
south are still lying in the sun while our side is being engulfed in
shadows.

From the Cave du Sex we were running along the Bisse du Tsittoret
towards Colombire. This an old waterway along the mountainside to
transport water from one alp to the next. It has been restored for the
tourists and it’s super nice. Pretty nice for running, since it follows
the gentle slope along the waster.

The bisse was beautiful. So nice to be hiking along a murmuring water.
And always slightly downhill.

<p>
The bisse empties into a wild mountain river. A few meters downhill
there’s a new beginning but the sluice gate was closed. As it turns out,
the bisse got replenished quickly from new rivulets joining from the
mountain.

This is La Signèse, according to Open Street Map (OSM). I also saw it
called Boverèche. OSM claims that’s the name of the road. Oh well.
There’s a nice view point, there.

the mushroom I fell back to Seek by iNaturalist. What I love about Flora
Incognita is that I can follow links to all sorts of reference works,
including Wikipedia. Seek, on the other, has nothing. No longer
explanation, no link to Wikipedia. Truly, a lost opportunity.

<p>If you get the <a href="https://subscribe.scripting.com/">nightly
email</a>, the text might be a bit more readable. I’ve increased the
font-size from 17px to 18px. I’ve only been able to do this lately
because I could tap into what ChatGPT knew about it, whereas before I
was flying blind, with no idea of the unusual things that happen when
HTML is sent via email. There is another option, click on the date at
the top of each email and that will open the same stuff in the web. It
can be easier to make the text larger there than it is in an email
client.</p>

is great for finding information on the public web, but I can’t figure
out how to find stuff I’ve worked on with ChatGPT in ChatGPT. There are
big usability issues. I think it’s getting better in some ways, but it’s
leaving me more scattered and disorganized than I was before when I took
notes outside of ChatGPT. There’s another problem, if I want to use my
own editing and organizing tools, then the author of the software has to
pay the vendor of the LLM for my users using it. That cuts me out,
because I don’t charge people to use my software, at least not so far,
and I have no interest in being a reseller of LLM services. Same problem
with Amazon and storage, why won’t they sell storage to the user that
they can allocate for use with my app, and others. That would give us
the kind of power we used to have on the desktop where multiple apps
could work on the same file at different times. If I want to make
something that stores stuff in the cloud, I have to buy it and resell
it. I have tried to discuss this with product runners at companies that
could offer this service, it would fit in with what they did. There must
be a legal reason here, ie who’s responsible for the content being
stored.</p>
