<p>date: 2025-01-19, updated: 2025-01-19, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Netflix’s continued investment in anime has yielded fruit over the

<p>Grand Theft Hamlet is a documentary film, kind of. It’s also an
experimental theater project. It’s also a rough-and-ready feature-length
machinima, made entirely in-game in Grand Theft Auto Online. It’s also a

<p>Nintendo showcased its next console, the Nintendo Switch 2, on

likely intended. Nintendo had previously said very little about its next
console, so Nintendo and console insiders took matters into their own
hands. We’d be remiss to call what’s happened over the past several

<p>Nintendo officially revealed its next-gen console, Nintendo Switch 2,

between battle passes in Marvel Rivals</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-13, updated: 2025-01-13, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Swapping between battle passes in Marvel Rivals is a great way to get
seasonal rewards from a previous season if you’ve existed the current.
These battle passes offer a ton of value, adding new skins, sprays,
emotes, and more to the game every season. In this Marvel Rivals guide,
we’ll walk you through how to […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-01-13, updated: 2025-01-13, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>The upcoming Helldivers movie won’t heavily involve the developers of
the game, according to Arrowhead Game Studios creative director Johan
Pilestedt. Pilestedt was asked on X if the studio would have a hand in
the production of the upcoming film. “The short answer is yes. The long
answer is that we’ll see,” he replied. “We […]</p>

<h2 id="culture-shock">Culture Shock</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-13, updated: 2025-01-10, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>This week on Polygon, we’re looking at how cultural differences
affect media in a special issue called Culture Shock. From text
localization to character design, religious considerations to
censorship, we’re looking at some of the many ways things get
complicated when games, shows, and movies are released in different
territories — or change back home […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-01-13, updated: 2025-01-10, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>With 5,381 people listed in its credits, CD Projekt Red’s Cyberpunk
2077 is one of the game industry’s largest productions to date. And as
it turns out, almost half of those people contributed to the game’s
localization. As part of Polygon’s Culture Shock issue, we asked
developer CD Projekt Red to shed light on the […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-01-13, updated: 2025-01-10, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>In 2000, shortly after the launch of The Sims, publisher Electronic
Arts and developer Maxis discovered that the game was popular with a
demographic EA had theretofore never seriously entertained: young women
and teenage girls. “We never set out to make this a game that was
popular with girls at all,” said original game designer […]</p>

<p>Finding a good 55-inch OLED TV for under $800 is very rare, but an
amazing deal we spotted at Walmart in December has made a comeback, and
it easily beats any TV deal we’ve seen since then. The LG B3 OLED 4K TV
is $798 (was $1,199) at Walmart, and is likely to sell out […]</p>

<p>Jujutsu Infinite allows you to see how you would fare in the world of

you take on cursed spirits using innate techniques, curse skills and
cursed tools. However, to get some of the best innate techniques, you’ll

<p>date: 2025-01-12, updated: 2025-01-10, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Creating a brand-new franchise in a world of IP adaptations is hard
work. Just ask Christian Gudegast, writer-director of the Den of Thieves
franchise. The first movie in the series broke out as a surprise hit in
2018, leading to a sequel now out in theaters. Den of Thieves 2: Pantera
goes bigger and bolder, […]</p>

<p>One poorly understood aspect of the modern games industry is the
question of how players find new games. Particularly for smaller indie
devs with little or no advertising budget, it’s sort of miraculous that
any game can go from 0 players to thousands, let alone millions. Most
people give the credit for breakout hit indie […]</p>
