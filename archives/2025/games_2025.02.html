release Animal Crossing in the West, Nintendo ‘had to change
everything’</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-14, updated: 2025-01-14, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Credit the COVID-19 pandemic, social media, or turnip gambling, but
as of Nintendo’s latest financial data, Animal Crossing: New Horizons is
second to Mario Kart 8 Deluxe in all-time Switch software sales. At over
46 million, that’s more than 10 million above Super Smash
Bros. Ultimate, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, or […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-01-14, updated: 2025-01-14, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>The Ayaneo Pocket Micro is the modern Sony Walkman of gaming
handhelds — that is to say, its boxy, high-end design is strangely
appealing, and because of its high price and narrow focus, it’s only
going to please a certain type of person. To stand out from the crowd of
Android gaming handhelds, of which […]</p>

<p>Donkey Kong Country Returns just won’t stop returning. Players may
recall the game’s initial launch for the Wii in 2010 and perhaps even
the updated Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D for the 3DS from 2013, but
that’s just the tip of the banana hoard. Returns was also reissued for
both Wii and 3DS as part […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-01-14, updated: 2025-01-14, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Godzilla is coming to Fortnite in Chapter 6 Season 1, ready to stomp
on everything (and look extremely weird wearing Kicks while doing so).
Compared to previous seasonal skins, like Solid Snake, Geralt of Rivia,
and Wolverine, Godzilla’s intimidating bulk doesn’t quite transpose to a
vaguely humanoid frame. But the character’s signature chonkiness

<p>During a recent live concert at Demodé Club in Modugno, Puglia, as a

<p>The Fortnite Festival Season 7 music pass is full of Hatsune
Miku-themed rewards as the virtual singer makes her debut. The music

<p>Roselia, the thorn Pokémon from Hoenn, can be found in the wild in
Pokémon Go. Yes, Roselia can be shiny in Pokémon Go! Roserade is
actually a really good grass- and poison-type attacker, so it’s worth
grabbing a powerful one if you can. If you already have a shiny Roselia

<p>Swapping between battle passes in Marvel Rivals is a great way to get
seasonal rewards from a previous season if you’ve existed the current.
These battle passes offer a ton of value, adding new skins, sprays,
emotes, and more to the game every season. In this Marvel Rivals guide,

<p>The upcoming Helldivers movie won’t heavily involve the developers of
the game, according to Arrowhead Game Studios creative director Johan
Pilestedt. Pilestedt was asked on X if the studio would have a hand in
the production of the upcoming film. “The short answer is yes. The long

<p>This week on Polygon, we’re looking at how cultural differences

localization to character design, religious considerations to
censorship, we’re looking at some of the many ways things get
complicated when games, shows, and movies are released in different

<p>With 5,381 people listed in its credits, CD Projekt Red’s Cyberpunk
2077 is one of the game industry’s largest productions to date. And as
it turns out, almost half of those people contributed to the game’s
localization. As part of Polygon’s Culture Shock issue, we asked

<p>In 2000, shortly after the launch of The Sims, publisher Electronic
Arts and developer Maxis discovered that the game was popular with a
demographic EA had theretofore never seriously entertained: young women
and teenage girls. “We never set out to make this a game that was
popular with girls at all,” said original game designer […]</p>

<p>Finding a good 55-inch OLED TV for under $800 is very rare, but an
amazing deal we spotted at Walmart in December has made a comeback, and
it easily beats any TV deal we’ve seen since then. The LG B3 OLED 4K TV

<p>date: 2025-01-12, updated: 2025-01-10, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Creating a brand-new franchise in a world of IP adaptations is hard
work. Just ask Christian Gudegast, writer-director of the Den of Thieves
franchise. The first movie in the series broke out as a surprise hit in
2018, leading to a sequel now out in theaters. Den of Thieves 2: Pantera

<p>One poorly understood aspect of the modern games industry is the
question of how players find new games. Particularly for smaller indie
devs with little or no advertising budget, it’s sort of miraculous that
any game can go from 0 players to thousands, let alone millions. Most
people give the credit for breakout hit indie […]</p>
