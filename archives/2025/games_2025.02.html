<h2 id="culture-shock">Culture Shock</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-13, updated: 2025-01-10, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>This week on Polygon, we’re looking at how cultural differences
affect media in a special issue called Culture Shock. From text
localization to character design, religious considerations to
censorship, we’re looking at some of the many ways things get
complicated when games, shows, and movies are released in different
territories — or change back home […]</p>

game</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-13, updated: 2025-01-10, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>With 5,381 people listed in its credits, CD Projekt Red’s Cyberpunk
2077 is one of the game industry’s largest productions to date. And as
it turns out, almost half of those people contributed to the game’s
localization. As part of Polygon’s Culture Shock issue, we asked
developer CD Projekt Red to shed light on the […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-01-13, updated: 2025-01-10, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>In 2000, shortly after the launch of The Sims, publisher Electronic
Arts and developer Maxis discovered that the game was popular with a
demographic EA had theretofore never seriously entertained: young women
and teenage girls. “We never set out to make this a game that was
popular with girls at all,” said original game designer […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-01-13, updated: 2025-01-13, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Finding a good 55-inch OLED TV for under $800 is very rare, but an
amazing deal we spotted at Walmart in December has made a comeback, and
it easily beats any TV deal we’ve seen since then. The LG B3 OLED 4K TV
is $798 (was $1,199) at Walmart, and is likely to sell out […]</p>

turquoise twintailed singer is coming to the world of Fortnite, and
based on a series of leaks, she’s bringing along new outfits, items, and
jam tracks for you to use. You can play her hit songs in Fortnite

<p>The Midnight Features event arrives in Marvel Rivals with the launch
of Season 1. The Midnight Features event consists of five
investigations, with the first investigation being available at launch
and the rest on their way as the event progresses. You can earn currency
and sprays from completing missions, and get bigger prizes like gallery

<p>Jujutsu Infinite allows you to see how you would fare in the world of
Jujutsu Kaisen in Roblox. Jujutsu Infinite is an open-world RPG where
you take on cursed spirits using innate techniques, curse skills and
cursed tools. However, to get some of the best innate techniques, you’ll
need to go through a gacha system […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-01-12, updated: 2025-01-10, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Creating a brand-new franchise in a world of IP adaptations is hard
work. Just ask Christian Gudegast, writer-director of the Den of Thieves
franchise. The first movie in the series broke out as a surprise hit in
2018, leading to a sequel now out in theaters. Den of Thieves 2: Pantera
goes bigger and bolder, […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-01-12, updated: 2025-01-10, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>One poorly understood aspect of the modern games industry is the
question of how players find new games. Particularly for smaller indie
devs with little or no advertising budget, it’s sort of miraculous that
any game can go from 0 players to thousands, let alone millions. Most
people give the credit for breakout hit indie […]</p>
