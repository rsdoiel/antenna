## The Trump administration’s big group chat fail

date: 2025-03-24, from: Market Place, Make me Smart

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Most of us can only wonder what goes on in U.S. national security leaders’ group chats, but The Atlantic’s Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey Goldberg doesn&#8217;t have to. Last week, Goldberg was accidentally included in a Signal group chat with high-ranking members of the Donald Trump administration, in which they discussed imminent war operations. Yes, this actually happened. Plus, the whopping $2.1 billion verdict you might&#8217;ve missed over Roundup weed killer. And, we smile over what&#8217;s happened since congestion pricing went into effect in Manhattan — all while dropping some Latin vocab.</p>
