Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0752 AM CDT Sun Jun 15 2025

Valid 151300Z - 161200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE NORTHERN PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms capable of producing large to very
large hail and swaths of severe/damaging gusts (some 75+ mph) are
likely across portions of central/eastern Montana into northeast
Wyoming and the western Dakotas this afternoon through tonight.
Additional strong to severe thunderstorms may occur across the
central/southern Plains, and over parts of Virginia and North
Carolina.

...Northern/Central Plains...
Ongoing thunderstorms across northeast MT may pose an isolated hail
threat this morning. Otherwise, upper ridging will continue to
prevail over the Southwest and southern Rockies today, with a subtle
mid-level shortwave trough forecast to advance northeastward across
the northern Rockies and adjacent High Plains through the period.
This feature will likely aid in the development of initially
high-based convection over parts of the northern Rockies in MT by
early to mid afternoon. Meanwhile, diurnal heating of a fairly moist
low-level airmass (surface dewpoints generally in the mid to upper
50s) and steep mid-level lapse rates will foster around 2000-3000
J/kg of MLCAPE through the afternoon across much of central/eastern
MT along and south of a convectively reinforced boundary. Modest
low-level east-southeasterly flow will veer to west-southwesterly
and strengthen with height through mid/upper levels. This will
support around 40-50 kt of effective bulk shear and organized
convection.

Intense thunderstorm development appears increasingly likely across
central MT by mid to late afternoon, as large-scale ascent
associated with the shortwave trough overspreads the surface warm
sector. Given the rather favorable thermodynamic/kinematic
environment expected, initial convection will likely be
supercellular and pose a threat for large to very large hail
potentially up to 2-3 inches in diameter. The Enhanced Risk has been
expanded westward some in central MT to account for this expected
supercell development, and a 30% area has been included for large
hail as well. With time this evening, one or more clusters will
likely evolve from the initially discrete activity across eastern MT
into parts of northeast WY and the western Dakotas. Steepened
low-level lapse rates should aid in efficient mixing of intense
downdraft winds to the surface, and swaths of severe/damaging winds
should occur as thunderstorms spread eastward through the evening
and into early Monday morning. Some of these winds may be
significant, with peak gusts potentially reaching up to 70-80 mph on
an isolated basis.

Isolated to scattered high-based thunderstorms should develop along
the surface trough/dryline within a moist low-level upslope flow
regime across portions of southeast WY into eastern CO, and perhaps
persisting into western NE/KS. This activity will pose a risk of
strong to severe outflow winds given a deeply mixed boundary layer
and the presence of very steep low-level lapse rates. Isolated hail
may also occur where any robust updrafts can be maintained within a
modestly sheared environment.

...Southern Plains...
Extensive, loosely organized convection is ongoing this morning
across much of western/southern OK and vicinity. This activity is
being aided by modest low-level warm moist advection associated with
a 20-30 kt southwesterly low-level jet. Current expectations are for
these thunderstorms to generally weaken through the rest of the
morning as the low-level jet gradually weakens. Even so, an isolated
threat for strong/gusty winds may persist with these clusters as
they spread generally south-southeastward. There may be some chance
for either this morning convection or related outflow to regenerate
new, robust convection this afternoon across parts of TX. Have
expanded the Marginal Risk for wind southward a bit to account for
this potential, but in general weak shear should limit convective
organization with southward extent. Otherwise, an isolated severe
threat may exist with convection that develops across AR this
afternoon in proximity to a remnant MCV, and along/east of the
surface lee trough/dryline across the southern High Plains.

...Virginia/North Carolina...
A low-amplitude mid-level shortwave trough will move eastward across
the central/southern Appalachians today. A related weak surface low
should develop eastward near the NC/VA border through the afternoon.
A moist and unstable airmass will likely be in place across much of
NC and southern VA as filtered daytime heating occurs. Poor lapse
rates aloft and modest deep-layer shear should limit the overall
severe potential across this region. Still, isolated wet microbursts
and/or marginally severe hail may occur with the stronger
updrafts/cores that can develop this afternoon and early evening.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM MST (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Dalila was 
located near latitude 18.1 North, longitude 107.4 West. Dalila is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h). This general 
motion is expected during the next couple days, as Dalila moves 
farther away from the southwestern coast of Mexico.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 60 mph (95 km/h) with 
higher gusts. Steady weakening is forecast during the next couple of 
days, with the system becoming a post-tropical remnant low tonight 
or Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 996 mb (29.42 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Dalila can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header
WTPZ44 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Additional rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches are expected
across portions of the Mexican states of MichoacÃ¡n and Guerrero
this morning, with localized storm totals up to 9 inches near the
coast. Any instances of flash flooding and mudslides should
decrease later today.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Storm Dalila, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic available at

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0359 AM CDT Sun Jun 15 2025

Valid 181200Z - 231200Z

...DISCUSSION...
...Wednesday/Day 4 and Thursday/Day 5...
A mid-level trough is forecast to move through the Upper Midwest on
Wednesday, as a cold front advances southeastward into the lower
Missouri and mid-Mississippi Valleys. Ahead of the front, moderate
instability is forecast to develop by afternoon. Thunderstorms
appear likely to form along parts of the front, with several
clusters or line segments moving eastward toward the instability
axis during the late afternoon and early evening. Moderate
deep-layer shear should support severe storms with large hail and
wind damage as the primary threats.

The mid-level trough is forecast to move into the lower Great Lakes
and upper Ohio Valley on Thursday, as the cold front advances into
the central Appalachians. As the airmass ahead of the front
destabilizes, scattered thunderstorms are expected to form along and
ahead of the front. The models suggest that moderate deep-layer
shear will be in place across much of the northeastern U.S., which
will likely support organized storms. Damaging winds gusts will be
the most likely severe threat.

...Friday/Day 6 to Sunday/Day 8...
A shortwave mid-level ridge is forecast to move into the upper
Mississippi Valley on Friday. The ridge is forecast to remain over
the region on Saturday as mid-level heights rise. Beneath the ridge,
a moist and unstable airmass will likely be in place from the lower
to mid Missouri Valley northeastward into the western Great Lakes.
Within this airmass, isolated thunderstorm development should take
place both Friday and Saturday afternoon. Instability and deep-layer
shear appear sufficient for a localized severe threat. However, the
presence of the ridge introduces uncertainty as to where the
greatest potential for convection will be. For this reason,
predictability is low.

On Sunday, a mid-level trough is forecast to develop over the
Rockies as a ridge moves into the Great Lakes region. Although a
moist and unstable airmass should be located over parts of the
northern and eastern U.S., large-scale ascent and mid-level flow is
forecast to be relatively weak in most areas. For this reason, any
severe potential is expected to remain isolated.

Tropical Storm Dalila Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042025
200 AM MST Sun Jun 15 2025
 
Dalila is likely near its peak intensity, with little change in
organization evident since the previous advisory package. The latest
subjective Dvorak intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB were 65
knots and 55 knots, respectively. Objective estimates ranged from
45 to 57 knots, while an ASCAT pass earlier in the day showed
numerous 50 knot wind barbs. Based on a blend of these data, the
initial intensity for this advisory has been held at 55 knots.
 
Dalila is now heading toward the west-northwest, or 285/12 knots. A
turn toward the west is expected during the next day or so, as 
Dalila is steered by a mid-level ridge over northern Mexico and the 
southwest U.S. A westward to slightly south of due west motion is 
then forecast through dissipation as Dalila moves over much
cooler waters. The current forecast shows Dalila becoming a
post-tropical remnant low in a day or so, and dissipating by 
Tuesday. The latest track forecast is very close to that of the 
previous advisory, and is close to the track consensus aids.

Dalila should begin to weaken later today as some drier mid-level
air evident in water vapor imagery begins to impact the system.  
More steady weakening is then likely as the system moves
over much cooler water and into a progressively drier mid-level
environment. The latest intensity forecast is close to the previous
advisory and in good agreement with the intensity consensus
guidance.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. The outer bands of Tropical Storm Dalila will bring locally heavy 
rainfall to the Mexican states of MichoacÃ¡n and Guerrero through 
this morning. Scattered areas of flooding and mudslides are 
expected, especially in areas of steep terrain near the coast.
 
2. Dalila is expected to produce tropical-storm-force winds across
portions of the warning area during the next few hours.  Winds 
will diminish today while the system moves farther offshore of the 
coast of southwestern Mexico.

Mesoscale Discussion 1288
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0353 PM CDT Sat Jun 14 2025

Areas affected...Northeast Alabama into North Georgia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 142053Z - 142300Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Locally damaging winds may occur with marginally organized
bands of convection. Storms are expected to weaken around sunset.

DISCUSSION...A belt of modestly stronger mid-level winds is evident
on regional VAD data near a weakening trough in the mid Ohio Valley.
With strong daytime heating of a moist (low 70s F dewpoints)
airmass, around 2000 J/kg MLCAPE has developed this afternoon. A few
clusters of storms have become marginally organized this afternoon.
A recent observed gust of 44 kts at the Rome, GA ASOS suggests
near-severe/potentially damaging gusts are possible with this
activity. As daytime heating wanes, storms should gradually decrease
in intensity by sunset.

Mesoscale Discussion 1287
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0259 PM CDT Sat Jun 14 2025

Areas affected...Parts of western/southwest Oklahoma

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 141959Z - 142200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Observational trends suggest some potential for storm
development in western/southwestern Oklahoma. While initiation is
still not certain, all severe hazards would be possible. Trends will
continue to be monitored.

DISCUSSION...With the stronger convection moving out of eastern
Oklahoma into western Arkansas, the outflow across central Oklahoma
has only been weakly reinforced through the afternoon. Notable
airmass recovery has occurred along the southwestern/western flank
of this outflow. Over the past hour or so, cumulus have continued to
deepen in parts of southwest and western Oklahoma. Given weak
forcing aloft, it is not clear parcels will be able to remain in the
zone of ascent long enough to reach their LFC. However, if
initiation occurs, the environment would support severe storms.

Mid-level winds are enhanced on the southwestern flank of an MCV
near the KS/OK border, promoting around 30 kts of effective shear.
Storms would likely be supercellular. Large hail (potentially to
around 2 inches) and severe winds would be possible. Significant
hail would likely be isolated given fairly weak upper-level winds.
Given the backed southeasterly surface winds and favorable storm
mode, a tornado would also be possible. Forecast soundings and the
KTLX VAD suggest sufficient low-level SRH.

Given the uncertainties in this scenario, a watch is not currently
expected in the short term. However, one would be possible should
confidence in initiation increase.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 414
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
240 PM MDT Sat Jun 14 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Northeast Colorado
  The Nebraska Panhandle
  Extreme southwest South Dakota
  Eastern Wyoming

* Effective this Saturday afternoon and evening from 240 PM until
  900 PM MDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
    inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...A few thunderstorm clusters, and potentially a couple of
supercells, are expected to form and spread eastward from eastern
Wyoming into the Nebraska Panhandle and adjacent parts of far
southwest South Dakota and northeast Colorado through late evening. 
Large hail of 1-2 inches in diameter and severe outflow gusts of
60-70 mph will be the main threats.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 60
statute miles east and west of a line from 25 miles north northeast
of Gillette WY to 60 miles southwest of Sidney NE. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update

Tropical Storm Dalila Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042025
300 PM CST Sat Jun 14 2025
 
Deep convection continues to burst over the center of Dalila, with 
cold cloud tops near -80 C and a well-defined convective band shown 
in satellite imagery. A recent scatterometer pass showed peak winds 
near 55 kt, which prompted an increase in the estimated intensity to 
55 kt during the intermediate advisory. Since then, the convective 
structure has remained steady, and with both objective and 
subjective satellite intensity estimates continuing to support this 
intensity, thus, the initial intensity is held at 55 kt for this 
advisory.

The initial motion is estimated at 300/9 kt. The storm is expected 
to continue moving toward the west-northwest into tonight, then 
begin turning toward the west by Sunday as the mid- to upper-level 
ridge continues to strengthen to the north. The forecast guidance 
remains in good agreement with this scenario, and the new forecast 
track is close to the various consensus models and is similar to the 
previous NHC forecast.

Dalila has likely reached its peak intensity and the storm may 
maintain its current strength for a few more hours. By Sunday, the 
storm will begin moving over cooler waters and into a drier, more 
stable environment, which will initiate a weakening trend. The 
system is forecast to become a remnant low in 48 hours, then 
dissipate into an open trough in 72 hours. The NHC intensity 
forecast closely follows a blend of the statistical-dynamical 
guidance and is very similar to the previous forecast.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. The outer bands of Tropical Storm Dalila will bring locally heavy 
rainfall to the Mexican states of MichoacÃ¡n and Guerrero through 
Sunday morning. Scattered areas of flooding and mudslides are 
expected, especially in areas of steep terrain near the coast.
 
2. Dalila is expected to produce tropical-storm-force winds across
portions of the warning area today.

THE CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS...AND FROM SOUTHERN KANSAS INTO CENTRAL
OKLAHOMA...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms capable of producing large hail and
damaging wind gusts will be possible across parts of the northern
and central High Plains this afternoon and evening. Large hail and
damaging winds will also be possible this afternoon from eastern
Oklahoma into western Arkansas, and late tonight from southern
Kansas into central/northeast Oklahoma.

...20z Update...
The previous forecast largely remains on track with only minor
adjustments made to account for recent convective trends. 

...Western Arkansas...
A loosely organized MCS continues to move across western AR, and
while GOES IR imagery continues to show deep/robust updraft
development, MRMS echo top imagery over the past couple of hours
reveals that these updrafts have been fairly transient, likely owing
to weak deep-layer wind shear. The MCS will likely continue to move
east/southeast towards southwestern AR through peak heating and may
be capable of damaging winds, but given the recent  trends, 15%
wind/Slight risk probabilities have been removed from western AR.

...Oklahoma...
An outflow boundary is noted in visible imagery and surface
observations from south-central OK to western OK. This boundary is
sufficiently displaced from the upper cirrus associated with the MCS
to the east to yield surface temperatures in the 80s on the cool
side of the boundary. Consequently, a corridor of southeasterly
low-level flow and MLCAPE upwards of 2500-3000 J/kg is in place
across southwest/western OK and could be a preferential corridor for
a supercell or two later this evening. Latest CAM guidance has
hinted at this possibility, but solutions continue to vary.
Additional convection along and north of this boundary remains
likely later tonight as the nocturnal jet strengthens and isentropic
ascent increases. Continued re-development of elevated convection
across north-central OK casts some uncertainty on where initiation
later tonight is most likely, and may result in more focused
convection along and west of the I-35 corridor. Here again, CAM
solutions have not captured recent convective trends well and show
some variance in the exact evolution. Regardless, 15% hail/wind
probabilities have been shifted westward to account for these
trends.

...Central to Northern High Plains...
The early stages of convective initiation are underway across
central to eastern WY with further development and intensification
expected through the evening. See MCD #1286 for additional details.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1125 AM CDT Sat Jun 14 2025/

...KS/OK/AR this afternoon through tonight...
Convection is ongoing this morning in several clusters from
southeast KS into central and eastern OK.  The KS cluster had the
better defined cold pool and MCV this morning, but has weakened
while moving into the areas of rain-cooled air in the immediate wake
of the OK convection.  The environment downstream into AR could
support some continuation of the eastern OK storms that have
intensified recently, with an attendant threat for occasional wind
damage and isolated large hail with multicell clusters.

The convectively-enhanced midlevel trough will remain over eastern
KS into tonight, when a southwesterly low-level jet is expected to
develop as the low levels recover in the wake of this morning's
storms.  Related increases in low-level warm advection will support
new thunderstorm development tonight in roughly the same areas being
impacted by the weakening storms this morning, and an MCS could
evolve in this warm advection zone overnight.  An environment with
steep midlevel lapse rates, large CAPE, and some enhancement to
low-midlevel vertical shear will favor the potential for large hail,
severe outflow gusts and a low chance for a couple of tornadoes.

...MT/central High Plains late this afternoon into late evening...
Subtle height rises are expected over the High Plains and MT, with
the stronger mid-upper flow confined mostly to MT.  Forcing for
ascent will likewise be relatively weak, with some upslope flow
component along and east of a lee trough.  At least widely scattered
thunderstorm development is expected east/northeast of the higher
terrain from eastern WY into northeast CO, and potentially along the
baroclinic zone across central MT.  A few supercells will be
possible with large hail from MT into eastern WY, though storms with
southward extent will have more of a threat for severe outflow gusts
based on a tendency to grow upscale on merging outflow in an
environment with steep lapse rates and deep-layer vertical shear
that will be close to the lower margins for sustained supercells. 
There will be some potential for a cluster or two to persist
overnight while spreading eastward over the High Plains.

...Mid-Atlantic to the southern Appalachians this afternoon...
Along and south of a stalled front from southern DE into northern
MD/VA, surface heating is ongoing in cloud breaks.  As surface
temperatures warm into the 80s with 72-74 F dewpoints, MLCAPE will
increase to near 2000 J/kg this afternoon.  Modest enhancement to
vertical shear (effective bulk shear of 25-30 kt) with subtle
perturbations crossing the Appalachians could allow for some
clustering of storms with the potential for isolated wind damage.

Scattered thunderstorms are expected farther southwest into the
southern Appalachians and vicinity, immediately east of the slowly
weakening midlevel trough over KY/TN.  Moderate buoyancy, DCAPE
approaching 1000 J/kg and roughly 30 kt midlevel flow could be
sufficient for isolated downbursts with associated wind damage.

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS PORTIONS OF THE
NORTHERN/CENTRAL GREAT PLAINS INTO THE UPPER MIDWEST...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe storms with isolated large hail and wind damage are
expected on Monday from the northern High Plains east-northeastward
into the upper Mississippi Valley. Outside of this area, marginally
severe storms will be possible across much of the central and
northern U.S.

...Synopsis...
A belt of mid-level westerly flow will move across the central/high
Plains on D3/Monday, dampening ridge heights and creating a more of
a zonal flow regime. A surface low will deepen across eastern
Colorado, with a southwest to northeast oriented cold front shifting
south and eastward across Nebraska through the period.

...Great Plains/Upper Midwest..
Convection is likely to be ongoing across portions of North
Dakota/Minnesota. Additional thunderstorm development is expected
along the aforementioned cold front in Nebraska/southern Dakotas by
Monday afternoon. Guidance suggest there will be MLCIN in place
across some portion of the central plains, weakening with northward
extent into central Nebraska. Forcing for ascent is along expected
to be greatest in the region from central Nebraska into southern
South Dakota with the advancing wave and cold front, which should
aid eroding of remaining CIN. Deep layer shear largely parallel to
the cold front should encourage linear modes, with potential for
damaging wind given steep low to mid-level lapse rates. This should
advance eastward along the front into portions of the Upper Mid-west
through time.

More isolated development may be possible across portions of the
central Plains, though warmer 850 mb temperatures and stronger MLCIN
beneath higher heights will keep the overall severe threat more
marginal. Forecast soundings suggest that moderate deep-layer shear
and steep mid-level lapse rates will be in place over much of the
moist air mass. This should support an isolated severe threat, with
hail and strong wind gusts possible.

...Synopsis...
Modest southwesterly flow aloft is expected over the Great Basin on
Sunday, and strong mixing during the afternoon will bring some of
that flow down to the surface. Across parts of northwestern Nevada,
RH is expected to be near 5-15% with gusts to 20-25 mph. Fuels in
the region are relatively dry, with no rain expected in the
intervening period. For this reason, have introduced Elevated
highlights in this area.

Valid 151200Z - 161200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe storms, capable of large hail and severe wind
gusts, are expected on Sunday in parts of the northern and central
High Plains. Additional strong to severe storms are possible in
parts of North Carolina and Virginia.

...Synopsis...
An upper-level high will remain in place across the central/northern
Plains into the northern Rockies on D2/Sunday. Westerly flow aloft
will move across the ridge, with a few shortwave impulses rotating
through the flow. Afternoon thunderstorm development is expected
from the Northern Rockies southward across the dryline in the
central high Plains. A surface low is expected to deepen across
Wyoming through the period, lifting northward across the Dakotas.

...Central and Northern Plains...
As the surface low across Wyoming deepens, east to southeasterly
flow will continue across the central and northern Plains. Dew
points in the low to mid 60s will be common, allowing for strong to
moderate instability to develop by the afternoon. Upslope flow
across the northern Rockies and forcing for ascent with shortwaves
rounding the ridge will allow for scattered thunderstorm development
across the high terrain spreading into the lower elevations through
the later afternoon/evening. Generally straight hodograph profiles
will support initial supercell modes before clustering and upscale
growth occurs into the late afternoon. Given steep lapse rates and
ample deep layer shear, large to very large hail (some 2-3"+) will
be possible.

As the surface low deepens into the afternoon, mass response will
occur with an increase in a southerly low-level jet into the western
Dakotas. CAM guidance shows some uncertainty in evolution of storms
as they move eastward out of Montana. There is consistent signal
that an MCS will travel eastward across some portions of the
Dakotas, with potential for strong to significant winds (60-75+
mph). Should a more favorable corridor become established, an
upgrade to higher probabilities may be needed.

...Southern/South-Central Plains into the Missouri Valley...
An MCS will likely be ongoing across portions of Oklahoma into
northern Texas early in the period. Residual outflow in association
with this will set up across portion of north-central Texas into
Missouri. Convective re-development may be somewhat inhibited due to
warm air aloft and the presence of the mid-level ridge. In spite of
this, some convection will be possible as low-level convergence
increases during the day along pre-existing outflow boundaries.
Mid-level directional shear is evident on forecast soundings.  This
could be sufficient for some cell organization and a severe threat.
Hail and strong wind gusts would be possible.

...Northern North Carolina/Southern Virginia...
A subtle mid-level shortwave trough is forecast to move into the
southern and central Appalachians on Sunday. At the surface, a lee
low is forecast to develop over central North Carolina. Scattered
thunderstorm activity is expected to develop by the afternoon across
northern North Carolina into southern Virginia. Sufficient deep
layer and instability will allow for a few instances of severe wind
and hail within stronger cores.

...Synopsis...
A seasonably modest mid-level jet will be positioned over the
northern CONUS with the entrance region over the northern parts of
the Great Basin. This jet will provide the focus for fire weather
concerns today, with these being over northwest Nevada and in the
Columbia River Valley in Washington and Oregon. In northwest Nevada,
RH is expected to be near 5-15% with gusts of 20-25 mph with
afternoon mixing. Fuels in the area are relatively dry. Therefore,
have maintained the Elevated area in this outlook, though brief,
localized Critical conditions are possible. In the Columbia Valley,
RH is expected to be 10-20% with gusts to 20-25 mph and at least
modestly dry fuels, so have kept the Elevated area here as well.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON
INTO TONIGHT FOR MONTANA INTO THE CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS...AND FROM
SOUTHERN KANSAS AND CENTRAL OKLAHOMA INTO WESTERN ARKANSAS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms capable of producing large hail and
damaging wind gusts will be possible across parts of the northern
and central High Plains this afternoon and evening. Large hail and
damaging winds will also be possible this afternoon from eastern
Oklahoma into western Arkansas, and late tonight from southern
Kansas into central/northeast Oklahoma.

...KS/OK/AR this afternoon through tonight...
Convection is ongoing this morning in several clusters from
southeast KS into central and eastern OK.  The KS cluster had the
better defined cold pool and MCV this morning, but has weakened
while moving into the areas of rain-cooled air in the immediate wake
of the OK convection.  The environment downstream into AR could
support some continuation of the eastern OK storms that have
intensified recently, with an attendant threat for occasional wind
damage and isolated large hail with multicell clusters.

The convectively-enhanced midlevel trough will remain over eastern
KS into tonight, when a southwesterly low-level jet is expected to
develop as the low levels recover in the wake of this morning's
storms.  Related increases in low-level warm advection will support
new thunderstorm development tonight in roughly the same areas being
impacted by the weakening storms this morning, and an MCS could
evolve in this warm advection zone overnight.  An environment with
steep midlevel lapse rates, large CAPE, and some enhancement to
low-midlevel vertical shear will favor the potential for large hail,
severe outflow gusts and a low chance for a couple of tornadoes.

...MT/central High Plains late this afternoon into late evening...
Subtle height rises are expected over the High Plains and MT, with
the stronger mid-upper flow confined mostly to MT.  Forcing for
ascent will likewise be relatively weak, with some upslope flow
component along and east of a lee trough.  At least widely scattered
thunderstorm development is expected east/northeast of the higher

environment with steep lapse rates and deep-layer vertical shear
that will be close to the lower margins for sustained supercells. 
There will be some potential for a cluster or two to persist
overnight while spreading eastward over the High Plains.

...Mid-Atlantic to the southern Appalachians this afternoon...
Along and south of a stalled front from southern DE into northern
MD/VA, surface heating is ongoing in cloud breaks.  As surface
temperatures warm into the 80s with 72-74 F dewpoints, MLCAPE will
increase to near 2000 J/kg this afternoon.  Modest enhancement to
vertical shear (effective bulk shear of 25-30 kt) with subtle
perturbations crossing the Appalachians could allow for some
clustering of storms with the potential for isolated wind damage.

Scattered thunderstorms are expected farther southwest into the
southern Appalachians and vicinity, immediately east of the slowly
weakening midlevel trough over KY/TN.  Moderate buoyancy, DCAPE
approaching 1000 J/kg and roughly 30 kt midlevel flow could be
sufficient for isolated downbursts with associated wind damage.

Mesoscale Discussion 1283
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0733 AM CDT Sat Jun 14 2025

Areas affected...parts of south central and southeastern
Kansas...north central and northeastern Oklahoma

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 141233Z - 141430Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Potential for strong to severe wind gusts may continue
with thunderstorm outflow overspreading the central Kansas/Oklahoma
border vicinity during the next couple of hours.  But this seems
likely to diminish, as thunderstorms begin to weaken, while
approaching the Greater Tulsa vicinity toward mid to late morning.

DISCUSSION...The more intense thunderstorm development is being
maintained above the stronger leading edge of the consolidated
convective cold pool, now east and southeast of the Great Bend and
Medicine Lodge KS vicinities, where 2 hourly surface pressure rises
as high as 3+ mb have recently been observed.  A swath of rear
inflow on the order of 40-60+ kt has been evident in radar data,
mostly in the 2-5 km AGL layer, but measured surface gusts appear to
have mostly remained below severe limits.

This has been propagating southeastward around 30 kt, and could
approach the Tulsa OK vicinity by 15-16Z.  However, due to the
potential stabilizing impacts of downstream convection on the
southeasterly updraft inflow, it remains unclear how much longer
vigorous convective development will be maintained.  As this
weakens, the risk for strong to severe wind gusts is likely to
subsequently diminish as well.

Tropical Storm Dalila Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042025
300 AM CST Sat Jun 14 2025
 
Dalila has become better organized early this morning, with the 
latest satellite images showing well defined convective banding 
around the low-level center. The latest subjective Dvorak intensity 
estimates from TAFB and SAB were T3.5/55 knots and T3.0/45 knots. 
Objective estimates ranged from 34 to 43 knots, while a recent ASCAT 
pass showed several wind barbs close to 40 kt. Based on a blend of 
these data and taking into account the potential for some 
under-sampling in ASCAT, the initial intensity for this advisory has 
been increased to 45 knots.
 
Dalila is heading toward the northwest, or 305/10 knots. A turn
toward the west-northwest is expected later today as the system
moves along the southern periphery of a building mid-level ridge
over northern Mexico and the southwest U.S. A gradual turn toward
the west is expected tonight and Sunday, as Dalila moves over cooler
water and becomes increasingly steered by the low-level trade wind
flow. A westward motion is then forecast to continue through
dissipation Monday night, and this may be generous as Dalila may not
survive that long. The track forecast lies nearly on top of the
previous track and is in close agreement with the latest consensus
guidance.
 
There is a limited window for Dalila to strengthen as it will remain
over warm water and light to moderate effective easterly shear
today. The forecast calls for some strengthening today, and the peak
intensity was nudged slightly higher to better align with the latest
intensity model trends. Beginning tonight the system will cross the
26C isotherm and over progressively cooler water, and this is
expected to begin the weakening phase with Dalila forecast to become
a post-tropical remnant low Sunday night, and possibly sooner than
that. The latest intensity forecast close to the middle of the
intensity guidance envelope through the forecast period.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. The outer bands of Tropical Storm Dalila will bring locally heavy
rainfall to the Mexican states of Guerrero, MichoacÃ¡n, and Colima
through Sunday morning. Scattered areas of flooding and mudslides
are expected, especially in areas of steep terrain near the coast.
 
2. Dalila is expected to produce tropical-storm-force winds across
portions of the warning area tonight and Saturday.

Mesoscale Discussion 1275
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0343 PM CDT Fri Jun 13 2025

Areas affected...Northern Virginia...Maryland...and the D.C. Metro

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 132043Z - 132315Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm chances will continue to increase through
early this evening across portions of northern VA and MD. A threat
of localized damaging wind gusts exceeding 60 mph appears possible.

DISCUSSION...The latest visible satellite and radar imagery suggest
moist convection is beginning to deepen near a stationary boundary
draped west to east across northern VA and central MD, with ongoing
thunderstorms beginning to move eastward off the higher terrain.
This boundary will remain a focus for thunderstorm development
through early this evening as a very subtle mid-level shortwave
perturbation approaches from the west, although thunderstorm
coverage should generally remain at or below 40%. Daytime heating
this afternoon, combined with a moist boundary layer, are
contributing to a north-to-south axis of low to moderate instability
nudging into the DC Metro. Although weaker flow aloft should limit
overall thunderstorm organization, steep low-level lapse rates of
8-8.5 C/km and DCAPE ~1300 J/kg could support an isolated damaging
downburst or two. Given the isolated nature of the threat, a severe
weather watch is not expected at this time.

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Several outflow-dominant thunderstorm clusters may develop
across the region this afternoon/evening. Damaging gusts are the
primary risk with this activity.

DISCUSSION...Cumulus continues to build across the high terrain from
southern CO through central NM, with a few instances of lightning
observed as well. Despite large-scale ridging, thunderstorm coverage
is expected to gradually increase amid persistent southwesterly flow
aloft and related weak ascent. The airmass downstream across the
southern High Plains is deeply mixed, with LCLs from 10 to 12 kft,
and only weakly buoyant. As such, the expectation is for storms to
quickly become outflow-dominant when the move off the terrain over
the next few hours. Outflow interactions could lead to one or more
forward-propagating clusters, any of which could produce strong to
severe wind gusts. Severe coverage will likely remain isolated, and
the need for a watch is uncertain. Overall convective trends will be
monitored closely.

Farther east across western portions of the TX South Plains, an area
of deepening cumulus has been noted. Convective inhibition has
largely eroded in this area, and there is some chance an isolated
storm develops. However, given the significant dry air present,
there is a low-probability for sustained deep convection in the
near-term.

Tropical Storm Dalila Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042025
300 PM CST Fri Jun 13 2025
 
Satellite images and recent ASCAT data show that Dalila is a large 
tropical storm with its 34-kt wind radii spread out over a broad 
area, especially east of the center. The ASCAT passes showed 
tropical-storm-force winds occurring very near the coast of southern 
Mexico, which are likely aided by the local terrain. The initial 
intensity of the storm remains 35 kt based on the aforementioned 
ASCAT data and a Dvorak estimate from TAFB. Dalila is the second 
earliest fourth named storm in the eastern Pacific basin since 
records began in 1949, behind 1956.
 
Dalila likely will strengthen during the next day or so while it 
remains over warm waters and in a low to moderate wind shear 
environment. However, rapid intensification is not expected given 
the large size of the storm's wind field and the lack of an inner 
core. The opportunity for strengthening should end by late Saturday 
when Dalila is expected to cross the 26 C SST isotherm. Thereafter, 
a combination of cool waters and stable air should cause rapid 
weakening, and Dalila is now forecast to become a post-tropical 
cyclone by late Sunday. The NHC intensity forecast is similar to the 
previous one and near the high end of the model guidance.
 
The storm is still moving north-northwestward at about 12 kt. A 
gradual turn to the northwest and then the west is expected over the 
next few days as Dalila moves on the south side of a building 
mid-level ridge. There is high confidence that the center of the 
system should stay off the coast of Mexico, but the northern extent 
of the tropical-storm-force winds are expected to brush the 
southwestern coast of Mexico tonight and Saturday. The NHC track 
forecast is a touch north of the previous one and near the middle of 
the guidance envelope.
 

KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. The outer bands of Tropical Storm Dalila could bring locally
heavy rainfall to the Mexican states of Guerrero, MichoacÃ¡n, and
Colima through this weekend. Isolated flooding and mudslides,
especially in areas of steep terrain, are possible.
 
2. Dalila is expected to produce tropical-storm-force winds across 
portions of the warning area tonight and Saturday.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 412
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
200 PM MDT Fri Jun 13 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Northeast Colorado
  Western Nebraska
  Extreme southwest South Dakota
  Eastern Wyoming

* Effective this Friday afternoon and evening from 200 PM until
  1000 PM MDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds likely with isolated significant gusts
    to 75 mph possible
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
    inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms are expected to form and spread east of the
higher terrain, with the potential for clustering/upscale growth by
this evening.  Large hail will be possible with the initial, more
cellular storms (especially across northeast Wyoming where a
supercell or two will be possible).  However, severe outflow gusts
of 60-75 mph will become the main threat later this evening as storm
clusters spread east-southeastward over the High Plains.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 60
statute miles east and west of a line from 50 miles north northwest
of Gillette WY to 15 miles southeast of Akron CO. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU2).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 411...

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 65 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
28020.

  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2.5
    inches in diameter likely
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 75
    mph possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Supercell development is expected this afternoon into
central Montana and storms will spread eastward through late
evening.  Large hail up to 2.5 inches in diameter will be a primary
threat, along with thunderstorm outflow gusts of 60-75 mph.  There
is also a low threat for an isolated tornado or two.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 115
statute miles east and west of a line from 70 miles north of
Lewistown MT to 60 miles south southeast of Billings MT. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU1).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

Potential Tropical Cyclone Four-E Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042025
300 AM CST Fri Jun 13 2025

Satellite imagery and scatterometer data indicate that the 
disturbance is gradually becoming better organized, with the 
convective banding increasing and the circulation becoming better 
defined. However, the system does not yet have either enough 
organized convection or a sufficiently well-defined circulation to 
be considered a tropical cyclone.  The scatterometer data showed 
25-30 kt winds about 120 n mi south and southeast of the center, so 
the initial intensity remains 30 kt.

The initial motion is a somewhat uncertain 335/8 kt.  Satellite 
imagery shows that the depression is currently south of a mid- to 
upper-level trough over Texas and northern Mexico and southeast of 
a mid- to upper-level ridge over Baja California and the adjacent 
Pacific.  The dynamical models forecast that the trough will weaken 
and move eastward during the next 2-3 days, with the ridge building 
eastward to the north of the system.  This evolution should cause 
the disturbance to turn northwestward later today, followed by a 
west-northwestward and westward motion later in the forecast period. 
The forecast guidance is in good agreement with this scenario, and 
the new forecast track is close to the various consensus models and 
just a little north of the previous track. There is a possibility 
of erratic motion today as the system gets better organized, and 
this may affect how close the system will come to the coast of 
Mexico.

The forecast track keeps the system over warm sea surface 
temperatures for the next 36-48 h.  However, a combination of the 
broad structure and moderate easterly vertical wind shear is likely 
to slow the development.  The new intensity guidance is a little 
lower than for the previous forecast, and the forecast peak 
intensity of 60 kt is near the high end of the guidance envelope.  
After 48 h, cooler waters and drier mid-level air will lead to 
steady weakening, and the system is forecast to dissipate
by 120 h.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. The outer bands of Potential Tropical Cyclone Four-E may bring 
locally heavy rainfall to the Mexican states of Guerrero, MichoacÃ¡n, 
and Colima through this weekend. Isolated flooding and mudslides, 
especially in areas of steep terrain, are possible.
 
2. The disturbance is forecast to be at tropical storm strength when
it moves near the southwestern coast of Mexico on Saturday. Tropical
storm conditions are possible over portions of that area.

Mesoscale Discussion 1264
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0357 PM CDT Thu Jun 12 2025

Areas affected...central/eastern Pennsylvania...portions of northern
New Jersey

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 122057Z - 122300Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Conditional risk for severe hail and wind possible this
afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorm development is possible across portions of
central PA this afternoon near the southward moving cold front.
Visible satellite shows deepening cumulus across the area, with a
few echos now on radar, as MLCIN has eroded over the last few hours.
MLCAPE around 500-1000 J/kg is in place with deep layer shear around
40 kts. Should thunderstorm development occur along the front, a
supercell or two could be possible with potential for damaging wind
and hail.  This threat will be monitored for watch potential.

Mesoscale Discussion 1263
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0345 PM CDT Thu Jun 12 2025

Areas affected...portions of deep south Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 122045Z - 122145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Marginal risk for severe wind through the afternoon.

DISCUSSION...A broken line of storms continues across deep south
Texas, producing occasional gusts 40-50 mph. Outflow has largely
moved out ahead of the storms on the western flank. However,
portions of the line moving through Corpus Christi appear to be more
aligned with the outflow. This will gradually shift offshore in the
next hour. Agitated cumulus can be seen on visible in the vicinity
of the southward moving outflow. Additional storms my develop along
the boundary with potential for gusty winds. Overall, the temporal
and limited spatial area of the threat will preclude the need for
watch issuance.

Mesoscale Discussion 1262
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0319 PM CDT Thu Jun 12 2025

Areas affected...Northern NE...Southern SD

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 122019Z - 122215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms capable of large hail and damaging gusts are
possible across northern NE and southern SD this afternoon and
evening.

DISCUSSION...Convective initiation is underway along a modest
frontal boundary that extends from east-central SD through the NE
Panhandle to a low over southeast WY. Despite lingering mid-level
warm air, strong diurnal heating has largely eroded any convective
inhibition, and low-level convergence along the boundary has
fostered deepening cumulus (and at least one storm capable of
lightning). Expectation is for thunderstorm coverage to increase
within a narrow corridor along this boundary. Wind profiles, which
are characterized by low-level south-southeasterlies and
mid/upper-level westerlies, support the potential for supercells
initially capable of large hail. The thermodynamic profiles become
more conducive for strong outflow with western extent, and there is
some potential for outflow-dominant storms to progress southward (or
even southwestward) into more of north-central NE. Overall severe
coverage is expected to be high enough to merit watch issuance.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0304 PM CDT Thu Jun 12 2025

Areas affected...South-Central/Southeast WY...NE
Panhandle...Northeast/East-Central CO

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 122004Z - 122200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms are expected to evolve into one or more
convective lines capable of damaging gusts over the next several
hours. Some isolated hail is possible as well.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorm coverage continues to increase across the
higher terrain of south-central WY and north-central CO, supported
by large-scale ascent attendant to an approaching shortwave trough.
Persisting westerly flow aloft should result in these storms
eventually moving off the terrain into the High Plains, where strong
heating has resulted in a deeply mixed and modest buoyant airmass.
Expectation is for storms to evolve into one or more
outflow-dominant convective lines over the next few hours, with an
associated threat for damaging gusts. Some isolated hail is also
possible, particularly if storms can maintain a more cellular mode.
This appears most likely across southeast WY in the vicinity of a
weak surface low. Uncertainty regarding the coverage of severe
limits forecast confidence, but convective trends will be monitored
closely.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 410
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
255 PM MDT Thu Jun 12 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Northeast Colorado
  Western and Northern Nebraska
  Southern South Dakota
  Southeast Wyoming

* Effective this Thursday afternoon and evening from 255 PM until
  1100 PM MDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2.5
    inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Severe thunderstorms are expected to continue to develop
regionally mainly near a southwest/northeast-oriented front, with an
unstable air mass and moderately strong wind profiles supporting
supercells and hail/wind potential, and possibly even a brief
tornado.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 75
statute miles north and south of a line from 40 miles east southeast
of Chamberlain SD to 75 miles south southwest of Torrington WY. For

Potential Tropical Cyclone Four-E Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042025
300 PM CST Thu Jun 12 2025
 
Showers and thunderstorms associated with an area of low pressure
located south of Mexico, that the National Hurricane Center has been
monitoring have increased and are showing signs of organization.
While some mid-level rotation is evident in visible satellite images
near the northeast edge of ongoing convection, the low-level
circulation remains broad and elongated. However, the system is
expected to become a tropical storm tonight or tomorrow, and it is
possible that it will bring tropical storm conditions to land areas
within the next 36 to 48 hours. Therefore, the National Hurricane
Center is initiating Potential Tropical Cyclone advisories for this
disturbance.
 
The initial motion is more uncertain than normal since the system is 
still in the formative stage, but the best estimate is 
west-northwestward at about 6 kt. A northwestward to 
west-northwestward motion is anticipated during the next few days as 
the system moves parallel to the coast of southwestern Mexico, being 
steered by a mid-level ridge. Model guidance is in fairly good 
agreement with the overall track evolution, although minor track 
shifts may cause greater impacts to the coast of Mexico. The NHC 
forecast lies near the simple consensus aids. Since the disturbance 
currently lacks a well-defined center, users are reminded that the 
track forecast uncertainty is typically larger in these situations, 
and future track adjustments may be required.
 
The models suggest a more well-defined center should develop 
overnight or tomorrow. Once the system becomes better organized and 
develops an inner core, the environmental conditions appear 
favorable for strengthening during the next couple of days, with 
warm sea surface temperatures and abundant moisture. However, the 
system will be dealing with some easterly to northeasterly wind 
shear. The NHC forecast shows steady strengthening over the next few 
days, although there are some guidance aids such as HCCA and the 
hurricane regional models that lie above the current NHC forecast. 
Given some uncertainty in how quickly the system consolidates and 
the limiting wind shear, the NHC forecast lies near the simple 
intensity consensus aids. Beyond day 4, environmental conditions 
will become hostile which should lead to weakening, and the system 
should struggle to produce convection moving into cooler SSTs and a 
more stable air mass. The current NHC forecast has the system 
becoming a remnant low at that time, and calls for dissipation by 
day 5.
 
Based on the NHC forecast, Tropical Storm Watches have been issued
for portions of southwestern Mexico.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. The outer bands of Potential Tropical Cyclone Four-E may bring 
locally heavy rainfall to the Mexican states of Guerrero, Michoacan, 
and Colima through this weekend. Isolated flooding and mudslides, 
especially in areas of steep terrain, are possible.
 
2. The disturbance is forecast to be at tropical storm strength when 
it moves near the southwestern coast of Mexico on Saturday. Tropical 
storm conditions are possible over portions of that area.

Mesoscale Discussion 1251
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0239 PM CDT Wed Jun 11 2025

Areas affected...Northeast TX into western LA and far southwest AR

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 111939Z - 112145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Gusty winds are possible the remainder of the afternoon as
a line of storms tracks northeast across the ArkLaTex vicinity.

DISCUSSION...A line of storms has maintained organization along
surging outflow as convection moves through a corridor of weak to
moderate instability this afternoon. Some embedded stronger cells
within this line are likely aided by 25-30 kt effective shear
magnitudes within the unstable airmass.  Precipitable water values
near 2 inches may further aid in sporadic wet microbursts, and
locally strong gusts will be possible the remainder of the
afternoon. Overall severe potential is expected to remain limited,
and a watch is not expected at this time.

Mesoscale Discussion 1250
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0156 PM CDT Wed Jun 11 2025

Areas affected...northern Iowa...southern Minnesota

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 111856Z - 112130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Severe wind and hail risk to continue through the
afternoon/early evening.

DISCUSSION...A broken line of thunderstorm activity that has a
history of producing 50-60 mph winds continues to show winds around
50-60 mph around 2kft on radar. Additional development is also noted
on visible satellite on the southern periphery of this broken line.
Some uncertainty remains on the duration of this wind threat, given
the downstream air mass is fairly mixed and less unstable. Steep
lapse rates and dew point depressions in the 30s to 40s may support
strong to severe gusts with outflow as these storms advance
eastward. 

Additional thunderstorm development is expected later on in the
afternoon with the ejecting wave, which may be supercellular with
potential for damaging wind/hail. As this may be the time period of
more appreciable threat, watch timing remains uncertain. However,
should the broken line advancing east out of SD continue to
intensify, a watch may be needed to cover this threat in the near
term.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Cosme Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032025
800 AM MST Wed Jun 11 2025
 
Drier mid-level air and stable atmospheric conditions have taken 
their toll on Cosme. The system has been devoid of deep convection 
for more than 12 hours, with only a swirl of low- to mid-level 
clouds evident on satellite imagery. The initial intensity has 
been lowered to 30 kt. Given the hostile environment and ongoing 
lack of convection, Cosme is not expected to redevelop, and this 
will be the final advisory.

The low is now moving toward the east-northeast at about 070/6 kt. 
Global model guidance indicates a gradual turn toward the 
north-northeast later today, followed by a turn to the north on 
Thursday, as the system steadily spins down and dissipates over the 
next day or so.

For additional information on the remnant low please see High Seas
Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under AWIPS
header NFDHSFEPI, WMO header FZPN02 KWBC, and on the web at
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFEPI.php

Tropical Storm Cosme Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032025
200 AM MST Wed Jun 11 2025
 
Drier mid-level air and stable atmospheric conditions have taken
their toll on Cosme. The system has been devoid of deep convection
for several hours and is expected to become a remnant low later this
morning. Dvorak intensity estimates continue to decrease
accordingly. A 11/0442 UTC ASCAT pass showed winds in the 35-40 kt
range in the southern semicircle. Assuming additional weakening
after that time, the initial intensity is set at 35 kt.  After
transitioning to a remnant low later this morning, Cosme is expected
to dissipate by late Thursday or Friday.
 
The storm is now moving slowly toward the northeast. A gradual turn
to the north-northeast with some acceleration is expected later
today, followed by a turn to the north on Thursday. Only a slight
eastward adjustment was made to the previous NHC track forecast,
with no significant changes to the intensity forecast.

Mesoscale Discussion 1243
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0350 PM CDT Tue Jun 10 2025

Areas affected...Far Northern CA...Southern/Eastern OR

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 102050Z - 102315Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated hail and/or damaging gusts are possible from far
northern CA into southern and eastern OR this afternoon and evening.

DISCUSSION...Visible satellite imagery shows increasing coverage of
deep cumulus across the higher terrain of far northeast CA and
south-central OR, with several instances of convective initiation.
Some additional increase in storm coverage is anticipated as
southwesterly flow and large-scale ascent gradually strengthen.
Isolated hail could occur with this early-stage cellular convection.
A deeply mixed airmass exists downstream, and the general
expectation is for damaging gusts as the storms become more outflow
dominant as they move off the terrain over the next few hours.

Tropical Storm Barbara Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022025
200 PM MST Tue Jun 10 2025
 
This afternoon's satellite presentation shows Barbara quickly
spinning down.  Deep convection associated with the cyclone has
diminished considerably during the past few hours and has revealed
an exposed surface circulation well to the northeast of a 
mid-level center.  The initial intensity is once again lowered, to 
35 kt, and is based on a blend of the various subjective and 
objective satellite intensity estimates.

Based on current convective trends and the global models, Barbara 
should become a remnant low later tonight while it continues moving 
over cooler waters and into a harsh atmospheric environment. 
 
Barbara has been moving to the right of track within the peripheral
steering flow of the low- to mid-level high anchored over central
Mexico.  Consequently, the initial motion is estimated to be
northward or 010/7 kt.  Barbara should continue this general motion
through dissipation on Wednesday.  The official track forecast
is adjusted to the right of the previous advisory and lies close to 
the ECMWF and TVCE consensus models.

Tropical Storm Cosme Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032025
200 PM PDT Tue Jun 10 2025
 
Although Cosme's low-level center is obscured by high-level cirrus, 
it does appear to be displaced a bit to the northeast of the 
remaining deep convection.  Satellite intensity estimates have 
continued to decrease, with objective numbers ranging between 35-45 
kt, and subjective Dvorak CI numbers between 45-55 kt.  The advisory 
intensity is set at 45 kt based on a blend of these numbers.  An 
earlier ASCAT pass showed winds just over 40 kt in the southwestern 
quadrant, but the southeastern quadrant, where there could be 
stronger winds, was not sampled.

ASCAT and recent visible imagery suggest Cosme's center is a little 
west of where it was placed this morning.  Still, the storm has 
turned north-northwestward with an initial motion of 330/3 kt.  
Cosme is expected to turn northward and then northeastward and 
speed up a bit through Wednesday, before turning back to the 
north-northwest on Thursday.  This track will take Cosme over 
progressively cooler waters and into a drier, more stable 
environment.  Combined with moderate-to-strong northeasterly shear, 
these conditions should cause quick weakening, and GFS- and 
ECWMF-based simulated satellite images suggest that Cosme will lose 
its deep convection overnight.  As a result, the NHC official 
forecast shows Cosme becoming a remnant low within 24 hours, with 
dissipation now expected by 60 hours.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 406
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
145 PM CDT Tue Jun 10 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Southeast New Mexico
  Far West int West Texas

* Effective this Tuesday afternoon and evening from 145 PM until
  900 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2.5
    inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm coverage is expected to increase over the
next few hours as the airmass continues to destabilize. Steep
mid-level lapse rates and moderate deep-layer shear will support
supercells, with large to very large hail as the primary hazard.
Over time, upscale growth into a convective line is possible, with
this line then progressing southeastward into more of west Texas.
Damaging gusts are the primary risk once this linear transition
occurs.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 110
statute miles east and west of a line from 35 miles northeast of
Carlsbad NM to 70 miles southwest of Dryden TX. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU6).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
27030.

...Mosier

Tropical Storm Cosme Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032025
200 AM MST Tue Jun 10 2025

The convective appearance of Cosme has changed little since the 
previous advisory.  The latest subjective Dvorak estimates from 
TAFB and SAB range from 55-65 kt, and the latest objective 
intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS range from 54-59 kt.  The initial 
intensity is held at 60 kt for this advisory, based on a blend of 
the intensity estimates.

Cosme continues to move very slowly toward the northwest, with 
motion estimated at 300/4 kt. A slow motion, perhaps more toward 
the north, should continue for at least the next 12 h since the 
overall steering currents are weak, due to Barbara's current 
position in relation to Cosme.  However, as Barbara weakens, Cosme 
will accelerate north-northeastward in response to ridging located 
to the northwest of the cyclone. Very little change has been made 
to the NHC track forecast, and the latest forecast is near the 
various consensus models.

Cosme is forecast to remain in favorable enough conditions for the 
next 24 h such that the cyclone might be able to maintain its 
intensity or only weaken very slowly.  However, after that time, as 
Cosme gains latitude, it will encounter cooler water and drier air. 
Cosme is forecast to lose its convection and become post-tropical on 
Wednesday, in agreement with the GFS and ECMWF simulated satellite 
imagery products.  The post-tropical low is then forecast to 
gradually weaken and dissipate by 72 h.  The NHC intensity forecast 
is similar to the previous one, and is near the middle of the 
guidance envelope.

Tropical Storm Barbara Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022025
200 AM MST Tue Jun 10 2025

Barbara has lost a significant portion of its convection over the 
past 12 hours or so.  The latest current intensity estimates from 
TAFB and SAB are still in the 55-65 kt range, but the latest 
objective intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS are in the 45-55 kt 
range.  Based on the degraded convective appearance on geostationary 
satellite imagery and the latest intensity estimates, the initial 
intensity is set to 50 kt.

Barbara has been moving toward the northwest a little slower than 
before, or 310/7 kt.  Barbara is forecast to continue moving 
generally toward the northwest as it is steered by weak ridging to 
its north and Tropical Storm Cosme, located to its southwest.  Only 
very minor adjustments have been made to the previous NHC track 
forecast, which lies near the various consensus models.

The storm already has crossed the 26C isotherm and will continue 
moving over progressively colder water over the next day.  The cold 
water will cause Barbara to continue weakening.  The NHC intensity 
forecast shows a slightly faster rate of weakening than the previous 
official forecast, and is near the latest intensity model consensus. 
 The GFS and ECMWF simulated satellite products both show the 
cyclone losing its convection entirely by about 24 hours, with 
dissipation in 36 hours.  The NHC forecast follows the scenario 
depicted by those models.

...BARBARA CONTINUES TO WEAKEN OFFSHORE OF WEST-CENTRAL MEXICO...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 200 AM MST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...19.1N 108.1W
ABOUT 180 MI...290 KM WSW OF CABO CORRIENTES MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...60 MPH...95 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 310 DEGREES AT 8 MPH...13 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...999 MB...29.50 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM MST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Barbara was
located near latitude 19.1 North, longitude 108.1 West. Barbara is
moving toward the northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h) and this general 
motion is expected to continue for the next day or so.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 60 mph (95 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Continued weakening is forecast, and Barbara is 
expected to dissipate by Wednesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Barbara will affect portions of the coast
of southwestern and west-central Mexico, as well as the southernmost
portions of Baja California through today. These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Mesoscale Discussion 1228
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0351 PM CDT Mon Jun 09 2025

Areas affected...eastern Ohio...western Pennsylvania...far West
Virginia...far southwestern New York

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 401...

Valid 092051Z - 092145Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 401
continues.

SUMMARY...Severe threat continues within WW401.

DISCUSSION...Several broken segments of multi-cell clusters continue
across WW401. A few instances of wind damage have been reported
across northern PA and southern OH. A few cells have initiated out
head of the main clusters but have struggle to maintain intensity.
Ahead of the line, temperatures continue to warm, with MLCAPE around
500 J/kg slowly advecting northward across New York state. As
forcing for ascent continues to increase with the approaching wave,
thunderstorm coverage will continue to increase. Damaging wind and
severe hail continue to be a possibility with stronger cells.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 401
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
245 PM EDT Mon Jun 9 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Far Southwest New York
  Central and Eastern Ohio
  Western Pennsylvania
  Northern West Virginia
  Lake Erie

* Effective this Monday afternoon and evening from 245 PM until
  1000 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm coverage is expected to increase across the
region this afternoon and evening, with multiple rounds of storms
possible. Bowing line segments capable of damaging gusts are the
primary risk, but isolated hail may occur as well.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 90
statute miles east and west of a line from 25 miles east northeast
of Jamestown NY to 35 miles south southeast of Parkersburg WV. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU1).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
24035.

...Mosier

Hurricane Barbara Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022025
200 PM MST Mon Jun 09 2025
 
Since the last advisory Barbara has become a little less organized. 
Latest GOES satellite imagery depicts the system starting to ingest 
some drier air which has caused fragmented banding. However, a 
central dense overcast has remained over the tiny inner core. The 
satellite intensity estimates have decreased slightly from the 
previous advisory ranging from 50 to 65 kt. Using these estimates, 
the intensity is held at 65 kt, although this may be generous.

A mid-level ridge located over Mexico should continue to steer the 
system northwestward over the next couple of days. As Barbara begins 
to weaken into a shallow vortex and slow down, it will be steered by 
the low-level wind flow. The latest NHC track forecast is similar to 
the previous one, and close to the simple and corrected consensus.
 
Barbara likely has peaked as a short-lived hurricane. The 
environmental conditions will becoming increasingly hostile along 
the forecast track with the storm crossing into cooler SSTs and into 
a drier, more stable air mass. This will cause the system to 
steadily weaken, lose convective organization, and become post 
tropical by 36 h. The latest NHC forecast shows the system opening 
into a trough by 60 h and dissipating.

Tropical Storm Cosme Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032025
200 PM MST Mon Jun 09 2025
 
Cosme continues to intensify and is nearing hurricane strength.
Visible satellite images show that the convective bands have
consolidated near the center, and there is some evidence of a
partial inner core. A blend of the latest objective and subjective
satellite intensity estimates support increasing the initial
intensity to 60 kt. A partial ASCAT pass indicates that the
wind field of Cosme is quite compact, and the initial wind radii
have been updated based on that data.
 
Some additional strengthening is possible in the short term, and
Cosme could become a hurricane tonight while it remains in 
generally conducive environmental conditions. However, the 
combination of decreasing SSTs and intrusions of dry/stable air
should end the strengthening trend by early Tuesday and then cause a
quick weakening. Simulated satellite images from the GFS and ECMWF
models show deep convection vanishing by Wednesday, and based on
that guidance, the transition to a remnant low has been moved up to
48 hours. Dissipation is likely to occur in 3 to 4 days.
 
The storm is moving northwestward at 8 kt, and this general motion
should continue through tonight. After that time, a turn to the
north or north-northeast is expected as Cosme moves toward a
weakness left behind by Hurricane Barbara to its northeast.  The
NHC track forecast is in fair agreement with the consensus aids.

...Severe thunderstorms expected over parts of the southern Plains
this evening and overnight...

* LOCATIONS...
  North Texas
  Southern Oklahoma

* HAZARDS...
  Widespread damaging winds, some hurricane force
  A couple of tornadoes
  Scattered large hail, some baseball size

* SUMMARY...
  A few tornadoes, destructive wind gusts up to 80-100 mph, and
  large to very large hail remain likely across parts of the

Preparedness actions...

Review your severe weather safety procedures for the possibility
of dangerous weather today. Stay tuned to NOAA Weather Radio,
weather.gov, or other media for watches and warnings. A watch
means that conditions are favorable for severe thunderstorms
over the next several hours. If a severe thunderstorm warning is
issued for your area, move to a place of safety, ideally in an 
interior room on the lowest floor of a sturdy building.

Tropical Storm Barbara Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022025
200 AM MST Mon Jun 09 2025
 
Barbara has become a bit better organized over the past 6 hours 
with a large central dense overcast and an increasing area of 
cloud tops in the -75C to -85C range.  The latest subjective Dvorak 
estimates from TAFB and SAB range from 55-65 kt, and the latest 
objective intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS range from 46-68 kt.  
Based on the improved banding and cold cloud tops, as well as the 
persistence of this organization, the initial intensity is 
increased to 60 kt for this advisory.

There is some uncertainty in the initial position since there have 
been no recent available microwave passes, but the best motion 
estimate is west-northwestward, or 295 degrees at 10 kt.  The 
global models show a strong 500 mb ridge to the north of Barbara, 
which should help maintain Barbara on a general path toward the 
west-northwest for the next few days.  The GFS model continues 
to be the fastest and farthest left model.  The GFS appears to 
have a more realistic solution compared to the ECMWF, and was 
stronger at the initialization time.  The new NHC forecast is 
slightly faster and a bit to the left of the previous official 
forecast and is in fairly good agreement with an average of the 
simple and corrected consensus models.

Barbara only has about 12 more hours to strengthen before it starts 
moving into cooler waters.  This should be enough time for Barbara 
to strengthen to a hurricane.  The cooler water should cause 
weakening to begin tonight or on Tuesday.  The dynamical hurricane 
models and global models all show Barbara weakening below tropical 
storm strength by 48 hours, and the cyclone is likely to lose its 
convection and become a remnant low around that time.  The new NHC 
forecast shows a faster weakening and quicker dissipation than the 
previous official forecast since the dynamical guidance is now in 
good agreement on this scenario.

Tropical Storm Cosme Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032025
200 AM MST Mon Jun 09 2025
 
The satellite presentation of Cosme has continued to gradually 
improve since the previous advisory, with sustained deep convection 
holding over the low-level center. A timely 09/0524Z ASCAT pass 
helped with the initial intensity and 34 kt wind radii estimates, 
with several wind barbs showing 40 to 45 knot winds. The latest 
subjective Dvorak intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB were T3.0/45 
knots and T2.5/35 knots respectively. Meanwhile, the objective 
Dvorak satellite estimates range from 40 to 50 knots. The initial 
intensity has been adjusted up to 45 knots with this advisory 
package, in line with the most recent ASCAT pass.

Cosme is moving toward west-northwest at 8 kt. This general motion 
is expected to continue during the next 24 hours to the south of a 
mid-level ridge, with a gradual slowing in forward speed. Tonight 
and Tuesday Barbara is forecast to erode the mid-level ridge to the 
north of Cosme, resulting in a further slowing in motion and a shift 
to the north. An increase in forward speed and a motion to the 
north-northeast is expected Tuesday night, with Cosme forecast to 
become a post-tropical remnant low on Wednesday. The latest track 
forecast is very close to that of the previous advisory and is 
generally a blend of the consensus guidance.

Environmental conditions continue to look conducive for 
strengthening of Cosme during the next 24 hours or so. Vertical wind 
shear will lighten up some while the system passes over 27/28C water 
with abundant deep layer moisture. The intensity forecast is similar 
to the previous advisory, bringing Cosme close to hurricane strength 
late today or tonight. Beyond 24 hours, vertical wind shear is 
forecast to increase and mid-level moisture is forecast to decrease, 
which should lead to a gradual weakening of Cosme. A more rapid 
weakening is then expected by Wednesday as the system moves over 
much cooler water, with Cosme expected to dissipate by 96 hours.

Mesoscale Discussion 1205
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0350 PM CDT Sun Jun 08 2025

Areas affected...portions of eastern Colorado and New Mexico

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 082050Z - 082245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Large hail and severe wind threat possible this afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorm development has been ongoing across the
Front Range in Colorado and across northeastern New Mexico. The air
mass across Colorado remains under the influence of MLCIN, with
temperatures cooling with northern extend behind the surface cold
front. Moisture is also somewhat limited, with dew points in the
upper 40s to 50s. A few instances of severe hail will be possible.

Across eastern New Mexico near the dryline, a gradient of more
appreciable MLCAPE 500-1500 j/kg is in place along with deep layer
shear around 30-45 kts. Temperatures are in the mid 70s to 80s amid
dew points in the 50s to upper 60s. This may support some instances
of severe wind and hail, with at least one supercell noted on radar.
Trends will be monitored for watch potential, but it appears
unlikely at this time.

Mesoscale Discussion 1204
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0331 PM CDT Sun Jun 08 2025

Areas affected...Portions of northern/central VA and MD

Concerning...Tornado Watch 392...

Valid 082031Z - 082200Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 392 continues.

SUMMARY...A risk for tornadoes and damaging wind gusts will persist
into early evening across northern/central Virginia, and portions of
Maryland.

DISCUSSION...Isolated storms are ongoing closer to a surface
boundary across eastern VA, and further west across the higher
terrain of central VA. These storms will continue to shift east
across a moderately unstable airmass and within 30-40 kt effective
shear. A surface boundary extending from northern VA southeast into
southeast VA will continue to support a corridor of enhanced
low-level shear supporting storm rotation. A couple tornadoes and
damaging gusts will remain possible over the next few hours.

0330 PM CDT Sun Jun 08 2025

Areas affected...portions of western Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 082030Z - 082230Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Large hail and severe wind threat may increase through the
afternoon/early evening.

DISCUSSION...Supercells have developed across the Davis Mountains in
far western Texas this afternoon. The environment in this region is
characterized by MLCAPE around 500-1500 J/kg, steep lapse rates, and
deep layer shear around 40-45 kts. This will support potential for
supercells to produce some instances of large to very large hail and
severe winds. MLCIN does increase with eastward extent, which may
limit coverage/duration of this threat. This area will be monitored
for watch potential.

Mesoscale Discussion 1202
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0317 PM CDT Sun Jun 08 2025

Areas affected...portions of southwestern and north-central
Texas...southwestern Oklahoma

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 082017Z - 082215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Large hail/tornado threat to increase through the
afternoon before a more significant wind threat emerges.

DISCUSSION...Supercell thunderstorms are ongoing across portions of
the Oklahoma and Texas Panhandles as of this hour, with at least one
tornado reported in Cimarron/Dallam counties. Additional development
is ongoing west of Amarillo. It is likely some mix of supercell
clusters will advance south and eastward through time, with
potential for additional development to occur ahead of the dryline
in New Mexico.

Low-level shear improves with southward extent into Lubbock where
surface winds are backed southeasterly improving low-level curvature
of hodographs and streamwise vorticity. It is likely that as storms
develop and move southward, the tornado threat will increase through
time even with the shifting storm mode.

A sharp gradient of extreme MLCAPE exists along the Red River near
the Texas/Oklahoma border into north-central Texas amid steep low to
mid-level lapse rates. As upscale growth increases, the potential
will rapidly increase for destructive winds (80-100 mph). A Tornado
or PDS Severe Watch is likely needed to cover this potential.

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Southwest Oklahoma
  Western North Texas and Low Rolling Plains

* Effective this Sunday afternoon and evening from 400 PM until
  1100 PM CDT.

...THIS IS A PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS SITUATION...

* Primary threats include...
  Widespread damaging winds and scattered significant gusts to 105
    mph likely
  Widespread large hail likely with isolated very large hail
    events to 5 inches in diameter possible
  A few tornadoes likely

SUMMARY...Increasing intense severe storm development is expected
through late afternoon into evening. This will include initial
supercells capable of very large hail with a tornado risk, but a
prominent potential for widespread damaging winds should evolve this
evening.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 70
statute miles north and south of a line from 10 miles northwest of
Lubbock TX to 40 miles southeast of Chickasha OK. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU6).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 391...WW 392...WW
393...WW 394...WW 395...

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 90 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 600. Mean storm motion vector

Tropical Storm Barbara Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022025
300 PM CST Sun Jun 08 2025
 
Deep convection continues to burst over the center of Barbara this 
afternoon, with cold cloud tops near -75 C. However, a dry slot in 
the eastern semi-circle looks to have slightly disrupted the 
convective organization. Subjective and objective intensity 
estimates range from 45-55 kt this cycle. Using a blend of satellite 
estimates and the latest imagery the intensity is held at 50 kt for 
this advisory.
 
Barbara is currently within a favorable environment with warm SSTs 
and low vertical wind shear. Strengthening is forecast over the next 
day or so, and Barbara is forecast to become a hurricane overnight. 
After 24 h, the system will be moving over cooler sea surface 
temperatures below 26C and into a drier mid-level environment. These 
factors will cause the storm to weaken and eventually struggle to 
produce convection. Latest model IR simulated satellite imagery 
shows the system losing convection by 72 h.  This suggests that 
it will become a a post-tropical remnant low by that time and 
likely dissipate  by day 5 although that could occur sooner than 
currently forecast.
 
Barbara is moving west-northwestward at 295/10, steered by 
a mid-level ridge over Mexico, and this motion should continue over 
the next couple of days. The NHC forecast was nudged slightly 
rightward and lies just left of the the simple and corrected 
consensus aids.  Given the forecast track and wind radii, 
tropical-storm-force winds are not expected to affect the 
southwestern coast of Mexico. By Tuesday, the track forecast becomes 
more complicated given the potential interaction between Barbara and 
Cosme. The GFS and ECMWF are on opposite ends of the guidance 
envelope.

Tropical Storm Cosme Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032025
200 PM MST Sun Jun 08 2025
 
Deep convection has been increasing near the center and in curved
bands on the western side of the circulation during the past
several hours. An ASCAT-C pass from a few hours ago showed peak
winds in the 35-40 kt range, and based on that data, the depression
has been upgraded to Tropical Storm Cosme with the initial
intensity set at 40 kt.
 
Cosme will likely continue to strengthen for the next day or two as
it remains in an environment of low to moderate wind shear, abundant
moisture, and over warm SSTs. The NHC intensity forecast shows a
peak of 60 kt at 24 and 36 hours, and it wouldn't be surprising if
Cosme becomes a hurricane during that time frame. By mid-week,
however, the storm is expected to move over progressively cooler
waters and into a drier airmass, which should cause the system to
begin weakening. Cosme is now forecast to become a remnant low in 3
days and dissipate in 4 days.

The storm is moving northwestward at 7 kt, and that general motion 
is expected to continue during the next couple of days.  After that 
time, the interaction with Barbara will likely result in an initial 
slow down and then turn to the northeast. There is a fair amount of 
spread in the guidance due to the complexity of this interaction.  
The NHC track forecast has been adjusted a little to the right of 
the previous one to account for the initial motion/position and to 
be in better agreement with the latest consensus aids.

Tropical Storm Barbara Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022025
300 AM CST Sun Jun 08 2025
 
Showers and thunderstorms have become better organized in 
association with an area of low pressure located offshore of 
southwestern Mexico. A small, persistent area of deep convection has 
been observed in satellite images tonight, and recent scatterometer 
data confirm this has led to the formation of a well-defined, closed 
low-level circulation. Therefore, the NHC is starting advisories on 
Tropical Storm Barbara with an initial intensity of 40 kt based on 
the earlier scatterometer winds.

Barbara is currently within a moist and relatively low shear 
environment over warm waters. So, strengthening is expected during 
the next day or so, and this could occur quickly given recent 
satellite trends and the small size of the storm. The official NHC 
forecast shows Barbara becoming a hurricane in 24 h, which is 
supported by HAFS-A/B and the HFIP corrected consensus (HCCA). The 
window for strengthening is brief, as Barbara is forecast to move 
over cooler waters and into a drier mid-level environment by 48 h. 
This should disrupt the convective structure of the storm and result 
in weakening. By day 5, the remnant low of Barbara is forecast to 
either dissipate or become absorbed by the circulation of EP91.

Barbara is moving west-northwestward (295/10 kt) on the south side 
of a mid-level ridge, and this motion should continue over the next 
couple of days. For this time period, the NHC forecast generally 
lies near or between the simple and corrected consensus aids. Given 
the forecast track and wind radii, tropical-storm-force winds 
are not expected to affect the southwestern coast of Mexico. By 
Tuesday, the track forecast becomes more complicated given the 
potential for binary interaction between Barbara and another 
disturbance (EP91) with a high chance of formation. Because of this, 
the long-range track forecast could be subject to larger future 
adjustments depending on the evolution of EP91.

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 AM CST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Barbara was 
located near latitude 15.2 North, longitude 102.4 West. Barbara is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h), and this 
motion is expected to continue for the next couple of days. A turn 
toward the west at a slower forward speed is anticipated on Tuesday.
 
Satellite-derived wind data indicate that maximum sustained winds 
are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts. Strengthening is 
forecast during the next day or so, and Barbara is forecast to 
become a hurricane on Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches, with localized amounts
up to 6 inches, are possible across portions of the Mexican states
of Guerrero, Michoacan, Colima, and Jalisco through Monday. This
rainfall may lead to areas of flooding and mudslides.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Storm Barbara, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep2.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Barbara will affect portions of the coast
of southwestern Mexico during the next few days. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
