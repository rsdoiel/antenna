voice concerns about environmental impact of wildfire rebuilding</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-10, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p>Urban planners expressed environmental concerns about Gov. Gavin
Newsom’s recent rebuilding efforts following January’s Los Angeles
County wildfires. Shortly after multiple severe wildfires broke out in
the LA area in January, Newsom announced plans to rebuild the affected
regions, including signing an executive order to clear debris quickly,
waiving California Environmental Quality Act permit requirements to
rebuild homes and businesses faster and securing federal funds to repair
damaged infrastructure.</p>
