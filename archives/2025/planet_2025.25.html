COUNCIL LIVE: Political Affairs chief hails Iran-Israel ceasefire as
‘significant achievement’</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-24, from: United Nations, Top Stories</p>
<p>The Security Council is meeting over the future of the Joint
Comprehensive Plan of Action put in place in 2015 to prevent Iran from
weaponising its ambitious nuclear programme, which has been in effective
limbo since the US withdrawal in 2018 and Iran’s rejection of parts of
the deal. UN political affairs chief Rosemary DiCarlo described the
US-brokered ceasefire overnight between Israel and Iran as a
“significant achievement” and “an opportunity to avoid a catastrophic
escalation and achieve a peaceful resolution of the Iran nuclear issue.”
