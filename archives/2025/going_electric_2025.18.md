## BYD’s new mini EV is ‘a huge threat’ to Japanese automakers and it’s coming soon

date: 2025-05-07, from: Electrek Feed

<div class="feat-image"><img src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/05/BYD-mini-EV.jpeg?quality=82&#038;strip=all&#038;w=1400" /></div><p><a href="https://electrek.co/guides/byd/">BYD</a> is already known for its smaller, low-cost electric cars like the Seagull, which you can snag for under $10,000 in China. Now, China’s EV leader is looking to go even smaller. BYD plans to launch a new mini EV, or kei car, that could pose “a huge threat” to Japanese automakers as a cheaper alternative.</p>
