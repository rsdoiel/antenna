## Trump says Dan Bongino to be FBI deputy director

date: 2025-02-24, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said in a post on social media Sunday that Dan Bongino, a conservative talk show host, will be deputy director of the FBI.


Bongino will join Kash Patel, who was recently confirmed by the Senate as director of the FBI. Trump said Bongino was named to the role by Patel. The position does not require Senate confirmation.


"Great news for Law Enforcement and American Justice!" Trump posted on his social media network, Truth Social, calling Bongino "a man of incredible love and passion for our Country."


Bongino was previously a New York City police officer, and a member of the U.S. Secret Service. He most recently had been known as a conservative radio host and podcaster.


Trump said in his post that Bongino is "prepared to give up" his program as he steps into the new role. "The Dan Bongino Show" was most recently the 56th-ranked podcast in the United States, according to Spotify.

## 'Conclave' triumphs at SAG Awards and Timothée Chalamet wins best actor, upending Oscar predictions

date: 2025-02-24, from: VOA News USA

The papal thriller "Conclave" won best ensemble and Timothée Chalamet took best actor at the 31st Screen Actors Guild Awards on Sunday, a pair of twists that added a few final wrinkles to an unusually unpredictable awards season.


In winning the guild's top award, Edward Berger's Vatican-set drama triumphed just as the Catholic Church was praying for the health of Pope Francis, who remained in critical condition Sunday after an asthmatic respiratory crisis. "Conclave" dramatizes the fictional election of a new pope. Earlier in the evening onstage, Isabella Rossellini shared the cast's best wishes for Pope Francis.


All the momentum going into the SAG Awards was with Sean Baker's "Anora," which had won with the producers, directors and writers guilds. Now, with "Conclave" winning with the actors and at the BAFTAs, what will nab best picture in a week's time at the Academy Awards is, again, anyone's guess.


"Wow," said "Conclave" star Ralph Fiennes taking the stage. "I've not been elected to speak. I've been designated to speak on behalf of our conclave, our ensemble."


That wasn't the only surprise in the ceremony held at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles and streamed lived by Netflix. Chalamet's best actor win upset "The Brutalist" star Adrien Brody and put the 29-year-old on course to possibly win his first Academy Award.


Chalamet looked visibly surprised when his name was announced at the ceremony. But once he reached the staged, the "A Complete Unknown" star spoke with composure and confidence.


"The truth is, this was 5 ½ years of my life," said Chalamet. "I poured everything I had into playing this incomparable artist, Mr. Bob Dylan, a true American hero. It was the honor of a lifetime playing him."


He then added: "The truth is, I'm really in pursuit of greatness. I know people don't usually talk like that, but I want to be one of the greats."


The other Oscar favorites — Demi Moore, Zoe Saldaña and Kieran Culkin — all won. The SAG Awards are closely watched as an Oscar preview. Their picks don't always align exactly with those of the film academy, but they often nearly do.


The last three best ensemble winners — "Oppenheimer," "Everything Everywhere All at Once" and "CODA" — all went on to win best picture at the Oscars. All but one of the SAG acting winners of the last three years has also won the Oscar. (The sole exception was Lily Gladstone, who won SAG's award for female actor last year for "Killers of the Flower Moon," but the Oscar trophy went to Emma Stone for "Poor Things".)


Moore seemingly solidified her Oscar chances by following up her Golden Globe win for her performance in "The Substance." Moore, whose campaign was boosted by her speech about being pigeonholed a "popcorn actress," has traded awards with "Anora" breakthrough Mikey Madison.


"What we believe is so much more powerful than what we think," said Moore. "The saying, 'I'll believe it when I see it' — the reality is when I believe it, I will see it."


The SAG Awards unfolded against the backdrop of the aftermath of the devastating wildfires that began in early January. Those fires forced the guild to cancel its in-person nominations announcement and launch a disaster relief fund for SAG-AFTRA members affected. Host Kristen Bell introduced attending firefighters as "the most attractive tables" among a sea of stars.


Jane Fonda, 87, given the guild's Life Achievement Award, provided the evening with its most passionately political moment. Fonda, a famed activist, spoke indirectly about President Donald Trump's administration.


"We are in our documentary moment," said Fonda. "This is it. And it's not a rehearsal."


Fonda added that "woke just means you give a damn about other people."


"A whole lot of people are going to be hurt by what's happening, by what's coming our way," said Fonda. "We are going to need a big tent to resist what's coming at us."


Jean Smart, who had advocated for canceling award shows because of the wildfires, won best female actor in a comedy series for "Hacks." Smart didn't attend, but participated in a pre-taped introduction as her character, Deborah Vance.


Also not in attendance: Martin Short, though he upset Jeremy Allen White to win best male actor in a comedy series for "Only Murders in the Building." The Hulu series also won for best comedy ensemble.


"Wait, we never win. This is so weird," said Selena Gomez. "Marty and Steve (Martin) aren't here because, you know, they don't really care."


Colin Farrell won his first SAG award, for his performance in "The Penguin" and also became the first winner ever introduced, by Jamie Lee Curtis, as "the man who gave me COVID at the Golden Globes." Farrell bounded to the stage and promptly responded, "Guilty as charged," before blaming Brendan Gleeson for giving it to him.


The night's first televised award went to Culkin, who has won just about every award in the category for "A Real Pain." Gripping the SAG trophy, he could quickly tell the difference.


"It is funny that the heaviest of all awards is given by actors," said Culkin, who characteristically riffed his way through a rambling acceptance speech before swearing sincerity: "Believe it or not, this actually means a lot to me."


Netflix's "Emilia Pérez," which has seen its awards hopes largely dashed by controversy over old tweets by lead actor Karla Sofia Gascón, took home the award for best female supporting actor, for Oscar favorite Saldaña.


For Netflix's second time around streaming the awards, it inserted ads sporadically, like a traditional broadcast. Last year, downtimes were occupied by backstage interviews. Audio issues occasionally marred the broadcast, including brief interruptions of Fonda's speech.


After romps at the Emmys and Golden Globes, "Shōgun" kept up its dominance. The FX series won best drama series ensemble, along with acting awards for Hiroyuki Sanada, Anna Sawai and for best stunt ensemble. The corresponding award for film went to the stunt performer ode "The Fall Guy."

## Kamala Harris receives prestigious Chairman's prize at NAACP Image Awards

date: 2025-02-24, from: VOA News USA

Los Angeles — Former Vice President Kamala Harris stepped on the NAACP Image Awards stage Saturday night with a sobering message, calling the civil rights organization a pillar of the Black community and urging people to stay resilient and hold onto their faith during the tenure of President Donald Trump.


"While we have no illusions about what we are up against in this chapter in our American story, this chapter will be written not simply by whoever occupies the oval office nor by the wealthiest among us," Harris said after receiving the NAACP's Chairman's Award. "The American story will be written by you. Written by us. By we the people."


The 56th annual Image Awards was held at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium in the Los Angeles area.


Harris, defeated by Trump in last year's presidential election, was the first woman and the first person of color to serve as vice president. She had previously been a U.S. senator from California and the state's attorney general.


In her first major public appearance since leaving office, Harris did not reference her election loss or Trump's actions since entering the Oval Office, although Trump mocked her earlier in the day at the Conservative Political Action Conference.


Harris spoke about eternal vigilance, the price of liberty, staying alert, seeking the truth and America's future.


"Some see the flames on our horizons, the rising waters in our cities, the shadows gathering over our democracy and ask 'What do we do now?'" Harris said. "But we know exactly what to do, because we have done it before. And we will do it again. We use our power. We organize, mobilize. We educate. We advocate. Our power has never come from having an easy path."


Other winners of the Chairman's prize have included former President Barack Obama, the late Rep. John Lewis and the late actor Ruby Dee.


NAACP Hall of Fame


Harris was honored during the ceremony along with the Wayans family. The family was inducted into the NAACP Image Awards Hall of Fame in recognition of pioneering contributions to film, TV, sketch and stand-up comedy that have shaped Hollywood for decades.


Keenen Ivory Wayans, Damon Wayans Sr., Marlon Wayans, Shawn Wayans, Kim Wayans and Damon Wayans Jr. each were recognized.


Marlon Wayans, whose guest appearance on Peacock's "Bel-Air" was up for an NAACP award, shared how Keenen Ivory Wayans sparked the family's rise.


"He raised us all like Jedis," he said. "We wouldn't be here if it wasn't for our big brother."


Marlon Wayans joked that when his brother told their mom he was leaving college for comedy, she said, "Boy, I've known you your whole life, and you ain't never said nothing funny. That's the funniest thing you've said."


The crowd erupted in laughter, a fitting tribute to a family that has kept audiences laughing for more than three decades.


The family has a long list of credits. Keenen Ivory Wayans created the sketch comedy series "In Living Color" in 1990 and directed the 2000 slasher spoof "Scary Movie," which was written by Marlon Wayans and Shawn Wayans, who also wrote and starred in "White Chicks" in 2004. Damon Wayan's had a starring role in the 1995 comedy "Major Payne," and currently co-stars with son Damon Wayans Jr. in the CBS sitcom "Poppa's House," which was nominated for an NAACP Award. The pair also were nominated for their acting on the show.


Damon Wayans Jr. has acted in two of the most critically acclaimed comedies in recent years: "Happy Endings" and "New Girl." Kim Wayans, a comedian, actor and director, also received praise for her work in the 2011 drama "Pariah."


Entertainer of the year


Keke Palmer expressed her surprise after her name was called as winner of the coveted entertainment of the year.


"Oh my gosh. Guys, I didn't think I was going to win," said Palmer, who paid homage to fellow nominee Cynthia Erivo's Oscar-nominated performance in "Wicked."


Palmer starred in the buddy comedy "One of Them Days," which debuted No. 1 at the box office last month. She also won an Emmy for her hosting efforts on NBC's "Password."


"It's such an amazing category to be in with all these people," Palmer said. "It's a beautiful night. It's Black History Month, y'all. It's so important we all come here together and celebrate one another with one another."


Other nominees included Kendrick Lamar, Kevin Hart and Shannon Sharpe.


Awards recognize LA residents impacted by wildfires


Image Awards host Deon Cole honored residents of the nearby Altadena neighborhood who were affected by January's devastating Los Angeles-area wildfires.


A video of the fire devastation played before actor Morris Chestnut took the stage.


"Homes were lost, stores destroyed, countless lives shattered and over two dozen souls gone forever," said Chestnut, a Los Angeles native who referenced impacted areas such as Altadena, the Pacific Palisades and Malibu.


"But what was not lost is the spirit of our community," said Chestnut, who noted 22 Altadena residents attended the show on Saturday. Many in the audience stood and applauded.


Cole shifted tone and brightened the mood with a comedic prayer for Kanye West's wife to find more clothes after her barely-there Grammys look and for Shannon Sharpe to finally size up his T-shirts.


The opening act was a lead-up to the evening's first award: Queen Latifah as best actress in a drama series for her role in "The Equalizer."


Chappelle honored


Dave Chappelle was honored with the President's Award for his "thought-provoking humor."


Accepting the award, Chappelle talked about the NAACP's push against negative portrayals of Black people in media and the importance of representation.


"Every opportunity we get, we just keep chipping away at this monster of a machine," he said.


Past recipients of the President's Award include Jay-Z, Lauryn Hill, Usher, Rihanna and John Legend.

## California governor asks Congress for nearly $40 billion for Los Angeles wildfire relief

date: 2025-02-24, from: VOA News USA

Sacramento, California — California Gov. Gavin Newsom has asked Congress to approve nearly $40 billion in aid to help the Los Angeles area recover from January's devastating wildfires, which he said could become the costliest natural disaster in U.S. history.


Newsom sent a letter Friday asking for support from lawmakers including House Speaker Mike Johnson and Rep. Tom Cole, the House Appropriations Committee chair.


"Los Angeles is one of the most economically productive places on the globe, but it can only rebound and flourish with support from the federal government as it recovers from this unprecedented disaster," Newsom wrote.


The total economic losses from the firestorm have been estimated to surpass $250 billion — with real estate losses from the Palisades and Eaton fires predicted to potentially top $30 billion, according to a Los Angeles Times analysis. More than 16,200 structures were destroyed as flames ripped through Pacific Palisades, Malibu, Pasadena and Altadena.


Newsom vowed that the funding would be used to rebuild homes, infrastructure, businesses, schools, churches and health care facilities, while supporting the needs of people affected by the devastation.


"Make no mistake, Los Angeles will use this money wisely," Newsom wrote.


His largest request is for an additional $16.8 billion from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, mostly intended for the rebuilding of property and infrastructure, with $5 billion earmarked for debris cleanup.


Newsom also asked for $9.9 billion from the Department of Housing and Urban Development for grants to fire victims, homeowners, businesses and renters, as well as $5.29 billion from the Small Business Administration for homeowner and business loans.


Newsom thanked President Donald Trump for support for fast-tracking debris removal. The letter did not mention recent threats by the Trump administration that federal aid could come with strings attached.


"We are eternally grateful," Newsom said.


Trump has been a frequent critic of Newsom and California's water policies. Ric Grenell, a Trump ally serving as his envoy for special missions, said Friday that "there will be conditions" to any federal aid for the state.


He said one of the possible conditions being discussed was defunding the California Coastal Commission, which regulates coastal development and protects public beach access. Trump has criticized the agency as overly restrictive, bureaucratic and a hindrance to timely rebuilding efforts.

## Trump administration fires 2,000 USAID workers, puts thousands of others on leave

date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The Trump administration said Sunday that it was placing all but a fraction of staffers at the U.S. Agency for International Development on leave worldwide and eliminating 2,000 U.S.-based staff positions.


The move was the latest and one of the biggest steps yet toward what President Donald Trump and cost-cutting ally Elon Musk say is their goal of gutting the six-decade-old aid and development agency in a broader campaign to slash the size of the federal government.


The move comes after a federal judge on Friday allowed the administration to move forward with its plan to pull thousands of USAID staffers off the job in the United States and around the world. U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols rejected pleas in a lawsuit from employees to keep temporarily blocking the government's plan.


"As of 11:59 p.m. EST on Sunday, February 23, 2025, all USAID direct hire personnel, with the exception of designated personnel responsible for mission-critical functions, core leadership and/or specially designated programs, will be placed on administrative leave globally," according to the notices sent to USAID workers that were viewed by The Associated Press.


At the same time, the agency said it was beginning a reduction in force that would eliminate 2,000 U.S.-based staffers. That means many of the Washington-based staffers who are being placed on leave would soon have their positions eliminated.


The Trump appointee running USAID, deputy administrator Pete Marocco, has indicated he plans to keep about 600 mostly U.S.-based staffers on the job in the meantime, in part to arrange travel for USAID staffers and families abroad.


USAID and the State Department did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.


The move escalates a monthlong push to dismantle the agency, which has included closing its headquarters in Washington and shutting down thousands of aid and development programs worldwide following an effort to freeze all foreign assistance. Trump and Musk contend that USAID's work is wasteful and furthers a liberal agenda.


Lawsuits by government workers' unions, USAID contractors and others say the administration lacks the constitutional authority to eliminate an independent agency or congressionally funded programs without lawmakers' approval.


The Trump administration efforts upend decades of U.S. policy that aid and development work overseas serves national security by stabilizing regions and economies and building alliances, a critical tool of U.S. "soft power" for winning influence abroad.


The notices of firings and leaves come on top of hundreds of USAID contractors receiving no-name form letters of termination in the past week, according to copies that AP viewed.


The blanket nature of the notification letters to USAID contractors, excluding the names or positions of those receiving them, could make it difficult for the dismissed workers to get unemployment benefits, workers noted.


A different judge in a second lawsuit tied to USAID has temporarily blocked the foreign funding freeze and said this past week that the administration had kept withholding the aid despite his court order and must at least temporarily restore the funding to programs worldwide.

## Some US agencies tell workers not to reply to Musk's 'accomplishments email'

date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Multiple U.S. federal agencies told employees not to respond immediately to a demand by President Donald Trump's adviser Elon Musk to list their accomplishments in the last week or be fired, as a chaotic campaign to cull the bureaucracy pushes forward.


Trump administration-appointed officials at the FBI and State Department sent their staff emails telling them not to respond outside their chains of command, in a possible sign of tension between members of the Republican administration and the world's richest person in his campaign to cut down the government's 2.3 million-member civilian workforce.


"The FBI, through the office of the director, is in charge of all our review processes," said FBI Director Kash Patel, a Trump appointee, in an email to staff seen by Reuters.


Musk leads the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which in the first weeks of Trump's administration has laid off more than 20,000 workers and offered buyouts to another 75,000, across wide swaths of the government from the Defense Department — long a top Republican priority — to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, where all staff have been ordered to halt work.


The frantic pace has led the federal government in some cases to rush to rehire workers who perform critical functions like securing the nation's nuclear arsenal and trying to fight the worsening bird flu outbreak, which has caused egg prices to spike higher.


While there is bipartisan agreement that the U.S. government, which carries $36 trillion in debt, would benefit from reform, Musk's tumultuous approach has drawn widespread criticism, including from voters in some Republican areas.


Federal workers Saturday evening received an email instructing them to detail the work they did during the previous week by 11:59 p.m. ET on Monday (0459 GMT Tuesday), shortly after Musk posted on his X social media site that failing to respond would be taken as a resignation.


The subject of the email read, "What did you do last week?" and came from a human resources address in the Office of Personnel Management, but did not include Musk's threat of termination.


Workers at the departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Education and Commerce, as well as at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National Institutes of Health and the Internal Revenue Service also were told not to respond, pending further guidance, according to sources and emails reviewed by Reuters.


"To be clear — this is irregular, unexpected, and warrants further validation," a senior executive at the National Centers for Environmental Information, an agency that manages environmental data and is part of the Commerce Department, wrote.


Some officials welcomed the move. Ed Martin, Trump's nominee for U.S. Attorney in Washington, D.C., who is serving in an interim capacity, praised Musk and DOGE in an email response.


But other offices within the Justice Department, including the executive office that supports all U.S. attorneys and the department's civil division, told employees not to reply, pending additional information.


Employees at the Drug Enforcement Administration, part of the Justice Department, were told to respond, according to an email seen by Reuters.


Union questions Musk's authority


The largest federal workers' union, the American Federation of Government Employees, wrote on X on Sunday that it did not believe Musk had the authority to fire employees who did not respond and would formally request that OPM rescind the message.


Meanwhile, the union advised members to ask their supervisors directly whether to reply and to follow their guidance.


The email left some employees even more frustrated and worried after weeks of uncertainty about their futures.


"I really wonder when someone is going to say enough," one IRS employee told Reuters.


Media offices at the Commerce, Justice, Education and Treasury departments, as well as at the FDIC and NIH, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. An FBI spokesperson declined to comment, and a State Department spokesperson referred questions to the White House.


Musk on X on Sunday called the email "a very basic pulse check."


Senator John Curtis, a Republican from Utah, said he supports the Trump administration's efforts to reduce government spending, but that Musk should take a more humane approach.


"If I could say one thing to Elon Musk, it's please put a dose of compassion in this," Curtis said on CBS News' "Face the Nation."


"These are real people. These are real lives. These are mortgages. It's a false narrative to say we have to cut, and you have to be cruel to do it as well."


Some federal judiciary employees, including judges, also received the Saturday email from OPM, even though the court system is not part of the executive branch, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts confirmed.


The judiciary advised employees that no action should be taken in response to the message, according to an email reviewed by Reuters.


In some cases, employees were left unsure how to respond even if they chose to do so.


Some lawyers, for instance, expressed concern that their work is confidential.


Workers at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau also received the email, according to people with knowledge of the matter, even though they were all ordered to cease working since early this month, leaving them with little to do.

## Hegseth defends Trump's firings of Pentagon leaders, says more may be to come

date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth insists President Donald Trump 's abrupt firing of the nation's senior military officer amid a wave of dismissals at the Pentagon wasn't unusual and he suggested more firings could come.


"Nothing about this is unprecedented," Hegseth told "Fox News Sunday" about Air Force Gen. CQ Brown Jr. being removed Friday night as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. "The president deserves to pick his key national security advisory team."


Hegseth said "there are lots of presidents who made changes" citing former commanders in chief, including Franklin D. Roosevelt, George H.W. Bush and Barack Obama. Obama, Hegseth said, "fired or dismissed hundreds" of military officials.


Months into his first term, Obama removed Army Gen. David McKiernan from being commander of the U.S. forces in Afghanistan. However, Trump, while running for his second term, vowed to eradicate "woke" ideologies from the military and to swiftly dismiss many top leaders.


Hegseth and Trump have made no secret about focusing on pushing aside military officers who have supported diversity, equity and inclusion in the ranks. The administration says the move will better fortify a lethal fighting force.


Brown was just the second Black general to serve as chairman. His 16 months in the post were consumed with the war in Ukraine and the expanded conflict in the Middle East. Trump in 2020 nominated Brown as Air Force's chief of staff.


Trump wants to replace Brown with Air Force Lt. Gen. Dan "Razin" Caine, who retired in December. It is unclear what recalling Caine to active-duty service will require. The position requires Caine to be confirmed by the Senate.


Hegseth said Friday's dismissals affected six three- and four-star generals and were "a reflection of the president wanting the right people around him to execute the national security approach we want to take."


He called Brown "honorable" but said he is "not the right man for the moment," without citing specific deficiencies. After the 2020 murder of George Floyd, Brown in a video spoke of his experience as a Black pilot, apparently making him fodder for the Trump administration's wars against inclusion initiatives in the military.


Of Caine, Hegseth said that Trump "respects leaders who untie the hands of war fighters in a very dangerous world."


Retired Gen. George Casey called the firings "extremely destabilizing." Casey, who was Republican President George W. Bush's commander of the U.S. and multinational forces in Iraq from 2004 to 2007, also noted that the Trump administration can change Pentagon policy without changing personnel, but added, that what happened is "within the president's prerogative."


"That's his prerogative," Casey told ABC's "This Week." "He is the commander in chief of the armed forces."


Still, Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee told ABC that the firings were "completely unjustified" and that "apparently, what Trump and Hegseth are trying to do is to politicize the Department of Defense."


Hegseth was also asked on Fox News about officials potentially compiling lists of more defense officials they plan to fire. He said there was no list but suggested that more dismissals could indeed be coming.


"We have a very keen eye towards military leadership and their willingness to follow lawful order," Hegseth said. "Joe Biden gave lawful orders. A lot of them are really bad," he said, adding that things like COVID vaccine mandates "eroded" the military ideologically


"President Trump has given another set of lawful orders and they will be followed," Hegseth said. "If they're not followed then those officers will find the door."

## American Airlines flight from New York to Delhi lands safely in Rome after security concern

date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA

Rome, Italy — An American Airlines flight from New York to New Delhi, India, landed safely in Rome on Sunday afternoon after it was diverted due to a security concern , which later proved to be "non-credible," the airline said. 


American Airlines said Flight 292 "was inspected by law enforcement" after landing at Leonardo da Vinci International Airport and "cleared to re-depart." 


It didn't clarify the cause of the security concern, but added an inspection was required by protocol before the flight could land in New Delhi. 


"The flight will stay in Rome overnight to allow for required crew rest before continuing to Delhi as soon as possible tomorrow," the airline said. 


An Associated Press reporter filmed two fighter jets flying over the airport shortly before the unscheduled landing. Fire trucks were visible on the landing strip on one side of the plane after it landed. 


The airport continued to operate normally, a spokesman with Rome's airport said.

## 'Captain America' dives in 2nd weekend, 'The Monkey' boosts Neon's successes

date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA

New York — “Captain America: Brave New World” soared on opening weekend but crashed down in its second go-around with audiences. 


“Brave New World,” the latest sign that the Marvel machine isn’t quite what it used to be, remained No. 1 at the box office in its second frame with $28.2 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday. But after a debut of $100 million over four days and $88 million over three days, that meant a steep drop of 68%. 


While blockbusters often see significant slides in their second weekends, only two previous MCU titles have fallen off so fast: 2023’s “The Marvels,” which fell 78%, and 2023’s “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,” which dropped 70%. 


The Anthony Mackie-led “Captain America” installment has been slammed by critics, and audiences also have graded it poorly, with a “B-” CinemaScore. “Brave New World,” which fans had hoped would right the Marvel ship, has been largely met as another example of a once impenetrable brand struggling to recapture its pre- “Avengers: Endgame” aura of invincibility. 


Still, “Brave New World” has quickly grossed $289.4 million worldwide, with international sales nearly reaching $150 million. And with few big-budget offerings arriving in theaters in the coming weeks, it will have scant competition through much of March. 


The biggest new release of the weekend was Oz Perkins’ “The Monkey,” the director’s follow-up to his 2024 horror hit, “Longlegs.” Adapted from a Stephen King short story, “The Monkey” opened with $14.2 million for Neon, the second-best debut for the indie distributor. The best? “Longlegs,” which launched with $22.4 million. 




Neon had much to celebrate over the weekend. Its top awards contender, “Anora,” by Sean Baker, continues to gather momentum into next Sunday's Academy Awards. The best-picture favorite added wins at the Independent Spirit Awards on Saturday. 


Perkins, Neon and Blumhouse, which partnered in the release of “The Monkey,” have found a productive low-budget collaboration, with more on the way. Even if “The Monkey” doesn’t reach the heights of “Longlegs” ($126.9 million globally), Perkins and Neon return with “Keeper” this October. 


“The Monkey,” starring Tatiana Maslany and Theo James, revolves around an old monkey toy found in an attic. Reviews have been good (77% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes), though audiences were less impressed, giving it a C+ CinemaScore. Horror films, though, typically grade low. 


As it did with “Longlegs,” Neon leaned into cryptic promotion for “The Monkey,” along with some macabre marketing. A funeral premiere was held at Los Angeles’ Immanuel Presbyterian Church, and fan screenings took place at the Hollywood Cemetery. The film, produced by James Wan, cost $10 million to make. 


Lionsgate’s “The Unbreakable Boy” opened with a paltry $2.5 million in 1,687 theaters. The Christian-themed Jon Gunn-directed film starring Zachary Levi and Meghann Fahy, is about parents who learn their son is autistic and has brittle bone disease. 


“Paddington in Peru,” the third installment of the marmalade-mad bear, fell to third place in its second weekend. It grossed $6.5 million in 3,890 locations, bringing its two-week total to $25.2 million. “Paddington in Peru” has been most popular overseas, where its collected $150 million thus far. 


“Ne Zha 2,” the animated Chinese juggernaut, took in $3.1 million from 800 theaters in its second weekend. In China, the sequel has grossed $1.7 billion this month, setting numerous box-office records. Those totals put "Ne Zha 2" past “Inside Out 2” ($1.66 billion) as the highest grossing animated film ever. 


Top 10 movies by domestic box office 


With final domestic figures releasing Monday, this list factors in the estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. 


1. “Captain America: Brave New World," $28.2 million. 


2. “The Monkey,” $14.2 million. 


3. “Paddington in Peru,” $6.5 million. 


4. “Dog Man,” $5.9 million. 


5. “Ne Zha 2,” $3.1 million. 


6. “Heart Eyes,” $2.9 million. 


7. “Mufasa: The Lion King,” $2.5 million. 


8. “The Unbreakable Boy,” $2.5 million. 


9. “Chhaava,” $1.5 million. 


10. “One of Them Days,” $1.4 million.

## Washington, Kyiv headed toward deal for Ukrainian 'critical minerals' rights

date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA

The United States and Ukraine said Sunday they are heading toward an agreement for Kyiv to give Washington a large share of its rare earth mineral rights as compensation for the billions of dollars in munitions the U.S. sent to Ukraine to defend itself from Russia’s full-scale war.


Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told a news conference in Kyiv that Ukraine and the U.S. are “making progress” in reaching a deal. He said a draft of the pact calls for Ukraine to pay the U.S. $2 for each dollar in aid the U.S. has sent to Kyiv to fight Russia’s invasion, although details of the would-be agreement have not been disclosed.


Zelenskyy called for security guarantees for Ukraine as part of any deal and said he wants better financial terms. “I don’t want something that 10 generations of Ukrainians will have to pay back,” he said.


The war hits the three-year mark on Monday.


Watch related report by Veronica Balderas Iglesias:




The U.S. has been Ukraine’s biggest benefactor, sending $128 billion in military and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, according to Germany’s Kiel Institute for the World Economy. The U.S. share is just ahead of the combined $124 billion figure for the 27-nation European Union.


U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff told CNN’s “State of the Union” that he expects Zelenskyy will sign the minerals deal this week.




Zelenskyy at first rejected the U.S. demand for half of Ukraine’s rare earth mineral supplies, which are used in the production of technology products. Witkoff signaled in the CNN interview that the deal will now be completed although he did not spell out details of the agreement.


Witkoff said that European countries made their contributions to Ukraine’s war efforts after reaching agreement with Kyiv to eventually be paid back, but the U.S. had no such understanding.


Witkoff said such U.S. support for Ukraine with no repayment terms made “no sense” to President Donald Trump, a long-time New York real estate deal maker before entering politics in 2015.


Zelenskyy said, "I had an agreement with [former U.S. President Joe] Biden and American Congress, I am grateful to the Congress, to the both parties. And it was support by providing grants. Grant is not a loan. And we don't have to return the loan here. Maybe someone does not like it and thinks that it's unjust. Maybe. I don't know. But here is what this deal was about. It was grant. Therefore, it's not about the figure. We simply don't see it as a loan."


Trump, who last week called Zelenskyy a “dictator” and accused him of starting the war even though Russia invaded Ukraine, has demanded the repayments and blamed his predecessor, Biden, for not securing some form of compensation guarantee.


Zelenskyy said Sunday he wants Trump to "understand" his position and come through with concrete security guarantees to help Kyiv defend itself against the Russian invasion.


"I want very much from Trump understanding of each other," Zelenskyy said at his news conference, adding: "Security guarantees from Trump are much needed."


Zelenskyy said he was willing to give up his presidency if it meant peace in Ukraine, quipping that he could exchange his departure for Ukraine's entry into NATO, which Russia is adamantly opposed to.


"If [it means] peace for Ukraine, if you really need me to leave my post, I am ready," Zelenskyy said. "I can exchange this for NATO [membership], if that condition is there, immediately."


The top U.S. and Russian diplomats, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, met in Saudi Arabia without either Ukrainian or European officials last week to lay the groundwork for peace talks to end the war. Zelenskyy complained about Ukraine being excluded from the talks, but Trump said he could have negotiated with Russia beforehand to talk Moscow out of invading.


“I’ve had very good talks with Putin, and I’ve had not such good talks with Ukraine,” Trump told U.S. state governors at the White House.


“They don’t have any cards, but they play it tough,” Trump said of Ukraine.


Russian state television said in recent days that Trump’s view of the Russia-Ukraine conflict is “in total alignment with the way we see things.”


Witkoff said the war “wouldn’t have had to happen” if Ukraine hadn’t been pushing at the time for membership in NATO. Kyiv is still pressing to join the 32-nation pact, but Washington says it is unrealistic for that to happen as part of a negotiated peace settlement to end the war.


Witkoff said that eventually “you’ll see concessions signed by both sides” in a peace deal.


Russia now controls about one-fifth of the internationally recognized Ukrainian territory, with Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov saying Sunday Moscow has no intention of yielding any of the land back to the Kyiv government.


"The people decided to join Russia a long time ago," he said, referring to Moscow-staged votes in eastern Ukraine held amid the three-year offensive that were assailed as bogus by Kyiv, the West and international monitors.


"No one will ever sell off these territories,” Peskov said. “That's the most important thing."




A Trump call with Putin two weeks ago set the stage for the Rubio-Lavrov talks in Saudi Arabia.  


"This is a dialogue between two extraordinary presidents," Peskov told state TV.  


Meanwhile, Zelenskyy said Russia launched 267 overnight drone attacks on Ukraine, which he condemned as "aerial terror." Ukrainian officials reported damage in five regions of the country.  


Zelenskyy said that in the past week, Russia has targeted Ukraine with nearly 1,150 attack drones, more than 1,400 guided aerial bombs and 35 missiles of various types.

## Kremlin hails Putin-Trump dialogue as promising

date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA

Moscow — The Kremlin on Sunday hailed dialogue between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin — two "extraordinary" presidents — as "promising," and vowed it would "never" give up territory seized in eastern Ukraine.


Trump broke with Western policy earlier this month by phoning Putin to discuss how to end the conflict in Ukraine — a call hailed by Moscow as ending three years of isolation for the Kremlin leader since he launched his full-scale offensive in February 2022.


Top Russian and U.S. officials then met in Saudi Arabia last week to discuss a "restoration" of ties and start a discussion on a possible ceasefire — all without the involvement of Kyiv or Europe.


"This is a dialogue between two extraordinary presidents," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told state TV on Sunday.


"That's promising," he added.


"It is important that nothing prevents us from realizing the political will of the two heads of state."


Trump's overtures to Moscow have triggered alarm in Kyiv and across Europe.


But it is unclear whether his moves will be able to bring Moscow and Kyiv closer to a truce.


Peskov on Sunday ruled out any territorial concessions as part of a settlement.


"The people decided to join Russia a long time ago," he said, referring to Moscow-staged votes in eastern Ukraine held amid the offensive that were slammed as bogus by Kyiv, the West and international monitors.


"No one will ever sell off these territories. That's the most important thing."




'God willed it'


Putin said God and fate had entrusted him and his army with "the mission" to defend Russia.


"Fate willed it so, God willed it so, if I may say so. A mission as difficult as it is honorable — defending Russia — has been placed on our and your shoulders together," he told servicemen who have fought in Ukraine.


Russia was on Sunday marking Defender of the Fatherland Day — a holiday hailing soldiers and veterans — a day before the three-year anniversary of the start of its full-scale offensive.


"Today, at the risk of their lives and with courage, they are resolutely defending their homeland, national interests and Russia's future," Putin said in a video released by the Kremlin.


Moscow's army had overnight launched a record 267 attack drones at Ukraine, Kyiv's air force said.


Among them, 138 were intercepted by air defense and 119 were "lost."


Ukraine did not say what happened to the remaining 10 but a separate armed forces statement on Telegram said several regions, Kyiv included, had been "hit."


AFP journalists in the Ukrainian capital heard air defense systems in operation throughout the night.


'Inappropriate remarks'


Amid his outreach to Moscow, Trump has also verbally attacked Ukraine's leader, Volodymyr Zelenskyy falsely claiming Kyiv started the war and that Zelenskyy was hugely unpopular at home.


The bitter war of words has threatened to undermine Western support for Kyiv at a critical juncture in the conflict.


Zelenskyy on Sunday called for the Western coalition that has been helping Kyiv fend off the Russian offensive for the last three years to hold strong.


"We must do our best to achieve a lasting and just peace for Ukraine. This is possible with the unity of all partners: we need the strength of the whole of Europe, the strength of America, the strength of all those who want lasting peace," Zelenskyy said on Telegram.


Moscow has reveled in the spat between Trump and Zelenskyy.


"Zelenskyy makes inappropriate remarks addressed to the head of state. He does it repeatedly," Peskov said Sunday.


"No president would tolerate that kind of treatment. So his [Trump's] reaction is completely quite understandable."




Scrambling to respond to Trump's dramatic policy reversal, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will travel to Washington next week to make the case for supporting Ukraine.

## New FBI Director Patel will also be named acting head of firearms agency, official says

date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — New FBI Director Kash Patel is expected to be named the acting head of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, a Justice Department official said Saturday.


Patel could be sworn in next week, the official said, putting Patel in charge of two of the Justice Department's largest agencies in an unusual arrangement that raises questions about the future of the bureau that has long drawn the ire of conservatives.


The Justice Department official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the move before it's announced publicly. White House officials didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Saturday evening.


Patel was sworn in Friday as FBI director after winning Senate approval despite Democrats' concerns about the steadfast Trump ally's plans to radically overhaul the FBI.


ATF is a separate agency with about 5,500 employees and is responsible for enforcing the nation's laws around firearms, explosives and arson. Among other things, it's in charge of licensing federal firearms dealers, tracing guns used in crimes and analyzing intelligence in shooting investigations.


The move was first reported Saturday by ABC News.


The news comes days after Attorney General Pam Bondi fired the ATF's top lawyer. Bondi said in a Fox News interview Friday that she fired chief counsel Pamela Hicks because the agency was "targeting gun owners." Hicks, who spent more than 20 years as a Justice Department lawyer, said in a social media post that being ATF chief counsel was the "highest honor" of her career.


Conservatives have long railed against ATF over its role in regulating firearms and have suggested shuttering the agency. Under the Biden administration, the ATF advanced new regulations aimed at cracking down on ghost guns and requiring thousands more firearms dealers to run background checks on buyers at gun shows or other places outside brick-and-mortar stores.


In an executive order earlier this month, President Donald Trump directed the attorney general to review all actions taken by the Biden administration around firearms "to assess any ongoing infringements of the Second Amendment rights of our citizens."


Gun safety groups have raised alarm about putting Patel in charge of the FBI, with gun control group Brady calling him a "known gun rights extremist." Gun Owners of America, a gun rights group, called his confirmation as FBI director "a major victory for gun owners and constitutional rights advocates nationwide."


The last confirmed ATF director was Steve Dettelbach, a former federal prosecutor, who led the agency from July 2022 until last month. He was the first confirmed director since 2015 as both Republican and Democratic administrations failed to get nominees through the politically fraught process.

## Pakistan threatens to deport Afghans if US relocation timeline isn’t met

date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA

ISLAMABAD — Pakistan has warned that thousands of Afghan nationals awaiting relocation and resettlement in the United States will be deported to Afghanistan if their cases are rejected or not processed on time.


Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar issued the warning during a television interview aired Saturday, noting that the U.S. has promised to relocate the Afghan community in question from Pakistan "tentatively around September this year." His office in Islamabad released the interview excerpts.


"If any refugee who was undertaken to be taken by another country after due process —no matter the timeline — if it doesn’t happen and the country refuses, then for us, that will be an illegal immigrant in Pakistan, and we might be forced to send such refugee back to [their] original country, which is Afghanistan," Dar told Turkey’s TRT national broadcaster.


However, the chief Pakistani diplomat expressed Islamabad’s willingness to resolve the issue with Washington, stating that his government is "examining the situation and will negotiate [accordingly]."


Last month, U.S. President Donald Trump halted refugee applications and travel plans until further notice to ensure that refugee entry into the United States aligns with its national interests.


The decision has stranded around 45,000 Afghans prepared to fly out of Afghanistan and at least 15,000 qualified refugees currently in Pakistan, according to #AfghanEvac, a coalition that assists Afghans with their relocation and resettlement in the U.S.


These individuals were part of Afghan families who fled their country following the Taliban insurgents’ retaking of power in 2021, primarily seeking refuge from potential retribution because of their affiliations with the U.S. and NATO forces during their nearly two-decade-long presence in Afghanistan.


While about 80,000 of these Afghans have since been relocated from Pakistan, officials in Islamabad assert that around 40,000 remain in a state of limbo including around 15,000 in Pakistan destined for the United States.


Since launching a crackdown on undocumented foreign migrants in September 2023, Pakistan has forcibly repatriated more than 825,000 undocumented Afghan refugees to their home country, according to the United Nations.


The government has recently intensified its crackdown, targeting both documented and undocumented Afghan refugees.


Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif ordered authorities last month to remove all Afghans from Islamabad and the adjoining city of Rawalpindi by Feb. 28 before arranging for deporting them to Afghanistan along with others subsequently. The targeted population encompasses over 2.5 million Afghans nationwide, comprising lawful refugees, documented economic migrants, and those without legal authorization to remain in Pakistan.


Sharif’s directive stipulates March 31 as the deadline for the United States and other countries to process the cases of Afghans awaiting resettlements, thereby preventing their deportation.

## Macron, Starmer to meet Trump, offer ideas for Ukraine security guarantees

date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA

LONDON/PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will travel to Washington next week amid alarm in Europe over U.S. President Donald Trump's hardening stance toward Ukraine and overtures to Moscow on the three-year conflict.


The leaders of Europe's two nuclear powers, who will be traveling separately, are expected to try to persuade Trump not to rush into a ceasefire deal with Vladimir Putin at any cost, keep Europe involved and discuss military guarantees to Ukraine.


Macron, who is trying to capitalize on a relationship with Trump built during their first presidential terms, has said agreeing to a bad deal that would amount to a capitulation of Ukraine would signal weakness to the United States' foes, including China and Iran.


"I will tell him: deep down you cannot be weak in the face of President (Putin). It's not you, it's not what you're made of and it's not in your interests," he said in an hourlong question and answer session on social media ahead of Monday's visit to the White House.


The visits come amid a rift between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, whom Trump described as a "dictator." That has alarmed Kyiv's European allies, already reeling from a more aggressive U.S. posture on trade, diplomacy and even domestic European politics.


Philip Golub, a professor in international relations at the American University in Paris, said Trump's rapid-fire moves in his first weeks in office, as well as the rhetoric from other U.S. officials, had been a major shock for the Europeans.


"They could not have expected that somehow within the United States would emerge this ultra-nationalist coalition of forces that would actually challenge Europe's voice in world affairs in such a stark and strong way," he told Reuters.


He said Macron believed he had a "historic role to play" in going to Washington to ensure Europe can weigh in on the ultimate negotiations on Ukraine. "Whether he can actually achieve something, however, in this visit is an entirely different matter," he added.




Starmer, who has also warned the end of the war cannot be a "temporary pause before Putin attacks again," will be in Washington on Thursday.


Speaking on a Fox News podcast on Friday, Trump said Macron and Starmer had not "done anything" to end the war. "No meetings with Russia!" he said, although he described Macron as "a friend of mine" and Starmer as "a very nice guy."


However, the two countries are keen to show Trump they are ready to take on a bigger burden for European security.


Britain and France are firming up ideas with allies for military guarantees for Ukraine and their two leaders will seek to persuade Trump to provide U.S. assurances in any post ceasefire deal, Western officials said.


Their respective militaries began initial planning last summer for the post-war scenario, but the discussions accelerated in November after Trump secured the U.S. presidency, a French military official and two diplomats said.


They have also been supported in putting together an array of options by countries like Denmark and the Baltic states as Europeans discuss what they would be ready to do should there be an accord and peacekeepers required, officials said.


While both Britain and France have ruled out sending troops to Ukraine immediately, the plans, still in concept stage, center around providing air, maritime, land and cyber support that would aim to deter Russia from launching any future attacks, Western officials said.


Air and sea assets could be based in Poland or Romania, restoring safe international air space and ensuring the Black Sea remained safe for international shipping, the official said.


Part of the British and French talks center around the possibility of sending European peacekeepers. While U.S. boots on the ground may not be necessary, deterrence in the form of U.S. medium-range missiles and ultimately nuclear weapons will remain crucial.


The options being discussed would center not on providing troops for the frontline or the 2,000-kilometer border which would remain secured by Ukrainian forces, but further to the West, three European diplomats and the military official said.


Those troops could be tasked with protecting key Ukrainian infrastructure such as ports or nuclear facilities to reassure the Ukrainian population. However, Russia has made it clear it would oppose a European presence in Ukraine.


A French military official said there was little sense in talking numbers at this stage because it would depend on what was finally agreed, what international mandate was given and whether non-European troops would also be involved.


"It's not about the numbers of troops in Ukraine. It's the ability to mobilize and the ability to arrange everything into a package of interoperability units," the French official said.


A Western official said that even 30,000 troops could be on the "high side."

## Musk orders US federal workers to describe what they did at work last week or get fired

date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Elon Musk, the billionaire head of the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), threatened Saturday to fire any federal worker who fails to explain what work they have accomplished during the previous week. 


The threat, issued in a post on the social media site X, was made just hours after President Donald Trump posted on his own social media network Truth Social that DOGE should get more aggressive in its attempts to downsize and reshape the federal workforce. 


"All federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week," Musk posted on X. "Failure to respond will be taken as a resignation." 


As of Saturday evening, emails were sent to employees at federal agencies including the Securities and Exchange Commission, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and others with the subject line, "What did you do last week?" 


The email, seen by Reuters, asks employees to reply to the email they have received with five bullet points summarizing "what you accomplished at work last week" and copy their managers. 


The email sent from a human resources address gives employees until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on Monday to respond. 


It is unclear what legal basis Musk has to terminate federal workers if they fail to respond to his request. 


Workers at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau also received the email Saturday, according to people with knowledge of the matter. However, most agency staff had been ordered not to perform any tasks since early this month, creating a conundrum. The agency is also under a temporary court order not to resume mass firings pending the outcome of legal proceedings. 


A spokesperson for DOGE did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 


The AFGE, the union representing federal employees, said in a statement it will challenge any "unlawful terminations."  


"Once again, Elon Musk and the Trump administration have shown their utter disdain for federal employees and the critical services they provide to the American people," said AFGE National President Everett Kelley.  


The Trump administration's fast-paced and controversial process to reduce government spending by shrinking the federal workforce led by Musk and his young aides at the cost-cutting DOGE has led to haphazard firings that resulted in numerous mistakes and forced several agencies to quickly rehire vital employees, such as those working on nuclear safety, defense and power generation. 


The first wave of job cuts has targeted workers who are easier to fire, such as employees on the job for less than two years or those who have started new roles within an agency. 


The indiscriminate firings have led to DOGE terminating people whose jobs are not funded by taxpayers and have begun to anger people across the country who are concerned about a loss of services as well as the impact of federal job losses on local economies. 


Trump has repeatedly talked about Musk as the functional leader of DOGE, which is not a Cabinet-level department, but the White House said in a court filing earlier this month that Musk had no authority over DOGE and was not an employee of the program.

## Officer killed after gunman takes hostages at Pennsylvania hospital

date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA

YORK, PENNSYLVANIA  — A man armed with a pistol and carrying zip ties entered a Pennsylvania hospital's intensive care unit Saturday and took staff members hostage before he was killed by police in a shootout that also left an officer dead, authorities said.


Three workers at UPMC Memorial Hospital, including a doctor, a nurse and a custodian, and two other officers were shot and wounded in the attack, York County District Attorney Tim Barker said. A fourth staffer was injured in a fall.


Gunfire erupted after officers went to engage the shooter, whom Barker identified as Diogenes Archangel-Ortiz, 49. He said Archangel-Ortiz was holding at gunpoint a female staff member who had her hands bound with zip ties when police opened fire.


"This is a huge loss to our community," Barker said at a news conference following the shooting. "It is absolutely clear, and beyond any and all doubt, that the officers were justified in taking their action using deadly force."


Barker added that while the investigation is in its early stages, it appears Archangel-Ortiz had previous contact with the hospital's ICU earlier in the week for "a medical purpose involving another individual" and he intentionally targeted the workers there.


No one answered the door Saturday at an address in York believed to be that of Archangel-Ortiz.


The officer who died was identified as Andrew Duarte of the West York Borough Police Department.


"We all have broken hearts and are grieving at his loss," West York Borough Manager Shawn Mauck told The Associated Press.




Duarte was a law enforcement veteran who joined the department in 2022 after five years with the Denver Police Department, according to his LinkedIn profile. He described receiving a "hero award" in 2021 from Mothers Against Drunk Driving for his work in impaired driving enforcement for the state of Colorado.


"I have a type A personality and like to succeed in all that I do," his LinkedIn profile said.


Duarte also worked as a patrol officer in Denver, was highly regarded for his work and was close friends with other officers, the department there said in a statement.


At a makeshift memorial on the front steps of the West York Borough Police Department, Linda Shields dropped off roses Saturday and dabbed tears as she thought of her son, a police officer in Maryland.


"He was so young," Shields said of Duarte. "It makes no sense at all."


Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro called the attack on police and health care workers "the act of a coward."


"Let it not be lost on anyone the act of extraordinary bravery and courage by the health care workers here, by the law enforcement professionals … who ran toward danger to keep people safe," Shapiro said.


UPMC Memorial is a five-story, 104-bed hospital that opened in 2019 in York, a city of about 40,000 people known for its creation of York Peppermint Patties in 1940.


The shooting is part of a wave of gun violence in recent years that has swept through U.S. hospitals and medical centers, which have struggled to adapt to the growing threats. Such attacks have helped make health care one of the nation's most violent fields, with workers suffering more nonfatal injuries from workplace violence than workers in any other profession, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.


In 2023, a shooter killed a security guard in the lobby of New Hampshire’s state psychiatric hospital before being fatally shot by a state trooper. In 2022, a man killed two workers at a Dallas hospital while there to watch his child’s birth. In May of that year, a man opened fire in a medical center waiting room in Atlanta, killing one woman and wounding four. And just one month later, a gunman killed his surgeon and three other people at a Tulsa, Oklahoma, medical office because he blamed the doctor for his continuing pain after an operation.

## Trump revels in mass federal firings, jeers at Biden before CPAC crowd

date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA

OXON HILL, MARYLAND — President Donald Trump said Saturday that "nobody has ever seen anything" like his administration's sweeping effort to fire thousands of federal employees and shrink the size of government. 


Addressing an adoring crowd at the Conservative Political Action Conference in suburban Washington, Trump said, "We're going to forge a new and lasting political majority that will drive American politics for generations to come." 


The president has spent the opening weeks of his administration arguing that voters in November gave him a mandate to overhaul government while cracking down on the U.S.-Mexico border and to extend tax cuts that were the signature policy of his first administration. 


In a speech that lasted more than an hour, Trump predicted that the Republican Party would defy history, which has shown that a president's party typically struggles during midterm congressional elections. Of Republicans, he said, "I don't think we've been at this level, maybe ever." 


"Nobody's ever seen anything like this, and nobody's ever seen four weeks like we had," Trump said, likening his new administration's opening month to being on a roll through the first four holes of a round of golf, which he said gave him confidence for the fifth. 


Trump has empowered billionaire Elon Musk to help carry out the firings; Musk vowed Saturday that more might be coming. 


"Consistent with President @realDonaldTrump's instructions, all federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week," Musk posted on X, which he owns. "Failure to respond will be taken as a resignation." 


Trump also repeatedly said Saturday that he'd carry out harder-line immigration policies. But those efforts have largely been overshadowed by his administration's mass federal firings. He announced that one agency that had been significantly reduced, the U.S. Agency for International Development, would have its Washington office taken over by Customs and Border Protection officials. 


"The agency's name has been removed from its former building," he said. 


The president also repeated his previous promises that his administration will scrutinize the country's gold depository at Fort Knox. 


"Would anybody like to join us?" he said to cheers from the crowd. "We want to see if the gold is still there." 


'Donald, don't get angry' 


But Trump also devoted large parts of his address to last year's presidential race, jeering at former President Joe Biden and mispronouncing the first name of former Vice President Kamala Harris — his Election Day opponent. 


He also mentioned Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat who ran for president in 2020. 


The president said immigration and border policy under Biden made him angry. 


"I couldn't stand it," Trump said, before cautioning himself, "Donald, don't get angry." He went on to use an expletive to describe what he thinks of Biden's handling of border security, despite noting that evangelical conservatives have urged him not to use foul language. 


Trump had kinder words for Chinese President Xi Jinping, saying "I happen to like" him, while adding, "we've been treated very unfairly by China and many other countries." 


President meets with world leaders


On the sidelines of the conference, Trump met with conservative Polish President Andrzej Duda amid rising tensions in Europe over Russia's war in Ukraine. After he took the stage, Trump saluted Duda and Argentine President Javier Milei, who separately addressed the conference. 


Trump called Duda "a fantastic man and a great friend of mine." He noted that Milei was "a MAGA guy, too, Make Argentina Great Again." 


Duda is a populist who has enjoyed a close relationship with Trump in years past. Poland is a longtime ally of Ukraine. Trump upended recent U.S. policy by dispatching top foreign policy advisers to Saudi Arabia for direct talks with Russian officials that were aimed at ending fighting in Ukraine. 


Those meetings did not include Ukrainian or European officials, which has alarmed U.S. allies. After his face-to-face with Duda, Trump is meeting Monday at the White House with French President Emmanuel Macron and Thursday with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. 


Trump also has begun a public back and forth with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, whom the U.S. president called a "dictator" while falsely suggesting that Ukraine started the war — though on Friday he acknowledged that Russia attacked its neighbor. 


Trump said during his speech, "I'm dealing with President Zelenskyy. I'm dealing with President Putin" and added of fighting in Ukraine, "It affects Europe. It doesn't really affect us." 


About ending the war in Ukraine, Trump said Saturday, "I think we're pretty close to a deal, and we better be close to a deal."  


Later, the president and first lady Melania Trump were hosting an evening reception and dinner at the White House for the National Governors Association, which was holding their own weekend meetings in Washington.

## US, Uzbekistan reaffirm commitment to Central Asia security

date: 2025-02-22, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — As the Trump administration begins to engage with Central Asia, Uzbekistan has expressed eagerness to expand its strategic partnership, highlighting what it calls its "enhanced" political dialogue on bilateral and regional issues and security cooperation, including its "solid connection" with the Mississippi National Guard.


The U.S. recently got back its seven Black Hawk helicopters from Uzbekistan that Afghan military pilots had flown there in 2021 while fleeing the Taliban.


This transfer and other bilateral exchanges within the last month have underscored Tashkent's role as Washington's key partner in Central Asia, according to U.S. officials. However, analysts see the military relationship as largely transactional and shaped by geopolitical complexities and regional tensions.


Talk between diplomats 


In a phone conversation on February 21 with Uzbek Foreign Minister Bakhtiyor Saidov, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio reiterated U.S. support for the country's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, according to State Department's spokesperson Tammy Bruce.


They discussed a joint effort through the C5+1 diplomatic platform, launched nearly a decade ago between Washington and five Central Asian republics. The Trump administration is interested in using this platform to support "a more peaceful and prosperous Central Asia."


Saidov described his talk with Rubio as "candid and productive," aiming to expand the "strategic partnership between our nations in all spheres without an exception. Building strong bridges between business communities, increasing trade volume in both directions, ensuring prosperous development in Central Asia."




Cooperation with Pentagon, ties with Mississippi 


Uzbek Ambassador Furqat Sidikov says his country's forces "have stood shoulder-to-shoulder with the Mississippi National Guard in the best ways," citing joint exercises and Pentagon-sponsored professional exchanges.


"We are a reliable partner of the United States in the region," Sidikov said at a January 31 embassy reception, pointing to defense reforms and improvements in the Uzbek military's equipment.


Mississippi National Guard Adjutant General Major General Bobby Ginn emphasized at the event that since 2012, the partnership has facilitated more than 170 engagements between U.S. and Uzbek soldiers, strengthening disaster response and readiness.




"Uzbekistan's commitment to regional stability and contributions to counterterrorism efforts and border security" demonstrate the power of its armed forces, Ginn said.


Davis Florick, the Pentagon's acting principal director for Eurasia, also attending the reception, thanked Tashkent for "storing" U.S. aircraft and diligently working with America toward the mutually beneficial solution. He confirmed that the seven Black Hawks were part of a fleet from Afghanistan that, according to multiple sources, included 24 helicopters, among them Mi-17s and UH-60s, and 22 fixed-wing aircraft, most of which were transferred to Uzbekistan last year.


Another high-level Pentagon official, Rear Admiral Erin Osborne, speaking at the same gathering, praised Uzbekistan as a "critical ally" that offered its airspace and an air base during the initial years of the U.S. military campaign in Afghanistan. The republic was also part of Pentagon's Northern Distribution Network, delivering nonmilitary goods to the international coalition fighting in the neighboring country.


Osborne said that mutual trust and understanding were reflected in "capacity-building initiatives and the sharing of intelligence to counter common threats."


The U.S., she added, is committed to working with Uzbekistan "to ensure its stability and sovereignty, as well as the stability and sovereignty of the entire Central Asian region."




The Taliban and the Afghanistan factor


Even though the transfer of the Black Hawks back to the U.S. was disclosed at the embassy event, Uzbek officials have been tight-lipped about this collaboration to avoid any tension with the Taliban, which has condemned the handovers as an infringement on Afghanistan's sovereignty. The Taliban's Defense Ministry issued a statement denouncing the transfer as "unacceptable" and demanding the return of the aircraft.


Eighteen U.S. aircraft also ended up in Tajikistan in 2021, but Washington and Dushanbe have yet to settle the matter.


During a visit to the region in June 2022, U.S. Central Command commander General Michael Kurilla said the aircraft would not be returned to Afghanistan "because they do not belong to the Taliban … Our hope is to be able to hand over some or all of the aircraft to the Tajik government."


Washington analysts view Uzbekistan as the most active U.S. military partner in the region, comparing it with the activities other republics in Central Asia have with their state partners, specifically Kazakhstan with Arizona, Tajikistan with Virginia, and Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan with Montana.


Still, they characterize Tashkent-Washington security relationship as more transactional than strategic.


"The Uzbeks want training and equipment. What do we want from them? A reliable partner in the region," said a former U.S. official with extensive experience in Central Asia, speaking to VOA on the condition of anonymity for professional reasons.


The U.S. has trained Uzbek pilots to operate and maintain the transferred aircraft, but continued congressional funding — amounting to several million dollars — is crucial for sustained cooperation.


"There will be questions from Congress, of course," the former official said. "The primary justification so far has been that these assets would help counter extremists from Afghanistan."


Meanwhile, experts in Tashkent support Uzbekistan's cautious approach to the Taliban. As officials have said, Uzbekistan will engage with whoever governs Afghanistan. While it does not officially recognize the Taliban, the administration of President Shavkat Mirziyoyev has forged stable diplomatic relations with Kabul, holds significant investment and business agreements with the country, and provides humanitarian aid to the Afghan people. Last summer, Uzbekistan opened a free economic zone in the city of Termez on the border with Afghanistan, inviting neighbors to foster entrepreneurial cooperation.




U.S. interests and Central Asian security


The U.S. maintains military cooperation agreements with each Central Asian republic, with plans reviewed annually and subject to funding approval.


Despite intelligence-sharing efforts, there is no U.S.-Uzbekistan overflight agreement. Tashkent does not allow its territory to be used for strikes on neighboring soil, even against terrorist targets.


"The Trump administration may question this," said the former U.S. official. "It complicates the case for cooperation with Uzbekistan because they're centrally located, yet we must fly around them. It's hard to justify what we're getting in return."


For years, the U.S. has also supported regional border security initiatives.


"That's the big program," the former U.S. official said, but added: "How many terrorists have we stopped? How many have been disrupted, killed, or captured? Do we have those hard numbers? We are still in the nascent stages of setting up the program."

## Trump urges Musk to be more aggressive in bid to shrink US government

date: 2025-02-22, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday urged billionaire Elon Musk to be more aggressive in his efforts to shrink the federal government despite the uproar over layoffs and deep spending cuts.


"Elon is doing a great job, but I would like to see him get more aggressive," Trump posted all in uppercase letters on his Truth Social platform. "Remember, we have a country to save, but ultimately, to make greater than ever before. MAGA!"


Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE — an entity created by Trump — has swept across federal government agencies, firing tens of thousands of federal government workers, from scientists to park rangers, mostly those on probation.

## Trump-Putin summit preparations are underway, Russia says

date: 2025-02-22, from: VOA News USA

Preparations are underway for a face-to-face meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Russia’s deputy foreign minister said Saturday, marking a clear departure from Western efforts to isolate Moscow over its war in Ukraine.


Speaking to Russian state media, Sergei Ryabkov said a possible Putin-Trump summit could involve broad talks on global issues, not just the war in Ukraine.


“The question is about starting to move toward normalizing relations between our countries, finding ways to resolve the most acute and potentially very, very dangerous situations, of which there are many, Ukraine among them,” he said.


But he said that efforts to organize such a meeting are at an early stage, and that making it happen will require “the most intensive preparatory work."


Ryabkov said that U.S. and Russian envoys could meet “within the next two weeks” to pave the way for further talks between senior officials.


Russian and U.S. representatives meeting in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday agreed to start working toward ending the war in Ukraine and improving their diplomatic and economic ties, an extraordinary about-face in U.S. foreign policy under Trump. Senior U.S. officials have suggested Ukraine will have to give up its goals of joining NATO and retaining the 20% of its territory seized by Russia.


After the meeting, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told the AP that the two sides agreed broadly to pursue three goals: to restore staffing at their respective embassies in Washington and Moscow; to create a high-level team to support Ukraine peace talks; and to explore closer relations and economic cooperation.


He stressed, however, that the talks — which were attended by his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, and other senior Russian and U.S. officials — marked the beginning of a conversation, and that more work needs to be done. Lavrov, for his part, hailed the meeting as “very useful.”


No Ukrainian officials were present at the meeting, which came as the beleaguered country is slowly but steadily losing ground against more-numerous Russian troops, three years after Moscow launched an all-out invasion of its smaller neighbor.


Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country would not accept any outcome from the talks since Kyiv didn’t take part, and he postponed his own trip to Saudi Arabia scheduled for last Wednesday. European allies also have expressed concerns they are being sidelined.


Trump appears to soften Kyiv criticism


Trump on Friday appeared to walk back his earlier comments that falsely blamed Kyiv for starting the war, but he insisted that Zelenskyy and former U.S. President Joe Biden should have done more to come to terms with Putin.


“Russia attacked, but they shouldn’t have let him attack,” he said during a radio interview with Brian Kilmeade of Fox News, referring to the Russian leader.


Russia’s army crossed the border on Feb. 24, 2022, in an all-out invasion that Putin sought to justify by falsely saying it was needed to protect Russian-speaking civilians in eastern Ukraine and prevent the country from joining NATO.


Later on Friday at the Oval Office, Trump told reporters that the war "doesn’t affect the United States very much. It’s on the other side of the ocean. It does affect Europe.”


 




Marches in London to support Ukraine


Thousands of people waving blue-and-yellow Ukrainian flags marched to the Russian Embassy in London on Saturday, demanding Ukraine be given more support and a place at the table in talks to end the three-year war.


Organizers called for the withdrawal of Russian troops and increased military aid to strengthen Kyiv’s hand.


British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is scheduled to visit Washington next week for talks focused on Ukraine. He has emphasized that no decisions about the country’s future can be made without Kyiv’s involvement.


Starmer spoke with Zelenskyy on Saturday and reiterated “the U.K.’s ironclad support for Ukraine and commitment to securing a just and enduring peace to bring an end to Russia’s illegal war,” the prime minister’s office said.

## Amid rising worldwide populism, US conservative conference goes global

date: 2025-02-22, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — This week, thousands of conservative politicians, activists and influencers convened outside Washington for the Conservative Political Action Conference, the premier annual gathering of the American right.


The four-day event, hosted by the American Conservative Union since 1974, features U.S. President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance, among other high-profile speakers from around the world.


Dubbed the "Woodstock for conservatives," CPAC was once the go-to event for conservative Republicans and presidential hopefuls, with its presidential straw poll serving as a barometer of grassroots support. However, Trump's political rise in recent years has transformed it into a platform for populism.


Driven by the rise of populist movements globally, the conference has ventured overseas in the past decade. It launched its first international conference in Japan in 2017, expanded to Australia, Brazil and South Korea in 2019, then added Hungary, Mexico and Israel in 2022. Argentina joined the fold last year following the election of populist President Javier Milei.


The international conferences, CPAC says, serve to "unite conservatives from all over the world, strengthen the movement, and challenge globalism." They are also used for public outreach, recruitment and mobilization, according to a recent paper on CPAC by Grant A. Silverman, a research assistant at George Washington University in Washington.


CPAC's growing international outreach mirrors a recent surge in far-right populism worldwide. Last year's foreign speakers included Presidents Nayib Bukele of El Salvador and Javier Milei of Argentina, as well as Prime Minister Victor Orbán of Hungary.




Here's a look at some of the foreign speakers for this year's CPAC and what they're saying:


Javier Milei, Argentine president


Milei, wielding a chain saw, electrified the CPAC crowd Thursday when he shared the stage with billionaire Elon Musk and presented Musk, Trump's cost-cutting czar, with his signature campaign prop.


"This is the chain saw of bureaucracy," Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, shouted, waving the tool.


As head of the Department of Government Efficiency, Musk, who made his first CPAC appearance, is spearheading the Trump administration's massive governmentwide cost-cutting efforts.


This marks Milei's third CPAC appearance. The self-styled "anarcho-capitalist" campaigned in 2023 on shrinking Argentina's government, often brandishing a chain saw at rallies.


At last year's Washington conference, he vowed to eliminate unnecessary government agencies, declaring, "We will not surrender until we make Argentina great again!"


Speaking at CPAC Argentina in December, Milei declared that the "new winds of freedom are sweeping through the world" and called on allies to fight against "lefties."


"We must stand together, establishing channels of cooperation throughout the world," he told the crowd.


Jair Bolsonaro, former president of Brazil


Brazil's former right-wing president is a CPAC regular. After Bolsonaro lost a reelection bid in 2022, his supporters stormed federal government buildings in an alleged attempt to seize power. Banned from seeking office until 2030, Bolsonaro faces charges of plotting a coup.


His son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, organizes CPAC Brazil. At last year's conference in Balneario Camboriu, the elder Bolsonaro joined Milei and other right-wing politicians from Latin America to hail conservatism's global rise and expressed hope for Trump's return to office.


For his part, Milei used the platform to denounce socialism, saying it restricts liberties and breeds corruption.


Robert Fico, prime minister of Slovakia


Robert Fico makes his CPAC debut this year. Though he leads a left-wing populist party, he has drawn controversy for his attacks on journalists, immigrants and LGBTQ+ people.


In October, he called journalists "bloody bastards" and threatened new media restrictions. An opponent of same-sex marriage, he has called adoption by gay couples a "perversion."


During the Ukraine conflict, Fico has opposed European sanctions on Moscow and echoed Moscow's messaging, drawing comparisons to Hungary's pro-Kremlin prime minister.


In May, he survived an assassination attempt by a gunman opposed to his stance against military assistance to Ukraine.


Mateusz Morawiecki, former Polish prime minister


After speaking at CPAC Hungary last year, Morawiecki makes his first U.S. appearance this year. He served as prime minister from 2017 to 2023 and is now a leading figure in the opposition Law and Justice Party.


Despite his party's strong support for Ukraine, Morawiecki maintains close ties with Hungary's Orban and Spain's Santiago Abascal, leader of the conservative Vox political party. Abascal is an invited speaker at CPAC.


Immigration is a unifying issue for Europe's right-wing populists. At last year's Hungary conference, Morawiecki called Orban his friend and credited his tough response to Europe's 2015 migration crisis with preventing "chaos" in Europe.


Liz Truss, former British prime minister


The former Conservative Party leader and prime minister made her second CPAC appearance in a row Wednesday. Calling Britain a "failed state" ruled by a socialist government, she called for a Trump-style MAGA movement to save it.


"We want a Trump revolution in Britain," she said to applause, praising Trump's second presidency as "the golden age of America."


Blaming Britain's decline on unelected bureaucrats, she urged the dismantlement of the "deep state," a favorite theme among conference attendees.


"We want Elon and his nerd army of muskrats examining the British deep state," Truss said.


Truss served just 49 days as prime minister and lost her Parliament seat last year.

## From VOA Mandarin: Congressman proposes ban on student visas for Chinese nationals

date: 2025-02-22, from: VOA News USA

Congressman Riley Moore recently wrote an op-ed urging the administration to ban all student visas for Chinese nationals to prevent the CCP from using U.S. academic institutions as platforms for espionage. Experts told VOA Mandarin that due to the number of espionage cases Chinese students in the U.S. involved in, it might be more helpful to close the CCP-sponsored Chinese students and scholars' associations on U.S. campuses.

## In CPAC remarks, White House national security adviser pledges crackdown on Mexican cartels

date: 2025-02-22, from: VOA News USA

Politicians, media personalities and conservative activists gathered outside Washington on Friday for the second day of a conference featuring a range of political allies of President Donald Trump.


Speakers at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) heralded the Trump administration’s first month in office, with dozens of executive orders that have proposed sweeping changes to a wide range of government policies and positions on international issues.




Mike Waltz, the president's national security adviser, told the CPAC audience Friday that the Trump administration’s efforts to end the Ukraine war are certain to include U.S. investments in Ukraine’s mineral assets as part of a plan to recoup some funding for Ukraine’s defense.


Earlier this week, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy rejected a proposal that would grant American companies 50% ownership of Ukraine’s rare earth minerals, but Waltz on Friday said the Ukrainian leader “is going to sign” a revised U.S. offer.




Waltz also said the Trump administration plans to “unleash holy hell” on drug cartels. On Wednesday, the State Department designated several Mexican drug cartels as terrorist groups.


Journalist-turned-politician Kari Lake, whom Trump said in December he would like to see lead Voice of America, spoke about what she sees as the president’s wins in his first month in office, and her views on legacy media.


“Watching what President Trump has accomplished and done in one month is so incredible,” Lake said, referring to actions by the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency and the State Department to search for corruption and curtail spending, including by ending foreign aid funding.


A former TV journalist in Arizona for nearly 30 years, Lake spoke of how she quit journalism because of what she felt was disinformation about the coronavirus pandemic.


“We're still surrounded by too many fake journalists out there,” Lake said, adding that she believes the “purpose of the mainstream media is no longer to inform us, it's to manipulate us.”


She criticized Associated Press reporting on government officials and independent bodies who validated the results of the 2020 election, saying, “They still pretend the 2020 election was the most secure election in all of history.”




Lake also said that she is honored that Trump named her to lead VOA, and said she will focus the news agency on producing “accurate and honest reporting.”


“VOA has been telling America's story to the world for 83 years this Monday. Sometimes the coverage has been incredible and sometimes it's been pitiful,” Lake said. “We are fighting an information war, and there's no better weapon than the truth, and I believe VOA could be that weapon.”


Among those who have called for the network to be cut is Musk.


“We won't become Trump TV,” she said, “but it sure as hell will not be ‘TDS TV.’ You can find all the Trump Derangement Syndrome that you want over on CNN, MSNBC, PBS, '60 Minutes,' The Washington Post and The New York Times.”


Trump is expected to address the CPAC gathering on Saturday.

## Ukraine marks war’s 3rd anniversary as US support wavers

date: 2025-02-22, from: VOA News USA

Uncertainty looms over U.S.-Ukraine relations as Ukraine enters the fourth year of war with Russia. Recent shifts in Washington’s rhetoric have raised fears that Ukraine could be pressured into an unfavorable peace deal -- or be left to confront Russia without U.S. support. While most Ukrainians are now in favor of peace talks, many insist any settlement be on Ukraine’s terms. Myroslava Gongadze has the story from Warsaw, Poland, with reporting from Anna Chernikova in Kyiv, Ukraine.

## A brewing legal battle and the future of the Fed

<p>The Supreme Court on Friday chose not to intervene in a case involving President Donald Trump&#8217;s firing of an independent agency head.

## Trump fires chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump abruptly fired Air Force General CQ Brown as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on Friday, sidelining a history-making fighter pilot and respected officer as part of a campaign to rid the military of leaders who support diversity and equity in the ranks.


The ouster of Brown, only the second Black general to serve as chairman, is sure to send shock waves through the Pentagon. His 16 months in the job had been consumed with the war in Ukraine and the expanded conflict in the Middle East.


"I want to thank General Charles 'CQ' Brown for his over 40 years of service to our country, including as our current Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He is a fine gentleman and an outstanding leader, and I wish a great future for him and his family," Trump posted on social media.


Trump said he was nominating Air Force Lieutenant General Dan "Razin" Caine to be the next chairman.


Trump acted despite support for Brown among key members of Congress and a seemingly friendly meeting with him in mid-December, when the two were seated next to each other for a time at the Army-Navy football game. Brown had been meeting regularly with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who took over the top Pentagon job just four weeks ago.

## AP sues White House officials over denial of access

date: 2025-02-22, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The Associated Press filed a lawsuit against three White House officials on Friday after the news agency was barred from some of U.S. President Donald Trump's events.


The AP, in the suit filed in a federal court in Washington, said the denial of access violates the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which guarantees freedom of speech and of the press.


The White House began blocking AP journalists from the Oval Office 10 days ago over the news agency's refusal to follow Trump's executive order renaming the Gulf of Mexico the "Gulf of America."


The ban on AP reporters was later extended to Air Force One.

The news group said it was bringing the suit against three Trump administration officials to "vindicate its rights to the editorial independence guaranteed by the United States Constitution."


"The White House has ordered The Associated Press to use certain words in its coverage or else face an indefinite denial of access," the AP said.


"The press and all people in the United States have the right to choose their own words and not be retaliated against by the government," it said.


"The Constitution does not allow the government to control speech. Allowing such government control and retaliation to stand is a threat to every American's freedom."


The suit names as defendants White House chief of staff Susan Wiles and deputy chief of staff Taylor Budowich, as well as White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.


"We'll see them in court," Leavitt said during an appearance Friday at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington.


"We feel we are in the right. We are going to ensure that truth and accuracy is present at that White House every single day," she said.


In its style guide, the AP noted that the Gulf of Mexico has "carried that name for more than 400 years."


"The Associated Press will refer to it by its original name while acknowledging the new name Trump has chosen," it said.


"As a global news agency that disseminates news around the world, the AP must ensure that place names and geography are easily recognizable to all audiences."


Trump called the AP a "radical left organization" on Thursday and said the new Gulf of America name is "something that we feel strongly about."


His leveraging of press access underscores the Republican president's long-standing animosity toward traditional news outlets, which he accuses of bias against him.


The White House Correspondents' Association has called AP's exclusion from Trump events outrageous.


The 180-year-old news agency has long been a pillar of U.S. journalism and provides news to print, TV and radio outlets across the United States and around the world.


Voice of America subscribes to The Associated Press, which provides video, audio and written content.

## Los Angeles mayor ousts fire chief for response to deadly fires

date: 2025-02-21, from: VOA News USA

LOS ANGELES — Six weeks after the most destructive wildfire in city history, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass ousted the city's fire chief Friday amid a public rift over preparations for a potential fire and finger-pointing between the chief and City Hall over responsibility for the devastation.


Bass said in a statement that she is removing Chief Kristin Crowley immediately.


"Bringing new leadership to the Fire Department is what our city needs," Bass said in a statement.


"We know that 1,000 firefighters that could have been on duty on the morning the fires broke out were instead sent home on Chief Crowley's watch," Bass disclosed. She added that the chief refused a request to prepare an "after-action report" on the fires, which she called a necessary step in the investigation.


The Palisades Fire began during heavy winds Jan. 7, destroying or damaging nearly 8,000 homes, businesses and other structures and killing at least 12 people in the Los Angeles neighborhood.


Another wind-whipped fire started the same day in suburban Altadena, a community to the east, killing at least 17 people and destroying or damaging more than 10,000 homes and other buildings.


Bass has been facing criticism for being in Africa as part of a presidential delegation on the day the fires started, even though weather reports had warned of dangerous fire conditions in the days before she left.


In televised interviews this week, Bass acknowledged she made a mistake by leaving the city. But she inferred she wasn't aware of the looming danger when she flew around the globe to attend the inauguration of Ghanaian President John Dramani Mahama. She faulted Crowley for failing to alert her to the potentially explosive fire conditions.


Crowley has publicly criticized the city for budget cuts that she said made it harder for firefighters to do their jobs.


Crowley was named fire chief in 2022 by Bass' predecessor at a time when the department was in turmoil over allegations of rampant harassment, hazing and discrimination. She worked for the city fire department for more than 25 years and held nearly every role, including fire marshal, engineer and battalion chief.

## Nearly 100 cases of measles reported in Texas, New Mexico

date: 2025-02-21, from: VOA News USA

The measles outbreak in rural West Texas has grown to 90 cases across seven counties, the state health department posted online Friday, and 16 people are hospitalized. 


In neighboring eastern New Mexico, the measles case count is up to nine, though state public health officials said Thursday there's still no evidence this outbreak is connected to the one in Texas. 


The West Texas cases are concentrated in eight counties in West Texas.  


Texas state health department data shows that most of the cases are among people younger than 18. Twenty-six cases are in kids younger than 4 and 51 are in kids 5-17 years old. Ten adults have measles, and three cases are pending an age determination. The Ector County Health Department told the Odessa American its case was in a child too young to be vaccinated. 


State health officials have said this outbreak is Texas' largest in nearly 30 years. Health department spokeswoman Lara Anton said last week that cases have been concentrated in a "close-knit, undervaccinated" Mennonite community — especially among families who attend small private religious schools or are homeschooled. 


In New Mexico, all of the cases are in Lea County, which borders Gaines County in Texas. The state health department has said people may have been exposed at a grocery store, an elementary school, a church, hospital and a pharmacy in Hobbs, New Mexico. 


Measles is a highly contagious respiratory virus that can survive in the air for up to two hours. Up to 9 out of 10 people who are susceptible will get the virus if exposed, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 


Most kids will recover from the measles if they get it, but infection can lead to dangerous complications like pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling and death. 


The vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella is safe and highly effective in preventing measles infection and severe cases of the disease. 


The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old. The vaccine series is required for kids before entering kindergarten in public schools nationwide. 


Before the vaccine was introduced in 1963, the U.S. saw some 3 million to 4 million cases per year. Now, it's usually fewer than 200 in a normal year. 


There is no link between the vaccine and autism, despite a now-discredited study and health disinformation. 


In communities with high vaccination rates — above 95% — diseases like measles have a harder time spreading through communities. This is called "herd immunity." 


But childhood vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the pandemic and more parents are claiming religious or personal conscience waivers to exempt their kids from required shots. 


The U.S. saw a rise in measles cases in 2024, including an outbreak in Chicago that sickened more than 60.  


Gaines County has one of the highest rates in Texas of school-aged children who opt out of at least one required vaccine, with nearly 14% of K-12 children in the 2023-24 school year. Health officials say that number is likely higher because it doesn't include many children who are homeschooled and whose data would not be reported. 


Health workers are hosting regular vaccination clinics and screening efforts in Texas, as well as working with schools to educate people about the importance of vaccination and offering shots. 


New Mexico health officials are also hosting several vaccination clinics in Hobbs next week.

## US states push back against possible election security changes

date: 2025-02-21, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON  — Moves by U.S. President Donald Trump to potentially gut programs aimed at supporting election security are not sitting well with key state election officials, who are now asking the Trump administration to reconsider.


The National Association of Secretaries of State sent a letter Friday to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem warning that changes to the department’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency could endanger future elections.


“Information technology systems related to election administration have long been targeted by sophisticated cyber threat actors including nation-state and cybercriminal groups,” according to the letter, signed by NASS president, Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon and NASS president-elect, Mississippi Secretary of State Michael Watson.


“CISA’s prioritized services help election entities defend against these national security threats,” they added.


NASS is a bipartisan group that represents chief election officials from nearly 40 U.S. states. Simon is a Democrat. Watson is a Republican.


The letter says that while U.S. elections “firmly remain a state and local responsibility,” several initiatives from CISA have provided valuable services and allowed for the sharing of critical information for states that choose to participate.


It lists cybersecurity services, physical security assessments, information through the Election Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis Center (EI-ISAC), classified and unclassified intelligence briefings and on-the-ground incident response services as among the programs that NASS members would like to continue.


VOA has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security about the letter but has not received a response.


CISA was formally created in 2018, charged with protecting the country’s critical infrastructure. It has also served as a lead agency on election security. DHS officials announced a review of the agency earlier this month citing what they described as a need for CISA “to refocus on its mission.”


“The agency is undertaking an evaluation of how it has executed its election security mission with a particular focus on any work related to mis-, dis-, and mal-information,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin.


According to DHS, as of mid-February, more than 130 CISA employees had been placed on administrative leave.


NASS expressed hope some of the election related programs can be preserved, offering to meet with DHS officials, including Noem.


“[We] respect your authority to reassess existing priorities, structures, staffing, and missions,” the NASS letter said. “We favor continuity of the core resources above and welcome the opportunity as Chief Election Officials to discuss any potential changes or impacts to election security-related services before making a final decision.”

## Trump says he expects Ukraine will accept mineral deal soon

date: 2025-02-21, from: VOA News USA

U.S. President Donald Trump said Friday that he expects Ukraine to accept soon a proposed deal that would include U.S. investments in its mineral assets to help recoup some U.S. defense funding. 


"We're signing an agreement, hopefully in the next fairly short period of time, that will assure us that we'll get four or $500 billion back" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office when asked about a potential deal.  


"It's a big deal, but they [Ukrainians] want it, and it keeps us in that country," he said, adding "we get our money back. This should have been signed long before we went in." 


The Trump administration has proposed the rare earth mineral deal as part of a larger negotiation toward ending the war in Ukraine. 


The president's comments follow reports that his administration has presented Kyiv with a revised version of a minerals agreement after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy rejected the initial proposal. 


U.S. national security adviser Mike Waltz made similar comments earlier Friday at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington.  


"Well, look, here's the bottom line: President Zelenskyy is going to sign that deal. And you will see that in the very short term. And that is good for Ukraine," he said. 




The discussion about a mineral deal follows sharp exchanges this week between Trump and Zelenskyy. The Ukrainian president, responding to Trump's suggestion that Ukraine started the war with Russia, said the U.S. president was living in a Russian-influenced "disinformation space." 

 

Trump countered on his Truth Social platform, calling Zelenskyy a "dictator without elections."  

 

On Friday, Trump referenced his indirect exchanges with Zelenskyy while making comments to a gathering of the Republican State Governors Association at the White House. The president described having "very good talks with [Russian President Vladimir] Putin," and "not such good talks with Ukraine." He mentioned how Ukraine talks "tough" but does not have a lot of bargaining chips. 


Diplomatic bomb 


On Monday, the international community will hold a meeting in the United Nations General Assembly marking the third anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine, with the support of the European Union, has circulated a draft resolution it plans to put to a vote at the session.  


The document stresses "the urgent need to end the war this year" through a "comprehensive, just and lasting peace" based on the principles of the U.N. Charter and calls for the full withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine "within its internationally recognized borders." 


However, Ukraine's plans were upended late Friday, when the Trump administration circulated their own draft resolution. Entitled "The Path to Peace," the 65-word text mourns "the tragic loss of life throughout the Russia-Ukraine conflict" and "implores a swift end to the conflict and further urges a lasting peace between Ukraine and Russia." 


Diplomats said European ambassadors were meeting to discuss the surprise move, which could hurt support for their text or even force them to abandon the effort altogether. 


Russia's envoy told reporters the U.S. draft is "a good move." 


"But there is one important point missing," Vassily Nebenzia said. "The root causes. We should address the root causes."   


His delegation circulated an amendment to Washington's text adding such a statement. 


Moscow has long attempted to justify its illegal invasion of Ukraine by saying Russian-speaking minorities in eastern Ukraine have been persecuted by the Kyiv government. The Kremlin also has accused the Ukrainian government of being "Nazis" and "fascists."  


Moscow has also decried what it says is NATO expansionism into its neighborhood. 


Richard Gowan, U.N. director for the International Crisis Group, said on social media platform X that he expects "the EU and Ukraine to table counter-amendments and make the U.S. text unworkable." 


Ongoing discussions 


Trump sent his special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, retired U.S. Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg, for meetings Thursday with Zelenskyy in Kyiv, Ukraine. Comments following that meeting indicated the relationship between the U.S. and Ukraine was being smoothed over. 


On his X social media account, Zelenskyy had only positive things to say. 


"My meeting with General Kellogg was one that restores hope, and we need strong agreements with the U.S. — agreements that will truly work," Zelenskyy said. "I have instructed my team to work quickly and very sensibly." 


Kellogg, from his X account, re-posted Zelenskyy's comments, and stated, "Extensive and positive discussions with [President Zelenskyy], the embattled and courageous leader of a nation at war and his talented national security team." 


 


Much of the tension this past week surrounded talks about the war in Ukraine between a U.S. delegation led by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and their Russian counterparts in Saudi Arabia. No Ukrainian or European representatives were present. 


Rubio later noted that the meeting did not involve any fine points of a deal. 


When Trump was asked by reporters Friday if he would be going to Moscow, the president dismissed such reports, saying "No, no I'm not." 


Ukraine fears that Trump is moving to settle the war on terms that could be more favorable to Moscow. Russia currently controls about a fifth of Ukraine's internationally recognized territory.


European leaders have responded to Trump's recent remarks about Ukraine by pledging to step up spending on defense, and some are considering a U.S.-backed European peacekeeping force for the country if the fighting ends. The Kremlin says the plan is a major cause for concern, but Zelenskyy and NATO have welcomed it.

## Suspect found guilty of attempted murder in author Salman Rushdie attack

date: 2025-02-21, from: VOA News USA

MAYVILLE, NEW YORK  — A New Jersey man was convicted Friday of attempted murder for stabbing author Salman Rushdie multiple times on a New York lecture stage in 2022.


Jurors, who deliberated for less than two hours, also found Hadi Matar, 27, guilty of assault for wounding a man who was on stage with Rushdie at the time.


Matar ran onto the stage at the Chautauqua Institution where Rushdie was about to speak on Aug. 12, 2022, and stabbed him more than a dozen times before a live audience. The attack left the 77-year-old prizewinning novelist blind in one eye.

Rushdie was the key witness during seven days of testimony, describing in graphic detail his life-threatening injuries and long and painful recovery.


Matar, sitting at the defense table, looked down but had no obvious reaction when the jury delivered the verdict. As he was led out of the courtroom in handcuffs, he quietly uttered, "Free Palestine," echoing comments he has frequently made while entering and leaving the trial.


His public defender, Nathaniel Barone, said Matar was disappointed but also well-prepared for the verdict.


District Attorney Jason Schmidt played a slow-motion video of the attack for the jury Friday during his closing argument, pointing out the assailant as he emerged from the audience, walked up a staircase to the stage and broke into a run toward Rushdie.


"I want you to look at the unprovoked nature of this attack," Schmidt said. "I want you to look at the targeted nature of the attack. There were a lot of people around that day but there was only one person who was targeted."


Assistant public defender Andrew Brautigan told the jury that prosecutors have not proved that Matar intended to kill Rushdie. The distinction is important for an attempted-murder conviction.


"You will agree something bad happened to Mr. Rushdie, but you don't know what Mr. Matar's conscious objective was," Brautigan said.


Matar had knives with him but no gun or bomb, his attorneys have said previously. And in response to testimony that the injuries were life-threatening, they have noted that Rushdie's heart and lungs were uninjured.


Schmidt said while it's not possible to read Matar's mind, "it's foreseeable that if you're going to stab someone 10 or 15 times about the face and neck, it's going to result in a fatality."


Schmidt reminded jurors about the testimony of a trauma surgeon, who said Rushdie's injuries would have been fatal without quick treatment.


He also slowed down video showing Matar approaching the seated Rushdie from behind and reaching around him to stab at his torso with a knife. Rushdie raises his arms and rises from his seat, walking and stumbling for a few steps with Matar hanging on, swinging and stabbing until they both fall and are surrounded by onlookers who rush in to separate them.


Rushdie is seen flailing on the ground, waving a hand covered in bright red blood. Schmidt freezes on a frame showing Rushdie, his face also bloodied, as he's surrounded by people.


"We've shown you intent," Schmidt said.


The recordings also picked up the gasps and screams from audience members who had been seated to hear Rushdie speak with City of Asylum Pittsburgh founder Henry Reese about keeping writers safe. Reese suffered a gash to his forehead, leading to the assault charge against Matar.


The judge set sentencing for April 23. Matar could receive up to 25 years in prison.

## 'Lack of consensus' as G20 meets amid turbulent times

date: 2025-02-21, from: VOA News USA

JOHANNESBURG — The two-day Group of 20 foreign ministers meeting wrapped up in Johannesburg on Friday. Aimed at addressing global problems, the talks between the world’s wealthiest countries instead underscored the fault lines in the current geopolitical climate.


Despite the warm welcome foreign dignitaries received at the meeting in Johannesburg, hosted by current G20 president South Africa, tensions were apparent before the event even got underway.


U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced earlier this month he was boycotting the meeting, citing what he called the “anti-Americanism” on the agenda. These topics included climate change and equality for developing nations.




South African President Cyril Ramaphosa addressed the discord head on in his opening speech, saying the world was under threat from rising intolerance and wars.


“Yet there is a lack of consensus among major powers, including the G20, on how to respond to these issues of global significance,” Ramaphosa said.


Even a planned group photo fell through, though no official explanation was given for its last-minute cancellation.

Steven Gruzd, an analyst at the South African Institute of International Affairs, spoke about the challenges the meeting presented.


“South Africa’s had a very difficult job of getting countries that are ideologically very far apart around the same table,” he said.


South Africa has been under fire from the new U.S. administration, which accuses the government of land grabs, an accusation South Africa strongly denies. President Donald Trump recently cut financial assistance to the country over the allegations.


Washington sent U.S. Embassy Charge d’Affaires Dana Brown in Rubio’s place. The embassy declined VOA’s request for an interview.


But there were statements of support for South Africa leading the G20 from several European foreign ministers.

Russia and China also sent their top envoys.


In his remarks at the meeting, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi expressed his support for South Africa’s G20 presidency.


He also noted that, “the current international landscape is marked by transformation and turbulence.” He added, China will “work with all parties” on world peace, security and multilateralism.


One topic that dominated at the meeting was Ukraine. The foreign ministers gathered days after Trump upended U.S. policy on the war, suggesting Ukraine was to blame for Russia’s 2022 invasion and labeling one-time U.S. ally Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a “dictator.”


Retired U.S. diplomat Brooks Spector said, “Now that President Trump has effectively ended the general Western consensus on Ukraine, it’s obviously fallen to the European nations to be the primary source of support for Ukraine and its president and in fact its struggle against Russia.”


The E.U. has indeed rallied in support of Zelenskyy after Trump’s comments. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot, speaking on the sidelines of the meeting, voiced his concerns.


“A capitulation of Ukraine today would set a terrible example for every country in the world that would be under the threat of predation by its bigger neighbor,” he said. “Is this the world in which we want to live?”


However, in his closing remarks South African foreign minister Ronald Lamola put a positive spin on things, saying the meeting had been an overall success and delegates had held "productive" talks.

## Judge cancels New York City mayor’s trial, keeps corruption charges intact

date: 2025-02-21, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — A federal judge on Friday canceled the corruption trial of New York City Mayor Eric Adams. The judge also appointed counsel to advise him on how to handle the Justice Department's controversial request to drop charges against the Democrat. 


Judge Dale E. Ho's written order means he won't decide before mid-March whether to grant the dismissal of the case against the mayor of the nation's largest city. 


At a hearing Wednesday, Acting Deputy U.S. Attorney General Emil Bove cited an executive order by President Donald Trump outlining his criminal justice priorities as he defended the request to drop charges. 


Adams confirmed at the hearing that he accepted that charges could later be reinstated. Critics suggest that the mayor would be required to carry out Trump's plans to round up New Yorkers who are in the country illegally if he wanted to remain free from prosecution. 


The request is "virtually unreviewable in this courtroom," Bove argued. 


Adams was indicted in September and accused of accepting more than $100,000 in illegal campaign contributions and travel perks from a Turkish official and business leaders seeking to buy influence while he was Brooklyn borough president. He faces multiple challengers in June's Democratic primary. He has pleaded not guilty and has insisted on his innocence. 


On Friday, the judge said he'd appointed Paul Clement, a former U.S. solicitor general and acting U.S. attorney general, as amicus curiae to present arguments on the government's request to throw out the charges. 


Ho said he wanted all parties and Clement to address the legal standard for dismissing charges, whether a court may consider materials beyond the motion itself and under what circumstances additional procedural steps and further inquiry would be necessary. 


He also said he wants to know under what circumstances dismissal can occur without the ability to reinstate charges or with the ability to reinstate charges. He scheduled briefs to be filed by March 7 and, if necessary, oral arguments to occur on March 14. 


Late Thursday, three former U.S. attorneys — from New York, Connecticut and New Jersey — submitted a letter urging Ho to "hear from parties other than the government and the defendant in deciding about the appropriate next steps."  


Adams will not be required to attend future hearings, the judge said. 


That could help mitigate some political damage for Adams as he could avoid being hauled back to court for hearings while he tries to convince the public that the case isn't distracting him from running the city. 


Adams has sought to project calm as questions over his independence have sparked a political crisis in his administration. 


This week, four of his top deputies resigned and Gov. Kathy Hochul announced that she had for now decided against removing Adams from office but would instead propose legislation to enhance state oversight of City Hall as a way to reestablish trust with New Yorkers.

## US Treasury’s Bessent, China’s He trade economic complaints in call

date: 2025-02-21, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent traded policy complaints with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng on Friday, with Bessent telling Beijing to do more to curb fentanyl trafficking and rebalance its economy, and He voicing concerns about President Donald Trump’s new tariffs, the two governments said.


The top economic officials from the world’s two largest economies agreed to keep up communications, the Treasury said in a readout of the introductory video call.


“Secretary Bessent expressed serious concerns about the PRC’s counternarcotics efforts, economic imbalances, and unfair policies, and stressed the Administration’s commitment to pursue trade and economic policies that protect the American economy, the American worker, and our national security,” the Treasury said, using the acronym for China’s official name, the People’s Republic of China.


Earlier, Chinese state media reported that He expressed concerns to Bessent over U.S. tariffs and trade restrictions on China during the call.


The two sides had an “in-depth” exchange of views on important issues in China-U.S. economic relations, and both agreed to keep communicating on matters of mutual concern, according to a readout released by Chinese state media.


He, the lead China-U.S. trade negotiator on the Chinese side, and Bessent recognized the importance of bilateral economic and trade relations, the readout said.


More tariffs


China and the United States are seeking to manage their relationship as they stand on the precipice of a renewed trade war.


Trump imposed 10% tariffs on all Chinese goods in early February, citing China's failure to stanch fentanyl trafficking.


Beijing retaliated by imposing targeted tariffs of up to 15% on some U.S. imports, including energy and farm equipment, and put several companies, including Google, on notice for possible sanctions.


Trump has also planned further reciprocal tariffs for all countries that tax U.S. imports, a move that is likely to further escalate global trade tensions. During his election campaign, Trump threatened 60% tariffs on all Chinese imports.


Trump said earlier this week he expected Chinese President Xi Jinping to visit the U.S., without giving a timeline for such a trip.


Bessent said on Thursday he would tell his Chinese counterpart that China needed to rebalance its economy and rely more on domestic consumption for growth and less on investment and exports.


“They are suppressing the consumer in favor of the business community,” Bessent told Bloomberg Television.


Similar arguments


The U.S. had a $295.4 billion goods trade deficit with China in 2024, down from a peak of $418.2 billion in 2018, the year Trump began imposing new tariffs on some $370 billion of Chinese imports.


But last year’s deficit rose $16.3 billion from 2023 as Chinese exporters rushed to beat a new round of Trump tariffs.


Bessent’s predecessor, former Treasury secretary Janet Yellen, met several times with He in recent years and lodged similar complaints about China’s state-led economic policies.


She argued during a trip to China last year that those policies were leading to excess production capacity that was threatening the viability of firms in the U.S. and other market economies, a warning that laid the groundwork for former President Joe Biden’s steep tariff hikes on electric vehicles, semiconductors and solar products.


He and other Chinese officials never accepted U.S. excess capacity assertions, arguing that China’s EV and other key industries are simply more competitive.

## Four scenarios for securing peace in Ukraine

date: 2025-02-21, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump is pushing for a peaceful resolution to Russia’s now three-year full-scale war in Ukraine. VOA examined several approaches floated by think tanks recently aimed at achieving a lasting peace to the war.


Maximum pressure strategy


A plan by the Center for European Policy Analysis, or CEPA, titled “How to Win: A Seven-Point Plan for Sustainable Peace in Ukraine,” calls for “a maximum pressure strategy to bring Russia to the negotiating table in good faith.”


It proposes that the U.S. and its allies:



	“Should provide immediate materiel support to Ukraine without caveats, aiming to wear down Russia’s military and thereby improve Ukraine’s negotiating position.”
	“Should increase sanctions on Russian financial institutions and energy sector entities, release frozen Russian assets to support Ukrainian defense and reconstruction and enact secondary sanctions to intensify economic pressure not only on Russia but also on the authoritarian regimes of China, Iran, and North Korea.”


 


CEPA says that “Ukraine and Europe” must be included in any peace talks with Russia, that the U.S. should support “a European-led coalition of the willing” to enforce any “ceasefire line with an international force,” and that “European allies must make consistent and as rapid as possible progress toward Ukraine’s accession to the European Union.”


One of the report’s authors, Catherine Sendak, CEPA’s director for transatlantic defense and security, told VOA’s Ukrainian service that the United States should enter talks with Russia only having “equipped Ukraine with the strongest possible means” and using its toughest “diplomatic tools.”


She added that the issue of Ukraine’s possible membership in NATO should not be included in talks with Russia. “To discuss that with a non-NATO member … I don’t believe it is advantageous to any negotiation,” Sendak said, noting that it would give Russia “veto power, if you will, over … choosing members to join the alliance or not.”


Negotiating tactics


Josh Rudolph, a German Marshall Fund senior fellow and head of its Transatlantic Democracy Working Group, worked on Russian and Ukrainian policy at the National Security Council during the first Trump administration.


Last month, he offered policy recommendations to the current Trump administration on ending the Ukraine conflict.


Among them:



	“Approach [Russian President Vladimir] Putin from a position of strength. Whereas Putin looked tough and capable at the outset of Trump’s first term, his blunder in Ukraine has left him diminished. … As the dominant partner in this relationship, Trump, not Putin, can set negotiating terms.”
	“Know when to walk away. A critical moment in the negotiations will come when Putin refuses to make major concessions. Trump must be prepared to walk away.”
	“Combine sanctions with lower oil and gas prices. The best way to make Putin to see that pressing on in Ukraine would spell disaster for his rule is to pressure Russia financially. … Harnessing his warmer relationship with Saudi Arabia than [former President Joe] Biden enjoyed, Trump should flood the fossil fuel market, which would make the sanctions sustainable, starve Russia’s war machine, and generate political stability risks in Moscow.”


 


Rudolph also recommended arming Ukraine “to the hilt”; giving it “all $300 billion of Russia’s frozen assets”; making Europe “pay more for weapons” and provide 100,000 troops as “peacekeepers”; enabling “American companies to rebuild Ukraine”; and inviting Ukraine to join NATO should Putin refuse to accept “reasonable” peace deal terms.


Rudolph told VOA that Trump could convince those in the U.S. now skeptical of continuing to arm Ukraine that doing so as part of a peace deal would benefit American workers.


“[H]e tells them, OK, now we’ve got a good deal, it’s secured by rare earth [minerals], it has ended the war, and in order to hold it together, we’re going to need to provide a continued stream of good old American-made weapons, which by the way, create all of these American jobs and facilities and factories across red states.”


Touting economic benefits


In a report titled “Dollars and Sense: America’s Interest in a Ukrainian Victory,” Elaine McCusker, Frederick W. Kagan and Richard Sims of the American Enterprise Institute looked at the cost of ending support for Ukraine, concluding that this would lead to Ukraine’s defeat and Russia’s advance farther into Europe, forcing the U.S. to surge its presence in Europe.


Among the report’s conclusions:



	“Supporting Ukraine to victory against Russia is in the best interest of the United States.”
	“A world in which Russia prevails would be more dangerous and more expensive for America — requiring an estimated increase of $808 billion in defense spending over five years.”
	“Alternatively, an increased and accelerated multinational commitment to Ukraine and the conclusion of the war in the near term would result in a vibrant and free Ukraine with a newly modernized and battle-tested military and a thriving industrial base, which would help stabilize Europe.”


 


In an interview with VOA, Frederick Kagan said a Russian victory in Ukraine would be a victory for Iran, China and North Korea, encouraging adventurism in their respective regions, and allow Russia to rebuild its army by obtaining additional human and material resources within Ukraine.


A Russian takeover of Ukraine would send a wave of refugees into Europe, further destabilizing the continent, Kagan said.


“They’ve committed atrocities on the Ukrainian population in the areas they occupy. I would expect that would get worse the further west the Russians move and the more they move into the hardest traditional anti-Russian, pro-Western areas of western Ukraine. The horrors will be unspeakable,” he predicted.


He said surged assistance to Ukraine would turn it into a bulwark for European peace and security — a country with a battle-tested army and rapidly developing military industry — thereby allowing the U.S. to focus on other regions.


Middle road approach


The Heritage Foundation’s “Project 2025 Presidential Transition Project” includes policy recommendations concerning the Russia-Ukraine war.


It noted that the American conservative movement is split over Ukraine — one side supports Kyiv, the other favors walking away — and offered a middle road.


Among Project 2025’s recommendations:



	"With respect to Ukraine, continued U.S. involvement must be fully paid for; limited to military aid (while European allies address Ukraine’s economic needs); and have a clearly defined national security strategy that does not risk American lives.”
	“Regardless of viewpoints, all sides agree that Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is unjust and that the Ukrainian people have a right to defend their homeland. The conflict has severely weakened Putin’s military strength and provided a boost to NATO unity and its importance to European nations.”
	“The next conservative president has a generational opportunity to bring resolution to the foreign policy tensions within the movement and chart a new path forward that recognizes Communist China as the defining threat to U.S. interests in the 21st century.”


 


James Carafano, a national security expert at The Heritage Foundation who is responsible for its defense and foreign policy team, told VOA that it is in the U.S. interest to have a free and independent Ukraine that can defend itself.


“For the practical matter is, the United Europe can defend itself, and the United States can defend Europe if Ukraine’s occupied by Russia. Now, having said that, are we … way, way better off with the Russians on the other side of Ukraine? And the answer is ‘absolutely.’”




In July, VOA published an interview with retired Army Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg, serving as Trump’s envoy for Ukraine and Russia, that focused on his vision of ending the war in Ukraine.

## Rubio highlights emerging terror threat in Afghanistan

date: 2025-02-21, from: VOA News USA

ISLAMABAD — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggested late Thursday there are ungoverned regions in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan that provide opportunities for extremist groups to operate.


The comments came in an interview with former CBS correspondent Catherine Herridge on X, where Rubio was asked if intelligence indicates that al-Qaida and Islamic State had set up safe havens in Afghanistan, posing a threat comparable to the one preceding the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.


“I wouldn’t say it’s the pre-9/11 landscape, but I think anytime you have governing spaces that are contested that you don’t have a government that has full control of every part of their territory, it creates the opportunity for these groups,” Rubio said.


“The difference between today and 10 years ago is that we don’t have American elements on the ground to target and go after them,” the top U.S. diplomat noted.


Rubio added that in some cases, the Taliban has been cooperative when “told that ISIS or al-Qaida is operating in this part of your country” and to go after them. Not so much in other cases, he said.


“So, I would say that I wouldn’t compare it to pre-9/11, but it’s certainly far more uncertain — and it’s not just limited to Afghanistan,” Rubio said.


The Taliban did not immediately respond to Rubio’s remarks, but they have persistently claimed to be in control of the entire country and rejected that any foreign terrorist organizations are on Afghan soil.




Rubio’s comments came just days after the United Nations reported that al-Qaida operatives continued to find shelter across Afghanistan under the protection of the Taliban's intelligence agency.


“The Taliban maintained a permissive environment allowing al-Qaida to consolidate, with the presence of safe houses and training camps scattered across Afghanistan,” read the report.


It also described an Afghan-based Islamic State affiliate, the Islamic State-Khorasan, or IS-K, as “the greatest extra-regional terrorist threat.”


The U.N. assessment highlighted that in addition to attacks on Taliban authorities and Afghan religious minorities, IS-K supporters conducted strikes as far away as Europe, and that the group “was actively seeking to recruit from among Central Asian states” bordering Afghanistan.


The Taliban militarily swept back to power in August 2021 when the then-Afghan government collapsed as all U.S.-led NATO allied troops withdrew from the country after a nearly two-decade-long presence.

## US tax agency fires 6,000 amid federal government downsizing

date: 2025-02-21, from: VOA News USA

A tearful executive at the U.S. Internal Revenue Service told staffers on Thursday that about 6,000 employees would be fired, a person familiar with the matter said, in a move that would eliminate roughly 6% of the agency's workforce in the midst of the busy tax-filing season.


The cuts are part of President Donald Trump's sweeping downsizing effort that has targeted bank regulators, forest workers, rocket scientists and tens of thousands of other government employees. The effort is being led by tech billionaire Elon Musk, Trump's biggest campaign donor.


Musk was on stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor, Maryland, when Argentine President Javier Milei, known for wielding a chain saw to illustrate his drastic policies slashing government spending, handed him one.


"This is the chain saw for bureaucracy," said Musk, holding the power tool aloft as a stage prop to symbolize the drastic slashing of government jobs.


Labor unions have sued to try to stop the mass firings, under which tens of thousands of federal workers have been told they no longer have a job, but a federal judge in Washington on Thursday ruled that they can continue for now.


Christy Armstrong, IRS director of talent acquisition, teared up as she told employees on a phone call that about 6,000 of their colleagues would be laid off and encouraged them to support each other, a worker who was on the call said.


"She was pretty emotional," the worker said.


The layoffs are expected to total 6,700, according to a person familiar with the matter, and largely target workers at the agency hired as part of an expansion under Democratic President Joe Biden, who had sought to expand enforcement efforts on wealthy taxpayers. Republicans have opposed the expansion, arguing that it would lead to harassment of ordinary Americans.




The tax agency now employs roughly 100,000 people, compared with 80,000 before Biden took office in 2021.


Independent budget analysts had estimated that the staff expansion under Biden would work to boost government revenue and help narrow trillion-dollar budget deficits.


"This will ensure that the IRS is not going after the wealthy and is only an agency that's really focused on the low income," said University of Pittsburgh tax law professor, Philip Hackney, a former IRS lawyer. "It's a travesty."


Those fired include revenue agents, customer-service workers, specialists who hear appeals of tax disputes, and IT workers, and impact employees across all 50 states, sources said. The IRS did not respond to a request for comment.


The IRS has taken a more careful approach to downsizing than other agencies, given that it is in the middle of the tax-filing season. The agency expects to process more than 140 million individual returns by the April 15 filing deadline and will retain several thousand workers deemed critical for that task, one source said.


The Trump administration's federal layoffs have focused on workers across the government who are new to their positions and have fewer protections than longer-tenured employees.


Meanwhile, the Trump White House is also preparing to dissolve the leadership of the U.S. Postal Service and absorb the independent agency into the Commerce Department, the Washington Post reported on Thursday.


Waiting for dismissal email


At the IRS's Kansas City office, probationary workers found all functions had been disabled on their computers except email, which would deliver their dismissal notices, said Shannon Ellis, a local union leader.


"What the American people really need to understand is that the funds that are collected through the Internal Revenue Service, they fund so many programs that we use every day in our society," Ellis told Reuters.


The White House has not said how many of the nation's 2.3 million civil-service workers it wants to fire and has given no numbers on the mass layoffs. Roughly 75,000 took a buyout offer last week.


The campaign has delighted Republicans for culling a federal workforce they view as bloated, corrupt and insufficiently loyal to Trump, while also taking aim at government agencies that regulate big business -- including those that oversee Musk's companies SpaceX, Tesla and Neuralink.


The small unit within the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that regulates the kind of autonomous cars that Musk says are the future of Tesla is losing nearly half of its staff, the Post reported on Thursday.


Musk's Department of Government Efficiency team has also canceled contracts worth about $8.5 billion involving foreign aid, diversity training and other initiatives opposed by Trump. Both men have set a goal of cutting at least $1 trillion from the $6.7 trillion federal budget, though Trump has said he will not touch popular benefits programs that make up roughly one-third of that total.


Democratic critics have said Trump is exceeding his constitutional authority and hacking away at popular and critical government programs at the expense of legions of middle-class families.


Most Americans worry the cost-cutting could hurt government services, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released Thursday.


Some agencies have struggled to comply with the rapid-fire directives Trump has issued since taking office a month ago. Workers who oversee U.S. nuclear weapons were fired and then recalled, while medicines and food exports have been stranded in warehouses by Trump's freeze on foreign aid.

## Costa Rica and Honduras join Panama as stopovers for foreign deportees

date: 2025-02-21, from: VOA News USA

SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA — A group of families and children hailing from Uzbekistan, China, Afghanistan, Russia and more countries climbed down the stairs of an airplane in Costa Rica's capital Thursday, the first flight of deportees from other nations Costa Rica agreed to hold in detention facilities for the Trump administration while it organized the return back to their countries.


The flight of 135 deportees, half of them minors, added Costa Rica to a growing list of Latin American nations to serve as a stopover for migrants as U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration seeks to step up deportations.


While Costa Rica joins Panama in holding deportees from mostly Asian origin until their repatriation can be arranged or they can seek protection somewhere, Honduras on Thursday also facilitated a handoff of deportees between the U.S. and Venezuela from a flight coming from Guantanamo Bay.


The migrants arriving in Costa Rica will be bused to a rural holding facility near the Panama border, where they will be detained up to six weeks and be flown back to their countries of origin, said Omer Badilla, Costa Rica’s deputy minister of the interior and police.


The U.S. government will cover the costs.


The arrangement is part of a deal the Trump administration struck with Costa Rica during U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio's visit earlier this month. It comes as Trump has pressured countries across the region to help facilitate deportations at times under the threat of steep tariffs or sanctions.


Costa Rican President Rodrigo Chaves told reporters Wednesday that his country is helping its "economically powerful brother from the north."


Similar agreements have been reached with other Latin American nations, but the concept of using third countries as deportation layovers has drawn strong criticism from human rights advocates. Beyond the conditions of their detention in Costa Rica, concerns revolve around international protections for asylum seekers and whether these deportees will be appropriately screened before being returned to their countries or sent to yet another country.




Panama this week became the first such country to accept 299 deportees from other nations, with the government holding them in hotel rooms guarded by police. About one-third of those who refused to voluntarily return to their countries were sent to a remote camp in Darien province bordering Colombia on Wednesday. The rest were awaiting commercial flights back home.


"We’ve thrown out the possibility of a hotel, precisely to avoid a situation similar to that in Panama," Badilla, the Costa Rican official, told The Associated Press.


Honduras said Thursday it also acted as a brief stopover for a deportation flight of Venezuelans coming from Guantanamo Bay in what it described as a "humanitarian bridge" since there are no direct flights between the United States and Venezuela.


A U.S. flight carrying 170 Venezuelans landed Thursday in a joint U.S.-Honduran military base in central Honduras, and within hours were transferred to a Venezuelan aircraft. An official with Honduras’ foreign ministry said this was not a routine arrangement, but that the Central American nation remains open to facilitating more transfers between the two adversaries.


Badilla said that Thursday's deportation flight from San Diego is largely made up of families, including 65 children, two pregnant women and an elderly woman. He said Costa Rica was told by the Trump administration that most of the deportees have agreed to voluntarily return to their countries. If they refuse, Costa Rica is open to offering deportees refuge or will work with the U.N.'s International Organization for Migration, IOM, to facilitate travel to another third country.


"Costa Rica is a country that guarantees human rights," he said. "We are going to guarantee that they are returned to safe countries. We cannot leave that to chance because of an ethical and moral commitment of our country."


In the meantime, migrants will be detained in the border facility, where they will be accompanied by U.N. officials, the Red Cross and other aid-focused government entities to "guarantee their rights," Badilla said. The facility being used to hold migrants, a former factory, has faced criticisms for its conditions in the past. During a visit by the AP in October 2023, migrants were fenced off in cramped facilities and said they felt like "prisoners." Many slept in tents on the ground, where some said liquid from portable toilets leaked.


Badilla said that facilities have since been improved, but the government has denied journalists access to the building. The facility will also be processing a "reverse flow" of migrants from Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador that previously sought asylum in the U.S. and now want to return home.


Badilla said Costa Rica has seen between 50 and 75 migrants headed south entering the country a day. IOM said in a statement to the AP that "we do not have direct involvement in the detention or restriction of movement of individuals" and that it was providing humanitarian support and supporting voluntary returns to their countries and "identifying safe alternatives for others."

## South Korea requests exclusion from US plan to increase tariffs

date: 2025-02-21, from: VOA News USA

SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korean officials have asked the Trump administration to exclude their country from U.S. plans to impose aggressive tariffs on trade partners, emphasizing that Seoul is already applying low duties on American products under the free trade agreement between the two nations.


South Korea’s government on Friday said Deputy Trade Minister Park Jong-won made the request while traveling to Washington this week for meetings with unspecified officials from the White House, the Department of Commerce and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. The South Korean Trade Ministry didn’t say what Park heard from the Americans.


Park cited how South Korean companies were contributing to the U.S. economy through large-scale business investments and noted that the country was already imposing low duties on free trade partners such as the United States. He called for South Korea to be excluded from U.S. plans to establish reciprocal tariffs with trade partners and raise duties for imported steel and aluminum, the ministry said.


South Korea’s top economic think tank this month slashed its growth forecast for the country’s economy for the second time since November, expressing concern about the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump’s expanding tariffs and other measures aimed at resetting global trade.


The state-run Korea Development Institute projected the national economy to grow by 1.6% in 2025, which was 0.4 percentage points lower than its previous estimate. The group’s economists assessed that Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs won’t likely have a major impact on South Korea’s economy, as those products account for less than 1% of its exports to the U.S. However, they expressed concern that possible increases in U.S. duties for semiconductors and cars would hurt the country’s trade-dependent economy more.


South Korea’s acting president, Choi Sang-mok, on Friday called a meeting with trade and foreign policy officials to discuss the potential impact of Trump’s trade measures, including reciprocal tariffs and possible product-specific duties for semiconductors, cars and pharmaceuticals.


Choi, who is also South Korea’s finance minister, instructed officials to examine how other major economies, including the European Union, Japan and China, are responding to Trump’s trade policies, and try harder to effectively communicate South Korea’s position to U.S. officials.


South Korea’s trade surplus with the U.S. reached $55.7 billion in 2024. According to the South Korean trade ministry, the country’s tariff rates on U.S. manufacturing imports is around zero percent.

## US Senate Republicans push to pass border bill without Trump tax cuts

date: 2025-02-21, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate on Thursday began a debate on a Republican bill to advance President Donald Trump's priorities on immigration, energy and defense, even after he urged lawmakers to scrap the effort in favor of a House of Representatives bill that would also include trillions of dollars in tax cuts.


Trump this week came down firmly in favor of House Republicans' plan for a single sweeping bill. Backers of that plan fear that passing an immigration bill first could diminish their chances of extending $4.5 trillion in tax cuts in the House, where Republicans hold a narrow and fractious 218-215 majority.


Senate Republicans said they would nonetheless push ahead with their narrower plan and address tax cuts in a later bill. They are seeking to bypass Democratic opposition in that chamber and secure an early legislative win for Trump.


Democrats lack the votes to stop the bill but have vowed to fight it as long as possible, accusing Republicans of shortchanging American families to benefit the wealthy with tax breaks.


"We're going to be here all night," Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer proclaimed just before voting on amendments that began Thursday evening.


Schumer introduced the first amendment, which seeks to prohibit tax cuts for those earning more than $1 billion. Republicans blocked the amendment.


Democratic Senator Tim Kaine put the Senate on notice that he alone was seeking debate on about two dozen amendments ranging from middle-class tax cuts to measures protecting federal workers from termination and social safety net programs from cuts.


Republican Senate Budget Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham said earlier in the evening that there was an urgent need to beef up border security and the U.S. military. He argued that the higher spending ordered in the legislation would be "offset with $342 billion in cuts in other parts of the government."


In a rarely used Senate process known as a "vote-a-rama," amendments can be offered until both parties agree to stop. Normally, the two parties agree upon a narrow set of amendments for debate in the full Senate on legislation.


Republicans, who hold a 53-47 advantage over Democrats in the Senate, were expected to defeat scores of opposition amendments.


Both chambers of Congress need to pass the same budget resolution to unlock the parliamentary tool that would enable Republicans to enact Trump's legislative agenda in a way that circumvents Democratic opposition and the Senate filibuster.


Democrats made use of this maneuver in the first two years of Joe Biden's presidency, when they held majorities in both chambers of Congress.


The Senate's bill, which leaves the issue of Trump's desired extension of his 2017 tax cuts to a later date, could serve as a backup in case the House Republicans cannot agree on how to pay for the tax cuts in their bill without slashing funding for popular safety net programs like Medicaid and Social Security or potentially adding to the country's $36 trillion debt.


The Senate measure, a $340 billion fiscal 2025 budget resolution, would boost spending by $85 billion a year for four years to fund tighter border security, Trump's deportation of immigrants in the country illegally, energy deregulation, and an increase in military spending.


The House budget resolution includes those same priorities along with $4.5 trillion in tax cuts, while seeking to cover the cost through $2 trillion in spending cuts and accelerated economic growth based mainly on the tax and energy policy changes it would usher in.

## US flies Venezuelan migrants from Guantanamo to Honduras

date: 2025-02-21, from: VOA News USA

The U.S. government flew 177 Venezuelan migrants from Guantanamo Bay to Honduras on Thursday, from where they are set to be transferred on to Venezuela, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security said.


Earlier on Thursday, the Honduran government said about 170 Venezuelan migrants were set to arrive in the Central American nation from the United States, before being transported immediately back to Venezuela.


The transfer of the migrants would take place at Soto Cano, a joint U.S.-Honduras military air base, the Honduran government said.


Venezuela requested the repatriation of the citizens who it said were unjustly taken to Guantanamo naval base, Foreign Minister Yvan Gil said in a statement posted on Telegram, adding they would be flown from Honduras by Venezuelan airline Conviasa.


The arrival in Venezuela is expected Thursday evening local time.


Lawyers representing at least half a dozen of the deportees said they learned about the deportations on Thursday afternoon.


The deportations come after the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit last week seeking access to dozens of migrants flown to the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, saying they were being denied the right to an attorney.


The deportees included 126 people with criminal charges or convictions, 80 of whom were allegedly affiliated with Tren de Aragua, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said, adding that 51 had no criminal record.


There are no migrant detainees left at Guantanamo after Thursday’s deportations, the spokesperson said.


The U.S. has designated Tren de Aragua a global terrorist organization along with other organized crime groups, as President Donald Trump steps up immigration enforcement against alleged gang members in the United States.

## Trump order challenges independence of FCC, other agencies

date: 2025-02-21, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump this week signed an executive order intended to expand the White House’s authority over various independent regulatory agencies that Congress set up to be shielded from direct White House control, including the U.S. Federal Communications Commission.


The order, signed Tuesday, would require independent agencies to submit proposed regulations to the White House for review. The order also would require agencies to consult with the White House on their “policies and priorities” and “strategic plans.”


“These regulatory agencies currently exercise substantial executive authority without sufficient accountability to the President, and through him, to the American people,” the order said.


The executive order, titled “Ensuring Accountability for All Agencies,” is expected to face challenges in court, according to legal experts.


The move came as the president has worked to consolidate power within the executive branch, including by removing more than a dozen inspectors general who provided oversight at various government agencies.


In addition to the FCC, agencies that would be affected by the new order include the Federal Trade Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission.


The FCC does not directly regulate major news networks, but it does evaluate the actions of broadcasting stations around the U.S. that hold FCC licenses to use public airwaves.


Former FCC chairs told VOA that the move would be a significant change for the FCC.


“It makes an independent agency that was created to be independent like an agency in the executive branch,” said Tom Wheeler, who served as FCC chairman under former President Barack Obama.


Reed Hundt, who served as FCC chairman under former President Bill Clinton, agreed that the order would mark a departure from the agency’s nearly 100-year history.


“For 90 years, the governmental idea was that the president should not be regulating the media,” Hundt told VOA.


Harold Furchtgott-Roth, a Republican who served as an FCC commissioner under Clinton, told VOA that the order “would have a major effect on rulemaking” at the FCC. He added that other areas, like enforcement, might not be affected.


Democratic FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez told VOA that she was concerned by the order.


“Our informed decision-making is meant to be consistent with our technical expertise, not subject to political pressure,” Gomez told VOA in an emailed statement.


Gomez added that Congress already provides oversight over the FCC. “Efforts to expand executive influence on the FCC will only further diminish our standing as a stable, independent and expert-driven regulatory body,” said Gomez, who has served as a commissioner since 2023.


Trump-appointed FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, as well as Commissioners Geoffrey Starks and Nathan Simington, did not immediately reply to VOA’s emails requesting comment on the order. Carr and Simington are Republicans, Starks is a Democrat.




Kim Zarkin, a professor of communication at Westminster University in Utah who has researched the FCC for three decades, said she thought it was important for the FCC and other independent agencies to remain as nonpolitical as possible.


Even though commissioners at agencies such as the FCC are nominated by the president, “there was always this expectation that these were meant to be nonpolitical,” Zarkin told VOA. “They were meant to bring in expertise.”


Zarkin, who has written two books on the FCC, said time will tell whether the order has any material impact on how the FCC and other agencies operate.


Trump’s executive order comes amid concerns that the FCC is being weaponized to intimidate broadcasters through investigations, according to Democratic FCC commissioners and media law experts.


The FCC is currently investigating broadcasters, including NPR, PBS, CBS and NBC.


The FCC is investigating whether NPR and PBS member stations violated FCC rules on airing commercial ads. Both broadcasters deny wrongdoing.


The CBS inquiry pertains to whether the broadcaster doctored an October “60 Minutes” interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. That interview is also at the center of a $10 billion lawsuit from Trump.


CBS denied wrongdoing when Trump filed the lawsuit. Earlier this month, CBS published the interview’s unedited transcripts, which showed “60 Minutes” and “Face the Nation” used slightly different parts of the same answer from Harris, which is common journalistic practice.


The NBC investigation is into the company’s diversity, equity and inclusion practices.


Democratic FCC commissioners and media law experts have expressed concern about the investigations.

## US State Department tweaks online fact sheet on China

date: 2025-02-21, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — PRC is out. China is in.


That is among the significant modifications to the U.S. State Department’s online fact sheet on China, which drops the country’s official name, the People’s Republic of China (PRC), in favor of just China.


Former President Joe Biden’s administration routinely referenced the Beijing government with the PRC abbreviation. Since former President Richard Nixon began the process to normalize relations with Beijing — which would end recognition of the government in Taipei, officially known as the Republic of China, on Jan. 1, 1979 — the United States has maintained diplomatic ties with the communist-run government on the mainland, while reducing the relationship with Taiwan to unofficial but friendly. 


“Taipei should take solace in the fact that the change in the term [from PRC to China] does not represent a policy change in the United States. The fact of the matter is that the U.S. still has its ‘One China' policy, and under that policy, it maintains diplomatic relations with Beijing and robust unofficial relations with Taipei,” Russell Hsiao, Global Taiwan Institute executive director, told VOA.


“Since 1979, Washington has recognized the government in Beijing of the People’s Republic of China as the sole legal government of China, so the change in term is essentially a different way of presenting the same set of facts, all of which haven't changed,” Hsiao said.


China considers Taiwan a rogue province. Nationalist forces, backed by the United States and commanded by Chiang Kai-shek, fled the mainland for Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war to the communist forces led by Mao Zedong. Chiang became Taiwan’s relatively benign dictator until his death in 1975. Mao ruled over the mainland as a rigid authoritarian until his death a year after Chiang died.


Washington continues to provide Taipei with weapons and has left the question ambiguous as to whether the United States would use its military to defend the island if Taiwan were to be attacked. The Taiwan Relations Act commits the United States to help Taiwan defend itself, but the final decision on military intervention would rest with the president and Congress.


Language changes last week by the State Department eliminated a reference to Washington not supporting Taiwan independence, but left intact was content noting that the United States opposes “unilateral changes to the status quo” by either side of the Taiwan Strait.


A significant change to the State Department’s web page on China, however, is the deletion of content on cooperating with allies on China-related issues and on helping Beijing with cultural matters and environmental protections. Instead, there is new language focusing on the U.S.-China trade relationship, noting the difficulty for American businesses to operate in China and that the Chinese economy is “one of the most restrictive investment climates in the world.”


Yet another shift in tone, in line with rhetoric used by President Donald Trump’s administration, is reflected by frequent references to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The party is directly accused of trying to “manipulate and subvert” United Nations organizations and other international bodies and seeking to “groom and install CCP members in leadership and other positions” in such groups.


In the newly edited fact sheet, the CCP is also blamed for “malicious cyber activity against U.S. government, private sector and critical infrastructure networks.” The document now notes the United States is dedicated to countering these activities “to help protect American citizens, businesses and industries.”


“These moves reflect an overall sense in Washington and within the Trump administration that engagement with China has failed and a tougher approach is warranted,” Rorry Daniels, managing director of the Asia Society Policy Institute, told VOA.


“This mood has been building — particularly in Congress — for years, and a change of emphasis is no surprise. However, swapping out PRC for China reflects a deeper and more dangerous narrative that attacks the CCP’s legitimacy as the governing authority of China. I expect this will be viewed with grave concern by Beijing and raised at the highest levels in the coming days and weeks,” added Daniels.


Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun, responding during Thursday’s regular press briefing, expressed strong dissatisfaction with the website changes.


The State Department’s actions “misrepresent the facts, attack China’s foreign policy and peddle the so-called China-U.S. strategic competition. We strongly deplore and firmly oppose it,” Guo said.


The changes come after Trump imposed an additional 10% tariff on all imports from China. The president said he was taking the action because Beijing’s government has failed to stop the flow into the United States of the illicit opioid fentanyl.


Trump has also announced he intends to put in place further retaliatory tariffs on all trading partners that limit access for U.S. goods into their markets.

## Trump administration reduces deportation protections for 521,000 Haitians

date: 2025-02-20, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Thursday cut the duration of deportation protections and work permits for 521,000 Haitians covered by the Temporary Protected Status program so that they will expire in August, a Homeland Security Department spokesperson said.


The decision reverses a Biden administration move last year to extend the protections through February 2026, the spokesperson said, saying the extension was unjustified.


President Donald Trump, a Republican, tried to end most enrollment in the TPS program during his 2017-2021 presidency but was blocked by federal courts. Noem earlier this month revoked a Biden-era TPS extension for some 600,000 Venezuelans and terminated the status for half of them, whose protections and access to work permits expire in April.


Trump falsely said during a September 2024 debate with Democrat Kamala Harris that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were eating pets, sparking fear of retaliation among Haitians in the city. Trump said a month later that if elected he would revoke TPS for Haitians and deport them.


Noem will now need to decide whether to terminate the status for Haitians.


"President Trump and I are returning TPS to its original status: temporary," she said in a statement.


More than 1 million people, more than half of them children, are now displaced within Haiti where gang violence continues unabated despite the start of a United Nations-backed security mission last year, U.N. data published in January showed.




Haiti has lacked elected representatives since 2023 and has not held elections since 2016. The country's capital is almost entirely controlled by armed gangs, and leaders have said security must first be established to hold a free and fair vote.

## EU official meets with Trump counterparts to resolve tariff threats

date: 2025-02-20, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Hoping to head off a potential trade conflict, a top European Union official stressed the importance of active engagement and fairness in trade during a four-hour meeting with Trump administration officials.


“The top objective as it was presented to us yesterday by our American partners is reciprocity,” Maros Sefcovic, the European commissioner for trade and economic security, told reporters at a Thursday briefing.


Sefcovic met on Wednesday with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett and Jamieson Greer, President Donald Trump's nominee to be the U.S. trade representative.


Trump has thrown the decades long partnership between the U.S. and Europe into turmoil by pledging to charge higher taxes on imports from Europe that he says would match the tariffs faced by American products.


But Trump's plan for fair tariffs would also include the value added tax — which is akin to a sales tax — charged in Europe that could drastically push up import taxes and potentially trigger a broader trade conflict if the EU imposed retaliatory measures. A broader trade war risks both an economic slowdown and higher inflation that could create financial challenges for millions of families and potentially hurt political support for Trump, as voters in 2024's election specifically wanted him to lower price pressures.


Trump also has proposed separate sectoral tariffs on autos, pharmaceutical drugs and computer chips, in addition to having already imposed 25% steel and aluminum tariffs with no avenues to provide exceptions or exemptions.


Additionally, the U.S. president also has tariffs ready on Mexico and Canada over his claims that more should be done on illegal immigration and drug smuggling, though he suspended those tariffs for 30 days for ongoing talks. The import taxes that could potentially harm the U.S. auto sector and other industries could potentially begin in March.


At Thursday's White House news briefing, Hassett said that he and Lutnick had talks with a Mexican delegation about resolving the issues.


“We want trade to be fair,” Hassett said.


The EU official tried in his conversation with White House officials to equate the value added tax as similar to a sales tax as its paid by the final consumer, but he said that the issue had not been resolved.


Sefcovic also said they discussed the industrial overcapacity of China, particularly in steel, and that the U.S. and EU should work together to tackle that problem, instead of targeting each other.


He stressed that the meeting ended with a focus on looking for ways to “generate positive momentum,” adding that the EU would like to “see where we can, like, move first and fast, because I really would like to avoid the pain of measures and countermeasures.”


The EU official said it was critical to establish a personal relationship with his U.S. counterparts.


“I’m glad that it happened and that we could have such an intense meeting,” he said. “Now, I think we will both be thinking how to keep the momentum going on and how to hopefully avoid I would say, the pain.”

## Trump loyalist Kash Patel takes helm of FBI

date: 2025-02-20, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The Trump administration's makeover of the United States' national security and law enforcement agencies took a major step forward Thursday, with Senate lawmakers voting 51-49 to confirm Kash Patel as the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).


The vote puts Patel at the helm of the country's premier law enforcement agency, where he has promised to lead an overhaul of the bureau at a time when critics of President Donald Trump have accused the administration of leading a purge to end the bureau's tradition of independence and align the bureau with Trump's priorities.


Two Republicans — Senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski — voted with Democrats against Patel's confirmation. But support from the rest of the Senate Republican delegation gave Patel a slim victory, with many hailing the new FBI director as an agent of change.


"The FBI has lost trust among the American people in recent years. Much of that stems from a perception that politics has infected the FBI's important work," said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, ahead of Thursday's vote.


"We need all law enforcement working together and focused on the real threats facing our country," Thune said. "I look forward to working with Mr. Patel to restore the integrity of the FBI and get it focused on its critical mission."


Other Republicans have echoed similar sentiments.


"The FBI has been infected by political bias and weaponized against the American people," said Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley before advancing Patel's nomination to the full Senate earlier this month, noting "Mr. Patel knows it, Mr. Patel exposed it, and Mr. Patel was targeted."


"The American people are sick and tired of two tiers of access, two tiers of treatment, and two tiers of justice," said Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn, also speaking earlier this month on the need for Patel to head the FBI.




Patel is a former public defender and federal prosecutor who previously served as a Trump national security adviser and at the Pentagon.


In a statement announcing Patel's nomination in November, Trump praised him as having "played a pivotal role in uncovering the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax, standing as an advocate for truth, accountability and the Constitution."




Democrats, however, have repeatedly questioned Patel's qualifications and integrity, accusing him of describing some of the prosecuted, Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol rioters as "political prisoners," and of calling for the prosecution of Trump opponents.


And citing whistleblowers, they have accused Patel of lying to lawmakers about knowledge of efforts at the FBI to force out officials and agents who were assigned to investigate the Capitol Hill riot.




"He is unprepared and unqualified. He has an enemies list. He has these foreign entanglements," said Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal, rallying against Patel's confirmation in front of FBI headquarters in Washington before Thursday's vote.


"To Republicans who may vote for Kash Patel, this vote will haunt you," he said. "You will rue the day of this vote."


Democrat Peter Welch, also speaking in front of FBI headquarters, called Patel "a crown jewel" in what he described as a "lawless rampage" by Trump.


"He's an instrument of Donald Trump's effort to destroy the Justice Department and the FBI so that he is absolutely and completely not only above the law, but beyond the law," Welch said.




Patel, during his confirmation hearing last month, rejected accusations he has an enemies list or that he will seek retribution against Trump's opponents or enemies.


"I have no interest nor desire and will not, if confirmed, go backwards," Patel told lawmakers. "There will be no politicization at the FBI. There will be no retributive actions taken by the FBI."


"The only thing that will matter if I'm confirmed as a director of the FBI is a de-weaponized, de-politicized system of law enforcement completely devoted to rigorous obedience to the Constitution and a singular standard of justice," he said.


The FBI director is appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate for a term not to exceed 10 years.

## McConnell, longest-serving US Senate leader, to retire in early 2027

date: 2025-02-20, from: VOA News USA

U.S. Senator Mitch McConnell announced on Thursday, his 83rd birthday, that he will not seek reelection when his current term ends next year.


First elected in 1984, McConnell made the announcement from the Senate floor.


“Seven times, my fellow Kentuckians have sent me to the Senate. Every day in between, I’ve been humbled by the trust they’ve placed in me to do their business here,” he said. “Representing our commonwealth has been the honor of a lifetime. I will not seek this honor an eighth time. My current term in the Senate will be my last.”


McConnell, a former Republican Majority Leader, will retire as the longest-serving Senate leader from any party. He has led the Republicans since 2007 both as majority and minority leader before giving up the position to Senator John Thune last year.


McConnell’s storied political career saw him guide the Senate chamber through a $1.5 trillion tax overhaul, presidential impeachment trials and fierce political fights.


In what may be a lasting feature of his legacy, McConnell aggressively sought to outfit federal courts with more conservative justices. His final years as head of the Senate Republicans saw repeated political clashes with an increasingly populist party under the leadership of President Donald Trump.


In recent years, McConnell had a series of health scares, including two separate incidents in which he froze while talking to reporters. He blamed those incidents on a previous concussion.


In his comments Thursday, McConnell said he decided last year that he would not run for reelection.


Some information for this report came from The Associated Press and Reuters.

## Zelenskyy: Strong Ukraine relations with US 'benefit entire world'

date: 2025-02-20, from: VOA News USA

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Thursday that "strong Ukraine-U.S. relations benefit the entire world," an apparent attempt to calm tensions with Washington after he and U.S. President Donald Trump traded barbs this week over efforts to end Russia's three-year war on Ukraine.


Zelenskyy said in Kyiv he had a "productive meeting" with Trump envoy Keith Kellogg on the "battlefield situation, how to return our prisoners of war and effective security guarantees" for Ukraine if the war is ended.


Earlier in the week, Zelenskyy had complained that Ukraine was excluded from high-level talks in Saudi Arabia between the top U.S. and Russian diplomats as they discussed setting up negotiations about how to end the war and contended that Trump was living in a Russian-influenced "disinformation space."


Meanwhile, Trump called Zelenskyy a "dictator without elections" and claimed falsely that Ukraine started the war three years ago next week, even though Russian President Vladimir Putin initiated it.


Kellogg said he went to Kyiv to listen to Zelenskyy's views and would report back to Trump.


The Trump administration has proposed that part of the settlement of war would involve the U.S. investing in Ukrainian mining operations. The U.S. would gain access to rare earth minerals it needs for the manufacture of American technology products and recoup some of the money for the tens of billions of dollars' worth of munitions it has sent to Ukraine to fight Russian forces while also boosting the war-ravaged Ukrainian economy.


Zelenskyy so far has balked at the proposition for what he sees as lack of adequate security for Ukraine if the war is ended.




In Washington, Mike Waltz, Trump's national security adviser, told reporters, "We're going to continue to have discussions about where that deal is going again. We have an obligation to the taxpayer. I think this is an opportunity. The president thinks this is an opportunity for Ukraine.


"Going forward, there can be, in my view, nothing better for Ukraine's future and for their security than to have the United States invested in their prosperity long term," Waltz said. "And then a key piece of this has also been security guarantees. Look, the reality that we're talking about here is, is it in Ukraine's interest? Is it in Europe's interest? It certainly isn't in Russia's interest or in the American people's interest, for this war to grind on forever and ever and ever.


"Understand, this war needs to come to an end, this kind of open-ended mantra [supporting Ukraine military operations] that we had under [President Joe Biden's] administration, that's over, and I think a lot of people are having a hard time accepting that," he said.


Ukraine fears that Trump is moving to settle the war on terms more favorable to Moscow. Russia currently controls about a fifth of Ukraine's internationally recognized territory.


U.S. Vice President JD Vance told a gathering of conservative activists outside Washington on Thursday that Trump "wants the killing to stop" in Ukraine and that "peace is in the interest of the American people."


After the U.S.-Russian talks in Riyadh, "we're on the cusp of peace," he said, not mentioning Ukraine's role in settling the conflict. U.S. officials have said Kyiv and Moscow will both be involved in the settlement and will have to make concessions to achieve peace.


European leaders have responded to Trump's recent remarks about Ukraine by pledging to step up spending on defense, and some are considering a U.S.-backed European peacekeeping force for the country if the fighting ends. The Kremlin says the plan is a major cause for concern, but Zelenskyy and NATO have welcomed it.


Watch related video by Katherine Gypson:




"It is vital that ... Russia will never again try to take one more square kilometer of Ukrainian land," NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said, adding that a peace pact would have to entail robust security guarantees for Ukraine.


"While there is much that still needs to be decided, there is no question that Europe has a vital role to play in securing peace in Ukraine," he told reporters in Bratislava, Slovakia.


In a string of comments on his Truth Social platform this week, Trump accused Zelenskyy of refusing to hold elections in Ukraine, which had been scheduled for April 2024 but were delayed after Russia invaded in 2022.


Trump disparaged Zelenskyy as "a modestly successful comedian" and said, "The only thing he was good at was playing Biden 'like a fiddle'" for more U.S. military assistance.


"I love Ukraine," Trump said, "but Zelenskyy has done a terrible job, his Country is shattered, and MILLIONS have unnecessarily died — And so it continues."


Earlier, Trump had scoffed at Zelenskyy's complaint about not being invited to the Tuesday talks in Riyadh, which were headed by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.


"Today I heard, 'Well, we weren't invited.' Well, you've been there for three years," Trump said of Ukraine's leaders.

## North Korea criticizes US over AUKUS nuclear submarine deal

date: 2025-02-20, from: VOA News USA

SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — North Korean state media on Thursday criticized the United States for a nuclear submarine deal with Australia under the AUKUS partnership signed in 2021, calling it a "threat to regional peace."


A commentary carried by KCNA said Washington should be wary of consequences for what it said were nuclear alliances, naming AUKUS and the trilateral cooperation with South Korea and Japan.


Australia just made its first $500 million payment to the U.S. under the AUKUS nuclear submarine deal.


Under AUKUS, Australia will pay the United States $3 billion to boost the capacity of the U.S. submarine industry, and Washington will sell several Virginia-class nuclear-powered submarines to Australia in the early 2030s.


The KCNA commentary also argued the U.S. sees North Korea as an obstacle to its establishment of hegemony in the region and said nuclear states will not sit idly by, referring to itself.


North Korea has been criticizing the trilateral military cooperation between South Korea, Japan and the U.S. and has called the relationship "the Asian version of NATO."


South Korea's defense ministry on Thursday said that a joint air drill was held with the U.S. with at least one B-1B strategic bomber taking part.


The drill was to show extended deterrent capabilities by the United States in response to threats from North Korea's nuclear and missile program, the ministry said in a statement.

## Trump expects visit from Chinese President Xi without giving timeline

date: 2025-02-20, from: VOA News USA

ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE/ WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he expected Chinese President Xi Jinping to visit the United States, without giving a timeline for his trip.


Trump made the remarks to reporters on Air Force One and said "it's possible" for the U.S. and China to have a new trade deal. A conversation or interaction between Xi and Trump is seen as crucial to a potential easing or delay of trade tariffs.


"We'll have, ultimately, President Xi, we will have everybody coming (to the U.S.)," Trump said, while also speaking about other leaders potentially visiting the United States.


Xi last travelled to the U.S. in November 2023, in his fifth visit to the country as Chinese president, for a summit with then U.S. President Joe Biden, resulting in agreements to resume military-to-military communications and curb fentanyl production.


Trump and Xi had spoken just before Trump took office on January 20 and discussed issues including TikTok, trade and Taiwan.


Trump told reporters on Wednesday that he was talking to China about TikTok as the United States seeks to broker a sale of the popular app owned by Chinese parent firm ByteDance.


Trump said last week he had spoken to Xi since taking office as well, but did not offer details on the topics of that conversation. China's foreign ministry did not directly comment on Trump's remarks that day and instead referred reporters to their "scheduled" call before Trump took office.


Washington and Beijing have had tense relations for years over differences ranging from trade and tariffs and cybersecurity, and TikTok, Taiwan, Hong Kong, human rights and the origins of COVID-19.


Trump also again told reporters he could make a deal with Russia over the war in Ukraine.


"We can make a deal with Russia to stop the killing," Trump said, adding he thought the Russians wanted to see the war end.


"I think they have the cards a little bit because they've taken a lot of territory, so they have the cards," Trump said.

## Native American activist Leonard Peltier, freed from prison, welcomed on reservation

date: 2025-02-20, from: VOA News USA

BELCOURT, NORTH DAKOTA — Native American activist Leonard Peltier was defiant toward the government but grateful for his supporters as they welcomed him home to North Dakota on Wednesday, a day after his release from a Florida prison where he had been serving a life sentence in the 1975 killings of two FBI agents. 


Peltier, 80, grew emotional as he addressed about 500 people who gathered at the festive event that included food, a drum circle and dancers at a center in Belcourt. The small town is just south of the Canadian border on the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians' reservation. 


"I'm so proud of the showing and support you've given me," Peltier said. "I've got a hard time keeping myself from crying. A strong warrior can't be up crying in front of his people." 




Before leaving office, former President Joe Biden commuted Peltier's life sentence to home confinement, leading to his release Tuesday from the Coleman penitentiary. Peltier was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder and given two consecutive life sentences stemming from a 1975 confrontation on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota. 


FBI agents Jack Coler and Ronald Williams were killed, and while Peltier acknowledged firing shots during the confrontation, he denied being the person whose shots killed the men. Native Americans widely believe he was a political prisoner who was wrongly convicted because he fought for Indigenous rights as a member of the American Indian Movement. 


For years, many in law enforcement argued against freeing Peltier. Current and former FBI agents disputed his claims of innocence. As Biden considered his options as his term ended, former FBI Director Christopher Wray sent the president a letter in which he called Peltier "a remorseless killer" who should remain in prison. 


In a statement about the commutation, Biden said numerous individuals and groups supported releasing Peltier due to the time he spent in prison, his age and his leadership role among Native Americans. 


For decades, Peltier has maintained he was innocent of the murder charges, and he said Wednesday: "I spent 49 years straight in prison for something I didn't do." 


Peltier said he went into prison a young man and emerged far older at age 80. During all that time, Peltier said he tried to keep Native American issues in the forefront of his activism, and he thanked tribes across the nation for their decades of support. 


"From day one, from the first hour I was arrested, Indian people came to my rescue, from all over the country," Peltier said. 




Tribal leaders presented Peltier with an eagle feather staff that supporters had carried to Washington and other places as they campaigned for his release, and a traditional star quilt that Peltier draped over his shoulder. 


Nick Tilsen, an Oglala Lakota and founder of the NDN Collective, an Indigenous-led advocacy group, paid tribute to Peltier and his generation of American Indian Movement leaders for standing up "against the most powerful government in the world. And they instilled that pride back into our people. They instilled that fight back into our people." 


"All around the world, Leonard Peltier's name will be remembered as a warrior, as a warrior who outlasted one of the strongest governments in the world, and came out victorious." 


Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Tribal Chair Jamie Azure said the welcome shown by hundreds of people at the event was a testament to what he means to the tribe and other Native Americans. 


"What I think you can see from the turnout here today, it means a lot to a lot of people on a lot of different levels to see Mr. Peltier come back to his homeland, to just be home," Azure said. 


As tribal member Denise Lajimodiere said, "It's a big day. A day of celebration."

## Stax Music Academy's teen students mark 25th anniversary, Black History Month with concert

date: 2025-02-20, from: VOA News USA

MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE — The Memphis music studio where some of America’s most recognizable songs were recorded decades ago is now a museum. But next door, trumpets blare, drums boom, and singers craft the soulful sounds of Stax Records’ biggest hits.


At Stax Music Academy, young musicians rehearse the unmistakable intro to “Theme from Shaft,” the Isaac Hayes tour de force that won an Oscar in 1972 and tantalizes listeners with its pulsating bass line, crisp hi-hat and funky guitar. There's an air of professionalism among the students as their teacher hands out sheets of music and words of wisdom.


“Here we go. Read the ink that’s on the paper. From the top, one, two, ready and …,” says Sam Franklin IV, the academy's music director. When they finish, Franklin says, “Hey y’all, that was good.”


Under the guidance of Franklin and other instructors, the students are practicing for three concerts in Memphis, Tennessee, on Friday to celebrate Black History Month and the academy's 25th anniversary. Created in 2000, the academy is an after-school program for teens that teaches them to sing, dance and play instruments. Some pay nothing to attend.


The academy has graduated more than 4,000 students since it started in the working-class neighborhood of Soulsville, where Stax Records produced soul and R&B classics in the 1960s and 1970s. Since 2008, every high school senior has been accepted to a college or university, many on full scholarships. The academy has performed at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, the Kennedy Center in Washington, and in Europe and Australia.


Students take pride and joy in continuing the legacy of the influential record company, where Otis Redding cut “(Sittin’ On) the Dock of the Bay,” Sam and Dave worked on “Soul Man,” and The Staple Singers made “Respect Yourself.” Other mainstays of the Stax catalog include Booker T. and the MGs, Rufus and Carla Thomas, Wilson Pickett and Johnnie Taylor.


Before it went bankrupt in 1975, Stax Records helped develop the raw, emotional Memphis Sound, driven by tight horn and rhythm sections, and strong-voiced singers. Some Stax songs were energetic and raucous, others smooth and sexy. Stax Records no longer churns out chart-topping music, although it still has a program for songwriters. The building has been converted into the Stax Museum of American Soul Music.


The Stax Music Academy group practicing on a rainy January evening includes both Black and white players. Before the work begins, some students joke around and dance in the hallway outside the rehearsal room, which boasts a high ceiling and a whiteboard with musical notes written on it. In a separate room, vocalists clap for each other as they take turns singing for their instructors.


“It’s so fun," said Tatiyana Clark, a 17-year-old singer who joined the academy in 2023. "I’ve been in places where we would have the same interest in music, but nothing is like the connection that I have here. Honestly, it’s a different level of friendship, when you have the exact same feelings towards music, the same experiences — almost.”


Stax began online Black History Month presentations in 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Previous programs have included specific themes, with this year's being the U.S. labor movement and how it involved and affected Black people, including work training, entrepreneurship and unionization. But this year's show is a series of in-person concerts at a downtown Memphis venue where attendees will hear Sam and Dave's “Hold On, I'm Comin'”, Arthur Conley's “Sweet Soul Music,” and “Cause I Love You,” by the father and daughter duet of Rufus and Carla Thomas.


A companion study guide includes lessons and activities highlighting key figures and events that shaped labor policies and standards.


“It’s all about the message for me,” said Johnathan Cole, an 18-year-old singer and songwriter. “It feels good because with the world going crazy right now, everybody just needs a little bit of love, happiness and music. That’s what Stax Music Academy has always been about: love, music, creativity."


When the labor and civil rights movements were striving for racial equality and social justice, Booker T. and the MGs churned out “Green Onions” and other toe-tapping instrumental songs, with Black men at organ and drums — Booker T. Jones and Al Jackson Jr. — and white players on lead and bass guitar — Steve Cropper and Donald “Duck” Dunn.


“I would describe Stax as ‘change,'" said Johnathan McKinnie, a 16-year-old piano and organ player. "It drastically changed how music was formed … It was definitely an advocate for civil rights.”


In the vocalists' rehearsal room, the group is perfecting Eddie Floyd's song about luck and love, “Knock on Wood."


"It’s like thunder, and lightning, the way you love me is frightening … better knock, knock, knock on wood,” three vocalists sing in harmony.


“Breathe. You’re not breathing,'” one instructor tells a student, who smiles and nods.


The exchange exemplifies the spirit of cooperation and dedication that permeates the academy. Pasley Thompson, a 17-year-old singer and songwriter, calls the academy "an escape from the every day.”


“Being able to be in a space with people that get you on a creative level, and on a personal level, because we’re around each other all the time, it’s a really great feeling to have,” she said.

## Trump, Vance among speakers at gathering of conservatives

date: 2025-02-20, from: VOA News USA

Conservative leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump and politicians from Argentina, Britain, Poland and Italy, are among those set to address a three-day meeting of conservatives outside of Washington beginning Thursday.


U.S. Vice President JD Vance leads off the Conservative Political Action Conference, with other sessions Thursday set to include discussions of cryptocurrency and Middle East peace, and a panel featuring relatives of hostages being held in Gaza.


The CPAC conference helped Trump emerge as a figure in conservative politics and one which he addressed every year during his prior term in office.


He used an address last year at the conference to pledge that a victory in the November presidential election would bring "judgment day" for "the liars and cheaters and fraudsters and censors and imposters who have commandeered our government."


In addition to U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, Thursday’s agenda also includes remarks from former British Prime Minister Liz Truss and Balazs Orban, the political director for Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.


Santiago Abascal, head of the far-right Spanish political party Vox is set to address the event Thursday, as is British lawmaker Nigel Farage and former Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.


Later conference speakers include Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico, Argentina’s President Javier Milei and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.

## Trump says he has not seen Egyptian counter to his plan for Gaza

date: 2025-02-20, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump said Wednesday evening he has not seen the proposal being discussed by Arab leaders as an alternative to his plan to take over Gaza once the war between Hamas and Israel ends.


“I haven’t seen it,” Trump said in response to a reporter’s question on Air Force One. “Once I see it, I’ll let you know,” he added.


Trump said early this month he wants to forcibly relocate almost 2 million Palestinians from Gaza into neighboring Jordan and Egypt. He said the United States will “own” the territory and turn it into the “Riviera of the Middle East,” which prompted rejection by Arab countries.


It’s unclear whether Trump is serious or merely threatening to extract concessions from Arab states. During a meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh this week, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggested that it could be the latter, urging regional leaders to make a counteroffer.


The Saudi crown prince will host leaders of Egypt, Jordan, and other Gulf Cooperation Council states of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates Friday in Riyadh to discuss options, including an Egyptian plan to raise up to $20 billion over three years from Arab and Gulf states for Gaza’s reconstruction. Under this plan, Gazans would not be forced out and the strip would be governed by Palestinians.


Saudi connection


Trump spoke en route to Washington after delivering remarks at a conference in Miami, hosted by the Future Investment Initiative Institute, the nonprofit arm of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund – the kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund led by the crown prince.


His speech marked the first time a U.S. president addressed the annual gathering of global financiers and tech executives. It is a testament to how the Saudi crown prince, known by his initials MBS, has leveraged his connection to Trump, Laura Blumenfeld, senior fellow at the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies, said.


The prince established close ties during Trump’s first term and continued business ties with the Trump organization while the president was out of office, including investing $2 billion to a firm belonging to Trump’s son-in-law and former aide, Jared Kushner.


“Trump believes in the Golden Rule, but not the Golden Rule from Sunday school,” Blumenfeld told VOA. “It's if you're rich, you're right.”


As Riyadh leads the charge to unify Arab nations to support postwar Gaza, there may be signs that Trump is softening his demand. In his wide-ranging remarks that lasted over an hour, Trump did not mention Gaza beyond repeating what he said was his role on the ceasefire signed January 19, during the last day then-President Joe Biden was in office.


“We've secured a ceasefire in Gaza, and we're bringing in the hostages, and we're bringing them home to their families,” Trump said, adding that some of the hostages “are in pretty bad shape.”


He lauded Yasir Al-Rumayyan, governor of the Saudi wealth fund, and Saudi Finance Minister Mohammed bin Abdullah al-Jadaan. The White House did not immediately respond to VOA’s query on whether Trump met with any of the Saudi delegation during the event.


During his Wednesday remarks Trump thanked the Saudi crown prince for hosting talks between U.S. and Russian officials Tuesday to find a way to end the war in Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European allies have decried the meeting as an effort to sideline Kyiv.


Egyptian proposal on Gaza


Egypt's state-run Al-Ahram newspaper said under the proposal, “secure areas” equipped with mobile houses and shelters will be established as living areas in Gaza while Egyptian and international construction firms rebuild the devastated infrastructure.


The proposal also calls for forming a national Palestinian committee of technocrats and community leaders unaffiliated with Hamas to govern postwar Gaza.


It is unclear whether the plan has the support of the Palestinian Authority, the internationally recognized body that currently rules parts of the West Bank and administered Gaza until it lost the 2006 election to Hamas.


“What is needed now is a political solution to Gaza to make that reconstruction both physically possible and long term sustainable,” said Tariq Kenney-Shawa, U.S. Policy Fellow at the Palestinian Policy Network Al-Shabaka.


The goal is that “we don't return to a situation where Gaza remains under occupation,” he told VOA.


On Monday Hamas indicated a willingness to cede any postwar governance role.


“It is not necessary for Hamas to be part of the political and administrative arrangements in the next phase for Gaza, especially if it serves the interests of our people,” Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qasim told Al Arabiya TV.


Hamas made the conciliatory statement as negotiations toward phase two of the ceasefire is set to begin in days, after weeks of delay. However, it fulfils only part of Israel’s and the United States’ key demand – the elimination of governance and military role for Hamas in postwar Gaza.


So far Hamas has not shown it would disarm. Meanwhile Israel has not defined what it considers an acceptable alternative governing entity to Hamas and has rejected any involvement of the Palestinian Authority.


The Egyptian proposal also does not solve a longstanding issue between the warring parties. Israeli leaders oppose any postwar plans that would pave the way to a two-state solution, while a sovereign Palestine remains a key requirement for Palestinians and Arab countries.


Expedited hostage release


A top Hamas official announced earlier this week that the group will return the remains of four deceased Israeli hostages and free six living ones in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, including 47 senior Hamas members. Israel will also allow mobile homes and construction equipment into Gaza.


The six living hostages are the last set to be freed under phase one of the ceasefire that called for the gradual release of 33 hostages, eight of whom are believed to be dead. Hamas took about 250 hostages and killed about 1,200 people in the October 2023 attack on Israel.


Analysts said the expedited exchange of hostages and prisoners could mean that both parties are anxious to secure what they can now, due to concerns the truce will collapse before phase one expires next week.


“What we're looking at now is possibly – possibly a swifter resolution to phase two,” said Mirette Mabrouk, senior fellow at the Middle East Institute.


“But if that happens, then that sort of signals near the end of the conflict,” she told VOA. “And that's something that [Israeli] Prime Minister Netanyahu has said he's not going to want without Hamas being disarmed.”


Hamas is believed to be holding about 70 more captives, half of them living. It insists it will only release them in exchange for a permanent end to fighting and a full Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza.


Israel's counteroffensive to the Hamas attack has displaced more than 2 million Palestinians and killed more than 48,200, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. The Israeli military says the death toll includes 17,000 militants.

## Migrants in Panama deported from US moved to Darien jungle region

date: 2025-02-20, from: VOA News USA

PANAMA CITY — A group of migrants deported from the U.S. to Panama last week were moved on Tuesday night from a hotel in the capital to the Darien jungle region in the south of the country, a lawyer representing a migrant family told Reuters on Wednesday.


Susana Sabalza, a Panamanian migration lawyer, said the family she represents was transferred to Meteti, a town in the Darien, along with other deported migrants.


La Estrella de Panama, a local daily, reported on Wednesday that 170 of the 299 migrants who had been in the hotel were moved to the Darien.


Panama's government did not respond to a request for comment.


The 299 migrants have been staying at a hotel in Panama City under the protection of local authorities and with the financial support of the United States through the U.N.-related International Organization for Migration and the U.N. refugee agency, according to the Panamanian government.


The migrants include people from Afghanistan, China, India, Iran, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Turkey, Uzbekistan and Vietnam, according to Panama's president, Jose Raul Mulino, who has agreed with the U.S. to receive non-Panamanian deportees.


The deportation of non-Panamanian migrants to Panama is part of the Trump administration's attempt to ramp up deportations of migrants living in the U.S. illegally.


One of the challenges to Trump's plan is that some migrants come from countries that refuse to accept U.S. deportation flights, due to strained diplomatic relations or other reasons. The arrangement with Panama allows the U.S. to deport these nationalities and makes it Panama's responsibility to organize their onward repatriation.


The process has been criticized by human rights groups that worry migrants could be mistreated and also fear for their safety if they are ultimately returned to violent or war-torn countries of origin, such as Afghanistan.


Sabalza said she had not been able to see her clients while they were held at the hotel in Panama City and said she is seeking permission to visit them at their new location. She declined to identify their nationality, but said they were a Muslim family who "could be decapitated" if they returned home.


Sabalza said the family would be requesting asylum in Panama or "any country that will receive them other than their own."


Mulino said previously the migrants would be moved to a shelter in the Darien region, which includes the dense and lawless jungle separating Central America from South America that has in recent years become a corridor for hundreds of thousands of migrants aiming to reach the United States.


Panama's security minister said on Tuesday that more than half of the migrants deported from the United States in recent days had accepted voluntary repatriations to their home countries.


On Wednesday morning the hotel in Panama City where the migrants had been held appeared quiet, according to a Reuters witness.


On Tuesday some migrants had been seen holding hands and looking out a window of the hotel to get the attention of reporters outside.


Migrants in the hotel were not allowed to leave, according to media reports.


On Wednesday, Panama's migration service said in a statement that a Chinese national, Zheng Lijuan, had escaped from the hotel. It asked that she return and accused unspecified people outside the hotel of aiding her escape.

## Senate Republicans to push ahead with border bill despite Trump opposition

date: 2025-02-20, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — U.S. Senate Republicans will push ahead on Thursday with a measure to kickstart President Donald Trump's agenda on immigration, energy and defense, Majority Leader John Thune said on Wednesday, after Trump called on them to drop the plan in favor of a sweeping resolution prepared by House Republicans.


Trump came down firmly in favor of the House of Representatives' plan for one sweeping bill that would also include trillions of dollars in tax cuts. House Republicans fear that the Senate's "skinny" plan could diminish their chances of extending Trump's tax cuts later in their own chamber, where the party holds a narrow and fractious 218-215 majority.


"We need both Chambers to pass the House Budget to 'kickstart' the Reconciliation process, and move all of our priorities to the concept of, 'ONE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL'," the president wrote on social media on Wednesday morning.


After a lunch meeting with Vice President JD Vance and his own Senate Republicans, Thune told reporters that he would still go ahead with the smaller bill.


"In the end, we'll be able to, whether it's one bill or two bills, to get all the things that the president's outlined -- his objectives -- across the finish line," said Thune, adding that he expected the Senate to vote on its own blueprint on Thursday.


Some Republicans said they were confused about the plan to proceed after Trump's message.


"It seems a little strange to me," Senator Josh Hawley said.


"If the president supports it and ... I have some assurance of that, I’ll support it," the Missouri Republican added. "But it just seems a little bizarre to me. I can't quite figure out what we're doing."


Meanwhile, Democrats promised a long, drawn-out fight.


"Senate Democrats will expose Republicans' reconciliation budget bill exactly for what it is: a sinister front for clearing the way to cut taxes for Donald Trump's billionaire buddies," Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said.


The Senate measure, a $340 billion fiscal 2025 budget resolution, would boost spending by $85 billion a year for four years to fund tighter border security, Trump's deportation of immigrants in the country illegally, energy deregulation and an increase in military spending. Republicans say the plan would offset the higher spending with funding cuts in other areas.


The House budget resolution includes those same priorities along with $4.5 trillion in tax cuts, while seeking to cover the cost through $2 trillion in spending cuts and accelerated economic growth based mainly on the tax and energy policy changes it would usher in.


'FULL agenda'


Both chambers of Congress need to pass the same budget resolution to unlock the parliamentary tool that would enable Republicans to enact Trump's legislative agenda in a way that circumvents Democratic opposition and the Senate filibuster.


Republican lawmakers in recent weeks have backed away from concerns that extending Trump's 2017 tax cuts could add to the nation's fast-growing $36 trillion in debt. The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated that Trump's full tax cut agenda could cost more than $5 trillion over the next decade.


House Republicans welcomed Trump's intervention as they try to forge unity for a floor vote on their own budget blueprint expected next week.


"@realDonaldTrump is right! House Republicans are working to deliver President Trump’s FULL agenda - not just a small part of it. Let’s get it done, @HouseGOP!" tweeted House Speaker Mike Johnson, Thune's Republican counterpart.


The difference between the House and Senate strategies comes down to Trump's proposed tax cuts.


House Republicans fear the two-step Senate approach could lead to a stalled standalone tax cut bill if lawmakers cannot agree on offsetting cuts in spending. Senate Republicans worry that the rush for all-encompassing legislation may not provide enough time to adequately handle the intricacies of the tax component.


Senate Republicans began moving forward with their own budget resolution last week in response to what they described as a plea for border and immigration funding from Trump "border czar" Tom Homan and White House budget director Russ Vought.

## Trump's comments on Ukraine draw mixed reaction from US lawmakers

date: 2025-02-20, from: VOA News USA

U.S. President Donald Trump's comments this week claiming Ukraine was responsible for starting the three-year conflict with Russia and calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy "a dictator without elections" drew criticism from congressional Democrats and pushback from some members of the Republican Party.


"Clearly, Vladimir Putin is responsible for this war," Republican Senator Thom Tillis told reporters. "His decision has resulted in the murder, rape, torture and kidnapping of untold numbers of Ukrainians. He owns responsibility for this war. I don't know how more plainly it can be stated."


Republican Senator John Kennedy told reporters he believes Russia started the war.


"I also believe, through bitter experience, that Vladimir Putin is a gangster. He's a gangster with a black heart," he added.


But Senate Majority Leader John Thune declined to criticize Trump when speaking to reporters Wednesday.


"The president speaks for himself," Thune said. "What I want to see is a peaceful result, a peaceful outcome. And I think right now, there's a negotiation going on, and let's see where that ultimately leads."


Republican Senator Josh Hawley said Trump has blamed Russia "as well, and threatened to sanction Russia if they didn't come to the negotiating table."


The conflict between Trump and Zelenskyy comes as U.S. envoy Keith Kellogg arrived in Kyiv on Wednesday to meet with Zelenskyy.


Ukraine was not included in peace talks that began this week in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, between the United States and Russia. Trump brushed off Ukraine's complaints at not being included in negotiations, saying Tuesday, "You never should have started it."


Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, claiming eastern parts of the country needed to be liberated. U.S. officials say nearly half a million Ukrainian civilians have died in the war and at least 124,000 Ukrainian soldiers.


After Trump's comment, seeming to blame the Ukrainian leader for starting the war, Zelenskyy responded on social media that Trump lives in a "disinformation space" influenced by Russia.


Trump responded to Zelenskyy on Truth Social on Wednesday: "Think of it, a modestly successful comedian, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, talked the United States of America into spending $350 Billion Dollars, to go into a War that couldn't be won, that never had to start, but a War that he, without the U.S. and 'TRUMP,' will never be able to settle. A Dictator without Elections, Zelenskyy better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left."


Hawley told reporters Wednesday that he supported Trump's calls for an election in Ukraine.


"The suspension of elections in Ukraine is a bad deal," Hawley said. "Zelenskyy should hold elections. He's the elected leader of the country. Our president is right — they haven't had elections in a long time, and they are basically under martial law. That's not good when you claim to be defending democracy. You need to practice it."


But Democrats said Trump's comments endanger America's standing on the global stage.


"This is outrageous. It's outrageous if not humorous that the president does these sorts of things, goes off on wild tangents and says things that are clearly false," Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin told reporters.


Democratic Senator Elissa Slotkin said Wednesday, "It is what we all feared, which is he understands incorrectly what's happening in the span of history and is blaming the head of a country that has been invaded by an autocratic regime; a democracy was invaded.


"And however you want to solve it, however you want to negotiate, is one thing," Slotkin said. "But he put down his cards."

## US figures do not support Trump claims on Ukraine spending

date: 2025-02-20, from: VOA News USA

President Donald Trump on Wednesday repeated a claim that the United States has spent $350 billion on Ukraine’s war — a figure that far eclipses the amount recorded by the Department of Defense and the interagency oversight group that tracks U.S. appropriations to Ukraine.


Since Russia’s illegal invasion in February 2022, the U.S. Congress has appropriated about $183 billion for Ukraine, according to the interagency oversight group that is charged with presenting reports to Congress.


Of that, the Pentagon confirmed to VOA that the U.S. has sent $65.9 billion in military aid to Ukraine, and an additional $3.9 billion that Congress has authorized in military aid to Kyiv remains unspent.


About $58 billion of the $183 billion in total aid for Ukraine was spent in the U.S., going directly toward boosting the U.S. defense industry, either by replacing old U.S. weapons given to Kyiv with new American-made weapons, by procuring new U.S.-made weapons for Kyiv or by making direct industrial investments.


VOA asked the White House to clarify Trump’s comments, specifically seeking any documentation for the mathematical discrepancy. The White House replied by referring VOA back to the president’s comments.


In a post Wednesday on his social media site Truth Social, Trump said, “Think of it, a modestly successful comedian, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, talked the United States of America into spending $350 Billion Dollars, to go into a War that couldn’t be won, that never had to start, but a War that he, without the U.S. and 'TRUMP,' will never be able to settle."


Zelenskyy on Wednesday told Ukrainian reporters the total cost of the war since February 2022 was about $320 billion.


"One hundred and twenty billion of that comes from us, the people of Ukraine, the taxpayers, and $200 billion from the United States and the European Union,” Zelensky said. “This is the cost of weapons. This is the weapons package — $320 billion."


Trump, who has mentioned the $350 billion figure several times, also said in his Wednesday social media post: “The United States has spent $200 Billion Dollars more than Europe, and Europe’s money is guaranteed, while the United States will get nothing back.”


The Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a Germany-based nonprofit that tracks military, financial and humanitarian support to Ukraine, says European nations —specifically the EU, United Kingdom, Iceland, Norway and Switzerland — have allocated about $140 billion in total in aid for Ukraine, while the United States has allocated about $120 billion in total aid. Total aid includes military, humanitarian and financial aid to Ukraine.


The U.S. has provided about $2 billion more than Europe in military aid for Ukraine, but “European donors have been the main source of [total] aid to Ukraine since 2022, especially when it comes to financial and humanitarian aid,” the institute said in its latest report last week.


The aid to Ukraine constitutes a very small amount of GDP for several nations. For example, the U.S., Germany and the U.K. have mobilized less than 0.2% of their GDP per year to support Kyiv, while contributions from France, Italy and Spain to Ukraine have amounted to about 0.1% of their annual GDP. 


U.S. government math is complex, and spending is massive in scale. A live tracker of U.S. government spending says that the U.S. government has spent about $2.4 trillion in the early part of the 2025 fiscal year. The previous year’s spending was $6.75 trillion. 


Still, scholars were quick to dismiss the accuracy of Trump’s numbers.


“This figure is not true,” said Liana Fix, fellow for Europe at the Council on Foreign Relations. “It's possible to track how much the United States has spent for Ukraine.”

## Pentagon chief eyes funding cuts to some parts of military by 8%

date: 2025-02-19, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has asked some parts of the military to propose what could be cut as part of a potential 8% spending reduction for them over each of the next five years, U.S. officials said on Wednesday, although it was unclear if the total defense budget would shrink.


In a memo described to Reuters by U.S. officials, Hegseth called for the proposals by Feb. 24.


Officials said it did not appear that Hegseth wanted a major budget cut but was looking to reprioritize funding to better align with President Donald Trump's national security priorities.


There was a long list of exemptions, including U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, funding for the military's mission along the U.S. border with Mexico, as well as missile defense and autonomous weapons, one of the officials said.


The military's commands that oversee operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa were not exempt.


The Pentagon's budget is approaching $1 trillion per year. In December, former President Joe Biden signed a bill authorizing $895 billion in defense spending for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30.


Hegseth has said publicly that the Pentagon's focus is on U.S. border security and threats posed by China. He has said the U.S. can no longer be "primarily focused on the security of Europe."


Pentagon employees have braced for firings after businessman Elon Musk's government downsizing teams started working out of the Pentagon.


Some civilian employees in the military said they had started receiving emails on Thursday saying they could be separated from the government since they were hired less than a year ago.


Leaders from across the political spectrum have long criticized waste and inefficiency at the Defense Department.


But Democrats and civil service unions have said Musk, the world's richest person, lacks the expertise to restructure the Pentagon, and the efforts of his team risk exposing classified programs.


Attempting to cancel defense programs could trigger pushback from lawmakers to defend spending in their electoral districts, a fact defense contractors are well aware of.


The F-35, for example, has suppliers located in all 50 U.S. states, a point Lockheed makes with a map on its website detailing the economic value derived from production of the fighter jets.


Musk, himself a major U.S. defense contractor, has a particular disdain for certain defense projects, especially the F-35. He has posted on X that "Some U.S. weapons systems are good, albeit overpriced, but please, in the name of all that is holy, let us stop the worst military value for money in history that is the F-35 program!"

## VOA Russian: Experts say US-Russia talks start of long process

VOA Russian talked to experts after the U.S.-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia on how to end the Ukraine war. They warned that this is only the beginning of negotiations that may last for some time and take several turns. 


Exiled independent Russian political analyst Dmitry Oreshkin compared the first meeting to "not even a warm-up of two boxers, but just a weigh-in ahead of the future bout.” 


Ukrainian expert Volodymyr Fesenko noted that it should come as no surprise that Washington deems negotiations with Moscow more important at this stage than negotiations with Kyiv, as Russia is a nuclear power and will need to be persuaded to consider any compromises.

## VOA Mandarin: What do Canadians think about the threat of US tariffs?

date: 2025-02-19, from: VOA News USA

While the U.S. is holding off on imposing 25% tariffs on Canada, a new poll shows Canadians are angered by U.S. President Donald Trump's threat of tariffs against Canada and his comments about making their nation the 51st U.S. state.  


Observers believe that once the U.S. tariffs are implemented, it will hit the Canadian economy hard and may also allow China to reap the benefits. However, some Chinese American entrepreneurs in Canada say the U.S.-Canada tariff war has limited impact on their business.

## US Army Corps seeks to fast-track 600 'emergency' projects through environmental review

date: 2025-02-19, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has identified over 600 energy and other infrastructure projects that could be fast-tracked under President Donald Trump's National Energy Emergency declaration, according to data posted on its website. 


Among the projects on the list were Enbridge's Line 5 oil pipeline under Lake Michigan, several natural gas power plants, and liquefied natural gas export terminals proposed by Cheniere and Venture Global. 


The Army Corps posted the list, without sending a public notice, last week, marking the projects as eligible for emergency permitting treatment. 


Trump had ordered the Army Corps to issue permits enabling the filling of wetlands and dredging or building in waterways as part of the "National Energy Emergency" he declared in a day-one executive order. 


The Army Corps was not immediately available for comment. 


The fast-tracking of these projects could trigger legal fights over many of the permits that will be issued, with environmental groups warning they are flouting federal laws. 


“This end-run around the normal environmental review process is not only harmful for our waters but is illegal under the Corps’ own emergency permitting regulations,” said David Bookbinder, director of Law and Policy at The Environmental Integrity Project.


Courts may be unwilling to weigh in on the president's criteria for what constitutes a national energy emergency but will more likely weigh how individual projects adhere to the language of the executive order, he said. 




Companies with projects awaiting key permits applauded the move to "streamline" the review process. 


"Line 5 is critical energy infrastructure," said Enbridge spokesperson Gina Sutherland, saying the company has been awaiting a permit for building a Great Lakes Tunnel under Lake Michigan for nearly five years. 


"We are very encouraged to see this action to expedite review for responsible critical mineral development projects," said Jon Cherry, CEO of Perpetua Resources, which is developing a U.S. antimony and gold mine in Idaho with financial support from the Pentagon and U.S. Export-Import Bank. 


The Biden administration had issued the mine a permit, but it still needs a wetlands permit, which Cherry said he expects to receive by July. 


The Army Corps has in the past issued emergency designations to skip over environmental reviews in cases in which the project addressed poses a threat to human life. 


Environmental and watchdog groups say that most of the projects marked as emergencies on the list do not meet the Army Corps' definition of an emergency. They also question the Trump administration's justification for declaring a national energy emergency.  


"It is laughable to see Line 5 on this list," said Debbie Chizewer, managing attorney for the Midwestern office of Earthjustice, which represents the Bay Mills Indian Community in opposition of the project. "It's a pipeline that carries crude oil from Canada to Canada and will not increase U.S. capacity or respond to Trump's declared energy emergency." 


Other projects do not relate to energy production, including a home-building project built on land owned by oil giant Chevron in California, as well as an aerial electrical distribution line to private waterfront residences in Alabama. 


There are at least five dozen solar energy projects on the list. Solar and wind energy were excluded from the definition of energy in Trump's energy emergency order. 


West Virginia has the largest number of projects on the list at 141. There are 60 in Pennsylvania, 57 in Texas, 42 in Florida, and 41 in Ohio, according to the Environmental Integrity Project, which is tracking the permits. 


Officials at Venture Global and Cheniere were not immediately available to comment.

## US judge delays ruling on federal request to drop case against New York City mayor

date: 2025-02-19, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — New York City Mayor Eric Adams told a federal judge Wednesday that he is innocent and doesn't fear corruption charges could be refiled if a Justice Department request to dismiss them is granted. 


Judge Dale E. Ho ended the hearing by saying he wouldn't rule immediately but he was aware that "it's not in anyone's interest here for this to drag on." 


During the hearing, Ho asked the mayor questions to ensure he understood that if the charges were dropped, they could later be reinstated. 


"I have not committed a crime," Adams said. "I'm not afraid of that." 


Deputy U.S. Attorney General Emil Bove said the request to drop the corruption charges against the mayor resulted from "a straightforward exercise in prosecutorial discretion guided" by President Donald Trump's executive order on weaponization of the justice system and Attorney General Pam Bondi's memorandum outlining the same. 


Bove said he believed the request to drop charges, when tied to Trump's order and Bondi's conclusions, made it "virtually unreviewable in this courtroom." 


Bove said he also believed "the continuation of this prosecution is interfering with both national security and immigration enforcement initiatives being carried out by the executive branch." 


Ho scheduled the hearing after three Trump administration lawyers, including Bove, made the dismissal request on Friday. Manhattan's top federal prosecutor resigned after she refused an order to do so. 


An indictment charges the first-term Democrat with accepting more than $100,000 in illegal campaign contributions and lavish travel perks from a Turkish official and business leaders seeking to buy Adams' influence while he was Brooklyn borough president. Adams has pleaded not guilty. He faces multiple challengers in the Democratic primary in June. 


Closely watching the judicial proceedings is Democratic Governor Kathy Hochul, who is considering whether to remove Adams from office amid concerns that he reached a deal to have the case dropped in exchange for the mayor's political fealty to Trump. 


Early last week, Bove told prosecutors in New York to drop the charges because the prosecution "has unduly restricted Mayor Adams' ability to devote full attention and resources to the illegal immigration and violent crime." Bove said charges could be reinstated after November's mayoral election. 


Two days later, then-interim U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon told Bondi in a letter that dismissing the charges in return for Adams' assistance in enforcing federal immigration laws would betray Bondi's own words that she "will not tolerate abuses of the criminal justice process, coercive behavior, or other forms of misconduct." 


"Dismissal of the indictment for no other reason than to influence Adams's mayoral decision-making would be all three," said Sassoon, a Republican. She said it amounted to a "quid pro quo" deal and disclosed that prosecutors were about to bring additional obstruction of justice charges against Adams. 


Bove, in accepting Sassoon's resignation, accused her of "pursuing a politically motivated prosecution despite an express instruction to dismiss the case." He informed her that two other prosecutors assigned to the case were being suspended with pay and that an investigation would determine if they would keep their jobs. 


One prosecutor, Hagan Scotten, quit the following day. In all, seven prosecutors, including five high-ranking prosecutors at the Justice Department, had resigned by Friday.

## WTO holds 'constructive' talks after China condemns Trump tariffs

date: 2025-02-19, from: VOA News USA

GENEVA — The World Trade Organization said on Wednesday that discussions on trade tensions were "constructive," after China accused the United States of imposing "tariff shocks" that could upend the global trading system.


China condemned tariffs launched or threatened by U.S. President Donald Trump at a WTO meeting on Tuesday. Washington dismissed China's comments as hypocritical.


Trump has announced sweeping 10% tariffs on all Chinese imports, prompting Beijing to respond with retaliatory tariffs and to file a WTO dispute against Washington in what could be an early test of Trump's stance towards the institution.


The majority of the six countries that participated in the talks on trade turbulence, put on the agenda by China, raised concern about mounting tensions, but also called for restraint, said WTO spokesperson Ismaila Dieng in a press conference in Geneva on Wednesday.


The United States, Nicaragua, Namibia, Malaysia, Trinidad and Tobago, and Russia took part in the discussions, which were part of broader talks on trade.


The large majority "stressed the importance of upholding WTO principles and values and called for action to preserve the stability and effectiveness of the global trading system," Dieng added.


Two trade sources at the meeting told Reuters that some countries expressed deep concern about the ramifications of tariffs, while others criticized China for alleged market distortions.


It is the first time that mounting trade frictions were formally addressed on the agenda of the watchdog's top decision-making body, the General Council.


'Tariff shocks'


"These 'tariff shocks' heighten economic uncertainty, disrupt global trade, and risk domestic inflation, market distortion, or even global recession," China's ambassador to the WTO, Li Chenggang, said at a closed-door meeting of the global trade body on Tuesday, according to a statement sent to Reuters.


"Worse, the U.S. unilateralism threatens to upend the rules-based multilateral trading system."


U.S. envoy David Bisbee called China's economy a "predatory non-market economic system" in response and accused it of violating and evading WTO rules.


Negotiating tactic


Some delegates said they saw China's intervention as an attempt to show itself supporting WTO rules — a posture that can help China win allies in ongoing global trade negotiations.


Disputes between the two top economies at the WTO long pre-date Trump's arrival. Beijing has accused Washington of breaking rules while Washington says Beijing does not deserve its "developing country" status at the WTO.


The Trump administration has announced plans to withdraw or disengage from other global organizations, but the WTO has not yet been a major focus for the White House.


However, incoming U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer has called the WTO "deeply flawed."

## Europe frozen out of peace talks as Russia's war on Ukraine enters fourth year

date: 2025-02-19, from: VOA News USA

LONDON — Russia’s tanks rolled across the Ukrainian border three years ago this month, triggering the worst conflict on European soil since World War II. Ukraine has resisted the full-scale invasion largely thanks to the support of the United States and Europe. 


But on the frozen front lines, the war grinds on — and Russia’s forces are slowly edging forward.  


“Every day, it pushes back the Ukrainian front line somewhere by a kilometer or so. My judgment is that it could continue to do that over the rest of this year,” said Ben Barry, senior fellow for land warfare at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. 


“We must remember this is a terrible war. My judgment is that over a million people have been killed or seriously wounded. Now the balance of casualties is probably in Ukraine's favor. A figure of 700,000 or 800,000 Russian casualties seems credible to me. President [Volodymyr] Zelenskyy says Ukraine has only suffered 48,000 killed. That seems implausibly low to me,” Barry told Agence France-Presse. 


Europe excluded 


As the war enters its fourth year, Europe and Ukraine fear they are being excluded from deciding their own fate. Behind the scenes, the geopolitical forces that are shaping the conflict appear to be changing fast.  


Russia and the United States began peace talks this week in Saudi Arabia. Ukraine and Europe were not invited.  


“There will be some very significant alarm in European capitals about what might be discussed with regards to the security of their continent, their whole region,” said David Blagden, associate professor of international security at the University of Exeter. 


“One sort of potentially really bad outcome for European capitals is to discover that the Americans have basically put them on the hook for attempting to do some sort of peacekeeping mission in Ukraine or whatever without their say-so,” he told Reuters.  


Peacekeepers 


Britain and France have already said they may be willing to contribute to a peacekeeping force in Ukraine, a requirement of an estimated 100,000 troops.  


There are deep concerns over the potential risks of sending peacekeeping troops, according to Armida van Rij, head of the Europe program at London’s Chatham House. 


“The U.S. seemed to have taken away NATO's Article 5 protection [on collective self-defense] for any troops that would be put in Ukraine. That means that they would not be protected, so that deterrent effect is gone. We know that Russia tends to break agreements. It has a long history of doing that under [President Vladimir] Putin and previous presidents. So, it is quite likely that Russia may well break the terms of any ceasefire or peace agreement that may come ...  and then the question is, ‘OK, so what do the Europeans then do in response?' That might put them in direct confrontation with Russia, which is a terrifying thought," van Rij told VOA. 


Defense spending 


The European Union says it has provided around $145 billion in military, financial, humanitarian and refugee aid to Ukraine over the past three years, more than half the total global assistance for Kyiv. 


U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said this month that European security will no longer be a priority, and Washington is demanding NATO allies increase their defense spending. 


“Where that money's going to come from is a key question,” said van Rij. “The European Commission seems open to allowing some flexibility to their fiscal rules, which will make it a little bit easier for countries to spend on defense. But all of that still takes time, so it's still going to be really difficult." 


Hard decisions will have profound implications for Europe, according to British Defense Secretary John Healey.  


“The decisions that we make right now over the coming weeks will not only define the outcome of the conflict in Ukraine, but the security of our world for a generation to come,” Healey said in a speech Tuesday in London.

## US envoy in Ukraine for talks following US-Russia meeting

date: 2025-02-19, from: VOA News USA

U.S. President Donald Trump’s envoy for Ukraine and Russia said Wednesday the United States understands the needs for security guarantees for Ukraine, as he visited the country for talks with Ukrainian officials.


Gen. Keith Kellogg told reporters in Kyiv that he was in Ukraine “to listen,” hear the concerns of Ukrainian leaders and return to the United States to consult President Trump.


Kellogg said the United States wants the war in Ukraine to end, saying that would be good for the region and the world.


Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters ahead of an expected meeting with Kellogg that while U.S. officials have said there will be no U.S. troops deployed as part of any potential post-war peacekeeping mission, there are still other ways it can help, such as providing air defense systems.


"You don't want boots on the ground, you don't want NATO,” Zelenskyy said. “Okay, can we have Patriots? Enough Patriots?"


The discussions in Kyiv come amid a flurry of diplomatic efforts focused on Russia’s war in Ukraine, including French President Emmanuel Macron hosting European leaders Wednesday for a second round of talks about the conflict and European support for Ukraine.


Kellogg also met earlier this week with European leaders, and on Tuesday U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio held talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Saudi Arabia.




Rubio said both Ukraine and Russia would have to make concessions to achieve peace.



“The goal is to bring an end to this conflict in a way that's fair, enduring, sustainable and acceptable to all parties involved," Rubio told reporters. No Ukrainian or European officials were at the table for the talks.


Zelenskyy objected to being excluded from the meeting, a position that drew criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump.


“Today I heard, ‘Well, we weren’t invited.’ Well, you’ve been there for three years,” Trump said of Ukraine’s leaders. “You should have never started it.”


Russia began the war with its February 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine.




Zelenskyy added Wednesday that while he has “great respect” for Trump, the American leader is living in a Russian-made “disinformation space.”


 




Zelenskyy postponed a trip to Saudi Arabia that had been scheduled for this week, suggesting that he wanted to avoid his visit being linked to the U.S.-Russia negotiations.



The United States and Russia agreed to "appoint respective high-level teams to begin working on a path to ending the conflict in Ukraine as soon as possible," State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said in a statement. Bruce characterized the meeting as "an important step forward" toward peace.


Rubio said Ukraine and European nations would have to be involved in talks on ending the war. He said that if the war is halted, the United States would have "extraordinary opportunities … to partner" with Russia on trade and other global issues.


European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said she and other European foreign ministers spoke to Rubio after the U.S.-Russia meeting, and she expressed support for a Ukraine-led resolution.


“Russia will try to divide us. Let’s not walk into their traps,” Kallas said on X. “By working together with the US, we can achieve a just and lasting peace — on Ukraine’s terms.”


Russia now controls about one-fifth of Ukraine’s internationally recognized 2014 territory, including the Crimean Peninsula that it unilaterally annexed in 2014, a large portion of eastern Ukraine that pro-Russian separatists captured in subsequent fighting, and land Russia has taken over since the 2022 invasion.



As the invasion started, Moscow hoped for a quick takeover of all of Ukraine. But with stiff Ukrainian resistance, the war instead evolved into a grinding ground conflict and daily aerial bombardments by each side.



Zelenskyy has long demanded that his country’s 2014 boundaries be restored, but U.S. officials have said that is unrealistic, as is Kyiv’s long-sought goal of joining NATO.

## UAE says it rejects any attempt to displace Palestinian people

date: 2025-02-19, from: VOA News USA

United Arab Emirates President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan told U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio that the UAE rejects “any attempts to displace the Palestinian people from their land” as Rubio made a visit Wednesday to Abu Dhabi.


UAE state media reported the comments and said the president highlighted the need to prevent an expansion of the conflict in Gaza.


“He also underscored the importance of linking Gaza’s reconstruction to a path that leads to a comprehensive and lasting peace based on the two-state solution, as the only manner of ensuring stability in the region,” the report said.


Arab leaders have rejected plans suggested by U.S. President Donald Trump that Palestinians leave Gaza for other countries in the region, and that the U.S. take over and rebuild the Palestinian enclave.




Rubio’s visit was part of a multi-nation tour that also included talks with leaders in Israel and in Saudi Arabia, which came as the first phase of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip moved into its final weeks.


Hostage release


A top Hamas leader said Tuesday that the militant group plans to release six more living Israeli hostages from their Gaza captivity on Saturday and the bodies of four others on Thursday.


Hamas leader Khalil al-Hayya made the surprise announcement in a recorded statement, an apparent response to the Israeli decision to allow long-requested mobile homes and construction equipment into the Gaza Strip.




The six living hostages are the last set to be freed under the first phase of the ceasefire that expires in early March, with Hamas believed to be holding about 70 more captives, half of them living. Four more bodies of hostages are set to be returned next week.


So far during the ceasefire, Hamas has released 24 hostages, and Israel freed more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners.


The warring sides have yet to negotiate the second and more difficult phase of their truce, in which Hamas says it will only release the remaining hostages in exchange for a lasting halt to the fighting and a full Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza.


Meanwhile, Israel has not backed off its goal, supported by the United States, of eradicating any military or governing role for Hamas in Gaza.


Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said Tuesday that Israel was ready to open negotiations on the details of the second phase. Those talks were supposed to have started two weeks ago, according to the ceasefire deal.


In his remarks, Hayya said the "Bibas family" would be included in the handover of the four bodies, apparently referring to Shiri Bibas and her two young sons, Ariel and Kfir, who for many Israelis embody the captives' plight.


Israel has not confirmed their deaths, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office urged the public not to distribute "photos, names and rumors." Israel has said it was gravely concerned about the Bibas family, while Hamas said they were killed in an Israeli airstrike early in the war. Yarden Bibas, the husband and father, was kidnapped separately and released this month.


Kfir, who was 9 months old at the time, was the youngest hostage taken in Hamas' October 7, 2023, attack on Israel that triggered 15 months of fighting. Video footage of the abduction showed Shiri swaddling her redheaded boys in a blanket and being whisked away by armed men.


"In recent hours we have been shaken after the Hamas spokesman's announcement was published about the return of our Shiri, Ariel and Kfir this coming Thursday as part of the movement to release kidnapped civilians,” the family said in a statement. “It is important for us to say that we are aware of the reports but have not yet received an official update on the matter.”


“Until we receive certainty, our journey will not end,” the family said.


An Israeli official said Netanyahu had agreed to allow the mobile homes and construction equipment into Gaza to accelerate the hostages' release. Hamas last week threatened to hold up the release of more hostages, citing the mobile home issue and other alleged violations of the truce.


Israel is expected to continue releasing hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, including many serving life sentences for deadly attacks, in exchange for the hostages.


Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group, killed about 1,200 people in the October 2023 attack and took about 250 as hostages. More than half the captives have been released in ceasefire agreements and other deals, while eight were rescued in military operations.


Israel's air and ground war killed more than 48,200 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants. The Israeli military says the death toll includes 17,000 militants. The offensive destroyed vast areas of Gaza and displaced most of its population of 2.3 million.

## US condemns 'dangerous' maneuvers by Chinese navy in South China Sea

date: 2025-02-19, from: VOA News USA

MANILA, Philippines — The United States condemned the "dangerous" maneuvers of a Chinese navy helicopter that endangered the safety of a Philippine government aircraft patrolling a disputed shoal in the South China Sea, its ambassador to Manila said on Wednesday.


In a post on X, Ambassador MaryKay Carlson also called on China "to refrain from coercive actions and settle its disputes peacefully in accordance with international law."


The Philippines said late on Tuesday it was "deeply disturbed" by the Chinese navy's "unprofessional and reckless" flight actions and that it will make a diplomatic protest.


Manila's coast guard said the Chinese navy helicopter performed dangerous flight maneuvers when it flew close to a government aircraft conducting surveillance over the Scarborough Shoal, endangering the lives of its pilots and passengers.


China disputed the Philippines' account, saying on Tuesday its aircraft "illegally intruded" into China's airspace and accused its Southeast Asian neighbor of "spreading false narratives."


Named after a British ship that was grounded on the atoll nearly three centuries ago, the Scarborough Shoal is one of the most contested maritime features in the South China Sea, where Beijing and Manila have clashed repeatedly.


"The Philippines has undeniable sovereignty and jurisdiction over Bajo de Masinloc," its maritime council said in a statement, using Manila's name for the shoal.


China claims sovereignty over almost the entire South China Sea, a vital waterway for more than $3 trillion of annual ship-borne commerce, putting it at odds with Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam.


A 2016 arbitration ruling invalidated China's expansive claims but Beijing does not recognize the decision.

## Senate advances nomination of Trump FBI pick Kash Patel

date: 2025-02-19, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate on Tuesday voted to advance the nomination of Kash Patel to be the director of the FBI, putting a staunch ally of President Donald Trump and a critic of the bureau on track to run the most prominent U.S. law enforcement agency.


The Senate voted 48-45 along party lines on a procedural measure setting the stage for a final confirmation vote on one of Trump’s most controversial nominees later this week.


Patel, a former intelligence and Defense Department official in Trump’s first term, has called for a radical reshaping of the FBI, pledging to expand its role on illegal immigration and violent crime, core Trump priorities.


Patel has been among the most vocal critics of FBI investigations into Trump on issues ranging from Russian interference in the 2016 election, Trump’s retention of classified documents at his Florida club and his attempts to overturn the 2020 election.


Democrats have called Patel unfit to lead the FBI, pointing to his embrace of false claims about voter fraud in the 2020 election and FBI agents fomenting the January 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol. But Patel has attracted broad support from Republicans, who have touted him as a reformer.


A Senate panel voted 12-10 along party lines last week to send his nomination to the full Senate.

## Senate confirms Howard Lutnick as commerce secretary

date: 2025-02-19, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The Senate confirmed wealthy financier Howard Lutnick as commerce secretary Tuesday, putting in place a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump's hardline trade policies.


At the Commerce Department, Lutnick, who was CEO at the investment firm Cantor Fitzgerald, will oversee 50,000 employees who do everything from collecting economic statistics to running the census to issuing weather reports. But he's likely to spend a lot of time — along with Jamieson Greer, Trump's nominee to be the top U.S. trade negotiator — managing the president's aggressive plans to impose import taxes on U.S. trading partners, including allies and adversaries alike.


The Senate vote to confirm Lutnick was 51-45.


Trump views the tariffs as a versatile economic tool. They can raise money to finance his tax cuts elsewhere, protect U.S. industries and pressure other countries into making concessions on such issues as their own trade barriers, immigration and drug trafficking. Mainstream economists mostly view tariffs as counterproductive: They are paid by import companies in the United States, which try to pass along the higher costs to consumers and can thereby add to inflationary pressures throughout the economy.


At his confirmation hearing last month, Lutnick dismissed as "nonsense'' the idea that tariffs contribute to inflation. He expressed support for deploying across-the-board tariffs "country by country'' to strong-arm other countries into lowering barriers to American exports.


Trump last week announced plans for "reciprocal'' tariffs — raising U.S. import tax rates to match the higher taxes that other countries impose on goods from the U.S. The move would shatter the rules that have governed world trade for decades. Since the 1960s, tariff rates have mostly emerged from negotiations between dozens of countries. Trump is commandeering the process.


The president has also imposed 10% tariffs on Chinese imports and effectively raised U.S. taxes on foreign steel and aluminum. He has threatened — and delayed until March 4 — 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico.


Lutnick was CEO at Cantor Fitzgerald when its offices were hit in the Sept. 11, 2001, attack on the World Trade Center. The firm lost two-thirds of its employees — 658 people — that day, including Lutnick's brother. Howard Lutnick led the firm's recovery and is a member of the Board of Directors of the National September 11 Memorial & Museum.


Lutnick has promised to sell off his business holdings. They're complicated. His financial disclosure statement showed that he had positions in more than 800 businesses and other private organizations.

## 66 measles cases reported in US states of Texas, New Mexico

date: 2025-02-19, from: VOA News USA

Measles is making a comeback in the United States. 


Fifty-eight cases of the highly contagious disease were reported Tuesday by health officials in rural West Texas, while eight cases were confirmed in neighboring eastern New Mexico.  


Texas officials say the outbreak there, the largest in almost 30 years, is mainly confined to Gaines County, with 45 infections, but four other counties account for an additional 13 cases.   


The Texas measles cases, according to health officials, have occurred mainly among a "close-knit, undervaccinated" Mennonite community. 


Authorities say at least three of the New Mexico cases are in counties that border Texas' Gaines County. 


Earlier this month, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 14 measles cases across the country.  


Mayo Clinic describes measles as "a childhood infection caused by a virus. Once quite common, measles can now almost always be prevented with a vaccine ... measles spreads easily and can be serious, and even fatal, for small children." 


Measles is a respiratory virus that can survive in the air for two hours. As many as nine out of 10 people who are susceptible will get the virus if exposed, according to the CDC.  


However, in recent years, the necessity and safety of the vaccinations designed to prevent the disease have come under question, with some parents citing a now-discredited study that linked the measles vaccine to autism.  


Another unfortunate development in the fight against measles happened during the COVID-19 pandemic when many children missed their vaccinations. Los Angeles Cedars Sinai said in a statement in February 2024 that 61 million fewer doses of the measles vaccine were distributed nationwide from 2020 to 2022.  


Before the MMR vaccination, which addresses not only measles, but also mumps and rubella, was introduced in the U.S. in 1963, there were 3 million to 4 million measles cases every year.   


Now there are usually fewer than 200 cases per year, but pockets of measles persist in areas that still resist the vaccinations. The shots are first given to toddlers between 12 and 15 months and then again at 4 to 6 years of age.

## Saudi prince proving crucial to Trump efforts to end Ukraine, Gaza wars

date: 2025-02-19, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Top U.S. and Russian officials wrapped up their meetings Tuesday in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, to discuss a pathway to end the war in Ukraine, days before Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is set to convene a summit with leaders from Egypt, Jordan, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates to discuss an Arab response to U.S. President Donald Trump's vow to take over Gaza.


The two separate talks reflect the growing role of the prince in Trump's efforts to fulfill his campaign promise to end the wars in Ukraine and Gaza.


On Tuesday, Trump again declared he would swiftly end fighting.


"I have the power to end this war," Trump said from Mar-a-Lago, his residence in Florida, dismissing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's concern that Kyiv was excluded from the Riyadh meeting.


"Well, you've been there for three years, you should have ended it," he said of Zelenskyy in response to a reporter's question. "I could have made a deal for Ukraine that would have given them almost all of the land."


Trump did not clarify which part of land would remain Ukrainian. Russia began its full-scale invasion in February 2022 and now controls parts of the Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia regions, and fighting has been ongoing at the borders of Kharkiv and Mykolaiv. Russia annexed Crimea in 2014.


The Saudi talks signaled a major détente between Washington and Moscow and an abrupt end of U.S. policy under former President Joe Biden to isolate Russia and support Ukraine "for as long as it takes."


Instead, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio dangled the prospects of "the incredible opportunities that exist to partner with the Russians" on trade and other global issues when the war ends.


Arab response to Gaza plan


Later this week, Prince Mohammed will bring together leaders from Egypt, Jordan, Qatar and the UAE to discuss an Arab response to Trump's vow to take over Gaza and create a "Riviera in the Middle East" by expelling Palestinians from Gaza to neighboring countries.


Trump's plan has angered regional leaders, who are now scrambling to come up with a counteroffer that they will discuss in Riyadh ahead of a broader Arab League gathering in Cairo next week.


One of the Arab proposals being discussed is an Egyptian-led plan that involves forming a national Palestinian committee to govern Gaza without Hamas and raising up to $20 billion from Arab and Gulf states over three years for reconstruction.


As Saudi Arabia makes a play for the diplomatic mainstage, Prince Mohammed is motivated to be proactive rather than reactive, to counsel pragmatism rather than rigidity, said Laura Blumenfeld, a senior fellow and Middle East analyst at the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies.


Blumenfeld told VOA that the prince could pair his approach with a language that Trump likes to speak: investments.


On Wednesday, global financiers and tech executives will gather in Miami, Florida, in a conference hosted by the Future Investment Initiative Institute, a nonprofit arm of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund — the kingdom's sovereign wealth fund led by the prince. Trump is scheduled to deliver an address at the event.


"Trump is a peacemaker in a hurry, with his eye on the Nobel Prize. [The prince] is a dealmaker in a hurry, with his eye on the Saudi Vision 2030 economic diversification plan," Blumenfeld added. "The two men are a match made in transactional heaven."


Prince Mohammed the power broker


With his efforts focused on Ukraine and Gaza, the 39-year-old de facto leader of Saudi Arabia has emerged as a power broker that Trump leans on for his foreign policy goals.


Prince Mohammed has done this in part by leveraging close ties during Trump's first term, maintaining business ties while Trump was out of office, and further expanding the relationship since the president's inauguration last month.


Saudi Arabia was Trump's first foreign trip in 2017, where he signed several deals, including a $110 billion arms deal, which could expand up to $350 billion over 10 years.


Trump spoke openly about the transactional nature of the visit, telling reporters days after his second inauguration in January that the reason he chose Riyadh for that first visit was because "they agreed to buy $450 billion worth of our products."


Trump suggested on the day of his last inauguration that he would again make Saudi Arabia his first destination in return for Saudi funds, and days later, the prince told him during a phone call that he planned to invest $600 billion or more in the U.S. over the next four years.


In 2021, Saudi Arabia invested $2 billion with a firm that belonged to Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and former aide. The Trump Organization has also expanded its real estate presence in the region, announcing it had leased its brand to two real estate projects in Riyadh in December after launching the Trump Tower project in Jeddah.


As Prince Mohammed cultivated his political and business ties with Trump, he maintained a relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin amid Biden's effort to isolate the Russian leader following his 2022 invasion of Ukraine.


"The crown prince has been making the argument for the last five years that it's in America's interest that Saudi Arabia maintains very good ties with Russia and China," said Ali Shihabi, author and commentator on the politics and economics of Saudi Arabia.


"Saudi Arabia was insisting on maintaining a multipolar policy while maintaining very strong ties with the United States," he told VOA.


The prince is poised to host a summit between the two leaders that Trump said he agreed to during his call with Putin last week. The summit, Shihabi said, would be an example of how the prince's gambit has paid off.


"I don't think there are any leaders in the world that have the relationship that the crown prince has with both Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump," he said.


There is also a practical reason. The kingdom is not a signatory of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, which issued an arrest warrant for Putin in 2023.

## Judge won't block Musk, DOGE from federal data, layoffs

date: 2025-02-19, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — A federal judge refused Tuesday to immediately block billionaire Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency from accessing government data systems or participating in worker layoffs. 


U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan found that there are legitimate questions about Musk's authority but said there isn't evidence of the kind of grave legal harm that would justify a temporary restraining order. 


The decision came in a lawsuit filed by 14 Democratic states challenging DOGE's authority to access sensitive government data. The attorneys general argued that Musk is wielding the kind of power that the Constitution says can only be held by those who are elected or confirmed by the Senate. 


The Trump administration, for its part, has maintained that layoffs are coming from agency heads, and asserted that despite his public cheering of the effort, Musk isn't directly running DOGE's day-to-day operations himself. 


DOGE has tapped into computer systems across multiple agencies with the blessing of President Donald Trump, digging into budgets and searching for what he calls waste, fraud and abuse, even as a growing number of lawsuits allege DOGE is violating the law. 


Chutkan recognized the concerns of the group of states, which include New Mexico and Arizona. 


"DOGE's unpredictable actions have resulted in considerable uncertainty and confusion," she wrote. Their questions about Musk's apparent "unchecked authority" and lack of Congressional oversight for DOGE are legitimate and they may be able to successfully argue them later. 


Still, at this point, it remains unclear exactly how DOGE's work will affect the states, and judges can only issue court only issue orders to block specific, immediate harms, she found. 


Chutkan, who was nominated by Democratic President Barack Obama, previously oversaw the now-dismissed criminal election interference case against Trump in Washington.

## Trump signs order to study how to make IVF more accessible, affordable

date: 2025-02-19, from: VOA News USA

WEST PALM BEACH, FLORIDA — U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday signed an executive order to study how to expand access to in vitro fertilization and make it more affordable. 


The order calls for policy recommendations to "protect IVF access and aggressively reduce out-of-pocket and health plan costs for such treatments," according to the White House. On the campaign trail, Trump called for universal coverage of IVF treatment after his Supreme Court nominees helped to overturn Roe v. Wade, leading to a wave of restrictions in Republican-led states, including some that have threatened access to IVF by trying to define life as beginning at conception. 


Trump, who was at his Florida residence and club Mar-a-Lago, also signed another executive order and a presidential memorandum. The second executive order outlined the oversight functions of the Office of Management and Budget, while the presidential memorandum called for more transparency from the government, according to White House staff secretary Will Scharf, who Trump called to the podium to detail the orders. 


The order called for "radical transparency requirements" for the government, requiring it to detail the "waste, fraud and abuse" that's found as the Department of Government Efficiency, overseen by Elon Musk, looks to cut government spending. 


DOGE has often fallen short of the administration's promises of transparency. Musk has taken questions from journalists only once since becoming Trump's most powerful adviser, and he's claimed it's illegal to name people who are working for him. Sometimes DOGE staff members have demanded access to sensitive government databases with little explanation. 


According to a fact sheet provided by the White House, Trump's IVF order will focus on prioritizing whether there are any current policies "that exacerbate the cost of IVF treatments." 


Last year, Trump declared public support for IVF after the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos can be considered children under state law. The decision, which some Republicans and conservatives cheered, touched off immediate backlash. 


Families 'appreciative,' says Trump


On the campaign trail, IVF quickly became a talking point for Trump, who said he strongly supports its availability. 


In vitro fertilization offers a possible solution when a woman has trouble getting pregnant. The procedure involves retrieving her eggs and combining them in a lab dish with a man's sperm to create a fertilized embryo, which is then transferred into the woman's uterus in an attempt to create a pregnancy. IVF is done in cycles, and more than one may be required. 


"I think the women and families, husbands, are very appreciative of it," Trump said in brief remarks on the order, before he took questions on a variety of topics. 


Trump, who spent the morning at his golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida, spoke to reporters hours before his first joint TV interview with adviser Elon Musk airs in prime time. 


Trump and Musk gave their first joint interview to Sean Hannity of Fox News Channel. The interview was taped on Friday at the White House and is set to air as Musk leads Trump's effort to cut federal spending and slash the federal workforce. 


Musk has drawn criticism from Democrats in Congress and others for the methods he and his team at DOGE are using to cut spending, including foreign aid, and eliminate jobs across the bureaucracy. 


The Fox News interview also follows Musk's appearance with Trump in the Oval Office last week, when both defended Musk's approach to federal cost-cutting. 


In an excerpt from the interview that Fox News released on Sunday, Musk said he "used to be adored by the left" but "less so these days" because of the work he's doing at Trump's direction. 


"They call it Trump derangement syndrome. You don't realize how real this is until you can't reason with people," Musk said, adding that normal conversations with Democrats about the president are difficult because "it's like they've become completely irrational." 


Event celebrates 'American Exceptionalism'


Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club is the setting Tuesday night for an awards program by America's Future, a conservative group led by Mike Flynn, who briefly served as national security adviser in the Republican president's first term. The program aims to preserve individual rights and promote American values and traditions, according to its website. The event, called Celebrate American Exceptionalism 2025, will honor one member from the Army, the Navy, the Marines, the Air Force and the Space Force. 


The event includes a poolside reception, musical performances and dinner in Mar-a-Lago's Grand Ballroom, where other award presentations are expected from a lineup that includes such names as comedian Russell Brand, singer Ted Nugent and former pro boxer Mike Tyson. 


It's unclear whether Trump will participate in the event.

## US Postal Service head to step down after 5 years

date: 2025-02-18, from: VOA News USA

Louis DeJoy, the head of the U.S. Postal Service, intends to step down, the federal agency said Tuesday, after a nearly five-year tenure marked by the coronavirus pandemic, surges in mail-in election ballots and efforts to stem losses through cost and service cuts.


In a Monday letter, Postmaster General DeJoy asked the Postal Service Board of Governors to begin looking for his successor.


"As you know, I have worked tirelessly to lead the 640,000 men and women of the Postal Service in accomplishing an extraordinary transformation," he wrote. "We have served the American people through an unprecedented pandemic and through a period of high inflation and sensationalized politics."


DeJoy took the helm of the Postal Service in the summer of 2020 during President Donald Trump's first term. He was a Republican donor who owned a logistics business before taking office and was the first postmaster general in nearly two decades who was not a career postal employee.


DeJoy developed a 10-year plan to modernize operations and stem losses. He previously said that postal customers should get used to "uncomfortable" rate hikes as the Postal Service seeks to stabilize its finances and become more self-sufficient.


The plan calls for making the mail delivery system more efficient and less costly by consolidating mail processing centers. Critics, including members of Congress from several states, have said the first consolidations slowed service and that further consolidations could particularly hurt rural mail delivery.


DeJoy has disputed that and told a U.S. House subcommittee during a contentious September hearing that the Postal Service had embarked on long-overdue investments in facilities and making other changes to create "a Postal Service for the future" that delivered mail more quickly.


DeJoy also oversaw the Postal Service during two presidential elections that saw spikes in mail-in ballots.


Ahead of the 2020 presidential election, a federal judge limited one of the Postal Service's cost-cutting practices after finding it contributed to delays in mail delivery.


DeJoy had restricted overtime payments for postal workers and stopped the agency's longtime practice of allowing late and extra truck deliveries in the summer of 2020. The moves reduced costs but meant some mail was left to be delivered the following day.


DeJoy said in his letter that he was committed to being "as helpful as possible in facilitating a transition."

## More than 170 migrants now detained at Guantanamo Bay

date: 2025-02-18, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The United States has more than doubled the number of detainees — both those deemed to be a "high threat" as well as others slated for deportation — at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. 


As of Tuesday, there were more than 120 of what the administration calls "criminal aliens" under guard at the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, according to a U.S. defense official.  


Approximately 50 other individuals are also being held at the base's migrant facility, which was being readied to hold nonviolent individuals.  


Separately, a second U.S. defense official told VOA that as of Monday, the U.S. military had sent a total of 13 flights of undocumented migrants to Guantanamo aboard a mix of C-17 and C-130 military cargo jets. 


So far, none of the detainees brought to the facilities at Guantanamo Bay have been deported to other countries. 


Both officials spoke to VOA on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss details of the military's deportation operation. 


VOA has also reached out to the Department of Homeland Security, which is spearheading the U.S. deportation efforts, as well as Immigration and Customs Enforcement, about the growing number of detainees. 


Last Thursday, the commander of U.S. Southern Command, which oversees operations at the naval base at Guantanamo Bay, told lawmakers there were about 68 detainees at the base's prison facility. 


Admiral Alvin Holsey also told lawmakers that the base's migrant facility had the capacity to hold about 2,500 nonviolent detainees. Efforts are underway to allow it house as many as 30,000 nonviolent migrants slated for deportation.  




Holsey said that it was too soon to determine how much it will cost to house the growing number of individuals.  


"We're working with DHS to understand the flow of migrants," he said during Thursday's hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee. "We're not going to go to 30,000 unless we know that migrant flow will come. So, we're waiting at this point."    


Details about the growing population of detainees at the U.S. naval base in Cuba come just a day after the Department of Homeland Security unveiled what it described as a multimillion-dollar ad campaign warning migrants not to enter the U.S. illegally. 


"If you are considering entering America illegally, don't even think about it," Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a video targeting an international audience. 


"If you come to our country and you break our laws, we will hunt you down," she said. "Criminals are not welcome in the United States." 


Noem, who visited the prison facility last Friday and oversaw the transfer of a third flight of detainees to the detention center, has repeatedly described the men as "murderers and vicious gang members" from Venezuela and as "the worst of the worst."   


In one social media post, Noem said that at least one of the migrants sent to Guantanamo Bay had confessed to murder, while others were wanted for attempted murder, assault, weapons trafficking and impersonation. 


One official, speaking to VOA on the condition of anonymity to discuss the deportation efforts, said that all of the individuals held at Guantanamo Bay have been issued final deportation orders. But DHS has not yet provided charging documents or other details regarding the crimes the detainees are accused of committing.   




Last Wednesday, the American Civil Liberties Union, along with several immigration rights groups, filed a lawsuit against DHS, alleging the detainees being held at the Guantanamo Bay prison facility have been improperly denied access to lawyers.  


DHS has dismissed the lawsuit's allegations.  


"There is a system for phone utilization to reach lawyers," said a senior Homeland Security official in a written statement shared with VOA.  


"If the AMERICAN Civil Liberties Union cares more about highly dangerous criminal aliens including murderers & vicious gang members than they do about American citizens — they should change their name," the official added, responding to the lawsuit only on the condition of anonymity.

## “Stream Big” looks at the challenges of making it as a Twitch streamer

## Rubio snubs South Africa's G20 meeting amid diplomatic tensions

date: 2025-02-18, from: VOA News USA

Johannesburg  — South Africa will host a meeting of foreign ministers from the G20 group of major economies later this week, but the chief diplomat for the world’s largest economy, the U.S., is skipping it.


Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced on X earlier this month that he would not attend the meeting, taking place Thursday and Friday in Johannesburg, because he objected to the meeting’s agenda, which he described as anti-American.




He said South Africa was “using G20 to promote ‘solidarity, equality, & sustainability.’ In other words: DEI and climate change. My job is to advance America’s national interests, not waste taxpayer money or coddle anti-Americanism.”


DEI is short for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, and in President Donald Trump’s first week in the White House, he signed an executive order to end DEI policies and hiring practices in the federal workforce.


“I think the whole topic of the G20 gathering is one that I don’t think we should be focused on, talking about global inclusion, equity, and these sorts of things,” Rubio later told the press.


He continued by saying the forum should be focused on issues “like terrorism and energy security and the real threats to the national security of multiple countries.”


The G20 is a group of the world’s 19 major individual economies as well as the EU and African Union. This year marks the first time an African country is in the rotating presidency position of the G20.


While Rubio will not attend, the South African government has confirmed the U.S. will still have a presence at the meeting, likely at a lower level.


South Africa’s Department of International Relations and Cooperation responded to Rubio in a statement saying: “Our G20 Presidency, is not confined to just climate change but also equitable treatment for nations of the Global South, ensuring an equal global system for all.”


Ronald Lamola, minister of international relations and cooperation, told local TV that the meeting’s agenda had been adopted by all members of the G20 and carries on the themes from previous summits, such as the one in Brazil last year.


Deteriorating relations


Even before the announcement that Rubio would not be taking part in the foreign ministers’ meeting, there had been a swift deterioration in U.S.-South Africa relations under the new administration in Washington.


President Trump accused South Africa’s government of engaging in land grabs and mistreating white minority Afrikaners. He cut U.S. financial assistance to the country.


While the South African government did pass a controversial land reform law earlier this year, no land has been seized. The white minority is still one of the country’s most privileged communities and owns the majority of private farmland.




Response from other G20 members


Several other nations were quick to affirm their attendance at the meeting after Rubio said he will not attend.


Those included EU members Germany, Italy and France, whose ambassadors to South Africa posted a joint video on X saying they were “united in diversity” and shared the South African government’s democratic values.




Russia also confirmed Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov will attend.


“The priorities stated by the South African presidency are designed to encourage economic growth, reduce inequality and imbalances, and ensure equitable access to financing for countries in the Global South.,” said Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova.


China likewise confirmed its commitment to the meeting, with ambassador to South Africa Wu Peng meeting foreign minister Lamola just after Rubio’s announcement and posting on X: “I also expressed China's readiness to support South Africa's G20 Presidency.”




Last week, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun, said in a press briefing,


“China stands ready to work with all parties to make this meeting a productive one, and send a strong message of supporting multilateralism, strengthening solidarity and cooperation, and jointly responding to global challenges,” he said.


Analysts weigh in


Political analysts said Rubio’s absence could provide space for countries hostile to the U.S. to advance their agendas.


“Will we see the increase of countries like Russia and China pushing their lines, their issues, their perspectives in the absence of the US? That’s entirely possible,” Steven Gruzd, from the South African Institute of International Affairs, told VOA.


Brooks Spector, a retired U.S. diplomat, said Rubio’s boycott of the meeting was “a serious misstep.”


“You get to make your points at a meeting, boycotting it simply means your voice is not heard,” he said. “Calling the meeting “anti-American” is a misunderstanding of the nature of bilateral, international and multi-lateral discussions.”


However, he said he expected Trump would likely still attend the major G20 summit in South Africa in November. In December, the U.S. will take on the presidency of the G20.

## Rubio: US looks for 'fair, sustainable' end to Russian war on Ukraine

date: 2025-02-18, from: VOA News USA

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Tuesday that the United States is working toward a "fair" and "sustainable" solution to end Russia’s three-year war on Ukraine, but that both Moscow and Kyiv would have to make concessions to achieve peace.


Rubio offered his assessment after he and other key U.S. officials met for more than four hours in Saudi Arabia with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and his aides in a first effort toward ending the war and improving the contentious Washington-Moscow relationship.


“The goal is to bring an end to this conflict in a way that's fair, enduring, sustainable and acceptable to all parties involved," Rubio told reporters, although no Ukrainian or European officials were at the table for the talks.


Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy objected to being excluded from the meeting, a position that drew criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump.


“Today I heard, ‘Well, we weren’t invited.’ Well, you’ve been there for three years,” Trump said of Ukraine’s leaders. “You should have never started it.”


While speaking to reporters at his Florida residence, Trump said he thought he had a “good chance” to end the war. But Zelenskyy has said his country will not agree to a U.S.-Russian dictated settlement of the war.


Zelenskyy postponed a trip to Saudi Arabia that had been scheduled for this week, suggesting that he wanted to avoid his visit being linked to the negotiations He is due to host the U.S. envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, for talks on Wednesday.


In Saudi Arabia, Rubio said he was convinced that Moscow was willing to engage in a "serious process" to end the war, which Russia started with a full-scale invasion of its neighbor three years ago next week. 


Lavrov had a similar upbeat view of the talks, saying, “We weren’t just listening to each other, but we heard each other. I have reason to believe that the American side started to better understand our positions.”


Watch related story by Anita Powell:




Tens of thousands of Russian and Ukrainian soldiers, along with Ukrainian civilians, have been killed in the fighting, Europe’s worst conflict since World War II.


The U.S. and Russia agreed to "appoint respective high-level teams to begin working on a path to ending the conflict in Ukraine as soon as possible," State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said in a statement. Bruce characterized the meeting as "an important step forward" toward peace.


Rubio said Ukraine and European nations would have to be involved in talks on ending the war. He said that if the war is halted, the U.S. would have "extraordinary opportunities … to partner" with Russia on trade and other global issues.


"The key to unlock that is the end to this conflict," he said.


National security adviser Mike Waltz and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff joined Rubio for the talks.


Waltz told reporters that negotiations to end the fighting will focus on territory and security guarantees for both Ukraine and Russia.


"This needs to be a permanent end to the war and not a temporary end, as we've seen in the past," Waltz said.




Russia now controls about a fifth of Ukraine’s internationally recognized 2014 territory. Moscow controls the Crimean Peninsula that it unilaterally annexed in 2014, along with a large portion of eastern Ukraine pro-Russian separatists captured in subsequent fighting and lands the Russian military have taken over since the 2022 invasion.


As the invasion started, Moscow hoped for a quick takeover of all of Ukraine. But with stiff Ukrainian resistance, the war instead evolved into a grinding ground conflict and daily aerial bombardments by each side.  


Zelenskyy has long demanded that his country’s 2014 boundaries be restored, but U.S. officials have said that is unrealistic, as was Kyiv’s long-sought goal of joining NATO, the West’s main military alliance, as part of a negotiated peace settlement. 


Bruce said the Rubio-Lavrov talks, the first extensive discussions between the two countries in more than three years, also laid the groundwork for more talks aside from the negotiations to end the war. 


She said the two sides would “establish a consultation mechanism to address irritants to our bilateral relationship with the objective of taking steps necessary to normalize the operation of our respective diplomatic missions.”


Bruce said the U.S. and Russia would “lay the groundwork for future cooperation on matters of mutual geopolitical interest and historic economic and investment opportunities” once the war is ended.


The U.S.-Russia engagement sparked concern among European leaders who in recent days have highlighted the need for Ukraine to be involved in discussions about its future, and for European nations to play a role in what they also see as a key development for their own security.


French President Emmanuel Macron convened a group of European leaders for a Monday session in Paris, where they discussed boosting defense spending and potential security guarantees for Ukraine.


There was division on the idea of deploying peacekeepers to Ukraine as part of a potential end to the war, with governments such as Britain and Sweden expressing openness to the idea while German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that discussion was premature.

## Leonard Peltier leaves prison after Biden commuted sentence in killing of FBI agents

date: 2025-02-18, from: VOA News USA

SUMTERVILLE, FLORIDA — Native American activist Leonard Peltier was released from a Florida prison on Tuesday, weeks after then-President Joe Biden angered law enforcement officials by commuting his life sentence in the 1975 killings of two FBI agents.  


For nearly half a century, Peltier's imprisonment has symbolized systemic injustice for Native Americans across the country who believe in his innocence. The decision to release the 80-year-old to home confinement was celebrated by supporters.  


"He represents every person who's been roughed up by a cop, profiled, had their children harassed at school," said Nick Estes, a professor of American Indian Studies at the University of Minnesota and a member of the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe who advocated for Peltier's release.  


But the move just before Biden left office also prompted criticism from those who say Peltier is guilty, including former FBI Director Christopher Wray, who called him "a remorseless killer" in a private letter to Biden obtained by The Associated Press. 


 "Granting Peltier any relief from his conviction or sentence is wholly unjustified and would be an affront to the rule of law," Wray wrote.  




The commutation was not a pardon for crimes committed, something Peltier's advocates have hoped for since he has always maintained his innocence.  


Peltier left the prison Tuesday morning in an SUV, according to a prison official. He didn't stop to speak with reporters or his supporters outside the gates. One of his attorneys, Jenipher Jones, said Peltier was looking forward to going home.  


"We're so excited for this moment," Jones said. "He is in good spirits. He has the soul of a warrior."  


After being released from USP Coleman, a high-security prison, Peltier planned to return to North Dakota, where he is expected to celebrate with friends and family on Wednesday. 


 Biden commuted Peltier's sentence Jan. 20, noting he had spent most of his life in prison and was now in poor health.  


"We never thought he would get out," Ray St. Clair, a member of the White Earth Band of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, said shortly before Peltier's release. "It shows you should never give up hope. We can take this repairing the damage that was done. This is a start." 


Peltier, an enrolled member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians in North Dakota, was active in the American Indian Movement, which beginning in the 1960s fought for Native American treaty rights and tribal self-determination.  


The group grabbed headlines in 1969 when activists occupied the former prison island of Alcatraz in the San Francisco Bay, and again in 1972, when they presented presidential candidates with a list of demands including the restoration of tribal land.  


After they were ignored, they seized the headquarters of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. From then on, the group was subject to FBI surveillance and harassment under a covert program that sought to disrupt activism and was exposed in 1975.  


Peltier's conviction stemmed from a confrontation that year on the Oglala Sioux Indian Reservation in Pine Ridge, South Dakota, in which FBI agents Jack Coler and Ronald Williams were killed.  


According to the FBI, the agents were there to serve arrest warrants for robbery and assault with a dangerous weapon. Prosecutors maintained at trial that Peltier shot both agents in the head at point-blank range.  


Peltier acknowledged being present and firing a gun at a distance, but he said he fired in self-defense. A woman who claimed to have seen Peltier shoot the agents later recanted her testimony, saying it had been coerced. He was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder and given two consecutive life sentences. Two other movement members, co-defendants Robert Robideau and Dino Butler, were acquitted on the grounds of self-defense. Peltier was denied parole as recently as July and was not eligible to be considered for it again until 2026.  


"Leonard Peltier's release is the right thing to do given the serious and ongoing human rights concerns about the fairness of his trial, his nearly 50 years behind bars, his health and his age," Paul O'Brien, executive director with Amnesty International USA, said in a statement before Peltier's release. "While we welcome his release from prison, he should not be restricted to home confinement."  


Prominent Native American groups like the National Congress of the American Indian have called for Peltier's release for decades, and Amnesty International considered him a political prisoner.  


Prominent supporters over the years included South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu, civil rights icon Coretta Scott King, actor and director Robert Redford, and musicians Pete Seeger, Harry Belafonte and Jackson Browne.  


Generations of Indigenous activists and leaders lobbied multiple presidents to pardon Peltier. Former Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, a member of the Pueblo of Laguna and the first Native American to hold the secretary's position, praised Biden's decision. "I am grateful that Leonard can now go home to his family," she said Jan. 20 in a post on X. "I applaud President Biden for this action and understanding what this means to Indian Country."  


As a young child, Peltier was taken from his family and sent to a boarding school. Thousands of Indigenous children over decades faced the same fate, and were in many cases subjected to systemic physical, psychological and sexual abuse.  


"He hasn't really had a home since he was taken away to boarding school," said Nick Tilsen, who has been advocating for Peltier's release since he was a teen and is CEO of NDN Collective, an Indigenous-led advocacy group based in South Dakota. "So he is excited to be at home and paint and have grandkids running around."

## Social Security head steps down over DOGE access of recipient information: AP sources

date: 2025-02-18, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The Social Security Administration's acting commissioner has stepped down from her role at the agency over Department of Government Efficiency requests to access Social Security recipient information, according to two people familiar with the official's departure who were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.


Acting Commissioner Michelle King's departure from the agency over the weekend — after more than 30 years of service — was initiated after King refused to provide DOGE staffers at the SSA with access to sensitive information, the people said Monday.


The White House has replaced her as acting commissioner with Leland Dudek, who currently works at the SSA, the people said.


White House spokesperson Harrison Fields released a statement Monday night saying: “President Trump has nominated the highly qualified and talented Frank Bisignano to lead the Social Security Administration, and we expect him to be swiftly confirmed in the coming weeks. In the meantime, the agency will be led by a career Social Security anti-fraud expert as the acting commissioner."


Fields added, "President Trump is committed to appointing the best and most qualified individuals who are dedicated to working on behalf of the American people, not to appease the bureaucracy that has failed them for far too long.”


King's exit from the administration is one of several departures of high-ranking officials concerned about DOGE staffers' potential unlawful access to private taxpayer information.


DOGE has accessed Treasury payment systems and is attempting to access Internal Revenue Service databases.


Since Republican President Donald Trump has retaken the White House, his billionaire adviser Elon Musk has rapidly burrowed deep into federal agencies while avoiding public scrutiny of his work through the DOGE group.


Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, an advocacy group for the preservation of Social Security benefits, said of DOGE's efforts that "there is no way to overstate how serious a breach this is. And my understanding is that it has already occurred.”


“The information collected and securely held by the Social Security Administration is highly sensitive," she said. "SSA has data on everyone who has a Social Security number, which is virtually all Americans, everyone who has Medicare, and every low-income American who has applied for Social Security’s means-tested companion program, Supplemental Security Income."


“If there is an evil intent to punish perceived enemies, someone could erase your earnings record, making it impossible to collect the Social Security and Medicare benefits you have earned.”


The future of Social Security has become a top political issue and was a major point of contention in the 2024 election. About 72.5 million people, including retirees, disabled people and children, receive Social Security benefits.

## Russian drone attack hits central Ukraine apartment building

date: 2025-02-18, from: VOA News USA

A Russian drone hit an apartment building in the central Ukrainian city of Dolynska, officials said Tuesday, injuring at least three people.


Andriy Raikovych, governor of the Kirovohrad region where the attack took place, said on Telegram that authorities evacuated dozens of people from the building and that those injured included a mother and two children.


The attack was part of a widespread Russian aerial assault overnight, which the Ukrainian military said included 176 drones.


Ukrainian air defenses shot down 103 of the drones, with intercepts taking place over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kirovohrad, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Poltava, Sumy, Vinnytsia and Zhytomyr regions, the military said Tuesday.


Cherkasy Governor Ihor Taburets said on Telegram that debris from a destroyed drone damaged four houses in his region.


Russia’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday it destroyed five Ukrainian drones, including four over the Voronezh region and one over Belgorod.


Both regions are located along the Russia-Ukraine border and are frequent targets of Ukrainian drone attacks.


Voronezh Governor Alexander Gusev said on Telegram there were no reports of casualties or damage.

## US, Russian officials meet to discuss Ukraine war, bilateral relations

date: 2025-02-18, from: VOA News USA

Top U.S. and Russian diplomats met for several hours Tuesday in Saudi Arabia about relations between their countries and a potential end to Russia’s war in Ukraine.


Both sides tempered expectations ahead of time, describing the talks as an initial step that could lay the framework for direct talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin.


Secretary of State Marco Rubio led the U.S. delegation, which included national security adviser Mike Waltz and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff.


Russia’s side included Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and senior Putin aide Yuri Ushakov.


Ukrainian leaders said they were not invited to participate. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is due to host the U.S. envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, for talks on Wednesday.


The U.S.-Russia engagement sparked concern among European leaders who in recent days have highlighted the need for Ukraine to be involved in discussions about its own future, and for European nations to play a role in what they also see as a key development in their own security.


French President Emmanuel Macron convened a group of European leaders for a Monday session in Paris where they discussed boosting defense spending and potential security guarantees for Ukraine.


There was division on the idea of deploying peacekeepers to Ukraine as part of a potential end to the war, with governments such as Britain and Sweden expressing openness to the idea while German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that discussion was premature.


“We seek a strong and lasting peace in Ukraine. To achieve this, Russia must end its aggression, and this must be accompanied by strong and credible security guarantees for the Ukrainians,” Macron said on X.


The French leader said he had spoken with Trump and Zelenskyy after the Paris talks, and that it is important for Europeans, Americans and Ukrainians to work together.


Zelenskyy expressed a need for “robust and reliable” security guarantees, saying that otherwise Russia will just start another war with Ukraine or other nations in Europe.

## Costa Rica will receive deported migrants from US

date: 2025-02-18, from: VOA News USA

San Jose, Costa Rica — Costa Rica announced Monday it would receive migrants from other countries who were deported by the United States, following in the footsteps of Panama and Guatemala.


"The Government of Costa Rica agreed to collaborate with the United States in the repatriation of 200 illegal immigrants to their country," the Costa Rican president's office said in a statement, adding that "these are people originating from ... Central Asia and India."


Costa Rica is the third country in Central America to collaborate on repatriating deported migrants from the United States since President Donald Trump assumed office in Washington on Jan. 20. 


The first set of deportees will arrive in Costa Rica on Wednesday aboard a commercial flight, according to the statement, whereupon they will be transported to a Temporary Migrant Care Center near the border with Panama. 


The statement specified that "the process will be completely financed" by the U.S. government under the supervision of the International Organization for Migration. 


Panama and Guatemala had previously agreed to a similar arrangement when U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited on a recent tour of Latin America. 


Panama received its first repatriation flight with 119 migrants aboard last week, originating from China, Pakistan, Afghanistan and elsewhere, according to Panamanian officials. None have arrived yet in Guatemala.


Latin America is the original home of most of the United States' estimated 11 million undocumented migrants.


Many had made dangerous journeys, braving treacherous terrain, wild animals and criminal gangs for a chance at a better life.


Trump, however, took a hard line against undocumented migrants during last year's U.S. election campaign, describing some as "monsters" and "animals."

## Four top New York City officials resign as turmoil ripples over mayor's corruption case

date: 2025-02-18, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — Four top deputies to New York City Mayor Eric Adams are resigning in the latest fallout from the Justice Department's push to end a corruption case against Adams and ensure his cooperation in President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown — a bargain that has raised questions about the mayor’s political independence and ability to lead the city.


In a statement Monday, Adams confirmed the departures of First Deputy Mayor Maria Torres-Springer, Deputy Mayor for Operations Meera Joshi, Deputy Mayor for Health and Human Services Anne Williams-Isom and Deputy Mayor for Public Safety Chauncey Parker.


“I am disappointed to see them go, but given the current challenges, I understand their decision and wish them nothing but success in the future," said Adams, who faces several challengers in June's Democratic primary. “But let me be crystal clear: New York City will keep moving forward, just as it does every day."


City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams became the latest Democrat to call on the mayor to resign, saying that with the deputy mayor resignations it's clear he "has now lost the confidence and trust of his own staff, his colleagues in government and New Yorkers.”


Speaker Adams is not related to the mayor.


Torres-Springer, Joshi and Williams-Isom told agency heads and staff in a memo that they were exiting because of “the extraordinary events of the last few weeks.”


They did not give a date for their departures, but Adams said they and Parker will remain “for the time being to ensure a seamless transition.”


Adams has faced increasing scrutiny since the Justice Department's second-in-command ordered federal prosecutors in Manhattan last week to drop the mayor's corruption case. Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove wrote that the case had “unduly restricted Mayor Adams’ ability to devote full attention and resources to the illegal immigration and violent crime.”


That directive touched off firestorms within the Justice Department and New York political circles, with seven federal prosecutors quitting in protest — including the interim U.S. attorney for Manhattan — and fellow Democrats calling on Adams to resign.


On Friday, after a week of recriminations and resignations, Bove and a pair of Justice Department officials from Washington stepped in and filed paperwork asking Manhattan federal Judge Dale E. Ho to dismiss the case. Ho has yet to take action on the request.


Adams, a former police captain, pleaded not guilty last September to charges that he accepted more than $100,000 in illegal campaign contributions and lavish travel perks from foreign nationals looking to buy his influence while he was Brooklyn borough president campaigning to be mayor.


The Justice Department said in its filing Friday that it was seeking to dismiss Adams’ charges with the option of refiling them later, which critics see as a carrot to ensure his compliance on the Republican president's objectives. In his memo ordering prosecutors to ditch the case, Bove said the new, permanent U.S. attorney would review the matter after the November election.


“It certainly sounds like President Trump is holding the mayor hostage,” Reverend Al Sharpton, an Adams ally, said Tuesday. “I have supported the mayor, but he has been put in an unfair position — even for him — of essentially political blackmail.”

Political leaders, including Democratic Representatives Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and Nydia Velázquez, and Lieutenant Governor Antonio Delgado have called on Adams to step down. But Democratic Governor Kathy Hochul has said she's taking a more deliberative approach.


“The allegations are extremely concerning and serious, but I cannot as the governor of this state have a knee-jerk, politically motivated reaction like a lot of other people are saying right now,” she told MSNBC on Thursday. “I’ve got to do it smart, what’s right, and I’m consulting with other leaders in government right now.”


The drama over Adams' legal case played out as the mayor met with Trump’s border czar in New York on Thursday and announced increased cooperation on the Trump administration's efforts to remove immigrants, including reestablishing an office for immigration authorities at the city's notorious Rikers Island jail.


In their memo to staff announcing their exits, Torres-Springer, Joshi and Williams-Isom wrote, “Due to the extraordinary events of the last few weeks and to stay faithful to the oaths we swore to New Yorkers and our families, we have come to the difficult decision to step down from our roles.”

## Trump begins firings of FAA air traffic control staff just weeks after fatal DC plane crash

date: 2025-02-17, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The Trump administration began firing several hundred Federal Aviation Administration employees on a busy air travel weekend and just weeks after a January fatal midair collision at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.


Probationary workers were targeted in late-night emails Friday notifying them they had been fired, David Spero, president of the Professional Aviation Safety Specialists union, said in a statement.


The workers include personnel hired for FAA radar, landing and navigational aid maintenance, one air traffic controller told The Associated Press. The air traffic controller was not authorized to talk to the media and spoke on condition of anonymity.


A Transportation Department official told the AP late Monday that no air traffic controllers were affected by the cuts and that the agency has "retained employees who perform critical safety functions." In a follow-up query, the agency said they would have to look into whether the radar, landing and navigational aid workers who were fired were considered to handle critical safety functions.


The National Air Traffic Controllers Association said in a brief statement Monday it was "analyzing the effect of the reported federal employee terminations on aviation safety, the national airspace system and our members."


Other FAA employees who were fired were working on an urgent and classified early warning radar system the Air Force had announced in 2023 for Hawaii to detect incoming cruise missiles, through a program that was in part funded by the Defense Department. It's one of several programs that the FAA's National Defense Program manages that involve radars providing longer-range detection around the country's borders.


Due to the nature of their work, staff in that office typically provide an extensive knowledge transfer before retiring to make sure no institutional knowledge is lost, said Charles Spitzer-Stadtlander, one of the employees in that branch who was terminated.


The Hawaii radar and the FAA National Defense Program office working on it are "about protecting national security," Spitzer-Stadtlander said. "I don't think they even knew what NDP does, they just thought, oh no big deal, he just works for the FAA."


"This is about protecting national security, and I'm scared to death," Spitzer-Stadtlander said. "And the American public should be scared too."


Spero said messages began arriving after 7 p.m. Friday and continued late into the night. More might be notified over the long weekend or barred from entering FAA buildings Tuesday, he said.


The employees were fired "without cause nor based on performance or conduct," Spero said, and the emails were "from an 'exec order' Microsoft email address" — not a government email address. A copy of the termination email that was provided to the AP shows the sending address "ASK_AHR_EXEC_Orders@usfaa.mail.outlook.com."


The firings hit the FAA as it is facing a shortfall in controllers. Federal officials have been raising concerns about an overtaxed and understaffed air traffic control system for years, especially after a series of close calls between planes at U.S. airports. Among the reasons they have cited for staffing shortages are uncompetitive pay, long shifts, intensive training and mandatory retirements.


In the January 29 fatal collision between a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter and American Airlines passenger jet, which is still under investigation, one controller was handing both commercial airline and helicopter traffic at the busy airport.


Days before the collision, President Donald Trump fired all the members of the Aviation Security Advisory Committee, a panel mandated by Congress after the 1988 PanAm 103 bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland. The committee is charged with examining safety issues at airlines and airports.


Spitzer-Stadtlander suggested he was targeted for firing for his views on Tesla and X, formerly Twitter, not as part of a general probationary-level sweep. Both companies are owned by Elon Musk, whose Department of Government Efficiency is leading Trump's effort to cut the federal government.


DOGE did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The firings were first reported by CNN.

## American arrested in Moscow on drug smuggling charges freed

date: 2025-02-17, from: VOA News USA

Russia has freed a U.S. citizen arrested earlier this month on drug smuggling charges, according to Russian media reports and a U.S. official. 


The move appears to be an effort to ease tensions between Moscow and Washington ahead of talks in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. 


Kalob Byers, 28, was detained on Feb. 7 at Moscow's Vnukovo airport after customs officials allegedly found cannabis-laced marmalade in his baggage. According to media reports, Byers had traveled from Istanbul with his Russian fiancee, who was also detained. The authorities said he had attempted to smuggle a “significant amount” of drugs into the country and put him in custody on the charges of drug smuggling, punishable by a prison term of up to 10 years. 


Byers has been released from custody and is in the U.S. Embassy in Moscow where he is awaiting a flight home, Russian independent news outlet Meduza reported Monday, citing a Facebook post by his parents. A U.S. official confirmed to The Associated Press that Byers was released to the embassy late Sunday evening. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss sensitive matters. 


Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters Monday in response to a question about Byers that Moscow expects “to discuss restoring the entire complex of Russian-American relations” at the talks in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, “so certain events can be viewed in this context.” 


It wasn't immediately clear whether Byers' fiancee was also released. Russian media reports identified her as Naida Mambetova and said she was placed in pre-trial detention on the same charges. 


Arrests of American nationals in Russia have become increasingly common in recent years, with relations between Moscow and Washington sinking to Cold War lows over the war in Ukraine. Some have been released in prisoner exchanges. The most recent one included Marc Fogel, a teacher from Pennsylvania imprisoned in Russia on charges similar to those Byers had faced. 


Fogel was detained in 2021 when traveling to Russia to work at a school and handed a 14-year sentence for having what his family and supporters said was medically prescribed marijuana. He was released and brought back to the U.S. earlier this month in a swap that saw Alexander Vinnik, a Russian cryptocurrency expert who faced Bitcoin fraud charges in the U.S., returned to Russia. 


The release of Fogel and Byers come as tensions between Russia and the U.S. appear to ease. 


President Donald Trump on Wednesday upended three years of U.S. policy toward Ukraine and Russia, saying he and Russia's President Vladimir Putin had agreed to begin negotiations on ending the conflict following a lengthy direct phone call.

## Global benchmarks trade mixed as investors continue to eye Trump

date: 2025-02-17, from: VOA News USA

Tokyo — Global shares traded mixed on Monday as investors continued to watch economic data and policy moves from U.S. President Donald Trump, as both are likely to impact upcoming central bank moves.


France's CAC 40 dipped nearly 0.1% in early trading to 8,171.59, while Germany's DAX added 0.4% to 22,560.00. Britain's FTSE 100 edged up 0.1% to 8,742.97.


U.S. markets are closed on Monday for a holiday.


In Asia, Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 rose in early trading after the Cabinet Office reported that the economy grew at a better-than-expected annual rate of 2.8% in October-December, underlined by steady exports and moderate consumption. But the benchmark quickly fell back and then recovered to be little changed, finishing up less than 0.1% at 39,174.25.


On a quarter-to-quarter basis, the world’s fourth-largest economy grew 0.7% for its third straight quarter of growth. Japan marked its fourth straight year of expansion, eking out 0.1% growth last year in seasonally adjusted real gross domestic product, which measures the value of a nation’s products and services.


In other regional markets, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 slipped 0.2% to 8,537.10. South Korea's Kospi surged 0.8% to 2,610.42. Hong Kong's Hang Seng reversed course, to slip less than 0.1% to 22,616.23, while the Shanghai Composite added 0.3% to 3,355.83.


Markets around the world are nervously watching what upward pressure may come from tariffs that Trump has announced recently. But analysts now think Trump may ultimately avoid triggering a punishing global trade war.


His most recent tariff announcement, for example, won’t take full effect for at least several weeks. That leaves time for Washington and other countries to negotiate.


The Federal Reserve's goal, as well as that of the Bank of Japan, is to keep inflation at 2%.


In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude added 28 cents to $71.02 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, rose 34 cents to $75.08 a barrel.


In currency trading, the U.S. dollar declined to 151.90 Japanese yen from 152.25 yen. The euro cost $1.0472, down from $1.0495.

## 'Life-threatening cold' hits parts of US following deadly weekend flooding

date: 2025-02-17, from: VOA News USA

BISMARCK, N.D. — Harsh cold descended on the nation's midsection Monday as a polar vortex gripped the Rockies and Northern Plains on the heels of weekend storms that pummeled the Eastern U.S. with floods, killing at least 14 people.


The National Weather Service warned of “life-threatening cold” as wind chills dropped to minus 51 Celsius in parts of North Dakota on Monday and minus 46 C in parts of Montana. Tuesday morning was forecast to be even colder.


Extreme cold warnings were issued for an 11-state swath of the U.S. stretching from the Canadian border to Oklahoma and central Texas, where the Arctic front was expected to bring near-record cold temperatures and wind chills in the single digits by midweek.


Meteorologists had predicted that parts of the U.S. would experience the 10th and coldest polar vortex event this season. Weather forces in the Arctic are pushing chilly air that usually stays near the North Pole into the U.S. and Europe.


Kentucky, Appalachia battered by flooding with at least 13 dead

The death toll in flood-battered Kentucky rose to 12, Gov. Andy Beshear said Monday night. Two fatal vehicle crashes were connected to the severe weather, he said, and at least 1,000 people stranded by floods had to be rescued.


Parts of Kentucky and Tennessee received up to 15 centimeters of rain as severe storms swept across the South. Water submerged cars and buildings in Kentucky and mudslides blocked roads in Virginia.


In West Virginia, where there was one confirmed fatality with several people still missing, Gov. Patrick Morrisey asked President Donald Trump to issue a disaster declaration for a 13-county region ravaged by flooding.


Near Logan, West Virginia, authorities responded Monday night to the spill of acidic water from an abandoned coal mine. The mine blowout damaged a road, making it impassable, fire officials said.


In Atlanta, a person was killed when a large tree fell on a home early Sunday.


Flood warnings were extended Monday across most of Kentucky and portions of Arkansas, Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, West Virginia, Virginia and Ohio.


Extreme cold gives the U.S. a taste of the Arctic

This is the coldest month of the year for many locations, and air temperatures may approach record lows in some areas, said National Weather Service meteorologist Jason Anglin in Bismarck.


People should cover exposed skin and limit time outside to avoid frostbite, which can happen in minutes in such low temperatures, Anglin said. Neighbors should check on each other and those who are vulnerable and monitor heater vents to make sure they don't ice up.


Due to the frigid conditions and a “lack of adequate heating fuel,” North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong on Monday waived hours-of-service requirements for commercial-vehicle drivers hauling propane and petroleum products. The waiver is for 30 days.


The cold snap in North Dakota was expected to reduce oil production by about 5%, or about 50,000 to 80,000 barrels a day — pretty typical for such conditions, North Dakota Pipeline Authority Director Justin Kringstad said. It takes about a week once temperatures warm up for volumes to rebound, he said.


Death can happen in minutes for animals in such cold, said Julie Schirado, a founder of the Bismarck-based Furry Friends Rockin' Rescue animal shelter. The shelter works with other rescues, and uses floor kennels, heated garages and basements to house animals, she said.


“We see death a lot but when the cold temperatures hit, then it's jumped up some more. We lose kittens, puppies that are out in this weather ... Frostbite can be wicked,” Schirado said. People should bring their pets indoors in extreme cold.


At the Dakota Zoo in Bismarck, which closed last weekend due to cold, critters such as bison, elk and bighorn sheep don't mind the temperatures as they munch food to stay warm and have shelters to enter, Director Terry Lincoln said. And staff are still out, breaking through ice for their water, he said.

## Rubio in Saudi Arabia for talks on fate of Gaza

date: 2025-02-17, from: VOA News USA

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio was in Saudi Arabia on Monday to discuss the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and the fate of the Gaza Strip if the war is ended.


The new top U.S. diplomat met with both Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan.


Their talks came after U.S. President Donald Trump’s call to move 2.3 million Palestinians out of Gaza into neighboring countries, with the United States then redeveloping the narrow territory along the Mediterranean Sea and taking ownership of it, a plan Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations oppose.




Rubio and the crown prince “underscored the importance of an arrangement for Gaza that contributes to regional security,” State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said after the two officials met. She did not mention any discussion of the Trump proposal.


Bruce said the two officials “reaffirmed their commitment to implementing the ceasefire in Gaza and ensuring that Hamas releases all hostages, including American citizens.”




Arab nations, including Saudi Arabia, oppose Trump’s plan and continue to support the creation of an independent Palestinian state, including Gaza, to exist alongside Israel. For years, that also has been the U.S. stance but now seemingly is at odds with any call for U.S. ownership of the territory and removal of the Palestinians with no right for them to return once it is redeveloped.


As such, Rubio has said Arab countries opposed to Trump’s Gaza proposal should offer their own alternative suggestions on how to rebuild the territory that has been decimated by 15 months of fighting between Israel and Hamas militants. The warring sides are now in a six-week truce that is tenuously holding but set to end in two weeks.


Terms for the second phase of the ceasefire have yet to be reached.




Meanwhile, the Israeli military said Monday its forces will remain in five strategic locations in southern Lebanon near the border after Tuesday’s deadline for their withdrawal under a ceasefire with the Hezbollah militant group. The move came as the region marked 500 days of unrest linked to the war in the Gaza Strip.


Lebanon’s government and Hezbollah are opposed to any further delay in the Israeli troop withdrawal, which had already been postponed for three weeks.


Earlier Monday, an Israeli drone attack struck a car in Lebanon’s southern port city of Sidon, the deepest attack inside Lebanese territory since the ceasefire took effect. Israel said it targeted Muhammad Shaheen, the head of Hamas’ operations in Lebanon. Footage circulating online showed a car engulfed in flames.


Trump’s Gaza takeover plan would seemingly eliminate his hopes of getting Saudi Arabia to normalize ties with Israel, which Saudi officials have said will not happen unless there is a pathway for a Palestinian state.


The United States fully endorsed Israel’s war aims in Gaza on Sunday, with Rubio saying that Hamas “must be eradicated” and "cannot continue as a military or government force."


Rubio told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a stop in Jerusalem that “as long as [Hamas] stands as a force that can govern or as a force that can administer or as a force that can threaten by use of violence, peace becomes impossible.”


Echoing Trump, the Israeli leader said "the gates of hell would be open" if Hamas does not release dozens of remaining hostages abducted in its Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war.




Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist group, freed three hostages on Saturday in exchange for nearly 400 Palestinians who had been jailed in Israel. But the militants continue to hold dozens of hostages they captured in the terror attack that killed 1,200 people.


Israel’s counteroffensive during the war with Hamas has killed more than 48,200 Palestinians, according to the territory's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. Israel, without offering evidence, said it has killed over 17,000 militants.


The tentative second phase of the ceasefire plan calls for Hamas to release dozens of remaining hostages in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners, the drafting of a permanent truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces. But the detailed terms of the deal have yet to be negotiated.


During his tour of the region, Rubio was not scheduled to meet with any Palestinian officials.


Egypt says it is hosting an Arab summit on Feb. 27 and is working with other countries on a counterproposal that would allow for Gaza to be rebuilt without removing its population. Human rights groups say the expulsion of Palestinians would likely violate international law.


Egypt has warned that any mass influx of Palestinians from Gaza would undermine its nearly half-century-old peace treaty with Israel, a cornerstone of American influence in the region.

## China urges US to 'correct its mistakes' after State Department removes Taiwan web reference

date: 2025-02-17, from: VOA News USA

BEIJING/TAIPEI  — China on Monday urged the United States to "correct its mistakes" after the U.S. State Department removed previous wording on its website about not supporting Taiwan independence, which it said was part of a routine update.


The fact sheet on Taiwan, updated last week, retains Washington's opposition to unilateral change from either Taiwan or from China, which claims the democratically governed island as its own.


But as well as dropping the phrase "we do not support Taiwan independence," the page added a reference to Taiwan's cooperation with a Pentagon technology and semiconductor development project and says the U.S. will support Taiwan's membership in international organizations "where applicable."


Beijing regularly denounces any international recognition of Taiwan or contact between Taiwanese and foreign officials, viewing it as encouraging Taiwan's separate status from China.


The update to the website came roughly three weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump was sworn in to his second term in the White House.


Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said the revisions for Taiwan on the U.S. State Department's website were a big step backwards and "sends a seriously wrong message to Taiwan independence separatist forces."


"This is yet another example of the United States' stubborn adherence to the erroneous policy of 'using Taiwan to suppress China'. We urge the United States side to immediately rectify its mistakes," Guo said.


The United States, like most countries, has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan but is its strongest international backer, bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself.


"As is routine, the fact sheet was updated to inform the general public about our unofficial relationship with Taiwan," a State Department spokesperson said in an email sent late Sunday Taiwan time responding to questions on the updated website wording.


"The United States remains committed to its one China policy," the spokesperson said, referring to Washington officially taking no position on Taiwan's sovereignty and only acknowledging China's position on the subject.


"The United States is committed to preserving peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait," the spokesperson said.


"We oppose any unilateral changes to the status quo from either side. We support cross-Strait dialog, and we expect cross-Strait differences to be resolved by peaceful means, free from coercion, in a manner acceptable to people on both sides of the Strait."


On Sunday, Taiwan Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung expressed his appreciation for what he called the "support and positive stance on U.S.-Taiwan relations."


Taiwan's government rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims, saying that only the island's people can decide their future.


Taiwan says it is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its official name. The Republican government fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war with Mao Zedong's communists, who set up the People's Republic of China.

## Paul Simon, Sabrina Carpenter open 'Saturday Night Live' 50th anniversary celebration

date: 2025-02-17, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — Paul Simon and Sabrina Carpenter opened the 50th anniversary special celebrating "Saturday Night Live" with a duet of his song "Homeward Bound."


The 83-year-old Simon has been a constant on "SNL" since its earliest episodes in 1975 and performed on the first show after the 9/11 attack. He was joined by the 25-year-old pop sensation of the moment, Carpenter.


"I sang this song with George Harrison on 'Saturday Night Live' in 1976," Simon said.


"I was not born then," Carpenter said, getting a laugh. "And neither were my parents," she added, getting a bigger laugh.




Fifty seasons of "Saturday Night Live" sketches, songs and special guests are being celebrated for the special's landmark anniversary in a Sunday night special.


The pop culture juggernaut has launched the careers of generations of comedians, from Bill Murray to Eddie Murphy and Tina Fey to Kristen Wiig.


Many of those stars were on hand for "SNL50: The Anniversary Celebration," airing live from New York, of course.


"I grew up with the show, you know, and I was born in 1971, and it's lived with me my whole life," Amy Poehler, who was a cast member from 2001 to 2008," said on Sunday ahead of the show's start. "We have a show to do in just under two hours, and being back is an amazing privilege."


The three-hour extravaganza comes after months of celebrations of "Saturday Night Live," which premiered Oct. 11, 1975, with an original cast that included John Belushi, Chevy Chase and Gilda Radner.


"After the original cast, we were just going, Those guys just did it all for us," Adam Sandler, a cast member from 1990-1995, said before the show. "They crushed it. We watched them at home. They made their movies. We worshiped their movies. And that's all. What we wanted to do is just kind of continue that sort of stuff."


It's become appointment television over the years as the show has skewered presidents, politics and pop culture and been a platform for the biggest musical stars of the moment. As streaming has altered television viewing, "SNL" sketches, host monologues and short comedy films remain popular on social media and routinely rack up millions of views on YouTube.


While NBC has revealed some of the stars expected to appear, many of the special's moments, cameos and music performances remain a surprise.


On Sunday, NBC announced more guest appearances including Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Leslie Jones, Billy Crystal, Cher, Mike Myers and Alec Baldwin, who holds the title of the person who's hosted "SNL" the most times.

## Trump administration turns to US Supreme Court in bid to fire agency head

date: 2025-02-17, from: VOA News USA

President Donald Trump's administration has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene in its bid to fire the head of an independent U.S. agency that protects government whistleblowers, bringing its first legal battle involving Trump's actions to the nation's highest judicial body since he took office in January.


The Justice Department asked the court to immediately lift a federal judge's Feb. 12 order that temporarily blocked Trump's removal of Hampton Dellinger as the head of the Office of Special Counsel while litigation continues in the dispute, according to a copy of the filing reviewed by Reuters. The case has not yet been docketed by the court.


The federal judge's action blocking the termination is an "unprecedented assault on the separation of powers," Acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris said in the filing.


"This court should not allow lower courts to seize executive power by dictating to the President how long he must continue employing an agency head against his will," Harris wrote.


Appointed by former President Joe Biden, Dellinger's five-year term was set to expire in 2029. He sued after receiving an email on Feb. 7 informing him that Trump had fired him from the watchdog role, "effective immediately."


Dellinger's lawsuit said Trump exceeded his power in purporting to fire him, given that federal law permits removal only for "inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office."


The Special Counsel's "ability to protect the civil service and investigate alleged misconduct is needed now more than ever," Dellinger's lawsuit said. "Over the preceding three weeks, an unprecedented number of federal employees with civil service protections have been terminated without cause."


U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson in Washington, D.C. issued a temporary restraining order on Feb. 12, restoring Dellinger to his position pending a further, preliminary order.


Jackson said Dellinger was likely to prevail in the suit given that the effort to fire him without identifying any cause "plainly contravenes" the Special Counsel's job protections under federal law.


"This language expresses Congress's clear intent to ensure the independence of the Special Counsel and insulate his work from being buffeted by the winds of political change," Jackson wrote in the order.


The District of Columbia U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out the administration's appeal in a 2-1 decision on Saturday, saying it was premature, given that Jackson's order was only temporary.


The Special Counsel Office allows whistleblowers to make disclosures about alleged misconduct within federal agencies and investigates complaints of retaliation. It also enforces a U.S. law known as the Hatch Act that limits political participation by federal employees.


The move to fire Dellinger was the latest by the Trump administration to expel officials who investigate wrongdoing within the federal government. Trump last month fired 17 inspectors general who serve as independent watchdogs within their agencies, without providing a reason.

## Scientists race to discover depth of ocean damage from Los Angeles wildfires

date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA

Los Angeles — On a recent Sunday, Tracy Quinn drove down the Pacific Coast Highway to assess damage wrought upon the coastline by the Palisades Fire.


The water line was darkened by ash. Burnt remnants of washing machines and dryers and metal appliances were strewn about the shoreline. Sludge carpeted the water's edge. Waves during high tide lapped onto charred homes, pulling debris and potentially toxic ash into the ocean as they receded.


“It was just heartbreaking,” said Quinn, president and CEO of the environmental group Heal the Bay, whose team has reported ash and debris some 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of the Palisades burn area west of Los Angeles.


As crews work to remove potentially hundreds of thousands of tons of hazardous materials from the Los Angeles wildfires, researchers and officials are trying to understand how the fires on land have impacted the sea. The Palisades and Eaton fires scorched thousands of homes, businesses, cars and electronics, turning everyday items into hazardous ash made of pesticides, asbestos, plastics, lead, heavy metals and more.


Since much of it could end up in the Pacific Ocean, there are concerns and many unknowns about how the fires could affect life under the sea.


“We haven't seen a concentration of homes and buildings burned so close to the water," Quinn said.


Fire debris and potentially toxic ash could make the water unsafe for surfers and swimmers, especially after rainfall that can transport chemicals, trash and other hazards into the sea. Longer term, scientists worry if and how charred urban contaminants will affect the food supply.


The atmospheric river and mudslides that pummeled the Los Angeles region last week exacerbated some of those fears.


When the fires broke out in January, one of Mara Dias' first concerns was ocean water contamination. Strong winds were carrying smoke and ash far beyond the blazes before settling at sea, said the water quality manager for the Surfrider Foundation, an environmental nonprofit.


Scientists on board a research vessel during the fires detected ash and waste on the water as far as 100 miles (161 kilometers) offshore, said marine ecologist Julie Dinasquet with the University of California, San Diego’s Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Things like twigs and shard. They described the smell as electronics burning, she recalled, “not like a nice campfire.”


Runoff from rain also is a huge and immediate concern. Rainfall picks up contaminants and trash while flushing toward the sea through a network of drains and rivers. That runoff could contain “a lot of nutrients, nitrogen and phosphate that end up in the ash of the burn material that can get into the water,” said Dias, as well as "heavy metals, something called PAHs, which are given off when you burn different types of fuel.”


Mudslides and debris flows in the Palisades Fire burn zone also can dump more hazardous waste into the ocean. After fires, the soil in burn scars is less able to absorb rainfall and can develop a layer that repels water from the remains of seared organic material. When there is less organic material to hold the soil in place, the risks of mudslides and debris flows increase.


Los Angeles County officials, with help from other agencies, have set thousands of feet of concrete barriers, sandbags, silt socks and more to prevent debris from reaching beaches. The LA County Board of Supervisors also recently passed a motion seeking state and federal help to expand beach clean ups, prepare for storm runoff and test ocean water for potential toxins and chemicals, among other things.


Beyond the usual samples, state water officials and others are testing for total and dissolved metals such as arsenic, lead and aluminum and volatile organic compounds.


They also are sampling for microplastics, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or PAHs, that are harmful to human and aquatic life, and polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, a group of man-made chemicals shown to cause cancer in animals and other serious health effects. Now banned from being manufactured, they were used in products like pigments, paints and electrical equipment.


County public health officials said chemical tests of water samples last month did not raise health concerns, so they downgraded one beach closure to an ocean water advisory. Beachgoers were still advised to stay out of the water.


Dinasquet and colleagues are working to understand how far potentially toxic ash and debris dispersed across the ocean, how deep and how fast they sunk and, over time, where it ends up.


Forest fires can deposit important nutrients like iron and nitrogen into the ocean ecosystem, boosting the growth of phytoplankton, which can create a positive, cascading effect across the ecosystem. But the potentially toxic ash from urban coastal fires could have dire consequences, Dinasquet said.


“Reports are already showing that there was a lot of lead and asbestos in the ash,” she added. "This is really bad for people so it's probably also very bad for the marine organisms."

## US Presidents Day: How it evolved from reverence to retail

date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA

Norfolk, Virginia — Like the other Founding Fathers, George Washington was uneasy about the idea of publicly celebrating his life. He was the first leader of a new republic, not a king.


And yet the United States will once again commemorate its first president Monday, 293 years after he was born.


The meaning of Presidents Day has changed dramatically, from being mostly unremarkable and filled with work for Washington in the 1700s to the bonanza of consumerism it has become today. For some historians, the holiday has lost all discernible meaning.


Historian Alexis Coe, author of “You Never Forget Your First: A Biography of George Washington,” has said she thinks about Presidents Day in much the same way as the towering monument in D.C. bearing his name.


“It’s supposed to be about Washington, but can you really point to anything that looks or sounds like him?” she remarked in an interview with The Associated Press in 2024. “Jefferson and Lincoln are presented as people with limbs and noses and words associated with their memorials. And he’s just a giant, granite point. He has been sanded down to have absolutely no identifiable features.”


Here is a look at how things have evolved:


Washington's birthdays were celebrated, sometimes


Washington was born Feb. 22, 1732, on Popes Creek Plantation near the Potomac River in Virginia.


Technically, though, he was born Feb. 11 under the ancient Julian calendar, which was still in use for the first 20 years of his life. The Gregorian calendar, intended to more accurately mark the solar year, was adopted in 1752, adding 11 days.


Either way, Washington paid little attention to his birthday, according to Mountvernon.org, the website of the organization that manages his estate. Surviving records make no mention of observances at Mount Vernon, while his diary shows he was often hard at work.


“If he had it his way, he would be at home with his family,” Coe said. “Maybe some beloved nieces and nephews (and friend) Marquis de Lafayette would be ideal. And Martha’s recipe for an indulgent cake. But that’s about it.”


Washington’s birthday was celebrated by his peers in government when he was president, mostly.


Congress voted during his first two terms to take a short commemorative break each year, with one exception, his last birthday in office, Coe said. By then, Washington was less popular, partisanship was rampant, and many members of his original Cabinet were gone, including Thomas Jefferson.


“One way to show their disdain for his Federalist policies was to keep working through his birthday,” Coe said.


The Library of Congress does note a French military officer, the Comte de Rochambeau, threw a ball celebrating Washington’s 50th birthday in 1782.


After his death, a market for memorabilia is born


Washington was very aware of his inaugural role as president and its distinction from the British crown. He didn’t want to be honored like a king, Seth Bruggeman, a history professor at Temple University in Philadelphia, told the AP last year.


Still, he said, a market for Washington memorabilia sprang up almost immediately after his death in 1799 at age 67, with people snapping up pottery and reproductions of etchings portraying him as a divine figure going off into heaven.


“Even in that early moment, Americans kind of conflated consumerism with patriotic memory,” said Bruggeman, whose books include “Here, George Washington Was Born: Memory, Material Culture, and the Public History of a National Monument.”


Making it official with parades and festivals


It wasn’t until 1832, the centennial of his birth, that Congress established a committee to arrange national “parades, orations and festivals,” according to the Congressional Research Service.


Only in 1879 was his birthday formally made into a legal holiday for federal employees in the District of Columbia.


The official designation for the holiday is Washington’s Birthday, although it has come to be known informally as Presidents Day. Arguments have been made to honor President Lincoln as well because his birth date falls nearby, on Feb. 12.


A small number of states, including Illinois, observe Lincoln’s birthday as a public holiday, according to the Library of Congress. And some commemorate both Lincoln and Washington on Presidents Day.


But on the federal level, the day is still officially Washington’s Birthday.


A shift to consumerism


By the late 1960s, Washington’s Birthday was one of nine federal holidays that fell on specific dates on different days of the week, according to a 2004 article in the National Archives’ Prologue magazine.




Congress voted to move some of those to Mondays, following concerns that were in part about absenteeism among government workers when a holiday fell midweek. But lawmakers also noted clear benefits to the economy, including boosts in retail sales and travel on three-day weekends.


The Uniform Monday Holiday Act took effect in 1971, moving Presidents Day to the third Monday in February. Sales campaigns soared, historian C. L. Arbelbide wrote in Prologue.


Bruggeman said Washington and the other Founding Fathers “would have been deeply worried” by how the holiday became taken over by commercial and private interests.


“They were very nervous about corporations,” Bruggeman said. “It wasn’t that they forbade them. But they saw corporations as like little republics that potentially threatened the power of The Republic.”


Coe, who is also a fellow at the Washington think tank New America, said by now the day is devoid of recognizable traditions.


“There’s no moment of reflection,” Coe said. Given today’s widespread cynicism toward the office, she added, that sort of reflection “would probably be a good idea.”

## Rubio plays down immediate breakthrough on Russia-Ukraine peace

date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA

Top U.S. officials headed Sunday to Saudi Arabia for talks with Russian diplomats in the coming days on ending Moscow’s three-year war on Ukraine, but Secretary of State Marco Rubio downplayed prospects for an immediate breakthrough.


U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin agreed during an hour-long call last week to the immediate start of peace negotiations, but Rubio told CBS’s “Face the Nation” in an interview aired Sunday, “A process towards peace is not a one- meeting thing.”


"We'll see in the coming days and weeks if Vladimir Putin is interested in negotiating an end to the war in Ukraine in a way that is sustainable and fair,” Rubio said.


Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, and U.S. national security adviser Mike Waltz said they were headed to Riyadh for the talks, while a Ukrainian minister says that an official delegation has arrived there in preparation for a possible visit by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.


The shape of the talks remained uncertain.


Rubio said he wasn't even sure who Moscow was sending. "Nothing's been finalized yet," he said, adding that the hope was for an opening for a broad conversation that "would include Ukraine and would involve the end of the war."


Trump’s call with Putin blindsided NATO allies as well as Kyiv, with Zelenskyy later saying that there should be "no decisions about Ukraine without Ukraine."


Whatever occurs this week in Saudi Arabia, Rubio said that once "real negotiations" begin, then Ukraine "will have to be involved.”


Hours before European leaders meet in Paris to address Washington's policy shift on the war in Ukraine, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer wrote in the Daily Telegraph on Sunday that he was ready to send British troops to Ukraine as part of any postwar peacekeeping force.


"I do not say that lightly," he wrote. "I feel very deeply the responsibility that comes with potentially putting British servicemen and women in harm's way."


Starmer said securing a lasting peace in Ukraine was essential to deter Russian President Putin from further aggression.


His article was meant to show the U.S. that European nations should have a role in discussions on ending the nearly 3-year-old conflict.


French President Emmanuel Macron also warned that European countries should do more for their collective security, as talks between the United States and Russia loom.


The U.K. premier is due to join leaders from Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, the Netherlands and Denmark at the Paris meeting on Monday, just days ahead of the anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.


In an interview with NBC’s “Meet the Press” that aired Sunday, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy said, “I will never accept any decisions between the United States and Russia about Ukraine. Never. The war in Ukraine is against us, and it is our human losses.”


Zelenskyy said he told Trump in a call they had last week that Putin is only pretending to want peace.


“I said that he is a liar. And [Trump] said, ‘I think my feeling is that he's ready for these negotiations.’ And I said to him, ‘No, he's a liar. He doesn't want any peace.’"




The United States has been Ukraine’s biggest arms supplier during the conflict, but Trump has wavered on continued support and declined during a political debate last year to say that he wants Ukraine to win.


Zelenskyy said that without continued U.S. military support, “Probably it will be very, very, very difficult” to defeat Russia. “And of course, in all the difficult situations, you have a chance. But we will have low chance -- low chance to survive without support of the United States.”


Russia now controls about 20% of Ukraine’s internationally recognized territory, including the Crimean Peninsula it unilaterally annexed in 2014 and the eastern portion of Ukraine pro-Moscow separatists captured after that and since the full-scale February 2022 Russian invasion.


Some information for this article came from Reuters and Agence France-Presse.

## ‘Captain America: Brave New World’ soars toward $100 million holiday weekend

date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA

“Captain America: Brave New World” infused some blockbuster cash into the North American box office, bringing in $88.5 million in ticket sales over the weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday. The Walt Disney Co. release is by far the biggest opener of 2025 and the company predicts it will hit $100 million domestically and $192.4 globally by the end of Monday's Presidents' Day holiday.


It’s Marvel's first major release since “Deadpool & Wolverine” broke records last summer and re-energized a Marvel fanbase that some worried was weakening after the poor showing for “The Marvels.”


Playing in 4,105 locations in the U.S. and Canada, “Brave New World” is also a major transition for the “Captain America” brand: Anointing Anthony Mackie’s Sam Wilson as the new Cap, officially taking over from Chris Evans, who played the character for almost a decade. Harrison Ford co-stars as the U.S. president who transforms into the Red Hulk.


But “Brave New World,” directed by Julius Onah, had a bit of a handicap going into the weekend: Poor reviews, though superhero movies can soar without the stamp of approval from critics. The film is currently sitting at 51% “rotten” on Rotten Tomatoes. It's not the worst in the Marvel Cinematic Universe — “Eternals” has a 47% rating and “Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania” has a 46% — but the latest film is on the very low end of the spectrum.


In his review for The Associated Press, Mark Kennedy wrote that it is, “a highly processed, empty calorie, regret-later candy of a movie.”


Audiences were more generous in their opinions. The “verified audience score” from Rotten Tomatoes was 80% and its CinemaScore was a B-. Exit polls showed that men made up 63% of the opening weekend audience.


The bar for biggest opening of the year wasn’t terribly high: “Dog Man” held the title for two weeks with its $36 million launch.


And “Brave New World's” showing is the middle range for an MCU film. Not accounting for inflation, it sits between “Guardians of the Galaxy” and “Thor: The Dark World.”


It also cost significantly less than many of the big budget Marvel movies, with a reported production price tag of $180 million, excluding the millions spent on marketing and promotion.


After only one Marvel movie in 2024, “Brave New World” is the first of three major theatrical releases set for 2025. It is to be followed by “Thunderbolts(asterisk)” in May and “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” in July.


“The superhero genre has taken a hit over the past few years, but audiences still have a huge interest in seeing them on the big screen,” said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore.


Second place at this week's box office went to “Paddington in Peru,” the third installment in the beloved franchise, which finally opened in North America this weekend. Released by Sony, it earned an estimated $13 million and should hit $16 million by Monday. The StudioCanal film opened in the United Kingdom in early November 2024 and went into the weekend with $104 million from its international run.


Dougal Wilson took over directing duties for Paul King for this film, which also recast Emily Mortimer as Mrs. Brown, originally played by Sally Hawkins. The other main cast, including Ben Whishaw as Paddinton's voice, remained intact.

## US ‘border czar’ unhappy with pace of migrant arrests

date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA

U.S. President Donald Trump’s “border czar” said Sunday he is “not happy” with the number of undocumented migrants being arrested by immigration agents and deported to their home countries. 


Tom Homan told CNN’s “State of the Union” show that 14,000 migrants had been arrested since Trump was inaugurated January 20, but said, “We’ve got to do a lot more.” 


Many of those arrested have been flown back to their native lands or sent to the prison on the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, while some have been released to live in the United States pending court proceedings. 


The U.S. estimates that 11 million undocumented migrants are living in the U.S., with Trump pledging during his 2024 run for the presidency to find and deport “millions” of them. Officials say that the first arrests have targeted migrants convicted of crimes in the U.S. but that anyone living in the country without proper immigration documentation could be targeted. 


Homan said the number being deported is “a lot higher” than under the former administration of President Joe Biden, but added, “We’ve got to get the targeting and production up. It’s hard work.” 


The Trump administration has tapped law enforcement personnel from several U.S. agencies to augment those at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, which normally controls migration issues. 


In the first days of the Trump administration, there were hundreds of migrant arrests daily and there still are, but just not as many. 


The Department of Homeland Security reported about 800 arrests a day in late January, topping out at 1,179 on Jan. 26. The figure was fewer than 600 a day in the first two weeks of February. 


The Trump administration had set a goal of 1,200 to 1,500 arrests a day.

## VOA immigration weekly recap, Feb. 9-15, 2025

date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA

Editor's note: Here is a look at immigration-related news around the U.S. this week. Questions? Tips? Comments? Email the VOA immigration team: ImmigrationUnit@voanews.com.


Trump administration moves quickly with mass deportation plans


Since taking office, U.S. President Donald Trump has declared illegal immigration a national emergency. The Trump administration ramped up its mass deportation efforts, expanding the use of expedited removal and using Guantanamo Bay as a detention site for certain migrants. The moves have raised concerns among immigration advocates, who argue that the policies lack transparency and could violate due process rights. VOA’s immigration reporter, Aline Barros, reports.


US fires 20 immigration judges from backlogged courts 


The administration of President Donald Trump has fired 20 immigration judges without explanation, a union official said Saturday amid sweeping moves to shrink the size of the federal government. On Friday, 13 judges who had yet to be sworn in and five assistant chief immigration judges were dismissed without notice, said Matthew Biggs, president of the International Federation of Professional & Technical Engineers, which represents federal workers. Two other judges were fired under similar circumstances last week. The Associated Press reports.


With doors closed to US, asylum-seekers turn to a new life in Mexico 


When Angelica Delgado took a one-way flight to Mexico as she fled Cuba in December, she was set on seeking asylum in the United States. But after President Donald Trump effectively slammed the door on asylum-seekers crossing the U.S. border when he took office last month, the 23-year-old recalibrated her plans. She decided she would seek protection in Mexico. The Associated Press reports.


US deports 119 migrants from several nations to Panama


Panama has received the first U.S. flight carrying deportees from other nations as the administration of President Donald Trump takes Panama up on its offer to act as a stopover for expelled migrants, the Central American nation's president said Thursday. "Yesterday, a flight from the United States Air Force arrived with 119 people from diverse nationalities of the world," President Jose Raul Mulino said Thursday in his weekly news briefing. He said migrants from China, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and other countries were on board. The Associated Press reports.


Chicago nonprofit helps undocumented migrants afraid to leave home 


Amid nationwide immigration raids, a community organization in Chicago is helping undocumented migrants who say they are afraid to leave their homes for fear of being detained. Veronica Villafane narrates this report by Enrique Garcia Fuentes.


Arrests for illegal border crossings fall in Texas 


An idled Border Patrol bus sat empty this past week, on standby for any migrants surrendering near the southern tip of Texas. Agents in two speedboats zipped by pockets of sandy shores, known landing spots for people entering the U.S. illegally from Mexico on inner tubes, but saw nothing suspicious. Once-busy river landings near the Texas border city of Mission were barren of the migrants who previously crossed there, although the riverbank was littered with clothes, plastic bracelets issued by smugglers and a teddy bear on an unusually cold Thursday morning. The Associated Press reports.


New York City mayor to allow ICE agents at Rikers jail


New York City Mayor Eric Adams says he will allow federal immigration officials to operate at the city's Rikers Island jail following a meeting Thursday with President Donald Trump's border czar. Adams said he will issue an executive order reestablishing the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement presence at the complex — one of the nation's largest and most notorious lockups — as had been the case under prior administrations. The Associated Press reports.


VOA60 Africa - Nigeria: Thousands of refugees return from Chad 


Thousands of Nigerians who fled to Chad to escape jihadi violence in Nigeria’s northeast have returned after more than a decade. Around 3,600 refugees arrived in Maiduguri, the regional capital of Borno State, aboard trucks.


Immigration around the world


Guam a doorway to US for Chinese asylum-seekers 


President Donald Trump’s immigration policy has mainly been focused on migrants trying to cross into the U.S. at its border with Mexico, some having made the perilous trek from as far as South America. Out in the western Pacific Ocean, some Chinese are taking an equally dangerous route to the U.S. VOA's Yu Yao and Jiu Dao have their story, narrated by Elizabeth Lee.


VOA Creole: Congressman asks Trump to renew TPS for Haitians


Republican Congressman Mike Lawler of New York told VOA in an exclusive interview that he will ask President Donald Trump to renew Temporary Protected Status for Haitians. TPS will expire for current holders in February 2026. Lawler told VOA that gang violence, drug and arms trafficking, and an overall lack of security make it untenable to deport the Haitians.


Radio offers connection for longtime Afghan refugee


Arriving as a refugee in Pakistan four decades ago, Besmillah Miakhil’s first purchase was a radio. Now 88, Miakhil says broadcasts help keep him connected to his home country, Afghanistan. From Kohat, Pakistan, Muska Safi has the story, narrated by Bezhan Hamdard.

## Rubio: Hamas 'must be eradicated'

date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA

The U.S. fully endorsed Israel’s war aims in Gaza on Sunday, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying that Hamas “must be eradicated” and "cannot continue as a military or government force."


Rubio met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem at the start of a regional tour as the first phase of a tenuous Israel-Hamas ceasefire expires in two weeks, with the second segment yet to be negotiated.


Rubio, on his first trip to the Middle East as the new top U.S. diplomat, told Netanyahu that “as long as [Hamas] stands as a force that can govern or as a force that can administer or as a force that can threaten by use of violence, peace becomes impossible.”




Rubio is likely to face continued opposition from Arab nations about U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to move Palestinians out of Gaza into neighboring countries and then for Israel to hand over the narrow territory along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea to the U.S. to own and redevelop.


While U.S. allies and adversaries alike have assailed Trump’s Gaza plan, Netanyahu has welcomed it, saying that he and Trump have a "common strategy" for Gaza's future.




Echoing Trump, the Israeli leader said "the gates of hell would be open" if Hamas does not release dozens of remaining hostages abducted in its Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war.


Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist group, freed three hostages Saturday in exchange for nearly 400 Palestinians who had been jailed in Israel. But the militants continue to hold dozens of hostages they captured in the terror attack that killed 1,200 people.


Israel’s counteroffensive during 15 months of fighting in Gaza has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, according to the territory's health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. Israel, without proving evidence, says it has killed over 17,000 militants.




Rubio and Netanyahu met as the first phase of the ceasefire nears its end. In the second phase, the tentative plan calls for Hamas to release dozens of remaining hostages in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners, drafting of a permanent truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces. But the detailed terms of the deal have yet to be negotiated.


The tough U.S. stance aligning with Netanyahu’s position could complicate efforts to continue talks with Hamas, which, despite suffering heavy losses in the war, remains intact and in control of Gaza.


Some of Netanyahu’s supporters in the Israeli government want to continue the war when the first phase of the ceasefire ends but resuming it could endanger the lives of the remaining hostages.


Netanyahu has offered Hamas a chance to surrender and send its top leaders into exile, but Hamas has rejected such a scenario.


Meanwhile, despite the ceasefire largely holding, the Israeli military said it carried out an airstrike early Sunday on people who approached its forces in southern Gaza.


The Hamas-run Interior Ministry said the strike killed three of its policemen while they were securing the entry of aid trucks near Rafah, on the Egyptian border.




Hamas described the attack as a "serious violation" of the ceasefire and accused Netanyahu of trying to sabotage the deal.


During his tour of the region, Rubio was not scheduled to meet with any Palestinian officials.


Egypt says it is hosting an Arab summit on Feb. 27, and is working with other countries on a counterproposal that would allow for Gaza to be rebuilt without removing its population. Human rights groups say the expulsion of Palestinians would likely violate international law.


Arab nations have long called for creation of an independent Palestinian state to exist alongside Israel, which the U.S. has also supported. But Netanyahu opposes a two-state solution and U.S. ownership of Gaza also would likely end the possibility of a Palestinian state encompassing Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank.


Egypt has warned that any mass influx of Palestinians from Gaza would undermine its nearly half-century-old peace treaty with Israel, a cornerstone of American influence in the region.


Rubio is also set to visit the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.


The United Arab Emirates was the leading force behind the 2020 Abraham Accords in which four Arab states normalized relations with Israel during Trump's first White House term. Trump hopes to expand the accords to include Saudi Arabia, potentially offering closer U.S. defense ties, but the kingdom has said it will not normalize relations with Israel without a pathway to a Palestinian state.

## 9 dead, including 8 in Kentucky, in latest winter weather blast

date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA

LOUISVILLE, Ky. — At least nine people have died in the most recent round of harsh weather to pummel the U.S., including eight people in Kentucky who died as creeks swelled from heavy rain and water covered roads. 


Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said Sunday that hundreds of people stranded by flooding had to be rescued. 


Beshear said many of the deaths, including a mother and 7-year-old child, were caused by cars getting stuck in high water. 


“So folks, stay off the roads right now and stay alive,” he said. “This is the search and rescue phase, and I am very proud of all the Kentuckians that are out there responding, putting their lives on the line.” 


Beshear said the storms have knocked out power to about 39,000 homes, but he warned that harsh winds in some areas could increase outages. 


Much of the U.S. beyond Kentucky faced another round of biting winter weather. The Northern Plains faced life-threatening cold, and tornado watches were issued for parts of Georgia and Florida. 


Hart County Coroner Tony Roberts said earlier that the mother and child were swept away Saturday night in the Bonnieville community. In southeastern Kentucky, a 73-year-old man was found dead in floodwaters in Clay County, County Emergency Management Deputy Director Revelle Berry said. 


Parts of Kentucky and Tennessee received up to 6 inches 15 centimeters (6 inches) of rain during the weekend storms, said Bob Oravec, a senior forecaster with the National Weather Service. 


“The effects will continue for a while, a lot of swollen streams and a lot of flooding going on,” Oravec said Sunday. “Any time there’s flooding, the flooding can last a lot longer than the rain lasts.” 


In Atlanta, a person was killed when an “extremely large tree” fell on a home early Sunday, according to Atlanta Fire Rescue Capt. Scott Powell. He told reporters that firefighters were dispatched just before 5 a.m. after a 911 call. 


Elsewhere, bone-chilling cold is expected for the Northern Plains with low temperatures into the minus 30s Celsius (minus 30s Fahrenheit) near the Canadian border. Dangerously cold wind chill temperatures in the Dakotas and Minnesota of minus 40 Celsius (minus 40 Fahrenheit) to minus 45.6 Celsius (minus 50 Fahrenheit) are expected. 


Heavy snowfall amounts were expected in parts of New England and northern New York. In some areas, wind gusts could reach about 97 kph (60 mph) and create “hazardous whiteout conditions,” the NWS said. 


Kentucky faces severe flooding 


Water submerged cars and buildings in Kentucky and mudslides blocked roads in Virginia late Saturday into Sunday. Both of the states were under flood warnings, along with Tennessee and Arkansas. The National Weather Service warned residents to stay off the roads. 


Chilly temperatures replaced the heavy rains with snow early Sunday in parts of Kentucky. 


The Kentucky River Medical Center in the city of Jackson said closed its emergency department and was transferring all patients to two other hospitals in the region. The hospital said it would re-evaluate conditions Sunday morning to determine when it can safely reopen. The north fork of the Kentucky River was forecast to crest nearly 4.3 meters (14 feet) above flood stage that afternoon, the weather service said. 


Photos posted by authorities and residents on social media showed cars and buildings underwater in south-central and eastern Kentucky. In Buchanan County, Virginia, the sheriff’s office said multiple roads were blocked by mudslides. 


The Simpson County Office of Emergency Management in Kentucky said authorities performed several rescues from stalled-out vehicles in floodwaters. 


“Stay home if you can,” the office said on Facebook. 


New England faces snow, then sleet 


Meanwhile heavy snow was expected to blanket much of New England and then transition to sleet. 


Oravec said Sunday that snowfall in the region was relatively light, due to the freezing rain and sleet mix. 


Snow and arctic temperatures swept much of the Midwest and Upper Plains on Saturday, covering roads in eastern Nebraska, northern Iowa and much of Wisconsin. Winter weather advisories were issued for parts of those states and Michigan, with up to 10.6 centimeters (4 inches) of snow predicted throughout Iowa, southern Wisconsin and most of Michigan by Sunday evening. 


Frigid polar vortex 


Meteorologists said the U.S. was about to get its 10th and coldest polar vortex stretching event this season, with the northern Rockies and northern Plains first in line. Weather forces in the Arctic are combining to push the chilly air that usually stays near the North Pole into the U.S. and Europe. 


In Denver, where temperatures were expected to dip as low as minus 10 degrees Celsius (14 degrees Fahrenheit) over the weekend, the city opened shelters for those living on the streets.

## White South Africans gather in support of Trump, his claims they are victims of racism

date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA

PRETORIA, SOUTH AFRICA — Some white South Africans showed support for President Donald Trump on Saturday and gathered at the U.S. Embassy in Pretoria to claim they are victims of racism by their own government.


Hundreds of protesters held placards that read "Thank God for President Trump" and displayed other messages criticizing what they see as racist laws instituted by the South African government that discriminate against the white minority.


Many were from the Afrikaner community that Trump focused on in an executive order a week ago that cut aid and assistance to the Black-led South African government. In the order, Trump said South Africa's Afrikaners, who are descendants of mainly Dutch colonial settlers, were being targeted by a new law that allows the government to expropriate private land. 


The South African government has denied its new law is tied to race and says Trump's claims over the country and the law have been full of misinformation and distortions. 


Trump said land was being expropriated from Afrikaners — which the order referred to as "racially disfavored landowners" — when no land has been taken under the law. Trump also announced a plan to offer Afrikaners refugee status in the U.S. They are only one part of South Africa's white minority. 


In a speech to Parliament this week, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said the forced removal of any people from their land will never be allowed in South Africa again after millions of Blacks were dispossessed of property under the apartheid system of white minority rule and hundreds of years of colonialism before that. 


"The people of this country know the pain of forced removals," Ramaphosa said. He said the land law does not allow any arbitrary taking of land and only refers to land that can be redistributed for the public good. 


The Trump administration's criticism and punishment of South Africa has elevated a long-standing dilemma in the country over moves to address the wrongs of centuries of white minority rule that oppressed the Black majority. 


According to the government, the land law aims to fairly address the inequality that the majority of farmland in South Africa is owned by whites, even though they make up just 7% of the country's population. 


White protesters on Saturday held banners referencing the expropriation law but also other affirmative action policies put in place by the government since the end of apartheid in 1994 to advance opportunities for Blacks. Those laws, known as Black Economic Empowerment, have been a source of frustration for some white people.


Influential Trump adviser Elon Musk — who was raised in South Africa — has also criticized South Africa’s government and claimed it is anti-white for years, although some have questioned his motivations. He has recently failed to get a license for his Starlink satellite internet service in South Africa because it doesn’t meet the country’s affirmative action criteria.


While race has long framed South African politics, the country has been largely successful in reconciling its racially diverse people in the years after apartheid. The current government is made up of a coalition of 10 Black-led and white-led political parties that are working together.

## Breakfast is booming at US restaurants. Is it also contributing to high egg prices?

date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA

It's a chicken-and-egg problem: Restaurants are struggling with record-high U.S. egg prices, but their omelets, scrambles and huevos rancheros may be part of the problem.


Breakfast is booming at U.S. eateries. First Watch, a restaurant chain that serves breakfast, brunch and lunch, nearly quadrupled its locations over the past decade to 570. Eggs Up Grill has 90 restaurants in nine southern states, up from 26 in 2018. Florida-based Another Broken Egg Café celebrated its 100th restaurant last year.


Fast-food chains are also adding more breakfast items. Starbucks, which launched egg bites in 2017, now has a breakfast menu with 12 separate items containing eggs. Wendy's reintroduced breakfast in 2020 and offers 10 items with eggs.


Reviews website Yelp said 6,421 breakfast and brunch businesses opened in the United States last year, 23% more than in 2019.


In normal times, producers could meet the demand for all those eggs. But an ongoing bird flu outbreak, which so far has forced farms to slaughter nearly 159 million chickens, turkeys and other birds — including nearly 47 million since the start of December — is making supplies scarcer and pushing up prices. In January, the average price of eggs in the U.S. hit a record $4.95 per dozen.


The percentage of eggs that go to U.S. restaurants versus other places, like grocery stores or food manufacturers, is not publicly available. U.S. Foods, a restaurant supplier, and Cal-Maine Foods, the largest U.S. producer of shell eggs, did not respond to The Associated Press' requests for comment.


But demand from restaurants is almost certainly growing. Foot traffic at U.S. restaurants has grown the most since 2019 for morning meals, 2019, according to market research firm Circana. Pre-lunchtime hours accounted for 21% of total restaurant visits in 2024.




Breakfast sandwiches are the most popular order during morning visits, Circana said, and 70% of the breakfast sandwiches on U.S. menus include eggs.


Eggs Up Grill CEO Ricky Richardson said breakfast restaurants took off after the COVID pandemic because people longed for comfort and connection. As inflation made food more expensive, customers saw breakfast and lunch as more affordable options for eating out, he said.


The growth in restaurant demand reverses a pattern that emerged during the pandemic, when consumers tried to stock up on eggs for home use but restaurants needed fewer of them because many of them had to close for a time, according to Brian Earnest, a lead economist for animal proteins at CoBank.


U.S. egg consumption declined for more than five decades before reaching a low of 247 per person in 2008, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. As nutritional research and marketing established eggs as an inexpensive protein source instead of heart-clogging cholesterol bombs, per capita consumption of egg products grew to the equivalent of 292 fresh eggs in 2019, the data shows.


"Consumers think eggs are really fresh, so if you're making something with eggs, you know it's fresh," Earnest said.


Before the pandemic reduced demand and bird flu outbreaks impacted supplies, the USDA had forecast that Americans would continue eating more eggs. By 2023, the most recent year for which annual data is available, they were down to 249 eggs per person.


Other trends have impacted the economics of eggs. To address animal rights concerns, McDonald's and some other companies have switched to 100% cage-free eggs, which limits the sources they will buy from. Ten states, including California and Colorado, have passed laws restricting egg sales to products from cage-free environments.


"It makes the market much more complicated than it was 20 years ago," Earnest said.


The higher prices are hitting restaurants hard. Wholesale egg prices hit a national average of $7.34 per dozen last week, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. That was 51% higher than at the beginning of the year. Wholesale costs may be higher than retail prices since grocers use eggs as a loss leader to get customers in the door.


Some chains, like Waffle House, have added a surcharge to help offset the cost of eggs. Others may turn to egg substitutes like tapioca starch for some recipes or cut egg dishes from the menu, said Phil Kafarakis, the president and CEO of the International Foodservice Manufacturers Association.


First Watch President and CEO Chris Tomasso said eggs are critical for the chain's brand and are found in the majority of its offerings, whether at the center of the plate or as an ingredient in batters. So far, he said, the company has been able to obtain the eggs it needs and isn't charging extra for them.


First Watch is also increasing portion sizes for non-egg items like meat and potatoes, Tomasso said.


Richardson, of Eggs Up Grill, said he recently met with franchisees to discuss adding a surcharge but they decided against it.


"Eggs have always been and will continue to be an important part of American diets," Richardson said.

## US man sues travel company after hippo kills wife on Zambia trip

date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA

A New Jersey man whose wife was killed in a horrific hippopotamus attack last year during a safari in Africa is suing the U.S. company that arranged the trip, alleging it failed to ensure their safety and did not adequately screen and supervise the tour guides.


Craig and Lisa Manders were on a guided walk in Zambia in June when a hippo charged out of the water, grabbed Lisa Manders by its mouth and crushed her head and body with its bite, according to the lawsuit filed against African Portfolio, a safari tour company based in Greenwich, Connecticut. The company denies the lawsuit's allegations.


The lawsuit, filed Feb. 5 in Stamford, Connecticut, alleges that as a horrified Craig Manders watched the attack, the tour guides — including at least one armed with a rifle — walked away without helping the couple. Lisa Manders, 70, suffered catastrophic injuries and died shortly after, the lawsuit says.


"We're doing this because this should never have happened," said Paul Slager, an attorney who is representing Craig Manders with his law partner, Nicole Coates. "There are basic safety standards that businesses are expected to follow, and that includes people in the safari tour industry. And those were not followed, and the consequences here were absolutely devastating."


Slager said the lawsuit seeks monetary damages that have not yet been determined, as well as accountability for Lisa Manders' death and keeping others safe in the future. He said Craig Manders was not giving interviews.


The Manderses, of Cranford, New Jersey, were on a special anniversary trip and it was their first time in Africa, Slager said. Lisa Manders had worked in the financial industry for over 40 years and loved cooking, traveling and visiting New York City, where she was born in Queens in 1953, according to her obituary. The couple had three children and a granddaughter.


The company's lawyer, Rodney Gould, said it was not negligent or reckless in connection with Lisa Manders' death. He said African Portfolio only arranged the couple's lodging and the owners of the lodging, Chiawa Safaris in Zambia, provided the tour guides.


"It's a horrible tragedy when somebody goes on one of these trips and is injured or killed. It's awful," Gould said. "I think it's important to understand what African Portfolio's role in this is. It's a tour operator. It arranges trips. It puts together the pieces."




He added, "My client didn't conduct the safari. It arranged it. It booked all the components."


Gould also said the company was not negligent in vetting Chiawa, because it has an excellent reputation. He said African Portfolio will either ask a judge to dismiss the lawsuit or request that the matter go to arbitration, which was a condition of an agreement the Manderses signed for the trip.


In a statement, African Portfolio did not directly address the lawsuit. It said Chiawa arranged the walking safari and guests were accompanied by an experienced and highly trained guide, a ranger and an armed National Park scout. It said Chiawa told authorities that safety measures were implemented before the attack and "repeated warnings" were issued to guests to return to the safety of the vehicle "during the incident."


Asked whether the guests were warned about the hippo before the attack, African Portfolio said in an email only that "the statement is an accurate reflection of the events as we understand them." Gould declined to comment.


The company also said its founder flew to Zambia immediately after the attack and joined Chiawa's owner in ensuring that "everything possible was being done to support the family and all those involved. Our thoughts and prayers continue to be with the family, and everyone else involved in this tragic incident."


The lawsuit, which does not mention Chiawa, says African safaris are "inherently dangerous activities" because of the unpredictability and sometime aggressive nature of wild animals, and they require careful planning and execution to be completed safely. It says African Portfolio vetted and oversaw the tour guides and vouched that they were competent, qualified and trained to keep people safe.


The suit alleges that African Portfolio "encouraged and/or permitted" the Manderses to be exposed to an "avoidable and highly dangerous encounter with a dangerous hippopotamus in the Zambian wilderness." It also accuses the company of failing to provide safe conditions during the wilderness walk and failing to ensure that the tour guides were adequately selected, screened, supervised and trained to provide a safe experience.


African Portfolio also failed to take adequate steps to protect the Manderses before and during the attack, the suit alleges.


Hippos are the world's second-largest land mammals after elephants, measuring about 3.5 meters long and about 1.5 meters tall, according to International Fund for Animal Welfare. The average male hippo weighs about 3,200 kilograms.


Hippos are known to be territorial and aggressive at times. A year before Lisa Manders died, seven people were killed in the southern African nation of Malawi when a hippo charged into a canoe and capsized it on a river. Estimates of how many people are killed by hippos each year vary, with lower figures beginning at around 500.


Lisa Manders suffered "significant premorbid fear and emotional pain, suffering and mental anguish" before her death, the suit says. Craig Manders suffered severe and debilitating emotional and psychological injuries that have made it difficult for him to cope with daily routines, it says.


The lawsuit is seeking damages on allegations of negligence and recklessness.


"He's suing both for the loss of his wife and the impact that has on him and his life," Slager said. "And he also has a claim for having witnessed what happened to her, having seen the attack, which is unthinkable. It's unimaginable."

## Photos lost in US disasters find way home with help from people who care

LOS ANGELES — Hollowed-out homes. Cars entombed by mud. Unpeopled roads. Belongings reduced to dirt and debris. 


It all took a toll on Taylor Schenker. 


After Hurricane Helene last September, Schenker was upset by the deluge of images of Asheville, North Carolina. "This storm has taken so much," she said, "and it's so jarring to see the photos of the horrible devastation."


So less than a week after the storm, she set out to do something about the wide-scale loss. 


While helping a friend search for belongings cast downriver, she stumbled on a handful of photos of strangers — mud-caked, curled up in tree branches and stuck under river rocks. The images captured family reunions, newborn babies, weddings, birthday parties, beloved pets and school portraits. 


"These tiny photos had been through so much and miraculously had washed up and were in decent enough condition that you could see what they were," said Schenker, 27. "It stuck with me." 


To reclaim the search phrase "photos from Helene," she created an Instagram for "something positive, which is reuniting people with their memories." She set up a post-office box, linked up with a volunteer search and rescue crew, and ultimately uncovered more than 500 photos — or what she calls "little needles in a haystack." 


When Schenker made her first match, she got chills. 


Then, sitting in her car, she cried. 




Photos found amid muck 


We hold onto photos to keep memories alive — of people, places and moments that might otherwise fade. Or sometimes are ripped away abruptly. 


Schenker has since returned more than 70 such images. A stack of them were hand-delivered to Mary Moss, whose car was destroyed by an uprooted tree as she and her husband evacuated the Asheville home where they had lived for almost 40 years. 


"It was really kind of overwhelming at first when she handed me those pictures. I just couldn't even speak," Moss said. "You don't expect something as fragile as photos to be retrieved." 


Months later, they've received some FEMA assistance and found a temporary home, which they're gradually furnishing with church donations. But some things are irreplaceable. 


"This is not really about losing the home and all the material stuff in there. But what's been devastating is that that was everything we had of Tommy," she said of their son who died at age 12 from a genetic disorder. "It's those memories and the little things, the photos, that you can't replace." 


As Schenker later understood it, "When they lost their home, they lost virtually all proof that this child existed." 


"It is such a privilege to look into the intimate moments of people's lives," she said. "They've literally lost everything and they can't ever recreate those childhood photos." 




In photos Schenker found nearly 3 miles (5 kilometers) from the Moss family home, Tommy is seen as a 2-year-old dressed like an angel for a Christmas pageant. In another, he is wearing a toddler-sized suit; in yet another, he's playing at daycare alongside his younger brother Dallas. 


"It is just breathtaking," Moss said. "This is one thing that the river didn't get to take — or didn't get to keep." 


Smoke, water, ash, soot


More than 2,000 miles (3,200 kilometers) away, in the Altadena foothills of Los Angeles, Claire Schwartz, 31, began to collect photos with a similar idea: Find images, post them online, try to unite them with their owners. 


After the Eaton fire, but before the first rain, she panicked. When rain and ash mix, it makes lye, which destroys photos. "Someone has to do this ASAP," she remembers thinking to herself. "And I realized it had to be me — because nobody else was doing it." 


Luca Ackerman, a New York-based photo conservator, cautions that mold can start to develop 48 hours after water exposure. To slow the deterioration process, he freezes such prints — and advised to not wipe off any surfaces, which can drag toxic oils across the print, "driving particles deeper into the material." Some photos are so brittle, too, that when touched they may disintegrate. 




In the wake of disasters, conservators like Ackerman are deployed in volunteer rotations with the National Heritage Responders. Rapidly, he trains art handlers and museum staff how to treat sensitive materials, whether they are damaged by smoke, water, ash or soot. 


Wearing a respirator, nitrile gloves and booties, Schwartz swiftly set out to salvage photos — finding them alongside pages from yearbooks, sheet music, and children's art in nearby parks, neighbors' front yards and a golf course. 


"The wind has scattered everything, everywhere. And trash is mixed in with precious mementos everywhere you look," she said. "It's just absolutely bizarre how stuff clumps together and travels as a unit." 


Finding the photographed people


Normally, a local library would take in found items, but the Altadena Public Library, along with more than 9,000 homes, burned to the ground. Librarians are redirecting residents who have found photos to Schwartz. 


She adopted parts of her process from what she learned as an archival intern at the Corita Art Center — protecting photos in acid-free, glassine envelopes and storing them in a waterproof box in a temperature-controlled room with good air circulation. 


Last week, she made her first match: disposable camera photos of teenagers, smiling, in prom dresses and glittering tiaras. The image is flecked with damage, but all four corners are intact. 


"It's funny — you formulate these ideas of who the person is," Schwartz said. "She was kind of exactly what I pictured, just really friendly and bubbly and lovely — you could tell that just from her photos." 


Schwartz's house survived because her neighbors stayed behind to fight the fire themselves, but the landscape around it — full of burned-out lots, ghostly palm trees and blackened telephone poles — is otherworldly and changed. "It looks like the moon. It looks like another planet. It doesn't look like home." 


Nearby is Joshua Simpson, a photographer who lost his Altadena home and studio, along with decades of film negatives, silver gelatin prints and camera equipment. But something meaningful survived. 


"The very first thing we found was this beautiful vintage print of my mother-in-law holding my wife when she was a newborn baby," said Simpson. The black-and-white photo carries an extra layer of poignancy, as his mother-in-law died just few months ago. "We were both pretty overjoyed in that moment. It felt a little magical finding that one." 


Above all, Ackerman said, personal safety comes first. "When you're picking up people's heirlooms or family photographs, that can be traumatic — even if they're not yours," he said. 


When people survive catastrophic events such as wildfires or hurricanes, and are left to cope with loss, they may express a wide range of emotions — from overwhelmed to outraged to numb sometimes all at once. Tragedies, though, can also strengthen the ties in communities, and people like Schenker and Schwartz are Exhibits A and B. 


"Disasters like this really bring out the best in people," Moss said. "You know, I can laugh or I can cry about it — and I choose to laugh about it. Fortunately, we didn't lose the most important thing. That's lives."

## Fistfights, anthem boos in stormy US-Canada ice hockey clash

date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA

MONTREAL — Three fights in the first nine seconds and a chorus of deafening boos for the US national anthem marked a stormy ice hockey clash between the United States and Canada in Montreal on Saturday.


An emotionally charged showdown between the star-studded lineups of the North American rivals -- which comes against a backdrop of political tension between the two neighboring countries -- erupted into violence from the opening puck drop at Montreal's Bell Centre.


The U.S. squad clinched a spot in the 4 Nations Face-Off final Thursday at Boston with a 3-1 victory, but the result was almost a footnote to the mayhem that marked the start of a game played before a fiercely partisan Canadian crowd.


With Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in the crowd, home fans booed The Star-Spangled Banner before the game, catcalls that have become a regular feature at NHL and NBA games in Canada since U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on Canadian goods crossing U.S. borders.


Then came three fights in nine seconds.


"I just think it's very indicative of what this means to the players," U.S. coach Mike Sullivan said. "There's two teams out there that are very competitive, that have a ton of pride for their respective teams and their countries.


"For me, when you have an investment in trying to win like the way that it occurred -- I think that's an indication of it. What an incredible hockey game."


Canada coach Jon Cooper, the two-time Stanley Cup champion coach for Tampa Bay who will guide the Canadian 2026 Olympic team, said the melee in the first moments was not prearranged.


"It wasn't planned," Cooper said. "That wasn't two coaches throwing guys over and saying 'This is happening' -- none of that happened. That was as organic as it gets."


At the opening puck drop, the gloves came off for real on the ice as Canada's Brandon Hagel and Matthew Tkachuk of the United States began swinging punches as the crowd went wild and teammates skated back to give the brawlers a clear stage at center ice.


Referees restored order, sent the combatants to the penalty box and tried to restart the game, only for Canada's Sam Bennett and Brady Tkachuk of the Americans to drop their gloves and trade punches until officials could break them apart, Tkachuk following his brother into the penalty box.


The game was restarted but only got to nine seconds before American J.T. Miller and Canada's Colton Parayko began the third and final fight.


'Jacked up'


Asked about U.S. players having agreed on the fight-filled start beforehand on a group chat, Sullivan said he was unaware of such a move.


"These guys care very much about winning," he said. "Brady and Matthew, they play the game with so much emotion -- and they're leaders in so many ways.


"It's just an indication of how much these guys care and how bad they want to win. I was not aware of it. Obviously, there's a lot of energy around this game. I knew we were going to be jacked up to play."


Top NHL players from the United States and Canada had not faced off against each other for their home nations since the 2016 World Cup of Hockey, the league's best traditionally skipping the world championships and the NHL having chosen not to send its players to the 2018 PyeongChang or 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.


"It was probably I guess 10 years of no international hockey exhaled in a minute and a half," Cooper said.


The intense drama continued once the game began in earnest with Canada going ahead on Connor McDavid's goal 5:31 into the first period.


But the Americans equalized on Jake Guentzel's goal at 10:15 of the first period and the U.S. went ahead to stay on Dylan Larkin's tally at 13:33 of the second period. The Americans sealed the triumph on Guentzel's empty-net goal with 1:19 remaining in the third period.

## US, South Korea, Japan reaffirm pledge to seek denuclearization of North Korea

date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA

MUNICH  — The United States, Japan and South Korea renewed their "resolute" pledge to seek the "complete denuclearization" of North Korea, according to a joint statement from the three allies released Saturday.


The statement came after new U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio held his first meetings with South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul and Japan's top diplomat Takeshi Iwaya on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on Saturday.


"The Secretary and Foreign Ministers reaffirmed their resolute commitment to the complete denuclearization of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) in accordance with the United Nations Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs)," it said.


"They expressed their serious concerns over and the need to address together the DPRK's nuclear and missile programs, malicious cyber activities including cryptocurrency thefts, and increasing military cooperation with Russia," it added.


The three sent a "strong warning" that they "will not tolerate any provocations or threats to their homelands," and vowed to maintain and strengthen international sanctions against Pyongyang.


They also said they were committed to "the immediate resolution of the issues of abductees, detainees, and unrepatriated prisoners of war as well as the issue of separated families."


Largely cut off from the world diplomatically and economically, and under a bevy of sanctions, North Korea with its ongoing nuclear weapons program has been a major thorn in the side of the United States for years.


President Donald Trump, who had a rare series of meetings with Kim Jong Un during his first term in office, has said he will reach out again to the North Korean leader, calling Kim a "smart guy."


Despite Trump's diplomatic overtures, North Korea said in January that its nuclear program would continue "indefinitely."


Pyongyang also said earlier this month it would not tolerate any "provocation" by the United States after Rubio called it a "rogue state" in a radio interview.


It has also slammed a visit by a U.S. nuclear submarine to a naval base in South Korea this month as a "hostile military act."


A summit between Trump and Kim in Hanoi collapsed in 2019 over talks on sanctions relief and what Pyongyang would be willing to give up in return.

## US fires 20 immigration judges from backlogged courts

date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA

SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA — The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has fired 20 immigration judges without explanation, a union official said Saturday amid sweeping moves to shrink the size of the federal government. 


On Friday, 13 judges who had yet to be sworn in and five assistant chief immigration judges were dismissed without notice, said Matthew Biggs, president of the International Federation of Professional & Technical Engineers, which represents federal workers. Two other judges were fired under similar circumstances in the last week. 


It was unclear if they would be replaced. The U.S. Justice Department's Executive Office for Immigration Review, which runs the courts and oversees its roughly 700 judges, did not immediately respond to a request for comment Saturday. 


Immigration courts are backlogged with more than 3.7 million cases, according to Syracuse University's Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse. Applicants can wait years for their asylum case to be decided. There is support across the political spectrum for more judges and support staff, though the first Trump administration also pressured some judges to decide cases more quickly. 


The Trump administration earlier replaced five top court officials, including Mary Cheng, the agency's acting director. Sirce Owen, the current leader and previously an appellate immigration judge, has issued a slew of new instructions, many reversing policies of the Biden administration. 


Last month, the Justice Department halted financial support for nongovernmental organizations to provide information and guidance to people facing deportation but restored funding after a coalition of nonprofit groups filed a federal lawsuit. 


The firings touch on two top Trump priorities: mass deportations and shrinking the size of the federal government. On Thursday, it ordered agencies to lay off nearly all probationary employees who had not yet gained civil service protection, potentially affecting hundreds of thousands of workers. Probationary workers generally have less than a year on the job.

## US East faces flooding as snow forecast for Northeast, cold in Midwest

date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA

LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY — Much of the Eastern U.S. endured a renewed round of harsh, soggy weather Saturday, with snowstorms predicted in the Northeast and heavy winds bringing the threat of tornadoes to the Mississippi Valley.


The states of Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia and Arkansas were under flood warnings, and people were warned by the National Weather Service to stay off the roads. Parts of western Kentucky could face up to 20.3 centimeters of rain.


Governor Andy Beshear preemptively declared a state of emergency in Kentucky, where flash flooding was expected into Sunday.


"We want to specifically put assets in places that flood and have flooded in the past," Beshear said on social media.


Photos posted by authorities and users on social media showed cars and buildings underwater in Warren County, Kentucky, and in Buchanan County, Virginia, where the sheriff's office said multiple roads were blocked by mudslides.


The Simpson County Office of Emergency Management in Kentucky said authorities performed several rescues from stalled-out vehicles in floodwaters.


"Stay home if you can," the office said on Facebook.


Flash flooding was possible in the Mississippi, Tennessee and Ohio valleys, the weather service said. In Tennessee, flash flood warnings were issued for much of the middle of the state through the evening.


The National Weather Service called the expected rain a "major, potentially historic, flash flood event."


Meanwhile heavy snow was expected to blanket much of New England and then transition to sleet, making travel nearly impossible. The heaviest accumulations — possibly 30.5 centimeters or more — were expected in upstate New York and portions of northern New England.


"Ice accumulations up to a quarter inch (half a centimeter) are forecast for some areas, making driving conditions dangerous. Heavy icing in some locations may result in downed trees and power outages," the weather service warned.




Snow and arctic temperatures swept much of the Midwest and Upper Plains, covering roads in eastern Nebraska, northern Iowa and much of Wisconsin. Winter weather advisories were issued for parts of those states and Michigan, with up to 10.6 centimeters of snow predicted throughout Iowa, southern Wisconsin and most of Michigan by Sunday evening.


Frigid polar vortex


Meteorologists said the U.S. was about to get its 10th and coldest polar vortex stretching event this season, with the northern Rockies and northern Plains first in line. Weather forces in the Arctic are combining to push the chilly air that usually stays near the North Pole into the U.S. and Europe.


In Denver, where temperatures were expected to dip as low as minus 10 degrees Celsius over the weekend, the city opened shelters for those living on the streets.


Forecasters reported 2.5 centimeters of snow falling every hour just north of Denver.


The weather service also warned of extreme cold in the Upper Plains over the coming days, with wind chills ranging from minus 34 degree Celsius to as low as minus 51 degrees Celsius in parts of western Montana, North Dakota, northern South Dakota and western Minnesota. People in those areas were urged to stay indoors and make provisions to shelter livestock and other animals.


California struggles with mudslides


Dry weather returned to Southern California after the strongest storm of the year. But the risk of rockslides and mudslides on wildfire-scarred hillsides continued because dangerous slides can strike even after rain stops, particularly in areas where vegetation that helps keep soil anchored has burned away.


Water, debris and boulders rushed down the mountain in the city of Sierra Madre on Thursday night, trapping at least one car in the mud and damaging several homes with mud and debris. Bulldozers cleaned up mud-covered streets in the city of 10,000 people.


A storm in the Sierra Nevada dumped 1.8 meters of snow over 36 hours. Two Mammoth Mountain ski patrol workers were caught in an avalanche during avalanche mitigation work Friday morning, the resort said in a Facebook post. One was extracted and was responsive, while the other was taken to a hospital with serious injuries.

## IRS to lay off thousands of probationary workers in tax season

date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will lay off thousands of probationary workers in the middle of tax season, according to two sources familiar with the agency's plans, and the cuts could happen as soon as next week.


The Trump administration intensified sweeping efforts to shrink the size of the federal workforce. It is doing it by ordering agencies to lay off nearly all probationary employees who had not yet gained civil service protection.


It's unclear how many IRS workers will be affected.


Previously, the administration announced a plan to offer buyouts to almost all federal employees through a "deferred resignation program" to quickly reduce the government workforce. The program deadline was Feb. 6, and administration officials said employees who accept will be able to stop working while still collecting a paycheck until Sept. 30.


However, IRS employees involved in the 2025 tax season were told they will not be allowed to accept a buyout offer from the Trump administration until after the taxpayer filing deadline, according to a letter sent recently to IRS employees.


It is unclear how many workers will be impacted by the layoff announcement plan. Representatives from the U.S. Treasury and IRS did not respond to Associated Press requests for comment.


Jan. 27 was the official start date of the 2025 tax season, and the IRS expects more than 140 million tax returns to be filed by the April 15 deadline. The Biden administration invested heavily in the IRS through an $80 billion infusion of funds in Democrats' Inflation Reduction Act, which included plans to hire tens of thousands of new employees to help with customer service and enforcement as well as new technology to update the tax collection agency.


Republicans have been successful at clawing back that money, and billionaire Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency have called for the U.S. to "delete entire agencies" from the federal government as part of his plan to radically cut spending and restructure its priorities.


Elected officials are trying to fight against DOGE plans. Attorneys general from 14 states challenged the authority of DOGE to access sensitive government data and exercise "virtually unchecked power" in a lawsuit filed Thursday.


The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington, says the actions taken by Musk at the helm of DOGE can only be taken by a nominated and Senate-confirmed official. It cites constitutional provisions that delineate the powers of Congress and the president.
