id="gtk-announces-x11-deprecation-new-android-backend-and-much-more">GTK
announces X11 deprecation, new Android backend, and much more</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>Since a number of GTK developer came together at FOSDEM, the project
figured now was as good a time as any to give an update on what’s coming
in GTK. First, GTK is implementing some hard cut-offs for old platforms
– Windows 10 and macOS 10.15 are now the oldest supported versions,
which will make development quite a bit easier and will simplify several
parts of the codebase. Windows 10 was released in 2015 and macOS 10.15
in 2019, which are fair cut-off points, in my book. GTK 4.18 will also
bring major accessibility improvements with the AccessKit backend,
giving GTK accessibility features on Windows and macOS for the first
time, which is great news. Another major new feature is the new Android
backend, which, while not yet complete, will allow you to run GTK
applications on Android. Do note that this is experimental, so don’t
expect everything to work without any issues quite yet. Lastly, the news
that everyone was freaking out about over the weekend: the X11 backend
has been deprecated, and will be removed in GTK 5. This freaked a lot of
people out, but note that this doesn’t mean you magically can’t use GTK
4 applications on X11 anymore – it merely means that X11 support will be
removed in GTK 5, which doesn’t even exist yet, and with GTK 4 being
supported until GTK 6 is released, people using legacy windowing systems
like Xorg will be fine for a long time to come. As the GTK project notes
on Fedi: The X11 backend being deprecated mainly means that we’re not
going to spend time implementing new features, like dmabuf, graphics
offloading, or Vulkan support. X11 support will still exist until GTK4
is EOL, which will happen once GTK <em>6</em> is released. We’re talking
about a 20 years horizon, at this point… Of course, somebody could show
up tomorrow, and implement everything that the Wayland backend does, but
for X11. We can always undeprecate things. We are not holding our
breath, though… ↫ The GTK project on Fedi This is the right move, and
I’m glad the GTK project is doing this, and is giving everyone ample
time to prepare. A lot of people will still freak out, get mad, and
scream bloody murder at certain individuals in the wider Linux
community, and those people are, of course, free to start working on
Xorg. Like the GTK developers, though, I’m not holding my breath,
because despite years of excessive Wayland hate, not a single person has
stood up to do the work required to keep Xorg going.</p>

inside a PDF file via a RISC-V emulator</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>You might expect PDF files to only be comprised of static documents,
but surprisingly, the PDF file format supports Javascript with its own
separate standard library. Modern browsers (Chromium, Firefox) implement
this as part of their PDF engines. However, the APIs that are available
in the browser are much more limited. The full specfication for the JS
in PDFs was only ever implemented by Adobe Acrobat, and it contains some
ridiculous things like the ability to do 3D rendering, make HTTP
requests, and detect every monitor connected to the user’s system.
However, on Chromium and other browsers, only a tiny subset of this API
was ever implemented, due to obvious security concerns. With this, we
can do whatever computation we want, just with some very limited IO. ↫
LinuxPDF GitHub page I’m both impressed and concerned.</p>

<h2 id="the-gnu-guix-system">The GNU Guix System</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>GNU Guix is a package manager for GNU/Linux systems. It is designed
to give users more control over their general-purpose and specialized
computing environments, and make these easier to reproduce over time and
deploy to one or many devices. ↫ GNU Guix website Guix is basically
GNU’s approach to a reproducible, functional package manager, very
similar to Nix because, well, it’s based on Nix. GNU also has a Linux
distribution built around Nix, the GNU Guix System, which is fully
‘libre’ as all things GNU are, and also makes use of the GNU Shepard
init system. Both Shepard and Guix make use of Guile. The last release
of the GNU Guix System is a few years old already, but it’s a rolling
release, so that’s not much of an issue. It uses the Linux kernel, but
support for GNU Hurd is also being worked on, for whatever that’s worth.
There’s also a third-party distribution that is built around the same
projects, called rde. It focuses on being lightweight, ready for offline
use, and minimal distractions. It’s probably not suitable for most
normal users, but if you’re a power user and you’re looking for
something a little bit different, this could be for you. While it’s in
active development, it’s considered usable and stable by its creators. I
haven’t tried it yet, but I’m definitely intrigued by what it has to
offer. Nix sucks up a lot of the attention in this space, so it’s
interesting to see some of the alternatives that aim for similar
goals.</p>
