<p>
It’s a tale as old as time. A man takes a ride on an electric motorcycle
and thinks to himself, “This is great, but you know what it’s missing?
The ability to morph into an electric snowmobile, too.”
</p>
<p>
Ok, perhaps it’s not the most common thought among us. But that hasn’t
stopped it from apparently becoming a reality thanks to Canadian
designer Steven Foster, who has now spent three years developing and
testing that exact concept to bring the Avvenire Combat e-motorcycle to
life.

Lease deals get all the hype, but most people still want to own the car
after they’re done making all those payments on it. If that sounds like
you, and you’ve been waiting for the interest rates on auto loans to
drop, you’re in luck: there are a bunch of great plug-in cars you can
buy with 0% financing this February!
</p>
<p>
<strong>Update 09FEB25</strong>: added some fresh 0% deals.

– but one thing was absolutely clear: <strong>the Nissan LEAF is the
best new car deal in Chicago</strong>. ***

all cyclists can rejoice in an interesting new “smart handlebar” that
happens to have gotten a friendly helping hand from an unlikely source.
