<p>Xbox and Meta have teamed up to release the
Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition, which the companies say is the first-ever
limited-edition Quest headset. The collaboration isn’t quite proof that
Xbox is embracing VR and mixed reality — it’s being released to
“celebrate the experience of Xbox Cloud Gaming” on Meta Quest, the
companies say. The Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition will be available for
$399.99 in limited […]</p>

<p>Blizzard has always had a strong presence at Gamescom, the big German

<p>Pokémon Go’s final event before Go Fest weekend is “Ancients

<p>The Lonesome Guild, to be published by indie trailblazer Don’t Nod,
is something of a departure from developer Tiny Bull Studios’ previous

<p>A “Lucky Trinket” is an item in Pokémon Go that gives you a

<p>Bottle Caps are a very rare item added to Pokémon games in Pokémon
Sun and Moon, and after many years, you can grab Gold Bottle Caps in
Pokémon Go. These items are still exceedingly rare to find in mainline
games, which makes sense, as they’re used for increasing your Pokémon’s

<p>Growlithe, the Puppy and Scout Pokémon from Kanto, can be found in

Growlithe and its Hisuian version share candy, so any Growlithe Candy
