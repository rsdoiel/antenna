I buy a domain speculatively, I usually put up some kind of
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/01/16/placeholderScreenshot.png">placeholder
page</a> with a title, picture and tagline. Like
<a href="https://feediverse.org/">feediverse.org</a>. I pushed a link to
it yesterday, and got back this possibly snarky response, but still
thought provoking. Why isn’t there a feed for the feediverse.org page.
Good point! So if you were to put a feed on the home page of the open
feediverse, what it be? A feed of posts to the
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/feediverse.bsky.social">Little Feed
Reader</a> account on Bluesky. I think that might be it. We can
celebrate the day when that feed is mirrored on Bluesky (Inbound RSS
ftw!) and we can shut down the stupid app that does the bridging. We had
a <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">standard</a> long
before Bluesky came along, isn’t it wrong for them to try to force
everyone to use their reinvention? It doesn’t say anything good about
the people who made that choice, among interop-minded developers. It
kind of violates our ethos imho.</p>

To retrieve information from and send commands to the hacked machines,

<p>It is somehow fitting that President Joe Biden’s farewell address to

today by the dramatic announcement that after months of negotiation
backed by the United States and facilitated by Egyptian and Qatari
mediators, negotiators from Israel and Hamas have agreed to a ceasefire
and to exchange Israeli hostages taken on October 7, 2023, for hundreds
of Palestinian prisoners.</p>

<code>top</code> (pictured <em>below</em>… above is
<a href="#btop">btop</a>) is the first utility everyone recommends to
monitor Linux (or any form of UNIX, including macOS) resource usage.
It’s efficient, available almost everywhere… but it’s also a bit basic.
It shows essential metrics, but looks like it’s from the 80s. There are
ways to brighten it up, like highlighting active processes or changing
color schemes, but it’s not the only game in town!
</p>
<p>

<p>
Nowadays, there are a <em>lot</em> of modern monitoring tools—and some
not so modern, but immensely useful—to choose from. This blog post will
run through some of the ones I rely on most often. Let me know in the
comments if you use any others I didn’t cover!

<h2 id="making-this-less-annoying">Making “this” less annoying</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-15, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
Now that I have a job where I’m writing web components full time, I see
the <code>this</code> keyword more than I ever have in my whole life.
It’s not a problem, per se, but you can see how it’s a little
repetitive. I started wondering what my options were to fix this minor
annoyance and the ShopTalk Discord helped me find a simple way and an
over-the-top way to fix my issue.
</p>
<h2>
Simple way: Overriding VS Code theme color tokens
</h2>
<p>
By default my Github Light theme makes <code>this</code> a bold dark
blue color. I didn’t want to roll my own theme though to scratch this
niche itch, so I dug in and found out you can override single tokens in
VS Code. Handy. The documentation is a bit opaque but here’s what you
need to do:
</p>
<div class="language-jsx highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="jsx"><span class="c1">// settings.json</span>
<span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">editor.tokenColorCustomizations</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">textMateRules</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">scope</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">variable.language.this</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">,</span>
      <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">settings</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">foreground</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">#b0b0b0</span><span class="dl">"</span>
      <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="p">]</span>
<span class="p">},</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
Now my <code>this</code> looks like this…
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2025/dimmed.jpg" alt="the keyword this in code set in a light gray, almost illegible font color" />
</p>
<p>
It’s a calming sensation for me to have repetitive noise dimmed. I liked
it so much I dimmed comments to match as well. I may even dim TypeScript
because sometimes I wish I could hide the syntax, but keep the
squiggles.
</p>
<h2>
Over the top way: Replace <code>this</code> with a custom glyph
</h2>
<p>
Changing colors is cool… but what if you could go one step further and
replace <code>this</code> with an icon? What would an icon for
<code>this</code> even look like?
</p>
<p>
I asked the ShopTalk Discord and got some interesting ideas like the
“☝️” emoji, which I think is funny in an “I’m with stupid” t-shirt sort
of way. <a href="https://andrewwalpole.com/">Andrew Walpole</a> took it
to the next level and
<a href="https://www.redbubble.com/i/sticker/This-Logo-Yellow-by-walpolea/162159874.EJUG5">designed
a custom glyph</a>:
</p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2025/this.png" alt="the letter of the word this arranged in a diamond pattern" width="150" height="152">
<p>
<a href="https://www.alanwsmith.com/">Alan Smith</a> then figured out
<a href="https://youtu.be/x1heJdtQapI">how to use Glyphs Mini to add a
custom ligature to an open source coding font</a>. Andrew riffed on
Alan’s work and exported a custom version of Fira Code with his custom
glyph as a ligature. The last step was to install the font update my VS
Code settings:
</p>
<div class="language-jsx highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="jsx">  <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">editor.fontFamily</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">'Fira Code Ligged', monospace</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">editor.fontLigatures</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kc">true</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
Now my code looks incredibly futuristic…
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2025/glyph.jpg" alt="the this glyph replacing instances of the glyph keyword in code" />
</p>
<p>
Abusing typefaces to remove the repetitiveness of programming languages
is fun. After seeing the icon <em>in situ</em>, the idea might be a
smidge too wild for me due to reduced legibility. While I don’t use the
custom glyph on the daily, this experiment does spark a deep desire in
me to create a bunch of custom glyphs for common keywords so I can make
JavaScript an entirely rune-based programming language.
</p>
<h2>
Custom ligatures with CSS?
</h2>
<p>
A wild idea, but it would be neat if you could create your own custom
ligatures in CSS to avoid the need to re-bake custom fonts each time you
have a niche typographic need. Here’s a pseudo-syntax of how that might
work:
</p>
<div class="language-css highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="css"><span class="k">@font-face</span> <span class="s1">"Dave Hijinks"</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="py">match</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">"this."</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="py">replace</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">"☝️."</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="k">@font-face</span> <span class="s1">"Cloud2Butts"</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="py">match</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">"cloud"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">"AI"</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="py">replace</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">"butt"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="sx">url(fart.svg)</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nt">body</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="py">font-face</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">"Dave Hijinks"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">"Cloud2Butt"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">sans-serif</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
Anyways, it’s a thought. Not a serious proposal. This was a fun rabbit
hole to travel down with some friends.

<p>A new season of CrazyStupidTech has begun, with my co-writer Fred
Vogelstein turning his attention to a new company from one of the
fathers of modern artificial intelligence.  Generative AI has dominated
recent discourse, but the impact of artificial intelligence
extends far beyond consumer applications. Take Inceptive, for
example. The startup, co-founded by Jakob Uszkoreit (co-author of the
seminal Transformer paper) and Stanford biochemist Rhiju Das, marries AI
and biology to create “biological software.” It is …</p>

<h2 id="an-internet-of-ideas">An internet of ideas</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-14, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I used to use Twitter for middle of the night ideas. These days I use
one of Twitter’s successors.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lfowjw3z6k2d">Here’s
one</a>. “We should be able to tweet from within any application that
has the ability to create and edit text, and not just in tiny little
text boxes.”
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lfowjw4jrs2d">And
another</a>. “The limits imposed by twitter initially in 2006 resulted
in there being room for only very simple ideas.
</p>
<p>
Self-contained isolated silos make progress impossible. We need an
internet of ideas. Why should we depend on one small vulnerable company
to handle all our internet publishing? It’s an old outdated idea. Look
where our investment in Twitter left us, nomads searching for a new
home, and what did we do, we went for basically the same deal as before.
Oy.
</p>
<p>
Re silos, are you watching the Apple TV+ series
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silo_(TV_series)">Silo</a>? I
don’t want to spoil it, but their idea of a silo is more less exactly
what we’re talking about with the silos or semi-silos of the
twitter-like era. They know being a silo is not popular so they do
little things to give you reason to believe they might not be a silo.
But being a partial silo is like being partially pregnant. No such
thing. If you’re federated that means you peer with your competitors.
Facebook, or whatever you call Mark Xuckerberg’s company these days,
just
<a href="https://www.404media.co/meta-is-blocking-links-to-decentralized-instagram-competitor-pixelfed/">cut
off</a> an Instagram competitor and completely gave away that federation
is a very conditional thing for them, even if a user of Instagram might
also want to hook into flow from
<a href="https://pixelfed.org/">Pixelfed</a>. I never believed in their
support of the fediverse. Now let’s get some reality into these
discussions.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lfoxxs7gy22x">On
Unix</a>. “Learning Unix was when I learned that computer networks could
be simple yet infinitely powerful. Before that for me it was just an
inkling, a hunch. Reading the source code I wanted to make software that
works like that. I hope I have, to some extent.”
</p>
<p>
On <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Mullenweg">Matt
Mullenweg</a>, who surprisingly has become a polarizing figure in the
tech world. Who could’ve seen that coming? Not me.
“<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lfoxsh7nd22x">Radical
idea</a>. Matt Mullenweg doesn’t like how things are going. He has every
right to try to change it, to make it right. As do you, and I.” I don’t
like that people have called him things like the Mad King. People used
to say stuff like that about me. It’s a substitute for trying to
understand where someone is coming from. One of the things I learned
about creating open technology is you attract people who don’t
contribute anything but expect you to work for them, for you to take
orders from them. That is really what it comes down to, and it’s crazy.
If you feel strongly about something, either learn how to program, or
make your freaking case with some humility, or offer a bounty, or just
trust the universe. But giving people orders, there’s no place for that.
Matt could be right or wrong, or he could be right for himself. But he
has the right to control his own destiny, as you and I do, to the extent
that we can.
</p>
<p>
I have my own vision for WordPress, as I’ve started to talk about here
and Murphy-willing you should see more of that in the coming weeks. If
you want a clue, listen to my
<a href="https://shownotes.scripting.com/scripting/2025/01/08/howIViewWordpress.html">podcast</a>
from January 8, and then if you have questions,
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/316">ask
them here</a>. I think it’s a better bet that WordPress will be the
backbone of the social web than any of the other candidates. I wouldn’t
mind being wrong, as long as we can peer with the eventual winner. I
can’t endorse a silo, even on the hope that it will be de-silo’d. I also
don’t believe in the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_fairy">Tooth Fairy</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Mullenweg">Glinda</a> the
good witch of the south.

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2020/11/15/fatladysinging.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">One
more thing. In the middle of the night the Department of Justice
released
<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25486139-report-of-special-counsel-smith-volume-1-january-2025/">half
of the report</a> on their case against president-elect Trump, a much
anticipated bit of news. I didn’t know it had been released, but when I
woke up, and made the usual rounds, I checked in on Bluesky, Threads,
Mastodon, Facebook and then finally Twitter, in that order. Guess where
I discovered this news. Twitter. So when you think people move when they
don’t like what Musk does, or they find that Twitter is as polluted as
some of the celebs do, understand this – most people aren’t affected by
the noise. I don’t see it unless I go look for it. Perhaps this is
because I’ve been very liberal with blocking abusers, or more likely I
don’t have <a href="https://x.com/davewiner">enough followers</a> to be
an attractive target for the abusers, who behave like spammers. They
post where the flow is, and my account isn’t as attractive as (for
example) Paul Krugman, Mark Cuban or Jay Rosen. It takes a lot to get
people to move, and I suspect most people never will. If you operate a
gasoline powered car, I bet you buy a lot of Exxon gas, even if you
don’t see their logo when you fill up. It’s very hard to get away from
companies who hurt our species, by design, unfortunately.

So from the beginning I put password protection on my gateway. This had
been done in such a way that even if UK users telephoned directly into
the communications computer provided by Darpa in UCL, they would require
a password.

<p>
In fact this was the first password on Arpanet. It proved invaluable in
satisfying authorities on both sides of the Atlantic for the 15 years I
ran the service ­ during which no security breach occurred over my link.
I also put in place a system of governance that any UK users had to be
approved by a committee which I chaired but which also had UK government
and British Post Office representation…

<p>date: 2025-01-14, from: Daniel Stenberg Blog</p>
<p>In May 2024 we finally decided that maybe the time has come for curl
to drop support of older TLS libraries. Libraries that because they
don’t support the modern TLS version (1.3) for many users are maybe not
suitable to build upon for the future. We gave the world 12 months to
adapt or to …

and am not getting from AI technology</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-13, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
There’s a funny contradiction in the AI world.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
News orgs, published authors, great artists, universities, want to
retain ownership of their intellectual property and don’t trust the
utility of AI chatbots. They think the only application of AI technology
is to steal from them, to cheat at school and in work. They see AI
technology as destructive, immoral and dishonest.
</li>
<li>
As a writer, of prose and software, I want to use the new tools to
analyze and develop my work. I want ChatGpt to help port my biggest
piece of software from Mac to Linux where it will work far better, far
into the future. I want it to reassemble my 30+ years of every day
writing into something that can be read by anyone in a few days. I want
it to organize new writing projects in ways I can’t. I want it to help
me learn about myself. I would gladly give it access to all my creative
work, if only there were a relatively easy way to do it. Rather than
demanding money, I would gladly pay thousands of dollars to have it all
absorbed into its models so I can study and learn.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Two very different approaches to the same technology.

Microsoft is accusing three individuals of running a

harmful and illicit content using the company’s platform for
AI-generated content.

The foreign-based defendants developed tools specifically designed to
bypass safety guardrails Microsoft has erected to prevent the creation
of harmful content through its generative AI services,

It’s that time of the year again. How to get back disk space?
</p>
<p>
Open the Files application and empty the trash. (How to do this from the
command line?)
</p>
<p>
Delete the cache for Debian packages:
</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get clean
</code></pre>
<p>
Check out local caches:
</p>
<pre><code>ncdu .cache/
</code></pre>
<p>
Python stuff:
</p>
<pre><code>pip cache purge
</code></pre>
<p>
Also, feel free to delete other stuff in there. I just deleted a
“whisper” directory containing a language model I didn’t need and a
“tracker3” directory containing data for the Gnome miner, I think. Also
“chromium” because it’s not my main browser. I don’t care about its
cache.
</p>
<p>
Perlbrew stuff. Find out what Perls you have installed.
</p>
<pre><code>perlbrew list
</code></pre>
<p>
You aren’t going to need them:
</p>
<pre><code>perlbrew uninstall perl-5.30.0
perlbrew uninstall perl-5.32.0
</code></pre>
<p>
Go build cache:
</p>

Finished “Chained Echoes” yesterday, after 45 hours, off and on since
August! It took some time to grow on me, but I loved the game in the end
– what a fun twists-and-turnsy storyline 😄 I wrote up some further
thoughts

The basic definition of terrorism is “violence designed to create terror
in a civilian population to achieve a political aim”. Clearly, not only
are states <em>capable</em> of carrying out terrorism, they are by far
the primary perpetrators of terrorism in the world. But the UN, being
made up of nation-states, has always resisted having a definition of
terrorism that acknowledged that, instead including clauses like “…by
non-nation-state actors”. In this way, for example, Israel is “not a
terrorist state”, while the Palestinians defending themselves
<em>are</em> terrorists…
</p>
<p>
And then we reach the modern era, where acts not designed to instill
terror in a civilian population at all, like the United Healthcare
shooting, get branded as “terrorism”. Like, according to the ruling
class, it’s now just terrorism if the ruling class is afraid. No naked
self-interest in that at all 🙄
