<h2 id="an-internet-of-ideas">An internet of ideas</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-14, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I used to use Twitter for middle of the night ideas. These days I use
one of Twitter’s successors.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lfowjw3z6k2d">Here’s
one</a>. “We should be able to tweet from within any application that
has the ability to create and edit text, and not just in tiny little
text boxes.”
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lfowjw4jrs2d">And
another</a>. “The limits imposed by twitter initially in 2006 resulted
in there being room for only very simple ideas.
</p>
<p>
Self-contained isolated silos make progress impossible. We need an
internet of ideas. Why should we depend on one small vulnerable company
to handle all our internet publishing? It’s an old outdated idea. Look
where our investment in Twitter left us, nomads searching for a new
home, and what did we do, we went for basically the same deal as before.
Oy.
</p>
<p>
Re silos, are you watching the Apple TV+ series
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silo_(TV_series)">Silo</a>? I
don’t want to spoil it, but their idea of a silo is more less exactly
what we’re talking about with the silos or semi-silos of the
twitter-like era. They know being a silo is not popular so they do
little things to give you reason to believe they might not be a silo.
But being a partial silo is like being partially pregnant. No such
thing. If you’re federated that means you peer with your competitors.
Facebook, or whatever you call Mark Xuckerberg’s company these days,
just
<a href="https://www.404media.co/meta-is-blocking-links-to-decentralized-instagram-competitor-pixelfed/">cut
off</a> an Instagram competitor and completely gave away that federation
is a very conditional thing for them, even if a user of Instagram might
also want to hook into flow from
<a href="https://pixelfed.org/">Pixelfed</a>. I never believed in their
support of the fediverse. Now let’s get some reality into these
discussions.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lfoxxs7gy22x">On
Unix</a>. “Learning Unix was when I learned that computer networks could
be simple yet infinitely powerful. Before that for me it was just an
inkling, a hunch. Reading the source code I wanted to make software that
works like that. I hope I have, to some extent.”
</p>
<p>
On <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Mullenweg">Matt
Mullenweg</a>, who surprisingly has become a polarizing figure in the
tech world. Who could’ve seen that coming? Not me.
“<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lfoxsh7nd22x">Radical
idea</a>. Matt Mullenweg doesn’t like how things are going. He has every
right to try to change it, to make it right. As do you, and I.” I don’t
like that people have called him things like the Mad King. People used
to say stuff like that about me. It’s a substitute for trying to
understand where someone is coming from. One of the things I learned
about creating open technology is you attract people who don’t
contribute anything but expect you to work for them, for you to take
orders from them. That is really what it comes down to, and it’s crazy.
If you feel strongly about something, either learn how to program, or
make your freaking case with some humility, or offer a bounty, or just
trust the universe. But giving people orders, there’s no place for that.
Matt could be right or wrong, or he could be right for himself. But he
has the right to control his own destiny, as you and I do, to the extent
that we can.
</p>
<p>
I have my own vision for WordPress, as I’ve started to talk about here
and Murphy-willing you should see more of that in the coming weeks. If
you want a clue, listen to my
<a href="https://shownotes.scripting.com/scripting/2025/01/08/howIViewWordpress.html">podcast</a>
from January 8, and then if you have questions,
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/316">ask
them here</a>. I think it’s a better bet that WordPress will be the
backbone of the social web than any of the other candidates. I wouldn’t
mind being wrong, as long as we can peer with the eventual winner. I
can’t endorse a silo, even on the hope that it will be de-silo’d. I also
don’t believe in the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_fairy">Tooth Fairy</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Mullenweg">Glinda</a> the
good witch of the south.
</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2020/11/15/fatladysinging.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">One
more thing. In the middle of the night the Department of Justice
released
<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25486139-report-of-special-counsel-smith-volume-1-january-2025/">half
of the report</a> on their case against president-elect Trump, a much
anticipated bit of news. I didn’t know it had been released, but when I
woke up, and made the usual rounds, I checked in on Bluesky, Threads,
Mastodon, Facebook and then finally Twitter, in that order. Guess where
I discovered this news. Twitter. So when you think people move when they
don’t like what Musk does, or they find that Twitter is as polluted as
some of the celebs do, understand this – most people aren’t affected by
the noise. I don’t see it unless I go look for it. Perhaps this is
because I’ve been very liberal with blocking abusers, or more likely I
don’t have <a href="https://x.com/davewiner">enough followers</a> to be
an attractive target for the abusers, who behave like spammers. They
post where the flow is, and my account isn’t as attractive as (for
example) Paul Krugman, Mark Cuban or Jay Rosen. It takes a lot to get
people to move, and I suspect most people never will. If you operate a
gasoline powered car, I bet you buy a lot of Exxon gas, even if you
don’t see their logo when you fill up. It’s very hard to get away from
companies who hurt our species, by design, unfortunately.

<p>
So from the beginning I put password protection on my gateway. This had
been done in such a way that even if UK users telephoned directly into
the communications computer provided by Darpa in UCL, they would require
a password.
</p>
<p>
In fact this was the first password on Arpanet. It proved invaluable in
satisfying authorities on both sides of the Atlantic for the 15 years I
ran the service ­ during which no security breach occurred over my link.
I also put in place a system of governance that any UK users had to be
approved by a committee which I chaired but which also had UK government
and British Post Office representation…

and am not getting from AI technology</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-13, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
There’s a funny contradiction in the AI world.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
News orgs, published authors, great artists, universities, want to
retain ownership of their intellectual property and don’t trust the
utility of AI chatbots. They think the only application of AI technology
is to steal from them, to cheat at school and in work. They see AI
technology as destructive, immoral and dishonest.
</li>
<li>
As a writer, of prose and software, I want to use the new tools to
analyze and develop my work. I want ChatGpt to help port my biggest
piece of software from Mac to Linux where it will work far better, far
into the future. I want it to reassemble my 30+ years of every day
writing into something that can be read by anyone in a few days. I want
it to organize new writing projects in ways I can’t. I want it to help
me learn about myself. I would gladly give it access to all my creative
work, if only there were a relatively easy way to do it. Rather than
demanding money, I would gladly pay thousands of dollars to have it all
absorbed into its models so I can study and learn.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Two very different approaches to the same technology.

Let me collect some function definitions on this page. I’ll be adding
more over the years to come, for sure.

maybe I should write a blog post about that.)This is that post.  I’m
writing it not as a lament, but rather because I’ve ended up in a good

about everything I’ve ever tried.  If my younger self had heard these

<p>
It’s that time of the year again. How to get back disk space?
</p>
<p>
Open the Files application and empty the trash. (How to do this from the
command line?)
</p>
<p>
Delete the cache for Debian packages:
</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get clean
</code></pre>
<p>
Check out local caches:
</p>
<pre><code>ncdu .cache/
</code></pre>
<p>
Python stuff:
</p>
<pre><code>pip cache purge
</code></pre>
<p>
Also, feel free to delete other stuff in there. I just deleted a
“whisper” directory containing a language model I didn’t need and a
“tracker3” directory containing data for the Gnome miner, I think. Also
“chromium” because it’s not my main browser. I don’t care about its
cache.
</p>
<p>
Perlbrew stuff. Find out what Perls you have installed.
</p>
<pre><code>perlbrew list
</code></pre>
<p>
You aren’t going to need them:
</p>
<pre><code>perlbrew uninstall perl-5.30.0
perlbrew uninstall perl-5.32.0
</code></pre>
<p>
Go build cache:
</p>
<pre><code>go clean -cache
</code></pre>

<p>In 2024 I was lucky to enjoy a wide variety of great coffees from

Valencia, and other cities. This is a compilation of many of the coffees
I got to taste.</p>

This is one of the dialogs you encounter when getting started with
Bluesky. It’s easy to see how new users might be led believe that
Bluesky is federated, as Mastodon is. I’m a developer and I was confused

<p>
The basic definition of terrorism is “violence designed to create terror
in a civilian population to achieve a political aim”. Clearly, not only
are states <em>capable</em> of carrying out terrorism, they are by far
the primary perpetrators of terrorism in the world. But the UN, being
made up of nation-states, has always resisted having a definition of
terrorism that acknowledged that, instead including clauses like “…by
non-nation-state actors”. In this way, for example, Israel is “not a
terrorist state”, while the Palestinians defending themselves
<em>are</em> terrorists…
</p>
<p>
And then we reach the modern era, where acts not designed to instill
terror in a civilian population at all, like the United Healthcare
shooting, get branded as “terrorism”. Like, according to the ruling
class, it’s now just terrorism if the ruling class is afraid. No naked
self-interest in that at all 🙄
