Mesoscale Discussion 1541
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0342 PM CDT Wed Jul 02 2025

Areas affected...southern/central MT

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 022042Z - 022215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Erratic and isolated severe gusts will remain possible
across a broad portion of southern to central Montana over the next
few hours. Whether sufficient coverage/organization potential will
exist for a Severe Thunderstorm Watch is uncertain.

DISCUSSION...Isolated thunderstorms have been gradually increasing
across the higher terrain of southwest/south-central MT. Despite
meager buoyancy and modest deep-layer shear, one initial cell
produced a measured severe gust of 64 kts at KDLN. This activity is
expected to spread northward, mainly across the central portion of
MT, into early evening where the downstream airmass is slightly more
unstable. With 40-50 F surface temperature-dew point spreads,
sporadic severe gusts are the expected hazard. Coverage of both
convection and organizational potential is uncertain. Short-term
guidance suggest severe gust potential may remain erratic with
relatively disorganized convection. It is possible that a loosely
organized cluster might evolve to the north-northeast at some point
during the early evening, which would raise the potential of
downstream watch issuance.

Mesoscale Discussion 1540
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0328 PM CDT Wed Jul 02 2025

Areas affected...portions of northeast Wisconsin and the UP/LP of
Michigan

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 022028Z - 022200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated severe winds gusts/hail possible this
afternoon/evening.

DISCUSSION...Visible satellite/radar shows a small cluster of cells
over portions of northeast Wisconsin, and a few isolated cells over
the LP of Michigan, traversing southeast. These storms initiated
during the heating of the day amid a weakly capped environment.
Persistent downstream heating, where dew point temperatures are in
the low 60s F, is yielding MLCAPE values near 1000 J/kg and low
level lapse rates near 9 C/km. The weak instability combined with
marginal deep-layer shear (approaching 25-35 kt) should limit storm
organization. That said, some potential exists for a localized
damaging wind gust or severe hail with the strongest cells
throughout the remainder of the afternoon and into the evening.

Hurricane Flossie Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062025
200 PM MST Wed Jul 02 2025

Flossie is feeling the effects of decreasing sea surface 
temperatures, with the associated convection waning and becoming 
asymmetric.  The latest subjective satellite intensity estimates 
indicate weakening, and recent objective satellite estimates are in 
the 80-90 kt range.  Based on this, the initial intensity is 
decreased to a possibly generous 85 kt.  The initial wind radii have 
been revised based on a 1638Z ASCAT overpass.
 
The initial motion is 305/8 kt.  Flossie is moving toward a break 
in the subtropical ridge caused by a mid- to upper-level trough 
over California and the adjacent Pacific. A general northwestward 
motion should continue for the next couple of days. After that, 
Flossie should lose vertical depth as it weakens, with the remnant 
low being steered more toward the west-northwest by the mean 
low-level flow. The new forecast track is almost identical to the 
previous track and lies near the various consensus models.

Steady to rapid weakening is forecast to continue as Flossie moves 
over cooler water and into a drier air mass. The cyclone is 
predicted to become post-tropical in about 36 h as it stops 
producing convection, and it is expected to decay to a remnant low 
thereafter.  The system is forecast to dissipate completely by    
96 h, and this could happen earlier than currently forecast.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0258 PM CDT Wed Jul 02 2025

Valid 031200Z - 041200Z

...Northern Great Basin and Western Nevada...
An approaching short wave trough and stronger mid-level flow will
support shower and thunderstorm development across northeastern CA
into southeastern OR Thursday. Faster northeast thunderstorm
trajectories will limit precipitation amounts supporting an isolated
dry thunderstorm threat. A corridor of daytime instability and
precipitable water values of 0.5 to 0.7 inches will bring an
isolated dry thunderstorm threat to the higher terrain of far
northern NV, northern UT as well as far southeastern ID. The
incoming trough will also promote stronger downslope flow east of
the Sierra Crest across northwestern NV. Enhanced downslope winds
from the west of 15-20 mph and relative humidity of around 15%
supports continuation elevated fire weather highlights.

...Western Slope and Eastern Utah... 
A broad plume of monsoon moisture over the region along with daytime
heating will promote a mix of wet and dry thunderstorms over higher
terrain of the Western Slope as well as eastern UT. Some lightning
ignitions are possible within remaining pockets of receptive fuels.

..Williams.. 07/02/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0227 AM CDT Wed Jul 02 2025/

...Synopsis...
Broad troughing over the western US will continue as a compact
shortwave trough moves across northern CA Thursday. 40-50 kt
westerly flow will overspread the northern Great Basin. This will
encourage dry downslope flow across parts of western NV. At the same
time, continued monsoon moisture will allow widespread showers and
thunderstorms over the Intermountain West.

...Northwest Great Basin...
Continued westerly flow aloft will overspread the northern Great
Basin Thursday afternoon. Dry downslope winds of 15-25 mph are
expected, aided by the increasing winds aloft. Very warm
temperatures, and the dry downslope trajectories, will support
widespread RH values below 15%. The increase in surface winds amid a
warm and dry boundary layer and dry fuels will support elevated
wildfire spread potential Thursday.

...Western Slope...
Another day of widespread showers and thunderstorms is expected
across the eastern Great Basin and western Rockies Thursday. A
continued surge of robust monsoon moisture (PWATS above 0.8 inches)
will support a mixed mode of wet and occasionally dry storms.
Widespread QPF of 0.1-0.25 inches in the preceding days suggest area
fuels are likely to become less receptive to lightning ignitions
with time. However, the coverage of storms does support at least
isolated potential for dry strikes in receptive fuels across western
CO/WY into eastern UT.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER NORTH CENTRAL
MONTANA...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorm gusts are possible across Montana this
afternoon into the evening.  Isolated severe thunderstorms may occur
today across parts of the Great Basin and Upper Midwest/Great Lakes.

...20z Update...
There are no changes are needed to the D1 Convective Outlook. See
previous discussion below for more information.

..Thornton.. 07/02/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1132 AM CDT Wed Jul 02 2025/

...Northern Rockies into the Northern High Plains...
Recent satellite imagery shows expansive upper ridging extending
from the southern Plains into central AB/SK. An upper low is slowly
drifting eastward into southern CA, impinging on the western
periphery of this upper ridging. This upper low is forecast to stay
well south of the region throughout the day, but a modest vorticity
maximum, generated by convection east of this upper low, is forecast
to move into the northern Rockies this afternoon. Ascent associated
with this vorticity max coupled with orographic ascent, and perhaps
additional large-scale ascent ahead of weak shortwave trough moving
across OR, is expected to result in thunderstorms over the high
terrain as the airmass diurnally destabilizes this afternoon.
Persistent southwesterly flow aloft will then take these storms
north/northeastward into more of the MT High Plains. Highest storm
coverage is expected from central ID into western MT during the
afternoon, before transition to more of central MT this evening.
Vertical shear is strong enough for occasionally organized storm
structures. The high cloud bases and steep low-level lapse rates
will contribute to the potential for strong to severe wind gusts,
particularly across central MT as storms become outflow dominant.

...Western Great Basin...
Increasing thunderstorm coverage is anticipated this afternoon and
evening east of a slow-moving upper low currently moving into
central/southern CA. Moderate mid-level flow through the eastern
periphery of the upper low combined with modest buoyancy and high
LCLs will result in an environment favorable to isolated to
scattered strong to severe wind gusts. Highest overall thunderstorm
coverage and relatively greater chance for strong/severe gusts is
over southern NV.

...AZ...
12Z PHX sounding sampled a precipitable water of 1.4" this morning
and the expectation is that this moisture will support the
development of numerous thunderstorms across the region this
afternoon/evening. Development is anticipated over the higher
terrain first, before then slowly moving westward toward lower
elevations. This overall pattern generally favors strong to severe
gusts across central AZ. However, very weak mid-level flow suggests
the westward push off the terrain will be slow, if it occurs at all,
which should limit the overall severe potential.

...Upper Midwest/Great Lakes...
A weak cold front is forecast to move into northern MN, northern WI,
Upper MI this afternoon. Thunderstorms are anticipated along this
front as it interacts with the modest buoyancy (i.e. MLCAPE around
1000 J/kg) over this region. Isolated pre-frontal storms are
possible across Lower MI as well. Moderate mid-level flow will
support the potential for damaging gusts with any of the stronger
storms. 

Additional thunderstorms are possible later this evening farther
west from far southeast SD into southern MN and northern IA. There
is some chance development occurs along the front during the
afternoon, but low-level convergence will likely be too weak to
overcome the convective inhibition. Later, isolated coverage appears
more likely as warm-air advection, supported by modest low-level
jet, increases. Given the expected combination of buoyancy and
vertical shear, one or two more organized storms capable of large
hail are possible.  

...Eastern NC...
Weak upper troughing and attendant surface cold front will advance
eastward today across the southern Mid-Atlantic and Carolinas.
Widespread thunderstorm development is anticipated ahead of these
features. However, poor lapse rates aloft will likely limit updraft
strength, with deep-layer shear limiting storm organization as well.
A few water-loaded downbursts are possible within the strongest
storms.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ON FRIDAY OVER
PARTS OF THE EASTERN DAKOTAS AND UPPER MIDWEST...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong to severe thunderstorms are expected across
portions of the northern Plains and Upper Midwest on Friday.

...Dakotas and Upper Midwest...
The band of primary westerly flow will be relegated to the northern
tier of states on Friday, with a pronounced shortwave trough moving
across southern SK/MT and into the northern Plains.  Models are in
general consensus that scattered afternoon thunderstorms will
develop along the associated cold front over the eastern Dakotas. 
Relatively warm/moist and unstable conditions ahead of the front,
coupled with favorable westerly flow aloft, will promote a risk of
severe storms capable of damaging winds and some hail.  There remain
differences between the various 12z model solutions regarding timing
and intensity of the approaching trough.  This lends sufficient
uncertainty to the corridor of greatest concern to maintain only
MRGL risk at this time.  However, parts of the area will likely need
upgraded in later outlooks as details become clearer.

...ID/MT...
A strong shortwave trough will track into the western states on
Friday, promoting scattered afternoon thunderstorm development over
parts of the northern Great Basin and northern Rockies.  There is
some concern for a few storms capable of damaging winds and hail
over the region Friday evening, but model solutions remain to
diverse to add a risk area at this time.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THURSDAY AFTERNOON
AND EVENING OVER PORTIONS OF THE NORTHEAST US...AND OVER PARTS OF
NORTH DAKOTA....

...SUMMARY...
Scattered storms capable of severe wind gusts and hail are forecast
across the Northeast US and North Dakota on Thursday.

...Northeast...
A shortwave trough currently over western Ontario will track
southeastward across the Great Lakes on Thursday.  Increasing large
scale forcing will overspread parts of PA/NY and New England through
the day, promoting afternoon thunderstorm development along an
approaching cold front.  A warm/humid air mass will be present ahead
of the front, with steep low-level lapse rates and sufficient CAPE
to pose a risk of damaging wind gusts and perhaps some hail.  Given
trends in 12z model guidance regarding thunderstorm coverage, have
added a SLGT risk for portions of the region.

...ND...
A prominent mid-level ridge will be established over the central US
tomorrow.  Model guidance suggests a subtle shortwave trough will
track into eastern MT during the afternoon and top the ridge
overnight.  Southerly low-level winds will help to draw moisture
northward into ND by late afternoon, resulting in a reservoir of
strong instability.  Thunderstorms are expected to develop over
western ND posing a risk of large hail and damaging winds.  Several
12z HREF members suggest the risk of upscale growth and a bowing MCS
tracking eastward across ND overnight.

...Upper MS Valley...
A weak/diffuse low-level baroclinic zone will extend from southeast
MN into IL on Thursday.  Strengthening southwesterly low-level winds
will enhance warm advection by early evening, leading to scattered
thunderstorms.  A few of these storms could be strong, posing a risk
of gusty winds and hail.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1153 AM CDT Wed Jul 02 2025

Valid 021700Z - 031200Z

...Nevada...
Anomalously high precipitable water values, including observed an
observed value of nearly 1 inch from the 1200Z Las Vegas sounding,
suggests higher precipitation efficiency from expected showers and
thunderstorms moving into southern Nevada today. This will limit dry
lightning ignition efficiency across southern Nevada. A relatively
dry sub-cloud layer remains in place across central and northern
Nevada, where initially high-based shower and thunderstorm
development is expected through the day, increasing potential for
ignition over dry fuels denoted by a general northward shift in
Isolated Dry Thunderstorm highlights.

...Far Northeastern California into southeastern Oregon...
Stronger mid-level winds and accelerated northeast thunderstorm
motions owing to an encroaching mid-level trough into the Pacific
Northwest will limit precipitation and increase ignition likelihood
amid drier fuels across northeastern California into southeastern
Oregon this afternoon. Isolated Dry Thunderstorm highlights were
added to reflect this threat for today.

..Williams.. 07/02/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0225 AM CDT Wed Jul 02 2025/

...Synopsis...
Mid-level troughing is forecast to slowly progress across central CA
today, while another trough moves onshore across WA. Decreasing
heights over the Northwest will continue to provide southerly
transport of monsoon moisture into portions of the Great Basin and
Intermountain West, where numerous thunderstorms are likely. Dry and
breezy conditions will also be likely over the Cascades and western
Columbia Basin.

...Lee of the Cascades...
Increasing flow aloft ahead of the Pacific trough will favor dry
downslope winds across the Cascades and western Columbia Basin. With
daytime temperatures well into the 90s F, deep mixing will promote
low boundary layer RH of 15-20%. With downslope winds of 15-25 mph,
widespread elevated fire-weather conditions are likely on the lee
slopes and through the gaps of the higher terrain. Some localized
critical conditions are also possible where the terrain-enhanced
winds and locally drier conditions may develop for a few hours this
afternoon.

...Great Basin and northern Rockies Dry Thunder...
East of the upper low, widespread thunderstorm activity is expected
across the Great Basin and western slopes of the Rockies. A monsoon
surge of 0.8 to 1.0 inch PWATs will lift northward across
central/eastern NV into UT and western CO/WY. Weak ascent from the
trough, along with diurnal heating of the terrain will result in
scattered to numerous high-based showers and thunderstorms by early
afternoon. Additional storms are likely along a cold front across ID
and western MT. Given the increasing moisture content and continued
southerly flow, some wetting rainfall is expected from training
rounds of thunderstorms.  A mix of wet and dry thunderstorms will
support potential lightning ignitions, particularly with fast moving
cells and on the edges of the most intense downdraft cores. This
appears most likely across parts of eastern UT and western CO where
less wetting rainfall is expected. Though isolated dry strikes are
possible over the entire IsoDryT area.

...Northern OR/Southern CA...
Scattered thunderstorms are again expected ahead of the upper low. A
few of these storms may be drier with 30+ kt of southerly flow and
relatively deeply mixed boundary layers. While a few dry strikes are
possible outside of the heavier cores, recent QPE estimates of 0.5
to 1 inches indicate area fuels have likely been tempered to some
degree. This suggests the threat for dry lightning is below IsoDryT
thresholds.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1132 AM CDT Wed Jul 02 2025

Valid 021630Z - 031200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER NORTH-CENTRAL
MONTANA...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorm gusts are possible across Montana this
afternoon into the evening.  Isolated severe thunderstorms may occur
today across parts of the Great Basin and Upper Midwest/Great Lakes.

...Northern Rockies into the Northern High Plains...
Recent satellite imagery shows expansive upper ridging extending
from the southern Plains into central AB/SK. An upper low is slowly
drifting eastward into southern CA, impinging on the western
periphery of this upper ridging. This upper low is forecast to stay
well south of the region throughout the day, but a modest vorticity
maximum, generated by convection east of this upper low, is forecast
to move into the northern Rockies this afternoon. Ascent associated
with this vorticity max coupled with orographic ascent, and perhaps
additional large-scale ascent ahead of weak shortwave trough moving
across OR, is expected to result in thunderstorms over the high
terrain as the airmass diurnally destabilizes this afternoon.
Persistent southwesterly flow aloft will then take these storms
north/northeastward into more of the MT High Plains. Highest storm
coverage is expected from central ID into western MT during the
afternoon, before transition to more of central MT this evening.
Vertical shear is strong enough for occasionally organized storm
structures. The high cloud bases and steep low-level lapse rates
will contribute to the potential for strong to severe wind gusts,
particularly across central MT as storms become outflow dominant.

...Western Great Basin...
Increasing thunderstorm coverage is anticipated this afternoon and
evening east of a slow-moving upper low currently moving into
central/southern CA. Moderate mid-level flow through the eastern
periphery of the upper low combined with modest buoyancy and high
LCLs will result in an environment favorable to isolated to
scattered strong to severe wind gusts. Highest overall thunderstorm
coverage and relatively greater chance for strong/severe gusts is
over southern NV.

...AZ...
12Z PHX sounding sampled a precipitable water of 1.4" this morning
and the expectation is that this moisture will support the
development of numerous thunderstorms across the region this
afternoon/evening. Development is anticipated over the higher
terrain first, before then slowly moving westward toward lower
elevations. This overall pattern generally favors strong to severe
gusts across central AZ. However, very weak mid-level flow suggests
the westward push off the terrain will be slow, if it occurs at all,
which should limit the overall severe potential.

...Upper Midwest/Great Lakes...
A weak cold front is forecast to move into northern MN, northern WI,
Upper MI this afternoon. Thunderstorms are anticipated along this
front as it interacts with the modest buoyancy (i.e. MLCAPE around
1000 J/kg) over this region. Isolated pre-frontal storms are
possible across Lower MI as well. Moderate mid-level flow will
support the potential for damaging gusts with any of the stronger
storms. 

Additional thunderstorms are possible later this evening farther
west from far southeast SD into southern MN and northern IA. There
is some chance development occurs along the front during the
afternoon, but low-level convergence will likely be too weak to
overcome the convective inhibition. Later, isolated coverage appears
more likely as warm-air advection, supported by modest low-level
jet, increases. Given the expected combination of buoyancy and
vertical shear, one or two more organized storms capable of large
hail are possible.  

...Eastern NC...
Weak upper troughing and attendant surface cold front will advance
eastward today across the southern Mid-Atlantic and Carolinas.
Widespread thunderstorm development is anticipated ahead of these
features. However, poor lapse rates aloft will likely limit updraft
strength, with deep-layer shear limiting storm organization as well.
A few water-loaded downbursts are possible within the strongest
storms.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR CENTRAL INTO
NORTHERN PORTIONS OF MONTANA...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorm gusts are possible across Montana this
afternoon into the evening.  Isolated severe thunderstorms may occur
today across parts of the Great Basin and Upper Midwest/Great Lakes.

...Northern Rockies/High Plains...
Water-vapor imagery shows a mid- to upper-level trough/low centered
over CA with downstream upper ridging centered over the
north-central Rockies and adjacent northern High Plains.  Modest
mid- to high-level west-southwesterly 500-250 mb flow (20-50 kt) is
forecast to remain across the northern Rockies and plains per model
data.  Surface observations this morning show 40s to lower 50s deg F
dewpoints over MT.  Strong heating will contribute to weak to
moderate buoyancy over the plains (500-1250 J/kg MLCAPE) and very
steep lapse rates from the surface into the mid levels.  Orographic
ascent will likely lead to isolated to scattered storms developing
by mid afternoon initially over southern MT and other
terrain-favored locales.  This activity is forecast to spread
north/northeast during the late afternoon/evening.  Thunderstorm
coverage will probably increase by the early evening in the form of
a few clusters and perhaps linearly oriented outflow surges. 
Evaporative cooling will facilitate efficient downdrafts and severe
gusts (60-70 mph) with the stronger cores. 

...Great Basin...
Modestly enhanced southerly flow will be present today over parts of
the Great Basin in association with a decaying/weak upper trough/low
over CA and the western Great Basin.  Scattered thunderstorms should
spread northward across these areas this afternoon/evening, with
isolated severe wind gusts possible.

...Upper Midwest/Great Lakes...
As upper ridging builds over the Plains today, a shortwave trough
over Ontario will dig southeastward and provide glancing large-scale
ascent over parts of the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes.  Model
guidance varies considerably on storm coverage, which is likely
related to capping concerns especially with westward extent into the
SD/IA/southwest MN vicinity.  Nonetheless, a seasonably
moist low-level airmass is expected to remain over most of these
regions, and daytime heating will likely aid in the development of
moderate to strong instability along/south of a front. Some
enhancement to the mid/upper-level west-northwesterly flow should
support sufficient deep-layer shear for organized thunderstorms with
an attendant hail/wind risk with the stronger storms.

...Eastern North Carolina...
Weak upper troughing will advance eastward today across the southern
Mid-Atlantic and Carolinas as a surface cold front likewise moves
slowly east-southeastward across these areas. Poor lapse rates aloft
will likely limit updraft strength, and deep-layer shear is also
expected to remain weak. While thunderstorms should develop through
the afternoon along/ahead of the front across eastern NC and
vicinity, the potential for damaging winds continues to appear to be
too limited for low probabilities.

...DISCUSSION...
Some severe weather is possible on Day 5/Sunday and Day6/Monday
across portions of northern Montana and North Dakota as moderate
instability builds into the area with moderate mid-level flow
southeast of a trough across western Canada. The evolution and
timing of this trough remains uncertain and therefore, no severe
weather probabilities will be added at this time.

Beyond this timeframe, moderate to strong instability is forecast
across much of the central and eastern CONUS for much of the
extended forecast period with widespread thunderstorm activity
likely. Despite this storm coverage and instability, organized
severe weather seems unlikely given mostly weak deep-layer
shear/flow.

Hurricane Flossie Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062025
200 AM MST Wed Jul 02 2025
 
Flossie remains an impressive hurricane early this morning, although 
the well-defined eye evident earlier tonight has become less 
distinct and somewhat cloud filled in recent satellite images.  The 
latest subjective Dvorak intensity estimates were T5.5/102 knots 
from TAFB and T5.0/90 knots from SAB. Meanwhile, the objective 
intensity estimates ranged from 96 to 107 knots at 06z.  Based on a 
blend of these data, the initial intensity will be held at 100 knots 
for this advisory. 

Flossie is heading toward the west-northwest or 300/9 knots. This 
general motion is expected to continue during the next several days 
as the cyclone is steered into a weakness in the mid-level ridge to 
the northwest of the system. A turn more to the west is expected 
beyond 48 hours as the increasingly shallow system becomes steered 
by the low-level trade wind flow.  The track forecast has been 
shifted slightly to the left of the previous advisory to align with 
the latest consensus guidance trends, and closely follows a blend of 
the latest GDMI, FSSE and TVCE consensus aids.

The window for additional strengthening appears to be closing 
quickly, as Flossie begins to move over slightly less conducive 
waters for intensification with sea surface temperatures now around 
27C.  Wind shear remains light and mid-level moisture remains high 
during the next 12 hours, so with the system remaining over 
adequately warm water, the intensity should change little.  Flossie 
will move over much cooler water between 12 and 24 hours, and into a 
drier mid-level environment.  This should result in rather rapid 
weakening of the system, with Flossie expected to become a 
post-tropical low by 48 hours, with dissipation following by 96 
hours. The intensity forecast has been adjusted to show a bit faster 
weakening of the system which is in line with the latest intensity 
consensus aids.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Outer bands of Hurricane Flossie continue to bring locally heavy 
rainfall to coastal portions of the Mexican states of Michoacán, 
Colima, and Jalisco into Wednesday. Localized flash flooding is 
possible.
 
2. Large swells generated by Flossie will cause life-threatening 
surf and rip current conditions along portions of the coast of 
southwestern Mexico, and the Baja California peninsula during the
next few days.

center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles
(150 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 962 mb (28.41 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Flossie can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO header
WTPZ41 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Hurricane Flossie should produce additional rainfall
totals of 1 to 2 inches, with isolated maximum totals of 3 inches,
across coastal portions of the Mexican states of Michoacán, Colima,
and Jalisco through today. This rainfall could lead to localized
flash flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Hurricane Flossie, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep1.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF: Swells generated by Flossie will affect portions of the coast

Mesoscale Discussion 1535
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0349 PM CDT Tue Jul 01 2025

Areas affected...southern New England

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 012049Z - 012215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Localized strong gusts producing isolated damaging winds
should persist as storms spread east across southern New England
through sunset.

DISCUSSION...The northern portion of the broad convective swath
across the eastern states has yielded localized strong gusts and
isolated damaging winds, with mainly semi-discrete cells earlier.
Convection has more recently consolidated into clusters and short
linear segments across the Lower Hudson Valley. Outflow from earlier
cells which exited the Mohawk Valley may merge with this slow-moving
leading convection and should support persistence of sporadic strong
gusts eastward. These will be favored where surface temperatures
remain in the upper 80s to low 90s prior to sunset.

Mesoscale Discussion 1534
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0331 PM CDT Tue Jul 01 2025

Areas affected...portions of southeastern Idaho into southwest
Montana

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 012031Z - 012200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated damaging wind gusts possible this
afternoon/evening.

DISCUSSION...Visible satellite/radar shows a few areas of convection
that have developed during peak heating, mostly confined to high
terrain areas. This activity is developing in a relatively dry
boundary layer characterized by dew point temperatures in the 40s F.
Yet, strong heating has yielded strong low-level lapse rates,
exceeding 9 C/km in most areas, and inverted-V profiles. Thus,
strong downdraft winds are likely with any convective elements
throughout the remainder of the afternoon and into the evening as
the activity gradually moves off high terrain areas. However, given
the expectation for somewhat sparse coverage of storms, watch
issuance is unlikely.

Hurricane Flossie Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062025
200 PM MST Tue Jul 01 2025
 
Flossie continues to intensify this afternoon, with deep cold
convection wrapping around the eyewall. GOES satellite visible
imagery shows an eye has been trying to clear out and warm
throughout the day. The latest subjective and objective satellite
intensity estimates are between 90-95 kt. Based on the latest trends
and these estimates, the initial intensity is set to 95 kt for this
advisory.
 
The initial motion is 300/9 kt. A general west-northwest to
northwestward motion is forecast over the next few days as Flossie
moves toward a weakness in the subtropical ridge. As the system
begins to weaken, a more westward motion is anticipated as the storm
is steered by the low-level wind flow. The latest NHC track forecast
track lies near the previous, which is near the HCCA corrected
consensus.
 
Flossie will remain in a favorable environment, with warm SSTs, 
plentiful moisture, and weak wind shear for the next 12-24 hours. 
Along the forecast track the system will be moving into increasingly 
cooler SSTs and drier air in about 24 h. The latest NHC forecast is 
for some additional strengthening in the short term, which is above 
all available guidance. Afterwards, Flossie is expected to rapidly 
weaken, with the system becoming post-tropical by 72 h, and a 
remnant low by 96 h and dissipated by day 5. The latest NHC 
intensity forecast remains at the high end of the guidance in the 
short term, before trending towards the consensus aids as the system 
weakens.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Outer bands of Hurricane Flossie continue to bring locally heavy
rainfall to coastal portions of the Mexican states of Michoacán,
Colima, and Jalisco into Wednesday. Localized flash flooding is
possible.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected in portions of the
tropical storm warning area in southwestern Mexico for the next few
hours.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 481
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1255 PM EDT Tue Jul 1 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  District Of Columbia
  Delaware
  Maryland
  New Jersey
  South-Central and Southeast Pennsylvania
  Northern and Central Virginia
  Eastern West Virginia Panhandle
  Coastal Waters

* Effective this Tuesday afternoon and evening from 1255 PM until
  900 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm coverage is expected to increase across the
region over the next several hours ahead of a shortwave trough and
attendant cold front. The airmass across the region is moist and
unstable, with moderate to strong instability anticipated amid
continued daytime heating. Vertical shear is modest, with a
predominantly outflow-dominant storm mode anticipated. Given the
expected updraft strength and ample moisture, some strong
water-loaded downdrafts capable of producing wind damaging are
possible.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 110
statute miles east and west of a line from 40 miles south southeast
of Charlottesville VA to 40 miles northwest of Allentown PA. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU1).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1 inch. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A few
cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
24020.

...Mosier

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 AM CST (1200 UTC), the center of Hurricane Flossie was
located near latitude 17.1 North, longitude 105.6 West. Flossie is
moving toward the west-northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h). This general
motion is expected to continue during the next couple of days, with
a slight decrease in forward speed.  On the forecast track, Flossie
should move farther away from southwestern Mexico today.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 90 mph (145 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Steady to rapid strengthening is forecast during
the next day or so, with weakening starting by late Wednesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90
miles (150 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 979 mb (28.91 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Flossie can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO header
WTPZ41 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Hurricane Flossie is expected to produce rainfall totals
of 2 to 4 inches, with isolated maximum totals of 6 inches, across
portions of the Mexican states of Guerrero, Michoacán, Colima, and
Jalisco through Wednesday. This rainfall could lead to isolated
life-threatening flooding and mudslides, especially in steep
terrain.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Hurricane Flossie, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep1.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected within portions of the
warning area, and are possible within the watch areas, through this
morning.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Flossie will affect portions of the coast
of southwestern Mexico during the next few days. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Flossie Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062025
300 AM CST Tue Jul 01 2025

Flossie continues to strengthen early this morning, evident by an 
expanding central dense overcast (CDO) over the low-level center of 
the cyclone.  A couple recent scatterometer passes at 0337z and 
0428z helped in locating the center underneath the CDO, and assisted 
with the refinement of the 34 and 50 knot wind radii.  The latest 
subjective Dvorak intensity estimates came in at T4.0/65 knots from 
both SAB and TAFB. The objective intensity estimates ranged from 69 
to 79 knots at 06z.  Based on a blend of these estimates, and taking 
into account the improved satellite presentation during the past few 
hours, the initial intensity has been raised to 75 knots for this 
advisory.  

Flossie is heading toward the west-northwest or 300/09 knots. This 
motion is expected to continue during the next several days with a 
slight decrease in forward speed, as the cyclone is steered into a 
weakness in the mid-level ridge to the northwest of the system. The 
track forecast is very close to the previous advisory and is closely 
aligned with a blend of the latest HCCA, TVCE, and FSSE consensus 
aids as well as the latest EC-AIFS run.

The environment will remain very conducive for strengthening during 
the next 24 to 36 hours, with warm sea surface temperatures of 
28/29C, abundant mid-level moisture, and light vertical wind shear. 
The latest SHIPS RI probabilities show a greater than 40 percent 
chance of a 25-knot increase in 24 hours, and the official forecast 
reflects this. Rapid weakening will then begin by 48 hours as 
Flossie moves over progressively cooler water and begins to entrain 
dry mid-level air.  The system is forecast to become a post-tropical 
low by 72 hours and a remnant low at 96 hours. The intensity 
forecast is on the high end of the intensity aids, closest to SHIPS 
and NNIC.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. The outer bands of Hurricane Flossie should bring locally heavy 
rainfall to coastal portions of the Mexican states of Guerrero,  
Michoacán, Colima, and Jalisco through Wednesday. Life-threatening 
flooding and mudslides are possible, particularly in steep terrain.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected in portions of the
tropical storm warning area in southwestern Mexico, through today.

Mesoscale Discussion 1526
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0303 PM CDT Mon Jun 30 2025

Areas affected...portions of central/southern New Mexico

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 302003Z - 302200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated severe wind gusts possible this
afternoon/evening.

DISCUSSION...Regional satellite/radar shows a few areas of robust,
terrain-driven convection, mainly across central/northern portions
of New Mexico with some merging of convection beginning to occur.
These storms initiated amid strong morning insolation and sufficient
boundary layer moisture for destabilization, characterized by dew
point temperatures in the upper 40s and lower 50s F. These
conditions have led to MLCAPE values near 1000 J/kg and strong
low-level lapse rates, exceeding 8-9 C in most areas. Storms are
expected to continue merging and gradually move off the high terrain
and drift south with time. Isolated severe wind gusts will be
possible with this activity through the remainder of the afternoon
into the early evening.

Tropical Storm Flossie Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062025
300 PM CST Mon Jun 30 2025
 
Flossie's satellite presentation has continued to improve throughout 
the day, with convective cold cloud tops near -80C over the 
low-level center, and well-defined curve banding features. An 
earlier scatterometer pass around 1629 UTC showed a peak wind of 47 
kt, and helped to refine the current tropical-storm-force wind 
radii. Latest objective and subjective satellite intensity estimates 
range from 45 to 55 kt, including a T/3.5 from TAFB. Given the 
satellite trends, the intensity is set to 55 kt closes to UW-CIMSS 
ADT and the TAFB Dvorak estimates.

The storm is within a favorable environment to continue 
strengthening, current SSTs are around 29-30C, with low vertical 
wind shear. The NHC intensity forecast remains on the higher end of 
the guidance envelope and now has a peak intensity of 90 kt, closest 
to the regional hurricane HAFS models. In about 48 h, environmental 
conditions become increasingly more hostile, with drier air and 
cooler sea surface temperatures, which should induce a steady 
weakening trend. By day 4, Flossie is forecast to become a 
post-tropical cyclone as the system will struggle to produce 
convection within the harsh environment.
 
The initial estimated motion is toward the northwest, or 305/10 kt. 
A northwest to west-northwest motion is expected throughout the 
forecast period steered by a mid-level ridge. The NHC track forecast 
was nudged slightly to the left and lies closest to the HCCA 
corrected consensus aids.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. The outer bands of Tropical Storm Flossie should bring locally 
heavy rainfall to coastal portions of the Mexican states of 
Guerrero, Michoacán, Colima, and Jalisco through Wednesday. 
Life-threatening flooding and mudslides are possible, particularly 
in steep terrain.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected in portions of the 
tropical storm warning area in southwestern Mexico, later today 
through Tuesday.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 AM CST (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Flossie was
located near latitude 15.2 North, longitude 102.1 West. Flossie is
moving toward the northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h). A west-northwest
to northwest motion should continue over the next few days.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 50 mph (85 km/h) with 
higher gusts. Steady-to-rapid strengthening is forecast during the 
next couple of days, and the system is expected to become a 
hurricane tonight or Tuesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Flossie can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO header
WTPZ41 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Flossie is expected to produce rainfall
totals of 3 to 6 inches, with isolated maximum totals of 10 inches,
across portions of the Mexican states of Oaxaca, Guerrero,
Michoacán, Colima, and Jalisco through Wednesday. This rainfall may
lead to areas of life-threatening flooding and mudslides, especially
in areas of steep terrain.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Storm Flossie, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic available at

WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning
area, and are possible within the watch areas, tonight through
Tuesday.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Flossie will affect portions of the coast
of southwestern Mexico during the next few days. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

Tropical Storm Flossie Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062025
300 AM CST Mon Jun 30 2025
 
A 30/0357 UTC ASCAT-B pass over Flossie showed a sizable area of
30-35 kt winds in the NE quadrant, with 25-30 kt winds wrapping into
portions of the SE and NW quadrants.  The ASCAT data also indicates
that the RMW has contracted to about 40 n mi.  SSMIS and GMI
microwave passes between 00-03Z were also helpful in diagnosing the
position and structure of Flossie.  Since the time of the
above-mentioned microwave images, GOES satellite imagery indicates
that Flossie has started to become better organized, and it appears
that the low-level center is likely underneath the northern portion
of the central convective area, which has increased in size and
contains a large area of cloud tops colder than -80 degrees C. The
initial intensity is set to 40 kt due to the improved organization
since the time of the ASCAT pass.  This estimate is also in line
with the latest objective intensity estimates from the UW-CIMSS ADT,
AiDT and DPRINT, which are running in the 40-45 kt range.
 
Atmospheric and oceanic conditions are expected to remain favorable
for intensification for at least another 48 h as Flossie moves
through an environment of warm water, weak vertical wind shear, and
a moist mid-level troposphere.  Rapid intensification remains a
distinct possibility over the next day or two.  The NHC forecast
continues to show steady to rapid intensification.  The official
forecast is near the higher end of the intensity guidance envelope.
Beyond 48 h, Flossie should gradually encounter a dry and stable
airmass and cross over cooling waters which will lead to steady
weakening.
 
The initial motion estimate is toward the northwest, or 315/9 kt. A
motion between west-northwest and northwest should continue for the
next few days as Flossie moves through a break in the subtropical
ridge.  The NHC track forecast is mostly unchanged from the previous
official forecast, and lies in between the simple and corrected
consensus aids.
 
The latest NHC forecast has necessitated the issuance of a Tropical
Storm Warning for portions of the coast of Mexico, as
tropical-storm-force wind speed probabilities are in the 40 to 50
percent range for portions of the area.  Residents of Mexico should
stay updated on the latest forecast.  A shift in track to the right
of the official forecast could bring more significant impacts to the
coast of southwestern Mexico.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. The outer bands of Tropical Storm Flossie may bring locally heavy
rainfall to the Mexican states of Oaxaca, Guerrero, Michoacán,
Colima, and Jalisco through mid-week. Life-threatening flooding and
mudslides are possible, particularly in areas of steep terrain.
 
2. A tropical storm warning has been issued for a portion of
southwestern Mexico, where tropical storm conditions are expected
late today through Tuesday.

Mesoscale Discussion 1513
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0337 PM CDT Sun Jun 29 2025

Areas affected...southeast Kansas...southwest Missouri...and far
northeast Oklahoma

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 478...

Valid 292037Z - 292200Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 478
continues.

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms will continue through the afternoon.
Isolated wind damage should be the primary threat.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms continue to develop/loosely organize
across southeast Kansas and southwest Missouri this afternoon along
the leading edge of an advancing cold pool from overnight
convection. The airmass along and ahead of these storms is strongly
to extremely unstable, with MUCAPE values in excess of 5000 J/kg
across northeast Oklahoma and northwest Arkansas, with very little
convective inhibition remaining. 

The degree of instability and loose organization should continue a
severe threat through the afternoon despite the presence of meager
deep-layer shear. The extreme instability, and precipitable water
values near 2 inches in the vicinity of these thunderstorms should
lead to continued water-loaded downdrafts and a reinforcement of the
cold pool, leading to continued thunderstorm development. An
isolated severe wind gust or wind damage will be possible this
afternoon, especially on or near area lakes where frictional effects
will be minimized.

Mesoscale Discussion 1512
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0322 PM CDT Sun Jun 29 2025

Areas affected...Portions of Wisconsin

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 477...

Valid 292022Z - 292145Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 477
continues.

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms will continue this afternoon in a strongly
unstable airmass. Large hail and isolated wind damage are possible
with the strongest thunderstorms.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms continue along a diffuse frontal zone
across Wisconsin this afternoon in response to strong diurnal
heating and  minimal inhibition. Despite most-unstable CAPE values
in excess of 2000 J/kg, these thunderstorms have shown little
organization nor longevity -- likely owing to the weak deep-layer
shear. 

Given the degree of instability, freezing heights are sufficiently
low to support an isolated large hail threat through the afternoon,
especially with the strongest thunderstorm cores. Additionally, the
potential for isolated wind damage may occur with any strong
thunderstorm updraft collapse.

0300 PM CDT Sun Jun 29 2025

Areas affected...southeast CO and northeast NM

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 292000Z - 292130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated severe gusts and small to marginally severe hail
will be possible through late afternoon across southeast Colorado
into northeast New Mexico. After coordination with WFO PUB, watch
issuance in the near-term is unlikely, but may increase later
towards the Kansas border.

DISCUSSION...Several cells have formed from the Pikes Peak region
southward along the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. Much of this region
lies on the fringe of meager buoyancy with a deep, well-mixed
boundary layer across the adjacent High Plains. PUB VWP data sampled
slightly stronger low-level northeasterlies relative to mid-level
westerlies, indicative of the modest deep-layer flow and shear
environment. Nevertheless, the large surface temperature-dew point
spreads will be favorable for microbursts capable of strong to
severe gusts. Convection is expected to remain disorganized over the
next few hours. There is signal that some uptick may occur into
early evening as outflows impinge on increasingly greater buoyancy
towards the KS border.

Tropical Storm Flossie Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062025
300 PM CST Sun Jun 29 2025
 
Earlier SSMIS microwave data and satellite imagery depicted Flossie 
becoming better organized with curved banding features. However, 
recent imagery shows that banding has become a little more broken 
since the previous advisory, as Flossie is still trying to organize 
and consolidate. A 1600 UTC METOP-C scatterometer pass shows that 
the low-level center has become better defined, however was slightly 
south of the previously estimated position, and satellite-derived 
winds were around 31 kt. Using the scatterometer data and the latest 
subjective Dvorak intensity estimates T2.5, from both TAFB and SAB, 
the intensity is held at 35 kt for this advisory.
 
Flossie is located within a favorable environment for strengthening 
with warm sea surface temperatures, plentiful moisture and low to 
moderate wind shear. As the system becomes better organized, steady 
strengthening is forecast. Rapid intensification indices remain 
elevated in latest SHIPS guidance, however RI is not explicitly 
forecast at this time. The latest NHC intensity forecast is similar 
to the previous, closest to the hurricane regional aids, but lies 
slightly below the HCCA corrected consensus.
 
The current motion is estimated to be westward-northwestward around 
295/7 kt. The storm is forecast moving west-northwestward  with a 
turn towards the northwest anticipated tomorrow around the western 
periphery of a subtropical ridge. The latest track forecast is near 
the previous, and lies between the simple and HCCA corrected 
consensus aids.
 
Residents of Mexico should stay updated on the latest forecast.  A 
track even a little more to the right of the official forecast could 
bring more significant impacts to the coast of southwestern Mexico.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. The outer bands of Tropical Storm Flossie may bring locally heavy 
rainfall to the Mexican states of Oaxaca, Guerrero, Michoacán, 
Colima, and Jalisco through early this week. Life-threatening 
flooding and mudslides are possible, particularly in areas of steep 
terrain.
 
2. A tropical storm watch is in effect for southwestern Mexico, and 
tropical storm warnings could be required later tonight for a 
portion of the coast of southern Mexico.

Tropical Depression Six-E Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062025
300 AM CST Sun Jun 29 2025

The convection associated with the area of low pressure located 
south of southern Mexico has become much better organized over the 
past 12 hours.  Additionally, a 29/0328 UTC ASCAT-C pass showed a 
well-defined, closed low-level circulation with maximum winds around 
25 kt.  The latest subjective Dvorak current intensity estimates 
from TAFB and SAB are T-2.5 and T-2.0, respectively.  The 
disturbance is upgraded to a tropical depression based on the 
development of organized convection and a well-defined center. 

The aforementioned ASCAT pass shows that Tropical Depression Six-E 
has a large RMW.  However, the cyclone is located within a favorable 
environment with warm SSTs, a moist mid-level troposphere and low to 
moderate vertical wind shear.  The depression is forecast to remain 
in these favorable conditions for another 3 to 4 days as it 
parallels the coast of Mexico.  Due to the large RMW, only slow 
strengthening is forecast for the first 24 h.  The system is 
expected to strengthen more quickly once it establishes a stronger 
convective core, and rapid intensification appears likely to occur 
by Tuesday.  The NHC intensity forecast is at the high end of the 
intensity guidance, especially at 60-72 h, and calls for the 
system to become a significant hurricane.  By 96 h, the cyclone 
should reach cooler water, and rapid weakening is likely in 4 to 5 
days, with the system likely becoming a remnant low around day 5. 

The current motion of the depression is estimated to be westward, or 
270/10 kt.   The cyclone is forecast to generally move in a 
direction between west-northwest and northwest for the next few 
days, toward a weakness in the subtropical ridge, and the model 
guidance is in good agreement on this general scenario.  The NHC 
forecast is down the middle of the guidance envelope, close to the 
TVCE consensus.  

Residents of Mexico should stay updated on the latest forecast.  A 
track even a little to the right of the official forecast would 
bring more significant impacts to the coast of southwestern Mexico.
