Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0748 AM CDT Mon Jun 30 2025

Valid 301300Z - 011200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
SOUTHERN PLAINS INTO THE MIDWEST AND MID ATLANTIC STATES...AND PARTS
OF THE DESERT SOUTHWEST AND WEST COAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms are possible across portions of the
southern Plains into the Midwest and the Mid-Atlantic, and in parts
of the Desert Southwest, and also in adjacent parts of southern
Oregon and northern California today.

...Synopsis...
Water-vapor imagery this morning shows an upper trough over the
Dakotas/Upper Midwest, and this feature is forecast to move into the
Great Lakes by tonight.  At the same time, sub-tropical ridging will
build over the Plains, keeping stronger flow aloft displaced to the
north.  Farther west, an upper trough/low will meander slowly
eastward over the eastern Pacific towards the CA coast.  At the
surface, a weak cold front will sag southward from the
Midwest to the southern Plains.  

...Southern Plains into the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic states...
A myriad of prior convective outflow in addition to the cold front
will serve as foci for storm development today.  Ahead of the
slow-moving cold front, rich low-level moisture and heating will
lead to moderate to strong destabilization in areas void of
persistent early day cloud debris.  Small clusters and bands of
storms may locally concentrate some damaging-wind threat, but
predictability of these meso-beta corridors remains uncertain. 
Nonetheless, scattered storms will gradually progress east and
southward during the day and through the evening across the Marginal
Risk area.  Strong to severe downdrafts will be the primary severe
threat, but large hail may occur with a few storms over parts of the
southern Plains where lapse rates/buoyancy are greater than areas
farther northeast.  The overall severe threat will likely remain
tempered by weak to modest mid-level flow.

...Southwest NM and far southeast AZ...
Strong heating of an adequately moist airmass will result in
appreciable buoyancy by peak heating.  Scattered thunderstorms
developing within an environment characterized by very steep lapse
rates and inverted-v profiles, will support isolated severe gusts
(60-70 mph) with the stronger evaporatively cooled downdrafts during
the late afternoon and early evening.

...Northern CA into southern OR...
Ahead of the weak upper trough immediately west of the CA coast,
southerly flow will aid in increasing mid-level moisture across
parts of northern CA and southern OR.  Ample heating coupled with
weak large-scale and orographic ascent will aid in isolated to
scattered high-based thunderstorm development.  Very steep lapse
rates and a deep, dry sub cloud layer will favor evaporatively
cooled downdrafts capable of isolated 55-65 mph gusts.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0353 AM CDT Mon Jun 30 2025

Valid 031200Z - 081200Z

...DISCUSSION...
A mid-level ridge will start the extended period across the Plains
on D4/Thursday. This ridge will shift east through the extended
period. A surface low will develop in the lee of the Rockies and
move slowly north and east, reaching eastern Ontario by D7/Sunday.
This surface low and its associated cold front will likely be the
only potential for any severe weather during the extended period.
However, at this time it appears the stronger shear will be well
displaced from the greater instability. Therefore, severe weather
probabilities are not necessary at this time. 

Outside of this frontal zone during the Day 4 to Day 7 period,
thunderstorms are likely. However, weak lapse rates and very weak

Tropical Storm Flossie Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062025
300 AM CST Mon Jun 30 2025
 
A 30/0357 UTC ASCAT-B pass over Flossie showed a sizable area of
30-35 kt winds in the NE quadrant, with 25-30 kt winds wrapping into
portions of the SE and NW quadrants.  The ASCAT data also indicates
that the RMW has contracted to about 40 n mi.  SSMIS and GMI
microwave passes between 00-03Z were also helpful in diagnosing the
position and structure of Flossie.  Since the time of the
above-mentioned microwave images, GOES satellite imagery indicates
that Flossie has started to become better organized, and it appears
that the low-level center is likely underneath the northern portion
of the central convective area, which has increased in size and
contains a large area of cloud tops colder than -80 degrees C. The
initial intensity is set to 40 kt due to the improved organization
since the time of the ASCAT pass.  This estimate is also in line
with the latest objective intensity estimates from the UW-CIMSS ADT,
AiDT and DPRINT, which are running in the 40-45 kt range.
 
Atmospheric and oceanic conditions are expected to remain favorable
for intensification for at least another 48 h as Flossie moves
through an environment of warm water, weak vertical wind shear, and
a moist mid-level troposphere.  Rapid intensification remains a
distinct possibility over the next day or two.  The NHC forecast
continues to show steady to rapid intensification.  The official
forecast is near the higher end of the intensity guidance envelope.
Beyond 48 h, Flossie should gradually encounter a dry and stable
airmass and cross over cooling waters which will lead to steady
weakening.
 
The initial motion estimate is toward the northwest, or 315/9 kt. A
motion between west-northwest and northwest should continue for the
next few days as Flossie moves through a break in the subtropical
ridge.  The NHC track forecast is mostly unchanged from the previous
official forecast, and lies in between the simple and corrected
consensus aids.
 
The latest NHC forecast has necessitated the issuance of a Tropical
Storm Warning for portions of the coast of Mexico, as
tropical-storm-force wind speed probabilities are in the 40 to 50
percent range for portions of the area.  Residents of Mexico should
stay updated on the latest forecast.  A shift in track to the right
of the official forecast could bring more significant impacts to the
coast of southwestern Mexico.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. The outer bands of Tropical Storm Flossie may bring locally heavy
rainfall to the Mexican states of Oaxaca, Guerrero, Michoacán,
Colima, and Jalisco through mid-week. Life-threatening flooding and
mudslides are possible, particularly in areas of steep terrain.
 
2. A tropical storm warning has been issued for a portion of
southwestern Mexico, where tropical storm conditions are expected
late today through Tuesday.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0221 AM CDT Mon Jun 30 2025

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

...Synopsis...
Mid-level flow across the CONUS should continue to amplify as the
sub-tropical ridge over the West gradually shifts eastward. The
upper low across the West Coast will intensify, spreading enhanced
flow aloft and monsoon moisture over much of the West. The increased
moisture will support dry thunderstorms over the Northwest and UT,
while warm and breezy conditions will favor elevated fire-weather
conditions over the Great Basin.

...Central Great Basin...
As the upper low over the West intensifies, enhanced mid-level flow
will overspread parts of the Great Basin and Southwest. On the
periphery of the building upper ridge, very warm and dry conditions
are likely. The stronger southerly mid-level flow over top the
dry/well-mixed boundary layer will support gusty southerly winds
across central/southern NV Tuesday. Widespread gusts of 15-25 mph
are expected, with RH values below 15%. As area fuels continuing to
dry, elevated to locally critical fire-weather conditions are
likely.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
A second day of thunderstorms is expected from northern CA into
southern OR and western ID Tuesday. Weak ascent from the upper low,
coupled with northward moving monsoon moisture will support
scattered storms through much of the day. Increased storm motions
and, steep low-level lapse rates will still favor relatively poor
precipitation efficiency. This suggests dry lighting is again
possible across the northern Coastal ranges of CA, east of the
Cascades to the OR/ID border.

Across parts of UT, the initial influx of deeper monsoon moisture
from the upper-level trough into the Intermountain West will support
isolated thunderstorms across the central mountains Tuesday. With
PWAT values of 0.7-0.8 inches and modest storm speeds, a mixed mode
of wet and dry storms is expected over the higher terrain. Very
receptive fuels (ERCs > 90th percentile), suggest dry lightning
ignitions are possible outside the heavier precip core.

Mesoscale Discussion 1513
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0337 PM CDT Sun Jun 29 2025

Areas affected...southeast Kansas...southwest Missouri...and far
northeast Oklahoma

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 478...

Valid 292037Z - 292200Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 478
continues.

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms will continue through the afternoon.
Isolated wind damage should be the primary threat.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms continue to develop/loosely organize
across southeast Kansas and southwest Missouri this afternoon along
the leading edge of an advancing cold pool from overnight
convection. The airmass along and ahead of these storms is strongly
to extremely unstable, with MUCAPE values in excess of 5000 J/kg
across northeast Oklahoma and northwest Arkansas, with very little
convective inhibition remaining. 

The degree of instability and loose organization should continue a
severe threat through the afternoon despite the presence of meager
deep-layer shear. The extreme instability, and precipitable water
values near 2 inches in the vicinity of these thunderstorms should
lead to continued water-loaded downdrafts and a reinforcement of the
cold pool, leading to continued thunderstorm development. An
isolated severe wind gust or wind damage will be possible this
afternoon, especially on or near area lakes where frictional effects
will be minimized.

Mesoscale Discussion 1512
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0322 PM CDT Sun Jun 29 2025

Areas affected...Portions of Wisconsin

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 477...

Valid 292022Z - 292145Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 477
continues.

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms will continue this afternoon in a strongly
unstable airmass. Large hail and isolated wind damage are possible
with the strongest thunderstorms.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms continue along a diffuse frontal zone
across Wisconsin this afternoon in response to strong diurnal
heating and  minimal inhibition. Despite most-unstable CAPE values
in excess of 2000 J/kg, these thunderstorms have shown little
organization nor longevity -- likely owing to the weak deep-layer
shear. 

Given the degree of instability, freezing heights are sufficiently
low to support an isolated large hail threat through the afternoon,
especially with the strongest thunderstorm cores. Additionally, the
potential for isolated wind damage may occur with any strong
thunderstorm updraft collapse.

Mesoscale Discussion 1511
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0300 PM CDT Sun Jun 29 2025

Areas affected...southeast CO and northeast NM

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 292000Z - 292130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated severe gusts and small to marginally severe hail
will be possible through late afternoon across southeast Colorado
into northeast New Mexico. After coordination with WFO PUB, watch
issuance in the near-term is unlikely, but may increase later
towards the Kansas border.

DISCUSSION...Several cells have formed from the Pikes Peak region
southward along the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. Much of this region
lies on the fringe of meager buoyancy with a deep, well-mixed
boundary layer across the adjacent High Plains. PUB VWP data sampled
slightly stronger low-level northeasterlies relative to mid-level
westerlies, indicative of the modest deep-layer flow and shear
environment. Nevertheless, the large surface temperature-dew point
spreads will be favorable for microbursts capable of strong to
severe gusts. Convection is expected to remain disorganized over the
next few hours. There is signal that some uptick may occur into
early evening as outflows impinge on increasingly greater buoyancy
towards the KS border.

Tropical Storm Flossie Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062025
300 PM CST Sun Jun 29 2025
 
Earlier SSMIS microwave data and satellite imagery depicted Flossie 
becoming better organized with curved banding features. However, 
recent imagery shows that banding has become a little more broken 
since the previous advisory, as Flossie is still trying to organize 
and consolidate. A 1600 UTC METOP-C scatterometer pass shows that 
the low-level center has become better defined, however was slightly 
south of the previously estimated position, and satellite-derived 
winds were around 31 kt. Using the scatterometer data and the latest 
subjective Dvorak intensity estimates T2.5, from both TAFB and SAB, 
the intensity is held at 35 kt for this advisory.
 
Flossie is located within a favorable environment for strengthening 
with warm sea surface temperatures, plentiful moisture and low to 
moderate wind shear. As the system becomes better organized, steady 
strengthening is forecast. Rapid intensification indices remain 
elevated in latest SHIPS guidance, however RI is not explicitly 
forecast at this time. The latest NHC intensity forecast is similar 
to the previous, closest to the hurricane regional aids, but lies 
slightly below the HCCA corrected consensus.
 
The current motion is estimated to be westward-northwestward around 
295/7 kt. The storm is forecast moving west-northwestward  with a 
turn towards the northwest anticipated tomorrow around the western 
periphery of a subtropical ridge. The latest track forecast is near 
the previous, and lies between the simple and HCCA corrected 
consensus aids.
 
Residents of Mexico should stay updated on the latest forecast.  A 
track even a little more to the right of the official forecast could 
bring more significant impacts to the coast of southwestern Mexico.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. The outer bands of Tropical Storm Flossie may bring locally heavy 
rainfall to the Mexican states of Oaxaca, Guerrero, Michoacán, 
Colima, and Jalisco through early this week. Life-threatening 
flooding and mudslides are possible, particularly in areas of steep 
terrain.
 
2. A tropical storm watch is in effect for southwestern Mexico, and 
tropical storm warnings could be required later tonight for a 
portion of the coast of southern Mexico.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 477
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
130 PM CDT Sun Jun 29 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Central and Southern Wisconsin
  Lake Michigan

* Effective this Sunday afternoon and evening from 130 PM until
  900 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 65 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1 inch in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms are intensifying along a weak cold front
across Wisconsin.  These storms will spread northeastward across the
watch area through the afternoon, posing a risk of locally damaging
wind gusts and perhaps hail.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 60
statute miles east and west of a line from 45 miles southwest of
Lonerock WI to 60 miles north northeast of Green Bay WI. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU7).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1 inch. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 55 knots. A few
cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
24025.

0300 PM CDT Sun Jun 29 2025

Valid 292000Z - 301200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PARTS OF THE
CENTRAL PLAINS INTO THE MIDDLE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY...AND OVER PARTS
OF THE UPPER MIDWEST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated to scattered strong to severe thunderstorms are possible
from the upper Great Lakes into the central High Plains. Wind is the
primary risk, though hail is expected across portions of the High
Plains.

...20Z Update...
The Slight risk was expanded southeastward from parts of the central
Plains into the Middle MS Valley, where a cluster of thunderstorms
is intensifying as it impinges on a strongly unstable air mass. The
primary concern with this activity is damaging wind gusts. For
information on the severe risk here, reference Severe Thunderstorm
Watch 478. Additionally, 2-percent tornado probabilities were added
along this corridor and westward into southeast/south-central KS and
far northeast/north-central OK. Here, antecedent outflow is
diurnally destabilizing amid rich boundary-layer moisture.
Clockwise-curved low-level hodographs will support a localized
tornado risk with any cells that can develop in this corridor.

Farther west, significant-wind probabilities were added over
northwest KS, southwest NE, and far eastern CO. Any thunderstorm
clusters that evolve out of CO and move through this area will have
the potential of producing gusts upward of 75 mph -- aided by steep
deep-layer lapse rates and sufficiently elongated hodographs.
Additionally, visible satellite imagery shows a shallow
boundary-layer cumulus field along a surface wind shift in this
general area. As storms move into this area of enhanced moisture and
steep lapse rates, a brief tornado will be possible.

Reference Severe Thunderstorm Watch 477 and MCD 1508 for the severe
risk in the Upper Midwest, and MCDs 1509 and 1510 for the High
Plains severe risk.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1130 AM CDT Sun Jun 29 2025/

...Eastern KS/Western MO...
An overnight MCS is slowly weakening over central MO, with an
associated outflow boundary extending from eastern KS into
south-central MO.  Strong heating will occur along and south of the
boundary, where several 12z CAM solutions indicate development of
afternoon thunderstorms.  Given this scenario, have extended the
SLGT risk farther south into this region.  Locally damaging wind
gusts would be the main concern.  Refer to MCD #1506 for further
short-term details.

...WY/CO/SD/NE...
A low-amplitude shortwave trough is digging into WY.  As forcing
associated with this system overspreads the High Plains of WY,
high-based convection is expected.  Thunderstorms will intensify as
they track into a moderately unstable air mass and weak but backed
low-level flow.  Severe storms capable of large hail and damaging
winds may affect the Black Hills region and southward into the NE
Panhandle.  

Storms will also develop southward into the foothills of CO this
afternoon and spread eastward.  Winds and temperatures aloft are
less favorable for organized/severe storms that far south, but at
least isolated instances of large hail and damaging winds are
possible.

...IA/WI...
Strong heating is occurring across much of WI today, where a moist
air mass will lead to moderate CAPE values.  Thunderstorms will
develop by mid-afternoon along a remnant weak boundary across
central WI/northeast IA and spread northeastward through the day. 
Vertical shear is not particularly strong, and overall convective
organization is expected to be low.  Nevertheless, steep low-level
lapse rates and ample instability will promote strong downdrafts and
some hail in the strongest cells.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0226 PM CDT Sun Jun 29 2025

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PORTIONS OF
THE MID-ATLANTIC...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong to severe storms are possible across parts of the
Mid-Atlantic into the Northeast on Tuesday afternoon/evening. An
isolated severe storm may also occur over parts of the central High
Plains.

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will track across the Northeast as upper-ridging
remains in place across the central CONUS, and an upper low meanders
along the West Coast on Tuesday. At the surface, a cold front will
sweep across the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic regions while a surface
anticyclone overspreads much of the U.S. between the Rockies and
Appalachians. Ahead of the surface cold front, ample moisture and
instability, coinciding with modest deep-layer shear, will support
scattered strong thunderstorms, a few of which may be severe.

...Northeast into the Mid-Atlantic...
As the surface cold front advances east across the central/northern
Appalachians, surface heating should support surface temperatures
rising into the 80s to 90 F amid low to mid 70s F dewpoints,
resulting in moderate buoyancy. The rich low-level moisture,
overspread by mediocre lapse rates, will support 2500+ J/kg MLCAPE,
constrained to tall/thin profiles. With the approach of the trough,
enough strengthening with height of the 850-500 mb wind fields will
encourage 25-40 kts of effective bulk shear and the subsequent
development of multicells and short line segments. At least isolated
damaging gusts are possible throughout the Northeast. However, a
Category 2/Slight risk was added across parts of the Mid-Atlantic,
where the latest guidance depicts relatively robust convective
development, and where forecast buoyancy is strongest. Here, wind
damage may occur on a more frequent basis.

...Central High Plains...
Weak upslope low-level flow around the aforementioned surface
anticyclone will encourage the northwestward advection of upper 50s
to 60 F surface dewpoints into the Nebraska Panhandle and immediate
adjacent areas by Tuesday afternoon. These dewpoints will be
overspread by 7.5-8.5 C/km mid-level lapse rates, resulting in at
least 1500 J/kg MLCAPE. Isolated thunderstorms are expected to
develop off of the higher terrain as they progress eastward.
Multicellular or perhaps transient supercellular storm modes are
possible given lackluster vertical wind shear. Nonetheless, a stray
severe thunderstorm is possible, accompanied by mainly a severe
wind/hail threat.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PARTS OF THE
MIDWEST INTO THE OHIO VALLEY...THE MID-ATLANTIC...AND ALONG THE
CALIFORNIA/OREGON BORDER...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong to severe thunderstorms remain possible across
parts of the Ohio Valley, Midwest and the Mid-Atlantic tomorrow
(Monday). A couple of severe thunderstorms also cannot be ruled out
over parts of the Pacific Northwest.

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will amplify while traversing the Great Lakes and
Ohio Valley regions, as upper ridging builds over the Plains states
and an upper-level low impinges on the California coastline tomorrow
(Monday). A cold front will accompany the Midwest mid-level trough,
and is poised to progress across the Mid-MS and OH Valley regions
while draping across the southern Plains through the day. In advance
of the cold front, adequate moisture and overall instability will be
present to support at least scattered thunderstorms. Given the
presence of modest vertical wind shear, a few of the storms could
become strong to locally severe. Thunderstorms may also develop
north of a surface low along the CA/OR border, amid an unstable
airmass supportive of scattered strong thunderstorms.

...Midwest into the OH Valley...
Preceding an advancing cold front, diurnal heating of a moist
boundary layer, atop relatively poor mid-level lapse rates, will
result in airmass destabilization and 1500-3000 J/kg SBCAPE by
afternoon. While MLCINH will minimize by late morning, the poor
mid-level lapse rates suggest that CAPE should be constrained to
tall/thin profiles. Furthermore, unidirectional vertical wind
profiles with little strengthening with height, should lead to
mediocre deep-layer shear. While many scattered storms should
develop along the cold front, and ahead in the uncapped warm sector,
most storms should be pulse-cellular to multicellular in nature. A
few of the stronger storms may support wet downbursts capable of
producing localized damaging gusts.

...Mid-Atlantic...
Similar to the Great Lakes/OH Valley vicinity, strong boundary-layer
heating will quickly reduce convective inhibition and support
scattered thunderstorm development amid weak vertical wind shear.
2000+ J/kg of tall/thin SBCAPE will support wet downburst potential,
and a couple of damaging wind gusts are possible. 

...Southern Plains...
Scattered thunderstorms should develop by afternoon peak heating
ahead of the trailing cold front over the southern Plains. Surface
temperatures should warm to near 90 F amid low to mid 70s F
dewpoints, yielding as much as 3000-4000 J/kg MLCAPE given modest
mid-level lapse rates. Though vertical wind shear should be
relatively poor, the strong buoyancy in place may compensate to
support wet downbursts and associated isolated severe gusts with the
stronger storms.

...Northern California into Southern Oregon...
Scattered thunderstorms will develop immediately north of a weak
surface low, where localized forcing for ascent will be in place.
These thunderstorms should develop atop a mixed boundary layer that
may deepen to 600-500 mb. Furthermore, the presence of 9+ C/km lapse
rates through the troposphere may promote enough
thermodynamically-driven downward momentum transport to support
isolated strong to severe wind gusts. Point forecast soundings also
depict curved/elongated hodographs, which may support multicells and
transient supercells with a marginal hail threat.

The previous forecast (see below) remains on track with no changes
to Elevated highlights across southwestern Wyoming. Locally elevated
fire weather conditions are possible across southern Arizona.
Drought conditions and above normal fine fuel loading along with
sustained west winds of 10-15 mph and relative humidity of 10-15
percent will bring a brief and localized fire weather threat to
southern Arizona today.

..Williams.. 06/29/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0204 AM CDT Sun Jun 29 2025/

...Synopsis...
Shortwave troughing over the northern US is forecast to move
eastward as sub-tropical ridging begins to build over the West. A
weak cold front will move south shifting winds to northwesterly over
the Rockies and northern Plains. While weaker than the preceding
days, lingering flow aloft will still aid in sustaining breezy
northwest winds of 15-20 mph across the Interstate 80 corridor in
southwest WY. The winds overlapping with relative humidity in the
15-20 percent range amid very dry fuels will support elevated fire
weather conditions across southwest WY.

Tropical Depression Six-E Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062025
300 AM CST Sun Jun 29 2025

The convection associated with the area of low pressure located 
south of southern Mexico has become much better organized over the 
past 12 hours.  Additionally, a 29/0328 UTC ASCAT-C pass showed a 
well-defined, closed low-level circulation with maximum winds around 
25 kt.  The latest subjective Dvorak current intensity estimates 
from TAFB and SAB are T-2.5 and T-2.0, respectively.  The 
disturbance is upgraded to a tropical depression based on the 
development of organized convection and a well-defined center. 

The aforementioned ASCAT pass shows that Tropical Depression Six-E 
has a large RMW.  However, the cyclone is located within a favorable 
environment with warm SSTs, a moist mid-level troposphere and low to 
moderate vertical wind shear.  The depression is forecast to remain 
in these favorable conditions for another 3 to 4 days as it 
parallels the coast of Mexico.  Due to the large RMW, only slow 
strengthening is forecast for the first 24 h.  The system is 
expected to strengthen more quickly once it establishes a stronger 
convective core, and rapid intensification appears likely to occur 
by Tuesday.  The NHC intensity forecast is at the high end of the 
intensity guidance, especially at 60-72 h, and calls for the 
system to become a significant hurricane.  By 96 h, the cyclone 
should reach cooler water, and rapid weakening is likely in 4 to 5 
days, with the system likely becoming a remnant low around day 5. 

The current motion of the depression is estimated to be westward, or 
270/10 kt.   The cyclone is forecast to generally move in a 
direction between west-northwest and northwest for the next few 
days, toward a weakness in the subtropical ridge, and the model 
guidance is in good agreement on this general scenario.  The NHC 
forecast is down the middle of the guidance envelope, close to the 
TVCE consensus.  

Residents of Mexico should stay updated on the latest forecast.  A 
track even a little to the right of the official forecast would 
bring more significant impacts to the coast of southwestern Mexico.
