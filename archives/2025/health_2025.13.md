## Evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of phage therapy in treating fracture-related infections with multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: intravenous versus local application in sheep

date: 2025-04-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundFracture-related infections (FRI), particularly those caused by antibiotic resistant Staphylococcus aureus, present significant clinical challenges due to the formation of biofilm on the implanted device, and reduced options for conventional antibiotic treatment. Bacteriophage (phage) therapy (PT) offers a targeted approach to managing such infections, however, evidence for pharmacokinetics and optimal route of administration is limited for FRI. This study aimed to evaluate safety, phage distribution kinetics, phage neutralization, and antibacterial efficacy after intravenous or local administration in a sheep model.MethodsThe study was conducted in two phases: Phase 1 assessed the safety and distribution of two successive rounds of intravenous and local phage administration in non-infected sheep, while Phase 2 evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of intravenous versus local phage administration in combination with intravenous vancomycin in treating MRSA-induced FRI (tibial osteotomy with plate fixation). The specific pathogen and phage used in the sheep were both taken from a human FRI patient treated with PT. Phage neutralization and phage distribution were the primary outcomes measured in both phases of the sheep study.ResultsBoth intravenous and local phage administration were well-tolerated in non-infected sheep. Phages were cleared rapidly from circulation after intravenous administration, with no phage detected after 240 minutes. Phage neutralization increased during PT, peaking at 99.9% in non-inoculated sheep by the end of the second phage treatment (day 50). In infected sheep, phage neutralization levels reached a maximum of 99.9% earlier (day 13), with no significant differences between intravenous and local administration. The bacterial load was not significantly changed by PT, either IV or locally applied.ConclusionsPT is a safe adjunct to antibiotic treatment for FRI, however, phage neutralization developed rapidly and was accelerated in infected hosts. Further research is required to optimize phage selection, dosing, and delivery methods to enhance its therapeutic potential as an adjunct to conventional antibiotic therapy, particularly in the face of challenges such as rapid clearance and phage neutralization.

## The clinic application of mNGS and ENA-78 assays to identify intra-amniotic infection/inflammation

date: 2025-04-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectiveThe objective of this study is to explore whether metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) and Epithelial Neutrophil Activating Peptide-78 (ENA-78) assays in the amniotic fluid (AF) of patients with preterm labor (PTL) could be employed for diagnosing intra-amniotic infection/inflammation (IAI/I) and predict the outcomes of emergency cerclage in women with cervical insufficiency(CI).MethodsAF samples from 40 patients were subjected to PTL were subjected to mNGS and microbial culture to diagnose intra-amniotic infection known as microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity (MIAC); ELISA was used to analyze ENA-78 levels for prediction of intra-amniotic inflammation (IAI). Pregnancy outcomes were compared, the predictive performance of mNGS and ENA-78 were assessed to evaluate the efficacy of emergency cervical cerclage.ResultsThe diagnosis rate of MIAC was higher with mNGS (17.5%) compared to microbial culture (2.5%). AF ENA-78 levels were significantly higher in IAI patients than in non-IAI/I patients. ENA-78 demonstrated certain accuracy in identifying IAI, with sensitivity and specificity of 73.3% and 100%, respectively. Compared with non-IAI/I patients, patients with MIAC or IAI exhibited poor pregnancy outcomes after cervical cerclage.ConclusionsmNGS and ENA-78 assays are valuable means for assessing the state of infection/inflammation in the amniotic cavity and predicting the outcomes of emergency cerclage.

## A study on pregenomic RNA and factors in the pregnant and postpartum women with chronic HBV infection based on real world

date: 2025-04-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionMost studies have focused on mother-to-child transmission and postpartum hepatitis flares. We aimed to evaluate the expression profile of pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) and its associated factors in patients with chronic HBV infection (CHB) during pregnancy and postpartum.MethodsA total of 134 pregnant and 100 postpartum CHB patients were enrolled, and serum pgRNA levels were quantified.ResultsSignificant differences in clinical characteristics were noted between pregnant and postpartum CHB patients, but there was no significant difference in pgRNA levels between the two groups. When HBV DNA and HBV antigen levels were low, the corresponding pgRNA detection rate decreased. pgRNA was positively correlated with DNA and HBV antigens in the pregnant and postpartum CHB patients. In the pregnant group, antiviral treatment was an independent risk factor for pgRNA levels. In the postpartum period, HBeAg levels and antiviral treatment were independent risk factors for pgRNA levels. Considering that patients receiving antiviral treatment often have a high DNA load or HBeAg positivity, the DNA level and HBeAg essentially affect pgRNA levels. ConclusionpgRNA levels differ between pregnant and postpartum patients, and this difference is of great significance for the diagnosis and management of these particular groups.

## Plasma nontargeted metabolomics study of H1N1 and H3N2 influenza in children

date: 2025-04-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundThis study used a nontargeted metabolomic approach to investigate small molecular metabolites in the peripheral blood of pediatric patients with influenza. By comparing these metabolites with those in healthy children, potential biomarkers for the early detection and diagnosis of influenza were explored.MethodsPlasma samples were collected from 47 children with H1N1 influenza, 40 with H3N2 influenza, and 40 healthy controls at Xi’an Children’s Hospital, Xi’an Jiaotong University Second Affiliated Hospital, and Xi’an Central Hospital between May and September 2023. Nontargeted metabolomic detection and analysis were performed.ResultsIn the H1N1 group, 14 glycerophospholipid metabolites were significantly altered compared to controls, with 11 (78.5%) markedly downregulated. These downregulated metabolites showed negative correlations with inflammatory markers, including white blood cell (WBC) count, neutrophils, C-reactive protein (CRP), and Procalcitonin (PCT), whereas the upregulated metabolite PC(P-18:1(9Z)/16:0) showed positive correlations with validation markers. In the H3N2 group, 12 glycerophospholipid metabolites were significantly altered, with 9 being downregulated. The downregulated LysoPC(20:0/0:0) showed a positive correlation with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) but a negative correlation with WBC count, while the upregulated metabolite LysoPA(18:1(9Z)0:0) correlated positively with ALT, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).ConclusionsDistinct metabolomic profiles were identified in pediatric H1N1 and H3N2 influenza cases compared to healthy controls. Specific glycerophospholipid metabolites were closely associated with inflammatory and liver function markers, highlighting their potential as biomarkers for disease monitoring and early diagnosis.

## Metagenomic analysis reveals the diversity of the vaginal virome and its association with vaginitis

date: 2025-04-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionThe human vaginal virome is an essential yet understudied component of the vaginal microbiome. Its diversity and potential contributions to health and disease, particularly vaginitis, remain poorly understood.MethodsWe conducted metagenomic sequencing on 24 pooled vaginal swab libraries collected from 267 women, including both healthy individuals and those diagnosed with vaginitis. Viral community composition, diversity indices (Shannon, Richness, and Pielou), and phylogenetic characteristics were analyzed. Virus–host associations were also investigated.ResultsDNA viruses dominated the vaginal virome. Anelloviridae and Papillomaviridae were the most prevalent eukaryotic viruses, while Siphoviridae and Microviridae were the leading bacteriophages. Compared to healthy controls, the vaginitis group exhibited significantly reduced alpha diversity and greater beta diversity dispersion, indicating altered viral community structure. Anelloviruses, detected in both groups, showed extensive lineage diversity, frequent recombination, and pronounced phylogenetic divergence. HPV diversity and richness were significantly elevated in the vaginitis group, alongside an unbalanced distribution of viral lineages. Novel phage–bacterial associations were also identified, suggesting a potential role for bacteriophages in shaping the vaginal microbiome.DiscussionThese findings provide new insights into the composition and structure of the vaginal virome and its potential association with vaginal dysbiosis. The distinct virome characteristics observed in women with vaginitis highlight the relevance of viral communities in reproductive health. Future studies incorporating individual-level sequencing and metatranscriptomics are warranted to explore intra-host viral dynamics, assess viral activity, and clarify the functional roles of vaginal viruses in host–microbiome interactions.

## A model based on PT-INR and age serves as a promising predictor for evaluating mortality risk in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection

date: 2025-04-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

COVID-19 caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in a global pandemic. Considering some patients with COVID-19 rapidly develop respiratory distress and hypoxemia, early assessment of the prognosis for COVID-19 patients is important, yet there is currently a lack of research on a comprehensive multi-marker approach for disease prognosis assessment. Here, we utilized a large sample of hospitalized individuals with COVID-19 to systematically compare the clinical characteristics at admission and developed a nomogram model that was used to predict prognosis. In all cases, those with pneumonia, older age, and higher PT-INR had a poor prognosis. Besides, pneumonia patients with older age and higher PT-INR also had a poor prognosis. A nomogram model incorporating presence of pneumonia, age and PT-INR could evaluate the prognosis in all patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections well, while a nomogram model incorporating age and PT-INR could evaluate the prognosis in those with pneumonia well. Together, our study establishes a prognostic prediction model that aids in the timely identification of patients with poor prognosis and helps facilitate the improvement of treatment strategies in clinical practice in the future.

## Assessment of the placental microbiota of preterm infants with pneumonia: a case control study

date: 2025-04-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectiveTo investigate the specific characteristics and differences in the placental microbiome of preterm infants with and without pneumonia.MethodsFifty-nine infants born at 32–36 weeks’ gestation were enrolled in this study. Among them, 33 developed pneumonia within 48 hours of birth, while the remaining 26 did not. Placental swabs were collected at birth for DNA extraction, from which the placental microbial composition was analyzed using a bioinformatics pipeline following PCR amplification of genetic material and subsequent sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA.ResultsSignificant differences in both the alpha and beta diversities were found between the two groups (P<0.05). Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteriota were identified as the predominant phyla in the placenta, while predominant identified genera included Brevundimonas, Caulobacter, Lactobacillus, and Citrobacter. There were no significant inter-group differences in the relative abundances of the predominant phyla and genera except Lactobacillus(P>0.05). Compared to infants without pneumonia, those with pneumonia demonstrated a decreased abundance of Lactobacillus, and an increased abundance of Ureaplasma and Staphylococcus (P<0.05). The relative abundance of Ureaplasma was positively correlated with that of Staphylococcus, and negatively correlation with that of Lactobacillus (P<0.05). Notably, we observed significant disparities in the metabolic pathways and phenotypes between the two groups (P<0.05).ConclusionOverall, this study suggests that alterations in the placental microbiome may be linked to the onset of pneumonia in preterm infants. Further investigations are required to elucidate the relationship between microbiota and disease pathogenesis.

## Limitations of human t-lymphotropic virus type 1 antibody testing in hospitals of endemic regions in China

date: 2025-04-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

PurposeThis study aims to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) antibody testing within hospitals located in HTLV-1 endemic areas of China.MethodWe performed a retrospective analysis of the clinical records and laboratory results for 1,147 patients who underwent HTLV-1 antibody testing using the Wantai HTLV-1 antibody detection kit and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing for HTLV-1 nucleic acids, at Fujian Medical University Union Hospital between 2017 and 2023.ResultThe study population comprised 674 males (58.8%) and 473 females (41.2%), with an age distribution ranging from 7 to 86 years, and a median age of 50 years. Of the patients, 81 (7.1%) tested positive for HTLV-1 antibodies, including 39 males and 42 females. Predominantly, these positive cases were identified within the hematology department (93.8%). The cases originated from several high-prevalence coastal regions in Fujian province, such as Pingtan Island, Fuqing, Changle, Lianjiang, Fuan, Shouning, Xiapu, Zhouning, Fuding, Jiaocheng, Xiuyu, and Licheng. According to current standards for interpreting positive results, only 79.6% of patients with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) confirmed by HTLV-1 nucleic acid testing presented positive antibody results. Comparison of HTLV-1 antibody and nucleic acid test results revealed that the antibody test possessed a sensitivity of 63.0% and a specificity of 94.8%. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis determined that a threshold of 0.335 signal-to-cutoff (S/CO) was optimal for classifying positive antibody test results, yielding a sensitivity of 86.3% and a specificity of 94.4%.ConclusionThe Wantai HTLV-1 antibody test kit, when utilized in hospitals within endemic regions, exhibits a high level of specificity. However, its sensitivity is found to be lacking when evaluated against the current standards for the interpretation of positive results. For patients with a high clinical suspicion of HTLV-1 infection-related diseases, it is crucial to conduct testing of HTLV-1 antibodies and nucleic acids.

## Heparan sulfate proteoglycans remodel SARS-CoV-2 spike conformation to allow integrin interaction and infection of endothelial cells

date: 2025-04-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

SARS-CoV-2 infects ACE2-negative primary HL-mECs through the interaction of an RGD motif, included in all spike proteins, up to the Omicron BA.1 subvariant, with αvβ3 integrin. Following its entry, SARS-CoV-2 remodels ECs phenotype and promotes angiogenesis in the absence of productive viral replication. Moreover, lack of spike/αvβ3 interaction, occurring in Omicron BA.5 which contains the D405N mutation in the RGD motif, inhibits HL-mECs infection and dysfunction. It is worth noting that anti-spike antibodies do not impact SARS-CoV-2 entry into HL-mECs. This data highlights the fact that i) the RGD motif is not exposed in the entire spike protein and ii) the need of a cofactor favoring spike/αvβ3 interaction. HSPGs are used by different viruses as receptors and coreceptors for their entry into host cells. Here, we use different approaches to scrutinize the role exerted by HSPGs in favoring SARS-CoV-2 infection of ECs. We highlight HSPGs as key molecules responsible for RGD exposure allowing its binding to the αvβ3 integrin as the first step toward viral entry by endocytosis. Indeed, SPR analysis showed lack of spike/αvβ3 interaction in the absence of heparin. This data was further corroborated by immunofluorescence and infectivity assays. Interestingly, the use of Heparinase III or sodium chlorate counteracts the release of proangiogenic molecules and inhibits signaling pathways induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, HSPGs may represent a target for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection of ECs and EC dysfunction-related COVID-19 severity.

## Novel endophytic pestalotioid species associated with Itea in Thailand

date: 2025-04-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Endophytic fungi are a well-known fascinating host-associated fungal group that can enhance plant growth and fitness by producing various bioactive secondary metabolites. They are an excellent source of industrial enzymes for potential secondary metabolite synthesis, which is useful in green agriculture, biotechnology, and pharmaceuticals. Itea is a valuable plant genus since it naturally contains rare sugar; however, endophytic fungi associated in this host have not yet been documented. In the present study, 11 strains of endophytic fungi were isolated and primarily identified as pestalotioid taxa based on morphological characteristics exhibited in vitro. Eleven strains of Pestalotiopsis-like taxa were isolated from the healthy leaves, stems, and roots of Itea japonica and I. riparia from Chiang Mai Province, Thailand. Species delimitation was based on morphology, multiloci phylogeny of a concatenated ITS, tub2, and tef1-α sequence data, and nucleotide polymorphism analyses. Neopestalotiopsis iteae and Pseudopestalotiopsis iteae are proposed as new species on I. japonica and I. riparia, respectively. Neopestalotiopsis chrysea, N. haikouensis, and Pestalotiopsis jinchanghensis are described as new records on I. riparia. Owing to the conspecific relationship based on multiloci phylogeny and identically nucleotide pairwise comparison of sufficient gene regions, several species are synonymized including Neopestalotiopsis cercidicola and N. terricola as N. haikouensis, N. umbrinospora as N. chrysea, and Pestalotiopsis zhaoqingensis as P. jinchanghensis. The updated phylogenetic trees, nucleotide comparisons, and morphological descriptions are herein provided and discussed for the taxonomic placements of these new species and records. This study is the first to investigate Itea endophytes in Thailand, and it reveals the intra- and interspecific relationships of pestalotioid species, which need to be further reevaluated because of ambiguous taxa.

## Phospholipid scramblase 1: a frontline defense against viral infections

date: 2025-04-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) is the most studied member of the phospholipid scramblase protein family. Its main function is to catalyze calcium (Ca2+)-dependent, ATP-independent, bidirectional and non-specific translocation of phospholipids between inner and outer leaflets of plasma membrane. Additionally, PLSCR1 is identified as an interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) with antiviral activities, and its expression can be highly induced by all types of interferons in various viral infections. Indeed, numerous studies have reported the direct antiviral activities of PLSCR1 through interrupting the replication processes of a variety of viruses, including entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), nuclear localization of influenza A virus (IAV), and transactivation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human T-cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV1), human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV). In addition to these direct antiviral activities, PLSCR1 also regulates endogenous immune components to defend against viruses in both nonimmune and immune cells. Such activities include potentiation of ISG transcription, activation of JAK/STAT pathway, upregulation of type 3 interferon receptor (IFN-λR1) and recruitment of Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9). This review aims to summarize the current understanding of PLSCR1’s multiple roles as a frontline defense against viral infections.

## Qing-Re-Hua-Shi Decoction ameliorates DSS-induced colitis by modulating multiple signaling pathways and remodeling the gut microbiota and metabolite profile

date: 2025-04-02, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundClinically, Qing-Re-Hua-Shi Decoction (QRHSD) has been clinically used to treat ulcerative colitis (UC) with satisfactory outcomes and minimal side effects. However, its molecular mechanisms remain unclear.PurposeThis study investigates the effects of QRHSD on DSS-induced colitis in mice, employing multi-omics analyses, including RNA-seq transcriptomics, 16S rRNA microbiomics, non-targeted metabolomics, and network pharmacology analysis.MethodsThe chemical composition of QRHSD was analyzed using quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS). A UC mice model was induced by 3% DSS for 7 days. The effects and mechanisms of QRHSD on UC were evaluated via hematoxylin and eosin, immunofluorescence assay, flow cytometry, western blot, RNA-seq transcriptomics, 16S rRNA microbiomics, non-targeted metabolomics, and network pharmacology. Correlation analyses and validation experiments explored links between transcriptomic, microbiome, metabolomic profiles, and UC-related clinical indices.ResultsUPLC-Q-TOF/MS identified 55 compounds in QRHSD. QRHSD significantly reduced clinical activity, histological changes, and inflammatory factors in UC mice, regulated Th17/Treg balance, and enhanced intestinal barrier integrity. 16S rRNA analysis showed that QRHSD altered gut microbiota composition, increasing beneficial bacteria (e.g., Lactobacillus) and decreasing harmful bacteria (e.g., Morganella). Non-targeted metabolomics revealed 507 metabolites associated with UC amelioration, enriched in pathways like bile secretion, ABC transporters, and amino acid biosynthesis. RNA-seq analysis, network pharmacology, and experimental verification showed that QRHSD significantly regulated key signaling pathways, including PI3K/AKT, NF-κB, and MAPK signaling pathways. Finally, correlation analysis highlighted connections among UC-related clinical factors, gut microbiota, and metabolites.ConclusionQRHSD could modulate the gut microbiota, metabolic homeostasis, and multiple signal pathways in the treatment of DSS-induced UC, revealing the mechanism of traditional Chinese medicine therapy for UC.

## A short-term clinical evaluation of immediate implant placement in periodontitis patients

date: 2025-04-01, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundWith the advancement of oral implant technology, immediate implant placement is believed to be feasible for periodontitis patients. However, there is a lack of high-quality clinical studies regarding this approach. This study aimed to observe the short-term implant survival rate and conditions of peri-implant tissues in periodontitis patients who received immediate implants without systematic periodontal treatment.MethodsThis retrospective study included 95 patients and 234 implants treated at the Stomatological Hospital of Jinan University from June 2017 to December 2022. Patients were classified according to the 2018 AAP/EFP periodontal classification system, with Stage determined by CBCT-assessed marginal bone loss (MBL) and Grade estimated based on annual bone loss rate, smoking status, and diabetes history. Immediate implant placement was performed following atraumatic tooth extraction, with bone defects augmented using Bio-Oss bone graft and covered with Bio-Gide collagen membrane as needed. Patients were followed up for 12 months, during which implant survival, modified sulcus bleeding index (mSBI), modified plaque index (mPLI), marginal bone loss (MBL), and peri-implant probing depth (PPD) were assessed.ResultsA total of 95 patients (234 implants) were included, with a mean age of 58.59 years. The distribution of Stage II-IV and Grade A-C periodontitis was recorded. Preoperative assessments showed a significant increase in P-PDD, CAL, and MBL with greater disease severity (p < 0.001). One-year follow-up data indicated an implant survival rate of 97.86%, with Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealing significantly lower survival rates in Stage IV and Grade C patients (p < 0.05). Postoperative soft tissue health assessment showed significant differences in mSBI and mPLI between stages (p = 0.002, p = 0.007) but not grades (p > 0.05). PPD did not differ significantly among groups (p > 0.05), whereas MBL was significantly higher in Stage IV than in Stage II and III (p < 0.001), though no significant differences were observed across grades (p > 0.05). Clinical and radiographic evaluations demonstrated favorable implant outcomes, with most patients reporting high satisfaction. These findings reinforce the viability of immediate implant placement in periodontitis patients, demonstrating high short-term success rates across different disease severities. While disease severity and progression rate may influence clinical outcomes, appropriate case selection, meticulous surgical techniques, and comprehensive postoperative care can lead to predictable and favorable implant success, even in patients with periodontitis.

## Development and application of a dual LAMP-LFD assay for the simultaneous detection of Streptococcus suis and Glaesserella parasuis

date: 2025-04-01, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionStreptococcus suis (S. suis) and Glaesserella parasuis (G. parasuis) are prevalent pathogens in pig populations and are often associated with co-infections, leading to substantial economic losses in the swine industry. However, there is currently a shortage of rapid detection methods. In this study, a dual loop-mediated isothermal amplification combined with lateral flow dipstick (LAMP-LFD) assay was developed for the simultaneous and convenient detection of S. suis and G. parasuis.MethodsThe assay utilized primers targeting the conserved regions of the gdh gene of S. suis and the infB gene of G. parasuis. Optimal primer sets were identified, and reaction conditions, including temperature, time, and primer concentration ratios, were optimized using single-variable control method. The LAMP-LFD assay was established with biotin and digoxin or biotin and 6-FAM-labeled FIP/BIP primers, combined with LFD.ResultsThe assay was most effective at a reaction temperature of 62°C, a primer concentration ratio of 1:4, and a reaction time of 40 minutes. The minimum detection limits were 22 and 18 copies/μL for recombinant plasmids and 19 and 20 CFU for bacterial samples of S. suis and G. parasuis, respectively. The assay showed no cross-reactivity with other pathogens and exhibited high adaptability across various thermal platforms, including PCR instruments, metal baths, and water baths. Clinical testing of 106 samples revealed positive rates of 11.32% (12/106) for S. suis, 25.47% (27/106) for G. parasuis, and 2.83% (3/106) for mixed infections.DiscussionThis simple, rapid, specific, and sensitive dual LAMP-LFD assay provides robust technical support for the prevention and control of swine streptococcosis and Glässer's disease.

## Exploring urinary microbiome: insights into neurogenic bladder and improving management of urinary tract infections

date: 2025-04-01, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The traditional view of sterile urine has been challenged by advancements in next-generation sequencing, revealing that the urinary microbiome significantly influences individual health and various urinary system diseases. Urinary tract infections in patients with neurogenic bladder are highly prevalent, recurrent, and lifelong. If frequent urinary tract infections are not adequately managed, they may ultimately lead to chronic renal failure. The excessive use of antibiotics to prevent and treat urinary tract infections may lead to increased bacterial resistance, limiting future therapeutic options. This review summarizes commonly used microbiome research techniques and urine collection methods, compiles current studies on the urinary microbiome in neurogenic bladder patients, and discusses the potential implications of urinary microbiome composition for preventing, diagnosing, and treating urinary tract infections. By summarizing current research findings, we aim to enhance understanding of the urinary microbiome in neurogenic bladder patients and promote the standardization and clinical translation of microbiome research.

## The diagnostic value of third-generation nanopore sequencing in non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections

date: 2025-04-01, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundThis study aimed to investigate the diagnostic value of nanopore sequencing technology in non-tuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease (NTMPD) and compare it with traditional culture methods.MethodsA retrospective analysis was conducted on 225 suspected NTMPD patients admitted to the Fourth People’s Hospital of Nanning City from January 2022 to July 2024. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), kappa coefficient, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of nanopore sequencing, culture, and combined diagnostic methods were compared to evaluate their diagnostic performance. In addition, patients were divided into different groups to investigate the detection of NTMPD by nanopore sequencing technology under different pathogen concentrations, in cases of concurrent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection, and among the elderly (aged > 60 years).ResultsAmong 139 NTMPD samples, nanopore sequencing detected positives in 113 cases, with a sensitivity of 81.3%, PPV of 99.1%, NPV of 76.6%, kappa coefficient of 0.759, and AUC of 0.901, demonstrating high specificity (98.8%) comparable to culture. The combined diagnostic approach significantly improved the sensitivity (90.6%), NPV (98.4%), kappa coefficient (0.862), and AUC (0.942) of NTMPD diagnosis. Nanopore sequencing showed superior diagnostic value in samples with various bacterial concentrations and in cases of concurrent MTB infection.ConclusionThird-generation nanopore sequencing technology serves as a rapid and effective diagnostic tool, which may profoundly impact the current diagnosis of NTMPD.

## Receptors and host factors: key players in human metapneumovirus infection

date: 2025-04-01, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a significant global pathogen that causes acute respiratory tract infections, especially in infants, young children, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals. Despite its increasing prevalence, there are currently no vaccines or effective treatments available for hMPV. The pathogenesis of hMPV infection is a complex process involving a multitude of host factors and viral receptors. These interactions determine the virus ability to enter host cells, replicate, and evade the immune response. This review is the first to provide a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of host–virus interactions in hMPV pathogenesis. By elucidating these mechanisms, we can identify potential targets for antiviral drugs and improve the management of hMPV infections.

## Frequency, socio-economic characteristics, and risk factors of oral cavity parasites in diabetes mellitus patients from Lorestan Province, Iran; a case-control study

date: 2025-04-01, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundNumerous studies identify diabetes mellitus (DM) as one of the most significant risk factors for the development of periodontal diseases (gum diseases). Individuals with diabetes experience gingival destruction more rapidly and severely due to the accumulation of microbial plaque in the mouth. Entamoeba gingivalis and Trichomonas tenax are parasites commonly found in the human oral cavity. This study aims to determine, the frequency, socio-economic characteristics, and risk factors of E. gingivalis and T.tenax in DM patients from Lorestan Province, Iran as a case-control study.MethodsThe current case-control study involved 500 DM patients who were referred to health centers in Lorestan province, Iran between December 2022 and June 2024. Furthermore, a control group comprising 500 healthy persons without DM (non-DM) who were referred to health centers during the same study period was incorporated into the research. The prevalence of parasites in the oral cavity was determined using microscopic analysis and conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques. A questionnaire was administered to collect demographic information, including age, gender, place of residence, education level, occupation, monthly income, tooth brushing practices, and mouthwash usage.ResultsOut of a total of 500 DM patients, 136 (27.2%) and 146 (29.2%) patients had the oral cavity parasites (E. gingivalis and T. tenax) by microscopic and PCR analysis, respectively. While, in non-DM, 61 (12.2%) and 65 (13.0%) tested positive for parasites using microscopic and PCR methods, respectively (P<0.001). Among several factors, income (P = 0.001, OR = 5.491, 95% CI: 4.089 to 9.723), place of residence (P = 0.006, OR = 1.982, 95% CI: 1.222), education (P = 0.002, OR = 3.577 (1.618, 5.907)), and use mouthwash demonstrated a significant protective effect on the oral cavity parasites.ConclusionThis research for the first time in Iran highlighted a considerable prevalence of oral cavity parasites in DM patients in Lorestan province, Western Iran. Dental professionals should maintain a heightened awareness of these risk factors to effectively identify and address oral health challenges within this population, thereby reducing the incidence of oral diseases and infections.

## Emergence and evolution of rare ST592 blaNDM-1-positive carbapenem-resistant hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae in China

date: 2025-03-31, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectivesThis study aimed to characterize the genomes of two rare ST592 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates and to explore their evolution into carbapenem-resistant hypervirulent K. pneumoniae (CR-hvKp).MethodsThe minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined using a VITEK 2 compact system. Conjugation experiments were conducted using film matings. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed using the Illumina and Nanopore platforms. The antimicrobial resistance determinants were identified using the ABRicate program in the ResFinder database. Insertion sequences were identified using ISFinder and the bacterial virulence factors identified using the Virulence Factor Database (VFDB). The K and O loci were examined using Kleborate. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and replicon type identification were performed by the Center for Genomic Epidemiology. Conjugation-related elements were predicted using oriTfinder. The plasmid structure was visualized using Circos, and a possible evolutionary model was constructed using BioRender.ResultsIsolates KPZM6 and KPZM16 were identified as ST592 and KL57, respectively, and were collected from the same department. The antimicrobial susceptibility testing data revealed that KPZM16 possesses an extensively drug-resistant (XDR) profile, whereas KPZM6 is a susceptible K. pneumoniae. The hybrid assembly showed that both KPZM6 and KPZM16 have one pLVPK-like virulence plasmid carrying the rmpA, rmpA2, and iucABCD-iutA gene clusters. However, strain KPZM16 harbors one IncN plasmid carrying the carbapenem resistance genes blaNDM-1, dfrA14, and qnrS1. The results of the conjugation experiments demonstrated that the plasmid could be transferred to the recipient strain. It is possible that the NDM-1-producing plasmid was transferred from KPZM6 to KPZM16 via conjugation, leading to the formation of CR-hvKp.ConclusionsThis is the first study in which complete genomic characterization of the rare NDM-1-producing ST592 K. pneumoniae clinical isolate was performed. This study provides a possible evolutionary hypothesis for the formation of CR-hvKp via conjugation. Early detection is recommended to avoid the extensive spread of this clone.

## Immunogenicity of PvVir14-derived peptides to improve the serological diagnosis of Plasmodium vivax infection

date: 2025-03-31, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionMalaria, caused by Plasmodium vivax, remains a major global health problem, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. This study aimed to investigate the potential of PvVir14-derived peptides to improve diagnostic accuracy for P. vivax infections.MethodsThe reactivity of specific PvVir14-derived peptides against sera from acutely infected individuals from endemic and non-endemic areas experiencing a P. vivax malaria outbreak was assessed, as well as their sensitivity, specificity, and immunodominance.ResultsAmong the eight tested peptides (H08, K09, I03, G08, F08, H04, L06, and N04), H08, G08, and L06 showed significantly higher IgG reactivity in sera from individuals living in endemic areas, mainly within those with multiple malaria episodes. After a P. vivax outbreak in a non-endemic area, H08 and G08 had the highest IgM frequencies, however, sensitivity and specificity analyses indicated that L06 was the most effective peptide for identifying infected individuals. Depletion ELISA confirmed the immunodominance of L06, G08, and H08 and showed a significant reduction in IgG reactivity to PvVir14. The peptides L06, G08, and H08, showed high sensitivity and specificity as diagnostic tools for P. vivax malaria.ConclusionsThese peptides can improve diagnostic accuracy, especially in endemic areas, providing better support to malaria control and management programs.

## Partial normalization of microbiota dysbiosis in condyloma acuminatum patients following treatment

date: 2025-03-31, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionCondyloma acuminatum (CA) is the most common sexually transmitted disease and the presence of microbiota dysbiosis has been observed to promote the progress of the disease. However, the explicit characteristics of microbiota dysbiosis in CA patients have not been well elucidated yet.MethodsWe recruited 40 CA patients who received QYXJ (an in-hospital prescription that has been used to treat CA for many years) treatment and 40 healthy controls (HC) in the current study. Before and after two weeks QYXJ administration, the skin microbiome of each patient was assessed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. ResultsHere, we found increased relative abundances of Staphylococcus and Lactobacillus, whereas a decreased Escherichia in CA patients relative to healthy controls (HC). Moreover, we also observed significant alpha and beta diversity differences between the CA and HC groups, and QYXJ treatment effectivity attenuated these alterations of genus level and microbial diversity in patients with CA. Importantly, further microbial interaction and function analyses revealed the significantly enriched relative abundance of Caldivirga and Streptococcus in microbial community, decreased complexity of microbial interactions and downregulated metabolic pathways in CA patients, including membrane transport, lipid metabolism and carbohydrate metabolism. Remarkably, QYXJ administration partially restored these microbiota dysbiosis, which subsequently shifts microbiomes of patients with CA towards healthy-like microbiota. ConclusionThis study further confirmed the changes of skin microbiome in CA pathogenesis and firstly revealed the protective effects of QYXJ in microbiota dysbiosis resolution, suggesting its potential role as a novel method for CA treatment.
