PUBLIC SEVERE WEATHER OUTLOOK  
NWS STORM PREDICTION CENTER NORMAN OK
0758 PM CDT SUN JUN 08 2025

...Severe thunderstorms expected over parts of the southern Plains
this evening and overnight...

* LOCATIONS...
  North Texas
  Southern Oklahoma

* HAZARDS...
  Widespread damaging winds, some hurricane force
  A couple of tornadoes
  Scattered large hail, some baseball size

* SUMMARY...
  A few tornadoes, destructive wind gusts up to 80-100 mph, and
  large to very large hail remain likely across parts of the
  southern Plains this evening and overnight. The greatest threat
  for significant severe winds should focus across north Texas and
  southern Oklahoma.

Preparedness actions...

Review your severe weather safety procedures for the possibility
of dangerous weather today. Stay tuned to NOAA Weather Radio,
weather.gov, or other media for watches and warnings. A watch
means that conditions are favorable for severe thunderstorms
over the next several hours. If a severe thunderstorm warning is
issued for your area, move to a place of safety, ideally in an 
interior room on the lowest floor of a sturdy building.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0656 AM CDT Mon Jun 09 2025

Valid 091300Z - 101200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON
OVER PORTIONS OF THE GULF COAST STATES...SOUTHEAST...TN/OH
VALLEYS...AND OVER NORTHEAST NM...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong to severe thunderstorm development appears probable
today, particularly across parts of the Ohio Valley into
Appalachians, and east of the lower Mississippi Valley into eastern
Gulf Coast states.

No changes have been made to the ongoing forecast.

...Southeast States...
An upper low is centered this morning over MN/WI, with broad
cyclonic flow across much of the eastern US.  Several ongoing
clusters of thunderstorms are ongoing this morning across from east
TX into GA, with a risk of occasional gusty winds.  A few hours of
sunshine may be sufficient for intensification of one or more of
these clusters, with damaging wind being the main concern.

...TN/OH Valleys...
A similar regime is present this morning along a cold front from
northwest OH into IL.  Scattered strong thunderstorms may develop
anywhere along the front from central PA into southeast MO.  Forcing
is weak so most storms will remain somewhat disorganized.  However,
the strongest storms will pose a risk of locally damaging wind
gusts.

...NM...
Ample low-level moisture has advected westward into
southern/east-central NM.  This combined with strong daytime heating
will encourage thunderstorm development over the mountains by mid
afternoon.  Storms will spread into the adjacent Plains by early
evening.  Mid level winds will be only marginally favorable for a
few organized/rotating cells capable of hail and gusty winds.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0347 AM CDT Mon Jun 09 2025

Valid 121200Z - 171200Z

...DISCUSSION...
Guidance remains supportive of a more active pattern across the
northern High Plains to the Upper Midwest. GEFS-based ML guidance
from SPC and NSSL depict mesoscale areas of 15 percent
probabilities, centered on eastern MT to the Dakotas. While
predictability for a specific day remains too low, the signal exists
for increasing potential during the weekend to early next week.

The initial low-amplitude shortwave trough over WY/eastern MT at 12Z
Thursday is progged to dampen as it moves east into the Upper
Midwest. An area-of-interest is evident over western SD and the NE
Panhandle on D4/Thursday afternoon, but a favorable buoyancy/shear
combination is too spatially confined for a 15 percent highlight.

A broad swath of moderate to strong mid-level southwesterlies may
persist for multiple days across the Northwest, downstream of a
large-scale trough near the West Coast. At the same time, the
expansive buoyancy plume over the central states should increase
northwestward, building higher CAPE into the northern High Plains
this weekend. Still, poor predictability persists with the
spatiotemporal details of individual shortwave impulses that may
support daily severe threats on D6-8/Saturday-Monday.

## Tropical Storm Barbara Forecast Discussion Number 5

date: 2025-06-09, from: Eastern Pacific Basin Tropical Cyclones

<pre>000
WTPZ42 KNHC 090846
TCDEP2
 
Tropical Storm Barbara Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022025
200 AM MST Mon Jun 09 2025
 
Barbara has become a bit better organized over the past 6 hours 
with a large central dense overcast and an increasing area of 
cloud tops in the -75C to -85C range.  The latest subjective Dvorak 
estimates from TAFB and SAB range from 55-65 kt, and the latest 
objective intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS range from 46-68 kt.  
Based on the improved banding and cold cloud tops, as well as the 
persistence of this organization, the initial intensity is 
increased to 60 kt for this advisory.

There is some uncertainty in the initial position since there have 
been no recent available microwave passes, but the best motion 
estimate is west-northwestward, or 295 degrees at 10 kt.  The 
global models show a strong 500 mb ridge to the north of Barbara, 
which should help maintain Barbara on a general path toward the 
west-northwest for the next few days.  The GFS model continues 
to be the fastest and farthest left model.  The GFS appears to 
have a more realistic solution compared to the ECMWF, and was 
stronger at the initialization time.  The new NHC forecast is 
slightly faster and a bit to the left of the previous official 
forecast and is in fairly good agreement with an average of the 
simple and corrected consensus models.

Barbara only has about 12 more hours to strengthen before it starts 
moving into cooler waters.  This should be enough time for Barbara 
to strengthen to a hurricane.  The cooler water should cause 
weakening to begin tonight or on Tuesday.  The dynamical hurricane 
models and global models all show Barbara weakening below tropical 
storm strength by 48 hours, and the cyclone is likely to lose its 
convection and become a remnant low around that time.  The new NHC 
forecast shows a faster weakening and quicker dissipation than the 
previous official forecast since the dynamical guidance is now in 
good agreement on this scenario.

## Tropical Storm Cosme Forecast Discussion Number 4

date: 2025-06-09, from: Eastern Pacific Basin Tropical Cyclones

WTPZ43 KNHC 090846
TCDEP3
 
Tropical Storm Cosme Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032025
200 AM MST Mon Jun 09 2025
 
The satellite presentation of Cosme has continued to gradually 
improve since the previous advisory, with sustained deep convection 
holding over the low-level center. A timely 09/0524Z ASCAT pass 
helped with the initial intensity and 34 kt wind radii estimates, 
with several wind barbs showing 40 to 45 knot winds. The latest 
subjective Dvorak intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB were T3.0/45 
knots and T2.5/35 knots respectively. Meanwhile, the objective 
Dvorak satellite estimates range from 40 to 50 knots. The initial 
intensity has been adjusted up to 45 knots with this advisory 
package, in line with the most recent ASCAT pass.

Cosme is moving toward west-northwest at 8 kt. This general motion 
is expected to continue during the next 24 hours to the south of a 
mid-level ridge, with a gradual slowing in forward speed. Tonight 
and Tuesday Barbara is forecast to erode the mid-level ridge to the 
north of Cosme, resulting in a further slowing in motion and a shift 
to the north. An increase in forward speed and a motion to the 
north-northeast is expected Tuesday night, with Cosme forecast to 
become a post-tropical remnant low on Wednesday. The latest track 
forecast is very close to that of the previous advisory and is 
generally a blend of the consensus guidance.

Environmental conditions continue to look conducive for 
strengthening of Cosme during the next 24 hours or so. Vertical wind 
shear will lighten up some while the system passes over 27/28C water 
with abundant deep layer moisture. The intensity forecast is similar 
to the previous advisory, bringing Cosme close to hurricane strength 
late today or tonight. Beyond 24 hours, vertical wind shear is 
forecast to increase and mid-level moisture is forecast to decrease, 
which should lead to a gradual weakening of Cosme. A more rapid 
weakening is then expected by Wednesday as the system moves over 
much cooler water, with Cosme expected to dissipate by 96 hours.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0159 AM CDT Mon Jun 09 2025

Valid 101200Z - 111200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will de-amplify while ejecting into the Atlantic,
while a mid-level ridge overspreads the central CONUS and a second,
low-amplitude mid-level trough impinges on the West Coast tomorrow
(Tuesday). Similar to Day 1, dry air will linger over the Southwest,
but with a weak surface wind field. Stronger flow aloft with the
West Coast trough will overspread the Cascades, promoting locally
dry and windy conditions amid drying fuels. Given the spatially
confined nature of these conditions, fire weather highlights have
been withheld.

Mesoscale Discussion 1205
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0350 PM CDT Sun Jun 08 2025

Areas affected...portions of eastern Colorado and New Mexico

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 082050Z - 082245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Large hail and severe wind threat possible this afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorm development has been ongoing across the
Front Range in Colorado and across northeastern New Mexico. The air
mass across Colorado remains under the influence of MLCIN, with
temperatures cooling with northern extend behind the surface cold
front. Moisture is also somewhat limited, with dew points in the
upper 40s to 50s. A few instances of severe hail will be possible.

Across eastern New Mexico near the dryline, a gradient of more
appreciable MLCAPE 500-1500 j/kg is in place along with deep layer
shear around 30-45 kts. Temperatures are in the mid 70s to 80s amid
dew points in the 50s to upper 60s. This may support some instances
of severe wind and hail, with at least one supercell noted on radar.
Trends will be monitored for watch potential, but it appears
unlikely at this time.

0331 PM CDT Sun Jun 08 2025

Areas affected...Portions of northern/central VA and MD

Concerning...Tornado Watch 392...

Valid 082031Z - 082200Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 392 continues.

SUMMARY...A risk for tornadoes and damaging wind gusts will persist
into early evening across northern/central Virginia, and portions of
Maryland.

DISCUSSION...Isolated storms are ongoing closer to a surface
boundary across eastern VA, and further west across the higher
terrain of central VA. These storms will continue to shift east
across a moderately unstable airmass and within 30-40 kt effective
shear. A surface boundary extending from northern VA southeast into
southeast VA will continue to support a corridor of enhanced
low-level shear supporting storm rotation. A couple tornadoes and
damaging gusts will remain possible over the next few hours.

Areas affected...portions of western Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 082030Z - 082230Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Large hail and severe wind threat may increase through the
afternoon/early evening.

DISCUSSION...Supercells have developed across the Davis Mountains in
far western Texas this afternoon. The environment in this region is
characterized by MLCAPE around 500-1500 J/kg, steep lapse rates, and
deep layer shear around 40-45 kts. This will support potential for
supercells to produce some instances of large to very large hail and
severe winds. MLCIN does increase with eastward extent, which may
limit coverage/duration of this threat. This area will be monitored
for watch potential.

Mesoscale Discussion 1202
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0317 PM CDT Sun Jun 08 2025

Areas affected...portions of southwestern and north-central
Texas...southwestern Oklahoma

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 082017Z - 082215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Large hail/tornado threat to increase through the
afternoon before a more significant wind threat emerges.

DISCUSSION...Supercell thunderstorms are ongoing across portions of
the Oklahoma and Texas Panhandles as of this hour, with at least one
tornado reported in Cimarron/Dallam counties. Additional development
is ongoing west of Amarillo. It is likely some mix of supercell
clusters will advance south and eastward through time, with
potential for additional development to occur ahead of the dryline
in New Mexico.

Low-level shear improves with southward extent into Lubbock where
surface winds are backed southeasterly improving low-level curvature
of hodographs and streamwise vorticity. It is likely that as storms
develop and move southward, the tornado threat will increase through
time even with the shifting storm mode.

A sharp gradient of extreme MLCAPE exists along the Red River near
the Texas/Oklahoma border into north-central Texas amid steep low to
mid-level lapse rates. As upscale growth increases, the potential
will rapidly increase for destructive winds (80-100 mph). A Tornado
or PDS Severe Watch is likely needed to cover this potential.

## Tropical Storm Barbara Forecast Discussion Number 3

Tropical Storm Barbara Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022025
300 PM CST Sun Jun 08 2025
 
Deep convection continues to burst over the center of Barbara this 
afternoon, with cold cloud tops near -75 C. However, a dry slot in 
the eastern semi-circle looks to have slightly disrupted the 
convective organization. Subjective and objective intensity 
estimates range from 45-55 kt this cycle. Using a blend of satellite 
estimates and the latest imagery the intensity is held at 50 kt for 
this advisory.
 
Barbara is currently within a favorable environment with warm SSTs 
and low vertical wind shear. Strengthening is forecast over the next 
day or so, and Barbara is forecast to become a hurricane overnight. 
After 24 h, the system will be moving over cooler sea surface 
temperatures below 26C and into a drier mid-level environment. These 
factors will cause the storm to weaken and eventually struggle to 
produce convection. Latest model IR simulated satellite imagery 
shows the system losing convection by 72 h.  This suggests that 
it will become a a post-tropical remnant low by that time and 
likely dissipate  by day 5 although that could occur sooner than 
currently forecast.
 
Barbara is moving west-northwestward at 295/10, steered by 
a mid-level ridge over Mexico, and this motion should continue over 
the next couple of days. The NHC forecast was nudged slightly 
rightward and lies just left of the the simple and corrected 
consensus aids.  Given the forecast track and wind radii, 
tropical-storm-force winds are not expected to affect the 
southwestern coast of Mexico. By Tuesday, the track forecast becomes 
more complicated given the potential interaction between Barbara and 
Cosme. The GFS and ECMWF are on opposite ends of the guidance 
envelope.

SUMMARY OF 300 PM CST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...16.0N 104.1W
ABOUT 205 MI...325 KM SW OF ZIHUATANEJO MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...60 MPH...95 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 295 DEGREES AT 12 MPH...19 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...996 MB...29.42 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM CST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Barbara was
located near latitude 16.0 North, longitude 104.1 West. Barbara is
moving toward the west-northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h) and this
motion is expected to continue for the next couple of days. A turn
toward the west at a slower forward speed is anticipated on Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Strengthening is expected during the next day or so, and Barbara is 
forecast to become a hurricane overnight.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 996 mb (29.42 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: RAINFALL: Outer bands of Barbara may bring total rainfall
amounts of 2 to 4 inches to coastal portions of the Mexican states
of Guerrero, Michoacan, Colima and Jalisco through Monday. This
rainfall may lead to localized areas of flooding and mudslides.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Storm Barbara, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep2.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Barbara will affect portions of the coast
of southwestern Mexico during the next few days. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
WIND: Gusty winds are likely along coastal areas of southwestern
Mexico.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 900 PM CST.

Tropical Storm Cosme Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032025
200 PM MST Sun Jun 08 2025
 
Deep convection has been increasing near the center and in curved
bands on the western side of the circulation during the past
several hours. An ASCAT-C pass from a few hours ago showed peak
winds in the 35-40 kt range, and based on that data, the depression
has been upgraded to Tropical Storm Cosme with the initial
intensity set at 40 kt.
 
Cosme will likely continue to strengthen for the next day or two as
it remains in an environment of low to moderate wind shear, abundant
moisture, and over warm SSTs. The NHC intensity forecast shows a
peak of 60 kt at 24 and 36 hours, and it wouldn't be surprising if
Cosme becomes a hurricane during that time frame. By mid-week,
however, the storm is expected to move over progressively cooler
waters and into a drier airmass, which should cause the system to
begin weakening. Cosme is now forecast to become a remnant low in 3
days and dissipate in 4 days.

The storm is moving northwestward at 7 kt, and that general motion 
is expected to continue during the next couple of days.  After that 
time, the interaction with Barbara will likely result in an initial 
slow down and then turn to the northeast. There is a fair amount of 
spread in the guidance due to the complexity of this interaction.  
The NHC track forecast has been adjusted a little to the right of 
the previous one to account for the initial motion/position and to 
be in better agreement with the latest consensus aids.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0254 PM CDT Sun Jun 08 2025

Valid 082000Z - 091200Z

...THERE IS A MODERATE RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE EASTERN
TEXAS PANHANDLE INTO SOUTHERN OKLAHOMA AND NORTHWEST/NORTH-CENTRAL
TEXAS...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS PARTS OF SOUTHERN
ALABAMA AND SOUTHERN GEORGIA...MID-ATLANTIC REGION...

...SUMMARY...
A severe weather outbreak is expected across the southern Plains
today, including southern Oklahoma and much of northwest and North
Texas. A few tornadoes, destructive wind gusts of 80-100 mph, and
giant hail up to 3-5 inches in diameter are likely. Strong wind
gusts, and perhaps a couple of tornadoes, are also possible across
portions of the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast.

...20Z Update...
With convection moving off the South Carolina coast, severe
probabilities have been reduced as robust redevelopment is not
expected this afternoon. Severe probabilities were also reduced in
parts of eastern Kansas, Missouri, and western Illinois based on the
current position of the cold front. The remainder of the forecast
remains on track. Widespread severe winds and large to very large
hail, and a few tornadoes remain possible across parts of the
southern Plains.

..Wendt.. 06/08/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1145 AM CDT Sun Jun 08 2025/

...Northwest/North Texas and Oklahoma...
A very active severe-weather day is expected including a regional
outbreak of severe storms. The potential exists for very large hail
and a few tornadoes this afternoon, with widespread damaging
winds/derecho potentially developing into this evening and
overnight, especially across much of North Texas and southern
Oklahoma.

Broad west-northwesterly flow is present today across the
central/southern Plains, with a surface cold front sagging southward
across Kansas. Ahead of the front, a very moist boundary-layer air
mass is in place across much of Oklahoma/Texas, with dewpoints in
the upper 60s and lower 70s. Ample daytime heating and near
dry-adiabatic low/mid-level lapse rates will yield a large reservoir
of extremely high CAPE values across western Oklahoma and northwest
Texas. See Mesoscale Discussion 1196 for additional short-term
details.  

Rapid development of intense thunderstorms will ensue by mid/late
afternoon along the cold front over western Oklahoma and along a
complex dryline structure over the eastern Texas Panhandle. Strong
deep layer shear will support intense supercells, despite rather
weak low-level winds. Very large hail, damaging winds, and a few
tornadoes will be possible as these storms track southeastward
across western/central Oklahoma and toward western North Texas,
likely congealing into one or more prominent bowing MCSs.

The risk of widespread destructive winds will increase through the
evening as the potentially prominent linear convective system
organizes/gradually accelerates east-southeastward across southern
Oklahoma and North Texas. At least some lingering damaging
wind/embedded tornado potential may reach as far east-southeast as
the ArkLaTex and ArkLaMiss late tonight.

...Mid-Atlantic States...
A shortwave trough currently over Ohio will track eastward today,
with large-scale ascent overspreading the Mid-Atlantic states by
afternoon. A moist surface air mass is present across much of
VA/MD/NC and vicinity with dewpoints in the upper 60s.  Persistent
clouds and weak mid-level lapse rates will limit destabilization. 
However, it appears likely that storms will develop off the Blue
Ridge by mid afternoon and spread eastward toward the coast. 
Forecast soundings show sufficient low and deep layer shear for
supercell structures capable of damaging wind gusts and perhaps a
few tornadoes.

...Southeast...
Clusters of storms will move across the region with mostly a wind
damage risk, perhaps most certain and most focused across coastal
portions of South Carolina into southern North Carolina through
mid-afternoon.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0224 PM CDT Sun Jun 08 2025

Valid 101200Z - 111200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ALONG THE EAST
COAST...OVER PARTS OF CENTRAL MT...AND FROM THE SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS
THROUGH CENTRAL TX INTO SOUTHERN LA...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms are possible on Tuesday into Tuesday
evening along parts of the East Coast, from southeast New Mexico to
south Louisiana, and along the lee of the Montana Rockies.

...East Coast...
Upper troughing is expected to extend from central Ontario through
the TN Valley early Tuesday morning, with moderate mid-level
southwesterly flow throughout its eastern periphery from the central
Appalachians through the Northeast. Expectation is for this
troughing to progress eastward during the day as an embedded
shortwave trough moves through the Upper OH Valley and Lower Great
Lakes. An associated surface low will move just ahead of this
shortwave, with an attendant cold front moving through the
Mid-Atlantic. 

Severe potential across the region should be confined to the late
morning and afternoon period ahead of the weakening cold front. The
strongest shear will be displaced north of the higher buoyancy,
somewhat limiting the overall severe potential. Even so, there
should still be enough overlap for isolated severe storms,
particularly across southeast VA and eastern NC. Isolated damaging
wind gusts are the primary risk. 

...Lower MS Valley across the TX Coastal Plains into the TX Hill
Country...
A composite cold front/outflow boundary will likely extend from
west-central LA to the Edwards Plateau early Tuesday morning. A
convectively generated vorticity maximum may also be over central
TX, although uncertainty regarding the strength and location of this
vorticity maximum is high at this forecast range. The presence of a
vorticity maximum potentially in close proximity to the weak surface
boundary complicates the overall forecast, since both features could
provide the lift needed for convective initiation. However,
mesoscale nature of these features as well as their interactions
limits predictability. At this point, thunderstorms appear possible
and conditions suggest some would be strong/severe. Higher severe
probabilities may be needed in future outlooks as predictability
increases. 

...Southeast NM and Far West TX...
Strong heating and deep boundary-layer mixing is anticipated over
the region on Tuesday. However, moderate/strong low-level moisture
advection will help offset low-level mixing, allowing for dewpoints
to remain in the low to mid 60s. Resulting combination of steep
mid-level lapse rates and low-level moisture will support late
afternoon airmass destabilization and strong buoyancy. A
low-amplitude shortwave trough will be approaching the region, with
lift ahead of this wave combining with low-level convergence along
the dryline to support thunderstorm initiation. Environmental
conditions support supercells capable of large to very large hail
initially, with some wind gust threat as well. Overall coverage is
uncertain, which merits keeping low severe probabilities for this
outlook.  

...Lee of the MT Rockies...
Upper ridging is forecast to dampen throughout the period, with 
the mid to upper-level flow becoming more westerly. A weak vorticity
maximum will move through this westerly flow, augmenting orographic
ascent and helping to aid thunderstorm development across the high
terrain. Moderate speed shear should result in a couple
lower-end/high-based supercells as storms develop off the
higher terrain of western to south-central MT. Weak buoyancy 
suggests that marginally severe hail and locally strong gusts should
be the main threats.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1229 PM CDT Sun Jun 08 2025

Valid 091200Z - 101200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE SOUTHEAST
STATES INTO THE TN AND OH VALLEYS...AND ACROSS THE SOUTHERN HIGH
PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered damaging winds, a couple tornadoes, and isolated severe
hail are possible across the Southeast into the Upper Ohio Valley on
Monday into Monday evening.

...Mid-South/Lower MS Valley into the Southeast...
While there is some uncertainty regarding the intensity/organization
and location of the overnight MCS early Monday morning, the general
consensus within the guidance places its associated vorticity max
and surface low over the eastern vicinity. Expectation is then for
this low and vorticity max to continue eastward into the moist and
moderately buoyant airmass downstream across the Southeast.
Thunderstorms appear likely in the vicinity of these features,
including well downstream during the afternoon as boundary layer
destabilizes and along the trailing composite outflow that will
likely maintain its integrity. Damaging gusts will be the primary
risk, particularly across central MS/AL where a corridor of greater
severe potential may materialize. Uncertainty (primarily related to
limited predictability of the system's speed) in this corridor
remains too high to outline any higher probabilities with this
outlook, but an upgrade may be needed in later outlooks.

...OH/TN Valleys...
A plume of moderate to high PWs is forecast extend along the frontal
zone from the Mid-South northeastward through the middle OH Valley
Monday morning. A shortwave trough is expected to progress through
the base of a stacked cyclone moving from the  Upper Midwest into
the Upper Great Lakes. This shortwave will encourage an eastward
push to the cold front, while also contributing to strengthening
mid-level flow across the region. The stronger winds will likely be
confined to the mid/upper OH Valley, and mostly behind the front,
with the most likely area of some overlap over OH and PA. However,
this region will be displaced north of the better buoyancy, which is
anticipated farther south over KY and TN. This displacement should
temper the overall storm severity, but occasionally strong to severe
are still possible throughout this entire corridor. Scattered
damaging winds will be the primary risk, although lower-probability
tornado and isolated severe hail risks also exist.

...Southern High Plains...
The airmass across the region will likely begin the period behind
the outflow of an extensive overnight MCS. However, these relatively
cool and dry conditions are expected to modify quickly amid strong
heating. A sharpening lee trough will also encourage backing
low-level flow throughout the day, from northerly to easterly (or
even southeasterly), with some low-level moisture advection
possible. These factors could allow convection that initially
develops over the higher terrain to persist eastward/southeastward
into more of the High Plains, with an attendant threat for strong
gusts. The modifying outflow could act as a favorable corridor for
forward propagation and increase damaging gust potential during the
evening.

...Southwest/Central/Southeast TX...
The outflow of an extensive overnight MCS will likely arc from
northern LA through central TX into southwest TX early Monday
morning. Isolated thunderstorms are possible along this boundary as
it gradually shifts southward throughout the day. Highest
thunderstorm coverage is expected across southeast TX, with warm
low/mid-levels and associated capping should limit the overall
thunderstorm coverage westward. Isolated hail and damaging gusts are
possible with any storms that develop.

...Northwest TX...
Isolated elevated convection may form with weak low-level warm
theta-e advection north of the front on Monday. Sufficient effective
bulk shear and elevated buoyancy may exist for a few storms capable
of severe hail.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1149 AM CDT Sun Jun 08 2025

Valid 081700Z - 091200Z

...17z Update...
No changes, dry post-frontal conditions are likely across parts of
eastern Montana and the western Dakotas this afternoon. Fuels
farther south are not overly receptive, but surface wind gusts of
25-30 mph with RH near 20-25% will support several hours of elevated
fire-weather potential. See the previous discussion for more info.

..Lyons.. 06/08/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0130 AM CDT Sun Jun 08 2025/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will deepen across the central and eastern CONUS
as a mid-level ridge builds over the western U.S. today. Rich
low-level moisture will overspread most of the CONUS east of the
Rockies, with scattered to widespread thunderstorms expected,
mitigating significant wildfire-spread concerns over most locales.
The one exception will be over parts of the northern High Plains.
Widespread 15-25 mph sustained northwesterly surface winds are
likely in a post-cold frontal regime, where RH may dip into the
15-25 percent range. Given modestly dry fine fuels present, Elevated
highlights have been maintained. 

Elsewhere across the Desert Southwest into the Great Basin, a dry
and mixed boundary layer should support widespread lower RH.
However, the lack of a stronger surface wind field suggests that
fire weather highlights are not currently warranted.

1145 AM CDT Sun Jun 08 2025

Valid 081630Z - 091200Z

...THERE IS A MODERATE RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE EASTERN
TEXAS PANHANDLE INTO SOUTHERN OKLAHOMA AND NORTHWEST/NORTH-CENTRAL
TEXAS...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
MID-ATLANTIC/SOUTHEAST STATES...

...SUMMARY...
A severe weather outbreak is expected across the southern Plains
today, including southern Oklahoma and much of northwest and North
Texas. A few tornadoes, destructive wind gusts of 80-100 mph, and
giant hail up to 3-5 inches in diameter are likely. Strong wind
gusts, and perhaps a couple of tornadoes, are also possible across
portions of the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast.

...Northwest/North Texas and Oklahoma...
A very active severe-weather day is expected including a regional
outbreak of severe storms. The potential exists for very large hail
and a few tornadoes this afternoon, with widespread damaging
winds/derecho potentially developing into this evening and
overnight, especially across much of North Texas and southern
Oklahoma.

Broad west-northwesterly flow is present today across the
central/southern Plains, with a surface cold front sagging southward
across Kansas. Ahead of the front, a very moist boundary-layer air
mass is in place across much of Oklahoma/Texas, with dewpoints in
the upper 60s and lower 70s. Ample daytime heating and near
dry-adiabatic low/mid-level lapse rates will yield a large reservoir
of extremely high CAPE values across western Oklahoma and northwest
Texas. See Mesoscale Discussion 1196 for additional short-term
details.  

Rapid development of intense thunderstorms will ensue by mid/late
afternoon along the cold front over western Oklahoma and along a
complex dryline structure over the eastern Texas Panhandle. Strong
deep layer shear will support intense supercells, despite rather
weak low-level winds. Very large hail, damaging winds, and a few
tornadoes will be possible as these storms track southeastward
across western/central Oklahoma and toward western North Texas,
likely congealing into one or more prominent bowing MCSs.

The risk of widespread destructive winds will increase through the
evening as the potentially prominent linear convective system
organizes/gradually accelerates east-southeastward across southern
Oklahoma and North Texas. At least some lingering damaging
wind/embedded tornado potential may reach as far east-southeast as
the ArkLaTex and ArkLaMiss late tonight.

...Mid-Atlantic States...
A shortwave trough currently over Ohio will track eastward today,
with large-scale ascent overspreading the Mid-Atlantic states by
afternoon. A moist surface air mass is present across much of
VA/MD/NC and vicinity with dewpoints in the upper 60s.  Persistent
clouds and weak mid-level lapse rates will limit destabilization. 
However, it appears likely that storms will develop off the Blue
Ridge by mid afternoon and spread eastward toward the coast. 
Forecast soundings show sufficient low and deep layer shear for
supercell structures capable of damaging wind gusts and perhaps a
few tornadoes.

...Southeast...
Clusters of storms will move across the region with mostly a wind
damage risk, perhaps most certain and most focused across coastal
portions of South Carolina into southern North Carolina through
mid-afternoon.

## Tropical Storm Barbara Forecast Discussion Number 1

Tropical Storm Barbara Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022025
300 AM CST Sun Jun 08 2025
 
Showers and thunderstorms have become better organized in 
association with an area of low pressure located offshore of 
southwestern Mexico. A small, persistent area of deep convection has 
been observed in satellite images tonight, and recent scatterometer 
data confirm this has led to the formation of a well-defined, closed 
low-level circulation. Therefore, the NHC is starting advisories on 
Tropical Storm Barbara with an initial intensity of 40 kt based on 
the earlier scatterometer winds.

Barbara is currently within a moist and relatively low shear 
environment over warm waters. So, strengthening is expected during 
the next day or so, and this could occur quickly given recent 
satellite trends and the small size of the storm. The official NHC 
forecast shows Barbara becoming a hurricane in 24 h, which is 
supported by HAFS-A/B and the HFIP corrected consensus (HCCA). The 
window for strengthening is brief, as Barbara is forecast to move 
over cooler waters and into a drier mid-level environment by 48 h. 
This should disrupt the convective structure of the storm and result 
in weakening. By day 5, the remnant low of Barbara is forecast to 
either dissipate or become absorbed by the circulation of EP91.

Barbara is moving west-northwestward (295/10 kt) on the south side 
of a mid-level ridge, and this motion should continue over the next 
couple of days. For this time period, the NHC forecast generally 
lies near or between the simple and corrected consensus aids. Given 
the forecast track and wind radii, tropical-storm-force winds 
are not expected to affect the southwestern coast of Mexico. By 
Tuesday, the track forecast becomes more complicated given the 
potential for binary interaction between Barbara and another 
disturbance (EP91) with a high chance of formation. Because of this, 
the long-range track forecast could be subject to larger future 
adjustments depending on the evolution of EP91.

MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...45 MPH...75 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 295 DEGREES AT 12 MPH...19 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1001 MB...29.56 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 AM CST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Barbara was 
located near latitude 15.2 North, longitude 102.4 West. Barbara is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h), and this 
motion is expected to continue for the next couple of days. A turn 
toward the west at a slower forward speed is anticipated on Tuesday.
 
Satellite-derived wind data indicate that maximum sustained winds 
are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts. Strengthening is 
forecast during the next day or so, and Barbara is forecast to 
become a hurricane on Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches, with localized amounts
up to 6 inches, are possible across portions of the Mexican states
of Guerrero, Michoacan, Colima, and Jalisco through Monday. This
rainfall may lead to areas of flooding and mudslides.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Storm Barbara, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep2.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Barbara will affect portions of the coast
of southwestern Mexico during the next few days. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
