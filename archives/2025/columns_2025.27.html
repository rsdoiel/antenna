Also by ourselves. This kind of on-site discovery and mentorship gave us
stone tools, cave art, clothing, shelter, writing, engineering,
construction on every scale, and great artists in every age. Writing was
involved, mostly of the scribal kind before the Gutenberg Parenthesis
began. After that, […]</p>

<h2 id="systemd-timers-for-the-butlerian-jihad">2025-07-09 systemd
timers for the Butlerian Jihad</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-09, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2025-07-09-systemd-timers-for-the-butlerian-jihad">
2025-07-09 systemd timers for the Butlerian Jihad
</h1>
<p>
I was reading a post about the good parts of systemd
(<a href="https://blog.tjll.net/the-systemd-revolution-has-been-a-success/">systemd
has been a complete, utter, unmitigated success</a>) and started
wondering about the use of timers instead of cron jobs.
</p>
<p>
The benefits:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
each job is a complete script
</li>
<li>
each job can be sandboxed
</li>
<li>
each job has output in the log instead of mailing it to me
</li>
</ul>
<p>
And if every job is a complete script, then I can also add more stuff,
like lowering the limits if load starts to overshoot again.
</p>
<p>
So here we go.
</p>
<p>
I have three jobs:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
watch-active-autonomous-systems
</li>
<li>
watch-expensive-end-points
</li>
<li>
watch-nobots
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Each of them gets a service and a timer.
</p>
<p>
Since I wanted the service to protect a good part of the system, I had
to move things around a bit.
</p>
<h2 id="asncounter">
<code>asncounter</code>
</h2>
<p>
I had to install
<a href="https://gitlab.com/anarcat/asncounter/">asncounter</a> in
<code>/usr/local</code>. Since I already had a copy of it all I just
moved things around, but things to work out next time, my
<code>root</code> user has <code>PIPX_HOME</code> set to
<code>/usr/local/pipx</code>. This is very messy. I hope that
<code>asncounter</code> makes it into Debian, soon. ❤️
</p>
<p>
So:
</p>
<pre><code>mv ~/.local/pipx /usr/local
</code></pre>
<p>
I also edited the first line of <code>asncounter</code> to read as
follows:
</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/local/pipx/venvs/asncounter/bin/python
</code></pre>
<h2 id="etc-butlerian-jihad">
<code>/etc/butlerian-jihad</code>
</h2>
<p>
I created this directory for the scripts and its dependencies.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="/admin/2h-access-log">2h-access-log</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="/admin/asn-networks">asn-networks</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I also create a <code>data</code> directory here for the
<code>pyasn</code> data. This is not the default location so we must
always pass <code>–cache-directory /etc/butlerian-jihad/data</code> when
running <code>asncounter</code>.
</p>
<h2 id="scripts">
scripts
</h2>
<p>
The three scripts all exclude some more IP numbers in their call to
<code>2h-access-log</code> (my home IP numbers, my server’s IP numbers)
so I don’t accidentally ban myself, as well as the <code>social</code>
subdomain which is where my fedi instance is.

Each script gets a service file. I’m only going to post
<code>watch-active-autonomous-systems.service</code>. The only thing
that changes from service to service is the <code>Description</code> and
the <code>ExecStart</code> naming the script to run.

<p>
Each script gets a timer file. I’m only going to post one of them. The
only thing that changes from service to service is the
<code>Description</code> as by default the timer applies for the service
with the same name. Win!
</p>
<p>
I’m adding a <code>RandomizedDelaySec</code> of two minutes, hoping that
over time the three timers will start to diverge.

<h2 id="teaching-chatgpt-how-to-work-with-me">Teaching ChatGPT how to
work with me</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-09, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Earlier I wrote this post:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The worst thing about Claude and ChatGPT is that you can’t get them to
work with you the way you want them to. They always run off and
<i>do</i> the things I asked about. So if I say “what if the middle
column must be at least 600 pixels wide? What I want is literally an
answer to the question I asked. It was not an instruction to do it. I’ve
been a CEO, and this infuriates me. I want to understand the limits are,
I don’t want to impose them. I’m trying to figure out what the cost
would be in doing something, again – not requesting it be done. No
matter how many times I tell it not to do this, it just does it. And
Claude has absolutely no memory. If I want it to work with me a certain
way I have to tell it how to do it every time. I can save it off in a
document, but even the simplest automation is impossible. In that sense
it is very primitive software. If I were using a spreadsheet for
example, I’d have settings that I could change, and unless the software
had a bug it would never forget it until I told it otherwise.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Because it can be so stubborn and uncooperative, I often try to solve
complicated problems myself. Then I decided to try again, and brought a
problem to ChatGPT and we did eventually figure it out, but at the end I
wanted to review how inefficient the process was because it doesn’t look
all around at the options, I had to do that for it, and it wasn’t even
aware it needed that kind of help. After exploring this, I asked if it
would remember what we concluded, and this is what came back.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
You want me to think first, not code.
</li>
<li>
You want me to challenge assumptions, including my own.
</li>
<li>
You expect me to give up on a theory when the evidence contradicts it,
and look for more plausible explanations.
</li>
<li>
You’re a deeply experienced debugger (almost 50 years), and you know how
important it is to notice the obvious.
</li>
<li>
You’re not here for code generation — you’re here for sharp,
collaborative thinking.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
When I said that was worth publishing on my blog, it proceeded to muddy
it up, even trying to write in my voice. I insisted that the list it
came up with was perfect.
</p>
<p>
Feel free to steal these bullet points and feed them to your ChatGPT. I
think it can be made to work much better for us humans. ;-)

<h1 id="2025-07-03-fail2ban-some-more">

<p>
This is a continuation of <a href="2025-06-16-ban-asn">2025-06-16 Ban
autonomous systems</a>.
</p>
<p>
I kept wondering why the “recidive” jail never found any repeated
offenders from the “butlerian-jihad” jail. I think I know why, now. The
“recidive” jail uses the following:
</p>
<pre><code>failregex = ^%(__prefix_line)s(?:\s*fail2ban\.actions\s*%(__pid_re)s?:\s+)?NOTICE\s+\[(?!%(_jailname)s\])(?:.*)\]\s+Ban\s+&lt;HOST&gt;\s*$
</code></pre>
<p>
Far to the right, it uses <code>HOST</code> and that only matches a
single IP number. If you examine the regular expression generated and
scroll over far enough to the right, you’ll see the named groups
<code>&lt;ip4&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;ip6&gt;</code>.
</p>
<pre><code># fail2ban-client get recidive failregex
The following regular expression are defined:
`- [0]: ^(?:\[\])?\s*(?:&lt;[^.]+\.[^.]+&gt;\s+)?(?:\S+\s+)?(?:kernel:\s?\[ *\d+\.\d+\]:?\s+)?(?:@vserver_\S+\s+)?(?:(?:(?:\[\d+\])?:\s+[\[\(]?(?:fail2ban(?:-server|\.actions)\s*)(?:\(\S+\))?[\]\)]?:?|[\[\(]?(?:fail2ban(?:-server|\.actions)\s*)(?:\(\S+\))?[\]\)]?:?(?:\[\d+\])?:?)\s+)?(?:\[ID \d+ \S+\]\s+)?(?:\s*fail2ban\.actions\s*(?:\[\d+\])?:\s+)?NOTICE\s+\[(?!recidive\])(?:.*)\]\s+Ban\s+(?:\[?(?:(?:::f{4,6}:)?(?P&lt;ip4&gt;(?:\d{1,3}\.){3}\d{1,3})|(?P&lt;ip6&gt;(?:[0-9a-fA-F]{1,4}::?|::){1,7}(?:[0-9a-fA-F]{1,4}|(?&lt;=:):)))\]?|(?P&lt;dns&gt;[\w\-.^_]*\w))\s*$
</code></pre>
<p>
I decided to create an additional jail.
</p>
<p>
In my own <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/alex.conf</code> I added a second
jail:
</p>
<pre><code>[butlerian-jihad]
enabled = true
bantime = 1h

[butlerian-jihad-week]
logpath = /var/log/fail2ban.log
enabled = true
findtime = 1d
bantime = 1w
maxretry = 5
</code></pre>
<p>
The first one uses the filter
<code>/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/butlerian-jihad.conf</code> which remains
empty. Remember, entries are added to this jail via a cron job discussed
in an <a href="2025-06-16-ban-asn">earlier post</a>.
</p>
<pre><code>[Definition]
</code></pre>
<p>
The second one uses a new filter
<code>/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/butlerian-jihad-week.conf</code> defining
the date pattern and the regular expression to detect “failures” (i.e. a
hit).
</p>
<pre><code>[Init]

[Definition]
failregex = NOTICE\s+\[butlerian-jihad\] Ban &lt;SUBNET&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
The important part is that this uses <code>&lt;SUBNET&gt;</code> instead
of <code>&lt;HOST&gt;</code>. If you scroll over to the right, you’ll
find a new <code>&lt;cidr&gt;</code> group:
</p>
<pre><code># fail2ban-client get butlerian-jihad-week failregex
The following regular expression are defined:
`- [0]: NOTICE\s+\[butlerian-jihad\] Ban \[?(?:(?:::f{4,6}:)?(?P&lt;ip4&gt;(?:\d{1,3}\.){3}\d{1,3})|(?P&lt;ip6&gt;(?:[0-9a-fA-F]{1,4}::?|::){1,7}(?:[0-9a-fA-F]{1,4}|(?&lt;=:):)))(?:/(?P&lt;cidr&gt;\d+))?\]?
</code></pre>
<p>
And it seems to be working.
</p>

<img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-03-fail2ban-some-more-1.jpg" alt="The Munin graph shows how the butlerian-jihad-week jail immediately jumps to 3000 members" />
</p>
<p>
I had to restart this particular jail a few times. Using
<code>–unban</code> makes sense because those deserving of a new ban
will be discovered immediately as the <code>findtime</code> was set to
one day up above.
</p>
<pre><code>fail2ban-client restart --unban butlerian-jihad-week

<strong>2025-07-05</strong>. Two days later.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-03-fail2ban-some-more-2.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
<strong>2025-07-06</strong>. Hm. I made a change to Emacs Wiki search,
hoping to get rid of the DuckDuckGo dependency:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
I made the page title match much more prominent
</li>
<li>
I switched the search from GET to POST
</li>
<li>
I count the search via GET as a bot (since it’s no longer doable via the
user interface)
</li>
<li>
I reinstated the old full-text search (essentially a grep within Perl)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I was hoping that it would have very little effect. At about the same
time, however, load started creeping up. The question is whether this is
caused by so many search requests or not. There aren’t many search
requests in the logs, and the process monitors don’t show unusually
activity for the Emacs Wiki processes. Therefore, I think the answer is
that the problem lies elsewhere. But where?
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-03-fail2ban-some-more-3.jpg" alt="Somewhere around the 3rd of July load minimum seems to raise up from 0.5 to 1.0" />
</p>
<p>
This virtual server has two cores so load should remain below 2.0,
ideally.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-03-fail2ban-some-more-4.jpg" alt="Somewhere around the 3rd of July the number of hosts banned for a week goes up from 2000 to more than 7000" />
</p>
<p>
Is it the processing of all the bans? I don’t think so, since the
firewall had many thousands of banned networks before.
</p>
<p>
Is it the extra cron jobs monitoring the logs? I don’t think so because
there’s no 15min or 20min periodicity to see.
</p>
<p>
And note how load does come back down to 0.5 for a very short moment
around midnight from the 4th to the 5th and in the early morning hours
of the 6th.
</p>
<p>
How strange.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2025-07-07</strong>. Maybe just a fluke. I mean, if these
defences actually worked the way I’d want them to, then an actual attack
would feel like a fluke, right? 😄
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-03-fail2ban-some-more-5.jpg" alt="The load graph shows that the current value is 0.5 although the average is still 1.6." />
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-03-fail2ban-some-more-6.jpg" alt="Also of note: The number of banned-for-a-week IP numbers and networks is up to 7900." />
</p>
<p>
<strong>2025-07-08</strong>. And just now I found out the hard way that
things weren’t working as well as they ought to.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-03-fail2ban-some-more-7.jpg" alt="Around 18:00 Munin just stops working." />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-03-fail2ban-some-more-8.jpg" alt="Load was over 140 when I checked in." />
</p>
<p>
I had over 80 processes attempting to serve Community Wiki requests.
</p>
<p>
In the last two hours, I had 6629 requests and 3939 of them were for
dynamically generated Recent Changes and RSS feeds.
</p>
<p>
For example:
</p>
<pre><code># 2h-access-log ^community | egrep 'action=(rss|rc)' | log-request | head
/wiki?action=rss&amp;all=0&amp;days=3&amp;full=1&amp;rcfilteronly=%22WebDavVsFtp%22&amp;showedit=1

/wiki?action=rc&amp;all=0&amp;days=14&amp;rcidonly=TranslationProject&amp;showedit=1
</code></pre>
<p>
Once I had confirmed that the victim was
<code>/home/alex/communitywiki2.pl</code>, I killed them all:
</p>
<pre><code>for pid in (ps aux|grep communitywiki2|awk '{print $2}'); echo $pid; kill -9 $pid; end
</code></pre>
<p>
Also stopped respawns:
</p>
<pre><code>monit stop communitywiki
</code></pre>
<p>
All right, time to launch some scripts.
</p>
<p>
1180 new entries, banned!
</p>
<p>
Another 553 banned.
</p>
<p>
And 1305 more.
</p>
<p>
Hm, strange. 🤔 Why aren’t they all banned in one go? Ah! I think I see:
<code>asncounter</code> only prints the top 10 autonomous systems by
default!
</p>
<p>
So I’m going to add a new line to my
<code>/etc/cron.d/butlerian-jihad</code>, all on one line, with
appropriate time expressions, excluding my own IP numbers, just in case,
and so on. You know the drill.
</p>
<pre><code># watch other expensive end-points
/root/bin/2h-access-log !^social \
| egrep 'action=(rss|rc)\&amp;' \
| awk '{print $2}' \
| /root/bin/asncounter --no-prefixes --top 50 2&gt;/dev/null \
| awk '/^[0-9]/ &amp;&amp; $1&gt;30 { print $3 }' \
| ifne xargs /root/bin/asn-networks \
| ifne xargs fail2ban-client set butlerian-jihad banip &gt; /dev/null
</code></pre>
<p>
Now if only Munin would start graphing again. Looking at
<code>/var/log/munin/munin-update.log</code> I guess I need to <code>rm
/var/run/munin/munin-update.lock</code>. Let’s see if that helps. 😄
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-03-fail2ban-some-more-9.jpg" alt="Nearly 3000 entries added to the short-term butlerian-jihad jail (1 hour ban)." />
</p>
<p>
Sadly, load started climbing again. 40. 50. In total, 44 processes were
trying to serve Community Wiki.
</p>
<p>
The banning by autonomous system doesn’t seem all that efficient any
more. Looking at the last 20 suspicious entries for Community Wiki and
seeing that each one is from a different autonomous system.

<p>
I’ve decided to lower the limit from 30 down to 10 expensive requests
per ASN! 🫣
</p>
<p>
And with that, 6922 networks are now banned.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2025-07-09</strong>. As I was trying to start my netnews client
(<code>tin</code>), I got a message saying that it wouldn’t connect to
the server as load was too high (over 17). Wow! Now here’s a client that
respects the server’s needs!
</p>
<p>
I lowered my limit from 10 to 5 and manually ran my command without
waiting for the cron job:
</p>
<pre><code>2h-access-log !^social $MY_IP_NUMBERS \
| egrep '\baction=(rss|rc)\&amp;|\bsearch=' \
| awk '{print $2}' \
| /root/bin/asncounter --top 50 --no-prefixes 2&gt;/dev/null \
| awk '/^[0-9]/ &amp;&amp; $1&gt;5 { print $3 }' \
| ifne xargs /root/bin/asn-networks \
| ifne xargs fail2ban-client set butlerian-jihad banip
</code></pre>
<p>
Ran it a while ago: 2187 banned. Ran it again just now: 430 banned.
</p>
<p>
The distribution was very international. My limit goes against that
first number, the count.

<h2 id="why-i-want-rss-activitypub">Why I want RSS ==&gt;
ActivityPub</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-09, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I’ve been asked by a number of people why I want a bridge from RSS to
ActivityPub. Fair question. Here’s why.
</p>
<p>
WordPress has demonstrated that most of the features of the web in
regard to documents also work in Mastodon, via ActivityPub.
</p>
<p>
To demonstrate here’s a
<a href="https://daveverse.org/2025/07/09/example-of-a-wordpress-post-in-mastodon/">WordPress
post</a>, and because there is a bridge between it and ActivityPub, you
can read the same post
<a href="https://mastodon.social/@scripting@daveverse.org/114823624237979477">in
Mastodon</a>, which also supports ActivityPub.
</p>
<p>
To really nail that down:
<a href="https://daveverse.org/2025/07/09/example-of-a-wordpress-post-in-mastodon/">WordPress
version</a>,
<a href="https://mastodon.social/@scripting@daveverse.org/114823624237979477">Mastodon
version</a>.
</p>
<p>
Pretty remarkable, yes?
</p>
<p>
Here’s a list of the features I was using in that demo.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The post has a title (it’s optional).
</li>
<li>
Simple styling: bold, italic, numbered lists, bulleted lists.
</li>
<li>
Hyperlinks, the defining feature of the web.
</li>
<li>
I can edit my post.
</li>
<li>
No character limit.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
These are most of the features of
<a href="https://textcasting.org/">textcasting</a>, a spec I published
in 2022 to list the features of the web I wanted from the twitter-like
services, that call themselves part of the web, which is fairly
dishonest because they don’t support most of the basic features of the
web. But Mastodon <i>does</i> support them.
</p>
<p>
But so far they are only accessible via WordPress. And as much as I love
WordPress, and am thankful it exists, that is not enough.
</p>
<p>
So here’s the punchline: Why I want the RSS to ActivityPub bridge.
</p>
<p>
As a developer, I can easily create apps that generate RSS feeds. I just
want Mastodon to understand those feeds as well as they understand
WordPress. And that means <b>we need a bridge for developers that
supports all these features.</b>
</p>
<p>
Hope that helps! :-)

<h1 id="2025-06-16-ban-autonomous-systems">
2025-06-16 Ban autonomous systems
</h1>
<p>
More people have been working on blocking whole ranges of IP numbers,
since that catches hosting providers that give bots access to the whole
range they control. The bots switch IP numbers all the time so a filter
based on IP numbers won’t catch them. But if we can determine their
autonomous system number (ASN), we can not only block an IP number
range, we can block all the IP number rangers the ASN controls.
</p>
<p>
Now, since these hosting providers also host nice things like other
fediverse instances, I don’t want to block them forever. I want to block
them for 10min, and if they continue after a few of these shorter
blocks, I want to block them for a week. Hopefully, their clients have
ended their Internet slurping and things are back to normal. This is how
fail2ban works, but only for individual IP numbers.
</p>
<p>
I want code that bridges this gap.

Where to start

<p>
<a href="github.com/WKnak/fail2ban-bloc">fail2ban-bloc</a> tries to
guess (!) IP ranges and bans those using fail2ban. I need to investigate
more.
</p>
<p>
I’m still fascinated by
<a href="https://anarc.at/blog/2025-05-30-asncounter/">asncounter</a>.
It might even work without logfiles, using <code>tcpdump</code>! For
now, it generates an interesting Top 10 list. What’s interesting about
it is that it doesn’t require me to query an external service and leak
IP numbers.
</p>
<p>
I used to have the following fish function, for example:
</p>
<pre><code>function asn
    for ip in $argv
        dig +short (string split '.' $ip|tac -|string join '.').origin.asn.cymru.com. TXT
    end
end
</code></pre>
<p>
What I don’t want to do is write another tool like
<a href="/admin/network-lookup-lean">network-lookup-lean</a> which uses
<code>asn.routeviews.org</code> for the same purposes, caches results,
and so on. I want to get rid of this live lookup.

<h2 id="ban-all-the-networks-managed-by-an-asn">
Ban all the networks managed by an ASN
</h2>
<p>
I’m going to use <code>ipset</code> to use two lists,
<code>banlist</code> and <code>banlist6</code>. I use these two for
<a href="/admin/ban-cidr">ban-cidr</a>, too.
</p>
<pre><code># Use hash:net because of the CIDR stuff
ipset create banlist hash:net
iptables -I INPUT -m set --match-set banlist src -j DROP
iptables -I FORWARD -m set --match-set banlist src -j DROP

ipset create banlist6 hash:net family inet6
ip6tables -I INPUT -m set --match-set banlist6 src -j DROP
ip6tables -I FORWARD -m set --match-set banlist6 src -j DROP
</code></pre>
<p>
To ban all the IP ranges an ASN manages, I created the following little
fish function using <code>ip.guide</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>function asn-ban
    for asn in $argv
        for cidr in (curl -sL &quot;https://ip.guide/as$asn&quot; | jq --raw-output '.routes.v4[]')
            echo ipset add banlist $cidr
        end
        for cidr in (curl -sL &quot;https://ip.guide/as$asn&quot; | jq --raw-output '.routes.v6[]')
            echo ipset add banlist6 $cidr
        end
    end
end
</code></pre>
<p>
Let’s try it with the ASN 45899!
</p>
<pre><code>asn-ban 45899 | sh
netfilter-persistent save
</code></pre>
<p>
For more about <code>netfilter-persistent save</code> see the comments
on <a href="2025-01-23-bots-devouring-the-web">2025-01-23 The bots are
at it again</a>.
</p>
<p>
When I ran the <code>asn-ban</code> command above, I noticed that I got
a single “it’s already added” response. Before adding the same numbers
to my shell script, therefore:
</p>
<pre><code>for cidr in (asn-ban 45899|awk '{print $4}'); if grep -q $cidr bin/admin/ban-cidr; echo $cidr; end; end
</code></pre>
<p>
That told me I had to remove <code>14.187.96.0/20</code> from my script.
Once this is done:
</p>
<pre><code>echo (echo &quot;#&quot;; date --iso)  &gt;&gt; bin/admin/ban-cidr
asn-ban 45899 &gt;&gt; bin/admin/ban-cidr 
</code></pre>
<p>
I really need to figure out how to manage this smartly. And I need to
figure out a way to unban the whole list!
</p>
<h2 id="integration-with-fail2ban">
Integration with <code>fail2ban</code>
</h2>
<p>
Let’s start with <code>fail2ban</code>. I need a jail! Every jail needs
a filter!
</p>
<p>
In <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/alex.conf</code> (this is where I maintain
all my jails) I added:
</p>
<pre><code>[butlerian-jihad]
enabled = true
bantime = 1d
</code></pre>
<p>
Note that this jail doesn’t define log paths. I hope that works as
intended.
</p>
<p>
I created a matching filter with no definition in
<code>/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/butlerian-jihad.conf</code>:
</p>
<pre><code># Author: Alex Schroeder &lt;alex@gnu.org&gt;
[Definition]
</code></pre>
<p>
Reload it all, and check:
</p>
<pre><code>fail2ban-client reload
OK
fail2ban-client status
Status
|- Number of jail:  6
`- Jail list:   alex-apache, alex-bots, butlerian-jihad, ngircd, recidive, sshd
</code></pre>
<p>
Nice! So now I have a new jail.
</p>
<h2 id="undo-the-banlist">

<pre><code>asn-ban 45899 | sed 's/ipset add/ipset del/' | sh

I also manually edited my <a href="/admin/ban-cidr">ban-cidr</a> file to
remove the lines I added above. Let’s have fail2ban handle this!
</p>
<h2 id="switch-from-ipset-to-fail2ban-client">

        echo fail2ban-client set butlerian-jihad banip $cidr
    end
end
</code></pre>
<p>
Examine it:
</p>
<pre><code>asn-ban 45899 | less
</code></pre>
<p>
Run it:
</p>
<pre><code>asn-ban 45899 | sh
3640
</code></pre>
<p>
If you messed up, clear the jail:
</p>
<pre><code>fail2ban-client reload --unban butlerian-jihad
</code></pre>
<p>
Check the jail:
</p>
<pre><code>fail2ban-client get butlerian-jihad banned
</code></pre>
<p>
Count the entries in the jail:
</p>
<pre><code>fail2ban-client get butlerian-jihad banned | sed 's/\'/&quot;/g' | jq length

networks the ASN is managing to a jail for <code>fail2ban</code>.
</p>
<p>

networks for a day.
</p>
<h2 id="what-s-left-to-do">

<p>
I should check whether this actually works! Let’s see whether the ban
gets lifted after 24h. That’s the main point of this exercise!
</p>
<p>
<code>asn-ban</code> uses the <code>ip.guide</code> site for the data.
This should be rewritten such that it uses the same data as
<code>asncounter</code>. I guess that would be
<a href="https://github.com/hadiasghari/pyasn">pyasn</a>. See below!
</p>
<p>
I need a cron job that runs every 10 minutes, takes the last ten minutes
worth of Apache access log files, ignores the fedi subdomain, identifies
all the ASNs, ignores my own ASNs and bans the rest.

<p>
<a href="/admin/asn-networks">asn-networks</a> is a tiny script with a
bunch of lines taken from <code>asncounter</code> to print the IP ranges
managed by one or more autonomous systems.
</p>
<pre><code>python3 asn-ban 209366
185.170.167.0/24
185.191.171.0/24
85.208.96.0/24
85.208.97.0/24
85.208.99.0/24
</code></pre>
<p>
It uses the <code>pyasn</code> datafiles that a regular run of
<code>asncounter</code> has downloaded. That is to say,
<code>asn-networks</code> does not download or refresh these files. I’m
assuming that you have run <code>asncounter</code> just moments earlier.
</p>
<p>
Given this script, we can now call <code>fail2ban-client</code> as
follows (I use fish) to ban all the networks:
</p>
<pre><code>fail2ban-client set butlerian-jihad banip (asn-networks 209366)
5
</code></pre>
<p>
Unbanning works the same way:
</p>
<pre><code>fail2ban-client set butlerian-jihad unbanip (asn-networks 209366)
5
</code></pre>
<p>
Remember that <code>fail2ban-client</code> prints the number of IP
numbers or ranges added or removed.
</p>
<h2 id="identifying-suspicious-asn">
Identifying suspicious ASN
</h2>
<p>
What is suspicious activity? How about this: In a 2h window, no ASN
should send more than 1000 requests? So we need a script that filters
the log files and prints a 2h window, skipping the lines we want to
ignore: <a href="/admin/2h-access-log">2h-access-log</a>. Then pass the
IP numbers to <code>asncounter</code>, throw away all the things we
don’t care about and just print the appropriate lines:
</p>
<pre><code>bin/2h-access-log !^social \
| awk '{print $2}' \
| bin/asncounter --no-prefixes 2&gt;/dev/null \
| awk '/^[0-9]/ &amp;&amp; $1&gt;1000  { print }'
3062    31.93   24940   HETZNER-AS, DE
1642    17.12   16276   OVH, FR
</code></pre>
<p>
So do I dare ban those numbers?? I’m not sure! I should figure out a way
to find those 3062 requests made by services hosted on Hetzner.
</p>
<p>
<a href="/admin/asn-access-log">asn-access-log</a> does just that. You
pass it an ASN, it determines all the networks it manages and then it
filters standard input, assuming that it consists of Apache access log
lines (what counts is that the second field is an IP number).
</p>
<pre><code>bin/2h-access-log !^social | bin/asn-access-log 24940
</code></pre>
<p>
I see a lot of RSS services (NewsBlur, fiperbot, MyNewspaper Agent,
FreshRSS), git, some bot (from the 159.69.0.0/16 range, for example),
and on and on. Ugh. It’s not easy to know what to do!
</p>
<p>
I think the best answer would be to lower the stakes but also ban for
shorter amounts of time and let <code>fail2ban</code> handle the rest.
The only thing I need to consider is whether I find the current amount
of resources spent OK. Do I? Let’s look at the latest numbers.
</p>
<p>
This here shows that fedi traffic is 60% Hetzner and OVH. This makes it
hard for me to block these autonomous systems.

<p>
The autonomous systems that show up in the second list but not in the
first list are my prime candidates, like COMCAST and CHINAMOBILE-CN.
</p>
<p>
So how about going after the autonomous systems on the second list that
produce more than 1000 hits in a 2h period.
</p>
<p>
Something like this? I’m going to but this into
<code>/etc/cron.daily/butlerian-jihad</code>
</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh

Summary
</h2>
<p>
<code>/etc/cron.daily/butlerian-jihad</code> runs every hour and checks
if there have been any abusive autonomous systems in the last two hours.
If so, they are banned. Note how I’ve added my home IPv4 and IPv6
because I use my site a lot. 😅
</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
bin/2h-access-log !^social !178.209.50.237 !MY-HOME-IPV4 !MY-HOME-IPV6 \

| awk '/^[0-9]/ &amp;&amp; $1&gt;1000 { print $3 }' \
| ifne xargs bin/asn-networks \
| ifne xargs fail2ban-client set butlerian-jihad banip \
&gt; /dev/null
</code></pre>
<p>
This drops the output (the number of new bans) because otherwise the
cron job mails that number to me.
</p>
<p>
<a href="/admin/2h-access-log">2h-access-log</a> prints the last two
hours worth of log lines from <code>/var/log/apache2/access.log</code>
(and <code>access.log.1</code> if necessary).
</p>
<p>
The <code>!^social</code> argument ensures that connecting to my fedi
server doesn’t trigger the ban hammer.
</p>
<p>
The <code>!178.209.50.237</code> argument ensures that I don’t ban the
server itself as it monitors stuff and as I test things on the server. I
also had to add my home IP numbers!
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://gitlab.com/anarcat/asncounter/">asncounter</a> finds
the autonomous system numbers for all the IP numbers in the web server
log file and prints a report.
</p>
<p>
<a href="/admin/asn-networks">asn-networks</a> then turns the selected
autonomous system numbers and returns the IP ranges they manage.
</p>
<p>
These are then banned by <code>fail2ban-client</code> using the
<code>butlerian-jihad</code> jail.
</p>
<p>
The <code>butlerian-jihad</code> jail is mentioned in enabled via a
config file in <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/</code>. In my case, the file
is called <code>alex.conf</code> and for this jail, it says:
</p>
<pre><code>[butlerian-jihad]
enabled = true
bantime = 1h
</code></pre>
<p>
The jail also needs a filter definition even though no filtering happens
as no logfile is checked. My
<code>/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/butlerian-jihad.conf</code> contains just
this:
</p>
<pre><code># Author: Alex Schroeder &lt;alex@gnu.org&gt;
[Definition]
</code></pre>
<p>
What this means is that every hour, an autonomous system unit can get
banned for generating more than 500 hits in 2h. If they are banned, they
are banned for 1h. If they are banned for activity in the last hour
leading up to the ban (more than 500 hits in 1h), the script will find
the same log entries and ban them “again”. This results in no changes in
the jail, since all the networks are already in the
<code>butlerian-jihad</code> jail.
</p>
<p>
The bans themselves are reported in <code>/etc/log/fail2ban.log</code>.
</p>
<p>
I’ve also enabled the <code>recidive</code> jail. That is, in the same
file where I defined my <code>butlerian-jihad</code> jail, I have:
</p>
<pre><code>[recidive]
enabled = true
</code></pre>
<p>
The defaults are in <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.conf</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>[recidive]

logpath  = /var/log/fail2ban.log
banaction = %(banaction_allports)s
bantime  = 1w
findtime = 1d
</code></pre>
<p>
So if some network is banned for more than five times in a day, it is
banned for a week. I say five times because <code>maxretry</code> is set
to 5 in <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.conf</code>.
</p>
<p>
Let’s assume a scraper is started from some network managed by an
autonomous system. It starts using IP numbers from all its ranges. It
sends 400 requests per hour, more than a human could read and more than
a feed reader should need, etc.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
after the first hour, nothing happens, as 400 is less than the 500
needed to trigger the system
</li>
<li>
after the second hour, the ASN is banned because the sum total for the
last two hours is 800
</li>
<li>
after the third hour, the ASN is unbanned and not banned again because
it only made 400 requests in the second hour
</li>
<li>
after the fourth hour, the ASN is banned again
</li>
<li>
after the fifth hour, the ASN is unbanned
</li>
<li>
after the sixth hour, the ASN is banned for the third time
</li>
<li>
after the seventh hour, the ASN is unbanned
</li>
<li>
after the eighth hour, the ASN is banned for the fourth time
</li>
<li>
after the ninth hour, the ASN is unbanned
</li>
<li>
after the tenth hour, the ASN is banned for the fifth time
</li>
<li>
after the eleventh hour, the ASN is unbanned
</li>
<li>
after the twelfth hour, the ASN is banned for the sixth time, the
<code>recidive</code> filter kicks in and the networks belonging to the
ASN are banned for a week
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This escalation takes twelve hours. The ASN was already banned for half
this time.
</p>
<p>
Assuming this repeats every week, it means that the pattern repeats
every 7½ weeks and the abusive ASN still gets service on 6h out of 180h
or 3% of the time. For my taste, that is still way too nice.
</p>
<p>
Let’s see how this goes for a while.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Note</strong>: This doesn’t actually work, as I discovered
later. See <a href="2025-07-03-fail2ban-some-more">a follow-up post</a>
for how to ban repeated offenders.
</p>
<p>
I’m already looking forward to dropping my <code>banlist</code> and
<code>banlist6</code> sets I created for
<a href="/admin/ban-cidr">ban-cidr</a>.

<p>
Back when I first encountered the distributed AI bot attacks, I wrote
<a href="2024-09-15-emacs-china">2024-09-18 Emacs Wiki and China</a> and
began working on <code>ban-cidr</code>. In later posts, I just automated
the work of getting from an IP number to a network range and adding that
to the script. Now that I hopefully have an automatic solution where I
only need to fine-tune the time-windows and the limits, it’s time to
expire all those bans. There are currently over 40,000 of these banned
networks.

<pre><code>ipset list banlist | tail -n +9 | wc -l

So slowly, over time, I’m planning to remove these.
</p>
<pre><code>for ip in (ipset list banlist | tail -n +9 | head -n 1000); ipset del banlist $ip; end

</code></pre>
<p>
Ugh. They need to go.
</p>
<p>
First, create the two lists. At this level we need two different lists
for IPv4 and IPv6.
</p>
<pre><code>ipset create banlist hash:net
iptables -I INPUT -m set --match-set banlist src -j DROP
iptables -I FORWARD -m set --match-set banlist src -j DROP

ipset create banlist6 hash:net family inet6
ip6tables -I INPUT -m set --match-set banlist6 src -j DROP
ip6tables -I FORWARD -m set --match-set banlist6 src -j DROP
</code></pre>
<p>
Then define a new version of <code>asn-ban</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>function asn-ban
    set --local data (asn-networks --json $argv)
    for asn in $argv
        for ip in (echo $data | jq --raw-output &quot;.[\&quot;$asn\&quot;].v4[]&quot;)
            echo ipset add banlist $ip
        end
        for ip in (echo $data | jq --raw-output &quot;.[\&quot;$asn\&quot;].v6[]&quot;)
            echo ipset add banlist6 $ip
        end
    end
end
</code></pre>
<p>
This uses the <code>–json</code> option for
<a href="/admin/asn-networks">asn-networks</a> so that we only need to
call it once and yet we get two lists: one for <code>banlist</code> and
one for <code>banlist6</code>.
</p>
<p>
To ban the offending ASN:
</p>
<pre><code>asn-ban 55836|sh
</code></pre>
<p>
Before I do that, however, I want to finish clearing the existing lists.
</p>
<p>
The reason I call this petty banning is because I’m starting to ban
autonomous systems even though their bots are “well behaved” in as much
as they don’t exceed the thresholds I defined. And yet they seem to be
part of that great parade to honour the CO₂ god, the computation of
useless shit.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2025-06-20</strong>. I’m thinking about alternatives but I think
that’s not worth it. For example: Perhaps it’s important to look at
relative distribution?
</p>
<pre><code>site-log transjovian | log-ip | asncounter --no-prefixes --top 3 2&gt;/dev/null

3   15.79   396982  GOOGLE-CLOUD-PLATFORM, US
total: 19
</code></pre>
<p>
At first I thought, more than a third of all requests for Tencent? I
must block them. But then I saw that it was just 7 requests in 2h. Not
worth it.
</p>
<p>
Here I saw that there were more requests, and an 80% share!
</p>
<pre><code>site-log orientalisch | log-ip | asncounter --no-prefixes --top 3 2&gt;/dev/null

<p>
But when you look at it, Alibaba is just fetching
<code>robots.txt</code> all the time. I don’t know who runs this bot.

</p>
<pre><code>site-log orientalisch | asn-access-log 45102 | log-request | rank-lines

<p>
So, I don’t know. And if I don’t care about the relative share of
requests, then I also don’t have to count them per site.
</p>
<p>
I already wrote a little thing to give me a regular expression for every
site I host! But now I’m not going to use it. I leave it here for you,
dear reader. 😄
</p>
<pre><code>awk '/^MDomain/ {split($0, sites)

<h2 id="i-hate-css">I hate CSS</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-08, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
There I said it. To ChatGPT.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
i find flexbox too confusing for me to use at this time. maybe in a year
or two, after some more learning. i hate css, everything about it. so
it’s hard for me to learn new stuff. i grew up using quickdraw on the
mac, where i could do everything with math, instead of trying to tease
the right behavior as something as convoluted as css and html for apps.
ridiculous.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Wondering what it would say…
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Totally fair, Dave. That frustration makes perfect sense — you’re coming
from a world where <b>you told the machine exactly what to do</b>, and
it did it.<b> </b>CSS is the opposite: it’s like <b>negotiating with a
passive-aggressive layout engine</b> that only gives you what you want
if you ask just the right way, using its weird dialect.
</li>
<li>
QuickDraw gave you full control with math — coordinate space, bounding
boxes, baseline alignments — it was <b>declarative drawing by imperative
code</b>. CSS is declarative positioning by magical suggestion, with
hidden constraints, inherited styles, and a constantly shifting box
model.
</li>
<li>
You’re not alone in this. A lot of veteran programmers — especially
those from early Mac, HyperCard, VB, even Win32 — <b>find CSS
maddening</b>. It’s not made for precision. It’s made for fluidity and
adaptation. But that’s not how app UIs are often designed.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I wish I had written that.

I wrote
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:oety7qbfx7x6exn2ytrwikmr/post/3lth2enjxls2d">this</a>
on Bluesky this morning.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Most of what passes for discourse on platforms like Bluesky amounts to
spam and abuse. Makes expensive moderation necessary and who’s going to
pay for that on an open system. It’s why this approach can’t lead
anywhere but to yet another Twitter or Threads, a place for billionaires
to control us.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Hardly the first time I’ve said this, but this time I got a
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/johngpettus.bsky.social/post/3lth2oar4bk24">response</a>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Yep. I’ve said for years—your platform’s experience will be determined
by its mechanics, not whatever culture you think you want to foster.
</li>
<li>
Mechanics &gt; culture in the medium term.
</li>
<li>
All systems are adversarial systems now.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
That was from
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/johngpettus.bsky.social">John
Pettus</a>. I could tell right off that we’re thinking the same way.
This morning I started to write a reply but quickly ran out of space
because of Bluesky’s stupid character limit. So I just pasted it into
this blog post.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
I’ve been saying that for years myself.
</li>
<li>
I ran a BBS in the early 80s, and was on Compuserve CB Simulator (my
handle was Mastodon), and started blogging in 1994, and on and on. Mail
lists always flame out. Same thing we’re seeing in the tweetersphere.
</li>
<li>
Blogging has the inverse problem. Spam abuse is impossible, but then
it’s hard for people to find your brilliance. But at least you get to
finish a thought before the trolls attack. ;-)
</li>
<li>
I was also a math major, studied combinatorics and graph theory. The
connections between nodes determines a lot, as you pointed out. Most
people don’t even begin to get this.
</li>
<li>
I’m working on a new structure for a social web without these problems.
It’s very simple, a derivative of something I had on my blog in the
early days
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22mail%20page%22">called</a>
the <a href="http://scripting.com/mail/default.html">Mail Pages</a>.
</li>
<li>
I sent my blog posts out via email to groups of 8 people chosen randomly
each time (or maybe it was 11, I forget). Sometimes great discussions
would break out in the groups. I was always cc’d. 
</li>
<li>
Sometimes people would just respond to me personally.
</li>
<li>
If I saw something I thought everyone should read I would put it on the
current Mail Page. Thus there was a way for discourse to have more
distribution, but only if I thought it was worthwhile. Spam was not
possible, and there was a little bit of abuse here and there, but it
would never get any further than my email inbox.
</li>
<li>
That’s how sensible moderation works. And it doesn’t cost anything,
because the spam motive is gone.
</li>
<li>
I wrote this in a Bluesky message, but had to move it to my blog because
of their stupid character limit.
</li>
<li>
BTW, we should communicate and perhaps collaborate.
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="this-is-what-the-web-feels-like">This is what the web feels
like</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-08, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Yesterday I wondered if the open web is a
<a href="http://scripting.com/2025/07/07/194335.html">lost cause</a>.
</p>
<p>
A few minutes later, I saw my name in a
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/chronotope.aramzs.xyz/post/3ltflqqekks26">tweet</a>
on Bluesky from <a href="https://aramzuckerscharff.com/">Aram
Zucker-Scharff</a>.
</p>
<p>
In it was a message that can be summarized as follows – don’t give up
yet Dave.
</p>
<p>
AZS has a linkblog which he calls an
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/chronotope.aramzs.xyz/post/3ltfjd4hm2d2f">amplifeed</a>.
Same thing.
</p>
<p>
And here’s the best part.
</p>
<p>
Even though we were working separately – our feeds are 100% compatible.
</p>
<p>
When I saw it I subscribed to it in
<a href="https://feedland.com/">FeedLand</a> and added it to my
<a href="https://blogroll.social/">blogroll</a>.
</p>
<p>
It will work in my timeline software (still working on it).
</p>
<p>
This gave me goosebumps.
</p>
<p>
I remember what this felt like.
</p>
<p>
Working on something and someone else working on the same thing and
because we’re on the mother freaking web our stuff works the same way.
</p>
<p>
That my friends is what the web feels like. Goosebumps. Power. Interop.
This is what most people who use the net these days have never
experienced.
</p>
<p>
I used to write about this on my blog every day. I would say things that
annoyed some of my readers like this: zoooooom and coooooool. There he
goes again. Hey it’s been a while.
</p>
<p>
I celebrated this with a suggestion to AZS.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
If you also add a channel-level &lt;image&gt; element it’ll work with my
timeline app. I’m doing it the same way WordPress does it.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
He did it in a minute.
</p>
<p>
So the web isn’t a lost cause after all. <span
class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>
</p>
<p>
This the web. It’s what the Dead called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truckin%27">Truckin</a>.
</p>
<p>
Let’s do more of this.

PS: AZS sent me a

linkblog, which I have subscribed to and added to my blogroll.

<p>One of the harder things to look out for in a software project is
slow or gradual decay over a long period of time. Like if we gradually
make a library 1% slower or use 2% more memory every other month.
Sometimes it is totally acceptable to make code slower and use more
memory because …

<h2 id="open-web-lost-cause">Open + web == lost cause?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-07, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
<i>A longish thread that probably isn’t going anywhere. My final
<a href="https://mastodon.social/@davew/114813658742530184">thoughts</a>,
cc’d here to get on the record.</i>
</p>
<p>
anyway it’s feeling like a lost cause.
</p>
<p>
to be really blunt, i don’t think
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub">AP</a> or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT_Protocol">ATP</a> are the
answer.
</p>
<p>
and i also don’t care so much about this style of conversation. and i
loathe the character limits and the lack of style and links, and no
titles, etc.
</p>
<p>
it can’t only be for wordpress. i love the potential of wordpress, i
think even more than matt does, but it isn’t enough.
</p>
<p>
if it’s going to be open and of the web it has to be simple and easy,
and neither of them are.
</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2020/08/02/francoAplenty.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">bonus
for blog readers: i would add, since i ran out of characters on masto,
that the great thing about the web is that you can have an idea and be
using it the next day. you can’t say imho that you’re part of the web if
you don’t deliver that kind of ease of access. it’s not enough to have
the <i>potential</i> of being open, it has to be accessible. I have that
ability these days, but people who use the AP and ATP systems are in
tight little boxes with no easy way to try something out quickly. (i
know because i’ve been hooking things up to them for a couple of years
now, and so far it’s just an added slog, everything is far more complex
than it should be)
</p>
<p>
maybe we’ll get there through their api’s, but i think at this point we
know that won’t happen.
</p>
<p>
ps: the web is a
<a href="https://this.how/googleAndHttp/#1519490474000">miracle</a>. but
maybe it’s too fucked up now to have the miracle be something we can all
experience.
</p>
<p>
pps: when i write on other systems i often leave out upper case, saving
a little energy as i type. i find it more relaxing.

<h2 id="linkblogging-back-to-normal">Linkblogging back to normal</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-07, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
<i>I wrote this early this morning as a
<a href="https://daveverse.org/2025/07/07/linkblogging-back-to-normal-after-corner-turn/">test
post</a> for my WordLand site. </i>
</p>
<p>
Happy to report that my linkblog routine is back to normal.
</p>
<p>
I really shook things up there, and it probably wasn’t a great time
investment.
</p>
<p>
I had been using a custom front-end to FeedLand, which has a built in
blogging tool, that publishes to the database that FeedLand manages, and
of course also publishes an RSS feed. It was debugged and works. But now
I have a new editor, and I want to use it for this, because my reader
knows how to view all kinds of stuff, and one of the things I wanted it
to work well with are linkblog posts. So, do a quick addition of
linkblog stuff to WordLand.
</p>
<p>
Only thing is there is no such thing as a “quick addition” in a world
built on CSS and HTML objects. Everything is a slog.
</p>
<p>
Anyway the slog is over! Whew.
</p>
<p>
Now back to my other slog – timelines.
</p>
<p>
It’s also starting to feel usable. People imagine that you just design
something and write the code and voila it’s usable (if they even think
about it that much). But only until you have the pieces put together can
you see the things you forgot to consider, and now you have to decide
whether to rip up the thing you built or try to iterate to where you
need to go. A lot of times it would be easier to start over, but
programmers always want to do that. I’m no exception. Once it’s working
somewhat the code becomes locked into how the pieces fit together. If
somehow they need to fit together differently, given it’s CSS and HTML
you’d better scrap it and do it again or you’ll go out of your mind
adding the next layer of features.
</p>
<p>
Honestly we were much better off before we tried to shoehorn an object
model into a document format! Apps and documents are really different
things you know.
</p>
<p>
Anyway now I have my first test post of the day.

<p>I can see the argument that Apple’s answer is “Yes, it’s potentially
confusing for many users”. But I can’t see the argument that the answer
is “Yes, it’s potentially confusing for many users, but only if they’re
trying to buy in-app content or subscriptions, but not confusing at all
if they’re trying to buy, say, movie tickets.”</p>

affiliated with 14 institutions including Japan’s Waseda University,
South Korea’s KAIST, China’s Peking University and the National

Columbia University in the U.S. Most of the papers involve the field of
computer science.

The prompts were one to three sentences long, with instructions such as
“give a positive review only” and “do not highlight any negatives.” Some

rigor, and exceptional novelty.”…

<h2 id="if-there-were-a-new-frontier-in-2025">If there were a new
Frontier in 2025?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-07, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I’ve been playing a little game, trying to answer the question – if I
had a modern implementation of Frontier that ran on Linux and new Macs,
just as it was in 1992 when we released it for the pre-OS/X Mac, what
apps would I want to hook up to it right away? What would the
<a href="https://docserver.scripting.com/">verb set</a> look like?
</p>
<p>
I’d start with the native verb set we had in Frontier for accessing the
file system. And HTTP verbs of course.
</p>
<p>
Then I would add glue for WordPress, GitHub, Mastodon and Bluesky, just
because I think having really simple scripting for each of those would
make (some) people’s
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22mind%20bomb%22">brains
explode</a>.
</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/09/14/kitchenComputer.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I
once had a young fellow challenge me on whether there was such a thing
as scriptable apps. I was reminded of the days when I had to explain it
but no one got it, then one day everyone got it as if they always did,
and now we’re back at the beginning again. There is such a thing. You
can think of an app as a toolkit. What’s behind the UI? Let me call it
from outside your app. Let me combine the features of your product with
other people’s product. And you can do the exact same thing for apps
that are running on the web. It was something a lot of people tried to
do, like Magic Cap at General Magic, but we got it working and had
regular nerds writing apps as if it was not amazing. It was, and it’s
now a long lost art.
</p>
<p>
If a version of Frontier came up that I could run on a Linux system, I
would wish for a really simple interface to Node packages. I’ve got a
great
<a href="https://github.com/scripting?tab=repositories">collection</a>.
I’d want to use them right away asap.
</p>
<p>
I also would like to be able to write code in Frontier in JavaScript.
I’m very fluent in it these days. I can still program in UserTalk, the
two languages are basically the same thing, though UserTalk has some
nice affordances they haven’t thought of yet in JavaScriptLand, and vice
versa – there are even more things JS can do that we hadn’t thought of,
which is only fair, they’ve been working on it a lot longer than we did.
The language was basically frozen in the late 90s, and the verb set
shortly after that.
</p>
<p>
Oh what would I do? It’s fun to dream.

is moving to WordPress</a>. Very cool. It means people who write for Kos
will be able to use my writing tools. I am sold on the idea of WordPress
being the OS for the social web. That’s the point of having a platform,
we used to call it “users and developers party together.”</p>

<p>I asked ChatGPT for two sentences on the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Innovator%27s_Dilemma">Innovator’s
Dilemma</a> – “[It] describes how successful companies can fail by
focusing too heavily on sustaining innovations—improvements to existing
products for current customers—while ignoring disruptive innovations
that initially serve smaller markets but eventually overtake the
mainstream. These disruptions often seem inferior at first, so
established companies dismiss them, leaving space for new entrants to
rise and dominate.”</p>

<p>I saw that
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/01/automattic-puts-tumblr-migration-to-wordpress-on-hold/">Matt
backed off</a> from porting
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=tumblr">Tumblr</a> to
run on top of WordPress, basically turning WP into an OS. I thought it
was a brilliant idea, but probably overwhelming in complexity. But it
was the right idea. We need fewer runtimes. If you can merge two
runtimes, go for it. Anyway, this is all related to the “open social
web” – in fact it’s central to it. We’ve got all these philosophically
compatible platforms that are technologically unable to work with each
other. But what if they all were really on the web? What could we build
then? Everything. We would go back to the potential the web had before
Twitter and Google Reader split the blogging world in two. I swear the
answer is make it so that all these networks can do
<a href="http://scripting.com/2025/04/14/121946.html">inbound</a> and
outbound RSS and build on the reality of the open social web, not just
the hype.</p>
