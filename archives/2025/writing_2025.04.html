Screenwriting Lessons from Golden-Globe Winner ‘The Brutalist’</h2>

This year’s winner of the Golden Globe for Best Picture (Drama) and Best
Performance by a Male Actor for Adrien Brody (Drama), <em>The
Brutalist</em> has become one of the most intriguing films to come out
of 2024. Writer/Director Brady Corbet’s mid-century tale follows László
Tóth (Adrien Brody), a renowned architect whose ambition and talent
lands him in the good graces of a wealthy client who hires him to build
a monument on a Pennsylvania hillside. In many ways <em>The
Brutalist</em> is an unconventional biopic as it is about a largely
unknown figure and clocks in at 3.5 hours long (with an intermission!).

<strong>Fortress Sol</strong>, Stephen Baxter (Gollancz
978-1-39961-461-0, £25.00, 480pp, hc). October 2024.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Fortress Sol </strong>is classic Stephen Baxter. It’s driven by
big ideas: Humanity’s response to a perceived existential threat
includes both dispersing to the stars and mind-boggling engineering
projects. Like 2021’s <strong>Galaxias</strong>, the focus is not so
much on the alien threat as on humanity’s response. There’s a relatively
small cast of characters, who are engag­ing enough but

As climate change has become an ever-growing and more insistent presence
in our lives, it has also begun inflecting and informing works of
fiction, whose authors imag­ine how the remainder of the 21st century
will play out. Interestingly, it is writers coming from outside the
traditional venues of SFF writing and publishing who have most readily
embraced this
