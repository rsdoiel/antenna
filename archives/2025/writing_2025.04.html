“Fugler [Robert Carlyle] was a character that I really connected with
from the beginning. I know it sounds a little strange that the Nazi was
my way into this, but it really was that idea of, ‘How can we get inside
his head and make sure that he’s a fully fleshed out person that way?’”
says Josh Salzberg about trying to make his villain, a Nazi named Damien
Fugler, a three-dimensional character.<br><br>Josh Salzberg wrote the
screenplay for <em>The Performance</em> with co-writer/director Shira
Piven. In this episode, Salzberg talks about the challenges of adapting
a short story by playwright Arthur Miller that’s about a Jewish-American
tap dancer [Jeremy Piven], who’s willing to compromise his own core
values to find fame and fortune in Nazi Germany. <br><br>“The idea of
all [the characters] is that they’re all performing on some level. They
all have another life. And that’s true to show business, that we all
have sides of ourselves that we’re not sure we want everybody to see or
that it’s okay for everybody to see. And then in Berlin in the ’30s,
there’s all these different communities that were impacted – not just
the Jews in Germany,” he says. <br><br>Salzberg also talks about his
background as a film editor, how it helped him transition to
screenwriting, and the challenges of writing morally compromised
characters like his protagonist, Harold [Jeremy Piven]. <br><br>“I think
embracing the mistakes that they make, embracing those flaws and leaning
into that is important. Sometimes we can care about our characters to
the point where we want them to be likable, which is a note we always
get, but we’ve got to be okay with the mistakes – and the consequences
for those mistakes. And that was a lesson that Shira and I kept learning
as we were developing the script,” he says. <br><br>To hear more about
Salzberg’s writing process, listen to the podcast. <br><br><em>Please
note: this episode contains discussions regarding racism and
anti-semitism. </em><br><br>

David Ferraro’s new young adult fantasy romance <strong>A Vile Season
</strong>is comped as <strong>Bridgerton </strong>meets <strong>The
Bachelor </strong>but with vampires. That’s exactly the vibe. Everything
from the pacing, the intentionally and flamboyantly anachronistic
diversity in the upper classes, the garish wardrobe, the playful
disregard for historical accuracy, the overly dramatic rela­tionship
conflicts, the marriage competition,

Writers of duologies aren’t doing any favors for book reviewers. With a
trilogy, we can blather on about middle-book syndrome and three-act
structures; with an ongoing series, we can spec­ulate about
metanarratives or simply rate each new volume as though it were the
latest album from a familiar band, but a duology somehow seems to

<p>
This year’s winner of the Golden Globe for Best Picture (Drama) and Best
Performance by a Male Actor for Adrien Brody (Drama), <em>The
Brutalist</em> has become one of the most intriguing films to come out
of 2024. Writer/Director Brady Corbet’s mid-century tale follows László
Tóth (Adrien Brody), a renowned architect whose ambition and talent
lands him in the good graces of a wealthy client who hires him to build
a monument on a Pennsylvania hillside. In many ways <em>The
Brutalist</em> is an unconventional biopic as it is about a largely
unknown figure and clocks in at 3.5 hours long (with an intermission!).

<p>
Ellen Datlow is accepting submissions for her 17th Best Horror of the
Year anthology, to be published by Night Shade Books and covering
material appearing in 2025.
</p>
<p>
I am looking for stories and poetry from all branches of horror:
supernatural, uncanny, sf horror, psychological, dark crime, terror
tales, or anything else that might qualify.
</p>
<p>
This is an all <strong>reprint</strong> anthology, so I’ll only consider
material published in <strong>2025</strong>. <strong>Deadline </strong>

<strong>Fortress Sol</strong>, Stephen Baxter (Gollancz
978-1-39961-461-0, £25.00, 480pp, hc). October 2024.

<strong>Fortress Sol </strong>is classic Stephen Baxter. It’s driven by
big ideas: Humanity’s response to a perceived existential threat
includes both dispersing to the stars and mind-boggling engineering
projects. Like 2021’s <strong>Galaxias</strong>, the focus is not so
much on the alien threat as on humanity’s response. There’s a relatively
small cast of characters, who are engag­ing enough but
