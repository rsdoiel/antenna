<h2 id="the-gem-program---year-two-2024">The GEM program - Year Two
2024</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-27, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
We began our <a href="https://www.crossref.org/gem/">Global Equitable
Membership (GEM) Program</a> to provide greater membership equitability
and accessibility to organizations in the world’s least economically
advantaged countries. Eligibility for the program is based on a member’s
country; our list of countries is predominantly based on the
<a href="https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519-world-bank-country-and-lending-groups" target="_blank">International
Development Association (IDA)</a>. Eligible members pay no membership or
content registration fees. The list undergoes periodic reviews, as
countries may be added or removed over time as economic situations
change.
</p>
<p>
The program began in January 2023 with 214 existing members; and 131
more joined throughout the year. In 2024, we saw 127 organisations
joining via the GEM program, bringing the total number of participants
to 458. We welcomed our first-ever members from Sierra Leone and
Honduras, as well as our first Sponsor in Bangladesh
(<a href="https://www.crossref.org/membership/about-sponsors/">Sponsors</a>
are organizations that work with us to provide administrative, billing,
technical, and local language support to the members they work with).
</p>
<p>
Of 458 organisations participating in the GEM program, 380 are
independent members, 77 are sponsored, and there is one sponsoring
organisation. To date, these members have contributed over 279,000 works
to the
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/research-nexus/">Research
Nexus</a>, our concept of a fully connected global scholarly ecosystem.
</p>
<p>
Though we have Sponsors based elsewhere, working with members who are in
GEM countries (e.g. PKP), we will continue to consult with
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/community/our-ambassadors/">our
ambassadors</a> and other partners to identify potential new sponsors
that are based in GEM countries.

<p>
We are excited about our in-person event taking place in a few weeks in
Accra, Ghana, as a direct result of the increasing participation and
interest in Crossref from the region.
</p>
<p>
We can see a clear connection between outreach activities conducted by
us and our Ambassadors and the increase in awareness and the number of
members joining from related countries. These were Bangladesh, Nepal,
Uganda, and Tanzania in 2023, and Ghana, Zambia, Sri Lanka, and Tanzania
in 2024.
</p>
<p>
From our Ambassadors’ activities in the GEM countries, some recurring
questions emerged highlighting barriers to joining Crossref. It’s
important to recognise that many institutions struggle with funding and
technical expertise. It’s no surprise that they are often concerned with
the maintenance of their membership over the long term. We emphasize
that GEM is a sustained measure to accommodate knowledge-sharing
organisations from the regions of financial strain. Whilst the program
addresses the costs of membership and content registration, our
Ambassadors can assist further, offering technical support with record
registration, metadata best practices, and integrating Crossref services
with existing systems, including Open Journal Systems (OJS); and discuss
how registering metadata improves research visibility.
</p>
<p>
We are grateful to our Ambassadors for directly supporting the GEM
program within their countries through webinars and presenting in person
at conferences: Shaharima Parvin and MD Jahangir in Bangladesh, Richard
Bruce Lamptey in Ghana, Niranjan Koirala in Nepal, Oumy Ndiaye in
Senegal, Lasith Gunawardena in Sri Lanka, and Baraka Manjale Ngussa in
Tanzania.
