## Building the Resistance

date: 2025-03-16, from: Our Future.org

Our fight for democracy is not about left or right, or who you voted for - it's about who gets to live with dignity. Right now, greedy oligarchs think our destiny is in their hands: democracy is just another shiny toy their billions can buy, and there‚Äôs no politician or public institution they can‚Äôt bend [&#8230;]

## Construyendo la Resistencia

date: 2025-03-16, from: Our Future.org

Nuestra lucha para la democracia no es de izquiedas ni derechas - se trata de qui√©n puede vivir con dignidad. En este momento, unos pocos codiciosos creen que son los maestros de nuestro destino: la democracia es un juguete para ellos. Quieren comprarla con sus miles de millones de d√≥lares. Piensan que no hay pol√≠tico [&#8230;]

There was a time, 1999 specifically, when writing for the web in a web browser was a strange and new idea. That era lasted until 2006 when Twitter emerged, removing almost all the features of writing and adding character limits. That had enormous impact on the political and creative worlds. The era of wood chipping people and ideas.

## mlx-community/OLMo-2-0325-32B-Instruct-4bit

date: 2025-03-16, updated: 2025-03-16, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/OLMo-2-0325-32B-Instruct-4bit">mlx-community/OLMo-2-0325-32B-Instruct-4bit</a></strong></p>
OLMo 2 32B <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/13/ai2/">claims to be</a> "the first fully-open model (all data, code, weights, and details are freely available) to outperform GPT3.5-Turbo and GPT-4o mini". Thanks to the MLX project here's a recipe that worked for me to run it on my Mac, via my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-mlx">llm-mlx</a> plugin.</p>
<p>To install the model:</p>
<pre><code>llm install llm-mlx
llm mlx download-model mlx-community/OLMo-2-0325-32B-Instruct-4bit
</code></pre>
<p>That downloads 17GB to <code>~/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--mlx-community--OLMo-2-0325-32B-Instruct-4bit</code>.</p>
<p>To start an interactive chat with OLMo 2:</p>
<pre><code>llm chat -m mlx-community/OLMo-2-0325-32B-Instruct-4bit
</code></pre>
<p>Or to run a prompt:</p>
<pre><code>llm -m mlx-community/OLMo-2-0325-32B-Instruct-4bit 'Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle' -o unlimited 1
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>-o unlimited 1</code> removes the cap on the number of output tokens - the default for <code>llm-mlx</code> is 1024 which isn't enough to attempt to draw a pelican.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/53f00731d494439d4aeca6bdd55368ca">pelican it drew</a> is refreshingly abstract:</p>

## Quoting Andrew Ng

<blockquote cite="https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/issue-292/"><p>Some people today are discouraging others from learning programming on the grounds AI will automate it. This advice will be seen as some of the worst career advice ever given. I disagree with the Turing Award and Nobel prize winner who wrote, ‚ÄúIt is far more likely that the programming occupation will become extinct [...] than that it will become all-powerful. More and more, computers will program themselves.‚Äù‚Äã Statements discouraging people from learning to code are harmful!</p>
<p>In the 1960s, when programming moved from punchcards (where a programmer had to laboriously make holes in physical cards to write code character by character) to keyboards with terminals, programming became easier. And that made it a better time than before to begin programming. Yet it was in this era that Nobel laureate Herb Simon wrote the words quoted in the first paragraph. Today‚Äôs arguments not to learn to code continue to echo his comment.</p>

## TIL: Styling an HTML dialog modal to take the full height of the viewport

date: 2025-03-14, updated: 2025-03-14, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/css/dialog-full-height">TIL: Styling an HTML dialog modal to take the full height of the viewport</a></strong></p>
I spent some time today trying to figure out how to have a modal <code>&lt;dialog&gt;</code> element present as a full height side panel that animates in from the side. The full height bit was hard, until Natalie helped me figure out that browsers apply a default <code>max-height: calc(100% - 6px - 2em);</code> rule which needs to be over-ridden.</p>
<p>Also included: some <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/css/dialog-full-height#user-content-spelunking-through-the-html-specification">spelunking through the HTML spec</a> to figure out where that <code>calc()</code> expression was first introduced. The answer was <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/commit/979af1532">November 2020</a>.

## Apple‚Äôs Siri Chief Calls AI Delays Ugly and Embarrassing, Promises Fixes

date: 2025-03-14, updated: 2025-03-14, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-14/apple-s-siri-chief-calls-ai-delays-ugly-and-embarrassing-promises-fixes">Apple‚Äôs Siri Chief Calls AI Delays Ugly and Embarrassing, Promises Fixes</a></strong></p>
Mark Gurman reports on some leaked details from internal Apple meetings concerning the delays in shipping personalized Siri. This note in particular stood out to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Walker said the decision to delay the features was made because of quality issues and that the company has found the technology only works properly up to two-thirds to 80% of the time. He said the group ‚Äúcan make more progress to get those percentages up, so that users get something they can really count on.‚Äù [...]</p>
<p>But Apple wants to maintain a high bar and only deliver the features when they‚Äôre polished, he said. ‚ÄúThese are not quite ready to go to the general public, even though our competitors might have launched them in this state or worse.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I imagine it's a lot harder to get reliable results out of small, local LLMs that run on an iPhone. Features that fail 1/3 to 1/5 of the time are unacceptable for a consumer product like this.

## How ProPublica Uses AI Responsibly in Its Investigations

date: 2025-03-14, updated: 2025-03-14, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/using-ai-responsibly-for-reporting">How ProPublica Uses AI Responsibly in Its Investigations</a></strong></p>
Charles Ornstein describes how ProPublic used an LLM to help analyze data for their recent story <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/ted-cruz-woke-grants-national-science-foundation">A Study of Mint Plants. A Device to Stop Bleeding. This Is the Scientific Research Ted Cruz Calls ‚ÄúWoke.‚Äù</a> by Agnel Philip and Lisa Song.</p>
<p>They ran ~3,400 grant descriptions through a prompt that included the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As an investigative journalist, I am looking for the following information</p>
<p>-- </p>
<p><code>woke_description</code>: A short description (at maximum a paragraph) on why this grant is being singled out for promoting "woke" ideology, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) or advanced neo-Marxist class warfare propaganda. Leave this blank if it's unclear.</p>
<p><code>why_flagged</code>: Look at the "STATUS", "SOCIAL JUSTICE CATEGORY", "RACE CATEGORY", "GENDER CATEGORY" and "ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE CATEGORY" fields. If it's filled out, it means that the author of this document believed the grant was promoting DEI ideology in that way. Analyze the "AWARD DESCRIPTIONS" field and see if you can figure out why the author may have flagged it in this way. Write it in a way that is thorough and easy to understand with only one description per type and award.</p>
<p><code>citation_for_flag</code>: Extract a very concise text quoting the passage of "AWARDS DESCRIPTIONS" that backs up the "why_flagged" data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was only the first step in the analysis of the data:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of course, members of our staff reviewed and confirmed every detail before we published our story, and we called all the named people and agencies seeking comment, which remains a must-do even in the world of AI.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think journalists are particularly well positioned to take advantage of LLMs in this way, because a big part of journalism is about deriving the truth from multiple unreliable sources of information. Journalists are deeply familiar with fact-checking, which is a critical skill if you're going to report with the assistance of these powerful but unreliable models.</p>
<p>Agnel Philip:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The tech holds a ton of promise in lead generation and pointing us in the right direction. But in my experience, it still needs a lot of human supervision and vetting. If used correctly, it can both really speed up the process of understanding large sets of information, and if you‚Äôre creative with your prompts and critically read the output, it can help uncover things that you may not have thought of.</p>
</blockquote>

## Something Is Rotten in the State of Cupertino

date: 2025-03-14, updated: 2025-03-14, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/something_is_rotten_in_the_state_of_cupertino">Something Is Rotten in the State of Cupertino</a></strong></p>
John Gruber's blazing takedown of Apple's failure to ship many of the key Apple Intelligence features they've been actively promoting for the past twelve months.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fiasco here is not that Apple is late on AI. It's also not that they had to announce an embarrassing delay on promised features last week. Those are problems, not fiascos, and problems happen. They're inevitable. [...] The fiasco is that Apple pitched a story that wasn't true, one that <em>some</em> people within the company surely understood wasn't true, and they set a course based on that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>John divides the Apple Intelligence features into the ones that were demonstrated to members of the press (including himself) at various events over the past year compared to things like "personalized Siri" that were only ever shown as concept videos. The ones that were demonstrated have all shipped. The concept video features are <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/8/delaying-personalized-siri/">indeterminably delayed</a>.

## Merklemap runs a 16TB PostgreSQL

date: 2025-03-14, updated: 2025-03-14, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43364668#43365833">Merklemap runs a 16TB PostgreSQL</a></strong></p>
Interesting thread on Hacker News where Pierre Barre describes the database architecture behind <a href="https://www.merklemap.com/">Merklemap</a>, a certificate transparency search engine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I run a 100 billion+ rows Postgres database [0], that is around 16TB, it's pretty painless!</p>
<p>There are a few tricks that make it run well (PostgreSQL compiled with a non-standard block size, ZFS, careful VACUUM planning). But nothing too out of the ordinary.</p>
<p>ATM, I insert about 150,000 rows a second, run 40,000 transactions a second, and read 4 million rows a second.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>It's self-hosted on bare metal, with standby replication, normal settings, nothing "weird" there.</p>
<p>6 NVMe drives in raidz-1, 1024GB of memory, a 96 core AMD EPYC cpu.</p>

Binary distributions, source distributions, and documentation are available at
<a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/9.12.2">downloads.haskell.org</a>.</p>
<p>We hope to have this release available via <code>ghcup</code> shortly. This is a small
release fixing a critical code generation bug, <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/25653">#25653</a>, affecting some subword
division operations.</p>
<p>As always, GHC‚Äôs release status, including planned future releases, can
be found on the GHC Wiki <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/GHC-status">status</a>.</p>
<p>We would like to thank IOG, the Zw3rk stake pool,
Well-Typed, Tweag I/O, Serokell, Equinix, SimSpace, the Haskell
Foundation, and other anonymous contributors whose on-going financial

## Adding AI-generated descriptions to my tools collection

date: 2025-03-13, updated: 2025-03-13, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p>The <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon">/colophon</a> page on my <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/">tools.simonwillison.net</a> site lists all 78 of the HTML+JavaScript tools I've built (with <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-assisted-programming/">AI assistance</a>) along with their commit histories, including links to prompting transcripts. I wrote about <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/11/using-llms-for-code/#a-detailed-example">how I built that colophon</a> the other day. It now also includes a description of each tool, generated using Claude 3.7 Sonnet.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/colophon-llm-prices.jpg" alt="llm-prices.html # The LLM Pricing Calculator helps you estimate costs when using various large language models. Enter the number of input tokens (your prompts) and output tokens (AI responses), along with their respective pricing per million tokens, to calculate the total cost in both dollars and cents. The calculator includes a comprehensive list of preset pricing for popular models like GPT-4o, Claude 3, Gemini, and more. Each preset displays the cost per million tokens for both input and output, which automatically populates the calculator fields when selected. The calculator updates in real-time as you modify values, making it easy to compare costs across different models or estimate expenses for specific usage scenarios. 148bc1 October 16, 2024 20:50 Create llm-prices.html https://gist.github.com/simonw/6b684b5f7d75fb82034fc963cc487530 2e0a70 October 25, 2024 16:32 o1-preview and o1-mini " style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<p>This is the single largest chunk of AI-generated text I've ever published on the indexable web. I share lots of LLM transcripts but I usually put them in a secret Gist such that they'll be kept out of search engines.</p>
<p>On the one hand this feels <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/slop/">slop adjacent</a> - but I was never going to write documentation for all 78 of those little experiments, yet I find myself forgetting details of how they worked. Just one example: my <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon#csv-marker-map.html">CSV marker map</a> tool which I built last year for knocking out an <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/csv-marker-map?center=39.061909385087624%2C-96.50390625000001&amp;zoom=5&amp;csv=https%3A%2F%2Fgist.githubusercontent.com%2Fsimonw%2Fdb5c00b61abb61847ece2480d96e96d2%2Fraw%2Fb76475d9f25dec235b89822ed54f9f1b84394df3%2Fsightings.csv">ad-hoc Bigfoot sightings map</a> and then promptly forgot what it could do.</p>
<p>Here's what I got when I ran:</p>
<pre><code>cat csv-marker-map.html | llm -m claude-3.7-sonnet \
  --system "Write a paragraph of documentation for this page as markdown. Do not include a heading. Do not use words like just or simply."
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>This interactive map displays markers based on data from a CSV file. Load data by adding <code>?csv=URL</code> to the page URL, where the CSV must include <code>latitude</code> and <code>longitude</code> columns. You can customize the map with several URL parameters: <code>center</code> (coordinates in format <code>lat,lng</code>), <code>zoom</code> (zoom level), <code>q</code> (location to search for), <code>marker</code> (add individual markers at coordinates), and <code>color</code> (change the default marker color). The map automatically updates the URL as you navigate, preserving your current view. Markers from CSV files appear as small colored circles on the map, while markers specified directly in the URL use the default Leaflet marker style.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's genuinely useful. I <a href="https://claude.ai/share/6a07415a-6f72-4e79-90c2-7dc780d60a0d">got Claude</a> to write me a <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/write_docs.py">write_docs.py</a> script to loop through all 78 files and generate <code>filename.docs.md</code> descriptions that live in the repo, then <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/blame/5322f55a2e7006541e80a5ffe13aeb89c74c6cef/build_colophon.py#L195-L213">updated build_colophon.py</a> to include those descriptions if they exist.</p>
<p>It cost about $1.08 in Claude credits to document all 78 tools, because some of those HTML files were quite long so the input tokens added up.</p>
<p>Each of the documentation files includes a comment with the most recent commit hash of the file that was used to generate the document, like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!-- Generated from commit: 7c6af8eeabc7682b5f9ec2621e34bc771c5471d8 --&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The script can use this to spot if a tool has been updated - if so, the documentation will be regenerated.</p>
<p>Add this all together and now I can drop new HTML+JavaScript tools into my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools">simonw/tools</a> repo and, moments later, they'll be published on <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/">tools.simonwillison.net</a> with auto-generated descriptions added to my <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon">colophon</a>. I think that's pretty neat!</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: I decided that the descriptions were too long, so I modified the script to add "Keep it to 2-3 sentences" to the end of the system prompt. These new, shorter descriptions are now live - <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/commit/b9eadb0255e269d865ec1ba3c385760cac7b15b7">here's the diff</a>. Total usage was 283,528 input tokens and 6,010 output tokens for a cost of 94 cents.</p>
<p>The new, shorter description for <code>csv-marker-map.html</code> looks like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This page creates an interactive map with markers based on CSV data. It accepts parameters in the URL to set the center, zoom level, search query, individual markers, and a CSV file URL for bulk marker placement. The markers are displayed on an OpenStreetMap base layer, and the map view automatically updates the URL when panned or zoomed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For comparison, here's a copy of <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/colophon-longer-descriptions.html">the previous colophon</a> with the longer descriptions.</p>

## Xata Agent

date: 2025-03-13, updated: 2025-03-13, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/xataio/agent">Xata Agent</a></strong></p>
Xata are a hosted PostgreSQL company who also develop the open source <a href="https://github.com/xataio/pgroll">pgroll</a> and <a href="https://github.com/xataio/pgstream">pgstream</a> schema migration tools.</p>
<p>Their new "Agent" tool is a system that helps monitor and optimize a PostgreSQL server using prompts to LLMs.</p>
<p>Any time I see a new tool like this I go hunting for the prompts. It looks like the main system prompts for orchestrating the tool <a href="https://github.com/xataio/agent/blob/69329cede85d4bc920558c019df51f111cc5068d/apps/dbagent/src/lib/ai/aidba.ts#L25-L48">live here</a> - here's a sample:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Provide clear, concise, and accurate responses to questions.
Use the provided tools to get context from the PostgreSQL database to answer questions.
When asked why a query is slow, call the explainQuery tool and also take into account the table sizes.
During the initial assessment use the getTablesAndInstanceInfo, getPerfromanceAndVacuumSettings, 
and getPostgresExtensions tools. 
When asked to run a playbook, use the getPlaybook tool to get the playbook contents. Then use the contents of the playbook
as an action plan. Execute the plan step by step.</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The really interesting thing is those playbooks, each of which is implemented as a prompt in the <a href="https://github.com/xataio/agent/blob/69329cede85d4bc920558c019df51f111cc5068d/apps/dbagent/src/lib/tools/playbooks.ts">lib/tools/playbooks.ts</a> file. There are six of these so far:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>SLOW_QUERIES_PLAYBOOK</code></li>
<li><code>GENERAL_MONITORING_PLAYBOOK</code></li>
<li><code>TUNING_PLAYBOOK</code></li>
<li><code>INVESTIGATE_HIGH_CPU_USAGE_PLAYBOOK</code></li>
<li><code>INVESTIGATE_HIGH_CONNECTION_COUNT_PLAYBOOK</code></li>
<li><code>INVESTIGATE_LOW_MEMORY_PLAYBOOK</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Here's the full text of <code>INVESTIGATE_LOW_MEMORY_PLAYBOOK</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>Objective:
To investigate and resolve low freeable memory in the PostgreSQL database.

Step 1:
Get the freeable memory metric using the tool getInstanceMetric.

Step 3:
Get the instance details and compare the freeable memory with the amount of memory available.

Step 4:
Check the logs for any indications of memory pressure or out of memory errors. If there are, make sure to report that to the user. Also this would mean that the situation is critical.

Step 4:
Check active queries. Use the tool getConnectionsGroups to get the currently active queries. If a user or application stands out for doing a lot of work, record that to indicate to the user.

Step 5:
Check the work_mem setting and shared_buffers setting. Think if it would make sense to reduce these in order to free up memory.

Step 6:
If there is no clear root cause for using memory, suggest to the user to scale up the Postgres instance. Recommend a particular instance class.
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the first time I've seen prompts arranged in a "playbooks" pattern like this. What a weird and interesting way to write software!

## Anthropic API: Text editor tool

date: 2025-03-13, updated: 2025-03-13, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use/text-editor-tool">Anthropic API: Text editor tool</a></strong></p>
Anthropic released a new "tool" today for text editing. It looks similar to the tool they offered as part of their <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/computer-use#understand-anthropic-defined-tools">computer use beta API</a>, and the trick they've been using for a while in both Claude Artifacts and the new <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview">Claude Code</a> to more efficiently edit files there.</p>
<p>The new tool requires you to implement several commands:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>view</code> - to view a specified file - either the whole thing or a specified range</li>
<li><code>str_replace</code> - execute an exact string match replacement on a file</li>
<li><code>create</code> - create a new file with the specified contents</li>
<li><code>insert</code> - insert new text after a specified line number</li>
<li><code>undo_edit</code> - undo the last edit made to a specific file</li>
</ul>
<p>Providing implementations of these commands is left as an exercise for the developer.</p>
<p>Once implemented, you can have conversations with Claude where it knows that it can request the content of existing files, make modifications to them and create new ones.</p>
<p>There's quite a lot of assembly required to start using this. I tried <a href="https://claude.ai/share/97bde411-20d4-4549-a34f-27954a5ab564">vibe coding an implementation</a> by dumping a copy of the documentation into Claude itself but I didn't get as far as a working program - it looks like I'd need to spend a bunch more time on that to get something to work, so my effort is currently abandoned.</p>
<p>This was introduced as in a post on <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/token-saving-updates">Token-saving updates on the Anthropic API</a>, which also included a simplification of their token caching API and a new <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use/token-efficient-tool-use">Token-efficient tool use (beta)</a> where sending a <code>token-efficient-tools-2025-02-19</code> beta header to Claude 3.7 Sonnet can save 14-70% of the tokens needed to define tools and schemas.

## Introducing Command A: Max performance, minimal compute

date: 2025-03-13, updated: 2025-03-13, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://cohere.com/blog/command-a">Introducing Command A: Max performance, minimal compute</a></strong></p>
New LLM release from Cohere. It's interesting to see which aspects of the model they're highlighting, as an indicator of what their commercial customers value the most (highlights mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Command A delivers maximum performance with minimal hardware costs when compared to leading proprietary and open-weights models, such as GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3. For private deployments, <strong>Command A excels on business-critical agentic and multilingual tasks, while being deployable on just two GPUs</strong>, compared to other models that typically require as many as 32. [...]</p>
<p>With a serving footprint of just two A100s or H100s, it requires far less compute than other comparable models on the market. This is especially important for private deployments. [...]</p>
<p>Its <strong>256k context length</strong> (2x most leading models) can handle much longer enterprise documents. Other key features include Cohere‚Äôs advanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with <strong>verifiable citations</strong>, agentic tool use, enterprise-grade security, and strong multilingual performance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's open weights but very much not open source - the license is <a href="https://cohere.com/c4ai-cc-by-nc-license">Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial</a> and also requires adhering to their <a href="https://docs.cohere.com/docs/c4ai-acceptable-use-policy">Acceptable Use Policy</a>.</p>
<p>Cohere offer it for commercial use via "contact us" pricing or through their API. I released <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-command-r/releases/tag/0.3">llm-command-r 0.3</a> adding support for this new model, plus their smaller and faster <a href="https://cohere.com/blog/command-r7b">Command R7B</a> (released in December) and support for structured outputs via <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/schemas.html">LLM schemas</a>.</p>
<p>(I found <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-command-r/issues/8#issuecomment-2722598353">a weird bug</a> with their schema support where schemas that end in an integer output a seemingly limitless integer - in my experiments it affected Command R and the new Command A but not Command R7B.)

date: 2025-03-13, from: Michael Tsai

SE-0463: The @Sendable annotation indicates that closure parameters are passed over an isolation boundary before they&#8217;re called. A missing @Sendable annotation in a library has negative effects on clients who call the function; the caller can unknowingly introduce data races, and SE-0423: Dynamic actor isolation enforcement from non-strict-concurrency contexts injects runtime assertions for non-Sendable closure [&#8230;]

## Technical writing has a depth issue

date: 2025-03-13, from: Blog by Fabrizio Ferri-Benedetti

<p>Demoralized by the advent of LLMs, I see tech writing communities break ranks and flee. In a world where coders who write seem to muster more respect than writers who code, the response from tech writers to the challenges posed by the intersection of automation, multichannel delivery, and docs-as-code is weak, if not absent. Conferences and blogs mostly focus on soothing anxiety and perfecting praxis. Nothing wrong with that, of course, except that it‚Äôs an intellectual dead end.</p>

## Smoke test your Django admin site

date: 2025-03-13, updated: 2025-03-13, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://jmduke.com/posts/post/django-admin-changelist-test/">Smoke test your Django admin site</a></strong></p>
Justin Duke demonstrates a neat pattern for running simple tests against your internal Django admin site: introspect every admin route via <code>django.urls.get_resolver()</code> and loop through them with <code>@pytest.mark.parametrize</code> to check they all return a 200 HTTP status code.</p>
<p>This catches simple mistakes with the admin configuration that trigger exceptions that might otherwise go undetected.</p>
<p>I rarely write automated tests against my own admin sites and often feel guilty about it. I wrote <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/django/testing-django-admin-with-pytest">some notes</a> on testing it with <a href="https://pytest-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/helpers.html#fixtures">pytest-django fixtures</a> a few years ago.

date: 2025-03-12, updated: 2025-03-12, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p>Google's Gemma team released an impressive new model today (under their not-open-source <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemma/terms">Gemma license</a>). Gemma 3 comes in four sizes - 1B, 4B, 12B, and 27B - and while 1B is text-only the larger three models are all multi-modal for vision:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gemma 3 introduces multimodality, supporting vision-language input and text outputs. It handles context windows up to 128k tokens, understands over 140 languages, and offers improved math, reasoning, and chat capabilities, including structured outputs and function calling.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's the <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/gemma/Gemma3Report.pdf">Gemma 3 Technical Report PDF</a>, which makes the big claim that they find "Gemma3-27B-IT comparable to Gemini-1.5-Pro across
benchmarks".</p>
<p>I tried out the largest model using the latest <a href="https://ollama.com/">Ollama</a> - this is the second time I've spotted a major model release partnering with Ollama on launch day, the first being <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/30/mistral-small-3/">Mistral Small 3</a>.</p>
<p>I ran this (after upgrading Ollama through their menu icon upgrade option):</p>
<pre><code>ollama pull gemma3:27b
</code></pre>
<p>That pulled 17GB of model weights. I've been trying it out using <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a> and <a href="https://github.com/taketwo/llm-ollama">llm-ollama</a>:</p>
<pre><code>llm install llm-ollama
llm -m gemma3:27b 'Build a single page HTML+CSS+JavaScript UI that gives me a large textarea for writing in which constantly saves what I have entered to localStorage (restoring when I reload the page) and displays a word counter'
</code></pre>
<p>That was a replay of <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon#word-counter.html">a prompt</a> I ran against Claude Artifacts a few months ago. Here's <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/gemma3-word-count.html">what Gemma built</a>, and the <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/f8a87f2242439d3974405a17f5d8bc23">full chat transcript</a>. It's a simple example but it worked just right.</p>

<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/gemma-word-count.gif" alt="Animated demo - a simple textarea, I type text in it and a word count updates above." /></p>

<p>Let's try out the vision mode, by asking it to describe this photo:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/two-pelicans.jpg" alt="Two pelicans flying against a blue sky " style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<pre><code>llm -m gemma3:27b describe -a https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/two-pelicans.jpg
</code></pre>
<p>Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/0e703ba72d0cf5a6dd117981bd03e604">the full response</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Overall Impression:</strong></p>
<p>The image features two brown pelicans in flight against a solid, bright blue background. The composition is dynamic, capturing the birds mid-wingbeat.</p>
<p><strong>Details:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Pelicans:</strong> Both pelicans are a rich, dark brown color. They have large, pale yellow-orange beaks and pouches. One pelican is shown with its wings fully extended, appearing to be gliding or soaring. The other is captured with its wings in a more dynamic, upward-sweeping motion.</li>
<li>
<strong>Background:</strong> The background is a flat, uniform shade of bright blue, which makes the pelicans stand out.</li>
<li>
<strong>Composition:</strong> The birds are positioned in opposite directions, creating a sense of movement and balance. The image is well-lit, highlighting the texture of the pelicans' feathers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overall, the image is a striking and visually appealing depiction of these majestic birds in flight.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is it right to say "the birds are positioned in opposite directions"? I thought that was a mistake at first, but I'll give it a pass since their wings are positioned in opposite directions to each other.</p>

<p>Something I've been curious about recently is longer context support: how well can a local model on my laptop deal with summarization or data extraction tasks against longer pieces of text?</p>
<p>I decided to try <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/llms/claude-hacker-news-themes#user-content-adding-a--m-model-option">my Hacker News summarize script</a> using Gemma, against <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43340491">the thread</a> there discussing the Gemma 3 technical paper.</p>
<p>First I did a quick token count (using the OpenAI tokenizer but it's usually a similar number to other models):</p>
<pre><code>curl 'https://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/items/43340491' | ttok
</code></pre>
<p>This returned 22,260 - well within Gemma's documented limits but still a healthy number considering just last year most models topped out at 4,000 or 8,000.</p>
<p>I ran my script like this:</p>
<pre><code>hn-summary.sh 43340491 -m gemma3:27b
</code></pre>
<p>It did a pretty good job! Here's the <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/ab487ea3d1605e719dc2950cd4565146">full prompt and response</a>. The one big miss is that it ignored my instructions to include illustrative quotes - I don't know if modifying the prompt will fix that but it's disappointing that it didn't handle that well, given how important direct quotes are for building confidence in RAG-style responses.</p>
<p>Here's what I got for <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/f79c4bd2fbe966e1b600cb8b41cae810">Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle</a>:</p>
<pre><code>llm -m gemma3:27b 'Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle'
</code></pre>

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/gemma-3-pelican.svg" alt="A collection of abstract shapes, definitely not a pelican on a bicycle" /></p>

<p>You can also try out the new Gemma <a href="https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat?model=gemma-3-27b-it">in Google AI Studio</a>, and via their API. I added support for it to <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-gemini/releases/tag/0.15">llm-gemini 0.15</a>, though sadly it appears vision mode doesn't work with that API hosted model yet.</p>
<pre><code>llm install -U llm-gemini
llm keys set gemini
# paste key here
llm -m gemma-3-27b-it 'five facts about pelicans of interest to skunks'
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/bc22062e60e5af3faf458756cb368d0e">Here's what I got</a>. I'm not sure how pricing works for that hosted model.</p>
<p>Gemma 3 is also already available <a href="https://github.com/Blaizzy/mlx-vlm/pull/235">through MLX-VLM</a> - here's <a href="https://huggingface.co/collections/mlx-community/gemma-3-67d14a10480a436ad478b0f9">the MLX model collection</a> - but I haven't tried that version yet.</p>

## OpenAI Agents SDK

date: 2025-03-11, updated: 2025-03-11, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/">OpenAI Agents SDK</a></strong></p>
OpenAI's other big announcement today (<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/11/responses-vs-chat-completions/">see also</a>) - a Python library (<a href="https://pypi.org/project/openai-agents/">openai-agents</a>) for building "agents", which is a replacement for their previous <a href="https://github.com/openai/swarm">swarm</a> research project.</p>
<p>In this project, an "agent" is a class that configures an LLM with a system prompt an access to specific tools.</p>
<p>An interesting concept in this one is the concept of <strong><a href="https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/handoffs/">handoffs</a></strong>, where one agent can chose to hand execution over to a different system-prompt-plus-tools agent treating it almost like a tool itself. This code example illustrates the idea:</p>
<pre><span class="pl-k">from</span> <span class="pl-s1">agents</span> <span class="pl-k">import</span> <span class="pl-v">Agent</span>, <span class="pl-s1">handoff</span>

<span class="pl-s1">billing_agent</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-en">Agent</span>(
    <span class="pl-s1">name</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span><span class="pl-s">"Billing agent"</span>
)
<span class="pl-s1">refund_agent</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-en">Agent</span>(
    <span class="pl-s1">name</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span><span class="pl-s">"Refund agent"</span>
)
<span class="pl-s1">triage_agent</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-en">Agent</span>(
    <span class="pl-s1">name</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span><span class="pl-s">"Triage agent"</span>,
    <span class="pl-s1">handoffs</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span>[<span class="pl-s1">billing_agent</span>, <span class="pl-en">handoff</span>(<span class="pl-s1">refund_agent</span>)]
)</pre>

<p>The library also includes <a href="https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/guardrails/">guardrails</a> - classes you can add that attempt to filter user input to make sure it fits expected criteria. Bits of this look suspiciously like trying to <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Sep/17/prompt-injection-more-ai/">solve AI security problems with more AI</a> to me.

## OpenAI API: Responses vs. Chat Completions

date: 2025-03-11, updated: 2025-03-11, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/responses-vs-chat-completions">OpenAI API: Responses vs. Chat Completions</a></strong></p>
OpenAI released a bunch of new API platform features this morning under the headline "<a href="https://openai.com/index/new-tools-for-building-agents/">New tools for building agents</a>" (their somewhat mushy interpretation of "agents" here is "systems that independently accomplish tasks on behalf of users").</p>
<p>A particularly significant change is the introduction of a new <strong>Responses API</strong>, which is a slightly different shape from the Chat Completions API that they've offered for the past couple of years and which others in the industry have widely cloned as an ad-hoc standard.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/responses-vs-chat-completions">this guide</a> they illustrate the differences, with a reassuring note that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Chat Completions API is an industry standard for building AI applications, and we intend to continue supporting this API indefinitely. We're introducing the Responses API to simplify workflows involving tool use, code execution, and state management. We believe this new API primitive will allow us to more effectively enhance the OpenAI platform into the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An API that <em>is</em> going away is the <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/assistants">Assistants API</a>, a perpetual beta first launched at OpenAI DevDay in 2023. The new responses API solves effectively the same problems but better, and assistants will be sunset "in the first half of 2026".</p>
<p>The best illustration I've seen of the differences between the two is this <a href="https://github.com/openai/openai-python/commit/2954945ecc185259cfd7cd33c8cbc818a88e4e1b">giant commit</a> to the <code>openai-python</code> GitHub repository updating ALL of the example code in one go.</p>
<p>The most important feature of the Responses API (a feature it shares with the old Assistants API) is that it can manage conversation state on the server for you. An oddity of the Chat Completions API is that you need to maintain your own records of the current conversation, sending back full copies of it with each new prompt. You end up making API calls that look like this (from <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/conversation-state?api-mode=chat&amp;lang=javascript#manually-manage-conversation-state">their examples</a>):</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-json"><pre>{
    <span class="pl-ent">"model"</span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>gpt-4o-mini<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>,
    <span class="pl-ent">"messages"</span>: [
        {
            <span class="pl-ent">"role"</span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>user<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>,
            <span class="pl-ent">"content"</span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>knock knock.<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>,
        },
        {
            <span class="pl-ent">"role"</span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>assistant<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>,
            <span class="pl-ent">"content"</span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>Who's there?<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>,
        },
        {
            <span class="pl-ent">"role"</span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>user<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>,
            <span class="pl-ent">"content"</span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>Orange.<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>
        }
    ]
}</pre></div>

<p>These can get long and unwieldy - especially when attachments such as images are involved - but the real challenge is when you start integrating tools: in a conversation with tool use you'll need to maintain that full state <em>and</em> drop messages in that show the output of the tools the model requested. It's not a trivial thing to work with.</p>
<p>The new Responses API continues to support this list of messages format, but you also get the option to outsource that to OpenAI entirely: you can add a new <code>"store": true</code> property and then in subsequent messages include a <code>"previous_response_id: response_id</code> key to continue that conversation.</p>
<p>This feels a whole lot more natural than the Assistants API, which required you to think in terms of <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview#objects">threads, messages and runs</a> to achieve the same effect.</p>
<p>Also fun: the Response API <a href="https://twitter.com/athyuttamre/status/1899541484308971822">supports HTML form encoding</a> now in addition to JSON:</p>
<pre><code>curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \
  -u :$OPENAI_API_KEY \
  -d model="gpt-4o" \

</code></pre>
<p>I found that in an excellent <a href="https://twitter.com/athyuttamre/status/1899541471532867821">Twitter thread</a> providing background on the design decisions in the new API from OpenAI's Atty Eleti. Here's <a href="https://nitter.net/athyuttamre/status/1899541471532867821">a nitter link</a> for people who don't have a Twitter account.</p>
<h4>New built-in tools</h4>
<p>A potentially more exciting change today is the introduction of default tools that you can request while using the new Responses API. There are three of these, all of which can be specified in the <code>"tools": [...]</code> array.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>{"type": "web_search_preview"}</code> - the same search feature available through ChatGPT. The documentation doesn't clarify which underlying search engine is used - I initially assumed Bing, but the tool documentation links to this <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/bots">Overview of OpenAI Crawlers</a> page so maybe it's entirely in-house now? Web search <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/pricing#web-search">is priced</a> at between $25 and $50 per thousand queries depending on if you're using GPT-4o or GPT-4o mini and the configurable size of your "search context".</li>
<li><code>{"type": "file_search", "vector_store_ids": [...]}</code> provides integration with the latest version of their <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-file-search">file search</a> vector store, mainly used for RAG. "Usage is priced‚Å† at $2.50 per thousand queries and file storage at $0.10/GB/day, with the first GB free".</li>
<li><code>{"type": "computer_use_preview", "display_width": 1024, "display_height": 768, "environment": "browser"}</code> is the most surprising to me: it's tool access to the <a href="https://openai.com/index/computer-using-agent/">Computer-Using Agent</a> system they built for their Operator product. This one is going to be <em>a lot</em> of fun to explore. The tool's documentation includes a warning <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-computer-use#beware-of-prompt-injections">about prompt injection risks</a>. Though on closer inspection I think this may work more like <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/22/computer-use/">Claude Computer Use</a>, where you have to <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-computer-use#setting-up-your-environment">run the sandboxed environment yourself</a> rather than outsource that difficult part to them.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm still thinking through how to expose these new features in my <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a> tool, which is made harder by the fact that a number of plugins now rely on the default OpenAI implementation from core, which is currently built on top of Chat Completions. I've been worrying for a while about the impact of our entire industry building clones of one proprietary API that might change in the future, I guess now we get to see how that shakes out!

<blockquote cite="https://github.com/microsoft/typescript-go/discussions/411"><p>Languages that allow for a structurally similar codebase offer a significant boon for anyone making code changes because we can easily port changes between the two codebases. In contrast, languages that require fundamental rethinking of memory management, mutation, data structuring, polymorphism, laziness, etc., might be a better fit for a ground-up rewrite, but we're undertaking this more as a <em>port</em> that maintains the existing behavior and critical optimizations we've built into the language. Idiomatic Go strongly resembles the existing coding patterns of the TypeScript codebase, which makes this porting effort much more tractable.</p></blockquote>

## Here's how I use LLMs to help me write code

date: 2025-03-11, updated: 2025-03-11, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p>Online discussions about <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-assisted-programming/">using Large Language Models to help write code</a> inevitably produce comments from developers who's experiences have been disappointing. They often ask what they're doing wrong - how come some people are reporting such great results when their own experiments have proved lacking?</p>
<p>Using LLMs to write code is <strong>difficult</strong> and <strong>unintuitive</strong>. It takes significant effort to figure out the sharp and soft edges of using them in this way, and there's precious little guidance to help people figure out how best to apply them.</p>
<p>If someone tells you that coding with LLMs is <em>easy</em> they are (probably unintentionally) misleading you. They may well have stumbled on to patterns that work, but those patterns do not come naturally to everyone.</p>
<p>I've been getting great results out of LLMs for code for over two years now. Here's my attempt at transferring some of that experience and intution to you.</p>

</ul>


<h4 id="set-reasonable-expectations">Set reasonable expectations</h4>
<p>Ignore the "AGI" hype - LLMs are still fancy autocomplete. All they do is predict a sequence of tokens - but it turns out writing code is mostly about stringing tokens together in the right order, so they can be <em>extremely</em> useful for this provided you point them in the right direction.</p>
<p>If you assume that this technology will implement your project perfectly without you needing to exercise any of your own skill you'll quickly be disappointed.</p>
<p>Instead, use them to <em>augment</em> your abilities. My current favorite mental model is to think of them as an over-confident pair programming assistant who's lightning fast at looking things up, can churn out relevant examples at a moment's notice and can execute on tedious tasks without complaint.</p>
<p><strong>Over-confident</strong> is important. They'll absolutely make mistakes - sometimes subtle, sometimes huge. These mistakes can be <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/2/kellan-elliott-mccrea/">deeply inhuman</a> - if a human collaborator hallucinated a non-existent library or method you would instantly lose trust in them. Don't fall into the trap of anthropomorphizing LLMs and assuming that failures which would discredit a human should discredit the machine in the same way.</p>
<p>When working with LLMs you'll often find things that they just cannot do. Make a note of these - they are useful lessons! They're also valuable examples to stash away for the future - a sign of a strong new model is when it produces usable results for a task that previous models had been unable to handle.</p>
<h4 id="account-for-training-cut-off-dates">Account for training cut-off dates</h4>
<p>A crucial characteristic of any model is its <strong>training cut-off date</strong>. This is the date at which the data they were trained on stopped being collected. For OpenAI's models this is usually October of 2023. Anthropic and Gemini and other providers may have more recent dates.</p>
<p>This is <em>extremely</em> important for code, because it influences what libraries they will be familiar with. If the library you are using had a major breaking change since October 2023, OpenAI models won't know about it!</p>
<p>I gain enough value from LLMs that I now deliberately consider this when picking a library - I try to stick with libraries with good stability and that are popular enough that many examples of them will have made it into the training data. I like applying the principles of <a href="https://boringtechnology.club/">boring technology</a> - innovate on your project's unique selling points, stick with tried and tested solutions for everything else.</p>
<p>LLMs can still help you work with libraries that exist outside their training data, but you need to put in more work - you'll need to feed them recent examples of how those libraries should be used as part of your prompt.</p>
<p>This brings us to the most important thing to understand when working with LLMs:</p>
<h4 id="context-is-king">Context is king</h4>
<p>Most of the craft of getting good results out of an LLM comes down to managing its context - the text that is part of your current conversation.</p>
<p>This context isn't just the prompt that you have fed it: successful LLM interactions usually take the form of conversations, and the context consists of every message from you <em>and</em> every reply from the LLM that exist in the current conversation thread.</p>
<p>When you start a new conversation you reset that context back to zero. This is important to know, as often the fix for a conversation that has stopped being useful is to wipe the slate clean and start again.</p>
<p>Some LLM coding tools go beyond just the conversation. Claude Projects for example allow you to pre-populate the context with quite a large amount of text - including a recent ability to <a href="https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/10167454-using-the-github-integration">import code directly from a GitHub</a> repository which I'm using a <em>lot</em>.</p>
<p>Tools like Cursor and VS Code Copilot include context from your current editor session and file layout automatically, and you can sometimes use mechanisms like <a href="https://docs.cursor.com/context/@-symbols/overview">Cursor's @commands</a> to pull in additional files or documentation.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I mostly work directly with the <a href="https://chatgpt.com/">ChatGPT</a> and <a href="https://claude.ai/">Claude</a> web or app interfaces is that it makes it easier for me to understand exactly what is going into the context. LLM tools that obscure that context from me are <em>less</em> effective.</p>
<p>You can use the fact that previous replies are also part of the context to your advantage. For complex coding tasks try getting the LLM to write a simpler version first, check that it works and then iterate on building to the more sophisticated implementation.</p>
<p>I often start a new chat by dumping in existing code to seed that context, then work with the LLM to modify it in some way.</p>
<p>One of my favorite code prompting techniques is to drop in several full examples relating to something I want to build, then prompt the LLM to use them as inspiration for a new project. I wrote about that in detail when I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Mar/30/ocr-pdfs-images/">described my JavaScript OCR application</a> that combines Tesseract.js and PDF.js - two libraries I had used in the past and for which I could provide working examples in the prompt.</p>
<h4 id="ask-them-for-options">Ask them for options</h4>
<p>Most of my projects start with some open questions: is the thing I'm trying to do possible? What are the potential ways I could implement it? Which of those options are the <em>best</em>?</p>
<p>I use LLMs as part of this initial research phase.</p>
<p>I'll use prompts like "what are options for HTTP libraries in Rust? Include usage examples" - or "what are some useful drag-and-drop libraries in JavaScript? Build me an artifact demonstrating each one" (to Claude).</p>
<p>The training cut-off is relevant here, since it means newer libraries won't be suggested. Usually that's OK - I don't want the latest, I want the most stable and the one that has been around for long enough for the bugs to be ironed out.</p>
<p>If I'm going to use something more recent I'll do that research myself, outside of LLM world.</p>
<p>The best way to start any project is with a prototype that proves that the key requirements of that project can be met. I often find that an LLM can get me to that working prototype within a few minutes of me sitting down with my laptop - or sometimes even while working on my phone.</p>
<h4 id="tell-them-exactly-what-to-do">Tell them exactly what to do</h4>
<p>Once I've completed the initial research I change modes dramatically. For production code my LLM usage is much more authoritarian: I treat it like a digital intern, hired to type code for me based on my detailed instructions.</p>
<p>Here's a recent example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write a Python function that uses asyncio httpx with this signature:</p>
<pre><code>async def download_db(url, max_size_bytes=5 * 1025 * 1025): -&gt; pathlib.Path
</code></pre>
<p>Given a URL, this downloads the database to a temp directory and returns a path to it. BUT it checks the content length header at the start of streaming back that data and, if it's more than the limit, raises an error. When the download finishes it uses <code>sqlite3.connect(...)</code> and then runs a <code>PRAGMA quick_check</code> to confirm the SQLite data is valid - raising an error if not. Finally, if the content length header lies to us -  if it says 2MB but we download 3MB - we get an error raised as soon as we notice that problem.</p>

<p>I could write this function myself, but it would take me the better part of fifteen minutes to look up all of the details and get the code working right. Claude knocked it out <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/5aed8bd87016c77465c23e0dc4563ec9">in 15 seconds</a>.</p>
<p>I find LLMs respond extremely well to function signatures like the one I use here. I get to act as the function designer, the LLM does the work of building the body to my specification.</p>
<p>I'll often follow-up with "Now write me the tests using pytest". Again, I dictate my technology of choice - I want the LLM to save me the time of having to type out the code that's sitting in my head already.</p>
<p>If your reaction to this is "surely typing out the code is faster than typing out an English instruction of it", all I can tell you is that it really isn't for me any more. Code needs to be correct. English has enormous room for shortcuts, and vagaries, and typos, and saying things like "use that popular HTTP library" if you can't remember the name off the top of your head.</p>
<p>The good coding LLMs are excellent at filling in the gaps. They're also much less lazy than me - they'll remember to catch likely exceptions, add accurate docstrings, and annotate code with the relevant types.</p>
<h4 id="you-have-to-test-what-it-writes-">You have to test what it writes!</h4>
<p>I wrote about this <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/2/hallucinations-in-code/#qa">at length last week</a>: the one thing you absolutely cannot outsource to the machine is testing that the code actually works.</p>
<p>Your responsibility as a software developer is to deliver working systems. If you haven't seen it run, it's not a working system. You need to invest in strengthening those manual QA habits.</p>
<p>This may not be glamorous but it's always been a critical part of shipping good code, with or without the involvement of LLMs.</p>
<h4 id="remember-it-s-a-conversation">Remember it's a conversation</h4>
<p>If I don't like what an LLM has written, they'll <em>never</em> complain at being told to refactor it! "Break that repetitive code out into a function", "use string manipulation methods rather than a regular expression", or even "write that better!" - the code an LLM produces first time is rarely the final implementation, but they can re-type it dozens of times for you without ever getting frustrated or bored.</p>
<p>Occasionally I'll get a great result from my first prompt - more frequently the more I practice - but I expect to need at least a few follow-ups.</p>
<p>I often wonder if this is one of the key tricks that people are missing - a bad initial result isn't a failure, it's a starting point for pushing the model in the direction of the thing you actually want.</p>
<h4 id="use-tools-that-can-run-the-code-for-you">Use tools that can run the code for you</h4>
<p>An increasing number of LLM coding tools now have the ability to <em>run that code</em> for you. I'm slightly cautious about some of these since there's a possibility of the wrong command causing real damage, so I tend to stick to the ones that run code in a safe sandbox. My favorites right now are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>ChatGPT Code Interpreter</strong>, where ChatGPT can write and then execute Python code directly in a Kubernetes sandbox VM managed by OpenAI. This is completely safe - it can't even make outbound network connections so really all that can happen is the temporary filesystem gets mangled and then reset.</li>
<li>
<strong>Claude Artifacts</strong>, where Claude can build you a full HTML+JavaScript+CSS web application that is displayed within the Claude interface. This web app is displayed in a <em>very</em> locked down iframe sandbox, greatly restricting what it can do but preventing problems like accidental exfiltration of your private Claude data.</li>
<li>
<strong>ChatGPT Canvas</strong> is a newer ChatGPT feature with similar capabilites to Claude Artifacts. I have not explored this enough myself yet.</li>
</ul>
<p>And if you're willing to live a little more dangerously:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong><a href="https://www.cursor.com/">Cursor</a></strong> has an "Agent" feature that can do this, as does <strong><a href="https://codeium.com/windsurf">Windsurf</a></strong> and a growing number of other editors. I haven't spent enough time with these to make recommendations yet.</li>
<li>
<strong><a href="https://aider.chat/">Aider</a></strong> is the leading open source implementation of these kinds of patterns, and is a great example of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food">dogfooding</a> - recent releases of Aider have been <a href="https://aider.chat/HISTORY.html">80%+ written</a> by Aider itself.</li>
<li>
<strong><a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview">Claude Code</a></strong> is Anthropic's new entrant into this space. I'll provide a detailed description of using that tool shortly.</li>
</ul>
<p>This run-the-code-in-a-loop pattern is so powerful that I chose my core LLM tools for coding based primarily on whether they can safely run and iterate on my code.</p>
<h4 id="vibe-coding-is-a-great-way-to-learn">Vibe-coding is a great way to learn</h4>
<p>Andrej Karpathy <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/6/andrej-karpathy/">coined the term</a> vibe-coding just over a month ago, and it has stuck:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There's a new kind of coding I call "vibe coding", where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists. [...] I ask for the dumbest things like "decrease the padding on the sidebar by half" because I'm too lazy to find it. I "Accept All" always, I don't read the diffs anymore. When I get error messages I just copy paste them in with no comment, usually that fixes it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Andrej suggests this is "not too bad for throwaway weekend projects". It's also a <em>fantastic</em> way to explore the capabilities of these models - and really fun.</p>
<p>The best way to learn LLMs is to play with them. Throwing absurd ideas at them and vibe-coding until they almost sort-of work is a genuinely useful way to accelerate the rate at which you build intuition for what works and what doesn't.</p>
<p>I've been vibe-coding since before Andrej gave it a name! My <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools">simonw/tools</a> GitHub repository has 77 HTML+JavaScript apps and 6 Python apps, and every single one of them was built by prompting LLMs. I have learned <em>so much</em> from building this collection, and I add to it at a rate of several new prototypes per week.</p>
<p>You can try most of mine out directly on <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/">tools.simonwillison.net</a> - a GitHub Pages published version of the repo. I wrote more detailed notes on some of these back in October in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/21/claude-artifacts/">Everything I built with Claude Artifacts this week</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to see the transcript of the chat used for each one it's almost always linked to in the commit history for that page - or visit the new <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon">colophon page</a> for an index that includes all of those links.</p>
<h4 id="a-detailed-example">A detailed example using Claude Code</h4>
<p>While I was writing this article I had the idea for that <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon">tools.simonwillison.net/colophon</a> page - I wanted something I could link to that showed the commit history of each of my tools in a more obvious way than GitHub.</p>
<p>I decided to use that as an opportunity to demonstrate my AI-assisted coding process.</p>
<p>For this one I used <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview">Claude Code</a>, because I wanted it to be able to run Python code directly against my existing tools repository on my laptop.</p>
<p>Running the <code>/cost</code> command at the end of my session showed me this:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; /cost 
  ‚éø  Total cost: $0.61
     Total duration (API): 5m 31.2s
     Total duration (wall): 17m 18.7s
</code></pre>
<p>The initial project took me just over 17 minutes from start to finish, and cost me 61 cents in API calls to Anthropic.</p>
<p>I used the authoritarian process where I told the model exactly what I wanted to build. Here's my sequence of prompts (<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/323e1b00ee4f8453c7834a7560eeafc1">full transcript here</a>).</p>
<p>I started by asking for an initial script to gather the data needed for the new page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Almost all of the HTML files in this directory were created using Claude prompts, and the details of those prompts are linked in the commit messages. Build a Python script that checks the commit history for each HTML file in turn and extracts any URLs from those commit messages into a list. It should then output a JSON file with this structure: {"pages": {"name-of-file.html": ["url"], {"name-of-file-2.html": ["url1", "url2"], ... - as you can see, some files may have more than one URL in their commit history. The script should be called gather_links.py and it should save a JSON file called gathered_links.json</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I really didn't think very hard about this first prompt - it was more of a stream of consciousness that I typed into the bot as I thought about the initial problem.</p>
<p>I inspected the initial result and spotted some problems:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It looks like it just got the start of the URLs, it should be getting the whole URLs which might be to different websites - so just get anything that starts https:// and ends with whitespace or the end of the commit message</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then I changed my mind - I wanted those full commit messages too:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Update the script - I want to capture the full commit messages AND the URLs - the new format should be {"pages": {"aria-live-regions.html": {"commits": [{"hash": hash, "message": message, "date": iso formatted date], "urls": [list of URLs like before]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Providing examples like this is a great shortcut to getting exactly what you want.</p>
<p>Note that at no point have I looked at the code it's written in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/87e2577983f11fc9c7bf7b7a268cf2404a21e1c5/gather_links.py">gather_links.py</a>! This is pure vibe-coding: I'm looking at what it's doing, but I've left the implementation details entirely up to the LLM.</p>
<p>The JSON looked good to me, so I said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is working great. Write me a new script called build_colophon.py which looks through that gathered JSON file and builds and saves an HTML page. The page should be mobile friendly and should list every page - with a link to that page - and for each one display the commit messages neatly (convert newlines to br and linkify URLs but no other formatting) - plus the commit message dates and links to the commits themselves which are in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools">https://github.com/simonw/tools</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Claude knows how GitHub URLs works, so telling it to link to the commits and providing the repo name was enough for it guess <code>https://github.com/simonw/tools/commit/fd9daf885c924ba277806b3440457d52b0ad90a8</code> for those commit URLs.</p>
<p>I tend to find Claude has good default taste when it comes to web page design - I said "the page should be mobile friendly" and left it at that.</p>
<p>Claude churned away and built me a page that wasn't right, so I said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it's not working right. ocr.html had a bunch of commits but in colophon.html there is only one link and heading for the first commit and the rest are shown within that same block - there should be separate HTML chunks with links and formatted dates for each of the other commits. Also the neatly formatted date should include the HH:MM as well as the date</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It fixed the bug all on its own, leaving just two changes I decided to make:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it's almost perfect, but each page should have the commits displayed in the opposite order - oldest first</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One last change - the pages are currently listed alphabetically, lets instead list them with the most recently modified at the top</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that was the entire project! Here's <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/1e04f12a1cacea8856946162457d0d77e60ee549/build_colophon.py">build_colophon.py</a>, and the page it generated came out <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/colophon.html">looking pretty good</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/colophon.jpg" alt="Tools Colophon. This page documents the creation of the tools on tools.simonwillison.net, including links to the Claude conversations used to build them. social-media-cropper.html b4a2bc December 10, 2024 20:35 Social media cropper  https://gist.github.com/simonw/12b8f88932a71450071190e1289a17e9 a10954 February 28, 2025 16:02 Support 2:1 and 14:10 ratios  https://gist.github.com/simonw/e23917eddcbb368c9b6180d581f8f40a" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<p>There was one remaining task: I needed to deploy the new colophon as part of my site, but I didn't want to check that new <code>colophon.html</code> page into the repository itself. I wanted a custom GitHub Pages build process.</p>
<p>I started a brand new Claude Code session (clearing the slate) to see if that was something Claude could figure out too:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This repo is deployed using GitHub Pages. I want to modify the build slightly - before deploying to GitHub Pages it should run python gather_links.py which will generate a file called gathered_links.json - then it should run python build_colophon.py which will use that file to create colophon.html - I want both gathered_links.json and colophon.html to be published to GitHub pages but I do not want them checked into the repo itself</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unlike the first time, this time I watched what it was doing very closely - I don't know how to customize GitHub Pages builds in this way and I wanted to both learn how to do it and stay cautious that it might hallucinate details and fail at the task.</p>
<p>It told me it wanted to create this file and asked for my permission:</p>

<p>I guess that's right? I appreciated that comment about "Need full history for git log in gather_links.py" - that's something I could easily have missed.</p>
<p>Then it said it wanted to add those files to <code>.gitignore</code> - sounds like a good idea.</p>
<p>It spat out this summary of its actions so far:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've created a GitHub Actions workflow for GitHub Pages that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Creates a .github/workflows/pages.yml file that:
<ul>
<li>Runs on pushes to main branch</li>
<li>Checkouts the full git history (needed for gather_links.py)</li>
<li>Sets up Python 3.12</li>
<li>Runs both scripts in sequence to generate the files</li>
<li>Builds and deploys to GitHub Pages</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Created .gitignore file to prevent the generated files from being committed</li>
</ol>
<p>Now when you push to main, GitHub Actions will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run the gather_links.py script to create gathered_links.json</li>
<li>Run build_colophon.py to create colophon.html</li>
<li>Deploy both files (and all other files) to GitHub Pages</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I checked to see how much it had cost:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; /cost 
  ‚éø  Total cost: $0.1788
     Total duration (API): 44.6s
     Total duration (wall): 10m 18.6s
</code></pre>
<p>So 17 cents and 45 seconds using the Claude API. (I got distracted, hence the 10m of total time.) Here's the <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/a560b07eef577e6183021d1ccaae7e07">full transcript</a>.</p>
<p>The code didn't look like it would irreversibly break anything, so I pushed it to GitHub to see what would happen.</p>
<p>... and it worked! My new <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon">colophon page</a> was live.</p>
<p>There's a catch. I watched the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/actions">GitHub Actions</a> interface while it was running and something didn't look right:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/github-actions-colophon.jpg" alt="GitHub Actions interface showing three completed actions. Test for Custom pages workflow for colophon,2 Deploy for that same name and another one called pages-build-deployment." style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<p>I was expecting that "Test" job, but why were there two separate deploys?</p>
<p>I had a hunch that the previous, default Jekyll deploy was still running, while the new deploy ran at the same time - and it was pure luck of the timing that the new script finished later and over-wrote the result of the original.</p>
<p>It was time to ditch the LLMs and read some documentation!</p>
<p>I found this page on <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/using-custom-workflows-with-github-pages">Using custom workflows with GitHub Pages</a> but it didn't tell me what I needed to know.</p>
<p>On another hunch I checked the GitHub Pages settings interface for my repo and found this option:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/github-pages-settings.jpg" alt="GitHub Pages UI - shows your site is live at tools.simonwillison.net, deployed 7 minutes ago. - then under Buyld and deployment a source menu shows options for GitHub Actions or for Deploy from a branch (selected)" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<p>My repo was set to "Deploy from a branch", so I switched that over to "GitHub Actions".</p>
<p>I manually updated my <code>README.md</code> to add a link to the new Colophon page in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/commit/4ee15aaad8e9a412505210a30f485528cb3c0390">this commit</a>, which triggered another build.</p>
<p>This time only two jobs ran, and the end result was the correctly deployed site:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/github-actions-colophon-2.jpg" alt="Only two in-progress workflows now, one is the Test one and the other is the Deploy to GitHub Pages one." style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<p>(I later spotted another bug - some of the links inadvertently included <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> tags in their <code>href=</code>, which I <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/commit/87e2577983f11fc9c7bf7b7a268cf2404a21e1c5">fixed</a> with another <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/d5ccbca1b530868980609222790a97cb">11 cent Claude Code session</a>.)</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: I improved the colophon further by <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/13/tools-colophon/">adding AI-generated descriptions of the tools</a>.</p>
<h4 id="be-ready-for-the-human-to-take-over">Be ready for the human to take over</h4>
<p>I got lucky with this example because it helped illustrate my final point: expect to need to take over.</p>
<p>LLMs are no replacement for human intuition and experience. I've spent enough time with GitHub Actions that I know what kind of things to look for, and in this case it was faster for me to step in and finish the project rather than keep on trying to get there with prompts.</p>
<h4 id="the-biggest-advantage-is-speed-of-development">The biggest advantage is speed of development</h4>
<p>My new <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon">colophon page</a> took me just under half an hour from conception to finished, deployed feature.</p>
<p>I'm certain it would have taken me significantly longer without LLM assistance - to the point that I probably wouldn't have bothered to build it at all.</p>
<p><em>This</em> is why I care so much about the productivity boost I get from LLMs so much: it's not about getting work done faster, it's about being able to ship projects that I wouldn't have been able to justify spending time on at all.</p>
<p>I wrote about this in March 2023: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Mar/27/ai-enhanced-development/">AI-enhanced development makes me more ambitious with my projects</a>. Two years later that effect shows no sign of wearing off.</p>
<p>It's also a great way to accelerate learning new things - today that was how to customize my GitHub Pages builds using Actions, which is something I'll certainly use again in the future.</p>
<p>The fact that LLMs let me execute my ideas faster means I can implement more of them, which means I can learn even more.</p>
<h4 id="llms-amplify-existing-expertise">LLMs amplify existing expertise</h4>
<p>Could anyone else have done this project in the same way? Probably not! My prompting here leaned on 25+ years of professional coding experience, including my previous explorations of GitHub Actions, GitHub Pages, GitHub itself and the LLM tools I put into play.</p>
<p>I also <em>knew</em> that this was going to work. I've spent enough time working with these tools that I was confident that assembling a new HTML page with information pulled from my Git history was entirely within the capabilities of a good LLM.</p>
<p>My prompts reflected that - there was nothing particularly novel here, so I dictated the design, tested the results as it was working and occasionally nudged it to fix a bug.</p>
<p>If I was trying to build a Linux kernel driver - a field I know virtually nothing about - my process would be entirely different.</p>
<h4 id="bonus-answering-questions-about-codebases">Bonus: answering questions about codebases</h4>
<p>If the idea of using LLMs to write code for you still feels deeply unappealing, there's another use-case for them which you may find more compelling.</p>
<p>Good LLMs are <em>great</em> at answering questions about code.</p>
<p>This is also very low stakes: the worst that can happen is they might get something wrong, which may take you a tiny bit longer to figure out. It's still likely to save you time compared to digging through thousands of lines of code entirely by yourself.</p>
<p>The trick here is to dump the code into a long context model and start asking questions. My current favorite for this is the catchily titled <code>gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05</code>, a preview of Google's Gemini 2.0 Pro which is currently free to use via their API.</p>
<p>I used this trick just <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/6/monolith/">the other day</a>. I was trying out a new-to-me tool called <a href="https://github.com/Y2Z/monolith">monolith</a>, a CLI tool written in Rust which downloads a web page and all of its dependent assets (CSS, images etc) and bundles them together into a single archived file.</p>
<p>I was curious as to how it worked, so I cloned it into my temporary directory and ran these commands:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre><span class="pl-c1">cd</span> /tmp
git clone https://github.com/Y2Z/monolith
<span class="pl-c1">cd</span> monolith

files-to-prompt <span class="pl-c1">.</span> -c <span class="pl-k">|</span> llm -m gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05 \
  -s <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>architectural overview as markdown<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span></pre></div>
<p>I'm using my own <a href="https://github.com/simonw/files-to-prompt">files-to-prompt</a> tool (built for me by Claude 3 Opus <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Apr/8/files-to-prompt/">last year</a>) here to gather the contents of all of the files in the repo into a single stream. Then I pipe that into my <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a> tool and tell it (via the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-gemini">llm-gemini</a> plugin) to prompt Gemini 2.0 Pro with a system prompt of "architectural overview as markdown".</p>
<p>This gave me back a <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/2c80749935ae3339d6f7175dc7cf325b">detailed document</a> describing how the tool works - which source files do what and, crucially, which Rust crates it was using. I learned that it used <code>reqwest</code>, <code>html5ever</code>, <code>markup5ever_rcdom</code> and <code>cssparser</code> and that it doesn't evaluate JavaScript at all, an important limitation.</p>
<p>I use this trick several times a week. It's a great way to start diving into a new codebase - and often the alternative isn't spending more time on this, it's failing to satisfy my curiosity at all.</p>
<p>I included three more examples in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/14/files-to-prompt/">this recent post</a>.</p>

## LLVM Fortran Levels Up: Goodbye flang-new, Hello flang!

date: 2025-03-11, from: LLVM Blog

<p>LLVM has included a Fortran compiler &ldquo;Flang&rdquo; since LLVM 11 in late 2020. However,until recently the Flang binary was not <code>flang</code> (like <code>clang</code>) but instead<code>flang-new</code>.</p><p>LLVM 20 ends the era of <code>flang-new</code>. The community has decided that Flang isworthy of a new name.</p><p>The &ldquo;new&rdquo; name? You guessed it, <code>flang</code>.</p><p>A simple change that represents a major milestone for Flang.</p><p>This article will cover the almost 10 year journey of Flang. The firstconcepts, multiple rewrites, the adoption of LLVM&rsquo;s Multi Level IntermediateRepresentation (MLIR) and Flang entering the LLVM Project.</p><p>If you want to try <code>flang</code> right now, you can<a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/tag/llvmorg-20.1.0">download</a>it or try it in your browser using<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/3hhYM37Kh">Compiler Explorer</a>.</p><h1 id="why-fortran">Why Fortran?</h1><p>Fortran was first created in the 1950s, and the name came from &ldquo;Formula Translation&rdquo;.Fortran focused on the mathematics use case and freed programmers from writingassembly code that could only run on specific machines.</p><p>Instead they could write code that looked like a formula. You expect this todaybut for the time it was a revolution. This feature led to heavy use in scientificcomputing: weather modelling, fluid dynamics and computational chemistry, justto name a few.</p><blockquote><p>Whilst many alternative programming languages have comeand gone, it [Fortran] has regained its popularity for writing highperformance codes. Indeed, over 80% of the applicationsrunning on ARCHER2, a 750,000 core Cray EX which isthe UK national supercomputer, are written in Fortran.</p></blockquote><ul><li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.13274">Fortran High-Level Synthesis: Reducing the barriersto accelerating High Performance Computing (HPC) codes on FPGAs</a> (Gabriel Rodriguez-Canal et al., 2023)</li></ul><p>Fortran has had a <a href="https://ondrejcertik.com/blog/2021/03/resurrecting-fortran/">resurgence</a>in recent years, gaining a <a href="https://fpm.fortran-lang.org/">package manager</a>, an unofficial<a href="https://github.com/fortran-lang/stdlib">standard library</a> and <a href="https://lfortran.org/">LFortran</a>,a compiler that supports interactive programming (LFortran also uses LLVM).</p><p>For the full history of Fortran, IBM has an excellent <a href="https://www.ibm.com/history/fortran">article</a>on the topic and I encourage you to look at the<a href="https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/Fortran/102653987.05.01.acc.pdf">&ldquo;Programmer&rsquo;s Primer for Fortran&rdquo;</a>if you want to see the early form of Fortran.</p><p>If you want to learn the language, <a href="https://fortran-lang.org/">fortran-lang.org</a>is a great place to start.</p><h1 id="why-would-you-make-another-fortran-compiler">Why Would You Make Another Fortran Compiler?</h1><p>There are many Fortran compilers. Some are vendor specific such as the<a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/fortran-compiler.html">Intel Fortran Compiler</a>or NVIDIA&rsquo;s <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/hpc-compilers">HPC compilers</a>. Thenthere are open source options like <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/fortran/">GFortran</a>, whichsupports many platforms.</p><p>Why build one more?</p><p>The two partners in the early days of Flang were the US National Labs and NVIDIA.</p><p>For Pat McCormick (Flang project lead at Los Alamos National Laboratory) preservingthe utility of Fortran code was imperative:</p><blockquote><p>These [Fortran] codes represent an essential capability that supports manyelements of our [The United States&rsquo;] scientific mission and will continue to doso for the foreseeable future. A fundamental risk facing these codes is theabsence of a long-term, non-proprietary support path for Fortran.</p></blockquote><p>GFortran might seem to counter that statement, but remember that a single projectis a single point of failures, incompatibilities and disagreements. Having multipleimplementations reduces that risk.</p><p>NVIDIA&rsquo;s Gary Klimowicz <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy68k5hHgLk">laid out</a>their goals for Flang in a presentation to FortranCon in 2020:</p><ul><li>Use a permissive license like that of <a href="https://llvm.org/LICENSE.txt">LLVM</a>,which is more palatable to commercial users and contributors.</li><li>Develop an active community of Fortran compiler developers that includescompanies and institutions.</li><li>Support Fortran tool development by basing Flang on existing LLVM frameworks.</li><li>Support Fortran language experimentation for future language standards proposals.</li></ul><p>Intentions echoed by Pat McCormick:</p><blockquote><p>The overarching goal was to establish an open-source, modern implementation andsimultaneously grow a community that spanned industry, academia, and federalagencies at both the national and international levels.</p></blockquote><p>Fortran as a language also benefits from having many implementations. For C++language features, it is common to implement them on top of Clang and GCC, toprove the feature is viable and get feedback.</p><p>Implementing the feature multiple times in different compilers uncoversassumptions that may be a problem for certain compilers, or certain groups ofcompiler users.</p><p>In the same way, Flang and GFortran can provide that diversity.</p><p>However, even when features are standardised, standards can be ambiguous andimplementations do make mistakes. A new compiler is a chance to uncover these.</p><p>Jeff Hammond (NVIDIA) is very familiar with this, having tested Flang with manyexisting applications. They had this to say on the motivations for Flangand how users have reacted to it:</p><blockquote><p>The Fortran language has changed quite a bit over the past 30 years. Modern Fortrandeserves a modern compiler ecosystem, that&rsquo;s not only capable of compiling allthe old codes and all the code written for the current standard, but also supportsinnovation in the future.</p><p>Because it&rsquo;s a huge amount of work to build a feature-complete modern Fortran compiler,it&rsquo;s useful to leverage the resources of the entire LLVM community for this effort.NVIDIA and ARM play leading roles right now, with important contributions from IBM,Fujitsu and LBNL [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory], e.g. related to testsuites and coarrays. We hope to see the developer community grow in the future.</p><p>Another benefit from the LLVM Fortran compiler is that users are more likely toinvest in supporting a new compiler when it has full language support and runs onall the platforms. A broad developer base is critical to support all the platforms.</p><p>What I have seen so far interacting with our Fortran users is that they are veryexcited about LLVM Flang and were willing to commit to supporting it in theirbuild systems and CI systems, which has driven quality improvements in both theFlang compiler and the applications.</p><p>Like Clang did with C and C++ codes when it started to become popular, Flangis helping to identify bugs in Fortran code that weren&rsquo;t noticed before, whichis making the Fortran software ecosystem better.</p></blockquote><h1 id="pgi-to-llvm-the-flang-timeline">PGI to LLVM: The Flang Timeline</h1><p>The story of Flang really starts in 2015, but the Portland Group (PGI) collaboratedwith US National Labs prior to this.

It was always contentious, so for the final<a href="https://discourse.llvm.org/t/proposal-rename-flang-new-to-flang/69462">proposal</a>Brad Richardson decided to use the <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-www/blob/main/proposals/LP0001-LLVMDecisionMaking.md">LLVM proposal process</a>.Rarely used, but specifically designed for these situations.</p><blockquote><p>After several rounds of back and forth, I thought the discussion wasdevolving and there wasn&rsquo;t much chance we&rsquo;d come to a consensus without someoutside perspective.</p></blockquote><ul><li>Brad Richardson</li></ul><p>That outside perspective included Chris Lattner (co-founder of the LLVM Project),who quickly<a href="https://discourse.llvm.org/t/proposal-rename-flang-new-to-flang/69462/25">identified</a>a unique problem:</p><blockquote><p>We have a bit of an unprecedented situation where an LLVM project is takingthe name of an already established compiler [Classic Flang]. Everyone seems towant the older flang [Classic Flang] to fade away, but flang-new is not asmature and it isn‚Äôt clear when and what the criteria should be for that.</p></blockquote><p>Confusion about the <code>flang</code> name was a key motivation for Brad Richardson too:</p><blockquote><p>Part of my concern was that the name &ldquo;flang-new&rdquo; would get common usagebefore we were able to change it. I think it&rsquo;s now been demonstrated that thatconcern was valid, because right now [November 2024] fpm [<a href="https://fpm.fortran-lang.org/">Fortran Package Manager</a>]recognizes the compiler by that name.</p><p>My main goal at that point was just clear goals for when we wouldmake the name change.</p></blockquote><p>No single list of goals was agreed, but some came up many times:</p><ul><li>Known limitations and supported features should be documented.</li><li>As much as possible, work that was expected to fix knownbugs should be completed, to prevent duplicate bug reports.</li><li>Unimplemented language features should fail with a message saying that they areunimplemented. Rather than with a confusing failure or by producing incorrectcode.</li><li>LLVM Flang should perform relatively well when compared to other Fortrancompilers.</li><li>LLVM Flang must have a reasonable pass rate with a large Fortran language testsuite, and results of that must be shown publicly.</li><li>All reasonable steps should be taken to prevent anyone using a pre-packagedClassic Flang confusing it with LLVM Flang.</li></ul><p>You will see a lot of relative language in those, like &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;. Noone could say exactly what that meant, but everyone agreed that it wasinevitable that one day it would all be true.</p><p>Paul T Robinson summarised the dilemma <a href="https://discourse.llvm.org/t/proposal-rename-flang-new-to-flang/69462/15">early</a>in the thread:</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>the plan is to replace Classic Flang with the new Flang in the future.</p></blockquote><p>I suppose one of the relevant questions here is: Has the future arrived?</p></blockquote><p>After that Steve Scalpone (NVIDIA) gave<a href="https://discourse.llvm.org/t/proposal-rename-flang-new-to-flang/69462/16">their perspective</a>that it was not yet time to change the name.</p><p>So the community got to work on those goals:</p><ul><li>Many performance and correctness issues were addressed by the &ldquo;High LevelFortran Intermediate Representation&rdquo; (HLFIR) (which this article will explain later).</li><li>A cross-company team including Arm, Huawei, Linaro, Nvidia and Qualcomm<a href="https://github.com/orgs/llvm/projects/35/views/1">collaborated</a>to make it possible to build the popular <a href="https://www.spec.org/cpu2017/">SPEC 2017</a>benchmark with Flang.</li><li>Flang gained support for OpenMP up to version 2.5, and was able to compile OpenMPspecific benchmarks like <a href="https://www.spec.org/omp2012/">SPEC OMP</a> and the<a href="https://www.nas.nasa.gov/software/npb.html">NAS Parallel Benchmarks</a>.</li><li>Linaro <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gua80XRPhyY">showed that</a> the performanceof Flang compared favourably with Classic Flang and was not far behind GFortran.</li><li>The GFortran test suite was added to the <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-test-suite/tree/main/Fortran/gfortran">LLVM Test Suite</a>,and Flang achieved good results.</li><li>Fujitsu&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/fujitsu/compiler-test-suite">test suite</a> was madepublic and tested with Flang. The process to make IBM&rsquo;s Fortran test suite publicwas started.</li></ul><p>With all that done, in October of 2024 <code>flang-new</code><a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/06eb10dadfaeaadc5d0d95d38bea4bfb5253e077">became</a><code>flang</code>.

Fortran IR and meant to be evocative of the trees(Abstract Syntax Trees).</p></blockquote><p>We will not go into detail about this early FIR, because <a href="https://mlir.llvm.org/">MLIR</a>was revealed soon after Eric started the project and they quickly adopted it.</p><blockquote><p>When MLIR was announced, I quickly switched gears from building datastructures for a new &ldquo;intermediate IR&rdquo; to porting my IR design to MLIR andusing that instead.</p><p>I believe FIR was probably the first &ldquo;serious project&rdquo; outside of Google tostart using MLIR.</p></blockquote><p>The FIR work continued to develop, with Jean Perier (NVIDIA) joining Eric onthe project. It became its own public branch <code>fir-dev</code>, which was later contributedto the LLVM Project.</p><p>The following sections will go into detail on the intermediate representationsthat Flang uses today.</p><h1 id="mlir">MLIR</h1><p>The journey from Classic Flang to LLVM Flang involved a rewrite of theentire compiler. This provided an opportunity to pick up new things fromthe LLVM Project. Most notably MLIR.</p><p>&ldquo;Multi-Level Intermediate Representation&rdquo; (MLIR) was first<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzljG6DKgic">introduced</a> to the LLVMcommunity in 2019, around the time that F18 was approved to move into the LLVM Project.</p><p>The problem that MLIR addresses is the same one that Eric Schweitz tackled with FIR:It is difficult to map high level details of programming languagesinto LLVM IR.</p><p>You either have to attach them to the IR as metadata, try to recover thelost details later, or fight an uphill battle to add the details toLLVM IR itself. These details are crucial for producing optimised code in certainlanguages. (Fortran array optimisations were one use case referenced).</p><p>This led languages such as Swift and Rust to create their own IRs that includeinformation relevant to their own optimisations. After that IR has been optimisedit is converted into LLVM IR and goes through the normal compilation pipeline.</p><p>To implement these IRs they have to build a lot of infrastructure, but it cannotbe shared between the compilers. This is where MLIR comes in.</p><blockquote><p>The MLIR project aims to directly tackle these programming language design andimplementation challenges‚Äîby making it very cheap to define and introduce newabstraction levels, and provide ‚Äúin the box‚Äù infrastructure to solve commoncompiler engineering problems.</p></blockquote><ul><li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.11054">&ldquo;MLIR: A Compiler Infrastructure for the End of Moore‚Äôs Law&rdquo;</a>(Chris Lattner, Mehdi Amini et al., 2020)</li></ul><h2 id="flang-and-mlir">Flang and MLIR</h2><p>The same year MLIR debuted, Eric Schweitz gave a talk at the later USLLVM Developers&rsquo; meeting titled<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff3ngdvUang">&ldquo;An MLIR Dialect for High-Level Optimization of Fortran‚Äù</a>.FIR by that point was implemented as an MLIR dialect.</p><blockquote><p>That [switching FIR to be based on MLIR] happened very quickly and I neverlooked back.</p><p>MLIR, even in its infancy, was clearly solving many of the exact same problemsthat we were facing building a new Fortran compiler.</p></blockquote><ul><li>Eric Schweitz</li></ul><p>The MLIR community were also happy to have Flang on board:</p><blockquote><p>It was fantastic to have very quickly in the early days of MLIR a non-ML [Machine Learning] frontendto exercise features we built in MLIR in anticipation. It led us to course-correctin some cases, and Flang was a motivating factor for many feature requests.It contributed significantly to establishing and validating that MLIR had the right foundations.</p></blockquote><ul><li>Mehdi Amini</li></ul><p>Flang did not stop there, later adding another dialect<a href="https://flang.llvm.org/docs/HighLevelFIR.html">&ldquo;High Level Fortran Intermediate Representation&rdquo;</a>(HLFIR) which works at a higher level than FIR. A big target of HLFIRwas array optimisations, that were more complex to handle using FIR alone.</p><blockquote><p>FIR was a compromise on both ends to some degree. It wasn&rsquo;t trying to capturesyntactic information from Fortran, and I assumed there would be work done onan Abstract Syntax Tree. That niche would later be filled by &ldquo;High Level FIR&rdquo;[HLFIR].</p></blockquote><ul><li>Eric Schweitz</li></ul><h2 id="irs-all-the-way-down">IRs All the Way Down</h2><p>The compilation process starts with Fortran source code.</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fortran" data-lang="fortran"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">subroutine</span> example(a, b)</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">real</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">::</span> a(:), b(:)</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> a <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> b</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">end</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">subroutine</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>(<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/8j3W46j3j">Compiler Explorer</a>)</p><p>The<a href="https://fortran-lang.org/learn/quickstart/organising_code/">subroutine</a> <code>example</code>assigns array <code>b</code> to array <code>a</code>.</p><p>It is tempting to think of the IRs in a &ldquo;stack&rdquo; where each one is convertedinto the next.

For instance, when you use the option <code>-march=armv8a+memtag</code>,something in Flang knows that you want to compile for Armv8.0-a with the MemoryTagging Extension enabled.</p><p><code>-march=</code> is an example of a &ldquo;compiler driver&rdquo; option. These options are what usersgive to the compiler. There is actually a second driver after this, confusinglycalled the &ldquo;frontend&rdquo; driver, despite being behind the scenes.</p><p>In Flang&rsquo;s case the &ldquo;compiler driver&rdquo; is <code>flang</code> and the &ldquo;frontend driver&rdquo; is<code>flang -fc1</code> (they are two separate tools, contained in the same binary).</p><p>They are separate tools so that the compiler driver can provide an interfacesuited to compiler users, with stable options that do not change over time.On the other hand, the frontend driver is suited to compiler developers, exposesinternal compiler details and does not have a stable set of options.</p><p>You can see the differences if you add <code>-###</code> to the compiler command:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>$ ./bin/flang /tmp/test.f90 -march=armv8a+memtag -### &#34;&lt;...&gt;/flang&#34; &#34;-fc1&#34; &#34;-triple&#34; &#34;aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu&#34; &#34;-target-feature&#34; &#34;+v8a&#34; &#34;-target-feature&#34; &#34;+mte&#34; &#34;/usr/bin/ld&#34; \ &#34;-o&#34; &#34;a.out&#34; &#34;-L/usr/lib/gcc/aarch64-linux-gnu/11&#34;</code></pre><p>(output edited for readability)</p><p>The compiler driver has split the compilation into a job for the frontend(<code>flang -fc1</code>) and the linker (<code>ld</code>). <code>-march=</code> has been converted into manyarguments to <code>flang -fc1</code>. This means that if compiler developers decided tochange how <code>-march=</code> was converted, existing <code>flang</code> commands would still work.</p><p>Another responsibility of the compiler driver is to know where to find librariesand header files. This differs between operating systems and evendistributions of the same family of operating systems (for example Linuxdistributions).</p><p>This created a problem when implementing the compiler driver for Flang. All thesedetails would take a long time to get right.</p><p>Luckily, by this time Flang was in the LLVM Project alongside Clang.Clang already knew how to handle this and had been tested on all sorts ofsystems over many years.</p><blockquote><p>The intent is to mirror clang, for both the driver and CompilerInvocation, asmuch as makes sense to do so. The aim is to avoid re-inventing the wheel andto enable people who have worked with either the clang or flang entry points,drivers, and frontends to easily understand the other.</p></blockquote><ul><li><a href="https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-adding-a-fortran-mode-to-the-clang-driver-for-flang/52307">Peter Waller</a> (Arm)</li></ul><p>Flang became the first in-tree project to use Clang&rsquo;s compiler driverlibrary (<code>clangDriver</code>) to implement its own compiler driver.</p><p>This meant that Flang was able to handle all the targets and tools that Clangcould, without duplicating large amounts of code.</p><h1 id="reflections-on-flang">Reflections on Flang</h1><p>We are almost 10 years from the first announcement of what would become LLVMFlang.

## llm-openrouter 0.4

date: 2025-03-10, updated: 2025-03-10, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-openrouter/releases/tag/0.4">llm-openrouter 0.4</a></strong></p>
I found out this morning that <a href="https://openrouter.ai/">OpenRouter</a> include support for a number of (rate-limited) <a href="https://openrouter.ai/models?max_price=0">free API models</a>.</p>
<p>I occasionally run workshops on top of LLMs (<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/8/cutting-edge-web-scraping/">like this one</a>) and being able to provide students with a quick way to obtain an API key against models where they don't have to setup billing is really valuable to me!</p>
<p>This inspired me to upgrade my existing <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-openrouter">llm-openrouter</a> plugin, and in doing so I closed out a bunch of open feature requests.</p>
<p>Consider this post the <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/annotated-release-notes/">annotated release notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>LLM <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/schemas.html">schema support</a> for OpenRouter models that <a href="https://openrouter.ai/models?order=newest&amp;supported_parameters=structured_outputs">support structured output</a>. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-openrouter/issues/23">#23</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm trying to get support for LLM's <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/28/llm-schemas/">new schema feature</a> into as many plugins as possible.</p>
<p>OpenRouter's OpenAI-compatible API includes support for the <code>response_format</code> <a href="https://openrouter.ai/docs/features/structured-outputs">structured content option</a>, but with an important caveat: it only works for some models, and if you try to use it on others it is silently ignored.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://github.com/OpenRouterTeam/openrouter-examples/issues/20">filed an issue</a> with OpenRouter requesting they include schema support in their machine-readable model index. For the moment LLM will let you specify schemas for unsupported models and will ignore them entirely, which isn't ideal.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><code>llm openrouter key</code> command displays information about your current API key. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-openrouter/issues/24">#24</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Useful for debugging and checking the details of your key's rate limit.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><code>llm -m ... -o online 1</code> enables <a href="https://openrouter.ai/docs/features/web-search">web search grounding</a> against any model, powered by <a href="https://exa.ai/">Exa</a>. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-openrouter/issues/25">#25</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>OpenRouter apparently make this feature available to every one of their supported models! They're using new-to-me <a href="https://exa.ai/">Exa</a> to power this feature, an AI-focused search engine startup who appear to have built their own index with their own crawlers (according to <a href="https://docs.exa.ai/reference/faqs#how-often-is-the-index-updated">their FAQ</a>). This feature is currently priced by OpenRouter at $4 per 1000 results, and since 5 results are returned for every prompt that's 2 cents per prompt.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><code>llm openrouter models</code> command for listing details of the OpenRouter models, including a <code>--json</code> option to get JSON and a <code>--free</code> option to filter for just the free models. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-openrouter/issues/26">#26</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This offers a neat way to list the available models. There are examples of the output <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-openrouter/issues/26#issuecomment-2711908704">in the comments on the issue</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New option to specify custom provider routing: <code>-o provider '{JSON here}'</code>. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-openrouter/issues/17">#17</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Part of OpenRouter's USP is that it can route prompts to different providers depending on factors like latency, cost or as a fallback if your first choice is unavailable - great for if you are using open weight models like Llama which are hosted by competing companies.</p>
<p>The options they provide for routing are <a href="https://openrouter.ai/docs/features/provider-routing">very thorough</a> - I had initially hoped to provide a set of CLI options that covered all of these bases, but I decided instead to reuse their JSON format and forward those options directly on to the model.

## Building Websites With Lots of Little HTML Pages

date: 2025-03-10, updated: 2025-03-10, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/lots-of-little-html-pages/">Building Websites With Lots of Little HTML Pages</a></strong></p>
Jim Nielsen coins a confusing new acronym - LLMS for (L)ots of (L)ittle ht(M)l page(S). He's using this to describe his latest site refresh which makes extensive use of <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/view-transitions/cross-document">cross-document view transitions</a> - a fabulous new progressive enhancement CSS technique that's <a href="https://caniuse.com/view-transitions">supported</a> in Chrome and Safari (and hopefully soon <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1823896">in Firefox</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With cross-document view transitions getting broader and broader support, I‚Äôm realizing that building in-page, progressively-enhanced interactions is more work than simply building two HTML pages and linking them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jim now has small static pages powering his home page filtering interface and even his navigation menu, with CSS view transitions configured to smoothly animate between the pages. I think it feels really good - here's what it looked like for me in Chrome (it looked the same both with and without JavaScript disabled):</p>
<p><img alt="Animated demo - clicking the tabs to swap between Latest, Trending and Hacker News Hits rearranges the list of posts in a smooth animation, then navigating to a post causes its title to enlarge and move to the top while the rest of the article loads in." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/llms-demo.gif" /></p>
<p>Watching the network panel in my browser, most of these pages are 17-20KB gzipped (~45KB after they've decompressed). No wonder it feels so snappy.</p>
<p>I poked around <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/styles.css">in Jim's CSS</a> and found this relevant code:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-css"><pre><span class="pl-k">@view-transition</span> {
  <span class="pl-c1">navigation</span><span class="pl-kos">:</span> auto;
}

.<span class="pl-c1">posts-nav</span> <span class="pl-ent">a</span>[<span class="pl-c1">aria-current</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span><span class="pl-s">"page"</span>]<span class="pl-kos">:</span><span class="pl-c1">not</span>(<span class="pl-kos">:</span><span class="pl-c1">last-child</span>)<span class="pl-kos">:</span><span class="pl-c1">after</span> {
  <span class="pl-c1">border-color</span><span class="pl-kos">:</span> <span class="pl-en">var</span>(<span class="pl-s1">--c-text</span>);
  <span class="pl-c1">view-transition-name</span><span class="pl-kos">:</span> posts-nav;
}

<span class="pl-c">/* Old stuff going out */</span>
::<span class="pl-c1">view-transition-old</span>(<span class="pl-ent">posts-nav</span>) {
  <span class="pl-c1">animation</span><span class="pl-kos">:</span> fade <span class="pl-c1">0.2<span class="pl-smi">s</span></span> linear forwards;
  <span class="pl-c">/* <a href="https://jakearchibald.com/2024/view-transitions-handling-aspect-ratio-changes/">https://jakearchibald.com/2024/view-transitions-handling-aspect-ratio-changes/</a> */</span>
  <span class="pl-c1">height</span><span class="pl-kos">:</span> <span class="pl-c1">100<span class="pl-smi">%</span></span>;
}

<span class="pl-c">/* New stuff coming in */</span>
::<span class="pl-c1">view-transition-new</span>(<span class="pl-ent">posts-nav</span>) {
  <span class="pl-c1">animation</span><span class="pl-kos">:</span> fade <span class="pl-c1">0.3<span class="pl-smi">s</span></span> linear reverse;
  <span class="pl-c1">height</span><span class="pl-kos">:</span> <span class="pl-c1">100<span class="pl-smi">%</span></span>;
}

<span class="pl-k">@keyframes</span> fade {
  <span class="pl-k">from</span> {
    <span class="pl-c1">opacity</span><span class="pl-kos">:</span> <span class="pl-c1">1</span>;
  }
  <span class="pl-k">to</span> {
    <span class="pl-c1">opacity</span><span class="pl-kos">:</span> <span class="pl-c1">0</span>;
  }
}</pre></div>

<p>Jim observes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This really feels like a game-changer for simple sites. If you can keep your site simple, it‚Äôs easier to build traditional, JavaScript-powered on-page interactions as small, linked HTML pages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've experimented with view transitions for <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a> in the past and the results were very promising. Maybe I'll pick that up again.</p>
<p>Bonus: Jim has a <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/csr4mw/building_websites_with_lots_little_html#c_ncxssq">clever JavaScript trick</a> to avoid clicks to the navigation menu being added to the browser's history in the default case.

Neat interactive visualization of Uber's <a href="https://h3geo.org/">H3</a> hexagonal geographical indexing mechanism.</p>

<p>Here's <a href="https://github.com/clupasq/h3-viewer">the source code</a>.</p>
<p>Why does H3 use hexagons? Because <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thOifuHs6eY">Hexagons are the Bestagons</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When hexagons come together, they form three-sided joints 120 degrees apart. This, for the least material, is the most mechanically stable arrangement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Only triangles, squares, and hexagons can tile a plane without gaps, and of those three shapes hexagons offer the best ratio of perimeter to area.
