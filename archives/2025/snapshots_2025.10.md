## Quoting Thane Ruthenis

<blockquote cite="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/oKAFFvaouKKEhbBPm/a-bear-case-my-predictions-regarding-ai-progress"><p>It seems to me that "vibe checks" for how smart a model feels are easily gameable by making it have a better personality.</p>
<p>My guess is that it's most of the reason Sonnet 3.5.1 was so beloved. Its personality was made much more <em>appealing</em>, compared to e. g. OpenAI's corporate drones. [...]</p>
<p>Deep Research was this for me, at first. Some of its summaries were just <em>pleasant</em> to read, they felt so information-dense and intelligent! Not like typical AI slop at all! But then it turned out most of it was just AI slop underneath anyway, and now my slop-recognition function has adjusted and the effect is gone.</p></blockquote>

## Building Websites With Lots of Little HTML Pages

date: 2025-03-10, updated: 2025-03-10, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/lots-of-little-html-pages/">Building Websites With Lots of Little HTML Pages</a></strong></p>
Jim Nielsen coins a confusing new acronym - LLMS for (L)ots of (L)ittle ht(M)l page(S). He's using this to describe his latest site refresh which makes extensive use of <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/view-transitions/cross-document">cross-document view transitions</a> - a fabulous new progressive enhancement CSS technique that's <a href="https://caniuse.com/view-transitions">supported</a> in Chrome and Safari (and hopefully soon <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1823896">in Firefox</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With cross-document view transitions getting broader and broader support, I’m realizing that building in-page, progressively-enhanced interactions is more work than simply building two HTML pages and linking them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jim now has small static pages powering his home page filtering interface and even his navigation menu, with CSS view transitions configured to smoothly animate between the pages. I think it feels really good - here's what it looked like for me in Chrome (it looked the same both with and without JavaScript disabled):</p>
<p><img alt="Animated demo - clicking the tabs to swap between Latest, Trending and Hacker News Hits rearranges the list of posts in a smooth animation, then navigating to a post causes its title to enlarge and move to the top while the rest of the article loads in." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/llms-demo.gif" /></p>
<p>Watching the network panel in my browser, most of these pages are 17-20KB gzipped (~45KB after they've decompressed). No wonder it feels so snappy.</p>
<p>I poked around <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/styles.css">in Jim's CSS</a> and found this relevant code:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-css"><pre><span class="pl-k">@view-transition</span> {
  <span class="pl-c1">navigation</span><span class="pl-kos">:</span> auto;
}

.<span class="pl-c1">posts-nav</span> <span class="pl-ent">a</span>[<span class="pl-c1">aria-current</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span><span class="pl-s">"page"</span>]<span class="pl-kos">:</span><span class="pl-c1">not</span>(<span class="pl-kos">:</span><span class="pl-c1">last-child</span>)<span class="pl-kos">:</span><span class="pl-c1">after</span> {
  <span class="pl-c1">border-color</span><span class="pl-kos">:</span> <span class="pl-en">var</span>(<span class="pl-s1">--c-text</span>);
  <span class="pl-c1">view-transition-name</span><span class="pl-kos">:</span> posts-nav;
}

<span class="pl-c">/* Old stuff going out */</span>
::<span class="pl-c1">view-transition-old</span>(<span class="pl-ent">posts-nav</span>) {
  <span class="pl-c1">animation</span><span class="pl-kos">:</span> fade <span class="pl-c1">0.2<span class="pl-smi">s</span></span> linear forwards;
  <span class="pl-c">/* <a href="https://jakearchibald.com/2024/view-transitions-handling-aspect-ratio-changes/">https://jakearchibald.com/2024/view-transitions-handling-aspect-ratio-changes/</a> */</span>
  <span class="pl-c1">height</span><span class="pl-kos">:</span> <span class="pl-c1">100<span class="pl-smi">%</span></span>;
}

<span class="pl-c">/* New stuff coming in */</span>
::<span class="pl-c1">view-transition-new</span>(<span class="pl-ent">posts-nav</span>) {
  <span class="pl-c1">animation</span><span class="pl-kos">:</span> fade <span class="pl-c1">0.3<span class="pl-smi">s</span></span> linear reverse;
  <span class="pl-c1">height</span><span class="pl-kos">:</span> <span class="pl-c1">100<span class="pl-smi">%</span></span>;
}

<span class="pl-k">@keyframes</span> fade {
  <span class="pl-k">from</span> {
    <span class="pl-c1">opacity</span><span class="pl-kos">:</span> <span class="pl-c1">1</span>;
  }
  <span class="pl-k">to</span> {
    <span class="pl-c1">opacity</span><span class="pl-kos">:</span> <span class="pl-c1">0</span>;
  }
}</pre></div>

<p>Jim observes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This really feels like a game-changer for simple sites. If you can keep your site simple, it’s easier to build traditional, JavaScript-powered on-page interactions as small, linked HTML pages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've experimented with view transitions for <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a> in the past and the results were very promising. Maybe I'll pick that up again.</p>
<p>Bonus: Jim has a <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/csr4mw/building_websites_with_lots_little_html#c_ncxssq">clever JavaScript trick</a> to avoid clicks to the navigation menu being added to the browser's history in the default case.

<p>When hexagons come together, they form three-sided joints 120 degrees apart. This, for the least material, is the most mechanically stable arrangement.</p>

<p>Only triangles, squares, and hexagons can tile a plane without gaps, and of those three shapes hexagons offer the best ratio of perimeter to area.
