<p>While the Taliban hope for a “new chapter” in relations with the
United States under Donald Trump, analysts say that will depend on
whether Afghan leaders uphold their promises. Roshan Noorzai has the
story, narrated by Bezhan Hamdard. Camera: Afghan Service.</p>

id="l.a.-fires-have-scorched-largest-urban-area-in-california-in-at-least-40-years">L.A.
fires have scorched largest urban area in California in at least 40
years</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Two wildfires still burning in Los Angeles have torched more urban
area than any other fire in the state since at least the mid-1980s, an
Associated Press analysis shows.</p>
<p>The Eaton and Palisades fires that erupted last week have
collectively burned almost 4 square miles of highly dense parts of Los
Angeles, more than double the urban acreage consumed by the region’s
Woolsey fire in 2018, according to the AP’s analysis of data from the
Silvis Lab at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.</p>
<p>Experts say several factors could lead to wildfires reaching cities
more often. Urban areas continue to sprawl into wildland. Climate change
is raising global temperatures that lead to more severe weather,
including droughts, especially in the western United States.</p>
<p>“If these conditions get worse or more frequent in the future, it
wouldn’t be surprising, in my opinion, if there were more events that
threaten densely populated places,” said Franz Schug, a researcher
studying the boundaries between the wildland and urban areas at the
University of Wisconsin-Madison.</p>
<p>The Eaton and Palisades fires’ rampage through Los Angeles has killed
at least 27 people, destroyed more than 12,000 structures and put more
than 80,000 under evacuation orders. The fires are likely to be among
the most destructive in California history, according to the state
agency CalFire.</p>
<p>The Woolsey fire eventually grew to about twice the current size of
the Eaton and Palisades fires but most of the area it burned was
uninhabited.</p>
<p>Silvis, and AP, defined urban areas as those that are “high density,”
where the land has at least three housing units for every acre,
calculated with U.S. Census data.</p>
<p>The Great Chicago Fire of 1871 burned about 3.3 square miles of the
downtown area of the city, according to the Chicago Architecture Center.
San Francisco’s Great Fire of 1906 destroyed 4 square miles of the city,
according to the Museum of the City of San Francisco.</p>
<p>Besides burning the most urban area, the Eaton and Palisades fires
are the largest ever for California in January. Alexandra Syphard, a
senior research scientist at the Conservation Biology Institute, said
their timing and path through the city “may have no precedent in
history.”</p>
<p>Authorities haven’t determined a cause for the major blazes in
California. But experts have noted the extreme weather that created more
favorable conditions: heavy rains that drove vegetation growth, then
extreme drought that turned much of that vegetation into good fire fuel.
Scientists say such extreme weather events are a hallmark of climate
change.</p>
<p>Then there’s the human element.</p>
<p>Across California, about 1.4 million homes were built in areas where
residential areas and vegetation intermingle between 1990 and 2020, a
40% increase, the Silvis Lab found.</p>
<p>Fires that begin close to populated areas are often caused by people,
and their proximity to people means that they are usually extinguished
sooner. As David Helmers, a data scientist and geographer at the Silvis
Lab, put it, “Humans tend to ignite fires, but they also fight
fires.”</p>
<p>But that wasn’t the case with the Eaton and Palisades fires, which
were whipped by fierce Santa Ana winds to overwhelm fire crews.</p>
<p>The 2017 Tubbs fire in northern California’s wine country came under
similar high winds. That blaze, sparked by a residential electrical
system, tore through suburban areas of Santa Rosa, killing 22 people and
destroying more than 5,600 homes, businesses and other structures.
Overnight, the rubble of the Coffey Park neighborhood became a symbol
for how quickly a wildfire can reach a populated area.</p>
<p>Some 53 years prior, another fire — the Hanly fire — burned through
almost the exact same area. Winds helped it spread with furious speed.
But with little development at the time, nobody died and only 100 homes
were lost.</p>

id="biden-says-equal-rights-amendment-should-be-considered-ratified">Biden
says Equal Rights Amendment should be considered ratified</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden announced Friday that the Equal
Rights Amendment should be considered a ratified addition to the U.S.
Constitution, making a symbolic statement that’s unlikely to alter a
decadeslong push for gender equality.</p>
<p>“The Equal Rights Amendment is the law of the land,” Biden said, even
though presidents have no role in the constitutional process. He did not
direct the leader of the National Archives to certify the amendment, as
some activists have called for, sidestepping a legal battle.</p>
<p>It was the latest in a collection of pronouncements that Biden has
made in the waning days of his presidency as he tries to tie up loose
ends and embroider his legacy despite leaving after only one term. He’s
also called for a ban on stock trading for members of Congress and
proposed term limits for Supreme Court justices — ideas that lingered
for years before Biden endorsed them.</p>
<p>With his popularity low and political influence running dry before
he’s replaced by Donald Trump on Monday, Biden’s statements have stirred
aggravation among some allies who believe he should have acted more
swiftly and spoken out earlier.</p>
<p>The Equal Rights Amendment, which would ban discrimination based on
gender, was sent to the states for ratification in 1972. Virginia became
the 38th state to ratify it in 2000, although years past the deadline
set by Congress, leading to a legal standoff over whether it could be
considered valid.</p>
<p>Democrats and activists have long pressed to consider the amendment
as ratified, but Biden did not say he agreed until Friday.</p>
<p>“I wish it was done sooner because it’s so important,” said Christian
F. Nunes, leader of the National Organization for Women. “The fact that
it’s getting done now is more important than the fact that it took long,
but we can’t continue to delay women’s protections and equal rights in
this country.”</p>
<p>Noreen Farrell, executive director of Equal Rights Advocates, said
she wished Biden’s statement had come earlier in hopes of influencing
the leader of the National Archives, who has declined to certify the
amendment because of the expired deadline for ratification.</p>
<p>“But we remain hopeful” that it would help build momentum “even at
this late date,” Farrell said.</p>
<p>Biden defended his decision not to weigh in until the end of his term
by telling reporters that he “needed all the facts.”</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, Biden issued a statement saying that “it is long
past time to recognize the will of the American people.”</p>
<p>“In keeping with my oath and duty to Constitution and country, I
affirm what I believe and what three-fourths of the states have
ratified: the 28th Amendment is the law of the land, guaranteeing all
Americans equal rights and protections under the law regardless of their
sex.”</p>
<p>It’s unlikely that Biden’s support will have any impact. On Friday,
the National Archives reiterated its position by saying “the underlying
legal and procedural issues have not changed.”</p>

Pacific Gas &amp; Electric is one of the oldest and largest utilities in
the United States. It’s also one of the most notorious.
</p>
<p>
The company serving Northern California was driven into bankruptcy after
being found liable for the deadly 2018 Camp Fire, which destroyed the
town of Paradise, California. After restructuring and emerging in 2020,
it was again found liable for the
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/26/us/pacific-gas-electric-settlement-dixie-fire-california/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>2021
Dixie Fire</u></a>. Needless to say, PG&amp;E has since gotten the
message that it needs to better fortify its equipment and surrounding
environment. So while utilities aren’t generally renowned for their
enthusiastic adoption of novel technologies, PG&amp;E has been going all
in on startups that can help prevent future disasters.
</p>
<p>
“More than half of our northern and central California service areas are
within high fire threat areas, and a third of our assets are located in
those areas,” PG&amp;E spokesperson Paul Doherty told me. While
PG&amp;E’s service area doesn’t overlap with the L.A. fires, the growing
list of gridtech and climate tech companies that it’s partnered with
could serve as an example for other utilities in the state and country
as a whole. In PG&amp;E’s catalogue are

platforms</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
In some ways, the 120-year-old utility is starting to act like a tech
incubator. It hosted its first-ever innovation summit in 2023, where
Doherty said it held a <em><em>Shark Tank</em></em>-style pitch fest to
source ideas for a variety of grid challenges, including
wildfire-related ones like system monitoring and vegetation management,
ultimately receiving over 600 applications. Out of that, PG&amp;E

24 concepts</u></a> to move forward with in some form.
</p>
<p>
“My experience has been that they’re very focused on reducing risk,”
Dave Winnacker, co-founder of the AI-powered risk visualization and
mitigation platform XyloPlan, told me. “That attention is probably
focused by the fact that they were held accountable and they had
significant monetary losses, reputational losses.”
</p>
<p>
Last year, XyloPlan partnered with PG&amp;E to pilot its software in the
wildfire-prone Lake County, California. The platform provides insight
into the areas most at risk from fast-moving fires, which Winnacker told
me are much more damaging to communities and critical infrastructure
than hot fires, known to be more destructive in forests. “So in our
model and our future state, you can still have plenty of fire on the
landscape, and you can even have plenty of fast-moving fire, but we have
prioritized treatments that would disrupt those fast-moving fires that
have the greatest consequences,” Winnacker, the former fire chief of the
Moraga-Orinda Fire District, told me. XyloPlan’s algorithm makes
recommendations on where various resiliency efforts such as vegetation
management would have the greatest impact.
</p>
<p>
Winnacker acknowledges though that for utilities, “it’s really difficult
and risky to take something new on.” Not only could money be wasted if
it doesn’t work out, but as Winnacker told me, “It can be perceived as
an admission of your doing things wrong before. The tendency to assign
blame makes it harder to adopt new and innovative things.”
</p>
<p>
“I think the toughest thing for a utility is to trust a technology,”
Christina Park, senior director of energy strategy at the autonomous
drone company Skydio, told me. A former veteran of the utility industry
herself, Park spent 15 years at the New York Power Authority and
understands why utilities would be reluctant to tweak at least formerly
reliable services and infrastructure that millions of households depend
upon. But as climate change brings drought and more extreme weather, and
as utility infrastructure ages, evolution seems like the only option.
“Based on all the confluence of factors that are kind of putting their
backs against the wall, they are more open to change,” Park told me.
“It’s just not possible to keep doing things the old way.”
</p>
<p>
Skydio, which was last
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/27/skydio-soars-to-a-2-2-billion-valuation-after-raising-230m-series-e/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>valued
at $2.2 billion</u></a> after its 2023 Series E funding round, operates
in three main markets — defense, public safety, and utilities. PG&amp;E
has been a customer of the company since 2022, and became the first
California utility to conduct fully remote drone inspections of its
assets in 2023. This was made possible after the utility secured a
much-coveted waiver from the Federal Aviation Administration that allows
it to fly drones beyond the visual line of sight.
</p>
<p>
“An operator could fly a drone to a location that’s up over a mountain,
right up over super steep, rugged terrain that would normally be really
hard to access via helicopter, via foot, via vehicle, and now we have
the capability to go inspect that,” Doherty told me. Six navigation
cameras as well as onboard artificial intelligence and advanced
computing allow Skydio drones to operate autonomously, docked and
deployed at PG&amp;E substations.
</p>
<p>
Park told me that PG&amp;E, which has had a drone program since 2019,
has used its aviation expertise to help Skydio develop key capabilities.
“They have the knowledge in the drone space to really ask for more
advanced features — being able to pick out when there is a zoom quality
that they would really like to see or a certain lens.” After Skydio’s
drones gather reams of visual data, algorithms can pinpoint the location
and severity of any infrastructural defects. PG&amp;E has developed its
own A.I. model in house to do this.
</p>
<p>
PG&amp;E is far from alone in its excitement over Skydio’s capabilities.
The dronemaker has over 200 utility partnerships to date, and Park told
me that across all of them she’s seeing more and more integration of new
tech into the standard workflow. “Their business as usual, it just looks
different than it did five years ago,” she told me. But while there
might be an increased appetite in the industry for novel solutions,
Winnacker warns that there are numerous logistical and financial
barriers that can get in the way of promising tech moving from pilot to
full-scale implementation.
</p>
<p>
“The challenge on these things always is that the benefit is very
widespread, but there has to be someone who is the lead, and ultimately
someone has to make the investment,” Winnacker told me. “That’s
challenging, because there is a federal component, there’s a state
component, there’s a local government component, there’s a
non-government, land-owning agency component, and then there’s a small
private property component. We have to mesh all of these.”
</p>
<p>
Sometimes, good companies with good ideas can languish as these various
stakeholders with different perspectives and priorities wait for someone
else to step up and foot the bill. As of now, Winnacker said he doesn’t
know if PG&amp;E is going to make a more significant investment in
XyloPlan, although he said last year’s partnership proved fruitful.
</p>
<p>
But if PG&amp;E does move forward with XyloPlan, or any other gridtech
or wildfire mitigation tech for that matter, the success of that program
will depend not just on the utility, but also on all the other
governmental and non-governmental players that Winnacker mentioned.
“There’s a need for really tight alignment, so that the work of one
group compliments the other, and we don’t end up in this disjointed
manner, where a lot of effort is occurring, but because it’s not
coordinated, it’s not aligned, you don’t get that the reinforcing
benefit of the network,” Winnacker told me.
</p>
<p>
Not to mention the fact that in rural and urban areas alike, there’s
always competing demands and only so much money to go around. Especially
in a state like California, which is facing a severe housing crisis, the
perpetual question of prioritization looms over every budget decision.
And while tech companies often promise to save utilities money in the
long term — via both efficiency gains and avoided disaster costs —
implementing new programs often means big upfront expenses, which
typically leads to higher customer rates. And, well, everybody hates
that.
</p>
<p>
Suffice it to say, there’s no perfect solution here, but inaction is the
worst option of all. As Winnacker put it, “you eat an elephant one bite
at a time.” So as Los Angeles recovers from some of the most destructive
fires in the state’s history and utilities across the state open
themselves up to new ways of doing business, “we need to start with
these small bites to get moving so that we can get past the either
<em><em>nothing can be done, this is an act of nature</em></em>
discussion or this pie in the sky, <em><em>oh, you know, a single tech
silver bullet will just make this problem go away,” </em></em>Winnacker
told me.
</p>
<p>
“This is an all of the above approach, and the time is probably now,
with regard to having everyone’s undivided attention on this for a very
brief period of time.”

<h2 id="crews-improve-containment-of-la-fires">Crews improve containment
of LA fires</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Firefighters have contained more of the Palisades and
Eaton fires in Southern California, the state’s Department of Forestry
and Fire Protection said Friday morning.</p>
<p>For the time being, the strongest winds have calmed, but the National
Weather Service said dangerous conditions are expected again next week.
The strongest winds are expected Tuesday night.</p>
<p>The Palisades fire, which has burned through nearly 10,000 hectares,
is now 31% contained, according to the forestry department. That fire
broke out more than a week ago on the western edge of Los Angeles.</p>
<p>The second-biggest fire, the Eaton fire, is now 65% contained,
according to the forestry department. It has burned through more than
5,600 hectares.</p>
<p>Those two fires have killed at least 27 people and destroyed more
than 12,300 structures. The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department said
Thursday that 18 people remained missing after the fires.</p>
<p>A smaller third fire, known as the Auto fire, is 85% contained and
has burned through 24 hectares, according to the forestry
department.</p>
<p>With calmer winds, some residents have been allowed back into
neighborhoods affected by the Eaton and Palisades fires.</p>
<p>About 82,000 people remained under mandatory evacuation orders and
90,000 others were under evacuation warnings. Curfews were still in
effect for the Palisades and Eaton fire zones from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.</p>

id="us-fortifying-indo-pacific-air-bases-against-potential-attacks-from-china">US
fortifying Indo-Pacific air bases against potential attacks from
China</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The United States has been ramping up its Indo-Pacific
region air bases to ensure they are protected against attack, a
spokesperson for the U.S. Pacific Air Forces told VOA this week, amid
concerns over vulnerabilities they face in countries such as Japan, the
Philippines and South Korea against potential Chinese strikes.</p>
<p>“While we are continually improving our theater posture, warfighting
advantage and integration with allied and partners, Pacific Air Forces
stands ready every day to respond to anything that poses a threat to a
free and open Indo-Pacific,” the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>“We continue to invest in infrastructure and technology to enhance
the resilience and survivability of our bases and facilities across the
theater, including hardening airfields and buildings while investing in
advanced security systems to protect our personnel and assets,” the
spokesperson told VOA on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Air Force was authorized with “$916.6 million to improve
logistics, maintenance capabilities and prepositioning of equipment,
munitions, fuel and material in the Indo-Pacific” through the fiscal
2024 Pacific Deterrence Initiative, the spokesperson added. The Pacific
Deterrence Initiative is a set of defense priorities set up in 2021 by
Congress to support U.S. goals in the Indo-Pacific, primarily to counter
China.</p>
<p>The comments were made in response to a report last week by the
Hudson Institute claiming that U.S. aircraft at allied Indo-Pacific
country bases could suffer major losses from Chinese attacks unless
those bases are fortified.</p>
<p>If left unfortified, the U.S. air power in the region would be
significantly reduced compared to China’s, according to the report,
Concrete Sky: Air Based Hardening in the Western Pacific.</p>
<p>One of the reasons, according to the report, is that the U.S. is
lagging behind China in the number of shelters that could hide and
protect the aircraft from attacks.</p>
<p>China more than doubled the number of aircraft shelters since the
early 2010s, having more than 3,000, according to the report. Across 134
Chinese air bases located within 1,000 nautical miles of the Taiwan
Strait, China has more than 650 hardened aircraft shelters and nearly
2,000 nonhardened individual aircraft shelters.</p>
<p>A hardened shelter is a reinforced structure made of steel, concrete,
and other materials to protect military aircraft from enemy strikes.</p>
<p>In comparison, the U.S. has added two hardened shelters and 41
nonhardened ones within 1,000 nautical miles of the Taiwan Strait and
outside South Korea since the 2010s, the report said.</p>
<p>This means if a war breaks out over Taiwan, U.S. aircraft could
suffer more damage than China’s if they attacked each other’s bases in
the region, which would prevent U.S. air operation for a duration of
time, said analysts.</p>
<p>According to Kelly Grieco, a senior fellow at the Stimson Center’s
Reimagining U.S. Grand Strategy Program, attacks on U.S. bases in the
Pacific region, including Japan could “prevent the U.S. Air Force from
conducting fighter operations for about the first 12 days of a conflict
from U.S. bases in Japan.”</p>
<p>Grieco continued, based on her own report published by the Stimson
Center, that Chinese missiles could also take out runways and aerial
refueling tankers, rendering them unusable for over a month at U.S.
bases in Japan and for over half a week at U.S. military bases in Guam
and other Pacific locations.</p>
<p>“It’s not possible to harden a runway or taxiway” that is exposed as
an easy target to destroy, disabling aircraft from taking off, she said.
This begs the question of whether it is worth investing in hardening
facilities, she added.</p>
<p>The Hudson Institute report says within the 1,000 nautical miles of
Taiwan, China has added 20 runways and 49 taxiways since the 2010s while
the U.S. added one runway and one taxiway.</p>
<p>Unhardened airfields</p>
<p>Among U.S. air bases in the allied countries of Japan, the
Philippines and South Korea, those in the Philippines are the least
protected, Timothy Walton, one of the authors of the Hudson report, told
VOA.</p>
<p>“In Japan, Kadena and Misawa Air Bases are the most fortified U.S.
bases, while the remainder are largely unfortified,” said Walton, a
senior fellow at Hudson’s Center for Defense Concepts and
Technology.</p>
<p>“In the Republic of Korea, the two U.S. Air Force bases, Osan and
Kunsan, are hardened. Airfields in the Philippines are unhardened,” he
said.</p>
<p>Grieco said the U.S. would mostly rely on its bases in Japan, Guam
and other Pacific locations as South Korea would “restrict the use of
U.S. bases in its territory in a Taiwan contingency out of concern about
North Korean aggression and to avoid a rupture with Beijing.”</p>
<p>U.S. Representative John Moolenaar, the chair of the House Select
Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, Senator Marco Rubio,
President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for secretary of state, and 13 other
lawmakers underlined last year the importance of hardened shelters to
protect against Chinese attacks.</p>
<p>In a letter sent to Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall and Navy
Secretary Carlos Del Toro in May, they said, “U.S. bases in the region
have almost no hardened aircraft shelters compared to Chinese military
bases,” leading to U.S. air assets being “highly vulnerable to Chinese
strikes.”</p>
<p>Aside from hardened shelters, analysts pointed to dispersing
airfields as important.</p>
<p>Steven Rudder, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council
and former commanding general of U.S. Marine Corps Forces, Pacific,
said, “When you look at the number of aircraft in the Asia Pacific, I am
not sure that the ability to harden every single aircraft parking space
would be as effective as a distributed force.”</p>
<p>Bruce Bennett, a senior defense researcher at Rand Corporation, said
dispersing airfields are important against nuclear strikes.</p>
<p>Against conventional warhead missiles, shelters are “key to the
protection,” said Bennett. “But if there’s a nuclear threat, you’ve got
to have different airfields” as alternative locations to park and land
aircraft and to provide logistic support such as fueling, maintenance
and repair, he said.</p>
<p>Bennett added the disparity in the number of aircraft shelters
between the China and U.S. seems to stem from U.S. air superiority.</p>
<p>“What the U.S. Air Force tends to perceive is that we’ve got the
ability to deal with the Chinese air force in an air-to-air combat,”
where China traditionally felt it would lose air-to-air combat against
the U.S. and therefore wants to take U.S. aircraft on the ground before
engaging in air while sheltering theirs heavily on the ground, Bennett
said.</p>
<p>“The question becomes, as the Chinese aircraft get better and as they
start fielding fifth-generation fighter, will the U.S. need the ability
to attack Chinese airfields with conventional weapons? I don’t think the
Defense Department has considered it as one of important tasks,” Bennett
said.</p>

id="trumps-swearing-in-ceremony-to-be-moved-indoors-due-to-cold-weather">Trump’s
swearing-in ceremony to be moved indoors due to cold weather</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump is moving his swearing-in
ceremony inside the U.S. Capitol on Monday because of expected freezing
cold temperatures.</p>
<p>On Inauguration Day, temperatures in the U.S. capital are expected to
hit a low of 11 degrees Fahrenheit (-11 degrees Celsius) and a high of
just 23 degrees Fahrenheit (-5 degrees Celsius), and it is expected to
feel even colder with the wind chill. The frigid temperatures mean
Trump’s inauguration is expected to be the coldest in 40 years,
according to meteorologists.</p>
<p>“It is my obligation to protect the People of our Country but, before
we even begin, we have to think of the Inauguration itself. The weather
forecast for Washington, D.C., with the windchill factor, could take
temperatures into severe record lows. There is an Arctic blast sweeping
the Country. I don’t want to see people hurt, or injured, in any way,”
Trump said in a post on social media platform Truth Social.</p>
<p>President Ronald Reagan’s second inauguration in 1985 was the last
time a swearing-in ceremony was moved indoors.</p>
<p>Trump said in his post that he has “ordered the Inauguration Address,
in addition to prayers and other speeches, to be delivered in the United
States Capitol Rotunda,” with dignitaries and guests brought into the
Capitol.</p>
<p>The president-elect said the Capital One Arena, located in another
part of Washington, will be opened Monday for live viewing of the
inauguration and to host the parade. He said he will join the crowd at
the indoor arena, after his swearing-in, which is set for 12 p.m. local
time.</p>
<p>U.S. Capitol Police said in a statement Friday that the ticketed
areas outside of the Capitol will be closed due to the extremely cold
weather that is expected.</p>
<p>Watch related video by Carolyn Presutti:</p>
<p>More than 250,000 guests are ticketed to view the inauguration from
around the Capital grounds and tens of thousands more were expected to
be in the general admission areas of the National Mall or to line the
parade route from the Capitol to the White House.</p>
<p>Officials say alternate plans are being devised to accommodate as
many guests as possible. The Capital One Arena holds some 20,000
people.</p>
<p>The Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies said in a
statement that the change means that the “vast majority” of ticketed
guests will no longer be able to attend in person.</p>
<p>“While we know this is difficult for many attendees, we strongly
suggest people who are in Washington for the event attend other indoor
events at indoor venues of their choice to watch the inauguration,” the
committee said.</p>
<p>Capitol Police said they, along with other law enforcement, will
still have a “heightened security posture with an increased law
enforcement presence and layers of physical security.”</p>
<p>The National Special Security Event DC Joint Information Center said
Friday in a statement, “The U.S. Secret Service and our federal, state,
and local partners are working in close coordination with the
Presidential Inaugural Committee and the Joint Congressional Committee
on Inaugural Ceremonies to adapt our security plans as needed due to the
expected inclement weather during Monday’s Presidential Inauguration in
Washington.”</p>
<p>The news that Trump’s inauguration is moving inside comes soon after
confirmation that China is sending Vice President Han Zheng to attend
the ceremony.</p>
<p>This will be the first time a senior Chinese leader is scheduled to
attend a U.S. president’s swearing-in.</p>

<li>Atmospheric CO2 levels are rising faster than ever
</h3>
<p>
Data from one of the longest-running and most reputable carbon dioxide
observatories in the world suggests that atmospheric levels of the
greenhouse gas increased at a record rate in 2024. The Mauna Loa
observatory in Hawaii has been tracking atmospheric CO2 since 1958, and
is “a good guide to rise in global average CO2 concentration,”

show that between 2023 and 2024, CO2 concentrations rose by about 3.6
parts per million, the largest annual increase on record, meaning that
not only are CO2 emissions still rising, but they’re rising faster than
ever. This growth is not compatible with any pathways to limiting global
temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius set out by the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change.

id="army-expects-to-meet-recruiting-goals-in-dramatic-turnaround-and-denies-wokeness-is-a-factor">Army
expects to meet recruiting goals, in dramatic turnaround, and denies
‘wokeness’ is a factor</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The Army expects to meet its enlistment goals for 2025, marking a
dramatic turnaround for a service that has struggled for several years
to bring in enough young people and has undergone a major overhaul of
its recruiting programs.</p>
<p>In an interview with The Associated Press, Army Secretary Christine
Wormuth said the Army is on pace to bring in 61,000 young people by the
end of the fiscal year in September and will have more than 20,000
additional young people signed up in the delayed entry program for 2026.
It’s the second straight year of meeting the goals.</p>
<p>“What’s really remarkable is the first quarter contracts that we have
signed are the highest rate in the last 10 years,” Wormuth said. “We are
going like gangbusters, which is terrific.”</p>
<p>Wormuth, who took over the Army four years ago as restrictions caused
by the COVID-19 pandemic were devastating recruitment across the
military, also flatly rejected suggestions that the Army is “woke.”</p>
<p>Critics have used the term to describe what they call an
over-emphasis on diversity and equity programs. Some Republicans have
blamed “wokeness” for the recruiting struggles, a claim repeated by
President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee for defense secretary, Pete
Hegseth, during his confirmation hearing this week.</p>
<p>Wormuth dismissed the claims.</p>
<p>“Concerns about the Army being, quote, woke, have not been a
significant issue in our recruiting crisis,” she said. “They weren’t at
the beginning of the crisis. They weren’t in the middle of the crisis.
They aren’t now. The data does not show that young Americans don’t want
to join the Army because they think the army is woke — however they
define that.”</p>
<p>Hegseth has vowed to remove “woke” programs and officers from the
military. And during his hearing Tuesday, he told senators that troops
will rejoice as the Trump administration takes office and makes those
changes.</p>
<p>“We’ve already seen it in recruiting numbers,” he said. “There’s
already been a surge since President Trump won the election.”</p>
<p>In fact, according to Army data, recruiting numbers have been
increasing steadily over the past year, with the highest total in August
2024 — before the November election. Army officials closely track
recruiting numbers.</p>
<p>Instead, a significant driver of the recruiting success was the
Army’s decision to launch the Future Soldier Prep Course, at Fort
Jackson, South Carolina, in August 2022. That program gives
lower-performing recruits up to 90 days of academic or fitness
instruction to help them meet military standards and move on to basic
training.</p>
<p>In the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, 2024, the Army met its
recruiting goal of 55,000 and began to rebuild its delayed entry pool.
About 24% of those recruits came out of the prep course. Wormuth said
she expects it will contribute about 30% of this year’s recruits.</p>
<p>The Army and the military more broadly have struggled with recruiting
for about a decade, as the unemployment rate shrank, and competition
grew from private companies able and willing to pay more and offer
similar or better benefits.</p>
<p>Just 23% of young adults are physically, mentally and morally
qualified to serve without receiving some type of waiver. Moral behavior
issues include drug use, gang ties or a criminal record. And the
coronavirus pandemic shut down enlistment stations and in-person
recruiting in schools and at public events that the military has long
relied upon.</p>
<p>Wormuth said a private survey along with more recent data show that
the key impediments to joining the military are concerns “about getting
killed or getting hurt, leaving their friends and family, and having a
perception that their careers will be on hold.”</p>
<p>That survey, done in 2022, found that “wokeness” was mentioned by
just 5% of respondents.</p>
<p>Wormuth acknowledged that the latest data show one element mentioned
by Hegseth — that the number of white men enlisting is a bit lower. She
said the persistent criticism about wokeness could be one reason.</p>
<p>“Any time an institution is being inaccurately criticized and
demeaned, it’s going to make it harder to recruit. And I think that is
what we have seen,” she said. “In terms of ‘is the Army woke’ — which I
will take to mean focused on things that don’t make us more lethal or
effective or better able to defend this nation — I would say the Army is
absolutely not woke.”</p>
<p>As an example, she said recruits get one hour of equal opportunity
instruction in basic training and 95 hours of marksmanship.</p>
<p>She also said there has been an increase in minority enlistment. The
service brought in the highest number ever of Hispanic recruits in 2024
and saw a 6% increase in Black recruiting.</p>
<p>In 2022, the Army fell 15,000 short of its enlistment goal of 60,000.
The following year, the service brought in a bit more than 50,000
recruits, widely missing its publicly stated “stretch goal” of
65,000.</p>
<p>The Navy and the Air Force all missed their recruitment targets in
2023, while the Marine Corps and the tiny Space Force have consistently
hit their goals.</p>
<p>Critics have also charged that the military has lowered standards
under President Joe Biden’s administration. Asked if that was true for
the Army, Wormuth said the service actually resolved not to do that to
meet its recruiting goals. Instead, she said, the prep course helps
recruits meet the standards.</p>
<p>Other changes that have helped the recruiting turnaround, she said,
include an overhaul of the system used to select recruiters, which now
chooses soldiers more suited to the task, as well as an increased use of
data analytics to improve marketing and ads.</p>
<p>The Army also increased the number of medical personnel being used to
help process routine waivers to move them more quickly through the
system. A consistent complaint across the military has been that it took
too long to get a waiver approved and that recruits were moving on to
other jobs as a result of the delays.</p>

sets record by commuting sentences of nearly 2,500 people convicted of
nonviolent drug charges</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — President Joe Biden announced Friday that he was
commuting the sentences of almost 2,500 people convicted of nonviolent
drug offenses, using his final days in office on a flurry of clemency
actions meant to nullify prison terms he deemed too harsh. </p>
<p>The recent round of clemency gives Biden the presidential record for
most individual pardons and commutations issued. The Democrat said he is
seeking to undo “disproportionately long sentences compared to the
sentences they would receive today under current law, policy, and
practice.” </p>
<p>“Today’s clemency action provides relief for individuals who received
lengthy sentences based on discredited distinctions between crack and
powder cocaine, as well as outdated sentencing enhancements for drug
crimes,” Biden said in a statement. “This action is an important step
toward righting historic wrongs, correcting sentencing disparities, and
providing deserving individuals the opportunity to return to their
families and communities after spending far too much time behind
bars.” </p>
<p>The White House did not immediately release the names of those
receiving commutations. </p>
<p>Still, Biden said more could yet be coming, promising to use the time
before President-elect Donald Trump is inaugurated Monday to “continue
to review additional commutations and pardons.” </p>
<p>Friday’s action follows Biden’s commutations last month of the
sentences of roughly 1,500 people who were released from prison and
placed on home confinement during the coronavirus pandemic, as well as
the pardoning of 39 Americans convicted of nonviolent crimes. That was
the largest single-day act of clemency in modern history. </p>
<p>All of this comes as Biden continues to weigh whether to issue
sweeping pardons for officials and allies who the White House fears
could be unjustly targeted by Trump’s administration. Though
presidential pardoning powers are absolute, such a preemptive move would
be a novel and risky use of the president’s extraordinary constitutional
power. </p>
<p>Last month, Biden also commuted the sentences of 37 of the 40 people
on federal death row, converting their punishments to life imprisonment
just weeks before Trump, an outspoken proponent of expanding capital
punishment, takes office. Trump has vowed to roll back that order after
his term begins. </p>
<p>Biden also recently pardoned his son Hunter, not just for his
convictions on federal gun and tax violations but for any potential
federal offense committed over an 11-year period, as the president
feared Trump allies would seek to prosecute his son for other
offenses. </p>
<p>If history is any guide, meanwhile, Biden also is likely to issue
more targeted pardons to help allies before leaving the White House, as
presidents typically do in some of their final actions. </p>
<p>Just before midnight on the final night of his first term, Trump, a
Republican, signed a flurry of pardons and commutations for more than
140 people, including his former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, rappers
Lil Wayne and Kodak Black and ex-members of Congress. </p>
<p>Trump’s final act as president in his first term was to announce a
pardon for Al Pirro, ex-husband of Fox News Channel host Jeanine Pirro,
one of his staunchest defenders. Al Pirro was convicted of conspiracy
and tax evasion charges and sentenced to more than two years in prison
in 2000.</p>

<h2 id="russia-upholds-jail-term-for-ex-us-consulate-worker">Russia
upholds jail term for ex-US Consulate worker</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MOSCOW — A Russian court on Friday upheld the jail term of Robert
Shonov, a former U.S. Consulate worker sentenced to almost five years
for “secret collaboration with a foreign state.”</p>
<p>Shonov, a Russian citizen, worked for more than 25 years at the U.S.
Consulate in the far eastern city of Vladivostok until 2021, when Moscow
imposed restrictions on local staff working for foreign missions.</p>
<p>He was arrested in 2023 on suspicion of passing secret information
about Russia’s military offensive against Ukraine to the United States
in exchange for money and sentenced to four years and 10 months prison
in November 2024.</p>
<p>“The judicial act was upheld,” a court in the Siberian city of
Novosibirsk ruled, according to its website, rejecting an appeal Shonov
had made against his sentencing.</p>
<p>The United States strongly condemned the conviction last year,
calling it an “egregious injustice” based on “meritless
allegations.”</p>
<p>In September 2023, Russia expelled two U.S. diplomats it accused of
acting as liaison agents for Shonov.</p>
<p>In recent years, several U.S. citizens have been arrested and
sentenced to long jail terms in Russia.</p>
<p>Others are being held pending trial.</p>
<p>Washington, which supports Ukraine militarily and financially against
Russia’s military offensive, accuses Moscow of arresting Americans on
baseless charges to use as bargaining chips in prisoner exchanges.</p>
<p>Even after a landmark prisoner swap in August, several U.S. nationals
and dual nationals remain in detention in Russia.</p>

<h2 id="chinese-vice-president-to-attend-trump-inauguration">Chinese
vice president to attend Trump inauguration</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>TAIPEI, TAIWAN — China said Friday that Vice President Han Zheng will
attend U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration Monday.</p>
<p>Beijing said the move follows “the principles of mutual respect,
peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation in viewing and growing its
relationship with the United States.”</p>
<p>“We stand ready to work with the new U.S. government to enhance
dialogue and communication, properly manage differences, expand mutually
beneficial cooperation, jointly pursue a stable, healthy and sustainable
China-U.S. relationship and find the right way for the two countries to
get along with each other,” a Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson said
in a Friday morning statement.</p>
<p>The announcement comes more than a month after Trump invited Chinese
President Xi Jinping and other foreign leaders to attend his
inauguration. It is an unprecedented move that marks a break from
tradition, since foreign ambassadors have historically attended
presidential inaugurations.</p>
<p>Analysts say Beijing is showing “goodwill” toward the new Trump
administration by sending Han.</p>
<p>“China has no established tradition of letting the president attend
other heads of state’s inauguration ceremonies,” said Zhou Bo, a senior
fellow at the Center for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua
University in Beijing.</p>
<p>“Sending the vice president to attend Trump’s inauguration ceremony
is the best option and it shows Beijing’s goodwill to President-elect
Trump,” he told VOA by phone.</p>
<p>While Beijing tries to respond positively to Trump’s invitation,
other experts say Han’s attendance will remain largely ceremonial.</p>
<p>“I don’t expect anything concrete out of Han’s trip to Washington,”
said Zhiqun Zhu, an expert on Chinese foreign policy at Bucknell
University in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Despite the ceremonial nature of Han’s attendance at the
inauguration, Zhu said Beijing’s move could still “lay a good
foundation” for U.S.-China relations under the second Trump
administration.</p>
<p>“Hopefully, a friendly atmosphere will be built and can be sustained
in the weeks and months ahead, so when the two sides sit down to discuss
substantive issues, maybe a deal could be struck,” he told VOA by
phone.</p>
<p>Trump’s return to the White House has created uncertainties for
China, which has faced a persistent economic downturn in recent
years.</p>
<p>During his presidential campaign, Trump vowed to impose tariffs up to
60% on Chinese products. Zhou said the possibility of high tariffs has
made Beijing cautious about the prospect of U.S.-China relations under
the second Trump administration.</p>
<p>“We don’t know how Trump will play his cards, so I believe China will
wait to see how his policies towards China play out,” he told VOA.</p>
<p>Despite threatening to impose tariffs on Chinese imports, Trump said
the two could have a good relationship and that he has been in contact
with the Chinese leaders through representatives.</p>
<p>“And I think we will probably get along very well, I predict,” he
said during an interview with conservative talk show host Hugh Hewitt on
Jan. 6, adding that the relationship has to be “a two-way street.”</p>
<p>Additionally, Trump wants to appoint several politicians known for
hawkish stances on China, including Sen. Marco Rubio as secretary of
state and Rep. Mike Waltz to be White House national security
adviser.</p>
<p>Rubio, during his Senate confirmation hearing Wednesday, described
China as “the most potent and dangerous near-peer adversary this nation
has ever confronted.”</p>
<p>“They have elements that the Soviet Union never possessed. They are a
technological adversary and competitor, an industrial competitor, an
economic competitor, a geopolitical competitor, a scientific
competitor,” he said.</p>
<p>Despite Rubio’s seemingly tough rhetoric on China during the hearing,
Zhu said it is too early to tell whether that language will translate
into actual policies toward China in the new administration.</p>
<p>“Some of the appointees by Trump seem hawkish on China but since they
work for Trump, I don’t think they will override Trump’s policies,” he
told VOA.</p>
<p>Zhu said since it remains unclear how Trump will shape his policies
toward China, Washington and Beijing will “move ahead cautiously.</p>
<p>“Both sides had a terrible experience during Trump’s first term so it
looks like they want to start afresh this time,” he said.</p>

<h2 id="inaugural-balls-protests-planned-in-washington">Inaugural balls,
protests planned in Washington</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Washington has been bracing for lots of things this
week, including several more days of frigid temperatures and hordes of
people and police for the presidential inauguration and related protests
around the city next week.</p>
<p>Officials said this week that they expected about 250,000 ticketed
people to descend on the U.S. capital as Donald Trump takes the oath of
office as president again. He last served from 2017 to 2021.</p>
<p>Fewer visitors are expected for next Monday’s ceremony than were
present at Trump’s first inauguration, local and federal officials said
at a press conference. In 2017, they prepared for more than 1 million
people.</p>
<p>Temperatures are expected to be particularly low in Washington on
Monday. The temperature at noon, when Trump will be sworn in, is
predicted to be in the low 20s F, which is about 20 degrees below
normal.</p>
<p>Enhanced security</p>
<p>Even though a lower turnout is expected this time around, recent acts
of violence — like the New Year’s Day attack in New Orleans — mean there
will be an enhanced security presence, the officials said.</p>
<p>On Inauguration Day, 25,000 law enforcement and military personnel
will be in the District of Columbia to provide security, including the
full activation of D.C. police, 7,800 National Guard troops and about
4,000 officers from around the country, according to William McCool, the
special agent in charge of the Secret Service’s Washington Field
Office.</p>
<p>Leading up to the inauguration, Washington will be home to both
celebratory events and protests.</p>
<p>A Trump victory rally is planned for Sunday afternoon at Capital One
Arena, where the Village People, an American band, will perform.</p>
<p>The arena has 20,000 seats, Monumental Sports &amp; Entertainment,
the company that operates the arena, told a D.C. news station.</p>
<p>The company said in a statement to News4 that the arena has been
offered to every administration, “irrespective of party,” for
decades.</p>
<p>“We are happy that President Trump has accepted our offer, and we
will welcome him and his guests to Capital One Arena on January 19,” the
statement said.</p>
<p>While there will be three official inaugural balls, more than a dozen
unofficial inaugural balls are scheduled throughout the weekend in
Washington.</p>
<p>However, protests are scheduled, too.</p>
<p>On Saturday, a demonstration called the People’s March is expected to
draw tens of thousands of people to downtown Washington. The
demonstration is organized by various civil rights, racial justice and
reproductive health groups.</p>
<p>“As Trump assumes the presidency in January, we are gathering to
mobilize our collective power and stand against his efforts to roll back
our rights and freedoms,” Analilia Mejia, co-executive director of the
Center for Popular Democracy, said in a statement.</p>
<p>On Monday, the Answer Coalition’s National Day of Action will feature
a rally and march, according to media reports.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Accustomed to crowds</p>
<p>Washington officials said they’re used to managing crowds and
protests.</p>
<p>“Here in the city, we allow peaceful protests all the time,” D.C.
Police Chief Pamela Smith said at a press conference this week. “But
when it comes to violating the law, we’re just not going to tolerate
it.”</p>
<p>On Monday night, after the inauguration, Trump is expected to shuttle
among the three official inaugural balls.</p>
<p>But inauguration celebrations won’t be limited to Washington.</p>
<p>For instance, in Florida, where Trump resides at his Mar-a-Lago
resort, the pro-Trump Villages M.A.G.A. Club is hosting an inaugural
party on Monday evening, about 60 miles northwest of Orlando. The
celebration has already sold out, according to an Eventbrite listing
advertising the party.</p>

id="siberian-air-to-make-trump-swearing-in-coldest-in-40-years">Siberian
air to make Trump swearing-in coldest in 40 years</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The vast majority of Americans are about to get an extended taste of
frigid Siberian weather. Another polar vortex disruption will stretch
Arctic air across the top of the globe and make Donald Trump’s second
inauguration the coldest in 40 years, meteorologists said.</p>
<p>After starting in the Rockies Thursday night, the cold will blast
eastward and as far south as the upper Florida peninsula over several
days. Up to 280 million Americans will have a day or two where it’s
colder than Anchorage, Alaska, said private meteorologist Ryan Maue.</p>
<p>“This would be one of the coldest outbreaks certainly of the past 10
years, 15 years,” said winter weather expert Judah Cohen of Atmospheric
Environmental Research. “It’s pulling air out of Siberia. And, you know,
that’s consistent with these stretches, because when the polar vortex
stretches, the flow starts in Siberia and ends in the United
States.”</p>
<p>It will arrive in Washington well before Trump’s inauguration Monday
outside the U.S. Capitol. The National Weather Service is predicting the
temperature to be around minus 6 degrees Celsius at noon during the
swearing-in, the coldest since Ronald Reagan’s second inauguration saw
temperatures plunge to minus 14 Celsius. The temperature for Barack
Obama’s 2009 swearing-in was minus 2 Celsius.</p>
<p>But that’s not all - the wind is forecast to be 48 to 56 kilometers
per hour.</p>
<p>“The wind chills would be in the single digits for sure,” the NWS’s
Weather Prediction Center meteorologist Zack Taylor said. “That’s going
to be cold, blustery, basically right up the National Mall. And it can
get pretty breezy on the mall there with the west-northwest wind right
in the face.”</p>
<p>Washington could see single digits later; Wednesday morning might get
near zero, Maue said. There could be a record low in Baltimore, Taylor
said. He said most of the records that will be broken in this cold
outbreak are not likely to be overnight lows, but still chilly daytime
highs.</p>
<p>About 80 million people are likely to have subzero temperatures at
some point, Maue said.</p>
<p>“The coldest will be Tuesday morning for the Lower 48 overall,” Maue
said. The average low that morning for the entire Lower 48 will be
around minus 14 degrees Celsius, he said.</p>
<p>Maue said a stretch from Chicago to Indianapolis to Columbus, Ohio,
to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, will get the most brutal cold compared with
their normal temperatures.</p>
<p>“That’s like a corridor of extreme cold, calm winds at night over
snow cover. Temperatures could really drop like a rock there,” Maue
said.</p>
<p>Freezes could go as far as the Gulf Coast and northern Florida,
meteorologists said.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, long-range forecasts hinted at worst-in-30-years
type of cold for the year’s first week, but those predictions eased as
the cold outbreak got closer. It was cold, but not near record levels.
This time, it’s the opposite. Each day’s computer models show it colder
than the previous one, Maue said.</p>
<p>There’s some possibility of snow squalls here and there, but it’s
mostly just going to be cold, Taylor said — what Maue called a dry
cold.</p>
<p>As happened earlier this month, this cold snap comes from a
disruption in the polar vortex, the ring of cold air usually trapped
about the North Pole. That ring is being stretched south across North
America like a rubber band, Cohen said.</p>
<p>These stretching events are happening more often in the past decade
or so, Cohen said. He and others have linked these polar vortex
outbreaks to human-caused climate change and decreasing pressure and
temperature differences between the Arctic and the rest of the
globe.</p>
<p>Those also trigger changes in the jet stream — the river of air that
usually brings weather from west to east — that make cold air and
weather systems plunge from north to south like a roller coaster.</p>
<p>On the east side of that plunge is cold air and potentially record
high pressure, Taylor and others said.</p>
<p>On the west side, in Southern California, is not only warmer air but
also the extreme pressure differences that could goose the already high
winds that are fanning fires around Los Angeles, meteorologists
said.</p>
<p>Get used to it. There’s some debate among meteorologists about how
long this extreme cold outbreak will last but below-normal temperatures
may stick around through the end of the month for much of the country,
said University of Oklahoma meteorology professor Jason Furtado, who
organized winter weather workshops at the American Meteorological
Society’s annual conference in New Orleans.</p>
<p>And Cohen said long-range forecasts suggest the same polar vortex
conditions could return in early February.</p>

id="trump-team-might-step-in-to-save-tiktok-from-pending-us-ban">Trump
team might step in to save TikTok from pending US ban</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>With a pending law declaring the social media application TikTok
illegal in the United States, set to take effect on Sunday, the incoming
administration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is signaling that it
plans to try to find a way to prevent the service from going
offline.</p>
<p>Under current law, the service’s parent company, China-based
ByteDance, must either sell TikTok to a non-Chinese firm or see it
banned in the U.S.</p>
<p>Representative Mike Waltz, who has been tapped to serve as Trump’s
national security adviser, told Fox News on Thursday that the
president-elect has options available to postpone enforcement of the law
while a possible deal is worked out to sell the company. That includes a
section of the law allowing the president to give ByteDance a 90-day
extension to finalize a sale.</p>
<p>“We will put measures in place to keep TikTok from going dark,” Waltz
said, “as long as a viable deal is on the table. Essentially that buys
President Trump time to keep TikTok going.”</p>
<p>Executive action reportedly considered</p>
<p>Also on Wednesday, several media outlets reported that Trump is
considering issuing an executive order that would protect TikTok.</p>
<p>The legality of such a move is unclear and is thrown further into
doubt by the fact that the Supreme Court is poised to rule on a request
by the company to overturn the law.</p>
<p>The high court heard arguments in the case last week and is expected
to rule shortly. The outcome is not certain. However, in oral arguments,
a majority of the justices appeared to favor upholding the law.</p>
<p>Trump’s attitude toward TikTok has evolved considerably over the
years. During his first term in office, he attempted to shut the service
down in the U.S. Since then, though, he has used the service, with
considerable success, to connect with his supporters.</p>
<p>In a press conference in Florida last month, Trump said, “I have a
warm spot in my heart for TikTok,” and credited the app with helping him
get his message out to younger American voters.</p>
<p>Trump has denied that his change of heart about TikTok was influenced
by a brief meeting in March with Republican megadonor and ByteDance
investor Jeff Yass. Lobbying disclosure reports from 2024 show that
ByteDance paid a former Trump campaign aide to lobby lawmakers in
Washington in favor of TikTok, and that former senior Trump aide
Kellyanne Conway has been paid to advocate for TikTok in Congress via
the Yass-funded conservative group Club for Growth.</p>
<p>Trump also said TikTok was not mentioned during his meeting with
Yass.</p>
<p>Economic concerns</p>
<p>In the years since TikTok took off, thousands of U.S.-based content
creators have developed large audiences on the app, and in many cases
have been able to monetize their TikTok feeds.</p>
<p>Many small businesses have found success advertising their products
to TikTok users. Other TikTok personalities have parlayed fame on the
app into broader celebrity that has led to lucrative product
endorsements and other deals.</p>
<p>Some members of Congress have expressed concern that abruptly
shutting the app down could have economic consequences.</p>
<p>On Monday, Democratic Senator Edward Markey introduced legislation
that would delay the TikTok ban by 270 days.</p>
<p>“Let me be clear: TikTok has its problems,” Markey said in a
statement released by his office. “Like every social media platform,
TikTok poses a serious risk to the privacy and mental health of our
young people. I will continue to hold TikTok accountable for such
behavior. But a TikTok ban would impose serious consequences on millions
of Americans who depend on the app for social connections and their
economic livelihood. We cannot allow that to happen.”</p>
<p>Viability of sale unclear</p>
<p>As the Sunday deadline nears, there have been a number of rumors
about a possible sale of the company. Bloomberg reported on Wednesday
that Chinese officials were considering the possibility of selling the
service to billionaire Elon Musk, a close Trump adviser who already owns
the social media service X, formerly Twitter.</p>
<p>Another U.S. billionaire, real estate developer Frank McCourt, told
Reuters on Thursday that a consortium of investors he had formed has
already made a formal offer to purchase TikTok, valuing the service at
$20 billion.</p>
<p>However, it is far from clear that a sale is something the Chinese
government is prepared to allow. Any sale worth the buyer’s investment
would have to include the “recommendation engine,” TikTok’s name for the
algorithm that makes the service so popular and, many would say,
addictive.</p>
<p>Last year in a court filing, TikTok characterized such a deal as
unavailable.</p>
<p>“Just as the United States restricts the export of U.S.-origin
technologies (e.g., certain computer chips), the Chinese government
regulates the transfer of technologies developed in China,” the company
argued in a court filing. “The Chinese government has made clear in
public statements that it would not permit a forced divestment of the
recommendation engine.”</p>
<p>Privacy, national security worries</p>
<p>A wildly popular service for sharing short videos, TikTok has an
estimated 170 million U.S. users. Federal officials have been concerned
about TikTok for years because it collects vast amounts of information
about its user base. They have argued that Chinese laws compelling
domestic companies to cooperate with intelligence agencies could be used
to force the company to share that data with the Chinese Communist
Party.</p>
<p>U.S. officials have expressed concern that China could misuse the
private information about U.S. users of the service. They have also
warned that Beijing could use TikTok’s powerful recommendation algorithm
to shape public discourse in the U.S. to the benefit of China.</p>
<p>In December, when a federal appeals court upheld the law mandating
the company’s sale or shutdown, Democratic Representative Raja
Krishnamoorthi, one of the original sponsors of the law, released a
statement expressing the thoughts of many of the law’s supporters.</p>
<p>“With today’s opinion, all three branches of government have reached
the same conclusion: ByteDance is controlled by the Chinese Communist
Party, and TikTok’s ownership by ByteDance is a national security threat
that cannot be mitigated through any other means than divestiture,”
Krishnamoorthi said.</p>
<p>“Every day that TikTok remains under the Chinese Communist Party’s
control is a day that our security is at risk,” Krishnamoorthi
added.</p>

<h2 id="us-sanctions-sudan-army-leader-citing-atrocities">US sanctions
Sudan army leader, citing atrocities</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Washington has slapped sanctions on Sudan’s army leader,
citing his responsibility for war crimes in a conflict that has bled the
oil-rich country dry over the last year — sparking a famine, killing
tens of thousands of people and driving millions from their homes — just
a week after the U.S. sanctioned his opponent for acts it described as
genocide.</p>
<p>Thursday’s sanctions on Sudanese Armed Forces leader Abdel Fattah
al-Burhan and a Hong-Kong-based weapons supplier block them from
entering or transiting the United States and restrict their access to
any U.S. assets.</p>
<p>This leaves both sides economically restrained in this brutal
conflict that the State Department has described as the world’s worst
humanitarian crisis, but where Washington’s options are limited because
of its strained diplomatic ties to the large African nation. This
conflict also has drawn in outside players, with Egypt and the United
Arab Emirates arming the rivals.</p>
<p>During his final press conference on Thursday, Secretary of State
Antony Blinken accused the SAF of war crimes. In last week’s sanctions,
the State Department accused the opposing Rapid Support Forces of
genocide.</p>
<p>“The SAF has also committed war crimes, and it continues to target
civilians,” Blinken said. “It’s obstructed the advancement of the peace
process. It’s refused to participate on numerous occasions in ceasefire
talks that we’ve sought to convene, and together with the RSF, it’s
caused what is the world’s worst humanitarian crisis that people are
suffering through every day. And we believe strongly, as we said,
there’s no military solution to this conflict.”</p>
<p>‘Flawed’ action, Sudan says</p>
<p>Sudan’s government expressed its objection to the sanctions, calling
them “flawed,” “unethical” and “dubious.”</p>
<p>“This decision lacks the basic principles of justice and objectivity,
relying on implausible pretexts,” read its statement, which was posted
on social media platform X. “It also reflects a blatant disregard for
the Sudanese people, who stand firmly united behind General Abdel Fattah
al-Burhan as a symbol of their sovereignty and armed forces, and as a
courageous leader in the battle for dignity against the terrorist
Janjaweed militias.”</p>
<p>Blinken did not address U.S. media reports citing anonymous U.S.
officials that the SAF has used chemical weapons at least twice. VOA’s
query to the National Security Council went unanswered Thursday.</p>
<p>When asked by reporters whether both sides were equally responsible,
Blinken replied, “The actions we took on the RSF, as you know, found a
determination of genocide. The actions that we’re looking at for the SAF
go to war crimes. So there are gradations in these things, and we follow
the law.”</p>
<p>And Blinken expressed regrets that this conflict has escalated. It
has followed many of the same contours as the Darfur conflict at the
turn of the century.</p>
<p>“It is, for me, yes, another real regret that when it comes to Sudan,
we haven’t been able on our watch to get to that day of success,” he
said.</p>
<p>He added, “We’ll keep working it for the next three days, and I hope
the next administration will take that on as well.”</p>
<p>Hemedti sanctioned</p>
<p>Last week’s sanctions targeted RSF leader Mohammad Hamdan Daglo, whom
the White House named as the leader of a wave of renewed ethnic
cleansing, rape and systematic atrocities.</p>
<p>Daglo, who is better known by his nickname, Hemedti, was a commander
in the Janjaweed militia considered largely responsible for the brutal
Darfur conflict, in which Sudanese Arab Janjaweed militias used
scorched-earth tactics on the Fur, Masalit and Zaghawa people of Western
Sudan, killing at least 200,000. The scale and savagery of the violence
prompted the International Criminal Court to issue its first-ever
warrant for genocide to Sudan’s then-president, Omar al-Bashir.</p>
<p>Hemedti led the RSF as a paramilitary unit until the April 2023 clash
with government forces that sparked the current conflict.</p>
<p>The violence has plunged nearly 640,000 people into the misery of
famine, the State Department said. And the United Nations estimates that
30 million people — more than half of the nation’s population — need
humanitarian assistance.</p>
<p>Daniel Volman, director of the African Security Research Project,
told VOA it’s “unlikely” that the incoming Trump administration will
impose further sanctions. He said the U.S. and its allies bear some
responsibility for “the conflict escalating to genocidal heights.”</p>
<p>“I think that the United States, under both Democratic and Republican
administrations, bears a major responsibility for failing to take
effective action against the Bashir regime [which created the RSF and
carried out the first genocide in Darfur] and for failing to take
effective action to support the civil society groups fighting for a
democratic government, which led to the current civil war,” he said by
email. “The United States is not alone in bearing responsibility.
Russia, Iran and other countries are also arming the rival forces and
prolonging the conflict.”</p>
<p>Complicating factor</p>
<p>And, Volman said, the Biden administration’s decision to sanction
some of Hemedti’s foreign backers by targeting companies based in the
United Arab Emirates is also a complicating factor.</p>
<p>“The involvement of Egypt and the UAE in arming the rival forces and
prolonging the civil war will complicate the Trump administration’s
relations with these two key allies and may lead them to expand and
escalate their military intervention in Sudan,” he said.</p>
<p>Andrew Payne, a lecturer in foreign policy and security at City,
University of London, told VOA that for now, sanctions are the main tool
that Washington has to constrain Khartoum.</p>
<p>“Sanctions are an easy tool that make it appear like an
administration is doing something, regardless of whether that is an
appropriate tool to use. It’s relatively cost-free to the United States.
If the alternative is something that requires political will, then that
will has to be there. … Sanctions are always the tool of cheapest
resort, in a sense. So, it’s a way of seeming like you’re engaged,
seeming like you’re active, without considering more tougher measures,”
Payne said.</p>

Little Revelations from Doug Burgum’s Confirmation Hearing</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-16, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTYyMzgwOS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc5NzcyNjE0Mn0.HYdE1DyLRScONtdoTxyDJ_qy2lTyl5_NDDcGuLalAec/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Doug Burgum is, by all accounts, a normie. Compared to
<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2025/01/16/donald-trump-cabinet-government-dysfunction-concerns/76741545007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>some
of the other picks</u></a> for incoming President Trump’s cabinet, the
former North Dakota governor is well respected by his political
colleagues; even many of the Democrats on the Energy and Natural
Resources Committee seemed chummy with the former software executive
during his hearing on Thursday, praising his support of the outdoor
recreation economy and his conservation efforts in his state. As if to
confirm the low stakes of the hearing, Burgum used his closing remarks
not as a final pitch of his qualifications — but to invite his
interrogators to a Fourth of July party at the Theodore Roosevelt
Presidential Library.
</p>
<p>
That isn’t to say that the hearing doesn’t have consequences — or
revelations about what can be expected from the
all-but-certain-to-be-confirmed Interior secretary and future
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/trump-national-energy-council?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1" target="_self"><u>head
of Trump’s National Energy Council</u></a>. For many in the renewables
space — particularly those in the wind industry — there was little in
the way of reassurances that Burgum would temper
<a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/spotlight/offshore-wind-executive-order-trump" target="_self"><u>his
boss’ opposition to “windmills.”</u></a> Additionally, the future
Interior secretary dodged questions seeking reassurance about his
commitment to protecting federal lands.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>Below are some of the biggest takeaways from Thursday’s
confirmation hearing.
</p>
<h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>“Baseload” might be code for “no renewables”
</h2>
<p>
<strong></strong>Burgum referenced concerns about the “baseload” of the
grid more than 15 times during the hearing, primarily as a way to oppose
the buildout of renewable energy. “We’re short of electricity in this
country, and we have to make sure that we have a balance,” he told
Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, a Nevada Democrat, citing
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-wind-solar-fact-check#:~:text=26%2C%202022%5D-,Fact%20check%3A,-%E2%80%9CI%20mean%2C" target="_self"><u>a
standard Republican talking point</u></a> about how the grid needs
safeguards because “the sun doesn’t always shine and the wind doesn’t
always blow.” When pressured about how intermittent energy sources are
used in combination with storage, he added that we’re still “a few years
out” from such technologies and warned that in the meantime, there would
be “more and more brownouts and blackouts because we aren’t going to
have the balance in the grid.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t want the word ‘baseload’ to be code for no renewables,” Angus
King, the Independent Senator from Maine, later followed up. Burgum
protested against that characterization — “It’s not for any political
reasons that I distinguish [between intermittent and baseload], it’s
just because of the physics of the grid” — but King wasn’t satisfied.
“In your case, in North Dakota, 35% of your electricity comes from wind
power,” King said. “I presume that your grid works well?”
</p>
<p>
Burgum stumbled in his answer: “It’s super stressed, as it is around the
country,” he said. (In fact,
<a href="https://northdakotamonitor.com/2024/03/30/in-the-central-u-s-an-electric-grid-bottleneck-persists/" target="_blank"><u>transmission
bottlenecks</u></a> seem to be the bigger issue in the state.) He went
on to say that renewables plus storage equals a baseload at a “much
higher cost” than traditional energy sources like oil and gas.
</p>
<p>
“It sounds like no more renewables,” King rejoined. “I don’t think
that’s a sustainable path for this country, and it’s certainly not a way
of meeting the challenge of climate change.”
</p>
<p>
One carbon-free source of electricity emerged as a winner of the
baseload fight, however: nuclear power. “I’m glad to hear you talk about
baseload,” Republican Senator James Risch of Idaho told Burgum, “because
when you’re talking about nuclear, you’re talking about baseload.”
Burgum also called solar and geothermal “big opportunities” in Utah.
</p>
<h2>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Public land advocates are right to be worried
</h2>
<p>
<strong></strong>Ahead of Thursday’s confirmation hearing, Danielle
Murray, the founder of the Public Lands Center, issued a statement
arguing that if Burgum did not “[reject] any and all attempts to
sell-off or give away our nation’s public lands,” it would be
“disqualifying.”
</p>
<p>
She and other public land advocates are not likely to be satisfied with
the answers they heard, however. Burgum responded positively to an
opening question from Republican Senator Mike Lee of Utah about
restricting the size of National Monuments, noting that “a state like
yours … already has over 60% of its land in public lands.” The Energy
and Natural Resources Committee’s ranking member, Democratic Senator
Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, followed up on that point, asking Burgum
how he plans to “stay true to our conservation history”
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/utah-seven-county-blm#:~:text=Great%20meeting%20with%20%40dougburgum%20and%20planning%20the%20return%20of%20American%20lands%20to%20the%20American%20people" target="_self"><u>given
the mounting attempts</u></a> by Lee and his colleagues to “somehow, in
a wholesale way, divest of our public lands.”
</p>
<p>
Burgum remained noncommittal: “I think there is certainly the
opportunity for us to find that balance going forward,” he said again.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Coal is back, baby
</h3>
<p>
Burgum promised senators from Montana and Wyoming that he opposed a
“blanket approach of trying to block”
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/why-coals-slowdown-is-slowing-down" target="_self"><u>new
coal development</u></a>. “We have an opportunity to decarbonize, to
produce clean coal, and with that produce reliable baseload for this
country,” he said.
</p>
<p>
Why is that so important? “Without baseload, we’re going to lose the AI
arms race to China,” Burgum said.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>No reassurances about wind here
</h3>
<p>
Wind was another hot topic during Burgum’s confirmation hearing. King
pointed out that North Dakota is a major wind-producing state, and asked
if the Interior nominee would talk to President Trump about “the fact
that wind has its virtues and can contribute significantly” to America’s
energy supply.
</p>
<p>
Burgum was resistant. If wind projects “make sense, and they’re already
in law, then they’ll continue,” he allowed. “I think President Trump has
been very clear in his statements that he’s concerned about the
significant amount of tax incentives that have gone towards some forms
of energy that have helped exacerbate this imbalance that we’re seeing
right now.”
</p>
<p>
Risch celebrated Burgum’s skepticism of wind, rooting for the end of the
Lava Ridge wind farm, which Heatmap’s Jael Holzman has reported
<a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/hotspots/lava-ridge-wind-trump-executive-order#:~:text=1.%20Magic%20Valley%2C%20Idaho" target="_self"><u>Trump
may kill on day one</u></a>. “My good friend Senator King and I have
different views on windmills — and bless you for taking the windmills,
you can have them all,” Risch offered during his allotted time. “We
don’t want them in Idaho. We <em><em>hate</em></em> windmills in Idaho.”
(In 2023, wind accounted for
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/state/analysis.php?sid=ID#:~:text=The%20balance%20of%20Idaho's%20in,and%20wind%20accounted%20for%2015%25." target="_blank"><u>about
15%</u></a> of Idaho’s electricity generation.)
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Nobody likes bears
</h3>
<p>
But if there was something Republicans on the Energy and Natural
Resources Committee hated even more than wind, it was
<a href="https://heatmap.news/washington-state-wants-to-bring-back-grizzlies-and-i-was-needlessly-terrified" target="_self"><u>bears</u></a>.
Senator Daines of Montana specifically requested Burgum’s commitment to
<a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2025/01/09/feds-reject-state-petitions-to-delist-grizzly-bears-reaffirm-protected-status-in-montana-wyoming/#:~:text=A%20grizzly%20bear%20in%20the,Montana's%20and%20Idaho's%20elected%20officials." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>delisting
grizzlies from the Endangered Species List</u></a>, and he got what he
was looking for. “I’m with you,” Burgum said. “We should be celebrating
when species come off the endangered species list, as opposed to
fighting every way we can to try to keep them on that list.”
</p>
<p>
Risch was also excited about this promise. “We don’t want grizzly bears
[in Idaho],” he said. “They kill people. You know, the federal
government already gave us wolves.”
</p>
<p>
Grizzlies weren’t the only bears on the chopping block. Republican
Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska slammed the Biden administration’s
Interior for
<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/13/2025-00450/marine-mammals-proposed-incidental-harassment-authorization-for-the-southern-beaufort-sea-stock-of" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>not
finishing its revised incidental take regulations</u></a> for North
Slope oil and gas activities — that is, the gas industry’s exemption to
the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 which otherwise prohibits the
harassing, hunting, capturing, or killing of protected animals,
including polar bears. “I need your commitment that you’ll work with
Alaskans, particularly the Inupiat people up there, in the North Slope
Borough, on basically all things polar bear,” Murkowski said.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll be happy to do that,” Burgum confirmed.

<h2 id="lee-zeldin-keeps-his-cards-close-to-the-vest">Lee Zeldin Keeps
His Cards Close to the Vest</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-16, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTYyMzgwNC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0NjgxMTIxNn0.Y20NLCg_kTby1r_YzMQe3CanWng6ev6ZSumwhaHJQX4/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Confirmation hearings for Donald Trump’s energy and environment
appointees continued Thursday, with Lee Zeldin and Doug Burgum appearing
before the Senate for their nominations as Environmental Protection
Agency administrator and secretary of the Interior. While Burgum was
long tipped to get a major energy-related position in the Trump
administration, Zeldin’s nomination was more of a surprise. While he
worked on some local water and environmental issues during his time as a
congressman from eastern Long Island, he was mostly known for his work
on foreign and defense policy issues.
</p>
<p>
While Zeldin is likely to be confirmed thanks to the Republicans’ 53-47
Senate majority, he did not receive the same bipartisan lovefest as
Chris Wright did in his hearing Wednesday for his nomination as
secretary of Energy. Zeldin was formally introduced only by a
Republican, Wyoming Senator John Barrasso, whereas Wright received
introductions from a Democrat and Republican on the panel examining
him.<br/><br/>Here are three takeaways from today’s proceedings:
</p>
<h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Literal climate denial is dead.
</h2>
<p>
When asked by Senator Bernie Sanders “Do you agree with President-elect
Trump that climate change is a hoax?” Zeldin, a former member of the
bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus when in the House, said “I believe
that climate change is real,” but then went on to say that Trump’s
frequent claims, largely made during the 2016 presidential campaign,
that climate change is a hoax was more a criticism of policy than a
judgment of climate science.
</p>
<p>
When asked by Rhode Island Senator Sheldon Whitehouse about what effect
carbon dioxide emissions had on the atmosphere, after some back and
forth about listening to scientists and what obligations the EPA had to
regulate carbon dioxide, Zeldin said “trapping heat.”
</p>
<h2>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>But Zeldin does not take an expansive view of the EPA’s role.
</h2>
<p>
<span></span>Throughout the hearing, Zeldin returned again and again to
the idea that he wanted the EPA to focus on, as Trump often says, “clean
air and clean water,” that he wanted to “increase productivity of the
EPA,” and that he wanted it to be “accountable and transparent.” While
this sounds like so much Washington boilerplate, it is likely a sign
that Zeldin will not be advocating for any increase in the EPA’s roles
or responsibilities and would try to operate the agency with budgetary
and conceptual restraint.
</p>
<p>
<span></span><a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/relocating-epa-headquarters-blasted-as-decapitation/" target="_blank">Zeldin
did not endorse a proposal to move EPA’s headquarters</a> outside of
Washington, D.C., or comments by Department of Government Efficiency
co-head Vivek Ramaswamy that the government headcount should be reduced
by three-quarters, instead saying “I’m not aware of a single person
fired at the EPA during the first Trump administration”
(<a href="https://beyer.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=877" target="_blank">many
employees left under the leadership of Scott Pruitt</a>).
</p>
<h2>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Industry will likely have a friendlier ear at EPA.
</h2>
<p>
<strong></strong>Several Republican senators had specific grievances
with the current — or past — Democratic EPA leadership and policy,
largely around how the agency deals with local industries. Senator Todd
Sullivan of Alaska criticized the EPA
(<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/images-offer-fresh-look-at-alaska-raid-that-left-miners-fuming/" target="_blank"><u>in
2013</u></a>) for sending armed agents to inspect a mine in Alaska;
Senator Jerry Moran of Kansas was critical of “one size fits all
solutions” that applied to the state’s low-productivity “stripper” oil
wells; Senator John Boozman of Arkansas said the EPA agenda under Biden
“was shaped by the input from narrow group of stakeholders,” and asked
Zeldin “how will you work with industries more collectively to ensure
that their concerns are addressed while maintaining a balanced approach
to environmental protection?”
</p>
<p>
<span></span>“The worst thing that I could possibly do, that the EPA
could do is to turn a blind eye to great substantive feedback that will
better inform our decisions,” Zeldin said, indicating that industry
perspectives on environmental rules and enforcement actions will likely
receive a kinder ear under Zeldin than his predecessor.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>Exactly what those issues will be was not immediately clear
in the hearing. Any discussion of greenhouse gas emissions had to be
practically extracted from Zeldin by Democratic senators, while at the
same time Zeldin would not commit to scrapping Biden-era rules on power
plant and tailpipe emissions (which Trump frequently targeted on the
campaign trail), instead saying that he wouldn’t “prejudge” any
rule-making.

<p>
<strong>1. McIntosh County, Oklahoma </strong>– Say goodbye to the
Canadian River wind project, we hardly knew thee.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The TransAlta utility-scale wind facility was canceled mere days after
we were first to report on the uprising in favor of a ban on new
renewables in the state.
</li>
<li>
Local residents had banded together against the project due to its close
proximity to Lake Eufaula, a large reservoir. Opposition included
representatives of the
<a href="https://www.fox23.com/news/muscogee-nation-voices-concerns-over-canadian-company-trying-to-build-wind-farm-in-mcintosh-county/article_6b2f3884-9b26-11ef-9360-2b9fe2f543da.html" target="_blank"><u>native
Muscogee Tribe</u></a>.
</li>
<li>
TransAlta confirmed the project was dead in a statement to me last week
after state politicians were first to declare its demise. On Monday, the
company provided a statement in lieu of making someone available to
speak with me: “The unfortunate decision to terminate the project was
due to two primary reasons – challenges with land acquisition as well as
ongoing uncertainty regarding grid interconnection.”
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>2. Allen County, Ohio </strong>– A utility-scale project caught
in the crossfires over solar on farmland and local-vs-state conflicts
now appears deceased, too.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Attorneys representing Lightsource – the renewables division of bp plc –
told the Ohio Supreme Court in a filing last Thursday that it was
withdrawing from a protracted legal fight over the approval of Birch
Solar, a 375 megawatt solar project proposed in northwest Ohio that
would
<a href="https://www.supremecourt.ohio.gov/pdf_viewer/pdf_viewer.aspx?pdf=977270.pdf&subdirectory=2023-1011%5CDocketItems&source=DL_Clerk" target="_blank"><u>fuel
operations for Amazon</u></a>.<br/>
</li>
<li>
“Appellant has elected to suspend further development of the solar
facility,” attorneys for Lightsource stated
<a href="https://www.supremecourt.ohio.gov/pdf_viewer/pdf_viewer.aspx?pdf=977270.pdf&subdirectory=2023-1011%5CDocketItems&source=DL_Clerk" target="_blank"><u>in
their filing</u></a>.<br/>
</li>
<li>
As we previously explained, the Birch Solar case could have decided the
fate of all renewables in the state. The Ohio Power Siting Board
rejected Birch Solar
<a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2022/10/25/ohio-solar-project-killed-by-local-government-opposition/" target="_blank"><u>in
2022</u></a>, citing local opposition to claim it was not in the
public’s interest.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>3. Albany County, Wyoming </strong>– We have a new “wind kills
eagles” lawsuit to watch and it could derail a 252-megawatt project
slated to be fully online next year.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Two days before Christmas, Wyoming residents sued the Western Area Power
Administrator and Energy Department for approving Repsol’s Rail Tie wind
project, stating it would present an outsized threat to endangered bald
eagles.<br/>
</li>
<li>
The lawsuit seeks to invalidate permits and an interconnection approval
provided to the project under the Biden administration, citing the
National Environmental Policy Act.
</li>
<li>
The individual Wyoming residents are joined
<a href="https://wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Rail-Tie-lawsuit.pdf" target="_blank"><u>in
the lawsuit</u></a> by a local conservationist group and archeological
society. In addition, per the complaint, one of the Wyoming residents in
the lawsuit – Michael Lockhart – is a longtime biologist who previously
worked for more than three decades at the Fish and Wildlife Service and
has personally researched harm to bald eagles from wind energy.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>4. Martin County, Kentucky </strong>– I’ve been getting
complaints we’re too much of a downer in this newsletter and should
praise success stories. So here’s one: a solar farm in Kentucky on a
former coal site.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
This week, a solar farm developed by Savion (a.k.a. Shell) just
<a href="https://www.kentucky.com/news/business/article298526263.html" target="_blank"><u>became
operational</u></a>. It’s a rare example of a solar project being
greenlit in Kentucky, a state where we usually have nothing but bad news
to report.<br/>
</li>
<li>
I do however want to note my relative skepticism of the climate benefits
in building this project. A <em><em>lot</em></em> of the power will go
to Toyota via a
<a href="https://pressroom.toyota.com/toyota-supports-a-new-power-source-at-brownfield-site-in-kentucky/" target="_blank"><u>virtual
power plant purchase agreement</u></a> in order to meet their climate
pledges, at least on paper.<br/>
</li>
<li>
We’ve also seen backlash when solar projects fuel companies, not homes,
producing
<a href="https://www.kentucky.com/news/business/article298526263.html#storylink=cpy" target="_blank"><u>headlines
like</u></a>, “Kentucky’s newest solar farm is now active. Most of its
power goes to Toyota.”
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<em><em>Here’s what else we’re watching…</em></em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>In Delaware, </strong>U.S. Wind is

<h2 id="how-to-find-consensus-to-build-more-transmission">How to Find
Consensus to Build More Transmission</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-16, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTY1Nzk1Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0NTQ4NTI0NH0.oxElevrxp9ddhxrm5UbcM6HMmFbJCm0dYebj-sjyMpI/image.jpg?width=900&height=410&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Today we’re speaking with Cici Vu and Morgan Putnam from DNV Energy
Systems, who helped craft a must-read report out this week on community
relations in transmission with Americans for Clean Energy Grid (ACEG).
Their report compiles findings of a roundtable with environmentalists,
Indigenous rights activists, developers, and individual land owners, and
finds transmission can fare better than solar and wind in this current
political climate – and that community benefit agreements can be helpful
for getting projects across the finish line. But some issues divided the
roundtable, including how to structure labor benefits to ensure lots of
people get job opportunities from transmission.
</p>
<p>
The following is a lightly edited and abridged version of our
conversation:
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jael: </strong>Can you walk me through what you and ACEG found
as a part of your research?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Morgan:</strong> ACEG identify – like you have – that there is a
realness to the community opposition that can arise with these projects.
While there are clearly cases of money being spent to augment that, it
doesn’t mean the opposition isn’t present. ACEG’s interest was to help
make meaningful progress on this issue and figure out how we can do
better to accelerate the rate at which we develop transmission. As the
report calls out early on, development really proceeds at the pace of
trust within a community.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Cici: </strong>There are a lot of reports out there on best
practices. There are 1,500-page reports on desktop research and lots of
interviews and so forth. But I think ACEG hit the nail on the head by
bringing in the voices at the same table. With my expertise in
mediation, we were able to do that. The recruiting of all the voices
helped make the report more inclusive, and more comprehensive and more
holistic in viewpoints and perspectives.
</p>
<p>
The other thing that was really important was bridging the technical
aspects of these large infrastructure projects that are so complex that
communities don’t understand [them.] Being able to bring the large
complexities of these projects – transmission, in this case – and
community needs and interest, and being able to translate and interpret
and be able to talk to one another, is a core piece of this report.
</p>
<p>
The tool that gets us there is these community benefits agreements,
project work agreements. And they only work well and are effective if
they are co-developed with the voices, the developers, the landowners,
the host communities alike.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jael: </strong>Did you feel there was a need for a consensus on
best practices for community engagement?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Cici</strong>: It’s a differentiator. It’s one of the reasons
we’re doing this.
</p>
<p>
We all recognize the needs of load growth demand. But to most
effectively advance some of these best practices and make them
actionable, these trusted voices have to discuss and agree. Or not agree
– because we have a non-consensus segment as well where there were
issues that did not meet consensus. When that happened, we made a
recommendation to continue the discussion toward consensus.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jael: </strong>What issues were most difficult to find consensus
on and why?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Cici</strong>: The big piece of tension was how would these
projects treat workforce development [and] bring in a local workforce
while balancing the needs of labor,because labor has the skills. For
instance, one of the issues was that local workforces need to be
up-skilled in a way that is much more structured and systematic because
there are safety issues in climbing a pole and doing electrification and
things like that.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jael: </strong>At a high level, are we seeing a similar broad
backlash to transmission like what we’re seeing in specific communities
with solar and wind?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Morgan:</strong> No, we’re not. It could happen. But those types
of things you’re referencing are not yet occurring in transmission. I
think it is less likely but not impossible, because–
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jael: </strong>What about
<a href="https://hpj.com/2024/09/13/as-grain-belt-express-moves-nearer-to-construction-fights-move-to-center-stage/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Grain
Belt Express</u></a> or what’s happened
<a href="https://www.wfmd.com/2025/01/15/resolution-opposing-md-piedmont-reliability-project-under-consideration-by-the-frederick-county-council/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>around
Piedmont</u></a>? Do those situations give you any pause?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Morgan:</strong> So Grain Belt I think a little bit but it’s in
a different category in my mind. Grain Belt is a specific project and,
well, just look at the MISO region where that project sits. MISO’s
moving forward with a lot of transmission. That project is but one
project and it is being developed by an independent transmission
developer that has… I think they face additional hurdles at times by
virtue of their independence.
</p>
<p>
Having said that, I think the earlier statement still applies to all
transmission. It’s about trust. It’s something where I think if you have
the trust and support of the communities, you’re going to be able to
move the projects forward.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Cici: </strong>We’ve seen a lot of momentum in favor of longer
term regional planning of transmission. We haven’t seen as much
attention on the triggering words we see with solar, or wind, and the
incoming administration for transmission. And we also have a lot of the
load demand, which is data centers.
</p>
<p>
We’re all crossing our fingers with the incoming administration. It’s so
unpredictable.

<p>
<strong>1. Youngkin sides with locals </strong>– Virginia Gov. Glenn
Youngkin
<a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2025/january/name-1038956-en.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this
week said</a> at his State of the State address that he would oppose
efforts to “end local control of solar project siting” – indicating he
will fiercely challenge efforts by some state policymakers to resolve
challenges posed by town and county restrictions on renewables by
overriding them.<br/>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
“Local communities must be able to exercise their rights with regards to
land use,” Youngkin said, adding a comparison that tied solar’s growth
to the data center boom in the state. “Different communities will make
different decisions on data centers but these must be their decisions.”
</li>
<li>
As we
<a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/policy-watch/advanced-manufacturing-tax-credit-foreign-entity-concern" style="" target="_self">previously
explained</a>, solar developers are
<a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/30/solar-developers-seeking-changes-to-local-siting-process-again/" style="" target="_blank">seeking

<p>
<strong>2. More like Hearing Watch </strong>– We’re starting to learn
how Trump’s most significant nominees may run federal energy and climate
agencies. <em><em>Thank you, senatorial advise and consent
process!</em></em>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Most crucially, we heard from Energy Secretary-in-waiting Chris Wright
who yesterday offered largely predictable pro-business comments that
leave open the possibility Trump 2.0 will not mean an end to all federal
support for the energy transition.
</li>
<li>
But there was one moment that stood out to me personally: Wright said he
would “immediately engage” on a report released by DOE’s inspector
general that called for a halt to operations of the Loan Programs
Office, a key vehicle for supporting decarbonization projects across the
country. It’s unclear how a pause would impact any and all conditional
loan commitments issued by the Biden administration.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>3. Using land for data </strong>– One of Biden’s final days this
week was spent opening up federal lands for constructing data centers in
order to give the U.S. a leg up in developing artificial intelligence.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The proposal tries to encourage data center companies to use renewable
energy sources and instructs federal regulators to select ideal sites
for constructing renewable projects close to or collocated with proposed
or completed data centers.
</li>
<li>
It’s possible that this entire thing is ripped up on Day 1 of Trump 2.0
and I’m skeptical this will have much sway on the pace of developing
either renewables or data centers. But kudos for trying.

CDC recommends faster testing for bird flu in hospitalized patients</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>People hospitalized for flu should be tested for bird flu within 24
hours, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on
Thursday, in an expansion of the agency’s efforts to tackle increasing
infections in humans. </p>
<p>The advisory is intended to prevent delays in identifying human cases
of avian influenza A (H5N1) viruses amid high levels of seasonal
influenza. </p>
<p>The risk to the general public from bird flu is low, and there has
been no further evidence of person to person spread, the agency
said. </p>
<p>Still, influenza A-positive patients, particularly those in an
intensive care unit, should be tested ideally within 24 hours of
hospitalization to identify the viral subtype and determine whether they
have bird flu, the agency said. </p>
<p>Prior to Thursday’s guidance, hospitals generally sent batches of
samples to labs for subtyping every few days. </p>
<p>Faster testing also aims to help doctors identify how people became
infected and provide their close contacts with testing and medicine more
quickly, if needed, said Nirav Shah, the agency’s principal deputy
director, on a call with reporters. </p>
<p>The CDC does not believe it has been missing bird flu infections in
people, Shah said. No surveillance system detects 100% of cases, he
added later. </p>
<p>“The system is working as it should,” said Shah, adding that health
officials want results sooner in case any public health action is
needed. “What we need is to shift to a system that tells us what’s
happening in the moment.” </p>
<p>Nearly 70 people in the United States, most of them farmworkers, have
contracted bird flu since April, as the virus has circulated among
poultry flocks and dairy herds. Three people have tested positive
without a clear source of exposure to the virus, according to CDC. </p>
<p>Most infections in humans have been mild, but one fatality was
reported in Louisiana last week. </p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture has more than 300 personnel
working on its bird flu response and has spent $1.5 billion on its
efforts to curb the spread among poultry and dairy cattle, said Eric
Deeble, a deputy undersecretary at the agency. </p>
<p>The USDA last week said it would rebuild a bird flu vaccine stockpile
for poultry. </p>
<p>USDA officials have met several times with the transition team of the
incoming Donald Trump administration to try to ensure a smooth handoff
on agency actions to curb the spread of the virus, including a tabletop
exercise at the White House on Wednesday, Deeble said. </p>
<p>Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services, which
encompasses CDC, also have repeatedly met with the transition team on
Zoom calls and have shared their bird flu playbook, officials said on
the press call.  </p>
<p>HHS said on Thursday it plans to put $211 million toward mRNA-based
vaccine technology to better respond to emerging infectious diseases
such as bird flu.</p>

Customs agents intercept contraband cars headed overseas</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SPARROWS POINT, MARYLAND — Most Americans and visitors to the United
States encounter Customs and Border Protection agents when they enter or
return to the country at land crossings or airports. But CBP also is
responsible for inspecting goods leaving the country, which creates a
nearly impossible assignment of trying to intercept all stolen
automobiles being shipped out of the U.S.</p>
<p>At the Port of Baltimore, CBP scrutinizes several hundred vehicles
every day, and on average will find one illegal export — nearly all
headed to a particular region of the world, says Adam Rottman, CBP’s
director at the Port of Baltimore. He acknowledges that CBP has neither
the time nor manpower to inspect every shipping container.</p>
<p>“I’d say 90 to 95% of every one of our stolen automobiles is headed
to West Africa,” he tells VOA.</p>
<p>Alex Piquero, a professor of criminology at the University of Miami,
said, “There are people who are stealing cars and car parts to sell them
very quickly in the local markets. And then there are people literally
stealing cars and putting them on containers and selling them, shipping
them all over the world, not just to Africa, but also to the Middle East
and to Asia.”</p>
<p>On any given day at the Port of Baltimore, CBP’s manifest of seized
vehicles resembles the inventory of a small used car lot: a Kia
purchased fraudulently at auction in New Jersey is bound for Ghana; a
Mercedes-Benz valued at $48,000, purchased with a stolen identity in
Ohio, is slated for shipment to Togo; a $75,000 Ford Raptor inside a
container with one or two additional stolen vehicles and boxes of new
power tools is headed for West Africa.</p>
<p>Rottman peeks inside one container for which no vehicles are
listed.</p>
<p>“It’s supposed to be only household goods in there,” he says. “In
this example, there’s at least three, probably four cars in that
container.”</p>
<p>Rottman walks to another container opened for inspection.</p>
<p>“This container, we just opened today. The vehicle on the top there,
that Honda, we’ve already verified through the VIN (vehicle
identification number) that the car is stolen. There’s two [vehicles],
more in the back,” he says.</p>
<p>CBP operates giant mobile X-ray trucks, the VACIS M6500s, which in
minutes can scan shipping containers and determine if they should be
opened for a closer inspection.</p>
<p>A growing problem</p>
<p>Auto theft is a problem accelerating across the United States. While
the early part of the 2010s saw a decline in vehicle thefts, there has
been a notable increase since 2020, influenced by factors that include
the coronavirus pandemic and social media videos demonstrating how
certain car models can easily be stolen.</p>
<p>The criminals frequently rent cars for a 30-day period and
immediately drive them into a nearby container and paste a fake VIN over
the real one. The car will not be reported stolen by the rental agency
for a month. By then, it may already be on a ship.</p>
<p>Rottman stands in front of the container that has the expensive Ford
Raptor inside.</p>
<p>“They’ll take the VIN number on the dashboard on your windshield.
They’ll make a fake VIN. They’ll put it over the top, glue it on, so it
would come up [on computer databases] clean, or it’s not on file when we
look it up,” he explains. “But right away, we noticed the checked digit
on the VIN doesn’t match what’s supposed to be on a Ford truck.”</p>
<p>For some buyers in Africa or on other continents, unwittingly
acquiring a car stolen in the U.S. may seem like a good deal, but some
of the vehicles are known to have been in accidents and could be unsafe,
including airbags that no longer work.</p>
<p>“You could be putting your family members in danger by driving some
of these stolen cars,” says Rottman.</p>
<p>There is also a moral hazard.</p>
<p>“When they purchase a car like this that’s been stolen, they’re
funding these transnational criminal organizations. And criminal
organizations are willing to do anything to make money,” Rottman says,
noting that such activities by car theft gangs include human
trafficking, drug smuggling and even terrorism.</p>
<p>Authorities in some African countries are working with Interpol and
other transnational law enforcement agencies to seize some of the stolen
vehicles that slip through American ports.</p>
<p>Cooperation is not consistent because of government corruption in
some countries.</p>
<p>“Some governments will play nicer, and other governments won’t, and
you can’t search every container. And that’s why the security at the
port is so critically important,” Piquero of the University of Miami
told VOA.</p>
<p>With so many buyers seeking a deal on a used car — often with no
questions asked — there is unlikely to be a slowdown anytime soon in the
global traffic of stolen vehicles.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
After a week and a half of
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/palisades-eaton-fire-photos" target="_self"><u>unimaginable
destruction</u></a>, Los Angeles is at last
<a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/live/2025-01-16/fire-winds-los-angeles-california-eaton-altadena-palisades-updates" target="_blank"><u>beginning
to look toward its recovery</u></a><em> </em>from the Palisades and
Eaton fires. Traversing that stage will take years, not only because of
the significant
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/los-angeles-fires-cost" target="_self"><u>economic</u></a>
and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/los-angeles-fires-zone-zero" target="_self"><u>political
implications</u></a> of the fires, but also because of what they will
mean for the health and well-being of the thousands of residents who
live in or near the burn zones.
</p>
<p>
Los Angeles isn’t navigating the crisis alone, though. In the wake of
the deadly 2023 Maui wildfire, researchers at the University of Hawaii
launched
<a href="https://www.mauiwes.info/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
Maui Wildfire Exposure Study</u></a>, a multi-year effort to track the
disaster’s physical and mental health impacts on residents. Though the
demographics of West Maui differ greatly from those of Pacific Palisades
or Altadena — two of
<a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/california-wildfires/article/la-fire-home-cost-20023098.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
most affluent zip codes in the country</u></a> — California public
officials, medical professionals, and wildfire survivors can still learn
from the ongoing work of the MauiWES.
</p>
<p>
To that end, I spoke yesterday with Ruben Juarez, one of the study’s
lead researchers. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for
clarity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What is the Maui Wildfire Exposure Study?</strong>
</p>
<p>
The Maui Wildfire Exposure Study follows a comprehensive cohort of
people affected by the 2023 fires. We collected data six months after
the fire, and typically, we’re looking for the long-term effects. For
60% of the individuals who came to the study, it was their first health
check since the fires.
</p>
<p>
It is a pretty interesting population: They’re underserved and typically
lack access to health care. We found three main trends: The first was
mental and physical health issues. Access to care was a big issue in
Hawaii, and I’m hoping that’s not going to be the case in California,
but it definitely was here. Housing, job, and food insecurity were other
big issues, as were the social impacts.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What have you learned about the mental and physical health of
people exposed to the Maui wildfires?</strong>
</p>
<p>
Pre-wildfire we knew that the rate of depression symptoms in the Maui
population was about 30%. Post-wildfire, we’re seeing more like 52%, so
more than one in two participants in the study were showing depression
symptoms. Low self-esteem was another issue. Something that was really
worrisome was suicidal ideation: Pre-wildfire, it was less than 1%;
post-wildfire, at least for the people in the cohort, it was about 4% of
the population. That’s more than a four-time increase.
</p>
<p>
The second issue is physical health: Nearly half of the participants
reported worse health since the fires. We saw respiratory issues, such
as coughing, wheezing, difficulty breathing, and also skin and eye
irritation, fatigue, and weakness. We’re seeing that about 74% of the
participants are facing a heightened risk of cardiovascular disease. We
also performed a lung check using spirometry and oscillometry breathing.
Based on the spirometry measure, 60% of participants may have poor lung
health, and 40% may have mild to severe lung obstruction. We believe
this is associated with the exposure to ash and the personal protective
equipment individuals wore when they returned to the fire site.
</p>
<p>
<strong>We’ve written a lot about the dangers of wildfire smoke at
Heatmap, but I think people are less aware of the risks of wildfire ash.
Could you say more?</strong>
</p>
<p>
It’s really toxic. People need to take care of themselves. There are the
harmful substances you’d expect in ash: lead, arsenic, asbestos — those
are poisons.
</p>
<p>
Why was our population in Lahaina affected by this? Because they went
back to the burned homes and did not wear any PPE. To me, that was
crazy. The county said that wearing PPE was a voluntary decision, and
that was a mistake. And PPE is not just a mask: you really need eye
protection, gloves, footwear, and long clothing, because the ash is
really toxic.
</p>
<p>
Even in small amounts, the poisons in ash can harm the lungs and the
heart, and there are long-term effects, including cancer, which is one
of the things we’re trying to prevent. In the case of Hawaii, for the
initial batch of 767 individuals in the study, we did a heavy metal
analysis — a comprehensive panel of 32 of the most expected heavy
metals. We already knew that five of the most common heavy metals were
found in ash present in Hawaii: arsenic, lead, antimony, copper, and
cobalt. We learned that 20% of participants affected by the fires in our
cohort were showing an elevated level of at least one of these heavy
metals, which is <em><em>not </em></em>something that you would expect.
We don’t want these things in our bodies at any level. People must know
that these things are harmful and they need to take care of their
health.
</p>
<p>
<strong>And that’s all just from people returning to their homes and
sifting through the ash? Or can ash blow into an area that didn’t burn
and affect people that way, as well?</strong>
</p>
<p>
Many participants were uneducated about the harmful effects ash has,
especially when it has contact with your skin. But you should also avoid
breathing or swallowing soot and ash at any cost. The effects were seen
in individuals who had direct contact at a site or were indirectly
exposed through smoke or blowing winds — but the majority was direct
contact.
</p>
<p>
<strong>That’s so scary.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Not everything was bad news. We found some exciting ways to potentially
address some of these issues. For instance, resiliency was at the top of
the minds of many participants in the study: “How can I be resilient?
How can I survive this catastrophe?”
</p>
<p>
We also found that lower-income individuals trust and use community
organizations more than government services, like federal, state, and
county agencies. This information could potentially help us intervene,
especially when considering underserved populations like immigrant
populations. They just don’t trust the government. Addressing issues
through community organizations on the ground was extremely helpful
because it allowed people to access the services they needed.
</p>
<p>
Another thing that we noticed that was super helpful was that people who
maintain strong relationships with family and friends experience better
health outcomes. Social isolation after a wildfire was really bad,
especially for mental health problems. Individuals who are more
connected with their friends, family, or are doing something in their
community volunteering tend to have better health outcomes, particularly
in terms of depression.
</p>
<p>
<strong>How close do you need to have been to a wildfire to experience
these effects?</strong>
</p>
<p>
Individuals whose homes were on the perimeter of the burn area
experienced more physical symptoms, worse quality of life, and worse
mental health. But that doesn’t mean that if your house doesn’t burn,
you will not experience any of the symptoms. Even if you didn’t go to a
contaminated site, there was all the smoke over the city, and you’re
exposed to that. Individuals who are not directly affected can be
indirectly affected — at a lower rate, of course, as you’d expect.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Many of the mental health impacts you described were related to
things like housing, job, or food insecurity, as well as the lack of
access to healthcare resources following a fire. Would you expect mental
health impacts to not be as bad in L.A., since it was a more affluent
area that burned?</strong>
</p>
<p>
Yes. In fact, coincidentally, one of our scientific advisory board
members is a resident of L.A., and he’s been saying that he doesn’t
expect the health effects to be as bad in L.A. as they were in Maui
because the shortage of doctors is not as big. Also, the type of
demographic that is being affected is more affluent.
</p>
<p>
Having said that, in Hawaii, we had the advantage of winds that blew
smoke and soot away. I was reading reports that in L.A., there were no
winds, and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/los-angeles-fires-smoke" target="_self"><u>the
smoke was just staying there</u></a>. In that case, the effects in terms
of pulmonary health won’t just be the people directly affected, but the
whole city.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What would you want emergency managers and medical professionals
in Los Angeles to know about your study as they address the impacts of
these fires?</strong>
</p>
<p>
First, we must emphasize to people that this is not a forest fire;
houses are burning, full of toxic substances. People need to know that
if they return to the burn zone, they need to take care of their health
and ensure they are wearing PPE. We need to conduct many communication
campaigns around this.
</p>
<p>
The second thing is, don’t underestimate the power of community and
community organizations, especially in L.A., where there are many
immigrant populations. Community organizations should be used to provide
information because people don’t trust the government or FEMA officials.
</p>
<p>
The third thing I would emphasize is that after a disaster, when people
struggle with housing, job, and food insecurity, their health becomes a
lower priority. This is understandable, but unfortunately, neglecting
your health at this time can worsen the long-term effects. It’s really
important that we emphasize to individuals that even if you don’t have a
house or a job right now, you need to take care of your health.
</p>
<p>
An example of this is in the aftermath of 9/11; years later, more lives
have been lost due to exposure to environmental hazards than the
disaster itself. If we don’t intervene early on, things can get really
bad. That’s what we are trying to do: prevent those long-term effects
from happening.

<p class="drop-caps">
Here’s a grim fact: The
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/what-you-need-to-know-la-fires" target="_self"><u>most
destructive fires</u></a> in recent American history swept over a state
with the country’s strictest wildfire-specific building code, including
in some of the neighborhoods that are
<a href="https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/03beab8511814e79a0e4eabf0d3e7247/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>now
largely smoldering rubble</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
California’s wildfire building code, Chapter 7A, went into effect in
2008, and it mandates fire-resistant siding, tempered glass, vegetation
management, and vents for attics and crawlspaces designed to resist
embers and flames. The code is the “most robust” in the nation, Lisa
Dale, a lecturer at the Columbia Climate School and a former
environmental policy advisor for the State of Colorado, told me. It
applies to nearly any newly built structure in one of the zones mapped
out by state and local officials as especially prone to fire hazard.
</p>
<p>
The adoption of 7A followed years of code development and mapping of
hazardous areas, largely in response to devastating urban wildfires such
as the Tunnel Fire, which claimed more than 3,000 structures and 25
lives in Oakland and Berkeley in 1991, and kicked off renewed efforts to
harden Californian homes.
</p>
<p>
The Federal Emergency Management Agency’s report on the 1991 fire makes
for
<a href="https://www.caloes.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/Fire-Rescue/Documents/US-Fire-Admin-East-Bay-Hills-Fire-Report.pdf" target="_blank"><u>familiar
reading</u></a> as the Palisades and Eaton fires still smolder. The
wildland-urban interface, it says, was put at extreme risk by a
combination of dry air, little rainfall, hot winds blowing east to west,
built-up vegetation that was too close to homes, steep hills, and
limited access to municipal water. The report also castigates the
“unregulated use of wood shingles as roof and siding material.”
</p>
<p>
This was not the first time a destructive fire on the wildland-urban
interface had been partially attributed to ignitable building materials.
The 1961 Bel-Air fire, for instance, which claimed almost 200 homes,
including that of Burt Lancaster, and the 1959 Laurel Canyon fire were
both, FEMA said, evidence of “the wood roof and separation from natural
fuels problems,” as were fires in 1970 and 1980 near where the Tunnel
Fire eventually struck in 1970 and 1980.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>But it was the sheer scale of the Tunnel Fire that prompted
action by California lawmakers.
</p>
<p>
Throughout the 1990s, fire-resilient roofing requirements were ramped
up, designating which materials were allowed in fire hazard areas and
throughout the state. By all accounts, the building code works — but
only when and where it’s in force. Dale told me that compliant homes
were
<a href="https://headwaterseconomics.org/wp-content/uploads/HE_2023_Missing-the-Mark-Wildfire.pdf" target="_blank"><u>five
times as likely to survive a wildfire</u></a>.
<a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w29621/w29621.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Research</u></a>
by economists Judson Boomhower and Patrick Baylis found that the code
“reduced average structure loss risk during a wildfire by 16 percentage
points, or about a 40% reduction.”
</p>
<p>
“The challenge from the perspective of wildfire vulnerability is that
those codes are relatively recent, and the housing stock turns over
really slowly, so we have this enormous stock of already built homes in
dangerous places that are going to be out there for decades,” Boomhower
told me.
</p>
<p>
The 7A building code applies only to new buildings, however. In
long-settled areas of California like Pacific Palisades, which has
little new housing construction or even existing home turnover due to
high costs and permitting complications, especially in areas under the
jurisdiction of the California Coastal Commission, many houses are not
just failing to comply with Chapter 7A, but also with any housing code
at all.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>Looking at which homes had survived past fires, Steve
Quarles, who helped advise the California State Fire Marshal on
developing 7A, told me, “What really mattered was if it was built under
<em><em>any</em></em> building code.” Many homes destroyed by the fires
in Los Angeles likely were not. In Pacific Palisades, fire management is
a frequent topic of
<a href="https://edlenteam.com/new-wildfire-disclosure-report/" target="_blank"><u>concern
and discussion</u></a>. But as late as 2018, local media in Pacific
Palisades noted that the area
<a href="https://palisadesnews.com/the-right-roof-in-pacific-palisades-is-important-for-fire-safety/" target="_blank"><u>still
had some homes with wood shingle roofs</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>While a complete inventory of homes lost in the Palisades
and Eaton fires has yet to be taken, the neighborhoods were full of
older homes. According to CalFire incident reports, of the almost 47,000
structures in the zone of the Palisades Fire, more than 8,000 were built
before 1939, and 44,560 were built before 2009. For the Eaton Fire area,
of the around 41,000 structures, almost 14,000 were built before 1939,
and only around 1,000 were built since 2010.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>A Pacific Palisades home designed by architect Greg Chasen
and built in 2024, however, survived the fire and went viral on X after
he posted a photo of it still standing after the flames had moved
through. The home embodied some of the best practices for fire-safe
building,

to </u><u><em><em>Bloomberg</em></em></u></a>, including
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/los-angeles-fires-zone-zero" target="_self"><u>keeping
vegetation away from the building</u></a>, a metal roof, tempered glass,
and fire-resistant siding.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>When Michael Wara, the director of Stanford University’s
Climate and Energy Policy Program,
<a href="https://woodsinstitute.stanford.edu/system/files/publications/New_Strategy_Wildfire_Epidemic_Whitepaper_1.pdf" target="_blank"><u>spoke
with firefighters and insurance industry officials</u></a> in the
process of drafting a 2021 report for the Stanford Woods Institute for
the Environment on strategies for mitigating wildfire risk, they told
him that, from their perspective, wildfires are often a matter of “home
ignition,” meaning that while building near forested areas puts any home
at risk, the risk of a home itself igniting varies based on how it’s
built and the vegetation clearance around it. “Existing homes in high
fire threat areas” built before the implementation of California’s
wildfire building codes, Wara wrote, “are a massive problem.” At the
time he published the paper, there were somewhere between 700,000 and
1.3 million pre-building code homes still standing in “high or very high
threat areas.”
</p>
<p>
<span></span>The flipside of focusing on “home ignition” and the
building code is that the building code works better over time, as more
and more homes comply with it thanks to normal turnover, people
extensively renovating, or even tearing down old homes — or rebuilding
after fires. Homes that are close to homes that don’t ignite in a fire
are more likely to survive.
</p>
<p>
<span></span><a href="https://fireecology.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s42408-021-00117-0" target="_blank"><u>One
study</u></a> that looked at the 2018 Camp Fire, which destroyed more
than 18,000 structures and claimed more than 80 lives in the Northern
California town of Paradise, sampled homes built before 1997, between
1997 and 2018, and from 2018 onwards, and found that only 11.5% of
pre-1997 homes survived, compared to 38.5% from 1997 and after. The
researchers also found that building survivability had a kind of
magnifying effect, with distance from the nearest destroyed structure
and the number structures destroyed in the immediate area among “the
strongest predictors of survival.”
</p>
<p>
<span></span>“The more homes that comply, the less chance you get those
structural ignitions and the less chance you get those huge disasters
like this,” Doug Green, who manages Headwaters Economics’ Community
Assistance for Wildfire Program, told me. “It takes people doing the
right thing to their own home — dealing with vegetation, making sure
roofs are clean, having right roofing. It’s really a community-wide
strategy to stop fires that happen like this.”
</p>
<p>
<span></span>But just as any home hardening — or just building to code —
is more effective the more the homes around you do it as well, it’s just
as true in reverse. “If your next door neighbors don’t do that work, the
effectiveness of your efforts will be less,” Dale said. “Building codes
ultimately work best when we get an entire landscape or neighborhood to
adopt them.”

out of the University of California, Los Angeles, concludes that climate
change intensified the city’s devastating wildfires. The UCLA
researchers estimated that intense heat caused by climate change may be
linked to about 25% of the fuel that fed the fires. “We believe that the
fires would still have been extreme without the climate change
components,” the authors wrote, “but would have been somewhat smaller
and less intense.” This analysis is not peer reviewed, and the
scientists call for further research. But they add that future wildfire
mitigation should focus on “factors we can control,” like stopping
people from lighting fires, making homes fire-resistant, and thinking
more carefully about where we build.

already have funding locked in and will therefore be able to stick

<p>
Yesterday’s confirmation hearing for Chris Wright, a fracking executive
and Trump’s pick to lead the Department of Energy, proved to be
relatively low-key and collegial. Wright repeatedly avowed that climate
change is happening and is caused by the combustion of hydrocarbons,
although he demurred that it was a “global” problem and turned his
responses repeatedly to energy innovation and developing energy
resources in the United States. He lamented that fossil fuels had
“fallen out of fashion and out of favor,” but also expressed enthusiasm
for certain clean energy technologies, including next-generation
geothermal and nuclear power. “Wright’s relatively easy reception
reflects the fact that there actually are wide areas of bipartisan
agreement on the kind of energy research and technology development work
the Department of Energy does,”

Blue Origin reaches orbit in first New Glenn launch, misses booster
landing</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida — Blue Origin’s giant New Glenn rocket
blasted off from Florida early Thursday morning on its first mission to
space, an inaugural step into Earth’s orbit for Jeff Bezos’ space
company as it aims to rival SpaceX in the satellite launch business.</p>
<p>Thirty stories tall with a reusable first stage, New Glenn launched
around 2 a.m. ET (0700 GMT) from Blue Origin’s launchpad at the Cape
Canaveral Space Force Station, its seven engines thundering for miles
under cloudy skies on its second liftoff attempt this week.</p>
<p>Hundreds of employees at the company’s Kent, Washington headquarters
and its Cape Canaveral, Florida rocket factory roared in applause as
Blue Origin VP Ariane Cornell announced the rocket’s second stage made
it to orbit, achieving a long-awaited milestone.</p>
<p>“We hit our key, critical, number-one objective, we got to orbit
safely,” Cornell said on a company live stream. “And y’all we did it on
our first go.”</p>
<p>The rocket’s reusable first stage booster was due to land on a barge
in the Atlantic Ocean after separating from its second stage, but failed
to make that landing, Cornell confirmed. Telemetry from the booster
blacked out minutes after liftoff.</p>
<p>“We did in fact lose the booster,” Cornell said.</p>
<p>The culmination of a decade-long, multi-billion-dollar development
journey, the mission marks Blue Origin’s first trek to Earth’s orbit in
the 25 years since Bezos founded the company.</p>
<p>Bezos told Reuters on Sunday, before Blue Origin’s first launch
attempt, that he was most nervous about landing the booster.</p>
<p>But he added that sticking the landing would be the “icing on the
cake” if they could achieve the milestone of getting the payload to its
intended orbit.</p>
<p>Secured inside New Glenn’s payload bay for the mission is the first
prototype of Blue Origin’s Blue Ring vehicle, a maneuverable spacecraft
the company plans to sell to the Pentagon and commercial customers for
national security and satellite servicing missions.</p>
<p>The rocket’s first attempt to launch on Monday was scrubbed around 3
a.m. ET because ice had accumulated on a propellant line. On Thursday,
the company cited no issues ahead of launch.</p>
<p>Bezos monitored the launch from a few miles away in Blue Origin’s
mission control room, wearing a large headset and flanked by dozens of
launch staff. The company’s CEO, Dave Limp, was next to him.</p>
<p>New Glenn is expected to press ahead with a backlog of dozens of
missions worth hundreds of millions of dollars, including up to 27
launches for Amazon’s Kuiper satellite internet network that will rival
SpaceX’s Starlink service.</p>
<p>New Glenn is the latest U.S. rocket to debut in recent years as
governments and private companies beef up their space programs and race
to challenge Elon Musk’s SpaceX and its workhorse Falcon 9.</p>
<p>NASA’s giant Space Launch System rocket had a successful debut in
2022, as did the Vulcan rocket last year from United Launch Alliance,
Boeing and Lockheed Martin’s joint launch venture.</p>
<p>New Glenn is roughly twice as powerful as Falcon 9, the world’s most
active rocket, with a payload bay diameter two times larger to fit
bigger batches of satellites. Blue Origin has not disclosed the rocket’s
launch pricing. Falcon 9 starts at around $62 million.</p>
<p>The development of New Glenn has spanned three Blue Origin CEOs and
faced numerous delays as SpaceX grew into an industry juggernaut.</p>
<p>SpaceX’s giant, next-generation Starship rocket in development, which
New Glenn will also compete with, is expected to further rattle the
industry with cheap rides to space and full reusability.</p>
<p>Bezos in late 2023 moved to speed things up at Blue Origin,
prioritizing the development of New Glenn and its BE-4 engines. He named
Limp, an Amazon veteran, as CEO, who employees say introduced a sense of
urgency to compete with SpaceX.</p>

<p>date: 2025-01-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Southern California firefighters made some progress in containing two
major wildfires, while forecasters said weather conditions in the coming
days could bring welcome relief from the days of dry air and high winds
that have plagued the region.</p>
<p>The relief will give firefighters a key window to battle the
Palisades Fire on the west edge of Los Angeles and the Eaton Fire in the
foothills east of the city before another potential turn to dangerous
conditions next week.</p>
<p>“Good news: We are expecting a much-needed break from the fire
weather concerns to close this week,” the National Weather Service said
Wednesday. “Bad News: Next week is a concern. While confident that we
will NOT see a repeat of last week, dangerous fire weather conditions
are expected.”</p>
<p>The Palisades Fire was 21% contained late Wednesday after burning 96
square kilometers, according to the California Department of Foresty and
Fire Protection. The agency said the Eaton Fire was 45% contained and
had burned 57 square kilometers.</p>
<p>More than 82,000 people were under evacuation orders, while 8,500
firefighters from the United States, Canada and Mexico were battling the
two fires and several smaller ones in the region.</p>
<p>The fires have killed at least 25 people and burned 12,000 homes and
other structures, according to authorities.</p>
<p>The wildfires ignited Jan. 7, fueled by strong Santa Ana winds in a
region that has been largely without rain for eight months. Weather
forecasts show little to no chance of rain in the next week.</p>

<p>date: 2025-01-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, will be among several
billionaires attending Donald Trump’s second presidential inauguration.
Tesla CEO Musk was instrumental in Trump’s reelection with his
contribution of over a quarter of a billion dollars to Trump’s campaign
coffers, according to Forbes. Musk is set to head Trump’s new Department
of Government Efficiency, along with Vivek Ramaswamy, the biotech
entrepreneur.</p>
<p>Reports say that Musk is slated to be seated at the inauguration with
fellow billionaires Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Meta CEO Mark
Zuckerberg.</p>
<p>While it is not customary to invite foreign leaders, Trump has
invited several. Argentinian President Javier Milei is expected to
attend, according to Bloomberg. Milei was the first foreign leader to
meet with Trump after he won November’s election. Trump has also invited
Chinese President Xi Jinping who is sending an envoy. Far-right Italian
Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has also received an invitation, but she
has said she is not sure her schedule will allow her to attend.</p>
<p>It is customary for all the living presidents to attend the
inauguration. Outgoing President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden
will attend Monday’s ceremony. When Biden was sworn in four years ago,
following Trump’s losing reelection bid, Trump did not attend because he
held on to the belief that he had won the election.</p>
<p>Former Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton will
also attend Trump’s inauguration. Bush and Clinton are set to be there
with their wives, Laura Bush and former Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton.</p>
<p>“Former first lady Michelle Obama will not attend the upcoming
inauguration,” the Office of Barack and Michelle Obama said in a
statement. It will be the second time in recent weeks, following her
absence at President Jimmy Carter’s funeral, that she has not attended a
public ceremony with other former presidents and their wives.</p>
<p>Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband, second gentleman
Douglas Emhoff, are also expected to be at the ceremony Monday. Harris
was the Democratic candidate in last year’s presidential election.</p>

begins freeing prisoners after US says it will lift terror
designation</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>HAVANA — Cuba started releasing some prisoners Wednesday as part of
talks with the Vatican, a day after President Joe Biden’s administration
announced his intent to lift the U.S. designation of the island nation
as a state sponsor of terrorism.</p>
<p>More than a dozen people who were convicted of different crimes — and
some of them were arrested after taking part in historic 2021 protests —
were released during the day, according to Cuban civil groups following
the cases of detainees in the island.</p>
<p>Among those freed was tattooist Reyna Yacnara Barreto Batista, 24,
who was detained in the 2021 protests and convicted to four years in
prison for attacks and public disorder. She was released from a prison
in the province of Camagüey and told The Associated Press that eight men
were freed along with her.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the Biden administration said it notified Congress of its
intent to lift the designation of Cuba as part of a deal facilitated by
the Vatican. Cuban authorities would release some of them before Biden’s
administration ends on Jan. 20, officials said.</p>
<p>Hours later, the Cuban foreign ministry said the government informed
Pope Francis it would gradually release 553 convicts as authorities
explore legal and humanitarian ways to make it happen.</p>
<p>Havana did not link the prisoners’ release to the U.S. decision on
lifting the designation but said it was “in the spirit of the Ordinary
Jubilee of the year 2025 declared by His Holiness,” referring to the
Vatican’s once-every-25-year tradition of a Jubilee, in which the
Catholic faithful make pilgrimages to Rome.</p>
<p>The Cuban Observatory of Human Rights, one of the civil groups, said
that by 4 p.m. EST, 18 people had been released, including Barreto
Batista.</p>
<p>“At three in the morning they knocked,” Barreto Batista told the AP
over the phone. “I was sleeping (in the cell) and they told me to gather
all my things, that I was free.”</p>
<p>She said that she and the eight men were warned it was not a pardon
or a forgiveness and that they had to be on good behavior or they could
be sent back to prison.</p>
<p>“I am at home with my mother,” she said. “The whole family is
celebrating.”</p>
<p>In July 2021, thousands of Cubans took to the streets to protest
widespread power outages and shortages amid a severe economic crisis.
The government’s crackdown on the demonstrators, which included arrests
and detentions, sparked international criticism, while Cuban officials
blamed U.S. sanctions and a media campaign for the unrest.</p>
<p>In November, another Cuban nongovernmental organization, Justice 11J,
said that 554 people remained in custody in connection with the
protests.</p>
<p>Biden’s intention to lift the U.S. designation of Cuba as a state
sponsor of terrorism is likely to be reversed as early as next week
after President-elect Donald Trump takes office and Secretary of
State-designate Marco Rubio assumes the position of America’s top
diplomat.</p>
<p>Rubio, whose family left Cuba in the 1950s before the communist
revolution that brought Fidel Castro to power, has long been a proponent
of sanctions on the communist island.</p>

speaker removes chairman of House Intelligence Committee</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — House Speaker Mike Johnson on Wednesday removed the
Republican chairman of the powerful House Intelligence Committee, who
was a vocal supporter of assistance for Ukraine and held other views
that put him at odds with President-elect Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Johnson told reporters late Wednesday that Representative Mike
Turner, an Ohio Republican, would no longer lead the committee, which
oversees the nation’s intelligence agencies and holds tremendous
influence over law enforcement and foreign policy. Johnson last year
also gave two Trump allies highly sought spots on the panel.</p>
<p>Johnson said he made the decision to remove Turner because the
“intelligence community and everything related to (the committee) needs
a fresh start.”</p>
<p>The Republican speaker, who has aligned himself closely with Trump,
said he would soon announce the new chairperson for the committee.</p>
<p>Johnson went on to praise Turner and say he would play an important
role in working with NATO.</p>
<p>Turner’s stances on foreign policy had run afoul of the incoming
president, who will take the White House next week with a vision of
reshaping the federal government’s intelligence and law enforcement
capabilities.</p>
<p>Turner last year also pushed back on Trump’s false claims that
Haitian migrants in his Ohio district were eating pets.</p>
<p>His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

id="trumps-pick-to-lead-cia-promises-more-focus-firmer-posture">Trump’s
pick to lead CIA promises more focus, firmer posture</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to lead the CIA
signaled substantial changes are in store for America’s premier spy
agency, telling lawmakers that it must be more aggressive both in
collecting intelligence and pushing back against Washington’s
adversaries.</p>
<p>John Ratcliffe, who served as director of national intelligence at
the end of Trump’s first term, told the Senate Intelligence Committee
during his confirmation hearing Wednesday that the CIA’s human
intelligence collection capability “isn’t where it needs to be.”</p>
<p>“We will collect intelligence, especially human intelligence, in
every corner of the globe no matter how dark or difficult,” Ratcliffe
said of his plans for the spy agency, should he be confirmed.</p>
<p>“We will conduct covert actions at the direction of the president,
going places no one else can go and doing things no one else can do,” he
added.</p>
<p>Ratcliffe promised the CIA would deliver insights and information
free of personal and political bias, and said that if confirmed, he
would hold accountable employees and analysts who fail to perform up to
standard and eliminate programs that shift focus from the CIA’s key
responsibilities.</p>
<p>“If you have a politically motivated, bureaucratically imposed social
justice agenda that takes up part of your attention, that can distract
from the core mission of collecting human intelligence that matter and
providing it to you in a timely way,” he said.</p>
<p>“To the brave CIA officers listening around the world, if all of this
sounds like what you signed up for, then buckle up and get ready to make
a difference,” Ratcliffe said. “If it doesn’t, then it’s time to find a
new line of work.”</p>
<p>Republican approval</p>
<p>Ratcliffe’s comments were met with approval from Senate Intelligence
Committee Republicans, who praised his experience and his plans to
refocus the CIA.</p>
<p>“The CIA needs to get back to its roots,” said committee chairman Tom
Cotton. “Stealing secrets.”</p>
<p>“The nation needs a strong, capable and aggressive CIA,” Cotton said,
calling Ratcliffe the right man for the job.</p>
<p>“I believe the men and women you will lead want to serve in just that
kind of agency. They joined the CIA after all, not a church choir or a
therapy session,” he added.</p>
<p>Democrats on the committee were, at times, more skeptical, asking
Ratcliffe for assurances that officers and analysts will not be
subjected to political loyalty tests.</p>
<p>“Mr. Ratcliffe today is your opportunity to reassure the men and
women of the CIA that they [need] not fear reprisal for speaking truth
to power — the most critical role of the IC [intelligence community],”
said Democrat Mark Warner, the committee’s vice chair.</p>
<p>“I need your commitment that you will not fire or force out CIA
employees because of their perceived political views, and that you will
not ask these employees to place loyalty to a political figure above
loyalty to country,” he said.</p>
<p>Ratcliffe responded, assuring lawmakers that he would not oversee a
purge of the agency.</p>
<p>CIA role</p>
<p>“If you look at my record, and my record as DNI, that never took
place,” Ratcliffe said. “That’s not something anyone has alleged and
something I would ever do.”</p>
<p>Other lawmakers raised concerns about Trump’s history of mistrust of
the CIA and other U.S. intelligence agencies, fueled in part by U.S.
intelligence assessments that Russia sought to intervene in the 2016
U.S. presidential election to help Trump win.</p>
<p>“It seems to me you have an initial task that’s a little unusual but
also very important, and that is to restore the confidence of the
president-elect in the intelligence community,” said Senator Angus King,
an independent.</p>
<p>“You need to get him to a place where he does have confidence in the
judgments that are coming to him,” King added.</p>
<p>Ratcliffe said that was likely why he was chosen to lead the CIA.</p>
<p>“I think one of the reasons I have this opportunity for you all to
consider me for confirmation is because President Trump knows and wants
me to lead with integrity,” he told the committee.</p>
<p>Still, some former U.S. intelligence officials have taken a dim view
of Ratcliffe’s qualifications to lead the spy agency despite his time as
the nation’s top intelligence official.</p>
<p>Lingering doubts</p>
<p>“As DNI, Ratcliffe repeatedly demonstrated that his first priority
was to advance Donald Trump’s political interests rather than to
function as an apolitical intelligence chief,” said Paul Pillar, a
former senior CIA officer who now teaches at Georgetown University.</p>
<p>As examples, Pillar pointed to Ratcliffe’s decision to release a
Russian intelligence assessment that seemed to back Trump’s allegations
about nefarious activity by his opponent in the 2016 U.S. presidential
election, Democrat Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p>Pillar also noted that Ratcliffe also shunned transparency, refusing
to attend Congress’ annual worldwide threats hearing “because the
previous year’s assessment reported facts that Trump didn’t like.”</p>
<p>“To politicize the role of CIA director in a similar manner is just
as damaging to the proper role of intelligence as politicizing the role
of DNI,” Pillar told VOA. “There is no reason to expect Ratcliffe to
perform any differently in this respect in the CIA job than he did as
DNI.”</p>
<p>But other former officials saw Ratcliffe’s performance during the
hearing Wednesday as a positive step.</p>
<p>“Ratcliffe performed well and should rightly obtain an easy
confirmation,” said Larry Pfeiffer, a former CIA chief of staff and
former senior director of the White House Situation Room.</p>
<p>“He said all the right things about the importance of analytic and
operational integrity and about the technical challenges facing CIA
today,” Pfeiffer told VOA. “More importantly, he offered assurances he
would assiduously avoid and counter politicization of the agency. … This
will be reassuring to anyone inside CIA today who is nervous about the
incoming Trump administration.”</p>
<p>Top threats</p>
<p>Ratcliffe told lawmakers the list of threats and challenges facing
the United States is long, topped by an ever more aggressive China that
is “committed to dominating the world economically, militarily and
technologically.”</p>
<p>He also cited threats from transnational criminal organizations and
drug cartels, Iran and its proxies, North Korea and multiple terror
groups.</p>
<p>And he acknowledged the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>“The Russia-Ukraine war rages on, spreading devastation and
increasing the risk of the United States being pulled into a conflict
with a nuclear power,” Ratcliffe warned.</p>
<p>But he also said that Russia, unlike China, is unable to confront the
U.S. across multiple domains at once.</p>
<p>Russia “falls into that category” of “countries that can’t compete
with the United States in terms of kinetic firepower across the board,”
Ratcliffe said.</p>
<p>“The Russians have to decide where they’re going to compete,” he
said, noting that Moscow has chosen areas like hypersonic missile
technology at the expense of overall troop readiness.</p>
<p>Ratcliffe further promised lawmakers he would ensure the CIA seeks
answers to the cause of Havana Syndrome — the name given to a series of
brain injuries and other serious health ailments that have struck
hundreds of U.S. diplomats and intelligence officials.</p>
<p>And he voiced support for maintaining controversial U.S. surveillance
authorities under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act, or FISA, calling it an indispensable tool, going as far to reject
calls to require a warrant before accessing certain communications or
data — a view that conflicts with positions previously espoused by other
Trump nominees.</p>
<p>“You’re going to need to share your experience and your wisdom with
the nominees for FBI and director of national security,” Republican
Senator John Cornyn told Ratcliffe, “because we’ve had these
conversations as well, and I think there’s some confusion.”</p>

<h2 id="what-if-kathy-hochul-is-violating-new-yorks-climate-law">What If
Kathy Hochul Is Violating New York’s Climate Law?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-15, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTYxNTI3NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4NzM4MTY1MX0.bwXmpLXK1Kd2bQ_T8J6NNeOtQS1II8OF3x1WaWVHhpE/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
When New York Governor Kathy Hochul gave her State of the State address
on Tuesday, climate advocates expected her to unveil an overdue plan to
implement and fund the state’s climate law, which was enacted in 2019.
Instead, she implied that she was delaying the plan indefinitely. In
doing so,
<a href="https://x.com/MichaelGerrard/status/1879274367039033716" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>legal
experts say Hochul would be breaking the law</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
New York has a statutory requirement to cut emissions 40% from 1990
levels by 2030, and 85% by 2050. The deadline to draw up regulations to
achieve this passed in January 2024. Hochul’s administration has been
working on a solution — a
<a href="https://capandinvest.ny.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>cap
and invest</u></a> program, which would set a limit on total greenhouse
gas emissions from the state that would decline over time and put a
price on those emissions, bringing in revenue that could be reinvested
in carbon reduction projects. The state expects decarbonization to cost
$15 billion per year by 2030, and $45 billion in 2050.
</p>
<p>
As recently as a few weeks ago, New York climate advocates were hearing
that Hochul planned to preview the program in her State of the State
address before including it in her proposed budget. “All indications
were that this was all systems go,” Justin Balik, the senior state
program director for Evergreen Action, told me.
</p>
<p>
But Hochul didn’t mention cap and invest once in her speech. Her
<a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2025-01/2025StateoftheStateBook.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>State
of the State policy book</u></a>, published Tuesday, acknowledges the
program and notes that in the coming months, her administration will
propose new emissions <em><em>reporting</em></em> regulations “while
creating more space and time for public transparency and a robust
investment planning process.” Advocates interpreted the message as a
kiss-off.
</p>
<p>
“There have to be enforceable regulations that ensure we can meet the
emission reduction mandates,” Rachel Spector, a senior attorney at
Earthjustice, told me. “Those were supposed to be in place a year ago.
Now they are late and there’s no clear date when we are getting those
regulations, and that’s a really troubling situation.”

Governments miss statutory deadlines all the time. But without any clear
timeline on when the regulations might happen, the state’s overarching
climate law could become impossible to carry out. “We have a
[presidential] administration that’s coming in that’s extremely hostile
to moving forward on climate mitigation, and is going to potentially
take us backwards,” Balik told me. “And so we need states to be the
bulwark like they were during the last Trump term.”
</p>
<p>
There are a few possibilities for what can happen next.
</p>
<p>
Michael Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change at
Columbia University, likened the situation to when Hochul tried to
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/kathy-hochul-nyc-congestion-pricing" target="_self"><u>impose
an indefinite delay</u></a> on congestion pricing in New York City last
June, just days before it was set to go into effect. “I helped
coordinate an effort that led to two lawsuits in New York state court
claiming that Hochul did not have the power to do that,” he told me in
an email. “We won the lawsuits, congestion pricing survived several
lawsuits against it, and it launched on January 5.”
</p>
<p>
Gerrard added that some of the groups involved in those suits and others
are now considering challenging Hochul’s indefinite delay of cap and
invest. The text of the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act,
which created the emissions targets, “allows citizens to bring
proceedings in state court for violations of the statute,” he said. And
there does not appear to be any pathway for achieving the targets
without cap and invest, he added.
</p>
<p>
Liz Moran, a policy advocate for Earthjustice, said that cap and invest
was never going to be enough anyway, and is urging the legislature to
make progress on sector-specific policies. She called for the state
assembly to pass the New York Heat Act, for instance, a bill that would
remove barriers to transitioning away from the use of natural gas for
home heating and set in motion a plan for mass conversion to efficient
electric heating.
</p>
<p>
Early outlines of New York’s cap and invest program indicate that
regulators were considering a relatively low price ceiling on pollution,
making it easier for companies to buy their way out of compliance with
the cap. As <em><em>New York Focus</em></em> has
<a href="https://nysfocus.com/2024/12/23/greenhouse-emissions-new-york-cap-and-trade" target="_blank"><u>reported</u></a>,
the state’s own
<a href="https://capandinvest.ny.gov/-/media/Project/CapInvest/Files/2024-01-26-NYCI-Preproposal-Analysis-Webinar.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>modeling</u></a>
shows that the program alone would not achieve the 2030 target. “Given
what the governor has outlined as the ambition of the cap and invest
program, there was always going to need to be additional sectoral
mandates or policies that come from the legislature to drive emission
reductions,” Moran told me.
</p>
<p>
In theory, the legislature could also put forward a bill outlining its
own cap and invest program. Assemblywoman Anna Kelles, from Ithaca, New
York,
<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/mem/Anna-R-Kelles/story/110444" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>introduced
a cap and invest bill</u></a> last year, though it never left the
environmental conservation committee.
</p>
<p>
Hochul spoke at length in her speech about affordability, and her
stalling of cap and invest may be related to concerns that it would
raise costs for consumers — or at least the perception that it would.
“New York needs to get the transition right and keep our state
affordable for families,” her policy book says. This would not be the
first time Hochul’s fears about the cost of climate action (and
potential backlash to it) have caused her to do an about-face. In 2023,
Hochul
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/gwp-global-warming-potential-new-york" target="_self"><u>tried
to change the way the state accounted for greenhouse gas
emissions</u></a> under the idea that it would lower the cost of
decarbonization. Her backpedaling on congestion pricing is another
example.
</p>
<p>
The state’s own analysis, however, found that cap and invest would
likely raise costs slightly for some New Yorkers while lowering them for
others. Low-income residents would be eligible for direct rebates that
would more than offset the higher cost of fuel. Depending on how the
remaining revenue is spent, it could
<a href="https://www.switch.box/nyci" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>bring
further cost reductions</u></a> by helping New Yorkers pay for energy
efficiency improvements that lower their bills.
</p>
<p>
“The governor is rightly focused on affordability, which is why
extensive consumer rebates were baked into this,” said Balik. “From our
perspective, the way that the state was planning on moving forward with
this was perfectly in line with the governor’s affordability agenda.”
</p>
<p>
The one bit of climate action Hochul did commit to on Tuesday was to
call for spending $1 billion of the next budget on climate action — the
“largest climate investment in the history of the state budget” — though
she did not say where the money would come from or where it would go.
Her State of the State book gives little more detail, noting only that
it will “span different sectors of our economy and across the state’s
geography,” with nods to clean heating and transportation projects. Cap
and invest, meanwhile, is expected to bring in $3 billion to $5 billion
in its first year.
</p>
<p>
“It’s a start,” Spector said of the $1 billion. “But it’s definitely not
enough.”

id="scoop-the-draft-order-that-offshore-wind-opponents-sent-to-trump">Scoop:
The Draft Order that Offshore Wind Opponents Sent to Trump</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-15, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTYzMDU1Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0Nzg3NzM3Nn0.r7dEjhffh9Umab6QopWDGdoKQZbVpKj-vSiM7y4Mb8I/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Major groups in the anti-offshore wind movement are going big,
submitting a lengthy policy wish list to the Trump transition team,
according to documents obtained and first reported by Heatmap News.
</p>
<p>
Key organizations in the movement against offshore wind submitted a
draft executive order “on the suspension of offshore wind development”
to the transition team. According to the draft, not only are activists
asking for a pause on new permits for offshore wind but also for a
stop-work order on all projects currently under construction. They’re
also asking for the Health and Human Services Department to become a
weapon against the growth of renewable energy, requesting studies into
the health and environmental effects of wind turbines and transmission
cables.
</p>
<p>
If the Trump team follows through on even some of the ideas in the draft
executive order, it would be a huge win for a nascent anti-renewables
uprising in America. It would also be a harbinger of pain to come for
wind energy in America under Trump. At the very least, it shows
activists believe the next president has many powers at his disposal to
make offshore wind developers’ lives miserable.
</p>
<p>
Mandy Davis, president of REACT Alliance, told Heatmap it had submitted
the draft executive order to the transition team, and that REACT was the
primary group behind the document. Davis is also head of the National
Offshore-Wind Opposition Alliance, a new country-wide coalition of local
groups opposed to offshore wind.
</p>
<p>
Davis said the draft order demonstrates the myriad ways she thinks the
incoming administration can curtail wind development beyond a pause on
new permits. “Our role is going to be determined to a great degree by
what our new administration is doing,” she told Heatmap. “We also have
to be really, really cognizant of the fact that even though the federal
government is going to put major monkey wrenches in the works … it’s
going to take a while.”
</p>
<p>
We’re still watching and waiting to see if Trump follows through with
his promise to stop offshore wind in its tracks on Day 1. New Jersey
Republican congressman Jeff Van Drew
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/offshore-wind-ban-order" target="_self"><u>said
in a statement Monday</u></a> that Trump’s team is working with his
office to draft an order that “halt[s] offshore wind turbine activities”
on the East Coast and the “proposed order” is “expected to be finalized
within the first few months of the administration.”
</p>
<p>
It is worth noting that Van Drew is one of the anti-offshore wind’s
<a href="https://vandrew.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=479" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>favorite
allies</u></a> in Congress. But it is unclear to what extent – if any –
that the activists’ draft executive order obtained by Heatmap is winding
up in the product Van Drew and his staff are working on with the Trump
team. Representatives for Van Drew’s office did not immediately respond
to a request for comment about the draft executive order.
</p>
<p>
It’s hard to fathom the extent of damage even a work stoppage order
would have on the American offshore wind industry. Roughly 5.8 gigawatts
of electricity capacity are under construction offshore and more than 8
gigawatts of projects have been fully permitted but haven’t begun
construction, according to data shared with Heatmap News that was
compiled by Christian Roselund, a policy analyst seasoned in the
renewables industry. At least 10 gigawatts of additional capacity is
currently in the federal review process and would be stymied by a halt
at the permitting level. Taken together, the proposals in the draft
could take millions of homes’ worth of carbon-free electricity off the
table indefinitely.
</p>
<p>
A source within the offshore wind industry who requested anonymity to
speak candidly said, if enacted, the proposals in the draft executive
order would “lay off thousands of Americans” and potentially lead to
work stoppages in other links in the industry’s supply chain, like
shipyards in Louisiana and steel plants in the Midwest.
</p>
<p>
Jason Ryan, a spokesperson from American Clean Power, provided Heatmap a
statement after initial publication of this story: “Executive orders
restricting offshore wind energy undermine U.S. national security and
job growth. Energy dominance requires a true ‘all of the above energy’
approach that unleashes our nation’s diverse resources to meet surging
demand.”
</p>
<p>
<strong>What’s in the draft order? </strong>
</p>
<p>
In addition to pausing permits, the draft executive order calls on the
incoming administration to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Conduct a full-government review</strong> of all offshore wind
projects previously approved by the federal government “for
reconsideration” based on their impacts to national security, aviation
safety, grid stability, biodiversity, and a host of other factors.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Issue a “stop-work order” </strong>on all permitted offshore
wind projects in construction until that review is completed.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Instruct</strong> <strong>each branch of the military to
independently assess</strong> if offshore wind projects impact their
operations.<br/>
</li>
<li>
Require the Treasury Department to conduct rulemaking activity to
<strong>exclude offshore wind projects from any existing tax
credits</strong> possible under the Inflation Reduction Act “pending a
comprehensive review.”<br/>
</li>
<li>
Compel the Commerce, Energy, and Interior Departments to each
<strong>conduct studies evaluating the economic impacts</strong> of
offshore wind, and require the Energy and Transportation Departments to
<strong>suspend federal grants and loans</strong> to projects related to
offshore wind, including port upgrades and grid alterations.<br/>
</li>
<li>
Make the Justice Department <strong>“reevaluate its current defense of
lawsuits</strong> related to offshore wind projects” and direct the
agency “to<strong> pursue settlement discussions</strong> in cases where
it is legally and ethically appropriate.” (Note: This is something
consultants have previously advised developers could happen under
Trump.)<br/>
</li>
<li>
Get the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration to do a
“<strong>comprehensive overhaul” of its process for reviewing and
approving commercial activities</strong> within habitat for species
protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act.<br/>
</li>
<li>
Order the Health and Human Services Department to <strong>commission a
study on the effects of electromagnetic fields, infrasound and plastic
pollution</strong> from offshore wind projects on human and animal
health, as well as the safety of commercial seafood. It calls for a
separate HHS <strong>study into the impacts of bisphenol A, or
BPA,</strong> that activists claim they fear could leach from offshore
wind turbine components into the ocean.<br/>
</li>
<li>
Request for an Office of Management and Budget <strong>audit of any and
all federal funding to universities and research institutions</strong>
related to offshore wind.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
According to emails and other documents reviewed by Heatmap, the draft
executive order also involved the work of Lisa Quattrocki Knight,
president of the Rhode Island anti-offshore wind organization Green
Oceans and a board member of the National Offshore-Wind Opposition
Alliance.
</p>
<p>
Along with the draft executive order, Heatmap obtained other documents
with Green Oceans’ letterhead addressed to the incoming administration,
calling on it to “justify removing all permitted wind farm projects off
the eastern coast of the U.S.” under multiple potential legal
authorities including the National Emergencies Act, the Defense
Production Act, and Federal Power Act.
</p>
<p>
Knight did not respond to requests for an interview. A spokesperson for
Green Oceans contacted by Heatmap confirmed the organization played a
role in crafting the draft executive order and provided a statement that
the “draft Executive Order was developed as part of our broader efforts
to provide science-based, actionable recommendations to decision-makers,
regardless of political affiliation.”
</p>
<p>
“We believe that meaningful environmental progress requires bipartisan
cooperation, and we remain committed to working with all leaders who
share our vision of a sustainable future,” the statement read.
</p>
<p>
The documents also show the draft was endorsed by key groups fighting
offshore wind in the New Jersey and New York region, including Protect
Our Coast Long Island and Save the East Coast, as well as local
opposition groups based on the West Coast and in New England. Many of
these organizations will be participating in

id="trumps-pick-for-top-diplomat-calls-for-ceasefire-in-russias-war-on-ukraine">Trump’s
pick for top diplomat calls for ceasefire in Russia’s war on
Ukraine</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Russia’s nearly three-year invasion of Ukraine has become a “war of
attrition” and a “stalemate” that must be ended, Senator Marco Rubio,
President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to be secretary of state, told
senators at his confirmation hearing on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Rubio broke from the passive stance of the administration of outgoing
President Joe Biden, which has said it was up to Kyiv to decide under
what terms it would be open to peace talks with Moscow. In the meantime,
the U.S., along with its European allies, has continued to send billions
of dollars of armaments to Ukraine to continue the fight.</p>
<p>Rubio instead said the first step in ending the war should be a
ceasefire that halts ground fighting, which has for more than a year
mostly occurred in eastern Ukraine. However, ongoing fighting is also
raging in Russia’s Kursk region, which Ukraine captured in August, even
as Moscow has attempted to retake it with the help of North Korean
troops.</p>
<p>Both countries also target each other daily with aerial strikes,
drones and missiles, with thousands of Ukrainian civilians killed in the
Russian attacks, along with vast numbers of both countries’ troops.</p>
<p>“This war has to end,” he said at his confirmation hearing before the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee.</p>
<p>Rubio called the destruction in Ukraine “extraordinary,” saying it
will “take a generation to rebuild.”</p>
<p>But even as he argued for a negotiated settlement to end the fighting
that started with Russia’s invasion in February 2022, Rubio said it was
unlikely that there would be much change in the current battle lines.
Russia currently holds about a fifth of the internationally recognized
Ukrainian land mass.</p>
<p>“The truth of the matter is that in this conflict, there is no way
Russia takes all of Ukraine,” Rubio said. “It’s also unrealistic to
believe that somehow, a nation the size of Ukraine, no matter how
incompetent and no matter how much damage the Russian Federation has
suffered as a result of this invasion, there’s no way Ukraine is also
going to push these people all the way back to where they were on the
eve of the invasion.”</p>
<p>Democrats, and some Republicans on the committee, continued to voice
their support for more military aid to Ukraine, saying it was important
to give Kyiv leverage in any eventual peace talks with Moscow.</p>
<p>But Rubio said that one of Ukraine’s key problems was not a shortage
of ammunition or money but its inability to train and recruit enough
troops.</p>
<p>“The problem that Ukraine is facing is not that they’re running out
of money, [it] is that they’re running out of Ukrainians,” he said.</p>
<p>Trump has voiced skepticism of continued U.S. military support for
Kyiv and repeatedly vowed that he would end the war before he assumed
the presidency on Jan. 20.</p>
<p>In recent days, his aides have said the new timeline is ending the
war in the first 100 days of his administration, which would be by the
end of April.</p>
<p>On the battlefront, officials in western Ukraine said Wednesday that
a Russian missile attack hit critical infrastructure facilities in the
Lviv region, part of a series of attacks that President Volodymyr
Zelenskyy said included more than 40 missiles and 70 drones.</p>
<p>Zelenskyy said Russia’s targets included “gas and energy facilities
that sustain normal life for our people,” but that Ukrainian air
defenses shot down 30 of the missiles.</p>
<p>“Thanks to our air defense forces and all involved units, we’ve
managed to maintain the functionality of our energy system,” Zelenskyy
said. “However, we must continue strengthening the capabilities of
Ukraine’s air shield. Promises made by partners at the NATO summit in
Washington and within the Ramstein format still remain partially
unfulfilled.”</p>
<p>Ukraine’s military issued air alerts for regions across the country
Wednesday, while the national power grid operator instituted power cuts
in six regions.</p>
<p>Cherkasy Governor Ihor Taburets said on Telegram that Russian forces
attacked overnight with drones and missiles, with fragments from
destroyed drones damaging two houses.</p>
<p>In Dnipropetrovsk, Governor Serhiy Lysak said on Telegram that
Russian attacks included artillery, drones and missiles that damaged an
industrial site.</p>
<p>Kirovohrad Governor Andriy Raikovich reported on Telegram what he
described as a massive Russian drone attack that damaged several
residential buildings.</p>
<p>Officials in the Rivne region also said Russian missiles targeted the
area overnight.</p>
<p>Russia’s Defense Ministry said it destroyed two Ukrainian drones over
the Belgorod area and another drone over the Tambov region.</p>
<p>Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Telegram that Ukrainian
attacks injured one person, while Tambov Governor Yevgeny Pervyshov
reported damage to a house.</p>
<p>Some information for this story came from Reuters.</p>

<h2 id="takeaways-from-chris-wrights-confirmation-hearing">3 Takeaways
From Chris Wright’s Confirmation Hearing</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-15, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTYyMzgwMS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2MzM5MDAxNn0.d_k0kNt4xy3tl5hB4LzgxI0-lZjvBA9AO4fOtNFUtm0/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
With Donald Trump due to take office in less than a week and a
Republican Congress already sworn in, much of the Biden administration’s
effort to advance clean and especially renewable energy is now in doubt.
The fate of the Inflation Reduction Act is likely to be a major
flashpoint — and yet the confirmation hearing for Chris Wright, a
literal fracking executive, for Secretary of Energy proved to be
relatively low-key and collegial among senators from both parties.
</p>
<p>
Here are three takeaways from the day’s proceedings:
</p>
<h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Wright is essentially a shoo-in for the job</li>
</ol>
</h3>
<p>
Wright is not one of Trump’s more controversial nominees, so it’s no
surprise that his hearing went smoothly — and that Wright was introduced
by his fellow Coloradan, Democratic Senator
<a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/qa/senator-john-hickenlooper-permitting-reform-ira" target="_self"><u>John
Hickenlooper</u></a>, was an early strong signal that will likely pass
through confirmation with ease. To the extent there were any fireworks,
they came not from the legislators on the dais but rather from several
quickly muffled protests in the hearing room. One protester shouted,
“I’m 18 years old and I want a future!” before being removed, while
another one yelled, “Will your fracking liquid put out fires in L.A.?”
</p>
<p>
The questioning before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural
Resources was a mix of parochial concerns from senators about their own
states — the committee’s ranking Democrat, Martin Heinrich, for
instance, asked if Wright would visit Sandia and Los Alamos National
Laboratories, located in his home state of New Mexico, while
Pennsylvania Senator David McCormick, a Republican, asked about the
prospects of a liquefied natural gas export terminal in Pennsylvania.
</p>
<p>
That’s not to say climate change didn’t come up. Wright repeatedly
avowed that climate change is happening and is caused by the combustion
of hydrocarbons, although he demurred that it was a “global” problem and
turned his responses repeatedly to developing energy resources in the
United States.
</p>
<p>
“If you shut down industry, those emissions don’t go away, they go
somewhere else,” Wright claimed. “The only pathway to reduce greenhouse
gas emissions and improve quality of life is energy innovation.”
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Everyone in the room could agree on geothermal (and nuclear)</li>
</ol>
</h3>
<p>
Wright generally stayed away from specifics on spending levels or
individual programs, aside from expressing generalized enthusiasm for
the Department of Energy’s network of national laboratories and the
importance of its work maintaining the nuclear stockpile. In his opening
statement, he identified one of his goals as to “unleash American energy
at home and abroad to restore energy dominance.”
</p>
<p>
Over the course of the hearing, what he meant became at least marginally
clearer. Under questioning from McCormick about the Department’s Office
of Fossil Energy — renamed the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon
Management under outgoing President Joe Biden and Energy Secretary
Jennifer Granholm — Wright lamented that fossil fuel had “fallen out of
fashion and out of favor. There’s less interest in investing in it and
less interest in talking about it,” he said, before declaring, “I don’t
share that aversion.”
</p>
<p>
He did, however, expressed enthusiasm for certain clean energy
technologies, including next-generation geothermal (“It’s an enormous,
abundant energy resource below our feet”) and nuclear power. He also
went along with Democratic senators who asked about reforms to existing
federal permitting regulations to facilitate the buildout of
long-distance energy transmission, a focus of the last Congress’s failed
permitting reform bill and a
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/permitting-bill-manchin-barrasso-westerman" target="_self"><u>key
precursor</u></a> to cleaning up the grid. (Nuclear and geothermal are
also two areas where Wright’s company, Liberty Energy, has investments.)
</p>
<p>
To the extent Wright was willing to talk about solar — there was barely
any mention of wind in the entire hearing — he had to be prodded by
Democrats in sun-rich states, such as Heinrich and Nevada’s Catherine
Cortez Masto. Wright also called into question some estimates of how
cheap renewables are, arguing that a popular measure for comparing
energy resources with each other, the levelized cost of energy, “misses
the boat on electricity generation because it’s like, would you take
Uber that was 10% cheaper in cost if you didn’t know when the Uber would
pick you up or where it would drop you off?” essentially arguing that
the low price of energy generated by renewables doesn’t take into
account their unavailability during certain times of day or in certain
weather conditions.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>It’s hard to dislike an Energy Secretary</li>
</ol>
</h3>
<p>
Wright’s relatively easy reception reflects the fact that there actually
are wide areas of bipartisan agreement on the kind of energy research
and technology development work the Department of Energy does. Members
on both sides of the aisle saw their enthusiasm for nuclear power —
especially small modular reactors — reflected back by Wright, with
Arizona Democrat Ruben Gallego saying “I appreciate your enthusiasm for
nuclear energy.”
</p>
<p>
The Energy and Natural Resources Committee is also stocked with Senators
who represent states where the DOE has a substantial presence, including
New Mexico, California, Utah, Idaho, Colorado, and Washington, which can
lead to more collegial hearings if the nominee, as Wright does, affirms
the importance and value of the Department’s national laboratories.

But Wright is just the first nominee for a major energy and environment
related post to face the Senate. Other nominees, including Doug Burgum
for Secretary of the Interior and Lee Zeldin for Environmental
Protection Agency administrator, may endure more contentious hearings,
as they will likely face questions on issues that are sharply divisive,
like opening up public lands for fossil fuel extraction and rules on
power plant and tailpipe emissions.

Is Giving Cash to L.A. Fire Victims, No Questions Asked</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-15, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTU5MDcyMC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczNzQ0MjUxNH0.NXYDaw2rEkIWsQRjUmwF5z3PKPrM5chSQhy9oiG6_DU/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Whether they’re dealing with fires like the ones ravaging Los Angeles or
hurricanes like those that wreaked havoc in Florida and North Carolina
just a few months ago, when natural disasters lay waste to homes and
towns, what low-income residents often need most is quick cash. That,
however, can be difficult to come by. Insurance companies can take
months or even years to fully resolve claims. The Federal Emergency
Management Agency requires significant documentation before it will
offer relief, and often
<a href="https://www.dailynews.com/2025/01/10/getting-aid-for-fire-damage-calls-for-patience-federal-official-says/" target="_blank"><u>denies
victims</u></a> with no explanation.
</p>
<p>
The nonprofit GiveDirectly is trying to circumvent all this maddening
complexity, working with
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/q-and-a-google-maps-yael-maguire" target="_self"><u>Google</u></a>
to overlay government data on things like median income and food stamp
enrollment with damage data gleaned from satellite imagery and local
incident reports to get cash in the hands of those who need it most —
quickly. After a disaster, low-income residents in especially hard-hit
areas are automatically deemed eligible for aid, no opt-in necessary.
They’ll get a notification on their phone that they qualify for a direct
cash transfer, and can enroll in a matter of minutes, with no additional
documentation required.
</p>
<p>
“Especially as disasters become more prevalent and more severe, having a
way to pre-verify vulnerable populations — to get people resources as
quickly as possible — becomes so valuable,” Laura Keen, GiveDirectly’s
U.S. program director, told me. As she explained, cash is often more
useful than “in kind” donations such as clothing or food, as it allows
recipients to prioritize specific needs and reduces barriers associated
with government-run disaster programs. “You have to have the means and
the know-how and the language abilities to apply for that assistance,”
Keen said. Still,
<a href="https://devinit.org/resources/falling-short-humanitarian-funding-reform/cash-voucher-assistance/#:~:text=Humanitarian%20CVA%20continued%20to%20grow,compared%20to%2022%25%20in%202022." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>over
75% of global humanitarian assistance</u></a> is in-kind.
</p>
<p>
GiveDirectly
<a href="https://www.givedirectly.org/lafires/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>set
up its fundraising campaign</u></a> for L.A. fire victims on January 10,
and is thus far over 40% of the way to its $1 million dollar goal. While
the fundraiser won’t officially close for another 25 days, Keen said the
organization plans to send out its first payments “as soon as next
week.” While GiveDirectly has yet to finalize amounts, it estimates that
recipients will get on the order of $3,000 to $4,000 — significantly
more than the nonprofit gave to victims of Hurricane Ian in 2022 or
Hurricanes Helene and Milton last year. That’s because with these fires,
“the damage has been so severe, and we expect people are going to be
facing temporary housing costs for a matter of months,” Keen explained.
For a campaign like this, Keen said she expects about 88 cents out of
every dollar donated to go directly to affected individuals and
families, the same efficiency rate as the organization’s Helene and
Milton campaign. That remaining 12 cents will go towards transaction
fees, offices, and staff.
</p>
<p>
If these rapid payouts remind you of
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/los-angeles-fires-kettle-insurance" target="_self"><u>parametric
insurance</u></a>, you’re on the right track. Parametric insurance also
exists to get cash quickly into the hands of those who have experienced
disaster, without the need for damage audits. But as is implied by the
word “insurance,” it is also an opt-in service that involves the payment
of monthly premiums. GiveDirectly’s cash comes out of the blue, free and
clear.
</p>
<p>
To get the actual money out the door, GiveDirectly works with
<a href="https://www.propel.app/" target="_blank">Propel</a>, an app for
low-income households to manage government benefits such as SNAP food
stamps. GiveDirectly tells Propel what areas its mapping tool has honed
in on, and Propel sends out an alert to users in these zones, notifying
them that they’re eligible to receive money. Individuals then complete a
brief survey confirming their contact information, preferred language,
and signing some consent notices.
</p>
<p>
“The last response that we did in western North Carolina and in Florida
last fall, it took them, on average, 68 seconds to complete that
enrollment form,” Keen told me. The last time she looked at the data,
there were about 2,300 households using Propel in the impacted areas of
L.A., a number that’s only growing as the largest fires remain
uncontained. Once people enroll, they can expect to receive money
directly to their debit accounts within three days.
</p>
<p>
While quick and simple, this strategy is far from comprehensive. Only
about one in four households that receive SNAP benefits has the Propel
app. And those that do may not open it regularly, meaning they could
miss the alert that they qualify for cash. For Propel users who see the
notification, Keen said, enrollment is above 80%, while overall user
enrollment is much lower — around 40%. “But typically, we have more
Propel users than we have funds,” Keen explained. Basically, it wouldn’t
actually be possible to give the target amounts to everyone who meets
the criteria. Rather, the strategy is to get money out as quickly as
possible, knowing full well there’ll be many who are missed. Plus,
relying on Propel makes the whole system safe from fraud (something
GiveDirectly has
<a href="https://www.givedirectly.org/drc-case-2023/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>dealt
with in the past</u></a>), as Propel users have already verified their
eligibility for government benefits. “So we just have very high
confidence in who we’re supporting,” Keen told me.
</p>
<p>
Domestic disaster relief was not initially on the agenda for
GiveDirectly, which was started in 2008 by a group of econ grad students
at Harvard and MIT as a way to get money into the hands of some of the
poorest people in the developing world. Since the organization began
accepting public donations in 2011, it’s mostly retained this
international focus, making its first foray into domestic cash transfers
in 2017, when it provided physical debit cards to victims of Hurricane
Harvey in Texas.
</p>
<p>
“At that time, we had pretty rudimentary targeting,” Keen told me. “We
would just drive to different areas, talk with as many people as we
could, visually look for signs of damage, try to source any open source
information where we could, and then overlay that with administrative
data.” Since then, the company has integrated artificial intelligence
into its hurricane relief efforts, training algorithms to generate
damage assessments for thousands or even millions of structures. But
fire damage is much more uniform (if a house burns, it’s usually 100%
destroyed) and easy to identify from satellite imagery alone, Keen
explained.
</p>
<p>
If GiveDirectly exceeds its fundraising target in L.A., however, it may
run out of eligible residents who are reachable via the Propel app,
meaning the organization will need to go back to basics: establish an
in-person presence in the city., enroll people onsite, and hand out
debit cards once more. “Right now our goal is to get to $1 million, and
then all of that we can deliver via Propel,” Keen told me. “But if we
exceed that, we would definitely explore other options.”

imposes export controls on biotech equipment over AI security
concerns</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>On Wednesday the U.S. Department of Commerce announced it would
implement new export controls on certain biotechnology equipment, citing
national security concerns relating to artificial intelligence and data
science.</p>
<p>The Commerce Department warned that China could use the biotech
equipment’s technology to bolster its military capabilities and help
design new weapons using artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>The department said the technology has many applications, including
its ability to be used for “human performance enhancement, brain-machine
interfaces, biologically inspired synthetic materials and possibly
biological weapons.”</p>
<p>The sanctions effectively restrict shipments of the technology to
countries without a U.S. license, such as China.</p>
<p>The controls apply to parameter flow cytometers and certain mass
spectrometry equipment, which according to the Commerce Department, can
“generate high-quality, high-content biological data, including that
which is suitable for use to facilitate the development of AI and
biological design tools.”</p>
<p>Last week, the Chinese Embassy in Washington said Beijing “firmly
opposes any country’s development, possession or use of biological
weapons.”</p>
<p>This latest move by the United States follows recent policy decisions
that reflect Washington’s broad aim to limit Beijing’s access to U.S.
technology and data.</p>
<p>Washington announced on Monday that it would tighten Beijing’s access
to AI chip and technology exports by implementing new regulations that
cap the number of chips that can be exported to certain countries,
including China, Russia, Iran and North Korea.</p>
<p>This month, the ban on popular Chinese-owned social media TikTok is
planned to go into effect due to U.S. concerns over its potential to
share sensitive data with China’s government.</p>

‘TikTok Refugees’ migrate to another Chinese app as ban looms</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>TAIPEI, TAIWAN — As TikTok’s Sunday deadline to divest or face a U.S.
ban approaches, hundreds of thousands of American users of the popular
social media video app say they are migrating to another Chinese social
media app, Xiaohongshu, or RedNote.</p>
<p>Dubbing themselves “TikTok Refugees,” some say they are making the
move in search of a new home; others say their exodus is a form of
protest against the ban.</p>
<p>With just days to go before the deadline, users are facing growing
uncertainty as they wait for a ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court on
whether the ban will be upheld. Reports are now suggesting that TikTok
may just shut down its operations in the United States if the ban goes
through.</p>
<p>“Our government is out of their mind if they think we are going to
stand for this TikTok ban,” said American user Heather Roberts in one
video on Xiaohongshu. “We are just going to a new Chinese app and here
we are.”</p>
<p>Sky Bynum, an 18-year-old makeup content creator in the eastern state
of New Jersey, told VOA that she is joining Xiaohongshu because she
wants to find another social media site with a sense of community.</p>
<p>“The best thing about TikTok is the community on there,” Bynum told
VOA in a video interview via Zoom. “When I posted my first few makeup
videos, TikTok pushed them to the makeup people and I instantly found my
community. I think [the potential ban on TikTok] is awful because I’m
not going to have the same thing that I had on TikTok.</p>
<p>“Xiaohongshu is really cool because a lot of TikTok users were trying
to find new communities on Xiaohongshu,” Bynum added.</p>
<p>Founded in 2013, Xiaohongshu is similar to Instagram and Pinterest.
It currently has around 300 million users, most of them in China, and is
widely used to share travel tips, makeup tutorials, and fashion
trends.</p>
<p>The name literally means “little red book” but the company says it’s
not a reference to former Chinese Communist Party leader Mao Zedong’s
collection of sayings.</p>
<p>Downloads surge</p>
<p>With many promoting and talking about their exodus to Xiaohongshu on
“TikTok Refugees,” Xiaohongshu became the most downloaded app on Apple’s
U.S. App Store this week.</p>
<p>More than 700,000 new users have joined Xiaohongshu this week,
according to Reuters. Downloads of the app rose more than 200%
year-over-year this week, according to app data research firm Sensor
Tower.</p>
<p>With more American users expected to join Xiaohongshu, some Chinese
users recorded English tutorials or welcome videos for American
users.</p>
<p>“I guess [there has] never been a lifetime or history time [that] a
platform has Chinese and Americans come together and have direct views.
So welcome and we respect you,” Zhou Shu-Fu, a Chinese Xiaohongshu user
from the southwestern province of Sichuan, said in a video released on
Jan. 15.</p>
<p>Compared to Chinese social media users’ enthusiasm, the Chinese
government offered a more cautious comment on the influx of American
TikTok users to Xiaohongshu, describing the phenomenon as a “personal
choice.”</p>
<p>“China has always supported and encouraged strengthening cultural
exchanges and promoting mutual understanding among the peoples of all
countries,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said during
the regular press conference on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The influx of American users has also prompted Xiaohongshu to build
Chinese-English translation tools and hire English content moderators,
according to the Reuters news agency and Chinese media outlets. Most of
the posts on the app are in Chinese and RedNote does not have an
auto-translate function.</p>
<p>Some American users tell VOA that their interactions with Chinese
users are helping to increase their curiosity about China.</p>
<p>“My experience on RedNote makes me realize how toxic American social
media has gotten and I’m excited to learn some basic Chinese and learn
about what it’s really like in China,” Kia Epley, a 44-year-old engineer
from Las Vegas, told VOA in a video interview.</p>
<p>TikTok content creators say they are looking for more than just a
safe and welcoming community. One key concern for them is how they can
keep making a living on social media.</p>
<p>“Most of my income is made on TikTok so if the ban comes into effect,
a big chunk of my income will get taken away,” said Essence Whitaker, a
28-year-old makeup content producer in Michigan.</p>
<p>“A lot of content creators in the U.S. will be unemployed,” she told
VOA in a video interview.</p>
<p>VOA reached out to TikTok for comment on the exodus but has yet to
receive a response.</p>
<p>Tech media The Information reported on Tuesday that TikTok plans to
shut the app for American users when the federal ban comes into effect
on Sunday, citing anonymous sources with knowledge of the matter.</p>
<p>Trend or temporary protest?</p>
<p>While the migration of American users to Xiaohongshu continues, some
users say it remains unclear whether the exodus is a temporary
phenomenon or a long-term trend. TikTok has more than 170 million users
and so far, less than a million have moved over to Xiaohongshu.</p>
<p>“I don’t think the move to Xiaohongshu is going to be long-term
because the biggest thing that creators worry about is monetization.
Xiaohongshu doesn’t have that feature so I think other creators are
still looking for an alternative to TikTok,” Bynum in New Jersey told
VOA.</p>
<p>But others say similarities between TikTok and Xiaohongshu may help
convince some American users to stay on the Chinese app.</p>
<p>“I like how real TikTok is because you get to see people’s natural
reactions,” said Whitaker in Michigan, adding that Xiaohongshu has that
same vibe.</p>
<p>“While I can’t tell whether people are going to stay on the app or
not, I think the authenticity of the content will keep some users on
there,” she told VOA in a video interview.</p>
<p>While many American users are excited about the prospect of
Xiaohongshu being an alternative to TikTok, some analysts describe the
mass migration as “going from the frying pan into the fire.”</p>
<p>“TikTok is owned by a Chinese company but it has international
operations, which means there are theoretically several layers between
TikTok and the Chinese Party-State,” said Bethany Allen, the head of
China Investigations and Analysis at the Australian Strategic Policy
Institute.</p>
<p>But “there are no layers of insulation between Xiaohongshu and
Beijing,” she told VOA by phone, adding that issues such as political
censorship or lack of data privacy protection could be “far worse” on
Xiaohongshu than TikTok.</p>
<p>American users “are going to have absolutely no power to pressure
Xiaohongshu as a company to do anything,” Allen added.</p>
<p>VOA has reached out to Xiaohongshu for comment but has yet to receive
a response.</p>
<p>And despite the friendly interactions between Chinese and American
users on Xiaohongshu over the last few days, experts said the “honeymoon
period” may not last long.</p>
<p>“I think the Chinese government is probably going to get spooked [by
the interaction between American users and Chinese users],” Sarah Cook,
an independent China analyst, told VOA by phone.</p>
<p>She added that Beijing could impose a temporary shutdown on
Xiaohongshu to implement some moderation or initiate “a mass cleanout”
of accounts or content deemed inappropriate or sensitive on the app.</p>

House says Biden leaving Ukraine in strongest position possible</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>While U.S. President Joe Biden views his response to Russia’s
invasion of Ukraine as a cornerstone of his foreign policy legacy,
critics argue he missed a historic opportunity to help Ukraine win the
war. </p>
<p>Michael Carpenter, director for Europe at the National Security
Council, spoke with VOA, defending the administration’s policies on
Ukraine, stating they were undeterred by Russia’s nuclear threats, and
attributing Ukraine’s lack of success in regaining lost territories to
manpower shortages. </p>
<p>The following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.
 </p>
<p>VOA: Is President Biden leaving Ukraine in the strongest position
possible?  </p>
<p>Michael Carpenter, Senior Director for Europe at the National
Security Council: He is. Look, the United States has given Ukraine every
capability militarily that they have asked for. We have secured through
painstaking diplomacy with our G7 partners a $50 billion loan. We have
lifted all restrictions on rules of engagement for our military systems,
for our weapons that we have provided to Ukraine. And we have worked
with the Ukrainian military and the Ukrainian leadership to devise a
strategy for them to be able to defend themselves and ideally negotiate
from a position of strength where they can achieve their aims to
maintain a sovereign, independent, democratic Ukraine. That’s always
been our goal and it remains our goal. I fail to mention the sanctions
and the costs that we have levied on the Russian Federation.
Unprecedented sanctions in the energy sector and in the financial sector
over the course of the last three months. So were handing things off, I
think, on very good terms.  </p>
<p>VOA: Does it mean that Ukraine, in your view, is ready to enter any
possible negotiations with Russia next year from the position of
strength?  </p>
<p>Carpenter: Well, look, I think it’s very important that Ukraine’s
leaders, that President Zelensky in particular, decide when he wants to
negotiate with the Russians. And what I will say is, at this point in
time, I do not assess the President Putin wants to enter into a
negotiation on good faith on anything other than the terms for the
capitulation of Ukraine. So Ukraine has to decide when it feels that it
is empowered to enter into this negotiation. And it’ll be up to the next
administration to hold the Russians’ feet to the fire and ensure that
they have the appropriate leverage to ensure that this is not a sellout
of Ukraine’s sovereignty, but that this is a negotiation that leads to a
just, durable, lasting peace, that preserves Ukraine as a sovereign,
democratic, independent state. </p>
<p>VOA: But is Ukraine in the strongest possible position for that?
Because that was one of the goals.  </p>
<p>Carpenter: It is, under the circumstances. Look, war is messy. War
involves all kinds of suffering. And Ukraine has certainly suffered over
the course of the more than 1000 days of Russia’s brutal aggression
against it. At the end of the day, Russia has occupied parts of Ukraine
that I wish had not come to pass. But there are also realities in this
war. And one of those realities has to do with manpower on the two sides
of the front lines of this battle space. And Ukraine simply has fewer
people on the battle space than Russia is able to muster. And that has
resulted in the situation that we’re in today. I think Ukraine is in a
strong position. I think it’s in a strong position financially. I think
the capabilities that we have given, the investments we’ve made in
things like Ukrainian production of unmanned aerial vehicles, in terms
of the capabilities, the armored vehicles that we’ve provided, the
HIMARS systems that have been highly effective, the air defense systems,
including the Patriot, all of that has been, I think, incredibly useful
for Ukraine. Of course, the situation remains tenuous in certain parts
of the Donbass, and that is simply a reality of this war.  </p>
<p>VOA: You said that the Biden administration achieved its goals
towards Ukraine, but wasn’t, at some point, the goal a victory of
Ukraine? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Carpenter: Ideally, Ukraine would have been able to liberate its
territory. I think there’s still hope that Ukraine can continue to work
towards not just defense but also liberating some of its land. But at
the end of the day, this boils down to what I said earlier. This is a
fundamentally a physics and a math problem in terms of the number of
people on both sides of the front lines. And Russia is able to bring
more soldiers to bear in this war than Ukraine has been able to. And we
can give all the capabilities: from F-16s to Abrams tanks to HIMARS
systems, ATACMS missiles, you name it. But without the manpower on the
front lines, it’s impossible to achieve what you have just outlined,
which is complete liberation of all of Ukraine’s territory. And so,
look, it’s up to Ukrainians again to decide when and under what
circumstances they want to negotiate. But we have set them up for
success, given the capabilities that we have provided, which I just want
to remind your viewers, is close to $70 billion in security assistance.
That is a significant amount of capability that the United States has
provided.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>VOA: You mentioned the assistance. In December, you assured us that
the United States and the Biden administration will use all of that
approved funds to provide Ukraine military assistance. But now there is
$3.8 billion that this administration is leaving for the next. Why
didn’t the Biden administration use those funds? And do you have any
concern that the next administration might not want to use these funds
to support Ukraine?  </p>
<p>Carpenter: Well, you know, I don’t want to get into a complex
discussion of the way our budgetary process works, but there is a
difference between authorized funds and obligated funds. So we have
provided all of the funds that Congress has obligated for Ukraine.
That’s not all the funds that have been authorized. But it takes
coordination between the administration and Congress to be able to move
all of that money. We have moved all of it that we had available to us.
Yes, the next administration will now have the option to use some of
that authorized money to continue to provide assistance to Ukraine. And
some of what we have obligated is on contract, or is en route, and will
arrive in the coming weeks. But all of that is available to the next
administration to continue to support Ukraine.</p>
<p>VOA: Before leaving office, Biden’s administration, as you said,
imposed major energy sanctions against Russia. Do you think that these
measures might be something that pushes Russia economy closer to a
collapse and something that can actually stop Russia’s war machine? </p>
<p>Carpenter: Well, our hope is that this additional pressure, which is
extraordinary because we have imposed full blocking sanctions on two of
the largest Russian oil companies. Surgutneftegas and Gazprom Neft,
together with over 180 vessels from Russia’s shadow fleet. We hope that
additional cost in position will bring Putin closer to a realistic and
durable solution to this conflict when he sits down at the negotiating
table eventually, whenever that happens. I think, of course, any type of
sanctions that reduce the revenues available to the Russian Federation
is less money in the hands of those who fuel Russia’s war machine and
Russia’s aggression against Ukraine. And it provides more space for
Ukraine to be able to negotiate from a position of strength.  </p>
<p>VOA: In his foreign policy speech yesterday, President Biden
mentioned as one of his accomplishments that he was able to prevent a
direct confrontation between two nuclear powers, the United States and
Russia. Many analysts that we’re talking to say that fears of nuclear
escalation prevented President Biden from helping Ukraine win the war.
Why was the United States deterred by Russia’s “red lines,” but not vice
versa? </p>
<p>Carpenter: Nobody was deterred. The United States provided every
capability that Ukraine asked for. It is only logical that as the
world’s largest nuclear superpower, that the United States has to factor
in escalation management. </p>
<p>Anyone who says to the contrary is being irresponsible about foreign
policy and does not sit in the Oval Office and have to make those
weighty decisions.  </p>
<p>VOA: But does it send a signal that Russia’s “nuclear card” will
always beat everything else?  </p>
<p>Carpenter: No, it does not, because the Ukrainians have done
extraordinarily well at certain points on the battlefield. But this
fundamentally gets back to what the question you raised earlier, which
is manpower. And that’s not a variable that the United States
controls. </p>
<p>VOA: How do you hope the next administration approaches the policy
towards Ukraine? And how does President Biden feel about the fact that
his legacy towards Ukraine will be largely defined by the policies of
the next administration? </p>
<p>Carpenter: I’m not going to speak to what the next administration
will do or won’t do. I will just say that, again, this administration,
we have tried to hand off a situation where Russia is both on its back
foot, thanks to our sanctions in the energy and financial spheres; [and]
Ukraine is in a solid macro financial state thanks to the $50 billion
loan that we negotiated together with our G-7 partners, and that Ukraine
has the capabilities militarily to be able to continue to maintain the
defense of its territory.</p>

California faces new fire-spreading wind threats</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands in Southern California faced new threats of
fire-spreading high winds on Wednesday as firefighters continued to
fight wildfires in the greater Los Angeles area that have killed at
least 25 people and left nearly 30 missing.</p>
<p>A day after firefighters got a reprieve with lighter winds than
expected, gusts were hitting up to 56 kilometers per hour on the Pacific
coast and 88 kilometers per hour in the mountains before dawn, National
Weather Service meteorologist Todd Hall said.</p>
<p>“This is really just the last push of these winds here today,” Hall
said. “Hopefully, if we get through today, we’re going to have some
better conditions for late week, especially into Friday and
Saturday.”</p>
<p>The National Weather Service issued a high-level “particularly
dangerous situation” warning through 3 p.m. local time Wednesday and
extended a red-flag warning through Thursday for some areas north of the
city.</p>
<p>“Please stay on guard for a fast-moving fire,” forecasters said.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, weaker-than-expected winds had allowed firefighters to
make some progress in containing the two largest blazes, the Palisades
and Eaton fires, but they were far from fully controlled. Authorities
said that the Palisades blaze was 19% contained and the Eaton fire
45%.</p>
<p>But no more homes or major structures were reported burning in the
two blazes, although officials said embers could still be lingering
unseen and that it could take weeks to fully extinguish them.</p>
<p>The wildfires, which ignited on January 7, have displaced more than
100,000 people and left thousands more on edge, wondering whether they
could be forced to evacuate their homes and flee for safety on a
moment’s notice. More than 82,000 people in Los Angeles County are under
evacuation orders, with another 90,400 under evacuation warnings, county
Sheriff Robert Luna told reporters.</p>
<p>Diminishing winds will likely make it easier for firefighters to gain
control of the blazes, though meteorologists have warned the dangerous
Santa Ana windstorms may return early next week. Weather forecasts show
little to no chance of rain.</p>
<p>Utility companies have shut off power to more than 77,000 households
to prevent their power lines from sparking new blazes.</p>
<p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass told reporters she took an aerial tour
of the affected areas on Monday.</p>
<p>“The massive, massive destruction is unimaginable until you actually
see it,” Bass said.</p>
<p>Some information for this report came from The Associated Press,
Agence France-Presse and Reuters.</p>

id="in-farewell-address-biden-warns-of-concentration-of-power-and-wealth-1">In
farewell address, Biden warns of concentration of power and wealth</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WHITE HOUSE — In his farewell address from the Oval Office Wednesday
evening, U.S. President Joe Biden warned of the dangers of the
concentration of power and wealth, highlighting the emergence of an
“oligarchy” and a “tech-industrial complex.”</p>
<p>“The dangerous concentration of power in the hands of a very few
ultra wealthy people, the dangerous consequences if their abuse of power
is left unchecked,” he said. “Today, an oligarchy is taking shape in
America of extreme wealth, power and influence that literally threatens
our entire democracy, our basic rights and freedom.”</p>
<p>The president did not say who he meant by oligarchy. But some of the
nation’s biggest billionaires including Elon Musk have forged close ties
with President-elect Donald Trump, who will be inaugurated Monday.</p>
<p>Musk spent more than $100 million towards Trump’s reelection, while
Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon’s Jeff Bezos have made large
donations to Trump’s inaugural committee.</p>
<p>Without mentioning names, Biden made a jab at Zuckerberg’s recent
decision that his social media company, which owns Facebook and
Instagram, will stop working with fact checkers.</p>
<p>“The free press is crumbling. Editors are disappearing. Social media
is giving up on fact checking,” Biden said. “The truth is smothered by
lies told for power and for profit.”</p>
<p>Gaza ceasefire</p>
<p>Biden ended his term on a high note on foreign policy. Just hours
earlier, he announced that Israel and Hamas have reached a
ceasefire-and-hostage agreement in Gaza.</p>
<p>“It is the result not only of the extreme pressure that Hamas has
been under and the changed regional equation after a ceasefire in
Lebanon and weakening of Iran — but also of dogged and painstaking
American diplomacy,” Biden said in a statement. “My diplomacy never
ceased in their efforts to get this done.”</p>
<p>The deal will largely be implemented by the incoming administration,
and in his farewell Biden said he is instructing his team to keep the
incoming administration fully informed.</p>
<p>Trump immediately sought to take credit for the deal, posting on
social media that “the ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a
result of our Historic Victory in November.”</p>
<p>On the foreign policy front, the administration insists it is leaving
the incoming administration with a “very strong hand to play.”</p>
<p>“We’re leaving an America with more friends and stronger alliances,
whose adversaries are weaker and under pressure,” Biden said in his
foreign policy address delivered Monday. “An America that once again is
leading, uniting countries, setting the agenda, bringing others together
behind our plans and visions.”</p>
<p>The president again defended his decision to withdraw the United
States from Afghanistan in 2021. Republicans and some Democrats have
criticized the manner with which Biden ended America’s longest war as
chaotic, costing the lives of 13 service members and dozens of Afghan
civilians in a terrorist attack in Kabul.</p>
<p>Winter of peril and possibilities</p>
<p>In a letter released Wednesday morning, Biden reflected on how his
administration began in the shadows of COVID-19 and the Jan. 6, 2021,
attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of Trump supporters intent on
overturning the result of the 2020 election that Biden won.</p>
<p>“Four years ago, we stood in a winter of peril and a winter of
possibilities,” he said in the letter. “But we came together as
Americans, and we braved through it. We emerged stronger, more
prosperous, and more secure.”</p>
<p>It was Biden’s fifth and final formal address from the Oval Office.
In his previous Oval Office address six months ago, he explained his
decision to step aside and endorse his vice president, Kamala Harris, to
run against Trump in the 2024 election.</p>
<p>The president’s farewell address comes a day after Jack Smith, the
special counsel who indicted Trump on charges of illegally trying to
cling to power after the 2020 election, released his final report.
Smith’s report said the evidence would have been sufficient to convict
the president-elect in a trial, had his 2024 election victory not made
it impossible for the prosecution to continue.</p>
<p>Trump has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and attacked the special
counsel’s work as politically motivated.</p>
<p>In July the U.S. Supreme Court granted Trump sweeping protections
from criminal liability over his role in trying to undermine his 2020
defeat. Biden used his farewell address to call for a constitutional
amendment to end immunity for sitting presidents.</p>
<p>Biden’s legacy</p>
<p>Biden is leaving office with a 39% approval rating, according to
Gallup. Thomas Schwartz, a presidential historian from Vanderbilt
University in Tennessee, said the president’s legacy will be affected by
how Trump governs in the next four years.</p>
<p>“If Trump ends up being a disaster … either ushering economic chaos,
or if there’s more world chaos from conflicts, Biden will be remembered
more favorably,” he told VOA. “If Trump really proves to be as dangerous
to democratic norms as Biden and the Democrats suggested, then I think
he may be seen as very prophetic.”</p>
<p>Conversely, by inheriting a strong economy and a winding down of U.S.
foreign entanglements, Trump has the potential to become a president in
the caliber of Ronald Reagan, Schwartz said. In which case Biden will be
noted by historians for his legislative achievements but “won’t be
remembered as fondly.”</p>
<p>The White House also released an extensive fact sheet detailing the
Biden-Harris administration’s achievements domestically and abroad.</p>
<p>The sheet highlighted historic economic progress that added 16.6
million jobs, grew the GDP by 12.6% and raised median household wealth
by 37%. It underscored investments in infrastructure, clean energy, and
semiconductors through Biden’s signature legislation, the Inflation
Reduction Act and CHIPS Act.</p>
<p>The White House argued that through targeted relief and fair
taxation, the Biden administration rebuilt a “stronger, fairer economy,”
creating opportunity from the bottom up.</p>
<p>Biden ended his farewell address by thanking the nation for the
privilege to serve.</p>
<p>“I still believe in the idea for which this nation stands, a nation
where the strength of our institutions and the character of our people
matter and must endure,” he said.</p>
<p>“Now it’s your turn to stand guard.”</p>

id="rubio-vows-to-place-us-interests-above-all-else-as-trumps-top-diplomat">Rubio
vows to place US interests ‘above all else’ as Trump’s top diplomat</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Florida Sen. Marco Rubio is promising to implement
President-elect Donald Trump’s “America First” vision as secretary of
state, vowing in his confirmation hearing Wednesday that the incoming
administration will forge a new path by placing American interests
“above all else.” </p>
<p>“Placing our core national interests above all else is not
isolationism,” Rubio will tell the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
according to an opening statement obtained by The Associated Press. “It
is the commonsense realization that a foreign policy centered on our
national interest is not some outdated relic.” </p>
<p>“The postwar global order is not just obsolete; it is now a weapon
being used against us,” Rubio says. </p>
<p>It’s a remarkable opening salvo from Rubio, who was born in Miami to
Cuban immigrants, and who, if confirmed, would become the first Latino
ever to serve as the nation’s top diplomat. </p>
<p>The confirmation hearing begins a new chapter in the political career
of the 53-year-old Florida Republican, whose relationship with Trump has
evolved over the last decade. Once rivals trading schoolyard insults as
they campaigned for president in 2016, the two men became close allies
as Trump campaigned for another White House term last year. </p>
<p>Rubio first came to Washington as part of the “tea party” wave in
2010 and once advocated for allowing a path to citizenship for
immigrants in the country illegally. But like other Republicans, Rubio’s
views on immigration have shifted toward the hardline stance of Trump,
who has pledged to aggressively pursue deportations once he takes office
on Monday. </p>
<p>Unlike many of Trump’s Cabinet selections, Rubio is expected to
easily win confirmation, notching support not only from Republicans but
also Democrats who endorse him as a “responsible” pick to represent the
U.S. abroad. Many expect he will be among the first of Trump’s Cabinet
picks approved. </p>
<p>Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz, who served alongside Rubio on the
Foreign Relations Committee, said he has high hopes that the Florida
Republican will reject the isolationist approach of other Trump
allies. </p>
<p>“I think Marco is a hawk, but he’s also an internationalist, and I
think the challenge for him will be to maintain the long bipartisan
tradition of America being indispensable in world affairs,” the Hawaii
lawmaker told AP. “And there are people in the Trump world who want us
to run away from being the leaders of the free world. And I’m hoping
that Marco’s instincts towards American strength will win the day.” </p>
<p>Rubio’s approach to foreign affairs is grounded in his years of
service on the Foreign Relations committee and the Senate Intelligence
panel. In his speeches and writings, he’s delivered increasingly stern
warnings about growing military and economic threats to the United
States, particularly from China, which he says has benefited from a
“global world order” that he characterizes as obsolete. </p>
<p>China, Rubio will tell the committee, has “lied, cheated, hacked, and
stolen their way to global superpower status, at our expense.” </p>
<p>If confirmed, Rubio will become the leader of U.S. foreign policy —
though his role will surely remain secondary to Trump, who relishes the
global stage and frequently uses the bully pulpit against America’s
allies. </p>
<p>Even before taking office, Trump has stirred angst in foreign
capitals by threatening to seize the Panama Canal and Greenland and
suggesting he will pressure Canada to become the nation’s 51st
state. </p>
<p>By winning another term, Trump has won an “unmistakable mandate from
the voters,” Rubio will say. </p>
<p>“They want a strong America. Engaged in the world. But guided by a
clear objective, to promote peace abroad, and security and prosperity
here at home.” </p>
<p>A Biden administration decision to rescind Cuba’s designation as a
state sponsor of terrorism with just days left in office is likely to
irk Rubio, who has long supported tough sanctions on the communist-run
island. </p>
<p>Rubio’s office did not respond to multiple queries Tuesday about the
senator’s reaction to the move, which many believe will almost certainly
be reversed by the Trump administration. </p>
<p>Secretaries of state have played a key role in formulating the
foreign policy of the country since its founding, starting with the
first one, Thomas Jefferson, who served in the top Cabinet position
under President George Washington. </p>
<p>Since then, Jefferson, as well as his 19th century successors James
Madison, James Monroe, John Quincy Adams, Martin Van Buren and James
Buchanan, have all gone on to be elected president. </p>
<p>More recent secretaries of state have been less successful in their
political ambitions, including John Kerry, who lost the 2004
presidential election to President George W. Bush before becoming the
top diplomat, and Hillary Clinton, who lost the 2016 election to
Trump. </p>
<p>The most successful secretaries of state have been known for their
closeness to the presidents whom they serve, notably James Baker under
George H.W. Bush, Condoleezza Rice under George W. Bush and, to some
extent, Clinton under Barack Obama. </p>
<p>Like Clinton, Rubio was once a political rival to the president-elect
who nominated them. However, the Clinton-Obama relationship during the
2008 Democratic primaries was not nearly as hostile as that between
Trump and Rubio in the 2016 GOP primaries, which was marked by
name-calling and personal insults. </p>
<p>Trump had an acrimonious relationship with his first secretary of
state, Rex Tillerson. Trump fired him from the position via a social
media post less than two years into his term.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
Hydrogen. What are you even supposed to think about it? If you’ve spent
serious time focusing on climate policy, you’ve heard the hype about
hydrogen — about the miraculous things that it might do to eliminate
carbon pollution from cars, power plants, steel mills, or more. You’ve
also seen that hype fizzle out — even as governments have poured
billions of dollars into making it work.
</p>
<p>
On this week’s episode of Shift Key, Rob and Jesse give you a rough
guide for how to think about clean hydrogen, which could help
decarbonize the industrial — even the molecular — side of the economy by
storing energy and helping to make clean steel and chemicals. Do we
really need hydrogen to fight climate change? Where would it be useful?
And why has it failed to take off in the past? What will Trump and China
mean for global hydrogen policy? Shift Key is hosted by Robinson Meyer,
the founding executive editor of Heatmap, and Jesse Jenkins, a professor
of energy systems engineering at Princeton University.

Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Jesse Jenkins: </strong>This is the next crazy thing that I
think is just starting to kind of bubble up to the public awareness:
Basically, hydrogen itself is not a climate forcer. It doesn’t warm the
planet the way methane or [hydrofluorocarbons] or CO2 does. But it does
react in the atmosphere in ways that increase the concentration of
greenhouse gases.<br/><br/><strong>Robinson Meyer: </strong>I think
specifically that right now, we talk about when methane leaks into the
atmosphere. And it may apply to other greenhouse gases, too, but the big
one that you tend to hear about is that when methane leaks into the
atmosphere from natural gas — and of course, we’re very worried about
methane leaks. Because the thing about methane is that it traps a lot of
heat, but it breaks down really quickly, right? So it tends to break
down, unlike carbon dioxide, which, when you release it into the
atmosphere. sticks around for millennia. When you release it into the
atmosphere, it captures a lot of heat, but then breaks down into a
smaller amount of CO2 after about 20 years.<br/> <br/>The issue, and why
it breaks down, that — we never talk about this, or we had no need to
talk about this until hydrogen — and it’s crazy because the world is a
closed system, or a largely closed system, right? Why it breaks down is
it reacts with the free hydroxyl radicals floating around in the
atmosphere.<br/><br/><strong>Jenkins: </strong>Right, OH molecules.<br/>
<br/><strong>Meyer:</strong> Well, what else reacts with OH molecules?
Hydrogen. And so if we leak too much industrially produced hydrogen into
the atmosphere, it could mess with the rate of breakdown of all methane
in the global atmosphere, and thus increase the global warming potential
of natural gas.<br/><br/><strong>Jenkins: </strong>It makes the methane
last, traps more heat, yeah. So let the record show that Robinson Meyer,
the journalist, accurately captured the atmospheric chemistry of this
process better than Jesse Jenkins, professor at Princeton. Nicely
done.<br/>

firefighters battle wildfires as forecasters warn of dangerous
winds</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Warnings were in place again Wednesday in the Los Angeles area for
the prospect of strong winds combining with dry conditions to spread
wildfires as firefighters battled a series of blazes in the region that
have already killed at least 25 people.</p>
<p>After winds were weaker than expected during the day Tuesday, the
National Weather Service said the region was “not out of the woods yet,”
with the potential for a surge in winds through early Wednesday
afternoon.</p>
<p>Utility companies shut off power to more than 77,000 households to
prevent their power lines from sparking new blazes.</p>
<p>The winds threatened to undermine incremental gains that firefighters
have made in recent days as they try to control two main fires that have
been burning since last week, as well as a smaller fire that sparked
Monday.</p>
<p>The California Department of Foresty and Fire Protection (Cal Fire)
said the Palisades Fire on the western side of Los Angeles had burned 96
square kilometers and was 18% contained as of early Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Eaton Fire in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains on the
east side of the city was 35% contained and has burned 57 square
kilometers, Cal Fire said.</p>
<p>About 88,000 people remained under evacuation orders with another
nearly 85,000 being warned they might be ordered to evacuate. Los
Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna encouraged people to consider leaving
when they get a warning without waiting for an order. He said deputies
have had to rescue many people who waited until the last minute after
receiving orders. </p>
<p>Authorities said nearly 30 people remain missing, and that the death
toll was likely to rise as search crews gain access to areas that have
already burned.</p>
<p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass told reporters she took an aerial tour
of the affected areas on Monday.</p>
<p>“The massive, massive destruction is unimaginable until you actually
see it,” Bass said. </p>

Japanese companies send landers on moon missions</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Two moon landers built by private U.S. and Japanese companies are on
their way to the moon after lifting off early Wednesday on a shared ride
aboard a SpaceX rocket.</p>
<p>The launch from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida is the latest
in a public-private program that put a spacecraft from Intuitive
Machines on the moon last year.</p>
<p>Wednesday’s launch included a lander from Japanese space exploration
company ispace that is carrying a rover with the capability of
collecting lunar dirt and testing potential food and water sources on
the moon.</p>
<p>The spacecraft is also carrying a small red “Moonhouse” built by
Swedish artist Mikael Genberg.</p>
<p>The ispace mission is expected to reach its destination on the moon’s
far north in four to five months.</p>
<p>The company is making its second attempt at a lunar landing, after a
2023 mission failed in the final stages. </p>
<p>Also aboard the rocket heading toward the moon is a lander from U.S.
company Firefly Aerospace that is set to carry out 10 experiments for
NASA.</p>
<p>The planned experiments include gathering dirt and measuring
subsurface temperatures.</p>
<p>The spacecraft is expected to arrive in about 45 days.</p>

id="why-did-us-exclude-india-from-unrestricted-access-to-ai-chips">Why
did US exclude India from unrestricted access to AI chips?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden signed on Tuesday an executive
order to boost development of artificial intelligence infrastructure in
America. A day earlier, his administration announced sweeping measures
to block access to the most advanced semiconductors by China and other
adversaries.</p>
<p>But the U.S. left India, its strategic partner in the Indo-Pacific,
off a list of 18 countries that are allowed unrestricted access to
advanced AI chips. Analysts say while a growing technological
relationship between the two countries would likely make India eligible
in the future to access advanced U.S. AI chips, New Delhi’s existing
ties with Moscow and the perception of a less robust technology
regulatory framework led to its exclusion from the top list.</p>
<p>Exclusion not a surprise</p>
<p>The Commerce Department’s policy framework divides the world into
three categories. The first tier includes the U.S. and 18 countries with
unrestricted access, followed by a list of more than 100 countries that
will be subjected to new caps on advanced semiconductors with individual
exemptions. The third tier includes adversaries such as China and Russia
that face maximum restrictions.</p>
<p>India falls in the second category, along with U.S. allies like
Israel and close friends such as Singapore.</p>
<p>Bhaskar Chakravorti, the dean of global business at The Fletcher
School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in Massachusetts, said
that India’s relationship with Russia “puts it outside a super safe
category.”</p>
<p>India has had close ties with Russia since the Soviet Union supported
its desire for independence from Britain. It maintained those ties
during the Cold War, when the U.S. sided with India’s rival
Pakistan.</p>
<p>Scott Jones, a non-resident fellow at Washington’s Stimson Center
think tank, highlighted recent reports that accused a few Indian
companies of aiding Russia’s war on Ukraine, but stressed that while
being excluded is a disappointment, it’s “not a setback for India.”</p>
<p>He also pointed to the perception that “India’s ability to control
and manage technology is perhaps not as robust as evidenced in some of
the 18 countries.”</p>
<p>While India may be off the unrestricted list for now, analysts say
its growing technological cooperation with the U.S. may shield it from
some curbs.</p>
<p>Richard Rossow, senior adviser and chair on India and Emerging Asia
Economies at Washington’s Center for Strategic and International
Studies, said the presence of caveats in the new framework would ensure
India’s later participation.</p>
<p>“The fact that they have announced that there will be a pathway for
some countries to get exemptions that are above what they’re going to
consider the standard cap, India, I imagine, would be on the short list
of countries,” he told VOA.</p>
<p>In early January, national security adviser Jake Sullivan traveled to
India and met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other senior
officials. During the trip, both sides reiterated their commitment to
forge a “strategic technology partnership” and strengthen cooperation
under the U.S.-India initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology
(iCET), a bilateral mechanism focused on technology partnership.</p>
<p>On semiconductors, the U.S. is facilitating investments in India’s
semiconductor manufacturing and intensifying R&amp;D collaboration.</p>
<p>During his trip, Sullivan highlighted the investment of $2.7 billion
in India by U.S. chipmaker Micron to create semiconductor packaging
facilities, which he hoped would contribute to establishing “India as a
new hub in the global chip ecosystem.”</p>
<p>The Indian government too is investing billions of dollars through
its dedicated program called the India Semiconductor Mission and
Production Linked Incentive scheme.</p>
<p>Rossow argued that the Indian government would not have been
“terribly surprised” that “they were not included” in the list.</p>
<p>Jones of the Stimson Center agreed.</p>
<p>“Jake Sullivan was in New Delhi last week, and I would be very
surprised if he did not inform his Indian counterparts of what was going
to happen,” he said.</p>
<p>Ensuring America’s leadership in AI</p>
<p>The Biden administration has focused on the centrality of artificial
intelligence to America’s security and economic strength. According to a
White House factsheet, the latest steps are part of its effort to
prevent offshoring this critical technology and ensure that “the world’s
AI runs on American rails.”</p>
<p>Since October 2022, the U.S. government has enacted a series of
export controls, blocking access of advanced semiconductors to China to
prevent its use for military applications. While initially the measures
adversely affected the Chinese semiconductor industry, Beijing has
continued to advance its capabilities and is attempting to narrow the
technology gap.</p>
<p>According to Chakravorti of the Fletcher School, there are numerous
implementation challenges of this expansive global strategy.</p>
<p>“From lobbying from the U.S. chipmakers that will start as soon as
Trump takes office to potential leaks in the carefully calibrated list
of countries. Will there be a secondary market? How does this affect
where future data centers are built?” he asked.</p>
<p>Jones of the Stimson Center argued that the policy is more a
“symbolic gesture than a practical consideration” but has a stern
message for the rest of the world.</p>
<p>“The U.S. is clearly saying, if you want to participate in the
U.S.-sponsored AI ecosystem, you have to pick now. You pick China or you
pick us. You can’t have it both ways. You can’t play one off against the
other. You have to choose,” he concluded.</p>

SEC sues Elon Musk over late disclosure of Twitter stake</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Elon Musk was sued on Tuesday by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, which accused the world’s richest person of waiting too long
to disclose in 2022 he had amassed a large stake in Twitter, the social
media company he later bought.</p>
<p>In a complaint filed in Washington, the SEC said Musk violated
federal securities law by waiting 11 days too long to disclose his
initial purchase of 5% of Twitter’s common shares.</p>
<p>An SEC rule requires investors to disclose within 10 calendar days,
or by March 24, 2022, in Musk’s case, when they cross a 5% ownership
threshold.</p>
<p>The SEC said that at the expense of unsuspecting investors, Musk
bought more than $500 million of Twitter shares at artificially low
prices before finally revealing his purchases on April 4, 2022, by which
time he owned a 9.2% stake.</p>
<p>Twitter’s share price rose more than 27% following that disclosure,
the SEC said.</p>
<p>Tuesday’s lawsuit seeks to force Musk to pay a civil fine and
disgorge profits he didn’t deserve.</p>
<p>Musk eventually purchased Twitter for $44 billion in October 2022,
and renamed it X.</p>
<p>Alex Spiro, a lawyer for Musk, in an email called the SEC lawsuit the
culmination of the regulator’s “multi-year campaign of harassment”
against his client.</p>
<p>“Today’s action is an admission by the SEC that they cannot bring an
actual case,” he said. “Mr. Musk has done nothing wrong and everyone
sees this sham for what it is.”</p>
<p>Spiro added that the lawsuit addresses a mere “alleged administrative
failure to file a single form — an offense that, even if proven, carries
a nominal penalty.”</p>
<p>Musk, an adviser to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, is worth $417
billion according to Forbes magazine, through businesses such as the
electric car maker Tesla and rocket company.</p>
<p>He is worth nearly twice as much as Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos,
the world’s second-richest person at $232 billion, Forbes said.</p>
<p>The SEC sued Musk six days before Trump’s January 20 presidential
inauguration.</p>
<p>SEC Chairman Gary Gensler is stepping down that day, and Paul Atkins,
who Trump nominated to succeed him, is expected to review many of
Gensler’s rules and enforcement actions.</p>
<p>Musk has also been sued in Manhattan federal court by former Twitter
shareholders over the late disclosure.</p>
<p>In that case, Musk has said it was implausible to believe he wanted
to defraud other shareholders, and that “all indications” were that his
delay was a mistake.</p>
<p>Musk has long feuded with the SEC, including after it sued him in
2018 over his Twitter posts about possibly taking Tesla private and
having secured funding to do so.</p>
<p>He settled that lawsuit by paying a $20 million civil fine, agreeing
to have Tesla lawyers review some Twitter posts in advance, and giving
up his role as Tesla’s chairman.</p>
<p>The SEC also sought sanctions from Musk after he missed court-ordered
testimony last September for the Twitter probe so he could attend the
launch of SpaceX’s Polaris Dawn mission at Florida’s Cape Canaveral.</p>
<p>A federal judge in San Francisco rejected that request, because Musk
later testified and agreed to pay the SEC’s travel costs.</p>

<h2 id="biden-announces-2-new-national-monuments-in-california">Biden
announces 2 new national monuments in California</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — In an announcement postponed by the Los Angeles
wildfires, President Joe Biden on Tuesday designated two sites in
California as national monuments that will honor Native American tribes
while shielding picturesque mountains and deserts from mining and energy
development.</p>
<p>Biden made the designations at an event at the White House, a week
after and on the other side of the country from where he’d originally
planned to do so with a speech in California’s Eastern Coachella
Valley.</p>
<p>The president landed in California on January 6 but made it as far as
Los Angeles before high winds — which helped spark the Los Angeles
blazes — forced officials to scrap the event. It was a stark reminder
that, even as Biden uses the last days of his administration to attempt
to safeguard the environment, climate change is already helping to
exacerbate natural disasters.</p>
<p>Instead, Biden spoke next to screens featuring towering peaks, desert
vistas and an array of plant and animal life.</p>
<p>“I was hoping we were going to do this in place,” the president said.
“This is as close as we could get.”</p>
<p>Biden formally created the Chuckwalla National Monument, in Southern
California near Joshua Tree National Park, and the Sáttítla Highlands
National Monument, in Northern California.</p>
<p>The declarations bar oil and natural gas drilling, as well as mining
and other exploration and production initiatives, on the
2,400-square-kilometer Chuckwalla site, and roughly 800 square
kilometers near the California-Oregon border.</p>
<p>The protected area encompasses natural wonders, including the Painted
Canyon of Mecca Hills and Alligator Rock, and is home to 50-plus rare
species of plants and animals like the desert bighorn sheep and the
Chuckwalla lizard, which the monument is named for, the White House said
in a statement.</p>
<p>At the event, Biden talked about taking his children to national
monuments around the country yearly when they were young to “witness the
majesty, the beauty.”</p>
<p>“Our national wonders are the heart and soul of this nation,” he
said. “It’s a birthright we pass on from generation to generation.”</p>
<p>The monuments becoming realities honor past tribal requests. Many
Native American tribes and environmental groups have pushed for
designation of the Chuckwalla National Monument, while the Pit River
Tribe has worked to get the federal government to designate the Sáttítla
Highlands National Monument.</p>
<p>Biden joked about being careful not to mispronounce Sáttítla, then
still struggled to pronounce it. When he sat down to sign the formal
acts, he simply referred to it as the “highlands” monument, so he didn’t
have to give it another try.</p>
<p>The designations are part of a larger Biden administration effort to
conserve at least 30% of U.S. lands and waters by 2030. They follow
Biden’s recent move banning new offshore oil and gas drilling in most
U.S. coastal waters, including in California.</p>
<p>That was an attempt to thwart possible efforts by the incoming
Republican administration to expand offshore drilling, but
President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to quickly reverse the order.</p>

to lift state sponsor of terrorism designation on Cuba</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden notified Congress on Tuesday that he intends
to delist Cuba as a U.S.-designated state sponsor of terrorism in a deal
facilitated by the Catholic Church to free political prisoners on the
island. </p>
<p>Speaking on the condition of anonymity before the announcement,
senior administration officials told reporters that dozens of political
prisoners and others deemed unjustly detained by U.S. officials would be
freed by noon on January 20. </p>
<p>The announcement also indicated the U.S. would aim to reduce economic
pressure on the island nation. </p>
<p>“Today’s actions demonstrate that President Biden’s Cuba policy,
which is focused on achieving practical results with respect to human
rights in Cuba, will pay dividends for the Cuban people,” a senior
official told reporters, acknowledging Havana’s “direct dialogue with
the Catholic Church.”   </p>
<p>Hours after Biden’s announcement, Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel
said his government would gradually release 553 prisoners after talks
with the church.  </p>
<p>Earlier, his government expressed gratitude.  </p>
<p>“Despite its limited scope, this is a decision that points to the
right direction and is in line with the sustained and firm demand by the
government and the people of Cuba,” the country’s foreign ministry said
in a press release. </p>
<p>“The decision announced today by the United States, rectifies, in a
very limited way, some aspects of a cruel and unjust policy,” it
added. </p>
<p>In Congress, the backlash to Biden’s announcement was swift.  </p>
<p>“Today’s decision is unacceptable on its merits,” Republican Senator
Ted Cruz said in a statement. “The terrorism advanced by the Cuban
regime has not ceased. I will work with President Trump and my
colleagues to immediately reverse and limit the damage from the
decision.” </p>
<p>Fellow Republican Representative Carlos Gimenez also criticized the
announcement, predicting a quick reversal on the policy by
President-elect Donald Trump. </p>
<p>“President Biden is a pathetic coward,” Gimenez posted on X. “Come
January 20th, there will be a NEW SHERIFF in town &amp; President Trump
alongside Secretary of State <span class="citation"
data-cites="SenMarcoRubio">@SenMarcoRubio</span> will not only put #Cuba
BACK on the list but PULVERIZE the regime once &amp; for all!” </p>
<p>According to The Associated Press, human rights groups and activists,
including the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, have been pressing
the Biden administration to lift the designation to ease the suffering
of Cuban people who feel the impact of Cuba’s economic isolation. </p>

begs the question: Should lots of people relocate? Crystal Kolden,
director of the Fire Resilience Center at the University of California
at Merced and a former wildland firefighter, said abandoning these
places isn’t the only option. On the show today, Kolden explains why the
L.A. fires have been so tough to put out, why wildfires are different
from other natural disasters like hurricanes and floods, and how
devastated communities can rebuild in a way that makes them more
resilient to future fires.

id="new-orleans-attacker-had-researched-similar-rampage-and-how-to-access-bourbon-street-balcony">New
Orleans attacker had researched similar rampage, and how to access
Bourbon Street balcony</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BATON ROUGE — Before plowing a pickup truck into a crowd of New
Year’s revelers in New Orleans, killing 14 people, the man who carried
out the Islamic State group-inspired attack had researched how to access
a balcony on the city’s famed Bourbon Street and looked up information
about a similar recent attack at a Christmas market in Germany, the FBI
said. </p>
<p>Nearly two weeks after Shamsud-Din Jabbar’s rampage, the FBI
continues to uncover new information detailing the extensive planning by
the 42-year-old Army veteran who scouted out the area multiple times in
the months leading up to the attack. Authorities also have been piecing
together a timeline of his radicalization. </p>
<p>In the early hours of New Year’s Day, Jabbar could be seen on video
surveillance placing two containers with explosive devices, which would
remain undetonated, in the French Quarter. Shortly after, about 3:15
a.m., Jabbar sped a white pickup truck around a police car blockading
the entrance of Bourbon Street, where partygoers continued to wander
around the street lined with bars. He drove through revelers before
crashing and being killed by police in a shootout. Fifty-seven people
were injured, authorities said. </p>
<p>Just hours before the deadly onslaught, Jabbar had searched online
for information about an attack at a busy outdoor Christmas Market in
east Germany that occurred just 10 days earlier and where a car was also
used as a mass weapon, the FBI said on Tuesday. The attack in Europe
left five people dead and more than 200 injured after a car slammed into
a crowd. Police arrested a 50-year-old doctor from Saudi Arabia who has
renounced Islam and supports the far-right AfD party. </p>
<p>In other online searches, Jabbar had looked up how to access a
balcony on Bourbon Street, information about Mardi Gras, and several
recent shootings in the city, the FBI said. </p>
<p>But Jabbar’s research ahead of the attack was not limited to online:
He also made a one-day visit to New Orleans from Houston on Nov. 10,
during which he looked for an apartment, the FBI said. While Jabbar
applied to rent the apartment, he later told the landlord that he
changed his mind. </p>
<p>That was not his only visit to New Orleans, though. The FBI had
previously reported that Jabbar had traveled to the city for a planning
trip on Oct. 31, when he used glasses from Meta, the parent company of
Facebook, to record video as he rode through the French Quarter on a
bicycle. </p>
<p>In a series of online videos, posted hours before he struck, Jabbar
proclaimed support for the Islamic State militant group. The Bourbon
Street attack was the deadliest Islamic State-inspired assault on U.S.
soil in years. On Tuesday, the FBI continued to draft out a timeline of
Jabbar’s radicalization, saying that he began isolating himself from
society and became a more devout Muslim in 2022. By the spring of 2024,
he began following extremist views. </p>
<p>While investigations into the attack are ongoing and additional
information continues to trickle out about Jabbar’s planning of the
deadly rampage, city officials face questions about safety
concerns. </p>
<p>State and local authorities have launched probes into possible
security deficiencies that left New Orleans vulnerable. The work is
especially urgent since Carnival season, a monthslong celebration that
attracts tens of thousands of visitors to the French Quarter, began last
week. The city is also set to host the Super Bowl on Feb. 9.</p>

Five Feet That Could Prevent the Next Palisades Fire</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-14, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTU1MTYyMC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1ODkxMzY2OH0.qOdnOv-IMBfte5SFBVy1MTp0mGB9wm6xqY4oeGs-3qY/image.jpg?width=1185&height=793&coordinates=15%2C0%2C0%2C7"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
For more than four years, California has had a law on the books meant to
protect homes and buildings during an urban firestorm like the Palisade
and Eaton fires. But it’s never gone into effect.
</p>
<p>
In theory, the policy was simple. It directed state officials to develop
new rules for buildings in areas with high fire risk, which would govern
what people were allowed to put within the five-foot perimeter
immediately surrounding their homes. A large body of evidence shows that
clearing this area, known in the fire mitigation world as “zone zero,”
of combustible materials can be the difference between a building that
alights during a wildfire and one that can weather the blaze.
</p>
<p>
The new rules — essentially just a list of items allowed in that
five-foot zone — were due two years ago, by January 1, 2023. But the
State Board of Forestry and Fire Protection has yet to begin a formal
rulemaking process. Ask anyone who’s been following this thread what’s
taking so long, and they’ll almost certainly point to one thing:
politics.
</p>
<p>
“There’s a ton of science about what to do, but the science has run into
challenges with social acceptance, and therefore political acceptance,”
Michael Wara, director of Stanford University’s Climate and Energy
Policy Program, told me. People do not want to be told how they can or
can’t landscape or furnish or otherwise adorn the outside of their
homes. Inevitably, when the rules do come out, you’ll hear about Gavin
Newsom coming to take away people’s decks and policing gardens.
</p>
<p>
No one thinks that zone zero rules, if enacted and adhered to, could
have prevented fires in the Pacific Palisades or Altadena or saved every
structure in the recent fires’ path. But alongside other fire mitigation
strategies, zone zero design can significantly lower the chances of a
given building burning, and therefore the chances that a fire will
spread to neighboring buildings, and ultimately reduce the risk of fires
becoming compounding, devastating disasters. Wara likened it to car
safety rules like seatbelts and airbags — people still die in car
accidents, but far fewer than would otherwise.
</p>
<p>
The question now is whether the record-breaking destruction in Los
Angeles will be enough to convince people that zone zero rules are
effective and worthwhile. Past experience shows the answer is not an
obvious yes.
</p>
<h3>
Why homes burn
</h3>
<p>
There are three ways buildings ignite during a wildfire, Yana
Valachovic, a forest scientist with the University of California
Agriculture and Natural Resources Fire Network who specializes in
community resilience and the built environment, told me. They are either
exposed to burning embers, direct flames, or radiant heat, though most
often a combination.

Embers — hot, hard debris of burned material from a fire — can be
carried miles away from their origin by the wind and create new spot
fires next to homes. “What happens with those embers is they get thrown
at the building, they hit the walls, the siding, and then drop to the
base and collect at the base,” Valachovic said, “so you can have not
just one, but thousands of embers at the base of our structures.”
</p>
<p>
Embers can also penetrate buildings through open windows and ventilation
systems. If radiant heat from nearby burning structures causes windows
to shatter or fall out, that can also create new vectors for embers to
enter the home. “Embers find their way,” Valachovic said.
</p>
<p>
Fire mitigation experts promote two strategies for reducing
vulnerability, and they go hand in hand. The first is
<a href="https://readyforwildfire.org/prepare-for-wildfire/hardening-your-home/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>home
hardening</u></a>, which could mean building with fire-resistant
materials but also includes smaller but effective actions like covering
air vents with fine mesh screens and sealing gaps to try to block
embers. The second is
<a href="https://readyforwildfire.org/prepare-for-wildfire/defensible-space/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>creating
so-called “defensible space,”</u></a> or a buffer around the building,
where any vegetation is carefully selected and managed to slow the
spread of fire to and from the building. California divides defensible
space into three different zones: Zone one extends from 5 feet away from
the structure to 30 feet, and zone two goes out to 100 feet away. Then,
of course, there’s zone zero.
</p>
<p>
The state has had regulations on the books to require at least 30 feet
of defensible space in high-risk areas since 1965, and it updated the
standards to establish a two-zone system in 2006. In both cases, the
rules were “really framed around, how do you interrupt flames running at
the building?” said Valachovic. The regulations included thinning trees
and removing lower branches, clearing some trees that were closer to
homes, clearing dead wood and litter, and pruning branches that hang
over buildings. But they still allowed for vegetation right up against
the house.
</p>
<p>
Since then, wildfire post-mortems have found that this scenario of
flames burning a path to a building is not a primary driver of structure
loss. “It was missing the point,” Valachovic told me of the previous
rule structure. “What we’ve seen now for the last decade is that embers
are really driving our home loss issue, and so we’re basically allowing
all this vegetation and combustible material to be present in the zone
that is really very vulnerable.”

<p>
In August 2020, after Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of
emergency in California due to an explosion of wildfires, the state
legislature passed AB 3074, which finally sought to bridge the gap by
creating a new, “ember-resistant zone” — zone zero. Had the rules been
implemented under the timeline mandated by the law, new homes would have
had to comply beginning in 2023, and existing homes would have had to
comply beginning in 2024. Like the earlier defensible space rules, they
would have applied to homes located in parts of the state designated as
Fire Hazard Severity Zones. These are generally areas that you might
think of as the “wildland-urban interface,” where homes abut wildland
vegetation like forests or scrublands, but others extend into more urban
areas. Almost all of the burned area in the Pacific Palisades, for
instance, would have been
<a href="https://lacounty.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=d2ea45d15c784adfa601e84b38060c4e" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>subject
to the rules</u></a>, while only a small portion of the homes in
Altadena are in the zone.
</p>
<h3>
Why “zone zero” is political
</h3>
<p>
When I reached out to the California Natural Resources Agency, the
umbrella group for both the Board of Forestry and Fire Protection and
CalFire, to ask if there was an updated timeline for the regulations,
one of the first things that Tony Andersen, the Deputy Secretary for
Communications, told me, was not about the timeline but about the
ultimate cost of compliance.
</p>
<p>
“We recognize there are costs associated with doing this work around
homes and structures,” Andersen told me via email, “and we are focused
on identifying options for financial assistance as well as education and
outreach to help owners prepare and prioritize mitigations.” He then
noted that the rulemaking was a “complex process” that the agency wanted
to get right, and said it aimed to present a draft proposal to the Board
“as soon as is feasible, most likely in the coming months.”
</p>
<p>
Andersen’s response illustrates one of several tensions that have made
it difficult to write the zone zero rules — and will ultimately make
them difficult to implement. If the rules say you can’t have a wooden
deck, for example, or you can’t have a fence that touches the building,
homeowners could face costly retrofits. And despite witnessing the
horror of destructive wildfires, many homeowners don’t want to switch
their wooden fence for a metal one, or replace their bushes with gravel.
</p>
<p>
Five feet might sound like a negligible amount of space, but people are
attached to the aesthetics of this zone. Homeowners have become used to
“softening” the line where the walls meet the ground by filling it in
with vegetation, Valachovic told me. “We really developed this idea that
we don’t visually want to see our foundations,” she said. “From a fire
defense perspective, this idea that we have combustible material
basically ringing our houses and our structures, that is problematic.”
</p>
<p>
Several people I interviewed for this story asked if I had seen a
documentary about the aftermath of the 2018 Camp Fire in Paradise,
California called <em><em>Bring Your Own Brigade</em></em>. The film
captures a series of city council meetings in 2019, when officials were
considering updating local building standards. They weigh a number of
ideas that would reduce the risk of embers collecting on top of, inside,
or next to homes, including eliminating gutters and requiring roof
overhangs and a five-foot setback for any combustible material.
</p>
<p>
At the time, the Camp Fire was the deadliest and most destructive
wildfire in state history, killing 85 people, displacing more than
50,000, and destroying more than 18,000 structures. But during a public
hearing, community members lashed out at the potential cost, warned that
new standards would prevent displaced residents from moving back, and
decried the aesthetic implications.
</p>
<p>
“Paradise is an individualistic town,” one person says. “That’s part of
the charm and the quirkiness. We don’t need consistency and uniformity.”
</p>
<p>
In another scene, a city councilmember asks Paradise Fire Chief John
Messina to narrow down the list to just one rule that would make the
community more fire resistant. “That five-foot barrier around your house
is extremely important,” he replies. “That would be the No. 1 thing out
of all of this that I would say would defend your home the best and have
the most impact.” Shortly after, the council votes down the measure.
</p>
<p>
Michael Wara, who recalled the scene to me over the phone, said a
similar thing happened when the fire chief in his community in Mill
Valley tried to get the city council to adopt zone zero rules. “The word
got out in the community that this crazy fire chief was going to make us
rip up our front yards,” he said. When the council convened for a vote,
more than a thousand people showed up to oppose it. The council ended up
passing it as a voluntary measure.
</p>
<p>
To Wara, part of the problem is the language used to communicate these
ideas with the public. “Zone zero” and “hardening” conjure a bunker
mentality, he said. “I do not want my family to live in a bunker that is
hardened to attack. I want my family to live in a home that is
welcoming.”
</p>
<p>
He also thinks the state can reach a compromise, like allowing
succulents and other fire-resistant greenery in zone zero. The rules
don’t have to turn these areas into gravel and concrete wastelands to be
effective.

The Los Angeles County Fire Department recently included photos in a
<a href="https://fire.lacounty.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Annual-Defensible-Space-Notice_012024.pdf" target="_blank"><u>notice
to homeowners</u></a> about defensible space rules and the upcoming zone
zero regulations that illustrate how landscapes might strike that
balance. The images feature stone walkways immediately next to homes,
followed by raised beds made of metal and concrete containing attractive
landscaping. Not quite “quirky” and “charming,” but far from a barren
dystopia.

<h3>
Where insurance fits in
</h3>
<p>
Despite the delay in implementing zone zero, California has tried to
pitch it as part of a strategy to solve the state’s
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/los-angeles-fire-insurance-fair" target="_self"><u>insurance
crisis</u></a>. In 2022, Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara
<a href="https://www.insurance.ca.gov/01-consumers/200-wrr/Safer-from-Wildfires" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>enacted
new rules</u></a> requiring insurance companies to provide discounts to
homeowners who do home hardening retrofits and create defensible space.
</p>
<p>
“That’s terrific,” Dave Jones, the director of the Climate Risk
Initiative at the University of California, Berkeley, and Lara’s
predecessor as insurance commissioner, told me. “But you don’t get the
discount if they won’t write you the insurance.”
</p>
<p>
Jones said the bigger issue is that the models insurance companies use
to decide whether or not to write a policy do not account for fire
mitigation efforts. A homeowner could take every action on the list for
home hardening, create a zone zero, live in a community that’s investing
in aggressive fuels reduction, and so on, and insurance companies could
still deny them coverage. Last year, Jones wrote a bill that would have
required companies to change the models they use to determine coverage
to account for mitigation. Several insurance industry trade groups
opposed the bill,
<a href="https://ains.assembly.ca.gov/system/files/2024-06/sb-1060-becker.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>arguing</u></a>
that it was “premature and impossible to implement given the real-world
data constraints,” and that it was “inconsistent” with the state’s
efforts to “restore a healthy and competitive insurance market.” It
didn’t pass.
</p>
<p>
If following zone zero guidelines meant having a shot at getting
insurance, maybe people would be more open to doing it, Jones argued to
me. But as things stand, that’s not the case. “I don’t think the failure
is so much in the state developing the standards as it is in the lack of
political courage to stand up to the insurance industry and say, hey,
look, enough is enough. We’re going to pass a law to require your models
to account for this.”
</p>
<p>
This past year, the California legislature passed a law giving existing
homes three years, instead of just one, to comply with zone zero rules
once they are finalized, whenever that is. And if the regulations are
finalized this year, it’s possible that some of the rebuilt structures
in the Pacific Palisades and Altadena will have to meet them.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, Valachovic sees hope in fire mitigation work. The narrative
that climate change is driving these destructive wildfires can make
people feel helpless. But there are so many low-cost, simple things
people can do to reduce their exposure. “I just feel like we have a
moral imperative to share practical, reasonable actions that people can
take to make a difference, and to know that with that, the odds improve
substantially.”

finalizes rules banning Chinese, Russian smart cars</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The White House says it has finalized rules that crack down on
Chinese and Russian automobile technology effectively banning all
personal smart cars from the two countries from entering the U.S.
market.</p>
<p>In a White House fact sheet detailing the decision, the Biden
administration Tuesday said that while connected vehicles offer
advantages, the involvement of foreign adversaries such as China and
Russia in their supply chains presents serious risks granting “malign
actors unfettered access to these connected systems and the data they
collect.”</p>
<p>“The Department of Commerce has issued a final rule that will
prohibit the sale and import of connected vehicle hardware and software
systems, as well as completed connected vehicles, from the PRC and
Russia,” the fact sheet said.</p>
<p>PRC is the acronym for China’s official name, the People’s Republic
of China.</p>
<p>Connected vehicles are smart cars that are designed to be convenient
for consumers and provide safety for drivers, passengers, and
pedestrians through the use of many connected parts such as Wi-Fi,
Bluetooth, cellular, and satellite connectivity.</p>
<p>“Cars today aren’t just steel on wheels; they’re computers,” said
Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo when speaking on the rule.</p>
<p>“This is a targeted approach to ensure we keep PRC- and
Russian-manufactured technologies off American roads,” said
Raimondo.</p>
<p>The new rule is the “culmination of a year-long examination” of
potential risks posed by connected vehicles and will “help the United
States defend against the PRC’s cyber espionage and intrusion
operations, which continue to pose a significant threat to U.S. critical
infrastructure and public safety.”</p>
<p>The crackdown on cars follows Washington’s announcement earlier this
month that the U.S. consider new rules aimed at addressing risks posed
by drones that utilize technology from China and Russia.</p>
<p>The U.S. has repeatedly emphasized the need to balance technological
progress with the protection of national security interests.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
The
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/20/politics/biden-first-veto/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>first
veto</u></a> of Joe Biden’s presidency, in March 2023, came on a bill
that would have overturned a Department of Labor rule allowing
retirement funds to consider environment, social, and governance factors
— commonly known as ESG — when making investment decisions. At the time,
it seemed like a good representation of where the issue stood: Though
there was a conservative backlash against ESG investing, much of which
revolves around whether companies are incorporating climate risks into
their planning, the backlash was more bark than bite. ESG not only
seemed here to stay, it was gaining in prominence as more investors and
Wall Street firms realized they could no longer ignore the effects of
climate change on the economic prospects of the companies they were
funding.
</p>
<p>
Less than two years later, the picture looks rather different — at least
politically. There is still
<a href="https://www.morningstar.com/sustainable-investing/global-esg-funds-attract-104-billion-q3-2024" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>over
$3 trillion</u></a> invested in ESG funds worldwide, the vast majority
of it in Europe. But here in the U.S., the backlash has only grown
stronger, and with Donald Trump’s election, there has been a Wall Street
stampede away from public commitments to assess climate risk as a key
component of investment decisions. There’s no way to know how much
long-term effect this change will have on emissions, but the reversal in
the public stance of the financial sector has been swift and intense.
</p>
<p>
Let’s begin with the banks. In the space of a month, the six largest
banks in the United States — Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Wells
Fargo, Citi, Morgan Stanley, and JPMorgan — all
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/jpmorgan-says-leave-net-zero-banking-alliance-2025-01-07/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pulled
out</u></a> of the
<a href="https://www.unepfi.org/net-zero-banking/commitment/frequently-asked-questions/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Net-Zero
Banking Alliance</u></a>, an international United Nations-sponsored
group under which member banks commit to pursuing net-zero carbon
emissions from their lending and investments by 2050.
</p>
<p>
While Trump’s election may have been the tipping point, it comes after
an organized campaign waged at the state level over the past couple of
years, as Republican attorneys general have pressured and threatened the
finance industry into abandoning its efforts to contribute to the
mitigation of climate change.
</p>
<p>
In the spring of 2023, 23 Republican AGs
<a href="https://attorneygeneral.utah.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-05-15-NZIA-Letter.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>threatened</u></a>
the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance (like the NZBA, a UN-sponsored group)
with antitrust action,
<a href="https://attorneygeneral.utah.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-05-15-NZIA-Letter.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>saying</u></a>
it was pursuing “an activist climate agenda.” Companies began
<a href="https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2023/04/19/717287.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>leaving</u></a>,
and a year later, the group
<a href="https://www.unepfi.org/insurance/insurance/projects/net-zero-insurance-alliance/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>disbanded</u></a>.
The effort against the banking alliance followed a similar pattern:
<a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/files/divisions/public-finance/ABC%20Letter%20Draft%20Net%20Zero%20Alliance%2010.17.23.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Threats</u></a>
of legal action from Republican attorneys general, followed by a
pullback from the banks.
</p>
<p>
Like insurance companies and banks, investment firms are clearly feeling
the pressure. BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world,
recently
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/blackrock-quits-climate-group-wall-streets-latest-environmental-step-back-2025-01-09/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pulled
out</u></a> of the Net-Zero Asset Managers Initiative, a group similar
to those for insurers and banks, citing “legal inquiries from various
public officials.” That included a
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/blackrock-state-street-vanguard-sued-by-republican-states-over-climate-accords-2024-11-27/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>lawsuit</u></a>
filed by Texas and 10 other Republican states, alleging that BlackRock
and other firms were unfairly harming the fossil fuel industry with
their investment decisions. This week, the NZAMI released
<a href="https://www.netzeroassetmanagers.org/update-from-the-net-zero-asset-managers-initiative/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
statement</u></a> saying that in response to “different regulatory and
client expectations,” it is launching an internal review, and meanwhile
“suspending activities to track signatory implementation and reporting”
of climate goals.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, Republicans in Congress have been
<a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/media/press-releases/jordan-and-massie-demand-information-over-130-companies-surrounding-their" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>issuing</u></a>
reports and press releases condemning the “woke ESG cartel,” which they
claim consists of “left-wing activists and major financial institutions
that collude to impose radical environmental, social, and governance
goals on American companies.” After the election, those Republicans now
control both houses of Congress, as well as the White House.
</p>
<p>
So it’s a good bet that the pressure on the finance industry from
Washington will only increase, especially with a new administration that
combines dismissal of climate change with an eagerness to bring
corporations to heel. In many cases, key administration positions will
be staffed by former employees of the very fossil fuel companies that
oppose real climate action, or at least by their allies. One vivid
example: Lee Zeldin, Trump’s nominee to lead the Environmental
Protection Agency,
<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/trumps-pick-to-lead-epa-was-paid-tens-of-thousands-to-write-op-eds-criticizing-climate-policies-and-esg/ar-BB1rk50z" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>revealed</u></a>
in disclosure forms that he was paid tens of thousands of dollars to pen
op-eds attacking ESG investing.
<a href="https://extapps2.oge.gov/201/Presiden.nsf/PAS+Index/B4586F4FD7718EA485258C0F00336FAE/%24FILE/Zeldin%2C%20Lee%20%20final278.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>His
forms</u></a> list only the PR firms that paid him, not the clients on
whose behalf they did so.
</p>
<p>
These pullbacks from climate pledges are clearly motivated by fear, and
may even be taken with regret by some of the CEOs making the decisions.
If that is the case, however, it is not a universal sentiment. The
<em><em>Financial Times</em></em>
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/cf876b19-8c69-498b-95f5-d018618d99ec" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reports</u></a>
that “Some Wall Streeters also feel able to embrace making money openly,
without nodding to any broader social goals. ‘Most of us don’t have to
kiss ass because, like Trump, we love America and capitalism,’ one
said.”
</p>
<p>
Here’s the kicker: These alliances that are now wavering began with few
requirements in order to bring in as many participants as possible; only
later would companies have to meet more reporting and emissions goals.
But “as accountability mechanisms started to come into play, at the same
time we started to see the conservative backlash against it,” Tensie
Whelan, founding director of the NYU Stern Center for Sustainable
Business, told me. Now, “they’re all running scared.”
</p>
<p>
Though some critics charge that ESG is mostly about greenwashing, many
financial actors — banks, asset managers, investors — have embraced
greener investing because it is both good for the planet and good for
business. If a company is exposed to climate risk but fails to account
for it in its long-term strategy, that company is probably a bad
investment. Investments incorporating sustainability considerations tend
to perform as well or better than ordinary investment vehicles — the
<a href="https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/additional-material/brochure-sp-500-esg-index.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>S&amp;P
500 ESG Index</u></a>, for instance, has outperformed the standard
S&amp;P 500. And a

by HIP Investor</u></a> showed that public pension funds in blue states
that incorporated ESG factors have generated higher returns than
red-state funds that eschewed them.

“I would hope and assume that at some point there will be some
class-action suits” against states that have turned away from ESG
investing, and in so doing cost taxpayers money, Whelan said.
<a href="https://news.ballotpedia.org/2024/10/21/republican-states-pass-17-anti-esg-laws-democratic-states-pass-8-pro-esg-in-2024/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>In
2024</u></a>, 17 Republican-run states passed bills restricting ESG
investments with state funds, while eight Democratic states passed
pro-ESG bills.
</p>
<p>
When banks or investment firms abandon climate alliances or pull back
from climate goals in other ways, they nearly always put out statements
reiterating their commitment to reducing emissions. While those might be
sincere, the most important message is that the threats and pressure are
effective. And that’s what has become so clear: Conservatives are
energized and emboldened to roll back corporate efforts to address
climate change, and are using every tool they have — legislation,
litigation, threats, public pressure campaigns — to destroy those
initiatives.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, there is plenty of room for pressure from the other side.
Whelan notes that blue states “are very adamant about having key
sustainability criteria” in their investments, and as younger
generations accumulate more wealth, they are more likely to demand
sustainability where they put their money. As for Wall Street responding
to political pressure by backing away from its climate goals, “this
retrenchment is unfortunate,” Whelan told me, but “I do think it’s
temporary, and I think they know that. Because they’re not stupid.”

House Speaker orders Capitol flags raised to full height for Trump
inauguration</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson on Tuesday ordered
that flags at the Capitol be raised to their full height on Inauguration
Day, pausing a 30-day flag-lowering order following the death of former
President Jimmy Carter.</p>
<p>The Republican leader’s decision means that President-elect Donald
Trump will not take the oath of office for his second term under a
half-staff flag, a prospect that he had previously complained about.</p>
<p>It mirrors actions taken in recent days by some Republican governors
who have announced that flags in their states would be raised on
Inauguration Day to mark Trump’s second term.</p>
<p>Alabama Governor Kay Ivey and Tennessee Governor Bill Lee did so on
Tuesday, noting in social media posts that U.S. flags across their
states would be relowered on Jan. 21 in honor of Carter. Texas Governor
Greg Abbott issued a similar notice on Monday.</p>
<p>The 30-day flag-lowering period, set into motion with President Joe
Biden’s order, affects flags at federal government buildings and their
grounds, as well as at U.S. embassies and other facilities abroad,
including military installations and vessels. It runs through Jan. 28,
which encompasses Trump’s inauguration and first week in office. In line
with Biden’s order, governors throughout the country issued their own
orders to govern flags in their respective states.</p>
<p>The incoming president has expressed consternation that flags would
still be lowered when he takes the oath, and it’s possible that he could
order the overall reversal of Biden’s decision once he’s installed as
president on Jan. 20.</p>
<p>“Democrats are all ‘giddy’” about the notion that flags will be
lowered on Inauguration Day, Trump wrote Jan. 3 on social media.</p>
<p>“Nobody wants to see this,” Trump wrote. He added that “no American
can be happy about it. Let’s see how it plays out. MAKE AMERICA GREAT
AGAIN!”</p>
<p>Trump has already acted over the flags that he can control: at his
home in Florida. In the days following Carter’s burial, a large U.S.
flag at Trump’s private Mar-a-Lago club was observed flying at its full
height, despite an order from Florida Governor Ron DeSantis that mirrors
Biden’s.</p>
<p>As of Tuesday, DeSantis had not made alterations to the flag order in
his own state.</p>
<p>The U.S. flag code lays out parameters for lowering the U.S. flag to
half-staff, including a 30-day period for current or former presidents
to cover flags at federal government buildings and their grounds, as
well as at U.S. embassies and other facilities abroad, including
military installations and vessels.</p>

id="despite-international-concerns-doctors-say-china-flu-like-virus-is-no-covid-19">Despite
international concerns, doctors say China flu-like virus is no
COVID-19</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Reports of rising cases of a flu-like illness in China, where
COVID-19 was first detected five years ago, sparked international
concerns about the potential for another worldwide pandemic.</p>
<p>But medical experts say the human metapneumovirus, known as HMPV, is
no COVID-19.</p>
<p>“That’s a routine virus that commonly causes upper respiratory tract
infections, such as bronchitis that might cause cough and sinuses,” says
Dr. Paul Auwaerter, clinical director of the Johns Hopkins University
School of Medicine’s division of infectious diseases. “I don’t feel we
should be especially worried about it. It is not nearly as serious as
influenza or COVID disease.”</p>
<p>HMPV is a common virus that has been around at least since 2001.
Children under five, particularly infants, and adults over 65 —
especially those with health problems — can sometimes become seriously
ill from HMPV. However, for most other people, the symptoms are
generally mild.</p>
<p>“Almost everyone has been infected with this virus by the age of
five,” Auwaerter says. “HMPV has been here for, you know, a long time
[and] has infected millions of people that already have immunity. It’s
not as though this is a brand-new virus that might cause devastating
problems.”</p>
<p>On Sunday, China said cases of HMPV had declined among residents in
its northern provinces, where the respiratory infections were rising.
Chinese health officials say the number of patients seeking medical help
remains lower compared to the same period last year. Still, some health
experts are calling for more transparency in order to reduce the spread
of rumors and misunderstandings.</p>
<p>“International scholars are calling on China to disclose pathogen
information and conduct genetic research to confirm that it is not a new
virus. Even if it is an old virus, it could still be a new variant,”
Dr. Ho Mei-Shang, a research fellow emeritus at the Institute of
Biomedical Sciences in Taipei, told VOA’s Mandarin Service.</p>
<p>Ho said China’s COVID-19 prevention measures during the pandemic
curbed the spread of diseases, which led to a decline in herd immunity,
potentially causing the current surge in cases over a short time
period.</p>
<p>Auwaerter agrees.</p>
<p>“They stayed home, refrained from work, wore masks,” he says. “So,
the usual cycles of acquiring an infection, for example, during the
respiratory season of winter, people didn’t get infected. So, their
specific immunity, they weren’t boosted, and so there was a larger
population that might be more susceptible.”</p>
<p>There is no real treatment or vaccine for HMPV. Doctors say any
patients who have trouble breathing should seek medical help.</p>

id="trump-says-he-will-create-an-external-revenue-service-agency-to-collect-tariff-income">Trump
says he will create an ‘External Revenue Service’ agency to collect
tariff income</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday announced plans
to create a new agency called the External Revenue Service to collect
tariffs and other revenues from foreign nations.</p>
<p>“We will begin charging those that make money off of us with Trade,
and they will start paying,” Trump said Tuesday on his social media
site, Truth Social. He compared his planned creation to the Internal
Revenue Service, which is the nation’s domestic tax collector.</p>
<p>The creation of a new agency requires an act of Congress, and
Republicans hold the majority of both the House and the Senate.</p>
<p>Trump, who has vowed to shrink the size of government, would be
creating a new agency to perform functions already handled by existing
agencies, including the Commerce Department and the Customs and Border
Patrol, which collect duties and revenues from other nations.</p>
<p>The president-elect has tapped two business titans to lead his
Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, a nongovernmental task
force assigned to find ways to fire federal workers, cut programs and
slash federal regulations, all part of what he calls his “Save America”
agenda for a second term in the White House.</p>
<p>Billionaire Elon Musk and fellow entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy are
leading the DOGE’s ambitious efforts to reduce the size and scope of the
federal government.</p>
<p>Tariffs, with the threat of a potential 25% levy on all goods from
allies like Canada and Mexico and 60% on goods from China, have become a
benchmark of Trump’s economic agenda as he heads into his second
term.</p>
<p>Economists have said the cost of the tariffs will be passed on to
consumers, and are generally skeptical of them, considering them a
mostly inefficient way for governments to raise money and promote
prosperity.</p>
<p>Democratic lawmakers were quick to criticize the External Revenue
Service plan.</p>
<p>“No amount of silly rebranding will hide the fact that Trump is
planning a multi-trillion-dollar tax hike on American families and small
businesses to pay for another round of tax handouts to the rich,” Oregon
Sen. Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said
in a statement.</p>

Cabinet choice faces tough first day of questions on Capitol Hill</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump’s choice to lead the U.S.
Department of Defense, told U.S. lawmakers Tuesday he would bring back
accountability and “a warrior ethos” to the nation’s military.</p>
<p>In the first confirmation hearing in the U.S. Senate for Trump’s
Cabinet secretary picks, Hegseth faced criticism from Senate Democrats
over his statements about women and transgender people serving in the
military, as well as allegations of sexual assault, drunkenness and
financial mismanagement of two nonprofits serving U.S. veterans that he
led.</p>
<p>“This nomination is unconventional. The nominee is unconventional,
just like that New York developer who rode down the escalator in 2015 to
announce his candidacy for president,” Senate Armed Services Chairman
Roger Wicker, a Republican, said Tuesday.</p>
<p>“Mr. Hegseth will bring energy and fresh ideas to shake up the
bureaucracy. He will focus relentlessly on the war fighter and the
military’s core missions, deterring wars and winning the ones we must
fight,” Wicker continued.</p>
<p>Hegseth, a former television host at the conservative Fox News
channel, also served as an officer in the Army National Guard in Iraq,
Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay and is the author of several books.</p>
<p>“I don’t have a similar biography to defense secretaries of the last
30 years,” Hegseth told senators in his opening statement. “But as
President Trump also told me, we’ve repeatedly placed people atop the
Pentagon with the supposed right credentials, whether they are retired
generals, academics or defense contractor executives. And where has it
gotten us?”</p>
<p>Hegseth said his priorities, if he is confirmed as secretary of
defense, would focus on the threat posed by China and defense of the
homeland while reorienting the United States away from entanglements in
the Middle East. He also pledged to restore morale and end diversity
initiatives that he sees as harmful to establishing a merit-based
military.</p>
<p>“Getting anything that doesn’t contribute to our democracy out of how
decisions are made inside the Pentagon,” Hegseth said of the ways he
sees his potential role. “What gender you are, what race you are, your
views on climate change, your conscience and your faith should have no
bearing on whether you get promoted, or whether you’re selected to go to
West Point, or where you go to school. Only thing that should matter is
how capable are you at your job. How excellent are you at your job.”</p>
<p>If confirmed, Hegseth would be the first secretary of defense to have
served as a junior officer on the front lines and the first secretary
from the generation that fought in post-9/11 wars.</p>
<p>Senate Democrats said Hegseth’s experience running two nonprofits
benefiting military veterans with fewer than 100 employees was not
sufficient experience.</p>
<p>“We’re hiring you to be the CEO of one of the most complex, largest
organizations in the world. We’re the board of directors here. I don’t
know of any corporate board of directors that would hire a CEO, that
said, you know, I supervised 100 people before,” said Democratic Senator
Gary Peters.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense has more than 3 million service members and
a budget of $857 billion.</p>
<p>Senator Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the committee, said that the
FBI background investigation into Hegseth was “insufficient” and that
there are still FBI obligations to talk to people.”</p>
<p>“You lack the character and composure and competence to hold the
position of defense,” Reed said, noting that he has voted for all nine
previous nominees for secretary of defense, including nominees during
Trump’s first term.</p>
<p>All Cabinet nominees undergo a background check and an ethics
review.</p>
<p>Hegseth faces allegations of financial mismanagement of the two
nonprofits where he served as executive director: Vets for Freedom and
Concerned Veterans for America.</p>
<p>After a 2009 audit of Vets for Freedom, Hegseth acknowledged the
organization was $500,000 in debt, and he was demoted. During his time
at Concerned Veterans for America, Hegseth faced whistleblower
allegations of personal misconduct and financial mismanagement, which
resulted in an investigation and a report.</p>
<p>Hegseth said the allegations were part of a coordinated smear
campaign by left-wing media and largely came from anonymous sources.</p>
<p>“We undertook this responsibility with obligation to the troops to do
right by them, for our war fighters. And what became very evident to us
from the beginning, there was a coordinated smear campaign orchestrated
in the media against us that was clear from moment one. And what we knew
is, it wasn’t about me. Most of it was about President Donald Trump,
who’s had to endure the very same thing for much longer amounts of time,
and he endured it — to his credit — in incredibly strong ways,” Hegseth
said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Hegseth has also faced criticism for past remarks about diversity in
the U.S. military.</p>
<p>Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren said Hegseth had done “a very big
about-face in a short period of time” since Trump chose him to serve as
secretary of defense.</p>
<p>“For 12 years, you were quite open about your views, and your views
were consistently the same: Women are inferior soldiers, sailors,
marines, airmen and guardians. Then on Nov. 9, 2024, just 32 days after
your last public comments saying that women absolutely should not be in
combat, you declare that ‘some of our greatest warriors are women,’”
Warren said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Five women who served in combat wrote letters of support in favor of
Hegseth’s nomination.</p>
<p>“These women represent diverse viewpoints, from a retired colonel
with over 25 years of service to an active-duty Navy Surface Warfare
commander to a senior for Mr. Hegseth, and comment on his focus on merit
war-fighting readiness, military training status and the warrior ethos,”
Wicker said.</p>
<p>Hegseth pledged that women would have access to ground combat roles
during his tenure as secretary of defense.</p>
<p>“Given the standards remain high, and we’ll have a review to ensure
standards have not been eroded in any one of these cases,” he said.</p>
<p>Hegseth also faces allegations of sexual assault and public
drunkenness during his time at Fox News.</p>
<p>Cabinet nominees must receive a majority of votes to be confirmed.
The U.S. Senate is composed of 53 Republicans, 45 Democrats and two
independents.</p>

id="world-economic-forum-says-trump-to-take-part-virtually-in-davos-meeting-days-after-inauguration">World
Economic Forum says Trump to take part virtually in Davos meeting, days
after inauguration</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>GENEVA — U.S. President Donald Trump will take part virtually in the
World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos just days after his
inauguration, the forum president said Tuesday. </p>
<p>Borge Brende, a former Norwegian foreign minister who heads the
Geneva-based organization, noted that Trump had twice attended the elite
gathering of business, government and other leaders in person during his
first term. </p>
<p>“On Thursday afternoon, he will join us digitally, online, live in a
dialogue with our participants,” Brende told reporters Tuesday as he
presented the five-day program that will start Monday — the day of
Trump’s inauguration. </p>
<p>“We think that will be a very special moment,” he added, notably to
help learn the administration’s “policy priorities.” </p>
<p>Brende said he didn’t know whether Elon Musk, the multibillionaire
who is poised to co-lead Trump’s new Department of Government
Efficiency, would attend, but said the forum expects “additional,
high-level representation” from the administration once confirmation
processes for Trump’s nominees get underway in the U.S. Senate as early
as Monday. </p>
<p>Forum organizers say a record of around 900 business leaders,
including from important emerging markets, will take part in the annual
meeting this year, which is expected to draw nearly 3,000 participants
from over 130 countries. </p>
<p>With climate change, war, global tensions, economic uncertainty and
other issues in mind, Brende acknowledged that the 55th annual meeting
of the forum will take place “against the most complicated geopolitical
backdrop in generations.” </p>
<p>“But still in that fragmented and partly polarized world, there are
still areas where we can collaborate and … we have big opportunities and
responsibilities to find those areas where there is a possibility to
improve the state of the world,” he said. The theme of this year’s
edition is “Collaboration for the Intelligent Age” — a nod to the
growing importance of technology in the world. </p>
<p>The WEF has long been derided as a gathering of world elites who plot
the future at a cushy, snow-bound powwow in the Swiss Alps. Critics
often argue the developing world gets less attention than global powers
and big business in the West or Gulf states. </p>
<p>Forum managing director Mirek Dusek insisted that the number of
businesses from developing countries in the “Global South” was growing,
and the attendance of their leaders was “on parity” with the
participation of leaders in the developed world. </p>
<p>Ursula Von Der Leyen, president of the European Union’s executive
commission, plans to attend the opening day of meetings on Tuesday,
after an introductory gala the night before. Other top envoys include
President Javier Milei of Argentina, President Cyril Ramaphosa of South
Africa, and Chinese Vice-Premier Ding Xuexiang. </p>
<p>The vast array of topics will include the future of Syria — its new
foreign minister is expected to attend — after the fall of President
Bashar al-Assad last month; the fight against climate change; the
threats and promise of artificial intelligence; global trade and
economic growth; and wars in places like Ukraine, Sudan and beyond. </p>
<p>“We are ready to roll up our sleeves to make the best out of a
situation where we are faced with many, many challenges,” Brende
said.</p>

<li>Supreme Court rejects Utah lawsuit that threatened public lands

On Monday, the Supreme Court refused to hear a lawsuit brought by Utah
attempting to seize control of the “unappropriated” federal lands in the
state. Opponents argued that the lawsuit, if successful, would have put
public lands across the West on the path to privatization since Utah and
other states likely couldn’t afford to manage them and would have had to
sell off much of them. However, “while the Court’s decision denying
original review of Utah’s claims is welcome news for our shared public

id="biden-issues-executive-order-for-building-ai-data-centers-on-federal-land">Biden
issues executive order for building AI data centers on federal land</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>— U.S. President Joe Biden issued an executive order Tuesday
directing the development of artificial intelligence data centers on six
federal land sites, with a special focus on powering them with clean
energy and upholding high labor standards. </p>
<p>Biden said in a statement that the United States is the world leader
in AI, but cannot take that lead for granted. </p>
<p>“We will not let America be out-built when it comes to the technology
that will define the future, nor should we sacrifice critical
environmental standards and our shared efforts to protect clean air and
clean water,” Biden said. </p>
<p>The order calls for the Department of Defense and Department of
Energy to each identify three suitable sites where private companies
will lease the land, pay for the construction and operation of the data
centers and ensure the supply of enough clean energy to fully power the
sites. </p>
<p>The developers will also have to buy “an appropriate share” of
semiconductors produced in the United States to help ensure there is a
“robust domestic semiconductor supply chain,” the White House said. </p>
<p>In addition to identifying the sites, the federal government will
also commit under the order to expedite the permitting process for the
data center construction. </p>
<p>Senior administration officials, in a phone call with journalists
previewing the order, highlighted the national security need for the
United States to have its own powerful AI infrastructure, both to
protect it for its own use but also to prevent adversaries such as China
from possessing those capabilities. </p>
<p>“From the national security standpoint, it’s really critical to find
a pathway for building the data centers and power infrastructure to
support frontier AI operations here in the United States to ensure that
the most powerful AI models continue to be trained and stored securely
here in the United States,” an official said. </p>
<p>A senior administration official cited the priority of making sure
the AI industry had an anchor in the United States to avoid repeating
the history of other technologies that moved offshore to areas with
lower labor and environmental standards as well. </p>
<p>AI chip restrictions </p>
<p>Tuesday’s order comes a day after the Biden administration announced
new restrictions on the export of the most advanced artificial
intelligence chips and proprietary parameters used to govern the
interactions of users with AI systems.    </p>
<p>The rule, which will undergo a 120-day period for public comments,
comes in response to what administration officials described as a need
to protect national security while also clarifying the rules under which
companies in trusted partner countries could access the emerging
technology in order to promote innovation.   </p>
<p>“Over the coming years, AI will become really ubiquitous in every
business application in every industry around the world, with enormous
potential for enhanced productivity and societal, health care and
economic benefits,” Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told reporters.
“That being said, as AI becomes more powerful, the risks to our national
security become even more intense.”   </p>
<p>A senior administration official said the new rule will not include
any restrictions on chip sales to Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark,
Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New
Zealand, Norway, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, the United Kingdom
or the United States.   </p>
<p>The rules build on 2023 curbs limiting the export of certain AI chips
to China, a strategic competitor in the production of advanced
semiconductors. Beijing attacked the new U.S. AI edict as a “flagrant
violation” of international trade rules.  </p>
<p>China’s Ministry of Commerce said the Biden administration
announcement “is another example of the generalization of the concept of
national security and the abuse of export control, and a flagrant
violation of international multilateral economic and trade rules.”  </p>
<p>Beijing said it would “take necessary measures to firmly safeguard
its legitimate rights and interests.” </p>
<p>Countries that are under U.S. arms embargoes are already subject to
export restrictions on advanced AI chips, but a senior administration
official said they will now be under restrictions for the transfer of
the most powerful closed weight AI models.    </p>
<p>The weights in an AI model determine how it processes the inputs from
a user and determines what to provide the user as a response, according
to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration. In a
closed weight system, those parameters are secret, unlike with an open
weight system in which users could see the settings the model is using
to make its decisions.    </p>
<p>Most countries — those not included in the closed partner or arms
embargo lists — will not face licensing requirements for obtaining the
equivalent of 1,700 of the most advanced AI chips currently available,
nor for any less advanced chips.   </p>
<p>Companies in the United States and allied countries will not face
restrictions in using the most powerful closed weight AI systems,
provided they are stored under adequate security, a senior
administration official said.</p>

braces for Trump inauguration with fortress-like fencing, extra
police</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — With 48 km of tall black temporary fencing, 25,000 law
enforcement officers and security checkpoints set up to process hundreds
of thousands of spectators, Washington is braced for President-elect
Donald Trump’s inauguration next week.</p>
<p>The Monday swearing-in on the steps of the U.S. Capitol and parade to
the White House will follow a weekend featuring protests by Trump’s
opponents and parties and rallies by the Republican’s supporters.</p>
<p>The inauguration follows a campaign marked by two attempts on Trump’s
life — including one from a would-be assassin who nicked his ear with a
bullet — and a pair of New Year’s Day attacks on ordinary Americans. In
one, 14 people were killed and dozens injured when a U.S. Army veteran
rammed a truck into a crowd of New Year’s Eve revelers in New Orleans.
The same day, an active-duty U.S. Army soldier detonated a Tesla
Cybertruck outside a Trump-branded hotel in Las Vegas, killing
himself.</p>
<p>“We are in a higher-threat environment,” said U.S. Secret Service
Special Agent in Charge Matt McCool at a Monday press briefing.</p>
<p>The inauguration itself, when Trump formally takes the oath of office
with members of Congress, the Supreme Court, his incoming administration
and tens of thousands of others looking on, will take place on the
Capitol steps, facing the Washington Monument.</p>
<p>That is the same spot where, on Jan. 6, 2021, thousands of Trump
supporters smashed windows, fought with police and sent lawmakers
running for their lives in an attempt to overturn his 2020 election loss
to Democratic President Joe Biden.</p>
<p>Trump’s 2024 election rival, Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris,
conceded her defeat in the Nov. 5 contest, unlike Trump who continues to
falsely maintain that his loss was the result of fraud.</p>
<p>Fear of lone wolf</p>
<p>Security officials said they were not aware of any specific,
coordinated threats to the inauguration. What they are worried about is
lone wolves, such as the New Orleans attacker, or two separate incidents
last week. In one, a man was arrested for trying to bring a machete into
the Capitol. In the other, a man was arrested for trying to ignite a
fire near the Capitol, according to U.S. Capitol Police.</p>
<p>“That threat of the lone actor remains the biggest justification for
us being at this heightened state of alert throughout the next week,”
U.S. Capitol Police Chief Thomas Manger told the security briefing.</p>
<p>The FBI and Department of Homeland Security on Monday warned police
nationwide of the risk of copycat attacks similar to the New Orleans
incident.</p>
<p>A large chunk of downtown Washington — stretching about 3 km from the
White House to the Capitol — will be closed to vehicular traffic, with
entry points blocked with concrete barriers, garbage trucks and other
heavy items.</p>
<p>The 48 km of 2-meters-tall black fencing, designed to be unclimbable,
will be the longest ever erected in Washington, officials said. Some
7,800 National Guard troops and 4,000 officers brought in from other
police departments around the country will reinforce security.</p>
<p>While some residents of the city, where 90% of voters cast ballots
for Harris over Trump, were readying to leave for the holiday weekend or
hunker down at home to avoid the gridlock, tens of thousands of people
were expected to descend upon the city for celebrations and
protests.</p>
<p>About 70% of Washington’s 34,500 hotel rooms were booked for the
night of the inauguration and the night before as of last week,
according to data from Smith Travel Research and shared with Reuters by
Destination DC, Washington’s official tourism organization. Hotel
occupancy was at about 95% for Trump’s 2017 inauguration, and about 78%
for former President Barack Obama’s second inauguration in 2013.</p>
<p>Marches and rallies</p>
<p>Trump’s 2017 inauguration was marked by massive protests and
counter-protests. His former spokesman, Sean Spicer, famously began his
tenure by claiming — contrary to photographic evidence — that the crowd
on the grassy National Mall was “the largest audience ever to witness an
inauguration — period.”</p>
<p>The Women’s March the following day drew hundreds of thousands of
people onto the streets of Washington — and even more in pop-up
solidarity events that took place around the country.</p>
<p>A far smaller crowd of 25,000 people is expected to take part in the
anti-Trump People’s March on DC on Saturday, Metropolitan Police Chief
Pamela Smith said on Monday.</p>
<p>Thousands are expected to show up for nearly a dozen other protests
or rallies that local officials have permitted between Saturday and
Monday, including a Trump rally at the 20,000-seat Capital One Arena on
Sunday.</p>
<p>Juliette Kayyem, a professor at Harvard Kennedy School who served as
a homeland security official during the Obama administration, said
officials appeared to follow standard practice in planning for all
possibilities.</p>
<p>“What you’re planning for is a worst-case scenario, but my suspicion
is you’re not going to get it, which is good,” Kayyem said. “In terms of
planning, it’s always easier to ratchet down than ratchet up.”</p>

id="winners-of-nobel-and-world-food-prizes-seek-new-ways-to-grow-food">153
winners of Nobel and World Food prizes seek new ways to grow food</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>DES MOINES, Iowa — More than 150 recipients of the Nobel and World
Food prizes released an open letter Tuesday calling for a dramatic
increase in research and a commitment to new food distribution efforts
with a goal of producing more crops and avoiding a global hunger crisis
in coming decades.</p>
<p>The letter notes that an estimated 700 million people now are “food
insecure and desperately poor” but that without a “moonshot” effort to
grow more and different kinds of food, far more people will be in dire
need of food because of climate change and population growth.</p>
<p>“As difficult and as uncomfortable as it might be to imagine,
humanity is headed towards an even more food insecure, unstable world by
mid-century than exists today, worsened by a vicious cycle of conflict
and food insecurity,” states the letter, signed by 153 recipients of the
two prizes. “Climate change is projected to decrease the productivity of
most major staples when substantial increases are needed to feed a world
which will add another 1.5 billion people to its population by
2050.”</p>
<p>Corn production in Africa is expected to decline and much of the
world could see more soil degradation and water shortages, the letter
says.</p>
<p>“We are not on track to meet future food needs. Not even close,” it
adds.</p>
<p>The letter grew from a meeting of food accessibility experts last
fall. Despite the potential gloom, it holds out hope for an optimistic
vision of the future if people take needed actions. The letter says that
a dramatic increase in research funding coupled with more effective ways
to share information and distribute food could prevent a hunger
crisis.</p>
<p>Brian Schmidt, who won the Nobel Prize in physics in 2011, said the
need to dramatically increase food production in the coming decades is a
huge challenge. He calls it a “destination with destiny,” but one that
can be achieved with proper funding to enhance existing knowledge as
well as global leadership.</p>
<p>“It is an imminently solvable problem. It is a problem that will
affect billions of people in 25 years. It is a problem that to solve it,
there are no losers, only winners,” Schmidt said in an interview. “All
we have to do is do it.”</p>
<p>Schmidt said he hopes governments in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere
can commit to solving the problem, but he thinks private groups like the
Gates Foundation may need to take the lead in funding initial steps that
will draw attention and prompt action by politicians.</p>
<p>The letter calls for “transformational efforts” such as enhancing
photosynthesis in essential crops such as wheat and rice, developing
crops that are not as reliant on chemical fertilizers and lengthening
the shelf life of fruits and vegetables.</p>
<p>Cynthia Rosenzweig, a climate research scientist at NASA who won the
World Food Prize in 2022, said in an interview that researchers are
already making progress toward breakthroughs, but their work needs to be
turbocharged with more funding and emphasis from world leaders.</p>
<p>“It’s not that we have to dream up new solutions,” Rosenzweig said.
“The solutions are very much being tested but in order to actually take
them from the lab out into the agriculture regions of the world, we
really do need the moonshot approach.”</p>
<p>The term moonshot refers to an unprecedented effort, stemming from
President John F. Kennedy’s call in 1962 for Americans to rocket to the
Moon. Rosenzweig, noting she works for NASA, said meeting the food needs
of a growing population will take the kind of commitment the U.S. made
in achieving Kennedy’s goal of reaching the Moon.</p>
<p>“Look at how the scientists had to come together. The engineers had
to be part of it. The funding had to come together as well as the
general public,” she said. “That base of support has to be there as
well.”</p>

special counsel report says prosecutors had enough evidence to convict
Trump in 2020 election case</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>In a report to Congress released early Tuesday, special counsel Jack
Smith said his office had sufficient evidence to “obtain and sustain” a
trial conviction of President-elect Donald Trump for efforts to overturn
Trump’s loss to President Joe Biden in the 2020 election.</p>
<p>Smith said Trump “resorted to a series of criminal efforts to retain
power” after it became clear that he had lost and that legal ways to
challenge the results had failed.</p>
<p>“This included attempts to induce state officials to ignore true vote
counts; to manufacture fraudulent slates of presidential electors in
seven states that he had lost; to force Justice Department officials and
his own Vice President, Michael R. Pence, to act in contravention of
their oaths and to instead advance Mr. Trump’s personal interests; and,
on January 6 , 2021, to direct an angry mob to the United States Capitol
to obstruct the congressional certification of the presidential election
and then leverage rioters,” Smith said in his report.</p>
<p>Smith said Trump acted both in his private capacity as an election
candidate, as well as with the help of multiple co-conspirators, and
that Trump tried to use “the power and authority of the United States
Government in furtherance of his scheme.”</p>
<p>The report further says that Trump’s false claims, such as votes
being cast by large numbers of dead people or ineligible voters, or that
voting machines had changed votes for Trump into votes for Biden, were
“demonstrably and, in many cases, obviously false.”</p>
<p>Trump has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and attacked the special
counsel’s work as politically motivated.</p>
<p>He responded to the report’s release early Tuesday with a post on his
Truth Social platform calling Smith “a lamebrain prosecutor.”</p>
<p>“Deranged Jack Smith was unable to successfully prosecute the
Political Opponent of his ‘boss,’ Crooked Joe Biden, so he ends up
writing yet another ‘Report’ based on information that the Unselect
Committee of Political Hacks and Thugs ILLEGALLY DESTROYED AND DELETED,
because it showed how totally innocent I was, and how completely guilty
Nancy Pelosi, and others, were,” Trump said.</p>
<p>Trump is set to be inaugurated for a new term next week after
defeating Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election. During the
2024 campaign, Trump denied he lost the 2020 vote, including in a
September debate with Harris. </p>
<p>Tuesday’s report release came a day after U.S. District Judge Aileen
Cannon cleared the Justice Department to make public the portion of
Smith’s report that dealt with Trump’s efforts to cling to power.</p>
<p>Judge Cannon, who was appointed by Trump, had earlier blocked the
release of Smith’s full report, which also includes an unreleased
section about accusations that Trump illegally retained classified
documents after he left office.</p>
<p>Smith sought to prosecute Trump on both matters, while Trump denied
wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Judge Cannon dismissed the classified documents case in July, ruling
that Smith was illegally appointed.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court also ruled in July that presidents have broad
immunity from prosecution for official acts, which blunted Smith’s
efforts in the election interference case.</p>
<p>After Trump defeated Harris, the Justice Department dropped both
cases against Trump, citing longstanding policy against prosecuting a
sitting U.S. leader.</p>

id="california-winds-increase-posing-new-wildfire-threats">California
winds increase, posing new wildfire threats</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Winds increased in Southern California Tuesday morning, posing new
challenges for firefighters trying to extinguish raging, out-of-control
blazes in Los Angeles that have killed at least 24 people and left at
least another 24 missing.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service posted an exceptionally rare red flag
warning for “particularly dangerous” weather that could lead to
“explosive fire growth.”</p>
<p>Forecasters said wind gusts in Los Angeles and Ventura counties could
hit about 70 to 110 kilometers an hour, with the fires also boosted by
low humidity. The same conditions are expected to continue into
Wednesday.  </p>
<p>The winds could strengthen parts of the two major blazes that are
still burning in Los Angeles County, undermining the incremental gains
that firefighters have made in controlling the fires or igniting new
ones.</p>
<p>Authorities said one of the blazes, the Palisades fire, was larger
than 9,300 hectares but only 17% contained as of early Tuesday, while
the Eaton fire, containing more than 5,600 hectares, was 35%
contained.</p>
<p>More than 100,000 people have been forced from their homes and whole
neighborhoods flattened, much like the war zones American television
viewers have become accustomed to seeing in Ukraine and Gaza.</p>
<p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass told reporters she took an aerial tour
of the affected areas on Monday with Fire Chief Kristin Crowley, saying,
“The massive, massive destruction is unimaginable until you actually see
it.”</p>
<p>Anish Mahajan, a Los Angeles County public health official, told
residents to wear N95 or P100 masks if they see high winds dispersing
ash. “Ash is not just dirt,” Mahajan said. “It is hazardous fine
dust.”</p>
<p>One concern is that electrical infrastructure could spark new fires,
as has happened in California wildfires in the past. The Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power said Monday night that it could shut off
power for customers in areas with high fire risk as a precautionary
measure. Another utility, Southern California Edison, said it had
already shut off power to more than 60,000 customers.</p>
<p>Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said Monday that
firefighters were “absolutely better prepared” than when a series of
wildfires rapidly emerged last week, but that the wind gusts could force
authorities to ground aircraft critical to the firefighting effort.</p>
<p>Such restrictions were in place for part of last week as four major
fires burned. Together, those blazes scorched more than 160 square
kilometers.</p>
<p>Firefighters have brought one fire fully under control, while another
north of Los Angeles was 97% contained.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden on Monday pledged additional federal support and
said during a briefing at the White House, “We’re going to keep doing
everything possible to help you get through this.”</p>
<p>“It was a heartbreaking weekend for a lot of people in Los Angeles,”
Biden said. “Ash was raining down like snow; homes burned to the ground.
Thousands of those homes are gone. And we learned we lost more of our
fellow Americans. So, let’s say again to the people of Los Angeles,
we’re with you.”</p>
<p>The president also praised the work of emergency responders.</p>
<p>“Los Angeles is the City of Angels, and you’re now the angels,” Biden
said. “You’re the angels literally saving people’s lives, and we owe
you.”</p>
<p>Biden said the federal government was providing aid to help with
overtime pay for firefighters, debris removal and temporary shelters. He
said the region will need tens of billions of dollars to recover and
called on Congress to “step up” and provide funding.</p>
<p>Some Republican leaders in Congress have suggested federal aid be
given only with conditions, as they criticized Democratic California
leaders for what they allege is mismanaging water and forest
resources.</p>
<p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has said in recent days that the
state has increased its firefighter force and forest management efforts
since he took office in 2019.</p>
<p>On Monday, a lawsuit filed against Southern California Edison claims
the utility’s equipment sparked the deadly Eaton Fire that began January
7.</p>
<p>Edison acknowledged that fire agencies are investigating whether its
equipment may have started a smaller fire in the area that also occurred
that day.</p>
<p>Authorities have not yet determined an official cause for the
fire.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power also was sued on
Monday. The suit claims that the utility failed to properly manage water
supplies critical to fighting the Palisades Fire, which has killed at
least eight people and destroyed thousands of structures, according to
the court filing.</p>

Blue Origin calls off New Glenn launch again, eyes Thursday</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — Jeff Bezos’ rocket company Blue Origin moved
the launch of its New Glenn rocket from Tuesday to Jan. 16, further
pushing back its inaugural attempt to reach orbit and compete with
SpaceX in the satellite launch market.</p>
<p>The company called off its first scheduled launch on Monday after a
technical issue was encountered in the lead-up to its takeoff.</p>
<p>The three-hour launch window opens at 1 a.m. EST (0600 GMT) on
Thursday, Blue Origin said in a post on X.</p>
<p>The development of New Glenn has spanned three Blue Origin CEOs and
faced numerous delays as Elon Musk’s SpaceX grew into an industry
juggernaut with its reusable Falcon 9, the world’s most active
rocket.</p>
<p>New Glenn is more than twice as powerful as a Falcon 9 rocket and has
dozens of customer launch contracts collectively worth billions of
dollars lined up.</p>
<p>The rocket would seek to land New Glenn’s first stage booster on a
sea-fairing barge in the Atlantic Ocean 10 minutes after liftoff, while
the rocket’s second stage continues toward orbit.</p>
<p>“The thing we’re most nervous about is the booster landing,” Bezos,
who founded Blue Origin in 2000, told Reuters in a pre-launch interview
on Sunday.</p>
<p>“Clearly on a first flight you could have an anomaly at any mission
phase, so anything could happen.”</p>

id="supreme-court-rejects-utahs-push-to-wrest-control-of-public-land-from-the-federal-government">Supreme
Court rejects Utah’s push to wrest control of public land from the
federal government</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Monday turned back a push by the
state of Utah to wrest control of vast areas of public land from the
federal government, marking a small victory for land conservation
advocates who worry that similar efforts may escalate in a
Republican-controlled Washington.</p>
<p>The high court refused to let the GOP-controlled state file a lawsuit
seeking to bring the land and its resources under state control. The
decision came in a brief order in which the court did not explain its
reasoning, as is typical. It marks the latest roadblock for states in a
running feud with the U.S. government over who should control huge
swaths of the West and the enormous oil and gas, timber, and other
resources they contain.</p>
<p>Utah’s top state leaders said they have not ruled out taking their
lawsuit to a lower court.</p>
<p>In the Western state known for its rugged mountains popular with
skiers and red-rock vistas that draw throngs of tourists, federal
agencies control almost 70% of the land. Utah argues that local control
would be more responsive and allow the state access to revenue from
taxes and development projects.</p>
<p>The complaint sought control of about half of federal land, which
still amounts to an area nearly as large as South Carolina. The parcels
are used for things like energy production, grazing, mining and
recreation. Utah’s world-famous national parks and national monuments
would have stayed in federal hands.</p>
<p>Monday’s decision by the high court comes as the newly
Republican-controlled Congress adopted a rules package that includes
language allowing lawmakers to more easily transfer or sell off public
lands managed by federal agencies. The rules consider public lands to
have no monetary value, meaning lawmakers will no longer need to account
for lost revenue if they decide to give parcels to states or extractive
industries.</p>
<p>While conservationists applauded the court’s rejection of what they
called a land-grab lawsuit, many remained worried that the efforts will
continue.</p>
<p>Public lands under state control could be vulnerable to
privatization, degradation and oil drilling, said Steve Bloch, legal
director for the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance.</p>
<p>“If successful, Utah’s lawsuit would result in the sale of millions
of acres of public lands in red-rock country to the highest bidder, an
end to America’s system of federal public lands and the dismantling of
the American West as we know it,” Bloch said.</p>
<p>Utah’s Republican Sens. Mike Lee and John Curtis criticized the
court’s decision and promised legislative action. Curtis, who campaigned
on being a climate-conscious Republican, said the people of Utah should
be entrusted to manage the land they have lived on for generations.</p>
<p>“Building roads, moving cattle and cleaning up campgrounds all
require navigating a behemothic bureaucracy that’s stacked up against
the average Utahn,” Curtis said.</p>
<p>In a joint statement with Utah’s Republican legislative leaders and
attorney general, Gov. Spencer Cox said he was disappointed in the
court’s decision to turn away the lawsuit.</p>
<p>“Utah remains able and willing to challenge any BLM land management
decisions that harm Utah,” state leaders said. “We are also heartened to
know the incoming administration shares our commitments to the principle
of ‘multiple use’ for these federal lands and is committed to working
with us to improve land management.”</p>
<p>While lawsuits typically start in federal district courts and
eventually work their way up to the U.S. Supreme Court, disputes
involving states can start at the nation’s highest court if the justices
agree to hear them.</p>
<p>Utah leaders noted that the high court did not comment on the merits
of their arguments or prevent them from filing the lawsuit in a federal
district court. Conservation groups say they’ll remain ready to
challenge any future lawsuits.</p>
<p>“This lawsuit is an assault on the country’s long-standing and
successful history of safeguarding valuable and vulnerable landscapes in
trust for all Americans,” said Chris Hill, who leads the Conservation
Lands Foundation. “And while the Supreme Court’s decision to not hear
the case is a reprieve, we fully expect this small group of anti-public
lands politicians to continue to waste taxpayer dollars and shop their
bad ideas.”</p>
<p>The federal Bureau of Land Management declined to comment.</p>

agencies warn of potential New Orleans copycat attack</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S.
Department of Homeland Security on Monday warned of a potential public
safety threat from violent extremists who might try to copy the New
Year’s Day attack in New Orleans that killed 14 people.</p>
<p>The warning comes a week before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s
Jan. 20 inauguration.</p>
<p>“The FBI and DHS are concerned about possible copycat or retaliatory
attacks due to the persistent appeal of vehicle ramming as a tactic for
aspiring violent extremist attackers,” the agencies said in a
statement.</p>
<p>Early on New Year’s Day, more than a dozen people were killed and a
dozen others injured when a man rammed a rented pickup truck into a
crowd of revelers along Bourbon Street in New Orleans.</p>
<p>The man who carried out the attack was a U.S. Army veteran who had
pledged allegiance to Islamic State and appeared to have made recordings
condemning music, drugs and alcohol.</p>
<p>The agencies said such attacks, inspired by foreign “terrorist”
organizations, have been carried out in the U.S. and abroad using
rented, stolen and personally owned vehicles.</p>
<p>Attackers could also attempt to use improvised explosive devices to
supplement a vehicle attack, they said.</p>
<p>The agencies said past targets have included pedestrians, law
enforcement or military members, and crowded public venues that are
accessible from roadways.</p>
<p>“We ask that the public remain vigilant regarding possible copycat or
retaliatory attacks and report any suspicious activity to law
enforcement,” they said.</p>

<h2 id="trumps-offshore-wind-ban-is-coming-congressman-says">Trump’s
Offshore Wind Ban Is Coming, Congressman Says</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-14, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDcwNTQxNi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc5NzIwMDk3OH0.wft2_GHYlcqQacJy1St1ECcxMlHuyju9qMBSrPuivME/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
President-elect Donald Trump’s team is drafting an executive order to
“halt offshore wind turbine activities” along the East Coast, working
with the office of Republican Rep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, the
congressman said in a press release from his office Monday afternoon.
</p>
<p>
“This executive order is just the beginning,” Van Drew said in a
statement. “We will fight tooth and nail to prevent this offshore wind
catastrophe from wreaking havoc on the hardworking people who call our
coastal towns home.”
</p>
<p>
The announcement indicates that some in the anti-wind space are leaving
open the possibility that Trump’s much-hyped offshore wind ban may be
less sweeping than initially suggested.
</p>
<p>
In
<a href="https://vandrew.house.gov/news/email/show.aspx?ID=4WCDH2I7AJH54" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>its
press release</u></a>, Van Drew’s office said the executive order would
“lay the groundwork for permanent measures against the projects,”
leaving the door open to only a temporary pause on permitting new
projects. The congressman had
<a href="https://www.njspotlightnews.org/2025/01/nj-rep-jeff-van-drew-drafts-trump-executive-order-freezing-offshore-wind-development/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>recently
told</u></a> New Jersey reporters that he anticipates only a six-month
moratorium on offshore wind.
</p>
<p>
The release also stated that the “proposed order” is “expected to be
finalized within the first few months of the administration,” which is a
far cry from Trump’s promise to stop projects
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/vineyard-wind-trump" target="_self"><u>on
Day 1</u></a>. If enacted, a pause would essentially halt
<em><em>all</em></em> U.S. offshore wind development because the
sought-after stretches of national coastline are entirely within federal
waters.
</p>
<p>
Whether this is just caution from Van Drew’s people or a true moderation
of Trump’s ambition we’ll soon find out. Inauguration Day is in less
than a week.

called in to fight the devastating fires burning in Los Angeles County’s
famously tricky, hilly terrain. You’re working long hours — not as long
as your colleagues on the ground due to flight time limitations, but the
maximum scheduling allows — not to mention the added external pressures
you’re also facing. Even the incoming president recently wondered aloud

particularly white-knuckle drop</u></a> at a low altitude in poor
visibility conditions when an object catches your eye outside the
cockpit window: an authorized drone dangerously close to your wing.
</p>
<p>
Aerial firefighters don’t have to imagine this terrifying scenario;
they’ve lived it. Last week, a drone punched a hole in the wing of a
Québécois “Super Scooper” plane that had
<a href="https://skiesmag.com/news/quebec-cl-415-super-scooper-may-resume-flying-today-after-drone-strike-repairs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>traveled
down from Canada</u></a> to fight the fires, grounding Palisades
firefighting operations

an agonizing half-hour</u></a>. Thirty minutes might not seem like much,
but it is precious time lost when the Santa Ana winds have already
curtailed aerial operations.
</p>
<p>
“I am shocked by what happened in Los Angeles with the drone,” Anna Lau,
a forestry communication coordinator with the Montana Department of
Natural Resources and Conservation, told me. The Montana DNRC has also
had to contend with
<a href="https://www.ypradio.org/wildfire/2022-09-01/drone-complicates-response-to-fire-west-of-helena" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>unauthorized
drones grounding its firefighting planes</u></a>. “We’re following
what’s going on very closely, and it’s shocking to us,” Lau went on.
Leaving the skies clear so that firefighters can get on with their work
“just seems like a no-brainer, especially when people are actively
trying to tackle the situation at hand and fighting to save homes,
property, and lives.”

<p>
Although the Super Scooper collision was by far the most egregious case,
according to authorities there have been at least 40 “incidents
involving drones” in the airspace around L.A. since the fires started.
(Notably, the Federal Aviation Administration has not granted any
waivers for the air space around Palisades, meaning any drone images you
see of the region, including on the news, were “probably shot
illegally,”
<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/los-angeles-firefighters-drones.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>Intelligencer</em></em></u><u>
reports</u></a>.) So far, law enforcement has arrested three people
<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/5082600-unauthorized-drone-flights-double-in-southern-california-3-arrested-during-la-fires/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>connected
to drones flying</u></a> near the L.A. fires, and the FBI is
<a href="https://x.com/FBIMostWanted/status/1878910193259454890" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>seeking
information</u></a> regarding the Super Scooper collision.
</p>
<p>
Such a problem is hardly isolated to these fires, though. The Forest
Service reports that drones led to the suspension of or interfered with
<a href="https://richmondobserver.com/local-news/forest-service-agencies-reminding-residents-across-the-state-to-keep-drones-away-from-wildfires.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>at
least 172 fire responses</u></a> between 2015 and 2020. Some people,
including Mike Fraietta, an FAA-certified drone pilot and the founder of
the drone-detection company Gargoyle Systems, believe the true number of
interferences is much higher — closer to 400.
</p>
<p>
Law enforcement likes to say that unauthorized drone use falls into
three buckets —
<a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/unauthorized-drone-usage-in-double-digits-amid-socals-firefight/3602131/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>clueless,
criminal, or careless</u></a> — and Fraietta was inclined to believe
that it’s mostly the former in L.A. Hobbyists and other casual drone
operators “don’t know the regulations or that this is a danger,” he
said. “There’s a lot of ignorance.” To raise awareness, he suggested law
enforcement and the media highlight the steep penalties for flying
drones in wildfire no-fly zones, which is punishable
<a href="https://www.kxlh.com/us-news/california-wildfires/firefighting-plane-grounded-after-drone-strike-will-be-back-in-the-air-soon-officials-said#:~:text=including%20the%20FAA.-,Officials%20said%2C%20so%20far%2C%20three%20people%20have%20been%20arrested%20for,fine%20of%20up%20to%20%2475%2C000." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>by
up to</u></a> 12 months in prison or a fine of $75,000.
</p>
<p>
“What we’re seeing, particularly in California, is TikTok and Instagram
influencers trying to get a shot and get likes,” Fraietta conjectured.
In the case of the drone that hit the Super Scooper, it “might have been
a case of citizen journalism, like, <em><em>Well, I have the ability to
get this shot and share what’s going on</em></em>.”
</p>
<p>
Emergency management teams are waking up, too. Many technologies are on
the horizon for drone detection, identification, and deflection,
including Wi-Fi jamming, which was used to
<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/london-heathrow-appears-jam-drone-signals-stop-climate-protests-2019-9#:~:text=for%20more%20stories.-,London's%20Heathrow%20Airport%20appears%20to%20have%20worked%20out%20how%20to,protesters%20from%20disrupting%20its%20airspace.&text=Activists%20from%20the%20group%20Heathrow,that%20most%20did%20not%20work." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ground
climate activists’ drones</u></a> at Heathrow Airport in 2019. Jamming
is less practical in an emergency situation like the one in L.A.,
though, where lives could be at stake if people can’t communicate.
</p>
<p>
Still, the fact of the matter is that firefighters waste precious time
dealing with drones when there are far more pressing issues that need
their attention. Lau, in Montana, described how even just a 12-minute
interruption to firefighting efforts can put a community at risk. “The
biggest public awareness message we put out is, ‘If you fly, we can’t,’”
she said.
</p>
<p>
Fraietta, though, noted that drone
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/los-angeles-fires-tech" target="_self"><u>technology
could be used positively in the future</u></a>, including on wildfire
detection and monitoring,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/drone-amplified-field-tech-lab-wildfires-drones" target="_self"><u>prescribed
burns</u></a>, and communicating with firefighters
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/new-york-disaster-drones" target="_self"><u>or
victims</u></a> on the ground.
</p>
<p>
“We don’t want to see this turn into the FAA saying, ‘Hey everyone, no
more drones in the United States because of this incident,’” Fraietta
said. “You don’t shut down I-95 because a few people are running drugs
up and down it, right? Drones are going to be super beneficial to the
country long term.”
</p>
<p>
But critically, in the case of a wildfire, such tools belong in the
<em><em>right</em></em> hands — not the hands of your neighbor who got a
DJI Mini 3 for Christmas. “Their one shot isn’t worth it,” Lau said.
</p>

have had student loans canceled under Biden, despite collapse of his
forgiveness plan</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Despite failing to deliver his promise for broad student
loan forgiveness, President Joe Biden has now overseen the cancellation
of student loans for more than 5 million Americans — more than any other
president in U.S. history.</p>
<p>In a last-minute action on Monday, the Education Department canceled
loans for 150,000 borrowers through programs that existed before Biden
took office. His administration expanded those programs and used them to
their fullest extent, pressing on with cancellation even after the
Supreme Court rejected Biden’s plan for a new forgiveness policy.</p>
<p>“My Administration has taken historic action to reduce the burden of
student debt, hold bad actors accountable, and fight on behalf of
students across the country,” Biden said in a written statement.</p>
<p>In total, the administration says it has waived $183.6 billion in
student loans.</p>
<p>The wave of cancellations could dry up when President-elect Donald
Trump takes office. Trump hasn’t detailed his student loan policies but
previously called cancellation “vile” and illegal. Republicans have
fought relentlessly against Biden’s plans, saying cancellation is
ultimately shouldered by taxpayers who never attended college or already
repaid their loans.</p>
<p>Biden loosened rules for debt forgiveness</p>
<p>The latest round of relief mostly comes through a program known as
borrower defense, which allows students to get their loans canceled if
they’re cheated or misled by their colleges. It was created in 1994 but
rarely used until a wave of high-profile for-profit college scandals
during the Obama administration.</p>
<p>A smaller share of the relief came through a program for borrowers
with disabilities and through Public Service Loan Forgiveness, which was
created in 2007 and offers to erase all remaining debt for borrowers in
a government or nonprofit job who make 10 years of monthly payments.</p>
<p>Most of Monday’s borrower defense cancellations were for students who
attended several defunct colleges owned by Center for Excellence in
Higher Education, including CollegeAmerica, Stevens-Henager College, and
Independence University. They are based on past findings that the
schools lied to prospective students about their employment prospects
and the terms of private loans.</p>
<p>Before Biden took office, those programs were criticized by advocates
who said complex rules made it difficult for borrowers to get relief.
The Biden administration loosened some of the rules using its regulatory
power, a maneuver that expanded eligibility without going through
Congress.</p>
<p>As an example, just 7,000 borrowers had gotten their loans canceled
through Public Service Loan Forgiveness before the Biden administration
took office. Widespread confusion about eligibility, along with errors
by loan servicers, resulted in a 99% rejection rate for applicants.</p>
<p>Huge numbers of borrowers made years of payments only to find out
they were in an ineligible repayment plan. Some were improperly put into
forbearance — a pause on payments — by their loan servicers. Those
periods didn’t end up counting toward the 10 years of payments needed
for cancellation.</p>
<p>The Biden administration temporarily relaxed the eligibility rules
during the pandemic and then made it more permanent in 2023. As a
result, more than 1 million public servants have now had their balances
zeroed out through the program.</p>
<p>All those rule changes were meant to be a companion to Biden’s
marquee policy for student debt, which proposed up to $20,000 in relief
for more than 40 million Americans.</p>
<p>But after the Supreme Court blocked the move, the Biden
administration shifted its focus to maximizing relief through existing
mechanisms.</p>
<p>Republicans have called for a different approach</p>
<p>Announcements of new cancellation became routine, even as
conservatives in Congress accused Biden of overstepping his power.
Republican states fought off Biden’s later attempts at mass forgiveness,
but the smaller batches of relief continued without any major legal
challenge.</p>
<p>As Republicans take hold of both chambers of Congress and the White
House, Biden’s changes could be targeted for a rollback. But it’s
unclear how far the next administration will go to tighten the
cancellation spigot.</p>
<p>Trump proposed eliminating PSLF during his first term in office, but
Congress rejected the idea. Project 2025, a blueprint created by the
Heritage Foundation for a second Trump term, proposes ending PSLF, and
narrowing borrower defense and making repayment plans less generous than
existing ones.</p>

<h2 id="elon-musk-says-third-patient-got-neuralink-brain-implant">Elon
Musk says third patient got Neuralink brain implant</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Elon Musk said a third person has received an implant from his
brain-computer interface company Neuralink, one of many groups working
to connect the nervous system to machines.</p>
<p>“We’ve got … three humans with Neuralinks and all are working well,”
he said during a recent wide-ranging interview at a Las Vegas event
streamed on his social media platform X.</p>
<p>Since the first brain implant about a year ago, Musk said the company
has upgraded the devices with more electrodes, higher bandwidth and
longer battery life. Musk also said Neuralink hopes to implant the
experimental devices in 20 to 30 more people this year.</p>
<p>Musk didn’t provide any details about the latest patient, but there
are updates on the previous ones.</p>
<p>The second recipient — who has a spinal cord injury and got the
implant last summer — was playing video games with the help of the
device and learning how to use computer-aided design software to create
3-D objects. The first patient, also paralyzed after a spinal cord
injury, described how it helped him play video games and chess.</p>
<p>But while such developments at Neuralink often attract notice, many
other companies and research groups are working on similar projects. Two
studies last year in the New England Journal of Medicine described how
brain-computer interfaces, or BCIs, helped people with ALS communicate
better.</p>
<p>Who’s working on brain-computer interface technology?</p>
<p>More than 45 trials involving brain-computer interfaces are underway,
according to a U.S. database of studies. The efforts are aimed at
helping treat brain disorders, overcoming brain injuries and other
uses.</p>
<p>Many research labs have already shown that humans can accurately
control computer cursors using BCIs, said Rajesh Rao, co-director of the
Center for Neurotechnology at the University of Washington.</p>
<p>Rao said Neuralink may be unique in two ways: The surgery to implant
the device is the first time a robot has been used to implant flexible
electrode threads into a human brain to record neural activity and
control devices. And those threads may record from more neurons than
other interfaces.</p>
<p>Still, he said, the advantages of Neuralink’s approach have yet to be
shown, and some competitors have eclipsed the company in other ways. For
example, Rao said companies such as Synchron, Blackrock Neurotech and
Onward Medical are already conducting BCI trials on people “using either
less invasive methods or more versatile approaches” that combine neural
recording with stimulation.</p>
<p>What are the benefits of BCIs?</p>
<p>Marco Baptista, chief scientific officer of the Christopher &amp;
Dana Reeve Foundation, called BCI technology “very exciting” with
potential benefits to people with paralysis.</p>
<p>Through clinical trials, “we’ll be able to see what’s going to be the
winning approach,” he said. “It’s a little early to know.”</p>
<p>Baptista said his foundation generally tries to support research
teams financially and with expert help – though it hasn’t given any
money to Neuralink.</p>
<p>“We need to really support high-risk, high-reward endeavors. This is
clearly high-risk, high-reward. We don’t know how safe it’s going to be.
We don’t know how feasible it’s going to be,” he said.</p>
<p>How are BCIs tested and regulated?</p>
<p>Neuralink announced in 2023 that it had gotten permission from U.S.
regulators to begin testing its device in people.</p>
<p>While most medical devices go on the market without clinical studies,
high-risk ones that undergo pre-market approval need what’s called an
“investigational device exemption” from the Food and Drug
Administration, said Dr. Rita Redberg, a cardiologist at the University
of California, San Francisco, who studies high-risk devices.</p>
<p>Neuralink says it has this exemption, but the FDA said it can’t
confirm or disclose information about a particular study.</p>
<p>Redberg said the FDA tends to be involved in all steps from
recruiting patients to testing devices to analyzing data. She said this
regulatory process prioritizes safety.</p>
<p>She also pointed to another layer of protection: All research
involving people needs an institutional review board, or IRB. It can
also be known as an ethical review board or an independent ethics
committee. Members must include at least one non-scientist as well as
someone not affiliated with the institution or organization forming the
board.</p>
<p>The role of such boards “is to assume there is reasonable risk and
reasonable chance of benefit and that patients are informed of those
before they enroll,” said Redberg.</p>

id="biden-defends-foreign-policy-record-despite-ongoing-crises">Biden
defends foreign policy record despite ongoing crises</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Outgoing President Joe Biden sought to burnish his
foreign policy record on Monday and said U.S. adversaries are weaker
than when he took office four years ago despite global crises that
remain unresolved.</p>
<p>A week before handing over to President-elect Donald Trump, Biden
addressed U.S. diplomats at the State Department and touted his
administration’s backing for Ukraine against Russia’s 2022 invasion and
for Israel’s wars in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Biden said the United States was “winning the worldwide competition”
and would not be surpassed economically by China as had been predicted,
while Russia and Iran have been weakened by wars without direct U.S.
involvement.</p>
<p>“Compared to four years ago, America is stronger, our alliances are
stronger, our adversaries and competitors are weaker,” Biden said. “We
have not gone to war to make these things happen.”</p>
<p>While wars continue to rage in Ukraine and the Middle East, officials
hope a deal between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas can
be reached before Biden departs the White House on Jan. 20.</p>
<p>Biden said negotiators were close to reaching a deal that would free
hostages held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip and halt the fighting in the
Palestinian enclave to allow a surge of humanitarian aid.</p>
<p>“So many innocent people have been killed, so many communities have
been destroyed. Palestinian people deserve peace, a right to determine
their own futures. Israel deserves peace and real security. The hostages
and their families deserve to be reunited,” Biden said. “And so we’re
working urgently to close this deal.”</p>
<p>Biden has faced criticism for providing Israel with weapons and
diplomatic support, since the latest bloodshed in the decades-old
Israeli Palestinian conflict began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas attacked
Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostages, according to
Israeli tallies.</p>
<p>Israel’s subsequent military assault on Gaza has killed over 46,000
Palestinians, according to the local health ministry, while also drawing
accusations of genocide in a World Court case brought by South Africa
and of war crimes and crimes against humanity at the International
Criminal Court. Israel denies the allegations.</p>
<p>The assault has displaced nearly Gaza’s entire 2.3 million population
and drawn the concern of the world’s main hunger monitor.</p>
<p>Protesters shouting “war criminal” greeted Biden outside the State
Department on Monday, some with signs and some throwing red liquid
intended to look like blood.</p>
<p>Biden said he had helped Israel defeat adversaries including Hamas in
Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, both backed by Iran. The U.S. president
also hailed Washington’s support for Israel during two Iranian attacks
in 2024.</p>
<p>“All told, Iran is weaker than it’s been in decades,” he added,
noting the collapse of the Syrian Assad government. “There’s no question
that our actions contributed significantly.”</p>
<p>Authoritarian alliance</p>
<p>Biden acknowledged that authoritarian states China, Iran, North Korea
and Russia were now more closely aligned with one another, but he said
that was more “out of weakness than out of strength.”</p>
<p>Ukraine, with U.S. backing, had thwarted Russian President Vladimir
Putin’s goal of wiping the country off the map, Biden said, touting his
2023 visit to Kyiv as the first by a sitting president to a war zone
outside the control of U.S. forces.</p>
<p>“When Putin invaded Ukraine, he thought he (could) conquer Kyiv in a
matter of days. Truth is, since that war began, I’m the only one that
stood in the center of Kyiv, not him,” Biden said.</p>
<p>Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, writing on
Telegram, said Biden’s address amounted to an acknowledgement “that U.S.
support for Kyiv created the risk of triggering a nuclear confrontation
with Russia.”</p>
<p>“Today’s statement by Biden is an admission of a deliberately
executed provocation,” Zakharova wrote. “The Biden administration knew
it was pushing the world toward the brink and still chose to escalate
the conflict.”</p>
<p>Biden defended his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan,
saying there was nothing adversaries like China and Russia would have
liked more than seeing the United States continue to be tied down there
for another decade.</p>
<p>Biden said when he entered the White House, experts predicted it was
inevitable that China would surpass the United States in economic terms.
Now, he predicted, that will never happen. He said the U.S. economy was
moving forward, but there was still work to do.</p>
<p>“Now, make no mistake, there are serious challenges the United States
must continue to deal with,” Biden said, including in Ukraine, the
Middle East and the Indo-Pacific. He said the Biden administration was
leaving the next administration “a very strong hand to play.”</p>

id="baltimore-prosecutors-back-adnan-syeds-request-to-have-his-sentence-reduced-to-time-served">Baltimore
prosecutors back Adnan Syed’s request to have his sentence reduced to
time served</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Baltiomore, Md. — Baltimore prosecutors filed a motion supporting
Adnan Syed’s recent request to have his sentence reduced to time served,
which could ensure he remains free indefinitely as he awaits further
court decisions in a decadeslong legal saga that amassed a large
following from the hit podcast “Serial.”</p>
<p>Syed was released from prison in 2022 after prosecutors asked a judge
to overturn his murder conviction in the 1999 slaying of his high school
ex-girlfriend, Hae Min Lee. But challenges from Lee’s family later led
to his conviction being reinstated. In August, the Maryland Supreme
Court upheld a lower court decision ordering a new hearing about
vacating the conviction.</p>
<p>Last month, Syed’s attorneys filed a motion asking for his sentence
to be reduced under Maryland’s relatively new Juvenile Restoration Act,
which allows people serving long sentences for crimes they committed as
minors to seek release after 20 years behind bars. The legislation was
passed amid growing consensus that such defendants are especially open
to rehabilitation, in part because brain science shows cognitive
development continues well beyond the teenage years. Syed was 17 when
Lee was found strangled to death and buried in a makeshift grave.</p>
<p>Prosecutors filed the motion in support of a sentence reduction on
Sunday, according to the Baltimore City State’s Attorney’s Office.</p>
<p>In it, State’s Attorney Ivan Bates said Syed’s request is “in the
interest of justice.”</p>
<p>“I truly believe Mr. Syed’s case is precisely what legislators
envisioned when they crafted the Juvenile Restoration Act,” Bates said
in a statement Monday. “We have an individual who has served over 20
years in prison from the time he was a teenager and who has displayed
tremendous personal growth and reform.”</p>
<p>But attorneys for the Lee family argue it’s premature to consider a
sentence reduction while the integrity of the conviction is still up in
the air.</p>
<p>“That question regarding ultimate guilt or innocence needs to be
resolved before any thought of reducing Mr. Syed’s sentence can be
considered,” attorney David Sanford said in a statement. “Currently
Mr. Syed remains a convicted murderer and nothing the State or Mr. Syed
has ever presented calls that fact into question.”</p>
<p>The case, which has been rife with legal twists and turns, has more
recently pitted criminal justice reform efforts against the rights of
crime victims and their families, whose voices are often at odds with a
growing movement to acknowledge and correct longstanding issues such as
systemic racism, police misconduct and prosecutorial missteps.</p>
<p>Since his release in 2022, Syed has been working at Georgetown
University’s Prisons and Justice Initiative and helping care for his
aging parents, according to court filings. His father died in October
after a long illness.</p>
<p>“He cares so much about our family,” his mother wrote in a recent
letter to the court. “He is married and tries to be the best husband he
can. He is always trying to help us out anyway that he can. He has tried
hard to become a positive member of his community.”</p>
<p>Syed has maintained his innocence from the beginning, but many
questions about the case remain unanswered even after the “Serial”
podcast combed through the evidence, reexamined legal arguments and
interviewed witnesses. The series debuted in 2014 and drew millions of
listeners who became armchair detectives.</p>
<p>Prosecutors wrote that since his release from prison in 2022, Syed,
43, has shown he doesn’t pose a threat to public safety.</p>
<p>“In taking this position, the State does not want to minimize the
seriousness of the crime in this case,” the motion says. “The State,
however, does not believe in warehousing individuals who committed a
crime when they were a juvenile and have demonstrated maturity, have
been rehabilitated [and] are now fit to reenter society.”</p>
<p>But the motion doesn’t present a position on Syed’s conviction
itself.</p>
<p>The Maryland Supreme Court’s 4-3 ruling in August called for a new
hearing on whether the conviction should be vacated because the victim’s
relatives didn’t receive adequate notice to allow them to attend the
original proceeding, which won Syed his freedom.</p>
<p>Bates, who took office as state’s attorney a few months after the
2022 hearing, is now weighing how to proceed given the Supreme Court’s
decision. But if Syed’s motion for a reduced sentence is granted, he
would likely avoid going back to prison regardless.</p>

clears way for release of special counsel Smith’s report on Trump’s
Jan. 6 case</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Justice Department can publicly release its
investigative report on President-elect Donald Trump’s 2020 election
interference case, a federal judge said Monday — the latest ruling in a
court dispute over the highly anticipated document days before Trump is
set to take office again.</p>
<p>But a temporary injunction barring the immediate release of the
report remains in effect until Tuesday, and it’s unlikely Judge Aileen
Cannon’s order will be the last word on the matter. Defense lawyers may
seek to challenge it all the way up to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Cannon had earlier temporarily blocked the department from releasing
the entire report on former Special Counsel Jack Smith’s investigations
into Trump that led to two separate criminal cases. Cannon’s latest
order on Monday cleared the way for the release of the volume on Trump’s
2020 election interference case.</p>
<p>She set a hearing for Friday on whether the department can release to
lawmakers the volume on Trump’s classified documents case. The
department has said it will not publicly disclose that volume as long as
criminal proceedings against two of Trump’s co-defendants remain
pending.</p>
<p>Smith resigned his position on Friday after transmitting his report
to Attorney General Merrick Garland, the Justice Department revealed in
a footnote in a court filing over the weekend.</p>
<p>The ruling, if it stands, could open the door for the public to learn
additional details in the coming days about Trump’s frantic but
ultimately failed effort to cling to power in the run-up to the Jan. 6,
2021, insurrection at the Capitol.</p>
<p>But even as Cannon permitted the release of the volume on election
interference, she halted the Justice Department from immediately sharing
with congressional officials a separate volume related to Trump’s
hoarding of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach,
Florida. Lawyers for the Republican president-elect’s two co-defendants,
Trump valet Walt Nauta and Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos De
Oliveira, had argued that the release of the report would prejudice them
given that criminal proceedings remain ongoing against them in the form
of a Justice Department appeal of Cannon’s dismissal of charges.</p>
<p>As a compromise, the Justice Department said that it would not make
that document public but would instead share it with select
congressional officials for their private review. But Cannon halted
those plans and instead scheduled a hearing for Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>“All parties agree that Volume II expressly and directly concerns
this criminal proceeding,” she wrote. “All parties also appear to agree
that public release of Volume II would be inconsistent with the fair
trial rights of Defendants Nauta and De Oliveira and with Department of
Justice Policy governing the release of information during the pendency
of criminal proceedings.”</p>

designates extreme right-wing ‘Terrorgram’ network as terrorist
group</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. on Monday imposed sanctions on an extreme
right-wing online network, designating the “Terrorgram” collective a
terrorist group and accusing it of promoting violent white
supremacy. </p>
<p>The U.S. State Department said in a statement that it had designated
the group, which primarily operates on the Telegram social media site,
and three of its leaders as Specially Designated Global Terrorists. </p>
<p>The State Department said the group has motivated and facilitated
attacks and attempted attacks by users, including a 2022 shooting
outside an LGBTQ bar in Slovakia, a planned attack in 2024 on energy
facilities in New Jersey and an August knife attack at a mosque in
Turkey. </p>
<p>“The group promotes violent white supremacism, solicits attacks on
perceived adversaries, and provides guidance and instructional materials
on tactics, methods, and targets for attacks, including on critical
infrastructure and government officials,” the State Department
said. </p>
<p>The action freezes any of the group’s U.S. assets and bars Americans
from dealing with it. </p>
<p>The leaders targeted on Monday with sanctions were based in Brazil,
Croatia and South Africa, according to the statement. </p>
<p>In September, U.S. prosecutors unveiled criminal charges against two
alleged leaders of the group, saying they used Telegram to solicit
attacks on Black, Jewish, LGBTQ people and immigrants with the aim of
inciting a race war. </p>
<p>Britain in April said it would proscribe the Terrorgram collective as
a terrorist organization, meaning it would become a criminal offense in
the country to belong to or promote the group. </p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden has railed against white supremacy while in
office. </p>
<p>In 2021, Biden launched the first-ever U.S. National Strategy for
Countering Domestic Terrorism, which included resources to identify and
prosecute threats and new deterrents to prevent Americans from joining
dangerous groups.</p>

Los Angeles?</h2>

<p class="drop-caps">
As Los Angeles continued to battle multiple big blazes ripping through
some of the most beloved (and expensive) areas of the city on Friday, a
question lingered in the background: What caused the fires in the first
place?
</p>
<p>
Though fires are less common in California during this time of the year,
they aren’t unheard of. In early December 2017, power lines sparked the
Thomas Fire near Ventura, California, which burned through to
mid-January. At the time it was the largest fire in the state since at
least the 1930s. Now
<a href="https://34c031f8-c9fd-4018-8c5a-4159cdff6b0d-cdn-endpoint.azureedge.net/-/media/calfire-website/our-impact/fire-statistics/top-20-largest-ca-wildfires.pdf?rev=097f901c128347149e2614f2fca4f546&hash=27DDE83DFEF9A69E67C73765892A2B75" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>it’s
the ninth-largest</u></a>. Although that fire was in a more rural area,
it ignited for some of the same reasons we’re seeing fires this week.
</p>
<p>
Read on for everything we know so far about how the fires started.
</p>
<h3>
How many fires are burning in Los Angeles County and where are they?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
Six major fires started during the Santa Ana wind event last week:
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The Palisades Fire, in the Pacific Palisades, which has burned nearly
24,000 acres, started on Tuesday, January 7, around 10:30 a.m. Pacific
time.
</li>
<li>
The Eaton Fire, north of Pasadena, which has burned more than 14,000
acres, started on Tuesday just after 6:00 p.m.
</li>
<li>
The Hurst Fire, in the northern edge of the San Fernando Valley, which
has burned about 800 acres, started on Tuesday night around 10:30 pm.
</li>
<li>
The Lidia Fire, in Acton, California, just north of Angeles National
Forest, which has burned roughly 400 acres, started on Wednesday
afternoon around 1:00 p.m. As of Saturday morning it was declared 100%
contained.
</li>
<li>
The Sunset Fire, in the Hollywood Hills, which has burned about 43
acres, started on Wednesday night around 5:30 p.m. Evacuation orders
lifted early Thursday morning, when the fire’s “forward progress has
been stopped,” and crews were working to “put out hotspots within the
fire perimeter and keep the wind from spreading embers,”
<a href="https://x.com/PIOErikScott" target="_blank"><u>according to Los
Angeles Fire Department Public Information Officer Erik Scott</u></a>.
</li>
<li>
The Kenneth Fire, in the hills above Calabasas, which burned a little
over 1,000 acres, started on Thursday around 3:30 p.m. As of Sunday
morning it was declared 100% contained.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
How did the fires start?
</h3>
<br>
<p>
Officials are investigating the cause of the fires and have not made any
public statements yet.
<a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-01-12/la-me-eaton-fire-power-lines" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Early
eyewitness accounts</u></a> suggest that the Eaton Fire may have started
at the base of a transmission tower owned by Southern California Edison.
So far, the company has maintained that an analysis of its equipment
showed “no interruptions or electrical or operational anomalies until
more than one hour after the reported start time of the fire.” A
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2025/01/12/palisades-fire-origin-new-years-eve-fire/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>Washington
Post</em></em></u><u> investigation found</u></a> that the Palisades
Fire could have risen from the remnants of a fire that burned on New
Year’s Eve and reignited.
</p>
<p>
On Thursday morning, Edward Nordskog, a retired fire investigator from
the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department, told me it was unlikely they had
even begun looking into the root of the biggest and most destructive of
the fires in the Pacific Palisades. “They don’t start an investigation
until it’s safe to go into the area where the fire started, and it just
hasn’t been safe until probably today,” he said.
</p>
<p>
It can take years to determine the cause of a fire. Investigators did
not pinpoint the cause of the Thomas Fire until March 2019, more than
two years after it started.
</p>
<p>
But Nordskog doesn’t think it will take very long this time. It’s easier
to narrow down the possibilities for an urban fire because there are
typically both witnesses and surveillance footage, he told me. He said
the most common causes of wildfires in Los Angeles are power lines and
those started by unhoused people. They can also be caused by sparks from
vehicles or equipment.
</p>
<h3>
How do these fires compare to past fires in California?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
At more than 40,000 acres burned total, these fires are unlikely to make
the charts for the
<a href="https://34c031f8-c9fd-4018-8c5a-4159cdff6b0d-cdn-endpoint.azureedge.net/-/media/calfire-website/our-impact/fire-statistics/top-20-largest-ca-wildfires.pdf?rev=097f901c128347149e2614f2fca4f546&hash=27DDE83DFEF9A69E67C73765892A2B75" target="_blank"><u>largest
in California history</u></a>. But because they are burning in urban,
densely populated, and expensive areas, they could be some of the most
devastating. With an
<a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/live/pacific-palisades-fire-updates-los-angeles" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>estimated
9,000 structures damaged</u></a> as of Friday morning, the Eaton and
Palisades fires are likely to make the list for
<a href="https://34c031f8-c9fd-4018-8c5a-4159cdff6b0d-cdn-endpoint.azureedge.net/-/media/calfire-website/our-impact/fire-statistics/top-20-destructive-ca-wildfires.pdf?rev=9e4974c273274858880c2dd28292a96f&hash=29E21CBFCE8D9885F606246607D21CEB" target="_blank"><u>most
destructive wildfire events</u></a> in the state.
</p>
<p>
And they will certainly be at the top for costliest. The Palisades Fire
has already been declared a likely contender for the
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-09/the-costliest-fire-on-record-not-just-for-california" target="_blank"><u>most
expensive wildfire in U.S. history</u></a>. It has destroyed
<a href="https://lafd.org/news/palisades-fire-0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more
than 5,000</u></a> structures in some of the most expensive zip codes in
the country. Between that and the Eaton Fire, Accuweather estimates the
damages could reach
<a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/blogs-webinars/california-wildfires-52-57b-damage-estimate-accuweather-report/1731718" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$57
billion</u></a>.
</p>
<h3>
Why are these fires so bad? Is it climate change?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
While we don’t know the root causes of the ignitions, several factors
came together to create perfect fire conditions in Southern California
this week.
</p>
<p>
First, there’s the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/santa-ana-winds-climate-change" target="_self"><u>Santa
Ana winds</u></a>, an annual phenomenon in Southern California, when
very dry, high-pressure air gets trapped in the Great Basin and begins
escaping westward through mountain passes to lower-pressure areas along
the coast. Most of the time, the wind in Los Angeles blows eastward from
the ocean, but during a Santa Ana event, it changes direction, picking
up speed as it rushes toward the sea.
</p>
<p>
Jon Keeley, a research scientist with the US Geological Survey and an
adjunct professor at the University of California, Los Angeles told me
that Santa Ana winds typically blow at maybe 30 to 40 miles per hour,
while the winds this week hit upwards of 60 to 70 miles per hour. “More
severe than is normal, but not unique,” he said. “We had similar severe
winds in 2017 with the Thomas Fire.”
</p>
<p>
Second, Southern California is currently in the midst of extreme
drought. Winter is typically a rainier season, but Los Angeles has seen
less than half an inch of rain since July. That means that all the
shrubland vegetation in the area is bone-dry. Again, Keeley said, this
was not usual, but not unique. Some years are drier than others.
</p>
<p>
These fires were also not a question of fuel management, Keeley told me.
“The fuels are not really the issue in these big fires. It’s the extreme
winds,” he said. “You can do prescription burning in chaparral and have
essentially no impact on Santa Ana wind-driven fires.” As far as he can
tell,
<a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2025/1/7/eaton-fire/updates/b71f526e-4b91-4cdc-99cd-f5e19c80105f" target="_blank"><u>based
on information from CalFire</u></a>, the Eaton Fire started on an urban
street.
</p>
<p>
While it’s likely that climate change played a role in amplifying the
drought, it’s hard to say how big a factor it was. Patrick Brown, a
climate scientist at the Breakthrough Institute and adjunct professor at
Johns Hopkins University, published a long
<a href="https://x.com/PatrickTBrown31/status/1877134442839310573" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>post
on X</u></a> outlining the factors contributing to the fires, including
a
<a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/city/time-series/USW00023174/pcp/3/2/1895-2024?base_prd=true&begbaseyear=1991&endbaseyear=2020&trend=true&trend_base=10&begtrendyear=1975&endtrendyear=2024" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>chart</u></a>
of historic rainfall during the winter in Los Angeles that shows
oscillations between wet and dry years over the past eight decades.
</p>
<p>
But climate change is expected to make dry years drier and wet years
wetter, creating a “hydroclimate whiplash,” as Daniel Swain, a
pre-eminent expert on climate change and weather in California puts it.
In a
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/weatherwest.bsky.social/post/3lfdot3l5dm2o" target="_blank"><u>thread
on Bluesky</u></a>, Swain wrote that “in 2024, Southern California
experienced an exceptional episode of wet-to-dry hydroclimate whiplash.”
Last year’s rainy winter fostered abundant plant growth, and the
proceeding dryness primed the vegetation for fire.

shoppers who are still a little bit hesitant to commit, as well as
people on a tighter budget. Roughly 45% of EV transactions at the end of
2024 were leases, much higher than the auto industry as a whole. And a
provision in the Inflation Reduction Act means leased cars can more
easily qualify for the government’s $7,500 EV tax credit. “The
proliferation of lease deals has made EVs more accessible to buyers who
couldn’t afford their higher sticker prices,” the
<em><em>Journal</em></em> said. “For the automakers, it is helping get
more EVs into customers’ hands after a choppy start for their
electric-car operations.”

<p>
Wind power could overtake coal in Europe for electricity generation for
the first time this year, according to the energy think tank Ember. At
the end of 2024, wind power was closing in on coal, coming in at just 4%
below the fossil fuel in power generation as the continent’s coal plants
close. “That output gap could easily be made up over the course of 2025
by an increase in regional wind generation capacity or by higher average
wind speeds at turbine level, or by some combination of both,”

<p class="drop-caps">
A week ago, forecasters in Southern California warned residents of Los
Angeles that conditions would be dry, windy, and conducive to wildfires.
How bad things have gotten, though, has taken everyone by surprise. As
of Monday morning, almost 40,000 acres of Los Angeles County have burned
in six separate fires, the biggest of which, Palisades and Eaton, have
yet to be fully contained. The latest red flag warning, indicating fire
weather, won’t expire until Wednesday.
</p>
<p>
Many have questions about how the second-biggest city in the country is
facing such unbelievable devastation (some of these questions, perhaps,
being
<a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113813952733064849" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more
politically motivated</u></a> than others). Below, we’ve tried to
collect as many answers as possible — including a bit of good news about
what lies ahead.
</p>
<h3>
What is the forecast for the week ahead?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
A
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/los-angeles-fires-wind-forecast" target="_self"><u>second
Santa Ana wind event</u></a> is due to set in Monday afternoon. “We’re
expecting moderate Santa Ana winds over the next few days, generally in
the 20 to 30 [mile per hour] range, gusting to 50, across the mountains
and through the canyons,” Eric Drewitz, a meteorologist with the Forest
Service, told me on Sunday. Drewitz noted that the winds will be less
severe than last week’s, when the fires flared up, but he also
anticipates they’ll be “more easterly,” which could blow the fires into
new areas. A new red flag warning has been issued through Wednesday,
signaling increased fire potential due to low humidity and high winds
for several days yet.
</p>
<p>
If firefighters can prevent new flare-ups and hold back the fires
through that wind event, they might be in good shape. By Friday of this
week, “it looks like we could have some moderate onshore flow,” Drewitz
said, when wet ocean air blows inland, which would help “build back the
marine layer” and increase the relative humidity in the region,
<em><em>decreasing</em></em> the chances of more fires. Information
about the Santa Anas at that time is still uncertain — the models have
been changing, and the wind is tricky to predict the strength of so far
out — but an increase in humidity will at least offer some relief for
the battered Ventura and Orange Counties.
</p>
<h3>
What areas have been affected so far?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
The Palisades Fire, the biggest in L.A., ripped through the hilly and
affluent area between Santa Monica and Malibu, including the Pacific
Palisades neighborhood,
<a href="https://patch.com/california/pacificpalisades/pacific-palisades-named-2nd-most-expensive-real-estate-market-la" target="_blank"><u>the
second-most expensive zip code</u></a> in Los Angeles and home to many
celebrities. Structures in Big Rock, a neighborhood in Malibu, have also
burned. The fire has also encroached on the I-405 and the Getty Villa,
and destroyed at least two homes in Mandeville Canyon, a neighborhood of
multimillion-dollar homes. Students at nearby University of California,
Los Angeles,
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/weather/live-news/los-angeles-wildfires-palisades-eaton-california-01-11-25#cm5rwz9p400003b6nxcjozpgn" target="_blank"><u>were
told</u></a> on Friday to prepare for a possible evacuation.
</p>
<p>
The Eaton Fire, the second biggest blaze in the area, has killed 16
people in Altadena, a neighborhood near Pasadena,
<a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-01-12/death-toll-palisades-eaton-fires-rises" target="_blank">according
to the
</a><em><a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-01-12/death-toll-palisades-eaton-fires-rises">Los
Angeles Times</a>,</em> making it one of the deadliest fires in the
modern history of California.
</p>
<p>
The 1,000-acre Kenneth fire is 100% contained but still burning near
Calabasas and the gated community of Hidden Hills. The Hurst Fire has
burned nearly 800 acres and is 89% contained and is still burning near
Sylmar, the northernmost neighborhood in L.A. Though there are no
evacuation notices for either the Kenneth or the Hurst fires, residents
in the L.A. area should monitor the current conditions as the situation
continues to be fluid and develop.
</p>
<p>
The 43-acre Sunset Fire, which triggered evacuations last week in
Hollywood and Hollywood Hills,
<a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-01-09/firefighters-make-big-gains-battling-sunset-fire-which-forced-evacuations-in-hollywood" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>burned
no homes</u></a> and is 100% contained.
</p>
<p>
The Lidia Fire, which ignited in a remote area south of Acton,
California, on Wednesday afternoon, burned 350 acres of brush and is
100% contained.
</p>
<h3>
How did the fires start?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
It can take years to determine the cause of a fire, and investigations
typically don’t begin until after the fire is under control and the area
is safe to reenter, Edward Nordskog, a retired fire investigator from
the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/what-started-los-angeles-fires?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1:~:text=How%20did%20the%20fires%20start%3F" target="_self"><u>told
Heatmap’s Emily Pontecorvo</u></a>. He also noted, however, that urban
fires are typically easier to pinpoint the cause of than wildland fires
due to the availability of witnesses and surveillance footage.
</p>
<p>
The vast majority of wildfires, 85%,
<a href="https://www.nps.gov/articles/wildfire-causes-and-evaluation.htm" target="_blank"><u>are
caused by humans</u></a>.<strong> </strong>So far, investigators have
ruled out lightning — another common fire-starter — because there were
no electrical storms in the area when the fires started. In the case of
the Palisades Fire, there were no power lines in the area of the
ignition, though investigators are now looking into an electrical
transmission tower in Eaton Canyon as
<a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-01-12/la-me-eaton-fire-power-lines" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
possible cause</u></a> of the deadly fire in Altadena. There have been
rumors that arsonists started the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/park-fire-arson" target="_self"><u>fires</u></a>,
but investigators say that scenario is also
<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/weather/wildfires/are-arsonists-responsible-los-angeles-wildfires-rcna186949" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pretty
unlikely</u></a> due to the spread of the fires and how remote the
ignition areas are.
</p>
<h3>
How many people have died?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
Officially,
<u><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2025/01/13/los-angeles-fires-california-updates-palisades-eaton/" target="_blank">24
people have died</a></u>, but that tally is likely to rise. California
Governor Gavin Newsom said Sunday that
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2025/01/12/los-angeles-fires-california-updates-palisades-eaton/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>he
expects “a lot more” deaths</u></a> will be added to the total in the
coming days as search efforts continue.
</p>
<h3>
Why has it been so challenging to put out these fires?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
Incoming President Donald Trump slammed the response to the L.A. fires
in
<a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113813952733064849" target="_blank"><u>a
Truth Social post</u></a> on Sunday morning: “This is one of the worst
catastrophes in the history of our Country,” he wrote. “They just can’t
put out the fires. What’s wrong with them?”
</p>
<p>
Though
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/los-angeles-fires-wind-forecast" target="_self"><u>there
is much blame</u></a> going around —
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/los-angeles-fires-misinformation" target="_self"><u>not
all of it founded in reality</u></a> — the challenges facing
firefighters are immense. Last week, because of strong Santa Ana winds,
fire crews could not drop suppressants like water or chemical retardant
on the initial blazes. (In strong winds, water and retardant
<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/video/news/video-3349461/Challenging-conditions-crews-wind-takes-fire-retardant-drop.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>will
blow away</u></a> before they reach the flames on the ground.)
</p>
<p>
Fighting a fire in an urban or suburban area
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/los-angeles-fires-water" target="_self"><u>is
also different</u></a> from fighting one in a remote, wild area. In a
true wildfire, crews don’t use much water; firefighters typically
contain the blazes by creating breaks — areas cleared of vegetation that
starve a fire of fuel and keep it from spreading. In an urban or
suburban event, however, firefighters can’t simply hack through a
neighborhood, and typically have to use water to fight structure fires.
Their priority also shifts from stopping the fire to evacuating and
saving people, which means putting out the fire itself has to wait.
</p>
<p>
What’s more, the L.A. area faced dangerous fire weather going into last
week — with wind gusts up to 100 miles per hour and dry air — and the
persistence of the Santa Ana winds during firefighting operations
through the weekend made it extremely difficult for emergency managers
to gain a foothold.
</p>
<h3>
Is there enough water to fight the fires?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
Trump and others have criticized Los Angeles for being unprepared for
the fires, given
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/09/us/los-angeles-fire-water-hydrant-failure.html" target="_blank"><u>reports</u></a>
that some fire hydrants ran dry or had low pressure during operations in
Pacific Palisades. According to
<a href="https://www.ladwpnews.com/pacific-palisades-fire-correcting-misinformation-about-ladwps-water-system/" target="_blank"><u>the
Los Angeles Department of Water and Power</u></a>, about 20% of hydrants
were affected, mostly at higher elevations.
</p>
<p>
The problem isn’t a lack of preparation, however. It’s that the L.A.
wildfires are so large and widespread, the county’s preparations were
quickly overwhelmed. “We’re fighting a wildfire with urban water
systems, and that is really challenging,” Los Angeles Department of
Water and Power CEO Janisse Quiñones said in a news conference last
week. When houses burn down, water mains can break open. Civilians also
put a strain on the system when they use hoses or sprinkler systems to
try to protect their homes.
</p>
<p>
On Sunday, Judy Chu, the Democratic lawmaker representing Altadena,
confirmed that fire officials had told her there was
<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/judy-chu-eaton-fire-altadena-response/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>enough
water</u></a> to continue the battle in the days ahead. “I believe that
we’re in a good place right now,” she told reporters. Newsom, meanwhile,
has responded to criticism over the water failure by
<a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2025-01-10/newsom-water-fires-investigation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ordering
an investigation</u></a> into the weak or dry hydrants.
</p>
<p>
So-called “super soaker” planes have had no problem with water access;
they’re scooping
<a href="https://www.foxla.com/video/1572766" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>directly
from the ocean</u></a>.
</p>
<h3>
Have aerial firefighting operations resumed?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
Yes. Although aerial support was grounded in the early stages of the
wildfires due to severe Santa Ana winds, flights resumed during lulls in
the storms last week.
</p>
<p>
There is a misconception, though, that water and retardant drops “put
out” fires; they don’t. Instead, aerial support suppresses a fire so
crews can get in close and use traditional methods, like cutting a fire
break or spraying water. “All that up in the air, all that’s doing is
allowing the firefighters [on the ground] a chance to get in,” Bobbie
Scopa, a veteran firefighter and author of the memoir
<a href="https://bookshop.org/a/95482/9781641608060" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>Both
Sides of the Fire Line</em></em></u></a>, told me last week.
</p>
<p>
With winds expected to pick up early this week, aerial firefighting
operations may be grounded again. “If you have erratic, unpredictable
winds to where you’ve got a gust spread of like 20 to 30 knots,” i.e. 23
to 35 miles per hour, “that becomes dangerous,” Dan Reese, a veteran
firefighter and the founder and president of the International Wildfire
Consulting Group, told me on Friday.
</p>
<h3>
Should I be worried about the smoke?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
Because of the direction of the Santa Ana winds, wildfire smoke should
mostly blow out to sea. But as winds shift, unhealthy air can blow into
populated areas,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/los-angeles-fires-smoke" target="_self"><u>affecting
the health of residents</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Wildfire smoke is unhealthy, period, but urban and suburban smoke like
that from the L.A. fires can be particularly detrimental. It’s not just
trees and brush immolating in an urban fire, it’s also cars, and
batteries, and gas tanks, and plastics, and insulation, and other nasty,
chemical-filled things catching fire and sending fumes into the air.
PM2.5, the inhalable particulates from wildfire smoke, contributes to
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/wildfire-smoke-mortality" target="_self"><u>thousands
of excess deaths annually in the U.S.</u></a>
</p>
<p>

<a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/wildfire-smoke-inside-airfilter-ac" target="_self"><u>here</u></a>.
</p>
<h3>
When will it rain?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
“The bad news is, I’m not seeing any rain chances,” Drewitz, the Forest
Service meteorologist, told me on Sunday. Though the marine layer will
bring wetter air to the Los Angeles area on Friday, his models showed
it’ll be unlikely to form precipitation.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>Though some forecasters have signaled potential rain
<a href="https://www.desertsun.com/story/news/nation/california/2025/01/11/santa-ana-winds-fires-in-la-ventura-county-weather/77635046007/#:~:text=NWS%20Los%20Angeles%20also%20predicts%20a%2020%25%20chance%20of%20light%20rain%20during%20the%20weekend." target="_blank"><u>at
the end of next week</u></a>, the general consensus is that the odds for
that are low, and that any rain there may be will be
<a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-01-12/increasing-winds-bring-new-fire-dangers-across-l-a-county-this-week" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>too
light or short-lived</u></a> to contribute meaningfully to extinguishing
the fires.
</p>
<h3>
What is the relationship between the L.A. fires and climate change?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
The chaparral shrublands around Los Angeles are supposed to
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/los-angeles-controlled-burns" target="_self"><u>burn
every 30 to 130 years</u></a>. “There are high concentrations of
terpenes — very flammable oils — in that vegetation; it’s made to burn,”
Scopa, the veteran firefighter, told me.
</p>
<p>
What <em><em>isn’t</em></em> normal, though, is the amount of rain Los
Angeles got ahead of this past spring — 52.46 inches in the preceding
two years,
<a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-04-01/another-wet-winter-set-record-water-year-second-in-history" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
wettest period in the city’s history</u></a> since the late 1800s —
which was followed by a blisteringly hot summer and a delayed start to
this year’s rainy season. Since October, parts of Southern California
have
<a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/weather/article/drought-water-fire-california-20011706.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>received
just 10% of their normal rainfall</u></a>
</p>
<p>
This “weather whiplash” is
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2025/01/09/california-fires-wet-dry-weather-conditions/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>caused
by a warmer atmosphere</u></a>, which means that plants will grow
explosively due to the influx of rain and then dry out when the drought
returns, leaving lots of dry fuels ready and waiting for a spark. “This
is really, I would argue, a signature of climate change that is going to
be experienced almost everywhere people actually live on Earth,” Daniel
Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles,
who authored a new study on the pattern,
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2025/01/09/california-fires-wet-dry-weather-conditions/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>told
</u><u><em><em>The Washington Post</em></em></u></a>.
</p>
<p>
We know less about how climate change may affect the Santa Anas, though
<a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/santa-ana-winds-climate-change?rebelltitem=2#rebelltitem2" target="_self"><u>experts
have some theories</u></a>.
</p>
<h3>
What does this mean for L.A.’s housing crisis?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/california-windstorm-fuels-pacific-palisades-wildfire-as-residents-flee-live-updates/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>At
least 12,000 structures</u></a> have burned so far in the fires, which
is already exacerbating the strain on the Los Angeles housing market —
one of the country’s tightest even before the fires — as thousands of
displaced people look for new places to live. “Dozens and dozens of
people are going after the same properties,” one real estate agent
<a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-01-11/their-houses-burned-down-now-they-are-fighting-for-the-few-homes-left-on-the-market" target="_blank"><u>told
the </u><u><em><em>Los Angeles Times</em></em></u></a>. The city has
reminded businesses that

gouging</u></a> — including raising rental prices more than 10% — during
an emergency is against the law.
</p>
<p>
Los Angeles had a shortage of
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/09/business/la-fires-housing-shortage.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>about
370,000 homes before the fires</u></a>, and between 2021 and 2023, the

than two years</u></a> for even the first Housing and Urban Development
Disaster Recovery Grants’ expenditures to go out.
</p>
<p>
My colleague Matthew Zeitlin
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/los-angeles-fires-cost" target="_self"><u>wrote
for Heatmap</u></a> that the economic impact of the Los Angeles fire is
already much higher than that of other fires, such as the 2018 Camp
fire, partly because of the value of the Pacific Palisades real estate.
</p>
<h3>
What does this mean for insurance rates in California?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
The wildfires may “deal a devastating blow to [California’s] fragile
home insurance market,” Heatmap’s Matthew Zeitlin
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/los-angeles-fire-insurance-fair" target="_self"><u>wrote
last week</u></a>. In recent years, home insurers have left California
or declined to write new policies, at least partially due to the
increased risk of wildfires in the state.

Depending on the extent of the damage from the fires, the coffers of
California’s FAIR Plan — which insures homeowners who can’t get
insurance otherwise, including many in Pacific Palisades and Altadena —
could empty, causing it to seek money from insurers, according to the
state’s regulations. As Zeitlin writes, “This would mean that
Californians who <em><em>were</em></em> able to buy private insurance —
because they don’t live in a region of the state that insurers have
abandoned — could be on the hook for massive wildfire losses.”

How can I help?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
There are many scams in the wake of disasters as crooks look to take
advantage of desperate people — and those who want to help them. To play
it safe, you can use a hub
<a href="https://www.gofundme.com/c/act/wildfire-relief/california" target="_blank"><u>like
the one established by GoFundMe</u></a>, which is actively vetting
campaigns related to the L.A. fires. If you’re looking to volunteer your
time, make a donation of clothing or food, or if you’re able to foster
animals the fire has displaced, you can use
<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KMk34XY5dsvVJjAoD2mQUVHYU_Ib6COz6jcGH5uJWDY/htmlview?usp=sharing" target="_blank"><u>this
handy database</u></a> from the Mutual Aid Network L.A. There are also
many national organizations, such as the Red Cross, that you can connect
with if you want to help.
</p>
<p>
The City of Los Angeles and the Los Angeles Fire Department have asked
that do-gooders not bring donations directly to fire stations or
shelters; such actions can interfere with emergency operations. Their

<p>The deadly fires in the Los Angeles area have persisted for a week
amid firefighters’ efforts to contain the infernos, which had killed at
least 24 people by Sunday. Officials say more than 7,000 structures have
gone up in flames in what has been called the Eaton Fire, including the

forecasters warn of ‘explosive fire growth’ conditions amid deadly
California wildfires</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Firefighters in Southern California are battling Monday to bring
multiple major Los Angeles area wildfires under control as forecasters
warned of renewed strong winds that could cause “explosive fire
growth.”</p>
<p>The new wind threat, with the biggest concern extending from late
Monday through Wednesday morning, is expected to bring sustained winds
of 80 kph and gusts up to about 110 kph, the National Weather Service
warned.</p>
<p>Forecasters called it a “particularly dangerous situation” and
designated it as a red flag warning.</p>
<p>Strong winds and dry conditions in an area that has not received
significant rainfall for more than eight months helped fuel the fires
that have already killed at least 24 people and caused billions of
dollars in damage since they began a week ago.</p>
<p>A brief reprieve in the winds in recent days allowed firefighters
aided by air drops of water and fire retardant to make some progress in
bringing the blazes under control.</p>
<p>Of the three major fires still burning in the Los Angeles area, the
California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire, said
Monday the Palisades Fire was 14% contained and has burned 96 square
kilometers.</p>
<p>Eight of the deaths were attributed to the Palisades Fire in the
Pacific Palisades area, officials said.</p>
<p>Sixteen deaths were from the Eaton Fire, located farther inland in
North Pasadena and Altadena, which was 33% contained by Monday morning
and has burned nearly 60 square kilometers.</p>
<p>Sixteen more people have been reported missing in the areas of the
two fires, with officials warning that the number of fatalities is
likely to increase.</p>
<p>Another blaze, the Hurst Fire in the Sylmar area, was 89% contained,
Cal Fire said, after burning more than three square kilometers.</p>
<p>The ongoing blazes, along with other fires that have been contained,
together have destroyed more than 12,000 structures.</p>
<p>In a statement, U.S. President Joe Biden said, “Our hearts ache for
the 24 innocent souls we have lost in the wildfires across Los Angeles.
Jill and I pray for them and their loved ones. We are deeply saddened by
the devastation caused by the unprecedented ongoing wildfires across
Southern California.”</p>
<p>Biden said he is being updated frequently on the fires and directed
federal agencies to dispatch any help and equipment California
authorities need.</p>
<p>“To the brave firefighters and first responders working day and night
to suppress these fires and save lives: our nation is grateful,” Biden
said. “You represent the best of America, and we are in your debt.”</p>
<p>About 100,000 people remained under evacuation orders late Sunday,
with officials saying people would not be allowed back in fire risk
areas while the new wind warnings were still in place.</p>
<p>Some schools that had canceled classes last week were resuming
operations Monday. The National Basketball Association’s Los Angeles
Lakers and Los Angeles Clippers were also set to resume home games
Monday after canceling games due to the fires. But a key National
Football League playoff game involving the Los Angeles Rams set for
Monday night was moved to the neighboring state of Arizona.</p>
<p>Local officials expressed fears that as the fires spread, they could
endanger more highly populated areas and threaten some of the city’s key
landmarks, including the J. Paul Getty Museum, which houses renowned
artworks, and the University of California, Los Angeles, one of the top
public U.S. universities.</p>
<p>California Governor Gavin Newsom told NBC’s “Meet the Press” on
Sunday that the wildfires could be the worst natural disaster in U.S.
history, “in terms of just the costs associated with it, in terms of the
scale and scope.”</p>
<p>A preliminary estimate by AccuWeather put the damage and economic
losses so far between $135 billion and $150 billion. The damages are so
high in part because much of the housing that has burned to the ground
is among the costliest in the country.</p>
<p>Newsom called for an independent review of how the fires raged on,
with firefighters at times facing a shortage of water to fight the
blazes as they quickly spread out of control.</p>
<p>The governor said he is asking the same questions “that people out on
the streets are asking, yelling about, ‘What the hell happened? What
happened to the water system?’”</p>
<p>Newsom said he wants to know whether the water supply was simply
overwhelmed, “Or were 99 mile-an-hour winds [160 kph] determinative and
there was really no firefight that could’ve been more meaningful?”</p>
<p>The U.S. Defense Department said more than 1,800 California National
Guard personnel have been activated to assist with the firefighting
efforts and aircraft deployed to drop water and fire retardants over the
raging fires.</p>

id="philadelphia-76ers-wont-build-disputed-1.3b-downtown-stadium">Philadelphia
76ers won’t build disputed $1.3B downtown stadium</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania — The Philadelphia 76ers have decided not
to build a $1.3 billion downtown arena, a surprising move that comes
just weeks after the team received approval for the controversial
project from the city council.</p>
<p>The Philadelphia Inquirer reported Sunday that multiple council
members had confirmed the change in plans. The team has struck a deal
with Comcast Spectacor to remain in the city’s sports stadium district,
the newspaper said, but further details about the new proposal have not
been released.</p>
<p>The 76ers, the mayor’s office and Comcast Spectacor — which owns the
Wells Fargo Center, where the team currently plays — did not respond
Sunday to requests for comment. The team rents the arena from Comcast
Spectacor, which also owns the Philadelphia Flyers of the NHL, who also
play there.</p>
<p>The council had voted on Dec. 19 to approve the downtown arena after
more than two years of heated debate over the proposal, and the owners
of the NBA team had hoped to move into what would be called 76 Place by
2031. The council vote came despite vocal opposition from nearby
Chinatown residents and other activists.</p>
<p>“I’m so livid right now I don’t even know what to do,” Jimmy Harrity,
an at-large member of the council, told the newspaper. Harrity, who
supported the team’s move, said, “I feel as though I was used as a
pawn.”</p>
<p>Mayor Cherelle Parker, a Democrat who had championed the plan, has
said the entire city will benefit from what she called a “historic
game-changing economic development project.” Supporters had hoped the
18,500-seat arena would help revive a distressed retail corridor called
Market East, which runs from City Hall to the Liberty Bell. The area has
struggled for years despite several redevelopment efforts.</p>
<p>The team owners, Harris Blitzer Sports &amp; Entertainment, had
pushed for city approval by year’s end so they could meet their target
opening date. They had vowed not to ask the city for any construction
funding, although they were free to seek state and federal funds.
Instead of property taxes, they would have paid about $6 million in
annual payments in lieu of taxes.</p>
<p>Opponents feared the arena would bring gridlock on game days as well
as gentrification and rising rents to the area.</p>
<p>The Chinatown community has fought a series of proposed developments
since the 1960s, including casinos, a prison, a baseball stadium and a
highway, the last of which dissected the neighborhood when it opened in
1991.</p>

id="fires-burn-los-angeles-schools-destroy-outdoor-education-sanctuaries">Fires
burn Los Angeles schools, destroy outdoor education sanctuaries</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>For Irina Contreras, a program manager for Los Angeles County’s
Department of Arts and Culture, outdoor education was a refuge for both
her and her daughter during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Now, much of that refuge has been burned in the raging wildfires
around Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Her 7-year-old daughter, Ceiba, hikes with a kid’s adventure group
called Hawks and attended Matilija, a bilingual forest school for
preschool and kindergarten. Rain or shine, she and her friends would
spend their days climbing, jumping, hiking, and swimming in places like
Eaton Canyon Nature Area, a 77-hectare (190-acre) preserve near
Altadena, now destroyed by fire.</p>
<p>Ceiba learned to ask plants for permission before taking samples to
glue into her nature journal. Once, her group discovered a hidden path
that led behind a waterfall. Ceiba couldn’t stop talking about it for
days.</p>
<p>For parents like Contreras, the wildfires have been devastating not
just because of the loss of life and thousands of homes. They are
mourning natural and educational areas that served as sanctuaries and
learning spaces for local families, especially in the years since the
pandemic. The fires have torn through natural areas that served every
type of educational setting: public and private schools, nature-based
preschools, homeschool groups, summer camps and more.</p>
<p>“It’s about so much more than what she’s been learning,” Contreras
said. “I can speak with absolute confidence that it totally affected me,
personally.”</p>
<p>The fires have burned school buildings, too, including Odyssey
Charter School in Altadena, which Miguel Ordenana’s children attend.</p>
<p>“The community has been devastated by the fire,” said Ordenana,
senior manager of community science at the Natural History Museum. “It’s
been a challenge to carefully share that news with my children and help
them work through their emotions. A lot of their friends lost their
homes. And we don’t know the impact to school staff, like their
teachers, but a lot of them live in that area as well and have lost
their homes.”</p>
<p>Some areas untouched by fire were inaccessible because of poor air
quality. Griffith Park, home of the Hollywood sign, had not been
affected by the end of the week but it’s not clear when the air quality
there will be good enough to resume outdoor programs, said Ordenana, who
was the first to capture on camera a late puma in the nearby area that
gained fame under the name P-22.</p>
<p>Ordenana said his family was able to connect with some other families
from Odyssey Charter School for pizza and an indoor playdate, but he is
uncertain what the days will look like for them with school closures
already extending through next week.</p>
<p>All schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District, the nation’s
second largest, were closed Friday because of heavy smoke and ash over
the city. Classes will not resume until conditions improve, officials
said. Pasadena Unified School District also closed schools and several
of its campuses sustained damage, including Eliot Arts Magnet Middle
School.</p>
<p>The California Department of Education released a statement Wednesday
saying 335 schools from Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Riverside, Ventura,
and San Diego counties were closed. It was unclear how many would be
closed Monday.</p>
<p>During the pandemic, Contreras felt like she was stuck on a screen.
She devoted much of her energy to working, writing and organizing, but
her daughter’s outdoor education helped her better understand the value
of stepping away from the grind.</p>
<p>Contreras feels confident the outdoor programs will return, although
it’s unclear when it will be safe for people to hike around areas like
Eaton Canyon.</p>
<p>“The nature center is gone,” Richard Smart, superintendent of the
Eaton Canyon Natural Area in Pasadena, said Thursday. “The wildflowers,
the shrubs are gone.” The park hosted dozens of school field trips a
year and Smart estimates more than a thousand students visited
yearly.</p>
<p>“Teachers liked it because it was also free, it was local, it was
nearby. And it was a place to see nature — wild nature but also in a
friendly, safe environment,” he said.</p>
<p>Only a few exterior walls of the Eaton Canyon Nature Center were left
standing, he said.</p>
<p>“For many of the local school districts, we truly were in their
backyard, and now they won’t be able to use it for the foreseeable
future,” he said. “The park is such a touchstone for people in the
community, and so to lose that is just, devastating is not even the
right word. It feels indescribable.”</p>
<p>Many parents and teachers are likely wondering what to do and where
to take their children as fires continue to burn across Los Angeles,
said Lila Higgins, a senior manager for community science at the Natural
History Museum and author of “Wild L.A,” a field trip and nature
guidebook.</p>
<p>A certified forest therapy guide, Higgins says time in nature lowers
heart rates, lowers blood pressure and helps children with attention
deficit disorder feel more calm and relaxed.</p>
<p>“For children’s cognitive development, time in nature and time spent
connecting with nature is so important,” Higgins said. Outdoor spaces
also can help children learn how to develop relationships through
connections with animals, understand orientation through space by
following trails and map-reading and understand human impact on
wildlife.</p>
<p>“A lot of the places that we’re talking about are really popular with
homeschoolers, but they also are a destination for some field trips,
certainly places like Eaton Canyon,” said Greg Pauly, co-author of “Wild
L.A.” and director of the Urban Nature Research Center at the museum. “I
do think it’s safe to say that people are going to continue to be
interacting with those landscapes and it will hopefully still be a field
trip destination in the future. But it’s certainly going to be a while
before that happens.”</p>
<p>“This is the reality of modern Southern California,” he said. “Fire
changes the landscape and people’s lives shockingly often.”</p>

id="california-wildfires-could-be-leaving-deeper-inequality-in-their-wake">California
wildfires could be leaving deeper inequality in their wake</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ALTADENA, Calif. — The sight of celebrity mansions and movie
landmarks reduced to ashes can make it seem like the wildfires roaring
through the Los Angeles area affected a constellation of movie
stars. </p>
<p>But a drive through the charred neighborhoods around Altadena shows
that the fires also burned through a remarkable haven for generations of
Black families avoiding discriminatory housing practices elsewhere. They
have been communities of racial and economic diversity, where many
people own their own homes. </p>
<p>Some now fear the most destructive fires in California’s history have
altered that for good. Recovery and rebuilding may be out of reach for
many, and pressures of gentrification could be renewed. </p>
<p>Samantha Santoro, 22, a first-generation college student at Cal Poly
Pomona, remembered being annoyed when the initial news coverage of the
wildfires focused more on celebrities. She and her sister, who attends
UC Berkeley, worry how their Mexican immigrant parents and working-class
neighbors who lost their homes in Altadena will move forward. </p>
<p>“We don’t have like, ‘Oh, I’ll just go to my second home and stay
there,’” Santoro said. </p>
<p>The landlord of their family’s two-bedroom house with a pool had
never increased the $1,650 rent, making it possible for the Santoros to
affordably raise their daughters. Now, they’re temporarily staying with
a relative in Pasadena. The family has renters insurance but not much
else. </p>
<p>“I think it’s hard to believe that you have nothing,” Santoro said,
through tears, thinking of her parents. “Everything that they ever
worked for was in that house.” </p>
<p>Altadena had been a mix of tiny bungalows and magnificent mansions.
The community of 42,000 includes blue-collar families, artists,
entertainment industry workers and white-collar ones. About 58% of
residents are non-white, with one-fourth of them Hispanic and nearly a
fifth Black, according to Census data. </p>
<p>During the Civil Rights era, Altadena became a rare land of
opportunity for Black Americans to reach middle class without the
discriminatory practices of denying them access to credit. They kept
homes within the family and helped others to flourish. Today, the Black
home ownership rate there is at 81.5%, almost double the national
rate. </p>
<p>That’s impressive considering 92% of the 15,000 residences in
Altadena are single-family homes, according to the 2023 Census American
Community Survey. The median income is over $129,000. Just over 7% of
residents live in poverty. </p>
<p>Victoria Knapp, chair of the Altadena Town Council, worries that the
fires have irreparably changed the landscape for these families. </p>
<p>“Someone is going to buy it and develop who knows what on it. And
that is going to change the character of Altadena,” Knapp said, adding
that those with fewer resources will be disproportionately hurt. </p>
<p>The family of Kenneth Snowden, 57, was one of the Black families able
to purchase a home in 1962. That house, as well as the one Snowden
bought almost 20 years ago, are both gone. </p>
<p>He is challenging state and federal officials to help all
fire-affected communities fairly because “your $40 million home is no
different than my $2 million home.” </p>
<p>Snowden wants the ability to acquire home loans with 0% interest.
“Give us the ability to rebuild, restart our lives,” he said. “If you
can spend billions of dollars fighting a war, you can spend a billion
dollars to help us get back where we were at.” </p>
<p>Shawn Brown lost not only her home but also the public charter school
she founded in Altadena. She had a message for fellow Black homeowners
who might be tempted with offers for their property: “I would tell them
to stand strong, rebuild, continue the generational progress of African
Americans.” </p>
<p>She and other staff at Pasadena Rosebud Academy are trying to raise
money to rebuild while looking at temporary sites in churches. </p>
<p>But even some churches have burned. At Altadena Baptist Church, the
bell tower is pretty much the only thing still standing. </p>
<p>The Rev. George Van Alstine and others are trying to help more than
10 church members who lost homes with needs like navigating insurance
and federal aid. The pastor is worried the fires will lead to
gentrification, with Black parishioners, who make up half the
congregation, paying the price. </p>
<p>“We’re seeing a number of families who are probably going to have to
move out of the area because rebuilding in Altadena will be too
expensive for them,” he said. </p>
<p>The 32-year-old photographer Daniela Dawson, who had been working two
jobs to meet the $2,200 rent for her studio apartment, fled the
wildfires with her Hyundai SUV and her cat, Lola. She lost almost
everything else, including thousands of dollars of photography
gear. </p>
<p>She did not have renter’s insurance. “Obviously now I’m thinking
about it. Wish I had it,” she said. </p>
<p>Dawson plans to return to Arizona, where she lived previously, and
regroup. But she likely won’t be returning to Altadena.</p>

Thieves 2’ is No. 1 at box office as ‘Better Man’ flops</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — On a quiet weekend in movie theaters, while much of
Hollywood’s attention was on the wildfires that continue to rage in Los
Angeles, Lionsgate’s “Den of Thieves 2: Pantera” debuted atop the box
office with $15.5 million, according to studio estimates Sunday.</p>
<p>Mid-January is often a slow moviegoing period, and that was slightly
exacerbated by the closures of about 10 theaters in Los Angeles, the
country’s top box-office market.</p>
<p>A sequel to the Gerard Butler 2018 heist thriller, “Den of Thieves 2”
performed similarly to the original. The first installment, released by
STX, opened with $15.2 million seven years ago. O’Shea Jackson
Jr. co-stars in the sequel, which debuted in 3,008 North American
theaters.</p>
<p>Butler’s films are becoming something of a regular feature in
January. He also starred in “Plane,” which managed $32.1 million after
launching on Jan. 13 in 2023.</p>
<p>“Den of Thieves 2,” made for about $40 million, was a bit more costly
to make. Audiences liked it well enough, giving it a “B+” CinemaScore.
Reviews (58% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) weren’t particularly good. But it
counted as Lionsgate’s first No.1 opening since “The Hunger Games: The
Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes” in November 2023.</p>
<p>Also entering wide release over the weekend was the Robbie Williams
movie “Better Man,” one of the more audacious spins on the music biopic
in recent years. Rather than going the more tradition routes of Elton
John (“Rocketman”) or Elvis Presley (“Elvis”), the British popstar is
portrayed by a CGI chimpanzee in Michael Gracey’s film.</p>
<p>The Paramount Pictures release, produced for $110 million and
acquired by Paramount for $25 million, didn’t catch on much better than
Williams’ previous forays into the United States. It tanked, with $1.1
million in ticket sales from 1,291 locations. Gracey’s previous feature,
2017’s “The Greatest Showman” ($459 million worldwide), fared far better
in theaters. Reviews, however, have been very good for “Better Man.”</p>
<p>It was bested by “The Last Showgirl,” the Las Vegas drama starring
Pamela Anderson. The Roadside Attractions release expanded to 870
theaters and collected $1.5 million.</p>
<p>Also outdoing “Better Man” was Brady Corbet’s “The Brutalist.” Coming
off winning best drama at the Golden Globes, the A24 postwar epic
grossed a hefty $1.4 million from just 68 locations. It will expand
wider in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>The weekend’s lion share of business went to holiday holdovers,
including “Mufasa: The Lion King,” “Sonic the Hedgehog 3,” “Nosferatu”
and “Moana 2.”</p>
<p>In its fourth week of release, Barry Jenkins “Mufasa” continued to do
well, adding $13.2 million to bring its total to $539.7 million
worldwide. Also on its fourth weekend, “Sonic the Hedgehog 3” padded its
$384.8 million global total with $11 million. Robert Eggers’
“Nosferatu,” the surprise hit of the Christmas period, collected $6.8
million in ticket sales, bringing the vampire tale to $81.1 million
domestically.</p>
<p>The Walt Disney Co.’s “Moana 2,” in its seventh week of release,
added $6.5 million to bring its global tally to $989.8 million. In the
coming days, it will become the third Disney film released in 2024 to
notch $1 billion, joining “Inside Out 2” and “Deadpool and
Wolverine.”</p>
<p>Final domestic figures will be released Monday. Estimated ticket
sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according
to Comscore:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>“Den of Thieves 2: Pantera,” $15.5 million.</p></li>

Jan. 6 participants who committed violence ‘obviously’ shouldn’t be
pardoned</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Vice President-elect JD Vance says people responsible
for the violence during the Capitol riot “obviously” should not be
pardoned, as President-elect Donald Trump is promising to use his
clemency power on behalf of many of those who tried on Jan. 6, 2021, to
overturn the results of the election that Trump lost. </p>
<p>Vance insisted in an interview on “Fox News Sunday” that the pardon
question is “very simple,” saying those who “protested peacefully”
should be pardoned and “if you committed violence on that day, obviously
you shouldn’t be pardoned.” He later said there was a “bit of a gray
area” in some cases. </p>
<p>More than 1,500 people have been charged with federal crimes stemming
from the siege that left more than 100 police officers injured and sent
lawmakers running into hiding as they met to certify Democrat Joe
Biden’s 2020 victory. </p>
<p>Hundreds of people who did not engage in destruction or violence were
charged only with misdemeanor offenses for illegally entering the
Capitol. Others were charged with felony offenses, including assault for
beating police officers.</p>
<p>Leaders of the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys extremist groups were
convicted of seditious conspiracy for what prosecutors described as
plots to use violence to stop the peaceful transfer of power from Trump,
the Republican incumbent, to Biden. </p>
<p>In a post on X, Vance responded to criticism from supporters of the
Capitol rioters that his position did not go far enough to free all
convicted. “I’ve been defending these guys for years,” he said. </p>
<p>“The president saying he’ll look at each case (and me saying the
same) is not some walkback,” Vance said. “I assure you, we care about
people unjustly locked up. Yes, that includes people provoked and it
includes people who got a garbage trial.”</p>

<h2 id="los-angeles-fires-death-toll-rises-to-at-least-24">Los Angeles
fires death toll rises to at least 24</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The death toll in the wildfires that are raging in the Los Angeles
area rose to at least 24 late Sunday, with officials worried that more
bodies will be found by searchers and cadaver dogs in the neighborhoods
that have been leveled by the blazes. </p>
<p>Roaring flames continued to ravage the West Coast state of California
as the top U.S. emergency official warned that increasing winds could
pose new threats in the coming days.</p>
<p>“The winds are potentially getting stronger and dangerous,” Deanne
Criswell, the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency,
or FEMA, told CNN’s “State of the Union” show. “You never know which way
they’re going.”</p>
<p>Local officials expressed fears that as the fires spread, they could
endanger more highly populated areas and threaten some of the city’s key
landmarks, including the J. Paul Getty Museum, which houses renowned art
works, and the University of California, Los Angeles, one of the top
public U.S. universities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>California Senator Adam Schiff told CNN that driving through the
devastated communities “frankly reminded me of visiting war zones. There
are whole neighborhoods that are gone. We haven’t seen this before.”</p>
<p>“The heartbreak is just overwhelming,” he said. </p>
<p>California Governor Gavin Newsom told NBC’s “Meet the Press” that the
wildfires could be the worst natural disaster in U.S. history, “in terms
of just the costs associated with it, in terms of the scale and
scope.” </p>
<p>A preliminary estimate by AccuWeather put the damage and economic
losses so far between $135 billion and $150 billion. The damages are so
high in part because much of the housing that has burned to the ground
is among the costliest in the country. </p>
<p>Watch related report by Veronica Balderas Iglesias:</p>
<p>Newsom called for an independent review of how the fires raged on,
with firefighters at times facing a shortage of water to fight the
blazes as they quickly spread out of control.</p>
<p>The governor said he is asking the same questions “that people out on
the streets are asking, yelling about, ‘What the hell happened? What
happened to the water system?’</p>
<p>Newsom said he wants to know whether the water supply was simply
overwhelmed, “Or were 99 mile-an-hour winds determinative and there was
really no firefight that could’ve been more meaningful?”</p>
<p>“All of us want to know those answers, and I just don’t want to wait
because people are asking me. I want to know those facts,” he said. “I
want them objectively determined, and let the chips fall where they may.
This is not about finger pointing.”</p>
<p>The governor said he is asking the same questions “that people out on
the streets are asking, yelling about, ‘What the hell happened? What
happened to the water system?’</p>
<p>Newsom on Friday ordered state officials to determine why a
440-million-liter reservoir was out of service and some hydrants had run
dry.</p>
<p>Firefighters raced Saturday to get in front of the largest and most
destructive blaze burning in Los Angeles as it shifted directions and
grew by about 400 hectares. The Santa Ana winds that fueled the blazes
are forecast to return. </p>
<p>“We need to be aggressive out there,” California Department of
Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) Operations Chief Christian Litz
told reporters at a Saturday briefing. </p>
<p>The National Weather Service predicted winds picking up Saturday
night into Sunday morning in the area and again late Monday through
Tuesday morning, with sustained winds up to 48 kph and gusts up to 112
kph.</p>
<p>Four active fires in the Los Angeles region have burned more than
16,000 hectares, with flames destroying more than 12,000 structures.
About 150,000 people have been ordered to evacuate their homes, with 700
people taking refuge in nine shelters. The causes of all four blazes
remain under investigation.</p>
<p>Officials said two of the fires were 90- and 76% contained but the
other two only 11- and 15%. The Palisades fire, the largest and only 11%
contained, is threatening to jump over a major highway, Interstate 405,
into a more heavily populated area.</p>
<p>Jim Hudson, a Cal Fire incident commander, told reporters that
firefighters have three priorities: “Life, your property and permanent
control” of the flames.</p>
<p>Firefighting crews from California and nine other states are part of
the ongoing response that includes 1,354 fire engines, 84 aircraft and
more than 14,000 personnel, including newly arrived firefighters from
Mexico.</p>

id="court-ruling-will-help-new-mexico-stay-a-go-to-state-for-women-seeking-abortions">Court
ruling will help New Mexico stay a go-to state for women seeking
abortions</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SANTA FE, NEW MEXICO — The New Mexico Supreme Court on Thursday
struck down abortion restrictions by conservative cities and counties,
helping to ensure the state remains a go-to destination for people from
other states with bans.</p>
<p>The unanimous opinion, in response to a request from state Attorney
General Raúl Torrez, reinforces the state’s position as having some of
the most liberal abortion laws in the country.</p>
<p>Attorneys representing the cities of Hobbs and Clovis and Lea and
Roosevelt counties had argued that provisions of a federal “anti-vice”
law known as the Comstock Act block courts from striking down local
abortion ordinances.</p>
<p>But Justice C. Shannon Bacon, writing for the majority opinion, said
state law precludes cities and counties from restricting abortion or
regulating abortion clinics.</p>
<p>“The ordinances violate this core precept and invade the
Legislature’s authority to regulate access to and provision of
reproductive healthcare,” she wrote. “We hold the ordinances are
preempted in their entirety.”</p>
<p>New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez praised the court’s ruling
Thursday, saying that the core of the argument was that state laws
preempted any action by local governments to engage in activities that
would infringe on the constitutional rights of citizens.</p>
<p>“The bottom line is simply this: Abortion access is safe and secure
in New Mexico,” he said. “It’s enshrined in law by the recent ruling by
the New Mexico Supreme Court and thanks to the work of the New Mexico
Legislature.”</p>
<p>New Mexico House Speaker Javier Martínez called access to health care
a basic fundamental right in New Mexico.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t take a genius to understand the statutory framework that
we have. Local governments don’t regulate health care in New Mexico. It
is up to the state,” the Albuquerque Democrat said.</p>
<p>Opposition to abortion runs deep in New Mexico communities along the
border with Texas, which has one of the most restrictive bans in the
U.S.</p>
<p>But Democrats, who control every statewide elected office in New
Mexico and hold majorities in the state House and Senate, have moved to
shore up access to abortion — before and after the U.S. Supreme Court
overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, eliminating the nationwide right to
abortion.</p>
<p>In 2021, the New Mexico Legislature repealed a dormant 1969 statute
that outlawed most abortion procedures as felonies, ensuring access to
abortion even after the Roe v. Wade reversal.</p>
<p>And in 2023, Democratic New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed
a bill that overrides local ordinances aimed at limiting abortion access
and enacted a shield law that protects abortion providers from
investigations by other states.</p>
<p>In September, construction began on a state-funded reproductive
health and abortion clinic in southern New Mexico that will cater to
local residents and people who travel from neighboring states.</p>
<p>The new clinic is scheduled for completion by early 2026 to provide
services ranging from medical and procedural abortions to contraception,
cervical cancer screenings and education about adoptions.</p>
<p>In Thursday’s opinion, justices said they “strongly admonish”
Roosevelt County, in particular, for an ordinance that would have
allowed individuals to file lawsuits demanding damages of more than
$100,000 for violations of the county’s abortion ordinance.</p>
<p>The provision would have created “a private right of action and
damages award that is clearly intended to punish protected conduct,” the
court said in its opinion.</p>
<p>Erin Hawley, a vice president at Alliance Defending Freedom, an
Arizona-based Christian legal advocacy group, is an attorney who argued
on behalf of Roosevelt County in the case. On Thursday, she criticized
the court’s decision and emphasized its limitations.</p>
<p>“Roosevelt County and other New Mexico localities should be able to
enforce ordinances that comply with federal law and protect the lives of
their citizens,” said Hawley, the wife of U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley of
Missouri. “We’re grateful that the New Mexico Supreme Court did not
abandon common sense and find a so-called right to abortion in the state
constitution.”</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear whether the ruling can be appealed in
federal court or influence broader efforts to apply Comstock Act
restrictions on abortion. The New Mexico Supreme Court opinion
explicitly declined to address conflicts with federal law, basing its
decision solely on state provisions.</p>
<p>Austin, Texas-based attorney Jonathan Mitchell, a former Texas
solicitor general and architect of that state’s strict abortion ban,
said he looked forward “to litigating these issues in other states and
bringing the meaning of the federal Comstock Act to the Supreme Court of
the United States.”</p>

id="scarves-over-headscarves-muslim-womens-outdoors-group-tackles-snow-tubing-in-minnesota">Scarves
over headscarves, Muslim women’s outdoors group tackles snow tubing in
Minnesota</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MAPLE GROVE, Minnesota — Ice crystals clung to the eyelashes, parka
hood, beanie hat and headscarf of Ruqayah Nasser as she took a break
after her first-ever snow tubing runs in a Minnesota park on a -18
Celsius January morning.</p>
<p>She had joined two dozen other members of a group founded by a
Somali-American mother in Minneapolis to promote all-seasons activities
among Muslim women, who might otherwise feel singled out in the great
outdoors, especially when wearing hijabs.</p>
<p>“They understand my lifestyle. I don’t have to explain myself,” said
Nasser, who recently moved to the Twin Cities from Chicago and whose
family hails from Yemen. “My religion is everything. It’s my survival
kit.”</p>
<p>As one of the most visible signs of the Muslim faith, hijabs often
attract controversy. Within Islam, some women want to wear the
headscarves for piety and modesty, while others oppose them as a symbol
of oppression. In the sports world, including in the last Olympics,
devout athletes have often faced extra hurdles on and off the field in
finding accommodations for religious practices.</p>
<p>Concerned about safety as a woman — particularly one wearing a head
covering — but determined to get outdoors to beat seasonal depression,
Nasrieen Habib put out a social media post about creating a hiking group
three years ago.</p>
<p>From the nine women who responded, her Amanah Rec Project has grown
to more than 700 members. There’s a core group for Muslim women only —
for “more sisterhood and modesty,” Habib says — as well as a group for
families. In addition to weekly outings, they organize longer trips and
education on everything from appropriate winter clothing — a challenge
for many migrant communities — to health and environmental
sustainability from the perspective of Islam.</p>
<p>“It’s a way to live your whole life according to a set of beliefs and
rules. And part of those beliefs and rules is taking care of creation,”
Habib said as her 4-year-old son took a break from tubing in a toasty
chalet at Elm Creek Park Reserve near Minneapolis. “How can we be more
sustainable in a time where we see the impact of climate change,
especially impacting people who look like us in the Global South?”</p>
<p>Two sisters, Ruun Mahamud and Nawal Hirsi, moved to the United States
from Somalia as children about two decades ago.</p>
<p>They found a safe haven in Minnesota where, since the late 1990s,
growing numbers of East African refugees have created an increasingly
vocal Muslim community. Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar was the first
lawmaker to wear a hijab while on the U.S. House floor, and Minneapolis
was the first large city in the United States to allow the Islamic call
to prayer to be broadcast publicly by its two dozen mosques.</p>
<p>Even though she feels “safe and accepted” in her hijab, Hirsi joined
the group for extra support.</p>
<p>“I love being outdoors and joining this group has made me more
comfortable to participate,” she said on the tubing hill, where she had
convinced Mahamud to come along for the first time.</p>
<p>“Oh my gosh, it’s the most amazing thing I’ve ever done,” Mahamud
gushed after speeding downhill on a tube attached to her sister’s as
their daughters recorded the adventure on their phones.</p>
<p>The sisters said it’s important to include love for the outdoors and
physical activity in their children’s religious upbringing.</p>
<p>“Taking care of one’s health is part of our faith,” Hirsi said.</p>
<p>Muslim women who wear hijabs can face multiple barriers to sports
participation, said Umer Hussain, a Wilkes University professor who
studies religion and sports. They range from activities where genders
mix or head coverings pose logistical hurdles to conservative families
who might frown on it.</p>
<p>Groups like Habib’s tackle empowering women in their communities as
well as raising awareness about religious accommodations like single-sex
spaces or locations for prayer.</p>
<p>“The biggest barrier, for women specifically, is having access to
spaces that allow us to practice our religion while keeping our modesty
and abiding by the Islamic laws that tell us we are not supposed to be
in mixed spaces without covering up,” Habib said.</p>
<p>She appears to have tapped into a great demand.</p>
<p>“When she told me she was going to start a hiking group to get
sisters out in nature … it was like actually something I’ve been looking
for for a very long time,” Makiya Amin said as she climbed up the tubing
hill in a long white skirt, bright-red headscarf, and heavy winter coat.
“I didn’t really have those type of people who were outdoorsy already
around me.”</p>
<p>Isho Mohamed joined the group for the wide-ranging conversations as
much as for the outdoors, which as a self-described “homebody” she had
largely avoided since college days.</p>
<p>“It’s a safe space that takes me out of my comfort zone,” she said of
the group outings. During them, the women share about work experiences
but also life as immigrants and, most importantly, their faith.</p>
<p>“We also talk about spiritual connection and connecting with God as
well, and just say a little prayer here and there when we’re walking,”
Mohamed added.</p>
<p>Her cheeks glowing above her ski mask after two hours on the hill,
Jorida Latifi was with her 7-year-old son among the last to hang up
their snow tubes. Originally from Albania, Latifi has gone out with the
group almost weekly since joining more than a year ago.</p>
<p>“With Muslim sisters … they do understand you, what you go through,
even with the clothing and hijabs,” Latifi said. “It feels way, way more
like, you know, where you are with family.”</p>

honors Pope Francis with the Presidential Medal of Freedom</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden on Saturday honored Pope Francis
with the Presidential Medal of Freedom with distinction, the highest
civilian award given by the president, saying the pontiff was “a light
of faith, hope, and love that shines brightly across the world.”</p>
<p>Biden had been scheduled to present the medal to the pope in person
on Saturday in Rome on what was to be the final overseas trip of his
presidency, but Biden canceled his travel plans so he could monitor the
wildfires in California.</p>
<p>The White House said Biden bestowed the award to the pope during a
phone call in which they also discussed efforts to promote peace and
alleviate suffering around the world.</p>
<p>It’s the only time Biden has presented the honor with distinction
during his presidency. Biden himself is a recipient of the award with
distinction, recognized when he was vice president by then-President
Barack Obama in a surprise ceremony eight years ago. That was the only
time in Obama’s two terms that he awarded that version of the medal.</p>
<p>The citation for the pope says “his mission of serving the poor has
never ceased. A loving pastor, he joyfully answers children’s questions
about God. A challenging teacher, he commands us to fight for peace and
protect the planet. A welcoming leader, he reaches out to different
faiths.”</p>
<p>Biden is preparing to leave office Jan. 20 and has doled out honors
to prominent individuals, including supporters and allies, in recent
weeks.</p>

<h2 id="blue-origin-set-for-1st-launch-of-new-glenn-rocket">Blue Origin
set for 1st launch of New Glenn rocket</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CAPE CANAVERAL — A quarter of a century after its founding, Jeff
Bezos’ Blue Origin is finally ready for its maiden orbital voyage with a
brand-new rocket the company hopes will shake up the commercial space
race.</p>
<p>The launch initially scheduled for Sunday was pushed back a day due
to “unfavorable” sea conditions, Blue Origin posted on X.</p>
<p>Named New Glenn after legendary astronaut John Glenn — the first
American to orbit Earth in 1962 — the rocket stands 320 feet (98 meters)
tall, roughly equivalent to a 32-story building — and is set to blast
off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in a launch window that
opens at 1 a.m. (0600 GMT) Monday.</p>
<p>“Pointy end up!” the company’s CEO, Dave Limp posted on X alongside
photos of the gleaming white behemoth.</p>
<p>With the mission, dubbed NG-1, Bezos, the world’s second-richest man,
is taking direct aim at the world’s wealthiest: Elon Musk, whose company
SpaceX dominates the orbital launch market through its Falcon 9 and
Falcon Heavy rockets.</p>
<p>These serve the commercial sector, the Pentagon, and NASA —
including, crucially, ferrying astronauts to and from the International
Space Station.</p>
<p>“SpaceX has for the past several years been pretty much the only game
in town and so having a competitor… this is great,” G. Scott Hubbard, a
retired senior NASA official, told AFP.</p>
<p>SpaceX, meanwhile, is planning the next orbital test of Starship —
its gargantuan new-generation rocket — the same day, upping the sense of
high-stakes rivalry.</p>
<p>If all goes to plan, shortly after launch, Blue Origin will attempt
to land the first-stage booster on a drone ship named Jacklyn, in honor
of Bezos’ mother, stationed about 620 miles (1,000 kilometers) downrange
in the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>Though SpaceX makes such landings a near-routine spectacle, this will
be Blue Origin’s first shot at a touchdown on the high seas.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the rocket’s upper stage will fire its engines toward
Earth orbit, carrying a Defense Department-funded prototype spaceship
called Blue Ring, which will remain aboard for the roughly six-hour test
flight.</p>
<p>Limp emphasized that simply reaching orbit is the prime goal, while
successfully recovering the booster would be a welcome “bonus.”</p>
<p>Blue Origin does have experience landing its New Shepard rockets —
used for suborbital tourism — but they are much smaller and land on
terra firma rather than a ship at sea.</p>
<p>Blue Origin has secured a NASA contract to launch two Mars probes
aboard New Glenn. The rocket will also support the deployment of Project
Kuiper, a satellite internet constellation designed to compete with
Starlink.</p>
<p>Like Musk, Bezos has a lifelong passion for space. But whereas Musk
dreams of colonizing Mars, Bezos envisions shifting heavy industry
off-planet onto floating space platforms to preserve Earth, “humanity’s
blue origin.”</p>
<p>He founded Blue Origin in 2000 — two years before Musk created SpaceX
— but has adopted a more cautious pace, in contrast to his rival’s “fail
fast, learn fast” philosophy.</p>
<p>“There’s been impatience within the space community over Blue
Origin’s very deliberate approach,” Scott Pace, a space policy analyst
at George Washington University and former member of the National Space
Council, told AFP.</p>
<p>If New Glenn succeeds, Pace added, it will give the U.S. government
“dissimilar redundancy” — valuable backup if one system fails.</p>

id="trump-prosecutor-jack-smith-resigns-from-us-justice-department">Trump
prosecutor Jack Smith resigns from US Justice Department</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. Special Counsel Jack Smith, who led the federal cases against
Donald Trump on charges of trying to overturn his 2020 election defeat
and mishandling of classified documents, has resigned, as the Republican
president-elect prepares to return to the White House. </p>
<p>Smith resigned Friday from the Department of Justice, according to a
court filing on Saturday to U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, asking
her to lift a court order she issued blocking the release of his final
report.  </p>
<p>Notice of Smith’s resignation came in a footnote in the filing, which
said the Special Counsel had completed his work, submitted his final
confidential report on January 7, and “separated” from the Justice
Department on January 10.  </p>
<p>A former war crimes prosecutor, Smith brought two of the four
criminal cases Trump faced after leaving office, but saw them grind to a
halt after a Trump-appointed judge in Florida dismissed one and the U.S.
Supreme Court — with three justices appointed by Trump — found that
former presidents have sweeping immunity from prosecution for official
acts. Neither case went to trial. </p>
<p>After Trump defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in the
November 5 election, Smith dropped both cases, citing a longstanding
Justice Department rule against prosecuting sitting presidents. In
asking courts to dismiss the charges, Smith’s team defended the merits
of the cases they had brought, signaling that only Trump’s impending
return to the White House made them untenable.  </p>
<p>Smith’s departure is another marker of the collapse of the criminal
cases against Trump, which could end without any legal consequences for
the incoming president and sparked a backlash that helped fuel his
political comeback. </p>
<p>Smith’s resignation from the Justice Department was expected. Trump,
who has frequently called Smith “deranged” had said he would fire him
immediately upon taking office on January 20, and has suggested that he
may pursue retribution against Smith and others who investigated him
once he returns to office. </p>
<p>Trump in 2023 became the first sitting or former U.S. president to
face criminal prosecution, first in New York, where he was charged with
trying to cover up a hush money payment to a porn star during his 2016
presidential campaign. Smith’s charges followed, accusing Trump of
illegally retaining classified material after leaving office and of
trying to overturn his 2020 loss, a campaign that sparked the January 6,
2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol. Prosecutors in Georgia also charged
Trump over his efforts to overturn his election defeat in that
state. </p>
<p>Trump denied wrongdoing and assailed the prosecutions as politically
motivated attempts to damage his campaign. He raised millions in
campaign contributions from courthouse appearances and used the cases to
drive a powerful narrative that the political establishment was arrayed
against him and his supporters. </p>
<p>The Justice Department defended the cases, saying they were run by
career prosecutors who operated free of political influence.</p>

id="winter-storm-dumps-snow-in-us-south-maintains-its-icy-grip">Winter
storm dumps snow in US South, maintains its icy grip</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ATLANTA, GEORGIA — Flight cancellations piled up and state officials
warned of continuing dangerous roads Saturday in the wake of a winter
storm that closed schools and disrupted travel across parts of the
southern United States.</p>
<p>A storm that brought biting cold and wet snow to the South was moving
out to sea off the East Coast on Saturday, leaving behind a forecast for
snow showers in the Appalachian Mountains and New England. But
temperatures are expected to plunge after sundown Saturday in the South,
raising the risk that melting snow will freeze and turn roadways slick
with ice. </p>
<p>“I definitely don’t think everything’s going to completely melt,”
said Scott Carroll, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Atlanta,
Georgia. “Especially the secondary roads will probably still have some
slush on them.” </p>
<p>Airport tie-ups remain </p>
<p>Major roads were mostly clear, but few ventured out early Saturday.
The Atlanta Hawks postponed the pro basketball game they were supposed
to host Saturday afternoon against the Houston Rockets, citing icy
conditions. </p>
<p>Major airports including those in Atlanta and Charlotte, North
Carolina, continued to report disruptions Saturday. While flights were
operating, airlines canceled and delayed more flights after Friday’s
weather slowed airline travel to a crawl. By Saturday afternoon, about
1,000 flights in and out of Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International
Airport were canceled or delayed, according to tracking software
FlightAware. </p>
<p>Sarah Waithera Wanyoike, who lives in the Atlanta suburb of Lilburn,
was starting her second day at Atlanta’s airport Saturday. Wanyoike
arrived at the world’s busiest airport before sunrise Friday to catch an
Ethiopian Airlines flight, on the way to her job in Zimbabwe. </p>
<p>The plane boarded after a delay Friday, but never left, discharging
passengers back to the gate after taxiing around and never taking off
for six hours. Wanyoike said her luggage remained stuck on the plane and
she dared not try to go home because she was told to be back at the gate
before dawn Saturday. </p>
<p>“People slept with their babies on the floors last night,” Wanyoike
said. </p>
<p>Delta Air Lines, the largest carrier at the Atlanta airport, said
late Friday that it was “working to recover” on Saturday, saying
cancellations would be worst among morning flights because of crews and
airplanes that weren’t where they were supposed to be after the airline
canceled 1,100 flights Friday. </p>
<p>Richmond drops boil-water advisory </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the city of Richmond in the state of Virginia, lifted its
boil-water advisory late Saturday morning, nearly a week after Monday’s
snowstorm cut power and caused a malfunction to the city’s water
system. </p>
<p>Mayor Danny Avula said lab tests confirmed that Richmond’s water was
safe to drink, adding that boil-water advisories had been lifted for
some surrounding counties as well. </p>
<p>The temporary halting of the water system affected more than 200,000
people, some of whom lacked water in their homes because of diminished
pressure. </p>
<p>Freezing rain pushed up electricity outages above 110,000 in Georgia
on Friday night, but most power was restored Saturday. The National
Weather Service reported small amounts of ice accumulation around
Atlanta from the freezing rain. </p>
<p>Parts of mountainous western North Carolina saw as much as 4.5 inches
(about 11 centimeters) of snow in a 24-hour period that ended at 7 a.m.
Saturday, according to the National Weather Service.</p>
<p>Parts of middle Tennessee saw nearly 6 inches (about 15 centimeters)
of snow by Saturday morning. </p>
<p>Earlier this week, the storm brought heavy snow and slick roads to
much of the states of Texas and Oklahoma before moving east. The states
of Arkansas and North Carolina mobilized National Guard troops for tasks
such as helping stranded motorists, and governors declared states of
emergency. </p>
<p>City starts digging out</p>
<p>Businesses and churches started digging out from under several inches
of snow that fell on Nashville, Tennessee, in order to reopen for the
weekend. </p>
<p>At Judah Temple of Praise, church members Saturday shoveled, salted
and blew snow off sidewalks and the parking lot in advance of Sunday
services. </p>
<p>“We’re not going to use the excuse of a parking lot covered in snow
to not show up and praise our God tomorrow,” said elder Myyah
Lockhart. </p>
<p>Andy Atkins, co-owner of the Bad Luck Burger Club food truck in east
Nashville, brushed off picnic tables with a broom and shoveled snow off
the sidewalk in front of his business. He closed the truck Friday but
hoped that customers would show up Saturday. </p>
<p>“Having a day off is good for the soul, but is bad for the pocket,
you know,” said Atkins. </p>
<p>Alabama schools could stay closed </p>
<p>School was canceled Friday for millions of children from Texas to
Georgia and as far east as the state of South Carolina, giving them a
rare snow day. Officials in northern Alabama on Saturday said schools
could remain closed Monday if ice doesn’t melt off secondary roads. </p>
<p>The storm piled up more than a year’s worth of snowfall on some
cities. </p>
<p>As much as a foot (about 31 centimeters) fell in parts of Arkansas,
and there were reports of nearly 10 inches (about 25 centimeters) in
Little Rock, which averages 3.8 inches (9.7 centimeters) a year. </p>
<p>More than 7 inches (about 18 centimeters) fell at Memphis
International Airport in Tennessee. The city usually sees 2.7 inches
(6.9 centimeters) a year. </p>
<p>The storm dumped as much as 7 inches (about 18 centimeters) in some
spots in central Oklahoma and northern Texas. </p>
<p>The polar vortex of ultra-cold air usually spins around the North
Pole, but it sometimes ventures south into the United States, Europe and
Asia. Some experts say such events are happening more frequently,
paradoxically, because of a warming world.</p>

id="braced-with-defenses-against-fire-getty-art-center-faces-la-flames">Braced
with defenses against fire, Getty art center faces LA flames</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — After ripping through thousands of buildings, wildfires
in Los Angeles were looming Saturday toward the celebrated Getty Center
and its priceless collection. </p>
<p>Nestled in the mountains above Los Angeles, the famed art museum is
within a new evacuation warning zone as the Palisades Fire roars
east. </p>
<p>Dubbed a “beautiful fortress” and constructed of fire-resistant
travertine stone, as well as cement and steel, the center has drawn
museum experts from around the world to observe its safety system. </p>
<p>Its roofs are covered with crushed stone to prevent embers from
igniting; in the gardens, resilient plants were chosen. </p>
<p>Inside, the galleries can be closed off with a vaultlike double door
that, museum officials say, is practically impenetrable. </p>
<p>“Getty staff, the art collections and buildings remain safe from the
Palisades fire,” the museum said Friday, hours before the evacuation
warning. </p>
<p>“The threat is still happening,” Getty added in an X post. </p>
<p>The museum’s unique collection comprises 125,000 artworks — including
paintings by Rembrandt, Turner, Van Gogh and Monet — and 1.4 million
documents. It also houses a research hub and a foundation. </p>
<p>Museum officials have previously said the collection is protected
within the center’s fireproof structure, made up of 300,000 travertine
blocks and 12,500 tons of steel bars. </p>
<p>“The Getty was constructed to house valuable art and keep it very
safe from fires, from earthquakes, from any type of damage,” said Lisa
Lapin, communications vice president now and when Getty was threatened
by fire in 2019. </p>
<p>“We are really built like a beautiful fortress, and everything inside
is quite safe,” she told AFP at the time. </p>
<p>Built more than two decades ago by architect Richard Meier at a cost
of $1 billion, the center’s protective measures also include a
3.8-million liter water tank feeding its irrigation system. </p>
<p>The building’s ventilation system has an internal recycling system,
similar to those found in cars, preventing smoke from entering rooms
from the outside. </p>
<p>Despite such extensive measures, Getty announced its closure earlier
this week “out of caution and to help alleviate traffic.” </p>
<p>When the 2019 fire threatened the center, it served as a base for
firefighters battling the blaze.  </p>
<p>Caused by a tree branch falling on power lines, that fire burned 300
hectares and destroyed 10 homes. </p>
<p>A fire two years before that also triggered safety measures at Getty,
although it affected only the far side of an adjacent freeway. </p>
<p>“In both cases, we’ve been very confident that the center is fine,”
said Lapin in 2019. </p>
<p>The Palisades fire has ravaged nearly 9,000 hectares since erupting
on Tuesday and is just 11% contained as a series of fires burn through
Los Angeles neighborhoods. </p>
<p>The fire threatened the separate Getty Villa, which also has special
flame-resistant protections, earlier in the week. </p>
<p>Trees and vegetation around the coastal villa were burned, but the
structure and collections, including Greek and Roman antiquities, were
spared.</p>

<h2 id="death-toll-from-los-angeles-wildfires-hits-16">Death toll from
Los Angeles wildfires hits 16</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — The Los Angeles County medical examiner’s office
Saturday evening said the confirmed death toll from the area’s wildfires
has risen to 16, up from the previous confirmed 11.</p>
<p>Five of the new total were from the Palisades Fire and 11 from the
Eaton Fire, according to the coroner’s office statement.</p>
<p>Firefighters raced Saturday to get in front of the largest and most
destructive fire burning in Los Angeles as it shifted directions and
grew by about 400 hectares. The Santa Ana winds that fueled the blazes
are forecast to return.</p>
<p>“We need to be aggressive out there,” California Department of
Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) Operations Chief Christian Litz
told reporters at a Saturday briefing.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service predicted winds picking up Saturday
night into Sunday morning in the area and again late Monday through
Tuesday morning, with sustained winds up to 48 kph and gusts up to 112
kph.</p>
<p>The toll stood Saturday at 11 people killed, at least 13 missing and
more than 12,000 structures destroyed. Officials have warned that the
death toll could increase.</p>
<p>Planes and helicopters worked together Saturday in an aerial assault,
dropping water to aid the firefighters working on the ground in
Mandeville Canyon and to keep the Palisades Fire from continuing to
spread, according to the Los Angeles Times.</p>
<p>The shift of the Palisades Fire, the largest of five, prompted
evacuation orders, including the Brentwood and Encino neighborhoods and
the foothills of the San Fernando Valley. The fire is threatening the J.
Paul Getty Museum and University of California, Los Angeles campus. If
it jumps Interstate 405, the densely populated Hollywood Hills and San
Fernando Valley would be in danger.</p>
<p>Cal Fire official Todd Hopkins told reporters Saturday that 11% of
the Palisades Fire is contained. The second-largest blaze, the Eaton
fire, was 15% contained, according to the department.</p>
<p>The Palisades and Eaton fires already rank as the most destructive in
Los Angeles history. Together, they have burned through about 145 square
kilometers of land and destroyed or damaged about 12,000 structures.</p>
<p>Cal Fire is fighting five active wildfires in the Los Angeles area:
the Palisades, Eaton, Hurst, Lidia and Kenneth fires. As of Saturday,
the Kenneth fire was 80% contained, the Hurst fire was 7% contained, and
the Lidia fire was 100% contained, according to the Times.</p>
<p>Even as the fires are being fought, investigations have begun. Chief
among them is why the Santa Ynez Reservoir in the Palisades was empty
and closed for repairs, according to the Times, and why fire hydrants
did not have water.</p>
<p>“When a firefighter comes up to a hydrant, we expect there’s going to
be water,” Los Angeles Fire Chief Kristin Crowley said, faulting city
leadership and citing budget cuts.</p>
<p>California Governor Gavin Newsom ordered a “full independent review”
of the city’s utilities Friday, saying in an open letter the lack of
water supplies during the initial fires was “deeply troubling” and that
answers were needed to learn “to how that happened.”</p>
<p>President Joe Biden spoke by phone Saturday with Los Angeles County
Supervisor Lindsey Horvath and Ventura County Supervisor Kelly Long to
discuss the latest updates on the wildfires across Los Angeles, a White
House statement said.</p>
<p>Biden convened key officials Friday to discuss the federal
government’s response to the wildfires. On Thursday, he said federal
resources and additional funding were made available to California. The
money will be used to cover all the costs for 180 days, including
temporary shelters, the removal of hazardous materials, first responder
salaries, and measures to protect life.</p>
<p>“We have an awful lot of experience with this stuff, unfortunately,”
Biden told reporters Friday. “Climate change has been real. It’s been
real for the last four years of our administration. We’ve seen
devastating impacts.”</p>
<p>Biden added that his administration was coordinating with the
incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Trump has faulted Biden and Newsom for the crisis. “He is the blame
for this,” Trump wrote about Newsom on Truth Social.</p>
<p>Trump said California’s water policies are to blame for the fires in
the Los Angeles area, which is experiencing extremely dry conditions and
fierce Santa Ana winds. Trump demanded that Newsom “open up the water
main” in Northern California to send water south, but there is no such
central water valve in the state.</p>
<p>Some residents were allowed to return to their neighborhoods on
Friday. Officials urged them not to search through the rubble, which
could contain lead, arsenic, and asbestos. After damage teams evaluate
the properties, residents will be able to return in protective gear.</p>
<p>In some neighborhoods, Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said,
teams are conducting grid searches with cadaver dogs.</p>
<p>Various estimates say the fires burning in the Los Angeles area are
likely to be the costliest ever. AccuWeather put the toll at between
$135 billion and $150 billion.</p>
<p>“This will be the costliest wildfire in California modern history and
also very likely the costliest wildfire in U.S. modern history, because
of the fires occurring in the densely populated areas around Los Angeles
with some of the highest-valued real estate in the country,” said
Jonathan Porter, the private firm’s chief meteorologist.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, California’s insurance commissioner blocked insurance
companies from canceling or not renewing the policies of customers in
the areas of the Palisades and Eaton fires for a one-year period.
Concerns have increased that this week’s fires could hasten the flow of
insurers out of California.</p>
<p>Some information for this report came from The Associated Press,
Agence France Presse and Reuters.</p>

<h2 id="trump-envoy-meets-with-netanyahu-amid-ceasefire-push">Trump
envoy meets with Netanyahu amid ceasefire push</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>JERUSALEM/CAIRO — U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s Middle East
envoy Steve Witkoff met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on
Saturday amid a push to secure a ceasefire in Gaza, Netanyahu’s office
said.</p>
<p>After the meeting, Netanyahu dispatched a high-level delegation,
which included the head of the Israeli Mossad intelligence agency, to
Qatar to “advance” talks to return hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza,
a statement from Netanyahu’s office said.</p>
<p>Earlier on Saturday, an Israeli official said some progress had been
made in the indirect talks between Israel and Palestinian militant group
Hamas, mediated by Egypt, Qatar and the United States, to reach a deal
in Gaza.</p>
<p>The mediators are making renewed efforts to reach a deal to halt the
fighting in the enclave and free the remaining Israeli hostages held
there before Trump takes office on Jan. 20. A deal would also involve
the release of some Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.</p>
<p>Families of Israeli hostages welcomed Netanyahu’s decision to
dispatch the officials, with the Hostages and Missing Families Forum
Headquarters describing it as a “historic opportunity.”</p>
<p>Witkoff arrived in Doha on Friday and met Qatari Prime Minister
Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, Qatar’s Foreign Ministry
said.</p>
<p>Egyptian and Qatari mediators received reassurances from Witkoff that
the U.S. would continue to work toward a fair deal to end the war soon,
Egyptian security sources said, although he did not give any
details.</p>
<p>Israel launched its assault on Gaza after Hamas fighters stormed
across its borders in October 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking more
than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.</p>
<p>Since then, more than 46,000 people have been killed in Gaza,
according to Palestinian health officials, with much of the enclave laid
to waste and gripped by a humanitarian crisis.</p>
<p>Attacks in Gaza</p>
<p>On Saturday, the Palestinian civil emergency service said eight
people were killed, including two women and two children, in an Israeli
airstrike on a former school sheltering displaced families in Jabalia,
in the northern Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>The Israeli military said that the strike targeted Hamas militants
who were operating at the school and that it had taken measures to
reduce the risk of harm to civilians.</p>
<p>Later on Saturday, the Gaza Civil Emergency Service said five people
were killed and several others were wounded in two Israeli strikes. One
of the two strikes killed three people in a house near the Daraj
neighborhood in Gaza City.</p>
<p>The Israeli military said it struck a Hamas militant “in that area”
at that approximate time.</p>

Los Angeles has a long way to go before city and state officials can
start looking for lessons to take from them that can help prevent future
fires. Likely topics of discussion will include building resilient
structures,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/los-angeles-controlled-burns" target="_self"><u>vegetation
management</u></a>, and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/los-angeles-fire-preparedness" target="_self"><u>community
preparedness</u></a>. But there are also some more out of the box
solutions coming from a growing number of technology companies —
“firetech” startups, if you will — that are putting new, high-tech spins
on some of these familiar strategies.
</p>
<p>
BurnBot, for instance, makes a remotely operated machine that executes
efficient controlled burns to help mitigate wildfire risk. “I don’t
think you can ever replace the talent and the expertise and the know-how
of the front line [firefighters],” Anukool Lakhina, CEO of BurnBot, told
me this week. “But what you can do is make their job safer.”
</p>
<p>
Last August
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/ai-fire-prevention" target="_self"><u>I
wrote about Convective Capital</u></a>, the venture capital firm
exclusively focused on funding wildfire solutions, and one of its
portfolio companies, Rhizome, which makes an AI-powered wildfire risk
mitigation platform for utilities. Here are five more notable companies
in Convective’s portfolio that will hopefully help bring wildfire
prevention and mitigation into the future.
</p>
<h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Gridware
</h3>
<p>
On January 8, as flames began to encircle Los Angeles, Gridware
announced its $26.4 million Series A funding round. The company uses
sensors placed on power poles to provide continuous monitoring of grid
infrastructure and can alert grid operators to hazards and faults in
realtime. This allows for rapid repairs and immediate response to
wildfire threats such as equipment failure, downed lines, or any contact
with vegetation. And because Gridware’s devices operate on solar power,
they can remain online even during a power outage.
</p>
<p>
“Our country depends on the electric grid, yet until now, utilities have
been operating it without reasonable monitoring capabilities,” said
Bryan Schreier, a partner at Sequoia Capital, which led Gridware’s
Series A, in a statement about the funding round. Utility-caused
wildfires tend to be particularly damaging, as they often occur near
populated areas. And though California utilities spend over $6 million
annually on risk mitigation, most of that goes towards older
technologies, something Gridware hopes to change.
</p>
<p>
Gridware implemented a
<a href="https://www.pge.com/en/newsroom/currents/safety/articles-4038-pge-responding-dynamic-wildfire-risk-sense-urgency.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>successful
pilot</u></a> with PG&amp;E last year, and has since expanded to
monitoring over 1,000 miles of power lines for 18 different customers,
with devices installed on about 10,000 poles.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>BurnBot
</h3>
<p>
As mentioned above,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_iuAT2oxqE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>BurnBot
deploys robots </u></a>that can chop up vegetation and conduct
controlled burns in a wide variety of geographies, from densely treed
forests to shrubbery near urban environments. Traditionally, controlled
burns are only safe to do in very particular weather conditions, but
because BurnBot captures the smoke from its operations and immediately
extinguishes the fires after vegetation is removed, Lakhina told me the
robots can operate in all weather.
</p>
<p>
“Today, a lot of the predominant way that fuel treatment is done,
regrettably, is extremely archaic. It’s humans with matches setting
things on fire, or humans with shovels and spades that go and dig the
vegetation.” Some estimates calculate that the U.S. has about 200
million acres of land that need to be treated for wildfire risk, and
“you’re not going to get there relying only on humans or only on
grazing,” Lakhina said. He estimates that the company’s robots can treat
40 times the area of a typical hand crew.
</p>
<p>
BurnBot has piloted its tech with

million Series A</u></a> funding round last year.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Fire Aside
</h3>
<p>
Fire Aside makes software products that help fire departments and other
safety agencies to digitize their inspections processes, thereby
ensuring that homes and businesses are complying with fire safety
requirements and helping to scale state and community wildfire
prevention programs.
</p>
<p>
“It enhances the reach of municipal fire departments so that they can,
at scale, communicate with their neighborhoods and their communities,
and automate and digitize these inspections,” Jay Ribakove, principal at
Convective Capital, told me. That’s certainly a step up from the
traditional method, which involves “a firefighter showing up and leaving
you with some handwritten notes on what you can do better,” Ribakove
said. Residents in communities that use Fire Aside are five times more
likely to take actions to protect their property against wildfire, the
company says.
</p>
<p>
Fire Aside raised a seed round of undisclosed size in 2023, led by
Convective Capital.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Pano
</h3>
<p>
Early fire detection is one of the most critical factors in keeping
blazes under control. Pano is a software company that relies on
artificial intelligence and computer vision to automatically detect when
and where a wildfire is breaking out. The company mounts its cameras on
telecommunications towers, poles, or other equipment, which, combined
with other inputs like satellite data, field sensors, and emergency
alerts, gives fire professionals and first responders a unified view of
any developing situation.
</p>
<p>
“The sooner that we can detect fires, the faster we can respond,”
Ribakove told me,
<a href="https://www.moore.org/article-detail?newsUrlName=the-economic-fiscal-and-environmental-costs-of-wildfires-in-california" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>citing
research</u></a> that indicates that if wildfire response times in
California were just 15 minutes quicker, the frequency of large,
out-of-control fires could be reduced by at least 3% and as much as 7%.
Given that California has experienced, on average, $117 billion in total
annual economic losses from wildfires from 2017 to 2021, tech like
Pano’s could save it as much as $8.2 billion per year.
</p>
<p>
Pano raised a $20 million Series A round in 2022 and a $17 million
growth round in 2023.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Overstory
</h3>
<p>
Overstory has another approach to minimizing the presence of fire fuels,
providing utilities with a “global vegetation management platform” that
applies artificial intelligence to satellite imagery, allowing the
company to identify the location, size, health, and species of any tree
in the world. With this date, Overstory can then give utilities risk
analyses, identify particular areas where vegetation might pose a
wildfire risk, such as by growing too close to a power line, and
recommend specific actions. Overstory also hopes its tech will save
utilities money, as vegetation management budgets have ballooned in
recent years.
</p>
<p>
Overstory works with more than 40 utilities, including PG&amp;E, along
with others in Canada, Brazil, and Europe. At the time of its $14
million Series A round, in 2023, the company said that it monitored
about 2 million acres and protected about $6 billion in utility assets.

‘notorious markets’ report warns of risks from online pharmacies</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BANGKOK — Nearly all of the world’s 35,000 online pharmacies are
being run illegally and consumers who use them risk getting ineffective
or dangerous drugs, according to the U.S. Trade Representative’s annual
report on “notorious markets.” The report also singled out 19 countries
over concerns about counterfeit or pirated products.</p>
<p>The report also named about three dozen online retailers, many of
them in China or elsewhere in Asia that it said are allegedly engaged in
selling counterfeit products or other illegal activities.</p>
<p>The report says 96% of online pharmacies were found to be violating
the law, many operating without a license and selling medicines without
prescriptions and safety warnings.</p>
<p>Their websites often look like legitimate e-commerce platforms, often
with false claims that they are approved by the Food and Drug
Administration, said the report, released Wednesday. The FDA and U.S.
Drug Enforcement Administration have both issued warnings about risks of
buying prescription medicines from such sources.</p>
<p>It cited a survey by the Alliance for Safe Online Pharmacies’ Global
Foundation that found nearly one in four Americans who have used online
pharmacies reported having encountered substandard, fake or harmful
medicines.</p>
<p>Last year, federal prosecutors reported that a network of illegal
drug sellers based in the U.S., the Dominican Republic and India had
packaged potentially deadly synthetic opioids into pills disguised as
common prescription drugs and sold millions of them through fake online
drugstores, federal prosecutors said Monday. At least nine people died
of narcotics poisoning between August 2023 and June 2024 after consuming
the counterfeit pills, the indictment said.</p>
<p>Apart from the risks of using drugs that may contain inert
ingredients or those that could cause allergies, the medicines are
sometimes made in unsanitary conditions, said the report, which did not
give annual statistics for those who may have died or otherwise been
harmed.</p>
<p>Progress in fighting counterfeit and pirated goods</p>
<p>The USTR’s annual report cited examples from inside the United
States, but and also mentioned risks of imported ingredients including
fentanyl from China. Many of the illicit online pharmacies are based
outside the U.S.</p>
<p>The “Notorious Markets List” did laud progress in fighting
counterfeit and pirated goods.</p>
<p>In one case, U.S. authorities, industry groups and the police
collaborated in shutting down a Hanoi, Vietnam-based piracy ring,
Fmovies, and other related piracy sites, in July and August.</p>
<p>The report said the world’s then-largest pirated movies site had
drawn more than 6.7 billion visits from January 2023 to June 2024.</p>
<p>In another Vietnam-linked case, two people operating pirate
television platform BestBuyIPTV were convicted and ordered to pay fines
and forfeit property.</p>
<p>The report also cited crackdowns on online piracy in Brazil and the
United Kingdom and busts of sellers of counterfeit purses, clothing and
shoes in Kuwait.</p>
<p>But problems remain with cyberlockers that thwart efforts to restrict
piracy of movies and other content and of so-called “bulletproof”
internet service providers, or ISPs, that promise people using them
leeway for using pirate sites, it said.</p>
<p>One such ISP is Avito, a Russian-based ad platform that allegedly
lets sellers advertise counterfeit products.</p>
<p>Baidu Wangpan, a cloud storage service of China’s largest search
engine provider, Baidu, was named for allegedly failing to enforce or
being slow to act on copyright protection.</p>
<p>The report also pointed to social-commerce site Pinduoduo and to
Douyin Mall, a Chinese online platform owned by Tiktok owner ByteDance.
It said the shopping platforms have sought to build up protections but
that they still host many counterfeit goods.</p>
<p>It also named Shopee, a Singapore-based online and mobile e-commerce
site, saying some country-focused platforms serving Southeast Asia and
South American had better track records in fighting piracy than
others.</p>
<p>IndiaMART, an big business-to-business marketplace in India, still
offers a slew of counterfeit products, it said.</p>
<p>While a large share of theft of intellectual property has moved
online, the report also highlighted real world locations notorious for
selling counterfeit products, including markets in Turkey, bazaars in
the United Arab Emirates and Saigon Square Shopping Mall in Vietnam’s Ho
Chi Minh City.</p>
<p>The report said Bangkok’s MBK Center, a huge mall of about 2,000
stores, had actively cracked down on counterfeiting, though such
products still can be found there.</p>

id="college-tuition-has-fallen-significantly-at-many-us-schools-research-finds">College
tuition has fallen significantly at many US schools, research finds</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>boston — The cost of college keeps spiraling ever higher, right? </p>
<p>Not necessarily. New research indicates students are paying
significantly less to attend public universities than they were a decade
ago. And tuition increases at private colleges have finally slowed after
years of hefty rises. </p>
<p>Figures compiled by the nonprofit College Board indicate the average
student attending an in-state public university this year faces a
tuition bill of $11,610, which is down 4% from a decade earlier when
taking inflation into account. But the real savings come in what the
average student actually pays after getting grants and financial aid.
That’s down 40% over the decade, from $4,140 to $2,480 annually,
according to the data. </p>
<p>That reduced cost means less borrowing. Just under half of students
attending in-state public universities are graduating with some debt,
down from 59% a decade earlier, according to the College Board figures.
And among those who do borrow, the average loan balance has fallen by
17%, to $27,100. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, at private colleges, tuition continues to rise, but at a
much slower rate. It has increased 4% over the past decade, when taking
inflation into account, to an average $43,350, according to the College
Board. That’s a big change from the two decades prior, when tuition
increased 68%. </p>
<p>Costs are coming down as Americans question whether college is worth
the price. Surveys find that Americans are increasingly skeptical about
the value of a degree, and the percentage of high school graduates
heading to college has fallen to levels not seen in decades, according
to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. </p>
<p>Yet research still finds that, over time, a degree pays off.
Americans with a bachelor’s degree earn a median of $2.8 million during
their careers, 75% more than if they had only a high school diploma,
according to research from Georgetown University’s Center on Education
and the Workforce. </p>
<p>COVID effect</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has been a big factor in the cost reductions,
said Jennifer Ma, an executive research scientist at the College Board
and lead author of the study. </p>
<p>“We know that during COVID, a lot of institutions — public and
private — froze tuition,” Ma said. </p>
<p>As states and the federal government responded to the pandemic, Ma
said, they increased higher education funding, allowing colleges to
reduce the cost of attendance. Some of that money has since expired,
however, including an infusion of federal pandemic aid that was mostly
used up by the end of 2022. </p>
<p>Cost was a major consideration in Kai Mattinson’s decision to attend
Northern Arizona University. It would have cost her about $39,000
annually to attend the public university but discounts and scholarships
bring that down to between $15,000 and $20,000 for the 22-year-old
senior from Nevada. </p>
<p>“I originally wanted to go to the University of Arizona, but when it
came down to tuition and other cost, Northern Arizona University was the
best option,” said Mattinson, a physical education major who also works
as a long-term substitute at a local elementary school. </p>
<p>Many institutions have tried to limit cost increases. Purdue
University in Indiana, for example, has frozen its annual in-state
tuition at $9,992 for the past 13 years. </p>
<p>Mark Becker, the president of the Association of Public and
Land-grant Universities, said he was pleased to see the new data. </p>
<p>“Institutional efforts to control costs, combined with many states’
efforts to increase investments in public universities and federal
investment in the Pell Grant, have increased college affordability and
enabled significant progress on tackling student debt,” Becker said in a
statement. </p>
<p>Costs for those attending public two-year community colleges have
fallen even more, by 9% over the past decade, according to the College
Board data, which is broadly in line with federal figures collected by
the National Center for Education Statistics. </p>
<p>Still, for parents paying for their children to attend out-of-state
public universities or private colleges, the costs remain daunting — as
much as $95,000 annually, in some cases. However, many institutions
offer significant discounts to the sticker price for middle- and
lower-income students. </p>
<p>Some private colleges have been expanding their financial aid,
including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which in November
announced undergraduates with a family income below $200,000 would no
longer need to pay any tuition at all starting in the fall. </p>
<p>Other private colleges are discounting tuition as a marketing move in
an increasingly difficult environment. They face a dwindling pool of
young adults, and students who are more wary of signing up for giant
loans. Recruiting students is crucial for staying afloat as operational
costs rise. After temporary relief thanks to federal money during the
pandemic, many colleges have cut programs to try to keep costs under
control.</p>

id="biden-team-urges-trump-administration-to-keep-continuity-in-indo-pacific">Biden
team urges Trump administration to keep continuity in Indo-Pacific</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WHITE HOUSE — Jake Sullivan, the outgoing U.S. national security
adviser, is urging the incoming Trump administration to continue
President Joe Biden’s strategy of bolstering ties with allies and
partners in the Indo-Pacific to counter adversaries that include China
and North Korea.</p>
<p>“The case we will make to them is that the American position in the
region is incredibly strong right now,” Sullivan said in response to
VOA’s question during a roundtable with journalists on Friday.</p>
<p>“There should be more continuity than significant change with respect
to our Indo-Pacific strategy,” he said. “But I don’t know what the
incoming team will actually end up doing.”</p>
<p>Sullivan, considered one of the main architects of the Biden
administration’s Indo-Pacific strategy, said the president’s approach is
“working in a big way,” and he warned that straying from that will
“bring risk.”</p>
<p>Sullivan acknowledged, however, that the administration failed to
make substantial progress on denuclearization of the Korean
Peninsula.</p>
<p>As the threat from Pyongyang remains as acute as it has ever been,
Sullivan highlighted key distinctions: closer cooperation between North
Korea and Russia and a “broader alignment of competitors and adversaries
— Russia, China, North Korea, Iran.”</p>
<p>He repeated the administration’s warning against reducing U.S.
support for Kyiv, something that President-elect Donald Trump has
signaled he would do. What happens in Ukraine really matters for the
Indo-Pacific, Sullivan said, because “China’s watching.”</p>
<p>Biden’s aides have often voiced concern that the West’s reluctance to
bolster Kyiv’s defenses could embolden China to follow Russia’s lead and
invade its smaller democratic neighbor, Taiwan, or act even more
aggressively on its disputed territorial claims in the South China
Sea.</p>
<p>Bonnie Glaser, managing director of German Marshall Fund’s
Indo-Pacific Program, said that cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang
has developed quickly, with North Korea sending its troops to support
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and is likely to expand.</p>
<p>“We have yet to see what weapons systems or military technologies
Putin has promised to deliver to Kim,” she told VOA, referring to
Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
“Beijing has refused to apply leverage to stop this trend.”</p>
<p>Sullivan expressed confidence that the administration has “set up a
great opportunity for the next team” to enhance the U.S. position and
has “shifted the balance of power” in the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>He outlined Biden’s approach of creating a network of alliances and
partnerships, including enhancing cooperation with the Quad, an informal
grouping with India, Australia and Japan, as well as rolling out the
AUKUS security deal with the United Kingdom and Australia to provide
Canberra with nuclear-powered submarines to better patrol the waters of
the region.</p>
<p>Sullivan also highlighted trilateral cooperation among the U.S.,
Japan and South Korea, with the two former adversaries now working
together to deter North Korea’s nuclear threat, and among the U.S.,
Japan and the Philippines to push back against Beijing’s aggression in
the South China Sea.</p>
<p>Continuity or change</p>
<p>Because relations between Washington and Beijing will likely remain
adversarial, the region could see more continuity on U.S. policy toward
China under the incoming administration.</p>
<p>Trump has selected two well-known China hawks for key roles in his
“America First” Cabinet: Senator Marco Rubio, Trump’s pick for secretary
of state, and Representative Mike Waltz, the man Trump is eyeing to
become Sullivan’s successor.</p>
<p>However, Waltz earlier this week announced a sweeping directive to
terminate all national security staffers loaned from other departments
and agencies who serve in apolitical, nonpartisan senior staff roles.
Waltz said the firings were meant to enforce absolute alignment with
Trump’s policy agenda.</p>
<p>Aside from staffing the National Security Council with Trump
loyalists, it’s unclear whether the president-elect will employ the same
approach of leveraging alliances to deter China.</p>
<p>The first Trump administration saw that “multilateral alliances are
more a burden than a reality,” said Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow
at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. During his first
term, Trump terminated U.S. membership in organizations and agreements
that included the Paris Climate Accord, the U.N. Human Rights Council
and the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>“If you do form alliances, they’re going to have to be based on
clear, specific, quid pro quo transactions,” he told VOA.</p>
<p>During his first term, Trump also focused more on bilateral ties, and
he may fall back on that approach.</p>
<p>“He might emphasize ties with strong conservative leaders like [Prime
Minister Narendra] Modi in India but de-emphasize groups like the
U.S.-Japan-South Korea trilat[eral], particularly if a new government in
Seoul drifts a little away from Washington,” said Zack Cooper, senior
fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.</p>
<p>“What remains unclear is whether Trump will be confrontational with
China outside the economic arena,” Cooper told VOA. Key uncertainties
include whether the U.S. will pursue a less robust response to Beijing’s
moves in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea.</p>
<p>“Trump personally seems more open to engagement with [Chinese
President] Xi Jinping and focused on trade issues, but many in his
administration will be pushing for a hard line on security and
technology issues,” Cooper said.</p>
<p>Change of trade strategy</p>
<p>Trade is one area where analysts expect a significant change in
strategy as Trump appears set to enact protectionist measures,
threatening to wield tariffs as a weapon of punishment not only on
adversaries but also on regional partners, particularly those with large
trade surpluses, including Japan.</p>
<p>Trump is expected to undo the Biden’s administration’s effort to
revitalize trade with the region. During his presidential campaign,
Trump vowed to kill the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, Biden’s 2022
deal with countries in the region, saying that it will hurt American
manufacturing and workers.</p>
<p>IPEF was Biden’s attempt to bolster economic ties with Indo-Pacific
countries five years after Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Obama
administration’s most important trade initiative, the Trans-Pacific
Partnership, immediately upon entering his first term.</p>
<p>The framework pursues nontrade priorities such as supply chain
resilience, secure digital infrastructure and sustainable clean energy
transition. It has been criticized by many in the region for not
offering market access measures as Beijing aggressively expanded its
economic clout, including through the Regional Comprehensive Economic
Partnership, the world’s largest regional free-trade pact that covers
almost one-third of the world’s population and GDP.</p>

id="prosecutors-demand-former-us-senator-get-at-least-15-years-in-prison-for-corruption">Prosecutors
demand former US senator get at least 15 years in prison for
corruption</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Prosecutors are demanding that former U.S. Senator Bob Menendez be
given at least a 15-year prison sentence following his conviction for
corruption that included acting as an agent of a foreign government.</p>
<p>In the sentencing recommendation filed late Thursday in a Manhattan
federal court, prosecutors said the 71-year-old Democrat who once
represented New Jersey is the first senator convicted of abusing a
Senate committee leadership position and the first person convicted of
serving as a foreign agent while being a public official. This
“historical rarity,” they said, was a “grave abuse of his power.”</p>
<p>Menendez’s lawyers say their client has suffered enough and have
called for leniency, citing federal guidelines that would have him
serving less than 27 months. Meanwhile, probation officers said their
guidelines would have the senator serving from 24½ to 30½ years.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said arguments that Menendez has been punished enough
reflect a “deeply misplaced sense of entitlement.”</p>
<p>He is scheduled to be sentenced on January 29.</p>
<p>Menendez was the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
when he was charged in 2023 but was forced out of that position and
relinquished his Senate seat in August. He had been a senator for 18½
years.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said in their court submissions that Menendez had, in
multiple instances, promoted the Egyptian government’s viewpoints and
assisted the Egyptian government in ways “directly adverse to his own
fellow U.S. Senators” as he sought to adjust his own public criticism of
Egypt.</p>
<p>Menendez was convicted in July of 16 counts of corruption. An FBI
raid on his home in 2022 uncovered at least $150,000 in gold bars,
$480,000 in cash and a Mercedes-Benz. A large portion of the cash,
prosecutors said, was the result of bribes from three New Jersey
businessmen. The men had sought the senator’s protection and influence
in schemes that included giving one of them, Wael Hana, the sole right
to certify that U.S. meat exported to Egypt adhered to Islamic dietary
requirements, forcing out other companies that had been certifying the
exportations.</p>
<p>Two of the businessmen — Hana and Fred Daibes — were convicted with
Menendez. Prosecutors have called for them to spend 10 and nine years in
prison, respectively. The third man pleaded guilty and testified at the
trial.</p>
<p>Menendez’s wife, Nadine Menendez, who is facing many of the same
charges as her husband, has pleaded not guilty. Her trial is scheduled
to begin next month. It was delayed last year after a breast cancer
diagnosis required surgery.</p>
<p>Some information for this story came from Reuters and The Associated
Press.</p>

id="judge-holds-giuliani-in-contempt-for-continued-lies-about-election-workers">Judge
holds Giuliani in contempt for continued lies about election
workers</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Rudy Giuliani was found in contempt of court Friday for
the second time in a week, as a federal judge warned Giuliani he could
be sent to jail if he doesn’t stop spreading lies about two former
Georgia election workers who won a $148 million defamation judgment
against him.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell in Washington found that the former
New York City mayor and former attorney for President-elect Donald Trump
violated court orders barring him from defaming Wandrea “Shaye” Moss and
her mother, Ruby Freeman. The judge ordered him to review trial
testimony and other materials from the case and warned him that future
violations could land him behind bars.</p>
<p>Moss and Freeman sued Rudy Giuliani for defamation for falsely
accusing them of committing election fraud in connection with the 2020
election. His lies upended their lives as they received racist threats
and harassment.</p>
<p>Giuliani smiled and chuckled as the judge explained why she was
holding him in contempt of court. Howell, who was nominated to the bench
by President Barack Obama, said it is “outrageous and shameful” for
Giuliani to suggest that he is the one who has been treated unfairly in
this case.</p>
<p>“This takes real chutzpah, Mr. Giuliani,” she said.</p>
<p>Giuliani calls judge ‘bloodthirsty’</p>
<p>Shortly before the hearing began, Giuliani slammed the judge in a
social media post, calling her “bloodthirsty” and biased against him and
the proceeding a “hypocritical waste of time.” After leaving the
courtroom, Giuliani called the hearing a farce and the judge “completely
biased and prejudiced.”</p>
<p>Giuliani briefly testified during Friday’s hearing, but only to
authenticate records about his personal finances.</p>
<p>The judge didn’t fine Giuliani for his most recent defamatory
comments about the case, but she said she would impose daily fines of
$200 if he doesn’t certify within 10 days that he has complied with her
order to review trial testimony and other case-related material.</p>
<p>A jury sided with the mother and daughter in December 2023 and
awarded them $75 million in punitive damages plus roughly $73 million in
other damages</p>
<p>On Monday in New York, Judge Lewis Liman found Giuliani in contempt
of court for related claims that he failed to turn over evidence to help
the judge decide whether he can keep a Palm Beach, Florida,
condominium.</p>
<p>Giuliani says he gets death threats</p>
<p>Giuliani, 80, had tried to get out of appearing in person Friday,
telling the judge he gets death threats and has been told to be careful
about traveling. But he withdrew his request to appear virtually after
the judge ordered him to explain whether he has traveled from his
Florida home within the past month.</p>
<p>On the witness stand at the defamation trial, Moss and Freeman
described fearing for their lives after becoming the target of a false
conspiracy theory that Giuliani and other Republicans spread as they
tried to keep Trump in power after he lost the 2020 election to Democrat
Joe Biden. Moss told jurors she tried to change her appearance, seldom
leaves her home and suffers from panic attacks.</p>

chipmaker starts making 4-nanometer chips in US, official says</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. has begun
producing advanced 4-nanometer chips in Arizona for U.S. customers, a
milestone in the Biden administration’s semiconductor efforts, Commerce
Secretary Gina Raimondo told Reuters.</p>
<p>In November, the Commerce Department finalized a $6.6 billion grant
to TSMC’s U.S. unit for semiconductor production in Phoenix,
Arizona.</p>
<p>“For the first time ever in our country’s history, we are making
leading-edge 4-nanometer chips on American soil, American workers — on
par in yield and quality with Taiwan,” Raimondo told Reuters in an
interview, saying it had begun in recent weeks.</p>
<p>“That’s a big deal — never been done before, never in our history.
And lots of people said it couldn’t happen,” Raimondo said of the
previously undisclosed production start.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker and a
major supplier to Apple and Nvidia, which reports earnings next week,
declined to comment Friday.</p>
<p>In April, TSMC agreed to expand its planned investment by $25 billion
to $65 billion and to add a third Arizona production facility by
2030.</p>
<p>Congress created a $52.7 billion semiconductor manufacturing and
research subsidy program in 2022. Commerce persuaded all five
leading-edge semiconductor firms to locate production facilities in the
United States as part of the program.</p>
<p>Raimondo told Reuters earlier that Commerce had to persuade TSMC to
boost its U.S. plans.</p>
<p>“It didn’t happen on its own. … We had to convince TSMC that they
would want to expand,” Raimondo said.</p>
<p>TSMC will produce the world’s most advanced 2-nanometer technology at
its second Arizona factory, expected to begin production in 2028. TSMC
also agreed to use its most advanced chip manufacturing technology,
called “A16,” in Arizona.</p>
<p>The TSMC award from Commerce also includes up to $5 billion in
low-cost government loans.</p>
<p>Raimondo wants the United States to make 20% of world’s leading-edge
logic chips by 2030 — up from the 0% before TSMC began production in
Arizona.</p>
<p>In April, Commerce said TSMC expects to begin high-volume production
in its first U.S. fab by the first half of 2025.</p>
<p>Last month, Commerce finalized an award of $407 million to help fund
Amkor Technology’s planned $2 billion advanced semiconductor packaging
facility in Arizona, which is set to be the largest of its kind in the
U.S.</p>
<p>When fully operational, Amkor’s Arizona plant will package and test
millions of chips for autonomous vehicles, 5G/6G and data centers. Apple
will be its first and largest customer, with the chips produced at a
nearby TSMC facility.</p>

ices roads, closes schools, delays flights in southern US</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ATLANTA, GEORGIA — A powerful winter storm that dumped heavy snow and
glazed roads with ice across much of Texas and Oklahoma lumbered
eastward into Southern United States Friday, making for dicey travel and
a rare snow day for many students. </p>
<p>Arkansas and North Carolina mobilized their National Guards for tasks
such as helping stranded motorists, as governors in multiple states
declared states of emergency. School was canceled for millions of
children from Texas to Georgia and as far east as South Carolina. </p>
<p>The storm piled up more than a year’s worth of snowfall on some
Southern cities. As much as a foot (about 31 centimeters) fell in parts
of Arkansas. There were reports of nearly 10 inches (about 25
centimeters) in Little Rock, a city that averages 3.8 inches (9.7
centimeters) a year. </p>
<p>More than 7 inches (about 18 centimeters) fell at Memphis
International Airport in Tennessee since late Thursday. The city usually
sees 2.7 inches (6.9 centimeters) a year. In some areas where snow
tapered off, such as Memphis, Tennessee, the worry was that wet roads
would freeze overnight. </p>
<p>Farther south and east into Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and
Georgia, a wintry mix of sleet, snow and ice made travel
treacherous. </p>
<p>The heavy wet stuff also packed into a pretty good snowball. </p>
<p>In Atlanta, Georgia, Mikayla Johnson, 12, was out making snow angels
and snowmen on her day off from school. </p>
<p>“My first thought was, ‘Wow!’” said Mikayla, who was outdoors with
her father, Nate. “We haven’t had snow since I was, like, 4 – good snow,
at least. So I was really happy.” </p>
<p>The storm dumped as much as 7 inches (about 18 centimeters) in some
spots in central Oklahoma and northern Texas. </p>
<p>And in the Kansas City area, students were back at school in several
districts Thursday after three straight snow days, only to see classes
called off again Friday because of more snow. </p>
<p>Snow began falling in metro Atlanta before dawn, leading to hundreds
of flights being cancelled and hundreds more delayed at the world’s
busiest airport, according to flight tracking software FlightAware.
Controllers declared a ground stop before 8 a.m., meaning no planes
could land or take off. </p>
<p>Four passengers were injured after a Delta plane bound for
Minneapolis aborted takeoff Friday morning, according to the
Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. One passenger was
hospitalized, while three people were treated at the scene for minor
injuries. </p>
<p>The incident contributed to further delays, although Delta said it
was unclear whether the weather had anything to do with the flight
aborting its takeoff. The airline said there was an indication of an
engine issue. </p>
<p>Other airports with significant delays and cancellations included
those in Charlotte, North Carolina, Dallas-Fort Worth and Nashville.
Fifty-five passengers on three American Airlines flights that were
diverted from Dallas-Fort Worth spent the night at the Bill and Hillary
Clinton National Airport in Little Rock. </p>
<p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott urged residents to avoid driving if
possible. Some 75,000 fans were expected Friday at AT&amp;T Stadium in
Arlington for the college football championship semifinal between Texas
and Ohio State in the Cotton Bowl. </p>
<p>The polar vortex of ultra-cold air usually spins around the North
Pole, but it sometimes ventures south into the U.S., Europe and Asia.
Some experts say such events are happening more frequently,
paradoxically, because of a warming world. </p>
<p>The cold snap coincided with rare January wildfires tearing through
the Los Angeles area. </p>
<p>Southern discomfort </p>
<p>As much as 8 inches (about 20 centimeters) of snow was forecast in
parts of Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee and West Virginia through
Saturday, the National Weather Service said. Snow and ice were likely to
accumulate Friday across metro Atlanta, making roadways treacherous and
possibly causing power outages. </p>
<p>More than 1 million public school students in metro Atlanta and north
Georgia got a snow day or were at home learning online. </p>
<p>After a disastrous winter storm in 2014 left thousands of
Atlanta-area workers and schoolchildren stranded overnight away from
home, officials in Georgia were quick to cancel in-person classes and
close offices Friday. </p>
<p>Schools close</p>
<p>Many schools canceled classes Friday in Alabama’s northern half,
where roads were largely covered in snow or ice and some were already
impassible, the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency said. </p>
<p>Tennessee’s largest school district, Memphis-Shelby County Schools,
closed all schools Friday. Tours at Graceland, Elvis Presley’s former
home-turned-museum, were canceled, a spokeswoman said. </p>
<p>Parts of South Carolina were seeing their first wintry weather in
three years. The state Department of Transportation treated interstates
and other major highways from Columbia northward, but vehicles were
slipping off icy Interstate 95 south of the city. Some schools
closed. </p>
<p>With snow, sleet and freezing rain expected across North Carolina, a
public outdoor inauguration ceremony Saturday in Raleigh, North
Carolina, for Governor Josh Stein and other elected officials was
canceled. The storm’s trajectory overlapped with much of the western
North Carolina area impacted by Hurricane Helene last year.</p>
