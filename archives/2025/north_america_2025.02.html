<p>
Affordable EV leases are “the car market’s hottest deal,”

to</a> <em><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></em>. Car companies are
changing the way they pitch EVs to buyers, offering short-term leases
with low monthly payments. These deals are attractive to first-time EV
shoppers who are still a little bit hesitant to commit, as well as
people on a tighter budget. Roughly 45% of EV transactions at the end of
2024 were leases, much higher than the auto industry as a whole. And a
provision in the Inflation Reduction Act means leased cars can more
easily qualify for the government’s $7,500 EV tax credit. “The
proliferation of lease deals has made EVs more accessible to buyers who
couldn’t afford their higher sticker prices,” the
<em><em>Journal</em></em> said. “For the automakers, it is helping get
more EVs into customers’ hands after a choppy start for their
electric-car operations.”

<li>Wind power generation could surpass coal in EU

<p>
Wind power could overtake coal in Europe for electricity generation for
the first time this year, according to the energy think tank Ember. At
the end of 2024, wind power was closing in on coal, coming in at just 4%
below the fossil fuel in power generation as the continent’s coal plants
close. “That output gap could easily be made up over the course of 2025
by an increase in regional wind generation capacity or by higher average
wind speeds at turbine level, or by some combination of both,”

administration unveils new rules for AI chip, model exports</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>— The Biden administration announced Monday new restrictions on the
export of the most advanced artificial intelligence chips and
proprietary parameters used to govern the interactions of users with AI
systems.</p>
<p>The rule, which will undergo a 120-day period for public comments,
comes in response to what administration officials described as a need
to protect national security while also clarifying the rules under which
companies in trusted partner countries could access the emerging
technology in order to promote innovation.</p>
<p>“Over the coming years, AI will become really ubiquitous in every
business application in every industry around the world, with enormous
potential for enhanced productivity and societal, healthcare and
economic benefits,” Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told reporters.
“That being said, as AI becomes more powerful, the risks to our national
security become even more intense.”</p>
<p>A senior administration official said the new rule will not include
any restrictions on chip sales to Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark,
Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New
Zealand, Norway, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, United Kingdom or
the United States.</p>
<p>Countries that are under U.S. arms embargoes are already subject to
export restrictions on advanced AI chips, but a senior administration
official said they will now be under restrictions for the transfer of
the most powerful closed weight AI models.</p>
<p>The weights in an AI model determine how it processes the inputs from
a user and determines what to provide the user as a response, according
to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration. In a
closed weight system, those parameters are secret, unlike with an open
weight system in which users could see the settings the model is using
to make its decisions.</p>
<p>The majority of countries — those not included in the close partner
or arms embargo lists — will not face licensing requirements for
obtaining the equivalent of 1,700 of the most advanced AI chips
currently available, nor for any less advanced chips.</p>
<p>Companies in the United States and allied countries will not face
restrictions in using the most powerful closed weight AI systems,
provided they are stored under adequate security, a senior
administration official said.</p>
<p>“I think the key point I would underscore is that we identified
really some of the closest security allies of the United States that
have effectively implemented and have a well-documented record of
upholding a robust AI technology protection regime, and generally have
technology ecosystems that promote the use of AI and other advanced
technologies consistent with our national security and foreign policy
interests,” a senior administration official said.</p>

warn of ‘explosive fire growth’ conditions amid deadly California
wildfires</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Firefighters in southern California are battling to bring multiple
major Los Angeles area wildfires under control Monday as forecasters
warn of renewed strong winds that could cause “explosive fire
growth.”</p>
<p>The new wind threat, with the biggest concern happening Tuesday, is
expected to bring sustained winds of 80 kph and gusts up to about 110
kph, the National Weather Service warned.</p>
<p>Strong winds and dry conditions in an area that has not received
significant rainfall for more than eight months helped fuel the fires
that have already killed at least 24 people and caused billions of
dollars in damage since they began a week ago.</p>
<p>A brief reprieve in the winds in recent days allowed firefighters
aided by air drops of water and fire retardant to make some progress in
bringing the blazes under control.</p>
<p>Of the three major fires still burning in the Los Angeles area, Cal
Fire said late Sunday the Palisades Fire was 13% contained and has
burned 96 square kilometers.</p>
<p>Eight of the deaths were attributed to the Palisades Fire in the
Pacific Palisades area, officials said.</p>
<p>Sixteen deaths were from the Eaton Fire, located farther inland in
North Pasadena and Altadena, which was 27% contained and has burned
nearly 60 square kilometers.</p>
<p>Another blaze, the Hurst Fire in the Sylmar area, was 89% contained,
Cal Fire said, after burning more than three square kilometers.</p>
<p>The fires together have destroyed more than 12,000 structures.</p>
<p>About 100,000 people remained under evacuation orders late Sunday,
with officials saying people would not be allowed back in fire risk
areas while the new wind warnings were still in place.</p>
<p>Some schools that had canceled classes last week were resuming
operations Monday. The National Basketball Association’s Los Angeles
Lakers and Los Angeles Clippers were also set to resume home games
Monday after canceling games due to the fires.</p>
<p>Local officials expressed fears that as the fires spread, they could
endanger more highly populated areas and threaten some of the city’s key
landmarks, including the J. Paul Getty Museum, which houses renowned art
works, and the University of California, Los Angeles, one of the top
public U.S. universities.</p>
<p>California Governor Gavin Newsom told NBC’s “Meet the Press” on
Sunday that the wildfires could be the worst natural disaster in U.S.
history, “in terms of just the costs associated with it, in terms of the
scale and scope.”</p>
<p>A preliminary estimate by AccuWeather put the damage and economic
losses so far between $135 billion and $150 billion. The damages are so
high in part because much of the housing that has burned to the ground
is among the costliest in the country.</p>
<p>Newsom called for an independent review of how the fires raged on,
with firefighters at times facing a shortage of water to fight the
blazes as they quickly spread out of control.</p>
<p>The governor said he is asking the same questions “that people out on
the streets are asking, yelling about, ‘What the hell happened? What
happened to the water system?’</p>
<p>Newsom said he wants to know whether the water supply was simply
overwhelmed, “Or were 99 mile-an-hour winds determinative and there was
really no firefight that could’ve been more meaningful?”</p>
<p>Firefighting crews from California and nine other states are part of
the ongoing response that includes 1,354 fire engines, 84 aircraft and
more than 14,000 personnel, including newly arrived firefighters from
Mexico.</p>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Sunday he told officials
to prepare for the possibility of sending 150 Ukrainian firefighters to
help the effort in California.</p>
<p>“The situation there is extremely difficult, and Ukrainians can help
Americans save lives,” Zelenskyy said.</p>

<p>President-elect Donald Trump pledges to reduce government spending
when he takes office. He has tasked billionaire businessman Elon Musk
and Vivek Ramaswamy, who’s worth an estimated $950 million, to lead the
Department of Government Efficiency, a proposed presidential advisory

76ers won’t build disputed $1.3B downtown stadium</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania — The Philadelphia 76ers have decided not
to build a $1.3 billion downtown arena, a surprising move that comes
just weeks after the team received approval for the controversial
project from the city council.</p>
<p>The Philadelphia Inquirer reported Sunday that multiple council
members had confirmed the change in plans. The team has struck a deal
with Comcast Spectacor to remain in the city’s sports stadium district,
the newspaper said, but further details about the new proposal have not
been released.</p>
<p>The 76ers, the mayor’s office and Comcast Spectacor — which owns the
Wells Fargo Center, where the team currently plays — did not respond
Sunday to requests for comment. The team rents the arena from Comcast
Spectacor, which also owns the Philadelphia Flyers of the NHL, who also
play there.</p>
<p>The council had voted on Dec. 19 to approve the downtown arena after
more than two years of heated debate over the proposal, and the owners
of the NBA team had hoped to move into what would be called 76 Place by
2031. The council vote came despite vocal opposition from nearby
Chinatown residents and other activists.</p>
<p>“I’m so livid right now I don’t even know what to do,” Jimmy Harrity,
an at-large member of the council, told the newspaper. Harrity, who
supported the team’s move, said, “I feel as though I was used as a
pawn.”</p>
<p>Mayor Cherelle Parker, a Democrat who had championed the plan, has
said the entire city will benefit from what she called a “historic
game-changing economic development project.” Supporters had hoped the
18,500-seat arena would help revive a distressed retail corridor called
Market East, which runs from City Hall to the Liberty Bell. The area has
struggled for years despite several redevelopment efforts.</p>
<p>The team owners, Harris Blitzer Sports &amp; Entertainment, had
pushed for city approval by year’s end so they could meet their target
opening date. They had vowed not to ask the city for any construction
funding, although they were free to seek state and federal funds.
Instead of property taxes, they would have paid about $6 million in
annual payments in lieu of taxes.</p>
<p>Opponents feared the arena would bring gridlock on game days as well
as gentrification and rising rents to the area.</p>
<p>The Chinatown community has fought a series of proposed developments
since the 1960s, including casinos, a prison, a baseball stadium and a
highway, the last of which dissected the neighborhood when it opened in
1991.</p>

Angeles wildfires rage on despite added firefighting resources</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Wildfires in the Los Angeles, California, area are raging and weather
conditions aren’t helping matters, with winds picking back up. VOA’s
Veronica Balderas Iglesias has the story.</p>

id="fires-burn-los-angeles-schools-destroy-outdoor-education-sanctuaries">Fires
burn Los Angeles schools, destroy outdoor education sanctuaries</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>For Irina Contreras, a program manager for Los Angeles County’s
Department of Arts and Culture, outdoor education was a refuge for both
her and her daughter during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Now, much of that refuge has been burned in the raging wildfires
around Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Her 7-year-old daughter, Ceiba, hikes with a kid’s adventure group
called Hawks and attended Matilija, a bilingual forest school for
preschool and kindergarten. Rain or shine, she and her friends would
spend their days climbing, jumping, hiking, and swimming in places like
Eaton Canyon Nature Area, a 77-hectare (190-acre) preserve near
Altadena, now destroyed by fire.</p>
<p>Ceiba learned to ask plants for permission before taking samples to
glue into her nature journal. Once, her group discovered a hidden path
that led behind a waterfall. Ceiba couldn’t stop talking about it for
days.</p>
<p>For parents like Contreras, the wildfires have been devastating not
just because of the loss of life and thousands of homes. They are
mourning natural and educational areas that served as sanctuaries and
learning spaces for local families, especially in the years since the
pandemic. The fires have torn through natural areas that served every
type of educational setting: public and private schools, nature-based
preschools, homeschool groups, summer camps and more.</p>
<p>“It’s about so much more than what she’s been learning,” Contreras
said. “I can speak with absolute confidence that it totally affected me,
personally.”</p>
<p>The fires have burned school buildings, too, including Odyssey
Charter School in Altadena, which Miguel Ordenana’s children attend.</p>
<p>“The community has been devastated by the fire,” said Ordenana,
senior manager of community science at the Natural History Museum. “It’s
been a challenge to carefully share that news with my children and help
them work through their emotions. A lot of their friends lost their
homes. And we don’t know the impact to school staff, like their
teachers, but a lot of them live in that area as well and have lost
their homes.”</p>
<p>Some areas untouched by fire were inaccessible because of poor air
quality. Griffith Park, home of the Hollywood sign, had not been
affected by the end of the week but it’s not clear when the air quality
there will be good enough to resume outdoor programs, said Ordenana, who
was the first to capture on camera a late puma in the nearby area that
gained fame under the name P-22.</p>
<p>Ordenana said his family was able to connect with some other families
from Odyssey Charter School for pizza and an indoor playdate, but he is
uncertain what the days will look like for them with school closures
already extending through next week.</p>
<p>All schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District, the nation’s
second largest, were closed Friday because of heavy smoke and ash over
the city. Classes will not resume until conditions improve, officials
said. Pasadena Unified School District also closed schools and several
of its campuses sustained damage, including Eliot Arts Magnet Middle
School.</p>
<p>The California Department of Education released a statement Wednesday
saying 335 schools from Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Riverside, Ventura,
and San Diego counties were closed. It was unclear how many would be
closed Monday.</p>
<p>During the pandemic, Contreras felt like she was stuck on a screen.
She devoted much of her energy to working, writing and organizing, but
her daughter’s outdoor education helped her better understand the value
of stepping away from the grind.</p>
<p>Contreras feels confident the outdoor programs will return, although
it’s unclear when it will be safe for people to hike around areas like
Eaton Canyon.</p>
<p>“The nature center is gone,” Richard Smart, superintendent of the
Eaton Canyon Natural Area in Pasadena, said Thursday. “The wildflowers,
the shrubs are gone.” The park hosted dozens of school field trips a
year and Smart estimates more than a thousand students visited
yearly.</p>
<p>“Teachers liked it because it was also free, it was local, it was
nearby. And it was a place to see nature — wild nature but also in a
friendly, safe environment,” he said.</p>
<p>Only a few exterior walls of the Eaton Canyon Nature Center were left
standing, he said.</p>
<p>“For many of the local school districts, we truly were in their
backyard, and now they won’t be able to use it for the foreseeable
future,” he said. “The park is such a touchstone for people in the
community, and so to lose that is just, devastating is not even the
right word. It feels indescribable.”</p>
<p>Many parents and teachers are likely wondering what to do and where
to take their children as fires continue to burn across Los Angeles,
said Lila Higgins, a senior manager for community science at the Natural
History Museum and author of “Wild L.A,” a field trip and nature
guidebook.</p>
<p>A certified forest therapy guide, Higgins says time in nature lowers
heart rates, lowers blood pressure and helps children with attention
deficit disorder feel more calm and relaxed.</p>
<p>“For children’s cognitive development, time in nature and time spent
connecting with nature is so important,” Higgins said. Outdoor spaces
also can help children learn how to develop relationships through
connections with animals, understand orientation through space by
following trails and map-reading and understand human impact on
wildlife.</p>
<p>“A lot of the places that we’re talking about are really popular with
homeschoolers, but they also are a destination for some field trips,
certainly places like Eaton Canyon,” said Greg Pauly, co-author of “Wild
L.A.” and director of the Urban Nature Research Center at the museum. “I
do think it’s safe to say that people are going to continue to be
interacting with those landscapes and it will hopefully still be a field
trip destination in the future. But it’s certainly going to be a while
before that happens.”</p>
<p>“This is the reality of modern Southern California,” he said. “Fire
changes the landscape and people’s lives shockingly often.”</p>

id="california-wildfires-could-be-leaving-deeper-inequality-in-their-wake">California
wildfires could be leaving deeper inequality in their wake</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ALTADENA, Calif. — The sight of celebrity mansions and movie
landmarks reduced to ashes can make it seem like the wildfires roaring
through the Los Angeles area affected a constellation of movie
stars. </p>
<p>But a drive through the charred neighborhoods around Altadena shows
that the fires also burned through a remarkable haven for generations of
Black families avoiding discriminatory housing practices elsewhere. They
have been communities of racial and economic diversity, where many
people own their own homes. </p>
<p>Some now fear the most destructive fires in California’s history have
altered that for good. Recovery and rebuilding may be out of reach for
many, and pressures of gentrification could be renewed. </p>
<p>Samantha Santoro, 22, a first-generation college student at Cal Poly
Pomona, remembered being annoyed when the initial news coverage of the
wildfires focused more on celebrities. She and her sister, who attends
UC Berkeley, worry how their Mexican immigrant parents and working-class
neighbors who lost their homes in Altadena will move forward. </p>
<p>“We don’t have like, ‘Oh, I’ll just go to my second home and stay
there,’” Santoro said. </p>
<p>The landlord of their family’s two-bedroom house with a pool had
never increased the $1,650 rent, making it possible for the Santoros to
affordably raise their daughters. Now, they’re temporarily staying with
a relative in Pasadena. The family has renters insurance but not much
else. </p>
<p>“I think it’s hard to believe that you have nothing,” Santoro said,
through tears, thinking of her parents. “Everything that they ever
worked for was in that house.” </p>
<p>Altadena had been a mix of tiny bungalows and magnificent mansions.
The community of 42,000 includes blue-collar families, artists,
entertainment industry workers and white-collar ones. About 58% of
residents are non-white, with one-fourth of them Hispanic and nearly a
fifth Black, according to Census data. </p>
<p>During the Civil Rights era, Altadena became a rare land of
opportunity for Black Americans to reach middle class without the
discriminatory practices of denying them access to credit. They kept
homes within the family and helped others to flourish. Today, the Black
home ownership rate there is at 81.5%, almost double the national
rate. </p>
<p>That’s impressive considering 92% of the 15,000 residences in
Altadena are single-family homes, according to the 2023 Census American
Community Survey. The median income is over $129,000. Just over 7% of
residents live in poverty. </p>
<p>Victoria Knapp, chair of the Altadena Town Council, worries that the
fires have irreparably changed the landscape for these families. </p>
<p>“Someone is going to buy it and develop who knows what on it. And
that is going to change the character of Altadena,” Knapp said, adding
that those with fewer resources will be disproportionately hurt. </p>
<p>The family of Kenneth Snowden, 57, was one of the Black families able
to purchase a home in 1962. That house, as well as the one Snowden
bought almost 20 years ago, are both gone. </p>
<p>He is challenging state and federal officials to help all
fire-affected communities fairly because “your $40 million home is no
different than my $2 million home.” </p>
<p>Snowden wants the ability to acquire home loans with 0% interest.
“Give us the ability to rebuild, restart our lives,” he said. “If you
can spend billions of dollars fighting a war, you can spend a billion
dollars to help us get back where we were at.” </p>
<p>Shawn Brown lost not only her home but also the public charter school
she founded in Altadena. She had a message for fellow Black homeowners
who might be tempted with offers for their property: “I would tell them
to stand strong, rebuild, continue the generational progress of African
Americans.” </p>
<p>She and other staff at Pasadena Rosebud Academy are trying to raise
money to rebuild while looking at temporary sites in churches. </p>
<p>But even some churches have burned. At Altadena Baptist Church, the
bell tower is pretty much the only thing still standing. </p>
<p>The Rev. George Van Alstine and others are trying to help more than
10 church members who lost homes with needs like navigating insurance
and federal aid. The pastor is worried the fires will lead to
gentrification, with Black parishioners, who make up half the
congregation, paying the price. </p>
<p>“We’re seeing a number of families who are probably going to have to
move out of the area because rebuilding in Altadena will be too
expensive for them,” he said. </p>
<p>The 32-year-old photographer Daniela Dawson, who had been working two
jobs to meet the $2,200 rent for her studio apartment, fled the
wildfires with her Hyundai SUV and her cat, Lola. She lost almost
everything else, including thousands of dollars of photography
gear. </p>
<p>She did not have renter’s insurance. “Obviously now I’m thinking
about it. Wish I had it,” she said. </p>
<p>Dawson plans to return to Arizona, where she lived previously, and
regroup. But she likely won’t be returning to Altadena.</p>

id="den-of-thieves-2-is-no.-1-at-box-office-as-better-man-flops">‘Den of
Thieves 2’ is No. 1 at box office as ‘Better Man’ flops</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — On a quiet weekend in movie theaters, while much of
Hollywood’s attention was on the wildfires that continue to rage in Los
Angeles, Lionsgate’s “Den of Thieves 2: Pantera” debuted atop the box
office with $15.5 million, according to studio estimates Sunday.</p>
<p>Mid-January is often a slow moviegoing period, and that was slightly
exacerbated by the closures of about 10 theaters in Los Angeles, the
country’s top box-office market.</p>
<p>A sequel to the Gerard Butler 2018 heist thriller, “Den of Thieves 2”
performed similarly to the original. The first installment, released by
STX, opened with $15.2 million seven years ago. O’Shea Jackson
Jr. co-stars in the sequel, which debuted in 3,008 North American
theaters.</p>
<p>Butler’s films are becoming something of a regular feature in
January. He also starred in “Plane,” which managed $32.1 million after
launching on Jan. 13 in 2023.</p>
<p>“Den of Thieves 2,” made for about $40 million, was a bit more costly
to make. Audiences liked it well enough, giving it a “B+” CinemaScore.
Reviews (58% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) weren’t particularly good. But it
counted as Lionsgate’s first No.1 opening since “The Hunger Games: The
Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes” in November 2023.</p>
<p>Also entering wide release over the weekend was the Robbie Williams
movie “Better Man,” one of the more audacious spins on the music biopic
in recent years. Rather than going the more tradition routes of Elton
John (“Rocketman”) or Elvis Presley (“Elvis”), the British popstar is
portrayed by a CGI chimpanzee in Michael Gracey’s film.</p>
<p>The Paramount Pictures release, produced for $110 million and
acquired by Paramount for $25 million, didn’t catch on much better than
Williams’ previous forays into the United States. It tanked, with $1.1
million in ticket sales from 1,291 locations. Gracey’s previous feature,
2017’s “The Greatest Showman” ($459 million worldwide), fared far better
in theaters. Reviews, however, have been very good for “Better Man.”</p>
<p>It was bested by “The Last Showgirl,” the Las Vegas drama starring
Pamela Anderson. The Roadside Attractions release expanded to 870
theaters and collected $1.5 million.</p>
<p>Also outdoing “Better Man” was Brady Corbet’s “The Brutalist.” Coming
off winning best drama at the Golden Globes, the A24 postwar epic
grossed a hefty $1.4 million from just 68 locations. It will expand
wider in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>The weekend’s lion share of business went to holiday holdovers,
including “Mufasa: The Lion King,” “Sonic the Hedgehog 3,” “Nosferatu”
and “Moana 2.”</p>
<p>In its fourth week of release, Barry Jenkins “Mufasa” continued to do
well, adding $13.2 million to bring its total to $539.7 million
worldwide. Also on its fourth weekend, “Sonic the Hedgehog 3” padded its
$384.8 million global total with $11 million. Robert Eggers’
“Nosferatu,” the surprise hit of the Christmas period, collected $6.8
million in ticket sales, bringing the vampire tale to $81.1 million
domestically.</p>
<p>The Walt Disney Co.’s “Moana 2,” in its seventh week of release,
added $6.5 million to bring its global tally to $989.8 million. In the
coming days, it will become the third Disney film released in 2024 to
notch $1 billion, joining “Inside Out 2” and “Deadpool and
Wolverine.”</p>
<p>Final domestic figures will be released Monday. Estimated ticket
sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according
to Comscore:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>“Den of Thieves 2: Pantera,” $15.5 million.</p></li>
<li><p>“Mufasa: The Lion King,” $13.2 million.</p></li>

Jan. 6 participants who committed violence ‘obviously’ shouldn’t be
pardoned</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Vice President-elect JD Vance says people responsible
for the violence during the Capitol riot “obviously” should not be
pardoned, as President-elect Donald Trump is promising to use his
clemency power on behalf of many of those who tried on Jan. 6, 2021, to
overturn the results of the election that Trump lost. </p>
<p>Vance insisted in an interview on “Fox News Sunday” that the pardon
question is “very simple,” saying those who “protested peacefully”
should be pardoned and “if you committed violence on that day, obviously
you shouldn’t be pardoned.” He later said there was a “bit of a gray
area” in some cases. </p>
<p>More than 1,500 people have been charged with federal crimes stemming
from the siege that left more than 100 police officers injured and sent
lawmakers running into hiding as they met to certify Democrat Joe
Biden’s 2020 victory. </p>
<p>Hundreds of people who did not engage in destruction or violence were
charged only with misdemeanor offenses for illegally entering the
Capitol. Others were charged with felony offenses, including assault for
beating police officers.</p>
<p>Leaders of the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys extremist groups were
convicted of seditious conspiracy for what prosecutors described as
plots to use violence to stop the peaceful transfer of power from Trump,
the Republican incumbent, to Biden. </p>
<p>In a post on X, Vance responded to criticism from supporters of the
Capitol rioters that his position did not go far enough to free all
convicted. “I’ve been defending these guys for years,” he said. </p>
<p>“The president saying he’ll look at each case (and me saying the
same) is not some walkback,” Vance said. “I assure you, we care about
people unjustly locked up. Yes, that includes people provoked and it
includes people who got a garbage trial.”</p>

<h2 id="los-angeles-fires-death-toll-rises-to-at-least-24">Los Angeles
fires death toll rises to at least 24</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The death toll in the wildfires that are raging in the Los Angeles
area rose to at least 24 late Sunday, with officials worried that more
bodies will be found by searchers and cadaver dogs in the neighborhoods
that have been leveled by the blazes. </p>
<p>Roaring flames continued to ravage the West Coast state of California
as the top U.S. emergency official warned that increasing winds could
pose new threats in the coming days.</p>
<p>“The winds are potentially getting stronger and dangerous,” Deanne
Criswell, the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency,
or FEMA, told CNN’s “State of the Union” show. “You never know which way
they’re going.”</p>
<p>Local officials expressed fears that as the fires spread, they could
endanger more highly populated areas and threaten some of the city’s key
landmarks, including the J. Paul Getty Museum, which houses renowned art
works, and the University of California, Los Angeles, one of the top
public U.S. universities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>California Senator Adam Schiff told CNN that driving through the
devastated communities “frankly reminded me of visiting war zones. There
are whole neighborhoods that are gone. We haven’t seen this before.”</p>
<p>“The heartbreak is just overwhelming,” he said. </p>
<p>California Governor Gavin Newsom told NBC’s “Meet the Press” that the
wildfires could be the worst natural disaster in U.S. history, “in terms
of just the costs associated with it, in terms of the scale and
scope.” </p>
<p>A preliminary estimate by AccuWeather put the damage and economic
losses so far between $135 billion and $150 billion. The damages are so
high in part because much of the housing that has burned to the ground
is among the costliest in the country. </p>
<p>Watch related report by Veronica Balderas Iglesias:</p>
<p>Newsom called for an independent review of how the fires raged on,
with firefighters at times facing a shortage of water to fight the
blazes as they quickly spread out of control.</p>
<p>The governor said he is asking the same questions “that people out on
the streets are asking, yelling about, ‘What the hell happened? What
happened to the water system?’</p>
<p>Newsom said he wants to know whether the water supply was simply
overwhelmed, “Or were 99 mile-an-hour winds determinative and there was
really no firefight that could’ve been more meaningful?”</p>
<p>“All of us want to know those answers, and I just don’t want to wait
because people are asking me. I want to know those facts,” he said. “I
want them objectively determined, and let the chips fall where they may.
This is not about finger pointing.”</p>
<p>The governor said he is asking the same questions “that people out on
the streets are asking, yelling about, ‘What the hell happened? What
happened to the water system?’</p>
<p>Newsom on Friday ordered state officials to determine why a
440-million-liter reservoir was out of service and some hydrants had run
dry.</p>
<p>Firefighters raced Saturday to get in front of the largest and most
destructive blaze burning in Los Angeles as it shifted directions and
grew by about 400 hectares. The Santa Ana winds that fueled the blazes
are forecast to return. </p>
<p>“We need to be aggressive out there,” California Department of
Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) Operations Chief Christian Litz
told reporters at a Saturday briefing. </p>
<p>The National Weather Service predicted winds picking up Saturday
night into Sunday morning in the area and again late Monday through
Tuesday morning, with sustained winds up to 48 kph and gusts up to 112
kph.</p>
<p>Four active fires in the Los Angeles region have burned more than
16,000 hectares, with flames destroying more than 12,000 structures.
About 150,000 people have been ordered to evacuate their homes, with 700
people taking refuge in nine shelters. The causes of all four blazes
remain under investigation.</p>
<p>Officials said two of the fires were 90- and 76% contained but the
other two only 11- and 15%. The Palisades fire, the largest and only 11%
contained, is threatening to jump over a major highway, Interstate 405,
into a more heavily populated area.</p>
<p>Jim Hudson, a Cal Fire incident commander, told reporters that
firefighters have three priorities: “Life, your property and permanent
control” of the flames.</p>
<p>Firefighting crews from California and nine other states are part of
the ongoing response that includes 1,354 fire engines, 84 aircraft and
more than 14,000 personnel, including newly arrived firefighters from
Mexico.</p>

id="court-ruling-will-help-new-mexico-stay-a-go-to-state-for-women-seeking-abortions">Court
ruling will help New Mexico stay a go-to state for women seeking
abortions</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SANTA FE, NEW MEXICO — The New Mexico Supreme Court on Thursday
struck down abortion restrictions by conservative cities and counties,
helping to ensure the state remains a go-to destination for people from
other states with bans.</p>
<p>The unanimous opinion, in response to a request from state Attorney
General Raúl Torrez, reinforces the state’s position as having some of
the most liberal abortion laws in the country.</p>
<p>Attorneys representing the cities of Hobbs and Clovis and Lea and
Roosevelt counties had argued that provisions of a federal “anti-vice”
law known as the Comstock Act block courts from striking down local
abortion ordinances.</p>
<p>But Justice C. Shannon Bacon, writing for the majority opinion, said
state law precludes cities and counties from restricting abortion or
regulating abortion clinics.</p>
<p>“The ordinances violate this core precept and invade the
Legislature’s authority to regulate access to and provision of
reproductive healthcare,” she wrote. “We hold the ordinances are
preempted in their entirety.”</p>
<p>New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez praised the court’s ruling
Thursday, saying that the core of the argument was that state laws
preempted any action by local governments to engage in activities that
would infringe on the constitutional rights of citizens.</p>
<p>“The bottom line is simply this: Abortion access is safe and secure
in New Mexico,” he said. “It’s enshrined in law by the recent ruling by
the New Mexico Supreme Court and thanks to the work of the New Mexico
Legislature.”</p>
<p>New Mexico House Speaker Javier Martínez called access to health care
a basic fundamental right in New Mexico.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t take a genius to understand the statutory framework that
we have. Local governments don’t regulate health care in New Mexico. It
is up to the state,” the Albuquerque Democrat said.</p>
<p>Opposition to abortion runs deep in New Mexico communities along the
border with Texas, which has one of the most restrictive bans in the
U.S.</p>
<p>But Democrats, who control every statewide elected office in New
Mexico and hold majorities in the state House and Senate, have moved to
shore up access to abortion — before and after the U.S. Supreme Court
overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, eliminating the nationwide right to
abortion.</p>
<p>In 2021, the New Mexico Legislature repealed a dormant 1969 statute
that outlawed most abortion procedures as felonies, ensuring access to
abortion even after the Roe v. Wade reversal.</p>
<p>And in 2023, Democratic New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed
a bill that overrides local ordinances aimed at limiting abortion access
and enacted a shield law that protects abortion providers from
investigations by other states.</p>
<p>In September, construction began on a state-funded reproductive
health and abortion clinic in southern New Mexico that will cater to
local residents and people who travel from neighboring states.</p>
<p>The new clinic is scheduled for completion by early 2026 to provide
services ranging from medical and procedural abortions to contraception,
cervical cancer screenings and education about adoptions.</p>
<p>In Thursday’s opinion, justices said they “strongly admonish”
Roosevelt County, in particular, for an ordinance that would have
allowed individuals to file lawsuits demanding damages of more than
$100,000 for violations of the county’s abortion ordinance.</p>
<p>The provision would have created “a private right of action and
damages award that is clearly intended to punish protected conduct,” the
court said in its opinion.</p>
<p>Erin Hawley, a vice president at Alliance Defending Freedom, an
Arizona-based Christian legal advocacy group, is an attorney who argued
on behalf of Roosevelt County in the case. On Thursday, she criticized
the court’s decision and emphasized its limitations.</p>
<p>“Roosevelt County and other New Mexico localities should be able to
enforce ordinances that comply with federal law and protect the lives of
their citizens,” said Hawley, the wife of U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley of
Missouri. “We’re grateful that the New Mexico Supreme Court did not
abandon common sense and find a so-called right to abortion in the state
constitution.”</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear whether the ruling can be appealed in
federal court or influence broader efforts to apply Comstock Act
restrictions on abortion. The New Mexico Supreme Court opinion
explicitly declined to address conflicts with federal law, basing its
decision solely on state provisions.</p>
<p>Austin, Texas-based attorney Jonathan Mitchell, a former Texas
solicitor general and architect of that state’s strict abortion ban,
said he looked forward “to litigating these issues in other states and
bringing the meaning of the federal Comstock Act to the Supreme Court of
the United States.”</p>

id="scarves-over-headscarves-muslim-womens-outdoors-group-tackles-snow-tubing-in-minnesota">Scarves
over headscarves, Muslim women’s outdoors group tackles snow tubing in
Minnesota</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MAPLE GROVE, Minnesota — Ice crystals clung to the eyelashes, parka
hood, beanie hat and headscarf of Ruqayah Nasser as she took a break
after her first-ever snow tubing runs in a Minnesota park on a -18
Celsius January morning.</p>
<p>She had joined two dozen other members of a group founded by a
Somali-American mother in Minneapolis to promote all-seasons activities
among Muslim women, who might otherwise feel singled out in the great
outdoors, especially when wearing hijabs.</p>
<p>“They understand my lifestyle. I don’t have to explain myself,” said
Nasser, who recently moved to the Twin Cities from Chicago and whose
family hails from Yemen. “My religion is everything. It’s my survival
kit.”</p>
<p>As one of the most visible signs of the Muslim faith, hijabs often
attract controversy. Within Islam, some women want to wear the
headscarves for piety and modesty, while others oppose them as a symbol
of oppression. In the sports world, including in the last Olympics,
devout athletes have often faced extra hurdles on and off the field in
finding accommodations for religious practices.</p>
<p>Concerned about safety as a woman — particularly one wearing a head
covering — but determined to get outdoors to beat seasonal depression,
Nasrieen Habib put out a social media post about creating a hiking group
three years ago.</p>
<p>From the nine women who responded, her Amanah Rec Project has grown
to more than 700 members. There’s a core group for Muslim women only —
for “more sisterhood and modesty,” Habib says — as well as a group for
families. In addition to weekly outings, they organize longer trips and
education on everything from appropriate winter clothing — a challenge
for many migrant communities — to health and environmental
sustainability from the perspective of Islam.</p>
<p>“It’s a way to live your whole life according to a set of beliefs and
rules. And part of those beliefs and rules is taking care of creation,”
Habib said as her 4-year-old son took a break from tubing in a toasty
chalet at Elm Creek Park Reserve near Minneapolis. “How can we be more
sustainable in a time where we see the impact of climate change,
especially impacting people who look like us in the Global South?”</p>
<p>Two sisters, Ruun Mahamud and Nawal Hirsi, moved to the United States
from Somalia as children about two decades ago.</p>
<p>They found a safe haven in Minnesota where, since the late 1990s,
growing numbers of East African refugees have created an increasingly
vocal Muslim community. Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar was the first
lawmaker to wear a hijab while on the U.S. House floor, and Minneapolis
was the first large city in the United States to allow the Islamic call
to prayer to be broadcast publicly by its two dozen mosques.</p>
<p>Even though she feels “safe and accepted” in her hijab, Hirsi joined
the group for extra support.</p>
<p>“I love being outdoors and joining this group has made me more
comfortable to participate,” she said on the tubing hill, where she had
convinced Mahamud to come along for the first time.</p>
<p>“Oh my gosh, it’s the most amazing thing I’ve ever done,” Mahamud
gushed after speeding downhill on a tube attached to her sister’s as
their daughters recorded the adventure on their phones.</p>
<p>The sisters said it’s important to include love for the outdoors and
physical activity in their children’s religious upbringing.</p>
<p>“Taking care of one’s health is part of our faith,” Hirsi said.</p>
<p>Muslim women who wear hijabs can face multiple barriers to sports
participation, said Umer Hussain, a Wilkes University professor who
studies religion and sports. They range from activities where genders
mix or head coverings pose logistical hurdles to conservative families
who might frown on it.</p>
<p>Groups like Habib’s tackle empowering women in their communities as
well as raising awareness about religious accommodations like single-sex
spaces or locations for prayer.</p>
<p>“The biggest barrier, for women specifically, is having access to
spaces that allow us to practice our religion while keeping our modesty
and abiding by the Islamic laws that tell us we are not supposed to be
in mixed spaces without covering up,” Habib said.</p>
<p>She appears to have tapped into a great demand.</p>
<p>“When she told me she was going to start a hiking group to get
sisters out in nature … it was like actually something I’ve been looking
for for a very long time,” Makiya Amin said as she climbed up the tubing
hill in a long white skirt, bright-red headscarf, and heavy winter coat.
“I didn’t really have those type of people who were outdoorsy already
around me.”</p>
<p>Isho Mohamed joined the group for the wide-ranging conversations as
much as for the outdoors, which as a self-described “homebody” she had
largely avoided since college days.</p>
<p>“It’s a safe space that takes me out of my comfort zone,” she said of
the group outings. During them, the women share about work experiences
but also life as immigrants and, most importantly, their faith.</p>
<p>“We also talk about spiritual connection and connecting with God as
well, and just say a little prayer here and there when we’re walking,”
Mohamed added.</p>
<p>Her cheeks glowing above her ski mask after two hours on the hill,
Jorida Latifi was with her 7-year-old son among the last to hang up
their snow tubes. Originally from Albania, Latifi has gone out with the
group almost weekly since joining more than a year ago.</p>
<p>“With Muslim sisters … they do understand you, what you go through,
even with the clothing and hijabs,” Latifi said. “It feels way, way more
like, you know, where you are with family.”</p>

honors Pope Francis with the Presidential Medal of Freedom</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden on Saturday honored Pope Francis
with the Presidential Medal of Freedom with distinction, the highest
civilian award given by the president, saying the pontiff was “a light
of faith, hope, and love that shines brightly across the world.”</p>
<p>Biden had been scheduled to present the medal to the pope in person
on Saturday in Rome on what was to be the final overseas trip of his
presidency, but Biden canceled his travel plans so he could monitor the
wildfires in California.</p>
<p>The White House said Biden bestowed the award to the pope during a
phone call in which they also discussed efforts to promote peace and
alleviate suffering around the world.</p>
<p>It’s the only time Biden has presented the honor with distinction
during his presidency. Biden himself is a recipient of the award with
distinction, recognized when he was vice president by then-President
Barack Obama in a surprise ceremony eight years ago. That was the only
time in Obama’s two terms that he awarded that version of the medal.</p>
<p>The citation for the pope says “his mission of serving the poor has
never ceased. A loving pastor, he joyfully answers children’s questions
about God. A challenging teacher, he commands us to fight for peace and
protect the planet. A welcoming leader, he reaches out to different
faiths.”</p>
<p>Biden is preparing to leave office Jan. 20 and has doled out honors
to prominent individuals, including supporters and allies, in recent
weeks.</p>

<h2 id="blue-origin-set-for-1st-launch-of-new-glenn-rocket">Blue Origin
set for 1st launch of New Glenn rocket</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CAPE CANAVERAL — A quarter of a century after its founding, Jeff
Bezos’ Blue Origin is finally ready for its maiden orbital voyage with a
brand-new rocket the company hopes will shake up the commercial space
race.</p>
<p>The launch initially scheduled for Sunday was pushed back a day due
to “unfavorable” sea conditions, Blue Origin posted on X.</p>
<p>Named New Glenn after legendary astronaut John Glenn — the first
American to orbit Earth in 1962 — the rocket stands 320 feet (98 meters)
tall, roughly equivalent to a 32-story building — and is set to blast
off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in a launch window that
opens at 1 a.m. (0600 GMT) Monday.</p>
<p>“Pointy end up!” the company’s CEO, Dave Limp posted on X alongside
photos of the gleaming white behemoth.</p>
<p>With the mission, dubbed NG-1, Bezos, the world’s second-richest man,
is taking direct aim at the world’s wealthiest: Elon Musk, whose company
SpaceX dominates the orbital launch market through its Falcon 9 and
Falcon Heavy rockets.</p>
<p>These serve the commercial sector, the Pentagon, and NASA —
including, crucially, ferrying astronauts to and from the International
Space Station.</p>
<p>“SpaceX has for the past several years been pretty much the only game
in town and so having a competitor… this is great,” G. Scott Hubbard, a
retired senior NASA official, told AFP.</p>
<p>SpaceX, meanwhile, is planning the next orbital test of Starship —
its gargantuan new-generation rocket — the same day, upping the sense of
high-stakes rivalry.</p>
<p>If all goes to plan, shortly after launch, Blue Origin will attempt
to land the first-stage booster on a drone ship named Jacklyn, in honor
of Bezos’ mother, stationed about 620 miles (1,000 kilometers) downrange
in the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>Though SpaceX makes such landings a near-routine spectacle, this will
be Blue Origin’s first shot at a touchdown on the high seas.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the rocket’s upper stage will fire its engines toward
Earth orbit, carrying a Defense Department-funded prototype spaceship
called Blue Ring, which will remain aboard for the roughly six-hour test
flight.</p>
<p>Limp emphasized that simply reaching orbit is the prime goal, while
successfully recovering the booster would be a welcome “bonus.”</p>
<p>Blue Origin does have experience landing its New Shepard rockets —
used for suborbital tourism — but they are much smaller and land on
terra firma rather than a ship at sea.</p>
<p>Blue Origin has secured a NASA contract to launch two Mars probes
aboard New Glenn. The rocket will also support the deployment of Project
Kuiper, a satellite internet constellation designed to compete with
Starlink.</p>
<p>Like Musk, Bezos has a lifelong passion for space. But whereas Musk
dreams of colonizing Mars, Bezos envisions shifting heavy industry
off-planet onto floating space platforms to preserve Earth, “humanity’s
blue origin.”</p>
<p>He founded Blue Origin in 2000 — two years before Musk created SpaceX
— but has adopted a more cautious pace, in contrast to his rival’s “fail
fast, learn fast” philosophy.</p>
<p>“There’s been impatience within the space community over Blue
Origin’s very deliberate approach,” Scott Pace, a space policy analyst
at George Washington University and former member of the National Space
Council, told AFP.</p>
<p>If New Glenn succeeds, Pace added, it will give the U.S. government
“dissimilar redundancy” — valuable backup if one system fails.</p>

id="trump-prosecutor-jack-smith-resigns-from-us-justice-department">Trump
prosecutor Jack Smith resigns from US Justice Department</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. Special Counsel Jack Smith, who led the federal cases against
Donald Trump on charges of trying to overturn his 2020 election defeat
and mishandling of classified documents, has resigned, as the Republican
president-elect prepares to return to the White House. </p>
<p>Smith resigned Friday from the Department of Justice, according to a
court filing on Saturday to U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, asking
her to lift a court order she issued blocking the release of his final
report.  </p>
<p>Notice of Smith’s resignation came in a footnote in the filing, which
said the Special Counsel had completed his work, submitted his final
confidential report on January 7, and “separated” from the Justice
Department on January 10.  </p>
<p>A former war crimes prosecutor, Smith brought two of the four
criminal cases Trump faced after leaving office, but saw them grind to a
halt after a Trump-appointed judge in Florida dismissed one and the U.S.
Supreme Court — with three justices appointed by Trump — found that
former presidents have sweeping immunity from prosecution for official
acts. Neither case went to trial. </p>
<p>After Trump defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in the
November 5 election, Smith dropped both cases, citing a longstanding
Justice Department rule against prosecuting sitting presidents. In
asking courts to dismiss the charges, Smith’s team defended the merits
of the cases they had brought, signaling that only Trump’s impending
return to the White House made them untenable.  </p>
<p>Smith’s departure is another marker of the collapse of the criminal
cases against Trump, which could end without any legal consequences for
the incoming president and sparked a backlash that helped fuel his
political comeback. </p>
<p>Smith’s resignation from the Justice Department was expected. Trump,
who has frequently called Smith “deranged” had said he would fire him
immediately upon taking office on January 20, and has suggested that he
may pursue retribution against Smith and others who investigated him
once he returns to office. </p>
<p>Trump in 2023 became the first sitting or former U.S. president to
face criminal prosecution, first in New York, where he was charged with
trying to cover up a hush money payment to a porn star during his 2016
presidential campaign. Smith’s charges followed, accusing Trump of
illegally retaining classified material after leaving office and of
trying to overturn his 2020 loss, a campaign that sparked the January 6,
2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol. Prosecutors in Georgia also charged
Trump over his efforts to overturn his election defeat in that
state. </p>
<p>Trump denied wrongdoing and assailed the prosecutions as politically
motivated attempts to damage his campaign. He raised millions in
campaign contributions from courthouse appearances and used the cases to
drive a powerful narrative that the political establishment was arrayed
against him and his supporters. </p>
<p>The Justice Department defended the cases, saying they were run by
career prosecutors who operated free of political influence.</p>
