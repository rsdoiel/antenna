## Global Science in Danger

date: 2025-03-26, from: SciELO in Perspective

<p>The current American government is curtailing science in several ways. Certain terms are censored in scientific reports and publications, communications and collaborations between scientists are limited or even proscribed, and funding is withdrawn.

The preeminence of American science seems truly being shattered. <span class="ellipsis">&#8230;</span> <span class="more-link-wrap"><a href="https://blog.scielo.org/en/2025/03/26/global-science-in-danger/" class="more-link"><span>Read More &#8594;</span></a></span></p>
