bliss on a Berner Oberland hike</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-25, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;A highlight of one of my European summers was a day I spent hiking in the Swiss Alps, on a hillside above the Berner Oberland&amp;#8217;s Lauterbrunnen Valley. I was with a wonderful group of traveling friends, all eager for a ramble in the high country.&lt;/p&gt;

Inter-episode rumblings at Kilauea</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-25, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Witnessing a volcanic eruption is, for many, a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Hawaii Volcanoes National Park welcomes well over a million visitors from around the world every year, and many of these visitors hope to see lava erupting in person. As enthralling as each eruptive episode is, experts at the USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory watch just as closely at what&amp;#8217;s happening between episodes.&lt;/p&gt;
