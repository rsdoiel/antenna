**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-02-04, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

Freaky warning. As easily as Musk can turn off government websites, he can turn off our sites. He could turn off all .com or .org sites. He'll probably do it just that way. Only one domain will work in the future, x.com. Goodby Google, Amazon, your drug store. Bubuy. Not sure if moving your DNS to Europe or Asia will make a difference. He's taking advantage of centralization, and will try to make it more centralized. Totally centralized. A journalist couldn't report this, because what proof do I have? It's because there's a pattern here. And it's pretty obvious the tools he's using.

<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/devs.feediverse.org">devs.feediverse.org</a> on Bluesky. An interesting experiment.

I was just setting up an account for another Feed Reader experiment on Bluesky and found that they have a Suggested User List that recommended the usual people who get in the way of telling the story that's really happening. I had a sinking feeling in my stomach, really felt it. We went through this with Twitter, it created influencers based on how loyal they were to the people who run Twitter, people who overlooked the obvious flaws in the system. We're living with their influence to this day, they have a million followers, completely manufactored by fealty to the owners. I swear to god these systems have to be publicly owned. The idea of turning to tech insiders to run them has run its course, don't you think. Over on Facebook this morning I saw an old friend with a cute meme that says people should paste swastika stickers on Teslas. That's nice. The reason you can get away with that is that you're attacking innocent people. More of the same. Of course <i>publicly owned</i> now means Musk Owned. See how things have changed, so quickly.

I would love to manage individual DNS domains using GitHub. I already have great tools for updating stuff over there. And everything on my current DNS system is manual and laborious.

## It's as if we got cancer

date: 2025-02-04, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/08/14/marlboroLights.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">What's happening in the US is like when a person who is a lifetime smoker gets cancer and stops smoking. You hope the cancer doesn't kill you, and swear to never smoke again if you're lucky enough to survive it.</p>
<p>We didn't appreciate how good we had it with our representative form of government. We could have stopped the erosion of our power at any time, when our reps would have more or less had to listen. Now, when we start trying to get their attention, which hasn't happened yet, it's going to be a competition between the rule of law, which is undermined, and the forces that would keep our would-be rulers in line if only our reps felt we were behind them, which they justifiably, do not. </p>
<p>The prognosis isn't good. But we should get our shit together asap because it's our only hope. </p>
<p>PS: Blaming other people is easy and powerless. Accepting your own responsibility and doing something to change it is powerful.</p>

## 2025-02-04 Degrowth

date: 2025-02-04, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-02-04-degrowth">2025-02-04 Degrowth</h1>

<p>I posted a picture from our living room on fedi and noticed that the book <a href="https://www.celinekeller.com/who-is-afraid-of-degrowth">Who is Afraid of Degrowth</a> by Céline Keller was visible on the coffee table.
And a bit later, <a class="account" href="https://mastodon.nz/@aimee" title="@aimee@mastodon.nz">@aimee</a> shared a link to the <a href="https://degrowth.net/">International Degrowth Network</a>, specifically to their values and principles:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Welcome to the heart of our movement: the values and principles of degrowth. This space explores the core ideas that drive us towards a sustainable and equitable future, from wellbeing and community to justice and care. As with any pluriversal movement, there are a wide variety of values and principles, not all of which must be fulfilled at once for something to qualify as &ldquo;degrowth&rdquo;. &ndash; <a href="https://explore.degrowth.net/degrowth/values-principles/">Values &amp; Principles: Explore degrowth</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I really like the two lists. Might be useful as a checklist before doing things. There&rsquo;s more on the site, of course.</p>

<p>Values of Degrowth:</p>

<ul>
<li>Autonomy &amp; Democracy</li>
<li>Care</li>
<li>Justice</li>
<li>Sustainability &amp; Sufficiency</li>
<li>Well-being</li>
<li>Sovereignty</li>
<li>Community</li>
</ul>

<p>Principles of degrowth:</p>

<ul>
<li>Resource sovereignty: Be a steward of nature</li>
<li>Embracing the Pluriverse: Celebrate a world of many worlds</li>
<li>Circularity: Waste not, want not</li>
<li>Socially useful production: What is not needed should not be made</li>
<li>Decolonising Futures: Unlearn, relearn, and heal</li>
<li>Small, not-for-profit cooperatives: People and planet, not profit</li>
<li>Proximity &amp; Cosmolocalism: Produce local, design global</li>
<li>Creative Visions: Art as a catalyst for change</li>
<li>Convivial tools: Technology as a tool, not a master</li>
<li>Healing Histories: Making amends for past wrongs</li>
<li>Postwork: Work less, play more</li>
<li>Active Change: Stand up, speak out</li>
<li>Value sovereignty: What matters most</li>
<li>Health: Well-being for All</li>
<li>Commons: Decide together</li>
<li>Reconnecting with Spirit: Rediscovering our bonds with the sacred</li>
<li>Sharing: Sufficiency for all, overabundance for none</li>
<li>Feminist Futures: Centering equality</li>
<li>Relational goods: Less stuff, more relationships</li>
<li>Transformative Learning: Empowering collective action</li>
<li>Joie de vivre: If I can&rsquo;t dance, I don&rsquo;t want to be part of your economy</li>
</ul>

## Deepfakes and the 2024 US Election

date: 2025-02-04, updated: 2025-02-02, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Interesting <a href="https://knightcolumbia.org/blog/we-looked-at-78-election-deepfakes-political-misinformation-is-not-an-ai-problem">analysis</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We analyzed every instance of AI use in elections collected by the WIRED AI Elections Project (<a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~sayashk/political-misinformation/WIRED-data.html">source</a> for our analysis), which tracked known uses of AI for creating political content during elections taking place in 2024 worldwide. In each case, we identified what AI was used for and estimated the cost of creating similar content without AI.</p>
<p>We find that (1) half of AI use isn&#8217;t deceptive, (2) deceptive content produced using AI is nevertheless cheap to replicate <em>without</em> AI, and (3) focusing on the demand for misinformation rather than the supply is a much more effective way to diagnose problems and identify interventions...</p></blockquote>

Women are better in general at seeing the big picture and managing accordingly. A man is more likely to hone in on one aspect of the problem and if they're good, do something brilliant, but misses out on pretty much everything else. I, as a man, have had to severely discipline myself to get anything done, because that's how I'm built. Given a chance I will always put my head down and focus on one thing until its done, then the next and the next and so on.

Imho it would be smart for Musk to stop shutting things down and just do his work, whatever it is. By creating constant shitstorms he's making it impossible for anyone to defend him, and you can be sure some would be if what he was doing wasn't so blatantly outrageous. We never voted for that mofo. And every American alive, whatever their preference, thinks their own vote should count. That's going to be a massive hurdle for them to get over.

## Journalists and Civil Society Members Using WhatsApp Targeted by Paragon Spyware

<p>It is not clear who was behind the attack. Like other spyware makers, Paragon&#8217;s hacking software is used by government clients and WhatsApp said it had not been able to identify the clients who ordered the alleged attacks...</p></blockquote>

A bit of advice for Dems in Congress. Go home and have town halls, and listen. And stop listening to the consultants and each other. Find out what the people want, and bring that back to DC. And let the press attend the town halls so they can report. Make our own <a href="https://tea25.party/">Tea Party</a>.

## 1.5 Billion Broadband Connections

date: 2025-02-03, from: Om Malik blog

When I started writing about broadband, there were fewer than a few thousand T1 lines, but the magic of fast, always-on internet was pretty obvious even back then. In almost three decades, broadband has become ubiquitous, both at home and at work. We now almost always assume there should be a fast connection on our &#8230;

I'm 99.9% sure, as crazy as it sounds, when Musk is finished with his software project, you will have to use X for everything related to the government. To pay taxes, to receive health care, to renew your passport. And if you try to arrest him, he'll stop paying interest on the US debt, and that will be the end of the dollar as the reserve currency of the world. He won't just control the US government, he will control the world economy.

## On government efficiency

date: 2025-02-02, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p><tt>It’s a secret to everyone! This post is for RSS subscribers only.
<a href="https://daverupert.com/rss-club/">Read more about RSS Club</a>.
</tt></p>
<p>I used to believe that the goal of the government should be efficiency. If the government was more efficient (waves hands broadly in the air), you could get rid of waste (again, waiving hands) and you’d need less taxes, and that would trickle down (more hands) as more money in people’s pockets, and you’d need less welfare (again, hands), less red tape (hands), and less bureaucracy (hands, hands, hands), et cetera.</p>
<p>I’ve changed my thinking on the subject. I now think the goal of the government should be to absorb inefficiencies.</p>
<p>As efficient as the fabled invisible hand of the market might be at lowering the costs of goods and services <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> and creating jobs<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup> … there are often non-economic inefficiencies that arise from rapidly scaling to produce cheaper goods in the infinite money machine. Rather than ignore those inefficiencies, I think the government should understand the ways the system breaks and invest in longer term ideas than making the stock market go up during the next quarter.</p>
<p>Here’s a short list of market inefficiencies where I think a government helps:</p>
<p><strong>Social Security and Medicare.</strong> Unpopular opinion, but I sort of do see social security as a Ponzi scheme; younger people at the bottom fund older people at the top who “got in first”. But you know what’s a bigger problem? Elderly adults retiring with no retirement plan. In our “Buy the latest iPhone” society, <a href="https://usafacts.org/data-projects/retirement-savings">people are statistically bad at planning for their own future</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The Environment.</strong> The free market doesn’t nudge companies towards making responsible environmental decisions. Even though <a href="https://rmi.org/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2024/07/RMI-Cleantech-Revolution-pdf-1.pdf">electrification is 3× more efficient than carbon</a>, the invisible hand is taking its sweet time moving over to it. Probably because the invisible hand gave too much money to the oil companies. We spend billions in aid for “once in a lifetime” acts of God that happen every year now. The “more efficient” act would be to kill carbon. We need a government to protect the non-monetizable resources that give us life like oceans, lakes, rivers, underground reservoirs, the air we breathe, and our forests.</p>
<p><strong>Healthcare.</strong> I hate the American healthcare system. We pay too much for too little. We don’t pay for healthcare, we pay for insurance company lawyers to haggle about medical codes. Doctors hate it. Patients hate it. Insurance companies reek of greed and corruption. And each of us “doing our own research” isn’t a great because you end up with people turning themselves blue from colloidal silver. We probably need real doctors. And because most folks don’t need a doctor all the time, we probably need health insurance. The current system is a handful of state-by-state monopolies. But we know (according to Metcalfe’s law) that the value of a network is proportional to the number of connected users on the system. It would seem the best way to dodge insurance marketplace inefficiencies like rising costs and low quality care would be to have the biggest network possible (say, 330 million people?) to create the best safety net. The market is not getting us the best price.</p>
<p><strong>Defense.</strong> Every American owning their own personal tank and missile system would be an inefficient stupid way to defend our country. It’s probably best to centralize the cost of Defense and hire trained armed service members for that purpose. I’m not advocating for more military –I’d personally prefer less– but security is a core need and it manifests at a nation-state level.</p>
<p><strong>Transportation.</strong> I don’t think individuals should plan and build their own highways. I’d like a government to do that. I also think every American owning their own car that sits parked 95% of the time is a waste of money and space, even if it does make the GDP chart go up. You need a big extra room to store cars at home and a downtown filled with concrete ramps to store cars at work. Or an enormous parking lot to store cars at the store. Is this not a form of waste? There’s no way a train makes money and is a profitable business… but more trains equals less traffic. We know adding new <a href="https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2020/1/27/how-much-does-a-mile-of-road-actually-cost">ten million dollar a mile</a> lanes to an already impossibly wide interstate creates more traffic, more road rage, and more traffic deaths. That is folly and an inefficiency governments can step in and solve.</p>
<p><strong>Education.</strong> Education is a big expense. But you know what’s more expensive? Everyone being stupid. That’s a joke… partially. What is more expensive is everyone sourcing and paying for private schools; most parents would not do it. You’d end up with a future labor force with a lot less education. I think my biggest takeaway from school closures during COVID was how glad I am the public education system exists. Parents can work jobs, do commerce, and it allows kids to learn and play with other kids from a cross-section of incomes, ethnic groups, and special needs. The 1:20+ teacher-student ratio couldn’t be more efficient in regards to childcare. If anything we need more teachers and classrooms to keep that ratio as low as possible so education quality goes up. Oh, and school breakfasts and lunches are super efficient too. You can feed kids for like $1/kid, there’s no way I can hit those numbers at home. I can’t believe this is contentious. Let kids eat.</p>
<p><strong>Scientific Research.</strong> Space is expensive to get to, only billionaires can afford it. Isn’t it nice that the government sometimes foots the bill for scientists to also go? Beyond space, efforts like curing cancer, computer research, or finding a new species of spider… these are not an ultra-efficient use of funds but those discoveries power innovation. The market doesn’t fund Science unless it makes money in an A/B test. We’d end up with more patent-pending boner pills instead of understanding of our universe. Real science is a bunch of inefficient question and answer seeking that changes the course of human history.</p>
<p><strong>Human Rights.</strong> One way to drive down costs under Capitalism is to hire labor at the cheapest rate possible. Historically, our great nation has relied on slaves (yikes!) and children (yikes!) for cheap sources of labor. You’d have to work long hours for low pay and then a machine would cut off your arm and your employer would say “Well, you can’t work here anymore” and kick you out. Isn’t it great to have a government to correct this moral inefficiency? It didn’t happen overnight, of course. Countless churches and patriotic do-gooders were fine with justifying and upholding the old system. Even fought a war about it.</p>
<hr />
<p>I could keep going, but there’s a billion and one jobs a government can do to improve the life and well-being of its citizens. Old habits die hard, I guess, because I’m still thinking about efficiency… but from the opposite angle. A government is perhaps best-situated to absorb inefficiencies at scale. Will there be inefficiency and waste and kingdom-building within a super-system like a government? For sure. Systems should always seek to improve. To begin fixing those problems you need data and transparency.</p>
<p>The more you understand Capitalism, the more you understand it’s a game. It’s a game with an enormous exploit. I’m talking Blanka in the corner levels of bullshit. The government <em>should</em> exist to fix those systems and curb those bad actors. But the system continues to reward them and heap tax break after tax break as a reward to their fellow co-conspirators in exchange for campaign contributions and lavish trips. Talk about inefficiency. Dumping piles of money into the hands of people who already have money. Sheesh.</p>

Saw a commercial on CNN this evening from <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/your-economic-partner">Ontario</a> in response to the tariffs, respectful, talking direct to Americans about the bonds with the people of Canada. Why can’t the Dems do this, say how important the independence of the FBI is, to start. We’d love to pay for that. Get in the game Dems.
