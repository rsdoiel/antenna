<p>Politico has become a testing ground for how AI clauses in union
contracts could shape adoption in newsrooms across the U.S. The PEN

<p>In the first federal election since news was banned on Meta
platforms, Canadians lost out, a new report finds. The 2025 federal
election was likely the “most poorly covered election in modern Canadian
history” due to the erosion of local news and Facebook’s news ban,
according to the Ottawa-based nonpartisan think tank Public Policy
Forum…</p>

<p>Asmara Carbado, a former investigative attorney for UCLA’s
Discrimination Prevention Office, testified about the office’s
preliminary assessment into Klein’s email. She said that while she
believed Klein’s email response was racially insensitive and reflected
“poor judgment,” it did not ultimately affect the sender of the email’s
ability to learn.</p>
