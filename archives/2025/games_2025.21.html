2 packaging is probably going to confuse people, retail workers say</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-27, updated: 2025-05-27, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>As a console, the Switch 2 is definitely one of Nintendo’s more

<p>Black Ops 6 season 4 is about Grief. No, not the all too real human
emotion (this is still Call of Duty after all); the new game mode! In

<p>You may have heard of Timberborn, the beaver-themed city builder that

over 1 million copies already, and has a fan base dedicated to the
