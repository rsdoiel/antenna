<p>Screenwriting is a visual medium. We know that. We’re taught that. We preach that. But how often do most screenwriters take a step back and ask themselves, <em>“Am I actually writing visually?”</em>&nbsp;<br><br>To make an immediate impact on whoever is reading and considering your work, your screenplays need to make the script reader feel as if they are watching a movie unfold as they read. This is one of the most underrated aspects of screenwriting — writing a visually cinematic script where these three elements pop off of the page:</p>

## How Much Money Can You Make Selling a Screenplay?

</div> 
<p>A <span style="font-weight: bold;">spec screenplay</span> (a.k.a. a <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/what-is-a-spec-script">spec script</a>) is an original screenplay that a <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/how-to-be-a-screenwriter-in-5-basic-steps">screenwriter</a> conceives and writes themselves (or with a writing partner) with a view to selling it. With the help of a <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/the-differences-between-an-agent-and-a-manager">manager or agent</a>, the spec script is given to several production companies or directly to a studio. In an ideal scenario, the script is well-received and an interested party <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/screenplay-options-vs.-screenplay-sales">purchases it</a>. In an even more ideal scenario, several parties want to purchase it, leading to a bidding war and <span style="font-weight: bold;">big spec sale</span>.<br><br>The heyday of the Big Spec Sale is undoubtedly the 90s in which news of such sales were common in the industry trades and often created much buzz. This trend continued into the 00s, in which some of the biggest spec sales ever occurred. Not only did news of these sales help boost the profile of the writers, they created excitement about the project and acted as early promotion for the film. These sales also acted as inspiration for aspiring and beginner screenwriters. Maybe one day <span style="font-style: italic;">they’d</span> write a script that sold for a lot of money…<br><br>But how much exactly?<br><br>I, myself, broke into the industry with a <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/5-things-i-did-to-become-a-professional-screenwriter">big spec sale</a>, so this is something I’ve experienced firsthand. I’ve also done my research over the years and have a pretty good grasp on the spec script market. Below is my breakdown of how much spec screenplays have sold for in the past, as well as what they can sell for today.</p>

<p>Some film genres never go out of style. Thrillers and action/adventure movies, for example, remain perennial favorites, consistently drawing audiences in theaters and on streaming platforms. Other genres, however, tend to fade in and out of popularity.</p>

<p>Writer’s block isn’t real. It’s not something that should be feared by writers, whether you’re writing novels or screenplays. It is nothing more than an over-generalized term for the multiple hurdles <span style="font-weight: bold;">all</span> writers must face, overcome, and adapt to in their writing process.&nbsp;<br><br>It’s true. Any writer that has felt that lingering weight on their shoulders perceived as the mystical condition <em>writer’s block</em> should take solace knowing that they don’t have to be a victim to it any longer.&nbsp;<br><br>To truly conquer a problem, it’s best to explore and understand every dynamic and angle of it. For writers battling with supposed writer’s block, and for those who want to avoid it, you must first be able to identify what it really is, what triggers it, and how you can put a stop to it before it takes hold.&nbsp;<br><br>With that in mind, here we present seven ways to identify and prevent what most people initially attribute to being the dreaded <span style="font-weight: bold;">writer’s block</span>.</p>
