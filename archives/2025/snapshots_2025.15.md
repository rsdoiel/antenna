## Update to my tech writing gear and tools

date: 2025-04-14, from: Blog by Fabrizio Ferri-Benedetti

<p>I‚Äôve recently upgraded some of the hardware I use for work and leisure, so it‚Äôs a good time to refresh my lists of <a href="https://passo.uno/technical-writing-equipment/">tech writing gear</a>. At the same time, after working as a documentation engineer, I also picked up new <a href="https://passo.uno/favorite-tech-writing-tools/">favorite tools</a>, especially AI-powered ones. Let me tell you of some of the recent additions to my personal inventory and why I think they‚Äôre making me more productive (and less grumpy).</p>

## Using LLMs as the first line of support in Open Source

date: 2025-04-14, updated: 2025-04-14, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://noumenal.es/posts/llms-for-user-support/WZb/">Using LLMs as the first line of support in Open Source</a></strong></p>
From reading the title I was nervous that this might involve automating the initial response to a user support query in an issue tracker with an LLM, but Carlton Gibson has better taste than that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>open contribution</strong> model engendered by GitHub ‚Äî where anonymous (to the project) users can create issues, and comments, which are almost always extractive support requests ‚Äî results in an effective <strong>denial-of-service attack against maintainers</strong>. [...]</p>
<p>For anonymous users, who really just want help almost all the time, the pattern I‚Äôm settling on is to facilitate them getting their answer from their LLM of choice. [...] we can generate a file that we offer users to download, then we tell the user to pass this to (say) Claude with a simple prompt for their question.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This resonates with the concept proposed by <a href="https://llmstxt.org/">llms.txt</a> - making LLM-friendly context files available for different projects.</p>
<p>My <a href="https://github.com/simonw/docs-for-llms">simonw/docs-for-llms</a> contains my own early experiment with this: I'm running a build script to create LLM-friendly concatenated documentation for several of my projects, and my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-docs">llm-docs</a> plugin (<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/7/long-context-llm/#asking-questions-of-llm-s-documentation">described here</a>) can then be used to ask questions of that documentation.</p>
<p>It's possible to pre-populate the Claude UI with a prompt by linking to <code>https://claude.ai/new?q={PLACE_HOLDER}</code>, but it looks like there's quite a short length limit on how much text can be passed that way. It would be neat if you could pass a URL to a larger document instead.</p>
<p>ChatGPT also supports <code>https://chatgpt.com/?q=your-prompt-here</code> (again with a short length limit) and directly executes the prompt rather than waiting for you to edit it first(!)

<p data-pm-slice="0 0 []">In the early 1960s a neat little machine came out of MIT. Well, kind of MIT. The machine was called LINC. It was small, flexible, and designed to live in laboratories. Some have called it the first personal computer. But, is that true? Does it have some secret that will unseat my beloved LGP-30? And how does DEC fit into the picture?</p>

## sanitizer-fun

date: 2025-04-13, from: Keith P's blog

<h2>Fun with -fsanitize=undefined and Picolibc</h2>

<p>Both GCC and Clang support the -fsanitize=undefined flag which
instruments the generated code to detect places where the program
wanders into parts of the C language specification which are either
undefined or implementation defined. Many of these are also common
programming errors. It would be great if there were sanitizers for
other easily detected bugs, but for now, at least the undefined
sanitizer does catch several useful problems.</p>

<h2>Supporting the sanitizer</h2>

<p>The sanitizer can be built to either trap on any error or call
handlers. In both modes, the same problems are identified, but when
trap mode is enabled, the compiler inserts a trap instruction and
doesn't expect the program to continue running. When handlers are in
use, each identified issue is tagged with a bunch of useful data and
then a specific sanitizer handling function is called.</p>

<p>The specific functions are not all that well documented, nor are the
parameters they receive. Maybe this is because both compilers provide
an implementation of all of the functions they use and don't really
expect external implementations to exist? However, to make these useful in an
embedded environment, picolibc needs to provide a complete set of
handlers that support all versions both gcc and clang as the
compiler-provided versions depend upon specific C (and C++) libraries.</p>

<p>Of course, programs can be built in trap-on-error mode, but that makes
it much more difficult to figure out what went wrong.</p>

<h2>Fixing Sanitizer Issues</h2>

<p>Once the sanitizer handlers were implemented, picolibc could be
built with them enabled and all of the picolibc tests run to uncover
issues within the library.</p>

<p>As with the static analyzer adventure from last year, the vast bulk of
sanitizer complaints came from invoking undefined or
implementation-defined behavior in harmless ways:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Computing pointers past &amp;array[size+1]. I found no cases where the
resulting pointers were actually used, but the mere computation is
still undefined behavior. These were fixed by adjusting the code to
avoid computing pointers like this. The result was clearer code,
which is good.</p></li>
<li><p>Signed arithmetic overflow in PRNG code. There are several linear
congruential PRNGs in the library which used signed integer
arithmetic. The rand48 generator carefully used unsigned short
values. Of course, in C, the arithmetic performed on them is done
with signed ints if int is wider than short. C specifies signed
overflow as undefined, but both gcc and clang generate the expected
code anyways. The fixes here were simple; just switch the
computations to unsigned arithmetic, adjusting types and inserting
casts as required.</p></li>
<li><p>Passing pointers to the middle of a data structure. For example,
free takes a pointer to the start of an allocation. The management
structure appears just before that in memory; computing the address
of which appears to be undefined behavior to the compiler. The only
fix I could do here was to disable the sanitizer in functions doing
these computations -- the sanitizer was mis-detecting correct code
and it doesn't provide a way to skip checks on a per-operator
basis.</p></li>
<li><p>Null pointer plus or minus zero. C says that any arithmetic with
the NULL pointer is undefined, even when the value being added or
subtracted is zero. The fix here was to create a macro, enabled
only when the sanitizer is enabled, which checks for this case and
skips the arithmetic.</p></li>
<li><p>Discarded computations which overflow. A couple of places computed
a value, then checked if that would have overflowed and discard the
result. Even though the program doesn't depend upon the
computation, its mere presence is undefined behavior. These were
fixed by moving the computation into an <code>else</code> clause in the
overflow check. This inserts an extra branch instruction, which is
annoying.</p></li>
<li><p>Signed integer overflow in math code. There's a common pattern
in various functions that want to compare against 1.0. Instead of
using the floating point equality operator, they do the computation
using the two 32-bit halves with ((hi - 0x3ff00000) | lo)
== 0. It's efficient, but because most of these functions store the
'hi' piece in a signed integer (to make checking the sign bit
fast), the result is undefined when hi is a large negative
value. These were fixed by inserting casts to unsigned types as the
results were always tested for equality.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Signed integer shifts</h3>

<p>This is one area where the C language spec is just wrong.</p>

<p>For left shift, before C99, it worked on signed integers as a bit-wise
operator, equivalent to the operator on unsigned integers. After that,
left shift of negative integers became undefined. Fortunately, it's
straightforward (if tedious) to work around this issue by just casting
the operand to unsigned, performing the shift and casting it back to
the original type. Picolibc now has an internal macro, <code>lsl</code>, which
does this:</p>

<pre><code>    #define lsl(__x,__s) ((sizeof(__x) == sizeof(char)) ?                   \
                          (__typeof(__x)) ((unsigned char) (__x) &lt;&lt; (__s)) :  \
                          (sizeof(__x) == sizeof(short)) ?                  \
                          (__typeof(__x)) ((unsigned short) (__x) &lt;&lt; (__s)) : \
                          (sizeof(__x) == sizeof(int)) ?                    \
                          (__typeof(__x)) ((unsigned int) (__x) &lt;&lt; (__s)) :   \
                          (sizeof(__x) == sizeof(long)) ?                   \
                          (__typeof(__x)) ((unsigned long) (__x) &lt;&lt; (__s)) :  \
                          (sizeof(__x) == sizeof(long long)) ?              \
                          (__typeof(__x)) ((unsigned long long) (__x) &lt;&lt; (__s)) : \
                          __undefined_shift_size(__x, __s))
</code></pre>

<p>Right shift is significantly more complicated to implement. What we
want is an arithmetic shift with the sign bit being replicated as the
value is shifted rightwards. C defines no such operator. Instead,
right shift of negative integers is implementation
defined. Fortunately, both gcc and clang define the <code>&gt;&gt;</code> operator on
signed integers as arithmetic shift. Also fortunately, C hasn't made
this undefined, so the program itself doesn't end up undefined.</p>

<p>The trouble with arithmetic right shift is that it is <em>not</em> equivalent
to right shift of unsigned values. Here's what I came up with using
standard C operators:</p>

<pre><code>    int
    __asr_int(int x, int s) {
        return (int) ((unsigned int) x &gt;&gt; s) |
            -(((unsigned int) x &amp; ((unsigned int) 1 &lt;&lt; (8 * sizeof(int) - 1))) &gt;&gt; s);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The sign bit is replicated separately and then or'd into the
result. This function is replicated for each of the five standard
integer types and then the set of them wrapped in another
sizeof-selecting macro:</p>

<pre><code>    #define asr(__x,__s) ((sizeof(__x) == sizeof(char)) ?           \
                          (__typeof(__x))__asr_char(__x, __s) :       \
                          (sizeof(__x) == sizeof(short)) ?          \
                          (__typeof(__x))__asr_short(__x, __s) :      \
                          (sizeof(__x) == sizeof(int)) ?            \
                          (__typeof(__x))__asr_int(__x, __s) :        \
                          (sizeof(__x) == sizeof(long)) ?           \
                          (__typeof(__x))__asr_long(__x, __s) :       \
                          (sizeof(__x) == sizeof(long long)) ?      \
                          (__typeof(__x))__asr_long_long(__x, __s):   \
                          __undefined_shift_size(__x, __s))
</code></pre>

<p>The lsl and asr macros use sizeof instead of the type-generic
mechanism to remain compatible with compilers that lack type-generic
support.</p>

<p>Once these macros were written, they needed to be applied where
required. To preserve the benefits of detecting programming errors,
they were only applied where required, not blindly across the whole
codebase.</p>

<p>There are a couple of common patterns in the math code using shift
operators. One is when computing the exponent value for subnormal
numbers.</p>

<pre><code>for (ix = -1022, i = hx &lt;&lt; 11; i &gt; 0; i &lt;&lt;= 1)
    ix -= 1;
</code></pre>

<p>This code computes the exponent by shifting the significand left by 11
bits (the width of the exponent field) and then incrementally shifting
it one bit at a time until the sign flips, which indicates that the
most-significant bit is set. Use of the pre-C99 definition of the left
shift operator is intentional here; so both shifts are replaced with
our lsl operator.</p>

<p>In the implementation of pow, the final exponent is computed as the
sum of the two exponents, both of which are in the allowed range. The
resulting sum is then tested to see if it is zero or negative to see
if the final value is sub-normal:</p>

<pre><code>hx += n &lt;&lt; 20;
if (hx &gt;&gt; 20 &lt;= 0)
    /* do sub-normal things */
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, the exponent adjustment, <code>n</code>, is a signed value and so
that shift is replaced with the <code>lsl</code> macro. The test value needs to
compute the correct the sign bit, so we replace this with the <code>asr</code>
macro.</p>

<p>Because the right shift operation is not undefined, we only use our
fancy macro above when the undefined behavior sanitizer is enabled. On
the other hand, the lsl macro should have zero cost and covers
undefined behavior, so it is always used.</p>

<h2>Actual Bugs Found!</h2>

<p>The goal of this little adventure was both to make using the undefined
behavior sanitizer with picolibc possible as well as to use the
sanitizer to identify bugs in the library code. I fully expected that
most of the effort would be spent masking harmless undefined behavior
instances, but was hopeful that the effort would also uncover real
bugs in the code. I was not disappointed. Through this work, I found
(and fixed) eight bugs in the code:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>setlocale/newlocale didn't check for NULL locale names</p></li>
<li><p>qsort was using uintptr_t to swap data around. On MSP430 in
'large' mode, that's a 20-bit type inside a 32-bit representation.</p></li>
<li><p>random() was returning values in <code>int</code> range rather than <code>long</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>m68k assembly for memcpy was broken for sizes > 64kB.</p></li>
<li><p>freopen returned NULL, even on success</p></li>
<li><p>The optimized version of memrchr was <em>always</em> performing unaligned
accesses.</p></li>
<li><p>String to float conversion had a table missing four values. This
caused an array access overflow which resulted in imprecise values
in some cases.</p></li>
<li><p>vfwscanf mis-parsed floating point values by assuming that
<code>wchar_t</code> was unsigned.</p></li>
</ol>


<h2>Sanitizer Wishes</h2>

<p>While it's great to have a way to detect places in your C code which
evoke undefined and implementation defined behaviors, it seems like
this tooling could easily be extended to detect other common
programming mistakes, even where the code is well defined according to
the language spec. An obvious example is in unsigned arithmetic. How
many bugs come from this seemingly innocuous line of code?</p>

<pre><code>    p = malloc(sizeof(*p) * c);
</code></pre>

<p>Because sizeof returns an unsigned value, the resulting computation
never results in undefined behavior, even when the multiplication
wraps around, so even with the undefined behavior sanitizer enabled,
this bug will not be caught. Clang seems to have an unsigned integer
overflow sanitizer which should do this, but I couldn't find anything
like this in gcc.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The undefined behavior sanitizers present in clang and gcc both
provide useful diagnostics which uncover some common programming
errors. In most cases, replacing undefined behavior with defined
behavior is straightforward, although the lack of an arithmetic right
shift operator in standard C is irksome. I recommend anyone using C to
give it a try.</p>

## Stevens: a hackable AI assistant using a single SQLite table and a handful of cron jobs

date: 2025-04-13, updated: 2025-04-13, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

Geoffrey Litt reports on Stevens, a shared digital assistant he put together for his family using SQLite and scheduled tasks running on Val Town.</p>
<p>The design is refreshingly simple considering how much it can do. Everything works around a single <code>memories</code> table. A memory has text, tags, creation metadata and an optional <code>date</code> for things like calendar entries and weather reports.</p>
<p>Everything else is handled by scheduled jobs to popular weather information and events from Google Calendar, a Telegram integration offering a chat UI and a neat system where USPS postal email delivery notifications are run through Val's own email handling mechanism to trigger a Claude prompt to add those as memories too. </p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://www.val.town/x/geoffreylitt/stevensDemo">the full code on Val Town</a>, including <a href="https://www.val.town/x/geoffreylitt/stevensDemo/code/dailyBriefing/sendDailyBrief.ts">the daily briefing prompt</a> that incorporates most of the personality of the bot.
