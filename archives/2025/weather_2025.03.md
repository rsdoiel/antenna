Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0645 AM CST Sun Jan 26 2025

Valid 261300Z - 271200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not forecast across the contiguous United
States through tonight.

...Synopsis...
Water-vapor imagery this morning shows a mid/upper-level low over
CA.  A split-flow pattern is located downstream over the central
U.S. with southwesterly flow over the Desert Southwest, and
northwesterly flow over the Upper Midwest in association with
large-scale troughing centered over Hudson Bay.  Cold mid-level
temperatures associated with the CA upper low will yield
intermittent pockets of weak buoyancy from the central valley into
southern coastal CA.  As a result, weak convection may yield a few
sporadic lightning flashes mainly today into this evening.  Farther
east, persistent low-level warm/moist advection, via the warm
conveyor atop a slowly modifying CP airmass along the northwest Gulf
Coast, will favor showers and eventually scattered thunderstorm
development over east TX into the lower MS Valley.  Despite strong
mid to high-level westerly flow, limited storm organization is
forecast due primarily to weak instability.  A vigorous updraft or
two cannot be ruled out over east TX on the eastern periphery of
steeper 700-500 mb lapse rates (reference 12 UTC Fort Worth, TX
raob; 8.7 deg C/km).  Yet, gradual moistening of the mid troposphere
via convection will act to hinder a localized Marginal hail risk.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0359 AM CST Sun Jan 26 2025

Valid 291200Z - 031200Z

...DISCUSSION...
...Wednesday/Day 4 to Thursday/Day 5...
A mid-level low is forecast to move eastward across the Desert
Southwest from Wednesday/Day 4 into Thursday/Day 5. Low-level
moisture advection will take place ahead of the system across the
southern Plains on Wednesday into Wednesday night, with surface
dewpoints increasing into the 60s F across parts of the southern
Plains. Scattered to numerous thunderstorms appear likely to develop
across the western part of the moist sector Wednesday night across
much of central and northern Texas, as large-scale ascent increases
ahead of the approaching system. This, combined with increasing
instability, and strong deep-layer shear along the western edge of
the moist sector should result in a severe threat late Wednesday
night. A cluster of strong and potentially severe storms may develop
in west-central Texas, with the severe threat persisting into
Thursday, as an MCS moves eastward across the southern Plains.
Supercells with isolated large hail and wind damage will be
possible. There is some concern that moisture return could be slower
than forecast. However, the strength of the system could help to
overcome instability concerns, and it appears a severe threat will
be possible as the mid-level jet ejects northeastward into the
southern Plains from Wednesday night into Thursday.

...Friday/Day 6 and Sunday/Day 8...
The mid-level trough is forecast to move across the southern Plains
on Friday/Day 6, as a cold front advances eastward into the lower
Mississippi Valley. On Saturday/Day 7 and Sunday/Day 8, this front
is forecast to move across the eastern U.S. Although thunderstorms
will be possible along and ahead of the front, instability is
forecast to be very weak suggesting a severe threat will be
unlikely.

## SPC Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0120 AM CST Sun Jan 26 2025

Valid 271200Z - 281200Z

...Synopsis...
Portions of eastern Arizona and far west/southwestern New Mexico
will continue to see elevated fire weather concerns through Monday
afternoon. The upper low currently deepening off the central CA
coast is forecast to reach peak intensity over the next 24 hours
over southern CA before gradually shifting east into the lower CO
River Valley by late Monday. This eastward shift will be influenced
by the ejection of a mid-level jet max on the southeastern fringe of
the upper low into northwest Mexico, which will promote surface
pressure falls across AZ/NM under the left-exit region. In response,
southerly low-level winds are forecast to increase to around 15 mph,
which when coupled with an antecedent dry air mass (forecast RH
minimums between 10-20%), should promote elevated fire weather
conditions. Surface winds are expected to be strongest in proximity
to the surface trough, which most solutions agree will likely reside
along, if not just east of, the AZ/NM border. Localized critical
conditions appear possible within the higher terrain of the Gila
region in southwest NM, but the potential for widespread/sustained
critical conditions appears limited. Fuels across this area continue
to cure after several days of anomalously low dewpoints with ERCs
approaching the 90th percentile in some areas, and should support
the fire weather concern.

Mesoscale Discussion 0048
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0846 AM CST Tue Jan 21 2025

Areas affected...Southeast Louisiana...southern Mississippi and far
southern Alabama

Concerning...Heavy snow 

Valid 211446Z - 211845Z

SUMMARY...Moderate to heavy snow to continue this morning and
through the afternoon. Some blowing and drifting is also expected.

DISCUSSION...An expansive region of light to occasionally moderate
snow has spread across much of the central Gulf coast this morning.
Expect precipitation rates to increase through the late morning and
afternoon with widespread moderate to occasionally heavy snowfall
rates expected. In addition, some stronger winds, particularly
closer to the coast will lead to some blowing and drifting. Areas
with northward exposure (ex. southern short of Lake Pontchartrain)
may see some localized blizzard conditions through the day. 

Some mixed precipitation is being observed from southern Terrebonne
Parish to southern St. Bernard Parish where a warm nose (seen just
below 700mb on the LIX 12Z RAOB) is slightly above freezing. 60
knots of southwesterly flow in this warm nose will attempt to
maintain its presence across the region while temperatures aloft
continue to cool. Expect the cold air to eventually win out with
snow likely across all of southern Louisiana by later this
afternoon.

Mesoscale Discussion 0047
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0447 AM CST Tue Jan 21 2025

Areas affected...Far southeast Texas into south-central Louisiana

Concerning...Heavy snow 

Valid 211047Z - 211515Z

SUMMARY...Moderate snowfall with embedded heavier bands will become
more likely over the next several hours in southern Louisiana.

DISCUSSION...The broad upper-level trough across the central/eastern
U.S. is in the process of intensifying this morning. As this occurs,
the upper-level jet along eastern flank of the trough will also
intensify. Increasing mid/upper-level ascent as well as at least
weak lower-level frontogenesis (850-700 mb or so) will promote
favorable conditions for dendritic growth. Moderate snowfall has
already been observed at several stations in southwestern Louisiana
over the last hour. With the most favorable synoptic conditions
expected to occur around mid/late morning, moderate snowfall should
become increasingly prevalent across southern Louisiana in
particular. Some banded structures will be possible which could
produce heavier snowfall rates (0.5-1 in/hr) at least locally.

Mesoscale Discussion 0038
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1200 PM CST Sun Jan 19 2025

Areas affected...Portions of Mid-Atlantic States

Concerning...Heavy snow 

Valid 191800Z - 192230Z

SUMMARY...Snowfall will continue to increase from southwest to
northeast across portions of West Virginia, Maryland, and
Pennsylvania this afternoon with rates exceeding 1" per hour.

DISCUSSION...An upper-level trough and associated speed max rotating
around a low near Hudson Bay are moving toward the East Coast this
afternoon.  In response at the surface, a low over North Carolina is
forecast to deepen and shift northeastward through the afternoon. 
To the north to northwest of the surface low, low-level
frontogenesis will promote upward vertical motion and precipitation
banding.  Given these favorable factors and cold vertical profiles,
snowfall rates of >=1" per hour are likely this afternoon with
higher rates possible in banded structures.

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms are not forecast on Tuesday or Tuesday night.

...Synopsis...
Thunderstorm potential largely appears negligible across the CONUS
through Tuesday night. An exception could be along the Gulf Coast.
Shallow and highly elevated convection, predominately producing
sleet at the surface, should be ongoing at 12Z Tuesday along the
northwest Gulf Coast. Mid-level lapse rates will be progressively
weaker with eastern extent downstream, suggesting that lightning
production will likely be nonexistent along the north-central to
eastern Gulf Coast. Primary deep convective potential should be
confined from the west-central to southeast Gulf through the period.

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms are not forecast on Monday or Monday night.

...Synopsis...
Thunderstorm potential is negligible across the CONUS on Monday
through Monday night. One exception could be from the Middle TX to
southwest LA Gulf Coast where weak elevated convection should
develop early morning Tuesday. This will occur with strengthening
warm-moist advection centered on 750-700 mb, downstream of a
positive-tilt mid/upper-level longwave trough. Some CAM/non-CAM 12Z
forecast soundings, most aggressively from the NAM, depict scant
elevated buoyancy developing amid a plume of initially steep
mid-level lapse rates. With thermodynamic profiles suggestive of a
predominant PTYPE of sleet at the surface, these potentially
mixed-phase elevated parcels could support a few lightning flashes.
While thunderstorm probabilities may be nonzero, they appear to be
less than 10 percent at this time.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE CENTRAL
FLORIDA PENINSULA...

...SUMMARY...
Strong thunderstorms may impact parts of central Florida this
morning into this afternoon, and pose at least some risk for a
tornado and locally damaging wind gusts.

...FL Peninsula...
Expansive upper troughing covers the entirety of the CONUS this
morning, with moderate southwesterly flow aloft throughout the base
of this trough extending from the Southeast/Gulf of Mexico across
the Mid-Atlantic States and FL. Surface analysis places a low over
central NC. A cold front extends southwestward from this low through
southeast GA and the FL Big Bend. Modest troughing precedes this
front across central FL, with broad low-level confluence in the
vicinity of this pre-frontal troughing contributing to showers and
thunderstorms. Modest buoyancy persists over the region, with
mesoanalysis estimating MLCAPE around 500 to 750 J/kg.

Showers and thunderstorms are expected to continue throughout the
day as the cold front and pre-frontal troughing both shift gradually
southward. The environment will remain strongly sheared (i.e.
effective bulk shear around 50-55 kt) throughout the afternoon,
supporting the potential for a few more organized storms capable of
damaging wind gusts and perhaps even a brief tornado or two. Wind
fields will weaken with southern extent, with deep-layer vertical
shear weakening as well. As such, the severe potential will likely
maximize this morning into the early afternoon across the central FL
Peninsula.
