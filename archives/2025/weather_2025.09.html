Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0359 AM CST Thu Mar 06 2025

Valid 091200Z - 141200Z

...DISCUSSION...
Medium-range guidance continues to exhibit considerable spread
concerning short wave developments within the evolving pattern
across North America late this coming weekend through the middle of
next week.  Concerning an initial perturbation likely to be slowly
progressing across the southern Great Plains at the outset of the
period, latest model guidance now appears to maintain a less
sheared/more substantive (but positively tilted) wave across the
northeastern Gulf/South Atlantic Seaboard late this weekend into
early next week.  However, it still appears that associated frontal
wave development will remain subdued, at least until it shifts
offshore of the Atlantic coast, which may tend to minimize the risk
for severe storms across the Southeast.

Thereafter, through the middle to latter portion of next week, it
appears that another notable short wave trough will emerge from the
southern mid-latitude Pacific and provide support for cyclogenesis
to the lee of the southern Rockies by Wednesday.  This may quickly
be followed by a much more vigorous and amplified wave, and more
prominent cyclogenesis next Thursday into Friday.  However, in the
wake of the lower latitude weekend trough, low-level moisture return
off the Gulf may be initially limited for the trailing perturbation,
and the timing of the rapidly following wave might not be optimal
with regard to subsequent inland moisture return.  

At least some risk for organized severe convection may materialize
to the east of the Rockies next Wednesday through Thursday night. 
However, the extent and location remain uncertain at this time.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0226 AM CST Thu Mar 06 2025

Valid 081200Z - 091200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS SATURDAY INTO
SATURDAY NIGHT ACROSS PARTS OF NORTH CENTRAL THROUGH EASTERN
TEXAS...WESTERN AND SOUTHERN LOUISIANA...SOUTHERN MISSISSIPPI AND
ALABAMA AMD ADJACENT PORTIONS OF THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE...

...SUMMARY...
Widely scattered strong thunderstorms may impact parts of north
central through eastern Texas into the central Gulf coast vicinity
Saturday through Saturday night, accompanied by a risk for severe
hail.

...Discussion...
Between amplified cyclonic flow, characterized by seasonably low
mid-level heights across much of eastern Canadian and adjacent
portions of the Great Lakes/Northeast into northwestern Atlantic,
and broad ridging across the Gulf Basin into Southeast, broadly
confluent mid-level flow likely will be maintained to the east of
the Rockies.  It appears that a significant mid-level trough and
embedded low, approaching this regime across the southern Rockies by
the beginning of the period, will slowly be forced into and through
it, as a significant upstream short wave trough digs across the
southern mid-latitude eastern Pacific Saturday into early Sunday.  

The latest model output continues to indicate that the lead
perturbation will gradually become increasingly sheared as it
progresses across the southern Great Plains, particularly by late
Saturday through Saturday night.  Based on the various guidance, it
is possible that associated forcing for ascent could support further
deepening of an initial developing frontal wave across north central
Texas.  However, this probably will be short-lived, with
cyclogenesis along the front remaining modest to weak while quickly
developing southeastward then eastward across the Gulf Coast states.

...South Central U.S...
The models do indicate that an influx of moisture off a modifying
boundary layer across the northwestern/north central Gulf will
contribute to a conditionally and convectively unstable environment
across the southeastern Great Plains into north central Gulf coast
vicinity.  Beneath layers with steep lapse rates in the
lower/mid-troposphere, the low-level moisture may contribute to CAPE
on the order of 500-1000 J/kg.  It remains unclear how far inland of
upper Texas through Louisiana coastal areas this will become
boundary-layer based, but as large-scale ascent aids erosion of
mid-level inhibition, the environment may become conducive to widely
scattered strong thunderstorm development with potential to produce
severe hail.  

Deep-layer shear will be strong for both boundary-layer based storm
development and storms rooted above a shallow cool/stable
near-surface layer, lingering ahead of the primary southeastward
advancing cold front, from northeastern Texas through
northern/eastern Louisiana, southern portions of Mississippi/Alabama
and the adjacent western Florida Panhandle.  With storms rooted in
the boundary-layer, a tornado might not be out of the question
across parts of southeastern Texas into southern Louisiana, but
low-level hodographs are forecast to remain on the smaller/weaker
side.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0131 AM CST Thu Mar 06 2025

Valid 071200Z - 081200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF FAR SOUTHEAST NEW
MEXICO INTO FAR WEST TEXAS...

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will amplify while traversing the southern
Rockies, supporting the southward sagging of a surface cold front
across the southern Plains as secondary surface-low development
takes place along the New Mexico/Texas border tomorrow (Friday).
South of the cold front and to the immediate lee of the southern
Rockies, dry and windy conditions are expected. Elevated/Critical
highlights have been introduced where favorable meteorological
conditions will overspread dry fuels that have largely been spared
by preceding rainfall. By afternoon peak heating, sustained westerly
surface winds will exceed 20 mph amid 15 percent RH, especially from
far southeast New Mexico into Far West Texas. Elevated-equivalent
dry/windy conditions are expected over much of the Texas Panhandle
into Oklahoma. However, fire weather highlights have been withheld
given recent rainfall likely dampening fuels to a degree.

Mesoscale Discussion 0148
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0841 AM CST Wed Mar 05 2025

Areas affected...central and northern Florida

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 051441Z - 051615Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated damaging wind gusts are possible through early
afternoon across central and northern Florida.

DISCUSSION...A remnant squall line is moving across northern Florida
this morning. Ahead of this squall line, mid to upper 60s dewpoints
are present across the Florida Peninsula. Currently this airmass
remains capped, but breaks in the clouds should allow sufficient
heating for an uncapped, moderately unstable environment by later
this afternoon. The 12Z JAX RAOB sampled a veering wind profile
favorable for storm organization including supercells. However,
forcing will be the primary limiting factor to a greater severe
weather threat. Convergence along the squall line is weak across
north Florida. While some height falls will overspread the region
through the day, the primary differential vorticity advection
corridor will be focused in the Carolinas and Mid-Atlantic.
Therefore, a few strong to severe storms may be possible, but the
threat should remain too isolated for a watch.

Mesoscale Discussion 0147
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0750 AM CST Wed Mar 05 2025

Areas affected...south-central Virginia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 051350Z - 051545Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...A risk of damaging gusts or a brief tornado will gradually
increase across parts of southern Virginia. A watch may eventually
be needed.

DISCUSSION...A strongly forced low-topped convective line continues
to push east across western VA and NC, with a rather wide region of
rain as well. Instability is weak but shear is quite strong. As
persistent southerly winds bring greater theta-e into the region,
temperatures rising into the 60s should eventually yield sufficient
low-level buoyancy to support strong gusts or a brief QLCS tornado.
Prior to any substantial boundary-layer destabilization, any severe
risk will likely remain tied to the forced line.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 26
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
745 AM EST Wed Mar 5 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Central and Eastern North Carolina
  Central and Eastern South Carolina
  Coastal Waters

* Effective this Wednesday morning and afternoon from 745 AM
  until 100 PM EST.

* Primary threats include...
  A couple tornadoes possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely

SUMMARY...A broken squall line will continue east across the Watch
area through the midday into the early afternoon.  Very strong wind
fields and a destabilizing airmass will support the potential for
embedded circulations in the squall line to pose a risk for damaging
gusts (55-70 mph) and a threat for tornadoes.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 95 statute miles
east and west of a line from 50 miles north of Raleigh NC to 10
miles south of Charleston SC. For a complete depiction of the watch
see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU6).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 25...

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 0.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind

Mesoscale Discussion 0131
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0856 AM CST Tue Mar 04 2025

Areas affected...Isolated wind gusts remain possible through this
morning.

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 19...

Valid 041456Z - 041630Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 19
continues.

SUMMARY...Isolated wind gusts remain possible through this morning.

DISCUSSION...The intensity of the squall line across northeast
Oklahoma has weakened over the past 30 minutes as it moves into an
increasingly stable/cool downstream airmass. Some recovery may may
continue to occur across northern Arkansas and southern Missouri
which may provide just enough instability to maintain the squall
line as it continues east. Given the very strong low-level flow, (60
knots at 1km per SRX VWP), some threat for isolated severe wind
gusts may continue despite the less intense squall line,
particularly in the southern portions of watch 19 where mid-50s
dewpoints and slightly greater instability are present.

SUMMARY...A severe wind, and eventually tornado risk exists over the
area, ahead of the cold front and near and south of the warm front.
A watch may be considered.

DISCUSSION...Although a greater threat of severe storms including
tornadoes is expected into the afternoon, some severe risk may
persist with the ongoing early day activity as a line of storms
continues east out of TX and eastern OK.

12Z soundings indicate a capping inversion near 700 mb, by virtue of
relatively cool surface conditions near the warm front. However,
very strong southerly winds above the surface with the low-level
jet, as well as areas of daytime heating will allow for a growing
area of concern across the developing warm sector, including much of
LA and into MS.

In the near term, robust storms persist along the cold front over
northeast TX, with a few counties width of warm sector west of the
warm front. At least a few hours of severe risk likely remains in
this area, prior to expected diurnal maximum, and a watch will
likely be needed to address this early threat.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
815 AM CST Tue Mar 4 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Southern Arkansas
  Western and Northern Louisiana
  East Texas

* Effective this Tuesday morning and afternoon from 815 AM until
  300 PM CST.

* Primary threats include...
  A few tornadoes and a couple intense tornadoes possible
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 75
    mph likely
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...A broken squall line will continue east into the Watch
area this morning.  A destabilizing airmass near and immediately
ahead of this strong to severe thunderstorm activity will aid in a
severe risk continuing eastward through the early afternoon. 
Scattered severe gusts and a risk for tornadoes will be the primary
hazards with the stronger storms.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 75 statute miles
east and west of a line from 25 miles northwest of Pine Bluff AR to
60 miles southwest of Fort Polk LA. For a complete depiction of the
watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU0).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0322 PM CST Sat Mar 01 2025

Valid 031200Z - 091200Z

Fire weather concerns are expected to remain very active through
much of next week with a progressive pattern resulting in a series
of strong mid/upper-level troughs moving across the southern U.S.
Meanwhile, the persistent dry conditions across the southern High
Plains will continue to promote further drying of fuels, with
critically dry fuels expected over a broad area. Multiple days of
very strong winds, very low minimum RH values, and critically
receptive fuels are expected. Higher-end critical conditions - with
significant fire potential - appear probable on Day 3/Monday and Day
4/Tuesday.

...Southern Plains: Day 3/Monday - Day 4/Tuesday and Day 6/Thursday
- Day 7/Friday...
A large mid-level trough is forecast to rapidly deepen over the Four
Corners on Day 3/Monday as strong mid-level flow overspreads a warm
and dry low-level airmass across the Southern Plains. In response,
an area of rapidly developing lee cyclogenesis is expected across
portions of CO/KS, which will tighten the surface pressure gradient.
The combination of very strong surface winds, very low minimum RH,
and critically receptive fuels (including locally heavy herbaceous
fuel loading) will promote higher-end and potentially significant
fire weather conditions - especially across portions of New Mexico
and far western Texas. 

Higher-end critical fire weather conditions (with significant fire
weather potential) will also be possible Day 4/Tuesday across
portions of Texas as the aforementioned surface low moves eastward.
The primary uncertainty remains the eastward extent of the fire
weather threat, which may be modulated somewhat by wetting rainfall
ahead of the system. 

After a brief break from large-scale fire weather conditions across
the southern High Plains Day 5/Wednesday, fire weather conditions
are forecast to return Day 6/Thursday through at least Day 7/Friday
as another mid-level trough moves across the southern U.S. Enough
run-to-run and inter-model consistency exists to introduce 40%
probabilities for Critical conditions both Day 6/Thursday (in a dry
return flow pattern) and Day 7/Friday (behind a dryline/frontal
passage), where the most favorable overlap of strong winds, low RH,
and receptive fuel is currently expected. 

...Eastern US: Day 5/Wednesday - Day 6/Thursday...
Local fire weather conditions are possible Day 5/Wednesday and Day
6/Thursday across portions of the Southeast U.S., as dry/breezy
conditions occur behind a cold frontal passage. However, at this
time, confidence for any critical fire weather risk is low due to
precipitation potential ahead of the front perhaps reducing fuel
receptiveness.

Valid 021200Z - 031200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR THE EASTERN
TEXAS PANHANDLE...WESTERN OKLAHOMA...PARTS OF SOUTHWEST KANSAS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated strong to severe storms are possible from western North
Texas into northwest Oklahoma and adjacent southwest Kansas on
Sunday. Large hail and strong/marginally severe winds are the
primary hazards.

...Synopsis...
A compact upper low currently in the lower Colorado Valley will
eject into the southern High Plains by early afternoon on Sunday. A
modest surface low will develop in response to this feature and will
generally track through the Texas Panhandle into western/central
Oklahoma. Moisture return on the western flank of the surface high
to the east will be relatively weak. However, with 50s F dewpoints
in portions of Central Texas, it is possible that mid/upper 40s F
could return into the Texas Panhandle/western Oklahoma vicinity
during the afternoon.

...Eastern Texas Panhandle into western Oklahoma Vicinity...
With the approach of the compact shortwave trough, some elevated
showers and embedded thunderstorms are possible Sunday morning. This
activity will move northeastward and may persist into the early/mid
afternoon in some areas. The primary severe risk will be associated
with the surface low and whatever destabilization is able to occur
in the wake of the early activity. As mentioned, moisture will be
rather modest. Compensating for this, however, will be very cold
temperatures aloft (-20 to -22 C in the core of the upper
low/trough). At lest a narrow band of buoyancy is expected to
develop in the eastern Texas Panhandle and far western Oklahoma. A
strong mid-level jet on the southern/eastern flank of the upper
trough will promote at least marginal supercell structures capable
of large hail and strong/marginally severe winds. Storms are more
likely to be elevated farther north into Kansas and east into
central Oklahoma. Even so, small to marginally severe hail and
isolated strong gusts would be possible in the strongest storms.

Valid 011700Z - 021200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHEAST ARIZONA INTO
FAR SOUTHWESTERN NEW MEXICO...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF WESTERN NORTH AND
SOUTH CAROLINA...

...Mid-Atlantic/Southeast...
Latest high-resolution ensemble guidance continues to suggest a
large area of elevated to near-critical fire weather conditions in
the lee of the Appalachians and across the Southeast this afternoon.
A very dry airmass has settled across the region in the wake of a
dry cold front, with current surface observations indicating
dewpoints between 25-35F. Highs near 70F today will support several
hours of critical minimum RH values near 20-30% amidst receptive
fuels and breezy downslope west/southwesterly surface winds. At this
time, the best overlap of stronger surface winds (sustained winds
near 20 mph and wind gusts 20-30 mph) and critical fuels appears to
be across portions of western North and South Carolina, where a
Critical fire weather area has been introduced. The Elevated area
was also expanded farther across portions of the Northeast, along
the Appalachians, and across the Southeast. 

...Southwest...
Latest water vapor imagery shows an upper low over portions of 
southern CA, which is forecast to move eastward into southwest AZ by
this evening. As this occurs, strong mid-level flow is expected to
overspread portions of the Desert Southwest. The latest surface
observations suggest a very dry airmass is in place, with critical
RH values already being observed. Strong/gusty surface winds are
expected to develop over the next few hours, as a surface cyclone
strengthens across the Lower Colorado River Basin. Higher-end
critical fire weather conditions are possible across portions of
Southern Arizona, where sustained winds near 30 mph and minimum RH
values less than 10% are expected for a few hours this afternoon.  

Please see the previous discussion below for more information.

..Elliott.. 03/01/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0148 AM CST Sat Mar 01 2025/

...Synopsis...
A pronounced mid-level trough will traverse the Desert Southwest as
a larger-scale upper trough amplifies along the East Coast today. A
surface cyclone will develop over the Lower Colorado River Basin,
while a surface trough and accompanying cold front sweep across the
Eastern Seaboard into the Southeast during the afternoon,
encouraging dry and windy conditions across both meteorological
regimes. Across the Lower Colorado River Basin, 20+ mph sustained
southerly surface winds will coincide with 10-15 percent RH for at
least a few hours around peak heating, warranting the maintenance of
Critical highlights given drying fuels. Likewise, fuels continue to
dry from Virginia to Alabama, where the passage of the surface lee
trough/cold front will support 15+ mph sustained southwesterly
surface winds, that should shift to a northwesterly direction with
time. RH will dip to at least 30 percent over several locales from
the Mid Atlantic to the Southeast, where fuels remain receptive to
wildfire spread and where Elevated highlights remain in place.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1022 AM CST Sat Mar 01 2025

Valid 011630Z - 021200Z

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms appear unlikely through tonight.

...Synopsis and Discussion...
12Z observed soundings, recent surface observations, and
satellite-based precipitable water estimates across AZ show very
little moisture present this morning. A closed upper low over
southern CA and northern Baja California will continue to advance
eastward across the Southwest through the period. While strong
large-scale ascent and cold mid-level temperatures will accompany
this feature, nearly all guidance shows a lack of even weak
instability until later this evening, mainly on the
subsident/backside of the upper low. While showers should eventually
move across parts of AZ late this evening and overnight, the
potential for thunderstorms appears less than 10% due to the very
limited low-level moisture and instability forecast. Elsewhere,
thunderstorms are not expected across the remainder of the CONUS
through tonight.
