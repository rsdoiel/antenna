Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0747 AM CDT Sun Mar 09 2025

Valid 091300Z - 101200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR SOUTHEAST
ALABAMA INTO SOUTHERN GEORGIA AND INTO NORTH FLORIDA AND THE
PANHANDLE...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms are possible today from
parts of northern Florida into far southeast Alabama and southern
Georgia.

...Far Southeast Alabama/Southern Georgia/Northern Florida...
Morning surface analysis places a low near the mouth of the MS River
and a maritime front draped east over the continental shelf waters
south of the FL Panhandle.  A lead mid-level shortwave trough,
evident in early morning water-vapor imagery, is moving east along
the central Gulf Coast.  Farther upstream over AR-OK-TX, a mid-level
low and associated positive-tilt trough are forecast to move
east-southeastward into southern AL and the northern Gulf of
America.  Episodic scattered showers/thunderstorms are forecast in
the vicinity or north of the west-east oriented frontal zone. 
Surface-based development should be confined to areas near and to
the south of the front, where weak instability (200-800 J/kg MLCAPE)
and strong deep-layer shear (45-55 kt effective shear) are forecast.
A mix of a few strong to occasionally severe thunderstorms, in the
form of weak supercell structures and organized linear bands, will
be capable of isolated 55-70 mph gusts, perhaps a risk for a brief
tornado, and marginally severe hail (up to 1.25 inches in diameter).
A gradual waning of the severe risk is forecast by late evening.

Mesoscale Discussion 0156
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0752 AM CST Sat Mar 08 2025

Areas affected...Parts of central/northeast TX into northwest LA

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 081352Z - 081545Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Strong to locally severe storms remain possible through
the morning. The southward extent of development is uncertain.

DISCUSSION...The elevated supercells that earlier moved across parts
of north-central into northeast TX have weakened somewhat, though a
couple strong cells persist near the northeast Metroplex, while a
small elevated bowing cluster is approaching the ArkLaTex region.
The 12Z SHV/FWD soundings depict relatively cool profiles and MUCAPE
around 500 J/kg, though both also depict weak lapse rates in a
saturated layer above 600 mb. With effective shear remaining
favorable for organized convection, the ongoing storms may persist
and at least occasionally pose a localized threat of hail and strong
gusts, before generally moving into less-favorable instability with
eastward extent. 

Farther south, rich low-level moisture (with mid/upper 60s F) is in
place near and south of a cold front draped from central into
northeast TX, with MLCAPE expected to increase to 500-1000 J/kg
later this morning. Recent HRRR runs depict storm development near
and just south of this front later this morning into parts of
east-central TX, possibly in response to a low-amplitude midlevel
shortwave trough moving across central TX. Should development occur
in this area, deep-layer shear will support organized storms, with a
somewhat greater conditional severe potential compared to areas
farther north. The scenario of storm development this morning near
the front or within the warm sector remains quite uncertain, but
will continue to be monitored.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0359 AM CST Thu Mar 06 2025

Valid 091200Z - 141200Z

...DISCUSSION...
Medium-range guidance continues to exhibit considerable spread
concerning short wave developments within the evolving pattern
across North America late this coming weekend through the middle of
next week.  Concerning an initial perturbation likely to be slowly
progressing across the southern Great Plains at the outset of the
period, latest model guidance now appears to maintain a less
sheared/more substantive (but positively tilted) wave across the
northeastern Gulf/South Atlantic Seaboard late this weekend into
early next week.  However, it still appears that associated frontal
wave development will remain subdued, at least until it shifts
offshore of the Atlantic coast, which may tend to minimize the risk
for severe storms across the Southeast.

Thereafter, through the middle to latter portion of next week, it
appears that another notable short wave trough will emerge from the
southern mid-latitude Pacific and provide support for cyclogenesis
to the lee of the southern Rockies by Wednesday.  This may quickly
be followed by a much more vigorous and amplified wave, and more
prominent cyclogenesis next Thursday into Friday.  However, in the
wake of the lower latitude weekend trough, low-level moisture return
off the Gulf may be initially limited for the trailing perturbation,
and the timing of the rapidly following wave might not be optimal
with regard to subsequent inland moisture return.  

At least some risk for organized severe convection may materialize
to the east of the Rockies next Wednesday through Thursday night. 
However, the extent and location remain uncertain at this time.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0226 AM CST Thu Mar 06 2025

Valid 081200Z - 091200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS SATURDAY INTO
SATURDAY NIGHT ACROSS PARTS OF NORTH CENTRAL THROUGH EASTERN
TEXAS...WESTERN AND SOUTHERN LOUISIANA...SOUTHERN MISSISSIPPI AND
ALABAMA AMD ADJACENT PORTIONS OF THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE...

...SUMMARY...
Widely scattered strong thunderstorms may impact parts of north
central through eastern Texas into the central Gulf coast vicinity
Saturday through Saturday night, accompanied by a risk for severe
hail.

...Discussion...
Between amplified cyclonic flow, characterized by seasonably low
mid-level heights across much of eastern Canadian and adjacent
portions of the Great Lakes/Northeast into northwestern Atlantic,
and broad ridging across the Gulf Basin into Southeast, broadly
confluent mid-level flow likely will be maintained to the east of
the Rockies.  It appears that a significant mid-level trough and
embedded low, approaching this regime across the southern Rockies by
the beginning of the period, will slowly be forced into and through
it, as a significant upstream short wave trough digs across the
southern mid-latitude eastern Pacific Saturday into early Sunday.  

The latest model output continues to indicate that the lead
perturbation will gradually become increasingly sheared as it
progresses across the southern Great Plains, particularly by late
Saturday through Saturday night.  Based on the various guidance, it
is possible that associated forcing for ascent could support further
deepening of an initial developing frontal wave across north central
Texas.  However, this probably will be short-lived, with
cyclogenesis along the front remaining modest to weak while quickly
developing southeastward then eastward across the Gulf Coast states.

...South Central U.S...
The models do indicate that an influx of moisture off a modifying
boundary layer across the northwestern/north central Gulf will
contribute to a conditionally and convectively unstable environment
across the southeastern Great Plains into north central Gulf coast
vicinity.  Beneath layers with steep lapse rates in the
lower/mid-troposphere, the low-level moisture may contribute to CAPE
on the order of 500-1000 J/kg.  It remains unclear how far inland of
upper Texas through Louisiana coastal areas this will become
boundary-layer based, but as large-scale ascent aids erosion of
mid-level inhibition, the environment may become conducive to widely
scattered strong thunderstorm development with potential to produce
severe hail.  

Deep-layer shear will be strong for both boundary-layer based storm
development and storms rooted above a shallow cool/stable
near-surface layer, lingering ahead of the primary southeastward
advancing cold front, from northeastern Texas through
northern/eastern Louisiana, southern portions of Mississippi/Alabama
and the adjacent western Florida Panhandle.  With storms rooted in
the boundary-layer, a tornado might not be out of the question
across parts of southeastern Texas into southern Louisiana, but
low-level hodographs are forecast to remain on the smaller/weaker
side.

Valid 071200Z - 081200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF FAR SOUTHEAST NEW
MEXICO INTO FAR WEST TEXAS...

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will amplify while traversing the southern
Rockies, supporting the southward sagging of a surface cold front
across the southern Plains as secondary surface-low development
takes place along the New Mexico/Texas border tomorrow (Friday).
South of the cold front and to the immediate lee of the southern
Rockies, dry and windy conditions are expected. Elevated/Critical
highlights have been introduced where favorable meteorological
conditions will overspread dry fuels that have largely been spared
by preceding rainfall. By afternoon peak heating, sustained westerly
surface winds will exceed 20 mph amid 15 percent RH, especially from
far southeast New Mexico into Far West Texas. Elevated-equivalent
dry/windy conditions are expected over much of the Texas Panhandle
into Oklahoma. However, fire weather highlights have been withheld
given recent rainfall likely dampening fuels to a degree.

Mesoscale Discussion 0148
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0841 AM CST Wed Mar 05 2025

Areas affected...central and northern Florida

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 051441Z - 051615Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated damaging wind gusts are possible through early
afternoon across central and northern Florida.

DISCUSSION...A remnant squall line is moving across northern Florida
this morning. Ahead of this squall line, mid to upper 60s dewpoints
are present across the Florida Peninsula. Currently this airmass
remains capped, but breaks in the clouds should allow sufficient
heating for an uncapped, moderately unstable environment by later
this afternoon. The 12Z JAX RAOB sampled a veering wind profile
favorable for storm organization including supercells. However,
forcing will be the primary limiting factor to a greater severe
weather threat. Convergence along the squall line is weak across
north Florida. While some height falls will overspread the region
through the day, the primary differential vorticity advection
corridor will be focused in the Carolinas and Mid-Atlantic.
Therefore, a few strong to severe storms may be possible, but the
threat should remain too isolated for a watch.

Mesoscale Discussion 0147
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0750 AM CST Wed Mar 05 2025

Areas affected...south-central Virginia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 051350Z - 051545Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...A risk of damaging gusts or a brief tornado will gradually
increase across parts of southern Virginia. A watch may eventually
be needed.

DISCUSSION...A strongly forced low-topped convective line continues
to push east across western VA and NC, with a rather wide region of
rain as well. Instability is weak but shear is quite strong. As
persistent southerly winds bring greater theta-e into the region,
temperatures rising into the 60s should eventually yield sufficient
low-level buoyancy to support strong gusts or a brief QLCS tornado.
Prior to any substantial boundary-layer destabilization, any severe
risk will likely remain tied to the forced line.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 26
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
745 AM EST Wed Mar 5 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Central and Eastern North Carolina
  Central and Eastern South Carolina
  Coastal Waters

* Effective this Wednesday morning and afternoon from 745 AM
  until 100 PM EST.

* Primary threats include...
  A couple tornadoes possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely

SUMMARY...A broken squall line will continue east across the Watch
area through the midday into the early afternoon.  Very strong wind
fields and a destabilizing airmass will support the potential for
embedded circulations in the squall line to pose a risk for damaging
gusts (55-70 mph) and a threat for tornadoes.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 95 statute miles
east and west of a line from 50 miles north of Raleigh NC to 10
miles south of Charleston SC. For a complete depiction of the watch
see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU6).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 25...

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 0.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 60 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 300. Mean
storm motion vector 24035.

Mesoscale Discussion 0131
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0856 AM CST Tue Mar 04 2025

Areas affected...Isolated wind gusts remain possible through this
morning.

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 19...

Valid 041456Z - 041630Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 19
continues.

SUMMARY...Isolated wind gusts remain possible through this morning.

DISCUSSION...The intensity of the squall line across northeast
Oklahoma has weakened over the past 30 minutes as it moves into an
increasingly stable/cool downstream airmass. Some recovery may may
continue to occur across northern Arkansas and southern Missouri
which may provide just enough instability to maintain the squall
line as it continues east. Given the very strong low-level flow, (60
knots at 1km per SRX VWP), some threat for isolated severe wind
gusts may continue despite the less intense squall line,
particularly in the southern portions of watch 19 where mid-50s
dewpoints and slightly greater instability are present.

Mesoscale Discussion 0130
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0749 AM CST Tue Mar 04 2025

Areas affected...Arklatex into the Sabine Valley and vicinity

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 041349Z - 041545Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...A severe wind, and eventually tornado risk exists over the
area, ahead of the cold front and near and south of the warm front.
A watch may be considered.

DISCUSSION...Although a greater threat of severe storms including
tornadoes is expected into the afternoon, some severe risk may
persist with the ongoing early day activity as a line of storms
continues east out of TX and eastern OK.

12Z soundings indicate a capping inversion near 700 mb, by virtue of
relatively cool surface conditions near the warm front. However,
very strong southerly winds above the surface with the low-level
jet, as well as areas of daytime heating will allow for a growing
area of concern across the developing warm sector, including much of
LA and into MS.

In the near term, robust storms persist along the cold front over
northeast TX, with a few counties width of warm sector west of the
warm front. At least a few hours of severe risk likely remains in
this area, prior to expected diurnal maximum, and a watch will
likely be needed to address this early threat.
