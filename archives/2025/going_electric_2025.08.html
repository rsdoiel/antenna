Hyundai Motor Group, including

said there’s “a lot of uncertainty” around the promising new battery

and Chinese battery giants CATL and BYD, who will be the first to get
the “holy grail” of battery tech on the market?

approach to going all-electric, bolstered by several new models that
made global debuts, including the Concept EV2, PV5 lineup, and the Kia
EV4, which we learned will officially be sold in the US.

Tesla’s stock (TSLA) is crashing by as much as 8% today. CEO Elon Musk
predicted that the stock would get crushed “like a soufflé being smashed
by a sledgehammer” if it didn’t show profit growth, which is what is
happening now.

<p>
The Engwe LE20 is an interesting take on the cargo e-bike format. It’s
marketed as a budget-friendly utility e-bike that can handle hauling
groceries, gear, or even a passenger. At the same time, it looks like a
cross between a compact cargo bike and a semi-fat tire hybrid-style
bike, with a chunky frame, small wheels, and a long rear rack. But how
does it actually perform in the real world? After spending some time
riding and testing it, here’s what I found.
