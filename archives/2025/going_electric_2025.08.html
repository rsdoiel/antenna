Kia recently held its annual EV Day event overseas, and we were one of
the select outlets invited to attend in person. During that time,
<a href="https://electrek.co/guides/kia/">Kia</a> executives outlined
the Korean brand’s global EV strategy, which reiterated its unwavering
approach to going all-electric, bolstered by several new models that
made global debuts, including the Concept EV2, PV5 lineup, and the Kia
EV4, which we learned will officially be sold in the US.

<a href="https://electrek.co/guides/li-auto/">Li Auto’s</a> (NASDAQ: LI)
stock climbed nearly 15% on Tuesday after the company revealed the first

Tesla’s stock (TSLA) is crashing by as much as 8% today. CEO Elon Musk
predicted that the stock would get crushed “like a soufflé being smashed
by a sledgehammer” if it didn’t show profit growth, which is what is
happening now.

<p>
The Engwe LE20 is an interesting take on the cargo e-bike format. It’s
marketed as a budget-friendly utility e-bike that can handle hauling
groceries, gear, or even a passenger. At the same time, it looks like a
cross between a compact cargo bike and a semi-fat tire hybrid-style
bike, with a chunky frame, small wheels, and a long rear rack. But how
does it actually perform in the real world? After spending some time
riding and testing it, here’s what I found.
