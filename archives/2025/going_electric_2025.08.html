<p>
Tesla’s stock (TSLA) is crashing by as much as 8% today. CEO Elon Musk
predicted that the stock would get crushed “like a soufflé being smashed
by a sledgehammer” if it didn’t show profit growth, which is what is
happening now.

<p>
The Engwe LE20 is an interesting take on the cargo e-bike format. It’s
marketed as a budget-friendly utility e-bike that can handle hauling
groceries, gear, or even a passenger. At the same time, it looks like a
cross between a compact cargo bike and a semi-fat tire hybrid-style
bike, with a chunky frame, small wheels, and a long rear rack. But how
does it actually perform in the real world? After spending some time
riding and testing it, here’s what I found.
