Mesoscale Discussion 0908
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0333 PM CDT Tue May 20 2025

Areas affected...Eastern Arkansas to the Tennessee River Valley

Concerning...Tornado Watch 303...305...

Valid 202033Z - 202230Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 303, 305 continues.

SUMMARY...The threat for large hail and tornadoes continues across
watches 303 and 305, though the potential for widespread damaging
winds is expected to increase over the next 2-3 hours across for
parts of northwest TN and far southwest KY. The greatest
hail/tornado threat will likely be focused across southeast AR into
northeast MS and parts of middle TN.

DISCUSSION...Numerous supercells continue to mature across eastern
AR with more isolated to scattered coverage across northern MS into
western/middle TN. Convective coverage/close storm proximity has
resulted in destructive interactions of the past hour across
northeast AR, and recent velocity imagery from KNQA shows signs of
consolidating outflow across northeast AR. This suggests that the
early stages of upscale growth is occurring and may promote an
increasing damaging/severe wind threat downstream into parts of
western TN and west/southwest KY. Strong low-level shear sampled by
the KQNA VWP hints that even with this storm mode transition,
embedded circulations will be possible as the line becomes more
organized. 

Further east and south, more isolated to scattered storm coverage
has yielded more discrete supercells. Large hail up to golf ball
size has already been reported, and with a very buoyant and strongly
sheared environment still in place downstream, very large hail will
remain a concern for far southeast AR, northern MS, and parts of
middle TN. Recent WoFS guidance suggests hail sizes between 2 to 2.5
inches will be possible with these cells over the next couple of
hours. These discrete storms are beginning to display organized
mesocyclones and will continue to migrate across a warm sector with
STP values between 2-3, suggesting that the tornado threat
(including the potential for a strong tornado) is likely increasing
with these cells.

Mesoscale Discussion 0907
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0242 PM CDT Tue May 20 2025

Areas affected...parts of ern Kentucky...ern
Tennessee...southwestern Virginia and southwestern West Virginia

Concerning...Tornado Watch 302...

Valid 201942Z - 202145Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 302 continues.

SUMMARY...The line of storms overspreading the region could still
intensify and organize further during the next couple of hours,
accompanied by increasing potential for strong to severe surface
gusts, and perhaps a tornado.

DISCUSSION...The narrow linear convective system has maintained
generally modest intensity as it continues to advance into/across
the Cumberland and southern Allegheny Plateau vicinity.  Due to the
strength of the upper flow/shear, there has been little in the way
of trailing anvil precipitation develop, and the elongated
convectively generated surface cold pool remains modest to weak in
strength.  However, in the presence of strong deep-layer shear,
objective analysis indicates the potential for continuing updraft
inflow of moist boundary-layer air, characterized by CAPE of
500-1000 J/kg, into the crest of the higher terrain.  This could
still promote further intensification and organization during the
next few hours.  

Where it is intersected by the line of storms, the quasi-stationary
to warm frontal zone, north of Jackson KY toward the Charleston WV
area, may still provide one possible focus for an evolving meso-beta
scale cyclonic circulation, with increasing potential for damaging
wind gusts and/or a tornado.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0252 PM CDT Tue May 20 2025

Valid 202000Z - 211200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PORTIONS OF
THE MID MS VALLEY TO THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS...

...SUMMARY...
Multiple rounds of severe thunderstorms are expected today through
this evening, centered on the Mid/Deep South, Tennessee/Lower Ohio
Valleys, and Cumberland Plateau. Tornadoes, some of which could be
strong, along with scattered to widespread damaging winds, and large
to isolated significant severe hail will be possible.

...20Z Update...
Much of the previous forecast remains on track. Earlier storms
across the TN Valley have matured into a QLCS, which is now
approaching the central Appalachians. These storms should progress
toward the eastern extent of a buoyant warm sector with a continued
risk of damaging gusts and perhaps a couple of tornadoes. Storms
poised to cross the MS River over the central MS Valley, and more
discrete storms farther east over western TN/northern MS, should
intensify further as they move eastward amid a strongly sheared and
unstable airmass. The more intense, discrete storms will be capable
of large to very large hail and at least isolated tornadoes. The
more dominant supercells that move into northeast MS, middle TN, and
southern KY, where surface is flow is relatively more backed, will
have the best chance at producing a strong tornado. Lastly, storms
should continue to intensify ahead of a surface low over central IL
and immediate surrounding areas. Shear/buoyancy over this region
favors supercell structures with a continued large hail/tornado
risk.

..Squitieri.. 05/20/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1115 AM CDT Tue May 20 2025/

...KY/TN...
Thunderstorms are ongoing across central KY/middle TN.  These storms
will progress eastward through the afternoon into a moist and
increasingly unstable air mass over eastern KY/TN and eventually
into western WV/VA.  Most model guidance suggests that storms will
intensify through the day, with an increasing risk of damaging wind
gusts and a few tornadoes.  Refer to MCD #902 for further details.

...AR into the TN Valley this afternoon/evening...
In the wake of the aforementioned convection, rapid heating is
occurring across eastern AR/west TN/northern MS.  Surface dewpoints
in the upper 60s to 70s and steep mid level lapse rates will yield
afternoon MLCAPE values around 3000 J/kg and only a weak cap.  This
will lead to the development of multiple clusters of intense
thunderstorms (including supercells) that will track eastward
through the afternoon and evening hours.  The initial storms will
pose a risk of very large hail and a few tornadoes.  As the activity
progresses eastward, the risk of damaging winds will increase with a
persistent risk of tornadoes.  Strong tornadoes will be possible. 
Storms are expected to get as far east as northwest GA tonight
before slowly weakening.

...MO/IL...
Satellite imagery shows a well-defined shortwave trough and
associated surface low over IA/MO.  Ahead of this feature, southerly
low-level winds have transported mid 60s dewpoints into central IL,
where strong heating is now occurring.  This will result in moderate
CAPE across the region and encourage rapid thunderstorm development
over northeast and east-central MO by mid-afternoon.  Steep lapse
rates aloft and favorable deep-layer shear will support supercell
structures capable of large hail, damaging winds, and a few
tornadoes.  Storms will track across IL and into central IN this
evening.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0249 PM CDT Tue May 20 2025

Valid 211200Z - 221200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

A departing mid-level jet should support localized downslope
enhancement of winds and drying along the Colorado Front Range
Wednesday. However, fuels are not particularly receptive to fire
spread with ongoing green up along the Front Range, mitigating
overall fire weather threat. Otherwise, no widespread fire weather
concerns across the CONUS.

..Williams.. 05/20/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0141 AM CDT Tue May 20 2025/

...Synopsis...
A belt of enhanced westerly midlevel flow will be in place across
the central Rockies on Wednesday. This will promote locally
dry/breezy conditions along the CO Front Range during the afternoon.
While locally elevated fire-weather conditions are possible, the
overall risk appears too localized for highlights. Elsewhere across
the CONUS, a limited overlap of warm, dry, and windy conditions
should limit fire-weather concerns.

Valid 221200Z - 231200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR SOUTHWEST
OKLAHOMA INTO NORTHWEST TEXAS...

...SUMMARY...
A few severe storms are possible across portions of Northwest Texas
into southwest Oklahoma on Thursday.

...Southwest Oklahoma into Northwest Texas...
Modest moisture return is possible ahead of a quasi-stationary
boundary near the Red River. Strong heating south of the boundary
will support a well-mixed boundary layer with perhaps 2000-2500 J/kg
MLCAPE in some areas. Moisture will likely be a bit shallow and
dewpoints will tend to mix int the mid/upper 50s F, though guidance
still suggests 60s F near the boundary. Moderate northwest flow
aloft will promote 40-50 kts of effective shear. A few organized
storms appear possible with an attendant risk for large hail and
severe winds.

...Carolinas...
Strong mid-level flow will persist across the region. However, the
surface low will be well offshore and low-level forcing will be
nebulous at best. It is unclear how many storms will form during the
afternoon and, with dewpoints generally falling into the 50s F,
there intensity is also questionable. Confidence is too low for
unconditional severe probabilities, but strong wind gusts are not
completely out of the question.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1221 PM CDT Tue May 20 2025

Valid 211200Z - 221200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS IN THE UPPER
OHIO VALLEY...SOUTHERN VIRIGINIA...CENTRAL/EASTERN NORTH
CAROLINA...NORTH FLORIDA...OZARKS VICINITY...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated strong to severe storms are possible from parts of the
upper Ohio Valley, southern Virginia/North Carolina and parts of
North Florida. Additional strong to severe storms are possible from
parts of the Ozarks into the Mid-South.

...Synopsis...
A compact shortwave trough will move through portions of the
mid/upper Ohio Valley during the morning/early afternoon. A surface
low across the lower Great Lakes will move eastward with a weak warm
front near the OH/PA border. Another surface low will develop along
the NC/VA border along a wedge front. Weak moisture return is
possible in parts of the southern Plains ahead of a weak cold front.

...Southern Virginia and adjacent North Carolina...
Cooler air is expected to be in place across the Mid-Atlantic. With
early day precipitation occurring, this cold air should be
reinforced. Convective development will likely be focused within the
higher terrain as well as along a wedge front near the NC/VA border.
South of the front, 1500-2000 J/kg MLCAPE appears possible. 45-50
kts off effective shear will promote organized cells capable of
damaging winds and large hail. Low-level shear will not be very
strong, but a supercell interacting with the boundary could produce
a tornado.

...Upper Ohio Valley...
At least muted surface heating is expected in a narrow zone between
the surface low and warm front. Cold temperatures aloft (-14 to -16
C at 500 mb) will support 750-1000 J/kg MLCAPE. Deep-layer shear
will not be overly strong, but 30-35 kts of effective shear could
support marginally organized storms. Isolated damaging winds as well
as small to marginally severe hail could occur. A conditional threat
for a brief tornado exists with a stronger storm near the warm
front.

...Northeast Oklahoma into Ozarks/Mid-South...
Limited moisture and forcing will limit potential for storms along
the front during the afternoon. During the evening, a strengthening
low-level jet, though still modest, will promote some potential for
elevated storm development. A belt of strong mid-level northwest
flow is expected to develop later in the day. With steep mid-level
lapse rates and 50+ kts off effective shear, the stronger storms
would be capable of large hail.

...North Florida...
Along the southeastward moving cold front, 2000-2500 J/kg MLCAPE is
probable given low/mid 70s F dewpoints. Effective shear will remain
strongest behind the boundary, but a cluster or two of storms could
potentially produce damaging winds.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1150 AM CDT Tue May 20 2025

Valid 201700Z - 211200Z

...Northeastern Minnesota...
Recent precipitation in addition to cool temperatures and higher
relative humidity have mitigated the fire weather threat across the
Red River Valley of the North. Elevated fire weather conditions
including east winds of 15-25 mph and relative humidity as low as 20
percent are still expected across northeastern Minnesota where fuels
remain marginally dry/receptive to spread.

..Williams.. 05/20/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0140 AM CDT Tue May 20 2025/

...Synopsis...
A midlevel low will drift slowly northward across portions of the
northern Plains, while an accompanying surface low advances eastward
from the Mid MS Valley into the OH Valley through the period. North
of the surface low, a tight pressure gradient will favor
breezy/gusty easterly surface winds across parts of the Upper MS
Valley. Over northern MN, these breezy/gusty surface winds will
combine with around 25 percent afternoon RH, and given modestly
receptive fuels, elevated fire-weather conditions can be expected. 

On the backside of the surface low, locally dry/breezy post-frontal
conditions will develop across parts of the central High Plains.
While locally elevated fire-weather conditions are possible, a
limited spatial overlap of the breezy winds and low RH atop
receptive fuels should generally limit the fire-weather risk.

Valid 201630Z - 211200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON
AND TONIGHT FROM EASTERN ARKANSAS INTO MUCH OF THE TENNESSEE VALLEY
AND THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS...

...SUMMARY...
Multiple rounds of severe thunderstorms are expected today through
this evening, centered on the Mid/Deep South, Tennessee/Lower Ohio
Valleys, and Cumberland Plateau. Tornadoes, some of which could be
strong, along with scattered to widespread damaging winds, and large
to isolated significant severe hail will be possible.

...KY/TN...
Thunderstorms are ongoing across central KY/middle TN.  These storms
will progress eastward through the afternoon into a moist and
increasingly unstable air mass over eastern KY/TN and eventually
into western WV/VA.  Most model guidance suggests that storms will
intensify through the day, with an increasing risk of damaging wind
gusts and a few tornadoes.  Refer to MCD #902 for further details.

...AR into the TN Valley this afternoon/evening...
In the wake of the aforementioned convection, rapid heating is
occurring across eastern AR/west TN/northern MS.  Surface dewpoints
in the upper 60s to 70s and steep mid level lapse rates will yield
afternoon MLCAPE values around 3000 J/kg and only a weak cap.  This
will lead to the development of multiple clusters of intense
thunderstorms (including supercells) that will track eastward
through the afternoon and evening hours.  The initial storms will
pose a risk of very large hail and a few tornadoes.  As the activity
progresses eastward, the risk of damaging winds will increase with a
persistent risk of tornadoes.  Strong tornadoes will be possible. 
Storms are expected to get as far east as northwest GA tonight
before slowly weakening.

...MO/IL...
Satellite imagery shows a well-defined shortwave trough and
associated surface low over IA/MO.  Ahead of this feature, southerly
low-level winds have transported mid 60s dewpoints into central IL,
where strong heating is now occurring.  This will result in moderate
CAPE across the region and encourage rapid thunderstorm development
over northeast and east-central MO by mid-afternoon.  Steep lapse
rates aloft and favorable deep-layer shear will support supercell
structures capable of large hail, damaging winds, and a few
tornadoes.  Storms will track across IL and into central IN this
evening.

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS MID/DEEP SOUTH
TO TN VALLEY AND CUMBERLAND PLATEAU...

...SUMMARY...
Multiple rounds of severe thunderstorms are expected today through
this evening, centered on the Mid/Deep South, Tennessee/Lower Ohio
Valleys, and Cumberland Plateau. Tornadoes, some of which could be
strong, along with scattered to widespread damaging winds, and large
to isolated significant severe hail will be possible.

...Mid/Deep South to the TN/Lower OH Valleys and Cumberland
Plateau...
Water-vapor imagery this morning shows a negatively tilted,
large-scale mid to upper-level trough centered over the Dakotas
southeastward through the mid MS Valley and Ozarks.  Several
thunderstorms clusters are ongoing within a larger corridor of
convection from the OH Valley southwestward into the lower MS
Valley.  This activity is occurring to the east/southeast of a
gradually filling cyclone forecast to move from the lower MO Valley
eastward into the southwest Great Lakes by late tonight.  

Little change was made to the previous outlook due in part to
general consistency in model guidance and observational trends noted
this morning.  Richer low-level moisture from west-central KY
southward into the Gulf Coast states will contribute to a moderate
to very unstable airmass by the early afternoon in areas void of
recent convective outflow and associated cloud debris.  Scattered to
numerous thunderstorms are forecast to develop coincident with the
diurnal heating cycle.  Forecast hodographs coupled with progged
buoyancy will support a mix of supercells and line segments this
afternoon.  The initial supercell activity will potentially yield a
threat for large to very large hail.  It appears the greatest risk
for supercell tornadoes may exist from northern MS
east-northeastward into middle TN.  Morning convection and
associated destabilization concerns preclude higher tornado risk
probabilities.  However, models continue to indicate upscale growth
into several bands will occur late this afternoon through the late
evening as storms move east across the Enhanced (level 3) Risk area.
Have enlarged severe/damaging wind probabilities across AL/GA to
account for confidence in a continuation of a wind threat persisting
through the evening.  

...IL/IN...
Within the left-exit region of a cyclonically curved mid to upper
speed max, a dry slot and attendant corridor of steep lapse rates
will likely evolve across portions of MO to IL/IN from midday into
the afternoon.  Destabilization will likely be less across the mid
MS Valley eastward into IN, with the richer moisture confined south
of residual outflow and warm frontal zone over the lower OH Valley. 
Nonetheless, isolated to scattered severe thunderstorms are possible
later today into the evening via a mix of shorter-lived supercells
and organized multicells.  Isolated to scattered coverage of severe
and all hazards are possible with the stronger storms before this
activity diminishes during the evening.

PUBLIC SEVERE WEATHER OUTLOOK  
NWS STORM PREDICTION CENTER NORMAN OK
0840 PM CDT MON MAY 19 2025

...Severe thunderstorms expected over parts of the southern Plains
into the Ozarks and mid Mississippi Valley this evening and
overnight...

* LOCATIONS...
  Western and Northern Arkansas
  Missouri
  Far Eastern Oklahoma
  North-Central and Northeast Texas
  Southern Illinois

* HAZARDS...
  Widespread damaging winds, some hurricane force
  Several tornadoes, a few intense
  Scattered large hail, some baseball size

* SUMMARY...
  A significant severe weather episode should continue tonight
  across parts of the South-Central States. Strong tornadoes,
  scattered to widespread damaging wind swaths, and very large
  hail remain possible.

Preparedness actions...

Tornadoes at night can be particularly dangerous because they 
are usually fast-moving and difficult to see. Stay tuned to
NOAA Weather Radio, weather.gov, or other media for watches and
warnings. A tornado watch means that conditions are favorable
for tornadoes to form during the next several hours. If a tornado
warning is issued for your area, move to a place of safety,
ideally in a basement or interior room on the lowest floor of a
sturdy building.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0355 AM CDT Tue May 20 2025

Valid 231200Z - 281200Z

...DISCUSSION...
Strong to severe storms are possible across the southern Plains
D4/Friday to D6/Sunday. Beyond Day 6, anomalous troughing is
forecast to develop across the Northeast with strong high pressure
building into the Plains. This would result in a southward cold
frontal surge and a lull in severe weather chances early next week. 

...Day 4/Friday to Day 6/Sunday...
Mid-level ridging will build across the Plains on D4/Friday and
D5/Saturday. Moderate to strong instability is forecast to develop
across Texas and Oklahoma as upper 60s to low 70s dewpoints advect
northward. A warm front will likely set up somewhere in the northern
Oklahoma to central Kansas vicinity as weak lee cyclogenesis occurs
near the TX/OK Panhandle. Nocturnal increases in the low-level jet
will likely result in convection north of this warm front each night
with sufficient shear and instability for some severe storms. Storm
development farther south along the dryline remains more
questionable due to the weak synoptic scale forcing. Severe weather
probabilities will likely be needed eventually across portions of
the central/southern Plains, but details remain too nebulous for 15%
probabilities at this time.

Mesoscale Discussion 0883
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0338 PM CDT Mon May 19 2025

Areas affected...parts of east central and northeastern Oklahoma

Concerning...Tornado Watch 292...

Valid 192038Z - 192245Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 292 continues.

SUMMARY...Long-lived discrete supercell development accompanied by
potential for a couple of strong tornadoes remains possible, while
spreading across the I-40 into I-44 corridors of northeastern
Oklahoma through 5-7 PM CDT.

DISCUSSION...A clustering of strong to severe storms, including a
couple of sustained tornado producing supercells continues to
develop north/northeastward, within a seasonably moist and
moderately unstable warm sector, well east of the dryline.  This has
been supported by a weak lead mid-level perturbation progressing
toward the Ozark Plateau.

The supercells are generally focused along/west of a strengthening
(40+ kt) 850 mb jet axis, and now within an area of stronger surface
pressure falls (including 2-3+ mb/2 hourly, evident in 20Z surface
observations).  As long as the supercells remain more or less
discrete, the environment remains conducive to additional tornado
development, with perhaps some increase in potential for a strong
tornado or two into early evening.

Mesoscale Discussion 0882
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0331 PM CDT Mon May 19 2025

Areas affected...Southern Iowa into northeast Missouri

Concerning...Severe potential...Severe Thunderstorm Watch likely 

Valid 192031Z - 192200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms moving out of northern Missouri will pose a
severe hail risk for parts of southern Iowa and northeast Missouri
over the next few hours. Watch issuance is expected.

DISCUSSION...Elevated convection continues to rapidly develop
northward across northern Missouri and is spreading into
south-central Iowa within a zone of strong warm air advection
between 925-850 mb. Despite being elevated in nature, MUCAPE and
effective shear downstream across IA and northeast MO remains very
favorable for organized convection (MUCAPE 1500-2000 J/kg and 45-55
knots respectively). Storm mode will likely remain a mix of
supercells and clusters, but intense updrafts will be capable of
producing severe hail, most likely between 1 to 2 inches diameter. A
severe thunderstorm watch will be needed soon to address this
threat.

Mesoscale Discussion 0881
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0312 PM CDT Mon May 19 2025

Areas affected...Southeast Nebraska to northeast Kansas

Concerning...Tornado Watch 293...294...

Valid 192012Z - 192215Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 293, 294 continues.

SUMMARY...The threat for large hail, severe wind, and tornadoes
continues across southeast Nebraska into northeast Kansas, though a
couple of localized corridors of higher tornado potential are
becoming apparent.

DISCUSSION...Convection developing along a cold front/confluence
axis across southeast NE continues to intensify, and a few cells
have begun to show signs of persistent mid-level rotation based on
KUEX velocity imagery. Additional cells continue to develop along
the boundary, so storm coverage is expected to increase over the
next 1-2 hours.  Ambient vorticity along the strongly confluent
boundary coupled with strong, organizing updrafts deepening atop the
boundary should support a tornado threat for the next few hours,
though tornado strength/longevity may be modulated by destructive
storm interactions. Regardless, a large hail threat will continue
with 1 inch hail recently reported. 

Further southeast into northeast KS, deep convection is developing
along the dryline per GOES imagery and latest lightning data.
Modifying an 18 UTC OAX sounding based on warm sector observations
suggests that sufficient buoyancy and low-level helicity is in place
to support STP values up to 2 downstream of the developing storms.
Strong cross-boundary flow should promote supercellular storm modes
with a strong tornado and very large hail threat for the next couple
of hours along the KS/NE border.

Mesoscale Discussion 0880
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0234 PM CDT Mon May 19 2025

Areas affected...Northeast Arkansas and adjacent portions of
Mississippi...Tennessee...and Missouri

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 191934Z - 192130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated convection developing across northeast
Arkansas/parts of the mid-Mississippi River Valley may sufficiently
intensify to pose a hail/wind threat through late afternoon.
Coverage of strong/severe storms should remain too limited for watch
issuance.

DISCUSSION...Over the past hour, shallow convection has percolated
across northeast AR as temperatures warm into the mid 80s amid low
to mid 70 dewpoints. Within the last 15 minutes, GOES IR imagery
shows a few deeper towers developing, suggesting that this
convection is beginning to overcome lingering MLCIN and fully
realizing the high-buoyancy environment (MLCAPE estimated between
2500-3000 J/kg). 30-40 knot flow between 5-6 km sampled by regional
VWPs is supporting bulk shear values around 30 knots, which should
be sufficient to support a few stronger/severe cells through late
afternoon. Large hail should be the primary concern with
deeper/stronger cells, though numerous storms in close proximity may
promote destructive storm interactions and/or some degree of
clustering with an more pronounced damaging wind threat. In general,
severe storm coverage should remain sufficiently limited due to weak
forcing for ascent to preclude watch issuance at this time (though a
more robust/widespread severe threat is expected to emerge later
tonight).

## SPC Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook

date: 2025-05-19, from: NOAA tornado/severe thunderstorm watches, mesoscale discussions, convective outlooks, fire weather outlooks

<br /><a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/exper/fire_wx/"><img src="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/exper/fire_wx/imgs/day38otlk_fire.gif" border="1" alt="Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook Image" hspace="1" vspace="1" width="815" height="555" align="center" /></a><pre>
Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0322 PM CDT Mon May 19 2025

Valid 211200Z - 271200Z

Mainly zonal mid-level flow through the middle of the week will give
way to upper ridging in the Plains as mid-level troughs deepen
across the western and eastern U.S. by the end of the week. By the
weekend into early next week, the western mid-level trough will
de-amplify while progressing toward the Plains. Surface high
pressure will build across the central and northern U.S. through the
week, while a surface low will encourage the northward return of
moisture across the southern Plains by the end of the week toward
the weekend. Overall quiescent fire weather conditions are expected
through most of the extended range. The largest concern for future
significant wildfire-spread potential remains across portions of the
Southwest, where prolonged warm and dry conditions will support the
continued curing of fuels. Disagreement remains among medium-range
guidance members in terms of the evolution of the de-amplifying
western upper trough by the weekend. Stronger surface winds may
develop over parts of the Southwest by the weekend, but confidence
in this scenario is too low for the introduction of Critical
probabilities at this time.

Mesoscale Discussion 0860
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0321 PM CDT Sun May 18 2025

Areas affected...much of western Oklahoma...southwest
Kansas...extreme eastern Panhandle

Concerning...Severe potential...Tornado Watch likely 

Valid 182021Z - 182215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered supercells capable of strong tornadoes and very
large hail are forecast from late afternoon into the evening from
parts of northwest Oklahoma into southwest Kansas. EF3+ tornadoes
may occur.

DISCUSSION...Surface analysis and visible imagery clearly outline
the unstable warm sector, situated between a dryline from southeast
CO into the eastern TX Panhandle, and a warm front/retreating
outflow draped across northern OK into south-central KS. The air
mass has become very unstable, and will continue to develop
northward. This air mass is coincident with an already strongly
sheared environment with effective SRH over 200 m2/s2. These
low-level shear values will increase markedly later today and during
the evening as the low level jet increases with effective SRH of
300-400 m2/s2 common.

While very cool air and clouds currently exist over northern OK into
south-central KS, a strengthening low-level jet will likely yield
clearing later in the evening, which may allow the tornado threat to
expand farther eastward.

Mesoscale Discussion 0859
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0212 PM CDT Sun May 18 2025

Areas affected...northeast Colorado...western Nebraska...northwest
Kansas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 181912Z - 182145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Supercells capable of very large hail, tornadoes, and
damaging wind are likely to develop after 21Z over northeast
Colorado, spreading into western Nebraska and northwest Kansas
through evening.

DISCUSSION...A surface low continues to deepen over eastern CO as
the shortwave trough moves across the area. Surface analysis shows a
prominent plume of low-level moisture extending out of western KS
and across northeast CO, where dewpoints are holding in the lower
50s F. 

Full heating near and south of this moisture plume will erode the
minimal capping inversion by around 21Z, and rapid thunderstorm
development is expected. The combination of strong instability,
steep lapse rates, and veering winds with height will strongly favor
supercells capable of very large hail, and a few tornadoes. Activity
should easily remain severe into NE and KS this evening as the
southeasterly low-level jet persists, maintaining moisture advection
as well as shear and inflow.

Mesoscale Discussion 0858
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0158 PM CDT Sun May 18 2025

Areas affected...Northwest to west-central Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 181858Z - 182130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm development along the dryline is expected
roughly between 20-22 UTC across northwest to west-central Texas.
The convective environment will support supercells capable of large
hail, severe gusts, and a few tornadoes. Watch issuance is likely as
storms begin to develop.

DISCUSSION...Recent GOES visible imagery shows shallow, but slowly
deepening, cumulus along and just ahead of a sharpening dryline as
it continues to mix east and boundary-layer depth increases amid
filtered diurnal heating. Latest RAP/HRRR forecast soundings suggest
any lingering MLCIN will be minimized as surface temperatures warm
into the 92-95 F range over the next few hours within the warm
sector. Regional VWPs show flow within the lowest 2-3 km AGL
oriented roughly along the dryline, which should promote adequate
residence times for parcels to reach their LFCs and initiate deep
convection. Latest high-res solutions suggest this should occur
generally between 20-22 UTC. Thunderstorms will mature within a very
unstable air mass with MLCAPE values exceeding 4000 J/kg and
effective shear on the order of 40-50 knots. Limited directional
shear will initially promote splitting supercells with an attendant
very large hail threat (most probable max hail size may be 2-3
inches in diameter). Southeasterly low-level winds across northwest
TX may support adequate low-level veering for some tornado threat.
Further south (roughly south of I-20), 1.5 to 2.5 km LCL heights and
more backed low-level flow will modulate the initial tornado
potential. After 00 UTC a strengthening low-level jet will increase
low-level hodograph curvature and support an increasing tornado
threat with any remaining discrete right-moving supercells across
much of central/northern TX. Watch issuance will likely be needed as
thunderstorm initiation becomes more imminent.

Mesoscale Discussion 0854
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0656 AM CDT Sun May 18 2025

Areas affected...central Arkansas and northern Mississippi

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 284...

Valid 181156Z - 181400Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 284
continues.

SUMMARY...Long-lived cluster of thunderstorms, with a history of
producing wind damage, continues to move through central Arkansas.
The overall environment should continue to support a severe threat
ahead of this MCS through at least mid morning.

DISCUSSION...Long-lived linear MCS, with a history of producing wind
damage, continues to move east-southeast through much of Arkansas
this morning. This MCS is moving along a west-northwest to
east-southeast CAPE gradient stretching from northeast Oklahoma into
southern Georgia and is following a similar path as to an earlier
MCS from last evening into earlier this morning. 

The overall large-scale environment will continue to support
maintenance of this MCS as the MCS has access to MUCAPE greater than
2000 J/kg and effective shear around 50 knots. The organization of
the MCS, the overall favorable environment,and knowledge that the
earlier MCS traversed a similar environment and is continuing
through Alabama supports the severe threat through the morning. A
downstream watch may become necessary for portions of far eastern
Arkansas and northern Mississippi as the MCS approaches the edge of
Severe Thunderstorm Watch #284.

Mesoscale Discussion 0853
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0640 AM CDT Sun May 18 2025

Areas affected...Central Alabama and far west-central Georgia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 181140Z - 181245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...A thunderstorm cluster moving across central Alabama will
pose a threat for isolated large hail and wind damage in the near
term. Longer term evolution of this cluster is less certain, but the
area will continue to be monitored for potential watch issuance.

DISCUSSION...Long-lived cluster of thunderstorms continues to move
across central Alabama this morning along the instability gradient.
The strongest of these thunderstorms (located across eastern
Tuscaloosa County) appears to have increased in intensity over the
last hour and has even developed a rear-inflow jet (RIJ) --
suggested by radar reflectivity structure and an increase in
rear-to-front wind speeds. This will pose a damaging wind threat in
the short term.

Additionally, overall reflectivity structure of the thunderstorm
complex suggests the development of a mesoscale convective vortex.
Should this be the case, an increase in updraft intensity would be
expected in the near term owing to increasing convergence and
stronger deep-layer shear. MUCAPE is around 1000 J/kg and deep-layer
shear around 50 knots across the thunderstorm cluster now, but drops
off to around 1000 J/kg and 30-40 knots as the cluster approaches
western Georgia.

As the thunderstorms move east, the lack of clarity of the MCV
evolution and a slightly less favorable environment results in
uncertainty as to whether a severe thunderstorm watch will be needed
downstream. Conditions will continue to be monitored for potential
watch issuance.
