Mesoscale Discussion 0973
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0348 PM CDT Sun May 25 2025

Areas affected...TX Panhandle

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 252048Z - 252315Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Convective Initiation along a frontal zone appears
increasingly likely between 4-7pm CDT (21-00z).  Large hail appears
to be the primary threat, although the risk for severe gusts will
increase during the evening.

DISCUSSION...Visible-satellite imagery shows a gradual clumping of
cumulus along a front draped from southwest to northeast across the
TX Panhandle.  A patch of cirrus over eastern NM appears associated
with the leading edge of appreciable large-scale ascent from a
Desert Southwest upper trough.  As continued heating of a
moist/destabilizing boundary layer occurs this this afternoon,
expecting additional erosion of convective inhibition along the
boundary.  Modifying the 18z Amarillo raob for lower 80s deg F
temperatures and lower 60s dewpoints, yields around 2400 J/kg MLCAPE
and minimal MLCINH (-35 J/kg).  

Models continue to vary regarding timing/coverage of storm
development within this mesoscale corridor.  However, cloud trends
and forecaster experience imply at least isolated to widely
scattered storm development over the next 3 or so hours.  Depending
on timing/coverage of developing storms, a severe thunderstorm watch
will be considered.

Mesoscale Discussion 0972
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0333 PM CDT Sun May 25 2025

Areas affected...much of Arkansas into southern Tennessee and
northern Mississippi

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 322...

Valid 252033Z - 252200Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 322
continues.

SUMMARY...The severe risk continues across much of WW322. Damaging
winds remain the primary threat though some hail with more scattered
convection is also possible.

DISCUSSION...As of 2030 UTC, regional radar imagery showed gradual
intensification of the ongoing convective cluster across
northwestern portions of WW322. Continued upscale growth of this
cluster is likely this afternoon/evening as the expanding cold pool
continues to interact with a broad warm and unstable air mass south
of the East-West stationary front. The expectation continues to be
for one or more bowing clusters to emerge from this convection, and
spread eastward with a risk for damaging winds and perhaps an
embedded tornado or two.

Additional, more scattered, convection has also developed across
much of the warm sector this afternoon. Given the robust buoyancy
(3,000 J/kg of MLCAPE), some hail and occasional damaging winds are
also possible with these storms. However, the main risk is still
expected to be the broader complex over AR/TN maturing later into
the evening. Given the gradual intensification/organization, the
severe threat will continue to increase across much of WW322.

Mesoscale Discussion 0971
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0224 PM CDT Sun May 25 2025

Areas affected...northeast NM

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 251924Z - 252130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Storm development will initially focus near the higher
terrain before moving east atop the escarpment/plains.  Large
hail/severe gusts are possible.

DISCUSSION...Visible-satellite imagery shows towering cumulus over
the Sangre de Cristos and a swelling cumulus field along the I-25
corridor in a post-frontal regime.  Surface analysis indicates
temperatures have warmed into the mid 60s to lower 70s deg F with
upper 40s to lower 50s dewpoints.  Short-term model forecast
soundings and RAP-based Objective Analysis imply 750-1500 J/kg
MLCAPE across northeast NM.  A belt of 35-40 kt southwesterly 500-mb
flow will support storm organization as storms develop/mature into
slightly richer moisture with eastward movement later this
afternoon.  A few of the stronger storms may attain supercellular
characteristics and pose a risk for large hail.  Severe gusts could
become more prevalent if/once storms cluster and congeal east of
I-25 during the early evening before low-level lapse rates lessen
with the loss of heating.

Mesoscale Discussion 0970
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0215 PM CDT Sun May 25 2025

Areas affected...Atlantic Coast portions of SC and GA into the FL
Panhandle.

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 251915Z - 252115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered thunderstorms along multiple sea-breeze
boundaries will support a risk for occasional damaging gusts or
sporadic hail this afternoon. A WW is not expected.

DISCUSSION...As of 1915 UTC, regional radar and satellite showed
scattered to numerous thunderstorms erupting along the Atlantic
Coasts of GA and SC, extending southward across much of the FL
Peninsula. Driven largely by diurnal heating and localized
confluence along typical sea-breeze boundaries, a few stronger
multicells/clusters have been noted recently. With little in the way
of upper-level forcing for ascent, convection has been largely
unorganized and is expected to remain as such. However, additional
clustering may support stronger cold pool development with time.
This could allow for occasional damaging gusts and wet microbursts
given the high PWATs (~1.8-2 inches) air mass. Sporadic hail is also
possible with the more intense updrafts given around 2000 J/kg of
MLCAPE. While occasional damaging gusts and hail are possible, the
lack of broader upper-level support suggests the severe risk will be
transient/isolated. A WW is not expected this afternoon.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0253 PM CDT Sun May 25 2025

Valid 252000Z - 261200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE SOUTHERN PLAINS AND MID-SOUTH/TENNESSEE VALLEY...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms, including the risk for very large hail, swaths
of severe winds with isolated 75+ mph gusts, and a few tornadoes,
are expected across parts of the southern Plains this afternoon and
evening, including northwest Texas and southern/central Oklahoma.
Scattered severe thunderstorms with large hail and damaging winds
will also be a concern across the Mid-South, Tennessee Valley, and
other parts of the Southeast.

...20Z Update...
Minimal changes were made to the ongoing forecast based on recent
high-resolution guidance. The prior forecast reasoning otherwise
remains valid. See the previous discussion for additional details.

..Wendt.. 05/25/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1143 AM CDT Sun May 25 2025/

...Arkansas/Mid-South to Tennessee Valley/Southeast...
A rather complex scenario exists regionally owing to yesterday's MCS
and its impacts in addition to renewed MCS development overnight
across the Ozarks. That said, air mass recovery and boundary layer
destabilization is well underway along the
west/northwest-east/southeast-oriented outflow-reinforced baroclinic
zone across the region. Multi-MCV-related enhancement to the flow
field is also evident across the Ozarks, and this should translate
downstream (east-southeasterly) toward the Mid-South and eventually
Tennessee Valley.

This scenario appears favorable for one or more well-organized
east/southeastward-moving clusters/bowing line segments to evolve
later this afternoon into evening. Damaging winds can be expected,
with occasional large hail as well. Portions of the region have been
upgraded to an Enhanced Risk for this potential.

...Southern High Plains to Oklahoma/North Texas/ArkLaTex...
A low-amplitude mid-level shortwave trough over northern Mexico this
morning will move northeastward across the southern High Plains by
this afternoon/evening. Ahead of this feature, ample daytime heating
will likely aid in the development of moderate to strong instability
by mid afternoon amid a moist low-level airmass. A surface front
will extend from eastern New Mexico across northwest Texas and the
southern Texas Panhandle into parts of western/central Oklahoma,
with a dryline extending southward from the front across west Texas.
Both of these surface boundaries will likely prove instrumental, in
combination with modest large-scale ascent associated with the
shortwave trough, to focus intense thunderstorm development later
today. While mid/upper-level winds are not expected to be overly
strong, veering and gradual strengthening with height should support
around 30-45 kt of deep-layer shear. Stronger shear is forecast near
the front. Convective temperatures will likely be reached by 20-22Z,
and explosive thunderstorm development is expected in this time
frame across west/northwest Texas along the front and dryline.

A mix of supercells and clusters will likely form and spread
east-northeastward through the late afternoon and early evening.
Very large hail (2-3 inches in diameter) will be possible with any
initial supercells given favorably steep mid-level lapse rates and
relatively long/straight hodographs at mid/upper levels. By early
evening, consolidation into a bowing complex appears likely across
northwest Texas and southern Oklahoma. An increasing threat for
scattered to numerous severe winds will exist with this cluster as
it develops generally east-southeastward ward into western north
Texas and southern Oklahoma through the evening.

Given steepened low-level lapse rates and the presence of strong to
locally extreme instability, some wind gusts of 75+ mph appear
possible with the bowing cluster. The potential for supercells to
develop separately farther east along the front in western/central
Oklahoma still remains unclear. If thunderstorms can form here, they
would likely become severe quickly, and pose a threat for very large
hail. Some risk for a few tornadoes may also exist this evening,
either embedded with the bow or with semi-discrete supercells, as a
southerly low-level jet and related 0-1 km SRH gradually
strengthens. A continued threat for severe/damaging winds may
continue into the overnight hours across north Texas.

...Eastern New Mexico...
A somewhat separate area of at least isolated supercell potential is
evident across northeast to east-central New Mexico this afternoon
in a modest low-level upslope flow regime along and north of the
front. Large hail should be the main threat with this activity. The
eastward extent of the severe threat will likely be confined by
weaker instability into the Oklahoma Panhandle and northern Texas
Panhandle.

...Colorado Front Range...
As clouds abate/thin, a relatively isolated/focused severe threat
will again exist near the foothills/urban corridor of east-central
Colorado later this afternoon.

...Florida...
Compared to the prior couple of days, mid/upper-level winds appear
somewhat weaker across the Florida Peninsula today, while mid-level
temperatures are also slightly warmer per regionally observed 12Z
soundings. Even so, another day of scattered thunderstorm
development is anticipated over much of the Florida Peninsula, with
various sea breezes acting as foci for initiation. Moderate
instability coupled with modest deep-layer shear may still support
an isolated threat for marginally severe hail and gusty winds with
the stronger cores that can develop this afternoon.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0247 PM CDT Sun May 25 2025

Valid 261200Z - 271200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Southern New Mexico and far West Texas...
Lighter winds overall are expected across the Southwest as an
upper-level trough translates eastward into the Southern/Central
Plains. Although broad a fire weather threat is not expected across
southern New Mexico and far West Texas, locally elevated fire
weather conditions are still possible in typical downslope/leeward
areas where winds of around 15 mph combined with afternoon relative
humidity of 5-15 percent and very dry fuels exist.

..Williams.. 05/25/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1214 AM CDT Sun May 25 2025/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will remain low on D2/Monday. The upper-level
trough will move into the Plains on Monday, with rising heights and
southwest flow relaxing across the Southwest. A very dry air mass
will remain in place, with afternoon relative humidity around 10-15
percent across much of Arizona and western New Mexico. Overall, the
lighter winds preclude the need for highlights on Monday.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0213 PM CDT Sun May 25 2025

Valid 271200Z - 281200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PARTS OF
SOUTHWEST TEXAS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong to locally severe storms are expected on Tuesday
from parts of the southern Plains eastward into the Southeast. The
greatest threat of large hail or wind damage will be over parts of
southwest Texas.

...Synopsis and Discussion...
An upper low will remain over the northern Plains on Tuesday, with
modest west/southwest flow aloft stretching from the southern Plains
and across the TN/OH Valleys. High pressure will remain over the
northern to central Plains, upper MS Valley and Great Lakes,
limiting northward moisture return at the surface.

A zone of moderate to strong instability will remain on Tuesday from
much of TX eastward along the Gulf Coast states, with an effective
east-west boundary pushing south each day due to multiple rounds of
storms and outflows. Scattered storms may be ongoing roughly from
northeast TX into TN Tuesday morning, with various outflows spread
southeastward across the region, aiding new daytime development.
Locally damaging gusts will be the primary concern.

Farther west, severe storms chances appear greater, as easterly
surface winds bring a moist air mass far westward into a region of
steep lapse rates. Although midlevel winds will not be strong, the
combination of deep low-level easterlies and good high level flow
may support scattered severe storms in clusters, with hail and wind
potential as instability will be strong and over 3000 J/kg MUCAPE.

Valid 261200Z - 271200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM MUCH OF
CENTRAL TEXAS INTO PARTS OF ARKANSAS AND NORTHERN LOUISIANA...

...SUMMARY...
Severe storms are expected Monday from west-central Texas eastward
into Arkansas and Louisiana. Areas of large hail will be possible
with the primary risk becoming damaging winds. Marginally severe
storms will also be possible outside the Slight Risk area from the
southern Plains into the Southeast.

...Synopsis...
Modest southwest flow aloft will persist over the southern Plains
and into the TN/OH Valleys on Monday, with embedded waves in
association with convective clusters throughout the period. 

At the surface, high pressure will remain over the northern
Plains/Great Lakes/Northeast, with a large-scale boundary roughly
from northern TX into SC. Substantial moisture will remain south of
the front, with episodes of thunderstorms producing primarily strong
to damaging gusts.

...From eastern TX into LA/MS/AL - Daytime...
Models indicate that early day convection, possibly with wind
potential, will affect much of eastern TX into southern AR and
northern LA, and move into MS during the day. Substantial moisture
and instability will remain across the region ahead of any such
system, suggesting a wind threat. If the early day storms diminish,
outflows may still serve as a focal point for afternoon development.
Additional warm sector activity may develop eastward into AL and GA
as well, where shear will be weak but CAPE sufficient for locally
severe gusts or marginal hail.

...West-central into central and southeast TX...
Strong instability will redevelop across the region in the wake of
the early activity over much of eastern TX. Cool midlevel
temperatures with -10 to -12 C at 500 mb combined with upper 60s+
dewpoints will lead to strong instability. The nose of the low-level
lapse rate plume emanating out of southwest TX will be a primary
focus for supercell development, with very large hail and perhaps a
brief tornado possible. Near or just east of the lapse rate plume
may be the composite front/outflow boundary, and a large convective
complex is forecast during the late afternoon and evening. Details
are inherently uncertain with these MCS tracks and antecedent
outflows, but in general, much of central into eastern TX should
experience strong to severe wind gusts.

...Eastern NM and CO...TX Panhandle...
Beneath the upper wave, cold temperatures aloft and daytime heating
over the high terrain will lead to an uncapped air mass along the
Front Range and extending south across most of eastern NM. Easterly
upslope flow combined with weak westerlies aloft may be sufficient
for scattered cells producing marginal hail. Clustering of storms
with aggregate outflows may stretch into the OK/TX Panhandles late,
with marginal wind and hail risk.

...Southwest...
Forecast remains on track as a mid-level trough moves through the
region, promoting surface winds of around 15 mph amid a very dry
conditions both in relative humidity (5-15 percent today) terms and
fuel dryness. Elevated highlights continue across southern Arizona
into southern/central New Mexico and far west Texas.

...Pacific Northwest...
Increasing shear/instability and mid-level moisture ahead of an
upper-level trough entering the Pacific Northwest will promote
isolated to scattered showers and thunderstorms along and east of
the Cascades late this afternoon into the overnight hours. A dry
sub-cloud layer in addition to a mid-level jet supporting fast storm
motions will limit rainfall to less than one tenth of an inch in
much of the Columbia Basin. However, fuels are not yet receptive to
widespread ignitions with ongoing green up and ERCs generally in the
60-70th percentile range.

A mid-level trough across the Southwest will continue to promote
southwesterly breezes across southern Arizona into southern/central
New Mexico this afternoon. Relative humidity reductions to around
10-15 percent will overlap sustained winds around 15 mph. An
Elevated area was maintained with this outlook across this region

0748 AM CDT Sun May 25 2025

Valid 251300Z - 261200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE SOUTHERN PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms, including the risk for very large hail, swaths
of severe winds with isolated 75+ mph gusts, and a few tornadoes,
are expected across parts of the southern Plains this afternoon and
evening. Scattered severe thunderstorms with large hail and damaging
winds will also be a concern across the lower Mississippi Valley
into the Deep South.

...Synopsis...
A weak upper trough will advance slowly eastward today across the
Southwest and southern Rockies, while upper ridging gradually
becomes more suppressed over the southern/central Plains by a
low-amplitude shortwave trough moving northeastward from northern
Mexico. A belt of enhanced mid-level flow associated with upper
troughing over the Northeast is expected to remain mostly displaced
to the north of the warm sector in place across the Ozarks into the
lower MS Valley and Southeast. At the surface, a convectively
reinforced front extending eastward from a weak surface low over the
southern High Plains will likely serve as a focus for renewed severe
thunderstorm development this afternoon and evening. The northward
advance of this front with eastward extent into the lower MS
Valley/Mid-South and TN Valley remains somewhat uncertain. But, most
guidance still shows it generally draped from northwest to southeast
across these regions by this afternoon.

...Central/Southern Plains into the Lower Mississippi Valley and
Southeast this Morning/Afternoon...
A 30-35 kt south-southwesterly low-level jet will continue to aid
mostly elevated thunderstorms across southern KS into the Ozarks
this morning. With strong deep-layer shear in place, some of this
convection may continue to pose an isolated threat for hail/wind
over the next few hours, even with greater low-level moisture and
related instability confined farther south along the
outflow-reinforced boundary. As filtered diurnal heating occurs
downstream of this morning activity, an increasingly unstable
airmass is likely to exist from parts of eastern OK into AR and the
Mid-South/lower MS Valley, along and south of the front. Various
NAM/RAP forecast soundings across this region suggest that stronger
deep-layer shear will tend to remain to the north of the surface
boundary. Still, there will likely be sufficient shear to foster
some updraft organization, with both clusters and embedded supercell
structures possible.

One or more well organized clusters/bowing line segments may
eventually develop across the lower MS Valley/Mid-South vicinity
this afternoon/evening, possibly related to the ongoing convection
this morning across south-central KS and northeast OK/northwest AR.
Regardless of its origin, the overall environment should support at
least scattered severe/damaging winds and occasional large hail as
these thunderstorms spread east-southeastward through the afternoon
and early evening. Consideration was given to including higher wind
probabilities across part of this region, but confidence was not
high enough in a more concentrated corridor of severe wind gusts to
do so at this time. Severe probabilities have been expanded
southward across the lower MS Valley to account for one or more
thunderstorm clusters with associated damaging wind threat spreading
southeastward this evening into the early overnight hours, before
eventually weakening.

...Southern High Plains into the ArkLaTex this Afternoon through
Tonight...
A low-amplitude mid-level shortwave trough over northern Mexico this
morning will move northeastward across the southern High Plains by
this afternoon/evening. Ahead of this feature, ample daytime heating
will likely aid in the development of moderate to strong instability
by mid afternoon amid a moist low-level airmass. A surface front
will extend from eastern NM across northwest TX and the TX Panhandle
into parts of western/central OK, with a dryline extending southward
from the front across west TX. Both of these surface boundaries will
likely prove instrumental, in combination with modest large-scale
ascent associated with the shortwave trough, to focus intense
thunderstorm development later today. While mid/upper-level winds
are not expected to be overly strong, veering and gradual
strengthening with height should support around 30-45 kt of
deep-layer shear. Stronger shear is forecast near the front.
Convective temperatures will likely be reached by 20-22Z, and
explosive thunderstorm development is expected in this time frame
across west/northwest TX along the front and dryline.

A mix of supercells and clusters will likely form and spread
east-northeastward across the southern High Plains through the late
afternoon and early evening. Very large hail (2-3 inches in
diameter) will be possible with any initial supercells given
favorably steep mid-level lapse rates and relatively long/straight
hodographs at mid/upper levels. By early evening, consolidation into
a bowing complex appears likely across northwest TX and vicinity. An
increasing threat for scattered to numerous severe winds will exist
with this cluster as it develops generally eastward into western
north TX and southwest OK through the evening. Given steepened
low-level lapse rates and the presence of strong to locally extreme
instability, some wind gusts of 75+ mph appear possible with the
bowing cluster. The potential for supercells to develop separately
farther east along the front in western/central OK remains unclear.
If thunderstorms can form here, they would likely become severe
quickly, and pose a threat for very large hail. Some risk for a few
tornadoes may also exist this evening (either embedded with the bow
or with semi-discrete supercells) as a southerly low-level jet and
related 0-1 km SRH gradually strengthens. A continued threat for
severe/damaging winds may continue into the early overnight hours
across parts of OK and north/central TX. Severe probabilities have
been expanded southward some to account for latest guidance trends
showing the potential for the bow to persist with some intensity
farther south/east in TX.

A somewhat separate area of at least isolated supercell potential is
also evident across northeast to east-central NM this afternoon in a
modest low-level upslope flow regime along and north of the front.
Large hail should be the main threat with this activity. The
eastward extent of the severe threat will likely be confined by
weaker instability into the OK Panhandle and northern TX Panhandle.

...Florida...
Compared to the prior couple of days, mid/upper-level winds appear
somewhat weaker across the FL Peninsula today. Mid-level
temperatures are also slightly warmer per area 12Z soundings. Even
so, another day of scattered thunderstorm development is anticipated
over much of the FL Peninsula, with various sea breezes acting as
foci for initiation. Moderate instability coupled with modest
deep-layer shear may still support an isolated threat for marginally
severe hail and gusty winds with the stronger cores that can develop
this afternoon.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 321
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1145 PM CDT Sat May 24 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Far Northwest Arkansas
  Southern Kansas
  Far Southwest Missouri
  Northern Oklahoma

* Effective this Saturday night and Sunday morning from 1145 PM
  until 700 AM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
    inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm coverage is expected to increase tonight
across northern OK into southern KS and adjacent portions of far
northwest AR and far southwest MO. Steep mid-level lapse rates and
strong vertical shear will support the potential for large hail.
Isolated damaging gusts are also possible, particularly across
southwestern KS where a potential bowing segment may move into the
region from the northwest.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 55
statute miles north and south of a line from 20 miles west southwest
of Garden City KS to 30 miles east of Grove OK. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU1).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 319...WW 320...

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
24035.

## SPC May 25, 2025 Day 4-8 Severe Weather Outlook

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0353 AM CDT Sun May 25 2025

Valid 281200Z - 021200Z

...DISCUSSION...
...Wednesday/Day 4 and Thursday/Day 5...
A mid-level low is forecast to move eastward into the upper
Mississippi Valley on Wednesday, as a cold front advances
southeastward across the southern and eastern U.S. Thunderstorm
development is expected to take place along and near the front
during the day as surface temperatures warm. An isolated severe
threat will be possible Wednesday afternoon and evening, mainly
across parts of the Southeast and southern Plains, where some areas
could moderately destabilize. Mid-level flow is forecast to be
somewhat weak, should could marginalize the severe threat in most
areas.

On Thursday, the mid-level low is forecast to move eastward across
the Great Lakes, as the previously mentioned front moves slowly
southeastward. The tail end of the front is forecast to be in the
southern Plains, where scattered thunderstorms should develop
Thursday afternoon. Over the southern Plains, northwest mid-level
flow is forecast to create enough deep-layer shear for isolated
severe storms. However, predictability is too low to delineate any
areas with a potentially greater risk.

...Friday/Day 6 to Sunday/Day 8...
From Friday to Sunday, a mid-level trough in the lower Great Lakes
is forecast to move into the western Atlantic, as another trough
develops in its wake, over the eastern U.S. Behind this trough,
northwest mid-level flow will remain in place across much of the
central and eastern U.S. In response, a relatively dry airmass is
forecast remain in place across much of the central and eastern U.S.
For this reason, the potential for strong thunderstorm development
is expected to remain isolated in most areas over the weekend.

Mesoscale Discussion 0956
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0357 PM CDT Sat May 24 2025

Areas affected...Western and Central Oklahoma

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 242057Z - 242330Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Severe thunderstorms capable of all hazards are
anticipated this evening across western and central Oklahoma,
particularly along a slow moving/stationary effective warm
front/outflow boundary. WW issuance will probably be needed late
this afternoon/evening, though currently there remains uncertainty
on when convective initiation will occur.

DISCUSSION...Heating in southwestern Oklahoma has driven surface
temperatures into the low to mid 90s F, which is at or near the
estimated convective temperature on the 19Z OUN sounding. Visible
satellite trends show an increase in coverage and depth of boundary
layer cumulus, though no true attempts at convective initiation have
been noted at this time. Still, an extremely unstable airmass
characterized by 3500+ J/kg MLCAPE and 45-50 kts of deep-layer
effective bulk shear will support supercell development and
maintenance. Supercells will be capable of all hazards, including
tornadoes, damaging winds, and hail in excess of 2.00 inches. The
greatest risk corridor lies along a warm front/convective outflow
boundary oriented northwest to southeast across western and central
Oklahoma, where easterly flow along and north of the boundary will
result in an enhancement of the low-level hodograph. While there is
uncertainty in the timing of convective initiation, watch issuance
may be needed later this afternoon or evening.

Mesoscale Discussion 0955

0331 PM CDT Sat May 24 2025

Areas affected...central MS and far northeast LA

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 317...

Valid 242031Z - 242200Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 317
continues.

SUMMARY...A squall line will continue eastward with a risk for
damaging gusts and isolated hail this afternoon/evening.

DISCUSSION...Across WW317, gradual intensification of the prior line
of storms has been noted this afternoon. The environment remains
favorable for a continued severe risk with moderate to large
buoyancy and 30-40 kt of effective shear. This suggests the severe
threat will continue eastward with a primary risk for damaging
gusts. This is well corroborated by recent reports of damaging gusts
across MS and LA. Some isolated hail may also be possible,
especially with storms developing ahead of the line along the
baroclinic zone. Given the broadly favorable environment and
organized line, the severe risk will continue across much of WW317
into this evening.

Mesoscale Discussion 0954
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0221 PM CDT Sat May 24 2025

Areas affected...parts of south Florida

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 241921Z - 242115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated damaging gusts and hail are possible with
scattered storms this afternoon. A WW is not expected.

DISCUSSION...Across parts of south FL, strong diurnal heating atop
seasonably deep moisture has eroded any remaining morning
inhibition. Scattered thunderstorms have initiated along the typical
diurnal sea breeze boundaries and should continue to do so through
this afternoon. Despite weak background ascent, 2500 J/kg of MLCAPE
from the MFL sounding suggests a few robust updrafts will develop. A
few of these stronger storms may eventually result in one or more
clusters as outflow gradually consolidates. Modest deep-layer shear
should support some updraft organization, and isolated hail/wind
gusts appear possible with any of the stronger cores that sustain.
Given the lack of broader forcing and relatively limited shear, a
broader severe risk worthy of a WW appears unlikely at this time.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 315
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
230 AM CDT Sat May 24 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Far Western Arkansas
  Central and Eastern Oklahoma

* Effective this Saturday morning from 230 AM until 1000 AM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  Isolated very large hail events to 2 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Mainly elevated supercells should continue to pose a
threat for isolated severe hail this morning. A cluster of
thunderstorms in south-central Kansas should spread southeastward
across parts of central and eastern OK over the next several hours.
This activity may pose some threat for scattered severe/damaging
winds, with peak gusts potentially reaching up to 60-70 mph.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 115
statute miles east and west of a line from 20 miles northeast of
Ponca City OK to 30 miles south southwest of Mcalester OK. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU5).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 314...

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
31035.

Mesoscale Discussion 0941
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0249 PM CDT Fri May 23 2025

Areas affected...The Trans-Pecos and Stockton Plateau of West Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 231949Z - 232145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A few severe wind gusts and marginally severe hail stones
will be possible across portions of the Trans-Pecos and Stockton
Plateau through late this afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Convective temperatures have easily been reached under
a mid-level ridge axis this afternoon along and ahead of a dryline
beginning to mix eastward into portions of West TX. Visible
satellite and radar imagery both indicate moist convection is
deepening east of the Davis Mountains, where a well mixed boundary
layer is in place. An unstable air mass should continue to result in
isolated to widely scattered thunderstorm development through the
afternoon. The main concern with this activity will be severe wind
gusts given large dewpoint-temperature spreads/inverted V profiles,
and downdraft CAPE ~2000 J/kg. This may especially be true by late
this afternoon if storm mergers occur. Severe hail also cannot be
ruled out with steep mid level lapse rates in place and a slight
increase in mid to upper-level flow anticipated over the next couple
of hours. However, the threat of severe hail may be mitigated by
high freezing levels and a lack of significant organization due to
limiting deep layer effective shear. A weather watch is not expected
at this time.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0153 PM CDT Fri May 23 2025

Areas affected...parts of southeastern Wyoming...southwestern
Nebraska...northeastern Colorado...northwestern Kansas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 231853Z - 232130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered thunderstorm activity will begin to initiate to
the east of the Front Range during the next few hours, particularly
to the east/southeast of Cheyenne, with a couple of intensifying
supercells  posing increasing potential for severe weather by late
afternoon. Trends are being monitored for a watch.

DISCUSSION...Stronger boundary-layer destabilization the past few
hours has been focused to the lee of the Front Range, in a corridor
from southeastern Wyoming through northeastern Colorado. 
Mixed-layer CAPE now appears to be increasing in excess of 1000-1500
J/kg, and notable 2-hourly surface pressure falls on the order of
2-3 mb have recently been observed across the Akron CO through
Cheyenne WY vicinity.

Deepening convective development is ongoing across the higher
terrain, particularly in a narrow plume near the Colorado/Wyoming
state border to the west of Cheyenne.  As inhibition continues to
weaken with further insolation, perhaps aided by a subtle mid-level
perturbation developing to the east of the Front Range, thunderstorm
initiation appears increasingly probable through 20-22Z.

Both HREF and NCEP SREF indicate highest calibrated thunderstorm
probabilities initially focused along the southern slopes of the
Cheyenne Ridge (supported by current trends), before increasing
southeastward across northeast Colorado toward northwest Kansas.

Beneath modest (but strongly sheared) westerly deep-layer mean flow,
 a couple of supercells are likely to evolve while slowly
propagating eastward/southeastward into/across the high plains.  As
this occurs, it appears that thermodynamic profiles will become
increasingly conducive to large hail, locally damaging wind gusts,
and perhaps some risk for a brief/weak tornado.

Areas affected...parts of the Texas South Plains

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 221924Z - 222130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated strong to severe thunderstorm development,
perhaps including an evolving supercell or two, appears possible
through 3-5 PM CDT, accompanied by a risk for large hail and locally
damaging wind gusts.

DISCUSSION...Daytime heating and deep-boundary layer mixing focused
along the dryline across the Texas South Plains is contributing to
weakening inhibition as far north as a diffuse surface front
extending near/south of Childress toward the Lubbock vicinity.  This
is coinciding with deepening convective development, which seems
likely to persist, particularly where low-level convergence is
strongest near the boundary intersection.

Although beneath more modest northwesterly mid-level flow/deep-layer
shear than closer to the Red River, as updrafts acquire increasing
inflow of air characterized by mixed-layer CAPE as high as 2000-3000
J/kg, isolated supercell development posing a risk for large hail
and damaging wind gusts appear possible.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 312
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
305 PM CDT Thu May 22 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Southwest and South-Central Oklahoma
  Western and North Texas

* Effective this Thursday afternoon and evening from 305 PM until
  1000 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail likely with isolated very large hail events
    to 3 inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Severe storms including supercells are expected to
steadily develop through late afternoon, including across western
north Texas and southwest Oklahoma near a boundary from prior
storms, and also across the Texas South Plains. Storms may
eventually merge/cluster across parts of the Low Rolling Plains and
western North Texas. Potentially very large hail and severe-caliber
wind gusts are the primary hazards.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 80
statute miles north and south of a line from 65 miles east of
Wichita Falls TX to 55 miles north of Big Spring TX. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU2).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 311...

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
3 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 550. Mean storm motion vector
29025.

Mesoscale Discussion 0923
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0155 PM CDT Wed May 21 2025

Areas affected...parts of south central Nebraska into north central
Kansas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 211855Z - 212130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A consolidating area of southeastward developing
thunderstorm activity may be accompanied by increasing strong to
severe wind gusts by 4-6 PM CDT.  It is not clear that a severe
weather watch is needed, but trends will be monitored.

DISCUSSION...Beneath seasonably cold (temperatures around/below -20
C at 500 mb) and strong (40-50 kt at 500 mb) west-northwesterly
mid-level flow, low-level lapse rates are becoming quite steep, with
sufficient boundary-layer moisture to support weak CAPE and
scattered developing thunderstorm activity across parts of south
central Nebraska and northeastern Colorado into northwestern Kansas.
 It appears that convection will continue to gradually increase and
modestly intensify with further destabilization through late
afternoon.  

Aided by large-scale forcing for ascent associated with a
southeastward developing area of lower/mid-tropospheric warm
advection, various model output suggests that convection may
gradually grow upscale into a cluster across the central
Nebraska/Kansas border vicinity through 21-23Z.  Coinciding with
peak daytime heating, and deep boundary-layer mixing (including
surface temperature/dew point spreads around 35-40F), strong
downdrafts, enhanced by evaporative cooling and downward mixing of
momentum, may contribute to a few locally severe surface gusts. 
Gradually, consolidating outflow may yield an expanding area of
strong to, perhaps, severe gusts, before convection wanes this
evening.

Mesoscale Discussion 0908
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0333 PM CDT Tue May 20 2025

Areas affected...Eastern Arkansas to the Tennessee River Valley

Concerning...Tornado Watch 303...305...

Valid 202033Z - 202230Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 303, 305 continues.

SUMMARY...The threat for large hail and tornadoes continues across
watches 303 and 305, though the potential for widespread damaging
winds is expected to increase over the next 2-3 hours across for
parts of northwest TN and far southwest KY. The greatest
hail/tornado threat will likely be focused across southeast AR into
northeast MS and parts of middle TN.

DISCUSSION...Numerous supercells continue to mature across eastern
AR with more isolated to scattered coverage across northern MS into
western/middle TN. Convective coverage/close storm proximity has
resulted in destructive interactions of the past hour across
northeast AR, and recent velocity imagery from KNQA shows signs of
consolidating outflow across northeast AR. This suggests that the
early stages of upscale growth is occurring and may promote an
increasing damaging/severe wind threat downstream into parts of
western TN and west/southwest KY. Strong low-level shear sampled by
the KQNA VWP hints that even with this storm mode transition,
embedded circulations will be possible as the line becomes more
organized. 

Further east and south, more isolated to scattered storm coverage
has yielded more discrete supercells. Large hail up to golf ball
size has already been reported, and with a very buoyant and strongly
sheared environment still in place downstream, very large hail will
remain a concern for far southeast AR, northern MS, and parts of
middle TN. Recent WoFS guidance suggests hail sizes between 2 to 2.5
inches will be possible with these cells over the next couple of
hours. These discrete storms are beginning to display organized
mesocyclones and will continue to migrate across a warm sector with
STP values between 2-3, suggesting that the tornado threat
(including the potential for a strong tornado) is likely increasing
with these cells.

Mesoscale Discussion 0907
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0242 PM CDT Tue May 20 2025

Areas affected...parts of ern Kentucky...ern
Tennessee...southwestern Virginia and southwestern West Virginia

Concerning...Tornado Watch 302...

Valid 201942Z - 202145Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 302 continues.

SUMMARY...The line of storms overspreading the region could still
intensify and organize further during the next couple of hours,
accompanied by increasing potential for strong to severe surface
gusts, and perhaps a tornado.

DISCUSSION...The narrow linear convective system has maintained
generally modest intensity as it continues to advance into/across
the Cumberland and southern Allegheny Plateau vicinity.  Due to the
strength of the upper flow/shear, there has been little in the way
of trailing anvil precipitation develop, and the elongated
convectively generated surface cold pool remains modest to weak in
strength.  However, in the presence of strong deep-layer shear,
objective analysis indicates the potential for continuing updraft
inflow of moist boundary-layer air, characterized by CAPE of
500-1000 J/kg, into the crest of the higher terrain.  This could
still promote further intensification and organization during the
next few hours.  

Where it is intersected by the line of storms, the quasi-stationary
to warm frontal zone, north of Jackson KY toward the Charleston WV
area, may still provide one possible focus for an evolving meso-beta
scale cyclonic circulation, with increasing potential for damaging
wind gusts and/or a tornado.

PUBLIC SEVERE WEATHER OUTLOOK  
NWS STORM PREDICTION CENTER NORMAN OK
0840 PM CDT MON MAY 19 2025

...Severe thunderstorms expected over parts of the southern Plains
into the Ozarks and mid Mississippi Valley this evening and
overnight...

* LOCATIONS...
  Western and Northern Arkansas
  Missouri
  Far Eastern Oklahoma
  North-Central and Northeast Texas
  Southern Illinois

* HAZARDS...
  Widespread damaging winds, some hurricane force
  Several tornadoes, a few intense
  Scattered large hail, some baseball size

* SUMMARY...
  A significant severe weather episode should continue tonight
  across parts of the South-Central States. Strong tornadoes,
  scattered to widespread damaging wind swaths, and very large
  hail remain possible.

Preparedness actions...

Tornadoes at night can be particularly dangerous because they 
are usually fast-moving and difficult to see. Stay tuned to
NOAA Weather Radio, weather.gov, or other media for watches and
warnings. A tornado watch means that conditions are favorable
for tornadoes to form during the next several hours. If a tornado
warning is issued for your area, move to a place of safety,
ideally in a basement or interior room on the lowest floor of a
sturdy building.

Mesoscale Discussion 0883
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0338 PM CDT Mon May 19 2025

Areas affected...parts of east central and northeastern Oklahoma

Concerning...Tornado Watch 292...

Valid 192038Z - 192245Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 292 continues.

SUMMARY...Long-lived discrete supercell development accompanied by
potential for a couple of strong tornadoes remains possible, while
spreading across the I-40 into I-44 corridors of northeastern
Oklahoma through 5-7 PM CDT.

DISCUSSION...A clustering of strong to severe storms, including a
couple of sustained tornado producing supercells continues to
develop north/northeastward, within a seasonably moist and
moderately unstable warm sector, well east of the dryline.  This has
been supported by a weak lead mid-level perturbation progressing
toward the Ozark Plateau.

The supercells are generally focused along/west of a strengthening
(40+ kt) 850 mb jet axis, and now within an area of stronger surface
pressure falls (including 2-3+ mb/2 hourly, evident in 20Z surface
observations).  As long as the supercells remain more or less
discrete, the environment remains conducive to additional tornado
development, with perhaps some increase in potential for a strong
tornado or two into early evening.

Mesoscale Discussion 0882
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0331 PM CDT Mon May 19 2025

Areas affected...Southern Iowa into northeast Missouri

Concerning...Severe potential...Severe Thunderstorm Watch likely 

Valid 192031Z - 192200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms moving out of northern Missouri will pose a
severe hail risk for parts of southern Iowa and northeast Missouri
over the next few hours. Watch issuance is expected.

DISCUSSION...Elevated convection continues to rapidly develop
northward across northern Missouri and is spreading into
south-central Iowa within a zone of strong warm air advection
between 925-850 mb. Despite being elevated in nature, MUCAPE and
effective shear downstream across IA and northeast MO remains very
favorable for organized convection (MUCAPE 1500-2000 J/kg and 45-55
knots respectively). Storm mode will likely remain a mix of
supercells and clusters, but intense updrafts will be capable of
producing severe hail, most likely between 1 to 2 inches diameter. A
severe thunderstorm watch will be needed soon to address this
threat.

Mesoscale Discussion 0881
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0312 PM CDT Mon May 19 2025

Areas affected...Southeast Nebraska to northeast Kansas

Concerning...Tornado Watch 293...294...

Valid 192012Z - 192215Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 293, 294 continues.

SUMMARY...The threat for large hail, severe wind, and tornadoes
continues across southeast Nebraska into northeast Kansas, though a
couple of localized corridors of higher tornado potential are
becoming apparent.

DISCUSSION...Convection developing along a cold front/confluence
axis across southeast NE continues to intensify, and a few cells
have begun to show signs of persistent mid-level rotation based on
KUEX velocity imagery. Additional cells continue to develop along
the boundary, so storm coverage is expected to increase over the
next 1-2 hours.  Ambient vorticity along the strongly confluent
boundary coupled with strong, organizing updrafts deepening atop the
boundary should support a tornado threat for the next few hours,
though tornado strength/longevity may be modulated by destructive
storm interactions. Regardless, a large hail threat will continue
with 1 inch hail recently reported. 

Further southeast into northeast KS, deep convection is developing
along the dryline per GOES imagery and latest lightning data.
Modifying an 18 UTC OAX sounding based on warm sector observations
suggests that sufficient buoyancy and low-level helicity is in place
to support STP values up to 2 downstream of the developing storms.
Strong cross-boundary flow should promote supercellular storm modes
with a strong tornado and very large hail threat for the next couple
of hours along the KS/NE border.

Mesoscale Discussion 0880
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0234 PM CDT Mon May 19 2025

Areas affected...Northeast Arkansas and adjacent portions of
Mississippi...Tennessee...and Missouri

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 191934Z - 192130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated convection developing across northeast
Arkansas/parts of the mid-Mississippi River Valley may sufficiently
intensify to pose a hail/wind threat through late afternoon.
Coverage of strong/severe storms should remain too limited for watch
issuance.

DISCUSSION...Over the past hour, shallow convection has percolated
across northeast AR as temperatures warm into the mid 80s amid low
to mid 70 dewpoints. Within the last 15 minutes, GOES IR imagery
shows a few deeper towers developing, suggesting that this
convection is beginning to overcome lingering MLCIN and fully
realizing the high-buoyancy environment (MLCAPE estimated between
2500-3000 J/kg). 30-40 knot flow between 5-6 km sampled by regional
VWPs is supporting bulk shear values around 30 knots, which should
be sufficient to support a few stronger/severe cells through late
afternoon. Large hail should be the primary concern with
deeper/stronger cells, though numerous storms in close proximity may
promote destructive storm interactions and/or some degree of
clustering with an more pronounced damaging wind threat. In general,
severe storm coverage should remain sufficiently limited due to weak
forcing for ascent to preclude watch issuance at this time (though a
more robust/widespread severe threat is expected to emerge later
tonight).

## SPC Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0322 PM CDT Mon May 19 2025

Valid 211200Z - 271200Z

Mainly zonal mid-level flow through the middle of the week will give
way to upper ridging in the Plains as mid-level troughs deepen
across the western and eastern U.S. by the end of the week. By the
weekend into early next week, the western mid-level trough will
de-amplify while progressing toward the Plains. Surface high
pressure will build across the central and northern U.S. through the
week, while a surface low will encourage the northward return of
moisture across the southern Plains by the end of the week toward
the weekend. Overall quiescent fire weather conditions are expected
through most of the extended range. The largest concern for future
significant wildfire-spread potential remains across portions of the
Southwest, where prolonged warm and dry conditions will support the
continued curing of fuels. Disagreement remains among medium-range
guidance members in terms of the evolution of the de-amplifying
western upper trough by the weekend. Stronger surface winds may
develop over parts of the Southwest by the weekend, but confidence
in this scenario is too low for the introduction of Critical
probabilities at this time.

Mesoscale Discussion 0860
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0321 PM CDT Sun May 18 2025

Areas affected...much of western Oklahoma...southwest
Kansas...extreme eastern Panhandle

Concerning...Severe potential...Tornado Watch likely 

Valid 182021Z - 182215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered supercells capable of strong tornadoes and very
large hail are forecast from late afternoon into the evening from
parts of northwest Oklahoma into southwest Kansas. EF3+ tornadoes
may occur.

DISCUSSION...Surface analysis and visible imagery clearly outline
the unstable warm sector, situated between a dryline from southeast
CO into the eastern TX Panhandle, and a warm front/retreating
outflow draped across northern OK into south-central KS. The air
mass has become very unstable, and will continue to develop
northward. This air mass is coincident with an already strongly
sheared environment with effective SRH over 200 m2/s2. These
low-level shear values will increase markedly later today and during
the evening as the low level jet increases with effective SRH of
300-400 m2/s2 common.

While very cool air and clouds currently exist over northern OK into
south-central KS, a strengthening low-level jet will likely yield
clearing later in the evening, which may allow the tornado threat to
expand farther eastward.

Mesoscale Discussion 0859

0212 PM CDT Sun May 18 2025

Areas affected...northeast Colorado...western Nebraska...northwest
Kansas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 181912Z - 182145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Supercells capable of very large hail, tornadoes, and
damaging wind are likely to develop after 21Z over northeast
Colorado, spreading into western Nebraska and northwest Kansas
through evening.

DISCUSSION...A surface low continues to deepen over eastern CO as
the shortwave trough moves across the area. Surface analysis shows a
prominent plume of low-level moisture extending out of western KS
and across northeast CO, where dewpoints are holding in the lower
50s F. 

Full heating near and south of this moisture plume will erode the
minimal capping inversion by around 21Z, and rapid thunderstorm
development is expected. The combination of strong instability,
steep lapse rates, and veering winds with height will strongly favor
supercells capable of very large hail, and a few tornadoes. Activity
should easily remain severe into NE and KS this evening as the
southeasterly low-level jet persists, maintaining moisture advection
as well as shear and inflow.

Mesoscale Discussion 0858
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0158 PM CDT Sun May 18 2025

Areas affected...Northwest to west-central Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 181858Z - 182130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm development along the dryline is expected
roughly between 20-22 UTC across northwest to west-central Texas.
The convective environment will support supercells capable of large
hail, severe gusts, and a few tornadoes. Watch issuance is likely as
storms begin to develop.

DISCUSSION...Recent GOES visible imagery shows shallow, but slowly
deepening, cumulus along and just ahead of a sharpening dryline as
it continues to mix east and boundary-layer depth increases amid
filtered diurnal heating. Latest RAP/HRRR forecast soundings suggest
any lingering MLCIN will be minimized as surface temperatures warm
into the 92-95 F range over the next few hours within the warm
sector. Regional VWPs show flow within the lowest 2-3 km AGL
oriented roughly along the dryline, which should promote adequate
residence times for parcels to reach their LFCs and initiate deep
convection. Latest high-res solutions suggest this should occur
generally between 20-22 UTC. Thunderstorms will mature within a very
unstable air mass with MLCAPE values exceeding 4000 J/kg and
effective shear on the order of 40-50 knots. Limited directional
shear will initially promote splitting supercells with an attendant
very large hail threat (most probable max hail size may be 2-3
inches in diameter). Southeasterly low-level winds across northwest
TX may support adequate low-level veering for some tornado threat.
Further south (roughly south of I-20), 1.5 to 2.5 km LCL heights and
more backed low-level flow will modulate the initial tornado
potential. After 00 UTC a strengthening low-level jet will increase
low-level hodograph curvature and support an increasing tornado
threat with any remaining discrete right-moving supercells across
much of central/northern TX. Watch issuance will likely be needed as
thunderstorm initiation becomes more imminent.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 286
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
200 PM MDT Sun May 18 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Northeast Colorado
  Northwest Kansas
  Southwest Nebraska

* Effective this Sunday afternoon and evening from 200 PM until
  800 PM MDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A few tornadoes likely with a couple intense tornadoes possible
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 3
    inches in diameter likely
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Supercell thunderstorms will rapidly intensify this
afternoon across the watch area in an increasingly moist and
unstable air mass.  Very large hail and tornadoes are possible with
the strongest storms.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 80 statute miles
east and west of a line from 50 miles north northeast of Sidney NE
to 60 miles southwest of Hill City KS. For a complete depiction of
the watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS
WOU6).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 3 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 60 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean
storm motion vector 23030.

Mesoscale Discussion 0854
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0656 AM CDT Sun May 18 2025

Areas affected...central Arkansas and northern Mississippi

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 284...

Valid 181156Z - 181400Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 284
continues.

SUMMARY...Long-lived cluster of thunderstorms, with a history of
producing wind damage, continues to move through central Arkansas.
The overall environment should continue to support a severe threat
ahead of this MCS through at least mid morning.

DISCUSSION...Long-lived linear MCS, with a history of producing wind
damage, continues to move east-southeast through much of Arkansas
this morning. This MCS is moving along a west-northwest to
east-southeast CAPE gradient stretching from northeast Oklahoma into
southern Georgia and is following a similar path as to an earlier
MCS from last evening into earlier this morning. 

The overall large-scale environment will continue to support
maintenance of this MCS as the MCS has access to MUCAPE greater than
2000 J/kg and effective shear around 50 knots. The organization of
the MCS, the overall favorable environment,and knowledge that the
earlier MCS traversed a similar environment and is continuing
through Alabama supports the severe threat through the morning. A
downstream watch may become necessary for portions of far eastern
Arkansas and northern Mississippi as the MCS approaches the edge of
Severe Thunderstorm Watch #284.

Mesoscale Discussion 0853
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0640 AM CDT Sun May 18 2025

Areas affected...Central Alabama and far west-central Georgia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 181140Z - 181245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...A thunderstorm cluster moving across central Alabama will
pose a threat for isolated large hail and wind damage in the near
term. Longer term evolution of this cluster is less certain, but the
area will continue to be monitored for potential watch issuance.

DISCUSSION...Long-lived cluster of thunderstorms continues to move
across central Alabama this morning along the instability gradient.
The strongest of these thunderstorms (located across eastern
Tuscaloosa County) appears to have increased in intensity over the
last hour and has even developed a rear-inflow jet (RIJ) --
suggested by radar reflectivity structure and an increase in
rear-to-front wind speeds. This will pose a damaging wind threat in
the short term.

Additionally, overall reflectivity structure of the thunderstorm
complex suggests the development of a mesoscale convective vortex.
Should this be the case, an increase in updraft intensity would be
expected in the near term owing to increasing convergence and
stronger deep-layer shear. MUCAPE is around 1000 J/kg and deep-layer
shear around 50 knots across the thunderstorm cluster now, but drops
off to around 1000 J/kg and 30-40 knots as the cluster approaches
western Georgia.

As the thunderstorms move east, the lack of clarity of the MCV
evolution and a slightly less favorable environment results in
uncertainty as to whether a severe thunderstorm watch will be needed
downstream. Conditions will continue to be monitored for potential
watch issuance.
