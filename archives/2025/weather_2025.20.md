Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0751 AM CDT Mon May 19 2025

Valid 191300Z - 201200Z

...THERE IS A MODERATE RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FAR NORTH
TEXAS...MUCH OF CENTRAL AND EASTERN OKLAHOMA...SOUTHEAST
KANSAS...AND THE OZARKS...

...SUMMARY...
Significant severe weather is likely from the central/southern
Plains into the the Ozarks today into tonight. All severe weather
hazards are expected, to include tornadoes (some potentially strong
to intense), very large hail, and severe winds.

... Synopsis ...

A large, amplified trough over the Rockies will shift slowly
eastward into the Plains today. Embedded within this longwave
trough, a complex evolution is expected. Downstream of the trough, a
negatively tilted shortwave trough will deepen and close off across
the northern Plains. Meanwhile, upstream, a closed low currently
over Idaho will dig southeastward, open up, and eject into the
central Plains.

As this evolution occurs, strong midlevel flow (in excess of 50
knots) will remain across much of the central and southern Plains
through the forecast period. By late in the afternoon, midlevel flow
will strengthen to perhaps 70 knots in response to the ejecting low
into the central Plains.

At the surface, the main synoptic low will be somewhat
diffuse/elongated over northwest Kansas into southwest Nebraska this
morning. Extending southward from this low, a dryline will stretch
through western Kansas into the Oklahoma and Texas Panhandles,
continuing into west Texas. A warm front will extend eastward near
the Kansas-Nebraska border before curving southeastward into
Missouri into the southern Appalachians. 

The surface low is expected to gradually fill today as it slowly
moves east/northeast into south-central Nebraska, Despite this, rich
Gulf moisture will be maintained across the central and southern
Plains. Dewpoint temperatures at or above 70F will advect northward
from Texas through Oklahoma perhaps to as far north as northeast
Kansas. 

During the afternoon, strong diurnal heating along the dryline may
result in a sub-synoptic low developing across northwest Oklahoma.
This low will slowly progress east along the Oklahoma-Kansas border
during the afternoon, weakening with time.

... Southern and Central Plains into the Ozarks ...

A strongly sheared atmosphere will already be in place at the start
of the forecast period. As diurnal heating commences and 70F
dewpoints advect northward, the atmosphere across much of the
central and southern Plains will become strongly to extremely
unstable as well, with surface-based CAPE values between 3000-5000
J/kg across the region.

Multiple rounds of storms are expected across the region today. One
such initiating mechanism looks to be a subtle shortwave trough
embedded in the larger scale flow currently across eastern New
Mexico. This wave should initiate thunderstorms across eastern
Oklahoma northward into eastern Kansas by midday. It is unclear if
these storms will initially be elevated, but as they move east and
the atmosphere destabilizes further ahead of the line, a transition
to more surface-based convection should occur. At the same time, the
low-level jet is forecast to strengthen/reorganize across eastern
Oklahoma/western Arkansas into western Missouri. This will yield
ample low-level curvature to the hodograph. Thus, given the strongly
sheared environment in place, supercells capable of producing all
severe hazards, including strong tornadoes, will be possible with
this first round of storms. 

By mid-to-late afternoon, 30-60 meter mid-level height falls should
overspread the dryline as it mixes east into central Kansas
southward into western north Texas. Rapid thunderstorm development
is expected along the dryline given the forecast extreme
instability. These thunderstorms should develop west of the better
low-level jet/flow, where the low-level flow is expected to be a
little more veered than across eastern Kansas/Oklahoma. This veered
low-level flow still will result in a strongly sheered environment,
but with more straight hodographs and less low-level curvature. The
result should be another round of supercells, albeit with a tendency
to split. These supercells will be capable of producing very large
hail and tornadoes. The number of supercells across the dryline
combined with a propensity to split, may result in destructive
interference and result in a more episodic hail and tornado threat.

In addition to the hail and tornado threat, the number of expected
thunderstorms in the presence of a very moist and unstable
atmosphere with steep lapse rates may result in strong downdraft
winds. The most likely region for this will be across portions of
northeast Oklahoma, northwest Arkansas, southeast Kansas, and
southwest Missouri. A 45% wind area was included in this outlook.

... Southern Illinois into Southern Appalachians ...

Along the northern periphery of shortwave ridging over the
Southeast, a midlevel jet streak will cross the southern
Appalachians during the afternoon. Here, an influx of steep midlevel
lapse rates atop rich boundary-layer moisture will yield strong
surface-based instability along/south of a warm front draped across
the region. Scattered thunderstorms will spread east-southeastward
along/south of the front from TN into the southern Appalachians,
where the favorable buoyancy and around 40-50 kt of effective shear
will promote organization into clusters and a couple splitting
supercell structures. Damaging winds and large hail will be possible
with the strongest storms.

Overnight, additional thunderstorms may develop across southern
Illinois and western Kentucky in association with warm-air advection
ahead of the main area of thunderstorms to the west. These
thunderstorms will also pose the potential for small hail and
isolated wind damage.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0352 AM CDT Mon May 19 2025

Valid 221200Z - 271200Z

...DISCUSSION...
A dry airmass will be in place across most of the eastern CONUS on
Thursday/D4 as a cold front moves into the western Atlantic and
stalls near the Gulf Coast. This will likely represent the minimum
threat during the extended severe weather period, with isolated
strong to severe storms across Texas likely the only threat area.

Starting Friday/D5, richer low-level moisture will advect over the
southern High Plains. However, this will also correspond to
shortwave ridging building across the Plains over the weekend
followed by zonal flow into early next week. This pattern may
support some localized threat each day, but more widespread,
predictable severe weather is unlikely at an extended range. As
these days draw closer, more confined regions of threat may become
more clear and allow for severe weather probabilities to be added.

PUBLIC SEVERE WEATHER OUTLOOK  
NWS STORM PREDICTION CENTER NORMAN OK
0344 AM CDT MON MAY 19 2025

...Severe thunderstorms expected over parts of the state of Oklahoma
and western Ozark Plateau this afternoon and tonight...

* LOCATIONS...
  Central and Eastern Oklahoma
  Northwest Arkansas
  Far Southwest Missouri

* HAZARDS...
  Several tornadoes, a few intense
  Widespread large hail, some baseball size
  Scattered damaging winds

* SUMMARY...
  Significant severe weather is likely from the central/southern
  Plains into the the Ozarks today into tonight. All severe
  weather hazards are expected, to include tornadoes (some
  potentially strong to intense), very large hail, and severe
  winds.

Preparedness actions...

Review your severe weather safety procedures for the possibility
of dangerous weather today. Stay tuned to NOAA Weather Radio, 
weather.gov, or other media for watches and warnings. A tornado
watch means that conditions are favorable for tornadoes to form
during the next several hours. If a tornado warning is issued for
your area, move to a place of safety, ideally in a basement or
interior room on the lowest floor of a sturdy building.

0321 PM CDT Sun May 18 2025

Areas affected...much of western Oklahoma...southwest
Kansas...extreme eastern Panhandle

Concerning...Severe potential...Tornado Watch likely 

Valid 182021Z - 182215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered supercells capable of strong tornadoes and very
large hail are forecast from late afternoon into the evening from
parts of northwest Oklahoma into southwest Kansas. EF3+ tornadoes
may occur.

DISCUSSION...Surface analysis and visible imagery clearly outline
the unstable warm sector, situated between a dryline from southeast
CO into the eastern TX Panhandle, and a warm front/retreating
outflow draped across northern OK into south-central KS. The air
mass has become very unstable, and will continue to develop
northward. This air mass is coincident with an already strongly
sheared environment with effective SRH over 200 m2/s2. These
low-level shear values will increase markedly later today and during
the evening as the low level jet increases with effective SRH of
300-400 m2/s2 common.

While very cool air and clouds currently exist over northern OK into
south-central KS, a strengthening low-level jet will likely yield
clearing later in the evening, which may allow the tornado threat to
expand farther eastward.

Areas affected...northeast Colorado...western Nebraska...northwest
Kansas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 181912Z - 182145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Supercells capable of very large hail, tornadoes, and
damaging wind are likely to develop after 21Z over northeast
Colorado, spreading into western Nebraska and northwest Kansas
through evening.

DISCUSSION...A surface low continues to deepen over eastern CO as
the shortwave trough moves across the area. Surface analysis shows a
prominent plume of low-level moisture extending out of western KS
and across northeast CO, where dewpoints are holding in the lower
50s F. 

Full heating near and south of this moisture plume will erode the
minimal capping inversion by around 21Z, and rapid thunderstorm
development is expected. The combination of strong instability,
steep lapse rates, and veering winds with height will strongly favor
supercells capable of very large hail, and a few tornadoes. Activity
should easily remain severe into NE and KS this evening as the
southeasterly low-level jet persists, maintaining moisture advection
as well as shear and inflow.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0158 PM CDT Sun May 18 2025

Areas affected...Northwest to west-central Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 181858Z - 182130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm development along the dryline is expected
roughly between 20-22 UTC across northwest to west-central Texas.
The convective environment will support supercells capable of large
hail, severe gusts, and a few tornadoes. Watch issuance is likely as
storms begin to develop.

DISCUSSION...Recent GOES visible imagery shows shallow, but slowly
deepening, cumulus along and just ahead of a sharpening dryline as
it continues to mix east and boundary-layer depth increases amid
filtered diurnal heating. Latest RAP/HRRR forecast soundings suggest
any lingering MLCIN will be minimized as surface temperatures warm
into the 92-95 F range over the next few hours within the warm
sector. Regional VWPs show flow within the lowest 2-3 km AGL
oriented roughly along the dryline, which should promote adequate
residence times for parcels to reach their LFCs and initiate deep
convection. Latest high-res solutions suggest this should occur
generally between 20-22 UTC. Thunderstorms will mature within a very
unstable air mass with MLCAPE values exceeding 4000 J/kg and
effective shear on the order of 40-50 knots. Limited directional
shear will initially promote splitting supercells with an attendant
very large hail threat (most probable max hail size may be 2-3
inches in diameter). Southeasterly low-level winds across northwest
TX may support adequate low-level veering for some tornado threat.
Further south (roughly south of I-20), 1.5 to 2.5 km LCL heights and
more backed low-level flow will modulate the initial tornado
potential. After 00 UTC a strengthening low-level jet will increase
low-level hodograph curvature and support an increasing tornado
threat with any remaining discrete right-moving supercells across
much of central/northern TX. Watch issuance will likely be needed as
thunderstorm initiation becomes more imminent.

## SPC Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook

date: 2025-05-18, from: NOAA tornado/severe thunderstorm watches, mesoscale discussions, convective outlooks, fire weather outlooks

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0308 PM CDT Sun May 18 2025

Valid 201200Z - 261200Z

Mainly zonal flow will overspread the western and central CONUS
through at least mid-week, before upper ridging sets in by the end
of the week and a mid-level trough traverses the Interior West this
weekend. Surface high pressure should overspread much of the western
and central CONUS through the week, with surface lee troughing and
accompanying moisture return likely across the Plains states by this
weekend as the upper trough approaches. The net result will be
quiescent fire weather conditions across much of the CONUS for the
week. Warm and dry conditions will prevail across the Southwest into
the weekend, which will encourage further curing of fuels.

At the moment, there is some disagreement among medium-range
guidance members concerning the timing and evolution of the weekend
upper trough. As such, confidence in the placement and timing of
overlapping dry and windy conditions across the Southwest is too low
for the introduction of Critical probabilities at this time.
However, if the medium-range guidance comes into better consensus

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0305 PM CDT Sun May 18 2025

Valid 182000Z - 191200Z

...THERE IS A MODERATE RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR SOUTHWEST
AND CENTRAL KANSAS INTO FAR NORTHWEST OKLAHOMA...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM EASTERN
MISSISSIPPI...CENTRAL ALABAMA...AND SOUTHERN GEORGIA...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms capable of all severe hazards are expected this
afternoon and evening across portions of the central and southern
Plains.  Several strong to intense tornadoes are possible.

...20z Update...
Adjustments were made to the current D1 Convective Outlook to the
Slight across the Southeast to account for latest trends in radar
and observations. A couple of broken line segments of thunderstorms
continue to pose a risk for damaging wind in these regions.

Elsewhere, the higher risk area across the central and southern
Plains continues to be where potential for all hazards will be
possible. The current plume of mid-level cloud cover extending from
central to eastern OK into southern KS continues to pose some
uncertainty on how the situation will unfold this afternoon.
Clearing across southwestern OK has allowed for heating and the
agitated cu field continues on visible satellite imagery. Further
into Kansas, clouds are more persistent but there is a narrow region
of warming from the Oklahoma Panhandle into Dodge City. CAM guidance
is spread on exactly how storms will evolve this afternoon, but it
appears supercell development is likely across the dryline in
western Oklahoma and Kansas this afternoon. Should a discrete mode
maintain, very large hail and tornadoes will be possible. As the
afternoon/evening progresses, the low level jet will increase
through time with moisture advection increasing into central
Oklahoma and southern Kansas. Should supercells be maintained, this
could pose a risk for a strong tornado.

See previous discussion for more information.

..Thornton.. 05/18/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1222 PM CDT Sun May 18 2025/

...KS/OK...
A large upper trough continues to deepen over the western US, with a
band of 60-70 knot southwesterly mid-level flow extending across NM
into western KS/OK.  The surface dryline will mix eastward into
western KS and along the TX/OK border by mid-afternoon, with the air
mass to the east becoming extremely unstable with dewpoints in the
upper 60s and MLCAPE values over 4000 J/kg.  Strong
southerly/southeasterly low-level winds throughout the warm sector
will provide a conditionally favorable environment for intense
supercells capable of very large hail, damaging winds, and
tornadoes.  However, morning model guidance continues to show
diverse solutions regarding coverage of convection later today.  

The area of greatest confidence in storm development and intensity
will be near the warm front/dryline triple point over south-central
KS.  Discrete supercell development appears likely here, with
forecast soundings showing favorable hodograph structures to promote
a risk of strong tornadoes.  The MDT risk has been extending
slightly eastward along the warm front.  Farther south along the
dryline in western OK, confidence in initiation is lower.  However,
any storm that can form will be capable of all hazards.

...Western North TX...
Another region of higher confidence in convective initiation will be
over western north TX along the dryline.  Hot surface temperatures
in vicinity of a dryline bulge will aid in storm development.  These
storms will likely expand eastward and into southwest OK through the
evening, with very large hail and damaging winds possible.

...MS/AL/GA...
A narrow corridor of SLGT risk has been added for this afternoon
from eastern MS across central AL and southern GA.  Multiple MCSs
are ongoing in this corridor, with associated outflow boundaries
present.  These boundaries may be the focus for further development
this afternoon, with sufficient CAPE/shear combinations to pose a
risk of damaging winds in the strongest cells.

Valid 201200Z - 211200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS
OF TENNESSEE INTO NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI AND ALABAMA...

CORRECTED FOR DAY OF  WEEK REFERENCE

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are likely across portions of the Ohio Valley,
Mid-Mississippi Valley, and Tennessee Valley on Tuesday.

...Mid-Mississippi Valley into the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys...

A shortwave upper trough will develop east across the region on
Tuesday, bringing enhanced southwesterly mid/upper flow atop a very
moist airmass. A surface low over northern MO will shift east across
IL/IN and into OH by Wednesday morning. Mid-60s to low 70s F
dewpoints will be in place to the south of a warm front draped
across central IL/IN into northern KY by midday. A trailing cold
front will shift east/southeast across the Ozarks toward the
Mid-South during the afternoon, and across the TN and Lower MS
Valley overnight. Moderate to strong destabilization ahead of the
cold front and strong vertical shear will support organized
convection capable of all severe hazards.

Guidance varies, but convection will likely be ongoing in the
vicinity of the warm front Tuesday morning from parts of IL into IN
and perhaps KY. The exact location and extent of this activity will
influence severe potential across the Ohio Valley during the
afternoon. There is some potential that if morning convection does
not dilute the favorable airmass across KY that higher severe
probabilities may need to be extended northward in subsequent
outlooks. 

Otherwise, initial supercells are expected to develop ahead of the
cold front across the Mid-South during the afternoon. This activity
will pose a risk for large hail, strong gusts and tornadoes. With
time, convection is expected to develop upscale into one or more
bowing segments while shifting east across the TN Valley into the
evening/overnight hours. An increasing risk for damaging winds will
occur with upscale development and some potential for a swath of
significant gusts is possible across the TN Valley vicinity.

...NC Vicinity...

A warm front is forecast to lift northward across the region during
the day, allowing for a corridor of rich boundary-layer moisture to
spread across parts of SC/NC/western VA. Vertically veering,
supercell wind profiles along this boundary, and MLCAPE to 1500 J/kg
MLCAPE is evident in forecast soundings. This could support a few
strong to severe storms during the late afternoon or evening as
modest height falls overspread the region.

0200 PM CDT Sun May 18 2025

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN
NEW MEXICO INTO FAR WEST TEXAS...

The previous forecast remains on track, with westward/eastward
extensions of Critical/Elevated highlights (respectively) made to
account for the latest guidance consensus. Please see the previous
forecast (below) for more details.

..Squitieri.. 05/18/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0112 AM CDT Sun May 18 2025/

...Synopsis...
As a mid-level trough moves out of the Great Basin and into the
southern Great Plains on Monday, dry down-slope winds behind a
dryline in southern New Mexico into far western Texas will result in
Critical fire-weather conditions. Additionally, some persistent
northerly flow over central California will result in Elevated
fire-weather conditions across portions of the San Joaquin valley. 

...Southern New Mexico into Far Western Texas...
Westerly down-slope winds in New Mexico beneath a progressive
mid-level trough, along with deep boundary-layer mixing and a
deepening surface cyclone, will result in widespread Critical
fire-weather conditions across southern New Mexico Monday afternoon.
Winds in excess of 25 MPH with relative humidity at or below 10%
will overspread a region of fuels that are at or above the 90th
annual ERC percentiles, and will result in conditions that support
rapid wildfire ignition and spread. Some locally Extremely Critical
conditions may occur, with winds in excess of 30 MPH, across
portions of southern New Mexico. However, they appear too localized
for highlights at this time. 

...Central California...
Ensemble guidance suggests that deep boundary-layer mixing beneath
persistent mid-level northerly flow will result in Elevated
fire-weather conditions. While fuels are on the more marginal side,
15+ MPH winds and relative humidity at or below 15% will support at
least Elevated highlights.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1232 PM CDT Sun May 18 2025

Valid 191200Z - 201200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS
OF THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN PLAINS INTO THE OZARKS...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM MIDDLE
TENNESSEE INTO SOUTH CAROLINA...

...SUMMARY...
Severe storms with all severe weather hazards are expected from the
central/southern Plains into the Ozarks on Monday.

...Central/Southern Plains to the Mid-Mississippi Valley...

An uncertain and potentially messy convective scenario is apparent
across the region on Monday. An upper trough over the southern
Rockies will become negatively tilted as it ejects across the
central/southern Plains toward the Mid-MS Valley. As this occurs, a
southwesterly 500 mb jet streak around 70-80 kt will overspread the
region. By early evening and into the overnight hours, an 850-700 mb
low-level jet will increase to around 45-55 kt. 

At the surface, a somewhat elongated low will extend from central NE
into western KS/OK, with some forecast guidance suggesting a
secondary low pressure center developing over northwest OK during
late afternoon/early evening. At midday, a dryline will extend
southward from central KS into western OK and central TX while a
cold front develop east/southwest across NE and western KS. A warm
front will extend from southeast NE into northern MO and then
eastward into the Lower OH Valley. The warm front is not forecast to
move much through the forecast period. Between these surface
boundaries, a moisture-rich boundary layer will be in place with mid
60s to low 70s F dewpoints across a broad zone from eastern KS/OK/TX
toward the Mid-South. A plume of steep midlevel lapse rates atop
this moist boundary layer will result in strong destabilization by
early afternoon, with MLCAPE around 2500-3500 J/kg common.
Vertically veering, supercell wind profiles, becoming
elongated/straight above 2-3 km will be present. Low-level
hodographs initially will be somewhat small, but should become
enlarged as the low-level jet increases toward evening. 

Capping is expected to erode by early to mid afternoon across the
region. Convective evolution is uncertain. Most guidance develops
quite a bit of thunderstorms rather early in the afternoon across
portions of the Ozarks where 850 mb warm air advection will be
maximized. While initial supercells could be possible, cell
interactions and consolidation could result in some upscale
development. Regardless, this initial activity will pose an
all-hazards severe risk.

Additional supercells are likely to develop along the surface
dryline from central/eastern KS/OK where strong heating along/to the
west of the boundary is expected. Convergence along the dryline is
not forecast to be overly strong as low-level flow appears to remain
more southerly rather than southeasterly given a lack of stronger
surface cyclogenesis. This could result in a messy storm mode due to
storm interactions. Nevertheless, strong instability, very steep
lapse rates, and a favorably sheared environment will support
significant severe storms pose an all-hazards severe risk.  With
time and an increasing low-level jet, one or more linear bands may
develop across eastern KS/OK and move into MO/AR during the
nighttime hours. A corridor of greater risk potential is possible
somewhere across central/eastern OK/KS but uncertainty remains too
great at this time for a categorical outlook upgrade. 

...Middle TN into parts of SC...

An upper ridge is forecast to be centered over the OH/TN Valley and
Gulf Coast region, with modest northwesterly flow aloft spreading
over the Southeast. Most guidance depicts a remnant MCV migrating
through the northwest flow amid a corridor of strong instability.
Deep-layer flow will be unidirectional, but speed shear will produce
long/straight hodographs, with effective shear magnitudes around
25-35 kt. Modest midlevel lapse rates nearing 7 C/km, and strong
surface heating leading to steep low-level lapse rates. Isolated
large hail and strong/damaging gusts will be possible as convection
develops southeast across the region through the afternoon.

MISSISSIPPI...CENTRAL ALABAMA...AND SOUTHERN GEORGIA...

CORRECTED FOR THUNDER LINE IN MAINE

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms capable of all severe hazards are expected this
afternoon and evening across portions of the central and southern
Plains.  Several strong to intense tornadoes are possible.

...KS/OK...
A large upper trough continues to deepen over the western US, with a
band of 60-70 knot southwesterly mid-level flow extending across NM
into western KS/OK.  The surface dryline will mix eastward into
western KS and along the TX/OK border by mid-afternoon, with the air
mass to the east becoming extremely unstable with dewpoints in the
upper 60s and MLCAPE values over 4000 J/kg.  Strong
southerly/southeasterly low-level winds throughout the warm sector
will provide a conditionally favorable environment for intense
supercells capable of very large hail, damaging winds, and
tornadoes.  However, morning model guidance continues to show
diverse solutions regarding coverage of convection later today.  

The area of greatest confidence in storm development and intensity
will be near the warm front/dryline triple point over south-central
KS.  Discrete supercell development appears likely here, with
forecast soundings showing favorable hodograph structures to promote
a risk of strong tornadoes.  The MDT risk has been extending
slightly eastward along the warm front.  Farther south along the
dryline in western OK, confidence in initiation is lower.  However,
any storm that can form will be capable of all hazards.

...Western North TX...
Another region of higher confidence in convective initiation will be
over western north TX along the dryline.  Hot surface temperatures
in vicinity of a dryline bulge will aid in storm development.  These
storms will likely expand eastward and into southwest OK through the
evening, with very large hail and damaging winds possible.

...MS/AL/GA...
A narrow corridor of SLGT risk has been added for this afternoon
from eastern MS across central AL and southern GA.  Multiple MCSs
are ongoing in this corridor, with associated outflow boundaries
present.  These boundaries may be the focus for further development
this afternoon, with sufficient CAPE/shear combinations to pose a
risk of damaging winds in the strongest cells.

1120 AM CDT Sun May 18 2025

Valid 181700Z - 191200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN
NEW MEXICO INTO FAR WEST TEXAS...

The previous forecast remains largely on track. Visible satellite
depicts clearing skies across the southern High Plains, supporting
robust boundary-layer mixing. Surface observations show evidence of
a developing dryline over the TX Panhandle, with 10-20 mph sustained
southwesterly surface winds amid 10-30 percent RH in the
post-dryline environment. Some surface observations across southern
New Mexico already depict Critical meteorological conditions (i.e.
single-digit RH coinciding with sustained winds well over 20 mph).
With continued boundary-layer heating/mixing, these Critical
conditions should become common across most of the southern High
Plains behind the dryline, in agreement with the latest guidance
consensus. However, Critical highlights remain only where fuels are
highly receptive to wildfire-spread potential.

Guidance consensus also still shows the potential for 15-20 mph
sustained northwesterly surface winds coinciding with 15-25 percent
RH across portions of the California Valley region later this
afternoon, where Elevated highlights remain in place.

..Squitieri.. 05/18/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0110 AM CDT Sun May 18 2025/

...Synopsis...
As a mid-level shortwave trough progresses from the Four Corners to
the southern High Plains, and a surface lee cyclone deepens
throughout the morning and afternoon, Critical fire-weather
conditions are anticipated across much of southern New Mexico.
Further west, mid-level northerly flow on the western side of the
trough is expected to bring Elevated fire-weather conditions to the
Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys.

...Southern New Mexico...
Deep boundary-layer mixing behind a sharpening dryline, along with a
deepening surface cyclone and associated gradient wind response,
will be responsible for widespread Critical fire-weather conditions
this afternoon. Sustained winds of 25 MPH and relative humidity
below 10%, along with highly receptive fuels, will result in
conditions that support rapid wildfire ignition and spread. Some
downslope winds in southern and eastern New Mexico may even locally
reach Extremely Critical criteria, with sustained winds exceeding 30
MPH. However, such conditions appear to be too localized for larger
highlights at this time. Additionally, the Critical meteorological
conditions will exist well into the Texas Panhandle and portions of
southern Kansas -- but ERC fuels guidance shows fuels are not quite
as receptive, warranting only Elevated highlights. 

...Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys...
Deep boundary-layer mixing beneath modest mid-level northerly flow
will result in dry and windy conditions across much of the interior
California valleys. Winds of 15 MPH and relative humidity at or
below 15% are expected. Fuels appear more marginal, but there is
some signal for fuel receptiveness, warranting at least Elevated
highlights.

0656 AM CDT Sun May 18 2025

Areas affected...central Arkansas and northern Mississippi

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 284...

Valid 181156Z - 181400Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 284
continues.

SUMMARY...Long-lived cluster of thunderstorms, with a history of
producing wind damage, continues to move through central Arkansas.
The overall environment should continue to support a severe threat
ahead of this MCS through at least mid morning.

DISCUSSION...Long-lived linear MCS, with a history of producing wind
damage, continues to move east-southeast through much of Arkansas
this morning. This MCS is moving along a west-northwest to
east-southeast CAPE gradient stretching from northeast Oklahoma into
southern Georgia and is following a similar path as to an earlier
MCS from last evening into earlier this morning. 

The overall large-scale environment will continue to support
maintenance of this MCS as the MCS has access to MUCAPE greater than
2000 J/kg and effective shear around 50 knots. The organization of
the MCS, the overall favorable environment,and knowledge that the
earlier MCS traversed a similar environment and is continuing
through Alabama supports the severe threat through the morning. A
downstream watch may become necessary for portions of far eastern
Arkansas and northern Mississippi as the MCS approaches the edge of
Severe Thunderstorm Watch #284.

Areas affected...Central Alabama and far west-central Georgia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 181140Z - 181245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...A thunderstorm cluster moving across central Alabama will
pose a threat for isolated large hail and wind damage in the near
term. Longer term evolution of this cluster is less certain, but the
area will continue to be monitored for potential watch issuance.

DISCUSSION...Long-lived cluster of thunderstorms continues to move
across central Alabama this morning along the instability gradient.
The strongest of these thunderstorms (located across eastern
Tuscaloosa County) appears to have increased in intensity over the
last hour and has even developed a rear-inflow jet (RIJ) --
suggested by radar reflectivity structure and an increase in
rear-to-front wind speeds. This will pose a damaging wind threat in
the short term.

Additionally, overall reflectivity structure of the thunderstorm
complex suggests the development of a mesoscale convective vortex.
Should this be the case, an increase in updraft intensity would be
expected in the near term owing to increasing convergence and
stronger deep-layer shear. MUCAPE is around 1000 J/kg and deep-layer
shear around 50 knots across the thunderstorm cluster now, but drops
off to around 1000 J/kg and 30-40 knots as the cluster approaches
western Georgia.

As the thunderstorms move east, the lack of clarity of the MCV
evolution and a slightly less favorable environment results in
uncertainty as to whether a severe thunderstorm watch will be needed
downstream. Conditions will continue to be monitored for potential
watch issuance.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 285
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
815 AM EDT Sun May 18 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Eastern Alabama
  North-Central Georgia

* Effective this Sunday morning and afternoon from 815 AM until
  100 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...A fast-moving cluster of strong to severe thunderstorms
will likely continue eastward from eastern Alabama into Georgia this
morning.  Scattered damaging gusts (55-70 mph) will be the primary
severe hazard, but large hail may accompany the stronger
thunderstorms as well.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 45
statute miles north and south of a line from 25 miles south of
Anniston AL to 45 miles northeast of Macon GA. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU5).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 284...

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
27045.
