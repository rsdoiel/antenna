0247 PM CDT Wed Apr 09 2025

Valid 092000Z - 101200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated thunderstorms remain possible through tonight from parts of
the northern/central Plains into the Midwest and Ohio Valley and
eastern FL. Severe thunderstorms are not expected.

...20z Update...
Only minor changes were made to the thunder areas across parts of NE
and MT for the latest guidance and ongoing storms. Severe
thunderstorms are unlikely, see the prior discussion.

..Lyons.. 04/09/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1115 AM CDT Wed Apr 09 2025/

...Synopsis and Discussion...
Multiple low-amplitude, mid-level shortwave troughs are forecast to
develop east-southeastward today and tonight from parts of the
northern/central Plains into the Midwest and OH Valley. Rather
meager/shallow low-level moisture will tend to limit thunderstorm
coverage and intensity across these regions. Even so, sufficient
large-scale ascent and weak MUCAPE may still support isolated
convection capable of producing lightning through the period.
Occasional strong/gusty winds may occur with high-based
thunderstorms across parts of SD/NE this afternoon, but organized
severe thunderstorms are not forecast.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0223 PM CDT Wed Apr 09 2025

Valid 101200Z - 111200Z

Broad northwest flow within a dry post-frontal air mass is still
expected to bring elevated fire weather conditions to portions of
the Central Plains for day 2/Thursday. Elevated highlights were
expanded into the Nebraska Panhandle as well as portions of southern
Kansas and far northern Oklahoma where fuels will be more receptive
to wildfire spread after several days of warming and drying.
Otherwise, previous forecast philosophy (see below) remains on
track.

..Williams/Moore.. 04/09/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1144 PM CDT Tue Apr 08 2025/

...Synopsis...
Mid-level troughing will amplify across the eastern CONUS as an
upper ridge continues to build over the Interior West tomorrow,
supporting a deep-layer northwesterly flow regime across the central
Plains, where a dry boundary layer will be in place. By afternoon
peak heating, boundary-layer mixing will foster downward momentum
transport of the stronger flow aloft to support dry and windy
conditions for several hours tomorrow (Thursday) afternoon. Guidance
consensus depicts 15-20 mph sustained northwesterly surface winds
amid 20 percent RH across portions of central Nebraska into Kansas.
Given at least modestly dry fuels in this region, Elevated
highlights have been introduced.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
EASTERN CAROLINAS AND FAR SOUTHEAST VIRGINIA....

...SUMMARY...
A couple strong to severe storms will be possible from the eastern
Carolinas into southeast Virginia on Friday. Primary concerns will
be isolated severe hail and locally damaging wind gusts.

...Discussion...
A strong mid-level jet streak will round the base of the trough on
Friday morning resulting in a deepening, negatively tilted mid-level
shortwave trough across the southern Appalachians. As a result, a
surface low will deepen across the central Carolinas Friday morning.
As this occurs, upper 50s to low 60s dewpoints over the Gulf Stream
will advect inland across eastern South Carolina and North Carolina
and perhaps far as southeast Virginia. Cooling temperatures aloft
and steepening mid-level lapse rates will aid in destabilization
Friday morning. If some surface heating can occur and allow for a
zone of greater instability (1000+ J/kg MLCAPE) to develop, a slight
risk may be needed. The most favorable zone at this time extends
from northeast South Carolina into eastern North Carolina where
cloudcover/stabilizing rainfall is less likely.

There is still some uncertainty regarding the timing and location of
the mid-level jet max and as a result, the location of the surface
low. These differences are only 50 to 100 miles, but given how close
the threat is to the coast, this could have a significant impact on
inland destabilization and thus the potential for a corridor of
greater severe risk. This, combined with cloudcover/ongoing
convective concerns mentioned above, preclude higher probabilities
at this time.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PORTIONS OF
THE MID-MISSISSIPPI VALLEY TO NORTHERN GEORGIA...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe storms capable of producing large hail and damaging
gusts will be possible across portions of the Mid/Deep South and
Tennessee Valley on Thursday.

...Synopsis...
On Thursday, an elongated, strong mid-level jet streak across the
central Plains will help amplify the trough across the eastern
CONUS. Very cold mid-level temperatures (-25 to -26C at 500mb) will
overspread the Mid-Mississippi Valley into the Tennessee Valley. At
the surface, lower/middle 50s F dewpoints will stream northeastward
along/ahead of a southeastward-moving cold front.

...Mid/Deep South and Tennessee Valley...
Ahead of a southward moving surface front, low-level moistening and
substantial diurnal heating will result in moderate instability
(1000 to 1500 J/kg MLCAPE) from Arkansas into Tennessee, with weaker
destabilization farther northeast into the Lower Ohio River Valley.
A broad region of ascent will develop across the warm sector by
early Thursday afternoon within the left exit region of the
upper-level jet streak. This should result in scattered
thunderstorms from Arkansas/Missouri to Indiana, eastern Kentucky
and perhaps southern Ohio. The best overlap between the greatest
instability and shear will be from eastern Arkansas eastward to
northern Georgia where the slight risk is present. 

Long/straight hodographs will initially support splitting supercells
with a threat for large hail. In addition, these supercells will
have some wind threat given the steep lapse rates and well-mixed
boundary layer. This thermodynamic profile will support eventual
upscale growth into one or more line segments with a primary
damaging wind threat expected by late afternoon and into the
evening.

1153 AM CDT Wed Apr 09 2025

Valid 091700Z - 101200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE CENTRAL HIGH
PLAINS...

Short term model guidance continues to indicate high-based but
isolated thunderstorm development across portions of Nebraska
through the afternoon. The isolated convection will quickly move
southeastward at 35-45 mph, limiting rainfall while also producing
gusty surface winds associated owing to a fairly dry sub-cloud
layer. Therefore, Isolated Dry Thunderstorm highlights were
introduced into north-central into southeastern portions of
Nebraska.

Elevated highlights were expanded slightly into western Kansas
accounting for a more broad area of enhanced northwest winds within
a dry post-frontal air mass. Similarly in Florida, modest northerly
surface winds nearly parallel to the lower Florida Peninsula
combined with afternoon relative humidity dropping into the 25-35
percent range will allow for Elevated fire weather conditions this
afternoon. The driest boundary layer conditions will be concentrated
along the western Florida peninsula through this afternoon where the
Elevated highlights were added.

..Williams/Moore.. 04/09/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1143 PM CDT Tue Apr 08 2025/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will begin to amplify over the Ohio Valley as
upper ridging builds in over the Interior West today. By afternoon,
an 80+ kt 500 mb jet streak will overspread a dry boundary layer
over the central/northern Plains. Downward momentum transport within
this dry boundary layer will support 15-20 mph sustained
northwesterly surface winds amid 20 percent RH. Given dry fuels
across the central/northern Plains, Elevated highlights have been
introduced where guidance consensus depicts the aforementioned
dry/windy conditions persisting for several hours. Guidance
consensus also depicts 20-25 mph sustained northwesterly surface
winds coinciding with 10-15 percent RH across portions of the
central High Plains, where Critical highlights are in place. 

Additionally, by afternoon, buoyancy (albeit scant) may support
isolated, fast-moving/high-based thunderstorms over the same
portions of the central Plains that will experience dry/windy
surface conditions atop dry fuels. However, thunderstorms should be
sparse at best over most areas, and it is unclear where a locally
higher density of lightning flashes may occur, hence no isolated dry
thunderstorms highlights introduced this outlook.

0734 AM CDT Wed Apr 09 2025

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms are possible from the northern Plains into the Upper
Midwest as well as across portions of the Midwest and central
Plains. Severe storms are not expected.

...Synopsis and Discussion...
Shortwave trough currently moving through the northern Plains is
forecast to continue southeastward throughout the day, reaching the
Mid MS Valley by early tomorrow. Some modest amplification of this
shortwave is expected as a jet streak progresses through it base. An
attendant surface low, currently over southeast NE, will move
eastward just ahead of its parent shortwave, reaching the Mid MS
Valley tonight and the middle OH Valley by early tomorrow morning.
An associated cold front will push southeastward through MO, KS and
OK.

Limited moisture return will keep buoyancy muted ahead of the front,
keeping the potential for surface-based thunderstorm development
along the front low. Cooling mid-level temperatures and moistening
low/mid-levels will likely result in isolated elevated thunderstorms
across IL during the early evening. Persistent warm-air advection
along the front should allow for isolated thunderstorms to continue
throughout the evening and overnight across central/southern IN, KY,
and western/middle TN. An isolated instance or two of small hail is
possible but any severe threat should be tempered by limited
buoyancy. 

Farther west, a separate, lower amplitude shortwave trough is
expected to move eastward from the northern Rockies into the
northern/central Plains. Large-scale ascent attendant to this
shortwave will spread into the northern and central Plains near peak
heating. Modest airmass destabilization is anticipated from the
Black Hills across NE where deep mixing is likely, as well as
farther north from eastern MT/western ND into MN where cold
mid-level temperatures are expected. Isolated thunderstorms are
possible within these corridors. Overall severe potential will be
very low, but the high-based character of these storms could result
in a strong downdraft or two.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0337 AM CDT Wed Apr 09 2025

Valid 121200Z - 171200Z

...DISCUSSION...
From Day 5/Sunday through Day 6/Monday, a robust midlevel trough
will advance eastward from the northern Plains to the Great Lakes.
On Day 5/Sunday, a related broad/elongated surface low will move
eastward across the northern/central Plains, while a dryline
develops farther south over the southern Plains. Isolated strong
storms may be possible ahead of the surface low in the Upper MS
Valley, though poor boundary-layer moisture will tend to limit the
severe risk. Farther south along the dryline, a strong EML and
related capping should inhibit thunderstorm development, despite the
development of larger buoyancy here. 

On Day 6/Monday, a cold front will move across the eastern half of
the CONUS, in tandem with the eastward-moving trough. Strong
midlevel flow and a weakly unstable air mass along the front may
support a marginal severe-storm risk from the OH Valley
southwestward to the Ozarks. However, considerable differences among
the medium-range guidance regarding the quality of boundary-layer
moisture ahead of the front casts uncertainty on the overall risk.

Areas affected...Central/southeast Georgia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 072047Z - 072145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Some increase in convection may be sustained along the
deeper wind shift/cold front, but severe storms appear unlikely.

DISCUSSION...West of the pre-frontal convection, a recent increase
in updraft depth/intensity has occurred across central GA.  This
deepening convection appears to be along the deeper wind shift, with
a band of ascent impinging on residual moisture in the wake of
earlier convection.  However, the prior convection cooled surface
temperatures, lapse rates are poor, and vertical shear has
weakened/become more unidirectional with time, and shear vectors are
primarily parallel to the line orientation.  Thus, the storms are
expected to remain largely sub-severe, and an additional watch or
watch extension appears unnecessary.

Areas affected...parts of NC SC and southern VA

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 134...

Valid 072035Z - 072130Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 134
continues.

SUMMARY...The damaging wind threat continues across WW134, primarily
with the band of storms moving over eastern NC and southern VA.
However, additional storms remain possible farther south.

DISCUSSION...As of 2040 UTC, regional radar imagery shows an
organized linear cluster of thunderstorms ongoing from far
southeastern VA into eastern NC. Over the last 2 hours, several
reports of wind damage, and measured severe gusts have been reported
with the line segment across parts of VA and NC. This appears likely
to continue to the coast as the line segment moves east-northeast at
50 kt.

Farther south, lingering cloud cover has resulted in only isolated
weak convection and showers across parts of SC. Some recent CA
guidance suggests a few stronger cells may eventually emerge closer
to the coast where heating has been more pronounced. A damaging wind
gusts threat could evolve with any deeper connective cells that
become established in the next couple of hours as the primary cold
front continues to shift east.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0740 AM CDT Mon Apr 07 2025

Areas affected...parts of swrn through e cntrl GA...wrn and cntrl SC

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 071240Z - 071445Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...At least low probabilities for an additional tornado or
two and/or locally damaging surface gusts continues in scattered
thunderstorm activity overspread the region through 10-11 AM EDT. 
It is still not clear that a severe weather watch is needed in the
near term, but trends will continue to be monitored for this
possibility.

DISCUSSION...Stronger boundary-layer instability, characterized by
CAPE near or above 1000 J/kg, still remains confined to a narrow
pre-frontal corridor across the western Florida Panhandle through
southwestern into southern portions of central GA.  However, some
cooling loft appears to be contributing to at least weak
destabilization north-northeastward toward the South Carolina
Piedmont.

The front, with a couple of weak waves along it, will continue a
slow eastward progression through mid to late morning, with the
Rapid Refresh indicating that a moderate south-southwesterly
low-level jet (in excess of 40 kt around 850 mb) will maintain
sizable, clockwise-curved low-level hodographs within the
instability axis.

Cloud cover spreading downstream of the stronger ongoing convective
development probably will slow boundary-layer destabilization, and
it is not certain that there will be a substantive further increase
in thunderstorm intensities in the near term.  However, the MCV,
which apparently recently contributed to a tornado south-southwest
of the Greater Atlanta area, continues east-northeastward toward the
South Carolina Piedmont, and it not clear that the downstream
environment will not support an additional relatively short-lived
tornado or two.  Farther south, in the corridor of better
instability, focused along the low-level jet axis near/north and
east of the Albany into Macon vicinities, there may also be
continuing potential for short-lived intensification of
meso-vortices embedded with the ongoing narrow band of convection.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0348 PM CDT Sun Apr 06 2025

Areas affected...parts of southern AL...southwest/central GA...into
the western FL Panhandle

Concerning...Tornado Watch 132...

Valid 062048Z - 062215Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 132 continues.

SUMMARY...Several bands of strong to severe storms will remain
capable of damaging gusts and a couple tornadoes. Some local
extensions of WW132 may be needed, but the downstream threat appears
more limited.

DISCUSSION...As of 2040 UTC, regional radar observations indicate a
band of convection across southeastern AL and west-central GA
continues to show embedded supercell and bowing structures capable
of damaging gusts and tornadoes. This should continue for a couple
more hours as storms approach the eastern edge of the Tornado Watch
132. Areal extensions of a few counties may be needed as storms
begin to outrun the watch. As storms continue farther east, a
gradual decrease in buoyancy should favor weakening into the evening
hours. Until then, damaging gusts and a couple tornadoes remain
possible.

To the southwest, a second smaller band of convection across
southern AL will likely maintain intensity for a few more hours this
afternoon. A few more isolated cells have also developed farther
east within the warm sector across southwest GA and the northern FL
Panhandle. 1500-2000 J/kg of MLCAPE and 40+ kt of effective shear
could support a continued severe threat into this evening. This
matches with some hi-res guidance that shows a gradual expansion of
strong storms into southwest GA and possibly northern FL. However,
forcing for ascent is some what nebulous and storm coverage has
remained more isolated thus far. With storms approaching the
southeast corner of WW132 in the next few hours, some consideration
may be given to a small downstream watch. However the extent of the
severe risk and need for any new watches is currently unclear.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0734 AM CDT Sun Apr 06 2025

Areas affected...parts of sern MS through cntrl AL

Concerning...Tornado Watch 131...

Valid 061234Z - 061430Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 131 continues.

SUMMARY...Convection may continue to undergo further organization
and intensification through 9-10 AM CDT, accompanied by increasing
risk for strong surface gusts, and a continuing risk for tornadoes.

DISCUSSION...At least a bit broader, lower/mid-tropospheric cyclonic
circulation appears to be evolving, perhaps including a surface
meso-low now migrating east-northeastward into/across the Demopolis
AL vicinity.  Latest Rapid Refresh now indicates a more prominent
south-southwesterly speed maximum associated with this feature,
including 50+ kt in the 850-700 mb layer.  Although moisture
characterized by mid 60s+ surface dew points across central Alabama,
between Montgomery and Birmingham still appear to supporting only
modest CAPE (around 500 J/kg sampled in 12Z BMX sounding), low-level
moisture advection and at least some boundary layer warming are
likely to contribute to further destabilization in advance of the
convection during the next few hours.  Inflow of this air mass may
be sufficient to support at least a gradual further intensification
of activity during the next few hours, accompanied by increasing
potential for strong surface gusts and a few tornadoes. 

Discrete thunderstorm development is also being maintained near/just
ahead of the southern flank of the evolving convective system, and
the occasional intensification of these cells, before merging into
the line, may also be accompanied by increasing potential for a
tornado near the Selma/Montgomery vicinities through mid morning.

across the Southeast States. Low-level wind fields remain strong,
supporting the potential for damaging gusts and line-embedded
tornadoes. Additionally, there is also some chance for a few storms
ahead of the main line. Environmental conditions suggest that any
persistent discrete storms could become supercellular and capable of
producing damaging gusts and tornadoes.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 45 statute miles
north and south of a line from 135 miles southwest of Birmingham AL
to 15 miles southeast of Rome GA. For a complete depiction of the
watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU1).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.
