...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE CENTRAL HIGH
PLAINS...

Accelerating mid-level flow associated with an approaching 500 mb
jet max will overspread the central Rockies, into the central High
Plains tomorrow (Wednesday). This will promote stronger downslope
west-northwest surface winds across portions of the central High
Plains and adjacent front range areas. Although temperatures will be
cooler owing to a post-frontal air mass, afternoon relative humidity
is likely to fall to around 10 percent in a few locations. The dry
air mass coupled with gusty winds and dry fuels is expected to
generate Critical fire weather conditions across southeastern
Wyoming extending southeastward into far northwestern Kansas. 

In addition, stronger northwest surface winds and relative humidity
falling to the 20 to 30 percent range combined with sufficient
available dry, fine fuels are expected tomorrow as well across a
broad area from southeastern Montana into portions of South Dakota
and far northwestern Iowa. Therefore, Elevated highlights were
introduced to cover the heightened wildfire spread potential.

..Moore/Williams.. 04/08/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1144 PM CDT Mon Apr 07 2025/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will amplify over the central U.S., with an
embedded 500 mb speed max poised to overspread the central Plains
tomorrow (Wednesday). As surface high pressure builds over the
northern Rockies, downslope flow across the central High Plains will
promote another day of dry/windy conditions. 15-25 mph sustained
westerly surface flow amid 20 percent RH will overspread dry fuels,
warranting the introduction of Elevated highlights. Elsewhere across
the central and southern High Plains, modestly dry and breezy
conditions may develop and overspread fuels that have recently
experienced appreciable precipitation accumulations, with no fire
weather highlights introduced at this time.

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
While organized severe storms are unlikely, isolated strong storms
may occur over far southern Florida and the Keys through early
evening, and perhaps also across southeast Montana to the Black
Hills.

...20z Update...
No changes in forecast reasoning since the prior Outlook. The cold
front will continue to spread south-southeastward across southern
Florida, with thunderstorms increasingly relegated to the far
southeast part of the Peninsula, Keys, and Florida Straits.

..Guyer.. 04/08/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1122 AM CDT Tue Apr 08 2025/

...South Florida/Keys...
A cold front will continue to progress southeastward and move
offshore by evening with scattered showers and thunderstorms
continuing this afternoon ahead of it. While a couple of stronger
storms could occur this afternoon through early evening, poor
mid-level lapse rates and weak deep-layer shear should mitigate
overall storm strength. A positively tilted shortwave trough will
approach the region later tonight. But with the front having
progressed offshore, thunderstorm potential (including any severe
risk) over land should remain very low.

...North-central High Plains..
A shortwave trough is forecast to move from the northern Rockies
into the southern Canadian Prairies, while moderate mid-level flow
expands eastward from the Pacific Northwest into the northern High
Plains. Widely scattered high-based convection is possible during
the afternoon and evening from southeast Montana/northern Wyoming to
the Black Hills as modest large-scale ascent influences areas that
have destabilized amid boundary-layer heating. Weak buoyancy should
temper overall updraft strength, but a few instances of
stronger/gusty thunderstorm winds may occur.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE LOWER
OHIO VALLEY...MID-MISSISSIPPI VALLEY...AND INTO THE MID-SOUTH...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe storms capable of producing large hail and locally
damaging gusts will be possible from the Lower Ohio River Valley to
the Mid-Mississippi Valley and the Mid-South.

...Synopsis and Discussion...
A mid-level trough will amplify across the eastern CONUS on Thursday
with very cold mid-level temperatures (-22 to -26C at 500mb)
expected from the Great Lakes to the Mid-South. These cold
temperatures aloft will result in steep mid-level lapse rates which
will support weak to potentially moderate instability by
early-afternoon. Unidirectional flow, strengthening with height,
will support storm organization including updraft rotation. Overall,
the dry airmass, and thus relatively weak instability, should limit
a greater threat. However, cold temperatures aloft and forecast
soundings showing a deeply mixed boundary layer will support the
potential for some large hail and damaging wind gusts. 

The greatest threat for stronger supercells will exist along the
cold front during peak heating (likely eastern Arkansas to northern
Alabama and southern Tennessee) where better moisture/instability
should be present. Despite a drier airmass farther north and east,
the coldest air aloft will advect over this region and could support
a threat as far northeast as far southern Ohio.

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms are possible across portions of the Midwest, the Upper
Midwest, and the northern High Plains, though severe storms are not
expected.

...Synopsis and Discussion...
A midlevel trough will amplify as it advances southeastward from the
northern Plains into the Midwest on Wednesday, while a surface low
will develop over Missouri and moves into the Lower Ohio Valley. A
cold front will extend southwestward from this surface low with a
warm front to the northeast. 

Despite limited boundary-layer moisture, steep midlevel lapse rates
will yield sufficient instability (albeit weak) for isolated
thunderstorms along the warm front during the evening/overnight
hours. Some thunderstorms may develop along the cold front where
slightly greater instability is forecast. Locally strong gusts
cannot be ruled out, but the weak instability should limit storm
intensity. 

Isolated thunderstorms are expected across the northern Plains and
Upper Midwest as a mid-level trough amplifies and moves south and a
mid-level jet streak overspreads the region.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1131 AM CDT Tue Apr 08 2025

Valid 081700Z - 091200Z

The previous forecast (see below) remains on track. Gusty downslope
winds from the west-northwest along with relative humidity dropping
to around 15 percent are likely this afternoon. These Elevated fire
weather conditions will couple with receptive fuels to magnify
wildfire spread potential across portions of the central High
Plains.

..Moore/Williams.. 04/08/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1141 PM CDT Mon Apr 07 2025/

...Synopsis...
Zonal flow will become established across the CONUS, with multiple
embedded impulses expected to progress eastward within the zonal
flow regime. One such mid-level impulse will overspread the central
Rockies this afternoon, supporting surface cyclone development over
the Plains states. Downslope flow is likely over the central High
Plains, with the latest guidance consensus showing 15-25 mph
sustained westerly surface winds coinciding with 20 percent RH,
warranting the maintenance of Elevated highlights given modestly dry
fuels. Occasionally dry and windy conditions are also possible
across portions of the central and southern High Plains, though
recent appreciable precipitation accumulations have dampened fuels,
precluding fire weather highlights.

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated strong storms may occur over far southern Florida and the
Keys today into Wednesday morning, and from southeast Montana to the
Black Hills.

...Synopsis and Discussion...
A slow-moving cold front continues to push southward across central
FL. This front is expected to continue southward throughout the day,
progressing through South FL and offshore by this evening. Isolated
showers and thunderstorms are anticipated in the vicinity of this
boundary, but poor lapse rates and weak shear should mitigate
overall storm strength. 

A positively tilted shortwave trough is expected to track eastward
across the Gulf today, reaching the FL Peninsula by early Wednesday
morning. A post-frontal airmass will exist across the peninsula
whenever this shortwave arrives, which will keep thunderstorm
chances over land very low.

Farther north and west, a shortwave trough is forecast to move from
the northern Rockies into the southern Canadian Prairies, while 
moderate mid-level flow expands eastward from the Pacific Northwest
into the northern High Plains. Some high-based convection is
possible during the afternoon and evening from southeast MT/northern
WY into the Black Hills as modest large-scale ascent occurs over
regions that have destabilized amid boundary-layer heating. Weak
buoyancy should temper overall updraft strength, but a few gusty
downdrafts are possible.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0337 AM CDT Tue Apr 08 2025

Valid 111200Z - 161200Z

...DISCUSSION...
On Day 4/Friday, an amplified large-scale trough will move slowly
eastward across the Appalachians. Ahead of a related surface low in
the lee of the Appalachians, weakly modified boundary-layer moisture
will be in place across the coastal Mid-Atlantic states. While
instability will be marginal, owing to the limited moisture and poor
lapse rates, strong south-southwesterly midlevel flow may support a
couple strong storms during the afternoon. The overall severe threat
appears too marginal for severe probabilities at this time. 

By Day 6/Sunday, a midlevel trough will advance eastward across the
northern/central Plains, while an elongated downstream surface
trough (with embedded surface lows) promotes partially modified Gulf
moisture return across the southern/central Plains and MS Valley.
Despite multiple surface boundaries across the Plains, current
indications are that a strong EML and related capping atop the
limited boundary-layer moisture should inhibit surface-based
thunderstorm potential.

Thereafter, medium-range guidance varies considerably regarding the
timing and evolution of the aforementioned midlevel trough and
associated warm sector -- limiting confidence in severe-storm
potential for Days 7-8/Monday-Tuesday.

Areas affected...Central/southeast Georgia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 072047Z - 072145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Some increase in convection may be sustained along the
deeper wind shift/cold front, but severe storms appear unlikely.

DISCUSSION...West of the pre-frontal convection, a recent increase
in updraft depth/intensity has occurred across central GA.  This
deepening convection appears to be along the deeper wind shift, with
a band of ascent impinging on residual moisture in the wake of
earlier convection.  However, the prior convection cooled surface
temperatures, lapse rates are poor, and vertical shear has
weakened/become more unidirectional with time, and shear vectors are
primarily parallel to the line orientation.  Thus, the storms are
expected to remain largely sub-severe, and an additional watch or
watch extension appears unnecessary.

Areas affected...parts of NC SC and southern VA

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 134...

Valid 072035Z - 072130Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 134
continues.

SUMMARY...The damaging wind threat continues across WW134, primarily
with the band of storms moving over eastern NC and southern VA.
However, additional storms remain possible farther south.

DISCUSSION...As of 2040 UTC, regional radar imagery shows an
organized linear cluster of thunderstorms ongoing from far
southeastern VA into eastern NC. Over the last 2 hours, several
reports of wind damage, and measured severe gusts have been reported
with the line segment across parts of VA and NC. This appears likely
to continue to the coast as the line segment moves east-northeast at
50 kt.

Farther south, lingering cloud cover has resulted in only isolated
weak convection and showers across parts of SC. Some recent CA
guidance suggests a few stronger cells may eventually emerge closer
to the coast where heating has been more pronounced. A damaging wind
gusts threat could evolve with any deeper connective cells that
become established in the next couple of hours as the primary cold
front continues to shift east.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0740 AM CDT Mon Apr 07 2025

Areas affected...parts of swrn through e cntrl GA...wrn and cntrl SC

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 071240Z - 071445Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...At least low probabilities for an additional tornado or
two and/or locally damaging surface gusts continues in scattered
thunderstorm activity overspread the region through 10-11 AM EDT. 
It is still not clear that a severe weather watch is needed in the
near term, but trends will continue to be monitored for this
possibility.

DISCUSSION...Stronger boundary-layer instability, characterized by
CAPE near or above 1000 J/kg, still remains confined to a narrow
pre-frontal corridor across the western Florida Panhandle through
southwestern into southern portions of central GA.  However, some
cooling loft appears to be contributing to at least weak
destabilization north-northeastward toward the South Carolina
Piedmont.

The front, with a couple of weak waves along it, will continue a
slow eastward progression through mid to late morning, with the
Rapid Refresh indicating that a moderate south-southwesterly
low-level jet (in excess of 40 kt around 850 mb) will maintain
sizable, clockwise-curved low-level hodographs within the
instability axis.

Cloud cover spreading downstream of the stronger ongoing convective
development probably will slow boundary-layer destabilization, and
it is not certain that there will be a substantive further increase
in thunderstorm intensities in the near term.  However, the MCV,
which apparently recently contributed to a tornado south-southwest
of the Greater Atlanta area, continues east-northeastward toward the
South Carolina Piedmont, and it not clear that the downstream
environment will not support an additional relatively short-lived
tornado or two.  Farther south, in the corridor of better
instability, focused along the low-level jet axis near/north and
east of the Albany into Macon vicinities, there may also be
continuing potential for short-lived intensification of
meso-vortices embedded with the ongoing narrow band of convection.

Mesoscale Discussion 0428
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0348 PM CDT Sun Apr 06 2025

Areas affected...parts of southern AL...southwest/central GA...into
the western FL Panhandle

Concerning...Tornado Watch 132...

Valid 062048Z - 062215Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 132 continues.

SUMMARY...Several bands of strong to severe storms will remain
capable of damaging gusts and a couple tornadoes. Some local
extensions of WW132 may be needed, but the downstream threat appears
more limited.

DISCUSSION...As of 2040 UTC, regional radar observations indicate a
band of convection across southeastern AL and west-central GA
continues to show embedded supercell and bowing structures capable
of damaging gusts and tornadoes. This should continue for a couple
more hours as storms approach the eastern edge of the Tornado Watch
132. Areal extensions of a few counties may be needed as storms
begin to outrun the watch. As storms continue farther east, a
gradual decrease in buoyancy should favor weakening into the evening
hours. Until then, damaging gusts and a couple tornadoes remain
possible.

To the southwest, a second smaller band of convection across
southern AL will likely maintain intensity for a few more hours this
afternoon. A few more isolated cells have also developed farther
east within the warm sector across southwest GA and the northern FL
Panhandle. 1500-2000 J/kg of MLCAPE and 40+ kt of effective shear
could support a continued severe threat into this evening. This
matches with some hi-res guidance that shows a gradual expansion of
strong storms into southwest GA and possibly northern FL. However,
forcing for ascent is some what nebulous and storm coverage has
remained more isolated thus far. With storms approaching the
southeast corner of WW132 in the next few hours, some consideration
may be given to a small downstream watch. However the extent of the
severe risk and need for any new watches is currently unclear.

Mesoscale Discussion 0425
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0734 AM CDT Sun Apr 06 2025

Areas affected...parts of sern MS through cntrl AL

Concerning...Tornado Watch 131...

Valid 061234Z - 061430Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 131 continues.

SUMMARY...Convection may continue to undergo further organization
and intensification through 9-10 AM CDT, accompanied by increasing
risk for strong surface gusts, and a continuing risk for tornadoes.

DISCUSSION...At least a bit broader, lower/mid-tropospheric cyclonic
circulation appears to be evolving, perhaps including a surface
meso-low now migrating east-northeastward into/across the Demopolis
AL vicinity.  Latest Rapid Refresh now indicates a more prominent
south-southwesterly speed maximum associated with this feature,
including 50+ kt in the 850-700 mb layer.  Although moisture
characterized by mid 60s+ surface dew points across central Alabama,
between Montgomery and Birmingham still appear to supporting only
modest CAPE (around 500 J/kg sampled in 12Z BMX sounding), low-level
moisture advection and at least some boundary layer warming are
likely to contribute to further destabilization in advance of the
convection during the next few hours.  Inflow of this air mass may
be sufficient to support at least a gradual further intensification
of activity during the next few hours, accompanied by increasing
potential for strong surface gusts and a few tornadoes. 

Discrete thunderstorm development is also being maintained near/just
ahead of the southern flank of the evolving convective system, and
the occasional intensification of these cells, before merging into
the line, may also be accompanied by increasing potential for a
tornado near the Selma/Montgomery vicinities through mid morning.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 131
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
245 AM CDT Sun Apr 6 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Central and Southwest Alabama
  Northwest Georgia
  Far Southeast Mississippi

* Effective this Sunday morning from 245 AM until 1000 AM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A couple tornadoes possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms continue to gradually move southeastward
across the Southeast States. Low-level wind fields remain strong,
supporting the potential for damaging gusts and line-embedded
tornadoes. Additionally, there is also some chance for a few storms
ahead of the main line. Environmental conditions suggest that any
persistent discrete storms could become supercellular and capable of
producing damaging gusts and tornadoes.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 45 statute miles
north and south of a line from 135 miles southwest of Birmingham AL
