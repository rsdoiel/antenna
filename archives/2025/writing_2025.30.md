<p>When Selwyn Seyfu Hinds first picked up the award-winning novel <em>Washington Black</em> by Esi Edugyan, he was on a break during the holidays in his homeland of Guyana. “I have a longstanding rule not to read material over Christmas,” he says. But Ellen Goldsmith-Vein, producer of <em>The Maze Runner</em> films, convinced him to break that rule. He was glad he did.<br><br>“The book was just astonishing,” says Hinds. The journey of a young Caribbean boy navigating trauma, identity, and freedom deeply resonated with Hinds’ own experience immigrating to America at 14.&nbsp;<br><br>“The emotional arc felt the same,” he says. “Learning new ecosystems, new languages and new people – understanding the opportunities and the dangers in the place that you exist. And all of it on your road to finding your agency, finding your method, finding love, you know, finding your existential self. All of that came together and I said this is something that I have to write.”&nbsp;<br><br><em>Washington Black</em> is now a lush, genre-bending TV series on Hulu, executive produced by Hinds, who also serves as showrunner. It’s a steampunk reimagining of the 19th century from a perspective rarely seen on screen. Set in the early 1800s, it follows George Washington “Wash” Black (Eddie Karanja), a boy born into slavery on a Barbados plantation. After an unfortunate event endangers his life, he flees with British explorer Titch (Tom Ellis), embarking on a globe-spanning journey that takes him into adulthood.&nbsp;<br><br>The series weaves back and forth between 20-something Wash (Ernest Kingsley Junior), with flashbacks to Young Wash, delving into matters of race, resilience and a young America. Actor Sterling K. Brown even has a supporting role and serves as Executive Producer. But it’s the unexpected playfulness and optimism that the steampunk tropes – like the depiction of fantastic steam-powered flying machines – that really make it extraordinary.&nbsp;</p>
