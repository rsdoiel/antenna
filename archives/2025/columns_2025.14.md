## 2025-04-07 Gal√®ne was comparatively easy to setup

date: 2025-04-07, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-04-07-gal√®ne-was-comparatively-easy-to-setup">2025-04-07 Gal√®ne was comparatively easy to setup</h1>

<p>I remember how tricky the Jitsi setup was, at the time. When we used it, system load for my small server jumped up to seven or eight. And in the end, we all ended up on Discord. But with Discord showing annoying ads even to paying customers, I&rsquo;m taking another look at the alternatives.</p>

<p>From my point of view, <a href="https://galene.org/">Gal√®ne</a> has the benefits of requiring just a single binary for installation. Sure, deployment is trickier, but in typical Go fashion, you get a huge binary that you copy over to the server and you&rsquo;re essentially ready to test it.</p>

<p>So what did I do?</p>

<p>I created a system user <code>galene</code> with home directory <code>/home/galene</code>. There is no <code>galene</code> group.</p>

<p>This is where the binary lives.</p>

<p>I copied the example <code>galene.service</code> <a href="https://galene.org/INSTALL.html#:~:text=systemd">from the website</a> and adapted it (by changing <code>Group=galene</code> to <code>Group=nogroup</code>).</p>

<p>My Gal√®ne installation does not live behind a reverse proxy, so there is no logging of bots trying to access it. Perhaps a problem to solve for later.</p>

<p>I had to add a bunch of lines to my <code>/etc/apache2/hook.sh</code> that runs whenever <code>mod_md</code> gets new certificates. When that happens, Gal√®ne also gets a copy, with permissions set appropriately. And it gets restarted.</p>

<p>I created a JSON file to define a single group, making me the operator (with a password), and allowing <a href="https://galene.org/README.html#:~:text=wildcard">wildcard users</a> (all sharing the same password). I handed out this password on the IRC channel we use to chat and hang out.</p>

<p>Should we end up with two dozen people or more, then I&rsquo;ll write a web app to administrate these JSON files via the web. Or if I&rsquo;m feeling evil, I&rsquo;ll add the functionality to administer them to an IRC bot. üòÇ</p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-04-07, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hillaryclinton.bsky.social/post/3lma3a4rgks2y">Hillary Clinton</a> makes a very important point. "Republicans in Congress can put a stop to this at any time." By this, she means the crashing US economy. And even if you believe they'll "never do it" -- it's still the right thing to repeat this over and over -- people should know they could. This should be repeated until enough people get it, this is being done <i>on purpose</i> by the Repubs. This isn't about winning elections, it's about understanding who's doing this to you and how deliberate it is.

It's better to first <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/04/07/fileformatScreen.png">use</a> the product or <a href="https://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/about.opml#1633536117000">read</a> the docs or <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=What+is+the+native+file+format+for+Drummer%3F&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&oq=What+is+the+native+file+format+for+Drummer%3F&aqs=chrome..69i57j0i512i546j0i546i649j69i64.10884j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">search</a> on web or use an <a href="https://claude.ai/share/08b9de36-bc41-454b-a21d-e2edcc75d094">AI chatbot</a> before getting humans involved. Anyway, the answer is yes, OPML is the native file format of <a href="http://drummer.land/">Drummer</a>. It's the reason we chose <a href="http://opml.org/">OPML</a> as the format for RSS reading lists, so we could edit them in a distant <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/01/21/141332.html?title=twentyYearsAgoInPodcasting#a154217">ancestor</a> of Drummer's whose native file format was also OPML. I tend not to change file formats gratuitously -- it's how you can use different tools to edit your own data. That's a big part of the plan with <a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a>, because the internal file format for drafts is Markdown, you could put any editor alongside that can edit and save text in Markdown, without a glitch. The idea is to create a new platform, editors for WordPress, and have them all interop with each other perfectly from the start. Because WordLand is the first product in this niche, and Markdown is a very safe choice these days (understood to discourage lock-in), I think it's going to be a perfect basis for interop. Learning from past experience and doing it better each time.

## DIRNSA Fired

date: 2025-04-07, updated: 2025-04-07, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>In &#8220;<a href="https://www.schneier.com/books/secrets-and-lies/">Secrets and Lies</a>&#8221; (2000), I wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is poor civic hygiene to install technologies that could someday facilitate a police state.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s something a bunch of us were saying at the time, in reference to the vast NSA&#8217;s surveillance capabilities.</p>
<p>I have been thinking of that quote a lot as I read <a>news</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/04/03/nsa-director-fired-tim-haugh/">stories</a> <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-national-security-agency-tim-haugh-ec08b455e2c1112f5c6bb1881fad73e2">of</a> President Trump firing the Director of the National Security Agency. General Timothy Haugh.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago, I <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/03/28/signal-chat-leak-trump-technology-security-houthis-group-defense-nsa/">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We don&#8217;t know what pressure the Trump administration is using to make intelligence services fall into line, but it isn&#8217;t crazy to ...</p></blockquote>

## if you aren't redlining the LLM, you aren't headlining

<p>It&#x2019;s an old joke in the DJ community about upcoming artists having a bad reputation for pushing the audio signal into the red.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-04-06, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

I wonder when ChatGPT or Claude.ai will compete with Wikipedia. I think Wikipedia is great but it has always had a weakness in that it can be manipulated to tell a story from a very limited point of view. For example the RSS page has a long section explaining the benefits of Atom. What I like about the AI versions of the basic history of things is that it isn't so easily manipulated. I talked about this with Claude, and asked it to write up a <a href="https://this.how/claudewiki/">proposal for ClaudeWiki</a>, a Wikipedia workalike, not too expensive to run, make it part of a user's $20 per month subscription. I think it would be useful, if only as a demo how Wikipedia itself might improve its service.

If I were designing a social network, I would implement replies differently. When you reply to a post, only the person who wrote the post sees it. If they want they can RT it. The way it works now on all twitter-like systems means most of the replies are basically spam, people using your post as a way to reach people who follow you.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-04-06, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

I used to tell friends you can't go wrong buying the S&P 500. The president is rated by now the stock market does, and so over the long haul you can expect steady growth from the S&P 500, and it keeps things really simple. Well, have to say -- that's no longer good advice. Maybe real estate? Outside the United States? I don't know. It depends on what the people of this country do, and if our representatives are listening.
