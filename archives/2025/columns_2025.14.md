## DIRNSA Fired

date: 2025-04-07, updated: 2025-04-07, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>In &#8220;<a href="https://www.schneier.com/books/secrets-and-lies/">Secrets and Lies</a>&#8221; (2000), I wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is poor civic hygiene to install technologies that could someday facilitate a police state.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s something a bunch of us were saying at the time, in reference to the vast NSA&#8217;s surveillance capabilities.</p>
<p>I have been thinking of that quote a lot as I read <a>news</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/04/03/nsa-director-fired-tim-haugh/">stories</a> <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-national-security-agency-tim-haugh-ec08b455e2c1112f5c6bb1881fad73e2">of</a> President Trump firing the Director of the National Security Agency. General Timothy Haugh.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago, I <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/03/28/signal-chat-leak-trump-technology-security-houthis-group-defense-nsa/">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We don&#8217;t know what pressure the Trump administration is using to make intelligence services fall into line, but it isn&#8217;t crazy to ...</p></blockquote>

## The real reason we’re in a national emergency

date: 2025-04-07, from: Robert Reich's blog

Trump is creating national emergencies to gain more power. In the process, he&#8217;s subjecting millions to real harm.

After President Donald Trump&#8217;s tariff announcements on April 2 wiped $5 trillion dollars from the stock market, the Republican Party is scrambling.

## Writing C for curl

date: 2025-04-07, from: Daniel Stenberg Blog

It is a somewhat common question to me: how do we write C in curl to make it safe and secure for billions of installations? Some precautions we take and decisions we make. There is no silver bullet, just guidelines.

## if you aren't redlining the LLM, you aren't headlining

date: 2025-04-06, from: Geoffrey Hunntley's blog

<p>It&#x2019;s an old joke in the DJ community about upcoming artists having a bad reputation for pushing the audio signal into the red. Red is bad because it results in the audio signal being clipped and the mix sounding muddy.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://ghuntley.com/content/images/2025/04/image-3.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="720" height="886" srcset="https://ghuntley.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/04/image-3.png 600w, https://ghuntley.com/content/images/2025/04/image-3.png 720w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>It&#x2019;s a good analogy that applies</p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-04-06, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

I wonder when ChatGPT or Claude.ai will compete with Wikipedia. I think Wikipedia is great but it has always had a weakness in that it can be manipulated to tell a story from a very limited point of view. For example the RSS page has a long section explaining the benefits of Atom. What I like about the AI versions of the basic history of things is that it isn't so easily manipulated. I talked about this with Claude, and asked it to write up a <a href="https://this.how/claudewiki/">proposal for ClaudeWiki</a>, a Wikipedia workalike, not too expensive to run, make it part of a user's $20 per month subscription. I think it would be useful, if only as a demo how Wikipedia itself might improve its service.

If I were designing a social network, I would implement replies differently. When you reply to a post, only the person who wrote the post sees it. If they want they can RT it. The way it works now on all twitter-like systems means most of the replies are basically spam, people using your post as a way to reach people who follow you.

BTW, when you post something on Bluesky it's just a tweet. These things don't need different names on each platform.

I like people who stand up and speak the truth. This is one of the silver linings of this crisis. There's no real advantage at this point in trying to play it safe, to not be noticed. So I like what Chris Murphy, Senator from Connecticut has been saying.

I used to tell friends you can't go wrong buying the S&P 500. The president is rated by now the stock market does, and so over the long haul you can expect steady growth from the S&P 500, and it keeps things really simple. Well, have to say -- that's no longer good advice. Maybe real estate? Outside the United States? I don't know. It depends on what the people of this country do, and if our representatives are listening.
