failing</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-14, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p><em>This post was updated at 11:16 p.m.</em> UCLA has spent at least
$213 million on the Ascend Finance Transformation project, and yet,
seven years after the project’s launch, it has few concrete
accomplishments.   “I can’t say that I’ve actually seen a live screen
for Ascend,” said Reem Hanna-Harwell, a former member of the project’s
steering committee.  The initial reported budget for the project was
$120 million, but, according to a presentation given during the May 2024
Ascend 2.0 quarterly town hall, the estimated total cost was projected
to be roughly $286 million.  The university declined to answer exactly
how much money has been spent on the project since its official start
date in April 2018.  The Ascend project involves a transformation of
UCLA’s financial system – moving from the current mainframe system to
Oracle Cloud, modernizing the chart of accounts and upgrading all
business applications which contribute data to the central finance,
research and budget systems, according to the 2021 project charter.</p>

members from USC for the Kill the Cuts rally in Downtown Los
Angeles—part of a National Day of Action opposing proposed federal cuts
to scientific research funding. From undergraduate students to postdocs,
organizers, and union representatives, our presence at the protest was
unified, urgent, and unrelenting.</p>

<p>At Caltech, student-athletes aren’t just competing—they are
redefining what it means to balance intensity in both sports and
academics. They exhibit not only commitment but a certain kind of mental
toughness and passionate energy to their teams and to the Caltech
community. Here’s the latest from Caltech Athletics, highlighting the
records, rivalries, and relentless drive that define our teams. With the
spring quarter underway, our Caltech athletics have achieved like never

Squirrels</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-12, from: California Tech (Caltech Student

<p>Among the mammals of Caltech, they’re arguably the happiest and
freest. While <em>Homo sapiens</em> are burdened with homework and
deadlines, and coyotes stick to moonlit hours to avoid the crowd, the
fox squirrels roam wherever their paws take them. Stroll across campus
and you’re guaranteed to spot one: foraging randomly in the grass (no,
they don’t remember where they bury their nuts), lounging on a branch,
or chasing a friend in spirals around tree trunks, like a dazzling
ribbon in the hand of a gymnast. Even if you don’t see one, just look
up: the treetops are decorated with their nests, ready for year-round
breeding.</p>

<p>Remakes don’t usually excite me as the core mechanics and plot are
usually the same as the original, just with better graphics. Unless a
remake is practically an entirely new game—think <em>Final Fantasy
VII</em> remake I don’t have any interest in buying it as it’s
incredibly likely that one could emulate the original <em>Dragon Quest
I</em> and <em>II</em> with little issue. That seems to be the case here
and with other remakes announced. It looks pretty, though.</p>

<p>date: 2025-05-12, from: California Tech (Caltech Student
Newspaper)</p>
<p>Hello everyone, my name is Camilla Fezzi, and you probably know me,
always running around, without any free time, and I am kind of
recognizable because of my Italian (fashion style) 😜. I’m a freshman at
Caltech, with the goal of double majoring in biology and chemistry and
dreaming, one day, of becoming a doctor and researcher in the
oncology/neuroscience field. But before I am any of those things, I am
Italian—a daughter, a sister, a friend. I grew up beneath the Verona
sun, in a place where the dinner table is sacred and where family is the
compass that guides everything. I have always known warmth—of
home-cooked meals, of laughter echoing through ancient streets, of a
mother’s arms around my shoulders. I know what it is to feel safe, to
take fresh water and a doctor’s appointment for granted.</p>

Uncertainty at NSF</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-12, from: California Tech (Caltech Student
Newspaper)</p>
<p>According to the lawsuit, a reduction in the NSF indirect cost rate
to 15% would result in an “annual loss of approximately $14.8 million to
Caltech’s planned research budget.” An awarded grant consists of direct
costs, which fund the research itself, and indirect costs, an added
percentage that covers overhead such as infrastructure and
administration. Caltech currently has 210 active awards and subawards
from NSF. In Fiscal Year 2024, the Institute spent over $93 million on
NSF-supported research, including nearly $22 million in indirect
costs.</p>

<p>If you stroll past the Olive Walk on a sunny Pasadena day, you might
see something magical in the air. Is it the scent of freshly pranked
upperclassmen? The echo of the Fleming cannon? Or perhaps it’s just the
spirit of Caltech’s brand of wizardry—a house system that would make
even J.K. Rowling jealous. At Caltech, the hallowed tradition of
“houses” isn’t just about where you sleep; it’s about forging family,
engineering pranks, and unleashing a level of creativity that would make
even Dumbledore drop his lemon drop.</p>

<p>date: 2025-05-12, from: California Tech (Caltech Student
Newspaper)</p>
<p>It is no secret that America’s leadership in science and technology
was not born by accident—it was built through public investment, public
partnerships with academia, and government sanction of private sector
monopoly. From the Apollo program to the Human Genome Project, from the
internet to the transistor, the United States once treated research and
development (R&amp;D) as a cornerstone of national security and economic
strength. For some time the facade has been quietly crumbling away, but
last week’s FY2026 Discretionary Budget Request rocked the foundations
of that legacy hard enough to bring down its edifice.</p>

<p>Last Saturday, the delicious scent of crème brûlée and chocolate
croissants wafted through the alleys of Blacker Hovse. Moles hurried
around the Hovse, tidying up their courtyard and dining hall for their
annual Interhovse. The theme? The French Revolution. After months of
preparation—with input from what felt like the entire Hovse—a production
worthy of that era’s dynamism and ingenuity came together marvelously,
complete with a panoply of renegade constructions and toothsome
dishes.</p>

<p>date: 2025-05-12, from: California Tech (Caltech Student
Newspaper)</p>
<p>As I lean over my desk, slumped between piles of textbooks and
scrawled notes, the weight of my schoolwork drags down my mind. The
pressure to excel academically and carve out a niche in the competitive
university environment sometimes becomes overwhelming. Yet amidst the
chaos of deadlines and exams, an old song unexpectedly pierces the
drudgery. The rich, sweeping sounds of “Belle” from Beauty and the Beast
sweep me, in the blink of an eye, from the chill of my dorm room to one
of wonder and magic. In an instant, I am no longer a struggling student
trying to find her place, but a capable, independent young woman,
venturing out into the world’s possibilities. The burden of academic
intensity and the pressure to conform to societal norms melt away,
replaced by a sense of empowerment, joy, and pure fantasy.</p>

<p>Watching William Shakespeare’s <em>Twelfth Night</em> is always a
delve into the delightful confusion between desire, identity, and
illusion, in a dramatic comedy that plays with what we feel and how we
show ourselves. In the production directed by Miranda Stewart, presented
at the Ramo Auditorium between April 25th and 27th by EXPLiCIT
(EXtracurricular PLayers at the California Institute of Technology—the
‘i’ is imaginary), the 1601 classic from the Elizabethan era gains new
life with freshness, rhythm and a staging that honors the carnival
spirit of the work without losing its emotional depth.</p>
