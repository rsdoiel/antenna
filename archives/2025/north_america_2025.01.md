## Could bird flu pandemic 'dwarf' COVID-19?

date: 2025-01-09, from: VOA News USA

For the first time, a person in the United States has died after being infected with the bird flu. Louisiana health officials reported the death on Monday. The World Health Organization says the risk of infection for the general population remains low, but as VOA’s Dora Mekouar reports, some medical experts are still sounding the alarm.

The preliminary estimates suggest emissions fell by just 0.2% last year. In other words, they were basically flat. That’s good news in the sense that emissions didn’t <em><em>rise</em></em>, even as the economy grew by an estimated 2.7%. But it’s also a little worrying given that in 2023, emissions dropped by 3.3%.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Rhodium Group, EPA</small></p><p>The transportation, power, and buildings sectors all saw upticks in emissions last year. But there are some bright spots in the report. Emissions fell across the industrial sector (down 1.8%) and oil and gas sector (down 3.7%). Solar and wind power generation surpassed coal for the first time, and coal production fell by 12% to its lowest level in decades, resulting in fewer industrial methane emissions. Still, “the modest 2024 decline underscores the urgency of accelerating decarbonization in all sectors,” Rhodium’s report concluded. “To meet its Paris Agreement target of a 50-52% reduction in emissions by 2030, the U.S. must sustain an ambitious 7.6% annual drop in emissions from 2025 to 2030, a level the U.S. has not seen outside of a recession in recent memory.”</p><h3>3.

## President Jimmy Carter’s economic plea to the American people

## Jimmy Carter's woodworking, painting and poetry reveal introspective Renaissance Man

date: 2025-01-09, from: VOA News USA

PLAINS, Ga. — The world knew Jimmy Carter as a president and humanitarian, but he also was a woodworker, painter and poet, creating a body of artistic work that reflects deeply personal views of the global community — and himself. 


His portfolio illuminates his closest relationships, his spartan sensibilities and his place in the evolution of American race relations. And it continues to improve the finances of The Carter Center, his enduring legacy. 


Creating art provided “the rare opportunity for privacy” in his otherwise public life, Carter said. “These times of solitude are like being in another very pleasant world.” 


‘One of the best gifts of my life’ 


Mourners at Carter’s hometown funeral will see the altar cross he carved in maple and collection plates he turned on his lathe. Great-grandchildren in the front pews at Maranatha Baptist Church slept as infants in cradles he fashioned. 


The former president measured himself a “fairly proficient” craftsman. Chris Bagby, an Atlanta woodworker whose shop Carter frequented, elevated that assessment to “rather accomplished.” 


Carter gleaned the basics on his father’s farm, where the Great Depression meant being a jack-of-all-trades. He learned more in shop class and with Future Farmers of America. “I made a miniature of the White House,” he recalled, insisting it was not about his ambitions. 


During his Navy years, Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter chose unfurnished military housing to stretch his $300 monthly wage, and he built their furniture himself in a shop on base. 


As president, Carter nurtured woodworking rather than his golf game, spending hours in a wood shop at Camp David to make small presents for family and friends. And when he left the White House, West Wing aides and Cabinet members pooled money for a shopping spree at Sears, Roebuck & Co. so he could finally assemble a full-scale home woodshop. 


“One of the best gifts of my life,” Carter said. 


Working in their converted garage, he previewed decades of Habitat for Humanity work by refurbishing their one-story house in Plains. He also improved his fine woodworking skills, joining wood without nails or screws. He also bought Japanese carving tools, and fashioned a chess set later owned by a Saudi prince. 


Not just any customer 


Carter frequented Atlanta’s Highland Woodworking, a shop replete with a library of how-to books and hard-to-find tools, and recruited the world’s preeminent handmade furniture maker, Tage Frid, as an instructor, Bagby said. 


Still hanging near the store entrance is a picture of Frid, who died in 2004, teaching students including a smiling former president at the front of the class. 


“He was like a regular customer,” Bagby said, other than the “Secret Service agents who came with him.” 


Carter built four ladder-back chairs out of hickory in 1983, and Sotheby’s auctioned them for $21,000 each at the time, the first of many sales of Carter paintings and furniture that raised millions to benefit The Carter Center. 


It was rarely about the money, though. Jill Stuckey, a longtime friend who would have the Carters over to her home in Plains, recalled seeing the former president carrying out one of her chairs. 


“I said, ‘What are you doing?’” she recalled. “He said, ‘It’s broken. I’m going to take it home and fix it.’” 


He was at her back door at 7:30 the next morning, holding her repaired chair. 


Carter compared woodworking to the results of his labor as a Navy engineer, or as a boy on the farm: “I like to see what I have done, what I have made.” 


‘No special talent,’ but his paintings drive auctions 


Carter employed a folk-art style as a late-in-life amateur painter and claimed “no special talent,” but a 2020 Carter Center auction drew $340,000 for his painting titled “Cardinals,” and his oil-on-canvas of an eagle sold for $225,000 in 2023, months after he entered hospice care. 


Carter’s work hangs throughout the center’s campus. A room where he met with dignitaries is encircled with birds he painted after he and Rosalynn took on bird watching as a hobby. 


Near the executive offices are a self-portrait and a painting of Rosalynn in their early post-presidential years, hanging across from a trio of Andy Warhol prints showing Carter in office. 


Carter’s earliest years predominate, with boyhood farm scenes and portraits of influential figures like his father James Earl Carter Sr., whose death in 1953 led him to abandon a Navy career and eventually enter politics in Georgia. 


Some of his subjects, including both of his parents, are looking away. Carter's likeness of his mother shows “Miss Lillian” as a 70-year-old Peace Corps volunteer in India. Jason Carter said the piece was particularly meaningful to his grandfather, who lost reelection at a relatively youthful 56. 


“When he got out of the White House, she was standing there saying, ’Well, I turned 70 in the Peace Corps. What are you going to do?” Jason Carter said. 


One Carter subject who meets his gaze is a young Rosalynn — they married when she was 18 and he was 21. He described her as “remarkably beautiful, almost painfully shy, obviously intelligent, and yet unrestrained in our discussions.” 


Another who doesn’t look away is Rachel Clark, a Black sharecropper who had hosted the future president after they worked in the fields. “Except for my parents, Rachel Clark was the person closest to me,” Carter wrote of his childhood. 


‘Just a word of praise’ 


Carter wrote more than 30 books — even a novel — but was most introspective in poetry. 


On his first real recognition of Jim Crow segregation: “A silent line was drawn between friend and friend, race and race.” 


On his Cold War submarine’s delicate dance with enemies: “We wanted them to understand ... to share our love of solitude ... the peace we yearned to keep.” 


Rosalynn’s smile, he gushed, silenced the birds, “or may be I failed to hear their song.” 


Perhaps Carter’s most revealing poem, “I Wanted to Share My Father’s World,” concerns the man who never got to see his namesake son’s achievements. He wrote that he despised Earl’s discipline, and swallowed hunger for “just a word of praise.” 


Only when he brought his own sons to visit his dying father did he “put aside the past resentments of the boy” and see “the father who will never cease to be alive in me.”

## Schools cancel classes across Southern US as another burst of winter storms move in

date: 2025-01-09, from: VOA News USA

Dallas, Texas — Schools and buildings from Texas to Georgia were shut down Thursday or prepared to close ahead of freezing rain and snow forecast for much of the Southern U.S. as another burst of plunging temperatures and winter storms threatened to again snarl travel. 


Texas schools canceled classes for more than 1 million students in anticipation of icy and potentially dangerous conditions that could last into Friday. Closures also kept students home in Kansas City and Arkansas' capital, Little Rock, while Virginia's capital, Richmond, remained under a weather-related boil advisory. 


The cold snap coincided with rare January wildfires tearing through the Los Angeles area, forcing residents to flee from burning homes through flames, ferocious winds and towering clouds of smoke. 


Texas braces for snow 


In the Dallas area, crews treated roads ahead of the expected Thursday arrival of about 5 to 10 centimeters of snow. Up to 12.7 centimeters was expected farther north near Oklahoma, according to the National Weather Service. 


Gov. Greg Abbott said the state deployed emergency crews in advance and urged residents to avoid driving in bad weather if possible. 


Boston native Gina Eaton, who stocked up on groceries in Dallas ahead of the storm, said she has some trepidation sharing roads with drivers unaccustomed to ice and snow. 


“Even if there is ice, I’m very comfortable driving in it,” Eaton said. “It’s just other people that scare me.” 


Roads could be slick Friday as 75,000 fans were expected head to AT&T Stadium in Arlington for the college football championship semifinal between Texas and Ohio State in the Cotton Bowl. Arlington spokesperson Susan Shrock said crews will be ready to address any hazardous road conditions. 


Southern discomfort 


A mix of sleet, snow and freezing rain was expected along a stretch from New Mexico to Alabama. Forecasters said the heaviest amounts were likely in parts of Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas. 


The system was expected to push northeastward by Friday with heavy snow and freezing rain all the way to the Virginia and North Carolina coasts. As much as about 20 centimeters of snow could fall in parts of Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee and West Virginia through Saturday, the weather service said. 


Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp announced the closure of some state offices on Friday. Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens said city offices would be closed, with employees working remotely. 


Tennessee Emergency Management Agency Director Patrick Sheehan said he expected schools across the state to close Friday, although decisions will be made at the local level. 


The polar vortex of ultra-cold air usually spins around the North Pole, but it sometimes ventures south into the U.S., Europe and Asia. Some experts say such events are happening more frequently, paradoxically, because of a warming world. 


The agricultural impact 


Some parts of Kansas have received nearly an entire year's average of snow over the past few days, hitting farmers and ranchers “in ways that we haven't seen in this area for a very, very long time, potentially a lifetime,” said Chip Redmond, a meteorologist at Kansas State University. 


Calves are especially at risk and can die when temperatures slip below zero. And so much snow in rural areas can keep farmers from reaching herds with food and water 


In northern Florida, growers were most concerned about ferns that are cultivated for floral arrangements, with Valentine's Day only a month away.

## Former President Jimmy Carter to be honored at Washington funeral

date: 2025-01-09, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter is set to be honored Thursday with a funeral at Washington National Cathedral before being buried in his home state of Georgia.


Carter’s living presidential successors – Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Donald Trump and Joe Biden – are due to attend the Washington funeral, with Biden delivering a eulogy.


Mourners from the public were able to pay their final respects overnight at the U.S. Capitol, where Carter’s casket lay in state since Tuesday.




David Smith, a professor at the Carter School for Peace and Conflict Resolution at George Mason University, said the former president obviously impacted his career. He told VOA that he came to the Capitol to honor the man but also to honor Carter’s causes.


"He had such an impact on so many people," he said. "His work on advancing minorities, appointments of women to the judiciary, protecting our environment, advocating for human rights – all those things are very important things to me."


In the Capitol rotunda – where only about 50 Americans have been recognized with this distinct honor since 1852 – Senate Majority Leader Jon Thune, in a service late Tuesday, described Carter as: "Navy veteran, peanut farmer, governor of Georgia. And president of the United States. Sunday school teacher. Nobel Prize winner. Advocate for peace and human rights. And first and foremost, a faithful servant of his creator and his fellow man."


Vice President Kamala Harris – who on Monday in the Capitol certified the victory of the next president – extolled Carter’s policy.


"He was the first president of the United States to have a comprehensive energy policy, including providing some of the first federal support for clean energy," she said Tuesday. "He also passed over a dozen major pieces of legislation regarding environmental protection. And more than doubled the size of America's national parks."




Carter, who served as the 39th president, died Dec. 29 at the age of 100 after nearly two years in hospice care in the state of Georgia. Since then, his final journey has taken his remains over the skinny roads of his humble hometown of Plains; down the boulevards of Atlanta, the state capital, and through the skies to snowy Washington, for his state funeral.


At the U.S. Capitol, lawmakers told VOA what the 39th president meant to them.


Congresswoman Alma Adams, a North Carolina Democrat, said Carter was "a real moral person."


"He taught Sunday school – I did, too!" she said, smiling. "But I think (it’s) the fact that he cared about all people. He was a people’s president."


South Carolina Republican Representative Ralph Norman told VOA that while he did not align with Carter politically, "President Carter was a good man. President Carter was a man who served his country. He loved America. I didn’t agree with all of his policies, but you couldn’t (dis)agree with his patriotism, you couldn’t disagree. He just loved his country."


In late December, after receiving news of Carter’s death, Biden said, "We may never see his like again. You know we can all do well to try to be a little more like Jimmy Carter."


Analysts say the two men have a few things in common.


"There's an obvious similarity; that is, that Carter turned out to be a one-term president, and Biden turned out to be a one-term president," Bill Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told VOA on Zoom. "And that's never a reflection of the right combination of politics and policy. In both cases, I would say that the two presidents put the policy ahead of the politics. And they paid the price for that."


When asked what Carter and Trump have in common, Galston paused.


"I don't even know how to begin to answer that question," he said finally. "The two are polar opposites in every respect that I can think of, except one. And that is, they both attained the presidency as outsiders."

## Thousands more ordered to evacuate as Los Angeles wildfires spread

date: 2025-01-09, from: VOA News USA

More than 130,000 people in the Los Angeles area were under evacuation orders early Thursday as firefighters battled multiple major wildfires that already killed at least five people and destroyed more than 1,000 structures.


A new, fast-moving fire broke out late Wednesday in the Hollywood Hills, prompting the latest round of orders for people to flee to safety.


Meteorologists said the dry conditions and strong winds conducive to the breakout and spread of the fires are expected to remain in place through Friday.


High wind gusts had forced the grounding of planes used to help fight the fires, but officials said Wednesday the winds had eased enough for those operations to resume.


“Tonight, we have very mild wind conditions where we can get aircraft and a ton of additional resources getting their hands around this fire,” Pasadena Fire Chief Chad Augustine said. “That’s what gives me confidence that we’re going to get a handle on this fire.”




U.S. President Joe Biden has approved a federal emergency declaration for California to release federal money and resources to help battle the wildfires.


The White House said late Wednesday that Biden canceled a planned trip to Italy so that he can “remain focused on directing the full federal response in the days ahead.”


“We are prepared to do everything and anything, as long as it takes, to contain these fires and help reconstruct and make sure we get back to normal. It’s going to be a hell of a long way,” Biden said Wednesday. “It’s going to take time.”


The Defense Department pledged to provide “additional firefighting personnel and capabilities” to California.


While authorities had warned of the potential for wildfires in the Los Angeles area given the conditions this week, the blazes were more extensive than anticipated.


“The L.A. County Fire Department was prepared for one or two major brush fires, but not four, especially given these sustained winds and low humidities,” L.A. County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said Wednesday.


In addition to the Hollywood area, there were active fires in Pacific Palisades, Altadena, Pasadena and Sylmar.




Thousands of hectares have burned, and the fire is continuing to spread.


“We have no percentage of containment,” Marrone said.


Two thousand National Guard members have been deployed to help local firefighters.




In Pacific Palisades, the fire jumped from one house to the next, pushed by hurricane-force winds. In the same area, firefighters said hydrants had run dry.


“We had a tremendous demand on our system in the Palisades,” said Janisse Quiñones, chief executive and chief engineer of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. “We pushed the system to the extreme.”



The call for water was “four times the normal demand ... for 15 hours straight,” she added.


The fire in Pacific Palisades is the most destructive in the history of Los Angeles. With 1,000 structures burned to the ground, the Palisades fire surpasses the devastation of the 2008 Sayre Fire, which demolished 604 structures in a northern suburb of L.A.

## Could Los Angeles Burn to the Ground?

While the wildfires raging in Los Angeles County have already far exceeded that legendary bovine’s total attributed damage — at the time of this writing, five fires have <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/live/pacific-palisades-fire-updates-los-angeles" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>burned almost 16,000 acres</u></a> — the losses had centralized, at least initially, in the secluded neighborhoods and idyllic suburbs in the hills above the city. </p><p>On Wednesday, that started to change. Evacuation maps have since extended into <a href="https://x.com/AaronGuhreen/status/1877119700674469943" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the gridded streets of downtown Santa Monica</u></a> and Pasadena, and a new fire has started north of Beverly Hills, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-01-08/sunset-fire-hollywood-hills-evacuations-shelters-closures" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>moving quickly</u></a> toward an internationally recognizable street: Hollywood Boulevard. The two biggest fires, Palisades and Eaton, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/weather/live-news/los-angeles-pacific-palisades-eaton-wildfires-01-08-25/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>remain 0% contained</u></a>, and <a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/santa-ana-winds-climate-change" target="_self"><u>high winds</u></a> have stymied firefighting efforts, all leading to an exceedingly grim question: Exactly how much of Los Angeles could burn. Could <em><em>all of it?</em></em></p><p>“I hate to be doom and gloom, but if those winds kept up … it’s not unfathomable to think that the fires would continue to push into L.A. — into the city,” Riva Duncan, a former wildland firefighter and fire management specialist who now serves as the executive secretary of <a href="https://www.grassrootswildlandfirefighters.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Grassroots Wildland Firefighters</u></a>, an advocacy group, told me.</p><p>When a fire is burning in the chaparral of the hills, it’s one thing. But once a big fire catches in a neighborhood, it’s a different story. Houses, with their wood frames, gas lines, and <a href="https://gizmodo.com/cheap-plastic-filled-furniture-makes-it-easier-for-fir-5923299" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>cheap modern furniture</u></a>, might as well be Duraflame. <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/los-angeles-fires" target="_self"><u>Embers</u></a> from one burning house then leap to the next and alight in a clogged gutter or on <a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/how-to-protect-home-from-wildfire" target="_self"><u>shrubs planted too close</u></a> to vinyl siding. “That’s what happened with the Great Chicago Fire. When the winds push fires like that, it’s pushing the embers from one house to the others,” Duncan said. “It’s a really horrible situation, but it’s not unfathomable to think about that [happening in L.A.] — but people need to be thinking about that, and I know the firefighters are thinking about that.”</p><p>Once flames engulf a block, it will “overpower” the capabilities of firefighters, Arnaud Trouvé, the chair of the Department of Fire Protection Engineering at the University of Maryland, told me in an email. If firefighters can’t gain a foothold, the fire will continue to spread “until a change in driving conditions,” such as the winds weakening to the point that a fire isn’t igniting new fuel or its fuel source running out entirely, when it reaches something like an expansive parking lot <a href="https://x.com/latimes/status/1876851290107412817" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>or the ocean</u></a>.</p><p>This waiting game sometimes leads to the impression that firefighters are standing around, not doing anything. But “what I know they’re doing is they’re looking ahead to places where maybe there’s a park, or some kind of green space, or a shopping center with big parking lots — they’re looking for those places where they could make a stand,” Duncan told me. If an entire city block is <em><em>already</em></em> on fire, “they’re not going to waste precious water there.”</p><p>Urban firefighting is a different beast than wildland firefighting, but Duncan noted that Forest Service, CALFIRE, and L.A. County firefighters are used to complex mixed environments. “This is their backyard, and they know how to fight fire there.”</p><p>“I can guarantee you, many of them haven’t slept 48 hours,” she went on. “They’re grabbing food where they can; they’re taking 15-minute naps. They’re in this really horrible smoke — there are toxins that come off burning vehicles and burning homes, and wildland firefighters don’t wear breathing apparatus to protect the airways. I know they all have horrible headaches right now and are puking. I remember those days.”</p><p>If there’s a sliver of good news, it’s that the biggest fire, Palisades, can’t burn any further to the west, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/08/weather/los-angeles-fire-maps-california.html#:~:text=Wind%20data%20as%20of%20Jan.%208%20at%2012%20p.m." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the direction the wind is blowing</u></a> — there lies the ocean — meaning its spread south into Santa Monica toward Venice and Culver City or Beverly Hills is slower than it would be if the winds shifted. The westward-moving Santa Ana winds, however, could conceivably fan the Eaton fire deeper into eastern Los Angeles if conditions don’t let up soon. “In many open fires, the most important factor is the wind,” Trouvé explained, “and the fire will continue spreading until the wind speed becomes moderate-to-low.”</p><p>Relief is supposed to begin Wednesday night, meaning firefighters will have a crucial opportunity to gain a foothold — an opportunity that will increase after the red flag warning <a href="https://www.sanluisobispo.com/news/weather-news/article298213423.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>expires on Friday</u></a>. But “there are additional winds coming next week,” Kristen Allison, a fire management specialist with the Southern California Geographic Area Coordination Center, <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/los-angeles-fire-preparedness" target="_self"><u>told me earlier today</u></a>. “It’s going to be a long duration — and we’re not seeing any rain anytime soon.”</p>

## It’s Time to Recruit the Rich

But once we get the mockery out of our systems, perhaps we should approach Mr. Wasserman and his like-minded peers with a more open heart, and see this particular disaster as an opportunity to convince more people like him that we’re all in the path of the same threats. </p><p>Because like it or not, addressing climate change requires the help of the wealthy — not just a small number of megadonors to environmental organizations, but the rich as a class. The more they understand that their money will not insulate them from the effects of a warming planet, the more likely they are to be allies in the climate fight, and vital ones at that.</p><p>As of this writing the fires in Los Angeles are still burning, but it <a href="https://www.cnn.com/weather/live-news/los-angeles-pacific-palisades-eaton-wildfires-01-08-25/index.html?t=1736358986008" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>already appears</u></a> that they could be among the costliest in history, not because of their size but because they are reducing some of the priciest real estate in America to ashes. It’s another vivid lesson in a truth more people need to learn: Climate change will affect everyone, no matter how much money you have. </p><p>Yes, those most affected will be people without resources, who live in vulnerable areas they can’t easily flee, and who are unable to harden their homes and communities against the most destructive effects of warming. Those with the lowest incomes <a href="https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2021-09/climate-vulnerability_september-2021_508.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>feel the brunt</u></a> of climate change in multiple ways. </p><p>But there’s a difference between being less vulnerable and being invulnerable. There are only so many times you can rebuild your beach house, only so many private firefighters you can hire, and only so often you can turn up the air conditioning. We saw in Asheville how a place <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/09/nx-s1-5137024/climate-haven-hurricane-helene-asheville" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>believed</u></a> to be a “climate haven” turned out to be just as susceptible to natural disaster as anywhere else. In the end, climate change comes for us all. And experiencing a climate-related event <a href="https://epic.uchicago.edu/insights/2024-poll-americans-views-on-climate-change-and-policy-in-12-charts/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has a significant impact</u></a> on whether people both accept the reality of climate change and prioritize it as a political issue.</p><p>The more wealthy people believe that climate change is a threat to them and support policies that mitigate emissions, the better the chances that those policies will be translated into law. A <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/testing-theories-of-american-politics-elites-interest-groups-and-average-citizens/62327F513959D0A304D4893B382B992B" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>number</u></a> of <a href="https://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/jnd260/cab/CAB2012%20-%20Page1.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>studies</u></a> by political scientists in recent years have shown that the policy preferences of the wealthy are more likely to prevail; it’s one of those findings that no one is surprised by, but it’s useful to have it demonstrated empirically. The wealthy are more politically active, donate more money, and are generally treated by politicians as though they cannot be ignored. </p><p>So while mass mobilization is a key component of successful movements, it doesn’t hurt to have rich people on your side, too. Surveys already show that higher-income voters are somewhat <a href="https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/understanding-pro-climate-voters/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more likely</u></a> to support policies to address climate change, though the differences are not that large. And if increasing numbers of them decide that the government has to institute more climate-friendly policies, wealthier voters might even put pressure on the party that usually represents their interests as a class: the GOP.</p><p>Admittedly, getting the wealthy to unite with the rest of us in common purpose will not be easy. One of the primary functions of wealth is to insulate the privileged from negative externalities of existence, both large and small. It separates them from ordinary people and the ordinary headaches of life. The wealthy glide through the world as though on a moving walkway, exempted from having to wait in lines or get their hands dirty or spend time worrying about their vulnerability. And they often use their political influence to insulate themselves even further, advocating for policies that starve the government of funds and exacerbate inequality. </p><p>Moreover, disasters like the fires we’re seeing right now wind up being interpreted through existing political lenses; Donald Trump is blaming them on the governor of California, to whom he <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3lfausi5rsc2v" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>refers</u></a>, classy and mature as ever, as “Gavin Newscum,” while other conservatives are <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/public-safety-and-emergencies/natural-disasters/maga-actor-breaks-down-in-tears-as-he-reveals-home-destroyed-in-cali-fires/ar-AA1xbRCl" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>angrily denying</u></a> that warming temperatures had anything to do with the destruction in southern California. </p><p>Nevertheless, there’s room for a generous response, to say even to the wealthiest of victims that we’re sorry they suffered the consequences of warming and hope they’ll become allies in the fight against climate change, because we’re all in it together. We all need robust public infrastructure (including an effective fire department), along with policies that will make wildfires and other disasters less destructive. The more people who come into the tent — even if it was only once they had to flee a disaster they only thought would affect the little people — the better off we’ll be.</p>

## US to pledge $500M for Ukraine as Austin hosts his final Ramstein meeting

U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin held bilateral meetings Thursday with his Ukrainian and British counterparts Wednesday before hosting the Ukraine Defense Contact Group one last time. VOA Pentagon correspondent Carla Babb is traveling with Austin as the U.S. is expected to announce its final military aid package for Kyiv under the Biden administration.

## Ex-FBI informant who made up claims about Bidens sentenced to 6 years

date: 2025-01-09, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — A former FBI informant who admitted lying about U.S. President Joe Biden and son Hunter Biden’s interactions with a Ukrainian energy company was sentenced to six years in prison Wednesday, court records showed. 


Alexander Smirnov pleaded guilty last month of causing the creation of a false record after falsely telling his FBI handler that he had knowledge of bribes paid by executives at Burisma Holdings to Joe and Hunter Biden, according to court documents. 


Hunter Biden served on the board of Burisma, a role that has attracted years of scrutiny from Republican lawmakers. 


Smirnov also admitted tax evasion. 


Prosecutors working with special counsel David Weiss, who investigated matters related to Hunter Biden, had asked U.S. District Judge Otis Wright in Los Angeles to sentence Smirnov to six years in federal prison. 


“The defendant decided in 2020 to exploit the position of trust he enjoyed with the FBI in order to provide false information about one of the candidates for president of the United States in an attempt to influence the outcome of the election,” prosecutors wrote in a court filing, referring to Joe Biden’s 2020 campaign. 


Lawyers for Smirnov sought a four-year prison sentence, arguing Smirnov had accepted responsibility and suffered a “personal downfall” resulting from the case. 


Smirnov falsely claimed in conversations with the FBI that executives at Burisma told him in 2015 or 2016, while Joe Biden was vice president, that they'd hired Hunter Biden to "protect us, through his dad, from all kinds of problems."  


Smirnov also fabricated a claim that Joe and Hunter Biden were each paid $5 million in bribes from Burisma executives, according to court documents. 


Republican lawmakers learned of an FBI record documenting Smirnov’s claims, which briefly became a focus of a since-abandoned effort to impeach Joe Biden. 


Weiss, the special counsel, also brought two criminal cases against Hunter Biden on tax and gun charges. Joe Biden issued a sweeping pardon for his son last month, ending both prosecutions.

## US to pledge $500M for Ukraine at Ramstein meeting

date: 2025-01-09, from: VOA News USA

RAMSTEIN AIR BASE, GERMANY — The United States is providing Ukraine with $500 million in additional weapons and equipment from its existing military stockpiles, in what officials told VOA will be the final military aid package before President Joe Biden leaves office.

The officials were speaking to VOA on condition of anonymity ahead of the announcement, which is expected Thursday when U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin hosts the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in Ramstein, Germany, for the last time.

"Our focus will be on maintaining momentum, delivering results, and sending a clear message: The international community stands resolute in its support for Ukraine," Austin said.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced that he will join Austin at the 25th meeting of the group, which comprises about 50 nations that came together under Austin's leadership to coordinate security assistance following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

"They [Ukrainians] continue to survive, but they do that with the support of the U.S. and other allied countries and coalitions through the Ukraine Defense Contact Group. And I think it's pretty clear that the Ukraine Defense Contact Group is, it's more than just a common understanding. It's a common cause," Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said Wednesday.

As Ukrainians fight to survive, that common cause to support their fight is shrouded in uncertainty. President-elect Donald Trump has not indicated whether he will continue America's leadership of the group when President Biden leaves office on Jan. 20, and current administration officials and defense analysts warn that could prove catastrophic for Kyiv.

Bradley Bowman, senior director of the Center on Military and Political Power at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said that Trump, who has been very critical of the Biden administration's handling of Afghanistan, would not want to see a similar humanitarian crisis "on his record."

"If you have a major curtailment or end of U.S. support for Ukraine, then you could have a major disaster in Ukraine," he told VOA.

Rather than cut Kyiv's lifeline, Bowman said, the U.S. should surge support to Ukraine in the first months of the new administration "to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position" ahead of any peace negotiations.

There is still $3.8 billion in approved funds for Ukraine that was passed by Congress in April, but the Pentagon says it can't send that aid at this time because it needs additional funds from Congress to restock its own supplies.

While analysts point to the Ukraine Defense Contact Group as a high point of Austin's legacy, funding delays from Congress and deliberations within the Biden administration on what weapons to give Kyiv have hampered Ukraine's fight.

Bowman says that too often, when Ukraine asked for something, the Biden administration told them "no," then "maybe," before finally saying, "yes."

"During that time period, we saw Russians advancing, Ukrainians dying and the delay being costly," he said.

Since Russia's invasion in 2022, the group of about 50 nations has provided Kyiv with more than $126 billion in weapons, training and equipment. The U.S. has provided about $66 billion, slightly more than half of the group's aid.

Officials said the administration hoped the latest aid package, along with other commitments from the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, could put Kyiv in a stronger negotiating position. They also told reporters that at least 80% of the American weapons and equipment promised to Kyiv from U.S. stockpiles would reach Ukraine before Biden left office. One notable exception, a senior defense official said, was a group of military vehicles that were still being refurbished to be used on the battlefield.

VOA National Security Correspondent Jeff Seldin contributed to this report.

## US port strike averted as 45,000 union workers, employers reach deal

date: 2025-01-09, from: VOA News USA

The union representing 45,000 dock workers on the U.S. East and Gulf Coasts and their employers on Wednesday said they reached a tentative deal on a new six-year contract, averting further strikes that could have snarled supply chains and taken a toll on the U.S. economy.


The International Longshoremen's Association and the United States Maritime Alliance employer group, in a joint statement, called the agreement a win-win. The deal includes a resolution in automation, which had been the thorniest issue on the table.


"This agreement protects current ILA jobs and establishes a framework for implementing technologies that will create more jobs while modernizing East and Gulf coast ports – making them safer and more efficient and creating the capacity they need to keep our supply chains strong," the groups said.


Terms of the deal were not disclosed.


The talks had been extended until Jan. 15 to reach a deal on automation. Shipping industry executives, customers and analysts had been concerned that the parties would be unable to overcome their impasse, leading to a second ILA strike just days before President-elect Donald Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration.


A three-day ILA strike in October had triggered a surge in shipping prices and cargo backlogs at the 36 affected ports. Longshoremen returned to work after employers agreed to a 62% wage increase over the next six years.


Employers at the ports stretching from Maine to Texas include terminal operators like APM, owned by Danish container carrier Maersk, as well as the U.S. arms of other major carriers like China's COSCO Shipping and Switzerland's MSC.


ILA and USMX have agreed to continue operating under the current contract until the union can meet with its full Wage Scale Committee and schedule a ratification vote, and USMX members can ratify the terms of the final contract.

## What the L.A. Fires Are Doing to the City’s Air

date: 2025-01-09, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTUwNjEyOS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4NTA1ODUyMX0.q0-Z6HACO_yD9gA9ia2aGAw7ANtCNe-KxSgOz1Ifzu8/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p>Wildfires have been raging across Los Angeles County since Tuesday morning, but only in the past 24 hours or so has the city’s air quality begun to suffer. </p>
<p>That’s because of the classic path of the Santa Ana winds, Alistair Hayden, a public health professor at Cornell who studies how wildfire smoke affects human health, told me. “Yesterday, it looked like the plumes [from the Palisades fire] were all blowing out to sea, which I think makes sense with the Santa Ana wind patterns blowing to the southwest,” Hayden said.</p>
<p>But with the Eaton fire now raging near Pasadena, northeast of Los Angeles, the air quality across large swaths of the city is deteriorating, Hayden said. That’s because the winds are now carrying a smoke plume as they travel down to the coast. And the situation is still changing rapidly.</p>
<p>At 6:30 p.m. Pacific time on Wednesday, the historic core of L.A. registered an air quality index of 105, according to <a href="https://fire.airnow.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the AirNow fire and smoke map</u></a>, part of the federal government’s national air quality index. Anything over 100 is considered unhealthy for sensitive groups such as asthmatics. In Pasadena and East Los Angeles, the AQI was in the high 180s, 190s, and even the low 200s, which ranks as “unhealthy” or “very unhealthy” for everyone. </p>
<p>The AirNow map is a joint effort of the Interagency Wildland Fire Air Quality Response Program and the Environmental Protection Agency, incorporating smoke plume data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s satellites, Hayden said. </p>
<p>It also shows readings from the EPA’s permanent air quality monitors set up across Los Angeles. And it includes data from cheaper, commercial sensors — from manufacturers such as <a href="https://www2.purpleair.com/?srsltid=AfmBOooex-1UiEhfSNt76wdBklaOw9whEVb4IC4ZjsoaNAIHzYmK4rIr" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>PurpleAir</u></a> — that people can set up in their homes and backyards. The AirNow site also calibrates the data from those commercial sensors so that they can be more accurately compared to the government’s more robust and scientific air quality sensors. (Many websites that display the PurpleAir data do not calibrate the data in this way, he said, which can lead to faulty readings.)</p>
<p>In recent years, wildfire smoke <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/los-angeles-wildfire-smoke-study" target="_self"><u>has become a major driver</u></a> of America’s air pollution.</p>
<p>“We’ve been so successful that cleaning up our air through the Clean Air Act and other state-level activities that the air has been getting better for decades,” Hayden told me. “Now, with the growth of these huge wildfires emitting large amounts of pollution, that has undone some of the progress of all this awesome work over this past decade.</p>
<p>“It’s amazing what we can do when we choose to do so,” he said. “But it shows there’s more work needed to be done of how do we protect communities from this current and growing threat of not just wildfires, but the smoke from those wildfires as well.”</p>

## California’s Insurance Overhaul Came Too Late

	The massive wildfires in Pacific Palisades and Altadena in Southern California may deal a devastating blow to the state’s fragile home insurance market, which is in the midst of large-scale reforms as part of an effort to lure private insurers back to the state.
</p><p>
	In the years running up to yesterday’s, today’s, and <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-01-08/perilous-winds-will-continue-through-wednesday-fueling-destructive-l-a-fires" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>likely tomorrow’s</u></a> fires, several home insurers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/04/business/allstate-insurance-california.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>announced plans to stop writing new policies</u></a> in California, or <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2024-04-19/california-exodus-of-home-insurance-companies-continues" target="_blank"><u>even leave the state entirely</u></a>. The industry and many analysts blamed not just California’s famously hostile mix of dry vegetation, high winds, and scarce rains,<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-21/why-insurance-rates-have-been-surging-in-california-and-florida" target="_blank"> </a>but also a rise in construction and reinsurance costs and a regulatory system that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-21/why-insurance-rates-have-been-surging-in-california-and-florida" target="_blank"><u>made it difficult</u></a> for insurers to raise rates or think prospectively about risk when setting rates.</p><p>
	In other words, it was simply easier for insurers <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/california/article/home-insurance-nonrenewal-map-19589630.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>to not renew policies</u></a> than it was for them to increase rates to better adjust for risk. Some of these <a href="https://x.com/PplsCityCouncil/status/1876904641830465923" target="_blank"><u>non-renewals occurred in the area now affected by the Eaton Fire</u></a> in Altadena, though they were <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/california/article/home-insurance-nonrenewal-map-19589630.php" target="_blank"><u>most prevalent</u></a> in the Bay Area and the Sierra Nevada foothills.</p><p>
	In response, California’s insurance commissioner Ricardo Lara rolled out a set of reforms last year that<a href="https://www.insurance.ca.gov/0400-news/0100-press-releases/2024/release057-2024.cfm" target="_blank"> </a>tried to both <a href="https://www.insurance.ca.gov/0400-news/0100-press-releases/2024/release057-2024.cfm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>expand insurance in wildfire prone areas and lure insurers back to the state</u></a>. The new rules would allow insurers to use models to determine risk (not just historical data, as the law had previously been interpreted to allow) while also mandating that insurance companies operating in the state write policies in fire-prone areas as well as in those that are relatively safe. Lara then<a href="https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/west/2024/12/30/806461.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> </a>issued another rule late last year allowing insurers to <a href="https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/west/2024/12/30/806461.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>use the cost of reinsurance</u></a> in determining their rates, which insurers in the rest of the country <a href="https://www.capradio.org/articles/2024/12/30/california-will-soon-require-insurers-to-increase-home-coverage-in-wildfire-prone-areas/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>are allowed to do</u></a>.</p><p>
	Allstate, which announced in November, 2022 that it would stop writing new home insurance policies in California, said last spring that it was considering a return to the state based on the possibility of <a href="https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/news/catastrophe/allstate-says-it-is-considering-return-to-california-homeowners-insurance-market-486896.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>models being allowed for ratemaking</u></a>. At the end of last year, partly in response to the reforms, Farmers also said that it would restart writing new policies for some lines of business in California, and that it would increase the number of new homeowners <a href="https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/west/2024/12/11/804458.htm" target="_blank"><u>insurance policies it writes every month</u></a> after <a href="https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/west/2023/07/07/729194.htm" target="_blank"><u>instituting limits in 2023</u></a>. Last week, <a href="https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/news/catastrophe/verisk-submits-wildfire-model-under-new-ca-regulations-519343.aspx" target="_blank"><u>Verisk submitted a model</u></a> to project wildfire risk to the state for regulatory agency review for use in rate-setting.</p><p>
	Consumer advocates have warned that these rules would lead to increases in insurance rates. So has Lara’s predecessor, Dave Jones, who has been skeptical of trying to grow the private insurance market by giving it more flexibility to set rates without addressing the core issues of climate change and fire management policy.
</p><p>
	“In the long term, we’re not going to be able to ‘rate increase’ ourselves out of this problem,” he said in an <a href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/heres-why-you-cant-get-home-insurance-california" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>interview with the University of California</u></a>, pointing to Florida’s insurance problems as an example, despite the flexibility that insurers have in setting rates there. “In the short-and mid-term for California, giving insurers proposed higher rates will get them to start writing new insurance again — although many homes in the wildland urban interface will continue to face challenges. But in the longer term, higher rates alone are likely to be overwhelmed by the higher risks and losses from climate change<em><em> — </em></em>just like in Florida.”
</p><p>
	Like Florida, California has a backup for the private market, an insurer of last resort. And, like Florida, it’s been trying to make it smaller, to little avail. It may now be so large as to place the rest of the state at financial risk.
</p><p>
	California’s FAIR Plan is a fire insurance pool that all property and casualty insurers operating in the state contribute to in proportion to how much business they have in the state; homeowners turn to FAIR when they can’t get insurance otherwise. As the state has experienced massive wildfires and insurers have pulled out, the size of the FAIR Plan has ballooned, with exposure rising to $458 billion in 2024 from $153 billion in 2020, <a href="https://www.cfpnet.com/about-fair-plan/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>even as it explicitly says</u></a> that its “goal is attrition” (i.e. getting customers back on normal insurance plans).</p><p>
	“It’s a socialized cost,” Kate Gordon, the chief executive of California Forward, a policy nonprofit, and former advisor to Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm, told me. “We see more and more people switching to the FAIR plan. It’s getting massively oversubscribed. It’s going to hit some kind of wall at some point.”
</p><p>
	The communities with the most wildfire exposure for the insurer include vacation areas throughout the state such as Lake Arrowhead, Truckee, and Big Bear Lake, and affluent residential communities including Berkeley and the San Francisco suburb Orinda. They also include Pacific Palisades, the fifth most wildfire-exposed market for FAIR in Southern California, with some $5.9 billion of exposure.
</p><p>
	While the fires have yet to be substantially contained, let alone extinguished, and the damage has not yet been calculated, the still-raging fires will likely constitute a major hit to the FAIR Plan and California insurers. The number of residential FAIR policies in the Pacific Palisades zip code <a href="https://www.cfpnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CFP5yearPIFGrowthbyzipcodethrough09302024(Residential%20line)20241112v001.pdf" target="_blank"><u>grew by over 80% between 2023 and 2024</u></a>, and has quadrupled since 2020. The total financial exposure for residential insurance in Pacific Palisades doubled in the past year, growing to almost $3 billion. In one zipcode affected by the fire in Altadena, residential FAIR plan policies grew by over 40% since 2020, with around $950 million of total exposure.</p><p>
“As the risk of more climate change-intensified wildfires increases in California, a major wildfire in one geographical area concentrated with FAIR Plan-insured properties could overwhelm the FAIR Plan’s reserves and its capacity to quickly and fully pay consumers’ claims,” <a href="https://www.insurance.ca.gov/0250-insurers/0300-insurers/0200-bulletins/bulletin-notices-commiss-opinion/upload/BULLETIN_2024-8__RE_INSURER_RECOUPMENT_PROCEDURES_IN_THE_HIGHLY_UNLIKELY_EVENT_OF_ASSESSMENT_BY_THE_FAIR_PLAN.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Lara wrote in a bulletin in September</u></a>.
</p><p>Like other states with insurers of last resort, the FAIR Plan can seek cash from insurers — which could, <a href="https://www.insurance.ca.gov/0250-insurers/0300-insurers/0200-bulletins/bulletin-notices-commiss-opinion/upload/BULLETIN_2024-8__RE_INSURER_RECOUPMENT_PROCEDURES_IN_THE_HIGHLY_UNLIKELY_EVENT_OF_ASSESSMENT_BY_THE_FAIR_PLAN.pdf" target="_blank"><u>if the losses are large enough</u></a>, extract “temporary supplemental fees from their own policyholders,” according to new California insurance regulations. This would mean that Californians who <em><em>were</em></em> able to buy private insurance — because they don’t live in a region of the state that insurers have abandoned — could be on the hook for massive wildfire losses. While such an assessment has not occurred since 1994, Victoria Roach, the FAIR Plan’s president, warned in a hearing before the State Assembly last March that a major fire <a href="https://www.paloaltoonline.com/blogs/a-new-shade-of-green/2024/03/31/wildfires-are-putting-your-insurance-at-risk-heres-why/" target="_blank"><u>could knock out the plan’s reserves</u></a> and force it to go to insurers — and their policyholders — to shell out for the difference.</p>

## Biden signs emergency declaration for California wildfires

date: 2025-01-08, from: VOA News USA

U.S. President Joe Biden on Wednesday approved a federal emergency declaration for California that will release money and resources to battle the wildfires.


"We are prepared to do everything and anything, as long as it takes, to contain these fires and help reconstruct and make sure we get back to normal. It's gonna be a hell of a long way," Biden said. "It's gonna take time."


The U.S. Defense Department said Wednesday that "it will work to provide additional firefighting personnel and capabilities" to California for its battle against the out-of-control fires.


The total amount of damage from the wildfires could run between $52 billion and $57 billion or more in losses, according to an analysis by AccuWeather's Global Weather Center.


The Los Angeles County Fire Department faced four life-threatening wildfires that have killed at least five people, burned more than 1,100 buildings, and forced tens of thousands of people to evacuate.


"The L.A. County Fire Department was prepared for one or two major brush fires, but not four, especially given these sustained winds and low humidities," Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said Wednesday. The fires erupted in Pacific Palisades, Altadena, Pasadena and Sylmar.




Thousands of hectares have burned, and the fire is continuing to spread.


"We have no percentage of containment," Marrone said.


Officials have warned residents to pay attention to evacuation orders and leave when directed.


Two thousand National Guard members have been deployed to help local firefighters.


Fire hydrants run dry


In the Pacific Palisades, the fire jumped from one house to the next, pushed by hurricane-force winds. In the same area, firefighters said hydrants had run dry.


"We had a tremendous demand on our system in the Palisades," Janisse Quiñones said Wednesday. Quiñones is the chief executive and chief engineer of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. "We pushed the system to the extreme."


The call for water was "four times the normal demand ... for 15 hours straight," she added.




Later Wednesday, support aircraft that had been grounded by the strong winds were airborne again, dropping water and fire retardant on the fire.


The fire in the Pacific Palisades is the most destructive in the history of Los Angeles. With 1,000 structures burned to the ground, the Palisades fire surpasses the devastation of the 2008 Sayre Fire, which demolished 604 structures in a northern suburb of Los Angeles.


At least 70,000 evacuation orders are in effect for the fires. Most of them were issued for Pacific Palisades.




Three evacuation centers for people and 12 for animals have opened for those fleeing the fires, according to The Associated Press.


The Pasadena Convention Center had several hundred evacuees by Wednesday afternoon, including many elderly people from assisted living facilities. Donald Fisher, 78, said he was wheeled into the center Wednesday morning.


"I can stand up, but I can't walk," Fisher told the AP. "I think that the city of Pasadena did a marvelous job."


EJ Soto and her family were not so lucky. They fled their Altadena home early Wednesday and also sought shelter at the Pasadena Convention Center, but by the time they arrived, all the cots had been taken.


"I had one hour of sleep, so it's been a really bad, really bad day," Soto told the AP.




Meanwhile, poweroutage.us reported that there were more than 1.5 million customers without power across Southern California on Wednesday afternoon, as firefighters continued to try to bring the fires under control.


As a safety precaution, power companies will sometimes shut off the power when communities are battling extreme environmental conditions to prevent the equipment from sparking a fire.


Washington is supporting California's firefighting efforts with four U.S. Forest Service large air tankers and an additional tanker in on route. The federal government has also helped the firefighting efforts with 10 helicopters. Meanwhile, dozens of the Forest Service fire engines are ready to be deployed.

## The New Age of Wildfire Is Overwhelming America’s Clean Air

date: 2025-01-08, from: Heatmap News

It’s too soon to assess the overall pollution impacts from this rare January event, but we know the smoke is filled with tiny particles known as PM2.5, one of the most pernicious public health villains, associated with increased risk of respiratory and heart disease and premature death. </p><p>Last year, the Environmental Protection Agency <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/air-quality-index-what-you-need-to-know" target="_self"><u>tightened</u></a> the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for PM2.5 for the first time since 2012. The South Coast Air Quality District, which contains Los Angeles, is known for having some of the worst air quality in the country. State officials have already deemed it to be <a href="https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/sites/default/files/2024-12/Staff_Report_PM2.5_Area_Designation_Recommendations_2024_Annual_PM2.5_NAAQS.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>out of compliance</u></a> — and that’s without even counting pollution from major wildfires. But new research raises questions about whether complying with the new standard will even be possible in many places due to the increasing frequency and severity of wildfires.</p><p>Marshall Burke, who <a href="https://eartharxiv.org/repository/view/8187/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>published the not-yet-peer-reviewed findings</u></a> in December, is a Stanford University researcher who has spent the past several years investigating how wildfires have affected PM2.5 exposure in the U.S. In a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06522-6" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>2023 paper published in </u><u><em><em>Nature</em></em></u></a>, he and his co-authors found that over just six years, wildfire smoke eroded decades of air quality improvements throughout the country. The trend was particularly bad in Western states, of course — some of which saw more than half of their gains erased. The pre-print of the new paper updates those findings to include data from 2023. But it also goes deeper on what this means in light of the new air quality standards. The authors find that 34% of air monitoring stations registered PM2.5 above the regulatory limit because of smoke in at least one of the last five years. </p><p>Technically, wildfire smoke is completely unregulated. Jurisdictions can request to exclude “exceptional events,” such as days when PM2.5 spiked due to wildfire, from their calculations. But as the “smoke season” has grown longer and more places experience more days with degraded air quality due to smoke, local officials have not been requesting more exemptions. The researchers analyzed applications for exemptions since 2019, and found that they were more common on days with higher levels of wildfire smoke, but were still infrequent overall. </p><p>One reason might be that local pollution control officers don’t always recognize when smoke has pushed pollution over the limit on a particular day versus other factors. There is also a “substantial resource burden involved” in demonstrating the influence of wildfire smoke on ambient air quality, the paper says. Also, as smoke becomes more commonplace, it may be more difficult for officials to make the case that a given smoke event is “exceptional.” </p><p>In any case, if this low rate of applications for exemptions continues, many more regions may find themselves to be out of compliance with the new PM2.5 standard.</p><p>In the paper’s discussion section, the researchers posit that as wildfire smoke continues to get worse, either of two possible scenarios could play out. In the first, air quality districts affected by smoke get better at applying for exemptions and therefore achieve compliance with the Clean Air Act, even as local air quality and public health deteriorate. In the second, they find other ways to stay in compliance with the standards, such as by tightening pollution caps on power plants and factories. “Such mitigation could be cost effective in many regions where abatement costs remain low relative to the benefits of further air quality improvements,” the authors write, “but could become onerous if wildfire smoke concentrations continue to grow, as is expected under a warming climate.”</p><p>The first scenario is bleak, and the second comes with a pretty big caveat. But those aren’t the only options — we can also reduce the risk of wildfires with better land-use planning and management. Unfortunately, promising strategies like controlled burns can push PM2.5 levels over the standard, and those are <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/forest-service-chief-prescribed-burns-conflict-with-air-rules/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>not exempt from reporting</u></a> the way that wildfires are — creating a perverse incentive not to do them.</p>

## Does Climate Change Make the Santa Ana Winds Worse?

(Scientists call them simply “offshore winds.”) The phenomenon is caused by winter’s cold, dry air becoming lodged in the bowl of the Great Basin, where it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_High#:~:text=Often%2C%20in%20the%20winter%20months,front%20on%20its%20leading%20edge." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>forms a high-pressure area</u></a>.

For another, there is a “rare placement of upper-level jet stream winds” giving the system a more northerly flow as opposed to the usual north-easterly orientation, Scott Capps, an atmospheric scientist and the head of Atmospheric Data Solutions, a forecasting firm, told me in an email. As a result, “many areas that are typically not impacted by Santa Ana winds were impacted.”</p><h3>Does climate change affect the Santa Anas?</h3><br/><p>“Logically, it makes sense that climate change will impact the frequency and characteristics of [the Santa Anas],” Capps told me. However, “due to the complexity of the environment, we cannot blame one single factor for any extreme weather event.” The more obvious connection between the L.A. fires and climate change is the lack of precipitation during what is supposed to be the region’s wet season; some parts of southern California have <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/weather/article/drought-water-fire-california-20011706.php" target="_blank"><u>received just 10% of their normal rainfall</u></a> since October, making the area <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/los-angeles-fire-preparedness" target="_self"><u>ripe for a fire</u></a>.</p><p>Scientists <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/california-s-fire-fanning-santa-ana-winds-may-not-get-any-better-climate-change" target="_blank"><u>used to think</u></a> that inland warming would reduce the cold weather-related high pressure in the Great Basin and weaken the Santa Anas. While it does appear that so-called “cold” Santa Anas — caused by air in the Great Basin that is so cold initially that it’s still chilly when it reaches L.A., and which account for about a third of all Santa Anas — are becoming less frequent, the more traditional “warm” winds that are associated with wildfires <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/california-s-fire-fanning-santa-ana-winds-may-not-get-any-better-climate-change" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>don’t actually seem</u></a> to bear out this hypothesis.

## Former President Jimmy Carter lies in state at US Capitol

date: 2025-01-08, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Thousands of people braved freezing temperatures to come to the U.S. Capitol to pay their respects to former President Jimmy Carter, who lay in state Wednesday in the heart of American democracy ahead of his pomp-filled state funeral.


Mourners, who included numerous elected officials and Vice President Kamala Harris, highlighted the achievements and the humanity of the100-year-old, who died last month.


David Smith, a professor at the Carter School for Peace and Conflict Resolution at George Mason University, said that the former president obviously impacted his career. He told VOA that he came to the Capitol to honor the man but also to honor Carter’s causes.


“He had such an impact on so many people,” he said. “His work on advancing minorities, appointments of women to the judiciary, protecting our environment, advocating for human rights – all those things are very important things to me.”


The former president’s flag-draped coffin arrived in the Capitol rotunda Tuesday, ahead of Thursday’s national funeral.




In that soaring space – where only about 50 Americans have been recognized with this distinct honor since 1852 – Senate Majority Leader Jon Thune, in a service late Tuesday, described Carter as: “Navy veteran, peanut farmer, governor of Georgia. And president of the United States. Sunday school teacher. Nobel Prize winner. Advocate for peace and human rights. And first and foremost, a faithful servant of his creator and his fellow man."


And Vice President Harris – who a day earlier, in this building, certified the victory of the next president – extolled Carter’s policy.


"He was the first president of the United States to have a comprehensive energy policy, including providing some of the first federal support for clean energy,” she said Tuesday. “He also passed over a dozen major pieces of legislation regarding environmental protection. And more than doubled the size of America's national parks."


Carter, who served as the 39th president, died December 29 at the age of 100 after nearly two years in hospice care in the state of Georgia. Since then, his final journey has taken his remains over the skinny roads of his humble hometown of Plains; down the boulevards of Atlanta, the state capital, and through the skies to snowy Washington, for his state funeral.




At the U.S. Capitol, lawmakers told VOA what the 39th president meant to them.


Congresswoman Alma Adams, a North Carolina Democrat, said Carter was “a real moral person.”


“He taught Sunday school – I did, too!” she said, smiling. “But I think (it’s) the fact that he cared about all people. He was a people’s president.”



South Carolina Republican Representative Ralph Norman told VOA that while he did not align with Carter politically, “President Carter was a good man. President Carter was a man who served his country. He loved America. I didn’t agree with all of his policies, but you couldn’t (dis)agree with his patriotism, you couldn’t disagree. He just loved his country.”


President Joe Biden will deliver the eulogy for his fellow Democrat on Thursday.


"We may never see his like again, you know we can all do well to try to be a little more like Jimmy Carter,” Biden said in late December after receiving news of Carter’s death.


Analysts say the two men have a few things in common.


“There's an obvious similarity; that is, that Carter turned out to be a one-term president, and Biden turned out to be a one-term president,” Bill Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told VOA on Zoom. “And that's never a reflection of the right combination of politics and policy. In both cases, I would say that the two presidents put the policy ahead of the politics. And they paid the price for that.”


Thursday’s funeral will bring together President Biden and former presidents, including Biden’s predecessor and successor, Donald Trump. When asked what Carter and the next and previous president have in common, Galston paused.


“I don't even know how to begin to answer that question,” he said finally. “The two are polar opposites in every respect that I can think of, except one. And that is, they both attained the presidency as outsiders.”


And now, here lies this outsider, decades after his presidency ended, inside his nation’s most venerated space.

## In Los Angeles, Preparedness Wasn’t the Problem

Not in the metro area of Los Angeles, where it is, technically, supposed to be the rainy season. </p><p>But try telling a fire that it’s unseasonal.</p><p>At the time of this writing, three wildfires are burning in the Los Angeles area, mostly uncontained: the nearly 3,000-acre Palisades fire in the hills between Santa Monica and Malibu; the 500-acre Hurst fire in Sylmar, northwest of downtown L.A.; and the 2,300-acre Eaton fire outside of Pasadena. The fire has destroyed more than 1,000 buildings — including, apparently, the home of reality TV royals <a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/heidi-montag-and-spencer-pratt-react-to-palisades-wildfires.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt</u></a> — and <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/live/pacific-palisades-fire-updates-los-angeles" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>at least two people have died</u></a>. Emergency management officials told an additional 30,000 people to evacuate immediately, a number that is likely to climb as dry, windy conditions worsen throughout the day on the West Coast. Though it’s still early in the unfolding disaster, forecasters expect fire weather to continue through at least Thursday, and some experts are already saying the event may end up being <a href="https://www.cnn.com/weather/live-news/los-angeles-pacific-palisades-eaton-wildfires-01-08-25/index.html?t=1736358986008" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the costliest wildfire on record</u></a>.</p><p>It’s not the case, however, that this unusual storm has taken emergency management or the public by surprise. “We’ve been advertising this event for several days and talking about how serious it could be starting last week,” Kristen Allison, a fire management specialist with the Southern California Geographic Area Coordination Center, told me. Given the high Santa Ana winds —which, with their <a href="https://x.com/NWSLosAngeles/status/1877001296735051828" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>100-mile-per-hour gusts</u></a>, were strong enough to blow unimpeded over the San Gabriel mountains and hit typically sheltered areas like Pasadena — and the low humidity, forecasters saw all the classic warning signs of wildfire well in advance.</p><p>It’s not the wind or dry air that is so atypical for January, though. “We haven’t had significant rain since April, so we’ve been dry for eight or nine months,” Allison went on. “Our fuels are basically bone dry at this point.” </p><p>And there is <em><em>a lot</em></em> of fuel waiting to burn after the region’s wet spring — a dangerous situation created by the see-sawing between extremes that is typical of climate change. <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/weather/article/drought-water-fire-california-20011706.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Earlier this year</u></a>, the U.S. Drought Monitor classified many parts of the state as being in a “moderate” drought, a trend that also <a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/is-extreme-weather-climate-change" target="_self"><u>has strong links to climate change</u></a> and will have dried out the vegetation in the hills. </p><div class="horizontal-rule"></div><p><em>Get the best of Heatmap in your inbox daily.</em></p><p><em></em><div id="mc_embed_signup"><form action="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=c5c20b220f&f_id=00a03fe3f0" id="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" method="post" name="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" target="_self"><div id="mc_embed_signup_scroll"><div class="indicates-required"><span class="asterisk">*</span> indicates required</div><div class="mc-field-group"><label for="mce-EMAIL">Email Address  <span class="asterisk">*</span></label><input class="required email" id="mce-EMAIL" name="EMAIL" placeholder="Your Email" required="" type="email" value=""/><span class="helper_text" id="mce-EMAIL-HELPERTEXT"></span><a class="policy__link" href="/privacy-statement">Our Privacy Policy & Terms Apply.</a></div>

L.A.’s fires, then, are “not so much a temperature story,” Max Moritz, a cooperative extension wildfire specialist at U.C. Santa Barbara’s Bren School of Environmental Science & Management, told me. “This is really more of a precipitation and climate change story.” All the landscape was ever going to need, in other words, was a spark.</p><p>It might be a long time before we discover what <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/park-fire-arson" target="_self"><u>this particular spark</u></a> was. But it also doesn’t really matter. “Once fires like this start, there is not a whole lot firefighters can do,” Neil Lareau, a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Nevada, Reno, told me. “The pre-positioning of resources — all of that was there. But you see the impossibility of the task at hand once the fires get going.”</p><p>Allison agreed that few who live in the fire-prone hills outside of Malibu or Pasadena are likely to have ignored the warnings just because they’ve otherwise been lucky <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woolsey_Fire" target="_blank"><u>lately</u></a>. “People know that if we haven’t had rain in months and months and months, and we got the wind coming — they know this is fire weather,” Allison said. The lack of significant casualties so far might be attributed to the fact that as awful as the <em><em>physical</em></em> destruction is, this is also what southern California <em><em>does</em></em>, even if it’s an unusual time of year.</p><p>But Scott Capps, an atmospheric scientist and the head of Atmospheric Data Solutions, a forecasting firm, pointed out to me in an email that just because we expect fire weather, “we cannot predict where and when a wildfire ignition will happen.” As he explained, the terrain of southern California is complex and extraordinarily difficult to accurately model; in a fast-moving situation like the fires in L.A., the advantages of predicting fire weather quickly reach their limits. Especially when a wildfire starts burning between fuel-rich homes, entire neighborhoods can quickly go up in smoke.</p><p>The late author and urban theorist Mike Davis once argued that <a href="https://longreads.com/2018/12/04/the-case-for-letting-malibu-burn/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>we should let Malibu burn</u></a>. “After every major California blaze, homeowners and their representatives take shelter in the belief that if wildfire can’t be prevented, nonetheless, its destructiveness can be tamed,” he wrote, adding: “Yet, as a contemporary Galileo might say … ‘still it burns.’” </p><p>Davis was writing in 1998, a time when he described fire season as “late August to early October.” Many would <a href="https://heatmap.news/culture/the-last-fire-season-manjula-martin#:~:text=fire%20season%20isn%E2%80%99t%20really%20a%20thing%20anymore." target="_self"><u>argue now</u></a> that there isn’t such a thing as a fire “season” anymore. Allison warned me that the forecast looks favorable for fires through Friday, and that “additional winds are coming next week” and “we’re not going to see rain anytime soon.” At a certain point, Davis’ wry pessimism might not seem not so crass. </p><p>Moritz, though, wanted to be clear in distinguishing between the inevitabilities. “We have built communities right up into and against flammable landscapes, so yes, it is inevitable that many of these neighborhoods are going to experience a fire,” he explained. But “is it inevitable that we would have this many home losses, or have to evacuate this many people, and who knows how many fatalities may end up emerging — is <em><em>that</em></em> part inevitable? No.”</p><p>Predicting fires is, of course, <em><em>vitally</em></em> important: Warnings and outlooks prevent deaths, promote <a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/how-to-protect-home-from-wildfire" target="_self"><u>home-hardening and resilience measures</u></a>, and help encourage smooth evacuations that, in turn, keep first responders safe. But when you have an alignment of conditions like these, prediction will never equal prevention. Moritz argued that we need to move beyond “preventing” fires, anyway — it’s more important that we begin to think of land use and urban planning as public health measures. “We need to have urban design standards that explicitly address the need for more survivable communities” in southern California, he told me.</p><p>Because of the climate, because of bad luck, because of the folly of wanting to live somewhere with that perfect Pacific view — California was going to catch fire. “I think there are going to be some tragic outcomes that we hear about,” Moritz said, “and if there are any lessons that we can take away, it’s that we have to learn to coexist with this kind of inevitable natural hazard.” </p>

<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTUwNTA1MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0NDQ0NTU1Mn0.-aPeEJM65Dk5qpgZJdOEQC9-FOKlLaa73kTBTR3zvY8/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">Ask me one thing I love about living in Los Angeles and there’s a good chance I’d say, <em><em>Because it’s wild</em></em>. The giant city park near us is no flat, grassy plane for picnicking and Frisbee, but a rugged expanse of coyotes and the occasional <a href="https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/puma-profiles-p-22.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>mountain lion</u></a>, God rest his soul. Outside my window loom the San Gabriel Mountains, loaded with hiking trails. </p>
<p>This is a place integrated with nature. People hike after brunch. But, as we must say at times like this, there is a cost to that.</p>
<p>The skies are dark today after <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/live/pacific-palisades-fire-updates-los-angeles" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>two enormous wildfires</u></a> sprang up overnight, sparked and fueled by ferocious Santa Anas. The winds, which blow hot air from the inland Great Basin toward the ocean, typically bring unseasonably warm days and fire danger in autumn. This January incident brought gusts as high as 100 miles per hour that rattled our windows and downed trees across town.</p>
<p>First came the fire in the <a href="https://x.com/JonVigliotti/status/1877020919475884110" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Pacific Palisades</u></a>, the area between the city’s ritzy western beach towns and the oft-burning hills of Malibu. The Palisades fire turned into a beast in a hurry as tens of thousands of people abandoned their homes and parts of Santa Monica went on high alert. Bulldozers <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/c24n4pz6p2eo" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>bulldozed</u></a> abandoned cars to make way for fire trucks.</p>
<p>Later in the evening, a second blaze began in Eaton Canyon, whose waterfall makes it one of the busiest hiking destinations in town. Eaton spread quickly in the dry mountains above Pasadena, forcing evacuations and alerts in the cities like Altadena and La Cañada Flintridge and creating a dark cloud of smoke over the San Gabriel Valley. At Caltech, where I work, the campus is wind-beaten and classes are canceled, as they are at plenty of area school districts.</p>
<p>L.A. woke up Wednesday morning to find itself between two fires. And those two enormous events, each of which has consumed thousands of acres by now, aren’t the end of it. Another major wildfire broke out north of the city near Santa Clarita. Smaller blazes have popped up all around town like a cruel game of Whack-a-Mole — in Pasadena, in Culver City, and close to here, by Dodger Stadium. Mercifully, most of these flare-ups were extinguished before they could spread.</p>
<p>In social media posts, residents are recommending to each other the excellent <a href="https://www.watchduty.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Watch Duty</u></a> app that tracks fires as they develop. To have that on your phone this week is to be barraged by messages about new evacuation orders and new fires blazing up. With the whole region bone-dry and the gusts unrelenting, the city suddenly feels like a minefield. Any expanse of tree or scrub could be the next one to catch fire. As I watched out my window last night to see the mountain flames dance in the distance, a power line explosion in the foreground darkened part of a neighborhood across the river.</p>
<p>Such gloom was already a signature part of late summer and autumn in California, when the months of near-zero precipitation create a tinderbox in the hills and the mountains. Now, wildfires are seasonally unbounded. No significant rain has fallen in November or December. That, plus, an extremely hot and dry summer, led to the parched conditions that combined with freak winds to set the city ablaze during what used to be a wet month.</p>
<p>This is the way of things now. During the past two winters, El Niño conditions dropped heavy rainfall around Los Angeles that added snowpack to the mountains and eased drought conditions in the area. This winter we haven’t been so fortunate. In a climate-changed L.A. with less rain during its rainy season, the delicate balance of the city starts to tilt out of balance. It’s harder and harder to have neighborhoods in and up against the mountains, when wildfires seem to come so much more often.</p>
<p>These events inevitably trigger a wave of “How could you live in such a place?” Of course, you could ask the same thing of the tornadoes that sweep through where I’m originally from, or the hurricanes of the Gulf Coast. Every place has its disasters, and major wildfires are growing more common everywhere, not just in California. Retreat is an illusion.</p>
<p>What matters, here and elsewhere, is resilience. Not just the psychological kind that means we recover and come back, but the practical, logistical kind, like decentralized electrical grids that are less vulnerable to natural disasters and help people keep the lights on when the worst happens. We must build for the unexpected now that the freak cataclysm isn’t a freak event anymore. </p>

## The Growing Push to Ban Renewable Energy in Oklahoma

date: 2025-01-08, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTUwNDY1NS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3NDY3MTE4NX0.GWD8fKDO5LhgYIucHSvau9f8JLfd57jAtFk7zXYYwDU/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">There’s a nascent, concerted effort to make Oklahoma the first state to ban new renewable energy projects. And it’s picking up steam. </p>
<p>Across the U.S., activism against wind and solar energy has only grown in intensity, power, and scope in tandem with the recent renewables boom. This is in direct contrast to hopes many in the climate movement had that these technologies would become <em><em>more</em></em> popular as they entered communities historically hostile to the idea of switching away from fossil fuels. If anything, grassroots angst toward the energy transition has only surged in many pockets of the country since passage of the nation’s first climate law – Inflation Reduction Act – in 2022. </p>
<p>Nowhere is this more true than Oklahoma, which on paper resembles a breadbasket of possibilities for the “green” economy. Oklahoma is the nation’s <a href="https://www.eia.gov/state/analysis.php?sid=OK#9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>third largest generator</u></a> of wind energy, home to a burgeoning solar energy sector, a <a href="https://h2alo.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>potential hydrogen hub</u></a>, and maybe even the nation’s <a href="https://ictnews.org/news/native-activists-fighting-nickel-and-cobalt-refinery" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>first refinery for cobalt</u></a>, a rare metal used in electric vehicles. Yet yesterday, hundreds of people flocked to Oklahoma City, filled a giant hall in the state’s capitol building to the brim, and rallied for the state’s governor Kevin Stitt to issue an executive order to stop new wind and solar energy facilities from being built. </p>
<p>“Welcome Oklahoma, for braving the cold out there into this very warm and receiving Capitol. And y’know what? Our warmth today was not brought to us by green energy,” Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond told the rally audience. </p>
<p>It’s exceedingly likely these folks won’t get an executive order any time soon. Oklahoma Republican governor, Kevin Stitt, has embraced these technologies as job creators. “Oklahoma is an oil and gas state through and through, but we also generate about 47% of our electricity from renewable sources,” he wrote <a href="https://x.com/GovStitt/status/1827063872353923552" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>on X</u></a> in August. “I just don’t think the government should pick winners and losers or force us to choose between one or the other.” Weeks ago, he <a href="https://oklahoma.gov/governor/newsroom/newsroom/2024/nov2024/governor-stitt-signs-energy-mou-with-ambassador-of-denmark.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>signed a memorandum of understanding</u></a> between the state and the nation of Denmark to collaborate more on wind energy. </p>
<p>But the political gusts are blowing in the direction of a ban. Exhibit A: Drummond, who it’s <a href="https://www.news9.com/story/67461d65ef6c021a9ebcd99d/oklahomas-2026-governors-race:-key-figures-who-have-been-speculated-to-run" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>rumored may run</u></a> to replace Stitt and who at the rally pledged to work with legislators to pass a bill ending the deal with “quasi-socialist” Denmark. The rally also featured Oklahoma’s Education Secretary Ryan Walters, whose name has also been included in gubernatorial chatter. </p>
<p>This uprising in Oklahoma has been happening for quite some time, without much fanfare due to a persistent and pernicious <a href="https://www.kgou.org/politics-and-government/2023-01-03/oklahoma-news-deserts-data-shows-voting-sagged-in-orphan-counties" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>news desert problem</u></a> in the state (and <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/news-deserts-climate-disaster/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>many others</u></a>). Like other states, it is becoming more commonplace for towns and counties there <a href="https://www.okenergytoday.com/2024/12/legislators-take-a-stand-against-a-possible-mcintosh-county-wind-farm/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>to face pressure</u></a> to <a href="https://okcfox.com/news/local/tired-of-being-taken-advantage-of-officials-voice-support-for-wind-farm-moratorium-lincoln-county-turbines-power-energy-apex-clean-green-enel-robbie-jeff-mccommas-sandstone-hills-cedar-run-commissioner-board-garber-wellington-aquifer-iowa-tribe-jacob" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>support moratoriums</u></a> against developing new projects, and GOP lawmakers are also increasingly facing primaries over offering any support to wind or solar energy, or even just remaining neutral on whether projects get built. One such casualty in the last election cycle was Kevin Wallace, the GOP chair of the Appropriations and Budget Committee in the statehouse, who <a href="https://www.oklahoman.com/story/news/politics/government/2024/08/22/oklahoma-elections-2024-runoffs-kevin-wallace-jim-shaw/74874494007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>was dethroned</u></a> by a political newcomer – Jim Shaw, who ran heavily on anti-renewables policies, including a statewide moratorium. </p>
<p>“It’s a groundswell,” said Pam Kingfisher, an environmental activist in northeast Oklahoma. Kingfisher is a Democrat but she has her own concerns with the environmental impacts that wind turbines could have in her community, the town of Kansas. So she’s grateful for this uprising. </p>
<p>“They’re attacking their own people and being very effective and I’m standing back going, ‘hey yes, take them on.’” </p>
<p>Suffice it to say, these activists feel emboldened by the primary wins and Trump’s election. Charity Linch, chair of the Oklahoma chapter of the Republican National Committee, told me she doesn’t believe the “pro-renewable Republican” will exist much longer in the state. </p>
<p>“I don’t believe that’s going to continue in Oklahoma,” Linch told me. “If they haven’t figured it out yet, they will very soon.” </p>
<p>Linch is the proud founder of Freedom Brigades, a grassroots network of activists with members in several states. The Freedom Brigade chapters for two counties conflicted over wind – McIntosh and Pittsburg – were instrumental in organizing the rally. Linch said Freedom Brigades also helped support some of the successful primary challengers in this past election cycle, and that her members were partially responsible for the Oklahoma GOP <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/29/politics/oklahoma-gop-condemns-censures-lankford-border-negotiations/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>censuring Sen. James Lankford</u></a> last year over a bipartisan border deal in Congress – causing the bill <a href="https://missouriindependent.com/2024/05/24/bipartisan-border-bill-loses-support-fails-procedural-vote-in-u-s-senate/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>to die</u></a>. </p>
<p>From talking to Linch, it’s clear to me that renewable developers should pay close attention to the Oklahoma uprising. So should Washington, because as talk in Congress proceeds toward changing the Inflation Reduction Act, rest assured some of these people will contact their members of Congress when the time comes. And you should expect the same from the myriad of anti-renewables activists in other states fighting solar and wind projects in their own backyards. </p>
<p><strong>Getting Red In The Face</strong></p>
<p>Why is this rebellion happening in Oklahoma? Well, if you ask Oklahomans, they’ll count the reasons. </p>
<p>Activists involved in planning the rally told me the biggest reason for the uproar was that solar and wind projects aren’t bringing the ample jobs developers and policymakers promise, making their presence in communities more difficult to stomach. Others point to environmental concerns, from the impacts these projects can have on species to the chemicals used to make them. Like Saundra Traywick, a donkey farmer who attended the rally and author of a <a href="http://change.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Change.org petition</u></a> supporting a state renewables ban that has more than 3,000 signatures. The petition claims wind turbines present “hazards to the health, safety, and welfare of the people.” </p>
<p>“They resort to calling us names instead of listening to us,” Traywick told me. “None of us wanted to get involved in any of this. We didn’t want to be involved in politics. These are farmers that are dealing with freezing temperatures,” referencing the temperature outside the rally. </p>
<p>There’s a serious issue of tribal opposition, given a 2020 Supreme Court ruling that found nearly half of all lands in Oklahoma fall under some form of tribal sovereignty. As Heatmap’s Matthew Zeitlin <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/sunzia-lawsuit-blm" target="_self"><u>explained last year</u></a>, this means developers may also need to get mineral rights approvals from tribal government bodies. Two weeks ago, a federal judge <a href="https://www.kjrh.com/news/local-news/justice-judge-orders-removal-of-8-400-acre-wind-farm-on-osage-reservation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ordered the removal</u></a> of 84 wind turbines on those grounds, stating the developer Enel Green Power failed to get adequate permission from the Osage Nation. </p>
<p>Some involved in this push for a renewables ban are also open about another rationale: They want to help oil and gas production, a key source of employment in the state. </p>
<p>“Why are we as a state being forced to fund our own demise essentially, with our federal taxpayer dollars, to prop up an industry that’s literally killing the backbone industry of our state, which is oil and gas?” Shaw said on <em><em>Breitbar</em></em>t’s Conservative Review <a href="https://zeno.fm/podcast/conservative-review-with-daniel-horowitz/episodes/colonizing-red-states-with-green-grift-12-4-24/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>podcast in December</u></a>. </p>
<p>To anyone who believes, as the vast <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/01/07/hottest-year-record-2024-climate-change" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>majority of scientists say</u></a>, that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/what-is-latest-science-telling-us-about-climate-change-2025-01-06/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>climate change is real</u></a> and to <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/news/3134/reducing-emissions-to-lessen-climate-change-would-yield-dramatic-health-benefits-by-2030/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>avert catastrophe</u></a> we must <a href="https://www.iea.org/topics/climate-change" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>quickly build an energy grid</u></a> that <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/climate-qa/does-it-matter-how-much-united-states-reduces-its-carbon-dioxide-emissions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>produces far fewer carbon emissions</u></a>, these may all look like terrible reasons. </p>
<p>But if you don’t believe that climate change is real, or you believe it’s an overrated problem… renewables are just a much harder sell. </p>
<p>“Most of us do not believe we need to reduce our CO2 to begin with,” NeAnne Clinton, an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DB6kgDGKCrc/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>activist fighting</u></a> a large <a href="https://www.nexteraenergyresources.com/skeleton-creek-project.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>NextEra solar-plus-battery project</u></a> in Garfield County, Oklahoma, told me. “We know that it’s a scam and we don’t support it. And we don’t support using our taxpayer money for something that we didn’t have a voice in.” </p>
<p>Cheyenne Branscum, chair of Sierra Club’s Oklahoma chapter, told me it is difficult for supporters of renewable energy to counter this insurgent populist movement against the sector. Part of the dilemma is that environmental activism itself is seen by many of the state’s most red-blooded Republicans as a “radical” act, so if climate advocates were to organize counter protests it would likely backfire. When asked how her organization and others could best deal with the anti-renewables sentiment rising in her state, she talked about <a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/oklahoma/programs/education" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>education programs</u></a> – not confrontation. </p>
<p>“We’re not going to change anything at the state capital,” Branscum told me. “All a counter rally is going to do is make them have more opportunities to make us into a meme. They’re going to have some angry picture out there with a sign and be labeled some crazy radical that doesn’t care about their community. And it is unfortunately a hurdle.” </p>
<p><strong>The Sooners’ Warning Shot</strong></p>
<p>The Oklahoma rebellion should be cold comfort for anyone who buys into one of the <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/biden-climate-policy" target="_self"><u>implicit political principles</u></a> behind the country’s first climate law – the Inflation Reduction Act. </p>
<p>Whether folks in D.C. want to admit it or not, the American anti-renewables revolution is rising up as Donald Trump retakes the White House and it is going to try and make its own impact on the Inflation Reduction Act. While much ado has been made about how the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/16/climate/clean-energy-investment-republicans/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>overwhelming majority</u></a> of monetary benefits from the IRA are supporting investments in Republican-controlled states, as veteran lobbyist Frank Maisano put it <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/republicans-ira-climate-law" target="_self"><u>to me last year</u></a>, “Businesses will support many things that they have their tentacles into and Republicans will support many things that are going on in their districts that constituents like.” </p>
<p>“The reality is, if you’re going to try to repeal it,” Maisano said, “you’re going to have to do it through Congress and a lot of the action in the energy transition is in Republican districts. It becomes a constituent issue.”</p>
<p>What if many Republican constituents simply don’t like these new investments, in spite of the promises of jobs or tax benefits? What happens if Republicans in Congress are primaried simply for allowing solar and wind to keep getting federal tax breaks?</p>
<p>None of this surprises Nathan Jensen, a Texas University professor specializing in resource politics, who believes Oklahoma will only be the first to face a movement for a state-wide ban on new renewables. Just look at Texas where, like Oklahoma, the energy sector has become a panacea for wind and solar energy but many GOP policymakers <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/renewable-energy-texas-senate-voting" target="_self"><u>have turned</u></a> on <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2023/03/01/chapter-313-texas-renewables-economic-development/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>economic development packages</u></a> for new renewables. A state-wide ban hasn’t been discussed yet, but Jensen can imagine the idea gaining traction. </p>
<p>Jensen said he believes the organizing on platforms like Facebook only tells part of the story. Clearly, he says, a lot of people are joining that cause because the industry’s grown large enough that people are hearing from the farm or town next to theirs about solar and wind projects. And whether climate advocates want to hear it or not, these people are not loving what they’re hearing. Solar and wind projects don’t create <a href="https://graham.umich.edu/media/pubs/Wind-Turbine-Economic-Impact-Local-Employment-46932.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>that</em></em></u></a> many jobs after they’re built. They do create a flurry of construction, but that’s a form of labor that leaves when it’s done and is often resented by neighbors, leading to disputes over dust, noise, or water. Then there’s the tax abatements for developers, which aggrieved residents see as taxpayer dollars going to large companies without their say – precisely the message gaining traction in Oklahoma. </p>
<p>This means places that seem safe for renewable developers are no longer safe and companies need to be really careful about how they approach community benefits. It’s not something you can just say – you really need to deliver what you promise. </p>
<p>“I know there’s a lot of news about organized anti-solar, which clearly happens, but also there’s this organic opposition that happens where it’s like, <em><em>‘You’re asking for how much from our school district?</em></em>’” Jensen said. “Some of it is organized Facebook groups against solar but I think there is a lot of frustration.” </p>

## Taliban refute Trump’s claims on US financial aid to Afghanistan

date: 2025-01-08, from: VOA News USA

ISLAMABAD — Taliban leaders in Afghanistan on Wednesday denied President-elect Donald Trump’s assertions that they have received billions of dollars in U.S. financial aid since regaining control of the country. 


Hamdullah Fitrat, the deputy Taliban spokesperson, responded to Trump’s claims by asserting that the Kabul administration neither anticipates nor seeks any assistance from the United States. 


“In reality, the United States has not provided a single penny to the Islamic Emirate,” Fitrat stated, referring to Afghanistan’s official name under Taliban rule. “Instead, it has confiscated and frozen billions of dollars that rightfully belong to the people of Afghanistan.”  


The Taliban’s sharp response followed Trump’s news conference in Florida on Tuesday, when he was asked to comment on the alleged monthly payments of millions of dollars by the Biden administration to the de facto Afghan rulers. 


“It’s not even believable. Billions of dollars, not millions — billions. We pay billions of dollars to essentially the Taliban Afghanistan,” Trump stated. “This can’t be allowed to happen.” 


Fitrat claimed that the U.S. funds in question were primarily utilized for the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan and the relocation and resettlement of their Afghan allies. 


“A portion of this money may have also been used under the pretext of ‘humanitarian aid’ by international organizations. … [The] U.S. directed all this money to Afghanistan, primarily for its own interests, and now exploits it as propaganda against the Islamic Emirate,” the Taliban spokesperson alleged. 


The controversy surrounding provision of financial aid to the Taliban intensified following a Jan. 2 letter by Congressman Tim Burchett to President-elect Trump, which expressed concern over foreign aid being directed to the de facto Afghan authorities. 


“These cash shipments are auctioned off, and after that, they are nearly impossible to track. This is how the Taliban is being funded and plans to fund terrorism around the world,” warned Burchett. “The United States of America should not fund its enemies abroad.” 


He cited U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken as having confirmed that non-governmental organizations in Afghanistan had paid nearly $10 million in foreign aid to the Taliban in taxes. 


The Taliban swept back to power in August 2021, prompting Washington and the West at large to suspend development aid to the country and effectively isolate the Afghan banking sector, freezing billions of dollars of central bank assets in the United States. 


The flow of humanitarian assistance, however, has primarily remained intact under the United Nations' supervision. 


The U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) refutes allegations that some of the funds it receives for humanitarian operations are being diverted to the Taliban. 


UNAMA has maintained that it transports cash into the country for the use of U.N. agencies and "approved and vetted" humanitarian partners to assist millions of Afghans needing support. 


The mission has emphasized that all cash is deposited in designated U.N. accounts in a private bank before being distributed directly to the United Nations and other entities. It has also clarified that none of the cash brought into the country is deposited in the Central Bank of Afghanistan or provided to de facto Taliban authorities by the U.N.

## European Union rebuffs Trump's designs on Greenland takeover

date: 2025-01-08, from: VOA News USA

The European Union on Wednesday dismissed U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s refusal to rule out a military attack to take control of Denmark’s autonomous territory of Greenland as "wild hypothetical stuff," while confirming that EU states would be compelled to defend the island if Trump invaded it.


Trump, set to be inaugurated for a second, nonconsecutive term in the White House on Jan. 20, refused at a news conference Tuesday to rule out military action to take control of the mineral-rich Arctic island and earlier had vowed to slap high tariffs on Denmark if it refused to cede control.


The Brussels-based 27-nation bloc, long a U.S. ally, however, attempted to avoid being drawn into a verbal sparring match with Trump, saying it was “looking forward” to working with the incoming administration.


As for Trump’s refusal to rule out military action to take over Greenland, a European Commission spokesperson said, "We are talking about fairly wild hypothetical stuff about an administration that hasn't come in yet."




Another spokesperson added that the sovereignty of states had to be respected "as a matter of principle.”


Asked if Greenland was covered by a mutual defense clause binding EU members to assist each other in case of attack, commission spokesperson Paula Pinho said that was the case.


"But we are indeed speaking of something extremely theoretical on which we will not want to elaborate," she said.


Greenland is a mineral-rich autonomous territory of EU member Denmark and an associated territory of the EU.


Trump has long publicly hypothesized about taking over Greenland, saying Tuesday, “We need Greenland for national security purposes,” arguing that Denmark should give it up to “protect the free world.”


Aside from minerals on the island, it is a strategic Arctic shipping portal, especially as ice floes melt at the top of the world as the planet warms.


Trump earlier in the day wrote on social media that the potential American takeover of Greenland “is a deal that must happen” and uploaded photos of his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., who was visiting Greenland.


“MAKE GREENLAND GREAT AGAIN,” Trump added.


Panama and Canada


At his news conference, Trump also refused to rule out military action to secure control of the Panama Canal and use economic force against neighboring Canada to gain the upper hand in trade deals or merge the two countries.


“Canada and the United States, that would really be something,” Trump said. “You get rid of that artificially drawn line, and you take a look at what that looks like, and it would also be much better for national security.”


Trump posited the possibility that Canada should be the 51st U.S. state, a proposition that outgoing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau immediately rejected.


“There isn’t a snowball’s chance in hell that Canada would become part of the United States,” Trudeau said.


Germany and France


Aside from the EU’s rejection of Trump eyeing a Greenland takeover, EU members Germany and France individually also rebuffed the suggestion by the incoming U.S. leader.


German Chancellor Olaf Scholz expressed surprise at Trump’s comments, saying European partners agreed that the inviolability of borders was a fundamental principle of international law.


"This principle applies and is a foundation of our peaceful order," Scholz told reporters.


"In my discussions with our European partners, a certain lack of understanding has emerged with regard to recent statements from the USA," Scholz said in an unusually blunt statement called on short notice.


"The principle of inviolability of borders applies to every country, regardless of whether it is to the east or west of us," said Scholz, adding that Russia had violated that principle with its nearly three-year invasion of Ukraine.


French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot told France Inter radio, "There is no question of the EU letting other nations in the world, whoever they may be ... attack its sovereign borders. We are a strong continent. We need to strengthen ourselves more.”


Barrot said he did not believe the U.S. would invade the vast Arctic island that has been part of Denmark for more than 600 years.


But he added, "We have entered an era that is seeing the return of the law of the strongest. Should we be intimidated? Should we be overcome with worry? Evidently, no,” he said.


"We need to wake up and reinforce ourselves militarily in competition in a world where the law of the strongest prevails.”


Barrot said he believes the United States is "inherently not imperialistic" and said he "did not believe" that it is changing.

## Justice Department says it plans to release only part of Trump report for now

date: 2025-01-08, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The U.S. Justice Department said Wednesday that it will release special counsel Jack Smith's findings on Donald Trump's efforts to undo the results of the 2020 presidential election but will keep under wraps for now the rest of the record focused on the president-elect's hoarding of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate.


The revelation was made in a filing to a federal appeals court that was considering a defense request to block the release of the two-volume report while charges remain pending against two Trump co-defendants in the Florida case accusing the Republican former president and current president-elect of illegally holding classified documents.


Aileen Cannon, the Trump-appointed judge presiding over the classified documents case, granted the request Tuesday, issuing a temporary block on the report.


The Justice Department said it would proceed with plans to release the first of two volumes centered on the election interference case but would make the classified documents section of the report available only to the chairs and ranking members of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees for their private review as long as the case against Trump's co-defendants is ongoing.


"This limited disclosure will further the public interest in keeping congressional leadership apprised of a significant matter within the Department while safeguarding defendants' interests," the filing said.

## Trump asks Supreme Court to block sentencing in his hush money case in New York

date: 2025-01-08, from: VOA News USA

Washington — President-elect Donald Trump is asking the Supreme Court to call off Friday's sentencing in his hush money case in New York. 


Trump's lawyers turned to the nation's highest court Wednesday after New York courts refused to postpone the sentencing by Juan M. Merchan, the judge who presided over Trump's trial and conviction last May on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. 


Trump's attorneys asked for an immediate stay of Friday's sentencing "to prevent grave injustice and harm to the institution of the Presidency and the operations of the federal government." 


The Supreme Court asked for a response from New York prosecutors by Thursday. 


Merchan has indicated he will not impose jail time, fines or probation. 


Trump's attorneys have pointed to the Supreme Court's ruling giving him broad immunity from criminal prosecution as they tried to have his New York conviction tossed out. 


While that opinion came in a different case, Trump's lawyers say it means some of the evidence used against him in his hush money trial should have been shielded by presidential immunity. Merchan has disagreed.

And unlike the tax credits they replaced, which had fixed time periods they were in effect, the tech neutral credits either begin phasing out in 2032 or when electricity sector greenhouse gas emissions are a quarter of their 2022 level, whichever comes second. “With Trump set to take office again in less than two weeks, these rules will be cast into doubt almost as soon as they’re rolled out,” <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/tech-neutral-energy-tax-credit-final?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz---RACoTZQExt6RT7A13RGH0Q2MRJMkaUWOtmJh9NA992qhXUQHufxjt9wPvo4EcbMOVyqp" target="_self">wrote Heatmap’s Matthew Zeitlin</a>. “So the administration is trying to cast the tax credits as a money-saving proposition for energy consumers — especially households — and a spur for investment across the country.”</p><h3>4.

## US says forces struck Houthi weapons stores in Yemen

date: 2025-01-08, from: VOA News USA

Sanaa — The U.S. military said Wednesday its forces hit weapons storage facilities used by Yemen's Houthi rebels to attack American warships and commercial vessels.



The operation involved "multiple precision strikes," U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) said in a statement, adding "there were no injuries or damage to US personnel or equipment,"



The statement did not specify the location of the storage facilities.



"The strikes are part of CENTCOM's effort to degrade Iranian-backed [Houthi] attempts to threaten regional partners and military and merchant vessels in the region," it said.



The Houthis' Al-Masirah TV said there were five raids in the northwestern Amran province and two in Sanaa province, where the capital Sanaa is located.



The Houthis seized Sanaa in 2014 from Yemen's internationally recognized government and control much of the war-torn country's most populated areas.



For more than a year they have been firing missiles and drones at Israel and at ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, in what they say is a show of solidarity with Palestinians during the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.



The Houthis' attacks in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden have destabilized a vital shipping lane, prompting strikes by the United States and sometimes Britain that began in January 2024.



Most Houthi missiles and drones launched towards Israel have been intercepted, but a missile wounded 16 people in Tel Aviv in December, according to Israel's military and emergency services.

## Have China’s Emissions Already Peaked?

	Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p><blockquote>
<strong>Jesse Jenkins: </strong>So there’s sort of two key variables here. And we hit both those: the growth rate in new clean energy supplies, particularly in the electricity sector, and then the pace of demand growth. And this has been the story globally, the argument that we actually haven’t really seen any energy transition, only energy addition, right? We’re adding enough new clean energy, maybe, to meet growth, but not actually to drive down emissions, which would require us to exceed the growth rate and demand, right? So we can eat into the market share of existing fossil generation.<br/>
<br/>
	And that’s sort of the fundamental equation in China as well, right? Is if demand is growing rapidly, more rapidly than, clean electricity additions, emissions go up. And if the opposite is true, emissions go down. There’s also, it seems like, some evidence that the economy itself is slowing, or at least going through a bit of a structural change, right? So still growing, but not growing, perhaps, at the target rates that government has set. I think the expectations for this year, if I’m not mistaken, are under 5% growth, maybe 4.5% to 4.7% — so, you know, in U.S. terms, that’s still quite rapid, but in Chinese terms, a bit slower than the goal. And part of that is a slowdown in the construction industry — is that right? — which is another major driver of emissions due to cement consumption and steel consumption.
	<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Lauri Myllyvirta:</strong> Yeah, so I’m a bit allergic to talking about the economy as a whole — you know, “the economy” is slowing down, or “the economy” is speeding up. Because the economy is, of course, made up of a lot of different sectors, and in order to understand energy demand, those sectors are not created equal. So if you have a 5% GDP growth that comes from service industries, from consumer-facing industries, that can mean much less than 5% growth in energy demand. And that’s what China was seeing until the Covid period.<br/>
<br/>
	China was actually making a pretty big deal out of improving the energy, or reducing the energy-intensity of the economy. And that’s what stopped in 2020. So since 2020, there has been essentially no reduction in the energy intensity, energy consumption, and GDP has grown at the same rate. And when you consider the fact that there is a lot of technical improvement still going on, different processes are getting more energy efficient, then that means that the structure of the economy has, in fact, gotten 
	<em><em>more</em></em> energy-intensive. And that’s the key concern. The less than 5% growth now is driving faster growth in total energy demand than the 6%, even 7% growth was during the previous decade.

## Thousands flee, homes destroyed as Los Angeles wildfires burn out of control

date: 2025-01-08, from: VOA News USA

LOS ANGELES — California firefighters battled wind-whipped wildfires that tore across the Los Angeles area, destroying homes, clogging roadways as tens of thousands fled and straining resources as officials prepared for the situation to worsen early Wednesday.


The flames from a fire that broke out Tuesday evening near a nature preserve in the inland foothills northeast of LA spread so rapidly that staff at a senior living center had to push dozens of residents in wheelchairs and hospital beds down the street to a parking lot. The residents waited there in their bedclothes as embers fell around them until ambulances, buses and even construction vans arrived to take them to safety.


Another blaze that started hours earlier ripped through the city’s Pacific Palisades neighborhood, a hillside area along the coast dotted with celebrity residences and memorialized by the Beach Boys in their 1960s hit “Surfin' USA.” In the frantic haste to get to safety, roadways became impassable when scores of people abandoned their vehicles and fled on foot, some toting suitcases.




The traffic jam on Palisades Drive prevented emergency vehicles from getting through and bulldozer was brought in to push the abandoned cars to the side and create a path. Video along the Pacific Coast Highway showed widespread destruction of homes and businesses along the famed roadway.


Pacific Palisades resident Kelsey Trainor said the only road in and out of her neighborhood was blocked. Ash fell all around them while fires burned on both sides of the road.


“We looked across and the fire had jumped from one side of the road to the other side of the road,” Trainor said. “People were getting out of the cars with their dogs and babies and bags, they were crying and screaming."


A third wildfire started around 10:30 p.m. local time and quickly prompted evacuations in Sylmar, a San Fernando Valley community that is the northernmost neighborhood in Los Angeles. The causes of all three fires were under investigation.


Flames were being pushed by Santa Ana winds topping 97 kph in some places. The winds were expected to increase overnight, producing isolated gusts that could top 160 kph in mountains and foothills — including in areas that haven’t seen substantial rain in months.


The situation prompted the Los Angeles Fire Department to take the rare step of putting out a plea for off-duty firefighters to help. It was too windy for firefighting aircraft to fly, further hampering the fight.


The erratic weather caused President Joe Biden to cancel plans to travel to inland Riverside County, where he was to announce the establishment of two new national monuments in the state. He remained in Los Angeles, where smoke was visible from his hotel, and was briefed on the wildfires. The Federal Emergency Management Agency approved a grant to help reimburse California for the firefighting cost.


Officials didn't give an estimate of structures damaged or destroyed in the Pacific Palisades wildfire, but they said about 30,000 residents were under evacuation orders and more than 13,000 structures were under threat. Gov. Gavin Newsom visited the scene and said many homes had burned.


By evening the flames had spread into neighboring Malibu and several people there were being treated for burn injuries and a firefighter had a serious head injury and was taken to a hospital, according to Los Angeles Fire Department Capt. Erik Scott.


Things were expected to worsen overnight.


“By no stretch of the imagination are we out of the woods,” Newsom warned residents, saying the worst of the winds were expected to continue through the night. He declared a state of emergency.


As of Tuesday evening, nearly 167,000 people were without power in Los Angeles county, according to the tracking website PowerOutage.us, due to the strong winds.


Recent dry winds, including the notorious Santa Anas, have contributed to warmer-than-average temperatures in Southern California, where there’s been very little rain so far this season. Southern California hasn’t seen more than 0.25 centimeters of rain since early May.


The Pacific Palisades fire started in the late morning local time and quickly consumed about 11.6 square kilometers and sent up a dramatic plume of smoke visible across Los Angeles.


The neighborhood, which borders Malibu about 32 kilometers west of downtown LA, includes hillside streets of tightly packed homes along winding roads nestled against the Santa Monica Mountains and stretches down to beaches along the Pacific Ocean.


Long-time Palisades resident Will Adams said he immediately went to pick his two kids up from St. Matthews Parish School when he heard the fire was nearby. Meanwhile, he said embers flew into his wife's car as she tried to evacuate.


“She vacated her car and left it running,” Adams said. She and many other residents walked down toward the ocean until it was safe.


Adams said he had never witnessed anything like this in the 56 years he’s lived there. He watched as the sky turned brown and then black as homes started burning. He could hear loud popping and bangs “like small explosions,” which he said he believes were the transformers exploding.


“It is crazy, it’s everywhere, in all the nooks and crannies of the Palisades. One home’s safe, the other one’s up in flames,” Adams said.


Actor James Woods posted footage of flames burning through bushes and past palm trees on a hill near his home. The towering orange flames billowed among the landscaped yards between the homes.


“Standing in my driveway, getting ready to evacuate,” Woods said in the short video on X.


Some trees and vegetation on the grounds of the Getty Villa were burned by late Tuesday, but staff and the museum collection remain safe, Getty President Katherine Fleming said in a statement. The museum located on the eastern end of the Pacific Palisades is a separate campus of the world-famous Getty Museum that focuses on the art and culture of ancient Greece and Rome. The fire also burned Palisades Charter High School.


Film studios canceled two movie premieres due to the fire and windy weather, and the Los Angeles Unified School District said it temporarily relocated students from three campuses in the Pacific Palisades area.

## Venezuela's Maduro says 2 US citizens arrested, branded as 'mercenaries'

date: 2025-01-08, from: VOA News USA

CARACAS, VENEZUELA — Two U.S. citizens have been arrested in Venezuela, part of a group of seven whom President Nicolas Maduro on Tuesday branded as "mercenaries" in the latest roundup ahead of the embattled leader's expected inauguration to a new term later this week.


Maduro said the detained U.S. citizens were "very high level" but did not provide further details or evidence of the arrests.


"Just today we've captured seven foreign mercenaries, including two important mercenaries from the United States," said Maduro, who is set to take office for a third term on Friday following last July's contested election that the opposition says it won in a landslide.


Maduro said the group of detainees includes two Colombians who he said were captured in unspecified parts of Venezuela, as well as three others who came from the war in Ukraine.


Neither the U.S. Department of State nor Colombia's Foreign Ministry responded immediately to requests for comment.


Venezuelan rights groups have warned of a revolving door of prisoners, with fresh detentions coming in even as older prisoners are released, including arrests of foreign nationals.


In late 2023, Venezuela's government released dozens of prisoners including 10 Americans after months of negotiations between Caracas and Washington, while the U.S. released a close ally of Maduro, Colombian businessman Alex Saab.


In remarks delivered from the Miraflores presidential palace, Maduro on Tuesday claimed that his government's security forces have captured what he called 125 foreign mercenaries from 25 different countries who he said had entered the South American nation "to practice terrorism against the Venezuelan people."


The remarks come as opposition presidential candidate Edmundo Gonzalez is touring the region in a bid to grow his international support. Gonzalez has been declared president-elect by several governments, including the United States.


On Monday, outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden said Gonzalez was the "true winner" of the July 28 vote.


While the government-aligned electoral authority and Venezuela's top court have decreed that Maduro won the election, the government has not released ballot-box level results to back up the claim.


The opposition, however, has published thousands of scanned copies of voting machine receipts its observers gathered days after the vote, accounting for over 80% of votes cast and showing a lopsided Gonzalez victory.

## Biden administration asks court to block plea deal for alleged 9/11 mastermind

date: 2025-01-08, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The Biden administration on Tuesday asked a federal appeals court to block a plea agreement for accused 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and two co-defendants that would spare them the risk of the death penalty. 


The Justice Department argued in a brief filed with a federal appeals court in the District of Columbia that the government would be irreparably harmed if the guilty pleas were accepted. It said the government would be denied a chance for a public trial and the opportunity to "seek capital punishment against three men charged with a heinous act of mass murder that caused the death of thousands of people and shocked the nation and the world." 


The military judge at Guantanamo Bay and a military appeals panel rejected Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's effort to throw out the plea agreement, saying he had no power to do so after the senior Pentagon official for Guantanamo approved it in July. 


Mohammed was due to enter his guilty plea on Friday and his two co-defendants next week. 


The Justice Department brief said the defendants, by contrast, would not be harmed by a short delay, given that the prosecution has been ongoing since 2012 and the plea agreements would likely result in them serving long prison sentences, potentially for the rest of their lives. 


"A short delay to allow this Court to weigh the merits of the government's request in this momentous case will not materially harm the respondents," the government argued.

## 30,000 ordered to flee Los Angeles-area wildfire; 13,000 structures threatened

date: 2025-01-08, from: VOA News USA

LOS ANGELES — Firefighters scrambled to corral a fast-moving wildfire in the Los Angeles hillsides dotted with celebrity homes as a fierce windstorm hit Southern California on Tuesday. The blaze could be seen for miles as scores of residents abandoned their cars and fled on foot to safety as roads became blocked. 


About 30,000 residents are under evacuation orders and more than 13,000 structures are under threat, said Kristin Crowley, fire chief of the Los Angeles. Fire Department. 


California Governor Gavin Newsom said he saw "many structures already destroyed." Officials did not give an exact number of structures damaged or destroyed in the blaze. 


The cause of the fire was not immediately known, and no injuries had been reported, officials said at a news conference Tuesday afternoon. 


Newsom warned residents across Southern California not to assume they are out of danger, saying the worst of the winds are expected between 10 p.m. Tuesday and 5 a.m. Wednesday. 


Forecasters predicted the windstorm would last for days, producing isolated gusts that could top 160 kilometers per hour (100 miles per hour) in mountains and foothills — including in areas that haven't seen substantial rain in months. The National Weather service said it could be the strongest Santa Ana windstorm in more than a decade across Los Angeles and Ventura counties. 


Roughly half a million utility customers were at risk of their power being shut off to reduce the risk of the equipment sparking blazes. 


In the Pacific Palisades neighborhood in western Los Angeles, a fire swiftly consumed about 5 square kilometers (2 square miles) of land, sending up a dramatic plume of smoke visible across the city. Residents in Venice Beach, about 10 kilometers (6 miles) away, reported seeing the flames. It was one of several blazes across the area. 


Sections of Interstate 10 and the scenic Pacific Coast Highway were closed to all non-essential traffic to aid in evacuation efforts. Other roads were blocked. Some residents jumped out of their vehicles to escape the danger and waited to be picked up. 


Resident Kelsey Trainor said the only road in and out of her neighborhood was completely blocked. Ash fell all around them while fires burned on both sides of the road. 


"We looked across and the fire had jumped from one side of the road to the other side of the road," Trainor said. "People were getting out of the cars with their dogs and babies and bags, they were crying and screaming. The road was just blocked, like full-on blocked for an hour." 


An Associated Press journalist saw the roof and chimney of one home in flames and another residence where the walls were burning. The neighborhood that borders Malibu about 32 kilometers (20 miles) west of downtown Los Angeles includes hillside streets of tightly packed homes along winding roads nestled against the Santa Monica Mountains and stretches down to beaches along the Pacific Ocean. 


Long-time Palisades resident Will Adams said he had never seen a fire this low into the neighborhood in the 56 years he's lived there. 


"It is crazy, it's everywhere, in all the nooks and crannies of the Palisades," he said. "One home's safe, the other one's up in flames." 


Adams watched as the sky turned brown and then black as homes started burning. He could hear loud popping and bangs "like small explosions," which he said he believes were the transformers exploding on the electric poles. 


Actor James Woods posted footage of flames burning through bushes and past palm trees on a hill near his home. The towering orange flames billowed among the landscaped yards between the homes. 


Actor Steve Guttenberg, who lives in the Pacific Palisades, urged people who abandoned their cars to leave their keys behind so they could be moved to make way for fire trucks. 


"This is not a parking lot," Guttenberg told KTLA. "I have friends up there and they can't evacuate. … I'm walking up there as far as I can moving cars." 


The winds will act as an "atmospheric blow-dryer" for vegetation, bringing a long period of fire risk, said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist with the University of California, Los Angeles and the National Center for Atmospheric Research. 


"We really haven't seen a season as dry as this one follow a season as wet as the previous one," Swain said Monday. 


Recent dry winds, including the notorious Santa Anas, have contributed to warmer-than-average temperatures in Southern California, where there's been very little rain so far this season.

## Peter Yarrow of folk music trio Peter, Paul and Mary dies at 86

date: 2025-01-08, from: VOA News USA

LOS ANGELES — Peter Yarrow, the singer-songwriter best known as one-third of Peter, Paul and Mary, the folk-music trio whose impassioned harmonies transfixed millions as they lifted their voices in favor of civil rights and against war, has died. He was 86.


Yarrow, who also co-wrote the group's most enduring song, "Puff the Magic Dragon," died Tuesday in New York, publicist Ken Sunshine said. Yarrow had bladder cancer for the past four years.


"Our fearless dragon is tired and has entered the last chapter of his magnificent life. The world knows Peter Yarrow the iconic folk activist, but the human being behind the legend is every bit as generous, creative, passionate, playful, and wise as his lyrics suggest," his daughter Bethany said in a statement.


During an incredible run of success spanning the 1960s, Yarrow, Noel Paul Stookey and Mary Travers released six Billboard Top 10 singles and two No. 1 albums and won five Grammys.


They also brought early exposure to Bob Dylan by turning two of his songs, "Don't Think Twice, It's All Right" and "Blowin' in the Wind," into Billboard Top 10 hits as they helped lead an American renaissance in folk music. They performed "Blowin' in the Wind" at the 1963 March on Washington at which the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his famous "I Have a Dream" speech.


After an eight-year hiatus to pursue solo careers, the trio reunited in 1978 for a "Survival Sunday," an anti-nuclear-power concert that Yarrow had organized in Los Angeles. They would remain together until Travers' death in 2009. Upon her passing, Yarrow and Stookey continued to perform both separately and together.


 




Born May 31, 1938, in New York, Yarrow was raised in an upper-middle-class family he said placed high value on art and scholarship. He took violin lessons as a child, later switching to guitar as he came to embrace the work of such folk music icons as Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger.


Upon graduating from Cornell University in 1959, he returned to New York, where he worked as a struggling Greenwich Village musician until connecting with Stookey and Travers. Although his degree was in psychology, he had found his true calling in folk music at Cornell when he worked as a teaching assistant for a class in American folklore his senior year.


Soon after returning to New York, he met impresario Albert Grossman, who would go on to manage Dylan, Janis Joplin and others and who at the time was looking to put together a group that would rival the Kingston Trio, which in 1958 had a hit version of the traditional folk ballad "Tom Dooley."


But Grossman wanted a trio with a female singer and a member who could be funny enough to keep an audience engaged with comic patter. For the latter, Yarrow suggested a guitar-strumming Greenwich Village comic he'd seen named Noel Stookey.


Stookey, who would use his middle name as a member of the group, happened to be a friend of Travers, who as a teenager had performed and recorded with Pete Seeger and others.


After months of rehearsal, the three became an overnight sensation when their first album, 1962's eponymous "Peter, Paul and Mary," reached No. 1 on the Billboard chart. Their second, "In the Wind," reached No. 4 and their third, "Moving," put them back at No. 1.


From their earliest albums, the trio sang out against war and injustice in songs like Seeger's "If I Had a Hammer" and "Where Have all the Flowers Gone," Dylan's "Blowin' in the Wind" and "When the Ship Comes In," and Yarrow's own "Day is Done."


They could also show a soft and poignant side, particularly on "Puff the Magic Dragon," which Yarrow had written during his Cornell years with college friend Leonard Lipton.


It tells the tale of Jackie Paper, a young boy who embarks on countless adventures with his make-believe dragon friend until he outgrows such childhood fantasies and leaves a sobbing, heartbroken Puff behind. As Yarrow explains: "A dragon lives forever, but not so little boys."


After recording their last No. 1 hit, a 1969 cover of John Denver's "Leaving on a Jet Plane," the trio split up the following year to pursue solo careers.


That same year Yarrow had pleaded guilty to taking indecent liberties with a 14-year-old girl who had come to his hotel room with her older sister to ask for autographs. The pair found him naked when he answered the door and let them in. Yarrow, who resumed his career after serving three months in jail, was pardoned by President Jimmy Carter in 1981. Over the decades, he apologized repeatedly.


Over the years, Yarrow continued to write and co-write songs, including the 1976 hit "Torn Between Two Lovers" for Mary MacGregor. He received an Emmy nomination in 1979 for the animated film "Puff the Magic Dragon."


Later songs include the civil rights anthem "No Easy Walk to Freedom," co-written with Margery Tabankin, and "Light One Candle," calling for peace in Lebanon.


In addition to his wife and daughter, he is survived by a son, Christopher, and a granddaughter, Valentina.

## Meta to offer wider range of speech on platforms, CEO says

date: 2025-01-08, from: VOA News USA

OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA — Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced Tuesday that there would be a wider range of speech on Facebook and other Meta platforms.


"We're going to get back to our roots around free expression on Facebook and Instagram," he said.


Here are some of the key changes:


Gone will be third-party fact-checkers eyeing Facebook posts for violations in the United States. Instead, Facebook will rely on "community notes," a system used on X (formerly Twitter) that allows community members to flag posts and vote on the legitimacy of them.


Restrictions on topics such as immigration and gender identity will be lifted.


"What started as a movement to be more inclusive has increasingly been used to shut down opinions and shut out people with different ideas, and it's gone too far. So, I want to make sure that people can share their beliefs and experiences on our platforms," Zuckerberg said.


Civic and political content, which the company stopped presenting to users in recent years, will be recommended again on Facebook, Instagram and Threads.


And the firm's trust and safety and content moderation teams will move from California, considered a liberal state, to Texas, considered a conservative-leaning state. The move "will help us build trust to do this work in places where there is less concern about the bias of our teams," he said.


Preparing for Trump 


Zuckerberg's announcement comes as Meta and other technology companies prepare for major policy and regulatory changes with the return of President-elect Donald Trump to the White House this month.


In his attacks on the dominant technology companies, known collectively as Big Tech, Trump has been particularly critical of Meta, which suspended his account in 2021 after the January 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol Building. His accounts were restored in 2023.


At a press conference Tuesday, Trump was asked about Zuckerberg's announcement.


"Honestly, I think they've come a long way," he said. He said the firm was "probably" responding to his threats that he had planned to do something about Big Tech and censorship.


Reactions mixed 


"This is cool," Elon Musk said of the Meta announcement. Musk bought Twitter in 2023 and renamed it X and is a close adviser to Trump.


X Corp. CEO Linda Yaccarino said on X that "fact-checking and moderation doesn't belong in the hands of a few select gatekeepers who can easily inject their bias into decisions. It's a democratic process that belongs in the hands of many."


Also on X, Representative Jim Jordan, a Republican from Ohio and chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, praised Zuckerberg's announcement as a "huge step in the right direction."


"Social media, AI, and other technology companies must resist governments' censorship pressure and instead work to ensure the open expression of ideas on their platforms," Jordan posted. "We hope that other Big Tech companies, including Google, follow the lead of X and Meta in upholding freedom of speech online."



Kate Starbird, a University of Washington professor of human-centered design and engineering, said on the social media site Bluesky that Meta's decision will hamper people's ability to find out the truth.



"One remaining concern for me is that even people who WANT to find accurate information are going to be challenged to do it, because we're going to lose the groups that do this fact-checking work — unless non-profits step in to fill what is going to be a huge funding gap," she posted.


Yoel Roth, a former head of Twitter's trust and safety department, said on Bluesky that he was "genuinely baffled by the unempirical assertion that Community Notes 'works.' Does it? How do Meta know? The best available research is pretty mixed on this point."


'Too many mistakes' 



In his statement Tuesday, Zuckerberg described a complex system of filters the company created to identify "legitimately bad stuff out there. Drugs, terrorism, child exploitation."


But the systems, while well-intentioned, made mistakes, resulting in wrongly censored postings, he said.


"We've reached a point where it's just too many mistakes and too much censorship," he said.


The company will be "dialing back" content filters that scanned for policy violations with the goal to "dramatically reduce the amount of censorship on our platforms," Zuckerberg said.


Joel Kaplan, Meta's chief global affairs officer, said in a separate statement that "too much harmless content gets censored, too many people find themselves wrongly locked up in 'Facebook jail,' and we are often too slow to respond when they do."


Biden 'repeatedly pressured' 


Without offering examples, Zuckerberg said in August that the U.S. government under the Biden administration pushed for censorship. In August, Zuckerberg said in a letter to Jordan that Biden officials "repeatedly pressured" Facebook to take down some COVID-19 content, including humor and satire.


"By going after us and other American companies, it has emboldened other governments to go even further," Zuckerberg said Tuesday. "But now we have the opportunity to restore free expression, and I'm excited to take it."

## US lawmakers honor former President Jimmy Carter in Capitol Rotunda

date: 2025-01-08, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON  — U.S. lawmakers honored Jimmy Carter on Tuesday, as the body of the nation's 39th president arrived to lie in state in the U.S. Capitol.


"Today, we gather to celebrate the life of a man whose works will echo for generations to come," Vice President Kamala Harris said to the distinguished guests and members of Carter's family assembled in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda.




Carter, a one-term Democratic president and Nobel Peace Prize winner, will lie in state in Washington for two days, allowing the American public to pay its final respects.


Harris recognized Carter's role in brokering the Camp David Accords, instituting ethics reforms and founding the departments of Education and Energy.


Congressional leadership also recalled his presidency, which occurred during a tumultuous time in American history.


"President Carter's life, his selfless service, his fight against cancer and his lasting contributions to his fellow man are all truly remarkable," Speaker of the House Mike Johnson said. "President Carter was willing to roll up his own sleeves to serve and get the job done."




Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor earlier Tuesday that Carter was "one of the most decent men ever to hold the office of president. He was a gentleman in every sense of the word: kind, honorable, intelligent, humble, deeply patriotic. These are the virtues he brought to the Oval Office, in an era where trust in government was arguably at a low in the 20th century."


Carter's presidency began while the nation was still recovering from the aftermath of the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal, the latter of which resulted in the resignation of President Richard Nixon and the decline of American trust in public institutions.


Carter's term (1977-1981) was marked by economic inflation and crises in Iran and Afghanistan.


"President Carter was a man who served his country. He loved America. I didn't agree with all of his policies, but you could agree with his patriotism," Republican Representative Ralph Norman told VOA.


Carter was the longest-living U.S. president, dying at 100 years old. His post-White House career traveling the world engaged in diplomacy and charity work redefined how American presidents lived after their terms in office.


"Jimmy Carter had a presidency at a time of tumult — the Iranian hostage crisis, inflation. Frankly, not dissimilar to Joe Biden's presidency in some respects," Republican Representative Mike Lawler told VOA. "But I think Jimmy Carter has always been viewed by the American people as a decent man, someone who really cared deeply about this country and its people and certainly in his post-presidential life was very focused on what he could do to help the American people and his work with Habitat for Humanity."


According to the Architect of the Capitol, only 46 individuals have lain in state or in honor in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda since the nation's founding. Carter's remains will return to his home state of Georgia on Thursday for a private family burial.


Kateryna Lisunova and Mykhailo Komadovsky contributed to this report.

## Man who exploded Tesla Cybertruck in Las Vegas used generative AI, police say

date: 2025-01-07, from: VOA News USA

LAS VEGAS — The highly decorated soldier who exploded a Tesla Cybertruck outside the Trump hotel in Las Vegas used generative AI including ChatGPT to help plan the attack, Las Vegas police said Tuesday.


A laptop, cellphone and watch are still under review nearly a week after 37-year-old Matthew Livelsberger fatally shot himself just before the truck blew up.


An investigation of Livelsberger's searches through ChatGPT indicate he was looking for information on explosive targets, the speed at which certain rounds of ammunition would travel and whether fireworks were legal in Arizona.


Kevin McMahill, sheriff of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, called the use of generative AI a "game-changer" and said the department was sharing information with other law enforcement agencies.


"This is the first incident that I'm aware of on U.S. soil where ChatGPT is utilized to help an individual build a particular device," he said. "It's a concerning moment."


During a roughly half-hour-long news conference, Las Vegas police and federal law enforcement officials unveiled new details about the New Year's Day explosion.


Among the details law enforcement disclosed: Livelsberger stopped during the drive to Las Vegas to pour racing-grade fuel into the Cybertruck, which then dripped the substance. The vehicle was loaded with 27 kilograms (60 pounds) of pyrotechnic material, and officials are still uncertain exactly what detonated the explosion but said it could have been the flash from the firearm that Livelsberger used to fatally shoot himself.


Livelsberger, an Army Green Beret who deployed twice to Afghanistan and lived in Colorado Springs, Colorado, left notes saying the explosion was a stunt meant to be a "wake up call" for the nation's troubles, officials said last week.


He left cellphone notes saying he needed to "cleanse" his mind "of the brothers I've lost and relieve myself of the burden of the lives I took."


The explosion caused minor injuries to seven people but virtually no damage to the Trump International Hotel. Authorities said that Livelsberger acted alone.


Livelsberger's letters touched on political grievances, societal problems and domestic and international issues, including the war in Ukraine. He wrote that the U.S. was "terminally ill and headed toward collapse."


Investigators had been trying to determine if Livelsberger wanted to make a political point, given the Tesla and the hotel bearing the president-elect's name.


Livelsberger harbored no ill will toward President-elect Donald Trump, law enforcement officials said. In one of the notes he left, he said the country needed to "rally around" Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

## The Biden Administration Is Pitching Trump on Its Final Clean Energy Tax Credits

And unlike the tax credits they replaced, which had fixed time periods they were in effect, the tech neutral credits either begin phasing out in 2032 or when electricity sector greenhouse gas emissions are a quarter of their 2022 level, whichever comes second.</p><p>It’s not lost on anyone at Treasury or in the Biden administration that with Trump set to take office again in less than two weeks, these rules will be cast into doubt almost as soon as they’re rolled out. The administration is thus making an effort to cast the tax credits as a money-saving proposition for energy consumers — especially households — and a spur for investment across the country.</p><p>On Monday, the power market forecasting firm Aurora Energy Research <a href="https://auroraer.com/media/reform-to-clean-energy-tax-credits/" target="_blank">released an analysis</a> finding that scrapping certain IRA provisions, including the technology neutral credits, would “result in $336 billion less investment, 237 gigawatts less clean energy generation capacity, and at least 97,000 net fewer American jobs by 2040.” But what will likely catch the attention of policymakers is its conclusion that “consumers could see monthly household energy bills rise by an average of 10%, with states like Texas facing an increase of up to 22% compared to a scenario with continued tax credit support.” </p><p>Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo emphasized America’s energy competitiveness on a call with reporters Monday about the final rules. “The tech neutral ITC and PTC” — that is, investment tax credit and production tax credit — “will drive innovation by creating conditions for new zero-emission technologies to develop over time,” Adeyemo said. These policies together constitute an “energy moon shot,” he added, “because they reward innovation and innovative technologies developed in America to drive down energy costs while creating good paying jobs.”</p><p>Whether these arguments will convince to the Trump administration we will soon find out. While some Republicans have lined up in support of Inflation Reduction Act tax credits that have led to jobs in their districts, the incoming economic braintrust has taken a dim view of the bill, and Congress will be on the hunt for any spare dollar they can find to offset the costs of extending the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Trump’s incoming chair of the Council of Economic Advisors, Stephen Miran, has described the IRA, along with <a href="https://manhattan.institute/article/brittle-versus-robust-reindustrialization" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>other Biden industrial policy initiatives</u></a> like the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the CHIPS Act, as “tilting at windmills to boost politically favored sectors that can survive only with permanent subsidization.” Trump’s designee for the Secretary of Treasury, Scott Bessent, <a href="https://manhattan.institute/article/the-fallacy-of-bidenomics-a-return-to-central-planning" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has said the IRA</u></a> “will severely distort the supply side of the economy by crowding out investment in more productive sectors.”</p><p>While specific technologies have long been popular with specific Republicans — see “wind” and “Chuck Grassley” — lumping together the technologies along with a variety of bonuses designed to achieve Democratic policy goals around serving specific communities or workers could put the entire edifice of clean energy support at risk. </p><p>A few weeks ago, the Treasury released final rules governing the <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/final-investment-tax-credit-rules" target="_self"><u>old tax credits</u></a>, which were also updated under the IRA. Projects would qualify for 48E and 45Y for projects placed into service this year or later, while those that began construction before the end of the year could still qualify for the old credits. Many analysts think that even if the IRA were adjusted or repealed, an administrative process could be put in place to protect credits for projects that have already started. </p><p>In any case, in just 13 days, we’ll start getting answers, or at least putting the theories to the test.</p>

And so it proved that Trump’s wide-ranging comments at Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday hit some familiar <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-fact-check-intro" target="_self"><u>climate and energy falsehoods</u></a> alongside some eyebrow-raising new ones, the largest-scale of which was probably his threat to reverse President Biden’s newly announced <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/biden-offshore-drilling-ban" target="_self"><u>drilling ban</u></a>. </p><p>Biden signaled his move to permanently ban new offshore oil and gas drilling yesterday along most U.S. coastlines. The 625 million acres covered by the ban would include the entire East Coast, the eastern Gulf of Mexico, the Pacific off the coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California, and parts of the Northern Bering Sea in Alaska. “I will reverse it immediately,” Trump remarked of the ban. “It’ll be done immediately. And we will drill, baby, drill.” He also added that “we’re going to be drilling a lot of other locations,” and used the opportunity to call the energy transition “the green new scam,” <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-vance-green-new-deal" target="_self"><u>an old favorite of his</u></a>.</p><p>While Trump’s threats were alarming, they’re also most likely empty. The drilling ban would be considered permanent under the law, and Trump would not be able to simply reverse it without the approval of Congress.</p><p>In addition to his comments on drilling, Trump briefly criticized Biden’s “love” of <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-electric-vehicles-fact-check" target="_self"><u>electric cars</u></a>, and once again claimed that his administration was “going to be ending the electric car mandate quickly, by the way,” the lack of such a mandate notwithstanding. “This guy loves electric, and we don’t have enough electricity,” he said. “And then we have AI where we need more.” Trump isn’t necessarily wrong about “more” AI energy demand, and in case he’s reading this, we have a bit of <a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/data-center-solar-microgrids" target="_self"><u>recommended</u></a> <a href="https://heatmap.news/ideas/abundance-additionality-permitting-reform" target="_self"><u>background</u></a> for him on the topic.</p><p>Lest you think that Trump forgot his most beloved renewable energy talking point, he reiterated his hatred for wind power by adding, “We’re going to try and have a policy where no windmills are being built.” He noted “they don’t work without subsidy. … You don’t want energy that needs subsidy,” and repeated his <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-wind-solar-fact-check" target="_self"><u>blatantly false and conspiracy-driven claim</u></a> that “the windmills are driving the whales crazy,” noting that offshore wind caused the beaching of “two whales” in a “17-year period.” As a reminder, Lauren Gaches, the director of NOAA Fisheries Public Affairs, previously told Heatmap that “there is no scientific evidence that noise resulting from offshore wind site characterization surveys could potentially cause mortality of whales.” (Also worth noting: The oil and gas industry has long benefited from <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11528" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>generous tax subsidies</u></a>.)</p><p>Trump also went on to shout out … gas heaters? He claimed that Biden “wants everybody to have an electric heater instead of a gas heater,” adding that gas heaters are “much less expensive,” “work much better,” and don’t make you “scratch and itch.” It’s not clear whether was talking about heat pumps or electric resistance heaters, both of which are powered by electricity. But gas furnace sales have been outpaced by heat pumps for <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/heat-pumps-beat-gas-furnaces-2023" target="_self"><u>several years running</u></a>, with no widespread itch issues we can find. Trump also put low-flow showerheads on blast: “It’s called rain, comes down from heaven. And they want to do, no water comes out of the shower.” This hasn’t been true of low-flow shower heads for some time now, as my colleague Jeva Lange <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-energy-efficiency-fact-check" target="_self"><u>reported last summer</u></a>, which are “specifically designed to ‘push out water that feels like a higher pressure even with a lower flow rate.’”</p><p>In conclusion, there is no time like the present to peruse Jeva’s fact-check of <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-fact-check-intro" target="_self"><u>Trump’s climate and energy claims</u></a>.

## Trump: 'All hell will break out' if Hamas hostages not returned

date: 2025-01-07, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday held an omnibus press conference at his Florida estate, where he explained his stances on key foreign policy issues as he prepares to take office in two weeks.  


He forcefully called for the release of hostages seized in Israel more than a year ago by the militant group Hamas, saying six times that "all hell will break loose" otherwise.    


Hamas, which the United States considers a terrorist organization, dug in on its top demand in ongoing negotiations that Israel ends its assault and withdraw from Gaza. At a news conference in Algiers, Hamas official Osama Hamdan blamed Israel for stymieing a deal.  


When asked to respond to Trump's comments, Hamdan replied, "I think the U.S. president must make more disciplined and diplomatic statements." 


The Palestinian group's stunning terror attack on civilians in Israel sparked a brutal conflict that has since inflamed the region and killed tens of thousands of civilians.    


Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, had moments before joined the president-elect at the podium to brief reporters on his recent high-level talks in the region, saying his team is "on the verge" of a deal and that he would travel back in coming days.    


"I don't want to hurt your negotiation," Trump told Witkoff, "but if they're not back by the time I get into office, all hell will break out in the Middle East, and it will not be good for Hamas, and it will not be good, frankly, for anyone."    


On Ukraine, he expressed interest in meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin and repeated his vow to get the conflict in Ukraine "straightened out." Trump has not explained how he would do this.    


When asked about a key demand in Ukraine's peace plan — that it be allowed to join NATO — Trump said, "My view is that it was always understood" that Ukraine would not be admitted to the security alliance.    


He repeated his tariff threats against Canada and Mexico, his line that Canada should be a U.S. state, and he floated a name change, saying: "We're going to be changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America."    


Thessalia Merivaki, an associate teaching professor at Georgetown University, said Trump often uses bluster as a strategy.    


"So, Trump has a record of just floating controversial ideas and positions to attract attention and generate interest and media coverage," she said.    


Foreign policy  


Trump has not said how the U.S. will acquire control of Greenland, the large North American island that is an autonomous territory of Denmark. On Tuesday, he repeated his stance that "we need them for economic security."  


When asked directly if he would commit to not use military or economic coercion to back his increasingly voluble desire for control of Greenland and also the Panama Canal, Trump replied, "I can't assure you on either of those two."    


Trump has accused Panama of violating the treaty under which the U.S. ceded control of the famous canal more than four decades ago under former President Jimmy Carter.  


"Giving the Panama Canal to Panama was a very big mistake," Trump said. "Giving that away was a horrible thing, and I believe that's why Jimmy Carter lost the election."    


Trump added that he liked Carter "as a man." He is expected to attend Carter's national funeral Thursday in Washington. President Joe Biden will deliver the eulogy.  




First day and beyond  


Trump also said he would be "making major pardons" on his first day in office, when asked about his previous vow to issue clemency to some of the more than 1,500 people charged with crimes in connection to the riot on the Capitol on January 6, 2021.    


He also repeated past commitments to loosen what he called the "quagmire" of U.S. environmental regulations and smooth the path for billionaire investors.  


He described his re-election victory as a "landslide" for winning the Electoral College and the popular vote, although official results show he did not win the majority of the ballots, as third-party candidates shaved off votes. He promised to have future election results counted earlier on election night.  


He repeated his vow to "drill, baby, drill" on his first day in office by reversing Biden's recent orders seeking to protect against offshore drilling.    


He accused Biden of botching foreign policy, saying, "Now, I'm going into a world that's burning."


Trump will assume office on January 20.

## Trump special prosecutor temporarily blocked from releasing report on probe

date: 2025-01-07, from: VOA News USA

Washington — A U.S. judge temporarily blocked Special Counsel Jack Smith from releasing a report on his investigations into President-elect Donald Trump for his mishandling of classified documents and attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, a court order showed on Tuesday.


U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, who presided over the now-dismissed case accusing Trump of illegally holding onto classified documents, directed the Justice Department not to release the report until a federal appeals court rules on a request from Trump's two former co-defendants in the case.


Lawyers for the co-defendants, Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira, who were charged with obstructing the documents investigation, moved late Monday to block release of the report.


Nauta and De Oliveira argued the report would improperly interfere in their case, which remains ongoing.


Smith led both the classified documents case against Trump and a second prosecution accusing Trump of attempting to overturn his defeat in the 2020 election. Both cases have since been dropped.


Trump, who dismissed the federal probe and the two other criminal investigations he faced as a politically motivated attempt to block him from returning to power, said he welcomed the news.


"It was a fake case against a political opponent," Trump told reporters at his Florida resort on Tuesday. "If they're not allowed to issue the report, that's the way it should be ... that's great news."


A spokesperson for Smith's office declined to comment on the order.


Justice Department regulations require Smith, who plans to wrap up his probe before Trump returns to office on Jan. 20, to submit a final report to Attorney General Merrick Garland. Garland has previously pledged to make public all reports from special counsels during his tenure.


Prosecutors said in a court filing earlier on Tuesday that Garland, who appointed Smith, had not yet decided how to handle the portion of the report that relates to the classified documents case.  


Cannon, a Trump appointee, dismissed the case against Trump and his two co-defendants in July 2024 after ruling that Smith was improperly appointed. Prosecutors are appealing the ruling as it pertains to Nauta and De Oliveira.

## President-elect Donald Trump tries again to get Friday's hush money sentencing called off

date: 2025-01-07, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — President-elect Donald Trump tried again Tuesday to delay this week's sentencing in his hush money case, asking a New York appeals court to intervene as he fights to avoid the finality of his conviction before he returns to the White House. 


Trump turned to the Appellate Division of the state's trial court a day after the trial judge, Judge Juan M. Merchan, rebuffed his bid to indefinitely postpone sentencing and ordered it to go ahead as scheduled on Friday. 


Trump is seeking an emergency order that would spare him from being sentenced while he appeals Merchan's decision last week to uphold the historic verdict. Oral arguments were expected before a single judge later Tuesday, with a decision likely soon thereafter. 


A quick decision is necessary "to prevent ongoing violations" of Trump's constitutional rights "and a threatened disruption" of the presidential transition process, Trump lawyer Todd Blanche wrote in a filing with the Appellate Division. 


Trump, less than two weeks from his inauguration, is poised to be the first president to take office convicted of crimes. If his sentencing doesn't happen before his second term starts Jan. 20, presidential immunity could put it on hold until he leaves office. 




Merchan has signaled that he is not likely to punish Trump for his conviction on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records and will accommodate the transition by allowing him to appear at sentencing by video, rather than in person at a Manhattan courthouse. 


Still, the Republican and his lawyers contend that his sentencing should not go forward because the conviction and indictment should be dismissed. They have previously suggested taking the case all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. 


Merchan last Friday denied Trump's request to throw out his conviction and dismiss the case because of his impending return to the White House, ruling that Trump's current status as president-elect does not afford him the same immunity from criminal proceedings as a sitting president. 


Merchan wrote that the interests of justice would only be served by "bringing finality to this matter" through sentencing. He said giving Trump what's known as an unconditional discharge — closing the case without jail time, a fine or probation — "appears to be the most viable solution." 


In his filing Tuesday, Blanche argued that Merchan's interpretation of presidential immunity was wrong and that it should extend to a president-elect during "the complex, sensitive process of presidential transition." 


"It is unconstitutional to conduct a criminal sentencing of the president-elect during a presidential transition, and doing so threatens to disrupt that transition and undermine the incoming president's ability to effectively wield the executive power of the United States," Blanche wrote. 


Trump's lawyers are also challenging the judge's prior decision rejecting Trump's argument that the case should be thrown out because of the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling last July that gave presidents broad immunity from prosecution. 


Manhattan prosecutors have pushed for sentencing to proceed as scheduled, "given the strong public interest in prompt prosecution and the finality of criminal proceedings." 


Trump was convicted last May on charges involving an alleged scheme to hide a hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels in the last weeks of Trump's 2016 campaign to keep her from publicizing claims she'd had sex with him years earlier. He says that her story is false and that he did nothing wrong. 


The case centered on how Trump accounted for reimbursing his then-personal lawyer Michael Cohen, who had made the payment to Daniels. The conviction carried the possibility of punishment ranging from a fine or probation to up to four years in prison. 


Trump's sentencing initially was set for last July 11, then postponed twice at the defense's request. After Trump's Nov. 5 election, Merchan delayed the sentencing again so the defense and prosecution could weigh in on the future of the case.

## US determines Sudan's RSF committed genocide, sanctions leader

date: 2025-01-07, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The United States determined on Tuesday that members of Sudan's Rapid Support Forces and allied militias committed genocide in Sudan and it imposed sanctions on the group's leader over a conflict that has killed tens of thousands of people and driven millions from their homes.


U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement the RSF and aligned militias had continued to direct attacks against civilians, adding that they had systematically murdered men and boys on an ethnic basis and had deliberately targeted women and girls from certain ethnic groups for rape and other forms of sexual violence.


The militias have also targeted fleeing civilians and murdered innocent people escaping conflict, Blinken said.


"The United States is committed to holding accountable those responsible for these atrocities," Blinken said.


Washington announced sanctions on the leader of the RSF, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, who is also known as Hemedti, barring him from traveling to the United States and freezing any U.S. assets he might hold.


"For nearly two years, Hemedti’s RSF has engaged in a brutal armed conflict with the Sudanese Armed Forces for control of Sudan, killing tens of thousands, displacing 12 million Sudanese, and triggering widespread starvation," the Treasury Department said in a separate statement.


Sudan's army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces have been locked in conflict for more than 18 months, creating a humanitarian crisis in which U.N. agencies have struggled to deliver relief.


The war erupted in April 2023 amid a power struggle between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the RSF ahead of a planned transition to civilian rule.

## Trump Jr. arrives in Greenland after his father said US should own it

date: 2025-01-07, from: VOA News USA

The eldest son of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump arrived in Greenland on Tuesday for a private visit that heightened speculation that the incoming U.S. administration could seek to take control of the mineral-rich Danish territory.


The Danish state broadcaster reported that Donald Trump Jr.'s plane landed in Nuuk, capital of the vast and icy territory that has some 57,000 residents. Local media broadcast footage of him walking across a snowy tarmac.


In a statement, Greenland's government said that Trump Jr.'s visit would take place "as a private individual" and not as an official visit and that Greenlandic representatives would not meet with him. Greenland is an autonomous territory that's part of Denmark.


Mininguaq Kleist, permanent secretary for the Greenland Foreign Affairs department, told The Associated Press that authorities were informed that Trump Jr. would stay for about four to five hours.


Neither Trump Jr.'s delegation nor Greenlandic government officials had requested a meeting, Kleist said.


The visit nonetheless had political overtones.


The president-elect recently voiced a desire — also expressed during his first presidency — to acquire the territory in the Arctic, an area of strategic importance for the United States, China, Russia and others.


The world's largest island, Greenland sits between the Atlantic and Arctic oceans and is home to a large U.S. military base. It is 80% covered by an ice sheet.


"I am hearing that the people of Greenland are 'MAGA.' My son, Don Jr., and various representatives, will be traveling there to visit some of the most magnificent areas and sights," the president-elect posted on his social media site Monday night, referring to his "Make America Great Again" slogan.


"Greenland is an incredible place, and the people will benefit tremendously if, and when, it becomes part of our nation," Trump wrote. "We will protect it, and cherish it, from a very vicious outside world. MAKE GREENLAND GREAT AGAIN!"




Greenland Prime Minister Mute Egede has called for independence from Denmark, saying in a New Year's speech that it would be a way for Greenland to free itself from its colonial past. But Egede has also said he has no interest in Greenland becoming part of the United States, insisting that the island is not for sale.


Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Tuesday that the future of Greenland would be decided by Greenland and called the United States Denmark's most important ally.


Denmark's King Frederik X has been asserting the kingdom's rights to Greenland as well as the Faroe Islands, a self-governing archipelago located between Iceland and Norway in the North Atlantic Ocean.


Last month, the king changed Denmark's coat of arms to include fields that represent Greenland and the Faroe Islands. Greenland is represented by a silver bear with a red tongue. The royal announcement noted that since 1194, the royal coat of arms "visually symbolized the legitimacy and sovereignty of the state and the monarch."


"We are all united and each of us committed for the Kingdom of Denmark," the king said in his New Year's address, adding: "all the way to Greenland."


During his first term, the U.S. president-elect mused about purchasing Greenland, which gained home rule from Denmark in 1979. He canceled a scheduled trip to Denmark in August 2019 after its prime minister dismissed the idea.


Reviving the issue in a statement last month as he announced his pick for U.S. ambassador to Denmark, Trump wrote: "For purposes of national security and freedom throughout the world, the United States of America feels that the ownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity."


Trump's eldest son has become a prominent player in his father's political movement and has served on his presidential transition team, helping to select the people who will staff the incoming White House.

## Solar Microgrids for Data Centers? Not as Crazy as It Sounds!

date: 2025-01-07, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTQ1NzgwMC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3MTE4NTQwNn0.quUwjw4AsRcGh2WfeyPCzzwJIgEjyaO6RWCPYC2NwEY/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">After a year of concerted hand-wringing about the growing energy needs of data centers, a report that dropped just before the holidays proposed a solution that had been strangely absent from the discussion. </p>
<p>AI companies have seemingly grasped for every imaginable source of clean energy to quench their thirst for power, including pricey, left-field ideas like <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/microsoft-three-mile-island-nuclear-constellation" target="_self"><u>restarting shuttered nuclear plants</u></a>. Some are foregoing climate concerns altogether and ordering up <a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/coreweave-natural-gas" target="_self"><u>off-grid natural gas turbines</u></a>. In a pithily named new analysis — “Fast, scalable, clean, and cheap enough” — the report’s authors make a compelling case for an alternative: off-grid solar microgrids.</p>
<p>An off-grid solar microgrid is a system with solar panels, batteries, and small gas generators that can work together to power a data center directly without connecting to the wider electricity system. It can have infinite possible configurations, such as greater or smaller numbers of solar panels, and more or less gas-generated capacity. The <a href="https://www.offgridai.us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>report</u></a> models the full range of possibilities to illustrate the trade-offs in terms of emission reductions and cost.</p>
<p>An eclectic group of experts got together to do the research, including staffers from the payment company Stripe, a developer called Scale Microgrids, and Paces, which builds software to help renewable energy developers identify viable sites for projects. They found that an off-grid microgrid that supplied 44% of a data center’s demand from solar panels and used a natural gas generator the rest of the time would cost roughly $93 per megawatt-hour compared to about $86 for large, off-grid natural gas turbines — and it would emit nearly one million tons of CO2 less than the gas turbines. A cleaner system that produced 90% of its power from solar and batteries would cost closer to $109 per megawatt-hour, the authors found. While that’s more expensive than gas turbines, it’s significantly cheaper than repowering Three Mile Island, the fabled nuclear plant that Microsoft is bringing back online for an estimated $130 per megawatt-hour. </p>
<p>One challenge with solar microgrids is that they require a lot of land for solar panels. But a geospatial analysis showed that there’s more than enough available land in the U.S. southwest — primarily in West Texas — to cover estimated energy demand growth from data centers through 2030. This shouldn’t be taken as a recommendation, per se. The paper doesn’t interrogate the need for data centers or the trade-offs of building renewable power for AI training facilities versus to serve manufacturing or households. The report is just an exercise in asking whether, <em><em>if</em></em> these data centers are going to be developed, could they at least add as few emissions as possible? Not all hyperscalers care about climate, and those that do might still prioritize speed and scale over their net-zero commitments. But the authors argue that it’s possible to build these systems more quickly than it would be to install big gas turbines, which currently have at least three-year lead times to procure and fall under more complicated permitting regimes. </p>
<p>Before the New Year, I spoke with two of the authors — Zeke Hausfather from Stripe and Duncan Campbell from Scale Microgrids — about the report. Stripe doesn’t build data centers and has no plans to, but Hausfather works for a unit within the company called Stripe Climate, which has a “remit to work on impactful things,” he told me. He and his colleagues got interested in the climate dilemma of data centers, and enlisted Scale Microgrids and Paces to help investigate. Our conversation has been lightly edited for clarity.</p>
<p><strong>Why weren’t off-grid solar microgrids really being considered before?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Zeke Hausfather: </strong>As AI has grown dramatically, there’s been much more demand for data centers specifically focused on training. Those data centers have a lot more relaxed requirements. Instead of serving millions of customer requests in real time, they’re running these incredibly energy intensive training models. Those don’t need to necessarily be located near where people live, and that unlocks a lot more potential for solar, because you need about 50 times more land to build a data center with off-grid solar and storage than you would to build a data center that had a grid connection. </p>
<p>The other change is that we’re simply running out of good grid connections. And so a lot of the conversation among data center developers has been focused on, is there a way to do this with off-grid natural gas? We think that it makes a lot more sense, particularly given the relaxed constraints of where you can build these, to go with solar and storage, gas back-up, and substantially reduce the emissions impact.</p>
<p><strong>Duncan Campbell:</strong> It was funny, when Nan [Ransohoff, head of climate at Stripe] and Zeke first reached out to me, I feel like they convinced me that microgrids were a good idea, which was the first time this ever happened in my life. They were like, what do you think about off-grid solar and storage? <em><em>Oh, the energy density is way off, you need a ton of land.</em></em> They’re like, yeah, but you know, for training, you could put it out in the desert, it’s fine, and hyperscalers are doing crazy things right now to access this power. We just went through all these things, and by the end of the call, I was like, yeah, we should do this study. I wasn’t thinking about it this way until me, the microgrids guy, spoke to the payments company.</p>
<p><strong>So it’s just kind of against conventional logic?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Campbell: </strong>Going off-grid at all is wild for a data center operator to consider, given the historical impulse was, let’s have 3x more backup generators than we need. Even the off-grid gas turbine proposals out there feel a little nuts. Then, to say solar, 1,000 acres of land, a million batteries — it’s just so unconventional, it’s almost heretical. But when you soberly assess the performance criteria and how the landscape has shifted, particularly access to the grid being problematic right now, but also different requirements for AI training and a very high willingness to pay — as we demonstrate in our reference case with the Three Mile Island restart — it makes sense.</p>
<p><strong>Hausfather: </strong>We should be clear, when we talk about reliability, a data center with what we model, which is solar, batteries, and 125% capacity backup gas generators, is still probably going to achieve upwards of 99% reliability. It’s just not gonna be the 99.999% that’s traditionally been needed for serving customers with data centers. You can relax some of the requirements around that. </p>
<p><strong>Can you explain how you went about investigating what it would mean for data centers to use off-grid solar microgrids?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Campbell:</strong> First we just built a pretty simple power flow model that says, if you’re in a given location, the solar panel is going to make this much power every hour of the year. And if you have a certain amount of demand and a certain amount of battery, the battery is going to charge and discharge these times to make the demand and supply match. And then when it can’t, your generators will kick on. So that model is just for a given solar-battery-generator combo in a given location. Then what we did is made a huge scenario suite in 50-megawatt increments. Now you can see, for any level of renewable-ness you want, here’s what the [levelized cost of energy] is.</p>
<p><strong>Hausfather: </strong>As you approach 100%, the costs start increasing exponentially, which isn’t a new finding, but you’re essentially having to overbuild more and more solar and batteries in order to deal with those few hours of the year where you have extended periods of cloudiness. Which is why it makes a lot more sense, financially, to have a system with some gas generator use — unless you happen to be in a situation where you can actually only run your data center 90% of the time. I think that’s probably a little too heretical for anyone today, but we did include that as one of the cases.</p>
<p><strong>Did you consider water use? Because when you zoom in on the Southwest, that seems like it could be a constraint. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Hausfather: </strong>We talked about water use a little bit, but it wasn’t a primary consideration. One of the reasons is that how data centers are designed has a big effect on net water use. There are a lot of designs now that are pretty low — close to zero — water use, because you’re cycling water through the system rather than using evaporative cooling as the primary approach. </p>
<p><strong>What do you want the takeaway from this report to be? Should all data centers be doing this? To what extent do you think this can replace other options out there?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hausfather:</strong> There is a land rush right now for building data centers quickly. While there’s a lot of exciting investment happening in clean, firm generation like the enhanced geothermal that Fervo is doing, none of those are going to be available at very large scales until after 2030. So if you’re building data centers right now and you don’t want to cause a ton of emissions and threaten your company’s net-zero targets or the social license for AI more broadly, this makes a lot of sense as an option. The cost premium above building a gas system is not that big. </p>
<p><strong>Campbell:</strong> For me, it’s two things. I see one purpose of this white paper being to reset rules of thumb. There’s this vestigial knowledge we have that this is impossible, and no, this is totally possible. And it seems actually pretty reasonable. </p>
<p>The second part that I think is really radical is the gigantic scale implied by this solution. Every other solution being proposed is kind of like finding a needle in a haystack — if we find this old steel mill, we could use that interconnection to build a data center, or, you know, maybe we can get Exxon to make carbon capture work finally. If a hyperscaler just wanted to build 10 gigawatts of data centers, and wanted one plan to do it, I think this is the most compelling option. The scalability implied by this solution is a huge factor that should be considered.</p>

## Meta shelves fact-checking program in US, adopts X-like 'Community Notes' model

date: 2025-01-07, from: VOA News USA

Meta is ending its fact-checking program in the U.S. and replacing it with a "Community Notes" system similar to that on Elon Musk-owned X, the Facebook parent said on Tuesday.  


The Community Notes model will allow users on Meta's social media sites Facebook, Instagram and Threads to call out posts that are potentially misleading and need more context, rather than placing the responsibility on independent fact checking organizations and experts.  


"Experts, like everyone else, have their own biases and perspectives. This showed up in the choices some made about what to fact check and how ... A program intended to inform too often became a tool to censor," Meta said.  


Meta added that its efforts over the years to manage content across its platforms have expanded "to the point where we are making too many mistakes, frustrating our users and too often getting in the way of the free expression we set out to enable." 


The company said it would begin phasing in Community Notes in the United States over the next couple of months and would improve the model over the course of the year. 


It will also stop demoting fact-checked content and use a label notifying users there is additional information related to the post, instead of the company's current method of displaying full-screen warnings that users have to click through before even viewing the post.

## High winds force Biden to cancel event announcing two new national monuments

date: 2025-01-07, from: VOA News USA

LOS ANGELES — Dangerously high winds forced U.S. President Joe Biden to cancel a trip Tuesday to the Eastern Coachella Valley, where he was to announce the creation of two new national monuments in California that will honor Native American tribes.


Winds began gaining strength across Southern California as forecasters warned of "life-threatening, destructive" gusts. The president was in his limousine ready to leave Los Angeles when the event was canceled. The White House initially said Biden would speak in Los Angeles but later announced the event would be rescheduled at the White House next week at a time when others could attend.


The National Weather Service said it could be the strongest Santa Ana windstorm in more than a decade and it will peak in the early hours of Wednesday, when gusts could reach 129 kilometers per hour. Isolated gusts could top 160 kph in mountains and foothills.


Biden's announcement was part of his administration's effort to conserve at least 30% of U.S. lands and waters by 2030 through his "America the Beautiful" initiative. But the cancellation of the trip was also a stark reminder of another administration priority: climate change and the increasing effects of extreme weather.


The proclamations name the Chuckwalla National Monument in Southern California near Joshua Tree National Park and the Sattitla National Monument in Northern California. The declarations bar drilling and mining and other development on the 2,400-square-kilometer Chuckwalla site and roughly 800 square kilometers near the Oregon border in Northern California.


The new monuments protect clean water for communities, honor areas of cultural significance to tribal nations and Indigenous peoples and enhance access to nature, the White House said.


Biden, who has two weeks left in office, announced Monday he will ban new offshore oil and gas drilling in most U.S. coastal waters, including in California and other West Coast states. The plan is intended to block possible efforts by the incoming Trump administration to expand offshore drilling.




The flurry of activity has been in line with the Democratic president's "America the Beautiful" initiative launched in 2021, aimed at honoring tribal heritage, meeting federal goals to conserve 30% of public lands and waters by 2030 and addressing climate change.


The Pit River Tribe has worked to get the federal government to designate the Sattitla National Monument. The area is a spiritual center for the Pit River and Modoc Tribes and encompasses mountain woodlands and meadows that are home to rare flowers and wildlife.




Several Native American tribes and environmental groups began pushing Biden to designate the Chuckwalla National Monument, named after the large desert lizard, in early 2023. The monument would protect public lands south of Joshua Tree National Park, spanning the Coachella Valley region in the west to near the Colorado River.


Advocates say the monument will protect a tribal cultural landscape, ensure access to nature for residents and preserve military history sites.


"The designation of the Chuckwalla and Sattitla National Monuments in California marks an historic step toward protecting lands of profound cultural, ecological and historical significance for all Americans," said Carrie Besnette Hauser, president and CEO of the nonprofit Trust for Public Land.


The new monuments "honor the enduring stewardship of Tribal Nations and the tireless efforts of local communities and conservation advocates who fought to safeguard these irreplaceable landscapes for future generations,'' Hauser said.


Senator Alex Padilla of California called the new monuments a major victory that will safeguard the state's public lands for generations to come.


Designation of the Chuckwalla monument "accelerates our state's crucial efforts to fight the climate crisis, protect our iconic wildlife, preserve sacred tribal sites and promote clean energy," Padilla said. The new Sattitla monument, meanwhile, ensures that land that has "long served as the spiritual center for the Pit River and Modoc Nation" will "endure for generations to come," Padilla said.


The Chuckwalla monument is intended to honor tribal sovereignty by including local tribes as co-stewards, following in the footsteps of a recent wave of monuments such as the Bears Ears National Monument in Utah, which is overseen in conjunction with five tribal nations.


"The protection of the Chuckwalla National Monument brings the Quechan people an overwhelming sense of peace and joy," the Fort Yuma Quechan Tribe said in a statement. "Tribes being reunited as stewards of this landscape is only the beginning of much-needed healing and restoration, and we are eager to fully rebuild our relationship to this place."


In May, the Biden administration expanded two national monuments in California — the San Gabriel Mountains in the south and Berryessa Snow Mountain in the north. In October, Biden designated the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary along the coast of central California, which will include input from the local Chumash tribes in how the area is preserved.


Last year, the Yurok Tribe in Northern California also became the first Native people to manage tribal land with the National Park Service under a historic memorandum of understanding signed by the tribe, Redwood National and State Parks and the nonprofit Save the Redwoods League, which is conveying the land to the tribe.

## Blinken visits Japan as Nippon Steel decision weighs on relations

date: 2025-01-07, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON/TOKYO — U.S. President Joe Biden's decision to block Nippon Steel's $14.9 billion bid for U.S. Steel cast a shadow over Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to Japan on Tuesday for farewell meetings with Washington's most important ally in Asia.


The rejection, announced on Friday, has jolted U.S. efforts to boost ties with Asian allies just as South Korea's political crisis potentially complicates a revived relationship between Washington, Seoul and Tokyo. The trilateral alliance is a key plank in the countries' efforts to counter China's military buildup.




Investment into the U.S. could also be chilled, but analysts say any damage to the wider U.S.-Japan relationship will likely be limited given shared security concerns about China.


On Monday, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba described Biden's decision to block the sale of U.S. Steel to Nippon Steel as "perplexing."


Accompanied by White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, Blinken met Japan's Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya in Tokyo and will hold talks later in the day with Ishiba and other senior Japanese officials


Numerous trips to Japan over the last four years "is evidence, not just of the importance, but of the centrality the United States attaches to our partnership. President Biden asked me to come on this last trip to underscore that," Blinken told Iwaya.


"We have, between our two countries, a partnership that started out focusing on bilateral issues, that worked on regional issues and that now is genuinely global," he added.


Ahead of his trip, the State Department said that Blinken wanted to build on the momentum of U.S.-Japan-South Korea trilateral cooperation.




In Seoul on Monday, Blinken reaffirmed confidence in South Korea's handling of its political turmoil as investigators there sought an extension of a warrant to arrest impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol.


Allies of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump have also reassured Seoul and Tokyo that he will support continuing to improve ties and advance military, economic and diplomatic cooperation to counter China and North Korea, Reuters reported ahead of Trump's Nov. 5 re-election.


Tension, limited damage from Nippon Steel decision 


Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel filed a lawsuit on Monday charging that Biden violated the U.S. Constitution by blocking their $14.9 billion merger through what they termed a sham national security review. They called for the U.S. federal court to overturn the decision.




Nicholas Szechenyi, a Japan expert at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Biden's decision would make Blinken's Tokyo visit "awkward."

## The next round of bitter cold and snow will hit the southern US

date: 2025-01-07, from: VOA News USA

Annapolis, Maryland — The next round of bitter cold was set to envelop the southern U.S. on Tuesday, after the first significant winter storm of the year blasted a huge swath of the country with ice, snow and wind.


The immense storm system brought disruption even to areas of the country that usually escape winter’s wrath, downing trees in some Southern states, threatening a freeze in Florida and causing people in Dallas to dip deep into their wardrobes for hats and gloves.


By early Tuesday, wind chill temperatures could dip as low as minus 10.5 C from Texas across the Gulf Coast, according to the National Weather Service. A low-pressure system is then expected to form as soon as Wednesday near south Texas, bringing the potential of snow to parts of the state that include Dallas, as well as to Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana.


The polar vortex that dipped south over the weekend kept much of the country east of the Rockies in its frigid grip Monday, making many roads treacherous, forcing school closures, and causing widespread power outages and flight cancellations.


Ice and snow blanketed major roads in Kansas, western Nebraska and parts of Indiana, where the National Guard was activated to help stranded motorists. The National Weather Service issued winter storm warnings for Kansas and Missouri, where blizzard conditions brought wind gusts of up to 72 kph. The warnings extended to New Jersey into early Tuesday.


A Kentucky truck stop was jammed with big rigs forced off an icy and snow-covered Interstate 75 on Monday just outside Cincinnati. A long-haul driver from Los Angeles carrying a load of rugs to Georgia, Michael Taylor said he saw numerous cars and trucks stuck in ditches and was dealing with icy windshield wipers before he pulled off the interstate.


“It was too dangerous. I didn’t want to kill myself or anyone else,” he said.


The polar vortex of ultra-cold air usually spins around the North Pole, but it sometimes plunges south into the U.S., Europe and Asia. Studies show that a fast-warming Arctic is partly to blame for the increasing frequency of the polar vortex extending its grip.


Temperatures plunge across the country

The eastern two-thirds of the U.S. dealt with bone-chilling cold and wind chills Monday, with temperatures in some areas far below normal.


A cold weather advisory will take effect early Tuesday across the Gulf Coast. In Texas’ capital of Austin and surrounding cities, wind chills could drop as low as minus 9.4 C.


The Northeast was expected to get several cold days.


Transportation has been tricky

Hundreds of car accidents were reported in Virginia, Indiana, Kansas and Kentucky, where a state trooper was treated for non-life-threatening injuries after his patrol car was hit.


Virginia State Police responded to at least 430 crashes Sunday and Monday, including one that was fatal. Police said other weather-related fatal accidents occurred Sunday near Charleston, West Virginia, and Monday in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Kansas saw two deadly crashes over the weekend.


More than 2,300 flights were canceled and at least 9,100 more were delayed nationwide as of Monday night, according to tracking platform FlightAware. Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport reported that about 58% of arrivals and 70% of departures had been canceled.


A record of more than 20 centimeters of snow fell Sunday at the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, leading to dozens of flight cancellations that lingered into Monday. About 10 centimeters fell Monday across the Cincinnati area, where car and truck crashes shut at least two major routes leading into downtown.


More snow and ice are expected

In Indiana, snow covered stretches of Interstate 64, Interstate 69 and U.S. Route 41, leading authorities to plead with people to stay home.


“It’s snowing so hard, the snow plows go through and then within a half hour the roadways are completely covered again,” State Police Sgt. Todd Ringle said.


Tens of thousands are without power

Many were in the dark as temperatures plunged. More than 218,000 customers were without power Monday night across Kentucky, Indiana, Virginia, West Virginia, Illinois, Missouri and North Carolina, according to electric utility tracking website PowerOutage.us.


In Virginia’s capital city, a power outage caused a temporary malfunction in the water system, officials said Monday afternoon. Richmond officials asked those in the city of more than 200,000 people to refrain from drinking tap water or washing dishes without boiling the water first. The city also asked people to conserve their water, such as by taking shorter showers.


City officials said they were working nonstop to bring the system back online.

## How Carter’s covert aid to Afghan rebels redefined his foreign policy record

date: 2025-01-07, from: VOA News USA

President Ronald Reagan is often credited with defeating the Soviet Union, in part by helping Afghan rebels, but it was the administration of President Jimmy Carter that laid the groundwork.

 

Considered a foreign policy novice by many when he entered the White House, Carter made the early decision to provide covert aid to Afghan insurgents months before the Soviet invasion. The move offers a window into one of the defining issues of his presidency, showing a president unafraid to confront the Soviets while pursuing a policy of détente.

 

“I think people’s image of Carter as a deeply religious man, a deeply moral man, is very much influenced by the activities he’s done after he left office. [But] he definitely had a ruthless side to him, and he had a side that was very willing to use force, including nuclear weapons,” said David Gibbs, a history professor at the University of Arizona. 


The covert aid program initiated under Carter became the backbone of the Afghan insurgency, setting the stage for the Soviet Union’s eventual withdrawal in 1989.

 

In a bold move six months before the Soviets' December 1979 invasion, Carter signed a secret directive known as a “presidential finding” that authorized the CIA to provide nonlethal aid to rebels fighting Afghanistan’s Soviet-backed communist government.


That finding stayed under wraps for nearly two decades, coming to light only when several Carter administration officials, including former CIA Director Robert Gates and national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski, disclosed its existence in the 1990s, suggesting the Carter administration aimed to lure the Soviets into a Vietnam-style quagmire.


‘Afghan trap’


Brzezinski’s revelations were the most striking. In a 1998 interview with a French magazine, Carter’s Polish-born, ardently anti-communist adviser denied provoking the Soviets but claimed the administration had “knowingly increased the probability” of a Soviet invasion. Calling the program “an excellent idea,” he said it had the “effect of drawing the Russians into the Afghan trap.”


Although Brzezinski later disputed the accuracy of the interview and never repeated the claim, the so-called “Afghan trap” thesis gained traction, with critics excoriating the Carter administration for instigating the Soviet invasion and causing decades of conflict in Afghanistan.


Among scholars who see the aid program as a deliberate provocation, Gibbs said he was initially loath to read too much into the Brzezinski interview before becoming convinced of its veracity.


As Gibbs described it to VOA, a military aide once told historian Jonathan Haslam that Brzezinski, upon learning of the Soviet invasion, “pumped his first in the air in triumph and said, ‘They’ve taken the bait!’”


“The implication was that the decision to supply aid to the mujahideen was bait,” Gibbs said. “That, to me, is a strong indication that what he said is true, because it was said twice over a period of time, and it’s from the horse’s mouth.”


The Afghan trap thesis has permeated the works of other prominent experts, although most now dismiss it as baseless, according to historian Conor Tobin of the University College Dublin, who has researched it.


The problem with the theory, Tobin argues, is that it views the Carter administration’s involvement in Afghanistan through a 21st century lens, “working backwards from the events of 9/11.”


“They rely almost exclusively on Gates’ memoirs, the controversial French interview and other circumstantial and limited anecdotal evidence without exploring the subject in detail, and without using any other sources to corroborate the statements made,” Tobin told VOA via email.


A close look at recently declassified Carter-era documents tells a different story, Tobin said.


“It reveals that there was no attempt to ensnare the Soviet Union in the Afghan trap, and U.S. policies were in fact marginal in leading to the Soviet military intervention,” he said.




Nonlethal aid


What is not up for debate, however, is that the aid program was launched in response to rising Soviet influence in Afghanistan. A communist coup in April 1978 toppled the government of President Mohammad Daoud. The new regime then initiated radical reforms, sparking public opposition and eventually a full-blown insurgency.


According to Tobin, the Carter administration initially took a “wait-and-see” approach. That policy ended with the kidnapping and murder of U.S. Ambassador Adolph Dubs the following February. Brzezinski then ordered a new plan for Afghanistan.


“Should we help any insurgents?” he asked an aide to investigate, according to Tobin. “With whom would we have to work?”


A popular revolt in the western Afghan city of Herat, however, “led to a shift in attitude in Washington and the consensus began to slide towards a more active role,” Tobin wrote in his analysis, “The Myth of the ‘Afghan Trap’.” 


CIA operatives sprang into action, developing a plan of action while reaching out to U.S. allies Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Several options were formulated, ranging from small-scale propaganda campaigns and nonlethal support to lethal arms supplies and military training via a third country.


After determining that military assistance may “provoke vigorous Soviet countermeasures,” the administration settled on nonlethal aid.


“The decision-making process demonstrated caution, rather than an effort to induce an invasion,” Tobin wrote.


On July 3, 1979, Carter authorized the CIA to provide up to $695,000 in aid to the insurgents. By mid-August, $575,000 of the funds had been allocated for cash, medical equipment and radio transmitters to Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence, who then delivered them to the mujahideen, according to Tobin’s account.


The aid program, says Tobin, was modest but significant in two key respects. It helped establish links with the mujahideen through Pakistani intelligence that would prove invaluable after the Soviet invasion. It also underscored American resolve to allies Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, reassuring them at a time when concerns about diminishing U.S. influence in the region were mounting.


The aid program came against a backdrop of escalating Cold War tensions. The Iranian Revolution of February 1979 had robbed the U.S. of a key strategic ally in the region. Rather than seeking to provoke the Soviets, Brzezinski worried about a “creeping intervention” in Afghanistan, fearing ‘’Moscow would continue to expand its influence until a de factor invasion had taken place,’’ Tobin wrote. 


“The objectives in mid-1979 were essentially to do something, anything, to counter the Soviet advance in Afghanistan,” Tobin said.


Historian Scott Kaufman of Francis Marion University and author of a book on Carter’s foreign policy, said the late president also had to consider his bid for re-election the following year.


“He was already under attack for having ‘lost’ Nicaragua to communists and for being ‘soft’ on the Soviet Union,” Kaufman told VOA via email. “How would it look to voters if Carter, who wanted to get SALT II [Strategic Arms Limitations Talks] approved, made moves that encouraged what would be seen by them as further Soviet aggression.”


‘Carter Doctrine’


Kaufman took issue with the popular perception of Carter as a foreign policy novice. Though he lacked the foreign policy experience of a Richard Nixon or even Gerald Ford, Carter sat on the Trilateral Commission and had traveled overseas as governor of Georgia, Kaufman noted.


“That said, his support for the mujahideen reflected a foreign policy that since at least 1978 reflected a hardening insofar as U.S. policy toward the Soviet Union,” he said.


Carter’s tougher stance, Kaufman said, was driven by growing anti-Soviet sentiment in Congress, Brzezinski’s influence, and his personal disdain for Soviet repression and machinations.


“This does not mean that he had given up on seeking detente with the Soviets, as reflected by his desire to get SALT II ratified,” he said. “But his foreign policy vis-a-vis the U.S.S.R. [Soviet Union] demonstrated a preparedness to take a harder line.”


Nothing demonstrated Carter's resolve more forcefully than the “Carter Doctrine,” his bold Persian Gulf policy adopted in response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.


Unveiling the new policy during his 1980 State of the Union address, Carter warned that the U.S. was prepared to use “any means necessary” to prevent a Soviet takeover of the Persian Gulf region.


With the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the Carter administration upped the ante. On December 28, 1979, the day after Soviet commandos assassinated Afghan President Hafizullah Amin in Kabul, Carter signed a new finding that authorized the supply of weapons and training for the mujahideen. The first batch of weapons arrived in Pakistan in less than two weeks.


Carter went on to lose the 1980 election to Reagan, whose administration largely continued Carter’s Afghan policy for several years before dramatically building up the covert aid program to the tune of several hundred million dollars a year. Instead of merely harassing the Soviets, the Reagan administration sought its defeat, according to Tobin.


“The criticism of the Carter administration as weak on defense, therefore, is unjustified, with Carter largely laying the groundwork for the renewed global containment of the 1980s,” Tobin said.


“So, despite enduring orthodox assessments of Carter as a foreign policy failure, he departed office in January 1981 leaving a clear foreign policy direction for the incoming Reagan administration that arguably contributed to the end of the Cold War a decade later — an outcome that was almost incomprehensible as the Carter administration took office in January 1977.”

## U.S. accuses Russia of funding both sides of Sudan's war

date: 2025-01-07, from: VOA News USA

UNITED NATIONS — The United States accused Russia at the United Nations on Monday of funding the two warring parties in Sudan, an apparent step up from Washington's previous assertion that Moscow was playing both sides of the conflict to advance its political objectives.


The war erupted in April 2023 amid a power struggle between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) ahead of a planned transition to civilian rule, triggering the world's largest displacement and hunger crisis.


In November Russia vetoed a U.N. Security Council draft resolution that called on the warring parties to immediately cease hostilities and ensure the delivery of humanitarian aid. The remaining 14 council members voted in favor of the text.


"Russia chose obstruction: standing alone as it voted to imperil civilians, while funding both sides of the conflict – yes, that's what I said: both sides," the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., Linda Thomas-Greenfield, told the council on Monday, without giving further details.


When asked to elaborate, a spokesperson for the U.S. mission to the U.N. said Washington was aware of Russia's "ongoing interest in Sudan's gold trade" and condemns any material support for the warring parties – "whether it be through illicit gold trading or the provision of military equipment."


"We believe Sudanese authorities' gold mining cooperation with sanctioned Russian entities and individuals could prove inimical to Sudan's long-term interests and the aspirations of the Sudanese people for an end to the war," the U.S. mission to the U.N. spokesperson said.


In response, Russia's deputy U.N. Ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy said: "We regret that the U.S. tries to judge other world powers by its own yardstick."


"It's obvious that in the Pax Americana which our American colleagues try to preserve at any price, relations with other countries are built only on their exploitation and criminal schemes aimed at U.S. enrichment," he said.


Reuters was unable to immediately contact Sudan's warring parties for comment.


In December, Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia rejected what he called "fabrications spread by Western countries and their media" that Moscow was trying to play both sides to gain an advantage from the war.


At what she said would likely be her last council meeting, Thomas-Greenfield became visibly emotional while addressing her counterparts on Sudan, a crisis that has been a focus for her during her four years at the world body.


"For all the disappointment that I couldn't do more, that we – all of us – didn't do more – I still remain hopeful," she said. "Hopeful that the representatives sitting around this table – the colleagues who have become friends – will continue this sacred mission, this ultimate responsibility."


Thomas-Greenfield was appointed by President Joe Biden. Donald Trump will succeed Biden on Jan. 20.

## US adds Tencent, CATL to list of Chinese firms allegedly aiding Beijing's military

date: 2025-01-07, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK — The U.S. Defense Department said on Monday it has added Chinese tech giants including gaming and social media leader Tencent Holdings and battery maker CATL to a list of firms it says work with China's military.


The list also included chip maker Changxin Memory Technologies, Quectel Wireless and drone maker Autel Robotics, according to a document published on Monday.


The annually updated list of Chinese military companies, formally mandated under U.S. law as the "Section 1260H list," designated 134 companies, according to a notice posted to the Federal Register.


U.S.-traded shares of Tencent, which is also the parent of Chinese instant messaging app WeChat, fell 8% in over-the-counter trading. Tencent said in a statement that its inclusion on the list was "clearly a mistake." It added: "We are not a military company or supplier. Unlike sanctions or export controls, this listing has no impact on our business."


CATL called the designation a mistake, saying it "is not engaged in any military related activities."


A Quectel spokesperson said the company "does not work with the military in any country and will ask the Pentagon to reconsider its designation, which clearly has been made in error."


The other companies and the Chinese embassy in Washington did not respond to requests or did not immediately comment.


Amid strained relations between the world's two biggest economies, the updated list is one of numerous actions taken by Washington in recent years to highlight and restrict Chinese companies it says pose security risks.


Craig Singleton, a China expert at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said the additions showed that it was "reckless" for American firms to conduct business with a growing swath of Chinese corporations.


"The U.S. isn’t just safeguarding a handful of technologies anymore," he said. "The garden of sensitive technologies is growing, and the fence protecting them is being fortified. Today's list lays bare that these aren’t just commercial companies. They’re critical enablers of China’s military modernization, directly fueling Beijing’s strategic ambitions."


Other companies added include MGI Tech, which makes genomic sequencing instruments, and Origincell Technology, which lawmakers have alleged operates a cell bank network and bio-storage technologies. Neither firm immediately responded to requests for comments.


U.S. lawmakers had pushed the Pentagon throughout 2024 to add some of the companies, including CATL, to the list. Ford Motor is building a battery plant in Michigan and plans to license CATL technology to produce low-cost lithium-iron batteries at the facility -- a move that has sparked concerns by some lawmakers. Ford did not immediately comment on Monday.


While the designation does not involve immediate bans, it can be a blow to the reputations of affected companies and represents a stark warning to U.S. entities and firms about the risks of conducting business with them. It could also add pressure on the Treasury Department to sanction the companies.


Two previously listed companies, drone maker DJI and Lidar-maker Hesai Technologies, both sued the Pentagon last year over their previous designations but remain on the updated list.


The Pentagon also removed six companies it said no longer met the requirements for the designation, including AI firm Beijing Megvii Technology, China Railway Construction Corporation Limited, China State Construction Group Co. and China Telecommunications Corporation.

## Homes talk and tables walk at AI-dominated Consumer Electronics Show

date: 2025-01-07, from: VOA News USA

LAS VEGAS — Home appliances that do chores, cars that know your favorite cafe, and robot pets aiming to please are among artificial intelligence-infused offerings at the Consumer Electronics Show opening Tuesday.


All these will compete for attention at the annual CES extravaganza in Las Vegas, as vendors behind the scenes seek ways to deal with tariffs threatened by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump.


AI is once again a major theme of the show, along with autonomous vehicles ranging from tractors and boats to lawn mowers and golf club trollies.


South Korean consumer electronics giant LG kicked off a media day Monday by outlining a vision for "Affectionate Intelligence" in which home appliances watch over people — from tracking how well they sleep to making sure they remember umbrellas when rain is in the forecast.


“At LG, we're seamlessly integrating AI into physical living spaces around us,” said CEO William Cho.


"We see space not merely as a physical location but as an environment where holistic experiences come to life — across the Home, Mobility, Commercial and even Virtual spaces."


Before the show floor even opened, vendors enticed visitors with electric roller skates, hologram booths for life-size remote collaboration, and even a robot that looked like a lamp affixed to the top of a walking table.


Most offerings boasted being enhanced with AI.


“Everybody is going to be talking about AI ... whether it is there or not,” Creative Strategies analyst Carolina Milanesi told AFP.


AI on the move


CES will also be a gigantic auto show, with carmakers and those supplying software and parts showing off self-driving and automated safety capabilities.


“CES has been an auto show for a while now, and if anything, it is more so this year,” said Techsponential analyst Avi Greengart.

 

Tesla CEO Elon Musk's close relationship with Trump is expected to reduce regulatory speed bumps regarding autonomous vehicles.


And while still far from being a part of everyday life, flying cars will be part of the CES scene, according to independent tech analyst Rob Enderle.


“You should start seeing flying vehicles you can buy,” Enderle said. “Getting approval to fly them is a whole other matter.”


Robots designed to handle work tasks or be comforting companions — and even adorable pets — are among CES' exhibits.


Gadgets for calming the mind, beautifying the body, or helping get a sound night's sleep are on display as tech continues to seep into every aspect of existence.


"Digital health is going to be huge," said Greengart.


"We are seeing a lot more tech being worn or used to track your health markers."


AI-enhanced tech will also be infusing homes, from a spice dispenser that "learns" a cook's taste and robot swimming pool cleaners.


Tariff anxiety?


Tariffs talked about by Trump would raise costs for imported items, and that will likely be on the minds of CES attendees targeting the U.S. market, according to analysts.


A lot of the products at the show have imported components, and if Trump hits Canada, China and Mexico with tariffs, it will mean a spike in prices, analyst Enderle said.


"There will be a lot of concerned vendors at CES," Enderle said of the tariff trepidation.


Talk at CES will include how to navigate supply chain constraints that could be caused by tariffs, according to Greengart.


"But a lot of the talk will happen behind closed doors to not anger the coming administration," he added.


Chinese companies with significant U.S. presence, like smart television rivals TCL and Hisense, are at CES.


But Greengart warns of a "growing bifurcation of market between China and the rest of the world" as trade frictions play out.

## US dramatically shrinks Guantanamo prisoner population to 15 men

date: 2025-01-07, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden's administration slashed the prisoner population at Guantanamo Bay detention center in Cuba by nearly half on Monday, sending 11 detainees to Oman.


The U.S. military said only 15 detainees remained there after the transfer, following a major push toward closing the facility by Biden's administration in its final days in office.


The detention center was first opened on Jan. 11, 2002, by President George W. Bush to hold terrorism suspects and "illegal enemy combatants" during the U.S. "War on Terror" following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington.


Guantanamo Bay housed roughly 680 prisoners at the detention center's peak in 2003, according to Pentagon data.


The latest transfer of the 11 men, all of whom are from Yemen, leaves the U.S. naval base in Cuba with fewer detainees than when it opened with the arrival of prisoners from Afghanistan.


"The United States appreciates the willingness of the government of Oman and other partners to support ongoing U.S. efforts focused on responsibly reducing the detainee population and ultimately closing the Guantanamo Bay facility," the U.S. military said in a statement.


The Pentagon named the 11 men transferred as: Uthman Abd al-Rahim Muhammad Uthman, Moath Hamza Ahmed al-Alwi, Khalid Ahmed Qassim, Suhayl Abdul Anam al Sharabi, Hani Saleh Rashid Abdullah, Tawfiq Nasir Awad Al-Bihani, Omar Mohammed Ali al-Rammah, Sanad Ali Yislam Al Kazimi, Hassan Muhammad Ali Bib Attash, Sharqawi Abdu Ali Al Hajj and Abd Al-Salam Al-Hilah.


Of the remaining 15 detainees, the Pentagon said three are eligible for transfer and an equal number are eligible for a periodic review board to examine their cases. The remainder have been charged or convicted of war crimes.


The facility has long been criticized by human rights groups and legal advocates over potential breaches of international human rights laws and conditions at the camp.

## Minneapolis to revamp police training, force policies after George Floyd's murder

date: 2025-01-06, from: VOA News USA

MINNEAPOLIS — The Minneapolis City Council on Monday approved an agreement with the federal government to overhaul the city's police training and use-of-force policies in the wake of the murder of George Floyd. 


The deal incorporates and builds on changes the Minneapolis Police Department has made since Floyd, a Black man, was killed by a white officer in 2020, prompting a national reckoning with police brutality and racism. 


The 171-page agreement, filed in federal court shortly after the council's 12-0 vote, says the department will require its officers to “promote the sanctity of human life as the highest priority in their activities." It says officers must “carry out their law enforcement duties with professionalism and respect for the dignity of every person." And it says they must not allow race, gender or ethnicity “to influence any decision to use force, including the amount or type of force used.” 


The agreement, known as a consent decree, means the department will be under long-term court supervision. It had been under negotiation since the Department of Justice issued a scathing critique of the city’s police in June 2023. 


The report alleged that police systematically discriminated against racial minorities, violated constitutional rights and disregarded the safety of people in custody for years before Floyd’s killing. 


The Justice Department report was the result of a sweeping two-year investigation that confirmed many citizen complaints about police conduct. The investigation found that Minneapolis officers used excessive force, including “unjustified deadly force,” and violated the rights of people engaged in constitutionally protected speech. 


An independent monitor will oversee the changes, and a judge must approve them. 


During his first administration, President-elect Donald Trump was critical of consent decrees as anti-police. Finalizing the Minneapolis agreement before he returns to office Jan. 20 would make it harder for him to undercut the deal, because changes would require court approval. 


The council approved the deal 12-0 Monday during a brief public vote that followed an hours-long, closed-door discussion. 


“I’d like to thank our community for standing together, united in this, and for having patience with us as we have traveled a very, very long and challenging journey," Council President Elliott Payne said after the vote. "We’re just beginning, and we know we have a long way to go. Our success will only be realized when we all work together on what is arguably one of the most important issues in the life of our city.” 


Council Member Robin Wonsley said in a statement before the vote that she has “no faith that the Trump administration will be a serious partner" in implementing the agreement. 


“Having a federal consent decree signed and in place is valuable to police reform efforts, but we need to be sober about the fact that it will take local political will to hold the city and the (Mayor Jacob) Frey administration accountable to implementing and enforcing the terms of the consent decree,” she said. 


A state court judge in 2023 approved a similar agreement between Minneapolis and the Minnesota Department of Human Rights after the state agency issued its own blistering report in 2022. The state investigation found that the city's police had engaged in a pattern of race discrimination for at least a decade. 


The Justice Department has opened 12 similar investigations of state and local law enforcement agencies since April 2021, many in response to high-profile deaths at the hands of police. 


It has reached agreements with Seattle, New Orleans, Baltimore, Chicago and Ferguson, Missouri. A consent decree with Louisville, Kentucky, after an investigation prompted by the fatal police shooting of Breonna Taylor is awaiting court approval. In Memphis, Tennessee, the mayor last month pushed back against pressure for a consent decree there, saying his city has made hundreds of positive changes since the beating death of Tyre Nichols. 


Consent decrees require law enforcement to meet specific goals before federal oversight is removed, a process that often takes years and millions of dollars. A major reason Minneapolis hired Brian O’Hara as police chief in 2022 was his experience implementing a consent decree in Newark, New Jersey. 


If the Minneapolis federal agreement gets court approval, the city would be in the unusual position of operating under both federal and state consent decrees.

## Two Indian companies indicted in US for importing ingredients used in opioid fentanyl

date: 2025-01-06, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — Two Indian chemical companies have been indicted for allegedly importing ingredients for the highly addictive opioid fentanyl into the United States and Mexico, the U.S. Department of Justice said Monday. 


Athos Chemicals and Raxuter Chemicals, both based in Gujarat, were each charged in Brooklyn with distributing the ingredients and conspiring to distribute them. 


Raxuter and senior executive Bhavesh Lathiya, 36, were also charged with smuggling, and introducing misbranded drugs into interstate commerce. 


Lathiya was arrested on Saturday in New York and ordered detained pending trial, after prosecutors called him a flight risk and a substantial danger to the community. 


"The Justice Department is targeting every link in fentanyl trafficking supply chains that span countries and continents and too often end in tragedy in the United States," U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement.


A federal public defender representing Lathiya declined to comment. Athos and Raxuter did not immediately respond to similar requests outside business hours. 


Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid about 50 times more powerful than heroin and 100 times more powerful than morphine. 


Opioids accounted for about 82,000 U.S. deaths in 2022, 10 times the number in 1999, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 


Prosecutors said that since February 2024, the defendants supplied "precursor" chemicals they knew would be used to make fentanyl, and hid their efforts by mislabeling packages, falsifying customs forms, and making false declarations at border crossings. 


One indictment said that in October 2024 video calls with an undercover agent posing as a fentanyl manufacturer, Lathiya agreed to sell 20 kilograms of the precursor chemical 1-boc-4-piperidone, and suggested mislabeling them as an antacid. 


Lathiya did this after the agent told him his Mexico clients were "very happy with the quality of what you sent me," and with the "yield" from the resulting fentanyl, the indictment said. 


The other indictment said Athos agreed last February to sell 100 kilograms of the same chemical to a known drug trafficker in Mexico who was making fentanyl in connection with a drug trafficking organization. 


Lathiya faces up to 53 years in prison if convicted, the Justice Department said.

## Former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani found in contempt of court in defamation case

date: 2025-01-06, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — A judge on Monday found Rudy Giuliani to be in civil contempt of court in a case brought by two Georgia election workers that the former New York City mayor falsely accused of trying to help steal the 2020 U.S. presidential election for Democrat Joe Biden.


U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman in Manhattan said Giuliani had not complied with requests from the election workers, Ruby Freeman and her daughter Wandrea Moss, for information that could help them determine which of his assets may be turned over to pay off the defamation judgment.


"The fact that he is a busy person who in the past relied on others is not an excuse for noncompliance," Liman said.


The contempt citation in the district where Giuliani had been the top federal prosecutor marks a further fall from grace for Giuliani, once known as "America's Mayor" for his response to the September 11, 2001, attacks.


The ruling stems from a lawsuit Freeman and Moss brought against Giuliani in 2021. They accused the former personal lawyer to Republican President-elect Donald Trump of destroying their reputations by lying that they tried to help steal the 2020 election.


Giuliani made repeated false claims that a surveillance video showed the pair concealing and counting suitcases filled with illegal ballots at a basketball arena in Atlanta that was used to process votes.


Giuliani has been disbarred for making false claims about the 2020 election, and pleaded not guilty to criminal charges in Georgia and Arizona that he aided Trump's failed attempt to overturn his loss.


In July 2023, Giuliani conceded he made defamatory statements about Freeman and Moss, and a judge that August ruled he was liable for defamation as a sanction against him for failing to turn over electronic records to the two election workers.


A Washington, D.C., jury later ordered he pay Freeman and Moss roughly $73 million in compensation and $75 million as punishment.


Liman said on Monday he had not yet determined the punishment Giuliani would face for contempt.


But the judge also ruled that Giuliani had not responded to questions from Moss and Freeman about a Palm Beach, Florida, condominium he owns.


Liman said he would presume Giuliani's lack of response suggested the answers would be unfavorable to him at an upcoming Jan. 16 trial over whether he treated the condominium as his permanent residence. Freeman and Moss contend Giuliani did not live there full time, meaning it could be turned over.


Lawyers for Freeman and Moss have also urged Liman to hold Giuliani in contempt for ignoring his orders to give up his Manhattan apartment, the title to a 1980 Mercedes and sports memorabilia. That request is still pending.


Giuliani, 80, has claimed that his day-to-day life has been upended by the two election workers, making it difficult to obtain necessary paperwork, and that he has not "willfully disobeyed" any court orders.


Giuliani's lawyer, Joseph Cammarata, said on Monday that the time frame for Giuliani to respond to the election workers' demands was tight but that he sought to comply.


"There's been substantial compliance," Cammarata said. "There is no defiance to the court."

## Louisiana reports 1st bird flu-related death in US, state agency says

date: 2025-01-06, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The Louisiana Department of Health said Monday that a U.S. patient hospitalized with H5N1 bird flu had died, the country's first death from an outbreak of the virus that has sickened dozens of people and millions of poultry and cattle. 


Nearly 70 people in the U.S. have contracted bird flu since April, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, most of them livestock workers exposed to sick chickens or dairy cattle. 


The patient in Louisiana, the first person in the country to be hospitalized with the virus, contracted bird flu after exposure to a combination of backyard chickens and wild birds, said Louisiana health officials. The patient was hospitalized on Dec. 18, state health officials said. 


The patient was over 65 and had underlying medical conditions, the officials said. 


"While the current public health risk for the general public remains low, people who work with birds, poultry or cows, or have recreational exposure to them, are at higher risk," the department said in a statement.  


The CDC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

## US eases restrictions on Syria while keeping sanctions in place

date: 2025-01-06, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The U.S. on Monday eased some restrictions on Syria's transitional government to allow the entry of humanitarian aid after Islamist insurgents ousted Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad last month.


The U.S. Treasury Department issued a general license lasting six months that authorizes certain transactions with the Syrian government, including some energy sales and incidental transactions.


The move does not lift sanctions on the nation that has been battered by more than a decade of war but indicates a limited show of U.S. support for the new transitional government.


The general license underscores America's commitment to ensuring its sanctions "do not impede activities to meet basic human needs, including the provision of public services or humanitarian assistance," a Treasury Department statement said.


Treasury Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo said his agency "will continue to support humanitarian assistance and responsible governance in Syria."


Since Assad's ouster, representatives from the nation's new de facto authorities have said the new Syria will be inclusive and open to the world.




The U.S. has gradually lifted some penalties since Assad departed Syria for protection in Russia. The Biden administration in December decided to drop a $10 million bounty it had offered for the capture of a Syrian rebel leader whose forces led the ouster of Assad last month.


The announcement followed a meeting in Damascus between the leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS; Ahmad al-Sharaa, who was once aligned with al-Qaida; and the top U.S. diplomat for the Middle East, Barbara Leaf, who led the first U.S. diplomatic delegation into Syria since Assad's ouster. The U.S. and U.N. have long designated HTS as a terrorist organization.


HTS led a lightning insurgency that ousted Assad on Dec. 8 and ended his family's decades-long rule. From 2011 until Assad's downfall, Syria's uprising and civil war killed an estimated 500,000 people.


Much of the world ended diplomatic relations with Assad because of his crackdown on protesters and sanctioned him and his Russian and Iranian associates.


Most of the Western-led sanctions targeted Assad and his associates for the brutal crackdown on protesters and their manufacturing of the amphetamine-like stimulant Captagon, which reportedly generated billions of dollars as packages of the little white pills were smuggled across Syria's porous borders.


With Assad out of the picture, Syria's new authorities hope the international community will pour money into the country to rebuild its battered infrastructure and make its economy viable again.


Syria's infrastructure has been battered, with power cuts rampant in the country and some 90% of its population living in poverty. About half the population won't know where its next meal will come from as inflation surges.


The pressure to lift sanctions has mounted in recent years as aid agencies continue to cut programs due to donor fatigue and a massive 2023 earthquake that rocked Syria and Turkey. The tremor killed over 59,000 people and destroyed critical infrastructure that couldn't be fixed due to sanctions and overcompliance, despite the U.S. announcing some humanitarian exemptions.


Qutaiba Idlbi, a research fellow at the Atlantic Council who leads work on Syria, said ahead of the general license issuance:


"There is a general agreement," among regional and international governments, "that we need to avoid driving Syria back into chaos."


"The only path forward is to engage positively,” he said.

## US cyber watchdog: No signs Treasury breach hit other federal agencies

date: 2025-01-06, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The U.S. cyber watchdog agency CISA said Monday there was "no indication" the recently reported breach at the U.S. Treasury Department had affected any other federal agency. 


Late last month the U.S. Treasury reported that an unspecified number of computers had been compromised by Chinese hackers following a breach at contractor BeyondTrust, which provides cybersecurity services.  


BeyondTrust said last month that a limited number of clients were affected but has not elaborated. 


"As the forensic investigation is ongoing, BeyondTrust is unable to confirm the other customers who may or may not have been impacted," the company said Monday in an email. 


The Washington Post has reported that the hackers breached the U.S. Treasury office that administers economic sanctions, aiming to steal information about Chinese entities that the U.S. government might be considering designating for financial sanctions. 


Republican lawmakers have demanded a briefing about the breach, which is the latest in a series of intrusions blamed on Beijing. 


Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, has previously described the Treasury hack reports as "irrational" and represented "smear attacks" against China.

## The Cybertruck Is the Third-Best-Selling EV in America. It’s Also a Failure.

It’s likely that a slow start for the Cybertruck, Tesla’s only new model in recent memory, was a big cause of the slowdown. But we can’t tell you <em><em>exactly</em></em> how well or poorly the big truck is doing because the company won’t tell us.</p><p>Tesla delivered <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/tesla-sales-2024" target="_self"><u>1,789,226 total vehicles</u></a> to customers last year. The popular, reasonably affordable Model 3 or Model Y EVs made up more than 95% of those sales. The remainder were lumped into a group called “other models,” meaning Cybertruck and the long-in-the-tooth, expensive Model X and Model S, a move that has the same flavor as a Friday afternoon news dump. The “other models” accounted for just 85,133 deliveries, or 4.8% of Tesla’s total.</p><p>If you’ve been following Heatmap’s <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/ev-sales-q3-2024" target="_self"><u>coverage</u></a> then this comes as no surprise. Elon Musk & Co. sold just shy of 17,000 Cybertrucks during the third quarter of last year (July to September). That made the shiny metal beast the third-best-selling EV in America after Tesla’s two volume sellers. But Cybertruck was a distant third behind those two EVs. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Tesla delivered 23,640 “other models,” meaning that’s the maximum number of Cybertrucks it could have sold.</p><p>The writing for Tesla’s sales slump has been on the wall for years. A recent design refresh helped bump Model 3 sales, and the company is still working on a rumored update to the Model Y, the world’s best-selling EV, that might give Tesla a shot in the arm. But with Tesla’s future prospects <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/cheap-tesla" target="_self"><u>resting with the Cybercab</u></a> and other autonomous aspirations, the Cybertruck is the brand’s only current opportunity to boost its bottom line with a new vehicle.</p><p>Except that the stainless steel war rig was never a good candidate for high-volume sales. Cybertruck starts at $80,000. It has suffered embarrassing viral moments where the vehicle failed at basic truck tasks such as getting out of snow or sand. It comes with some cool amenities, such as the ability to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/10/hurricane-helene-electric-vehicle-power-outage/680106/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>back up one’s home power supply</u></a> via bidirectional charging.

Soon it became evident that demand for the vehicle wasn’t exactly red-hot. Musk at one point has claimed that a million people put their names down for a Cybertruck, but doing so cost only $100, so the length of that list doesn’t mean much. More telling was the report that Tesla was scrubbing the badging off the limited-edition Foundation series, which wasn’t selling, so it could offer the vehicles as ordinary Cybertrucks.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/3/24334954/tesla-cybertruck-sales-demand-expectation-elon-musk" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>The Verge</em></em></u></a> notes, how you’d grade the Cybertruck depends entirely on what you believe its potential to be. As a competitor to EV pickup trucks like the Rivian R1T, Ford F-150 Lightning, and Chevy Silverado EV, the Tesla is the king — Cybertruck is outselling all those models. But electric truck sales have been sluggish all along, making the Cybertruck the big fish in a pretty small pond.</p><p>If the Cybertruck’s raison d'etre was simply to bring Musk’s Mad Max daydream to life, then it has succeeded. But if the goal of the Cybertruck was to sell lots of cars, then it’s hard to argue it has been anything but a boondoggle.</p><p>The automakers nipping at Tesla’s heels in the EV market, including <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1hsr449/gm_us_2024_ev_sales_114432_up_50/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>GM</u></a> and <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/746147/kia-ev-sales-record-2024-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Hyundai/Kia</u></a>, have every reason to see a path to more growth, even with the lingering uncertainty of an <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-kill-ev-tax-credit" target="_self"><u>unfriendly new era</u></a> of American government. They’re rolling out new models and posting record sales. If they can continue to bring down the starting price of their electric models, lots of their customers could be ready to ditch fossil fuel engines. </p><p>But, at least for today, Tesla’s status it tethered to the Cybertruck, which doesn’t have a lot of room to grow. Once upon a time, Tesla teased a high-end version of the vehicle that would have <a href="https://www.cybertruckownersclub.com/forum/threads/you-ordered-the-500-miles-cybertruck-and-they-launch-with-the-350-miles-what-do-you-do.8946/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>500 miles of range</u></a>, as well as an entry-level Cybertruck that could start in the neighborhood of $50,000. Realizing either of those goals could make many drivers — at least those not immediately turned off at the thought of owning this thing — take a long look at the Cybertruck. Neither appears imminent.</p><p>Musk’s reaction to all this might be a shrug. Rather than rounding out his stable of cars with an affordable EV with the potential to sell in huge numbers, he has bet the farm on Tesla winning the autonomous vehicle race and tossed out the Cybertruck as a treat to his hardcore devotees. Now he must hope enough of them buy it to keep Tesla’s cratering stock price afloat while he chases the future.</p>

## US adds Tencent, CATL to list of Chinese firms allegedly aiding Beijing's military

date: 2025-01-06, from: VOA News USA

Washington/New York — The U.S. Defense Department said on Monday it has added Chinese tech giants including gaming and social media leader Tencent Holdings and battery maker CATL to a list of firms it says work with China's military.  


The list also included chip maker Changxin Memory Technologies, Quectel Wireless and drone maker Autel Robotics, according to a document published on Monday.


The annually updated list of Chinese military companies, formally mandated under U.S. law as the "Section 1260H list," designated 134 companies, according to a notice posted to the Federal Register.


U.S.-traded shares of Tencent, which is also the parent of Chinese instant messaging app WeChat, fell 8% in over-the-counter trading. Tencent said in a statement that its inclusion on the list was "clearly a mistake." It added: "We are not a military company or supplier. Unlike sanctions or export controls, this listing has no impact on our business."


CATL called the designation a mistake, saying it "is not engaged in any military related activities."


A Quectel spokesperson said the company "does not work with the military in any country and will ask the Pentagon to reconsider its designation, which clearly has been made in error."


The other companies and the Chinese embassy in Washington did not respond to requests or did not immediately comment.


Amid strained relations between the world's two biggest economies, the updated list is one of numerous actions taken by Washington in recent years to highlight and restrict Chinese companies it says pose security risks.


Craig Singleton, a China expert at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said the additions showed that it was "reckless" for American firms to conduct business with a growing swath of Chinese corporations.


"The U.S. isn’t just safeguarding a handful of technologies anymore," he said. "The garden of sensitive technologies is growing, and the fence protecting them is being fortified. Today's list lays bare that these aren’t just commercial companies. They’re critical enablers of China’s military modernization, directly fueling Beijing’s strategic ambitions."


Other companies added include MGI Tech, which makes genomic sequencing instruments, and Origincell Technology, which lawmakers have alleged operates a cell bank network and bio-storage technologies. Neither firm immediately responded to requests for comments.




U.S. lawmakers had pushed the Pentagon throughout 2024 to add some of the companies, including CATL, to the list. Ford Motor is building a battery plant in Michigan and plans to license CATL technology to produce low-cost lithium-iron batteries at the facility - a move that has sparked concerns by some lawmakers. Ford did not immediately comment on Monday.


While the designation does not involve immediate bans, it can be a blow to the reputations of affected companies and represents a stark warning to U.S. entities and firms about the risks of conducting business with them. It could also add pressure on the Treasury Department to sanction the companies.


Two previously listed companies, drone maker DJI and Lidar-maker Hesai Technologies, both sued the Pentagon last year over their previous designations, but remain on the updated list.  


The Pentagon also removed six companies it said no longer met the requirements for the designation, including AI firm Beijing Megvii Technology, China Railway Construction Corporation Limited, China State Construction Group Co and China Telecommunications Corporation.

## The Search for a Somewhat Sustainable Aviation Fuel

But this supply is limited by, well, the amount of cooking oil or fats restaurants and food processing facilities generate, and is thus projected to meet only about 10% of total SAF demand by 2050, according to a <a href="https://3stepsolutions.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/assets/custom/010856/downloads/Making-Net-Zero-Aviation-possible.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>2022 report</u></a> by the Mission Possible Partnership. Beyond that, companies would have to start growing new crops just to make into fuel. </p><p>That creates an opportunity for developers of second-generation SAF technologies, which involve making jet fuel out of captured carbon or alternate biomass sources, such as forest waste. These methods are not yet mature enough to make a significant dent in 2030 targets, such as the EU's mandate to use 6% SAF and the U.S. government’s goal of producing <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/bioenergy/sustainable-aviation-fuel-grand-challenge" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>3 billion gallons of SAF</u></a> per year domestically. But this tech will <em><em>need</em></em> to be a big part of the equation in order to meet the aviation sector’s overall goal of net zero emissions by 2050, as well as the EU’s sustainable fuels mandate, which increases to 20% by 2035 and 70% by 2050 for all flights originating in the bloc.</p><p>“That’s going to be a massive jump because currently, SAF uptake is about 0.2% of fuel,” Nicole Cerulli, a research associate for transportation and logistics at the market research firm Cleantech Group, told me. The head of the <a href="https://www.iata.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>airline industry’s trade association</u></a>, Willie Walsh, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/global-airlines-could-miss-sustainable-fuel-targets-iatas-walsh-says-2024-12-10/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said in December</u></a> at a media day event, "We’re not making as much progress as we’d hoped for, and we’re certainly not making as much progress as we need.” While global SAF production doubled to 1 million metric tons in 2024, that fell far below the trade group’s projection of 1.5 million metric tons, <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/commodity-insights/en/news-research/latest-news/crude-oil/120623-saf-production-to-triple-to-15-mil-mt-in-2024-but-progress-slow-iata" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>made at the end of 2023</u></a>. </p><p>Producing SAF requires making hydrocarbons that mirror those used in traditional jet fuel. We know how to do that, but the processes required — electrolysis, gasification, and the series of chemical reactions known as Fischer-Tropsch synthesis — are energy intensive. So finding a way to power all of this sustainably while simultaneously scaling to meet demand is a challenging and expensive task. </p><p>Aamir Shams, a senior associate at the energy think tank RMI whose work focuses on driving demand for SAF, told me that while sustainable fuel is undeniably more expensive than traditional fuel, airlines and corporations have so far been willing to pay the premium. “We feel that the lag is happening because we just don’t have the fuel today,” Shams said. “Whatever fuel shows up, it just flies off the shelves.”</p><p>Twelve, a Washington-based SAF producer, thinks its e-fuels can help make a dent. The company is looking to produce jet fuel initially by recycling the CO2 emitted from the ethanol, pulp, and paper industries. In September, <a href="https://www.twelve.co/post/twelve-announces-645-million-in-funding-led-by-tpg-to-transform-co2-in-jet-fuel-and-e-chemicals-a-s" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the company raised $645 million</u></a> to complete the buildout of its inaugural SAF facility in Washington state, support the development of future plants, and pursue further R&D. The funding includes $400 million in project equity from the impact fund TPG Rise Climate, $200 million in Series C financing led by TPG, Capricorn Investment Group, and Pulse Fund, and $45 million in loans. The company has also previously <a href="https://www.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/2819999/the-air-force-partners-with-twelve-proves-its-possible-to-make-jet-fuel-out-of/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>partnered with the Air Force</u></a> to explore producing fuel on demand in hard to reach areas. </p><p>Nicholas Flanders, Twelve’s CEO, told me that the company is starting with ethanol, pulp, and paper because the CO2 emissions from these facilities are relatively concentrated and thus cheaper to capture. And unlike, say, coal power plants, these industries aren’t going anywhere fast, making them a steady source of carbon. To turn the captured CO2 into sustainable fuel, the company needs just one more input — water. Renewable-powered electrolyzers then break apart the CO2 and H2O into their constituent parts, and the resulting carbon monoxide and hydrogen are combined to create a syngas. That then gets put through a chemical reaction known as “Fischer-Tropsch synthesis,” where the syngas reacts with catalysts to form hydrocarbons, which are then processed into sustainable jet fuel and ultimately blended with conventional fuel. </p><p>Twelve says its proprietary CO2 electrolyzer can break apart CO2 at much lower temperatures than would typically be required for this molecule, which simplifies the whole process, making it easier to ramp the electrolyzers up and down to match the output of intermittent renewables. (How does it do this? The company didn’t respond when I asked.) Twelve’s first plant, which sources carbon from a nearby ethanol facility, is set to come online next year, producing 50,000 gallons of SAF annually once it’s fully scaled, with electrolyzers that will run on hydropower. </p><p>While Europe may have stricter, actually enforceable SAF requirements than the U.S., Flanders told me there’s a lot of promise in domestic production. “I think the U.S. has an exciting combination of relatively low-cost green electricity, lots of biogenic CO2 sources, a lot of demand for the product we’re making, and then the inflation Reduction Act and state level incentives can further enhance the economics.” Currently, the IRA provides SAF producers with a baseline $1.25 tax credit per gallon produced, which gradually increases the greener the fuel gets. Of course, whether or not the next Congress will rescind this is anybody’s guess. </p><p>Down the line, incentives and mandates will end up mattering a whole lot. Making SAF simply costs a whole lot more than producing jet fuel the standard way, by refining crude oil. But in the meantime, Twelve is setting up cost-sharing partnerships between airlines that want to reduce their direct emissions (scope 1) and large corporations that want to reduce their indirect emissions (scope 3), which include employee business travel. </p><p>For example, Twelve has offtake agreements with Seattle-based Alaska Airlines and Microsoft for the fuel produced at its initial Washington plant. Microsoft, which aims to reduce emissions from its employees’ flights, will essentially cover the cost premium associated with Twelve’s more expensive SAF fuel, making it cost-effective for Alaska to use in its fleet. Twelve has a similar agreement with Boston Consulting Group and an unnamed airline </p><p>Eventually, Flanders told me, the company expects to source carbon via direct air capture, but doing so today would be prohibitively expensive. “If there were a customer who wanted to pay the additional amount to use DAC today, we'd be very happy to do that,” Flanders said. “But our perspective is it will maybe be another decade before that cost starts to converge.”</p><p>No sustainable fuel is even close to cost parity yet — Cerulli told me that it generally comes with a “roughly 250% to over 800%” cost premium over conventional jet fuel. So while voluntary uptake by companies such as Microsoft and BCG are helping drive the emergent market today, that won’t be near enough to decarbonize the industry. “At the simplest level, the cost of not using SAF has to be higher than using it,” Cerulli told me.</p><p>Pathway Energy thinks that by incorporating carbon sequestration into its process, it can help the world get there. The sustainable fuels company, which <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/carbon-negative-fuels-pioneer-pathway-energy-debuts-with-ultra-negative-sustainable-aviation-fuel-and-plans-for-new-saf-facility-on-us-gulf-coast-302329556.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>emerged from stealth</u></a> just last month, is pursuing what CEO Steve Roberts told me is “probably the most cost-efficient long-term pathway from a decarbonization perspective.” The company is building a $2 billion SAF plant in Port Arthur, Texas designed to produce about 30 million gallons of jet fuel annually — enough to power about 5,000 carbon-neutral 10-hour flights — while also permanently sequestering more than 1.9 million tons of CO2. </p><p>Pathway, a subsidiary of the investment and advisory firm Nexus Holdings, has partnered with the UK-based renewable energy company Drax, which will supply the company with 1 million metric tons of wood pellets, to be turned into fuel using a series of well-established technologies. The first step is to gasify the biomass by heating the pellets to high temperatures in the absence of oxygen to produce a syngas. Then, just as Twelve does, it puts the syngas through the Fischer-Tropsch process to form the hydrocarbons that become SAF. </p><p>The competitive advantage here is capturing the emissions from the fuel production process itself and storing them permanently underground. Since Pathway is burying CO2 that’s already been captured by the trees from which the wood pellets come, that would make Pathway’s SAF carbon-negative, in theory, while the best Twelve and similar companies can hope for is carbon neutrality, assuming all of their captured carbon is used to produce fuel. </p><p>The choice of Drax as a feedstock partner is not without controversy, however, as the BBC revealed that the company sources much of its wood from <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-68381160" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>rare old-growth forests</u></a>. Though this is technically legal, it’s also ecologically disruptive. Roberts told me Drax’s sourcing methodologies have been verified by third parties, and Pathway isn’t concerned. “I don't think any of that controversy has yielded any actually significant changes to their sourcing program at all, because we believe that they're compliant,” Roberts told me. “We are 100% certain that they’re meeting all the standards and expectations.”</p><p>Pathway has big growth plans, which depend on the legitimacy of its sustainability cred. Beyond the Port Arthur facility, which Roberts told me will begin production by the end of 2029 or early 2030, the company has a pipeline of additional facilities along the Gulf Coast in the works. It also has global ambitions. “When you have a fuel that is this negative, it really opens up a global market, because you can transport fuel out of Texas, whether that be into the EU, Africa, Asia, wherever it may be,” Roberts said, explaining that even substantial transportation-related emissions would be offset by the carbon-negativity of the fuel.</p><p>But alternative feedstocks such as forestry biomass are finite resources, too. That’s why many experts think that within the SAF sector, e-fuels such as Twelve’s that could one day source carbon via direct air capture and then electrolyze it have the greatest potential for growth. “It’s extremely dependent on getting sustainable CO2 and cheap electricity prices so that you can make cheap green hydrogen,” Shams told me. “But theoretically, it is unlimited in terms of what your total cap on production would be.” </p><p>In the meantime, airlines are focused on making their planes and engines more aerodynamic and efficient so that they don’t consume as much fuel in the first place. They’re also exploring other technical pathways to decarbonization — because after all, SAF will only be a portion of the solution, as many short and medium-length flights could likely be powered by batteries or hydrogen fuel. <a href="https://saf.rmi.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>RMI forecasts</u></a> that by 2050, 45% of global emissions reduction in the aviation sector will come from improvements in fuel efficiency, 37% will be due to SAF deployment, 7% will come from hydrogen, and 3.5% will come from electrification. </p><p>If you did the mental math, you’ll notice these numbers add up to 92.5% — not 100%. “What we have done is, let's look at what we are actually doing today and for the past three, four, five years, and let's see if we get to net zero or not. And the answer is, no. We don't get to net zero by 2050,” Shams told me. And while getting to 92.5% is nothing to scoff at, that means that the aviation sector would still be emitting about 700 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent by that time. </p><p>So what’s to be done? “The financing sector needs to step up its game and take a little bit more of a risk than they are used to,” Shams told me, noting that one of RMI’s partners, the <a href="https://www.missionpossiblepartnership.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Mission Possible Partnership</u></a>, estimates that getting the aviation sector to net zero will require an investment of around $170 billion per year, a total of about $4.5 trillion by 2050. These numbers take a variety of factors into account beyond strictly SAF production, such as airport infrastructure for new fuels, building out direct air capture plants, etc.  </p><p>But any way you cut it, it’s a boatload of money that certainly puts Pathway’s $2 billion SAF facility and Twelve’s $645 million funding round in perspective. And it’s far from certain that we can get there. “Increasingly, that goal of the 2050 net-zero target looks really difficult to achieve,” Shams put it simply. “Commitments are always going up, but more can be done.”</p>

## Congress Is Setting Up for a Public Lands Sell-Off

date: 2025-01-06, from: Heatmap News

But on Friday, in its first action as a voting body, the House of Representatives for the 119th Congress approved <a href="https://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20241230/119PACKAGE3_xml.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a rules package</u></a> that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/01/03/house-gop-rules-change-would-make-it-easier-to-sell-off-federal-land/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reintroduces a provision</u></a> making it easier for lawmakers to cede control of federal lands to local authorities. That, in turn, could result in vast swaths of the West being <a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/culture/opinion/utah-lawsuit-public-land/#:~:text=those%20protections%20would%20vanish" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>opened up to drilling</u></a> or auctioned off to private owners, <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/utah-seven-county-blm" target="_self"><u>according to critics</u></a>.</p>
<p>“It’s an obscure provision that [Congress] is using to essentially obfuscate the paving of the way towards selling off federal public lands,” Michael Carroll, the BLM Campaign Director at the Wilderness Society, told me of the rulemaking maneuver.</p>
<p>Republicans have tried this before. In 2017, during the party’s trifecta, the House approved a rules package with a near-identical provision that essentially declared that public lands do not have a budgetary value that needs to be accounted for when they’re sold, streamlining potential handovers. New Mexico Democratic Representative Raúl Grijalva <a href="https://democrats-naturalresources.house.gov/media/press-releases/grijalva-pushes-back-on-gop-proposal-to-make-it-even-easier-to-give-away-americas-public-lands" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>described the provision at the time</u></a> as allowing Congress to “give away every single piece of property we own, for free, and pretend we have lost nothing of any value.”</p>
<p>Utah Republican Representative Jason Chaffetz subsequently attempted to take advantage of the provision by introducing legislation that would have transferred 3 million acres of Western federal land to state control — a bill that was met by so much opposition from hunters, anglers, and <a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2017/02/12/utahns-drown-out-chaffetz-with-demand-to-explain-yourself-at-tense-town-hall/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>his own furious constituents</u></a> that he ultimately <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/02/02/facing-backlash-utah-rep-jason-chaffetz-withdraws-bill-to-transfer-federal-land-to-the-states/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>withdrew it</u></a>. </p>
<p>The provision briefly disappeared from the rules packages of the 116th and 117th Congresses, when the House was controlled by Democrats, then <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-resolution/5/text" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reappeared again</u></a> in 2023, when Congress was split but the House was in Republican control. But to advocates for public lands, the provision’s inclusion in the 119th Congress’ rules seems like a mere extension and more like a tactical teeing-up for the incoming Republican trifecta. “Utah politicians aren’t stupid. They learn from their mistakes,” Carroll said. </p>
<p>He described an anticipated three-pronged approach to land privatization headed into 2024: the judiciary route, with the Supreme Court poised to decide whether or not to hear a Utah lawsuit over <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/utah-seven-county-blm#:~:text=Utah%20v.%20the%20United%20States" target="_self"><u>the constitutionality of federal control of BLM lands</u></a> later thisweek; the legislative route, which began with Friday’s rule package; and the administrative route, with Trump’s nominee for Secretary of the Interior <a href="https://heatmap.news/tag/doug-burgum" target="_self"><u>Doug Burgum</u></a>, who <a href="https://coloradosun.com/2024/12/16/trump-public-lands-opinion-zornio/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>supports Utah’s lawsuit</u></a>, under a directive to increase drilling. “It’s all backed up by the amount of money that the state of Utah appropriated to support their lawsuit — $20 million that they didn’t have that last time,” Carroll added.</p>
<p>He doesn’t expect Republicans to sit around twiddling their thumbs, either. In 2017, the “Trump administration was pretty new to governing and the levers of power.” He expects in 2024 “we’re going to see, in the next two weeks, legislation that moves to privatize public lands.”</p>
<p>“We need to hear Republicans when they say, ‘Drill, baby drill,’” Carroll went on. “That has real consequences for federal public lands.”</p>

## Bidens to visit New Orleans, relatives of victims of terrorist attack

date: 2025-01-06, from: VOA News USA

Washington — U.S. President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden will visit New Orleans on Monday to grieve with relatives of the 14 people who were killed and 35 injured there when a man drove a rented pickup truck at high speed through a group of pedestrians in the early hours of New Year’s Day.


The Bidens plan to meet with family members of the victims who were run over when the suspect, identified by authorities as Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a 42-year-old military veteran from Houston, sped down bustling Bourbon Street, a prime tourist, restaurant and bar locale. Police fatally shot Jabbar after he opened fire on officers.


“I've been there,” Biden told reporters Sunday ahead of his visit, reflecting on the loss of his own family members through his years in public life. “There's nothing you can really say to somebody that's just had such a tragic loss. My message is going to be personal if I get to get them alone."


Watch related report by Arash Arabasadi:




Biden, with two weeks remaining in office before President-elect Donald Trump is inaugurated, is also meeting with investigators who say that Jabbar acted alone in the attack but was inspired by the Islamic State to carry out the terror attack.


The Federal Bureau of Investigation said that Jabbar posted five videos on social media expressing support for the Islamic State terrorist group, or IS, over roughly an hour and a half before the attack as New Orleans revelers celebrated the first hours of 2025. An IS flag was found in the back of the truck.


An official with the country’s top criminal investigative agency said Sunday that Jabbar, wearing specialized hands-free glasses, last October twice visited the French Quarter neighborhood where the attack occurred.


Lyonel Myrthil, FBI special agent in charge of the New Orleans Field Office, Myrthil said video shows the suspect riding through the French Quarter on a bicycle wearing "meta glasses" that are capable of recording or livestreaming.


Myrthil also said officials are also investigating two foreign trips Jabbar took, one to Cairo in the summer of 2023 and then to Canada a few days later.


"Our agents are getting answers to where he went, who he went with and how those trips may or may not tie into his actions here," Myrthil said.


FBI Deputy Assistant Director Christopher Raia told reporters at a news conference Saturday, "All investigative details and evidence that we have now still support that Jabbar acted alone here in New Orleans. We have not seen any indications of an accomplice in the United States, but we are still looking into potential associates in the U.S. and outside of our borders."




Biden said investigators told him the suspect had a remote detonator in his truck that was meant to set off two explosive devices placed inside ice coolers along Bourbon Street. But police killed Jabbar before he could detonate the explosives.




Representative Mike Turner, chairman of the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, on Sunday reiterated to CBS’s “Face the Nation” show a previously disclosed U.S. claim, that there are Islamic State members and other terrorist organizations that are inside the United States "working in conjunction with ISIS with the intention of harming Americans.”


“We don’t know where they are,” Turner said.


Outgoing Homeland Security chief Alejandro Mayorkas told ABC’s “This Week” show that there has been a “significant increase” over the last 10 years in “homegrown violent extremism.”


“It is a very difficult threat landscape,” Mayorkas said. He pledged a smooth transition to Trump’s appointment as the incoming Homeland Security secretary, South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem.


“I have spoken with Governor Noem a number of times, including on New Year’s Day and immediately thereafter, with respect to the horrific terrorist attack,” Mayorkas said.


“We have spoken substantively about the measures that we take, and I am incredibly devoted to a smooth and successful transition to the success of Governor Noem, should she be confirmed as the secretary of Homeland Security,” Mayorkas said.




Biden’s Monday visit to New Orleans is occurring with heightened security concerns in Washington as Congress meets to certify that Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris in the November election.


It is four years to the day after Trump supporters rampaged through the U.S. Capitol, ransacking congressional offices and attacking law enforcement officers to block certification of Biden’s victory over Trump in the 2020 election. Trump has vowed, within hours of taking office on January 20, to pardon many of those arrested and imprisoned in the January 6, 2021, attack.

## Nippon, US Steel file suit after Biden administration blocks $15 billion deal

date: 2025-01-06, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Japan’s Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel are filing a federal lawsuit challenging the Biden administration's decision to block a proposed nearly $15 billion deal for Nippon to acquire Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel.


The suit, filed Monday in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, alleges that it was a political decision and violated the companies' due process.


Nippon Steel had promised to invest $2.7 billion in U.S. Steel's aging blast furnace operations in Gary, Indiana, and Pennsylvania's Mon Valley. It also vowed not to reduce production capacity in the United States over the next decade without first getting U.S. government approval.




Biden on Friday decided to stop the Nippon takeover — after federal regulators deadlocked on whether to approve it — because "a strong domestically owned and operated steel industry represents an essential national security priority. ... Without domestic steel production and domestic steel workers, our nation is less strong and less secure," he said in a statement.




While administration officials have said the move is unrelated to Japan's relationship with the U.S. — this is the first time a U.S. president has blocked a merger between a U.S. and Japanese firm.


Biden departs the White House in just a few weeks.


The president's decision to block the deal comes after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS, failed to reach consensus on the possible national security risks of the deal last month, and sent a long-awaited report on the merger to Biden. He had 15 days to reach a final decision.

## Biden, in 11th hour action, bans new offshore oil and gas drilling in most federal waters

date: 2025-01-06, from: VOA News USA

Washington — President Joe Biden is moving to ban new offshore oil and gas drilling in most U.S. coastal waters, a last-minute effort to block possible action by the incoming Trump administration to expand offshore drilling.


Biden, whose term expires in two weeks, said he is using authority under the federal Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to protect offshore areas along the East and West coasts, the eastern Gulf of Mexico and portions of Alaska's Northern Bering Sea from future oil and natural gas leasing.


“My decision reflects what coastal communities, businesses and beachgoers have known for a long time: that drilling off these coasts could cause irreversible damage to places we hold dear and is unnecessary to meet our nation’s energy needs," Biden said in a statement.


“As the climate crisis continues to threaten communities across the country and we are transitioning to a clean energy economy, now is the time to protect these coasts for our children and grandchildren," he said.


Biden's orders would not affect large swaths of the Gulf of Mexico, where most U.S. offshore drilling occurs, but it would protect coastlines along California, Florida and other states from future drilling.




Biden's actions, which protect more than 625 million acres of federal waters, could be difficult for President-elect Donald Trump to unwind, since they would likely require an act of Congress to repeal. Trump himself has a complicated history on offshore drilling. He signed a memorandum in 2020 directing the Interior secretary to prohibit drilling in the waters off both Florida coasts, and off the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina until 2032.


The action came after Trump initially moved to vastly expand offshore drilling, before retreating amid widespread opposition in Florida and other coastal states.


Trump has vowed to establish what he calls American “energy dominance” around the world as he seeks to boost U.S. oil and gas drilling and move away from Biden’s focus on climate change.


Environmental advocates hailed Biden's action, saying new oil and gas drilling must be sharply curtailed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming. 2024 was the hottest year in recorded history.


“This is an epic ocean victory!" said Joseph Gordon, campaign director for the environmental group Oceana.


Gordon thanked Biden “for listening to the voices from coastal communities" that oppose drilling and “contributing to the bipartisan tradition of protecting our coasts.”


Biden's actions build on the legacy of Democratic and Republican presidents to protect coastal water from offshore drilling, Gordon said, adding that U.S. coastlines are home to tens of millions of Americans and support billions of dollars of economic activity that depend on a clean environment, abundant wildlife and thriving fisheries.


In balancing multiple uses of America’s oceans, Biden said it was clear that the areas he is withdrawing from fossil fuel use show “relatively minimal potential" that does not justify possible environmental, public health and economic risks that would come from new leasing and drilling.


A spokeswoman for Trump mocked Biden, saying, “Joe Biden clearly wants high gas prices to be his legacy.”


The spokeswoman, Karoline Leavitt, called Biden's action “a disgraceful decision designed to exact political revenge on the American people who gave President Trump a mandate to increase drilling and lower gas prices. Rest assured, Joe Biden will fail, and we will drill, baby, drill.”


Biden has proposed up to three oil and gas lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico, but none in Alaska, as he tries to navigate between energy companies seeking greater oil and gas production and environmental activists who want him to shut down new offshore drilling in the fight against climate change.


A five-year drilling plan approved in 2023 includes proposed offshore sales in 2025, 2027 and 2029. The three lease sales are the minimum number the Democratic administration could legally offer if it wants to continue expanding offshore wind development.


Under the terms of a 2022 climate law, the government must offer at least 60 million acres (24.2 million hectares) of offshore oil and gas leases in any one-year period before it can offer offshore wind leases.


Biden, whose decision to approve the huge Willow oil project in Alaska drew strong condemnation from environmental groups, has previously limited offshore drilling in other areas of Alaska and the Arctic Ocean.

The 625 million acres included in the protections will cover the entire East Coast, the eastern Gulf of Mexico, the Pacific off the coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California, as well as parts of the Northern Bering Sea in Alaska. As <em><em>Politico</em></em> <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/04/biden-block-offshore-drilling-00196484?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--j1smYbUIoI8Yfs-FXbXC3_ZOmihzP2geMYbVsctNcHyayC7vjP0tZtdGPQmwShI-S8m9s" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">noted</a>, most of those areas are of little interest to the oil and gas industry, but “the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico is believed to hold large untapped reservoirs of oil.” It will be difficult for the incoming Trump administration to dismantle Biden’s ban, but the fossil fuel industry is likely to challenge it. With this decision, Biden will have conserved more lands and waters than any other U.S. president, the White House added. “President Biden has been a steadfast champion for climate progress from Day One of his administration,” Margie Alt, director of the Climate Action Campaign, said in a statement. “His legacy of conservation and advocacy to protect our climate will leave an indelible mark on the health of our communities and our environment.”</p><h3>3.

## Winter blast of snow, ice and bitter cold grips US from Midwest to East Coast

date: 2025-01-06, from: VOA News USA

A major winter blast of snow, ice, wind and plunging temperatures in the U.S. stirred dangerous travel conditions from central and southern states all the way to the East Coast early Monday, prompting schools and government offices in several states to close.


Snow and ice blanketed major roads across Kansas, western Nebraska and parts of Indiana, where the state’s National Guard was activated to help stranded motorists. At least 20 centimeters of snow was expected, along with gusting winds up to 72 kph.




The National Weather Service issued winter storm warnings from Kansas and Missouri all the way to New Jersey.


“For locations in this region that receive the highest snow totals, it may be the heaviest snowfall in at least a decade,” the weather service said.


Gary Wright wore a parka as he and his husband chipped away at thick ice coating his SUV in a slippery apartment parking lot in Missouri. Wright said he will work remotely Monday, but wanted to scrape off his vehicle as an excuse to spend a little time in the snow. He also is seeking boots for their two older dogs that “won’t budge at all” when their paws hit the cold ground.


The polar vortex of ultra-cold air usually spins around the North Pole. People in the U.S., Europe and Asia experience its intense cold when the vortex escapes and plunges southward.




Studies show a fast-warming Arctic is partly to blame for the increasing frequency of the polar vortex extending its icy grip.


Classes canceled 


School closings are expected to be widespread Monday. Districts in Indiana, Virginia and Kentucky began announcing cancellations and delays on Sunday afternoon. Kentucky’s Jefferson County Public Schools canceled classes, extracurricular activities and athletics for its nearly 100,000 students.


Classes also have been cancelled in Maryland, where Gov. Wes Moore declared a state of emergency Sunday and announced the state government would be closed Monday.


“Keeping Marylanders safe is our top priority. Please stay off the roads during this storm. Prepare your home and family and charge your communications devices in case you lose power,” Moore said in a statement.

## Global Populists Have a New Take on Climate Policy

date: 2025-01-06, from: Heatmap News

Right-wing populists focus their appeals on a supposed conflict between ordinary people and what they claim is a corrupt elite; the philosophy is also usually characterized by nativism and a suspicion of international cooperation and integration. All of that comfortably translates into antagonism toward climate action. So if right-wing populists are on the march globally, what are the risks for global climate policy?</p><p>The picture is complex — not every populist party puts environmental issues near the center of its agenda. The Alternative for Germany party (also known as AfD) recently gained a high-profile supporter when Elon Musk <a href="https://apnews.com/article/germany-election-musk-far-right-afd-welt-915cc6821cd48c3168a7895b1d1c1a35" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>wrote an op-ed</u></a> calling it “the last spark of hope” for Germany, citing “cultural integrity” as one of the reasons he supports it. But it was already gaining, even if most Germans find it repellent: In September, it <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/02/europe/afd-germany-election-thuringia-saxony-intl/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>became</u></a> the first far-right party to win a state election since World War II. </p><p>The AfD’s platform (which it has helpfully <a href="https://www.afd.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/2017-04-12_afd-grundsatzprogramm-englisch_web.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>translated into English</u></a>) is as full-on denialist as you can find from any major political party; it rejects the idea of anthropogenic climate change and demands an end to German efforts to reduce emissions. “We want to end the perception of CO2 as an exclusively harmful substance and set a stop to Germany’s maverick policy in the reduction of CO2 emissions,” it says.</p><p>Meanwhile in the Netherlands, Geert Wilders’ PVV is now the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd1r0xvn0z5o" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>largest party</u></a> in the governing coalition (though after six months of negotiations following the PVV’s showing in the last election, Wilders <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2qvqwq0gxlo" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>agreed</u></a> to let another coalition partner become prime minister). Its platform <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/why-the-dutch-election-result-spells-trouble-for-europes-climate-efforts/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>promised</u></a> that the Dutch “Climate Act, the [Paris] climate accord and all other climate measures go straight into the shredder.” Austria’s far-right FPO party <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/austria-election-results-far-right-fpo-wins-rcna173160" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>placed first</u></a> in elections in September; it opposes most efforts to combat climate change. (Austria’s Chancellor Karl Nehammer, from the center-right OVP or “People’s Party,” <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/austrian-coalition-talks-collapse-chancellor-step-down-2025-01-04/" target="_blank">resigned Saturday</a> after coalition talks with FPO broke down.)</p><p>In last summer’s parliamentary elections in France, the far-right National Rally pledged a rollback of environmental laws, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/far-right-france-risks-paralyzing-eu-green-deal/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>including</u></a> “slashing the value-added tax on gas, power and fuel from 20 percent to 5.5 percent; freezing all new wind projects; and easing energy efficiency requirements for homeowners looking to sell their properties,” according to <em><em>Politico</em></em>. The party <a href="https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/france-election-runoff-results-07-07-24-intl/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>failed</u></a> to win a plurality in the second round of voting, but it displayed a strength that <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/environment/article/2024/06/15/french-environmentalists-alarmed-by-the-potential-rise-of-far-right-to-power_6674876_114.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>alarmed</u></a> many environmentalists. And after last year’s European Parliament elections, far-right parties <a href="https://apnews.com/article/european-parliament-election-far-right-b9339cf1a7d2067bf6fa1941c166936d#" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>now control</u></a> a quarter of the seats in the body, more than ever before.</p><p>For these parties, the single most important issue is immigration; their appeal is driven by backlash to influxes of newcomers from Syria and northern African countries, which has contributed to a changing demographic picture. But while environmental policies may be secondary, the issues are hardly unrelated. Versions of “Great Replacement” theory are visible everywhere, the idea that liberal elites are importing non-white immigrants to displace native-born whites and transform the nation. In this telling, green policy is one more way the conspiracy of cultural elites tries to control the lives of the nation’s truest citizens. </p><p>Far-right parties often get their strongest support in rural areas, <a href="https://washingtonmonthly.com/2024/02/28/how-to-end-republican-exploitation-of-rural-america/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>just as Republicans do</u></a> in the U.S., where farmers <a href="https://apnews.com/article/french-farmers-protests-paris-tractors-67c34b632b6a868e2c1b6cebe02b3cbd" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>protest</u></a> environmental policies imposed from urban capitals and which they see as the brainchildren of cosmopolitan elites who are either indifferent or actively hostile to their needs. Last spring, farmers <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/03/europe/europe-farmers-protests-explainer-intl/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>staged</u></a> dramatic protests in France, Germany, Belgium, and other countries, protesting environmental policies they said made it difficult for them to earn a living. </p><p>In that way, opposition to climate action <a href="https://journals.plos.org/climate/article?id=10.1371/journal.pclm.0000443" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>fits</u></a> neatly within the rest of the right-wing populist philosophy and agenda, which usually reject international accords like the Paris Agreement and even the existence of the European Union itself. Repealing climate laws can be a way of striking back at experts and cosmopolitan urbanites, whether it’s Trump rolling back EV subsidies or European rightists attacking the EU’s <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Green Deal</u></a>, which among other things <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/28/europe/eu-climate-change-law-net-zero-intl/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>obligates</u></a> the continent to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.</p><p>The far-right populist parties aren’t the only ones pushing back certain kinds of climate action; center-right parties are also playing a part, even if historically they have been far more progressive on climate than the GOP. Consider the European Union’s law requiring that no internal-combustion cars be produced after 2035, which <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/how-the-eu-ditched-the-combustion-engine-zero-emissions-green-deal/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>passed</u></a> in 2022. That law is now under attack from the center-right, especially the European People’s Party, the largest bloc in the European Parliament. The EPP (which includes EU president Ursula von der Leyen among its members) is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eus-largest-political-group-pushes-weaken-combustion-engine-ban-2024-12-10/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>seeking</u></a> to have the ban repealed, or at least modified to allow for continued production of plug-in hybrids and ICE cars that run on biofuels.</p><p>Nevertheless, far-right parties that want to maximize their power to the point where they can lead governing coalitions have an incentive to moderate their rhetoric on climate. One can see that dynamic in Italian prime minister Georgia Meloni, whose rhetoric on the international stage sounds much more progressive than her party does <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/bgiorgia-meloni-italy-heat-summer-wildfires-climate-change-climate-denial/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>at home</u></a>, where it still traffics in climate denial. She has even <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/italy-giorgia-meloni-climate-change-right-wing/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>presented</u></a> climate as a right-wing issue, saying “The right loves the environment because it loves the land, the identity, the homeland.” <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-right-wing-show-donald-trump-climate-maga-style-cop29-azerbaijan-giorgia-meloni-viktor-orban-nuclear-power/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>This version</u></a> of environmentalism seeks to combat climate change in order to minimize the numbers of future climate migrants from the Global South, many of whom will wind up seeking refuge in Europe. </p><p>However you feel about that motivation, it points to a vicious cycle that could emerge in the future: As global temperatures increase and natural disasters become more frequent, more places become uninhabitable and millions of people become climate refugees. They head north into developed countries, where their presence spurs a right-wing backlash that puts far-right populist parties into power. Those parties then reverse progressive climate policies, making it more difficult to reduce emissions and continuing the cycle. </p><p>That might not be our future, and the changes to climate policy advocated by the resurgent populist parties haven’t yet been implemented. It’s also possible that the far right’s political moment could be fleeting. But the next few years will offer plenty of reasons to worry.</p><p><em>Editor’s note: This story has been updated to reflect political developments in Austria.</em><br/></p>

## Jimmy Carter raised climate change concerns 35 years before the Paris Accords

date: 2025-01-06, from: VOA News USA

PLAINS, GEORGIA — When Jimmy Carter chose branding designs for his presidential campaign, he passed on the usual red, white and blue. He wanted green.


Emphasizing how much the Georgia Democrat enjoyed nature and prioritized environmental policy, the color became ubiquitous. On buttons, bumper stickers, brochures, the sign rechristening the old Plains train depot as his campaign headquarters. Even the hometown Election Night party.


“The minute it was announced, we all had the shirts to put on — and they were green, too,” said LeAnne Smith, Carter’s niece, recalling the 1976 victory celebration.


Nearly a half-century later, environmental advocates are remembering Carter, who died on Dec. 29 at the age of 100, as a president who elevated environmental stewardship, energy conservation and discussions about the global threat of rising carbon dioxide levels.


President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to abandon the renewable energy investments that President Joe Biden included in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, echoing how President Ronald Reagan dismantled the solar panels Carter installed on the White House roof. But politics aside, the scientific consensus has settled where Carter stood two generations earlier.


“President Carter was four decades ahead of his time,” said Manish Bapna, who leads the Natural Resources Defense Council. Carter called for cuts in greenhouse gas emissions well before “climate change” was part of the American lexicon, he said.


Wearing cardigans and setting standards

Former Vice President Al Gore, whose climate advocacy earned him the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize, called Carter “a lifelong role model for the entire environmental movement.”


As president, Carter implemented the first U.S. efficiency standards for passenger vehicles and household appliances. He created the U.S. Department of Energy, which streamlined energy research, and more than doubled the wilderness area under National Park Service protection.


Inviting ridicule, Carter asked Americans to conserve energy through personal sacrifice, including driving less and turning down thermostats in winter amid global fuel shortages. He pushed renewable energy to lessen dependence on fossil fuels, calling for 20% of U.S. energy to come from alternative sources by 2000.


But laments linger about what 39th president could not get done or did not try before his landslide defeat to Ronald Reagan.


Addressing climate change

Carter left office in 1981 shortly after receiving a West Wing report linking fossil fuels to rising carbon dioxide levels in Earth’s atmosphere. Carter’s top environmental advisers urged “immediate” cutbacks on the burning of fossil fuels to reduce what scientists at the time called “carbon dioxide pollution.”


“Nobody anywhere in the world in a high government position was talking about this problem” before Carter, biographer Jonathan Alter said.


The White House released the findings, which drew forgettable news coverage: The New York Times published its story on the 13th page of its front section. And with scant time left in office, there were no tangible moves Carter could make, beyond the energy legislation he had already signed.


The report recommended limiting global average temperatures to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels. Thirty-five years later, in the 2015 Paris climate accords, participating nations set a similar goal.


“If he had been reelected, it’s fair to say that we would have been beginning to address climate change in the early 1980s,” Alter told the AP. “When you think about that, it adds a kind of a tragic dimension, almost, to his political defeat.”


Reagan ended high-level conversations about carbon emissions. He opposed efficiency standards as government overreach and rolled back some regulations. His chief of staff, Don Regan, called the solar panels “a joke.”


Pursuing energy independence

Despite Carter’s emphasis on renewable sources, the fossil fuel industry benefited from his push toward U.S. energy independence.


Collin O’Mara, CEO of the National Wildlife Foundation, pointed to coal-fired power plants built during and shortly thereafter Carter’s term, and his deregulation of natural gas production, a move O'Mara called “a precursor” to widespread fracking. Bapna noted Carter backed drilling off the coasts of Long Island in New York and New England.


Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, pointed to Carter’s Synthetic Fuels Corporation, a short-lived effort to produce fossil fuel alternatives that “would have meant much higher carbon emissions.”


But Carter had the right priorities, especially on research and development coordinated through the Energy Department, Nadel said. “He allowed us to have a national approach rather than one agency here and another there."


Stewarding God's creation

Carter’s environmental interests had deep roots going back to a a rural boyhood filled with hunting and fishing and working his father’s farmland.


“Jimmy Carter was an environmentalist before it was a real part of the political discussion — and I’m not talking about solar panels on the White House,” said Dubose Porter, a longtime Georgia Democratic Party leader. “Just focusing on that, misses how early and how committed he was.”


His early years as a youth, influenced Carter as governor, Porter said, when he boosted Georgia's state parks system and opposed Georgia congressmen who wanted to dam a river. Carter paddled the waterway himself and decided its natural state trumped the lucrative federal construction proposal.


In Washington, Carter continued sometimes unwinnable fights against funding for projects he deemed damaging and unnecessary. He found more success extending federal protection for more than 60.7 million hectares, including redwood forests in California and vast swaths of Alaska.


Randall Balmer, a Dartmouth College professor who has written on Carter's faith, said he saw himself as a custodian of divinely granted natural resources.


“That’s a real connection that young evangelicals still have with him today,” Balmer said.


Condemning consumerism

Carter won the presidency amid energy shortages rooted in global strife, especially in the oil-rich Middle East, so national security and economic interests dovetailed with Carter’s religious beliefs and affinity for nature, Nadel noted.


Carter compared the energy crisis to “the moral equivalent of war,” and as inflation and gas lines grew, he called for individual sacrifice and sweeping action on renewable energy.


“Human identity is no longer defined by what one does, but by what one owns,” Carter warned in 1979. “But we’ve discovered that owning things and consuming things does not satisfy our longing for meaning.”


That “malaise” speech — dubbed so by the media despite Carter not using the word — was unique in presidential politics for its condemnation of unchecked American consumerism. Carter celebrated that more than 100 million Americans watched. By 2010, Carter acknowledged in his annotated “White House Diary” that his speech was a flop, but said it proved to be prescient for advocating bold and direct action on energy.


“You can say the Carter presidency is still producing results today,” said Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, whose 2020 presidential run focused on climate action. “I’ve learned in politics that timing is everything and serendipity is everything.”

## Afghans arrive in the Philippines to complete visa processing for resettlement in US

date: 2025-01-06, from: VOA News USA

MANILA, Philippines — A group of Afghan nationals arrived in the Philippines on Monday to process special immigrant visas for their resettlement in the United States, as part of an agreement between Manila and Washington.


The Philippines agreed last July to temporarily host a U.S. immigrant visa processing center for a limited number of Afghan nationals aspiring to resettle in America.


Department of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Teresita Daza said the Afghan nationals who landed in the Philippines on Monday were provided entry visas. She said they had completed extensive security vetting and undergone full medical screenings prior to their arrival.


The U.S. government will cover the costs for the Afghan nationals' stay in the Philippines, including their food, housing, security, medical and transportation expenses, she said.


She didn't specify how many Afghans arrived or how long the visa processing will take. Under the Philippines' rules, visa applicants can stay for no longer than 59 days.


A senior Philippine official told The Associated Press last year that only 150 to 300 applicants would be accommodated in the Philippines under the "one-time" deal. The official who had knowledge of the negotiations agreed to speak on condition of anonymity because of a lack of authority to speak publicly.


The Afghan nationals seeking resettlement primarily worked for the U.S. government in Afghanistan or were deemed eligible for U.S. special immigrant visas but were left behind when Washington withdrew from the country and Taliban militants took back power in a chaotic period in 2021.


U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken first relayed the request to his Philippines counterpart in 2022, and President Joe Biden discussed the request with Philippines leader Ferdinand Marcos Jr. when he visited the U.S. last year, Philippine officials said.


Marcos has rekindled relations with the U.S. since winning the presidency by a landslide margin two years ago. In February last year, he allowed an expansion of the American military presence under a 2014 defense agreement in a decision that upset China.

## US Congress to certify Trump’s election win

date: 2025-01-06, from: VOA News USA

The U.S. Congress is set to meet Monday to certify Donald Trump’s presidential election victory over Vice President Kamala Harris.


The vice president is in charge of presiding over the count of results from each of the country’s 50 states, putting Harris in the position of certifying her own loss.


The procedure was long a formality in the election process, but four years ago turned to chaos as Trump supporters stormed the Capitol, injuring about 140 police officers, vandalizing the building and sending lawmakers rushing for safety.


Similar scenes are not expected Monday, with Harris having conceded defeat and President Joe Biden highlighting the need for a peaceful process.


Authorities have prepared just in case, erecting tall metal barriers around the Capitol complex.


Speaking Sunday at the White House, Biden called what happened on Jan. 6, 2021 “one of the toughest days in American history.”


“We’ve got to get back to the basic, normal transfer of power,” Biden said. 


He added that Trump’s conduct four years ago, which included repeated false claims that he won the election, "was a genuine threat to democracy.”


“I’m hopeful we’re beyond that now,” Biden said.


More than 1,500 people have been charged in connection with storming the Capitol.  Trump has pledged to quickly issue pardons after he takes office on Jan. 20.

## 'The Brutalist,' 'Emilia Perez' triumph at Golden Globes

date: 2025-01-06, from: VOA News USA

Two wildly audacious films — Brady Corbet's 215-minute postwar epic “The Brutalist” and Jacques Audiard's Spanish language, genre-shifting trans musical “Emilia Perez” — won top honors at the 82nd Golden Globes on Sunday.


The Globes, which are still finding their footing after years of scandal and makeover, scattered awards around to a number of films. But the awards group put its strongest support behind a pair of movies that sought to be unlike anything else.


“The Brutalist” was crowned best film, drama, putting one of 2024’s most ambitious films on course to be a major contender at the Academy Awards. The film, shot in VistaVision and released with an intermission, also won best director for Corbet and best actor for Adrien Brody.


"I was told that this film was un-distributable," said Corbet. “No one was asking for a three-and-half-hour film about a mid-century designer in 70mm. But it works.”




“Emilia Perez” won best film, comedy or musical, elevating the Oscar chances of Netflix’s top Oscar contender. It also won best supporting actress for Zoe Saldaña, best song (“El Mal”) and best non-English language film. Karla Sofia Gascon, the film's transgender star who plays a Mexican drug lord who undergoes gender-affirming surgery, spoke for the film.


“The light always wins over darkness," said Gascon, gesturing to her brightly orange dress. “You can maybe put us in jail. You can beat us up. But you never can take away our soul or existence or identity.”


“I am who I am. Not who you want.”




The night's big actor winners included some surprises. One shocker was Moore's win for best actress in a comedy or musical. Her comeback performance in “The Substance," about a Hollywood star who resorts to an experimental process to regain her youth, landed the 62-year-old Moore her first Globe — a victory that came over the heavily favored Mikey Madison of “Anora.”


"I’m just in shock right now. I’ve been doing this a long time, like over 45 years, and this is the first thing I’ve ever won as an actor," said Moore, who was last nominated by the Globes for a film role in 1991 for “Ghost.” “Thirty years ago, I had a producer tell me that I was a popcorn actress.”


Best actress, in a drama film, was a surprise, too. The Brazilian actress Fernanda Torres won for her performance in “I’m Still Here,” a based-on-a-true-story drama about a family living through the disappearance of political dissident Rubens Paiva in 1970s Rio de Janeiro.


Best supporting actor in a musical or comedy went to Sebastian Stan for another movie about physical transformation: “A Different Man,” in which Stan plays a man with a deformed face who's healed. Stan, who was also nominated for playing Donald Trump in “The Apprentice," noted that both films were hard to get made.


“These are tough subject matters but these films are real and they're necessary,” said Stan. “But we can't be afraid and look away.”


Glaser lightly roasts the Globes

Comedian Nikki Glaser kicked off the Globes, with a promise: “I'm not here to roast you.”


But Glaser, a stand-up whose breakthrough came in a withering roast of Tom Brady, made her way around the ballroom of the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California, on Sunday picking out plenty of targets in an opening monologue she had worked out extensively in comedy clubs beforehand.


While Glaser might not have reached Tina Fey and Amy Poehler levels of laughs, the monologue was mostly a winner, and a dramatic improvement over last year’s host, Jo Koy. Last year's Globes, following a diversity and ethics scandal that led to the dissolution of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, were widely panned, but delivered where it counted. Ratings rebounded to about 10 million viewers, according to Nielsen. CBS, who waded in after NBC dumped the Globes, signed up for five more years.


Hosting the Globes two weeks before the inauguration of Donald Trump, Glaser reserved perhaps her most cutting line for the whole room of Hollywood stars.


“You could really do anything ... except tell the country who to vote for,” said Glaser. “But it’s OK, you’ll get ’em next time ... if there is one. I’m scared.”


The Globes are now owned by Todd Boehly’s Eldridge Industries and Dick Clark Productions, which acquired the award show from the now defunct Hollywood Foreign Press Association. After diversity and ethics scandals, the HFPA sold off the Globes and dissolved. However, more than a dozen former HFPA members are seeking to have the sale to Eldridge Industries and Dick Clark Productions rescinded.


A win for ‘Wicked’

The Globes' award for cinematic and box-office achievement went to Jon M. Chu's “Wicked,” which has nearly collected $700 million in theaters. In a heavily arthouse Oscar field, “Wicked” is easily the biggest hit seen as having a chance to win best picture. Accepting the award, Chu argued for “a radical act of optimism” in art.


Though few film awards have been predictable this season, Kieran Culkin is emerging as the clear favorite for best supporting actor. Culkin won Sunday for his performance in Jesse Eisenberg’s “A Real Pain,” his second Globe in the past year following a win for the HBO series “Succession.” He called the Globes “basically the best date night that my wife and I ever have,” and then thanked her for “putting up what you call my mania.”


The papal thriller “Conclave” took best screenplay, for Peter Straughan's script. “Flow,” the wordless Latvian animated parable about a cat in a flooded world, took best animated film, winning over studio blockbusters like “Inside Out 2” and “The Wild Robot.” Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross won best score for their thumping music for “Challengers.”


TV prizes

Most of the TV winners were oft-awarded series, including the Emmy champ “Shogun." It won four awards, including best drama series and acting wins for Hiroyuki Sanada, Anna Sawai and Tadanobu Asano. Other repeat winners were: "Hacks" (best comedy series, actress for Jean Smart), “The Bear” (Jeremy Allen White for best actor) and “Baby Reindeer” (best limited series).


Ali Wong won for best stand-up performance, Jodie Foster for “True Detective” and Colin Farrell for his physical transformation in “The Penguin.”


“I guess it's prosthetics from here on out," said Farrell.

## Sunday school class with Jimmy Carter: What it was like

date: 2025-01-06, from: VOA News USA

Plains, Georgia — It never got old. 


No matter how many times one crammed into the modest sanctuary at Maranatha Baptist Church, there was always some wisdom to be gleaned from the measured, Bible-inspired words of Jimmy Carter. 


This was another side of the 39th president, a down-to-earth man of steadfast faith who somehow found time to teach Sunday school classes when he wasn't building homes for the needy, or advocating for fair elections, or helping eradicate awful diseases. 


For young and old, straight and gay, believers and nonbelievers, Black and white and brown, Maranatha was a far-off-the-beaten path destination in southwest Georgia where Carter, well into his 90s, stayed connected with his fellow citizens of the world. 


Anyone willing to make the trek to his hometown of Plains, with its one blinking caution light and residents numbering in the hundreds, was rewarded with access to a white-haired man who once occupied the highest office in the land. 


Carter taught his Sunday school class roughly twice a month to accommodate crowds that sometimes swelled to more than 500. (On the other Sundays, no more than a couple dozen regulars and a handful of visitors usually attended services). 


Here, the former commander-in-chief and the onetime first lady, his wife of more than seven decades, were simply Mr. Jimmy and Ms. Rosalynn. And when it came to worshipping with them, all were welcome. 


Sundays with Mr. Jimmy 


Before the former president entered the sanctuary, with a bomb-sniffing dog outside and Secret Service agents scattered around, a strict set of rules would be laid out by Ms. Jan — Jan Williams, a longtime church member and friend of the Carters. She would have made quite a drill sergeant. 


It felt like a good-cop, bad-cop routine. Ms. Jan barking out rules you knew had come straight from Mr. Jimmy, who studied nuclear physics and approached all things with an engineer's orderly mind. 


Most important for those wanting a photo with the Carters — and nearly everyone did — you had to stay for the main 11 a.m. church service. Picture-taking began around noon. 


If you left the church grounds before that, there was no coming back. If you stayed, you followed rules. No autographs. No handshakes. No attempts at conversation beyond a brief "good morning" or "thank you." 


Carter, consistently in sports jacket, slacks and bolo tie, would start his lesson by moving around the sanctuary, asking with a straight face if there were any visitors — that always got a laugh — and where they were from. In my many trips to Maranatha, I'm sure I heard all 50 states, not to mention an array of far-flung countries. 


If anyone answered Washington, D.C., the answer was predictable. "I used to live there," the one-term president would say, breaking into that toothy grin. 


Carter's Bible lessons focused on central themes: God gives life, loves unconditionally and provides the freedom to live a completely successful life. But the lesson usually began with an anecdote about what he'd been up to or his perspective on world affairs. 


Carter could talk about building homes with Habitat for Humanity or bemoan U.S. conflicts since World War II. He could talk about his work with The Elders, a group of former world leaders, or a trip out West to go trout fishing with Ted Turner. He could talk about The Carter Center's successes in eliminating the guinea worm, or his long friendships with Willie Nelson and Bob Dylan. 


"Willie Nelson is an old friend. He used to come visit me in the White House," Carter related once, touching ever so gently on Nelson's affection for weed. 


"I don't know what Willie and my children did after I went to bed. I've heard rumors," the former president said, with a sly grin and a wink that suggested he believed every word. 


My favorite: Carter telling of his latest book project and how he had long used encyclopedias for research. 


Carter decided the collection was taking up too much space, so he boxed it up and headed out to local schools and libraries, figuring someone would eagerly take a donation from an ex-president. Instead, he got a standard refrain: Sorry, no one uses encyclopedias anymore. 


I recall the punchline. "How do I look up things now?" asked the man born five years after World War I ended. Pause. Then: "Google." 


Memories of visits 


During most of my visits to Maranatha, Carter spoke for 45 minutes without sitting down. His mind remained sharp, with only an occasional glance at the notes tucked inside his Bible, but his body became more and more feeble as he moved deeper into his 90s. He talked openly about the ravages of aging. 


He resisted church members' pleadings to take a seat while teaching. I was there the first time he tried it, in August 2018. 


"I'm uncomfortable sitting down," he said, "but I guess I'll get used to it." 


Not that time. Carter sat for less than 10 minutes before rising. He stood at the table for the rest of class. 


Returning the following year, Carter had relented to using a white, remote-controlled chair. After climbing aboard — voilà — a flick of a switch would slowly lift him above the lectern, visible even to those sitting in the back. 


If there wasn't enough room in the sanctuary, rows of folding chairs were set up in the fellowship hall and a handful of tiny classrooms. Carter's lesson would be shown on TVs linked to a feed from the main room. 


A letdown for visitors? Perhaps. But relegation to a back room had its benefits. 


Carter, who usually arrived about 15 minutes before the start of his 10 a.m. lesson, would swing by these rooms before heading to the sanctuary. He would even take a few questions, which didn't happen in front of the big crowd. 


After a 2018 profile by The Washington Post told of the Carters having regular Saturday night dinners at friend Jill Stuckey's house, which included one glass each of "bargain-brand Chardonnay," I asked Carter how many glasses of wine he'd had the night before. 


"I'll say one," Carter replied with a sly grin. Stuckey, standing behind him, shook her head and held up two fingers. 


No matter where you sat — main sanctuary or back room — everyone got their picture taken with Mr. Jimmy and Ms. Rosalynn. For many, this seemed the biggest reward. 


When we first started attending, those pictures were taken under a tree just outside the church. After being diagnosed with cancer in 2015, Carter and his wife would pose with visitors inside the sanctuary. Carter liked to joke about what a burden it was to sit for all those pictures, which surely numbered in the hundreds of thousands. 


"I'll be delighted to have photographs made with all of you," he quipped after one of his final lessons. "Actually, since I'm in church, I better say I'll be willing to have photographs made with all of you." 


For my family, those pictures show a son growing from boy to man with Mr. Jimmy and Ms. Rosalynn filling out the frames. What a treasure they are. 


The final lesson 


Turnout for Carter's Sunday school lessons dipped during the Great Recession. But the crowds returned after his cancer announcement, with some folks lining up outside the church the night before. 


Carter declared himself cancer-free, but other health challenges began to catch up with him. After an October 2019 fall at his home left him with a slightly fractured pelvis, the church announced Carter would not teach his next class on Nov. 3, a lesson we had planned to attend. Disappointed, we canceled our hotel reservation. 


But Mr. Jimmy wasn't done just yet. 


The church had canceled without checking with him. He made it clear that he was NOT cancelling. We quickly rebooked. Carter's lesson that day, based on the Book of Job, was especially poignant in retrospect. 


"I'm going to start by asking you a very profound question," he said. "How many of you believe in life after death?" 


Carter conceded to having doubts for most of his life, right up to being stricken by cancer, which finally erased any skepticism. When the end on this world came, he would be ready. 


"We don't have anything to dread after death," Carter said with a reassuring smile. 


At the end of his lesson, he challenged everyone to do one good deed for a stranger. "I'm going to hold you to it," Carter promised. 


He never got the chance. 


His health continued to decline, sidelining him through the Christmas season. Then, the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the world in 2020. 


By that summer, it was clear that Mr. Jimmy's treasured role as spreader of the gospel, which he began at 18 and resumed after his presidency, was over.

## TikTok creators in US left in limbo while awaiting decision on potential platform ban

date: 2025-01-06, from: VOA News USA

Will TikTok in the U.S. be banned this month?


That's the pressing question keeping creators and small business owners in anxious limbo as they await a decision that could upend their livelihoods. The fate of the popular app will be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court, which will hear arguments on Jan. 10 over a law requiring TikTok to break ties with its Chinese-based parent company, ByteDance, or face a U.S. ban.


At the heart of the case is whether the law violates the First Amendment with TikTok and its creator allies arguing that it does. The U.S. government, which sees the platform as a national security risk, says it does not.


For creators, the TikTok doomsday scenarios are nothing new since President-elect Donald Trump first tried to ban the platform through executive order during his first term. But despite Trump's recent statements indicating he now wants TikTok to stick around, the prospect of a ban has never been as immediate as it is now with the Supreme Court serving as the final arbiter.


If the government prevails as it did in a lower court, TikTok says it would shut down its U.S. platform by Jan. 19, leaving creators scrambling to redefine their futures.


"A lot of my other creative friends, we're all like freaking out. But I'm staying calm," said Gillian Johnson, who benefited financially from TikTok's live feature and rewards program, which helped creators generate higher revenue potential by posting high-quality original content. The 22-year-old filmmaker and recent college graduate uses her TikTok earnings to help fund her equipment for projects such as camera lens and editing software for her short films "Gambit" and "Awaken! My Neighbor."


Johnson said the idea of TikTok going away is "hard to accept."


Many creators have taken to TikTok to voice their frustrations, grappling with the possibility that the platform they've invested so much in could soon disappear. Online communities risk being disrupted, and the economic fallout could especially be devastating for those who mainly depend on TikTok and have left full-time jobs to build careers and incomes around their content.


For some, the uncertainty has led them to question whether to continue creating content at all, according to Johnson, who says she knows creators who have been thinking about quitting. But Nicla Bartoli, the vice president of sales at The Influencer Marketing Factory, said the creators she has interreacted with have not been too worried since news about a potential TikTok ban has come up repeatedly over the years, and then died down.


"I believe a good chunk think it is not going to happen," said Bartoli, whose agency works to pair influencers and brands.


It's unclear how quickly the Supreme Court will issue a decision. But the court could act swiftly to block the law from going into effect if at least five of the nine justices deem it unconstitutional.


Trump, for his part, has already asked the justices to put a pause on the ban so he could weigh in after he takes office. In a brief — written by his pick for solicitor general — Trump called the First Amendment implications of a TikTok ban "sweeping and troubling" and said he wants a "negotiated resolution" to the issue, something the Biden administration had pursued to no avail.


While waiting for the dust to settle in Washington, some creators are exploring alternatives ways to promote themselves or their business, encouraging users to follow them on other social media platforms or are investing more time producing non-TikTok content.


Johnson says she is already strategizing her next move and exploring alternative opportunities. While she hasn't found a place quite like TikTok, she's begun to spend more of her time on other platforms, such as Instagram and YouTube, both of whom are expected to benefit financially if TikTok vanishes.


According to a report by Goldman Sachs, the so-called creator economy, which has been fueled in part by TikTok, could be worth $480 billion by 2027.


Because the opportunity to monetize content exists across a range of platforms, a vast amount of creators have already diversified their social media presence. However, many TikTok creators have credited the platform — and its algorithm — with giving them a type of exposure they did not receive on other platforms. Some say it has also boosted and provided opportunities for creators of color and those from other marginalized groups.


Despite fears about the fate of TikTok, industry analysts note creators are generally avoiding making any big changes, like abandoning platform, until something actually happens.


"I'm anxious but also trying to be hopeful in a weird way," said Brandon Hurst, who credits TikTok with rescuing his business from obscurity and propelling it into rapid growth.


A year after joining TikTok, the 30-year-old Hurst, who sells plants, said his sales doubled, outpacing the traction he'd struggled to gain on Instagram. He built his clientele through the live feature on TikTok, which has helped him sell more than 77,000 plants. The business has thrived so much that he says he now employs five people, including his husband and mom.


"For me, this has been my sole way of doing business," Hurst said.


Billion Dollar Boy, a New York-based influencer marketing agency, has advised creators to download all of their TikTok content into a personal portfolio, which is especially important for those who post primarily on the platform, said Edward East, the agency's founder and group CEO. This can help them quickly build their audiences elsewhere. Plus, it can serve as a resume for brands who might want to partner with them for product advertisements, East said.


But until the deadline of Jan. 19 comes around, East said creators should continue to post regularly on TikTok, which has 170 million monthly U.S. users and remains highly effective in reaching audiences.


If the Supreme Court does not delay the ban, as Trump is asking them to do, app stores and internet service providers would be required to stop providing service to TikTok by Jan. 19. That means anyone who doesn't have TikTok on their phone would be unable to download it. TikTok users would continue to have access, but the prohibitions — which will prevent them from updating the app — will eventually make the app "unworkable," the Justice Department has said.


TikTok said in court documents that it estimates a one-month shutdown would cause the platform to lose approximately a third of its daily users in the U.S. The company argues a shutdown, even if temporary, will cause it irreparable harm, a legal bar used by judges to determine whether to put the brakes on a law facing a challenge. In under three weeks, Americans will know if the Supreme Court agrees.

## Central US pummeled by snow, ice as major storm heads east

date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Dangerous wintry conditions descended Sunday on a large swath of the central United States as a severe storm system tracked eastward, prompting travel and work disruptions from Kansas City to Washington.


Around a dozen states from Kansas to New Jersey were under winter storm warnings Sunday afternoon, according to the National Weather Service (NWS), while areas across the U.S. South faced possible tornado and cold weather threats.


Nationwide, over 60 million people were under some sort of weather alert, according to broadcaster CNN, while air traffic monitoring site FlightAware showed almost 2,200 flight cancellations and over 25,000 delays.


Gusty winds from the storm system, the first of the year, brought blizzard conditions to Kansas and Missouri, while states farther east were blanketed in multiple inches of snow.


Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear implored residents to "please stay home" after reporting multiple vehicle crashes had closed a major highway.


The NWS also warned that accumulations of up to a half inch of ice in some areas — as well as widespread tree damage from powerful wind gusts — could lead to "prolonged power outages."


A mix of freezing rain, sleet and snow began hitting Kansas early Sunday morning. Storm chaser Brian Emfinger said on X that roads around Kansas City were "a skating rink."


Video posted by the Weather Channel showed cars skidding off ice-coated highways and tractor trailers jack-knifing in Kansas, where some areas were expecting more than 30 centimeters of snow.


"Areas of heavy snow will spread eastward through the Ohio Valley and central Appalachians tonight, reaching the northern Mid-Atlantic by Monday morning," the NWS said in an update.


Areas around Washington could see up to 25 centimeters overnight from Sunday into Monday, making "hazardous travel and closings" likely, The Washington Post reported.


That could complicate the task of U.S. lawmakers, who by constitutional mandate must meet on Capitol Hill on Jan. 6 to certify the winner of last year's presidential election.


"Whether we're in a blizzard or not," House Speaker Mike Johnson said on Fox News Sunday, "we cannot delay that certification... I hope we have full attendance."


A joint session is to convene at 1:00 pm (1800 GMT) on Monday.


Bitter cold


With the jet stream diving southward, temperatures are expected to plunge, in some places to minus 18 degrees Celsius, while strong wind gusts compound the dangers.


The mercury could sink tens of degrees below seasonal norms down to the U.S. Gulf Coast. Before then, severe thunderstorms are expected across the lower Mississippi Valley, the NWS forecast.


Another major concern is freezing rain and sleet. A thick coating of ice could make travel hazardous, bring down trees and topple electricity lines.


The NWS predicted more than 1 centimeter of freezing rain over parts of the Middle Mississippi and Ohio Valley area, and warned that "long-lasting power outages" could leave millions of customers without power from Kansas to the central Appalachian Mountains.


Conditions could prove especially perilous in Appalachia, where a deadly hurricane in late September devastated communities and ravaged multiple southeastern states including Kentucky.


The new storm "will likely cause significant disruption and dangerous conditions on our roads and could cause significant power outages just 24 hours or so before it's going to get really cold in Kentucky," Governor Andy Beshear told an emergency meeting.


The governors of Kentucky, Missouri and Virginia have declared a state of emergency in their states, and have taken to social media to warn residents to stay home.

## Viola Davis, Ted Danson celebrated in film and TV at Golden Globes event

date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA

Beverly Hills, California — Viola Davis' journey to becoming one of Hollywood's most revered actors was driven by a straightforward mantra: Embrace every role, using each as a paycheck and a chance to explore new characters while honing her skills.


Davis delivered a moving, 16-minute speech while accepting the prestigious Cecil B. DeMille Award at the Golden Gala: An Evening of Excellence on Friday night. She reflected on how her turbulent upbringing fueled her passion for acting as an escape and how financial necessity often influenced her choice of roles.


"If I waited for a role that was written for me, well crafted, then I wouldn't be standing up here," said Davis, who along with Ted Danson, recipient of the Carol Burnett Award, were celebrated for their career achievements in film and television during a star-studded, black-tie gala dinner in Beverly Hills, California, just two nights before the 82nd annual Golden Globes on Sunday.


Some of the popular names in attendance included Carol Burnett, Jane Fonda, Anthony Anderson, Steve Guttenberg and singer-songwriter Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds. It's the first time the Globes hosted a separate event dedicated to both awards.


Davis said she couldn't afford to wait for the perfect role, especially as a "dark-skinned Black woman with a wide nose and big lips."


"So I took it for the money," said Davis, who won praise for a string of compelling characters in films such as "Fences," "The Woman King," "The Help" and "Ma Rainey's Black Bottom" while captivating TV audiences through the legal thriller drama "How to Get Away with Murder."


"I don't believe that poverty is really the answer to craft," she said. "I don't think there's any nobility in poverty."


Meryl Streep presented the award to Davis, who she called a pure artist who "delivers the truth every time." Both actors worked together in the 2008 film "Doubt," where Streep first became in awe of Davis, who she called her "favorite actor in the world."


The DeMille Award has been bestowed on Hollywood's greatest talents. Past recipients include Tom Hanks, Jeff Bridges, Oprah Winfrey, Morgan Freeman, Streep, Barbra Streisand and Sidney Poitier.


When Danson accepted his award, he congratulated Davis, calling her an "amazing actor."


"It's such a pleasure to be in the same room with you," said Danson, a three-time Globes winner, who has been a fixture on TV since he broke out as Boston bartender Sam Malone on NBC's comedy "Cheers." His other credits include "The Good Place," "Mr. Mayor," "Fargo," "CSI" and "CSI: Cyber," "Damages" and "Becker."


Danson currently stars in Netflix's "A Man on the Inside," which earned his first nomination since 2008 and 13th overall.


"Bia Iftikhar, who does his hair on set, said it best: 'Ted sets the tone,'" said his wife, actor Mary Steenburgen, who presented Danson with the Carol Burnett Award, which was inaugurated in 2019. Past recipients include Norman Lear, Ryan Murphy and Ellen DeGeneres. The first was Burnett herself.


Danson and Steenburgen appeared in a few projects together including "Pontiac Moon," "Gulliver's Travels" and "It Must Be Love."


"He's so loving and takes such joy in acting that all of us who are hard at work away from our families for long hours get to work on a set that is dictated by his kindness," Steenburgen said. "As his wife, watching the respect and love ... for Ted, it made me very proud."


Danson traded "I love you" with Burnett, showing admiration for each other. He thanked a number of writers, producers and actors along with the "Cheers" co-creators Glen and Les Charles, who surprised him by showing up to the event.


"I feel so grateful," he said. "I'm truly the luckiest... on Earth."


Davis quipped, "Little Viola is squealing," referring to how her younger self would be overjoyed at the actor's journey from an impoverished childhood to Hollywood stardom.


"She's standing behind me and she's pulling on my dress," said Davis, who achieved EGOT status after winning a Grammy last year for best audio book, narration, and storytelling for the recording for her memoir "Finding Me."


"She's wearing the same red rubber boots that she wore rain or shine because they her feel 'purty'" she continued. "What she's whispering is: 'I told you I was a magician.'"

## Driving into Manhattan? It'll cost you; new congestion toll starts Sunday

date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — New York’s new toll for drivers entering the center of Manhattan debuted Sunday, meaning many people will pay $9 to access the busiest part of the Big Apple during peak hours. 


The toll, known as congestion pricing, is meant to reduce traffic gridlock in the densely packed city while also raising money to help fix its ailing public transit infrastructure. 


Drivers of most passenger cars will pay $9 to enter Manhattan south of Central Park on weekdays between 5 a.m. and 9 p.m. and on weekends between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. During off hours, the toll will be $2.25 for most vehicles. 


After years of studies, delays and a last-ditch bid by New Jersey to halt the toll, the program launched without major hiccups early Sunday. But transit officials cautioned the first-in-the-nation scheme could require adjustments — and likely would not get its first true test until the workweek. 


“This is a toll system that has never been tried before in terms of complexity,” Metropolitan Transportation Authority Chair and CEO Janno Lieber said at a news conference held at Grand Central Terminal Sunday. “We don’t expect New Yorkers to overnight change their behavior. Everybody’s going to have to adjust to this.” 


The fee — which varies for motorcyclists, truck drivers and ride-share apps — will be collected by electronic toll collection systems at over 100 detection sites now scattered across the lower half of Manhattan. 


It comes on top of tolls drivers pay for crossing various bridges and tunnels to get to the city in the first place, although there will be a credit of up to $3 for those who have already paid to enter Manhattan via certain tunnels during peak hours. 


On Sunday morning, hours after the toll went live, traffic moved briskly along the northern edge of the congestion zone at 60th Street and 2nd Avenue. Many motorists appeared unaware that the newly activated cameras, set along the arm of a steel gantry above the street, would soon send a new charge to their E-Z Passes. 


“Are you kidding me?” said Chris Smith, a realtor from Somerville, New Jersey, as he drove against traffic beneath the cameras, circumventing the charge. “Whose idea was this? Kathy Hochul? She should be arrested for being ignorant.” 


Some residents and transit riders, meanwhile, said they were hopeful the program would lessen the bottlenecks and frequent honking in their neighborhoods, while helping to modernize the subway system. 


“I think the idea would be good to try to minimize the amount of traffic down and try to promote people to use public transportation,” said Phil Bauer, a surgeon who lives in midtown Manhattan, describing the constant din of traffic in his neighborhood as "pretty brutal.” 


President-elect Donald Trump, a Republican, has vowed to kill the program when he takes office, but it’s unclear if he will follow through. The plan had stalled during his first term while it waited on a federal environmental review. 


In November, Trump, whose namesake Trump Tower is in the toll zone, said congestion pricing “will put New York City at a disadvantage over competing cities and states, and businesses will flee.” 


Lieber, the MTA head, said he was not overly concerned that the president-elect would succeed in unwinding the program, even if he did follow through. “I think he understands living on 59th and 5th Avenue what traffic is doing to our city,” Lieber said Sunday. 


Other big cities around the world, including London and Stockholm, have similar congestion pricing schemes, but it is the first in the U.S. Proponents of the idea note the programs were largely unpopular when first implemented, gaining approval as the public felt benefits like faster bus speeds and less traffic. 


In New York City, even some transit riders voiced skepticism of a plan intended to raise much-needed funds for the subway system. 


“With my experience of the MTA and where they’ve allocated their funds in the past, they’ve done a pretty poor job with that,” said Christakis Charalambides, a supervisor in the fashion industry, as he waited for a subway Sunday morning in Lower Manhattan. “I don’t know if I necessarily believe it until I really see something.” 


The toll was supposed to go into effect last year with a $15 charge, but Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul abruptly paused the program before the 2024 election, when congressional races in suburban areas around the city — the epicenter of opposition to the program — were considered to be vital to her party’s effort to retake control of Congress. 


Not long after the election, Hochul rebooted the plan at the lower $9 toll. She denies politics were at play and said she thought the original $15 charge was too much, though she had been a vocal supporter of the program before halting it. 


Congestion pricing also survived several lawsuits seeking to block the program, including a last-ditch effort from the state of New Jersey to have a judge put up a temporary roadblock against it. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, has vowed to continue fighting against the scheme. 


In response, Lieber described the New Jersey governor’s views as the “definition of hypocrisy,” adding that he expected the state to adjust its strategy after “losing again and again and again” in court.

## 'Mufasa' and 'Sonic 3' rule first box office weekend of 2025

date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA

The Walt Disney Co.’s “Mufasa” claimed the No. 1 spot on the North American box office charts over the first weekend of 2025.


The photorealistic “Lion King” prequel earned $23.8 million in its third weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday. Paramount’s “Sonic the Hedgehog 3,” which has dominated the past two weekends, wasn’t far behind.


“Sonic 3” stayed close with a 3-day estimate of $21.2 million, bringing its total domestic earnings to $187.5 million and helping the overall franchise cross $1 billion worldwide. “Mufasa’s” running total is slightly less, with $169.2 million.


In third place, Focus Features’ “Nosferatu” remake defied the fate of so many of its genre predecessors and fell only 39% in its second weekend. Horror films typically fall sharply after the first weekend and anything less than a 50% decline is notable.


“Nosferatu,” which added 140 screens, claimed $13.2 million in ticket sales, bringing its running total to $69.4 million since its Christmas debut. The film, directed by Robert Eggers, already surpassed its reported production budget of $50 million, though that figure does not account for marketing and promotion expenses.


No new wide releases opened this weekend, leaving the box office top 10 once again to holdovers from previous weeks. Several have been in theaters since Thanksgiving. One of those, “Moana 2,” claimed the No. 4 spot for Disney in its sixth weekend in theaters. The animated sequel earned another $12.4 million, bumping its global total to $960.5 million.


The Bob Dylan biopic “A Complete Unknown,” dipped only slightly in its second weekend, bringing in $8.1 million. With $41.7 million total, it's Searchlight's highest grossing film since Disney acquired the company in 2019.


A24’s erotic drama “Babygirl," which added 49 locations, held steady at $4.5 million.


Another Thanksgiving leftover, “Wicked,” rounded out the top five. Universal’s movie musical was made available to purchase on VOD on Jan. 31, but still earned another $10.2 million from theaters. The movie is up for several awards at Sunday’s Golden Globes, including nominations for Cynthia Erivo, Ariana Grande, best motion picture musical or comedy and “cinematic and box office achievement,” which last year went to “Barbie.”


Also in theaters this weekend was the IMAX re-release of David Fincher’s 4K restoration of “Seven,” which earned just over $1 million from 200 locations.


The 2025 box office year is already off to a better start than 2024, up around 20% from the same weekend last year.


Final domestic figures will be released Monday. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore:


1. “Mufasa: The Lion King,” $23.8 million.


2. “Sonic the Hedgehog 3,” $21.2 million.


3. “Nosferatu,” $13.2 million.


4. “Moana 2,” $12.4 million.


5. “Wicked,” $10.2 million.


6. “A Complete Unknown,” $8.1 million.


7. “Babygirl,” $4.5 million.


8. “Gladiator II,” $2.7 million.


9. “Homestead,” $2.1 million.


10. “The Fire Inside,” $1.2 million.

## Winter storm will not delay Trump election certification in Congress, House leader says

date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA

Washington — A massive winter storm moving across the United States will not keep the U.S. Congress from meeting on Monday to formally certify Republican Donald Trump's election as president, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said on Sunday. 


"The Electoral Count Act requires this on January 6 at 1 p.m. - so, whether we’re in a blizzard or not we’re going to be in that chamber making sure this is done," Johnson told Fox News' "Sunday Morning Futures" in an interview.


Johnson said he hoped there would be full attendance despite the storm and that he had encouraged lawmakers to stay in the city.  


Forecasts called for heavy snow and high winds from the Central Plains to the mid-Atlantic states, the National Weather Service said. Severe weather advisories were issued across the eastern half of the country, including blizzard warnings in parts of Kansas. 


In Washington, mixed snow and sleet accumulations were expected to be between 7 to 18 cm, promising a difficult commute and possible closings of schools, government and businesses.  


Bad winter weather can wreak havoc in the Washington metropolitan area, which has seen mild winters in recent decades and has at times been unprepared for accumulations of snow or ice. 


Members of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives returned to Washington on Friday after the winter break and Republicans gathered on Saturday with Johnson to discuss legislative priorities. Republicans won control of both the chambers in November's election. 


Other leaders stressed they were not contemplating a weather delay. 


"No change to the schedule," said Lauren Fine, communications director for Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise. 


The certification process, usually a formality, was upended four years ago when supporters of Trump violently stormed the U.S. Capitol in a bid to halt the transfer of power to Democrat Joe Biden, who won the 2020 election. 


Trump has continued to falsely claim his 2020 defeat was the result of widespread fraud. Biden and the Democrats say they will honor the 2024 election results and proceed with certification.

## New Orleans attack, Vegas explosion highlight extremist violence by active military and veterans

date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA

While much remains unknown about the man who carried out an attack in New Orleans on New Year's and another who died in an explosion in Las Vegas the same day, the violence highlights the increased role of people with military experience in ideologically driven attacks, especially those that seek mass casualties.


In New Orleans, Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a veteran of the U.S. Army, was killed by police after a deadly rampage in a pickup truck that left 14 others dead and injured dozens more. It's being investigated as an act of terrorism inspired by the Islamic State group.


In Las Vegas, officials say Matthew Livelsberger, an active duty member of the U.S. Army Special Forces, shot himself in the head in a Tesla Cybertruck packed with firework mortars and camp fuel canisters, shortly before it exploded outside the entrance of the Trump International Hotel, injuring seven people. On Friday, investigators said Livelsberger wrote that the explosion was meant to serve as a "wakeup call" and that the country was "terminally ill and headed toward collapse."


Service members and veterans who radicalize make up a tiny fraction of a percentage point of the millions who have honorably served their country. But an Associated Press investigation published last year found that radicalization among both veterans and active duty service members was on the rise and that hundreds of people with military backgrounds had been arrested for extremist crimes since 2017. The AP found that extremist plots they were involved in during that period had killed or injured nearly 100 people.


The AP also found multiple issues with the Pentagon's efforts to address extremism in the ranks, including that there is still no force-wide system to track it, and that a cornerstone report on the issue contained old data, misleading analyses and ignored evidence of the problem.


Since 2017, both veterans and active duty service members radicalized at a faster rate than people without military backgrounds, according to data from terrorism researchers at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism, or START, at the University of Maryland. Less than 1% of the adult population is currently serving in the U.S. military, but active duty military members make up a disproportionate 3.2% of the extremist cases START researchers found between 2017 and 2022.


While the number of people with military backgrounds involved in violent extremist plots remains small, the participation of active military and veterans gave extremist plots more potential for mass injury or death, according to data collected and analyzed by the AP and START.




More than 480 people with a military background were accused of ideologically driven extremist crimes from 2017 through 2023, including the more than 230 arrested in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection — 18% of those arrested for the attack as of late last year, according to START. The data tracked individuals with military backgrounds, most of whom were veterans, involved in plans to kill, injure or inflict damage for political, social, economic or religious goals.


The AP's analysis found that plots involving people with military backgrounds were more likely to involve mass casualties, weapons training or firearms than plots that didn't include someone with a military background. This held true whether or not the plots were carried out.


The jihadist ideology of the Islamic State group apparently connected to the New Orleans attack would make it an outlier in the motivations of previous attacks involving people with military backgrounds. Only around 9% of such extremists with military backgrounds subscribed to jihadist ideologies, START researchers found. More than 80% identified with far-right, anti-government or white supremacist ideologies, with the rest split among far-left or other motivations.


Still, there have been a number of significant attacks motivated by the Islamic State and jihadist ideology in which the attackers had U.S. military backgrounds. In 2017, a U.S. Army National Guard veteran who'd served in Iraq killed five people in a mass shooting at the Fort Lauderdale airport in Florida after radicalizing via jihadist message boards and vowing support for the Islamic State. In 2009, an Army psychiatrist and officer opened fire at Fort Hood, Texas, and killed 13 people, wounding dozens more. The shooter had been in contact with a known al-Qaida operative prior to the shooting.


In the shadow of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol — led in part by veterans — law enforcement officials said the threat from domestic violent extremists was one of the most persistent and pressing terror threats to the United States. The Pentagon has said it is "committed to understanding the root causes of extremism and ensuring such behavior is promptly and appropriately addressed and reported to the proper authorities."


Kristofer Goldsmith, an Army veteran and CEO of Task Force Butler Institute, which trains veterans to research and counter extremism, said the problem of violent extremism in the military cuts across ideological lines. Still, he said, while the Biden administration tried to put in place efforts to address it, Republicans in Congress opposed them for political reasons.


"They threw, you know, every roadblock that they could in saying that all veterans are being called extremists by the Biden administration," Goldsmith said. "And now we're in a situation where we're four years behind where we could have been."


During their long military careers, both Jabbar and Livelsberger served time at the U.S. Army base formerly known as Fort Bragg in North Carolina, one of the nation's largest military bases. One of the officials who spoke to the AP said there is no overlap in their assignments at the base, now called Fort Liberty.


Goldsmith said he is concerned that the incoming Trump administration will focus on the New Orleans attack and ISIS and ignore that most deadly attacks in the United States in recent history have come from the far right, particularly if Trump's nominee for defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, is confirmed.


Hegseth has justified the medieval Crusades that pitted Christians against Muslims, criticized the Pentagon's efforts to address extremism in the ranks and ahead of Joe Biden's inauguration in the weeks after the Jan. 6 attack was himself flagged by a fellow National Guard member as a possible "insider threat."

## Fraud allegations rock South Korean adoptees and families

date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA

Her greatest fear, dormant for decades, came rushing back in an instant: had she adopted and raised a kidnapped child?


Peg Reif's daughter, adopted from South Korea in the 1980s, had sent her a link to a documentary detailing how the system that made their family was rife with fraud: documents falsified, babies switched, children snatched off the street and sent abroad.


Reif wept.


She was among more than 120 who contacted The Associated Press this fall, after a series of stories and a documentary made with Frontline exposed how Korea created a baby pipeline, designed to ship children abroad as quickly as possible to meet Western demand. The reporting shook adoption communities around the world with details about how agencies competed for babies — pressuring mothers, bribing hospitals, fabricating documents. Most who wrote were adoptees, but some were adoptive parents like Reif, horrified to learn they had supported this system.


"I can't stand the thought that somebody lost their child," Reif said. "I can't stop thinking about it. I don't know how to make it right. I don't know if I can."


Forty years ago, she was struggling with infertility. She and her husband pinned their dreams for a family on adopting a baby from Mexico, paid an agency thousands of dollars and waited for months. Then the agency's directors were arrested, and they learned that those Mexican babies had been taken from their families against their will. Reif was heartbroken but recalls even now looking at her husband and saying, "Thank God we don't have a child who was stolen."


But now she isn't sure of that. Because then they adopted two Korean children, and brought them to their home in rural Wisconsin, first a son and then a daughter. The two were not biological siblings, but both arrived with strangely similar stories in their files: their young unmarried mothers worked in factories with fathers who disappeared after they got pregnant.


Back then, Reif still believed the common narrative about foreign adoption: it saved children who might otherwise live the rest of their lives in an orphanage, die or be damned to poverty.


"I don't believe that anymore," Reif said. "I don't know what to believe."


Cameron Lee Small, a therapist in Minneapolis whose practice caters to adoptees and their families, said many are feeling an intense sense of betrayal. Individual adoptees had long shared stories of falsified identities. But the revelations this year pointed to systemwide practices that routinely changed babies' origin stories to process adoptions quickly, including listing them as "abandoned" even when they had known parents.


Small, who was also adopted from Korea in the 1980s, summarized what he's been hearing from adoptees: "I'm kind of back to nothing. What do I believe now? Who can I believe?"


Reif's daughter, Jenn Hamilton, spent her life thinking she was unwanted, often quipping, "That's what happens when you're found in a dumpster as a baby."


It has taken a toll on her all her life: She's been happily married for nine years, she said, but she has this insatiable insecurity: "I constantly find myself asking my husband, 'Are you mad at me? Did I do something wrong?' Do you want to leave me?'"


She has no idea anymore if abandonment was ever really her story, with revelations of abuses so systemic that even the Korean government likened it to "trafficking."


"You can't make that many mistakes. It has to be intentional. It was this huge tree of deception," she said. "I feel disgusted."


Holt International, the U.S.-based agency that pioneered adoptions from Korea, did not respond to repeated requests for comment for this story.


Reform is sweeping across Europe — countries have launched investigations, halted foreign adoptions and apologized to adoptees for failing to protect them. But the United States, which has taken in the most adopted children by far, has not done a review of its own history or culpability.


The U.S. State Department told AP this summer that it would work with its historian to piece together its history, and detailed initial findings that some documents might have been falsified. But it said there was no evidence that U.S. officials were aware of it. The State Department has since said that it has "been unable to identify any records that could provide insight into the U.S. government role in adoptions from South Korea in the 1970s and 1980s."


Korea's National Police Agency confirmed an increase in adoptees registering their DNA for family searches — both at domestic police stations and diplomatic offices across North America and Europe — in the weeks following the release of the AP stories and documentary in September. More than 120 adoptees registered their DNA in October and November, compared to an average of fewer than 30 a month from January to August.




Korea's government has maintained that adoptions were a necessary tool to care for needy children, including babies of unwed mothers or other children deemed as abandoned. However, Korea's Ministry of Health and Welfare acknowledged to AP that the adoption boom in the 1970s and 80s was possibly fueled by a desire to reduce welfare costs.


Korea's Truth and Reconciliation Commission has been investigating government accountability over foreign adoption problems since 2022, prompted by complaints filed by hundreds of adoptees, and is expected to release an interim report in February. The Commission has posted the AP stories on its website.


A law passed in 2023 mandates that all adoption records be transferred from private agencies to a government department called the National Center for the Rights of the Child by July, to centralize the handling of family search requests. The center has confirmed that private agencies hold about 170,000 adoption files, but director Chung Ick-Joong doubts it will acquire a space to store and manage all these records in time, due to financial constraints and other challenges. The agency expects family search requests to increase dramatically – "possibly by tenfold," according to Chung — yet has funding to add only five staff members to its team of six searchers.


Chung acknowledged that flaws in adoption laws had persisted for decades, and Korea only required adoptions to go through courts and birth records to be preserved after 2012.


"It's difficult to determine who was responsible for the inaccuracies in records before then," he said. "The adoption agency might have been at fault, the biological parents may have lied, or something might have gone wrong at the orphanage ... no one truly knows what the truth is."


Korean adoption agencies have mostly declined AP's requests for comment in recent months, often citing privacy concerns.


Advocates insist that most adoptive families thrive, with both the parents and children happily living their lives without questioning the industry as Reif and Hamilton have.


Hamilton grew up in a rural, almost exclusively white community in Wisconsin, and back then all she wanted was to be accepted. But having children of her own changed that. When her first child was born, she looked at him, and it took her breath away.


"It can't explain it, like this is the first person I know in my life that I'm biologically related to," she said.


She wanted to learn her own history, so her children could know theirs. She wrote a letter to her adoption agency, which within weeks connected her with a woman they said was her mother. It was emotional, shocking.


But soon she felt like she had more questions than answers. The woman's name didn't match the one listed on paperwork, and the name she gave for the father was also different. Birthdates didn't match, the birthplace didn't either. They had not met in a factory, she said, they had been pen pals.


Hamilton asked the woman to take a DNA test, but she said she didn't know how to access one. Hamilton came to believe this woman was not her birth mother.


The AP's reporting found numerous cases where agencies connected adoptees with supposed birth families, only for them to later discover after emotional meetings that they weren't related at all.


Hamilton has been trying to untangle the DNA results on her father's side, contacting people distantly related, cousins once removed, half great aunts.


"It becomes an obsession," Hamilton said. "It's like a puzzle that you start, and you have to find the missing pieces."


Lynelle Long, the founder of InterCountry Adoptee Voices, the largest organization of adoptees in the world, said governments at the very least need to legally mandate that agencies provide adoptees with their full and redacted documents, without the payment now often required.


Long said parents like Reif have an important role, because in Western countries, laws always favored the desires of adoptive parents — designed to make adoptions quicker and easier. Many clung to the narrative that they saved needy orphans who should be grateful, she said, especially in the U.S., where the reckoning rocking Europe has not taken hold.


"We really need adoptive parents in the United States, if they have any inkling of guilt or shame or loss, to step up, take responsibility and demand that legislation be put in place to criminalize these practices and prevent it from ever happening again," Long said.


Hamilton is close to her parents; she just renovated the basement to accommodate their visits. She's sad for herself, she said, but she's sadder for her mother, who is desperate to learn if her children actually had parents somewhere, searching for them.


"And I'm like, 'Why, so you can send us back?" Hamilton said. "I don't want to be a victim."


She said she's glad she was adopted, and does not long for that different, alternative life in Korea.


Reif loves her children profoundly, she said. But she doesn't think she would adopt from abroad again, if she'd known then what she knows now.


"I'd rather be childless than think I have somebody else's child that didn't want to give them up," she said. "I think of somebody taking my child. Those poor families, I just can't imagine it."

## 'Our county ignored Africa,' Jimmy Carter said. He didn't

date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA

NAIROBI, KENYA  — Jimmy Carter was the first U.S. president to make a state visit to sub-Saharan Africa. He once called helping with Zimbabwe's transition from white rule to independence "our greatest single success." And when he died at 100, his foundation's work in rural Africa had nearly fulfilled his quest to eliminate a disease that afflicted millions, for the first time since the eradication of smallpox.


The African continent, a booming region with a population rivaling China's that is set to double by 2050, is where Carter's legacy remains most evident. Until his presidency, U.S. leaders had shown little interest in Africa, even as independence movements swept the region in the 1960s and '70s.


"I think the day of the so-called ugly American is over," Carter said during his warm 1978 reception in Nigeria, Africa's most populous country. He said the official state visit swept aside "past aloofness by the United States," and he joked that he and Nigerian President Olesegun Obasanjo would go into peanut farming together.


Cold War tensions drew Carter's attention to the continent as the U.S. and Soviet Union competed for influence. But Carter also drew on the missionary traditions of his Baptist faith and the racial injustice he witnessed in his homeland in the U.S. South.


"For too long our country ignored Africa," Carter told the Democratic National Committee in his first year as president.


African leaders soon received invitations to the White House, intrigued by the abrupt interest from the world's most powerful nation and what it could mean for them.


"There is an air of freshness which is invigorating," visiting Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda said.


Carter observed after his first Africa trip, "There is a common theme that runs through the advice to me of leaders of African nations: 'We want to manage our own affairs. We want to be friends with both of the great superpowers and also with the nations of Europe. We don't want to choose up sides.'"


The theme echoes today as China also jostles with Russia and the U.S. for influence, and access to Africa's raw materials. But neither superpower has had an emissary like Carter, who made human rights central to U.S. foreign policy and made 43 more trips to the continent after his presidency, promoting Carter Center projects that sought to empower Africans to determine their own futures.




As president, Carter focused on civil and political rights. He later broadened his efforts to include social and economic rights as the key to public health.


"They are the rights of the human by virtue of their humanity. And Carter is the single person in the world that has done the most for advancing this idea," said Abdullahi Ahmed An-Naim, a Sudanese legal scholar.


Even as a candidate, Carter mused about what he might accomplish, telling Playboy magazine, "it might be that now I should drop my campaign for president and start a crusade for black-majority rule in South Africa or Rhodesia [now Zimbabwe]. It might be that later on, we'll discover there were opportunities in our lives to do wonderful things and we didn't take advantage of them."


Carter welcomed Zimbabwe's independence just four years later, hosting new Prime Minister Robert Mugabe at the White House and quoting the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.: "Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere."


"Carter told me that he spent more time on Rhodesia than he did on the entire Middle East. And when you go into the archives and look at the administration, there is indeed more on southern Africa than the Middle East," historian and author Nancy Mitchell said.


Relations with Mugabe's government soon soured amid deadly repression and by 1986 Carter led a walkout of diplomats in the capital. In 2008, Carter was barred from Zimbabwe, a first in his travels. He called the country "a basket case, an embarrassment to the region."


"Whatever the Zimbabwean leadership may think of him now, Zimbabweans, at least those who were around in the 1970s and '80s, will always regard him as an icon and a tenacious promoter of democracy," said Eldred Masunungure, a Harare-based political analyst.


Carter also criticized South Africa's government for its treatment of Black citizens under apartheid, at a time when South Africa was "trying to ingratiate itself with influential economies around the world," current President Cyril Ramaphosa said on X after Carter's death.


The think tank Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter founded in 1982 played a key role in monitoring African elections and brokering ceasefires between warring forces, but fighting disease was the third pillar of The Carter Center's work.


"The first time I came here to Cape Town, I almost got in a fight with the president of South Africa, Thabo Mbeki, because he was refusing to let AIDS be treated," Carter told a local newspaper. "That's the closest I've come to getting into a fist fight with a head of state."


Carter often said he was determined to outlive the last guinea worm infecting the human race. Once affecting millions of people, the parasitic disease has nearly been eliminated, with just 14 cases documented in 2023 in a handful of African countries.


Carter's quest included arranging a four-month "guinea worm cease-fire" in Sudan in 1995 so that The Carter Center could reach almost 2,000 endemic villages.


"He taught us a lot about having faith," said Makoy Samuel Yibi, who leads the guinea worm eradication program for South Sudan's health ministry and grew up with people who believed the disease was simply their fate. "Even the poor people call these people poor, you see. To have the leader of the free world pay attention and try to uplift them is a touching virtue."


Such dedication impressed health officials in Africa over the years.


"President Carter worked for all humankind irrespective of race, religion, or status," Ethiopia's former health minister, Lia Tadesse, said in a statement shared with the AP. Ethiopia, the continent's second most populous country with over 110 million people, had zero guinea worm cases in 2023.

## Italy's Meloni boosts ties with Trump in surprise Florida visit

date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA

WEST PALM BEACH, FLORIDA — Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni made a surprise trip to Florida to meet with Donald Trump late on Saturday, as the key European leader sought to buttress ties with the president-elect before his inauguration on January 20. 


Members of Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort welcomed Meloni with applause after an introduction by the president-elect, according to videos shared on social media by reporters and others. 


"This is very exciting. I'm here with a fantastic woman, the prime minister of Italy," Trump told the Mar-a-Lago crowd, according to a media pool report. "She’s really taken Europe by storm." 


Meloni is seen as a potentially strong partner for Trump given her conservative credentials and the stability of the right-wing coalition she has led in Italy since late 2022. 


She has also forged a close relationship with billionaire tech CEO Elon Musk, a close Trump ally who spent more than a quarter of a billion dollars to help him win the election. 


Tommaso Foti, Italy's EU and regional affairs minister, said on Sunday that the meeting, which had not been announced in advance, showed that Italy could act as "a diplomatic bridge between two worlds: the European Union and the USA." 


Meloni's trip comes days before she is to meet U.S. President Joe Biden during a visit to Rome from Thursday to Jan. 12. Trump defeated Biden in the November election and is preparing to return to the White House. 


While no details of their meeting have been disclosed, Meloni had planned to talk with Trump about Russia's war in Ukraine, trade issues, the Middle East and the plight of an Italian journalist detained in Tehran, according to Italian media reports. 


Trump and Meloni watched a screening of a documentary questioning the criminal investigations and legal scrutiny faced by John Eastman, a former Trump lawyer who was central to Trump's unsuccessful efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss. 


One of the biggest challenges facing Meloni is the arrest of Italian journalist Cecilia Sala in Iran on Dec. 19. 


Sala was detained three days after Mohammad Abedini, an Iranian businessman, was arrested at Milan's Malpensa airport on a U.S. warrant for allegedly supplying drone parts that Washington says were used in a 2023 attack that killed three U.S. service members in Jordan. Iran has denied involvement in the attack. 


Meloni became the latest in the handful of foreign leaders who have visited Trump in Florida since the Nov. 5 election. He has met with Argentinian President Javier Milei, Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

## Jimmy Carter's state funeral has started. Here's what to know

date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA

ATLANTA, GEORGIA — Six days of funeral observances for former President Jimmy Carter began Saturday in Georgia, where he died on Dec. 29 at the age of 100.


The first events reflected Carter's climb up the political ladder, from the tiny town of Plains, Georgia, to decades on the global stage as a humanitarian and advocate for democracy.


Here is what to know about the initial ceremonies and what happens next:


The start honors Carter's deep roots in rural south Georgia


The proceedings began at 10:15 a.m. local time Saturday with the Carter family arriving at Phoebe Sumter Medical Center in Americus.


Former Secret Service agents who protected Carter served as pallbearers, walking alongside the hearse as it exited the campus on its way to Plains.


James Earl Carter Jr. lived more than 80 of his 100 years in and around the town, which still has fewer than 700 people, not much more than when he was born on Oct. 1, 1924. Some other modern presidents — Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton — also grew up in small-town settings but Carter stands out for returning and remaining in his birthplace for his long post-presidency.


The motorcade moved through downtown Plains, which spans just a few blocks, passing near the girlhood home of former first lady Rosalynn Smith Carter, who died in November 2023 at the age of 96, and near where the couple operated the family peanut warehouses. The route also included the old train depot that served as Jimmy Carter's 1976 presidential campaign headquarters and the gas station once run by Carter's younger brother, Billy.


The motorcade passed by the Methodist church where the Carters married in 1946, and the home where they lived and died. The former president will be buried there alongside Rosalynn.


The Carters built the one-story house, now surrounded by Secret Service fencing, before his first state Senate campaign in 1962 and lived out their lives there with the exception of four years in the Governor's Mansion and four more in the White House.


A stop at Carter's boyhood home — a blend of privilege, hard work


After going through Plains, the procession stopped in front of Carter's family farm and boyhood home in Archery, just outside the town, after passing the cemetery where the former president's parents, James Earl Carter Sr. and Lillian Carter, are buried.


The farm now is part of the Jimmy Carter National Historical Park. The National Park Service rang the old farm bell 39 times to honor the 39th president.


Carter was the first president born in a hospital. But the home had no electricity or running water when he was born, and he worked his father's land during the Great Depression. Still, the Carters had relative privilege and status. Earl employed Black tenant farming families. The elder Carter also owned a store in Plains and was a local civic and political leader. Lillian was a nurse and she delivered Rosalynn. The property still includes a tennis court Earl had built for the family.


It was Earl's death in 1953 that set Jimmy on course toward the Oval Office. The younger Carters had left Plains after he graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy. But Jimmy abandoned a promising career as a submarine officer and early participant in the Pentagon's nuclear program to take over the family's peanut business after his father's death. Within a decade, he was elected to the Georgia state Senate.


Lying in repose in Atlanta, where Carter was a politician and global figure


From Archery, the motorcade headed north to Atlanta. The military-run motorcade stopped outside the Georgia Capitol, where Carter served as a state senator from 1963-67 and governor from 1971-75. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens led a moment of silence. While former governors are honored with state-run funerals, presidents — even if they served as governors — are memorialized with national rites run by the federal government.


The motorcade then proceeded to the Carter Presidential Center, which includes Carter's presidential library and The Carter Center, established by the former president and first lady in 1982. Carter's son, James Earl "Chip" Carter III, and his grandson, Jason Carter, spoke to an assembly that included many Carter Center employees whose work concentrating on international diplomacy and mediation, election monitoring, and fighting disease in the developing world continues to set a standard for what former presidents can accomplish.


Jimmy Carter, who delivered the center's annual reports until 2019, won the 2002 Nobel Peace Prize in part for this post-presidential work.


Carter was scheduled to lie in repose from 7 p.m. Saturday to 6 a.m. Tuesday, with the public able to pay respects around the clock.


What's next: A return to Washington


Carter's remains will travel next to Washington, where he will lie in state in the Capitol Rotunda until his funeral at 10 a.m. Thursday at the Washington National Cathedral. All the living presidents have been invited, and Joe Biden, a Carter ally, will deliver a eulogy. Biden also signed a bill to name a U.S. Postal Service facility in Plains after Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter.


The Carter family then will return to bury its patriarch in Plains after a private hometown funeral at 3:45 p.m. at Maranatha Baptist Church, where Carter, a devout evangelical, taught Sunday School for decades.


Carter will be buried afterward in a private graveside service, in a plot visible from the front porch of his home.

## Fed's Kugler, Daly say job not done on inflation

date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA

Two Federal Reserve policymakers said Saturday they feel the U.S. central bank's job on taming inflation is not yet done, but also signaled they do not want to risk damaging the labor market as they try to finish that job. 


The remarks, from Governor Adriana Kugler and San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, highlight the delicate balancing act facing U.S. central bankers this year as they look to slow their pace of rate cutting. The Fed lowered short-term rates by a full percentage point last year, to a current range of 4.25%-4.50%. 


Inflation by the Fed's preferred measure is well down from its mid-2022 peak of around 7%, registering 2.4% in November. Still, that's above the Fed's 2% goal, and in December policymakers projected slower progress toward that goal than they had earlier anticipated. 


"We are fully aware that we are not there yet — no one is popping champagne anywhere," Kugler said at the annual American Economic Association conference in San Francisco, California. "And at the same time ... we want the unemployment rate to stay where it is" and not increase rapidly. 


In November, unemployment was 4.2%, consistent in both her and colleague Daly's view with maximum employment, the Fed's second goal alongside its price stability goal. 


"At this point, I would not want to see further slowing in the labor market — maybe gradually moving around in bumps and chunks on a given month, but certainly not additional slowing in the labor market," said Daly, who was speaking on the same panel. 


The policymakers were not asked, nor did they volunteer their views, about the potential impact of incoming President-elect Donald Trump's economic policies, including tariffs and tax cuts, which some have speculated could fuel growth and reignite inflation.

## Jill Biden gets priciest gift from foreign leader in 2023 — a $20,000 diamond

date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden and his family were given tens of thousands of dollars in gifts from foreign leaders in 2023, according to an annual accounting published by the State Department on Thursday, with first lady Jill Biden receiving the single most expensive present: a $20,000 diamond from India's leader.


The 7.5-carat diamond from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was easily the most costly gift presented to any member of the first family in 2023, although she also received a brooch valued at $14,063 from the Ukrainian ambassador to the United States and a bracelet, brooch and photograph album worth $4,510 from the president and first lady of Egypt.


The U.S. president himself received a number of expensive presents, including a commemorative photo album valued at $7,100 from South Korea's recently impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol , a $3,495 statue of Mongolian warriors from the Mongolian prime minister, a $3,300 silver bowl from the sultan of Brunei, a $3,160 sterling silver tray from the president of Israel, and a collage worth $2,400 from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.


Federal law requires executive branch officials to declare gifts they receive from foreign leaders and counterparts that have an estimated value of more than $480. Many of the gifts that meet that threshold are relatively modest, and the more expensive ones are typically — but not always — transferred to the National Archives or put on official displays.


The $20,000 diamond was retained for official use in the White House East Wing, according to a State Department document, while the other gifts to the president and first lady were sent to the archives.


Vanessa Valdivia, a spokesperson for Jill Biden, said the diamond will be turned over to the archives after they leave office. She did not say what it was being used for.


Ukraine's ambassador, Oksana Markarova, said Friday on Facebook that a Ukrainian designer fashioned the brooch from the remains of a Russian rocket and that the piece was made from inexpensive materials, so its "true value … lies in its symbolism." The embassy's spokesperson, Halyna Yusypiuk, said U.S. officials provided the assessed value.


Recipients have the option to purchase the gift from the U.S. government at its market value, although that is rare, particularly with high-end items.


According to the State Department's Office of Protocol, which compiles the list that will be published in Friday's edition of the Federal Register, several employees of the CIA reported receiving lavish gifts of watches, perfume and jewelry, nearly all of which were destroyed. Of the gifts destroyed, they were worth more than $132,000 combined.




CIA Director William Burns received a $18,000 astrograph, which is a telescope and astrological camera, from a foreign source whose identity is classified. That is being transferred to the General Services Administration. But Burns reported receiving and destroying an $11,000 Omega watch, while numerous others did the same with luxury timepieces.


Below the rank of director, the CIA employees who reported gifts are not identified, but one of them logged an Omega Seamaster Aqua Terra watch, a ladies Omega Constellation watch, a diamond necklace, earring bracelet set, and a ring that were valued together at $65,100.


All of those were destroyed, according to the report, as was a $30,000 women's jewelry set from the Libyan jeweler Al Grew consisting of a necklace, bracelet, ring and earrings received by another CIA employee.


Another CIA employee reported receiving a men's Yacht Master II Rolex Oyster Perpetual watch worth $18,700, another reported getting a lady's Rolex Oyster Datejust watch valued at $12,500, and one other got a $7,450 Rolex Air King watch. All three of the watches were destroyed, according to the list.


Another employee reported receiving a collection of pricey Amouage Perfume worth $10,670, the destruction of which is pending, the report says.

## US finds more records found linking Credit Suisse, Nazi accounts

date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — An investigation by a U.S. Senate panel has found that troubled investment bank Credit Suisse concealed information during previous inquiries into Nazi-controlled bank accounts during World War II.


Tens of thousands of documents discovered during an ongoing examination have provided new proof of the existence of account holders linked to the Nazis, the Senate Budget Committee said in a statement released Saturday.


The bank did not reveal the existence of these accounts during previous investigations, notably in the 1990s, the committee said.


Credit Suisse, now a subsidiary of investment bank UBS, agreed in 1998 to take part in a $1.25 billion settlement of lawsuits brought by Holocaust survivors, but it has been accused of not being completely open about its past dealings with Nazis.


The Senate committee said Saturday that one set of newly discovered files, including 3,600 physical documents and 40,000 microfilms, was found to have a "high relevance rate" of Nazi connections.


It said the revelations stem from an interim report by former prosecutor Neil Barofsky, who was fired as an "independent ombudsperson" by the bank in 2022 after being pressed to limit his investigative work.


Barofsky was reinstated in the role in 2023 "as a result of the committee's investigation," and after UBS's takeover of Credit Suisse.


In a letter to the panel released Saturday, Barofsky noted the "extraordinary level of cooperation that Credit Suisse, under the leadership of UBS, has provided" since he rejoined the company.


But he said Credit Suisse had yet to share all the information it held.


The Barofsky team has discovered, among other things, accounts controlled by high-ranking SS officers, The Wall Street Journal reported.


In his letter, Barofsky highlighted "especially noteworthy" discoveries from a Credit Suisse research department.


"Numerous client files in the sample are marked with a stamp stating 'Amerikanische schwarze Liste' — meaning 'American Black List' — a list maintained by the Allies of individuals and companies that were directly financed by, or were known to regularly trade with, Axis powers," he wrote.


"One file bearing this stamp relates to an entity that was involved in selling looted Jewish assets," he added.


Contacted by AFP, UBS said it was committed to providing a complete record of the former Nazi-linked accounts in Credit Suisse's predecessor banks.


It said it would provide Barofsky with all necessary assistance in his work to shed light "on this tragic period."


The Senate panel's investigation is continuing.

## Tesla data helped police after truck explosion; experts have privacy concerns

date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — Your car is spying on you. 


That is one takeaway from the fast, detailed data that Tesla collected on the driver of one of its Cybertrucks that exploded in Las Vegas, Nevada, earlier this week. Privacy data experts say the deep dive by Elon Musk's company was impressive but also shines a spotlight on a difficult question as vehicles become less like cars and more like computers on wheels. 


"You might want law enforcement to have the data to crack down on criminals but can anyone have access to it?" said Jodi Daniels, CEO of privacy consulting firm Red Clover Advisors.  


Many of the latest cars not only know where you've been and where you are going, but also often have access to your contacts, your call logs, your texts and other sensitive information thanks to cell phone syncing. 


The data collected by Musk's electric car company after the Cybertruck packed with fireworks burst into flames in front of the Trump International Hotel Wednesday proved valuable to police in helping track the driver's movements. 


Within hours of the New Year's Day explosion that burned the driver beyond recognition and injured seven, Tesla was able to track Matthew Livelsberger's movements in detail from Denver to Las Vegas — and confirm that the problem was explosives in the truck, not the truck itself. Tesla used data collected from charging stations and from onboard software. 


"I have to thank Elon Musk, specifically," said Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Sheriff Kevin McMahill to reporters.  


Some privacy experts were less enthusiastic. 


"It reveals the kind of sweeping surveillance going on," said David Choffnes, executive director of the Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute at Northeastern University in Boston. "When something bad happens, it's helpful, but it's a double-edged sword. Companies that collect this data can abuse it." 


General Motors, for instance, was sued in August by the Texas attorney general for allegedly selling data from 1.8 million drivers to insurance companies without their consent. 


Cars equipped with cameras to enable self-driving features have added a new security risk. Tesla itself came under fire after Reuters reported how employees from 2019 through 2022 shared drivers' sensitive videos and recordings with each other, including videos of road rage incidents and, in one case, nudity. 


Tesla did not respond to emailed questions about its privacy policy. On its website, Tesla says it follows strict rules for keeping names and information private. 


"No one but you would have knowledge of your activities, location, or a history of where you've been," according to a statement. "Your information is kept private and secure." 


Auto analyst Sam Abuelsamid at Telemetry Insight, said he doesn't think Tesla is "especially worse" than other auto companies in handling customer data, but he is still concerned. 


"This is one of the biggest ethical issues we have around modern vehicles. They're connected," he said. "Consumers need to have control over their data." 


Tensions were high when the Cybertruck parked at the front doors of Trump's hotel began smoking, then burst into flames. Just hours earlier, a driver in another vehicle using the same peer-to-peer car rental service, Turo, had killed 15 people after slamming into a crowd in New Orleans, Louisiana, in what law enforcement is calling a terrorist attack. 


Shortly before 1 p.m., the Las Vegas police announced they were investigating a second incident. 


"The whole Tesla senior team is investigating this matter right now," Musk wrote on X. "Will post more information as soon as we learn anything." 


Over the next few hours, Tesla was able to piece together Livelsberger's journey over five days and four states by tracking, among other things, his recharging stops in various locations, including Monument, Colorado, Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Flagstaff, Arizona.

## Drivers skid, crash as winter storm grips central US

date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA

MISSION, KANSAS — Road conditions were deteriorating Saturday in the central U.S. as a winter storm brought a mix of snow, ice and plunging temperatures, with forecasts calling for the dreaded combo to spread eastward in the coming days.


"Winter returned," said Bob Oravec, lead forecaster at the National Weather Service in College Park, Maryland.


The polar vortex of ultra-cold air usually stays penned up around the North Pole, spinning like a top. But sometimes it escapes or stretches down to the U.S., Europe or Asia — and that's when large numbers of people experience intense doses of cold.


Studies show a fast-warming Arctic gets some of the blame for the increase in polar vortex stretching or wandering.


Snow and ice in forecast


By Saturday evening, widespread heavy snow was likely between central Kansas and Indiana, especially along and north of Interstate 70, where there was a high chance of at least 20 centimeters of snow. Part of the interstate was closed in central Kansas by the afternoon.


The storm was forecast to move then into the Ohio Valley, with severe travel disruptions expected. It will reach the Mid-Atlantic states Sunday into Monday, with a hard freeze expected as far south as Florida.


Severe thunderstorms, with the possibility of tornadoes and hail, were also possible ahead of the storm system's cold front as it crosses the Lower Mississippi Valley, the National Weather Service warned.


Car wrecks


A fire truck, several tractor-trailers and passenger vehicles overturned west of Salina, Kansas. Rigs also jackknifed and went into ditches, state Highway Patrol Trooper Ben Gardner said.




He posted a video showing his boots sliding across the highway blacktop like an ice-skating rink.


"We are in it now," Gardner said as he drove to the scene of an accident. Online, he begged for prayers and warned that some roadways were nearly impassable.


Freezing rain in Wichita, Kansas, sent authorities to multiple crashes in the morning, and police urged drivers to stay home if possible and watch out for emergency vehicles.


Governors in neighboring Missouri and nearby Arkansas declared states of emergency. Whiteout conditions threatened to make driving dangerous to impossible and heighten the risk of becoming stranded, forecasters warned.


Getting ready


Stores in Wichita were filled with shoppers stocking up on groceries in advance of the storm, and warming centers opened in churches and libraries.


Several businesses closed across the Kansas City area, and the school district in suburban Independence, Missouri, said it might need to cancel classes for one or more days.


"Get where you're going now & stay put. If you must travel, consider packing a bag & staying where you're headed," the Missouri Department of Transportation said in a message on the social platform X.


The agency warned Friday that a shortage of workers could hamper the ability to clear roads.


In Columbus, Ohio, crews treated major roadways with anti-icing liquids.


"It will be a major headache," said Tom Kines, a senior meteorologist with AccuWeather. "The storm not only has the snow threat to it but the ice threat."


Power outages could be significant particularly south of the Kansas City area, Kines said.


Temperatures dip


Starting Monday, the eastern two-thirds of the country will experience dangerous, bone-chilling cold and wind chills, forecasters said. Temperatures could be 7 to 14 degrees Celsius below normal as the polar vortex stretches down from the high Arctic.


In Chicago on Saturday, temperatures hovered near minus 7-10 Celsius and around minus 18 C in Minneapolis, while dropping to minus 25 C at International Falls, Minnesota, on the Canadian border.


Disruptions extend southward


Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin declared a state of emergency Friday evening ahead of the storm and noted it could impact people's ability to vote in the state's special elections Tuesday. In a statement on X, he encouraged residents to vote Saturday before the bad weather arrives.


A similar declaration was issued in Maryland, where officials in the historic state capital near Chesapeake Bay asked residents to remove vehicles from emergency snow routes. Annapolis also announced plans to open several garages on Sunday for free parking.


The National Weather Service predicted about 20 to 30 centimeters of snow for the Annapolis area, with temperatures remaining below freezing throughout the weekend.


In Baltimore, an extreme weather alert was issued instructing agencies to provide shelter and assistance for those in need. City officials said wind chills were expected to dip to minus 10.56 degrees Celsius overnight Saturday and remain in the teens through Tuesday.

## Blinken heads to South Korea, Japan, France

date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Antony Blinken will embark on what is expected to be his final overseas trip in office this weekend, traveling to South Korea, Japan and France. 


The State Department announced Friday that Blinken would visit Seoul, South Korean, Tokyo and Paris beginning Sunday. 


In South Korea, which is in the midst of political turmoil following the impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol, and Japan, Blinken intends to highlight the expansion of U.S. cooperation with both nations as part of the Biden administration's Indo-Pacific strategy. 


That strategy is primarily intended to blunt Chinese ambitions in the region but also to deter the nuclear threat from North Korea. Political developments in South Korea, however, after Yoon declared martial law and was later impeached, have raised questions about the stability of Washington-Seoul relations. 


The U.S. has taken a cautious approach to the uncertainty, insisting that the U.S.-South Korea alliance remains intact and iron-clad. Blinken will speak with South Korean officials about how "to build on our critical cooperation on challenges around the world based on our shared values," the State Department said in a statement. 


In Tokyo, Blinken will "review the tremendous progress the U.S.-Japan alliance has made over the past few years," the statement said. That includes a major arms sales approval announced on Friday under which the U.S. will deliver some $3.64 billion in medium-range missiles, related equipment and training to Japan. 


China has repeatedly complained about the potential sale, saying it will affect stability and security in the region, allegations that both Japan and the U.S. reject. 


Blinken will wrap up his trip in Paris in meetings with French officials to discuss developments in the Middle East and European security, particularly in Ukraine.

## Exiled Venezuelan opposition leader to visit US, speak with Biden

date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA

BUENOS AIRES, ARGENTINA — Venezuelan opposition politician Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, who fled the country after a tumultuous election and subsequent police crackdown, said Saturday he plans to speak with U.S. President Joe Biden. 


Speaking in Argentina, where he met with President Javier Milei, Gonzalez added that he was traveling to the United States on Sunday, though it was unclear when the conversation with Biden would take place. 


"We are planning a conversation with President Biden, and we are waiting for definitions regarding the new authorities," Gonzalez said in the Argentine capital, Buenos Aires, referring to incoming President-elect Donald Trump, who is set to take over on January 20. 


Gonzalez's meeting with Milei came at the start of a regional tour aimed at building international support for the man Venezuela's opposition considers the rightful president-elect. 


The 75-year-old appeared alongside Milei on a balcony of the Casa Rosada, the Argentine president's official workplace, as hundreds of Venezuelans gathered below on the Plaza de Mayo chanted "Venezuela, you are not alone!" 


The appearance came just days before Gonzalez's rival, Nicolas Maduro, is set to be sworn in for a third presidential term in Caracas. 


The United States, the European Union and dozens of other countries say Venezuelan election officials manipulated the vote results, which they have yet to publish in detail, of the July 28 elections.  


Some countries instead have recognized Gonzalez as the  winner. 


Gonzalez arrived in Buenos Aires quietly from Madrid, where he has lived in exile since fleeing Venezuela in September. Authorities in Caracas have offered a reward of $100,000 for information leading to his capture. 


Street protests erupted after the election and degenerated into clashes with police, with 28 people dead, 200 injured and more than 2,400 arrested. 


Gonzalez's schedule calls for him to visit Uruguay late Saturday, Panama on Wednesday and the Dominican Republic the day after. 


He has said he will be in Caracas on January 10 to be sworn in as president. It remains unclear how the Maduro government will respond. 


Gonzalez's visit to Argentina came amid heightened bilateral tensions following the arrest in Venezuela of an Argentine policeman on what Buenos Aires says are trumped up charges of terrorism. 


The relationship was already strained following an exchange of insults and, ultimately, Argentina's refusal to recognize Maduro's victory claim. 


The Argentine Embassy in Caracas has also been sheltering six opposition figures accused of "terrorism," a matter Gonzalez had said he would take up with Milei.
