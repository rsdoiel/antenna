Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0651 AM CST Mon Jan 13 2025

Valid 131300Z - 141200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected through tonight. A few
thunderstorms may occur near the northern/western Florida Gulf Coast
today.

...Discussion...
Prevalent warm advection/elevated moisture transport ahead of a weak
low over the northeast Gulf of Mexico will influence
eastward-developing convection today. Most of this convection will
remain focused over the open waters of the northeast Gulf of Mexico,
but a few thunderstorms could approach the Big Bend and other parts
of the northern/western Florida Gulf Coast. Destabilization inland
is expected to remain minimal, and thus severe storms are not
expected.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0243 AM CST Mon Jan 13 2025

Valid 141200Z - 151200Z

...EXTREMELY CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE VENTURA
VALLEY TO THE SAN BERNARDINO MOUNTAINS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA...

...Synopsis...
Upper ridging will begin to impinge on the West Coast as a
positively tilted mid-level trough meanders over the southern
Rockies tomorrow (Tuesday). Guidance consensus shows deep-layer
offshore flow over the southern California coastline, driven by a
strong surface pressure gradient with offshore flow, overspread by a
northeasterly 500 mb wind maximum. The deep-layer offshore flow will
support widespread 20-40 mph sustained surface winds (with higher
gusts) through at least Tuesday morning into early Tuesday
afternoon, when RH will dip to at least 10-15 percent. Similar to
Day 1 (today), the best chance for Extremely Critical conditions
tomorrow/Tuesday will be over the Ventura Valley toward the San
Bernardino mountains. Here, high-resolution guidance agreement is
greatest in showing particularly dangerous wildfire-spread
conditions lasting for several hours.
