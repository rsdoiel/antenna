## Write On: 'Inside Out 2' Co-Writers Meg LeFauve and Dave Holstein

<p>“People think sequels are easier, and I’m like, ‘No, no, it’s much harder. It is much harder to write.’ They have never written sequels, those people, because you need to do everything as well as the first and yet better, and go to new places, follow all the world rules, but create new ones. I mean, it’s just so many balls in the air,” says Meg LeFauve, co-writer for <em>Inside Out 2</em>, along with Dave Holstein.&nbsp;<br><br>In this special episode live from the Writer's Guild Foundation Library, Meg LeFauve and Dave Holstein talk about tackling a whole new set of challenges as they wrote the sequel to the beloved movie <em>Inside Out</em>. They also discuss the 5-year Pixar development process that includes the concept of failing fast.<br><br>“They really want you pushing to things that are new and innovative, so they expect you to fail. They actually want you to fail but they want you to do that quickly, right? Because we only have five years, so it’s always like, hurry up, hurry up. You know, fail. Go again. Go again,” she says.<br><br>Holstein shared some very personal advice for writing coming of age stories, like the <em>Inside Out</em> movies: get micro-focused.<br><br>“Sometimes it’s better to zoom in than to zoom out. For me, it helps to zoom in on a detail and let the detail be a microcosm for the rest of it. I know that when we were writing this film, I was thinking about my anxiety at that age and where that came from. I had a speech impediment, I had a stutter, so I hated Spanish class because I had to read out loud, and my stutter always came out in front of people, which made me very, very anxious. And I feel like, for Riley, there’s a three-day hockey camp that could determine the rest of her life. That’s where I sort of sunk into and if I was writing a different story about me, I would have gone into those details. But for me, it was about finding something very specific and very small,” says Holstein.<br><br>To hear more about the writing process, listen to the podcast.&nbsp;</p>

## Crows and Silences by Lucius Shepard: Review by Ian Mond

<p><strong>Crows and Silences</strong>, Lucius Shepard (Subterranean 978-1-64524-217-8, $60.00, 520pp, hc) December 2024.</p>
<p>When discussing Lucius Shepard, it’s inevitable to bemoan that despite his abundant talent, his work received little mainstream recognition. I observed this when I reviewed <strong>The Best of Lucius Shepard:</strong> <strong>Volume 2</strong>, quoting an obituary of Shepard penned by Christopher Priest for The Guardian. Priest felt that Shepard’s preference for the novella and his association with  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/01/crows-and-silences-by-lucius-shepard-review-by-ian-mond/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## More on AI environmental costs

GigaNotoSaurus 10/24
Small Wonders 10/24</p>
<p><strong>Philip Gelatt </strong>and <strong>JT Petty </strong>anchor the October Lightspeed with “<strong>Sully the God</strong>”, which imagines Sully as the Elon Musk of magic, the man who stole the discovery from a dead colleague and turned it into the most successful business the world has ever known.

<p>The word genius sometimes gets overused and it doesn’t always apply. Not in the case of David Lynch, who has passed away at the age of 78. Lynch was a bona fide genius who changed our cinematic language and discovered new forms of expression. From the revolutionary <em>Eraserhead</em> (1977) to his critically-acclaimed masterworks <em>Blue Velvet</em> (1986) and <em>Mulholland Drive</em>&nbsp;(2001) to co-creating and being the visionary force behind the beloved TV series <em>Twin Peaks</em>, Lynch’s legacy as an iconoclastic and groundbreaking filmmaker is secure.&nbsp;<br><br>However, Lynch was not just a director…<br><br>He was also a writer.<br><br>Lynch wrote all of his screenplays to his films (and, in most cases, was the sole writer). He also co-wrote the pilot for <em>Twin Peaks</em> and numerous key episodes of the series. A writer-director through-and-through, Lynch’s worldbuilding and characters always appeared on the page before the cameras rolled.</p>
