## A New Stick Chair Kit from Alexander Brothers

date: 2025-02-24, from: Lost Arg Press blog

Good news: Alexander Brothers is now selling a new stick chair kit for the Curved Back Armchair in &#8220;The Stick Chair Book.&#8221; The kit supplies all the parts you need in red elm (my favorite chair wood) for $295. The kit will also build the similar Irish armchair featured in Fine Woodworking magazine last year....
