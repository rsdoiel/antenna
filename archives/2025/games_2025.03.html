horror reaches its final form in Steven Soderbergh’s Presence</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-24, updated: 2025-01-24, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>The blowout success of 1999’s The Blair Witch Project really did a
number on the horror genre. It wasn’t the first faux-found-footage
movie, or even the first found-footage horror movie. But it landed
during a period where handheld cameras were increasingly small and
cheap, horror was becoming more popular and mainstream, and
internet-based marketing let […]</p>

<p>Each week on Polygon, we round up the most notable new releases to

<p>The keyboard is a popular peripheral, but few games move beyond the
common WASD controls and pursue typing and transcription as a major game
mechanic. Some classic games did require typing to go north, and
everyone knows the classic educational games of the typing genre (shout
out to Mavis Bacon), but most games use different […]</p>

<p>Card Carnival is a spin on Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth’s Queen’s Blood

<p>The second episode of Severance season 2 brings back an element
missing from its predecessor: the show’s surreal, animated opening

tying it into visual themes present in the first episode, like the

<p>The notion that all the best horror is deeply rooted in reality is
certainly debatable. After all, sometimes it’s the alienness of a horror
movie that gives it power, forcing us to fit its strangeness into our
