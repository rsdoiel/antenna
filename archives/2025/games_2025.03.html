caught in the TikTok ban</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-20, updated: 2025-01-20, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>All focus was on TikTok in the last week, as the company prepared to
— and eventually did — shut down its video-sharing app to adhere to a
national security law explicitly aimed at the ByteDance-owned company.
But the the U.S. action has resulted in a broader ripple effect. Marvel
Snap players discovered on Saturday […]</p>

weekend deal sent Skyrim rocketing back up the Steam charts</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-20, updated: 2025-01-20, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>There’s life in the old dog yet. Despite The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim
having presumably been played by every living human at this point, a 90%
off deal has made the 13-year-old role-playing game one of the
most-played games on Steam once more. The deal reduced the price of
Skyrim’s updated Special Edition to just […]</p>

Rivals player dedicates himself to its worst hero to prove she isn’t as
bad as you think</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-20, updated: 2025-01-17, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Most Marvel Rivals tier lists agree: Scarlet Witch is one of the
worst heroes to play if you plan on climbing the game’s competitive
ranks. Like Moira in Overwatch, she’s devastating if left unchecked, but
crumbles as soon as people know how to deal with her. In the highest
ranks where the meta revolves around […]</p>

<p>Dynamax Articuno is the first Legendary we’re seeing in Max
Battles for Pokémon Go. It’s making its debut during Max Monday on
Jan. 20 from 6-7 p.m. and will be available afterwards until Jan. 27
when Dynamax Zapdos will debut. While it’s likely that Dynamax Articuno
won’t be as difficult as Gigantamax Battles, it still will likely

<p>date: 2025-01-19, updated: 2025-01-19, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>TikTok is “in the process of restoring service” in the United States
after shutting down for a large portion of Sunday. Late on Saturday
night, the company voluntarily removed itself from Apple and Google’s
app stores, leaving 170 million users without the ability to use or
download TikTok to their devices. After going dark, anyone […]</p>

<p>Season 7 of Diablo 4, formally called the Season of Witchcraft, goes
live this week — a welcome injection of hell’s heat to offset winter’s
cold embrace. Season 7 is the first season to follow last year’s release
of the Vessel of Hatred expansion, giving players something new to focus
on now their DLC campaigns […]</p>

revived and killed the interactive movie — but its platform is still a

<p>date: 2025-01-19, updated: 2025-01-17, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Game designer Sam Barlow deserves a lot of credit for driving the
“redemption” of FMVs. The full-motion video game format was pioneered in
the early ’90s as a cutting-edge visual technique in an age when
computer graphics were more simplistic. But long before that, filmmakers
were experimenting with ways to make films more interactive, in […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-01-19, updated: 2025-01-19, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Netflix’s continued investment in anime has yielded fruit over the
past couple of years. The streaming service has amassed a selection of
some of not only the most popular and iconic anime series in recent
memory, but also a host of impressive original anime titles. It has
secured the platform’s position as of the go-to […]</p>

Theft Hamlet’s creators put Shakespeare in GTA to put chaos back into
Shakespeare</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-19, updated: 2025-01-19, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Grand Theft Hamlet is a documentary film, kind of. It’s also an
experimental theater project. It’s also a rough-and-ready feature-length
machinima, made entirely in-game in Grand Theft Auto Online. It’s also a
slapstick comedy of errors about three friends trying to fill an empty
period in their lives by staging a production of William Shakespeare’s
