excellent horror movies that reimagined the ghost story</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-26, updated: 2025-01-24, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Modern Hollywood’s foremost experimenter, Steven Soderbergh, has a
new movie out this week, and it’s all about ghosts. Presence, his
excellent new film and his first real foray into the horror genre, is
shot entirely from the perspective of a ghost who inhabits a house where
a new family has moved in. In the hands […]</p>

<p>Healers often get a raw deal in hero shooter games. Classes capable
of keeping players alive are critical, and can make the difference
between a team that wins and a team that loses. Despite risking life and
limb for teammates who may not deserve it, healers say they are rarely
appreciated. This axiom was true […]</p>

<p>It’s only January, but the eccentric, ambitious documentary Grand
Theft Hamlet will surely end up as one of 2025’s most interesting

Grand Theft Auto Online decided to stage a production of Hamlet within

<p>In a time when lots of franchise movies have final scenes and
stingers that allude to larger concerns in their universes, show off a
dizzying network of inter-movie connective tissue, or tease the next
project coming down the release pipeline, Star Trek: Section 31 goes

<p>Some people might call Tetris the perfect game, and it’s hard to
argue with that. Created in 1985, Tetris has endured across generations
and platforms, making its way onto essentially every platform possible.
The game is simple and timeless, with one block falling at a time. There

<p>The blowout success of 1999’s The Blair Witch Project really did a

<p>The keyboard is a popular peripheral, but few games move beyond the

Rivals player dedicates himself to its worst hero to prove she isn’t as
bad as you think</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-20, updated: 2025-01-17, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Most Marvel Rivals tier lists agree: Scarlet Witch is one of the
worst heroes to play if you plan on climbing the game’s competitive
ranks. Like Moira in Overwatch, she’s devastating if left unchecked, but
crumbles as soon as people know how to deal with her. In the highest
ranks where the meta revolves around […]</p>

<p>Dynamax Articuno is the first Legendary we’re seeing in Max
Battles for Pokémon Go. It’s making its debut during Max Monday on
Jan. 20 from 6-7 p.m. and will be available afterwards until Jan. 27
when Dynamax Zapdos will debut. While it’s likely that Dynamax Articuno
won’t be as difficult as Gigantamax Battles, it still will likely

<p>TikTok is “in the process of restoring service” in the United States
after shutting down for a large portion of Sunday. Late on Saturday
night, the company voluntarily removed itself from Apple and Google’s
app stores, leaving 170 million users without the ability to use or
download TikTok to their devices. After going dark, anyone […]</p>

<p>Season 7 of Diablo 4, formally called the Season of Witchcraft, goes
live this week — a welcome injection of hell’s heat to offset winter’s
cold embrace. Season 7 is the first season to follow last year’s release
of the Vessel of Hatred expansion, giving players something new to focus
on now their DLC campaigns […]</p>

revived and killed the interactive movie — but its platform is still a

<p>date: 2025-01-19, updated: 2025-01-17, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Game designer Sam Barlow deserves a lot of credit for driving the
“redemption” of FMVs. The full-motion video game format was pioneered in
the early ’90s as a cutting-edge visual technique in an age when
computer graphics were more simplistic. But long before that, filmmakers
were experimenting with ways to make films more interactive, in […]</p>

<p>Netflix’s continued investment in anime has yielded fruit over the
past couple of years. The streaming service has amassed a selection of
some of not only the most popular and iconic anime series in recent
memory, but also a host of impressive original anime titles. It has
secured the platform’s position as of the go-to […]</p>

Shakespeare</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-19, updated: 2025-01-19, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Grand Theft Hamlet is a documentary film, kind of. It’s also an
experimental theater project. It’s also a rough-and-ready feature-length
machinima, made entirely in-game in Grand Theft Auto Online. It’s also a
slapstick comedy of errors about three friends trying to fill an empty
period in their lives by staging a production of William Shakespeare’s
