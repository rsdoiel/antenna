<h2 id="ghostbsd-from-usability-to-struggle-and-renewal">GhostBSD: from
usability to struggle and renewal</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>This article isn’t meant to be technical. Instead, it offers a
high-level view of what happened through the years with GhostBSD, where
the project stands today, and where we want to take it next. As you may
know, GhostBSD is a user-friendly desktop BSD operating system built
with FreeBSD. Its mission is to deliver a simple, stable, and accessible
desktop experience for users who want FreeBSD’s power without the
complexity of manual setup. I started this journey as a non-technical
user. I dreamed of a BSD that anyone could use. ↫ Eric Turgeon at the
FreeBSD Foundation’s website I’m very glad to see this article published
on the website of the FreeBSD Foundation. I firmly believe that
especially FreeBSD has all the components to become an excellent desktop
alternative to desktop Linux distributions, especially now that the
Linux world is moving fast with certain features and components not
everyone likes. FreeBSD could serve as a valid alternative. GhostBSD
plays an important role in this. It offers not just an easily
installable FreeBSD desktop, but also several tools to make managing
such an installation easier, like in-house graphical user interfaces for
managing Wi-Fi and other networks, backups, updates, installing
software, and more. They also recently moved from UFS to ZFS, and intend
to develop graphical tools to expose ZFS’s features to users. GhostBSD
can always use more contributors, so if you have the skills, interest,
and time, do give it a go.</p>

a highly customisable tiling WM for Windows built with Janet</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-20, from: OS News</p>
<p>Jwno is a highly customizable tiling window manager for Windows
10/11, built with Janet and ❤️. It brings to your desktop magical
parentheses power, which, I assure you, is not suspicious at all, and
totally controllable. ↫ Jwno documentation Yes, it’s a Lisp system, so
open your bag of spare parentheses and start configuring and customising
it, because you’re going to need it if you want to use Jwno to its
fullest. In general, Jwno works as a keyboard driven tiling window
manager. When a new window shows up, it tries to transform the window so
it fits in the layout you defined. You can then use customized key
bindings to modify the layout or manipulate your windows, rather than
drag things around using the mouse. But, since a powerful generic
scripting engine is built-in, you can literally do anything with it. ↫
Jwno documentation It’s incredibly lightweight, comes as a single
executable, integrates perfectly with Windows’ native virtual desktop
and window management features, has support for REPL, and much more.</p>

<h2 id="making-video-games-in-2025-without-an-engine">Making video games
in 2025 (without an engine)</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-20, from: OS News</p>
<p>I genuinely believe making games without a big “do everything” engine
can be easier, more fun, and often less overhead. I am not making a “do
everything” game and I do not need 90% of the features these engines
provide. I am very particular about how my games feel and look, and how
I interact with my tools. I often find the default feature
implementations in large engines like Unity so lacking I end up writing
my own anyway. Eventually, my projects end up being mostly my own tools
and systems, and the engine becomes just a vehicle for a nice UI and
some rendering… At which point, why am I using this engine? What is it
providing me? Why am I letting a tool potentially destroy my ability to
work when they suddenly make unethical and terrible business decisions?
Or push out an update that they require to run my game on consoles, that
also happens to break an entire system in my game, forcing me to rewrite
it? Why am I fighting this thing daily for what essentially becomes a
glorified asset loader and editor UI framework, by the time I’m done
working around their default systems? ↫ Noel Berry Interesting and
definitely unique perspective, as I feel most game developers just pick
one of the existing big engines and work from there. I’m not saying
either option is wrong, but I do feel like the dependence on the popular
engines can potentially harm the game industry as a whole, as it reduced
diversity, drains valuable knowledge and expertise, and leaves
developers – especially smaller ones – at the mercy of a few big
players. Perhaps not every game needs to be made in Unity or Unreal.</p>

<h2 id="on-the-relationship-between-qt-and-kde">On the relationship
between Qt and KDE</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-20, from: OS News</p>
<p>Volker Hilsheimer, chief maintainer of the Qt project, says he has
learned lessons from the painful Qt 5 to Qt 6 transition, the importance
of Qt Bridges for using Qt from any language, and the significance of
the relationship with the Linux KDE desktop. ↫ Tim Anderson at Dev Class
Qt plays a significant role in the open source desktop world in
particular, because it’s the framework KDE uses. Hilsheimer notes that
KDE’s role in the Qt community is actually quite important, because not
only is it a source of people learning how to use Qt and who can thus
make contributions to the project, KDE also tends to use the latest Qt
versions, creating a lot of confidence among the wider Qt community to
also adopt the latest versions. The relationship with KDE and Qt is an
interesting one, and sometimes leads to questions about the future
availability of the open source edition of Qt since the Qt Company
licenses Qt under a dual-license structure (both open and proprietary).
To avoid any uncertainty, KDE and Qt have an agreement that covers
pretty much every possible scenario and which is worded to ensure the
availability of Qt as an open source framework. KDE, through the KDE
Free Qt Foundation, has a number rights and options to ensure the
availability of Qt as an open source framework. I’m no lawyer, so I
might get some of the details wrong, but the main points are that if the
Qt Company ever decides to discontinue the open source edition of Qt,
the KDE Free Qt Foundation has the right to release Qt under a BSD-style
license within 12 months. The same applies to any addition to Qt which
are not released as open source; they must be released under an open
source license within 12 months of initial release. This agreement
remains valid in the case of buyouts, mergers, or bankruptcies. This
agreement has existed in one form or another since the late ’90s, and
has survived Qt being owned by Nokia and Digia, as well as various other
organisational changes. Despite the issue of Qt’s ownership coming up
every now and then, the agreement is pretty airtight, and considering
its longevity there’s no reason to be worried about it at all. Still,
this structure is clearly more complex and less straightforward than,
say, the status of GTK and its relationship to GNOME, so it’s not
entirely unreasonable the issue comes up every now and then. I wonder if
we’ll ever see this situation become less complex, without the need for
special agreements. While it wouldn’t make a practical difference, it
would make things less… Legalese.</p>

<p>date: 2025-05-19, from: OS News</p>
<p>Mainframes still play a vital role in today, providing extremely high
uptime and low latency for financial transactions. Telum II is IBM’s
latest mainframe processor, and is designed unlike any other server CPU.
It only has eight cores, but runs them at a very high 5.5 GHz and feeds
them with 360 MB of on-chip cache. IBM also includes a DPU for
accelerating IO, along with an on-board AI accelerator. Telum II is
implemented on Samsung’s leading edge 5 nm process node. IBM’s
presentation has already been covered by other outlets. Therefore I’ll
focus on what I feel like is Telum (II)’s most interesting features.
DRAM latency and bandwidth limitations often mean good caching is
critical to performance, and IBM has a often deployed interesting
caching solutions. Telum II is no exception, carrying forward a virtual
L3 and virtual L4 strategy from prior IBM chips. ↫ Chester Lam at Chips
and Cheese If you’ve been keeping track, you can possibly deduce that
I’m bit of a sucker for IBM’s mainframes and big POWER machines. These

<h2 id="two-weeks-with-ar-glasses-and-linux-on-android">Two weeks with
AR glasses and Linux on Android</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-19, from: OS News</p>
<p>I recently learned something that blew my mind; you can run a full
desktop Linux environment on your phone. That’s a graphical environment
via X11 with real window management and compositing, Firefox comfortably
playing YouTube (including working audio), and a status bar with system
stats. It launches in less than a second and feels snappy. ↫ Hold the
Robot In and of itself, this is a neat trick most of us are probably
aware of. Running a full Linux distribution on an Android phone using
chroot is an awesome party trick, but I doubt many people take this
concept to its logical conclusion by connecting it up to a display,
keyboard, and mouse, and use it as their mobile workstation. Well, the
author of this article did, and he took it even one step further by
replacing the display part of the logical conclusion with AR glasses.
The AR glasses in question were a pair of Xreal Air 2 Pro, which put a
120Hz 1080p display in front of your eyes using Sony micro-OLED panels.
This will create the illusion of a 130″ screen with a 46° field of view,
from a pair of glasses that honestly do not feel that much more massive
than regular sunglasses or some of the thicker glasses frames some
people like. I’m honestly kind of impressed this is possible these days.
Add in a keyboard and mouse, and you’ve got a mobile workstation that
takes up very little space, especially since you’re carrying your phone
with you at all times anyway. Of course, you have to be comfortable with
using Linux – no Windows or macOS here – and the software side of the
equation requires more setup and fiddling than I thought it would, but
the end result is exactly like using a regular Linux desktop, but on
your phone and a pair of AR glasses instead of on a laptop or desktop.
If I had the cash to throw around on fun side projects like this (you
can help with that, actually, through Ko-Fi donations), I would totally
order a pair of these Xreal glasses to try this out.</p>

releases WSL as open source, announces CLI text editor to replace the
MS-DOS Editor</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-19, from: OS News</p>
<p>Today we’re very excited to announce the open-source release of the
Windows Subsystem for Linux. This is the result of a multiyear effort to
prepare for this, and a great closure to the first ever issue raised on
the Microsoft/WSL repo: Will this be Open Source? · Issue #1 ·
microsoft/WSL. That means that the code that powers WSL is now available
on GitHub at Microsoft/WSL and open sourced to the community! You can
download WSL and build it from source, add new fixes and features and
participate in WSL’s active development. ↫ Pierre Boulay at the Windows
Blogs Windows Subsystem for Linux seems like a relatively popular choice
for people who want a modern, Linux-based development environment but
are stuck using Windows. I’m happy to see Microsoft releasing it as open
source, which is no longer something to be surprised by at this point in
time. It leaves one to wonder how long it’s going to be before more
parts of Windows will be released as open source, since it could allow
Microsoft’s leadership to justify some serious job cuts. I honestly have
no idea how close to the real thing Windows Subsystem for Linux is, and
if it can actually fully replace a proper Linux installation, with all
the functionality and performance that entails. I’m no developer, have
no interest in Windows, so I’ve never actually tried it. I’d love to
hear some experiences from all of you. Aside from releasing WSL as open
source, Microsoft also released a new command-line text editor – simply
called Edit. It’s also open source, in its early stages, and is
basically the equivalent of Nano. It turns out 32bit versions of Windows
up until Windows 10 still shipped with the MS-DOS Editor, but obviously
that one needed a replacement. It already has support for multiple
documents, mouse support, and a few more basic features.</p>

how user-hostile Windows and macOS are, is it any wonder people long for
computers from the ’80s and ’90s?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-19, from: OS News</p>
<p>Every so often people yearn for a lost (1980s or so) era of ‘single
user computers’, whether these are simple personal computers or high end
things like Lisp machines and Smalltalk workstations. It’s my view that
the whole idea of a 1980s style “single user computer” is not what we
actually want and has some significant flaws in practice. ↫ Chris
Siebenmann I think the premise of this entire article is flawed, and
borders on being a strawman argument. I honestly don’t think there’s
many people out there who genuinely and seriously want to use an ’80s
home computer for all their computing tasks, but this article seems to
think that there are. Virtually every single person expressing interest
in and a desire for classic computers does so from a point of nostalgia,
as a learning experience, or as a hobby. They’re definitely not
interested in using any of those ’80s machine to do their banking or to
collaborate with their colleagues. Additionally, the problems and issues
people have with modern computing platforms is not that they are too
complex, but that they are no longer designed with the user in mind.
Windows, macOS, iOS; they’re all first and foremost designed to extract
money from you through ads, upsells, nag screens, and similar anti-user
features, and it’s those things that people are sick of. Coincidentally,
they are all things we didn’t have to deal with back in the ’80s and
’90s. In other words, remove the user-hostility from modern operating
systems, and people wouldn’t complain about them so much. Which seems
rather obvious, doesn’t it? It’s why using a Linux desktop like Fedora
is such a breath of fresh air. There’s no upsells for cloud storage or
streaming services, no restrictions on what I can and cannot install to
protect some multitrillion euro company’s revenue streams, no ads and
nag screens infesting my operating system – it’s just an operating
system waiting for me to tell it what it do, and then it does it. It’s
wild how increasingly revolutionary that’s becoming. Whenever I am
forced to interact with Windows 11 or whatever the current version of
macOS is, I feel such a profound and deep sadness for what they’ve
become, and it seems only natural to me that this sadness is fueling a
longing for back when these systems weren’t so user-hostile.</p>

were the MS-DOS programs that the moricons.dll icons were intended
for?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-18, from: OS News</p>
<p>Last time, we looked at the legacy icons in progman.exe. But what
about moricons.dll? Here’s a table of the icons that were present in the
original Windows 3.1 moricons.dll file (in file order) and the programs
that Windows used the icons for. As with the icons in progman.exe, these
icons are mapped from executables according to the information in the
APPS.INF file. ↫ Raymond Chen These icons age like a fine wine. They’re
clear, well-designed, easy to read, and make extraordinary good use of
the limited amount of available pixels. Icons from Mac OS, BeOS, OS/2,
and a few others from the same era also look timeless, and I wish modern
designers learned a thing or two from these.</p>
