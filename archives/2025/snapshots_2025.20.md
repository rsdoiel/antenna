## llm-pdf-to-images

date: 2025-05-18, updated: 2025-05-18, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-pdf-to-images">llm-pdf-to-images</a></strong></p>
Inspired by my previous <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-video-frames">llm-video-frames</a> plugin, I thought it would be neat to have a plugin for LLM that can take a PDF and turn that into an image-per-page so you can feed PDFs into models that support image inputs but don't yet support PDFs.</p>
<p>This should now do exactly that:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>llm install llm-pdf-to-images
llm -f pdf-to-images:path/to/document.pdf <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>Summarize this document<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span></pre></div>

<p>Under the hood it's using the <a href="https://github.com/pymupdf/PyMuPDF">PyMuPDF</a> library. The key code to convert a PDF into images looks like this:</p>
<pre><span class="pl-k">import</span> <span class="pl-s1">fitz</span>
<span class="pl-s1">doc</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-s1">fitz</span>.<span class="pl-c1">open</span>(<span class="pl-s">"input.pdf"</span>)
<span class="pl-k">for</span> <span class="pl-s1">page</span> <span class="pl-c1">in</span> <span class="pl-s1">doc</span>:
    <span class="pl-s1">pix</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-s1">page</span>.<span class="pl-c1">get_pixmap</span>(<span class="pl-s1">matrix</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span><span class="pl-s1">fitz</span>.<span class="pl-c1">Matrix</span>(<span class="pl-c1">300</span><span class="pl-c1">/</span><span class="pl-c1">72</span>, <span class="pl-c1">300</span><span class="pl-c1">/</span><span class="pl-c1">72</span>))
    <span class="pl-s1">jpeg_bytes</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-s1">pix</span>.<span class="pl-c1">tobytes</span>(<span class="pl-s1">output</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span><span class="pl-s">"jpg"</span>, <span class="pl-s1">jpg_quality</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span><span class="pl-c1">30</span>)</pre>

<p>Once I'd figured out that code I got o4-mini to write most of the rest of the plugin, using <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-fragments-github">llm-fragments-github</a> to load in the example code from the video plugin:</p>
<pre>llm -f github:simonw/llm-video-frames <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span></span>
<span class="pl-s">import fitz</span>
<span class="pl-s">doc = fitz.open("input.pdf")</span>
<span class="pl-s">for page in doc:</span>
<span class="pl-s">    pix = page.get_pixmap(matrix=fitz.Matrix(300/72, 300/72))</span>
<span class="pl-s">    jpeg_bytes = pix.tobytes(output="jpg", jpg_quality=30)</span>
<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span></span> -s <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>output llm_pdf_to_images.py which adds a pdf-to-images: </span>
<span class="pl-s"> fragment loader that converts a PDF to frames using fitz like in the example<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span> \
-m o4-mini</pre>

<p>Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/27af84e4e533872bfd59fcba69b4166f">the transcript</a> - more details in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-pdf-to-images/issues/1">this issue</a>.</p>
<p>I had some <em>weird</em> results testing this with GPT 4.1 mini. I created <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-pdf-to-images/blob/main/tests/blank-pages.pdf">a test PDF</a> with two pages - one white, one black - and ran a test prompt like this:</p>
<pre>llm -f <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>pdf-to-images:blank-pages.pdf<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span> \
  <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>describe these images<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>The first image features a stylized red maple leaf with triangular facets, giving it a geometric appearance. The maple leaf is a well-known symbol associated with Canada.</p>
<p>The second image is a simple black silhouette of a cat sitting and facing to the left. The cat's tail curls around its body. The design is minimalistic and iconic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I got even wilder hallucinations for other prompts, like "summarize this document" or "describe all figures". I have a collection of those <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/2fbef11b1737a9ae7da1b2ff58998454">in this Gist</a>.</p>
<p>Thankfully this behavior is limited to GPT-4.1 mini. I upgraded to full GPT-4.1 and got <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/0713dc0ce00bd6cd4d5990f44c865964#prompt-1">much more sensible results</a>:</p>
<pre>llm -f <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>pdf-to-images:blank-pages.pdf<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span> \
  <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>describe these images<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span> -m gpt-4.1</pre>

<blockquote>
<p>Certainly! Here are the descriptions of the two images you provided:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>First image:</strong> This image is completely white. It appears blank, with no discernible objects, text, or features.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Second image:</strong> This image is entirely black. Like the first, it is blank and contains no visible objects, text, or distinct elements.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have questions or need a specific kind of analysis or modification, please let me know!</p>
</blockquote>

## How to grow as a technical writer

date: 2025-05-18, from: Blog by Fabrizio Ferri-Benedetti

<p>We all want to do a good job. Some of us also want to get better at our craft for a number of reasons, either practical or slightly delusional. Those include getting a raise, strengthening our résume, or simply ending the day with a fragile feeling of satisfaction after <a href="https://passo.uno/technical-writing-failures/">surviving failure</a> for the nth time. They’re all good goals, though the ways of achieving them are not always straightforward. Moreover, the path to career growth is riddled with self-doubt and impostor syndrome.</p>

## qwen2.5vl in Ollama

date: 2025-05-18, updated: 2025-05-18, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://ollama.com/library/qwen2.5vl">qwen2.5vl in Ollama</a></strong></p>
Ollama announced a complete overhaul of their vision support the other day. Here's the first new model they've shipped since then - a packaged version of <a href="https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5-VL">Qwen 2.5 VL</a> which was first released <a href="https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-vl/">on January 26th 2025</a>. Here are my <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/27/qwen25-vl-qwen25-vl-qwen25-vl/">notes from that release</a>.</p>
<p>I upgraded Ollama (it auto-updates so I just had to restart it from the tray icon) and ran this:</p>
<pre><code>ollama pull qwen2.5vl
</code></pre>
<p>This downloaded a 6GB model file. I tried it out against my <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/cleo-sand.jpg">photo of Cleo rolling on the beach</a>:</p>
<pre><code>llm -a https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/cleo-sand.jpg \
  'describe this image' -m qwen2.5vl
</code></pre>
<p>And got a pretty good result:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The image shows a dog lying on its back on a sandy beach. The dog appears to be a medium to large breed with a dark coat, possibly black or dark brown. It is wearing a red collar or harness around its chest. The dog's legs are spread out, and its belly is exposed, suggesting it might be rolling around or playing in the sand. The sand is light-colored and appears to be dry, with some small footprints and marks visible around the dog. The lighting in the image suggests it is taken during the daytime, with the sun casting a shadow of the dog to the left side of the image. The overall scene gives a relaxed and playful impression, typical of a dog enjoying time outdoors on a beach.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Qwen 2.5 VL has a strong reputation for OCR, so I tried it on <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/17/pycon-poster/#datasette-poster">my poster</a>:</p>
<pre><code>llm -a https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/poster.jpg \
  'convert to markdown' -m qwen2.5vl
</code></pre>
<p>The result that came back:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It looks like the image you provided is a jumbled and distorted text, making it difficult to interpret. If you have a specific question or need help with a particular topic, please feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to assist you!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure what went wrong here. My best guess is that the maximum resolution the model can handle is too small to make out the text, or maybe Ollama resized the image to the point of illegibility before handing it to the model?</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: I think this may be <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/1046">a bug</a> relating to URL handling in LLM/llm-ollama. I tried downloading the file first:</p>
<pre><code>wget https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/poster.jpg
llm -m qwen2.5vl 'extract text' -a poster.jpg
</code></pre>
<p>This time it did a lot better. The results weren't perfect though - <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/2b46e932a16c92e673ea09dfc0186ec2#response">it ended up stuck in a loop</a> outputting the same code example dozens of times.</p>
<p>I tried with a different prompt - "extract text" - and it got confused by the three column layout, misread Datasette as "Datasetette" and missed some of the text. Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/3ececa5f5ff109a81bc6893be06f00b1#response">that result</a>.</p>
<p>These experiments used <code>qwen2.5vl:7b</code> (6GB) - I expect the results would be better with the larger <code>qwen2.5vl:32b</code> (21GB) and <code>qwen2.5vl:72b</code> (71GB) models.</p>
<p>Fred Jonsson <a href="https://twitter.com/enginoid/status/1924092556079436086">reported a better result</a> using the MLX model via LM studio (~9GB model running in 8bit - I think that's <a href="https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct-8bit">mlx-community/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct-8bit</a>). His <a href="https://gist.github.com/enginoid/5c91c920124d4a2e0ab253df769e35fa">full output is here</a> - looks almost exactly right to me.

## Quoting Neal Stephenson

date: 2025-05-18, updated: 2025-05-18, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<blockquote cite="https://nealstephenson.substack.com/p/remarks-on-ai-from-nz"><p>Speaking of the effects of technology on individuals and society as a whole, Marshall McLuhan wrote that every augmentation is also an amputation. [...] Today, quite suddenly, billions of people have access to AI systems that provide augmentations, and inflict amputations, far more substantial than anything McLuhan could have imagined. This is the main thing I worry about currently as far as AI is concerned. I follow conversations among professional educators who all report the same phenomenon, which is that their students use ChatGPT for everything, and in consequence learn nothing. We may end up with at least one generation of people who are like the Eloi in H.G. Wells’s The Time Machine, in that they are mental weaklings utterly dependent on technologies that they don’t understand and that they could never rebuild from scratch were they to break down.</p></blockquote>

<p>The playlist for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_R5A0lGi1AA3VCp6hZtgJKq4snmBQGDF">2025 EuroLLVM Developers' Meeting</a> has recently been made available, and it has a couple of interesting talks related to Apple's work on improving memory safety for C and C++, while having safer integration with Swift code.</p><p>Apple has added a few language extensions for bounds checking, fat pointers, that would already help quite a bit. They are quite similar to Microsoft's <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/code-quality/understanding-sal?view=msvc-170">SAL</a> annotations used in Visual C++.</p><p>The advantage with Apple's approach is that by having this on an open source compiler like clang, there is an higher chance that the C and C++ communities adopt such extensions, and eventually make up to the respective ISO standards.</p><p>The relevant talks on security were:</p><p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYOCPBUM1Hs">Recipe for Eliminating Entire Classes of Memory Safety Vulnerabilities in C and C++</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlevLn831R4">Adopting -fbounds-safety in practice</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmgL-97kqo">C++ interoperability with memory-safe languages</a></li>
    </ul>
</p><p>I found quite interesting the approach they decided to take to talk about current state of security, with memory safe languages being islands, the amount of existing C and C++ code in the industry, oceans, and the interop layers between languages, the beach.</p>
