<h2 id="minimal-css-only-blurry-image-placeholders">Minimal CSS-only
blurry image placeholders</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-30, from: Lean Rada‚Äôs blog</p>
<p>
Here‚Äôs a CSS technique that produces blurry image placeholders (LQIPs)
without cluttering up your markup ‚Äî <em>Only a single custom property
needed!</em>
</p>
<card-box> <code-block language="html">
<pre><code>&lt;img src="‚Ä¶" style="--lqip:192900"&gt;</code></pre>
<p></code-block></p>
<p>
The custom property above gives you this image:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<div>

</div>
<p>
</p>
<label> Try changing the property‚Äôs value <strong>(WARNING:
FLASHING)</strong> <input type="range" min="-999999" max="999999">
</label>
<script>
    {
      const card = document.currentScript.parentElement;
      const input = card.querySelector("input");
      const code = card.querySelector("code");
      const preview = card.querySelector("div");

      let currentValueStr = "192900";
      let targetCode = null

      input.addEventListener("input", event => {
        if (!targetCode) {
          targetCode = Array.from(code.querySelectorAll("span")).filter(el => el.textContent.includes(currentValueStr)).slice(-1)[0] ?? code;
        }

        const lqip = Number(event.currentTarget.value);
        // use this page's lqip to avoid breakage if I ever update the scheme
        preview.style.setProperty("--my-lqip", lqip);
        targetCode.innerHTML = targetCode.innerHTML.replace(currentValueStr, lqip);
        currentValueStr = String(lqip);
      });
    }
  </script>
</card-box>
<p>
Granted, it‚Äôs a <em>very blurry</em> placeholder especially in contrast
to other leading solutions. But the point is that it‚Äôs minimal and
non-invasive! No need for wrapper elements or attributes with long
strings of data, or JavaScript at all.

<h2>
Survey of LQIP approaches
</h2>
<p>
There have been many different techniques to implement LQIPs (low
quality image placeholders), such as a very low resolution WebP or JPEG
(<a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2015/08/06/android/the-technology-behind-preview-photos/" target="_blank">beheaded
JPEGs</a> even), optimised SVG shape placements
(<a href="https://github.com/axe312ger/sqip" target="_blank">SQIP</a>),
and directly applying a discrete cosine transform
(<a href="https://blurha.sh/" target="_blank">BlurHash</a>). Don‚Äôt
forget good old progressive JPEGs and interlaced PNGs!
</p>

<figcaption>
Canva and Pinterest use solid colour placeholders.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
At the other end of the spectrum, we have low tech solutions such as a
simple solid fill of the image‚Äôs average colour.
</p>
<p>
Pure inline CSS solutions have the advantage rendering immediately ‚Äî
even a <code>background-image: url(‚Ä¶a data URL)</code> would be fine!
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>
<a href="https://github.com/fraser-hemp/gradify" target="_blank">Gradify</a>
generates linear-gradients that very roughly approximate the full image.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
The big disadvantage of pure CSS approaches is that you typically litter
your markup with lengthy inline styles or obnoxious data URLs. My
handcoded site with no build step would be extra incompatible with this
approach!
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!-- typical gradify css --&gt;
&lt;img width="200" height="150" style="
  background: linear-gradient(45deg, #f4a261, transparent),
    linear-gradient(-45deg, #e76f51, transparent),
    linear-gradient(90deg, #8ab17d, transparent),
    linear-gradient(0deg, #d62828, #023047);
"&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://blurha.sh/">BlurHash</a></strong> is a solution
that minimises markup by compressing image data into a <strong>short
base-83 string</strong>, but decoding and rendering that data requires
additional JS‚Ä¶
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!-- a blurhash markup --&gt;

  data-blurhash="LEHV6nWB2yk8pyo0adR*.7kCMdnj"&gt;</code></pre>

BlurHash example

</figure>
<p>
Is it possible to decode a blur hash in CSS instead?
</p>
<h2>
Decoding in pure CSS
</h2>
<p>
Unlike BlurHash, we can‚Äôt use a string encoding because there are very
few if any string manipulation functions in CSS (2025), so strings are
out.
</p>
<p>
In the end, I came up with my own hash / encoding, and the
<b>integer</b> type was the best vessel for it.
</p>
<p>
The usual way to encode stuff in a single integer is by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_manipulation" target="_blank"><strong>bit
packing</strong></a>, where you pack multiple numbers in an integer as
bits. Amazingly, we can unpack them in pure CSS!
</p>
<p>
To unpack bits, all you need is bit shifting and bit masking.
<strong>Bit shifting</strong> can be done by division and floor
operations ‚Äî <code>calc(x / y)</code> and <code>round(down,n)</code> ‚Äî
and <strong>bit masking</strong> via the modulo function
<code>mod(a,b)</code>.
</p>
<pre><code>* {
/* Example packed int: */
/* 0b11_00_001_101 */
--packed-int: 781;
--bits-9-10: mod(round(down, calc(var(--packed-int) / 256)), 4); /* 3 */
--bits-7-8: mod(round(down, calc(var(--packed-int) / 64)), 4); /* 0 */
--bits-4-6: mod(round(down, calc(var(--packed-int) / 8)), 8); /* 1 */
--bits-0-3: mod(var(--packed-int), 8); /* 5 */
}</code></pre>
<p>
Of course, we could also use <code>pow(2,n)</code> instead of hardcoded
powers of two.
</p>
<p>
So, a <strong>single CSS integer value</strong> was going to be the
encoding of the ‚Äúhash‚Äù of my CSS-only blobhash (that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm calling
it now). But how much information can we pack in a single CSS int?
</p>
<h2>
Side quest: Limits of CSS values
</h2>
<p>
The spec doesn‚Äôt say anything about the allowed range for int values,
leaving the fate of my shenanigans to browser vendors.
</p>
<p>
From my experiments, apparently you can only use integers from
<strong>-999,999 up to 999,999</strong> in custom properties before you
lose precision. Just beyond that limit, we start getting values rounded
to tens ‚Äî 1,234,56<del>7</del> becomes 1,234,56<ins>0</ins>. Which is
weird (precision is counted in decimal places!?), but I bet it‚Äôs due to
historical, Internet Explorer-esque reasons.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, within the range of [-999999, 999999] there are
<strong>1,999,999</strong> values. This meant that with a single integer
hash, almost two million LQIP configurations could be described. To make
calculation easier, I reduced it to the nearest power of two down which
is 2<sup>20</sup>.
</p>
<card-box> <code>2<sup>20</sup> = 1,048,576 &lt; 1,999,999 &lt;
2,097,152 = 2<sup>21</sup></code> </card-box>
<p>
<strong>In short, I had 20 bits of information to encode the CSS-based
LQIP hash.</strong>
</p>
<box-note><strong>Why is it called a ‚Äúhash‚Äù?</strong> Because it‚Äôs a
mapping from an any-size data to a fixed-size value. In this case, there
are an infinite number of images of arbitrary sizes, but only 1,999,999
possible hash values.</box-note>
<h2>
The Scheme
</h2>
<p>
With only 20 bits, the LQIP image must be a very simplified version of
the full image. I ended up with this scheme: a single base colour + 6
brightness components, to be overlaid on top of the base colour in a 3√ó2
grid. A rather extreme version of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroma_subsampling" target="_blank">chroma
subsampling</a>.
</p>
<p><img src="https://leanrada.com/notes/css-only-lqip/scheme.png?ref=rss" alt="illustration of encoded components" width="600" height="500"></p>
<p>
This totals <strong>9 numbers</strong> to pack into the 20-bit integer:
</p>
<p>
The <strong>base colour</strong> is encoded in the <strong>lower 8
bits</strong> in the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklab_color_space" target="_blank">Oklab
colour space</a>. 2 bits for luminance, and 3 bits for each of the a and
b coordinates. I‚Äôve found Oklab to give subjectively balanced results,
but RGB should work just as well.
</p>
<p>
The <strong>6 greyscale components</strong> are encoded in the
<strong>higher 12 bits</strong> ‚Äî 2 bits each.
</p>
<p>
An offline script was created to compress any given image into this
integer format. The script was quite simple: Get the average or dominant
colour ‚Äî there are a lot of libraries that can do that ‚Äî then resize the
image down to 3√ó2 pixels and get the greyscale values.
<a href="https://github.com/Kalabasa/leanrada.com/blob/7b6739c7c30c66c771fcbc9e1dc8942e628c5024/main/scripts/update/lqip.mjs#L118-L159" target="_blank">Here‚Äôs
my script.</a>
</p>
<box-note>I even tried a
<a href="https://blog.4dcu.be/programming/2020/01/12/Genetic-Art-Algorithm.html" target="_blank">genetic
algorithm</a> to optimise the LQIP bits, but the fitness function was
hard to establish. Ultimately, I would‚Äôve needed an offline CSS renderer
for this to work accurately. Maybe a future iteration could use some
headless Chrome solution to automatically compare real renderings of the
LQIP against the source image.</box-note>
<p>
Once encoded, it‚Äôs set as the value of <code>‚Äìlqip</code> via the style
attribute in the target element. It could then be decoded in CSS. Here‚Äôs
the actual code I used for decoding:
</p>
<pre><code>[style*="--lqip:"] {
--lqip-ca: mod(round(down, calc((var(--lqip) + pow(2, 19)) / pow(2, 18))), 4);
--lqip-cb: mod(round(down, calc((var(--lqip) + pow(2, 19)) / pow(2, 16))), 4);
--lqip-cc: mod(round(down, calc((var(--lqip) + pow(2, 19)) / pow(2, 14))), 4);
--lqip-cd: mod(round(down, calc((var(--lqip) + pow(2, 19)) / pow(2, 12))), 4);
--lqip-ce: mod(round(down, calc((var(--lqip) + pow(2, 19)) / pow(2, 10))), 4);
--lqip-cf: mod(round(down, calc((var(--lqip) + pow(2, 19)) / pow(2, 8))), 4);
--lqip-ll: mod(round(down, calc((var(--lqip) + pow(2, 19)) / pow(2, 6))), 4);
--lqip-aaa: mod(round(down, calc((var(--lqip) + pow(2, 19)) / pow(2, 3))), 8);
--lqip-bbb: mod(calc(var(--lqip) + pow(2, 19)), 8);</code></pre>
<p>
Before rendering the decoded values, the raw number data values need to
be converted to CSS colours. It‚Äôs fairly straightforward, just a bunch
linear interpolations into colour constructor functions.
</p>
<pre><code>/* continued */
--lqip-ca-clr: hsl(0 0% calc(var(--lqip-ca) / 3 * 100%));
--lqip-cb-clr: hsl(0 0% calc(var(--lqip-cb) / 3 * 100%));
--lqip-cc-clr: hsl(0 0% calc(var(--lqip-cc) / 3 * 100%));
--lqip-cd-clr: hsl(0 0% calc(var(--lqip-cd) / 3 * 100%));
--lqip-ce-clr: hsl(0 0% calc(var(--lqip-ce) / 3 * 100%));
--lqip-cf-clr: hsl(0 0% calc(var(--lqip-cf) / 3 * 100%));
--lqip-base-clr: oklab(
  calc(var(--lqip-ll) / 3 * 0.6 + 0.2)
  calc(var(--lqip-aaa) / 8 * 0.7 - 0.35)
  calc((var(--lqip-bbb) + 1) / 8 * 0.7 - 0.35)
);
}</code></pre>
<card-box> <strong>Time for another demo!</strong> <label> Try different
values of <code>‚Äìlqip</code> to decode
<input type="range" min="-999999" max="999999"> </label>
<p>
<code></code>
</p>
<script>
    {
      const card = document.currentScript.parentElement;
      const input = card.querySelector("input");
      const preview = card.querySelector(".lqip-unpack").parentElement;

      let currentValueStr = "-721311";
      render(Number(currentValueStr));

      input.addEventListener("input", event => {
        const lqip = Number(event.currentTarget.value);
        render(lqip);
        currentValueStr = String(lqip);
      });

      function render(lqip) {
        preview.style.setProperty("--my-lqip", lqip);
      };
    }
  </script>
You can see here how each component variable maps to the LQIP image.
E.g. the <code>cb</code> value corresponds to the relative brightness of
the top middle area. <em>Fun fact: The above preview content is
implemented in pure CSS!</em> </card-box>
<h2>
Rendering it all
</h2>
<p>
Finally, rendering the LQIP. I used multiple <strong>radial
gradients</strong> to render the greyscale components, and a flat base
colour at the bottom.
</p>
<pre><code>[style*="--lqip:"] {
background-image:
  radial-gradient(50% 75% at 16.67% 25%, var(--lqip-ca-clr), transparent),
  radial-gradient(50% 75% at 50% 25%, var(--lqip-cb-clr), transparent),
  radial-gradient(50% 75% at 83.33% 25%, var(--lqip-cc-clr), transparent),
  radial-gradient(50% 75% at 16.67% 75%, var(--lqip-cd-clr), transparent),
  radial-gradient(50% 75% at 50% 75%, var(--lqip-ce-clr), transparent),
  radial-gradient(50% 75% at 83.33% 75%, var(--lqip-cf-clr), transparent),
  linear-gradient(0deg, var(--lqip-base-clr), var(--lqip-base-clr));
}</code></pre>
<p>
The above is a simplified version of the full renderer for illustrative
purposes. <small>The real one has doubled layers, smooth gradient
falloffs, and blend modes.</small>
</p>
<p>
As you might expect, the radial gradients are arranged in a 3√ó2 grid.
You can see it in this interactive deconstructor view!
</p>
<card-box> <strong>LQIP deconstructor!</strong> <label> Reveal the
individual layers using this slider!
<input type="range" min="0" max="100" value="0"> Change the
<code>‚Äìlqip</code> value,
<input type="range" min="-999999" max="999999"> </label>
<div>

</div>
<script>
    {
      const card = document.currentScript.parentElement;
      const [revealInput, lqipInput] = card.querySelectorAll("input");
      const preview = card.querySelector(".lqip-reveal");

      let currentValueStr = "-747540";
      render(Number(currentValueStr));

      lqipInput.addEventListener("input", event => {
        const lqip = Number(event.currentTarget.value);
        render(lqip);
        currentValueStr = String(lqip);
      });

      revealInput.addEventListener("input", event => {
        preview.style.setProperty("--reveal", event.currentTarget.value / 100);
      });

      function render(lqip) {
        preview.style.setProperty("--my-lqip", lqip);
      };
    }
  </script>
</card-box>
<p>
These radial gradients are the core of the CSS-based LQIP. The position
and radius of the gradients are an important detail that would determine
how well these can approximate real images. Besides that, another
requirement is that these individual radial gradients must be seamless
when combined together.
</p>
<p>
I implemented smooth gradient falloffs to make the final result look
seamless. It took special care to make the gradients extra smooth, so
let‚Äôs dive into it‚Ä¶
</p>
<h2>
Bilinear interpolation approximation with radial gradients
</h2>
<p>
Radial gradients use linear interpolation by default. Interpolation
refers to how it maps the in-between colours from the start colour to
the end colour. And linear interpolation, the most basic interpolation,
well‚Ä¶
</p>
<figure>
<interpolation-example></interpolation-example>

<p>
It doesn‚Äôt look good. It gives us these hard edges (highlighted above).
You could almost see the elliptical edges of each radial gradient and
their centers.

interpolation</a> at the very least when scaling up low resolution
images.
<a href="https://blog.demofox.org/2015/08/15/resizing-images-with-bicubic-interpolation/" target="_blank">Bicubic
interpolation is even better.</a>
</p>
<p>
One way to simulate the smoothness of bilinear interpolation in an array
of CSS radial-gradients is to use <strong>‚Äòquadratic easing‚Äô</strong> to
control the gradation of opacity.
</p>
<p>
This means the opacity falloff of the gradient would be smoother around
the center and the edges. Each gradient would get feathered edges,
smoothening the overall composite image.

&lt;/figure&gt;</code></pre>
</fixed-grid></prose-bleed>
<p>
However, CSS gradients
<a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/1332" target="_blank">don‚Äôt
support nonlinear interpolation of opacity yet as of writing</a> (not to
be confused with colour space interpolation, which browsers do
support!). The solution for now is to add more points in the gradient to
get a smooth opacity curve based on the quadratic formula.
</p>
<pre><code>radial-gradient(
  &lt;position&gt;,
  rgb(82 190 240 / 100%) 0%,
  rgb(82 190 204 / 98%) 10%,
  rgb(82 190 204 / 92%) 20%,
  rgb(82 190 204 / 82%) 30%,
  rgb(82 190 204 / 68%) 40%,
  rgb(82 190 204 / 32%) 60%,
  rgb(82 190 204 / 18%) 70%,
  rgb(82 190 204 / 8%) 80%,
  rgb(82 190 204 / 2%) 90%,
  transparent 100%
)</code></pre>
<figure>
<img src="https://leanrada.com/notes/css-only-lqip/interpolation-graph.png?ref=rss" width="1024" height="768">
<figcaption>
The quadratic interpolation is based on two quadratic curves
(parabolas), one for each half of the gradient ‚Äî one upward and another
downward.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
The quadratic easing blends adjacent radial gradients together,
mimicking the smooth bilinear (or even bicubic) interpolation. It‚Äôs
almost like a fake blur filter, thus achieving the ‚Äòblur‚Äô part of this
BlurHash alternative.

<h2>
Appendix: Alternatives considered
</h2>
<h3>
Four colours instead of monochromatic preview
</h3>
<p>
Four 5-bit colours, where each <b>R</b> is 2 bits, <b>G</b> is 2 bits,
and <b>B</b> is just a zero or one.
</p>
<p>
The four colours would map to the four corners of the image box,
rendered as radial gradients
</p>
<p>
This was my first attempt, and I fiddled with this for a while, but
mixing four colours properly require proper bilinear interpolation and
probably a shader. Just layering gradients resulted in muddiness (just
like mixing too many watercolour pigments), and there was no CSS blend
mode that could fix it. So I abandoned it, and moved on to a
monochromatic approach.
</p>
<h3>
Single solid colour
</h3>
<p>
This was what I used on this website before. It‚Äôs simple and effective.
A clean-markup approach could still use the custom <code>‚Äìlqip</code>
variable:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;img src="‚Ä¶" style="--lqip:#9bc28e"&gt;

&lt;style&gt;
/* we save some bytes by ‚Äòaliasing‚Äô this property */
* { background-color: var(--lqip) }
&lt;/style&gt;</code></pre>
<h3>
HTML attribute instead of CSS custom property
</h3>
<p>
We can use HTML attributes to control CSS soon! Here‚Äôs what the LQIP
markup would look like in the future:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;img src="‚Ä¶" lqip="192900"&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
Waiting for
<a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/advanced-attr" target="_blank"><code>attr()</code>
Level 5</a> for this one. It‚Äôs nicer and shorter, fewer weird
punctuations in markup <small>(who came up with the double dash for CSS
vars anyway?)</small>. The value can then be referenced in CSS with
<code>attr(lqip type(&lt;number&gt;))</code> instead of
<code>var(‚Äìlqip)</code>.
</p>
<p>
For extra safety, a <code>data-</code> prefix could be added to the
attribute name.
</p>
<p>
Can‚Äôt wait for this to get widespread adoption. I also want it for my
<a href="https://jordanbrennan.hashnode.dev/tac-a-new-css-methodology" target="_blank">TAC
components</a>.

<h2 id="incomplete-json-pretty-printer">Incomplete JSON Pretty
Printer</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-28, updated: 2025-03-28, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/incomplete-json-printer">Incomplete
JSON Pretty Printer</a></strong>
</p>
Every now and then a log file or a tool I‚Äôm using will spit out a bunch
of JSON that terminates unexpectedly, meaning I can‚Äôt copy it into a
text editor and pretty-print it to see what‚Äôs going on.
</p>
<p>
The other day I got frustrated with this and had the then-new GPT-4.5
build me a pretty-printer that didn‚Äôt mind incomplete JSON, using an
OpenAI Canvas. Here‚Äôs
<a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/67dd9d55-7f70-8006-b55d-72730f60ddbe">the
chat</a> and here‚Äôs
<a href="https://chatgpt.com/canvas/shared/67e5e9b3f7bc8191b2306a123c9d328f">the
resulting interactive</a>.
</p>
<p>
I spotted a bug with the way it indented code today so I pasted it into
Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking mode and had it make a bunch of improvements
-
<a href="https://claude.ai/share/22dc4b58-e8c4-44a4-9650-a37d21513b8d">full
transcript here</a>. Here‚Äôs the
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/incomplete-json-printer.html">finished
code</a>.
</p>
<p>
<img alt="Animated GIF demo - as I type JSON it is pretty printed below, at the end I click the Load Pelican Example button." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/pretty-print-json.gif" />
</p>
<p>
In many ways this is a perfect example of
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/19/vibe-coding/">vibe coding
</a> in action. At no point did I look at a <em>single line</em> of code
that either of the LLMs had written for me. I honestly don‚Äôt care how
this thing works: it could not be lower stakes for me, the worst a bug
could do is show me poorly formatted incomplete JSON.
</p>
<p>
I was vaguely aware that some kind of state machine style parser would
be needed, because you can‚Äôt parse incomplete JSON with a regular JSON
parser. Building simple parsers is the kind of thing LLMs are
surprisingly good at, and also the kind of thing I don‚Äôt want to take on
for a trivial project.
</p>
<p>
At one point I told Claude ‚ÄúTry using your code execution tool to check
your logic‚Äù, because I happen to know Claude can write and then execute
JavaScript independently of using it for artifacts. That helped it out a
bunch.
</p>
<p>
I later dropped in the following:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>modify the tool to work better on mobile screens and generally
look a bit nicer - and remove the pretty print JSON button, it should
update any time the input text is changed. Also add a ‚Äúcopy to
clipboard‚Äù button next to the results. And add a button that says
‚Äúexample‚Äù which adds a longer incomplete example to demonstrate the
tool, make that example pelican themed.</code>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<p>It‚Äôs fun being able to say ‚Äúgenerally look a bit nicer‚Äù and get a
perfectly acceptable result!</p>

I was there at the first Atom meeting at the Google offices. We meant so
well! And I think the basic publishing spec is good, certainly better
technically than the pastiche of different things called RSS.
</p>
<p>
Alas, a bunch of things then went wrong. Feeds started losing market
share. Facebook started doing something useful and interesting that
ultimately replaced blog feeds in open formats. The Atom vs RSS spec was
at best irrelevant to most people (even programmers) and at worst a
confusing market-damaging thing. The XML namespaces in Atom made
everyone annoyed. Also there was some confusing ‚ÄúAtom API‚Äù for
publishing that diluted Atom‚Äôs mindshare for feeds.

</p>
In a follow-up to the research that brought us the
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/May/24/golden-gate-claude/">delightful
Golden Gate Claude</a> last year, Anthropic have published two new
papers about LLM interpretability:

Tracing: Revealing Computational Graphs in Language Models </a> extends
last year‚Äôs interpretable features into
<a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2025/attribution-graphs/methods.html#graphs">attribution
graphs</a>, which can ‚Äútrace the chain of intermediate steps that a
model uses to transform a specific input prompt into an output
response‚Äù.
</li>

languages uses similar circuits for each one, hinting at an intriguing
level of generalization.

<p>
To my own personal delight, neither of these papers are published as
PDFs. They‚Äôre both presented as glorious mobile friendly HTML pages with
linkable sections and even some inline interactive diagrams. More of
this please!

<p>
<strong><a href="https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/1905331956856050135">GPT-4o
got another update in ChatGPT</a></strong>
</p>
This is a somewhat frustrating way to announce a new model. <span
class="citation" data-cites="OpenAI">@OpenAI</span> on Twitter just now:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
GPT-4o got an another update in ChatGPT!
</p>
<p>
What‚Äôs different?
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Better at following detailed instructions, especially prompts containing
multiple requests
</li>
<li>
Improved capability to tackle complex technical and coding problems
</li>
<li>
Improved intuition and creativity
</li>
<li>
Fewer emojis üôÉ
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
This sounds like a significant upgrade to GPT-4o, albeit one where the
release notes are limited to a single tweet.
</p>
<p>
ChatGPT-4o-latest (2025-0-26) just hit second place on
<a href="https://lmarena.ai/?leaderboard">the LM Arena leaderboard</a>,
behind only Gemini 2.5, so this really is an update worth knowing about.
</p>
<p>
The <span class="citation"
data-cites="OpenAIDevelopers">@OpenAIDevelopers</span> account
<a href="https://twitter.com/OpenAIDevs/status/1905335104211185999">confirmed</a>
that this is also now available in their API:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>chatgpt-4o-latest</code> is now updated in the API, but stay
tuned‚Äîwe plan to bring these improvements to a dated model in the API in
the coming weeks.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/17/llm/#chatgpt-4o-latest">wrote
about chatgpt-4o-latest</a> last month - it‚Äôs a model alias in the
OpenAI API which provides access to the model used for ChatGPT,
available since August 2024. It‚Äôs priced at $5/million input and
$15/million output - a step up from regular GPT-4o‚Äôs $2.50/$10.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre going to make these changes available as a dated model
release - the <code>chatgpt-4o-latest</code> alias is risky to build
software against due to its tendency to change without warning.
</p>
<p>
<p>A more appropriate place for this announcement would be the

<strong><a href="https://reservoirsamples.substack.com/p/thoughts-on-setting-policy-for-new">Thoughts
on setting policy for new AI capabilities</a></strong>
</p>
Joanne Jang leads model behavior at OpenAI. Their release of GPT-4o
image generation included some notable relaxation of OpenAI‚Äôs policies
concerning acceptable usage - I
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/25/introducing-4o-image-generation/">noted
some of those</a> the other day.
</p>
<p>
Joanne summarizes these changes like so:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
tl;dr we‚Äôre shifting from blanket refusals in sensitive areas to a more
precise approach focused on preventing real-world harm. The goal is to
embrace humility: recognizing how much we don‚Äôt know, and positioning
ourselves to adapt as we learn.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This point in particular resonated with me:
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Trusting user creativity over our own assumptions</strong>. AI
lab employees should not be the arbiters of what people should and
shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to create.
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
<p>A couple of years ago when OpenAI were the only AI lab with models
that were worth spending time with it really did feel that San Francisco
cultural values (which I relate to myself) were being pushed on the
entire world. That cultural hegemony has been broken now by the
increasing pool of global organizations that can produce models, but
it‚Äôs still reassuring to see the leading AI lab relaxing its approach
here.</p>

<h2 id="nomic-embed-code-a-state-of-the-art-code-retriever">Nomic Embed
Code: A State-of-the-Art Code Retriever</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-27, updated: 2025-03-27, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://www.nomic.ai/blog/posts/introducing-state-of-the-art-nomic-embed-code">Nomic
Embed Code: A State-of-the-Art Code Retriever</a></strong>
</p>
Nomic have released a new embedding model that specializes in code,
based on their CoRNStack ‚Äúlarge-scale high-quality training dataset
specifically curated for code retrieval‚Äù.
</p>
<p>
The
<a href="https://huggingface.co/nomic-ai/nomic-embed-code">nomic-embed-code</a>
model is pretty large - 26.35GB - but the announcement also mentioned a
much smaller model (released 5 months ago) called
<a href="https://huggingface.co/nomic-ai/CodeRankEmbed">CodeRankEmbed</a>
which is just 521.60MB.
</p>
<p>
I missed that when it first came out, so I decided to give it a try
using my
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-sentence-transformers">llm-sentence-transformers</a>
plugin for <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a>.
</p>
<pre><code>llm install llm-sentence-transformers
llm sentence-transformers register nomic-ai/CodeRankEmbed --trust-remote-code
</code></pre>
<p>
Now I can run the model like this:
</p>
<pre><code>llm embed -m sentence-transformers/nomic-ai/CodeRankEmbed -c 'hello'
</code></pre>
<p>
This outputs an array of 768 numbers, starting
<code>[1.4794224500656128, -0.474479079246521, ‚Ä¶</code>.
</p>
<p>
Where this gets fun is combining it with my
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Jun/18/symbex/">Symbex tool</a>
to create and then search embeddings for functions in a codebase.
</p>
<p>
I created an index for my LLM codebase like this:
</p>
<pre><code>cd llm
symbex '*' '*.*' --nl &gt; code.txt
</code></pre>
<p>
This creates a newline-separated JSON file of all of the functions (from
<code>‚Äô<em>‚Äò</code>) and methods (from <code>‚Äô</em>.*‚Äô</code>) in the
current directory - you can
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/ac45c6638ea87942383e97c5cf69ae09">see
that here</a>.
</p>
<p>
Then I fed that into the
<a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/embeddings/cli.html#llm-embed-multi">llm
embed-multi</a> command like this:
</p>
<pre><code>llm embed-multi \
  -d code.db \
  -m sentence-transformers/nomic-ai/CodeRankEmbed \
  code code.txt \
  --format nl \
  --store \
  --batch-size 10
</code></pre>
<p>
I found the <code>‚Äìbatch-size</code> was needed to prevent it from
crashing with an error.
</p>
<p>
The above command creates a collection called <code>code</code> in a
SQLite database called <code>code.db</code>.
</p>
<p>
Having run this command I can search for functions that match a specific
search term in that <code>code</code> collection like this:
</p>
<pre><code>llm similar code -d code.db \
  -c 'Represent this query for searching relevant code: install a plugin' | jq
</code></pre>
<p>
That <code>‚ÄúRepresent this query for searching relevant code:‚Äù</code>
prefix is required by the model. I pipe it through <code>jq</code> to
make it a little more readable, which gives me
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/fdc1b48b20a99714200f5d3970b1dff4">these
results</a>.
</p>
<p>
This <code>jq</code> recipe makes for a better output:
</p>
<pre><code>llm similar code -d code.db \
  -c 'Represent this query for searching relevant code: install a plugin' | \
  jq -r '.id + "\n\n" + .content + "\n--------\n"'
</code></pre>
<p>
The output from that starts like so:
</p>
<pre><code>llm/cli.py:1776

@cli.command(name="plugins")
@click.option("--all", help="Include built-in default plugins", is_flag=True)
def plugins_list(all):
    "List installed plugins"
    click.echo(json.dumps(get_plugins(all), indent=2))
--------

llm/cli.py:1791

@cli.command()
@click.argument("packages", nargs=-1, required=False)
@click.option(
    "-U", "--upgrade", is_flag=True, help="Upgrade packages to latest version"
)
...
def install(packages, upgrade, editable, force_reinstall, no_cache_dir):
    """Install packages from PyPI into the same environment as LLM"""
</code></pre>
<p>
<p>Getting this output was quite inconvenient, so I‚Äôve
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/853">opened an
issue</a>.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;Tags: &lt;a href=&quot;https://simonwillison.net/tags/nomic&quot;&gt;nomic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://simonwillison.net/tags/llm&quot;&gt;llm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai&quot;&gt;ai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://simonwillison.net/tags/embeddings&quot;&gt;embeddings&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://simonwillison.net/tags/jq&quot;&gt;jq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; </code></pre>

<p>A problem the search engine‚Äôs crawler has struggled with for some
time is that it takes a fairly long time to finish up, usually spending
several days wrapping up the final few domains. This has been actualized
recently, since the migration to slop crawl data has dropped memory
requirements of the crawler by something like 80%, and as such I‚Äôve been
able to increase the number of crawling tasks, which has led to a
bizarre case where 99.</p>

<h2 id="function-calling-with-gemma">Function calling with Gemma</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-26, updated: 2025-03-26, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/capabilities/function-calling">Function
calling with Gemma</a></strong>
</p>
Google‚Äôs Gemma 3 model (the 27B variant is particularly capable, I‚Äôve
been trying it out <a href="https://ollama.com/library/gemma3">via
Ollama</a>) supports function calling exclusively through prompt
engineering. The official documentation describes two recommended
prompts - both of them suggest that the tool definitions are passed in
as JSON schema, but the way the model should request tool executions
differs.
</p>
<p>
The first prompt uses Python-style function calling syntax:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>You have access to functions. If you decide to invoke any of the
function(s), you MUST put it in the format of
[func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, params_name2=params_value2‚Ä¶),
func_name2(params)]</code>
</p>
<p>
<code>You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response if you call
a function</code>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
(Always love seeing CAPITALS for emphasis in prompts, makes me wonder if
they proved to themselves that capitalization makes a difference in this
case.)
</p>
<p>
The second variant uses JSON instead:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>You have access to functions. If you decide to invoke any of the
function(s), you MUST put it in the format of {‚Äúname‚Äù: function name,
‚Äúparameters‚Äù: dictionary of argument name and its value}</code>
</p>
<p>
<code>You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response if you call
a function</code>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<p>This is a neat illustration of the fact that all of these fancy tool
using LLMs are still using effectively the same pattern as was described
in <a href="https://react-lm.github.io/">the ReAct paper</a> back in
November 2022. Here‚Äôs

<p>date: 2025-03-26, updated: 2025-03-26, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs
Weblog</p>
<p>
I‚Äôve added a new content type to my blog: <strong>notes</strong>. These
join my existing types:
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/search/?type=entry">entries</a>,
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/search/?type=blogmark">bookmarks</a>
and
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/search/?type=quotation">quotations</a>.
</p>
<p>
A note is a little bit like a bookmark without a link. They‚Äôre for short
form writing - thoughts or images that don‚Äôt warrant a full entry with a
title. The kind of things I used to post to Twitter, but that don‚Äôt feel
right to cross-post to multiple social networks (Mastodon and Bluesky,
for example.)
</p>
<p>
I was partly inspired by Molly White‚Äôs
<a href="https://www.mollywhite.net/micro">short thoughts, notes, links,
and musings</a>.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôve been thinking about this for a while, but the amount of work
involved in modifying all of the parts of my site that handle the three
different content types was daunting. Then this evening I tried running
my blog‚Äôs source code (using
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/files-to-prompt">files-to-prompt</a>
and <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a>) through
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/25/gemini/">the new Gemini
2.5 Pro</a>:
</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell">
<pre>files-to-prompt <span class="pl-c1">.</span> -e py -c <span class="pl-k">|</span> \
  llm -m gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25 -s \
  <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>I want to add a new type of content called a Note,</span>
<span class="pl-s">  similar to quotation and bookmark and entry but it</span>
<span class="pl-s">  only has a markdown text body. Output all of the</span>
<span class="pl-s">  code I need to add for that feature and tell me</span>
<span class="pl-s">  which files to add  the code to.<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span></pre>
</div>
<p>
Gemini gave me
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/6d9fb3e33e7105d391a31367d6a235de#response">a
detailed 13 step plan</a> covering all of the tedious changes I‚Äôd been
avoiding having to figure out!
</p>
<p>
The code
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog/pull/527">is in
this PR</a>, which touched 18 different files. The whole project took
around 45 minutes start to finish.
</p>
<p>
(I used Claude to
<a href="https://claude.ai/share/17656d59-6f52-471e-8aeb-6abbe1464471">brainstorm
names</a> for the feature - I had it come up with possible nouns and
then ‚Äúrank those by least pretentious to most pretentious‚Äù, and ‚Äúnotes‚Äù
came out on top.)
</p>
<p>
This is now far too long for a note and should really be upgraded to an
entry, but I need to post a first note to make sure everything is
working as it should.

<h2 id="introducing-4o-image-generation">Introducing 4o Image
Generation</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-25, updated: 2025-03-25, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-4o-image-generation/">Introducing
4o Image Generation</a></strong>
</p>
When OpenAI first announced GPT-4o
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/May/13/gpt-4o/">back in May
2024</a> one of the most exciting features was true multi-modality in
that it could both input <em>and</em> output audio and images. The ‚Äúo‚Äù
stood for ‚Äúomni‚Äù, and the image output examples
<a href="https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/">in that launch post</a>
looked really impressive.
</p>
<p>
It‚Äôs taken them over ten months (and Gemini
<a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/experiment-with-gemini-20-flash-native-image-generation/">beat
them to it</a>) but today they‚Äôre finally making those image generation
abilities available, live right now in ChatGPT for paying customers.
</p>
<p>
My test prompt for any model that can manipulate incoming images is
‚ÄúTurn this into a selfie with a bear‚Äù, because you should never take a
selfie with a bear! I fed ChatGPT
<a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/selfie.jpg">this
selfie</a> and got back this result:
</p>
<p>
<img alt="It's a selfie, there's a grizzly bear over my shoulder smiling." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/selfie-with-a-bear.jpg" />
</p>
<p>
That‚Äôs pretty great! It mangled the text on my T-Shirt (which says
‚ÄúLAWRENCE.COM‚Äù in a creative font) and added a second visible AirPod.
It‚Äôs very clearly me though, and that‚Äôs definitely a bear.
</p>
<p>
There are plenty more examples in
<a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-4o-image-generation/">OpenAI‚Äôs
launch post</a>, but as usual the most interesting details are tucked
away in
<a href="https://openai.com/index/gpt-4o-image-generation-system-card-addendum/">the
updates to the system card</a>. There‚Äôs lots in there about their
approach to safety and bias, including a section on ‚ÄúAhistorical and
Unrealistic Bias‚Äù which feels inspired by Gemini‚Äôs
<a href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-image-generation-issue/">embarrassing
early missteps</a>.
</p>
<p>
One section that stood out to me is their approach to images of public
figures. The new policy is much more permissive than for DALL-E -
highlights mine:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
4o image generation is capable, in many instances, of generating a
depiction of a public figure based solely on a text prompt.
</p>
<p>
<strong>At launch, we are not blocking the capability to generate adult
public figures</strong> but are instead implementing the same safeguards
that we have implemented for editing images of photorealistic uploads of
people. For instance, this includes seeking to block the generation of
photorealistic images of public figures who are minors and of material
that violates our policies related to violence, hateful imagery,
instructions for illicit activities, erotic content, and other areas.
<strong>Public figures who wish for their depiction not to be generated
can opt out</strong>.
</p>
<p>
This approach is more fine-grained than the way we dealt with public
figures in our DALL¬∑E series of models, where we used technical
mitigations intended to prevent any images of a public figure from being
generated. <strong>This change opens the possibility of helpful and
beneficial uses in areas like educational, historical, satirical and
political speech</strong>. After launch, we will continue to monitor
usage of this capability, evaluating our policies, and will adjust them
if needed.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Given that ‚Äúpublic figures who wish for their depiction not to be
generated can opt out‚Äù I wonder if we‚Äôll see a stampede of public
figures to do exactly that!
</p>
<p>
<strong>Update</strong>: There‚Äôs significant confusion right now over
this new feature because it is being rolled out gradually but older
ChatGPT can still generate images using DALL-E instead‚Ä¶ and there is no
visual indication in the ChatGPT UI explaining which image generation
method it used!
</p>
<p>
OpenAI made the same mistake last year
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/May/15/chatgpt-in-4o-mode/">when
they announced ChatGPT advanced voice mode</a> but failed to clarify
that ChatGPT was still running the previous, less impressive voice
implementation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Update 2</strong>: Images created with DALL-E through the
ChatGPT web interface now show a note with a warning:
</p>
<p>
<p><img alt="Created with DALL-E with an information icon. Clicking it reveals DALL-E is OpenAI's legacy image generation model. A new model is rolling out in ChatGPT soon." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/dall-e-warning.jpg" /></p>

This task is meant to be almost impossible: pelicans are the wrong shape
to ride bicycles! Given that, I think this is a good attempt - I like it

<p>
I had
<a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/russian-pelican-in-spanish.mp3">an
MP3</a> lying around from
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/26/russian-spanish-pelican/">a
previous experiment</a> which mixes English and Spanish. I tried running
it with the prompt <code>transcribe</code> to see what would happen:
</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell">

</div>
<p>
I got back this, with timestamps interspersed with the text:

<p>
This inspired me to try again, this time including

<p>
I confirmed that the timestamps match the audio. This is fantastic.
</p>
<p>
Let‚Äôs try that against a ten minute snippet of
<a href="https://realpython.com/podcasts/rpp/236/">a podcast episode</a>
I was on:

<p>
Useful LLM trick: you can use <code>llm logs -c ‚Äìdata</code> to get just
the JSON data from the most recent prompt response, so I ran this:

<p>
A spot check of the timestamps showed them in the right place. Gemini
2.5 supports long context prompts so it‚Äôs possible this works well for
much longer audio files - it would be interesting to dig deeper and try
that out.
</p>
<h4 id="bounding-boxes">
Bounding boxes
</h4>
<p>
One of my favourite features of previous Gemini models is their support
for bounding boxes: you can prompt them to return boxes around objects
in images.
</p>
<p>
I built a separate tool for experimenting with this feature in August
last year, which I described in
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Aug/26/gemini-bounding-box-visualization/">Building
a tool showing how Gemini Pro can return bounding boxes for objects in
images</a>. I‚Äôve now upgraded that tool to add support the new model.
</p>
<p>
You can access it at
<a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/gemini-bbox">tools.simonwillison.net/gemini-bbox</a>
- you‚Äôll need to provide your own Gemini API key which is sent directly
to their API from your browser (it won‚Äôt be logged by an intermediary).
</p>
<p>
I tried it out on
<a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/challenging-pelicans.jpg">a
challenging photograph</a> of some pelicans‚Ä¶ and it worked extremely
well:
</p>
<p>
My prompt was:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>Return bounding boxes around pelicans as JSON arrays [ymin, xmin,
ymax, xmax]</code>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The Gemini models are all trained to return bounding boxes scaled
between 0 and 100. My tool knows how to convert those back to the same
dimensions as the input image.
</p>
<p>
Here‚Äôs what the visualized result looked like:
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/gemini-pelicans-bbox.jpg" alt="Pelicans with bounding boxes around them" style="max-width: 100%;" />
</p>
<p>
It got almost all of them! I like how it didn‚Äôt draw a box around the
one egret that had made it into the photo.
</p>
<h4 id="characteristics">
More characteristics of the model
</h4>
<p>
Here‚Äôs the
<a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models#gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25">official
model listing</a> in the Gemini docs. Key details:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Input token limit: 1,000,000
</li>
<li>
Output token limit: 64,000 - this is a <em>huge</em> upgrade, all of the
other listed models have 8,192 for this (correction:
<a href="https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/flash-thinking/">Gemini
2.0 Flash Thinking</a> also had a 64,000 output length)
</li>
<li>
Knowledge cut-off: January 2025 - an improvement on Gemini 2.0‚Äôs August
2024
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="gemini-2-5-pro-is-a-very-strong-new-model">
Gemini 2.5 Pro is a very strong new model
</h4>
<p>
I‚Äôve hardly scratched the surface when it comes to trying out Gemini 2.5
Pro so far. How‚Äôs its creative writing? Factual knowledge about the
world? Can it write great code in Python, JavaScript, Rust and more?
</p>
<p>
The Gemini family of models have capabilities that set them apart from
other models:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Long context length - Gemini 2.5 Pro supports up to 1 million tokens
</li>
<li>
Audio input - something which few other models support, certainly not at
this length and with this level of timestamp accuracy
</li>
<li>
Accurate bounding box detection for image inputs
</li>
</ul>
<p>
My experiments so far with these capabilities indicate that Gemini 2.5
Pro really is a very strong new model. I‚Äôm looking forward to exploring
more of what it can do.
</p>
<h4 id="update-it-s-very-good-at-code">
Update: it‚Äôs very good at code
</h4>
<p>
I spent this evening trying it out for coding tasks, and it‚Äôs very, very
impressive. I‚Äôm seeing results for Python that feel comparable to my
previous favourite Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and appear to be benefitting from
Gemini 2.5 Pro‚Äôs default reasoning mode and long context.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôve been wanting to add a new content type of ‚Äúnotes‚Äù to my blog for
quite a while now, but I was put off by the anticipated tedium of all of
the different places in the codebase that would need to be updated.
</p>
<p>
That feature is now live.
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/26/notes/">Here are my
notes</a> on creating that notes feature using Gemini 2.5 Pro. It
crunched through my entire codebase and figured out all of the places I
needed to change - 18 files in total, as you can see in
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog/pull/527/files">the
resulting PR</a>. The whole project took about 45 minutes from start to
finish - averaging less than three minutes per file I had to modify.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôve thrown a whole bunch of other coding challenges at it, and the
bottleneck on evaluating them has become my own mental capacity to
review the resulting code!
</p>
<p>
Here‚Äôs another, more complex example. This hasn‚Äôt resulted in actual
running code yet but it took a big bite out of an architectural design
problem I‚Äôve been stewing on for a very long time.
</p>
<p>
My <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM project</a> needs support for
tools - a way to teach different LLMs how to request tool execution,
then have those tools (implemented in Python) run and return their
results back to the models.
</p>
<p>
Designing this is really hard, because I need to create an abstraction
that works across multiple different model providers, each powered by a
different plugin.
</p>
<p>
Could Gemini 2.5 Pro help unblock me by proposing an architectural
approach that might work?
</p>
<p>
I started by combining the Python and Markdown files for my
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils">sqlite-utils</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm">llm</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-gemini">llm-gemini</a>, and
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-anthropic">llm-anthropic</a>
repositories into one big document:
</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell">
<pre>files-to-prompt sqlite-utils llm llm-gemini llm-anthropic -e md -e py -c</pre>
</div>
<p>
Piping it through <a href="https://github.com/simonw/ttok">ttok</a>
showed that to be 316,098 tokens (using the OpenAI tokenizer, but the
Gemini tokenizer is likely a similar number).
</p>
<p>
Then I fed that all into Gemini 2.5 Pro with the following prompt:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Provide a detailed design proposal for adding tool calling support to
LLM
</p>
<p>
Different model plugins will have different ways of executing tools, but
LLM itself should provide both a Python and a CLI abstraction over these
differences.
</p>
<p>
Tool calling involves passing tool definitions to a model, the model
then replies with tools it would like executed, the harness code then
executes those and passes the result back to the model and continues in
a loop until the model stops requesting tools. This should happen as
part of the existing llm.Conversation mechanism.
</p>
<p>
At the Python layer tools should be provided as Python functions that
use type hints, which can then be converted into JSON schema using
Pydantic - similar to how the existing schema= mechanism works.
</p>
<p>
For the CLI option tools will be provided as an option passed to the
command, similar to how the sqlite-utils convert CLI mechanism works.‚Äô
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I‚Äôve been thinking about this problem for over a year now.
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/481f46a779f20d8650b4fc5854f070c5">Gemini
2.5 Pro‚Äôs response</a> isn‚Äôt exactly what I‚Äôm going to do, but it did
include a flurry of genuinely useful suggestions to help me craft my
final approach.
</p>
<p>
I hadn‚Äôt thought about the need for asyncio support for tool functions
at all, so this idea from Gemini 2.5 Pro was very welcome:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The <code>AsyncConversation.prompt()</code> method will mirror the
synchronous API, accepting the <code>tools</code> parameter and handling
the tool calling loop using <code>async/await</code> for tool execution
if the tool functions themselves are async. If tool functions are
synchronous, they will be run in a thread pool executor via
<code>asyncio.to_thread</code>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Watching Gemini crunch through some of the more complex problems I‚Äôve
been dragging my heels on reminded me of something Harper Reed wrote
<a href="https://harper.blog/2025/02/16/my-llm-codegen-workflow-atm/">about
his workflow with LLMs for code</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
My hack to-do list is empty because I built everything. I keep thinking
of new things and knocking them out while watching a movie or something.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I‚Äôve been stressing quite a bit about my backlog of incomplete projects
recently. I don‚Äôt think Gemini 2.5 Pro is quite going to work through
all of them while I‚Äôm watching TV, but it does feel like it‚Äôs going to
help make a significant dent in them.

<b>We deployed 100 reinforcement learning (RL)-controlled cars into
rush-hour highway traffic to smooth congestion and reduce fuel
consumption for everyone.</b> Our goal is to tackle
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNokBgtSUvQ" target="_blank">‚Äústop-and-go‚Äù
waves</a>, those frustrating slowdowns and speedups that usually have no
clear cause but lead to congestion and significant energy waste. To
train efficient flow-smoothing controllers, we built fast, data-driven
simulations that RL agents interact with, learning to maximize energy
efficiency while maintaining throughput and operating safely around
human drivers.
</p>
<p>
Overall, a small proportion of well-controlled autonomous vehicles (AVs)
is enough to significantly improve traffic flow and fuel efficiency for
all drivers on the road. Moreover, the trained controllers are designed
to be deployable on most modern vehicles, operating in a decentralized
manner and relying on standard radar sensors. In our
<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10858625" target="_blank">latest
paper</a>, we explore the challenges of deploying RL controllers on a
large-scale, from simulation to the field, during this 100-car
experiment.

<br /> <i>A stop-and-go wave moving backwards through highway
traffic.</i>
</p>
<p>
If you drive, you‚Äôve surely experienced the frustration of stop-and-go
waves, those seemingly inexplicable traffic slowdowns that appear out of
nowhere and then suddenly clear up. These waves are often caused by
small fluctuations in our driving behavior that get amplified through
the flow of traffic. We naturally adjust our speed based on the vehicle
in front of us. If the gap opens, we speed up to keep up. If they brake,
we also slow down. But due to our nonzero reaction time, we might brake
just a bit harder than the vehicle in front. The next driver behind us
does the same, and this keeps amplifying. Over time, what started as an
insignificant slowdown turns into a full stop further back in traffic.
These waves move backward through the traffic stream, leading to
significant drops in energy efficiency due to frequent accelerations,
accompanied by increased CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and accident risk.
</p>
<p>
And this isn‚Äôt an isolated phenomenon! These waves are ubiquitous on
busy roads when the traffic density exceeds a critical threshold. So how
can we address this problem? Traditional approaches like ramp metering
and variable speed limits attempt to manage traffic flow, but they often
require costly infrastructure and centralized coordination. A more
scalable approach is to use AVs, which can dynamically adjust their
driving behavior in real-time. However, simply inserting AVs among human
drivers isn‚Äôt enough: they must also drive in a smarter way that makes
traffic better for everyone, which is where RL comes in.
</p>

<br /> <i><b>Fundamental diagram of traffic flow.</b> The number of cars
on the road (density) affects how much traffic is moving forward (flow).
At low density, adding more cars increases flow because more vehicles
can pass through. But beyond a critical threshold, cars start blocking
each other, leading to congestion, where adding more cars actually slows

Reinforcement learning for wave-smoothing AVs
</h2>
<p>
RL is a powerful control approach where an agent learns to maximize a
reward signal through interactions with an environment. The agent
collects experience through trial and error, learns from its mistakes,
and improves over time. In our case, the environment is a mixed-autonomy
traffic scenario, where AVs learn driving strategies to dampen
stop-and-go waves and reduce fuel consumption for both themselves and
nearby human-driven vehicles.
</p>
<p>
Training these RL agents requires fast simulations with realistic
traffic dynamics that can replicate highway stop-and-go behavior. To
achieve this, we leveraged experimental data collected on Interstate 24
(I-24) near Nashville, Tennessee, and used it to build simulations where
vehicles replay highway trajectories, creating unstable traffic that AVs
driving behind them learn to smooth out.

<br /> <i>Simulation replaying a highway trajectory that exhibits
several stop-and-go waves.</i>
</p>
<p>
We designed the AVs with deployment in mind, ensuring that they can
operate using only basic sensor information about themselves and the
vehicle in front. The observations consist of the AV‚Äôs speed, the speed
of the leading vehicle, and the space gap between them. Given these
inputs, the RL agent then prescribes either an instantaneous
acceleration or a desired speed for the AV. The key advantage of using
only these local measurements is that the RL controllers can be deployed
on most modern vehicles in a decentralized way, without requiring
additional infrastructure.
</p>
<h3 id="reward-design">
Reward design
</h3>
<p>
The most challenging part is designing a reward function that, when
maximized, aligns with the different objectives that we desire the AVs
to achieve:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Wave smoothing:</strong> Reduce stop-and-go oscillations.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Energy efficiency:</strong> Lower fuel consumption for all
vehicles, not just AVs.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Safety:</strong> Ensure reasonable following distances and avoid
abrupt braking.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Driving comfort:</strong> Avoid aggressive accelerations and
decelerations.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Adherence to human driving norms:</strong> Ensure a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù
driving behavior that doesn‚Äôt make surrounding drivers uncomfortable.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Balancing these objectives together is difficult, as suitable
coefficients for each term must be found. For instance, if minimizing
fuel consumption dominates the reward, RL AVs learn to come to a stop in
the middle of the highway because that is energy optimal. To prevent
this, we introduced dynamic minimum and maximum gap thresholds to ensure
safe and reasonable behavior while optimizing fuel efficiency. We also
penalized the fuel consumption of human-driven vehicles behind the AV to
discourage it from learning a selfish behavior that optimizes energy
savings for the AV at the expense of surrounding traffic. Overall, we
aim to strike a balance between energy savings and having a reasonable
and safe driving behavior.

<br /> <i>Illustration of the dynamic minimum and maximum gap
thresholds, within which the AV can operate freely to smooth traffic as
efficiently as possible.</i>
</p>
<p>
The typical behavior learned by the AVs is to maintain slightly larger
gaps than human drivers, allowing them to absorb upcoming, possibly
abrupt, traffic slowdowns more effectively. In simulation, this approach
resulted in significant fuel savings of up to 20% across all road users
in the most congested scenarios, with fewer than 5% of AVs on the road.
And these AVs don‚Äôt have to be special vehicles! They can simply be
standard consumer cars equipped with a smart adaptive cruise control
(ACC), which is what we tested at scale.

</p>
<p>
Given the promising simulation results, the natural next step was to
bridge the gap from simulation to the highway. We took the trained RL
controllers and deployed them on 100 vehicles on the I-24 during peak
traffic hours over several days. This large-scale experiment, which we
called the MegaVanderTest, is the largest mixed-autonomy
traffic-smoothing experiment ever conducted.
</p>
<p>
Before deploying RL controllers in the field, we trained and evaluated
them extensively in simulation and validated them on the hardware.
Overall, the steps towards deployment involved:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Training in data-driven simulations:</strong> We used highway
traffic data from I-24 to create a training environment with realistic
wave dynamics, then validate the trained agent‚Äôs performance and
robustness in a variety of new traffic scenarios.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Deployment on hardware:</strong> After being validated in
robotics software, the trained controller is uploaded onto the car and
is able to control the set speed of the vehicle. We operate through the
vehicle‚Äôs on-board cruise control, which acts as a lower-level safety
controller.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Modular control framework:</strong> One key challenge during the
test was not having access to the leading vehicle information sensors.
To overcome this, the RL controller was integrated into a hierarchical
system, the MegaController, which combines a speed planner guide that
accounts for downstream traffic conditions, with the RL controller as
the final decision maker.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Validation on hardware:</strong> The RL agents were designed to
operate in an environment where most vehicles were human-driven,
requiring robust policies that adapt to unpredictable behavior. We
verify this by driving the RL-controlled vehicles on the road under
careful human supervision, making changes to the control based on
feedback.
</li>
</ul>

&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
<p>
Once validated, the RL controllers were deployed on 100 cars and driven
on I-24 during morning rush hour. Surrounding traffic was unaware of the
experiment, ensuring unbiased driver behavior. Data was collected during
the experiment from dozens of overhead cameras placed along the highway,
which led to the extraction of millions of individual vehicle
trajectories through a computer vision pipeline. Metrics computed on
these trajectories indicate a trend of reduced fuel consumption around
AVs, as expected from simulation results and previous smaller validation
deployments. For instance, we can observe that the closer people are
driving behind our AVs, the less fuel they appear to consume on average
(which is calculated using a calibrated energy model):
</p>
<p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 0;">
<img src="https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/rl_av_smoothing/fuel_data.png" width="80%" />
<br /> <i>Average fuel consumption as a function of distance behind the
nearest engaged RL-controlled AV in the downstream traffic. As human
drivers get further away behind AVs, their average fuel consumption
increases.</i>
</p>
<p>
Another way to measure the impact is to measure the variance of the
speeds and accelerations: the lower the variance, the less amplitude the
waves should have, which is what we observe from the field test data.
Overall, although getting precise measurements from a large amount of
camera video data is complicated, we observe a trend of 15 to 20% of
energy savings around our controlled cars.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 0;">
<img src="https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/rl_av_smoothing/data_scatter.png" width="50%" />
<br /> <i>Data points from all vehicles on the highway over a single day
of the experiment, plotted in speed-acceleration space. The cluster to
the left of the red line represents congestion, while the one on the
right corresponds to free flow. We observe that the congestion cluster
is smaller when AVs are present, as measured by computing the area of a
soft convex envelope or by fitting a Gaussian kernel.</i>
</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">
Final thoughts
</h2>
<p>
The 100-car field operational test was decentralized, with no explicit
cooperation or communication between AVs, reflective of current autonomy
deployment, and bringing us one step closer to smoother, more
energy-efficient highways. Yet, there is still vast potential for
improvement. Scaling up simulations to be faster and more accurate with
better human-driving models is crucial for bridging the
simulation-to-reality gap. Equipping AVs with additional traffic data,
whether through advanced sensors or centralized planning, could further
improve the performance of the controllers. For instance, while
multi-agent RL is promising for improving cooperative control
strategies, it remains an open question how enabling explicit
communication between AVs over 5G networks could further improve
stability and further mitigate stop-and-go waves. Crucially, our
controllers integrate seamlessly with existing adaptive cruise control
(ACC) systems, making field deployment feasible at scale. The more
vehicles equipped with smart traffic-smoothing control, the fewer waves
we‚Äôll see on our roads, meaning less pollution and fuel savings for
everyone!

<p>
<strong><a href="https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper/releases/tag/1.8">shot-scraper
1.8</a></strong>
</p>
I‚Äôve added a new feature to
<a href="https://shot-scraper.datasette.io/">shot-scraper</a> that makes
it easier to share scripts for other people to use with the
<a href="">shot-scraper javascript</a> command.
</p>
<p>
<code>shot-scraper javascript</code> lets you load up a web page in an
invisible Chrome browser (via Playwright), execute some JavaScript
against that page and output the results to your terminal. It‚Äôs a fun
way of running complex screen-scraping routines as part of a terminal
session, or even chained together with other commands using pipes.
</p>
<p>
The <code>-i/‚Äìinput</code> option lets you load that JavaScript from a
file on disk - but now you can also use a <code>gh:</code> prefix to
specify loading code from GitHub instead.
</p>
<p>
To quote
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper/releases/tag/1.8">the
release notes</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>shot-scraper javascript</code> can now optionally
<a href="https://shot-scraper.datasette.io/en/stable/javascript.html#running-javascript-from-github">load
scripts hosted on GitHub</a> via the new <code>gh:</code> prefix to the
<code>shot-scraper javascript -i/‚Äìinput</code> option.
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper/issues/173">#173</a>
</p>
<p>
Scripts can be referenced as
<code>gh:username/repo/path/to/script.js</code> or, if the GitHub user
has created a dedicated <code>shot-scraper-scripts</code> repository and
placed scripts in the root of it, using
<code>gh:username/name-of-script</code>.
</p>
<p>
For example, to run this
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper-scripts/blob/main/readability.js">readability.js</a>
script against any web page you can use the following:
</p>
<pre><code>shot-scraper javascript --input gh:simonw/readability \
  https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/24/qwen25-vl-32b/
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The

<p>
<strong><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp">microsoft/playwright-mcp</a></strong>
</p>
The Playwright team at Microsoft have released an MCP
(<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp">Model Context
Protocol</a>) server wrapping Playwright, and it‚Äôs pretty fascinating.
</p>
<p>
They implemented it on top of the Chrome accessibility tree, so MCP
clients (such as the Claude Desktop app) can use it to drive an
automated browser and use the accessibility tree to read and navigate
pages that they visit.
</p>
<p>
Trying it out is quite easy if you have Claude Desktop and Node.js
installed already. Edit your <code>claude_desktop_config.json</code>
file:
</p>
<pre><code>code ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
</code></pre>
<p>
And add this:
</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-json">
<pre>{
  <span class="pl-ent">"mcpServers"</span>: {
    <span class="pl-ent">"playwright"</span>: {
      <span class="pl-ent">"command"</span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>npx<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>,
      <span class="pl-ent">"args"</span>: [
        <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>@playwright/mcp@latest<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>
      ]
    }
  }
}</pre>
</div>
<p>
Now when you launch Claude Desktop various new browser automation tools
will be available to it, and you can tell Claude to navigate to a
website and interact with it.
</p>
<p>
<img alt="Screenshot of Claude interface showing a conversation about Datasette. The interface shows Claude responding to a user (SW) after navigating to datasette.io. Claude's response includes page details (URL: https://datasette.io/, Title: Datasette: An open source multi-tool for exploring and publishing data) and a summary of what's visible on the site: a description of Datasette as an open-source tool for exploring and publishing data, the tagline &quot;Find stories in data&quot;, navigation options, and features including exploratory data analysis, instant data publishing, and rapid prototyping." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/claude-playwright.jpg" />
</p>
<p>
I ran the following to get a list of the available tools:
</p>
<pre><code>cd /tmp
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp

<p>date: 2025-03-25, from: Marginallia log</p>
<p>I‚Äôm happy and grateful to announce that the Marginalia Search project
has been accepted for a second nlnet grant. All the details are not yet
finalized, but tentatively the grant will go toward addressing most of
the items in the project roadmap for 2025. I‚Äôve already been working
full time on the project since summer 2023, and this grant secures
additional development time, and extends the runway to a comfortable
degree.</p>

Lighter</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-24, updated: 2025-03-24, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-vl-32b/">Qwen2.5-VL-32B:
Smarter and Lighter</a></strong>
</p>
The second big open weight LLM release from China today - the first
being <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/24/deepseek/">DeepSeek
v3-0324</a>.
</p>
<p>
Qwen‚Äôs previous vision model was Qwen2.5 VL,
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/27/qwen25-vl-qwen25-vl-qwen25-vl/">released
in January</a> in 3B, 7B and 72B sizes.
</p>
<p>
Today‚Äôs Apache 2.0 licensed release is a 32B model, which is quickly
becoming my personal favourite model size - large enough to have
GPT-4-class capabilities, but small enough that on my 64GB Mac there‚Äôs
still enough RAM for me to run other memory-hungry applications like
Firefox and VS Code.
</p>
<p>
Qwen claim that the new model (when compared to their previous 2.5 VL
family) can ‚Äúalign more closely with human preferences‚Äù, is better at
‚Äúmathematical reasoning‚Äù and provides ‚Äúenhanced accuracy and detailed
analysis in tasks such as image parsing, content recognition, and visual
logic deduction‚Äù.
</p>
<p>
They also offer some presumably carefully selected benchmark results
showing it out-performing Gemma 3-27B, Mistral Small 3.1 24B and
GPT-4o-0513 (there have been two more recent GPT-4o releases since that
one, 2024-08-16 and 2024-11-20).
</p>
<p>
As usual, Prince Canuma had MLX versions of the models live within hours
of the release, in
<a href="https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct-4bit">4
bit</a>,
<a href="https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct-6bit">6
bit</a>,
<a href="https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct-8bit">8
bit</a>, and
<a href="https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct-bf16">bf16</a>
variants.
</p>
<p>
I ran the 4bit version (a 18GB model download) using <code>uv</code> and
Prince‚Äôs <a href="https://github.com/Blaizzy/mlx-vlm">mlx-vlm</a> like
this:
</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell">
<pre>uv run --with <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>numpy&lt;2<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span> --with mlx-vlm \
  python -m mlx_vlm.generate \
    --model mlx-community/Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct-4bit \
    --max-tokens 1000 \
    --temperature 0.0 \
    --prompt <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>Describe this image.<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span> \
    --image Mpaboundrycdfw-1.png</pre>
</div>
<p>
Here‚Äôs the image:
</p>
<p>
<img alt="A map image, described below" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/Mpaboundrycdfw-1.png" />
</p>
<p>
And here‚Äôs the resulting description, which I found to be <em>very</em>
impressive:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
This image appears to be a map highlighting specific areas along the
coastline, likely in California, based on the geographical features and
place names. Here is a detailed description of the image:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Geographic Features</strong>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The map shows a section of the coastline, with land on the right and the
sea on the left.
</li>
<li>
The land area includes parts of SanMateo County, as noted in the
top-right corner.
</li>
<li>
The coastline features several named locations, including:
<ul>

<strong>Point Montara</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Pillar Point</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Kings Rock</strong>
</li>
<li>

The map contains two distinct areas marked with different colors:
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Red Area (Top Section)</strong>
<ul>
<li>
Labeled as ‚ÄúMONTARA‚Äù and ‚ÄúMONTARA M R‚Äù (possibly referring to a ‚ÄúMarine
Reserves‚Äù or similar protected area).
</li>
<li>
This area is marked with a dark red color and extends from the coastline
inland.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Blue Area (Bottom Section)</strong>

<li>
Labeled as ‚ÄúPILLAR‚Äù and ‚ÄúPILLAR P O I N T‚Äù along with ‚ÄúSMCA‚Äù (Special
Management Area).
</li>
<li>
This area is marked with a blue color and is located closer to the
coastline, including the area around ‚ÄúPillar Point.‚Äù
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Depth Contours</strong>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The map includes depth markings in the sea, indicating the bathymetrical
features:
<ul>
<li>
<strong>20 fathom (fm) line</strong> is marked in the upper-left part of
the sea.
</li>
<li>
<strong>10 fathom (fm) line</strong> is marked closer to the coastline.
</li>
<li>
<strong>30 fathom (fm) line</strong> is marked further out to sea.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Other Features</strong>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>State Beach</strong>: Marked near the top-right, indicating a
protected recreational area.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Kings Rock</strong>: A prominent feature near the coastline,
likely a rocky outcropping.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Creeks</strong>: The map shows several creeks, including
<strong>VicenteCreek</strong> and <strong>DennistonCreek</strong>, which
flow into the sea.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Protected Areas</strong>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The map highlights specific protected areas:
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Marine Reserves</strong>:
<ul>
<li>
‚ÄúMONTARA M R‚Äù (Marine Reserves) in red.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Special Management Area (SMCA)</strong>
<ul>
<li>
‚ÄúPILLAR P O I N T‚Äù in blue, indicating a Special Management Area.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Grid and Coordinates</strong>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The map includes a grid with latitude and longitude markings:
<ul>
<li>
Latitude ranges from approximately 37¬∞25‚ÄôN to 37¬∞35‚ÄôN.
</li>
<li>
Longitude ranges from approximately 122¬∞22.5‚ÄôW to 122¬∞35.5‚ÄôW.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Topography</strong>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The land area shows topographic features, including elevations and
vegetation, with green areas indicating higher elevations or vegetated
land.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Other Labels</strong>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>‚ÄúSMR‚Äù</strong>: Likely stands for ‚ÄúState Managed Reserves.‚Äù
</li>
<li>
<strong>‚ÄúSMCA‚Äù</strong>: Likely stands for ‚ÄúSpecial Management Control
Area.‚Äù
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
In summary, this map highlights specific protected areas along the
coastline, including a red ‚ÄúMarine Reserves‚Äù area and a blue ‚ÄúSpecial
Management Area‚Äù near ‚ÄúPillar Point.‚Äù The map also includes depth
markings, geographical features, and place names, providing a detailed
view of the region‚Äôs natural and protected areas.

(including displays, graphics drivers, USB and wireless ports, and
cameras), there are others that have long been considered [‚Ä¶]

<h2 id="deepseek-aideepseek-v3-0324">deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3-0324</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-24, updated: 2025-03-24, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3-0324">deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3-0324</a></strong>
</p>
Chinese AI lab DeepSeek just released the latest version of their
enormous DeepSeek v3 model, baking the release date into the name
<code>DeepSeek-V3-0324</code>.
</p>
<p>
The license is MIT (that‚Äôs new - previous DeepSeek v3 had a custom
license), the README is empty and the release adds up a to a total of
641 GB of files, mostly of the form
<code>model-00035-of-000163.safetensors</code>.
</p>
<p>
The model only came out a few hours ago and MLX developer Awni Hannun
already
<a href="https://twitter.com/awnihannun/status/1904177084609827054">has
it running</a> at &gt;20 tokens/second on a 512GB M3 Ultra Mac Studio
($9,499 of ostensibly consumer-grade hardware) via
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/mlx-lm/">mlx-lm</a> and this
<a href="https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/DeepSeek-V3-0324-4bit">mlx-community/DeepSeek-V3-0324-4bit</a>
4bit quantization, which reduces the on-disk size to 352 GB.
</p>
<p>
I think that means if you have that machine you can run it with my
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-mlx">llm-mlx</a> plugin like
this, but I‚Äôve not tried myself!
</p>
<pre><code>llm mlx download-model mlx-community/DeepSeek-V3-0324-4bit
llm chat -m mlx-community/DeepSeek-V3-0324-4bit
</code></pre>
<p>
The new model is also
<a href="https://openrouter.ai/deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free">listed
on OpenRouter</a>. You can try a chat at
<a href="https://openrouter.ai/chat?models=deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free">openrouter.ai/chat?models=deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free</a>.
</p>
<p>
Here‚Äôs what the chat interface
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/3ce2bf5836743dfaf07d994578b261ba">gave
me</a> for ‚ÄúGenerate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle‚Äù:
</p>
<p>
<img alt="There's a pelican, and a bicycle, but both of them look disassembled." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/deepseek-v3-pelican.jpg" />
</p>
<p>
I have two API keys with OpenRouter - one of them worked with the model,
the other gave me a <code>No endpoints found matching your data
policy</code> error - I think because I had a setting on that key
disallowing models from training on my activity. The key that worked was
a free key with no attached billing credentials.
</p>
<p>
For my working API key the
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-openrouter">llm-openrouter</a>
plugin let me run a prompt like this:
</p>
<pre><code>llm install llm-openrouter
llm keys set openrouter
# Paste key here
llm -m openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free "best fact about a pelican"
</code></pre>
<p>
Here‚Äôs that ‚Äúbest fact‚Äù - the terminal output included Markdown and an
emoji combo, here that‚Äôs rendered.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
One of the most fascinating facts about pelicans is their <strong>unique
throat pouch</strong>, called a <strong>gular sac</strong>, which can
hold up to <strong>3 gallons (11 liters) of water</strong>‚Äîthree times
more than their stomach!
</p>
<p>
Here‚Äôs why it‚Äôs amazing:<br /> - <strong>Fishing Tool</strong>: They use
it like a net to scoop up fish, then drain the water before
swallowing.<br /> - <strong>Cooling Mechanism</strong>: On hot days,
pelicans flutter the pouch to stay cool by evaporating water.<br /> -
<strong>Built-in ‚ÄúShopping Cart‚Äù</strong>: Some species even use it to
carry food back to their chicks.
</p>
<p>
Bonus fact: Pelicans often <strong>fish cooperatively</strong>, herding
fish into shallow water for an easy catch.
</p>
<p>
Would you like more cool pelican facts? üê¶üåä

<p>
In putting this post together I

tool</a> for finding the total on-disk size of a Hugging Face
repository, which is available in their API but not currently displayed
on their website.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Update</strong>: Here‚Äôs a notable independent benchmark
<a href="https://twitter.com/paulgauthier/status/1904304052500148423">from
Paul Gauthier</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
DeepSeek‚Äôs new V3 scored 55% on aider‚Äôs
<a href="https://aider.chat/docs/leaderboards/">polyglot benchmark</a>,
significantly improving over the prior version. It‚Äôs the #2
non-thinking/reasoning model, behind only Sonnet 3.7. V3 is competitive
with thinking models like R1 &amp; o3-mini.

<h2 id="newsboat-2.39-is-out">Newsboat 2.39 is out</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-23, updated: 2025-03-23, from: Newsboat News</p>
<pre><code>        &lt;p&gt;
            The new key-binding system mentioned in the previous entry is
            finally here! After years of work, done primarily by Dennis van
            der Schagt, we now have a &lt;code&gt;bind&lt;/code&gt; command that:

            &lt;ul&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                    can create multi-key bindings, i.e. one can bind not
                    just single letters (with Control or Shift), but also
                    sequences of letters (each with their own modifiers);
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                    allows each binding to execute multiple actions, just
                    like our existing &lt;code&gt;macro&lt;/code&gt; command. Unlike macros,
                    &lt;code&gt;bind&lt;/code&gt; doesn&#39;t require a &quot;macro prefix&quot;,
                        so one can finally bind a sequence of operations
                        to a &lt;emph&gt;single&lt;/emph&gt; key;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                    allows adding documentation strings to each binding,
                    which are then shown in the help dialog. This again is
                    an improvement upon macros, which had no descriptions and
                    didn&#39;t have a way for the user to provide their own;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                    adds alternative syntax for keys. Instead of the usual
                    &lt;code&gt;^R&lt;/code&gt; syntax, one can now use
                    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;C-r&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; a la Tmux or Emacs. Hopefully
                    this makes multi-key bindings easier to read.
                &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            The feature is very new, and probably contains bugs. Please
            report them! In fact, it&#39;s so new that we didn&#39;t have time to
            finish the corresponding &lt;code&gt;unbind&lt;/code&gt; command LOL.
            However, since Newsboat doesn&#39;t have any multi-key bindings
            by default, &lt;code&gt;unbind&lt;/code&gt; was deemed to not be a release blocker.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            The new feature also has a limitation in that multi-key bindings
            that have the same prefix must have the same length. In other
            words, it&#39;s fine to have &lt;code&gt;abc&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;abx&lt;/code&gt;
            bound simultaneously, but it&#39;s not possible to bind both
            &lt;code&gt;ab&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;abc&lt;/code&gt; at the same time.
            This is to avoid an ambiguity when the prefix is typed;
            in that case Newsboat would have to decide somehow
            if the next key is going to be &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            We are all very proud of this feature, and eagerly awaiting your
            feedback! Please try it, and open an issue if something doesn&#39;t
            work or could be improved.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            One more thing: we now require a compiler that accepts
            &lt;code&gt;-std=c++17&lt;/code&gt; flag. In other words, we dropped Clang 4
            support. This is due to libicu 75 requiring C++17; we depend on
            this library via libxml2, and the requirement bleeds through to
            us because we&#39;re indirectly including some of libicu header files.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Compilers without C++17 support are now considered deprecated.
            Future Newsboat releases will probably use some of C++17 features,
            at which point we&#39;ll drop support. If that&#39;s going to create
            problems for you, please file an issue.

Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/SemanticDiffusion.html">Semantic
Diffusion</a></strong>
</p>
I
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mattchughes.ca/post/3ll2sbdky3k2y">learned
about</a> this term today while complaining about how the definition of
‚Äúvibe coding‚Äù is already being distorted to mean ‚Äúany time an LLM writes
code‚Äù as opposed to
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/19/vibe-coding/">the
intended meaning</a> of ‚Äúcode I wrote with an LLM without even reviewing
what it wrote‚Äù.
</p>
<p>
I posted
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/simonwillison.net/post/3ll2rtxeucs2e">this
salty note</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Feels like I‚Äôm losing the battle on this one, I keep seeing people use
‚Äúvibe coding‚Äù to mean any time an LLM is used to write code
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm particularly frustrated because for a few glorious moments we had
the chance at having ONE piece of AI-related terminology with a clear,
widely accepted definition!
</p>
<p>
But it turns out people couldn‚Äôt be trusted to read all the way to the
end of Andrej‚Äôs tweet, so now we are back to yet another term where
different people assume it means different things
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Martin Fowler coined Semantic Diffusion in 2006 with this very clear
definition:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Semantic diffusion occurs when you have a word that is coined by a
person or group, often with a pretty good definition, but then gets
spread through the wider community in a way that weakens that
definition. This weakening risks losing the definition entirely - and
with it any usefulness to the term.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
What‚Äôs happening with vibe coding right now is such a clear example of
this effect in action! I‚Äôve seen
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Mar/5/prompt-injection-jailbreaking/">the
same thing happen</a> to my own coinage
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Sep/12/prompt-injection/">prompt
injection</a> over the past couple of years.
</p>
<p>
This kind of dillution of meaning is frustrating, but does appear to be
inevitable. As Martin Fowler points out it‚Äôs most likely to happen to
popular terms - the more popular a term is the higher the chance a game
of telephone will ensue where misunderstandings flourish as the chain
continues to grow.
</p>
<p>
Andrej Karpathy, who
<a href="https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383">coined</a>
vibe coding,
<a href="https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1903870973126045712">posted
this</a> just now in reply to my
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/19/vibe-coding/">article</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Good post! It will take some time to settle on definitions. Personally I
use ‚Äúvibe coding‚Äù when I feel like this dog. My iOS app last night being
a good example. But I find that in practice I rarely go full out vibe
coding, and more often I still look at the code, I add complexity slowly
and I try to learn over time how the pieces work, to ask clarifying
questions etc.

<p>I love that vibe coding has an official illustrative GIF now!</p>

<p>
This was part of Next.js internals used to help avoid applying
middleware recursively to requests that are re-dispatched through the
framework.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately it also meant that attackers could send a
<code>x-middleware-subrequest</code> HTTP header with a colon-separated
list of middleware names to skip. If a site used middleware to apply an
authentication gate (as suggested
<a href="https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app/adding-authentication#protecting-your-routes-with-nextjs-middleware">in
the Next.js documentation</a>) an attacker could bypass that
authentication using this trick.
</p>
<p>
<p>The vulnerability has been fixed in Next.js 15.2.3 - here‚Äôs the

<blockquote cite="https://jacobian.org/2025/mar/13/beware-advice-from-old-heads/">
<p>
If you‚Äôre new to tech, taking [career] advice on what works for someone
with a 20-year career is likely to be about as effective as taking
career advice from a stockbroker or firefighter or nurse. There‚Äôll be a
few things that generalize, but most advice won‚Äôt.
</p>
<p>
Further, even advice people with long careers on what worked for them
when <em>they</em> were getting started is unlikely to be advice that
works today. The tech industry of 15 or 20 years ago was, again,
<strong>dramatically</strong> different from tech today.
