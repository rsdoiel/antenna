<h2 id="newsboat-2.39-is-out">Newsboat 2.39 is out</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-23, updated: 2025-03-23, from: Newsboat News</p>
<pre><code>        &lt;p&gt;
            The new key-binding system mentioned in the previous entry is
            finally here! After years of work, done primarily by Dennis van
            der Schagt, we now have a &lt;code&gt;bind&lt;/code&gt; command that:

            &lt;ul&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                    can create multi-key bindings, i.e. one can bind not
                    just single letters (with Control or Shift), but also
                    sequences of letters (each with their own modifiers);
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                    allows each binding to execute multiple actions, just
                    like our existing &lt;code&gt;macro&lt;/code&gt; command. Unlike macros,
                    &lt;code&gt;bind&lt;/code&gt; doesn&#39;t require a &quot;macro prefix&quot;,
                        so one can finally bind a sequence of operations
                        to a &lt;emph&gt;single&lt;/emph&gt; key;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                    allows adding documentation strings to each binding,
                    which are then shown in the help dialog. This again is
                    an improvement upon macros, which had no descriptions and
                    didn&#39;t have a way for the user to provide their own;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                    adds alternative syntax for keys. Instead of the usual
                    &lt;code&gt;^R&lt;/code&gt; syntax, one can now use
                    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;C-r&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; a la Tmux or Emacs. Hopefully
                    this makes multi-key bindings easier to read.
                &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            The feature is very new, and probably contains bugs. Please
            report them! In fact, it&#39;s so new that we didn&#39;t have time to
            finish the corresponding &lt;code&gt;unbind&lt;/code&gt; command LOL.
            However, since Newsboat doesn&#39;t have any multi-key bindings
            by default, &lt;code&gt;unbind&lt;/code&gt; was deemed to not be a release blocker.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            The new feature also has a limitation in that multi-key bindings
            that have the same prefix must have the same length. In other
            words, it&#39;s fine to have &lt;code&gt;abc&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;abx&lt;/code&gt;
            bound simultaneously, but it&#39;s not possible to bind both
            &lt;code&gt;ab&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;abc&lt;/code&gt; at the same time.
            This is to avoid an ambiguity when the prefix is typed;
            in that case Newsboat would have to decide somehow
            if the next key is going to be &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            We are all very proud of this feature, and eagerly awaiting your
            feedback! Please try it, and open an issue if something doesn&#39;t
            work or could be improved.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            One more thing: we now require a compiler that accepts
            &lt;code&gt;-std=c++17&lt;/code&gt; flag. In other words, we dropped Clang 4
            support. This is due to libicu 75 requiring C++17; we depend on
            this library via libxml2, and the requirement bleeds through to
            us because we&#39;re indirectly including some of libicu header files.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Compilers without C++17 support are now considered deprecated.
            Future Newsboat releases will probably use some of C++17 features,
            at which point we&#39;ll drop support. If that&#39;s going to create
            problems for you, please file an issue.

<h2 id="semantic-diffusion">Semantic Diffusion</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-23, updated: 2025-03-23, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/SemanticDiffusion.html">Semantic
Diffusion</a></strong>
</p>
I
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mattchughes.ca/post/3ll2sbdky3k2y">learned
about</a> this term today while complaining about how the definition of
“vibe coding” is already being distorted to mean “any time an LLM writes
code” as opposed to
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/19/vibe-coding/">the
intended meaning</a> of “code I wrote with an LLM without even reviewing
what it wrote”.
</p>
<p>
I posted
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/simonwillison.net/post/3ll2rtxeucs2e">this
salty note</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Feels like I’m losing the battle on this one, I keep seeing people use
“vibe coding” to mean any time an LLM is used to write code
</p>
<p>
I’m particularly frustrated because for a few glorious moments we had
the chance at having ONE piece of AI-related terminology with a clear,
widely accepted definition!
</p>
<p>
But it turns out people couldn’t be trusted to read all the way to the
end of Andrej’s tweet, so now we are back to yet another term where
different people assume it means different things
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Martin Fowler coined Semantic Diffusion in 2006 with this very clear
definition:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Semantic diffusion occurs when you have a word that is coined by a
person or group, often with a pretty good definition, but then gets
spread through the wider community in a way that weakens that
definition. This weakening risks losing the definition entirely - and
with it any usefulness to the term.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
What’s happening with vibe coding right now is such a clear example of
this effect in action! I’ve seen
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Mar/5/prompt-injection-jailbreaking/">the
same thing happen</a> to my own coinage
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Sep/12/prompt-injection/">prompt
injection</a> over the past couple of years.
</p>
<p>
This kind of dillution of meaning is frustrating, but does appear to be
inevitable. As Martin Fowler points out it’s most likely to happen to
popular terms - the more popular a term is the higher the chance a game
of telephone will ensue where misunderstandings flourish as the chain
continues to grow.
</p>
<p>
Andrej Karpathy, who
<a href="https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383">coined</a>
vibe coding,
<a href="https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1903870973126045712">posted
this</a> just now in reply to my
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/19/vibe-coding/">article</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Good post! It will take some time to settle on definitions. Personally I
use “vibe coding” when I feel like this dog. My iOS app last night being
a good example. But I find that in practice I rarely go full out vibe
coding, and more often I still look at the code, I add complexity slowly
and I try to learn over time how the pieces work, to ask clarifying
questions etc.

<p>
This was part of Next.js internals used to help avoid applying
middleware recursively to requests that are re-dispatched through the
framework.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately it also meant that attackers could send a
<code>x-middleware-subrequest</code> HTTP header with a colon-separated
list of middleware names to skip. If a site used middleware to apply an
authentication gate (as suggested
<a href="https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app/adding-authentication#protecting-your-routes-with-nextjs-middleware">in
the Next.js documentation</a>) an attacker could bypass that
authentication using this trick.
</p>
<p>
<p>The vulnerability has been fixed in Next.js 15.2.3 - here’s the
<a href="https://nextjs.org/blog/cve-2025-29927">official release
announcement</a> talking about the problem.</p>

<p>DOGE claimed they’d fix government inefficiency, but so far, they’ve
only broken it more. 🤷‍♂️ Firing workers ≠ fixing processes. If the people
suffer either way, is this really a solution?</p>

<p>
If you’re new to tech, taking [career] advice on what works for someone
with a 20-year career is likely to be about as effective as taking
career advice from a stockbroker or firefighter or nurse. There’ll be a
few things that generalize, but most advice won’t.
</p>
<p>
Further, even advice people with long careers on what worked for them
when <em>they</em> were getting started is unlikely to be advice that
works today. The tech industry of 15 or 20 years ago was, again,
<strong>dramatically</strong> different from tech today.
