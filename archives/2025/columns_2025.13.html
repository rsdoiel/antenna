“<a href="https://www.schneier.com/academic/archives/2025/03/rational-astrologies-and-security.html">Rational
Astrologies and Security</a>“:

<blockquote>
<p>
There is another non-security way that designers can spend their
security budget: on making their own lives easier. Many of these fall
into the category of what has been called rational astrology. First

despite substantial evidence that it does not…

I typically don’t do anything for April Fool’s Day, but this year I
thought I’d unite a bit of a meme in the homelab community with
something I wanted to make a video on anyway: a <em>lamp rack</em>.
</p>
<p>
What’s a lamp rack? Well, you’re looking at one! It’s a floor lamp with
an integrated <a href="https://mini-rack.jeffgeerling.com">mini

<p>
I didn’t want to make a video about a floor lamp, but more on the fact
you don’t <em>need</em> fancy racks or any new hardware at <em>all</em>
to start a homelab.

Border Crossings</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-01, updated: 2025-03-30, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
I have heard stories of more aggressive interrogation of electronic
devices at US border crossings. I know a lot about securing computers,
but very little about securing phones.
</p>
<p>
Are there easy ways to delete data—files, photos, etc.—on phones so it
can’t be recovered? Does resetting a phone to factory defaults erase
data, or is it still recoverable? That is, does the reset erase the old
encryption key, or just sever the password that access that key? When
the phone is rebooted, are deleted files still available?
</p>
<p>
We need answers for both iPhones and Android phones. And it’s not just
the US; the world is going to become a more dangerous place to oppose
state power…

There’s a point of view reflected in its creations, looking into a soul

<p>My server has been coughing up hairballs tonight. It coughed up a
link to <a href="http://scripting.com/2023/02/02/133127.html">this
piece</a> from two years ago, when Twitter pulled the plug on their API.
It knocked everything I had built on the Twitter API off the air. Every
thing. Just like that. That’s what tonight was like here. It was just
some of my apps, suddenly, not working. Whew.</p>

<h2 id="dont-visit-the-usa">2025-03-30 Don’t visit the USA</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-31, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2025-03-30-don-t-visit-the-usa">
2025-03-30 Don’t visit the USA
</h1>
<p>
When people talk about minimal laptop installs, burner phones, and the
mess of US border crossings, I wonder where they habe been the last
twenty years. A dude from work flew to the states to work for HP as a
student, got turned back at the airport and put on a flight back. He got
to make one family call, his dad called HP, they called some lawyers and
by the time they go there he was already on a plane. And those were the
good days, before 9/11, Homeland Security and all that.
</p>
<p>
Have you seen the forms they have you sign on the Visa Waiver program?
The border agents have total discretion over you. Those are not
“passenger rights” but “small mercies”. And that was long before Trump.
It’s terrible fuckery now, but it wasn’t great before that. Not
travelling to the states? I’ve told people at the office that I won’t be
going to the states for work ever since 9/11. The last time I went
happily was, uh, when The Phantom Menace came out?
</p>
<p>
I went once more when my wife wanted to go to Hawaii. Somebody there
held my hand and prayed for me on a parking lot. Somebody there gave me
an ad for an underground firing range. I learned how the US treated the
locals. No, visiting the US was never an easy call to make. And those
were the good days.
</p>
<p>
And what about boycotting the US? It is with despair that I see my
employer buying more and more into Windows and Microsoft and Azure and
Amazon S3. Have they not learned anything from Snowden? American IT is
not to be trusted. I mean, it’s probably not be trusted anywhere, but
when give a choice, there is no reason to trust the USA. The agencies
can get all the information they want and hand out gag orders to prevent
the well-meaning corporations from warning you. From the outside, they
are just as bad as the rest of them. And they will use their power
against you. And Snowden was during the good years!
</p>
<p>
And yes, Fortress Europe is not great, either. Two things being not
great doesn’t make a right, though. The first step is to realise how bad
the situation is, how bad the situation has been.
</p>
<p>
And now the situation really is fucked up.
</p>
<p>
If you look at the attempts at regime change in recent years, I think
the lessons are obvious: It can only succeed with long, weekly mass
demonstrations, in broad coalitions.
</p>
<p>
The only way out of a corrupt government that controls access to jobs,
controls the institutions, controls most media is weekly protest. It
takes a long time to grow. You have to be there, every time. “Pumpaj!”
Keep the pressure up.
</p>
<p>
Join whatever protest is on this week.
</p>
<p>
I also think it is important to not conflate the man with the mob. Name
no names! Because it’s never just one person. If it looks like one
person then that person is the face man of the mob. The people that need
kicking are all those that got their jobs from the mob. All these greedy
incompetents whose only qualification is how far they can bend over.
</p>
<p>
Yeet them into the sun. Send them off to Mars. Whatever.
</p>
<p>
To think that Canadians or Greenlanders want to be part of the USA is
about as absurd to me as Taiwanese wanting to be part of mainland China
or Ukrainians wanting to be part of Russia. The only ones not getting it
are the sympathisers of the dread regimes in China, in Russia – and in
the USA.
</p>
<p>
<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23USA">#USA</a>
</p>
<p>
<strong>2025-03-31</strong>. I keep learning new things. This is from a
post about US politicians visiting Greenland.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Americans might chuckle at that idea, but such arrogance is unwarranted.
We are the only ones ever to have invoked Article 5, the mutual defense
obligation of the NATO treaty, after 9/11; and our European allies did
respond. Per capita more Danish soldiers were killed in the Afghan war
than were American soldiers … and of course defending against a Russian
attack is the NATO mission. But right now the United States is
supporting Russia in its war against Ukraine. No one is doing more to
contain the Russian threat than Ukraine. Indeed, Ukraine is in effect
fulfilling the entire NATO mission, right now, by absorbing a huge
Russian attack. … Denmark meanwhile has given more than four times as
much aid to Ukraine, per capita, as does the United States. … The US is
is 24th in the world in the happiness rankings. Not bad. But Denmark is
number two (after Finland). On a scale of 1 to 100, Freedom House ranks
Denmark 97 and the US 84 on freedom — and the US will drop a great deal
this year. An American is about ten times more likely to be incarcerated
than a Dane. Danes have access to universal and essentially free health
care; Americans spend a huge amount of money to be sick more often and
to be treated worse when they are. Danes on average live four years
longer than Americans. In Denmark university education is free; the
average balance owed by the tens of millions of Americans who hold
student debt in the US is about $40,000. Danish parents share a year of
paid parental leave. In the US, one parent might get twelve weeks of
unpaid leave. –

with a couple dressed in evening clothes with a NYC cop and off-duty
sanitation worker lurking in the background.
</p>
<p>
Paolo Valdemarin writes from London, “Have you tried adding more images
to a prompt? From my experiments it can easily keep ‘in mind’ five
different images and mix them. You can get a bunch of people sitting in
the same room, with a very detailed version of the room.” He sent two
examples which are somewhat embarrassing, but you’ll probably enjoy
them. :-)
</p>
<p>
First, he uploaded my profile picture from Facebook. And asked ChatGPT
to add me to the picture and then to “sit him next to the couple, with
both of them kissing him on the cheek, and as you can see ChatGPT
complied!

NSA</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-31, updated: 2025-03-30, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
US National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, who started the now-infamous
group chat coordinating a US attack against the Yemen-based Houthis on
March 15, is seemingly now suggesting that the secure messaging service
Signal has security vulnerabilities.
</p>
<p>
"I didn’t see this loser in the group,"
Waltz <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-admins-shifting-explanations-journalist-added-signal-chat/story?id=120179649">told</a> Fox
News about <em>Atlantic</em> editor in chief Jeffrey Goldberg, whom
Waltz <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/">invited</a> to

technical mean, is something we’re trying to figure out."

2025-03-28 Locarno Camellia park

<p>
It’s spring and we went there. Locarno is in the canton Ticino, in the
south of Switzerland, at the shores of Lago Maggiore (“big lake”) that
it shares with Italy.
</p>
<p>
They have a fantastic camellia park. In early spring, it’s the best
place to be.
</p>
<p>
I tried to take pictures with my trusty Olympus EP-5 and the 30mm 1:3.5
macro lens. Sadly, I have been untrained by the phone and was confused
by the settings and the tiny screen. Oh my! So this is mix of camera
pictures and phone pictures.

We went to see the private

of the Eisenhut gardening center in Gabarogno, across the lake and up
the hill from Locarno. They claim to have about a thousand camellia
variants and about six hundred magnolia variants. As we’ve been to the
<a href="2025-03-25-camellias">camellia park</a> yesterday, we focused
on the magnolia in bloom.

OPML</a> so it can be reproduced in lots of places. It will be hard to
shut down, if it catches on. The idea: deliver news stories, blog posts
and podcasts from sources with ideas and facts an informed person would
want. We hope we are helping the United States respond to threats to our
freedom, well-being, the rule of law, and our country’s friendships
around the world. As the depth of what’s happening is understood across
the country, I believe we may need more flexible sources of news. We use
mature tech that’s widely deployed, well-understood. And it is
completely and utterly one hundred percent billionaire-proof. We start
out today with two feeds,
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/factpostnews.bsky.social/post/3lfn5pghprs26">FactPost</a>
which is the official rapid response page of the Democratic Party, and
<a href="http://scripting.com/?tab=links">my linkblog feed</a>, so I can
easily test the system. The part that hooks up to Bluesky is relatively
new, so we’ll need to look at problems. As they say – <i>still
