Last night Viv and I took Indie to the Satsung that he likes to go to
with his mum. I dressed her in this cute onesie with dogs on it, and we
got so many, “Oh, so this is your darling son!”, “How handsome!” etc. 😑
News just in I guess – dogs are just for boys now! Girls keep away!! How
pathetic, right?

Mission accomplished! I waited so long to reset Gidget’s timed,
automated feeder for DST that I don’t have to any more 😎
</p>
<p>
That said, in the manner of non-internet-connected electronics, its
sense of time has slipped such that it runs nearly an hour behind the
real time (so in the opposite direction from DST)… good thing Gidget
can’t tell time.

that we aren’t having an emergency impeachment and trial to get him out
of there. That could actually restore a bit of confidence of the outside

has been for a long time. Maybe our

Trump weren’t so inept, eventually whoever you choose as the monarch,
they’re going to behave like this. Inevitable. We could have a

We could do it. I believe we could.</p>

<h2 id="aufsteigende-rüstungsklasse">2025-04-04 Aufsteigende
Rüstungsklasse</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-04, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2025-04-04-aufsteigende-rüstungsklasse">
2025-04-04 Aufsteigende Rüstungsklasse
</h1>
<p>
Ich hatte schon vor einiger Zeit angefangen, über einen Wechsel zur
aufsteigenden Rüstungsklasse nachzudenken. Neue Spieler fanden die
traditionelle, absteigende Rüstungsklasse meistens doof. Die Leute, mit
denen ich schon spielte, hatten sich an die absteigende Rüstungsklasse
gewöhnt und wollten nicht umsteigen. Was tun? Mir gefällt die
Absteigende Rüstungsklasse und die kleine Tabelle, wo man sich
aufschreibt, welche Rüstungsklasse welchen Wurf benötigt, oder die
seltsame Notation aus AD&amp;D Zeiten mit dem ETW0 (Engl. THAC0).
</p>
<p>
Irgendwann hatte ich mich halb durchgerungen, einen Versuch zu starten.
Positiv aufgefallen ist sofort, dass die Tabellen im Handbuch für die
Spielenden kompakter werden. Auf den Charakterbögen hat es nun auch
etwas mehr Platz. Beides finde ich sehr positiv.
</p>
<p>
Eher unangenehm war, dass in allen anderen Dokumenten immer noch
absteigende Rüstungsklassen zu finden war. Oje! Mit dem aktuellen Update
hoffe ich, sie alle gefunden zu haben. Und wer ansonsten eine
Rüstungsklasse unter 10 findet, konvertiert wie folgt:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Für Menschen ohne Rüstung wird RK 9 zu RK 10.
</li>
<li>
Für alle anderen ist die aufsteigende Rüstungsklasse = 20 minus die
absteigende Rüstungsklasse.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Beispielsweise: Ork mit RK 6 wird zu Ork mit RK 14.
</p>
<p>
Warum nicht “19 minus die absteigende Rüstungsklasse”? Nun ist alles um
eins besser geschützt, würde man meinen. Der Vorteil ist aber, dass es
nun zu neueren D&amp;D Versionen passt. Wenn ich beispielsweise bei
D&amp;D 3.5 reinschaue:
</p>
<p>
Krieger mit Stufe 1 hat einen Angriffsbonus von +1 (gleich wie die
Stufe, was mir sehr gefällt). Die Rüstungen sind: beschlagene
Lederrüstung 13 (20-7); Kettenpanzer 15 (20-5); Plattenpanzer 17 (20-3).
Aus dem Rahmen fällt “ohne Rüstung”, denn 10 ist nicht 20-9. Tja… Dafür
habe ich keine Lösung. RK 11 für Leute ohne Rüstung gefällt mir auch
nicht.
</p>
<p>
Und was ist mit den Trefferchancen? Vorher benötigte ein Krieger Stufe 1
eine 13 um einen Ork mit RK 6 zu treffen. Jetzt hat der Krieger einen
Bonus von +1 um eine Ork mit RK 14 (20-6) zu treffen und braucht also
immer noch eine 13. Insofern ist also alles gleich geblieben.

come Linux replaced Unix? What happened to proprietary Unix?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-04, from: Liam on Linux</p>
<p>
The personal histories involved are highly relevant and they are one of
the things that get forgotten in boring grey corporate histories.
</p>
<p>
Bill Gates didn’t get lucky: he got a leg up from mum &amp; dad, and was
nasty and rapacious and fast, and clawed his way to industry dominance.
On the way he climbed over Gary Kildall of Digital Research and largely
obliterated DR.<br /><br /> 
</p>
<p>
Ray Noorda of Novell was the big boss of the flourishing Mormon software
industry of Utah. (Another big Utah company was
WordPerfect.)<br /><br />Several of them were in the Canopy Group:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canopy_Group">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canopy_Group</a>
</p>
<p>
Ray Noorda owned the whole lot, via NFT Ventures Inc., which stood for
"Noorda Family Trust".
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Noorda">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Noorda</a>
</p>
<p>
Caldera acquired the Unix business from SCO, as my current employers
reported a quarter of a century ago:
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2000/08/02/caldera_goes_unix_with_sco/">https://www.theregister.com/2000/08/02/caldera_goes_unix_with_sco/</a>
</p>
<p>
Noorda managed to surf Gates’s and Microsoft’s wave. Novell made
servers, with their own proprietary OS, and workstations, with their own
OS, and the network. As Microsoft s/w on IBM-compatible PCs became
dominant, Novell strategically killed off first its workstations and
pivoted to cards for PCs and clients for DOS. Then it ported its server
OS to PC servers, and killed its server hardware. Then it was strong and
secure and safe for a while, growing fat on the booming PC business.
</p>
<p>
But Noorda knew damned well that Gates resented anyone else making good
money of DOS systems. In the late 1980s, when DR no longer mattered, MS
screwed IBM because IBM fumbled OS/2. MS got lucky with Windows 3.
</p>
<p>
MS help screw DEC and headhunted DEC’s head OS man Dave Cutler <em>and
his core team</em> and gave him the leftovers of the IBM divorce:
"Portable OS/2", the CPU-independent version. Cutler turned Portable
OS/2 into what he had planned to turn DEC VMS into: a cross-platform
Unix killer. It ended up being renamed "OS/2 NT" and then "Windows NT".
</p>
<p>
Noorda knew it was just a matter of time ’til MS had a Netware-killer.
He was right. So, he figured 2 things would help Novell adapt: embrace
the TCP/IP network standard, and Unix.
</p>
<p>
And Novell had cash.
</p>
<p>
So, Novell bought Unix and did a slightly Netwarified Unix: UnixWare.
</p>
<p>
He also spied that the free Unix clone Linux would be big and he spun
off a side-business to make a Linux-based Windows killer,
<a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/1094">codenamed
"Corsair"</a> – a fast-moving pirate ship.
</p>
<p>
Corsair became Caldera and Caldera OpenLinux. The early version was
expensive and had a proprietary desktop, but it also had a licensed
version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabi_(software">SUN
WABI</a>). Before WINE worked, Caldera OpenLinux could run Windows apps.
</p>
<p>
Caldera also bought the rump of DR so it also had a good solid DOS as
well: DR-DOS.
</p>
<p>
Then Caldera were the first corporate Linux to adopt the new FOSS
desktop, KDE. I got a copy of Caldera OpenLinux with KDE from them.
Without a commercial desktop it was both cheaper <em>and</em> better
than the earlier version. WABI couldn’t run much but it could run the
core apps of MS Office, which was what mattered.
</p>
<p>
So, low end workstation, Novell DOS; high end workstation, Caldera
OpenLinux (able to connect to Novell servers, and run DOS and Windows
apps); legacy servers, Netware; new open-standards app servers,
UnixWare.
</p>
<p>
Every level of the MS stack, Novell had an alternative. Server, network
protocol, network client/server, low end workstation, high end
workstation.
</p>
<p>
Well, it didn’t work out. Commercial Unix was dying; UnixWare flopped.
Linux was killing it. So Caldera snapped up the dying <em>PC</em> Unix
vendor, SCO, and renamed itself "SCO Group", and now that its corporate
ally, the also-Noorda-owned-and-backed Novell <em>owned</em> the Unix
source code, SCO Group tried to kill Linux by showing it was based on
stolen Unix code, and later when that failed, that it contained stolen
Unix code.
</p>
<p>
Caldera decided DOS wasn’t worth having and open sourced it. (I have a
physical copy from them.) Lots of people were interested. It realised
DOS <em>was</em> still worth money, reverse course and made the next
version non-FOSS again. It also offered me a job. I said no. I like
drinking beer. Utah is dry.
</p>
<p>
The whole sorry saga of the SCO Group and the Unix lawsuits was because
Ray Noorda wanted to outdo Bill Gates.
</p>
<p>
Sadly Noorda got Alzheimer’s. The managers who took over tried to back
away, but bits of Noorda’s extended empire started attacking things
which other bits had been trying to exploit. It also shows the danger
and power of names.
</p>
<p>
Now the vague recollection in the industry seems to be "SCO was bad".
</p>
<p>
No: SCO were good guys and SCO Xenix was great. It wasn’t even x86-only:
an early version ran on the Apple Lisa, alongside 2 others.<br /> 
</p>
<p>
<em>The SCO Group</em> went evil. SCO was fine. SCO != SCO
<em>Group</em>.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
Caldera was an attempt to bring Linux up to a level where it could
compete with Windows, and it was a good product. It was the first
<em>desktop</em> Linux I ran as my main desktop OS for a while. 
</p>
<p>
Only one company both owned and sold a UNIX™ <em>and</em> had invested
heavily in Linux <em>and</em> had the money to fight the SCO Group: IBM.
</p>
<p>
IBM set its lawyers on the SCO Group lawsuit and it collapsed.
</p>
<p>
Xinuos salvaged the tiny residual revenues to be had from the SCO and
Novell Unixware product lines.
</p>
<p>
Who owns the Unix source code? Microfocus, because it owns Novell.
</p>
<p>
Who sells actual Unix? Xinuos.
</p>
<p>
Who owns the trademark? The Open Group. "POSIX" (a name coined by
Richard Stallman) <em>became</em> UNIX™.
</p>
<p>
Who owns Bell Labs? AT&amp;T spin off Lucent, later bought by Alcatel,
later bought by Nokia.
</p>
<p>
Was Linux stolen? No.
</p>
<p>
Does anyone care now? No.
</p>
<p>Did anyone ever care? No, only Ray Noorda with a determined attempt
to out-Microsoft Microsoft, which
failed. <br /><br /><img src="https://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=liam_on_linux&ditemid=94885" width="30" height="12" alt="comment count unavailable" style="vertical-align: middle;"/>

<p>date: 2025-04-04, from: Shady Characters blog</p>
<p>
Emoji have been in the news recently for a host of reasons, most of them
bad — but all of them, I would submit, worthy of our attention.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
First up is a
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81756069">Netflix series
called <cite>Adolescence</cite></a> that has been garnering plaudits in
the <abbr class="initialism">UK</abbr> and elsewhere since it went on
air last month. I won’t spoil the plot, but I note that Emojipedia has
joined the clamour with a blog post titled
“<a href="https://blog.emojipedia.org/netflixs-adolescence-emoji-codes-emoji-repurposing/">Netflix’s
‘Adolescence’, Emoji Codes &amp; Emoji Repurposing</a>”. In it, Keith
Broni explores the programme’s use of an “emoji code” by so-called
incels — a misogynistic online culture of men who blame women for their
lack of sexual success — in which, for instance, ‘💯’ refers to the
belief that 20% of men attract 80% of women. <cite>Adolescence</cite>
moots other codes too, such as ‘🔵’ and ‘🔴’ to represent the blue and
red pills made famous by <cite>The Matrix</cite>, the Wachowski sisters’
dystopian action film, and which in turn relate to being “blue pilled”
or “red pilled” — either accepting of mainstream views or “seeing
through” them to some alleged hidden truth.

News)</p>
<p>One thing led to another, we discussed lots of facets to the RFSM
document. At some point it started rewriting what I had, and used two
terms that don’t belong in standards-making: dogfood and deprecate.
Nothing ever is deprecated. That’s arrogance on the part of developers.
Imagine if someone in charge of NYC decided to deprecate the arrangement
of the streets. Also, if your protocol achieved any adoption at all,
there are far more developers than there are originators of the format.
If I decided, for example, that the “webmaster” element in RSS was
deprecated, do you think anyone would care? Of course not, nor should
they. It’s a powerless thing. I feel you should introduce features
carefully because you will have to live with them forever. Also I
thought there was a section in RFSM about breakage. That was Rule #1 at
UserLand. We didn’t always live up to it. About dogfood: I don’t eat dog
food, I’m a human. 2. It says we think of our users as pets, that’s not
rational or productive. However I do very strongly believe you have to
use what you create, because you won’t understand what users say unless

<p>Just tried an
<a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/67efabbd-1758-8012-a19b-a912cd72944a">experiment</a>,
I asked ChatGPT to review
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub">ActivityPub</a> re
<a href="https://this.how/standards/">Rules for Standards-makers</a>. I
totally concurred with its conclusions. In any case, it illustrates how
ChatGPT can be helpful in designing new formats and protocols, making
them more supportable and more useful for interop, which according to
Rule 1, is the only reason we make standards.</p>

<h2 id="journalists-still-sanewashing">Journalists still
sanewashing</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-03, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
They’re still
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanewashing">sanewashing</a>
Trump.
</p>
<p>
Example. Just listened to Brian Lehrer, a news interview and call-in
show on WNYC, which I revere, for many reasons. Lehrer is smart, and
doesn’t dumb things down for his audience. He usually asks the question
I’m dying to hear the answer to, which most reporters don’t think of or
won’t ask.
</p>
<p>
On the March 27 they had a
<a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/bl-daily-politics-podcast/articles/columbia-university-faces-the-prisoners-dilemma">discussion</a>
about Trump’s assault on Columbia University, which has now been
extended to Harvard and Princeton. In all of them, the main issue is
antisemitism at these universities.
</p>
<p>
Never in the discussion did they raise this question –
</p>
<p>
Do we believe that Trump cares about antisemitism?
</p>
<p>
And if he did, there are much bigger antisemites who are much more
powerful and much closer to Trump (who is an obvious antisemite
himself).
</p>
<p>
I’ll mention just one – Elon Musk, who actually did the Nazi salute,
twice, from the podium with the Presidential Seal on it, at the freaking
inauguration.
</p>
<p>
Musk has also backed the German Nazi party (they have a different name
but to use that name would be NaziWashing, which I won’t do).
</p>
<p>
The Occam’s truth is that he’s tying antisemitism to things because it’s
fun for him, and because later – they will blame Jews for everything
that’s wrong in the US, as they always do.
</p>
<p>
The whole thing of Trump being a champion for Jewish people made me
really uneasy, until I read a
<a href="https://snyder.substack.com/p/antisemitism-and-antisemitism">piece</a>
in Timothy Snyder’s newsletter, which I recommend to everyone.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I trust Brian Lehrer, I don’t think he’d shirk a tough question,
I just think as a journalist he still isn’t thinking realistically about
the world as it is now, instead behaving as he did before it got so
rotten.

The stock is currently down nearly 50% from its peak, but despite that
drop its trailing P/E is still over 60, which is valuing the company as
a tech company with vast growth potential. For comparison, Nvidia is
down 25% from its peak and its P/E is around 40. In the most recent
quarter, Nvidia’s revenues were almost $40B with operating income up 77%
year-on-year, Tesla’s revenue was $25B with operating income down 23%
year-on-year. <br /> <br /> It is clearly time to pump the stock, and
Musk’s favored pumping technique is to announce an implausible schedule
for some vaporware product and hope that no-one remembers what happened
to all the previous implausible schedules he announced. So far this year
we have:<br />
<ul>
<li>
During the January earnings call Musk
<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/29/tesla-tsla-2024-q4-earnings.html">announced
that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
the company would be “launching unsupervised Full Self-Driving as a paid
service” in Austin in June.
</blockquote>
Outside China, Waymo is the only company currently offering a fully
autonomous paid taxi service. To do it they need staffed depots for
charging and cleaning, and a staff of remote drivers for when the cars
get into trouble. June is ten weeks away, so Tesla should be leasing
depot space, and hiring and training staff. Is it?
</li>
<li>
Musk claims Tesla will
<a href="https://elonbuzz.com/elon-musk-confirms-3-new-teslas-models-for-2025/">launch
Model 2 this year</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Model 2 Redwood’s price will start at just $19,999,
</blockquote>
Does anyone remember his announcement of a ship date and a price for the
Cybertruck? Does anyone remember Tesla announced then cancelled the
Model 2 last year? And given the
<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/20/business/even-used-teslas-are-falling-out-of-favor/index.html">collapse
in used Tesla prices</a>, at $20K it will compete with the Model 3.
</li>
<li>
Musk claims Tesla will
<a href="https://elonbuzz.com/elon-musk-confirms-3-new-teslas-models-for-2025/">refresh
the Model Y this year</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Expected to launch in early 2025, the Model Y Opal retains the same
exterior dimensions but focuses on maximizing interior space and
improving range.
</blockquote>
A refresh of Tesla’s model lineup is long overdue. They have actually
refreshed one of the five this year.
</li>
<li>
Then of course there is the inevitable
<a href="https://phys.org/news/2025-03-musk-starship-depart-mars.html">Mars
announcement</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
SpaceX founder Elon Musk said Saturday its massive Starship rocket would
leave for Mars at the end of 2026 with Tesla humanoid robot Optimus
onboard, adding that human landings could follow “as soon as 2029.”
</blockquote>
Given that Starship needs a major redesign after
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/the-starship-program-hits-another-speed-bump-with-second-consecutive-failure/">two
successive failures</a> rained flaming debris on Caribbean islands and
disrupted flights across the Eatern US, reporters might take note of
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/03/after-years-of-acceleration-has-spacex-finally-reached-its-speed-limit/">Eric
Berger’s skepticism</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Although there will no doubt be pressure from SpaceX leadership to
rapidly move forward, there appears to be a debilitating design flaw in
the upgraded version of Starship. It will be important to understand and
address this. Another launch before this summer seems unlikely. A third
consecutive catastrophic failure would be really, really bad.

These pumps didn’t work. Clearly, people are starting to remember, which
is probably the reason for the Trump and Lutnick sales pitches.<br />
<br /> About 4% of Tesla’s revenue comes from
<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/29/tesla-tsla-2024-q4-earnings.html">carbon
credits</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Automotive revenue fell 8% to $19.8 billion from $21.56 billion in the
same quarter last year, and of that, $692 million came from regulatory
credits.
</blockquote>
4% of revenue doesn’t sound like much, but it goes straight to the
bottom line. A better way to think of it is that carbon credits are 30%
of Tesla’s net income. Tesla can only claim a credit after it sells a
car, something that has recently become
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ea2329e4-b4bc-4e2d-be34-e9a8ea31129c">more
difficult</a>. Unsold cars don’t just represent tied-up capital, they
also represent unclaimed carbon credits. Dean Blundell’s
<a href="https://x.com/ItsDeanBlundell/status/1901674845517262992">thread
reports that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The Canadian government is probing Tesla for allegedly inflating EV
sales to claim $43M in rebates during the final days of the iZEV
program. Here’s what we know. Over a 3-day period, Tesla reported
selling 8,653 cars across 4 dealerships, claiming over half of the
remaining rebate funds. This surge coincided with the program’s
announced suspension, raising suspicions of foul play. To put this into
perspective: Tesla would have needed to sell 2 cars per minute
continuously for 72 hours. Many dealerships couldn’t even process claims
as Tesla reportedly consumed most of the funds. Independent dealers are
now out $10M after providing rebates they expected to be reimbursed for.
The Canadian Automobile Dealers Association accuses Tesla of exploiting
the system, leaving others locked out. Transport Canada officials noted
discrepancies, suggesting Tesla may have backdated claims or exaggerated
sales figures. One Quebec location alone claimed 4,000 sales in a
weekend—an implausible number given its capacity. Tesla’s actions have
sparked outrage among dealers and industry groups, with calls for
stricter oversight of rebate programs. The investigation continues, but
questions remain about whether laws were broken or loopholes abused.

There have been rumors for a long time that another Tesla pump technique
was dodgy accounting, and it seems that the <i>Financial Times</i> may
have found some.

<blockquote>
Compare Tesla’s capital expenditure in the last six months of 2024 to
its valuation of the assets that money was spent on, and $1.4bn appears
to have gone astray.<br /> <br /> The sum is big enough to matter even

group’s underlying numbers, now that its fully diluted stock market

Why might Musk be desperate to pump the stock? Will Lockett examines
this question in
<a href="https://www.planetearthandbeyond.co/p/tesla-is-so-screwed"><i>Tesla
Is So Screwed</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Just a reminder that Tesla stock is so wildly overvalued because
investors have been speculating that the 4680, Cybertruck, FSD, and
Cybercab would be the revolutions Musk promised and would dominate the
automotive world. As such, Musk should see the fact that Tesla’s stock
has only shrunk by 36% as a miracle. But, as time goes on, and Tesla
abandons the 4680, Cybertruck sales continue to disappoint, and FSD and
Cybercab demonstrations are either delayed or it becomes painfully
obvious to everyone how abysmally perilous they are, these investors
will realise they made a bad bet and pull their money out, crashing
Tesla even further.
</blockquote>
Lockett looks at each of the four factors in turn:<br />
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.planetearthandbeyond.co/p/tesla-is-so-screwed">4680</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
This was meant to be a revolutionary battery with high specs and
industry-crushing low prices. Tesla has sunk billions upon billions of
dollars into its development, yet five years since it was announced, it
has yet to meet the target specification or price. Naturally, it has
slipped miles behind the curve, given that there are now battery packs
that are simultaneously safer, far cheaper, and charge much faster than
the 4680.
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.planetearthandbeyond.co/p/tesla-is-so-screwed">Cybertruck</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
But, after a dismal year of sales, Tesla is already scaling back
Cybertruck production capacity to only a few tens of thousands of units
per year. This isn’t surprising, as they are terribly built, practically
useless, and reports have found they are more deadly than the infamous
Ford Pinto
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.planetearthandbeyond.co/p/tesla-is-so-screwed">FSD</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Then there is the fact that Tesla has admitted that the current hardware
installed on its cars isn’t good enough for self-driving, even though
they previously stated that it was, meaning that to sell fully-fledged
FSD, Tesla will have to do one of the most expensive recalls in history
to retrofit new hardware into millions of cars.
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.planetearthandbeyond.co/p/tesla-is-so-screwed">Cybercab</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
On top of that, even after the Cybercab demonstration, we have yet to
see a Tesla safely drive itself on public streets, even when its
competitors have been achieving that for years.

<a href="https://www.newsweek.com/elon-musk-facing-margin-call-tesla-stock-2047059"><i>Could
Elon Musk Face Margin Call Over Tesla Stock? What We Know</i></a> by
Hugh Cameron provides some details:<br />
<blockquote>
According to a 2024 Tesla filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC), Musk has pledged 238.4 million shares “as collateral
to secure certain personal indebtedness.” At the time, Musk held a total
of 715.0 million shares, meaning approximately one-third were being used
as collateral for personal loans.<br /> <br /> Musk currently owns
around 411 million shares in Tesla, according to portfolio management
service Whalewisdom, equating to a roughly 12.8 percent stake in the
company.
</blockquote>
Assuming these numbers are still correct, Musk has 172.6M unpledged
shares, today “worth” about $46B. At JP Morgan’s $120/share target, they
would be worth about $20.7B. That’s a problem for Musk. But the 238.4M
pledged shares, today worth around $64B would be worth only $28.6B,
which might be a bigger problem for Musk’s lenders.<br /> <br /> People
tend to focus on Musk’s and Tesla’s assets but not so much on the debt.
Lockett has looked at the the other side of the ledger in
<a href="https://www.planetearthandbeyond.co/p/this-is-how-tesla-will-die"><i>This
Is How Tesla Will Die</i></a>:<br />
<ul>
<li>
First
<a href="https://www.planetearthandbeyond.co/p/this-is-how-tesla-will-die">Tesla’s
debt</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
As of writing, Tesla has at least $48.39 billion in debt.
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
Second
<a href="https://www.planetearthandbeyond.co/p/this-is-how-tesla-will-die">Musk’s
debt</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Musk has also used his Tesla stock as collateral for SpaceX, Twitter,
and Tesla loans. Before he bought Twitter, over half of his shares were
collateralised; now, that figure is far, far higher. Again, let’s be
generous and assume only 70% of his 12.8% stake in Tesla is
collateralised in this way, with a third of these loans for Tesla. That
would mean Musk has $71.68 billion in personal loans, with $23.89
billion for Tesla.
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
Lockett notes
<a href="https://www.planetearthandbeyond.co/p/this-is-how-tesla-will-die">this
means</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
In other words, Tesla actually has $72.28 billion in debt. That is more
than the company is realistically worth!
</blockquote>
Lockett means worth if it were valued as a car company, because at
Toyota’s PE of 8.4 instead of Tesla’s current forward PE of 116, it
would be worth $54B. Today, Tesla’s market cap is around $827B. At JP
Morgan’s $120 target Tesla’s market cap would be around $386B, so the
total debt would be around 19% of market cap. Tesla’s debt would be
around 12.5% of market cap, so they’d be fine. But Musk would appear to
owe around $72B but have around $24B of collateral pledged. Adding the
$21B of unpledged shares gets to $45B, leaving a gap of $27B. Both Musk
and the lenders would have a problem.<br /> <br /> Apart from general
greed, the co-Presidents have a special need to keep TSLA pumped. Their
hold on the Republican party depends to a large extent on the perception
that the $300M Musk paid to elect Trump was small change compared to
what they could donate to their primary opponents. In
<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/sen-lisa-murkowski-fellow-republicans-afraid-trump-musk/story?id=119956519"><i>Sen. Lisa
Murkowski says fellow Republicans ‘afraid’ of Trump, Musk</i></a>,
Benjamin Siegel gives an example:<br />
<blockquote>
“It may be that Elon Musk decides that he’s going to take the next
billion dollars he makes off Starlink and put it directly against Lisa
Murkowksi. And you know what. That may happen. But I’m not giving up one
minute, one opportunity to try to stand up for Alaska,” she said.

It isn’t just that many fewer people are buying new Teslas, it is also
that existing Tesla owners are dumping theirs. CNN’s
<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/20/business/even-used-teslas-are-falling-out-of-favor/index.html"><i>The
used Tesla market is crumbling</i></a> describes the rout:<br />
<blockquote>
CarGurus, a car-buying site, found that used Tesla prices are falling at
more than double the rate of the average used car price. The Cybertruck,
the controversial steel-sided pickup, fared the worst of any Tesla
vehicle, with a resale value 58% less than its original price, according
to CarGurus.
</blockquote>
This has three effects. It increases the motivation for owners to sell
their cars, because they see them depreciating so fast, it diverts
buyers who actually want a Tesla from new to used, and it forces Tesla
to discount new car prices to move them off the lots, which increases
the depreciation. It is a vicious cycle.<br />

But the much bigger problem is simply that Tesla hasn’t kept up with the
competition in the Chinese market, which last year contributed

faces trouble from BYD’s new EV charger breakthrough. Here’s what to
know</i></a> provides just one example:
<blockquote>
BYD on Monday unveiled a new charging system that can deliver enough
power to its cars to travel 292 miles within just five minutes, a tad
longer than it takes to fill up a tank of gas. BYD Chair Wang Chuanu
told Bloomberg News that the company plans to set up 4,000 charging
stations, although he didn’t specify a timeline for doing so. <br />
<br /> The “Super e-Platform” includes flash-charging batteries, a
30,000 RPM motor, and silicon carbide power chips, according to
Bloomberg. It claims that its system is the fastest of its type for
mass-produced vehicles. <br /> <br /> The first BYD models to get the
five-minute charging system will be the Han L sedan and Tang L SUV,
which are set to hit the market in April at prices starting at 270,000
yuan ($37,338). The company sold more than 318,000 passenger vehicles in
February, up 161% year-over-year. <br /> <br /> Cornering the market on
ultra-speed EV charging would be a major boost to BYD, which is already
the biggest automaker in the world’s biggest auto market. BYD also plans
to equip all of its models priced above $13,688 with the “God’s Eye”
software, offering assisted driving software to mass-market buyers.
</blockquote>
Tesla’s Supercharger network is a big part of its product appeal, and it
is vulnerable. Om Malik’s
<a href="https://crazystupidtech.com/archive/chinas-ev-boom-is-bad-for-ustech/">China’s
EV Boom Is Bad For U.S.Tech</a> has the dismal numbers:<br />
<blockquote>
In 2023, Tesla delivered 1.8 million cars, while BYD delivered 1.57
million. In 2024, Tesla delivered 1.79 million electric vehicles, while
BYD sold 1.76 million. BYD is nipping on its heels, and poised to take a
lead.<br /> <br /> However, these numbers don’t tell the complete story.
BYD reported higher revenues in the third quarter of 2024 and delivered
more fully electric vehicles than Tesla in the fourth quarter. According
to China Passenger Car Association data released March 4, Tesla’s
wholesale sales in the Chinese market fell 49% in February compared to
the same period last year, reaching 30,688 units.<br /> …<br /> BYD sold
4.27 million cars in 2024, approaching Ford’s estimated sales for the
year. China exports EVs in aggregate to the Global South rather than to
the EU or US. No wonder Ford’s CEO is honest enough to admit that they
are facing down the barrel of the gun.

BYD is, like Tesla, a vertically integrated company. But Xiaomi and the
other Chinese EV companies are not. They are enabled by the fact that
the EV industry in China is like the PC or the smartphone business. The
product is modular, and each module forms a competitive market. Xiaomi,
the smartphone company, understood how to operate in this market when,
on 30<sup>th</sup> March 2021 they announced that they would build an
EV.<br /> <br /> They launched their first car in December 2023,
announced prices for a Model S size sedan in March 2024 at $30K ($4K
cheaper than a Model 3) for the base model and up to $41.5K for one with
a 497-mile range on the CLTC standard, 673 horsepower, four-wheel drive
and a self-driving stack including dual Nvidia Orin and lidar. They
started taking orders on 28<sup>th</sup> March 2024. The first 50K
orders took 27 minutes, they had 100K by April, and were shipping a few
days later. They delivered 140K cars in the first 8 months, and are now
producing 20K cars/month.<br /> <br /> Business Insider’s YouTube review

In late 2024 Xiaomi launched an Ultra version with 1500hp and 0-100KPH
in 2s, priced between $72K and $114K. Deliveries began last month. Jack

electric cars. Not only is the electric sedan’s time remarkable, but the
SU7 Ultra managed it while appearing to lose power around the

Not that everything is smooth sailing for Xiaomi. Reuters reports that
<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/chinas-xiaomi-says-actively-cooperating-052114932.html"><i>Xiaomi

…<br /> A disclosure from the company earlier on Tuesday said initial
information showed the car was in the Navigate on Autopilot
intelligent-assisted driving mode before the accident and was moving at
116 kph (72 mph).<br /> <br /> In a rundown of the data submitted to
local police posted on a company Weibo account, Xiaomi said the
autopilot system had issued a risk warning of obstacles ahead.<br />
<br /> A driver inside the car took over and tried to slow it down, but
then collided with a cement pole at a speed of 97 kph.

Note that this was the standard model SU-7 which, like Tesla, <i>lacks

through an over-the-air software update.<br /> <br /> However, Tesla
halted the program this week.

Jameson Dow reported that

drops ‘FSD’ from name of its driver-assist tech in China</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Previously, the system was called “FSD Intelligent Assisted Driving” in
Chinese. The new name drops “FSD” from the title, and simply calls it
“Intelligent Assisted Driving.” It has also previously been called “Full
Self-Driving Capability” in China.<br /> <br /> Tesla has received
plenty of criticism over the years for the name of its system, which,
despite being called “Full Self-Driving,” does not actually allow cars
to fully drive themselves. Tesla changed the name to “Full Self-Driving
(Supervised)” in the US last year, to show that a driver still needs to
supervise the vehicle while the system is active.
</blockquote>
“Intelligent Assisted Driving” costs almost $8K in China,
<a href="https://electrek.co/2025/03/25/tesla-drops-fsd-from-name-of-its-driver-assist-tech-in-china/">but</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
BYD recently pushed a software update giving
<a href="https://electrek.co/2025/02/10/byds-most-affordable-evs-smart-driving-upgrade-free/">smart
driving features to all of its vehicles – for free</a>. This is surely
part of what pushed Tesla to roll out its FSD system in China in the
first place.<br /> <br /> But immediately after that rollout, Tesla
drivers started
<a href="https://electrek.co/2025/02/27/tesla-drivers-are-racking-up-fines-using-fsd-in-china/">racking
up fines</a> for violating the law. Many roads in China are watched by
CCTV cameras, and fines are automatically handed out to drivers to break
the law.<br /> <br /> It’s clear that the system still needs more
knowledge about Chinese roads in general, because it kept mistaking bike
lanes for right turn lanes, etc. One driver racked up 7 tickets within
the span of a single drive after driving through bike lanes and crossing
over solid lines. If a driver gets enough points on their license, they
could even have their license suspended.
</blockquote>
Props to China for forcing Tesla to be somewhat less misleading about
Fake Self Driving. Prospects for Tesla’s eventual Robotaxi in China
don’t look great, because there already are

on the roads: China’s Baidu eyes overseas rollout as autonomous driving

<blockquote>
Chinese tech giant Baidu is reportedly planning to launch its robotaxi
service outside of China as it looks to make inroads in the autonomous
driving global market - a growing industry that other Chinese players as
well as Western firms are racing towards.<br /> <br /> The Beijing-based
company is hoping to test and deploy its Apollo Go robotaxis in places
including Hong Kong, Singapore and the Middle East, according to reports
from the likes of Nikkei Asia and the Wall Street Journal that cited
people familiar with the matter.<br /> …<br /> Baidu is already
operating robotaxi services in multiple cities in China. It provided
close to 900,000 rides in the second quarter of the year, up 26 per cent
year-on-year, according to its latest earnings call. More than 7 million
robotaxi rides in total had been operated as of late July.
</blockquote>
Waymo is in the robotaxi market, albeit with vehicles that are a lot
more expensive than Baidu’s. Tesla is not in this market.<br /> <br />
Xiaomi is just one of the Chinese EV makers, and both it and BYD are
obviously performing better and faster than Tesla. How is Tesla
responding? By getting the White House to place a
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-26/trump-prepares-auto-tariff-announcement-as-soon-as-wednesday">25%
tariff on imported cars</a>. China has studied the history of Japanese
car exports, as Lingling Wei reports in
<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/china-explores-limiting-its-own-exports-to-mollify-trump/ar-AA1BqftW"><i>China
Explores Limiting Its Own Exports to Mollify Trump</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Like Japan decades ago, China is considering trying to blunt greater
U.S. tariffs and other trade barriers by offering to curb the quantity
of certain goods exported to the U.S., according to advisers to the
Chinese government.<br /> <br /> Tokyo’s adoption of so-called voluntary
export restraints, or VERs, to limit its auto shipments to the U.S. in
the 1980s helped prevent Washington from imposing higher import duties
</blockquote>
<p>These restrictions didn’t prevent Toyota and Honda grabbing a big
chunk of the US market, because their cars were better. The reviews of
EVs in the Chinese market agree that comparable models are both better
and cheaper than Tesla’s, which is why their sales are dropping. It is
likely that the highly competitive Chinese market can produce EVs that
are better and more than 25% cheaper than US-made EVs.<br /> <br /></p>

<h2 id="web-3.0-requires-data-integrity">Web 3.0 Requires Data
Integrity</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-03, updated: 2025-04-02, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
If you’ve ever taken a computer security class, you’ve probably learned
about the three legs of computer security—confidentiality, integrity,
and availability—known as
the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/image/cia-triad">CIA triad</a>. When
we talk about a system being secure, that’s what we’re referring to. All
are important, but to different degrees in different contexts. In a
world populated by artificial intelligence (AI) systems and artificial
intelligent agents, integrity will be paramount.
</p>
<p>
What is data integrity? It’s ensuring that no one can modify data—that’s
the security angle—but it’s much more than that. It encompasses
accuracy, completeness, and quality of data—all over both time and
space. It’s preventing accidental data loss; the “undo” button is a
primitive integrity measure. It’s also making sure that data is accurate
when it’s collected—that it comes from a trustworthy source, that
nothing important is missing, and that it doesn’t change as it moves
from format to format. The ability to restart your computer is another
integrity measure…

id="why-foss-oses-often-dont-have-power-management-as-good-as-proprietary-ones">Why
FOSS OSes often don’t have power management as good as proprietary
ones</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-03, from: Liam on Linux</p>
(Especially Haiku.)<br /><br />It may seem odd but it’s not.<br />
<p>
Haiku is a recreation of a late-1990s OS. News for you: in the 1990s and
until then, computers didn’t do power management.
</p>
<p>
The US government had to institute a whole big programme to get
companies to add power management.
</p>
<p>
<a rpl="" class="relative pointer-events-auto a cursor-pointer          underline  " href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_Star" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_Star</a>
</p>
<p>
Aggressive power management is only a thing because silicon vendors lie
to their customers. Yes, seriously.
</p>
<p>
From the mid-1970s for about 30 years, adding more transistors meant
computers got faster. CPUs went from 4-bit to 8-bit to 16-bit to 32-bit,
then there was a pause while they gained onboard memory management
(Intel 80386/Motorola 68030 generation) then scalar execution and
onboard hardware floating point (80486/68040 generation), then onboard
L1 cache (Pentium), then superscalar execution and near-board L2 cache
(Pentium II), then onboard L2 (Pentium III), then they ran out of ideas
to spend CPU transistors on, so the transistor budget went on RAM
instead, meaning we needed 64-bit CPUs to track it.
</p>
<p>
The Pentium 4 was an attempt to crank this as high as it would go by
running as fast as possible and accepting a low IPC (instructions per
clock). It was nicknamed the fanheater. So Intel US pivoted to Intel
Israel’s low-power laptop chip with aggressive power management. Voilà,
the Core and then Core 2 series.
</p>
<p>
Then, circa 2006-2007, <em>big</em> problem. 64-bit chips had loads of
cache on board, they were superscalar, decomposing x86 instructions into
micro ops, resequencing them for optimal execution with branch
prediction, they had media and 3D extensions like MMX2, SSE, SSE2, they
were 64-bit with lots of RAM, and there was <em>nowhere to spend the
increasing transistor budget.</em>
</p>
<p>
Result, multicore. Duplicate everything. Tell the punters it’s twice as
fast. It isn’t. Very few things are parallel.
</p>
<p>
With an SMP-aware OS, like NT or BeOS or Haiku, 2 cores make things a
bit more responsive but no faster.
</p>
<p>
Then came 3 and 4 cores, and onboard GPUs, and then heterogenous cores,
with "efficiency" and "performance" cores… but none of this makes your
software run faster. It’s marketing.
</p>
<p>
You can’t run all the components of a modern CPU at once. It would burn
itself out in seconds. Most of the chip is turned off most of the time,
and there’s an onboard management core running its own OS, invisible to
user code, to handle this.
</p>
<p>
Silicon vendors are selling us stuff we can’t use. If you turned it all
on at once, instant self-destruction. We spend money on transistors that
<em>must</em> spend 99% of the time turned off. It’s called "dark
silicon" and it’s what we pay for.
</p>
<p>
In real life, chips stopped getting Moore’s Law speed increases 20 years
ago. That’s when we stopped getting twice the performance every 18
months.
</p>
<p>
All the aggressive power management and sleep modes are to help
inadequate cooling systems stop CPUs instantly incinerating themselves.
Hibernation is to disguise how slowly multi-gigabyte OSes boot. You
can’t see the slow boot if it doesn’t boot so often.
</p>
<p>
For 20 years the CPU and GPU vendors have been selling us transistors we
can’t use. Power management is the excuse.
</p>
<p>
Update your firmware early and often. Get a nice fast SSD. Shut it down
when you’re not using it: it reboots fast.
</p>
<p>
Enjoy a fast responsive OS that doesn’t try to play the Win/Lin/Mac game
of "write more code to use the fancy accelerators and hope things go
faster".

2025-03-20 Something about the bot defence is working
</h1>
<p>
At midnight, there was a surge in activity. CPU usage went up.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-03-20-bot-defence-1.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Load went up, too. But it stayed within reasonable bounds – less than 4
instead of the more than 80 I have seen in the past.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-03-20-bot-defence-2.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
And the number of IP addresses blocked by <code>fail2ban</code> went
from 40 to 50.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-03-20-bot-defence-3.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
I’m usually sceptical of this because the big attacks are from a far
wider variety of IP numbers. In this case, however, maybe there was some
probing that resulted in blocks? I don’t know. Lucky, I guess?
</p>
<p>
In any case, the site is still up. Yay for small wins.
</p>
<p>
Also, I cannot overstate how good it feel to have some
<a href="https://munin-monitoring.org/">Munin</a> graphs available.
</p>
<p>
<code>alex-bots</code> is a setup I desribed in
<a href="2025-02-19-bots-again">2025-02-19 Bots again, cursed</a>.
Basically a request to one of my Oddmuse wikis containing the parameter
<code>rcidonly</code> is an expensive endpoint: “all changes for this
single page” or “a feed for this single page”. This is something a human
would rarely access and yet it somehow the URLs landed in some dataset
for AI training, I suspect. So what I do is I’m redirecting any request
containing “rcidonly” in the query string to <code>/nobots</code>,
warning humans not to click on these links.
</p>
<p>
In addition to that, the filter
<code>/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/alex-bots.conf</code> contains this:
</p>
<pre><code>[Definition]
failregex = ^(www\.emacswiki\.org|communitywiki\.org|campaignwiki\.org):[0-9]+ &lt;HOST&gt; .*rcidonly=
</code></pre>

And I added a section using this filter to my jail
<code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/alex.conf</code>:

<pre><code>[alex-bots]
enabled = true
port    = http,https
logpath = %(apache_access_log)s
findtime = 3600
maxretry = 2
</code></pre>
<p>
So if an IP number visits three URLs containing “rcidonly” in an hour,
they get banned for ten minutes.
</p>
<p>
The <code>recidive</code> filter (a standard filter you just need to
activate) then makes sure that any IP number that got blocked three
times gets blocked for a week.

post, more people seem to notice what’s going on: AI ingestion is
killing web sites and web services.

<p>
If you think these crawlers respect <code>robots.txt</code> then you are
several assumptions of good faith removed from reality. These bots crawl
everything they can find, <code>robots.txt</code> be damned, including
expensive endpoints like git blame, every page of every git log, and
every commit in every repo, and they do so using random User-Agents that
overlap with end-users and come from tens of thousands of IP addresses –
mostly residential, in unrelated subnets, each one making no more than
one HTTP request over any time period we tried to measure – actively and
maliciously adapting and blending in with end-user traffic and avoiding
attempts to characterize their behavior or block their traffic. –

Then, yesterday morning, KDE GitLab infrastructure was overwhelmed by
another AI crawler, with IPs from an Alibaba range; this caused GitLab
to be temporarily inaccessible by KDE developers. I then discovered
that, one week ago, an Anime girl started appearing on the GNOME GitLab
instance, as the page was loaded. It turns out that it’s the default
loading page for Anubis, a proof-of-work challenger that blocks AI
scrapers that are causing outages. –

<p>
What do SourceHut, GNOME’s GitLab, and KDE’s GitLab have in common,
other than all three of them being forges? Well, it turns out all three
of them have been dealing with immense amounts of traffic from “AI”
scrapers, who are effectively performing DDoS attacks with such ferocity
it’s bringing down the infrastructures of these major open source
projects. Being open source, and thus publicly accessible, means these
scrapers have unlimited access, unlike with proprietary projects. …
Everything about this “AI” bubble is gross, and I can’t wait for this
bubble to pop so a semblance of sanity can return to the technology
world. Until the next hype train rolls into the station, of course. –

2025</a> that his logs show a total of 468439 requests for February
2025. The top hitter was 4.231.104.62 with 43242 requests (9%). This was
from MICROSOFT-CORP-MSN-AS-BLOCK, US. But the ASN has more networks, of
course. Adding them all up give 78889 (17%).

He links to the <a href="https://www.team-cymru.com/ip-asn-mapping">IP

want to be, actually.

There is another non-security way that designers can spend their

I typically don’t do anything for April Fool’s Day, but this year I
thought I’d unite a bit of a meme in the homelab community with
something I wanted to make a video on anyway: a <em>lamp rack</em>.
</p>
<p>
What’s a lamp rack? Well, you’re looking at one! It’s a floor lamp with
an integrated <a href="https://mini-rack.jeffgeerling.com">mini
rack</a>!

<p>
I didn’t want to make a video about a floor lamp, but more on the fact
you don’t <em>need</em> fancy racks or any new hardware at <em>all</em>

Border Crossings</h2>

<p>
I have heard stories of more aggressive interrogation of electronic
devices at US border crossings. I know a lot about securing computers,
but very little about securing phones.
</p>
<p>
Are there easy ways to delete data—files, photos, etc.—on phones so it
can’t be recovered? Does resetting a phone to factory defaults erase
data, or is it still recoverable? That is, does the reset erase the old
encryption key, or just sever the password that access that key? When
the phone is rebooted, are deleted files still available?
</p>
<p>
We need answers for both iPhones and Android phones. And it’s not just
the US; the world is going to become a more dangerous place to oppose
state power…

insert the person in the profile into the drawing, and adapt it as you
see fit, but the face of the person in the profile should be in the same

There’s a point of view reflected in its creations, looking into a soul

<p>date: 2025-03-31, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2025-03-30-don-t-visit-the-usa">
2025-03-30 Don’t visit the USA
</h1>
<p>
When people talk about minimal laptop installs, burner phones, and the
mess of US border crossings, I wonder where they habe been the last
twenty years. A dude from work flew to the states to work for HP as a
student, got turned back at the airport and put on a flight back. He got
to make one family call, his dad called HP, they called some lawyers and
by the time they go there he was already on a plane. And those were the
good days, before 9/11, Homeland Security and all that.
</p>
<p>
Have you seen the forms they have you sign on the Visa Waiver program?
The border agents have total discretion over you. Those are not
“passenger rights” but “small mercies”. And that was long before Trump.
It’s terrible fuckery now, but it wasn’t great before that. Not
travelling to the states? I’ve told people at the office that I won’t be
going to the states for work ever since 9/11. The last time I went
happily was, uh, when The Phantom Menace came out?
</p>
<p>
I went once more when my wife wanted to go to Hawaii. Somebody there
held my hand and prayed for me on a parking lot. Somebody there gave me
an ad for an underground firing range. I learned how the US treated the
locals. No, visiting the US was never an easy call to make. And those
were the good days.
</p>
<p>
And what about boycotting the US? It is with despair that I see my
employer buying more and more into Windows and Microsoft and Azure and
Amazon S3. Have they not learned anything from Snowden? American IT is
not to be trusted. I mean, it’s probably not be trusted anywhere, but
when give a choice, there is no reason to trust the USA. The agencies
can get all the information they want and hand out gag orders to prevent
the well-meaning corporations from warning you. From the outside, they
are just as bad as the rest of them. And they will use their power
against you. And Snowden was during the good years!
</p>
<p>
And yes, Fortress Europe is not great, either. Two things being not
great doesn’t make a right, though. The first step is to realise how bad
the situation is, how bad the situation has been.
</p>
<p>
And now the situation really is fucked up.
</p>
<p>
If you look at the attempts at regime change in recent years, I think
the lessons are obvious: It can only succeed with long, weekly mass
demonstrations, in broad coalitions.
</p>
<p>
The only way out of a corrupt government that controls access to jobs,
controls the institutions, controls most media is weekly protest. It
takes a long time to grow. You have to be there, every time. “Pumpaj!”
Keep the pressure up.
</p>
<p>
Join whatever protest is on this week.
</p>
<p>
I also think it is important to not conflate the man with the mob. Name
no names! Because it’s never just one person. If it looks like one
person then that person is the face man of the mob. The people that need
kicking are all those that got their jobs from the mob. All these greedy
incompetents whose only qualification is how far they can bend over.
</p>
<p>
Yeet them into the sun. Send them off to Mars. Whatever.
</p>
<p>
To think that Canadians or Greenlanders want to be part of the USA is
about as absurd to me as Taiwanese wanting to be part of mainland China
or Ukrainians wanting to be part of Russia. The only ones not getting it
are the sympathisers of the dread regimes in China, in Russia – and in
the USA.
</p>
<p>
<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23USA">#USA</a>
</p>
<p>
<strong>2025-03-31</strong>. I keep learning new things. This is from a
post about US politicians visiting Greenland.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Americans might chuckle at that idea, but such arrogance is unwarranted.
We are the only ones ever to have invoked Article 5, the mutual defense
obligation of the NATO treaty, after 9/11; and our European allies did
respond. Per capita more Danish soldiers were killed in the Afghan war
than were American soldiers … and of course defending against a Russian
attack is the NATO mission. But right now the United States is
supporting Russia in its war against Ukraine. No one is doing more to
contain the Russian threat than Ukraine. Indeed, Ukraine is in effect
fulfilling the entire NATO mission, right now, by absorbing a huge
Russian attack. … Denmark meanwhile has given more than four times as
much aid to Ukraine, per capita, as does the United States. … The US is
is 24th in the world in the happiness rankings. Not bad. But Denmark is
number two (after Finland). On a scale of 1 to 100, Freedom House ranks
Denmark 97 and the US 84 on freedom — and the US will drop a great deal
this year. An American is about ten times more likely to be incarcerated
than a Dane. Danes have access to universal and essentially free health
care; Americans spend a huge amount of money to be sick more often and
to be treated worse when they are. Danes on average live four years
longer than Americans. In Denmark university education is free; the
average balance owed by the tens of millions of Americans who hold
student debt in the US is about $40,000. Danish parents share a year of
paid parental leave. In the US, one parent might get twelve weeks of
unpaid leave. –

<h2 id="more-chatgpt-fun">More ChatGPT fun</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-31, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Yesterday I uploaded an image of a pizza pie, in a New York pizzeria,
with a couple dressed in evening clothes with a NYC cop and off-duty
sanitation worker lurking in the background.
</p>
<p>
Paolo Valdemarin writes from London, “Have you tried adding more images
to a prompt? From my experiments it can easily keep ‘in mind’ five
different images and mix them. You can get a bunch of people sitting in
the same room, with a very detailed version of the room.” He sent two
examples which are somewhat embarrassing, but you’ll probably enjoy
them. :-)
</p>
<p>
First, he uploaded my profile picture from Facebook. And asked ChatGPT
to add me to the picture and then to “sit him next to the couple, with
both of them kissing him on the cheek, and as you can see ChatGPT
complied!

<p>date: 2025-03-31, updated: 2025-03-30, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
US National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, who started the now-infamous
group chat coordinating a US attack against the Yemen-based Houthis on
March 15, is seemingly now suggesting that the secure messaging service
Signal has security vulnerabilities.

<p>
"I didn’t see this loser in the group,"
Waltz <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-admins-shifting-explanations-journalist-added-signal-chat/story?id=120179649">told</a> Fox

It’s spring and we went there. Locarno is in the canton Ticino, in the
south of Switzerland, at the shores of Lago Maggiore (“big lake”) that
it shares with Italy.

<p>
They have a fantastic camellia park. In early spring, it’s the best
place to be.
</p>
<p>
I tried to take pictures with my trusty Olympus EP-5 and the 30mm 1:3.5
macro lens. Sadly, I have been untrained by the phone and was confused
by the settings and the tiny screen. Oh my! So this is mix of camera
pictures and phone pictures.

which is the official rapid response page of the Democratic Party, and
<a href="http://scripting.com/?tab=links">my linkblog feed</a>, so I can
easily test the system. The part that hooks up to Bluesky is relatively
new, so we’ll need to look at problems. As they say – <i>still
