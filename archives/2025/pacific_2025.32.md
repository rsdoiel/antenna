## A humble path to public service (2)

date: 2025-08-10, updated: 2025-08-10, from: Marianas Variety

LIEUTENANT Governor Dennis James C. Mendiola’s path to public service was not historically significant — except for the fact that he was born in the Generation X era. He sought the office of the Senate twice and won in the 2022 election. Since January 2023, he has been serving the first half of his term as Senate President. The untimely passing of Governor Arnold I. Palacios catapulted him into the office of Lieutenant Governor — a process too swift to fully assess his competency for the role he now occupies.
