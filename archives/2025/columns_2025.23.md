## Friday

date: 2025-06-13, from: Doc Searls (at Harvard), New Old Blog

Paper shavings. I just learned by Ed Cone that Greensboro, where I lived (and went to college) from &#39;65 to &#39;69, is maybe, sort of, turning into an aerospace place. (He points here.) More importantly, he offhandedly refers to the &#34;rah rah local media,&#34; which presumably includes the News &#38; Record, which was the News [&#8230;]

## Democratic resurrection plan

date: 2025-06-13, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/07/04/butHerEmails.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Having a <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/01/152316.html?title=whatWouldCuomoDo">Democrat</a> rise from the ashes of <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=metoo">metoo</a> is just what the doctor ordered. It could cure the revulsion some voters feel for Democratic wokeness. <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=cuomo">Cuomo</a> was never tried or convicted of any crime, or voted out of office by the state assembly or senate in Albany. Or the people of the State of New York. Al Franken wasn't allowed to have his case adjudicated by a committee of Congress. Both were pushed from office by journalism, which imho needs to be put in their place, they've been sloshing into lanes they weren't elected to. Let me try to make this clear. Journalism's role is to inform us of events. Once informed, it's their responsibility to stop. Anything past that is campaigning, not news. Step back and let the process run its course. Ultimately it's the people who will decide. Now, if Cuomo wins, this is the best outcome possible because the NYT et al will complain endlessly about how the Democrats just elected someone who they <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gi9zFRBCIM">don't approve of</a>. This will probably get the Dems more votes in coming elections, because there are a lot of people who legitimately are disgusted by the NYT trying to run the show. If you want to govern, run for office. If you want to be a journalist, know when it's time to shut up.</p>
<p>BTW isn't it amazing that when you say something counter to Democratic dogma, their first impulse is to try to destroy you? If the Dems were a healthy political party and not a religion, their first impulse would be to try to work with you not destroy you.</p>
<p>"Who me?" asks the Democrat. Yes, you. </p>
<p>You'll know who the next leader of the Democratic Party is because they will be campaigning against the Democratic Party. Talking about things that actually happened rather than the hallucinations the Trumpies indulge in. </p>

## Paragon Spyware Used to Spy on European Journalists

date: 2025-06-13, updated: 2025-06-13, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Paragon is an Israeli spyware company, increasingly in the news (now that NSO Group seems to be waning). &#8220;Graphite&#8221; is the name of its product. Citizen Lab <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2025/06/first-forensic-confirmation-of-paragons-ios-mercenary-spyware-finds-journalists-targeted/">caught it</a> spying on multiple European journalists with a zero-click iOS exploit:</p>
<blockquote><p>On April 29, 2025, a select group of iOS users were notified by Apple that they were targeted with advanced spyware. Among the group were two journalists that consented for the technical analysis of their cases. The key findings from our forensic analysis of their devices are summarized below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our analysis finds forensic evidence confirming with high confidence that both a prominent European journalist (who requests anonymity), and Italian journalist Ciro Pellegrino, were targeted with Paragon’s Graphite mercenary spyware.

## Realities, perceived and presented, and their relationship to Truth

date: 2025-06-12, from: Tracy Durnell Blog

I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot lately about how knowledge doesn&#8217;t equal understanding—there are things you can know to be intellectually true, but that doesn&#8217;t mean your body or heart has caught up yet. &#8230; You have to prove to your nervous system, choice by choice, that this new way of thinking is actually safe&#8230; &#8212; [&#8230;]

## The Back Of The AI Envelope

The rise of the technology industry over the last few decades has been powered by its very strong <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Increasing-Returns-Dependence-Economics-Cognition/dp/0472064967">economies of scale</a>. Once you have invested in developing and deploying a technology, the benefit of adding each additional customer greatly exceeds the additional cost of doing so. This led to the concept of "<a href="https://hbr.org/2016/04/blitzscaling">blitzscaling</a>", that it makes sense to delay actually making a profit and devote these benefits to <i>adding more customers</i>. That way you follow the example of Amazon and Uber on the path to a monopoly laid out by Brian Arthur's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Increasing-Returns-Dependence-Economics-Cognition/dp/0472064967"><i>Increasing Returns and Path Dependence in the Economy</i></a>. Eventually you can extract monopoly rents and make excess profits, but in the meantime blitzscale believers will pump your stock price.<br />
<br />
This is what the VCs behind OpenAI and Anthropic are doing, and what Google, Microsoft and Oracle are trying to emulate. Is it going to work? Below the fold I report on some back-of-the-envelope calculations, which I did without using <a href="https://people.com/a1-steak-sauce-has-hilarious-response-after-secretary-of-education-linda-mcmahon-flubs-11714927">A1</a>.<br />
<span><a name='more'></a></span>
<br />
David Gerard <a href="https://pivot-to-ai.com/2025/05/31/microsoft-and-ai-spending-billions-to-make-millions/">notes that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
  Microsoft is forecast to spend $80 <i>billion</i> on AI in 2025.
</blockquote>
Lets try to figure out the return on this investment. We will assume that the $80B is split two ways, $40B to Nvidia for hardware and $40B on building data centers to put it in. Depreciating the $40B of hardware over five years is very optimistic, it is likely to be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/22/24162860/nvidia-ai-chip-every-year-blackwell-rubin">uneconomic to run after 2-3 years</a>. But that's what we'll do. So that is minus $8B/year on the bottom line over the next five years. Similarly, depreciating the data centers over 20 years is likely optimistic, given the rate at which <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joule.2025.101961">AI power demand is increasing</a>. But that's what we'll do, giving another minus $2B/year on the bottom line.<br />
<br />
Microsoft could argue that some of the $80B is the cost of training the models. But since the models will depreciate even faster than the hardware used to train them, this doesn't make things look better.<br /> 
<br />
Microsoft's gross margin for cloud services is <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2024-Q4/performance">about 70%</a>, so they will be expecting this $10B/year cost to generate $33B/year in revenue, or about 13% of Microsoft's total. Of course, there will be some ramp up in the revenue, but Microsoft is planning to keep investing, so next year's investment will need to generate a return too. We will thus ignore the ramp.<br />

Jukka Niiranen <a href="https://www.perspectives.plus/p/microsofts-non-profit-ai-adventures">notes that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
  Microsoft is today promoting the pay-as-you-go pricing model of Copilot Studio as the preferred sales motion. The list price of one message is $0.01. While enterprise clients may get discounts, there’s also the chance of prepaid message capacity being unused, so things may even out. With this price point, Copilot Studio usage generates $2.5M revenue per month, and $30M per year. 
</blockquote>
So Microsoft is processing about 30B messages/year. It needs adoption to be so fast that next year's revenue will be around <i>1,100 times</i> its current rate. They will need next year's customers to generate about 330T messages/year.<br />
<br />
How is adoption going? Jukka Niiranen <a href="https://www.perspectives.plus/p/microsofts-non-profit-ai-adventures">notes that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
  160k organizations using Copilot, this translates to around 1.5K messages per org per month. Or 52 messages per day. Now, we have to remember that one action in a Copilot Studio agent often consumes more than one message. ...<br />
  <br />
   If those 52 messages were only about regular GenAI usage without any business process logic, that would mean 26 responses from Copilot Studio agents per day. If they were to include things like agent actions (meaning, AI does something more than just chatting back at you) or AI tools, we’re quickly at a point where the average Copilot Studio customer organization does a couple of agent runs per day.<br />
<br />
  <b>This is shockingly low</b>. It is plain and obvious that most customers are merely experimenting with trying to build agents. Hardly anyone is running it in production yet. Which wouldn’t be that bad if this was a new 2025 product. But Copilot Studio has been out since November 2023.
</blockquote>
The back of my envelope says that Microsoft's AI business needs to grow customers like no business (even OpenAI) has ever grown customers if it is not to be a huge drag on the bottom line.<br />
<br />
If this were a traditional technology business with very strong economies of scale growing customers incredibly fast would be good, because the incremental revenue from each new customer vastly outweighs the incremental cost of supporting them. This is where Microsoft's 70% gross margin comes from.<br />
<br />
OpenAI lost $5B on $4B in revenue, so each $1 of revenue cost them $2.25. Ed Zitron had a <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/oai-business/">more detailed estimate</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
To be abundantly clear, as it stands, OpenAI currently spends $2.35 to make $1.
</blockquote>
Lets assume Microsoft is doing better, with each $1 in revenue costing $1.50.  But, as James O'Donnell and Casey Crownhart report in <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/20/1116327/ai-energy-usage-climate-footprint-big-tech/"><i>We did the math on AI’s energy footprint. Here’s the story you haven’t heard.</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
  As conversations with experts and AI companies made clear, inference, not training, represents an increasing majority of AI’s energy demands and will continue to do so in the near future. It’s now estimated that 80–90% of computing power for AI is used for inference.
</blockquote>
If we assume unrealistically that training is a one-time cost and they don't need to retrain for next year, training cost them say 15% of $45M, or about $6.75M and answering the 30B messages cost them $38.25M. Scaling up by a factor of 1,100 means answering the messages would cost them $42B plus the $10B depreciation, so $52B. But it would only generate $33B in revenue, so each $1 of revenue would cost about $1.58. Scaling up would make the losses worse.<br />
<br />
There are only two possibilities. Either inference gets at least an order of magnitude cheaper than training instead of around 6 times more expensive, or the price of using AI goes up by at least an order of magnitude. Now you see why Sam Altman <i>et al</i> are so desperate to run the "drug-dealer's algorithm" (<i>the first one's free</i>) and get the world hooked on this drug so they can supply a world of addicts.<br />

## Democrats and men

date: 2025-06-12, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Yesterday I posted a link to my <a href="https://this.how/davewiner/politics.opml">political disclaimer</a> from 2018. Also listened to a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/archive/2025/06/david-frum-show-trumps-plot-against-the-2026-elections/683107/">podcast interview</a> with Senator Gallego of Arizona who says, correctly, that the Democrats have work to do with men. It's true, speaking as a man who has been voting solid Democratic since Kerry, but I didn't stop being a man, which is something that makes me cringe to say it, the way I cringed at admitting to being Jewish when I was a kid. I lived in a place where hate of Jews was always just under the surface in school, but not so well hidden at the playground. </p>
<p>Men as a gender were really pushed into a corner we couldn't get out of during #metoo, all men, not just some. If they say they weren't they're lying. I went to a future of journalism conference in 2018, and the only thing men talked about, quietly, among ourselves, was how scared we were of losing everything. It really was bad, but since then it's eased. </p>
<p>I wrote about #metoo in my <a href="https://this.how/davewiner/politics.opml#1520013967000">political disclaimer</a>, but didn't promote it for fear of retribution. I was threatened when I stood up for a friend whose life was ruined for as far as I could tell doing nothing wrong. If you don't shut up we'll do you too, basically. </p>
<p>Women are people just like men, and when they got to rage online against men, even people I thought I knew and were friends behaved abhorently. The way we imagine Trump might deal with us soon. </p>
<p>I have to add not all women, there were some who didn't forget that their male friends were still friends.</p>
<p>It was very clear where the Democratic Party came down on all this, and of course, the Republicans took total advantage of this. If you want to understand the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manosphere">manosphere</a> as you all call it, start here. I vote with you all, but absolutely abhor the way you pushed us all into a corner and shut down our pride. Women are people too and they can be just as ugly as men. If you believe otherwise you're believing lies. I speak from experience, I was raised to believe all women are saints. That lie did not prepare us well for life. </p>
<p>The good news is if the Democrats can make peace with men, there are a lot more votes available to us. We can put it behind us, but we can't ignore that in the late teens we went absolutely fucking batshit crazy about half of the electorate. It's amazing the whole thing didn't completely crumble, irrevocably. We can still fix it, but we have to acknowledge that men were hurt in that period. You all seem to have forgotten that we are just people too. </p>
<p>PS: Re-reading the #metoo section of the disclaimer I can't believe how I tiptoed around the truth. The truth I didn't dare say was it was a huge hate campaign as divisive as anything the Repubs ever did. In a country that was supposed to outlaw this, and from a political party that was supposed to be liberal. The "both sides do it" reality probably hasn't yet sunk in but the Democrats sided with sadists and fascists. No other way to put it. Men absolutely were silenced. Afraid to speak for fear of retribution. If you were on the wrong side of this you have some soul-searching to do. And you probably pushed a lot of people of all genders into voting for Trump. The Dems posture of "who me?" has an answer -- yes you. </p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-06-12, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

I was lucky to grow up in NYC, and had to commute from Queens to the Bronx every day to go to school. Some days I took the <a href="https://bustime.mta.info/m/?q=Q44-SBS&l=">Q44</a> bus over the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronx%E2%80%93Whitestone_Bridge">Whitestone Bridge</a>, and other days I took the <a href="https://bustime.mta.info/m/index;jsessionid=9F7ADE234676D22B101A192CAA31C55E?q=Q16&l=&t=&cacheBreaker=1717915338805">Q16</a> to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_(New_York_City_Subway_service)">7 train</a> through Manhattan, and then the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_(New_York_City_Subway_service)">4</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_(New_York_City_Subway_service)">D trains</a> up to 205th St in the Bronx. Took the same amount of time either way. So at age 15 I was able to go see the Grateful Dead after school at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fillmore_East">Fillmore East</a> on April 27, 1971. Midway through the set, a special guest band who they didn't introduce started tuning up on stage. We all wondered who they were. I now know the history thanks to the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=500+Songs+podcast+beach+boys">500 Songs podcast</a>, and this was the return of a band that had fallen out of favor, a band whose hits we all heard on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WABC_(AM)#The_Musicradio_77_era_(1960%E2%80%931982)">WABC</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNEW-FM#%22Where_Rock_Lives%22">WNEW-FM</a>. When they started playing one of their biggest hits, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Vibrations">Good Vibrations</a>, the audience erupted in ecstasy. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beach_Boys">The Beach Boys</a> now looking a lot different, but playing the same wonderful California music from the 60s. They couldn't be more different from the Dead, but there they were up on stage together. They were back, this time for good. This is a recording of the whole concert, the link <a href="https://youtu.be/kRKY-S4wI1s?si=zTwSE5tvk6LKNjjb&t=2348">points</a> to the beginning of Good Vibrations. You can hear the gasp of recognition, and the bands recognition of the recognition, and from their it was a party in a party, including a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRKY-S4wI1s&t=2508s">sing-along part</a> -- "gotta keep those a lovin' good vibrations happening with you." We were all growing up very quickly, but we had a moment when we could return to a more innocent time. Lovely the way music pulls you back in time. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Wilson">Brian Wilson</a> wasn't there that night but his music certainly was.

## More MCP fun: Claude talks with ChatGPT

date: 2025-06-12, from: Paolo Valdemarin's blog

I started with a new idea this morning: create an MCP server that allows Claude to talk to the various OpenAI models. Now I can ask Claude to ask any of the openAI models. What I find more fascinating is how Claude is figuring out how to use these new tools. The key is in &#8230; <a href="https://val.demar.in/2025/06/more-mcp-fun-claude-talks-with-chatgpt/" class="more-link">Continue reading<span class="screen-reader-text"> "More MCP fun: Claude talks with ChatGPT"</span></a>

## 2025-05-27 Alt text on this blog

date: 2025-06-12, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-05-27-alt-text-on-this-blog">2025-05-27 Alt text on this blog</h1>

<p>On the web, the alt text is a description of an image to be shown by browsers when the image cannot be shown – like text browsers or screen readers. So what about alt text on this blog? What about blog posts full of photos, specifically? Like the <a href="Croatia">Croatia</a> posts.</p>

<p>I think that alt text should be unnecessary on my blog because the text should carry the entire message. “Welcome to my <a href="Wall_of_Text">Wall of Text</a>!” 😄</p>

<p>On fedi, I like alt text and I both read and write it. I hate clients that don’t display it. I want to always read it. Therefore, on my blog, the equivalent of alt text should always be readable. But real alt text isn’t shown to me – the browser is showing me the pictures, instead. It makes sense. And on fedi it only works because the applications and front-ends don&rsquo;t just use the alt text attribute for images in HTML – they have an extra user-interface to allow me to read it. Buttons, mouse-over, long-press, whatever it takes.</p>

<p>There are options for this blog, of course. Except I don’t like these options.</p>

<p>I could reuse the alt text as the image title attribute which is shown on mouse-over by default. I don’t like being forced to use mouse and I don’t like duplicating the description.</p>

<p>In Markdown:</p>

<pre><code>![alt text](url &quot;title&quot;)
</code></pre>

<p>I could automatically use the alt text as the title attribute but I still don’t like to use the mouse to read the title attribute and I wouldn’t be able to switch Markdown rendering engines as easily if I hack it. Writing some Javascript to produce extra pop-ups or some other user-interface element would be even worse, and it would need extra clicking or keyboard navigation as a reader. No way.</p>

<p>The last option is the best. Just write the description above the image:</p>

<pre><code>Description

![](url)
</code></pre>

<p>I’ve tried using the title attribute for some of my recent picture-heavy blog posts about Croatia and I’ve been checking the result using Gemini and Gopher, and I’m not happy.</p>

<p>Compare the following two with the <a href="https://alexschroeder.ch/view/2025-05-17-%C5%A1ibenik">web</a> version where I can’t read the alt text. (Screenshots from <a href="https://gmi.skyjake.fi/lagrange/">Lagrange</a> on my phone.)</p>

<p>The <a href="gemini://alexschroeder.ch/2025-05-17-šibenik">Gemini</a> version looks OK with some text paragraphs being links to the images.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The <a href="gopher://alexschroeder.ch/02025-05-17-šibenik">Gopher</a> version shows the alt texts as weird disjointed text paragraphs that sometimes repeat the preceding paragraph and sometimes don’t.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I guess I could write longer alt texts until the Gopher version looks good but then the Gemini version looks weird and the web version continues to not show it.</p>

<p>Now check the Gemini and Gopher output for the page you’re reading right now!</p>

<p>The <a href="gopher://alexschroeder.ch/02025-05-27-alt-text">Gopher</a> version is OK. The line-breaks don’t look nice on the phone at the default resolution so ignore that weird line-break. What we can see is that the empty alt text generated an empty paragraph. Something I should fix. 😅 But in general, it looks OK and reads well.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-3.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The <a href="gemini://alexschroeder.ch/2025-05-27-alt-text">Gemini</a> version still looks OK. It also links to the Gopher and Gemini versions, so ignore those extra links. 😅 The browser substitutes the filenames for the missing alt text. That works for me. I&rsquo;m not sure what a screen reader would do. Probably say: &ldquo;Image. 2025-05-27-alt-text-3.jpg&rdquo;? And I&rsquo;m not sure what a person with bad sight would prefer. At this point I&rsquo;d know that I can skip the image since I have already read the description above.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-4.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>And here&rsquo;s the same passage a day later, using the text browser <code>lynx</code>. The inline links look good, and there&rsquo;s no trace of the screenshots. This is great! It&rsquo;s as readable as the Gopher version with no extra line-breaks, and the inline links are inline (unlike in the Gemini version).</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-5.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Checking with <code>edbrowse</code>. The inline links are wrapped in bracers, which looks good, and the images with no alt text are shown as empty square brackets (<code>[]</code>) which works for me. Ideally, I guess, they&rsquo;d just disappear.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-6.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>All in all, I think this solution is better: Instead of alt text, just write more text above each image.</p>

<p>What I’m less sure about is whether this automatically implies that all images are “decorative” and therefore should have an empty alt text (instead of no alt text). It seems to me that the filename being shown is a lot of visual clutter, but that only seems to affect Gemini, not the text browser.</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Web">#Web</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Gemini">#Gemini</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Gopher">#Gopher</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Markdown">#Markdown</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23JavaScript">#JavaScript</a></p>

<p><strong>2025-05-29</strong>. I fixed that minor issue in <a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/markdown-gopher.git/">markdown-gopher</a> so that it skips paragraphs containing just images with no alt text. 😄</p>

<p><strong>2025-05-31</strong>. I added a piece of Javascript to copy the alt text to the title attribute if the alt text is set and the title is not. Perhaps that&rsquo;ll motivate me to add more alt text.</p>

<p>This is what I added to my <code>view.html</code> template for <a href="Odd%CE%BC">Oddμ</a>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
function addTitle() {
  const images = document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;img&quot;);
  for (let img of images) {
    const alt = img.getAttribute(&quot;alt&quot;);
    const title = img.getAttribute(&quot;title&quot;);
    if (alt != null &amp;&amp; title == null) {
      img.setAttribute(&quot;title&quot;, alt);
    }
  }
}
window.addEventListener('load', addTitle);
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>2025-06-09</strong>. Tweaked the JavaScript. I&rsquo;m now replacing the <code>img</code> element with a <code>figure</code> element, moving the <code>img</code> element into the <code>figure</code> and adding a <code>figcaption</code> element. The caption is rendered smaller and italic via CSS.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-7.jpg" alt="Example" /></p>

<p>Code:</p>

<pre><code>function addTitle() {
  const images = document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;img&quot;);
  for (let img of images) {
    const parent = img.parentNode;
    const figure = document.createElement(&quot;figure&quot;);
    const figCaption = document.createElement(&quot;figcaption&quot;);
    parent.replaceChild(figure, img);
    figure.append(img);
    figure.append(figCaption);
    const alt = img.getAttribute(&quot;alt&quot;);
    const title = img.getAttribute(&quot;title&quot;);
    figCaption.textContent = alt;
    if (alt != null &amp;&amp; title == null) {
      img.setAttribute(&quot;title&quot;, alt);
    }
  }
}
window.addEventListener('load', addTitle);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>2025-06-12</strong>. More fiddling. No figure and figure caption for inline images such as the RSS icon.</p>

<p>Code:</p>

<pre><code>function addTitle() {
  const images = document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;img&quot;);
  for (let img of images) {
    const alt = img.getAttribute(&quot;alt&quot;);
    const title = img.getAttribute(&quot;title&quot;);
    if (alt != null &amp;&amp; title == null) {
      img.setAttribute(&quot;title&quot;, alt);
    }
    if ((!img.previousElementSibling || img.previousElementSibling.tagName == &quot;IMG&quot; || img.previousElementSibling.tagName == &quot;FIGURE&quot;)
        &amp;&amp; (!img.nextElementSibling || img.nextElementSibling.tagName == &quot;IMG&quot; || img.nextElementSibling.tagName == &quot;FIGURE&quot;)) {
      const parent = img.parentNode;
      const figure = document.createElement(&quot;figure&quot;);
      const figCaption = document.createElement(&quot;figcaption&quot;);
      parent.replaceChild(figure, img);
      figure.append(img);
      figure.append(figCaption);
      figCaption.textContent = alt;
    }
  }
}
window.addEventListener('load', addTitle);
</code></pre>

## Generalissimo Trump?

date: 2025-06-11, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I was wondering if Saturday's military parade in Washington was going to be the rollout of the Trump junta, and if that meant the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalissimo">president</a> would appear in military garb, perhaps subdued so next year's parade they can add more features. So I asked ChatGPT to help. </p>
<p><i>President Trump is reviewing the military parade in on a stage in front of the White House in Washington DC. To honor the troops, he’s dressed in a faux military uniform with medals, and a cap that says Make America Great Again. Fighter jets are flying overhead.</i></p>
<p>When I tried the first time, last night, it got halfway through the drawing then quit, saying it violated their content guidelines. So I went to <a href="https://www.meta.ai/">meta.ai</a>, which also does drawing, and it was willing to do it, and even animated it. I uploaded the result to my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1610208569758308">AI group</a> on Facebook. It should be visible to everyone, without an invitation. </p>
<p>I then tried again with ChatGPT and it was willing to do the same task it wasn't willing to do last night. </p>

Using soldiers as a political prop. Trump gave a political speech, lying about protests in front of a group of people dressed as American soldiers. They all appeared to be enjoying the president’s tough talk about the role he wants the military to play in policing the cities. MSNBC should not broadcast this.

## Smartphones are Designed to Fail Us (and We Have to Change That)

date: 2025-06-11, from: mrusme blog

A critique of the fragility and impracticality of modern smartphones, urging a
shift toward more durable, repairable designs, and a call for manufacturers
and users alike to prioritize function over aesthetics.

Would one of the browser vendors work with me on doing something nice with displaying feeds in XML form? I don't support obfuscating what a feed is, that just adds confusion. When I lift the hood of a car I want to see an engine not a drawing of something that sort of looks like a car, but not really, and looks nothing like an engine.

## artdaily.feediverse.org

date: 2025-06-11, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Yesterday I <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/06/10/153445.html">introduced</a> a new feed for great art, 24 times a day. Every hour on the hour.</p>
<p>Today, a version of that feed provides one work of art each day, at midnight, Eastern.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://art.feediverse.org/">art.feediverse.org</a></li>
<li><a href="https://artdaily.feediverse.org/">artdaily.feediverse.org</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Why I did this feed. I'm crafting a new information product, and I want to include a random work of art but not every hour, once a day is enough. I thought it was worth a detour to make the feed that I wanted. </p>
<p>The first work of art in the feed on its inaugural issue was <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scripting/artDownloader/main/data/images/FCZ5y6oWQAU8Gum.jpg">The Countess</a> from Hans Holbein the Younger, <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/365207">1526</a>. It was chosen at random from a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/artDownloader/tree/main">collection</a> of 42,473 works of art.  </p>
<p><div class="divInlineImage"><center><img class="imgInline" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/06/11/countess.png"></center>The Countess, Hans Holbein the Younger, 1526.</div></p>

## Spotlight → MCP

date: 2025-06-11, from: Paolo Valdemarin's blog

This morning I asked myself if I could make Spotlight on my Mac talk to Claude. Just a small experiment. I ended up building a minimal MCP server that exposes Spotlight’s index—files, apps, recent items—as JSON-RPC tools. With that in place, Claude could search my folders, read files, and understand what a project is about. &#8230; <a href="https://val.demar.in/2025/06/spotlight-%e2%86%92-mcp/" class="more-link">Continue reading<span class="screen-reader-text"> "Spotlight → MCP"</span></a>

## Dropping some TLS laggards

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-06-10, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

I was interviewed in it and got to tell a bunch of stories, about how you get people interested in working with each other. I told the story of how I chose the Grateful Dead's music to get the initial implementation going, on both the sending and receiving side. I used their music, since it so totally fit in with the philosophy, ie come as you are, we're all just people. And the song I chose was a good one too, the <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22US%20Blues%22">US Blues</a>. "I'm Uncle Sam, that's who I am. I've been hiding out. In a rock and roll band." Using great art to prototype this connection makes total sense. It says we carry forward our art where ever we go, no matter where it takes us, a great work of music or art is always a good thing to share.

## A CNAME for your feed

date: 2025-06-10, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Here's something to think about. As you may recall, I have an hourly art feed, available both in RSS and on Bluesky. Same content. </p>
<p>Today I gave each the same new name, <a href="https://art.feediverse.org/">art.feediverse.org</a>. </p>
<p>If you use that URL <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/art.feediverse.org">on Bluesky</a>, you go to its <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/art.feediverse.org">version</a> of the content stream. And if you give the same URL to a web browser, ie accessing it via HTTP, you get the <a href="https://art.feediverse.org/">RSS version</a> of the same data. </p>
<ul>
<li>On Bluesky: <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/art.feediverse.org">https://bsky.app/profile/art.feediverse.org</a>.</li>
<li>On the web: <a href="https://art.feediverse.org/">https://art.feediverse.org</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>BTW -- think of <a href="https://feediverse.org/">feediverse</a> as a web of feeds. It's open of course, because the web itself is open. And it's pretty social as you will see. It's why I think it's really the first instance of the "open social web."</p>
<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/images/2019/12/06/dorothy.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I've long felt documents should have their own CNAMEs. I even went so far as to design a system where each node in an outline could have a CNAME. I still believe in this, why not have a hierarchic file system that's as editable as an outline? It's the same idea that works in so many other contexts. It's why the idea of a scripting system on a graphic PC like the early Mac made a world of sense. It's why Unix underneath that same UI was the right way to go. And why the web is so nice, you just View Source and you get to lift the hood and see how it works. </p>
<p>They were smart at Bluesky to use DNS this way. Why invent your own identity system when the net itself has a great distributed system that scales? They just made the wrong call (imho) in not using <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> for their timeline data, or at least the outside world's view of their timeline, in both directions -- in and out. That's the basic idea of the Internet itself. No one cares what's behind your TCP interface, it could be a network with a million nodes using some wacky protocol to connect them. As long as I can get to you via TCP, you're on the net. This is the kumbaya philosophy of the net, why not just use what already works. </p>
<p>You'll see that we're able to do some interesting twitter-like stuff with this duality.</p>

<p>The season has begun: as the sun sets, the Sanseveria flowers hidden deep amidst the leaves open and that sweet opium fills the room. I walk past the door and stop as if running into a different medium. Have I stepped out of an air-conditioned room into a Bangkok summer night? That sweetness takes me away as if I could bury my face into the neck of the love of my life. Sanseveria bloom. You are blessed if you have experienced it. Now is the season of my heart.</p>

It can collaborate, and it has much more broad and deep knowledge than I do, than any human. No one knows whether it thinks or is self-aware, any more than we know whether humans think or are self-aware. For that reason, I think, ironically, there's no point discussing it, we'll never get an answer, because we have no idea what intelligence or thinking is. But it is every bit as thoughtful as any human I have ever worked with. And the whole business about pattern-recognition is imho bs. People who say that are just repeating what they heard from someone else. From a user standpoint, it's absolutely nothing like pattern recognition.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-06-09, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

I went to the <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=dnc">DNC</a> in 2004 and 2008. Both times I heard from friends later that TV had been focused on riots, which confused the hell out of me, because I didn't see anything. There was some obnoxious stuff at the 2008 convention in Denver, we had to walk a gauntlet of ugly pictures of dead fetuses going in and out of the convention center. But in neither case were there <i>any</i> disturbances.

## The game of being rich

date: 2025-06-09, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Some random thoughts about wealth.</p>
<p>Suppose you're an average middle-class person who works for a tech company when the company is bought out for a huge amount of money and your stock is now worth $10 million. It's liquid today. You just received a check for $10 million. What do you do? </p>
<p>Answer: You buy things to see if there was a reason to make the money, and it turns out there really wasn't. You would have been just as happy in the big house in the rich neighborhood or the smaller house in a more modest area. </p>
<p>Then what if you reach another level, now you have a check in your hand for $100 million, then $1 billion, then $25 billion and keep going. It doesn't stop there. At each level you are compelled to find something fantastic that you can use that money for. Some power that the new level of wealth gets you. </p>
<p>We saw in <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=succession">Succession</a>, they played out the lunacy, the people use a lot of space, but they're still just people. If they loved someone or someone loved them, they'd be much happier than all the happiness all that money ever gave them. </p>
<p>Having such large useless amounts of money is a not only a problem for the rich folk, we've found out, it's a problem for everyone else too, because eventually they get around to buying political power and they start using the money to change other people lives, always for the worse, it seems. </p>
<p>We need a new game that only super rich people can play that doesn't hurt the rest of us. I'm not advising anyone to do anything. But I think this is what I've been writing about on my blog since the beginning. </p>
<p>I didn't understand why, for example, Evan Williams didn't just make technology and give it away, after having made billions from Twitter. </p>
<p>Why did Bill Gates have to accumulate so much money and threaten the independence of the open web, a miracle, to get it? Why not use your power to make miracles <i>before</i> you retire, start doing the good you were promising to do later, right now? What good, in hindsight, did the extra billions do for anyone, including Gates? When his power was at his peak, in the 90s, he could have done a much bigger thing for the world, give us a free new level of communication that would be available equally to everyone. </p>
<p>Elon Musk, having done some incredible things in computers, finance, cars and space, had to invent new challenges that only his wealth can buy, and eventually came up with things that only the US Treasury could buy, and some things like relocating the human species on Mars, that no amount of money can buy (or so scientists say). He needs to receive an award of love and gratitude for not using his wealth to make everyone else totally miserable (including himself, it seems).</p>
<p>PS: I haven't yet read <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22evan%20osnos%22">Evan Osnos'</a> new <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Haves-Have-Yachts-Dispatches-Ultrarich/dp/1668204487">book</a> about billionaires, but I want to. He's done some great reporting in the past. </p>
<p>PPS: See also: <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/2000/10/19/transcendentalMoney.html">Transcendental Money</a>, or money that replenishes itself, ie money that transcends time. </p>
<p>PPPS: Another one: <a href="http://scripting.com/2016/05/31/1296.html">Your human-size life</a>. </p>
<p>PPPPS: Ted Turner <a href="http://www.quoteswise.com/ted-turner-quotes-2.html">said</a> "I bet you’re all wondering what it feels like to be a billionaire. It’s disappointing really. I’ve learned that great wealth isn’t nearly as good as average sex."</p>

## New Way to Track Covertly Android Users

date: 2025-06-09, updated: 2025-06-13, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Researchers have <a href="https://localmess.github.io/">discovered</a> a new way to covertly track Android users. Both Meta and Yandex were using it, but have suddenly stopped now that they have been caught.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/06/meta-and-yandex-are-de-anonymizing-android-users-web-browsing-identifiers/">details</a> are interesting, and worth reading in detail:</p>
<blockquote><p>Tracking code that Meta and Russia-based Yandex embed into millions of websites is de-anonymizing visitors by abusing legitimate Internet protocols, causing Chrome and other browsers to surreptitiously send unique identifiers to native apps installed on a device, <a href="https://localmess.github.io/">researchers have discovered</a>. Google says it&#8217;s investigating the abuse, which allows Meta and Yandex to convert ephemeral web identifiers into persistent mobile app user identities...</p></blockquote>

If it takes Apple as long to have its own competitive LLMs as it did to have its own competitive web browser, I suspect they’ll soon be paying to use the LLMs that are owned and controlled by others, not charging the others for the privilege of reaching Apple’s platform users.

They could ask the bot to read the bill and call out any provisions that contradict your previous positions. It knows where you stand even if you've never written it down. I've found it can do that for my work. I'm sure it could do it for a legislator. Even better, news orgs could do that for them. Or validate a bill against their campaign platforms. "I promise never to touch Social Security" could be validated against pending legislation. The time delay part of this isn't an excuse any longer.

We can't be lead by Democrats who didn't do everything in their power the four years of the Biden presidency to shut the door on autocracy. They argued the niceties of filibusters, and letting the DoJ procrastinate on cleaning up the mess, as if everything had snapped back to normal. There was huge unfinished business. We never shut down the insurrection that started on January 6. Otherwise we will wait until the whole system falls down for the Democratic Party to reform probably around someone who comes from MuskLand.
