## Visor is the best app for car shopping

date: 2025-06-10, from: Matt Haughey blog

<p>A few months ago my pal <a href="https://x.com/joeljohnson?ref=a.wholelottanothing.org" rel="noreferrer">Joel</a> mentioned there was a new car shopping app and even though I only buy a car once every several years, I love to browse listings or figure what my current favorite car is that I don&apos;t own, or be able to</p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-06-10, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/06/10/gratefulDead.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">There's a documentary coming out about podcasting. I was interviewed in it and got to tell a bunch of stories, about how you get people interested in working with each other. I told the story of how I chose the Grateful Dead's music to get the initial implementation going, on both the sending and receiving side. I used their music, since it so totally fit in with the philosophy, ie come as you are, we're all just people. And the song I chose was a good one too, the <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22US%20Blues%22">US Blues</a>. "I'm Uncle Sam, that's who I am. I've been hiding out. In a rock and roll band." Using great art to prototype this connection makes total sense. It says we carry forward our art where ever we go, no matter where it takes us, a great work of music or art is always a good thing to share.

## A CNAME for your feed

date: 2025-06-10, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Here's something to think about. As you may recall, I have an hourly art feed, available both in RSS and on Bluesky. Same content. </p>
<p>Today I gave each the same new name, <a href="https://art.feediverse.org/">art.feediverse.org</a>. </p>
<p>If you use that URL <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/art.feediverse.org">on Bluesky</a>, you go to its <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/art.feediverse.org">version</a> of the content stream. And if you give the same URL to a web browser, ie accessing it via HTTP, you get the <a href="https://art.feediverse.org/">RSS version</a> of the same data. </p>
<ul>
<li>On Bluesky: <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/art.feediverse.org">https://bsky.app/profile/art.feediverse.org</a>.</li>
<li>On the web: <a href="https://art.feediverse.org/">https://art.feediverse.org</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>BTW -- think of <a href="https://feediverse.org/">feediverse</a> as a web of feeds. It's open of course, because the web itself is open. And it's pretty social as you will see. It's why I think it's really the first instance of the "open social web."</p>
<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/images/2019/12/06/dorothy.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I've long felt documents should have their own CNAMEs. I even went so far as to design a system where each node in an outline could have a CNAME. I still believe in this, why not have a hierarchic file system that's as editable as an outline? It's the same idea that works in so many other contexts. It's why the idea of a scripting system on a graphic PC like the early Mac made a world of sense. It's why Unix underneath that same UI was the right way to go. And why the web is so nice, you just View Source and you get to lift the hood and see how it works. </p>
<p>They were smart at Bluesky to use DNS this way. Why invent your own identity system when the net itself has a great distributed system that scales? They just made the wrong call (imho) in not using <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> for their timeline data, or at least the outside world's view of their timeline, in both directions -- in and out. That's the basic idea of the Internet itself. No one cares what's behind your TCP interface, it could be a network with a million nodes using some wacky protocol to connect them. As long as I can get to you via TCP, you're on the net. This is the kumbaya philosophy of the net, why not just use what already works. </p>
<p>You'll see that we're able to do some interesting twitter-like stuff with this duality.</p>

## Scraping Challenges and Open Standards

Following up what I posted recently about Scrape wars, I wrote a longer post for my company site. Reposting it here just for reference.

## 2025-06-06 Sanseveria bloom

date: 2025-06-10, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-06-06-sanseveria-bloom">2025-06-06 Sanseveria bloom</h1>

<p>The season has begun: as the sun sets, the Sanseveria flowers hidden deep amidst the leaves open and that sweet opium fills the room. I walk past the door and stop as if running into a different medium. Have I stepped out of an air-conditioned room into a Bangkok summer night? That sweetness takes me away as if I could bury my face into the neck of the love of my life. Sanseveria bloom. You are blessed if you have experienced it. Now is the season of my heart.</p>

## Businesses and economists

I&#8217;ve been reading an interesting little book, Price Setting by Truman Bewley.

In this case, it was asking hundreds &#8230; <a href="http://www.enlightenmenteconomics.com/blog/index.php/2025/06/businesses-and-economists/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>

Zoom in to satellitemap.space. The vast majority of low orbit satellites are Starlink&#39;s.

Idea for teachers. Allow students to use ChatGPT to write their papers, as long as they submit a log showing how they did it. Maybe they're getting help with writing, but the ideas are theirs? It might be possible to fake that part too, but for now, that's probably a bit too hard.

## 2025-05-27 Alt text on this blog

date: 2025-06-09, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-05-27-alt-text-on-this-blog">2025-05-27 Alt text on this blog</h1>

<p>On the web, the alt text is a description of an image to be shown by browsers when the image cannot be shown – like text browsers or screen readers. So what about alt text on this blog? What about blog posts full of photos, specifically? Like the <a href="Croatia">Croatia</a> posts.</p>

<p>I think that alt text should be unnecessary on my blog because the text should carry the entire message. “Welcome to my <a href="Wall_of_Text">Wall of Text</a>!” 😄</p>

<p>On fedi, I like alt text and I both read and write it. I hate clients that don’t display it. I want to always read it. Therefore, on my blog, the equivalent of alt text should always be readable. But real alt text isn’t shown to me – the browser is showing me the pictures, instead. It makes sense. And on fedi it only works because the applications and front-ends don&rsquo;t just use the alt text attribute for images in HTML – they have an extra user-interface to allow me to read it. Buttons, mouse-over, long-press, whatever it takes.</p>

<p>There are options for this blog, of course. Except I don’t like these options.</p>

<p>I could reuse the alt text as the image title attribute which is shown on mouse-over by default. I don’t like being forced to use mouse and I don’t like duplicating the description.</p>

<p>In Markdown:</p>

<pre><code>![alt text](url &quot;title&quot;)
</code></pre>

<p>I could automatically use the alt text as the title attribute but I still don’t like to use the mouse to read the title attribute and I wouldn’t be able to switch Markdown rendering engines as easily if I hack it. Writing some Javascript to produce extra pop-ups or some other user-interface element would be even worse, and it would need extra clicking or keyboard navigation as a reader. No way.</p>

<p>The last option is the best. Just write the description above the image:</p>

<pre><code>Description

![](url)
</code></pre>

<p>I’ve tried using the title attribute for some of my recent picture-heavy blog posts about Croatia and I’ve been checking the result using Gemini and Gopher, and I’m not happy.</p>

<p>Compare the following two with the <a href="https://alexschroeder.ch/view/2025-05-17-%C5%A1ibenik">web</a> version where I can’t read the alt text. (Screenshots from <a href="https://gmi.skyjake.fi/lagrange/">Lagrange</a> on my phone.)</p>

<p>The <a href="gemini://alexschroeder.ch/2025-05-17-šibenik">Gemini</a> version looks OK with some text paragraphs being links to the images.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The <a href="gopher://alexschroeder.ch/02025-05-17-šibenik">Gopher</a> version shows the alt texts as weird disjointed text paragraphs that sometimes repeat the preceding paragraph and sometimes don’t.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I guess I could write longer alt texts until the Gopher version looks good but then the Gemini version looks weird and the web version continues to not show it.</p>

<p>Now check the Gemini and Gopher output for the page you’re reading right now!</p>

<p>The <a href="gopher://alexschroeder.ch/02025-05-27-alt-text">Gopher</a> version is OK. The line-breaks don’t look nice on the phone at the default resolution so ignore that weird line-break. What we can see is that the empty alt text generated an empty paragraph. Something I should fix. 😅 But in general, it looks OK and reads well.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-3.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The <a href="gemini://alexschroeder.ch/2025-05-27-alt-text">Gemini</a> version still looks OK. It also links to the Gopher and Gemini versions, so ignore those extra links. 😅 The browser substitutes the filenames for the missing alt text. That works for me. I&rsquo;m not sure what a screen reader would do. Probably say: &ldquo;Image. 2025-05-27-alt-text-3.jpg&rdquo;? And I&rsquo;m not sure what a person with bad sight would prefer. At this point I&rsquo;d know that I can skip the image since I have already read the description above.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-4.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>And here&rsquo;s the same passage a day later, using the text browser <code>lynx</code>. The inline links look good, and there&rsquo;s no trace of the screenshots. This is great! It&rsquo;s as readable as the Gopher version with no extra line-breaks, and the inline links are inline (unlike in the Gemini version).</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-5.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Checking with <code>edbrowse</code>. The inline links are wrapped in bracers, which looks good, and the images with no alt text are shown as empty square brackets (<code>[]</code>) which works for me. Ideally, I guess, they&rsquo;d just disappear.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-6.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>All in all, I think this solution is better: Instead of alt text, just write more text above each image.</p>

<p>What I’m less sure about is whether this automatically implies that all images are “decorative” and therefore should have an empty alt text (instead of no alt text). It seems to me that the filename being shown is a lot of visual clutter, but that only seems to affect Gemini, not the text browser.</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Web">#Web</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Gemini">#Gemini</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Gopher">#Gopher</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Markdown">#Markdown</a></p>

<p><strong>2025-05-29</strong>. I fixed that minor issue in <a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/markdown-gopher.git/">markdown-gopher</a> so that it skips paragraphs containing just images with no alt text. 😄</p>

<p><strong>2025-05-31</strong>. I added a piece of Javascript to copy the alt text to the title attribute if the alt text is set and the title is not. Perhaps that&rsquo;ll motivate me to add more alt text.</p>

<p>This is what I added to my <code>view.html</code> template for <a href="Odd%CE%BC">Oddμ</a>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
function addTitle() {
  const images = document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;img&quot;);
  for (let img of images) {
    const alt = img.getAttribute(&quot;alt&quot;);
    const title = img.getAttribute(&quot;title&quot;);
    if (alt != null &amp;&amp; title == null) {
      img.setAttribute(&quot;title&quot;, alt);
    }
  }
}
window.addEventListener('load', addTitle);
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>2025-06-09</strong>. Tweaked the JavaScript. I&rsquo;m now replacing the <code>img</code> element with a <code>figure</code> element, moving the <code>img</code> element into the <code>figure</code> and adding a <code>figcaption</code> element. The caption is rendered smaller and italic via CSS.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-7.jpg" alt="Example" /></p>

<p>Code:</p>

<pre><code>function addTitle() {
  const images = document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;img&quot;);
  for (let img of images) {
    const parent = img.parentNode;
    const figure = document.createElement(&quot;figure&quot;);
    const figCaption = document.createElement(&quot;figcaption&quot;);
    parent.replaceChild(figure, img);
    figure.append(img);
    figure.append(figCaption);
    const alt = img.getAttribute(&quot;alt&quot;);
    const title = img.getAttribute(&quot;title&quot;);
    figCaption.textContent = alt;
    if (alt != null &amp;&amp; title == null) {
      img.setAttribute(&quot;title&quot;, alt);
    }
  }
}
window.addEventListener('load', addTitle);
</code></pre>

There is no beach.</p>

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2020/05/28/openThePodBayDoorsHal.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I use ChatGPT for all kinds of work problems, and for a lot of other stuff too. It can collaborate, and it has much more broad and deep knowledge than I do, than any human. No one knows whether it thinks or is self-aware, any more than we know whether humans think or are self-aware. For that reason, I think, ironically, there's no point discussing it, we'll never get an answer, because we have no idea what intelligence or thinking is. But it is every bit as thoughtful as any human I have ever worked with. And the whole business about pattern-recognition is imho bs. People who say that are just repeating what they heard from someone else. From a user standpoint, it's absolutely nothing like pattern recognition.

I went to the <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=dnc">DNC</a> in 2004 and 2008. Both times I heard from friends later that TV had been focused on riots, which confused the hell out of me, because I didn't see anything. There was some obnoxious stuff at the 2008 convention in Denver, we had to walk a gauntlet of ugly pictures of dead fetuses going in and out of the convention center. But in neither case were there <i>any</i> disturbances.

## The game of being rich

date: 2025-06-09, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Some random thoughts about wealth.</p>
<p>Suppose you're an average middle-class person who works for a tech company when the company is bought out for a huge amount of money and your stock is now worth $10 million. It's liquid today. You just received a check for $10 million. What do you do? </p>
<p>Answer: You buy things to see if there was a reason to make the money, and it turns out there really wasn't. You would have been just as happy in the big house in the rich neighborhood or the smaller house in a more modest area. </p>
<p>Then what if you reach another level, now you have a check in your hand for $100 million, then $1 billion, then $25 billion and keep going. It doesn't stop there. At each level you are compelled to find something fantastic that you can use that money for. Some power that the new level of wealth gets you. </p>
<p>We saw in <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=succession">Succession</a>, they played out the lunacy, the people use a lot of space, but they're still just people. If they loved someone or someone loved them, they'd be much happier than all the happiness all that money ever gave them. </p>
<p>Having such large useless amounts of money is a not only a problem for the rich folk, we've found out, it's a problem for everyone else too, because eventually they get around to buying political power and they start using the money to change other people lives, always for the worse, it seems. </p>
<p>We need a new game that only super rich people can play that doesn't hurt the rest of us. I'm not advising anyone to do anything. But I think this is what I've been writing about on my blog since the beginning. </p>
<p>I didn't understand why, for example, Evan Williams didn't just make technology and give it away, after having made billions from Twitter. </p>
<p>Why did Bill Gates have to accumulate so much money and threaten the independence of the open web, a miracle, to get it? Why not use your power to make miracles <i>before</i> you retire, start doing the good you were promising to do later, right now? What good, in hindsight, did the extra billions do for anyone, including Gates? When his power was at his peak, in the 90s, he could have done a much bigger thing for the world, give us a free new level of communication that would be available equally to everyone. </p>
<p>Elon Musk, having done some incredible things in computers, finance, cars and space, had to invent new challenges that only his wealth can buy, and eventually came up with things that only the US Treasury could buy, and some things like relocating the human species on Mars, that no amount of money can buy (or so scientists say). He needs to receive an award of love and gratitude for not using his wealth to make everyone else totally miserable (including himself, it seems).</p>
<p>PS: I haven't yet read <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22evan%20osnos%22">Evan Osnos'</a> new <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Haves-Have-Yachts-Dispatches-Ultrarich/dp/1668204487">book</a> about billionaires, but I want to. He's done some great reporting in the past. </p>
<p>PPS: See also: <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/2000/10/19/transcendentalMoney.html">Transcendental Money</a>, or money that replenishes itself, ie money that transcends time. </p>
<p>PPPS: Another one: <a href="http://scripting.com/2016/05/31/1296.html">Your human-size life</a>. </p>
<p>PPPPS: Ted Turner <a href="http://www.quoteswise.com/ted-turner-quotes-2.html">said</a> "I bet you’re all wondering what it feels like to be a billionaire. It’s disappointing really. I’ve learned that great wealth isn’t nearly as good as average sex."</p>

## New Way to Track Covertly Android Users

date: 2025-06-09, updated: 2025-06-08, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Researchers have <a href="https://localmess.github.io/">discovered</a> a new way to covertly track Android users. Both Meta and Yandex were using it, but have suddenly stopped now that they have been caught.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/06/meta-and-yandex-are-de-anonymizing-android-users-web-browsing-identifiers/">details</a> are interesting, and worth reading in detail:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#62;Tracking code that Meta and Russia-based Yandex embed into millions of websites is de-anonymizing visitors by abusing legitimate Internet protocols, causing Chrome and other browsers to surreptitiously send unique identifiers to native apps installed on a device, <a href="https://localmess.github.io/">researchers have discovered</a>. Google says it&#8217;s investigating the abuse, which allows Meta and Yandex to convert ephemeral web identifiers into persistent mobile app user identities...</p></blockquote>

If it takes Apple as long to have its own competitive LLMs as it did to have its own competitive web browser, I suspect they’ll soon be paying to use the LLMs that are owned and controlled by others, not charging the others for the privilege of reaching Apple’s platform users.

They could ask the bot to read the bill and call out any provisions that contradict your previous positions. It knows where you stand even if you've never written it down. I've found it can do that for my work. I'm sure it could do it for a legislator. Even better, news orgs could do that for them. Or validate a bill against their campaign platforms. "I promise never to touch Social Security" could be validated against pending legislation. The time delay part of this isn't an excuse any longer.

We can't be lead by Democrats who didn't do everything in their power the four years of the Biden presidency to shut the door on autocracy. They argued the niceties of filibusters, and letting the DoJ procrastinate on cleaning up the mess, as if everything had snapped back to normal. There was huge unfinished business. We never shut down the insurrection that started on January 6. Otherwise we will wait until the whole system falls down for the Democratic Party to reform probably around someone who comes from MuskLand.
