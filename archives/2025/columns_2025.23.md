## New Way to Track Covertly Android Users

date: 2025-06-09, updated: 2025-06-08, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Researchers have <a href="https://localmess.github.io/">discovered</a> a new way to covertly track Android users. Both Meta and Yandex were using it, but have suddenly stopped now that they have been caught.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/06/meta-and-yandex-are-de-anonymizing-android-users-web-browsing-identifiers/">details</a> are interesting, and worth reading in detail:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#62;Tracking code that Meta and Russia-based Yandex embed into millions of websites is de-anonymizing visitors by abusing legitimate Internet protocols, causing Chrome and other browsers to surreptitiously send unique identifiers to native apps installed on a device, <a href="https://localmess.github.io/">researchers have discovered</a>. Google says it&#8217;s investigating the abuse, which allows Meta and Yandex to convert ephemeral web identifiers into persistent mobile app user identities...</p></blockquote>

## A Happy Hundredth to Gail Jesswein

date: 2025-06-09, from: Doc Searls (at Harvard), New Old Blog

Today is the 100th birthday of Gail Jesswein, my father-in-law. Gail was the father of eight, the first of whom is my wife Joyce. Gail was a merchant mariner during World War II (when the casualty rate was one in twenty-six, higher than any U.S. military branch), at the end of which he met Bernadette [&#8230;]

## Hating Trump More Won't Make Things Better

date: 2025-06-08, updated: 2025-06-08, from: Ron Garret

It has been nearly five months now since I published my open letter to Democratic candidates and organizations.&nbsp; Since then I have, unsurprisingly, received dozens of texts and emails asking me to "Donate $5 now!"&nbsp; For a while I responded to every one pointing them to my Open Letter and asking them to read it.&nbsp; I was expecting (hoping for?) one of three responses.&nbsp; 1) "You are

## ★ Gurman Says New UI Is Named ‘Liquid Glass’ (and Makes a Terrible Analogy Regarding Apple’s Risk With Falling Behind on AI)

date: 2025-06-08, updated: 2025-06-08, from: Daring Fireball

If it takes Apple as long to have its own competitive LLMs as it did to have its own competitive web browser, I suspect they’ll soon be paying to use the LLMs that are owned and controlled by others, not charging the others for the privilege of reaching Apple’s platform users.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-06-08, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

They could ask the bot to read the bill and call out any provisions that contradict your previous positions. It knows where you stand even if you've never written it down. I've found it can do that for my work. I'm sure it could do it for a legislator. Even better, news orgs could do that for them. Or validate a bill against their campaign platforms. "I promise never to touch Social Security" could be validated against pending legislation. The time delay part of this isn't an excuse any longer.

We can't be lead by Democrats who didn't do everything in their power the four years of the Biden presidency to shut the door on autocracy. They argued the niceties of filibusters, and letting the DoJ procrastinate on cleaning up the mess, as if everything had snapped back to normal. There was huge unfinished business. We never shut down the insurrection that started on January 6. Otherwise we will wait until the whole system falls down for the Democratic Party to reform probably around someone who comes from MuskLand.

Chrome question. One of my windows, with dozens of open tabs, vanished. How does one re-materialze it? ChatGPT says, Press Cmd + Y (Mac) or Ctrl + H (Windows) to open History. Look for a group entry like: “[Number] tabs – [Time]” under “Recently closed” or “Tabs from other devices.” Click it — the entire [&#8230;]

## Juanita Garden Tour

date: 2025-06-08, from: Tracy Durnell Blog

I had a blast visiting five gardens around the Juanita neighborhood 😃 There were 12 gardens on the tour but I think you&#8217;d be hard-pressed to see them all! I started at 11 and was wiped by 2:30 so I didn&#8217;t push myself to squeeze in one more. Enjoyed talking with several of the homeowners [&#8230;]
