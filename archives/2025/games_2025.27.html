Lane seems terrible at interviewing Superman, but is she playing a
dangerous game?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-13, updated: 2025-07-11, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Lois Lane in James Gunn’s Superman cracked me up and annoyed me at
the same time. My initial take on the 2025 version of Lois (played by
Rachel Brosnahan) was that she’s an absolutely terrible journalist. Even
by the standards of a comic book movie featuring a woman who can turn
her hands into buzzsaws […]</p>

<p>I’ve played 500 hours of Elden Ring. I’ve beaten every boss, explored
every invisible door, collected every rare armament. If I had to pick
one favorite, generation-defining game above all others it would
definitely be the base game and its Shadow of the Erdtree expansion.

<p>We may never get a sequel or remaster to FromSoftware’s 2015 gothic

<p>James Gunn’s Superman avoids rehashing the Man of Steel’s origin

explaining that Kal-El arrived on Earth 30 years ago, and has been known
as the most powerful superhero on the planet for the past three years.

<p>Magic: The Gathering is embracing science fantasy for its upcoming
space opera-inspired set Edge of Eternities, which will be released on
Aug. 1. The genre shift required new mechanics and factions, but has
allowed the game to bring back some old enemies too. Vehicles, artifacts
that need to be crewed to unlock their full potential […]</p>

<p>One recent visitor to the Vatican may have pulled off a historical
first: getting the sitting Pope to autograph a Pokémon card. But that
Pokémon fan’s interaction with Pope Leo XIV has another layer, because
the choice of Pokémon card is so, well, choice. On Saturday, Pope Leo
XIV welcomed visitors from across Europe and […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-07-07, updated: 2025-07-07, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>For some people, Mario Kart World is a nonstop cow party. For others,
it’s a slow stroll that’s periodically interrupted by lightning strikes.
But based on the emerging “meta” for Mario Kart World, the open-world
kart competition has been diminished into a droll series of clones. If
you’re in the know, you’re probably playing with […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-07-07, updated: 2025-07-07, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>All too often, publishers pull the plug on video games, whether that
means delisting them from digital storefronts or shutting multiplayer
servers off. The Stop Killing Games movement, spearheaded by YouTuber
Ross Scott, is fighting against publishers killing their games, what it
calls “a radical assault on consumer rights and even the concept of
ownership […]</p>

<p>If anyone can lay claim to the most iconic track in Nintendo’s
jubilant kart racer, it’s probably Twitch streamer Technical. The
22-year-old holds the distinction of having the fastest possible run
time in Mario Kart 8’s Rainbow Road, both for original version and the
Deluxe re-release on Switch. Naturally, the speed demon has been

<p>By now, it’s a familiar pattern: A new Jurassic Park franchise movie
movie comes out during the summer, garnering middling and sometimes
exhausted-sounding reviews. Yes, it has some decent special effects and
maybe a fun set piece or two, but it’s not a patch on Steven Spielberg’s
1993 original. Terms like “out of ideas,” “incurious,” […]</p>

<p>Final Fantasy 9 fans have a lot to be excited for 2025, on the

<p>In 2018, Universal Pictures’ Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom gave the
25-year-old Jurassic Park franchise its most ambitious, startling shift
since the first movie brought dinosaurs into the modern world. Until
that point in the series, the various resurrected dino species had been
confined to parks, islands, and experimental facilities, which hapless
humans had to enter […]</p>

<p>Microsoft’s Game Pass subscription is likely the best deal around:
For a fraction of the price of a full game, you get access to hundreds
of titles every month, some of which are brand new. But when video games
cost millions to make, and news of studio layoffs are constant, you
don’t need to look […]</p>

<p>The second and final season of Netflix’s adaptation of Neil Gaiman’s

<p>AMC Plus’ ongoing adventure series Nautilus is set before the events
of Jules Verne’s classic science fiction novel 20,000 Leagues Under the
Sea, following a young Nemo shortly after he built his submarine. That
gave Star Trek: Discovery’s Shazad Latif the chance to make the
mysterious captain his own. “I had free rein, because we […]</p>
