Mesoscale Discussion 1047
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0332 PM CDT Fri May 30 2025

Areas affected...Eastern Wisconsin

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 302032Z - 302200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm activity has begun to increase across
portions of northeastern Wisconsin ahead of a southward-moving
surface cold front. While no WW issuance is anticipated, storms
could be capable of intermittent hail and damaging wind gusts.

DISCUSSION...Storms have developed along and ahead of a southward
moving cold front in northeastern Wisconsin, with some modest
clearing out ahead of the storms and cooler temperatures aloft
resulting in some modest 1000 J/kg MUCAPE. Deep layer shear
exceeding 40 knots will support some convective organization, with
relatively well-mixed/dry boundary layer profiles supporting
damaging wind gusts with the strongest storms. With the freezing
level being at approximately 700 mb, potential exists for hail up to
1.00"-1.25" as well.

Mesoscale Discussion 1046
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0329 PM CDT Fri May 30 2025

Areas affected...Parts of south-central VA into north-central NC

Concerning...Tornado Watch 348...

Valid 302029Z - 302200Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 348 continues.

SUMMARY...The greatest near-term severe threat (through at least
22Z) should be focused over south-central Virginia into
north-central North Carolina within Tornado Watch 348.

DISCUSSION...A north/south-oriented band of convection with
brief/embedded supercell structures is tracking eastward across
southwest/south-central VA into far north-central NC -- ahead of the
cold front. Ahead of these storms, temperatures have warmed into the
upper 70s amid middle/upper 60s dewpoints, which is yielding
moderately unstable surface-based inflow. Around 40-50 kt of
effective shear and locally boosted low-level SRH (upwards of 150
m2/s2 effective SRH) should support a locally favorable area for
embedded supercell structures capable of producing locally damaging
gusts and perhaps a tornado or two.

Mesoscale Discussion 1045
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0250 PM CDT Fri May 30 2025

Areas affected...Far southeast Georgia...eastern South
Carolina...and southeastern North Carolina

Concerning...Severe potential...Severe Thunderstorm Watch likely 

Valid 301950Z - 302115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...A severe thunderstorm watch will likely be needed within
the next hour as a line of thunderstorms moves eastward out of the
southern Appalachians towards the Atlantic coast. These storms will
primarily be capable of damaging wind gusts, particularly where any
convective clusters/bowing segments organize.

DISCUSSION...A line of thunderstorms is moving eastward towards far
eastern Georgia, eastern South Carolina, and southeastern Virginia.
Ahead of the storms, daytime heating and boundary-layer mixing has
destabilized the environment -- with 1500 J/kg MLCAPE and 40 kts of
deep-layer shear -- which will support some organization into severe
thunderstorm lines and clusters capable of damaging winds, and
perhaps some hail. WW issuance will be needed within the next hour
as convection exits WW 347.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0249 PM CDT Fri May 30 2025

Areas affected...Parts of eastern VA...MD...DE...northeastern
NC...and far southeastern PA

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 301949Z - 302145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...The risk of damaging wind gusts and a few tornadoes will
increase in the 22Z-00Z time frame. A watch will likely be issued
for parts of the area within an hour or two.

DISCUSSION...Latest surface analysis shows a surface low over
northern WV, with a quasi-warm front extending eastward across MD
into southern NJ. Along/south of the front, diurnal heating within
cloud breaks and lower/middle 60s dewpoints are contributing to
around 1500 J/kg MLCAPE. As storms spread/develop eastward into the
destabilizing air mass, 40-50 kt of effective shear should favor
gradual intensification/organization into semi-discrete clusters and
supercells. Enhanced clockwise hodograph curvature (around 150 m2/s2
effective SRH) ahead of the east-northeastward-moving surface low
will support the potential for a few tornadoes (along with locally
damaging wind gusts) with the more organized supercells that evolve.
A watch is likely for parts of the area within an hour or two.

Tropical Storm Alvin Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP012025
200 PM MST Fri May 30 2025
 
The satellite presentation of Alvin has gradually degraded today. 
Alvin is entering an environment of strong south-southwesterly wind 
shear.  Although much of the convection has been pushed off to the 
north and become elongated, the low-level center still appears to be 
underneath the southernmost portion of the central dense overcast.  
A pair of recent ASCAT passes missed the center, but still provided 
useful information that shows somewhat larger 34-kt radii, so these 
have been been expanded a bit.  The ASCAT data show winds up to 40 
kt about 50 n mi east of the center, but there is a good chance that 
stronger winds are still occurring slightly closer to the center 
where there was a gap in ASCAT data. The latest subjective intensity 
estimates from TAFB and SAB are T-2.5/35 kt, and the latest 
objective intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS are in the 41-47 kt 
range.  The intensity is held at 45 kt for this advisory since the 
low-level center has not emerged from underneath the central dense 
overcast yet, and based on the ASCAT data.
 
The initial motion is estimated to be north-northwest, or 335/9 kt.
Alvin is forecast to turn northward tonight as it moves through a 
weakness in the subtropical ridge, toward the east side of a 
mid-level cutoff low located just west of Baja California.  Little 
change is made to the previous NHC track prediction, which lies down 
the middle of the consensus model envelope.
 
Alvin will continue moving into an increasingly hostile environment
of very strong wind shear, dry air, and sea-surface temperatures
that will drop below 26C along Alvin's path in about 6 hours.  
These conditions should lead to Alvin losing its convection on
Saturday, which is depicted by the GFS and ECMWF simulated
satellite imagery.  There are no significant changes to the NHC
intensity forecast, and Alvin is forecast to degenerate to a
remnant low in about 24 hours, with dissipation predicted to 
occur in about 2 days.

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM MST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Alvin was
located near latitude 18.1 North, longitude 109.0 West. Alvin is
moving toward the north-northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h). A turn 
toward the north is expected tonight, and this motion should 
continue through the weekend.

Maximum sustained winds remain near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Weakening is forecast, and Alvin is expected to degenerate to 
a remnant low on Saturday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by Alvin will affect portions of the coasts
of west-central and southwestern Mexico and the southern Baja
California Peninsula through the weekend. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0749 AM CDT Fri May 30 2025

Valid 301300Z - 311200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PORTIONS
OF CENTRAL AND EASTERN NORTH CAROLINA...MUCH OF SOUTH CAROLINA...AND
EAST-CENTRAL GEORGIA...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered to numerous severe storms with wind damage, large hail,
and a few tornadoes will be possible this afternoon and evening
across parts of the Mid Atlantic and Southeast.

...Mid-Atlantic/Carolinas and Southeast...
An Enhanced Risk for damaging thunderstorm winds has been introduced
with this outlook for portions of eastern GA, much of SC and
central/eastern NC.

A mid/upper-level trough is forecast to amplify over the eastern
CONUS today, as a vigorous embedded shortwave trough moves eastward
from the lower Ohio Valley towards VA/NC. In response to this
shortwave trough, a deepening surface cyclone will move eastward
from central KY into the Mid Atlantic by evening. A trailing cold
front will move across parts of the Southeast, Carolinas, and
Virginia. Wind profiles across the warm sector of the deepening
cyclone will be seasonably strong, but instability is expected to be
tempered by weak midlevel lapse rates and substantial cloud cover.

As large-scale ascent with the approaching shortwave trough develops
across the warm sector, thunderstorms are expected to develop along
and near the cold front and move generally east. Latest hi-res
guidance suggests a predominantly linear mode across the Enhanced
Risk area, where confidence regarding greater destabilization is
highest. Damaging winds are expected to be the primary severe
hazard, although a tornado threat will exist primarily with bowing
segments.

Farther north across VA/MD/DE, confidence regarding storm mode is
lower, with some guidance suggesting the potential for
discrete/semi-discrete supercells ahead of the front. These storms
would have the potential for severe wind/hail, and potentially pose
a tornado risk with stronger/more sustained storms. If confidence
increases regarding the expected coverage of severe storms in this
area, then higher severe probabilities may be warranted with the
1630z Convective Outlook. 

Along the Gulf Coast from southeast TX into the western FL
Panhandle, moderate/strong buoyancy and 25-30 kts of westerly shear
will be present. Here, scattered clusters of strong/severe storms
posing a risk for mainly damaging winds are expected to develop this
afternoon. 

...Eastern WI into northern IL/IN and Lake Michigan...
A mid/upper-level shortwave trough and strong northerly jet will
move southward across parts of the Great Lakes during the afternoon
and evening. Modest low-level moisture will limit buoyancy, but
relatively steep midlevel lapse rates and cold temperatures aloft
will support thunderstorm development during the late afternoon and
evening. Localized damaging gusts and hail could accompany the
strongest storms.

...Eastern NM into Far West TX...
Low-level southeasterly flow will maintain modest boundary-layer
moisture across parts of NM and West TX. Moderate instability and 25
kt midlevel northwest flow could support a few strong storms capable
of isolated hail and strong to severe gusts this afternoon and
evening.

Tropical Storm Alvin Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP012025
200 AM MST Fri May 30 2025
 
Alvin is unraveling quickly.  Overnight satellite surface wind data 
placed the center of the storm near the southern edge of the cold 
cloud tops.  The vertical wind shear analysis from CIMSS-UW 
estimates that Alvin has entered a region of strong shear.  The 
initial intensity is lowered slightly to 45 kt, based on the recent 
scatterometer observations.
 
The storm is moving north-northwestward at 9 kt.  Alvin should 
gradually turn toward the north over the next day or so as it moves 
towards a weakness in the ridge.  Only minor adjustments have been 
made to the official forecast, which lies near the various consensus 
aids.
 
The increasingly hostile environmental conditions are expected to 
weaken Alvin further over the next 24 h.  Strong vertical wind 
shear and cooling sea surface temperatures should cause the storm 
to become a post-tropical remnant low by this weekend.  No 
significant changes were made to the latest NHC intensity forecast.

MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1000 MB...29.53 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM MST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Alvin was 
located near latitude 16.6 North, longitude 108.3 West. Alvin is 
moving toward the north-northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h). A turn 
toward the north is expected to later today and this motion should 
continue through the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 50 mph (85 km/h) with 
higher gusts. Gradual weakening is forecast during the next couple 
of days, and Alvin is expected to degenerate to a remnant low on 
Saturday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by Alvin will affect portions of the coasts
of west-central and southwestern Mexico and the southern Baja
California Peninsula during the next couple of days. These swells
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 800 AM MST.

Mesoscale Discussion 1038
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0306 PM CDT Thu May 29 2025

Areas affected...southeast New Mexico into West Texas and parts of
the Texas Big Country

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 292006Z - 292130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...The severe weather threat will increase across southeast
New Mexico and West Texas later this afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Moderate instability has developed across West Texas
and into far southeastern New Mexico this afternoon. Additional
heating and destabilization, combined with increasing ascent ahead
of a southeastward moving shortwave trough, should be sufficient for
storm development later this afternoon along and south of the front
moving south across West Texas. Storms will initially be
supercellular given 45-50 knots of effective shear (per SPC
mesoanalysis). The primary hazard initially will be large hail, with
the potential for hail in excess of 3 inches. Some tornado and
severe wind threat will also exist during the supercell storm mode.
Through time, these supercells may congeal into a southeastward
moving MCS. In addition, the mass of convection across southeast New
Mexico and vicinity may eventually develop a strong enough cold pool
to support a forward propagating MCS as it moves southeast into the
greater instability. As these MCSs combine, the severe wind threat
will increase, particularly as storms move into the Texas Big
Country/Concho Valley later this evening.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 346
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
350 PM CDT Thu May 29 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Southeast New Mexico
  Far West into West and West-Central Texas

* Effective this Thursday afternoon and evening from 350 PM until
  1100 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 85
    mph likely
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 3.5
    inches in diameter likely
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Scattered severe thunderstorms are forecast to develop
over the northwestern half of the Watch this afternoon.  The
stronger thunderstorms will likely become supercells and be capable
of large to giant hail (1 to 3.5 inches in diameter).  A tornado is
possible early this evening before additional storms congeal into an
eastward-moving thunderstorm cluster.  Severe gusts ranging from
60-85 mph are possible with the more intense downdrafts within the
cluster.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 90
statute miles north and south of a line from 15 miles west northwest
of Carlsbad NM to 65 miles north northeast of San Angelo TX. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU6).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
3.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 75 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
28020.

Tropical Storm Alvin Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP012025
200 PM MST Thu May 29 2025
 
Satellite imagery depicts that Alvin has continued to become better 
organized throughout the day, showing convective banding and a 
central dense overcast with cold cloud tops near -75C located over 
the low-level center. An earlier scatterometer pass shows wind 
speeds around 45 kt. Given the improving convective structure since 
that pass, and increasing objective satellite intensity estimates, 
the initial intensity has increased to 50 kt for this advisory.
 
The initial motion is 320/10 kt.  The storm is expected to continue
moving toward the northwest today, then begin turning toward the
north-northwest tomorrow as it moves around a ridge centered over
central Mexico. By tomorrow night, Alvin will begin moving northward
as it is influenced by a mid-level cut-off low. The NHC track
forecast is very near the previous one.
 
The storm will remain within a favorable environment of warm sea 
surface temperatures and low wind shear over the next 12 hours or 
so. Given the latest convective trends and conducive conditions, the 
peak intensity forecast has increased this cycle to 60 kt. Tomorrow, 
Alvin will begin to move into a hostile environment with cooler 
SSTs, higher wind shear, and a drier mid-level airmass which will 
induce weakening. Latest model derived IR imagery from both the 
ECMWF and GFS depict the system becoming devoid of convection, and 
the latest NHC forecast depicts the system becoming a remnant low in 
48 h. Thus, there is high confidence that the system will weaken to 
a remnant low before it nears the Baja California Peninsula.

...TROPICAL STORM ALVIN CONTINUES TO STRENGTHEN...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 200 PM MST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...15.1N 107.2W
ABOUT 565 MI...910 KM SSE OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...60 MPH...95 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 320 DEGREES AT 12 MPH...19 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...999 MB...29.50 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM MST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Alvin was 
located near latitude 15.1 North, longitude 107.2 West. Alvin is 
moving toward the northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h). This general 
motion is expected to continue through today, followed by a 
northward turn tomorrow and Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 60 mph (95 km/h) with 
higher gusts. Some additional strengthening is expected through 
early tomorrow, but weakening is expected to begin by late Friday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by Alvin will affect portions of the coast of
west-central Mexico and the coast of the southern Baja California
Peninsula during the next couple of days. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 800 PM MST.

Tropical Depression One-E Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP012025
200 AM MST Thu May 29 2025
 
The depression has been holding steady overnight.  While 
thunderstorm activity has increased since the previous advisory, 
recent scatterometer data has revealed that the surface winds remain 
generally unchanged.  The initial intensity is held at 30 kt based 
on the ASCAT data, which is also close to the other subjective and 
objective satellite estimates.

The initial motion is 330/8 kt.  The depression is expected to move 
north-northwestward to northwestward for the next day or so.  Then 
an amplifying upper-level trough offshore Baja California should 
turn the system northward on Friday and into the weekend. The NHC 
track forecast has shifted slightly to the west, largely because of 
the initial position, and it lies between the various consensus 
aids.
 
The window for the cyclone to strengthen is gradually closing.  The 
depression is still expected to become a tropical storm sometime 
later today, though the system only has about 36 hours of conducive 
environmental conditions.  The NHC peak intensity has been lowered 
to 50 kt and is at the top of the intensity forecast guidance 
envelope.  In a couple of days, the vertical wind shear is forecast 
to increase while the cyclone moves over cooler waters and into a 
dry and stable air mass. Global models predict the system will lose 
its organized convection at this point and the NHC forecast now 
shows the system becoming post-tropical in 60 h.  Based on the 
latest track and size forecasts, tropical-storm-force winds are not 
expected to impact the coast of mainland Mexico or Baja California.

Mesoscale Discussion 1027
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0358 PM CDT Wed May 28 2025

Areas affected...central Texas

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 343...

Valid 282058Z - 282230Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 343
continues.

SUMMARY...Several supercells to persist through the afternoon with a
primary threat of large hail.

DISCUSSION...A few supercells have developed in central Texas and
have recently started to turn right. The north-easternmost storm has
recently produced baseball sized hail in Hamilton County, Texas. A
favorable environment persists south of this activity which should
maintain this threat through the afternoon and into the early
evening. Eventually, these storms may congeal as they move southeast
which would result in an increased severe wind threat. However, in
the near term, large hail is the primary threat. 

Farther southwest convective attempts continue but it remains
unclear whether additional mature supercells may develop. If they
do, a similar environment will support supercells capable of large
to very large hail, similar to the storms farther east.

Mesoscale Discussion 1026
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0338 PM CDT Wed May 28 2025

Areas affected...Parts of Far West Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 282038Z - 282215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...There is an increasing threat for large hail this
afternoon and evening across portions of Far West Texas.

DISCUSSION...SPC mesoanalysis has indicated that inhibition has
mostly eroded across portions of Far West Texas and some towers have
started to develop over the Davis Mountains. Current visible
satellite data suggests that any convection this afternoon/evening
will likely be confined to the Davis Mountain vicinity. As
destabilization continues this afternoon, expect at least one storm,
potentially a few storms, to develop over the higher terrain. RAP
forecast soundings and SPC mesoanalysis indicate effective shear
around 30 to 35 knots which could support a supercell threat. Large
hail will likely be the primary threat with storms quickly weakening
after peak heating. 

If a few strong storms develop with a threat which may persist for
several hours, a severe thunderstorm watch may be necessary, but
more than isolated coverage and a short duration threat seems
questionable at this time.

Mesoscale Discussion 1025
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0334 PM CDT Wed May 28 2025

Areas affected...Far southeast Colorado...far southwest Kansas...and
the Oklahoma Panhandle

Concerning...Tornado Watch 342...

Valid 282034Z - 282130Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 342 continues.

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms have developed in far southeastern Colorado
and the far western Oklahoma Panhandle this afternoon, with an
additional cluster of thunderstorms moving from far northwest
Kansas/eastern Colorado due southeast. These thunderstorms will be
capable of all hazards, including tornadoes -- particularly across
southern portions of WW 342 in the short term.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms in the Oklahoma Panhandle/southwest
Kansas have developed west of an environment characterized by rich
boundary-layer moisture (mixing ratios ~13-14 g/kg), 35-40 kts of
deep-layer shear, and southeasterly surface winds. VAD wind profiles
from KDDC show some low-level curvature of the hodograph that will
support stronger low-level mesocyclones and potential tornado
development, and low-level shear is expected to increase into the
evening with the nocturnal low-level jet around and after sunset.
While convective interactions in the short term lead to some
uncertainty, the expectation is that any isolated/strong supercells
that emerge from the convective clusters will have increased tornado
potential heading into this evening. 

Further north in eastern Colorado/northwest Kansas, a cluster of
convection is moving south-southeastward through WW 342. These
storms will be moving into an increasingly unstable and sheared
environment, though current KGLD VAD wind profiles show mostly
straight-line hodographs that would favor splitting supercell
thunderstorms. These storms will be capable of all hazards, with the
threat increasing as they continue to progress south and east with
time.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 343
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
245 PM CDT Wed May 28 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Central and South-Central Texas

* Effective this Wednesday afternoon and evening from 245 PM
  until 1000 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail likely with isolated very large hail events
    to 2.5 inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...At least isolated severe storms including supercells
capable of large hail are expected this afternoon across the region,
as the air mass further destabilizes after early day storms.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 65
statute miles north and south of a line from 50 miles south
southwest of San Angelo TX to 20 miles southeast of Waco TX. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU3).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 341...WW 342...

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 600. Mean storm motion vector
29025.

Tropical Depression One-E Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP012025
300 PM CST Wed May 28 2025
 
Showers and thunderstorms associated with an area of low pressure 
have continued to become better organized over the past 12 hours. 
Some banding features have become more pronounced over the southern 
semi-circle. Recent scatterometer data depicts that the system now 
has a well-defined low-level center. Thus, the system is now 
classified as a tropical depression, the first of the eastern 
Pacific season. The initial intensity is set at 30 kt based on a 
T2.0 Dvorak classification from TAFB.
 
The initial estimated motion is northwest at 320/8 kt, although 
there is higher uncertainty in this motion given the recent 
low-level center formation. Models are in fairly good agreement 
that the system should continue northwest to north-northwest over 
the next few days within the low-level flow. Environmental 
conditions are favorable for strengthening over the next couple of 
days with warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear. After 
48 h the system is likely to enter a fairly harsh environment with 
drier mid-level air, cooler sea surface temperatures, and increasing 
wind shear which should induce a weakening trend. The latest model 
simulated IR satellite imagery shows that convection is likely to 
collapse by Saturday, and the system is forecast to become a remnant 
low and dissipate early next week.

increasingly likely between 4-7pm CDT (21-00z).  Large hail appears
to be the primary threat, although the risk for severe gusts will
increase during the evening.

DISCUSSION...Visible-satellite imagery shows a gradual clumping of
cumulus along a front draped from southwest to northeast across the
TX Panhandle.  A patch of cirrus over eastern NM appears associated
with the leading edge of appreciable large-scale ascent from a
Desert Southwest upper trough.  As continued heating of a
moist/destabilizing boundary layer occurs this this afternoon,
expecting additional erosion of convective inhibition along the
boundary.  Modifying the 18z Amarillo raob for lower 80s deg F
temperatures and lower 60s dewpoints, yields around 2400 J/kg MLCAPE
and minimal MLCINH (-35 J/kg).  

Models continue to vary regarding timing/coverage of storm
development within this mesoscale corridor.  However, cloud trends
and forecaster experience imply at least isolated to widely
scattered storm development over the next 3 or so hours.  Depending
on timing/coverage of developing storms, a severe thunderstorm watch
will be considered.

Mesoscale Discussion 0972
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0333 PM CDT Sun May 25 2025

Areas affected...much of Arkansas into southern Tennessee and
northern Mississippi

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 322...

Valid 252033Z - 252200Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 322
continues.

SUMMARY...The severe risk continues across much of WW322. Damaging
winds remain the primary threat though some hail with more scattered
convection is also possible.

DISCUSSION...As of 2030 UTC, regional radar imagery showed gradual
intensification of the ongoing convective cluster across
northwestern portions of WW322. Continued upscale growth of this
cluster is likely this afternoon/evening as the expanding cold pool
continues to interact with a broad warm and unstable air mass south
of the East-West stationary front. The expectation continues to be
for one or more bowing clusters to emerge from this convection, and
spread eastward with a risk for damaging winds and perhaps an
embedded tornado or two.

Additional, more scattered, convection has also developed across
much of the warm sector this afternoon. Given the robust buoyancy
(3,000 J/kg of MLCAPE), some hail and occasional damaging winds are
also possible with these storms. However, the main risk is still
expected to be the broader complex over AR/TN maturing later into
the evening. Given the gradual intensification/organization, the
severe threat will continue to increase across much of WW322.

Mesoscale Discussion 0971
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0224 PM CDT Sun May 25 2025

Areas affected...northeast NM

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 251924Z - 252130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Storm development will initially focus near the higher
terrain before moving east atop the escarpment/plains.  Large
hail/severe gusts are possible.

DISCUSSION...Visible-satellite imagery shows towering cumulus over
the Sangre de Cristos and a swelling cumulus field along the I-25
corridor in a post-frontal regime.  Surface analysis indicates
temperatures have warmed into the mid 60s to lower 70s deg F with
upper 40s to lower 50s dewpoints.  Short-term model forecast
soundings and RAP-based Objective Analysis imply 750-1500 J/kg
MLCAPE across northeast NM.  A belt of 35-40 kt southwesterly 500-mb
flow will support storm organization as storms develop/mature into
slightly richer moisture with eastward movement later this
afternoon.  A few of the stronger storms may attain supercellular
characteristics and pose a risk for large hail.  Severe gusts could
become more prevalent if/once storms cluster and congeal east of
I-25 during the early evening before low-level lapse rates lessen
with the loss of heating.

Mesoscale Discussion 0970
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0215 PM CDT Sun May 25 2025

Areas affected...Atlantic Coast portions of SC and GA into the FL
Panhandle.

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 251915Z - 252115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered thunderstorms along multiple sea-breeze
boundaries will support a risk for occasional damaging gusts or
sporadic hail this afternoon. A WW is not expected.

DISCUSSION...As of 1915 UTC, regional radar and satellite showed
scattered to numerous thunderstorms erupting along the Atlantic
Coasts of GA and SC, extending southward across much of the FL
Peninsula. Driven largely by diurnal heating and localized
confluence along typical sea-breeze boundaries, a few stronger
multicells/clusters have been noted recently. With little in the way
of upper-level forcing for ascent, convection has been largely
unorganized and is expected to remain as such. However, additional
clustering may support stronger cold pool development with time.
This could allow for occasional damaging gusts and wet microbursts
given the high PWATs (~1.8-2 inches) air mass. Sporadic hail is also
possible with the more intense updrafts given around 2000 J/kg of
MLCAPE. While occasional damaging gusts and hail are possible, the
lack of broader upper-level support suggests the severe risk will be
transient/isolated. A WW is not expected this afternoon.

Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 323
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
305 PM CDT Sun May 25 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  South-Central and Southeast Oklahoma

* Effective this Sunday afternoon and evening from 305 PM until
  900 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2.5
    inches in diameter possible
  Isolated damaging wind gusts to 65 mph possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...At least isolated severe storms including potential
supercells are expected, especially near a residual boundary, with

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 321
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1145 PM CDT Sat May 24 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Far Northwest Arkansas
  Southern Kansas
  Far Southwest Missouri
  Northern Oklahoma

* Effective this Saturday night and Sunday morning from 1145 PM
  until 700 AM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
    inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm coverage is expected to increase tonight
across northern OK into southern KS and adjacent portions of far
northwest AR and far southwest MO. Steep mid-level lapse rates and
strong vertical shear will support the potential for large hail.
Isolated damaging gusts are also possible, particularly across
southwestern KS where a potential bowing segment may move into the
region from the northwest.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 55
statute miles north and south of a line from 20 miles west southwest
of Garden City KS to 30 miles east of Grove OK. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU1).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 319...WW 320...

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
24035.

Mesoscale Discussion 0956
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0357 PM CDT Sat May 24 2025

Areas affected...Western and Central Oklahoma

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 242057Z - 242330Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Severe thunderstorms capable of all hazards are
anticipated this evening across western and central Oklahoma,
particularly along a slow moving/stationary effective warm
front/outflow boundary. WW issuance will probably be needed late
this afternoon/evening, though currently there remains uncertainty
on when convective initiation will occur.

DISCUSSION...Heating in southwestern Oklahoma has driven surface
temperatures into the low to mid 90s F, which is at or near the
estimated convective temperature on the 19Z OUN sounding. Visible
satellite trends show an increase in coverage and depth of boundary
layer cumulus, though no true attempts at convective initiation have
been noted at this time. Still, an extremely unstable airmass
characterized by 3500+ J/kg MLCAPE and 45-50 kts of deep-layer
effective bulk shear will support supercell development and
maintenance. Supercells will be capable of all hazards, including
tornadoes, damaging winds, and hail in excess of 2.00 inches. The
greatest risk corridor lies along a warm front/convective outflow
boundary oriented northwest to southeast across western and central
Oklahoma, where easterly flow along and north of the boundary will
result in an enhancement of the low-level hodograph. While there is
uncertainty in the timing of convective initiation, watch issuance
may be needed later this afternoon or evening.

Mesoscale Discussion 0955
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0331 PM CDT Sat May 24 2025

Areas affected...central MS and far northeast LA

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 317...

Valid 242031Z - 242200Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 317
continues.

SUMMARY...A squall line will continue eastward with a risk for
damaging gusts and isolated hail this afternoon/evening.

DISCUSSION...Across WW317, gradual intensification of the prior line
of storms has been noted this afternoon. The environment remains
favorable for a continued severe risk with moderate to large
buoyancy and 30-40 kt of effective shear. This suggests the severe
threat will continue eastward with a primary risk for damaging
gusts. This is well corroborated by recent reports of damaging gusts
across MS and LA. Some isolated hail may also be possible,
especially with storms developing ahead of the line along the
baroclinic zone. Given the broadly favorable environment and
organized line, the severe risk will continue across much of WW317
into this evening.

Mesoscale Discussion 0954
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0221 PM CDT Sat May 24 2025

Areas affected...parts of south Florida

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 241921Z - 242115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated damaging gusts and hail are possible with
scattered storms this afternoon. A WW is not expected.

DISCUSSION...Across parts of south FL, strong diurnal heating atop
seasonably deep moisture has eroded any remaining morning
inhibition. Scattered thunderstorms have initiated along the typical
diurnal sea breeze boundaries and should continue to do so through
this afternoon. Despite weak background ascent, 2500 J/kg of MLCAPE
from the MFL sounding suggests a few robust updrafts will develop. A
few of these stronger storms may eventually result in one or more
clusters as outflow gradually consolidates. Modest deep-layer shear
should support some updraft organization, and isolated hail/wind
gusts appear possible with any of the stronger cores that sustain.
Given the lack of broader forcing and relatively limited shear, a
broader severe risk worthy of a WW appears unlikely at this time.
