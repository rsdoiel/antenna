## This is the fun electric moped Harley‑Davidson designed and almost built

date: 2025-07-11, from: Electrek Feed

But instead, it was shelved, leaving a gaping hole in a market that’s now bursting with demand for just this kind of ride.</p>

## Lectric XP Trike2 launched as the affordable new electric trike every senior needs!

date: 2025-07-08, from: Electrek Feed

<div class="feat-image"><img src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/07/lectric-xp-trike2-header-1.jpg?quality=82&#038;strip=all&#038;w=1600" /></div><p>The new <a href="https://lectricebikes.sjv.io/Z6e6zR">Lectric XP Trike2</a>, just unveiled today, is the hands-down winner in the best-bang-for-your-buck category of electric trikes. And as perhaps the longest-running electric bike reviewer in the industry, I can say that with confidence. I’ve seen a lot of electric bikes in my time. I’ve spent a lot of butt-in-saddle hours on e-trikes. But I’ve never before seen a value like this roll by on three wheels.</p>



<p>As an able-bodied, mid-30s electric bike rider (and writer), I’ll be the first to say that electric trikes aren’t just for older folks. They’re fun e-bikes in their own right. But let’s face it – the vast majority of the market for electric three-wheelers are those who just aren’t as comfortable on two wheels due to age, accessibility, or other reasons. And so if you’re a senior or otherwise on the hunt for a fun and affordable electric trike, the Lectric XP Trike2 is probably the one you’re going to end up getting, and deservingly so!</p>
