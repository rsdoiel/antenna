<p>date: 2025-04-07, updated: 2025-04-07, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>

In “<a href="https://www.schneier.com/books/secrets-and-lies/">Secrets
and Lies</a>” (2000), I wrote:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
It is poor civic hygiene to install technologies that could someday
facilitate a police state.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It’s something a bunch of us were saying at the time, in reference to
the vast NSA’s surveillance capabilities.
</p>
<p>
I have been thinking of that quote a lot as I read <a>news</a>

<p>
It’s an old joke in the DJ community about upcoming artists having a bad
reputation for pushing the audio signal into the red. Red is bad because
it results in the audio signal being clipped and the mix sounding muddy.

<p>I wonder when ChatGPT or Claude.ai will compete with Wikipedia. I
think Wikipedia is great but it has always had a weakness in that it can
be manipulated to tell a story from a very limited point of view. For
example the RSS page has a long section explaining the benefits of Atom.
What I like about the AI versions of the basic history of things is that
it isn’t so easily manipulated. I talked about this with Claude, and
asked it to write up a <a href="https://this.how/claudewiki/">proposal
for ClaudeWiki</a>, a Wikipedia workalike, not too expensive to run,
make it part of a user’s $20 per month subscription. I think it would be
useful, if only as a demo how Wikipedia itself might improve its
service.</p>

<p>If I were designing a social network, I would implement replies
differently. When you reply to a post, only the person who wrote the
post sees it. If they want they can RT it. The way it works now on all
twitter-like systems means most of the replies are basically spam,
people using your post as a way to reach people who follow you.</p>

<p>I like people who stand up and speak the truth. This is one of the
silver linings of this crisis. There’s no real advantage at this point
in trying to play it safe, to not be noticed. So I like what Chris
Murphy, Senator from Connecticut has been saying.</p>

<p>I used to tell friends you can’t go wrong buying the S&amp;P 500. The
president is rated by now the stock market does, and so over the long
haul you can expect steady growth from the S&amp;P 500, and it keeps
things really simple. Well, have to say – that’s no longer good advice.
Maybe real estate? Outside the United States? I don’t know. It depends
on what the people of this country do, and if our representatives are
listening.</p>
