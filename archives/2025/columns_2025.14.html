<p>date: 2025-04-07, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2025-04-07-galène-was-comparatively-easy-to-setup">
2025-04-07 Galène was comparatively easy to setup
</h1>
<p>
I remember how tricky the Jitsi setup was, at the time. When we used it,
system load for my small server jumped up to seven or eight. And in the
end, we all ended up on Discord. But with Discord showing annoying ads
even to paying customers, I’m taking another look at the alternatives.
</p>
<p>
From my point of view, <a href="https://galene.org/">Galène</a> has the
benefits of requiring just a single binary for installation. Sure,
deployment is trickier, but in typical Go fashion, you get a huge binary
that you copy over to the server and you’re essentially ready to test
it.
</p>
<p>
So what did I do?
</p>
<p>
I created a system user <code>galene</code> with home directory
<code>/home/galene</code>. There is no <code>galene</code> group.
</p>
<p>
This is where the binary lives.
</p>
<p>
I copied the example <code>galene.service</code>
<a href="https://galene.org/INSTALL.html#:~:text=systemd">from the
website</a> and adapted it (by changing <code>Group=galene</code> to
<code>Group=nogroup</code>).
</p>
<p>
My Galène installation does not live behind a reverse proxy, so there is
no logging of bots trying to access it. Perhaps a problem to solve for
later.
</p>
<p>
I had to add a bunch of lines to my <code>/etc/apache2/hook.sh</code>
that runs whenever <code>mod_md</code> gets new certificates. When that
happens, Galène also gets a copy, with permissions set appropriately.
And it gets restarted.
</p>
<p>
I created a JSON file to define a single group, making me the operator
(with a password), and allowing
<a href="https://galene.org/README.html#:~:text=wildcard">wildcard
users</a> (all sharing the same password). I handed out this password on
the IRC channel we use to chat and hang out.
</p>
<p>
Should we end up with two dozen people or more, then I’ll write a web
app to administrate these JSON files via the web. Or if I’m feeling
evil, I’ll add the functionality to administer them to an IRC bot. 😂

Clinton</a> makes a very important point. “Republicans in Congress can
put a stop to this at any time.” By this, she means the crashing US
economy. And even if you believe they’ll “never do it” – it’s still the
right thing to repeat this over and over – people should know they
could. This should be repeated until enough people get it, this is being
done <i>on purpose</i> by the Repubs. This isn’t about winning
elections, it’s about understanding who’s doing this to you and how
deliberate it is.</p>

OPML is the native file format of
<a href="http://drummer.land/">Drummer</a>. It’s the reason we chose
<a href="http://opml.org/">OPML</a> as the format for RSS reading lists,
so we could edit them in a distant
<a href="http://scripting.com/2021/01/21/141332.html?title=twentyYearsAgoInPodcasting#a154217">ancestor</a>
of Drummer’s whose native file format was also OPML. I tend not to
change file formats gratuitously – it’s how you can use different tools
to edit your own data. That’s a big part of the plan with
<a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a>, because the internal
file format for drafts is Markdown, you could put any editor alongside
that can edit and save text in Markdown, without a glitch. The idea is
to create a new platform, editors for WordPress, and have them all
interop with each other perfectly from the start. Because WordLand is
the first product in this niche, and Markdown is a very safe choice
these days (understood to discourage lock-in), I think it’s going to be
a perfect basis for interop. Learning from past experience and doing it
better each time.</p>

<p>I wonder when ChatGPT or Claude.ai will compete with Wikipedia. I
think Wikipedia is great but it has always had a weakness in that it can
be manipulated to tell a story from a very limited point of view. For
example the RSS page has a long section explaining the benefits of Atom.
What I like about the AI versions of the basic history of things is that
it isn’t so easily manipulated. I talked about this with Claude, and
asked it to write up a <a href="https://this.how/claudewiki/">proposal
for ClaudeWiki</a>, a Wikipedia workalike, not too expensive to run,
make it part of a user’s $20 per month subscription. I think it would be
useful, if only as a demo how Wikipedia itself might improve its
service.</p>

<p>If I were designing a social network, I would implement replies
differently. When you reply to a post, only the person who wrote the
post sees it. If they want they can RT it. The way it works now on all
twitter-like systems means most of the replies are basically spam,
people using your post as a way to reach people who follow you.</p>

<p>BTW, when you post something on Bluesky it’s just a tweet. These
things don’t need different names on each platform.</p>

<p>I like people who stand up and speak the truth. This is one of the
silver linings of this crisis. There’s no real advantage at this point
in trying to play it safe, to not be noticed. So I like what Chris
Murphy, Senator from Connecticut has been saying.</p>

<p>I used to tell friends you can’t go wrong buying the S&amp;P 500. The
president is rated by now the stock market does, and so over the long
haul you can expect steady growth from the S&amp;P 500, and it keeps
things really simple. Well, have to say – that’s no longer good advice.
Maybe real estate? Outside the United States? I don’t know. It depends
on what the people of this country do, and if our representatives are
listening.</p>
