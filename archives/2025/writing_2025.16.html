Nghi Vo’s 2021 novel <strong>The Chosen and the Beau­tiful </strong>was
so thoroughly entwined with its source text, <strong>The Great
Gatsby</strong>, that it seemed a sequel would be unlikely, if not
impossible. Nearly all the action in that novel took place within the
defined spaces of Fitzgerald’s classic, and much of its ap­peal lay in

It’s one thing to strive to be a <span
style="font-weight: bold;">better</span> screenwriter. It’s a whole
different necessary approach when you’re trying to be a more <span
style="font-weight: bold;">successful</span> one. <br><br>We can define
success as <em>the achievement of a desired goal or outcome, often
marked by personal fulfillment, growth, or recognition</em>.
Screenwriters have three common pursuits — to sell a script, to be
assigned to write a script, and to make a living doing so. <br><br>Here
we offer five easy ways to be more successful as a screenwriter. We’ll
offer proven tips that can help you write better screenplays that give
you better odds of success, and we’ll also offer proven tips on how to
handle your screenwriting journey, which will, in turn, open more doors
for you to achieve your screenwriting career goals and see that
screenwriting dream come true.

Youssef</a> is an actor, writer, and producer who got his start in
stand-up comedy, giving him an ease and confidence in front of audiences
(and a place to test jokes that later make it into his TV
shows).<br> <br>These skills were evident at this year’s SXSW, where he
premiered the first few episodes of his new Prime Video series, <span
style="font-style: italic;">#1 Happy Family USA</span>. He spoke
candidly to the audience about his intent with the show and the process
of bringing it to fruition. He pitched it way back in 2020. During
Donald Trump’s first impeachment trial.<br> <br>“Remember the happy
Trump?” he riffed on stage. “He’s sad now, by the way. I don’t know if
you guys noticed.”<br> <br>This, delivered during his intro of the
series, with a charming approachability and the sense that he was giving
us a look into how his brain works.<br> <br>His new animated show is a
portrait of a Muslim American family living in New Jersey in 2001. (And
if you think you might know where that’s going, you’re right.) But
beyond that, it’s a story about identity and fitting in within a society
stacked against these characters. Youssef called it a “show about
capitalism.”<br> <br>It’s also just, you know, really funny. Each scene
is crammed with sharp humor and blink-and-you’ll-miss-it visual
gags.<br> <br>Weeks later, Final Draft hopped on a Zoom call with him to
learn even more from Youssef. How does he outline? How does he balance
tone? What’s different about animation? Settle in for his lessons.

Your screenwriting journey is all about evolving as a screenwriter.
Everyone generally starts at the same place. As we progress by educating
ourselves (screenwriting books, screenwriting blogs, reading produced
screenplays, etc.), we begin to add to our knowledge base. We build a
go-to tool belt. Then, as we begin to write scripts, we learn through
trial by fire and trial by error. We slowly get better and better with
each script. <br><br>But there comes a time, even after those first two
or three scripts, when you begin to hit a ceiling of
sorts. <br><br>Becoming a better screenwriter is all about leveling-up.
You get to stages that teach you valuable lessons. You advance to the
next stage after applying what you’ve learned. This evolution is great,
but there are a few ways that can help you jumpstart your evolution even
more, catapulting you past many of those sometimes mundane
stages. <br><br>With that in mind, here are five fast ways you can be a
better screenwriter.
