## Apologize to customers

date: 2025-07-29, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kevinkelly.bsky.social/post/3lv4vlgcpkp22">Kevin Kelly writes</a>: "When a customer of yours complains, always apologize first and ask, 'What can we do to resolve this?' even if it is not your fault. Acting as if the customer is right is a small tax to pay to grow a business."</p>
<p>Amen. Google sent an email saying my Google Fi account was going to be cancelled if i didn't do something, so I clicked the link, everything looked fine. They sent more emails like this, again everything seemed in order. I contacted them via support (hard to find) and they said everything looked fine. They also said I should be sure there was enough credit in the account. I wrote back saying that was insulting, I've been a customer for a long time, and have never missed a payment, and they should apologize for the threats and wasted time. I got back a <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/07/29/googleFiLotsOfWords.png">long email</a> that did everything but apologize. They also threw in a little gaslighting, talking about my emotional state (frustrated, unsettled). Companies aren't allowed to have opinions about customers' emotions, esp over email.</p>
<p><div class="divInlineImage"><center><img class="imgInline" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/07/29/googleNeedsHelpWithThis.png"></center>Google needs to take a basic lesson in how to treat customers. </div></p>
<p>PS: My feeling was more <i>surprise</i> that Google, a large company with billions of users and millions of customers couldn't get something this simple right. </p>

## Recording vintage CRTs with a modern Sony mirrorless camera

date: 2025-07-29, from: Jeff Geerling blog

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Recording vintage CRTs with a modern Sony mirrorless camera</span>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Growing up, I remember recording CRTs with <em>any</em> camera was an exercise in frustration. You would either get a black bar that goes across everything, a slowly moving 'shutter' of darkness over the screen, black frame flickering, or even a variety of bright artifacts, especially when moving the camera around.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/mac-classic-crt-line-recording.jpg" width="700" height="394" class="insert-image" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-3a9e56b7-866b-43e0-a82d-b00fec535cca" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;3a9e56b7-866b-43e0-a82d-b00fec535cca&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Mac Classic CRT with flicker line"></p>

<p>Just setting your camera's shutter speed to match the refresh rate <em>somewhat</em> closely is usually enough to make it at least bearable (I start at 1/60th and see what looks least annoying).</p>

<p>But I recently discovered, while recording an old Macintosh Classic's CRT, that my Sony A7CII has a built-in anti-flicker feature that's... actually amazing.</p></div>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-07-29, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

But what about Substack and Ghost? A lot of people do their writing there too? What about those people. Here's the cool part for all people who write on the web. The API we use in WordLand to hook up to WordPress is <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/tree/trunk/packages/wpcom.js">open and documented</a>. They don't break their APIs in WordPressLand. At least so far. You could say that API is a standard. And I bet it would be a lot easier for Ghost, for example, to support a limited subset of that API than it has been to get ActivityPub support implemented. Because the WordPress API is what I would call "really simple," and that's the thing I value most about a good API.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-07-29, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

Now here's the real reason I need WordLand and if you write for WordPress sites, I think you'll want it too. It's because WordPress is like the Microsoft Word of web writing. If you ask someone how they do their site, in 2025, it's probably going to be WordPress. So if someone invites you to write a guest post on their blog, chances are pretty good I can write it in WordLand, and it'll be archived in my collection of writing, and easy for me to find, because that's what WordLand does for writers. So I was able to create the new post on the WordCamp site in less than a minute, and it was completely painless. And that's the point. Here's the screen shot:

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-07-28, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

Listened to a segment on today's <a href="https://www.wnyc.org/shows/bl">Brian Lehrer podcast</a> about how to keep the good feelings from a vacation when you get back home. Here's my idea. Before you leave make a list of the things you like about being on vacation. Take it home, put it somewhere you can find it when you're feeling down and want that feeling back. Pick one of the things on the list and do it. Your subconscious will tune into it as an act of self-love and give you some of the body <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxytocin">chemistry</a> that you felt when you were hanging out at the beach or hiking the Applachian Trail. A similar idea in a <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2009/10/21/bruceSterlingAtReboot.html">Bruce Sterling talk</a> in 2009.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-07-28, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

Everything in ChatGPT is <i>so</i> nice. I just asked it about a random plant I got as a gift, and it gave me a beautiful <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/07/28/deltaDawn.png">one pager</a> with everything I would have had to spend time searching for all right there, beautifully laid out, and all the fine UI touches you might think of already in. It's studying us and learning, and picking out the good stuff, at least so far. The web was like this too in the beginning, mind-exploding inventions every day. We called them <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/2000/08/26/mindBombsForY2k.html">mind bombs</a>. The journalists and social media influencers all just complain, while there is a revolution happening, progress that had slowed to a snail pace, or very often went in reverse, is now coming at breakneck speed. This is as transformative innovation as there has ever been, not that I have much perspective on those that happened before I was invented, but it's as big as the Beatles, the PC, web, mobile.

I’m primarily a writer, my podcasts reflect that, so most of the work I do on each podcast is in writing the show notes. I have a <a href="https://gist.github.com/scripting/69436e223b212315846f5944e0957504">template</a> the writing and audio flow through. Fairly standard stuff, the same approach used by Tumblr and many other blogging systems, including UserLand's Manila and Radio UserLand. Here's an <a href="https://shownotes.scripting.com/scripting/2025/06/23/wordpressAndMe.html">example</a> of a page rendered through that template. We’re doing similar things with WordPress using themes. The idea of WordLand is to do all the block-oriented work once, outside of the writing environment, then flow my writing through it, far away from the heavy lifting. It’s always how I’ve done my blogging tools. I understand WordPress so far has a steady workflow thru the block editor, but these are workflows for designers and programmers. WordLand is the flow for writers.

## 2025-07-27 My One Page Dungeon Contest submission

date: 2025-07-28, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-07-27-my-one-page-dungeon-contest-submission">2025-07-27 My One Page Dungeon Contest submission</h1>

<p>It all started with agroschim proposing a game on the <a href="https://campaignwiki.org/wiki/MontagInZ%c3%bcrich/Discord_Server">Grenzland Discord</a>: A pulp cover gets posted and we propose the title and elevator pitch for the module we’d write for it.</p>

<p>The first cover was <a href="https://www.perrypedia.de/wiki/Datei:PR0780.jpg">issue 780</a> of the longest running Science Fiction series, Perry Rhodan. It shows some dinosaurs, a river, canyon walls, and a flying golf-ball with antennas like some sort of spy-satellite.</p>

<p>I wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh Nugh and the bleeping Invasion: Gather your stoner friends, pick up those spears and travel through the subterranean dinosaur refuge to find the source of the flying drones that keep pestering your tribe. Infiltrate the lair of the rocket men and wrest the eye of eyes from their cold gauntlets and return your land to peace and quiet. A 16 page module for Wolf Packs &amp; Winter Snow and other old school role-playing games.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once the words stood there, I liked it. The premise seemed to be somewhat non-violent. This was a mission to stop some activity, not to kill anything. It was about privacy and drones, which makes it relevant to today. It’s about tech level differences and power differences. It was intriguing.</p>

<p>And then I wrote up a One Page Dungeon based on that. 😍 There are <a href="https://campaignwiki.org/1pdc/2025/bleeping-bots/">two versions</a> for the entry: the one-page PDF for submission to the contest and <a href="https://campaignwiki.org/1pdc/2025/bleeping-bots/bleeping-bots.html">a web page</a> with some old school D&amp;D stats.</p>

<p>It’s no way close to <a href="https://themetalearth.blogspot.com/">Metal Earth</a>’s <a href="https://campaignwiki.org/1pdc/2011/Michael%20Gibbons%20%E2%80%93%20The%20Forgotten%20Depths.pdf">The Forgotten Depths</a>, but clearly inspired by that 2012 entry, of course. Back then I wrote up <a href="2012-05-15_The_Forgotten_Depths">some stats</a> to go along with the stat-less submission.</p>

<p>I feel that a first level group could conceivably beat it: get a suit at the volcano or enlist the dragonodon, approach the tower undetected and enter from above, then trick the only guard. Something like that. And I feel the entry provides enough opportunities for a careless party to mess up. 😆</p>

<p>Sadly, there’s no treasure to be found except blasters, rocket suits and a charging station. But perhaps that is enough.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%231PDC">#1PDC</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23RPG">#RPG</a></p>

<p><strong>2025-07-28</strong>. Thanks for that email, Bjorn! Now the web version has some treasure values! 😄</p>

## July 27, 2025

date: 2025-07-28, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog

On July 23 the X account of the Department of Homeland Security posted an image of an 1872 oil painting by John Gast, titled American Progress. Gast represented the American East on the right side of the painting with light skies, a rising sun, and the bustling port of New York City, full of ships. He painted the American West in darkness, through which bison and Indigenous Americans flee the people in the middle of the painting: white hunters, farmers, settlers, and stagecoach riders. Over the scene floats a giant, blonde Lady Liberty, evidently moving west, carrying a schoolbook and a telegraph wire being laced on poles along a train track behind her.

I wouldn't have opened this up before because of that would let in the weirdness of the internets. This way we can find out what people thought, as sanitized by ChatGPT.

## A Bingeworthy Sunday

date: 2025-07-27, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I wasn't planning on this, but there was a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/bingeworthySupport/issues/5">report</a> that there was a problem with <a href="https://tv.bingeworthy.org/">BingeWorthy</a>, looked into it and was able to fix it. </p>
<p>Source of problem: When I added a feature that lets you ask ChatGPT to review the program you're looking at, I broke the ability to add a new program to the database. It took about 15 minutes to track down and verify and another few minutes to fix -- and now that important function works again.  </p>
<p>As long as I was in there working around, I updated the <a href="https://tv.bingeworthy.org/rss.xml">Bingeworthy RSS feed</a> to only report program additions. The other events it was reporting just weren't as interesting.</p>
<p>I also added that feed to my <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/07/27/blogrolledBingeworthy.png">blogroll</a> on <a href="http://scripting.com/">scripting.com</a>. </p>
<p>I'd say it works a lot better now. </p>

## 2025-07-23 Testing a reset of the one week jail

date: 2025-07-27, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-07-23-testing-a-reset-of-the-one-week-jail">2025-07-23 Testing a reset of the one week jail</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had a number of people complaining about being banned and I&rsquo;ve been wondering whether I should reduce the ban-time for the escalation jail. Right now, if you&rsquo;ve been banned for 1h five times in a 24h period, you&rsquo;re banned for one week. What I f I reduced this one week to three days (&ldquo;one long weekend&rdquo;), for example?</p>

<p>As a test, I wanted to reset all the one week bans and see whether load explodes or not. If most of the scraping has ceased, then perhaps there would be no problem?</p>

<p>So around 10:30 local time, I made a backup of the weekly jail:</p>

<pre><code># fail2ban-client get butlerian-jihad-week banned &gt; butlerian-jihad-week.json
# sed s/\'/\&quot;/g &lt; butlerian-jihad-week.json | jq length
2862
# fail2ban-client get butlerian-jihad-week banned
[]
</code></pre>

<p>The backup has 2862 entries, the jail is now empty.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s watch Munin!</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-23-test-1.jpg" alt="The graph shows the one week jail pretty constant at nearly 3000 entries dropping to zero moments ago." /></p>

<p>40 minutes later. What are you dooooing‽</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-23-test-2.jpg" alt="10 minutes after the reset, the 1h jail already has over 700 entries and in another 10 minutes, it has 850 entries." /></p>

<p>And who&rsquo;s doing it?</p>

<pre><code># asn-find (grep &quot;^2025-07-23 1.* \[butlerian-jihad\] Ban &quot; /var/log/fail2ban.log|cut -c 89-)\
    | cut -f2-3 | sort | uniq
16567	NETRIX-16567, US
17035	NBCUNI-17035, US
19855	MASERGY, US
209366	SEMRUSH-AS, CY
35485	MAILUP-SPA, IT
39630	ASPTECH, GB
7922	COMCAST-7922, US
8069	MICROSOFT-CORP-MSN-AS-BLOCK, US
8075	MICROSOFT-CORP-MSN-AS-BLOCK, US
</code></pre>

<p>The only obvious thing I can see is that Semrush and Microsoft are trying to crawl the site using their bots, one for their marketing and search engine optimisation and the other for their search engine itself. But remember: <a href="2023-10-04-search">2023-10-04 Search engines, the deal is off!</a>. I am no longer convinced that being listed by search engines is in my best interest.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-23-test-3.jpg" alt="A few hours later, the scene appears unchanged. There are four waves of blocks, going up to between 1000 and 1500 banned entries and coming back down again." /></p>

<p>If that&rsquo;s the image, then perhaps the long term punitive ban doesn&rsquo;t have to be that long.</p>

<p>And what&rsquo;s the situation 24h later?</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-23-test-4.jpg" alt="The fifth wave generates entries in the one-week ban. But the cycles for the one-hour ban continues and so more entries keep getting added to the one-week ban." /></p>

<p>And another day later:</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-23-test-5.jpg" alt="The situation has stabilised around 1400 blocked entries." /></p>

<p>And another day later:</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-23-test-6.jpg" alt="The bots were back and now we&rsquo;re at 2900 entries blocked for a week." /></p>

<p>Every day is worse. If you look at the graph below, you&rsquo;ll notice that Saturday morning just after 2:00 there was a huge wave of about 6000 entries that got blocked for an hour. The same wave repeats around 9:00, 13:00, 18:00. And then, nearly 24h later, just before 2:00, the fifth such wave rolls in. At at that point, the bans are added to both the one-hour and the one-week jail.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-23-test-7.jpg" alt="The one-week ban now has 9000 entries after a surge at 1:50 in the morning adding about 6000 new entries" /></p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Administration">#Administration</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Butlerian_Jihad">#Butlerian Jihad</a></p>

<p><strong>2025-07-25</strong>. So now, two days after a reset, I&rsquo;d like to see who&rsquo;s hovering just below those limits I&rsquo;ve set. If they seem to be innocents, that would be an argument to raise the limits. If they seem to be bots, that would be an argument to lower the limits or, given that the system load is OK at the moment, to leave the limit as it is.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s go through the various test.</p>

<p>First, &ldquo;active autonomous systems&rdquo;. On a good day, the limit is 500 requests per autonomous system.</p>

<pre><code># show-active-autonomous-systems --top 3
count	percent	ASN	AS
234	4.54	45102	ALIBABA-CN-NET Alibaba US Technology Co., Ltd., CN
172	3.33	208258	ACCESS2IT Access2.IT Network, NL
158	3.06	12880	DCI-AS, IR
total: 5158
</code></pre>

<p>Clearly, Alibaba is a bot hoster in China. What about Access2.IT in the Netherlands?</p>

<pre><code># 2h-access-log | asn-access-log 208258 | log-request | rank-lines 
    176 /
</code></pre>

<p>Clearly, that is also a bot. 2h is 120 minutes. This company is checking more than once per minute whether my sites are up. That angers me. They probably sell uptime data to other companies.</p>

<p>What about the autonomous system from Iraq?</p>

<pre><code># 2h-access-log | asn-access-log 12880 | log-request | rank-lines 
    164 /
</code></pre>

<p>The same bullshit! 😲</p>

<p>So my conclusion is that the limit could be lower! 😠</p>

<p>Next, let&rsquo;s look at &ldquo;expensive end-points&rdquo;. These are the endpoints I&rsquo;m planning to <a href="https://oddmuse.org/wiki/2025-07-13_AI_Scrapers">do away with</a>, eventually.</p>

<pre><code># 2h-access-log \
    | egrep '\baction=(rss|rc)\&amp;|\bsearch=' \
    | awk '{print $2}' \
    | asncounter --top 3 --no-prefixes 2&gt;/dev/null
count	percent	ASN	AS
27	4.42	7922	COMCAST-7922, US
11	1.8	6939	HURRICANE, US
8	1.31	7713	TELKOMNET-AS-AP PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia, ID
total: 611
</code></pre>

<p>Comcast in the United States seems to request all sorts of things:</p>

<pre><code># 2h-access-log | asn-access-log 7922 | log-request | rank-lines
      7 /1pdc/2024/
      4 /view/index.rss
      4 /osr/feed.xml
      4 /osr/atom.xml
      3 /
      2 /wiki/MontagInZ%C3%BCrich/Discord_Server
      2 /wiki/feed/full/
      2 /upload/?filename=2017-04-07_Worldbuilding-1.jpg
      1 /zoom-frm.el
      1 /zen?action=rss&amp;all=0&amp;days=90&amp;rcfilteronly=%22WikioStyle%22&amp;showedit=1
</code></pre>

<p>Note how only one of these requests is one of the &ldquo;forbidden&rdquo; URLs. But apparently it&rsquo;s also attempting to upload images! Looks like spiders, if you ask me.</p>

<p>What about Hurricane in the United States?</p>

<p>What the hell is wrong with these people? Do I really have these many interesting feeds?</p>

<pre><code># 2h-access-log !^social | asn-access-log 6939 | log-request | rank-lines

<p>Maybe. 😬</p>

<p>Four requests means one request every half hour, for every feed. I guess it makes sense.</p>

<p>In any case, I seems that maybe these autonomous systems are hitting a lot of expensive end-points but in general, they are all focused on feed processing.</p>

<p>The autonomous system from Indonesia looks even more like a bot but in addition to that it also goes through all the archives, for every single page:</p>

<p>Hopefully most of that will be fixed once the forms all change from GET to POST. 😬</p>

<p>In any case, I don&rsquo;t feel like lifting this limit!</p>

<p>The last instance involves banning all the autonomous systems that are hitting &ldquo;no bots&rdquo; warnings. The web server does this redirect for various requests, including all user agents containing the words &ldquo;bot&rdquo;, &ldquo;spider&rdquo;, &ldquo;crawl&rdquo; etc.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to change all my <code>robots.txt</code> files to the following:</p>

<pre><code>User-agent: *
Disallow: /
DisallowAITraining: /
</code></pre>
