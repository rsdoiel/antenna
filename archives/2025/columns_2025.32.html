<h2 id="llm-coding-integrity-breach">LLM Coding Integrity Breach</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-14, updated: 2025-08-14, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
<a href="https://sketch.dev/blog/our-first-outage-from-llm-written-code">Here’s</a>
an interesting story about a failure being introduced by LLM-written
code. Specifically, the LLM was doing some code refactoring, and when it
moved a chunk of code from one file to another it changed a “break” to a
“continue.” That turned an error logging statement into an infinite
loop, which crashed the system.
</p>
<p>
This is an
<a href="https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/sp/2025/03/11038984/27COaJtjDOM">integrity
failure</a>. Specifically, it’s a failure of processing integrity. And
while we can think of particular patches that alleviate this exact
failure, the larger problem is much harder to solve.

<h2 id="underlines-and-line-height">Underlines and line height</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-14, from: Jeremy Keith Blog</p>
<p>
I was thinking about something I wrote yesterday when I was talking
about <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/22084">styling underlines on
links</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
For a start, you can adjust the distance of the underline from the text
using
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-underline-offset"><code>text-underline-offset</code></a>.
If you’re using a generous line-height, use a generous distance here
too.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
For some reason, I completely forgot that we’ve got a line-height unit
in CSS now:
<a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_types_length_lh"><code>lh</code></a>.
So if you want to make the distance of your underline proportional to
the line height of the text that the link is part of, it’s easy-peasy:
</p>
<pre><code>text-underline-offset: 0.15lh;
</code></pre>
<p>
The greater the line height, the greater the distance between the link
text and its underline.
</p>
<p>
I think this one is going into
<a href="https://adactio.com/journal/21896">my collection of CSS
snippets</a> I use on almost every project.

2025-08-11 Upgrading Debian Bookworm (12) to Trixie (13)
</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>
Before starting the upgrade, make sure your <code>/boot</code> partition
is at least 768 MB in size, and has about 300 MB free. If your system
does not have a separate /boot partition, there should be nothing to do.
–
<a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/release-notes/issues.html#ensure-boot-has-enough-free-space">5.1.5.
Ensure /boot has enough free space</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I am missing 34M for boot!
</p>
<pre><code># df -h | grep boot
/dev/sda2               734M  141M  540M  21% /boot
</code></pre>
<p>
I’m ignoring this for the moment. :(
</p>
<p>
Deleting files from the last upgrade:
</p>
<pre><code>find /etc '(' -name '*.dpkg-*' -o -name '*.ucf-*' -o -name '*.merge-error' ')' -exec rm '{}' ';'
</code></pre>
<p>
Purging config files:
</p>
<pre><code>apt purge '?narrow(?config-files)'
</code></pre>
<p>
Removing old stuff and making space:
</p>
<pre><code>apt autoremove
apt clean
</code></pre>
<p>
Lots of reading. Replacing <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> with
<code>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.sources</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>Types: deb
URIs: https://deb.debian.org/debian
Suites: trixie trixie-updates
Components: main non-free non-free-firmware contrib
Signed-By: /usr/share/keyrings/debian-archive-keyring.gpg

Types: deb
URIs: https://security.debian.org/debian-security
Suites: trixie-security
Components: main non-free non-free-firmware contrib
Signed-By: /usr/share/keyrings/debian-archive-keyring.gpg
</code></pre>
<p>
And then:
</p>
<pre><code>apt update
apt upgrade --without-new-pkgs
apt full-upgrade
</code></pre>
<p>
I’m ignoring the warnings about directories the upgrade process was
unable to delete: The ones I did check contained scripts and the like. I
would have felt OK to delete directories with generated files, or files
modified by me. But this? I don’t know.
</p>
<p>
Conflicts I ran into:
</p>
<pre><code>/etc/exim4/conf.d/main/03_exim4-config_tlsoptions
</code></pre>
<p>
This file showed up as a conflict but it was nothing I remember doing.
Install the maintainer version!
</p>
<pre><code>/etc/systemd/journald.conf
</code></pre>
<p>
I had added <code>SystemMaxUse=200M</code> and
<code>MaxRetentionSec=7d</code> because I didn’t want to give the log
files that much space. So I redid those changes for the maintainer
version.
</p>
<pre><code>/etc/pam.d/login
</code></pre>
<p>
I’m not sure what this is about. Did I comment <code>session optional
pam_motd.so motd=/run/motd.dynamic</code>? Perhaps I did. Let’s go with
the maintainer version and see if that’s OK.
</p>
<p>
To do after the upgrade:
</p>
<pre><code>rm /var/log/wtmp* /var/log/lastlog* /var/log/btmp*
</code></pre>
<p>
I noticed that the sway background image is back. I had to add a line at
the very end of my config file:
</p>
<pre><code>#
# Debian
#
# Include all the extra config
include /etc/sway/config.d/*
# Override the background
output * bg &quot;#333333&quot; solid_color
</code></pre>
<p>
<strong>2025-08-11</strong>. The things that aren’t working on the
server:
</p>
<p>
Getting Node.js installed was a pain. It has a separate sources list
from NodeSource. ☹️
</p>
<p>
<em>Solved, hopefully.</em>
</p>
<p>
Services that rely on Monit starting a Mojolicious app via Hypnotoad no
longer work. Monit claims “File
‘/home/alex/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.40.0/bin/hypnotoad’ does not
exist”. ☹️
</p>
<p>
<em>Rewriting the wrappers as systemd services.</em>
</p>
<p>
My local Emacs can no longer connect to the server via Tramp. It just
hangs. <code>ssh</code> and <code>mosh</code> still work, the config
files are unchanged. ☹️
</p>
<p>
<strong>2025-08-12</strong>. Ah, if I start Gnome, my old enemy is back:
<code>localsearch-3</code>.
</p>
<p>
Looking at <a href="2018-05-07_Laptop_Fan">2018-05-07 Laptop Fan</a> and
trying to disable to crawling:
</p>
<pre><code># gsettings get org.freedesktop.Tracker3.Miner.Files crawling-interval 
-2
# gsettings get org.freedesktop.Tracker3.Miner.Files enable-monitors
false
</code></pre>
<p>
The old <code>tracker</code> package is now a transitional package that
depends on <code>tinysparql</code>. Trying to <code>apt remove</code>
either of them will attempt to remove <code>gnome-session gnome-sushi
tinysparql xdg-desktop-portal-gnome gnome-session-xsession nautilus
tracker-extract</code>. Fuuuck.
</p>
<p>
Looking at the man pages, I get the feeling that
<code>localsearch-daemon(3)</code> is what I need kill the processes.
But how to disable them?
</p>
<pre><code># locate localsearch|grep .service
/etc/systemd/user/gnome-session.target.wants/localsearch-3.service
/usr/lib/systemd/user/localsearch-3.service
/usr/lib/systemd/user/localsearch-control-3.service
/usr/lib/systemd/user/localsearch-writeback-3.service
/usr/share/localsearch3/miners/org.freedesktop.Tracker3.Miner.Files.service
/var/lib/systemd/deb-systemd-user-helper-enabled/localsearch-3.service.dsh-also
/var/lib/systemd/deb-systemd-user-helper-enabled/gnome-session.target.wants/localsearch-3.service
</code></pre>
<p>
OK, some candidates!
</p>
<p>
The manual page for <code>localsearch-3(1)</code> mentioned that it was
started by a <code>.desktop</code> file. But perhaps I can just disable
the service?
</p>
<p>
Maybe not.
</p>
<pre><code># systemctl --user disable localsearch-3
The following unit files have been enabled in global scope. This means
they will still be started automatically after a successful disablement
in user scope:
localsearch-3.service
# sudo systemctl disable localsearch-3.service
Failed to disable unit: Unit localsearch-3.service does not exist
</code></pre>
<p>
I’m not sure what to do.
</p>
<pre><code># locate localsearch|grep .desktop
/etc/xdg/autostart/localsearch-3.desktop
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/localsearch-3.0/extract-modules/libextract-desktop.so
/usr/share/localsearch3/extract-rules/10-desktop.rule
/usr/share/localsearch3/miners/org.freedesktop.Tracker3.Miner.Files.service
</code></pre>
<p>
Perhaps it’s that first file. But how to disable <em>that</em>?
</p>
<p>
Ah, I am not alone. With that info I found
<a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=299586">a discussion
on the Arch Linux forum</a> with various strategies being discussed. I
will try to change the <code>X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled</code> line to
<code>false</code> and see whether that helps. And while I am at it, I
will also change <code>X-GNOME-HiddenUnderSystemd</code> to
<code>false</code>.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2025-08-13</strong>. Oh, and I can no longer edit remote files
with my Emacs at home. It just hangs there and waits for the prompt or
something, I guess.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2025-08-13</strong>. Oh, and that annoying Gnome keyring?
<a href="https://www.xmodulo.com/disable-gnome-keyring-linux-desktop.html">How
to disable GNOME Keyring on GNOME desktop</a> by Dan Nanni suggests to
copy the <code>gnome-keyring-*.desktop</code> files from
<code>/etc/xdg/autostart</code> to <code>~/.config/autostart</code> and
append the line <code>X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=false</code> to each
one.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2025-08-14</strong>. The chkrootkit mail I get every day has a
lot of useless information. One looks like <em>all</em> the dotfiles?
Ugh.

<h2 id="choosing-tools-to-make-websites">Choosing Tools To Make
Websites</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-13, from: Jim Nielsen blog</p>
<p>
Jan Miksovsky lays out his idea for
<a href="https://goodinternetmagazine.com/site-creation-as-content-transformation/" >website
creation as content transformation</a>. He starts by talking about tools
that hide what’s happening “under the hood”:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A framework’s marketing usually pretends it is unnecessary for you to
understand how its core transformation works — but without that
knowledge, you can’t achieve the beautiful range of results you see in
the framework’s sample site gallery.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is a <em>great</em> callout. Tools will say, “You don’t have to
worry about the details.” But the reality is, you end up worrying about
the details — at least to some degree.
</p>
<p>
Why? Because what you want to build is full of personalization. That’s
how you differentiate yourself, which means you’re going to need a tool
that’s expressive enough to help you.
</p>
<p>
So the question becomes: how hard is it to understand the details that
are being intentionally hidden away?
</p>
<p>
A lot of the time those details are not exposed directly. Instead
they’re exposed through configuration. But configuration doesn’t really
help you learn how something works. I mean, how many of you have learned
how typescript works under the hood by using <code>tsconfig.json</code>?
As Jan says:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Configuration can lead to as many problems as it solves
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Nailed it. He continues:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Configuring software is itself a form of programming, in fact a rather
difficult and often baroque form. It can take more data files or code to
configure a framework’s transformation than to write a program that
directly implements that transformation itself.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I’m not a Devops person, but that sounds like Devops in a nutshell right
there. (It also perfectly encapsulates my feelings on trying to setup
configuration in GitHub Actions.)
</p>
<p>
Jan moves beyond site creation to also discuss site hosting. He gives
good reasons for keeping your website’s architecture simple and
decoupled from your hosting provider (something I’ve been a long time
proponent of):
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
These site hosting platforms typically charge an ongoing subscription
fee. (Some offer a free tier that may meet your needs.) The monthly fee
may not be large, but it’s forever. Ten years from now you’ll probably
still want your content to be publicly available, but will you still be
happy paying that monthly fee? If you stop paying, your site disappears.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In subscription pricing, any price (however small) is recurring. Stated
differently: pricing is forever.
</p>
<p>
Anyhow, it’s a good read from Jan and lays out his vision for why he’s
building <a href="https://weborigami.org" >Web Origami</a>: a tool for
that encourages you to understand (and customize) how you transform
content to a website. He just launched
<a href="https://github.com/WebOrigami/origami/releases/tag/0.4.0" >version
<code>0.4.0</code> </a> which has some exciting stuff I’m excited to try
out further (I’ll have to write about all that later).

choices, and don’t represent our current knowledge or skills — but we
also can’t develop those skills without trying things, and making some

<h2 id="style-your-underlines">Style your underlines</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-13, from: Jeremy Keith Blog</p>
<p>
We shouldn’t rely on colour alone to indicate that something is
interactive.
</p>
<p>
Take links, for example. Sure, you can give them a different colour to
the surrounding text, but you shouldn’t stop there. Make sure there’s
something else that distinguishes them. You could make them bold. Or you
could stick with the well-understood convention of underlying links.
</p>
<p>
This is where some designers bristle. If there are a lot of links on a
page, it could look awfully cluttered with underlines. That’s why some
designers would rather remove the underline completely.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://mastodon.social/@matuzo@front-end.social/114674911039663634">As
Manu observed</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I’ve done a lot of audits in the first half of this year and at this
point a believe that designing links without underlines is a kink. The
idea that users don’t understand that links are clickable arouses some
designers. I can’t explain it any other way.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
But underlining links isn’t the binary decision it once was. You can use
CSS to style those underlines just as you’d style any other part of your
design language.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://example.com/" style="all: revert; font-size: 1.5em; text-decoration: underline">Here’s
a regular underlined link.</a>
</p>
<p>
For a start, you can adjust the distance of the underline from the text
using
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-underline-offset"><code>text-underline-offset</code></a>.
If you’re using a generous line-height, use a generous distance here
too.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://example.com/" style="all: revert; font-size: 1.5em; text-decoration: underline; text-underline-offset: 0.2em">Here’s
a link with an offset underline.</a>
</p>
<p>
If you’d rather have a thinner or thicker underline, use
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-decoration-thickness"><code>text-decoration-thickness</code></a>.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://example.com/" style="all: revert; font-size: 1.5em; text-decoration: underline; text-underline-offset: 0.2em; text-decoration-thickness: 1px">Here’s
a link with a thin underline.</a>
</p>
<p>
The colour of the underline and the colour of the link don’t need to be
the same. Use
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-decoration-color"><code>text-decoration-color</code></a>
to make them completely different colours or make the underline a
lighter shade of the link colour.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://example.com/" style="all: revert; font-size: 1.5em; text-decoration: underline; text-underline-offset: 0.2em; text-decoration-thickness: 1px; text-decoration-color: oklch(from currentColor l c h / 50%);">Here’s
a link with a translucent underline.</a>
</p>
<p>
That’s quite a difference with just a few CSS declarations:
</p>
<pre><code>text-underline-offset: 0.2em;
text-decoration-thickness: 1px;
text-decoration-color: oklch(from currentColor l c h / 50%);
</code></pre>
<p>
If that still isn’t subtle enough for you, you could even use
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-decoration-style"><code>text-decoration-style</code></a>
to make the underline dotted or dashed, but that might be a step too
far.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://example.com/" style="all: revert; font-size: 1.5em; text-decoration: underline; text-underline-offset: 0.2em; text-decoration-thickness: 1px; text-decoration-color: oklch(from currentColor l c h / 50%); text-decoration-style: dotted">Here’s
a link with a dotted underline.</a>
</p>
<p>
Whatever you decide, I hope you’ll see that underlines aren’t the enemy
of good design. They’re an opportunity.
</p>
<p>
You should use underlines to keep your links accessible. But you should
also use CSS to make those underlines beautiful.

that don’t make it through to the .js and .css files. I don’t think I’ve
ever said that on the blog before. I write my code in an outliner, and
take advantage of its ability to collapse long comments into a single
line. There are whole blogs at the top of some functions, notes about
all the big changes in code, sometimes over years, and sometimes even
decades of maintenance. There’s a
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/blob/main/source.opml">source.opml</a>
in most of the repos with a big comment at the top explaining what’s
going on. Also, most projects have a
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/blob/main/worknotes.md">worknotes.md</a>
file, and where there are dates in the source code, the refer back to
dates in the worknotes.md file. Not always, but most of the time. Some
of the code is very complex, I work really hard to make it simple so it
can be worked on, but in some cases it’s impossible to make it read
casually. But it’s all there, all the tools I use to write the code.</p>

This is not a Raspberry Pi Pico. Despite it’s tiny size and castellated
edges, this is <em>actually</em> a full Raspberry Pi Zero 2W.

Well, sorta. At Open Sauce, probably the most interesting encounter I
had was with <a href="http://jonathanclark.dev/">Jonathan Clark</a>.

You see, I was on a Reverse Engineering panel at Open Sauce, but
<a href="https://x.com/geerlingguy/status/1945207387914178562">I
mentioned on Twitter</a>, I wouldn’t call myself a reverse engineer,
more like a ‘guy who breaks things sometimes taking them apart, and
learns many ways to not break things, sometimes.’

You’re going to think this is crazy, but maybe we should do what the
hippie kids did in the 60s and 70s, giving flowers to the new cops in
DC. Start off saying we don’t blame you, we’ll give you the benefit of

had an hour to spare this morning so I decided for a third time to try
to coax ChatGPT to play a role in a little drama I have in mind. I still
want to use AI to power an RSS feed of news, customized to the interests
of one person (me). My
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/325#issuecomment-3179118706">query</a>
is this: “Create a summary of the news, top 20 stories with an emphasis
on these topics: how people are using AI, especially in education,
blogging, US politics, science news, the NBA and MLB, with a slight
emphasis on the Knicks and Mets. The results should be in JSON format,
with each item including: A brief one sentence summary, publication date
and a link to a source where the reader can get more info. My software
will then create an RSS feed with this information..” The response was
basically: “I’m sorry Dave.” Groan. Here are

<a class="account" href="https://dice.camp/@Ashigaru" title="@Ashigaru@dice.camp"><span
class="citation" data-cites="Ashigaru">@Ashigaru</span></a> mentioned
how D&amp;D 3.0 was really important for him at the tjme and
<a class="account" href="https://metalhead.club/@dereisenhofer" title="@dereisenhofer@metalhead.club"><span
class="citation" data-cites="dereisenhofer">@dereisenhofer</span></a>
mentioned him playing DSA (Das Schwarze Auge, i.e. The Dark Eye). And I
thought about my gaming history.
</p>
<p>
I moved from The Dark Eye 1st ed that I played as a kid and again as a
15-year old to AD&amp;D 1st ed when I was around 16 because a Canadian
exchange student said it was the original and obviously it had to
better. Some mere months later my group switched to the new AD&amp;D 2nd
ed because obviously new had to be better. And then my interest waned.
</p>
<p>
Years later, I got into M20 because of the blogs, and my players wanted
to play the just released D&amp;D 3.5 because obviously new had to
better. With the switch to D&amp;D 4 I put my foot down and went with
Labyrinth Lord – and lost almost all my players. 🥺
</p>
<p>
But I found new ones and kept on playing. So for me, D&amp;D 3.5 stands
for those special years just before the OSR blogs took off, when I came
back to the game.

<h2 id="the-incriminating-video-scam">The “Incriminating Video”
Scam</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-12, updated: 2025-08-07, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
A few years ago, scammers invented a new phishing email. They would
claim to have hacked your computer, turned your webcam on, and videoed
you watching porn or having sex. BuzzFeed has an
<a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/poojashah1/new-email-scam-house-address-sc">article</a>
talking about a “shockingly realistic” variant, which includes photos of
you and your house—more specific information.
</p>
<p>
The article contains “steps you can take to figure out if it’s a scam,”
but omits the first and most fundamental piece of advice: If the hacker
had incriminating video about you, they would show you a clip. Just a
taste, not the worst bits so you had to worry about how bad it could be,
but something. If the hacker doesn’t show you any video, they don’t have
any video. Everything else is window dressing…

<p>It’s reasonable — especially for paying customers — to expect at
least some advance notice of older models going away. But it’s
unreasonable to think that older models are going to remain available in
perpetuity — especially in the current LLM climate, where model age is
measured in months, or even weeks.</p>

<h2 id="session-talk">Session talk</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-11, from: Jeremy Keith Blog</p>
<p>
I was in Nor’n Irelan’ at the end of July for my annual week of
<a href="https://www.belfasttraditionalmusic.com/">Belfast Tradfest</a>.
</p>
<p>
It was the best one yet. Classes in the morning, sessions all day, and
concerts in the evening.
</p>
<p>
There were also some excellent events at Ulster University during the
afternoons—talks, film screenings, interviews and discussions.
</p>
<p>
If you squint closely at
<a href="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/58da46ee15d5db0567e7ca1c/1750803556821-68NZW483810FRP1HALAG/Festival+Poster+-+Print_A4.png">the
poster for this year’s event</a> you’ll see my name on there. That’s
because one of those afternoon events was me giving a talk about
<a href="https://thesession.org/">thesession.org</a>.
</p>
<p>
I’m no stranger to public speaking but this was a very different
audience to the usual conferences I speak at. I had to make sure not to
get technical. So I talked about the history of the site,
<a href="https://thesession.org/help#houserules">the house rules</a>,
changes made over time, and pointed out some features that people
might’ve missed.
</p>
<p>
I also made sure not to speak for too long. I had an hour but I kept the
presentation to just 25 minutes so that there’d be plenty of time for
questions and discussions afterwards.
</p>
<p>
It went really well. People had lots of questions and ideas.
</p>
<p>
Some interesting themes emerged from the discussion…
</p>
<p>
There was no shortage of suggestions for features that were
<em>technically</em> possible, but that I’m probably not going to add
because of they might clutter up the interface.
</p>
<p>
Some other people had suggestions for features that were actually
already on the site …but implemented in such a subtle way that you could
easily miss them.
</p>
<p>
This highlights an ongoing balancing act I’ve been performing for the
site’s two and a half decades of existence. I want to keep improving the
site and ensuring that powerful features are available. But I also want
to keep the site streamlined and easy to use.
</p>
<p>
Thinking about it, this is one of the things that sets The Session apart
from other tune collections out there. Many of them have great content
but it’s not always easy to get to grips with it, at least at first.
</p>
<p>
Still, I may have gone too far in the other direction with The Session.
In trying to avoid cluttering up the interface, I might’ve buried some
features a little deep.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, all of this has been great food for thought. I’m really glad I
got to meet so many people who use The Session. It literally wouldn’t
exist without them.

want to work on the open web with other developers who make interesting
products that we can hook up together to make new products. Or if users
get an idea for linking two products, they can do it with scripting. It
was a dream we had for the Mac, but it fell apart because Apple wanted
to control everything. I find it’s better when developers are free to
work with each other, without interference from a big company like
Apple. That’s why “platform without a platform vendor” was the most
important thing about the web. That and the utter simplicity of HTTP and
HTML. We lost our way in the early-mid 00s when Twitter took over at the
center of the blogosphere. Now you couldn’t just work with other
developers, first you had to work with Twitter and accept its limits. In
one swoop we lost all the features listed on the
<a href="https://textcasting.org/">textcasting</a> page. I am betting
everything on the idea that we can build a collaborative environment
like the web was before, and that the Mac had the promise of being
before that and at the same time create a fantastic

We read the news about universities and news orgs giving in. Corruption
at the FBI and in Congress and the Supreme Court.

No major hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, tornados so cuts at FEMA not
felt yet.

<p>
And we’ve been living in a normal way for hundreds of years. We’ve had
no time to get used to the new normal. It doesn’t feel like anything
yet.

I fear by the time we feel it it will be far too late, by design.

<h2 id="sit-on-your-ass-web-development">Sit On Your Ass Web
Development</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-10, from: Jim Nielsen blog</p>
<p>
I’ve been <del>reading</del> listening to
<a href="https://press.stripe.com/poor-charlies-almanack" ><em>Poor
Charlie’s Almanack</em></a> which is a compilation of talks by Charlie
Munger, legendary vice-chairman at Berkshire Hathaway.
</p>
<p>
One thing Charlie talks about is what he calls “sit on your ass
investing” which is the opposite of day trading. Rather than being in
the market every day (chasing trends, reacting to fluctuations, and
trying to time transactions) Charlie advocates spending most of your
time “sitting on your ass”. That doesn’t mean you’re doing nothing. It
means that instead of constantly trading you’re spending your time in
research and preparation for trading.
</p>
<p>
Eventually, a top-tier opportunity will come along and your preparation
will make you capable of recognizing it and betting big. <em>That’s when
you trade.</em> After that, you’re back to “sitting on your ass”. Trust
your research. Trust your choices. Don’t tinker. Don’t micromanage.
Don’t panic. Just let the compounding effects of a good choice work in
your favor.
</p>
<h2 id="day-trading-day-developing">
Day Trading, Day Developing
</h2>
<p>
As a day trader your job is to trade daily (it’s right there in the job
title). If you’re not trading every day then what are you even doing?
Not your job, apparently.
</p>
<p>
I think it’s easy to view “development” like this. You’re a developer.
Your job is to develop programs — to write code. If you’re not doing
that every single day, then what are you even doing?
</p>
<p>
From this perspective, it becomes easy to think that writing endless
code for ever-changing software paradigms is just how one develops
websites.
</p>
<p>
But it doesn’t have to be that way. Granted,
<a href="https://dubroy.com/blog/cold-blooded-software/" >there’s
cold-blooded and warm-blooded software.</a> Sometimes you can’t avoid
that.
</p>
<p>
But I also think there’s a valuable lesson in Charlie’s insight. You
don’t have to chase “the market” of every new framework or API, writing
endless glue code for features that already exist or that will soon
exist in browsers. Instead, you can make a few select, large bets on the
web platform and then “sit on your ass” until the payoff comes later!
</p>
<h2 id="an-example-polyfills">
An Example: Polyfills
</h2>
<p>
I think polyfills are a great example of an approach to “sit on your
ass” web development. Your job as a developer is to know enough to make
a bet on a particular polyfill that aligns with the future of the web
platform. Once implemented, all you have to do is sit on your ass while
other really smart people who are building browsers do their part to
ship the polyfilled feature in the platform. Once shipped, you “sell”
your investment by stripping out the polyfill and reap the reward of
having your application get lighter and faster with zero additional
effort.
</p>
<p>
A big part of the payoff is in the waiting — in the “sitting on your
ass”. You make a smart bet, then you sit patiently while others run
around endlessly writing and rewriting more code (meanwhile the only
thing left for you will be to delete code).
</p>
<p>
Charlie’s business partner Warren Buffett once said that it’s “better to
buy a wonderful company at a fair price, than a fair company at a
wonderful price”. Similarly, I’d say it’s better to build on a polyfill
aligned with the future of the platform than to build on a framework
re-inventing a feature of the platform.
</p>
<h2 id="get-out-of-your-own-way">
Get Out Of Your Own Way
</h2>
<p>
Want to do “Day Trading Development”?
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Jump tools and frameworks constantly — “The next one will solve all our
problems!”
</li>
<li>
Build complex, custom solutions that duplicate work the web platform is
already moving towards solving.
</li>
<li>
Commit code that churns with time, rather than compounds with it.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Want to do “Sit on Your Ass Development”?
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Do the minimum necessary to bridge the gap until browsers catch up.
</li>
<li>
Build on forward-facing standards, then sit back and leverage the
compounding effects of browser makers and standards bodies that
iteratively improve year over year (none of whom you have to pay).
</li>
<li>
As <a href="https://notes.jim-nielsen.com/#2025-07-18T0946" >Alex Russel
recommends</a>, spend as little time as possible in your own code and
instead focus on glueing together “the big C++/Rust subsystems” of the
browser.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In short: spend less time glueing together tools and frameworks <em>on
top of</em> the browser, and more time bridging tools and APIs
<em>inside of the browser</em>. Then get out of your own way and go sit
on your ass. You might find yourself more productive than ever!

<h1 id="2025-08-07-oddμ-hashtags">
2025-08-07 Oddμ hashtags
</h1>
<p>
I was recently looking at my homepage and wondered about all the
hashtags I used and how not all of them had a topic page. The
<a href="Odd%CE%BC">Oddμ</a> page, for example, collects all the
blogposts tagged <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Oddμ">#Oddμ</a>
(including this one). So I looked at the
<a href="oddmu/oddmu-hashtags.1">hashtags</a> command and figured, “this
is going to be easy.” 🤣
</p>
<p>
The first problem is that there are a lot of garbage hashtags. There are
over 1000 hashtags used on this site! The garbage hashtags are the
result of Markdown parsing mistakes that I never fixed. Apparently the
list of hashtags includes the following:
</p>
<pre><code>#1)
#fennel”
#fudge](fudge)_and_the_[pdq](../wiki?action=edit;id=pdq_&quot;click_to_edit_this_page&quot;)_rules_used_in_[zorcererofzo.
ffffff;fill-opacity:1&quot;)
###｣
</code></pre>
<p>
This is not great. 😔
</p>
<p>
I should fix those, and many more. 🤨
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, the hashtags are all downcased. So given a hashtag such as
<code>#advanced_squad_leader</code> the code would have to infer the
page name “Advanced Squad Leader”. But what about the hashtag
<code>#älter werden</code>? If at all, that should link to a page called
“Älter werden”.
</p>
<p>
And so I concluded that this wasn’t easy after all. I saved the changes
I made on a branch, and I don’t think I’ll be merging that into the main
branch.
</p>
<p>
<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Wikis">#Wikis</a>
</p>
<p>
<strong>2025-08-09</strong>. Well! I think I worked on it and I worked
on it, and then I ran it, and kept on fixing the topic pages it created.
