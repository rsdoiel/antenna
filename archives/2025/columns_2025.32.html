a Little More Context Bro, I Promise, and It’ll Fix Everything</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-15, from: Jim Nielsen blog</p>
<p>
Conrad Irwin has an article on the Zed blog
<a href="https://zed.dev/blog/why-llms-cant-build-software" >“Why LLMs
Can't Really Build Software”</a>. He says it boils down to:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
the distinguishing factor of effective engineers is their ability to
build and maintain clear mental models
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
We do this by:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Building a mental model of what <em>you want</em> to do
</li>
<li>
Building a mental model of what the <em>code does</em>
</li>
<li>
Reducing the difference between the two
</li>
</ul>
<p>
It’s kind of an interesting observation about how we (as humans) problem
solve vs. how we use LLMs to problem solve:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
With LLMs, you stuff more and more information into context until it
(hopefully) has enough to generate a solution.
</li>
<li>
With your brain, you tweak, revise, or simplify your mental model more
and more until the solution presents itself.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
One adds information — complexity you might even say — to solve a
problem. The other eliminates it.
</p>
<p>
You know what that sort of makes me think of? NPM driven development.
</p>
<p>
Solving problems with LLMs is like solving front-end problems with NPM:
the “solution” comes through installing more and more things — adding
more and more context, i.e. more and more packages.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
LLM: Problem? Add more context.
</li>
<li>
NPM: Problem? There’s a package for that.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Contrast that with a solution that comes through simplification. You
don’t add more context. You simplify your mental model so you need less
to solve a problem — if you solve it at all, perhaps you eliminate the
problem entirely!
</p>
<p>
Rather than install another package to fix what ails you, you simplify
your mental model which often eliminates the problem you had in the
first place; thus eliminating the need to solve any problem at all, or
to add any additional context or complexity (or dependency).
</p>
<p>
As I’m typing this, I’m thinking of that image of the evolution of the
Raptor engine, where it evolved in simplicity:
</p>
<p class="image-container">
<p><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/more-context-bro-rocket-1.jpg" width="540" height="339" alt="Photograph of three versions of the raptor engine, each one getting progressively simplified in mechanical parts." /></p>
</p>
<p>
This stands in contrast to my working with LLMs, which often wants more
and more context from me to get to a generative solution:
</p>
<p class="image-container">
<p><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/more-context-bro-rocket-2.jpg" width="540" height="339" alt="Photograph of three versions of the raptor engine, but the image is reversed showing the engine get progressively complicated in mechanical parts over time. Each engine represents an LLM prompt." /></p>
</p>
<p>
I know, I know. There’s probably a false equivalence here. This entire
post started as <a href="https://notes.jim-nielsen.com" >a note</a> and
I just kept going. This post itself needs further thought and
simplification. But that’ll have to come in a subsequent post, otherwise
this never gets published lol.

<h2 id="the-liberal-democrats-in-switzerland">2025-08-15 The liberal
democrats in Switzerland</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-15, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2025-08-15-the-liberal-democrats-in-switzerland">
2025-08-15 The liberal democrats in Switzerland
</h1>
<p>
One of the founding parties of the current state are the liberal
democrats. My limited understanding of the situation is that they were
all about liberty – against the ancient régime (the semi-feudal system
before Napoleon and the French revolution helped us get rid of them) and
against the church. My wife still remembers the small-scale feuding
betweens catholics and protestants. My father in law still remembers
that uneasy peace: going to school as a protestant in a mostly catholic
village. His father was very much engaged in that struggle against the
powers of the church.
</p>
<p>
These days, those battles are no longer that important. And so the
liberal democrats turned to economic freedom. They turned into the part
of bankers and industrialist. They rode that neoliberal devil. And now
as it is faltering, a new change is afoot. Sadly, when they last looked
for leadership, the only candidate who stood up was a xenophobe. But we
already have a party of racists! The Swiss people’s party. These people
were originally more of a farmer’s party but under the influence of
billionaire Blocher they also rode that neoliberal horse. Down with
taxes! Up with the banks! Down with regulation! Down with the European
Union! Yeah, Blocher was a good demagogue.
</p>
<p>
The liberal democrats liked what they heard about taxes and didn’t mind
kicking out foreigners and so they worked together. But you know how it
is: When in doubt, people prefer the clearer message. And on the
non-demagoguery front, there was a strange thing that happened with the
Green party. Like in many places, they had a left wing and a right wing.
And their differences became so large, that the split! The Greens are
now “melon green”: green on the outside and red on the inside. They work
well with the socialists. The right wingers were the green liberals. The
rational voice calling for a lowering of taxes.
</p>
<p>
A while ago there was a session of the liberal democrats where one of
the delegates present was muttering against some decisions in favour of
the environment. “If we continue like this we might as well join the
liberal greens!”
</p>
<p>
Ah, and that’s the dilemma. Those who want less taxes and don’t mind
kicking foreigners around can join the Swiss people’s party. Those who
want less taxes and still save at least some of the planet can join the
liberal greens.
</p>
<p>
Naturally, one of the more famous members of the Anti-Vaccination party,
whose star has not been rising in recent months, wants to join the
liberal democrats again.
</p>
<p>
That’s how far this party has fallen.

<h2 id="an-opt-in-search-engine-xobaque">2025-08-15 An opt-in search
engine: Xobaque</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-15, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2025-08-15-an-opt-in-search-engine-xobaque">
2025-08-15 An opt-in search engine: Xobaque
</h1>
<p>
I’ve been writing a search engine that doesn’t crawl the web. I called
it <a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/xobaque.git/">Xobaque</a>. You
can test it <a href="http://search.transjovian.org/search">here</a>.
(I’m currently having problems with Let’s Encrypt and therefore this is
HTTP only, for the moment.)
</p>
<p>
Xobaque is entirely opt-in and push based: web admins have total control
over what they want to have indexed. The drawback is that web admins
have to upload their pages!
</p>
<p>
I foresee this to be a solution for sites that don’t have good local
search, like <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/">Emacs Wiki</a>, or
communities, like all the blogs on
<a href="https://planet.emacslife.com/">Planet Emacslife</a>. If we want
to rely less on big search engines, we have to provide our own.
</p>
<p>
Technically, Xobaque is writen on top of the
<a href="https://sqlite.org/fts5.html#sorting_by_auxiliary_function_results">SQLite
FTS5 Extension</a>. This extension does all the heavy lifting: indexing,
searching, ranking, highlighting, snippets, boolean operators. Boolean
operators! Do you remember those? Good times. The extension is quite
amazing, really.
</p>
<p>
What Xobaque provides is the command-line interface and the web
interface. Right now, the command-line interface has a command to
initialize an empty database and a command to upload a single page.
</p>
<p>
Here are some examples of how to use this in a script.
</p>
<p>
My homepage:
</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/fish
cd /home/alex/alexschroeder.ch/wiki
for line in (/home/oddmu/oddmu list)
  set --local info (string split &quot; &quot; $line)
  set --local name (string replace --regex '^/home/alex/alexschroeder.ch/wiki/' '' $info[1] | string replace --regex '.md' '')
  set --local title $info[2]
  /home/xobaque/xobaque upload \
    -db &quot;/home/xobaque/index.db&quot; \
    -base &quot;https://alexschroeder.ch/view/&quot; \
    -local &quot;$name&quot; \
    -title &quot;$title&quot; \
    -filename &quot;$name.md&quot;
end
</code></pre>
<p>
(The index file grows from nearly zero to about 40M.)
</p>
<p>
Emacs Wiki:
</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/fish
for path in (grep --files-without-match '^#FILE ' /home/alex/emacswiki/git/* /home/alex/emacswiki/git/.*)
  set --local name (string replace '/home/alex/emacswiki/git/' '' $path)
  set --local title (string replace '_' ' ' $name)
  /home/xobaque/xobaque upload \
    -db &quot;/home/xobaque/index.db&quot; \
    -base &quot;https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/&quot; \
    -local &quot;$name&quot; \
    -title &quot;$title&quot; \
    -filename &quot;/home/alex/emacswiki/git/$name&quot;
end
</code></pre>
<p>
(The index file grows from about 40M to 290M.)
</p>
<p>
The alternative to uploading via the command-line, I think, will be feed
ingestion. Web site owners can send their feeds to Xobaque and it will
index the entries in the feed. If the entries have the full text, that’s
great. If they have an excerpt, that works, too. You opt-in with
whatever you provide.
</p>
<p>
I’m assuming that this will be a system for friends only, so the upload
will be protected by a login. Otherwise, people will be able to upload
other people’s sites and that violates the opt-in idea.

<strong>2025-08-15</strong>. I have that vague idea that it would
process OPML files like the
<a href="https://planet.emacslife.com/opml.xml">Planet Emacslife
OPML</a> or the three RPG Planet OPML files,
<a href="https://campaignwiki.org/rpg/indie.opml">Indie</a>,
<a href="https://campaignwiki.org/rpg/osr.opml">OSR</a> and
<a href="https://campaignwiki.org/rpg/other.opml">Other</a>. From the
OPML files Xobaque would know a bunch of feeds which it could then use
for updates. I have written
<a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/planet-jupiter.git/">Planet
Jupiter</a>, so I know that from 80% to 90% is handling blogs that are
down and from 90% to 100% it’s all about fiddling with the markup…
There’s also the question of consent. So perhaps one would have to start
a new list of feeds for those people who explicitly consent. And if by
chance that covers all the feeds on Planet Emacslife or RPG Planet
that’d be a reason to laugh and party! 🎉

I realized that sometimes in software I’m climbing a cliff that’s too
tall to climb in one session, so I have to carry a tent and backpack
with food and water. I hate this kind of programming more than anything,
because it comes from not having a high-level enough runtime to support
me in big corner turns. Or not having invested enough time in creating a
layer I can build on. Anyway I’m in the middle of one of those
corner-turns now. Hell has not broken loose although at times it looks
like it might have. I’m being sure not to create another mess that needs
to be cleaned up in the future. Not stressful, but I’d rather be doing
anything but this. :-)</p>

mentioned him playing DSA (Das Schwarze Auge, i.e. The Dark Eye). And I
thought about my gaming history.
</p>
<p>
I moved from The Dark Eye 1st ed that I played as a kid and again as a
15-year old to AD&amp;D 1st ed when I was around 16 because a Canadian
exchange student said it was the original and obviously it had to
better. Some mere months later my group switched to the new AD&amp;D 2nd
ed because obviously new had to be better. And then my interest waned.
</p>
<p>
Years later, I got into M20 because of the blogs, and my players wanted
to play the just released D&amp;D 3.5 because obviously new had to
better. With the switch to D&amp;D 4 I put my foot down and went with
Labyrinth Lord – and lost almost all my players. 🥺
</p>
<p>
But I found new ones and kept on playing. So for me, D&amp;D 3.5 stands
for those special years just before the OSR blogs took off, when I came
back to the game.

<p>date: 2025-08-15, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog</p>
<p>Today, flanked by California’s Democratic elected officials and union
leaders, California governor Gavin Newsom responded to Trump’s attempt
to strongarm the Texas legislature into redistricting the state to give
Trump the five additional congressional representatives to which he
feels “entitled.” Newsom announced that California will hold a special
election on November 4 for voters to consider redistricting their state
temporarily if Texas redistricts, so that California can neutralize
Trump’s rigging of the state of Texas.</p>

curl and as I brought up this blog post in a discussion recently, I came
to reflect over how the world might have changed since. Is curl perhaps
used in more cars now? Yes it is. With the help of friendly people …

In <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2025/07/the-selling-of-ai.html"><i>The
Selling Of AI</i></a> I compared the market strategy behind the AI
bubble to the drug-dealer’s algorithm, “the first one’s free”. As the
drugs take hold of an addict, three things happen:<br />
<ul>
<li>
Their price rises.
</li>
<li>
The addict needs bigger doses for the same effect.
</li>
<li>
Their deleterious effects kick in.
</li>
</ul>
As expected, this what is happening to AI. Follow me below the fold for
the details.<br /> <span><a name='more'></a></span> <br />

The price rises
</h3>
Ethan Ding starts
<a href="https://ethanding.substack.com/p/ai-subscriptions-get-short-squeezed"><i>tokens
are getting more expensive</i></a> thus:<br />
<blockquote>
imagine you start a company knowing that consumers won’t pay more than
$20/month. fine, you think, classic vc playbook - charge at cost,
sacrifice margins for growth. you’ve done the math on cac, ltv, all
that. but here’s where it gets interesting: you’ve seen the
<a href="https://a16z.com/llmflation-llm-inference-cost/">a16z chart
showing llm costs dropping 10x every year</a>.<br /> <br /> so you
think: i’ll break even today at $20/month, and when models get 10x
cheaper next year, boom - 90% margins. the losses are temporary. the
profits are inevitable.<br /> <br /> it’s so simple a VC associate could
understand it:<br /> <br /> year 1: break even at $20/month<br /> <br />
year 2: 90% margins as compute drops 10x<br /> <br /> year 3: yacht
shopping<br /> <br /> it’s an understandable strategy: “the cost of LLM
inference has dropped by a factor of 3 every 6 months, we’ll be fine”

The first problem with this is that only
<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/only-8-of-americans-would-pay-extra-for-ai-according-to-zdnet-aberdeen-research/">8%
of the users</a> will pay the $20/month, the 92% use it for free
(<a href="https://menlovc.com/perspective/2025-the-state-of-consumer-ai/">Menlo
Ventures</a> thinks it is only 3%). Indeed it turns out that an entire
government agency only pays $1/year, as Samuel Axon reports in
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/08/openai-announces-deal-to-offer-chatgpt-to-us-executive-branch-at-almost-no-cost/"><i>US
executive branch agencies will use ChatGPT Enterprise for just $1 per
agency</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The workers will have access to ChatGPT Enterprise, a type of account
that includes access to frontier models and cutting-edge features with
relatively high token limits, alongside a more robust commitment to data
privacy than general consumers of ChatGPT get. ChatGPT Enterprise has
been trialed over the past several months at several corporations and
other types of large organizations.<br /> <br /> The workers will also
have unlimited access to advanced features like Deep Research and
Advanced Voice Mode for a 60-day period. After the one-year trial
period, the agencies are under no obligation to renew.
</blockquote>
Did I mention the drug-dealer’s algorithm?<br /> <br /> But that’s not
one of the two problems Ding is discussing. He is wondering why instead
of yacht shopping,
<a href="https://ethanding.substack.com/p/ai-subscriptions-get-short-squeezed">this
happened</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
but after 18 months, margins are about as negative as they’ve ever been…
windsurf’s been sold for parts, and claude code has had to roll back
their original unlimited $200/mo tier this week.<br /> <br /> companies
are still bleeding. the models got cheaper - gpt-3.5 costs 10x less than
it used to. but somehow the margins got worse, not better.
</blockquote>
What the A16Z graph shows is the rapid reduction in cost per token of
<i>each specific model</i>, but also the rapid pace at which each
specific model is supplanted by a better successor. Ding notes that
users want the
<a href="https://ethanding.substack.com/p/ai-subscriptions-get-short-squeezed">current
best model</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
gpt-3.5 is 10x cheaper than it was. it’s also as desirable as a flip
phone at an iphone launch.<br /> <br /> when a new model is released as
the SOTA, 99% of the demand immediatley shifts over to it. consumers
expect this of their products as well.

Which causes the first of the two problems Ding is describing. His graph
shows that the cost per token of the model users actually want is
<a href="https://ethanding.substack.com/p/ai-subscriptions-get-short-squeezed">approximately
constant</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
the 10x cost reduction is real, but only for models that might as well
be running on a commodore 64.<br /> <br /> so this is the first faulty
pillar of the “costs will drop” strategy: demand exists for “the best
language model,” period. and the best model always costs about the same,
because that’s what the edge of inference costs today.<br /> …<br />
when you’re spending time with an ai—whether coding, writing, or
thinking—you always max out on quality. nobody opens claude and thinks,
“you know what? let me use the shitty version to save my boss some
money.” we’re cognitively greedy creatures. we want the best brain we
can get, especially if we’re balancing the other side with our time.
</blockquote>
So the business model based on the cost of inference dropping 10x per
year doesn’t work. But that isn’t the worst of the two problems. While
it is true that the cost in dollars of a set number of tokens is roughly
constant, the number of tokens a user needs
<a href="https://ethanding.substack.com/p/ai-subscriptions-get-short-squeezed">is
not</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
while it’s true each generation of frontier model didn’t get more
expensive per token, something else happened. something worse. the
number of tokens they consumed went absolutely nuclear.<br /> <br />
chatgpt used to reply to a one sentence question with a one sentence
reply. now deep research will spend 3 minutes planning, and 20 minutes
reading, and another 5 minutes re-writing a report for you while o3 will
just run for 20-minutes to answer “hello there”.<br /> <br /> the
explosion of rl and test-time compute has resulted in something nobody
saw coming: the length of a task that ai can complete has been doubling
every six months. what used to return 1,000 tokens is now returning
100,000.

Users started by trying fairly simpple tasks on fairly simple models.
The power users, the ones in the 8%, were happy with the results and
graduated to trying complex questions on frontier models. So their
consumption of tokens
<a href="https://ethanding.substack.com/p/ai-subscriptions-get-short-squeezed">exploded</a>:<br />

for 24 hours asynchronously, we won’t be giving them one instruction and
waiting for feedback. we’ll be scheduling them in batches. entire fleets
of ai workers, attacking problems in parallel, burning tokens like it’s
1999.<br /> <br /> obviously - and i cannot stress this enough - a
$20/month subscription cannot even support a user making a single $1
deep research run a day. but that’s exactly what we’re racing toward.
every improvement in model capability is an improvement in how much
compute they can meaningfully consume at a time.
</blockquote>
The power users were on Anthropic’s unlimited plan, so
<a href="https://ethanding.substack.com/p/ai-subscriptions-get-short-squeezed">this
happened</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
users became api orchestrators running 24/7 code transformation engines
on anthropic’s dime. the evolution from chat to agent happened
overnight. 1000x increase in consumption. phase transition, not gradual
change.<br /> <br /> so anthropic rolled back unlimited. they could’ve
tried $2000/month, but the lesson isn’t that they didn’t charge enough,
it’s that there’s no way to offer unlimited usage in this new world
under any subscription model.<br /> <br /> it’s that <b>there is no flat
subscription price that works in this new world</b>.
</blockquote>
Ed Zitron’s
<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/ai-is-a-money-trap/"><i>AI Is A
Money Trap</i></a> looks at the effect of Anthropic figuring this out on
Cursor:<br />
<blockquote>
the single-highest earning generative AI company that isn’t called
OpenAI or Anthropic, and the highest-earning company built on top of
(primarily) Anthopic’s technology.
</blockquote>
When Anthropic decided to reduce the rate at which they were losing
money, Cursor’s
<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/ai-is-a-money-trap/">business model
collapsed</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
In mid-June — a few weeks after Anthropic introduced
“<a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/service-tiers">priority
tiers</a>” that required companies to pay up-front and guarantee a
certain throughput of tokens and increased costs on using prompt
caching, a big part of AI coding —
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/07/cursor-apologizes-for-unclear-pricing-changes-that-upset-users/">Cursor
massively changed the amount its users could use the product, and
introduced a $200-a-month subscription</a>.<br />
</blockquote>
Cursor’s customers
<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/ai-is-a-money-trap/">weren’t
happy</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Cursor’s product is now worse. People are going to cancel their
subscriptions. Its annualized revenue will drop, and its ability to
raise capital will suffer as a direct result. It will, regardless of
this drop in revenue, have to pay the cloud companies what it owes them,
as if it had the business it used to. I have spoken to a few different
people, including a company with an enterprise contract, that are either
planning to cancel or trying to find a way out of their agreements with
Cursor.
</blockquote>
So Cursor, which was already losing money, will have less income and
higher costs. They are the largest company buit on the AI major’s
platforms, despite only earning “around $42 million a month”, and
Anthropic just showed that their business model doesn’t work. This isn’t
a good sign for the generative AI industry and thus, as
<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/ai-is-a-money-trap/">Zitron
explains in details</a>, for the persistence of the AI bubble.<br />
<br /> Ding explains why OpenAi’s $1/year/agency deal is all about with
similar deals at the
<a href="https://ethanding.substack.com/p/ai-subscriptions-get-short-squeezed">big
banks</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
this is what devins all in on. they’ve recently announced their citi and
goldman sachs parterships, deploying devin to 40,000 software engineers
at each company. at $20/mo this is a $10M project, but here’s a
question: would you rather have $10M of ARR from goldman sachs or $500m
from prosumer devleopers?<br /> <br /> the answer is obvious: six-month
implementations, compliance reviews, security audits, procurement hell
mean that that goldman sachs revenue is hard to win — but once you win
it it’s impossible to churn. you only get those contracts if the
singular decision maker at the bank is staking their reputation on you —
and everyone will do everything they can to make it work.<br />
</blockquote>
Once the organization is hooked on the drug, they don’t care what it
costs because both real and political switching costs are intolerable,

AI job cuts are accelerating</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Even as business leaders claim AI is
“<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5009fd1e-85db-433f-aa2b-55d9b88b6481">redesigning</a>”
jobs rather than cutting them, the headlines tell another story. It is
not just Microsoft but Intel and BT that are among a host of major
companies announcing thousands of lay-offs explicitly linked to AI.
Previously when job cuts were announced, there was a sense that these
were regrettable choices. Now executives consider them a sign of
progress. Companies are pursuing greater profits with fewer people.
<br /> <br /> For the tech industry, revenue per employee has become a
prized performance metric. Y Combinator start-ups brag about building
companies with skeleton teams. A

Brandon Vigliarolo’s
<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/04/it_job_market_july/"><i>IT
firing spree: Shrinking job market looks even worse after BLS
revisions</i></a> has the latest data:<br />
<blockquote>
The US IT jobs market hasn’t exactly been robust thus far in 2025, and
downward revisions to May and June’s Bureau of Labor Statistics data
mean IT jobs lost in July are part of an even deeper sector slowdown
than previously believed.<br /> <br /> The Bureau of Labor Statistics
reported relatively flat job growth last month, but unimpressive payroll
growth numbers hid an even deeper reason to be worried: Most of the job
growth
<a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm">reported</a>
(across all employment sectors) in May and June was incorrect. <br />
<br /> According to the BLS, May needed to be revised down by 125,000
jobs to just 19,000 added jobs; June had to be revised down by even
more, with 133,000 erroneous new jobs added to company payrolls that
month. That meant just 14,000 new jobs were added in June.<br /> …<br />
Against that backdrop, Janco reports that BLS data peg the IT-sector
unemployment rate at 5.5 percent in July - well above the national rate
of 4.2 percent. Meanwhile, the broader tech occupation unemployment rate
was just 2.9 percent, as reported by CompTIA.
</blockquote>
Note these points from Janco’s table:<br />
<ul>
<li>
The huge spike of 107,100 IT jobs lost last November.
</li>
<li>
The loss of 26,500 IT jobs so far this year.
</li>
<li>
That so far this year losses are 327% of the same period last year.

The doses are increasing but their effect in pumping the stock hasn’t
been; the
<a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/index/ndxt">NDXT</a>
index of tech stocks hasn’t been heading moonwards over the last
year.<br /> <br /> CEOs have been enthusiastically laying off expensive
workers and replacing them with much cheaper indentured servnts on H-1B
visas, as Dan Gooding reports in
<a href="https://www.newsweek.com/h1b-visa-immigrants-tech-jobs-impact-college-grads-2106392"><i>H-1B

mid-level and senior roles often hit hardest. Some 80,000 tech jobs have

</blockquote>
Gooding
<a href="https://www.newsweek.com/h1b-visa-immigrants-tech-jobs-impact-college-grads-2106392">notes
that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
In 2023, U.S. colleges graduated 134,153 citizens or green card holders
with bachelor’s or master’s degrees in computer science. But the same
year, the federal government also issued over 110,000 work visas for
those in that same field, according to the Institute for Sound Public
Policy (IFSPP).<br /> <br /> “The story of the H-1B program is that it’s
for the best and the brightest,” said Jeremy Beck, co-president of
NumbersUSA, a think tank calling for immigration reform. “The reality,
however, is that most H-1B workers are classified and paid as ‘entry
level.’ Either they are not the best and brightest or they are
underpaid, or both.”
</blockquote>
While it is highly likely that most CEOs have drunk the Kool-Aid and
actually believe that AI will replace the workers they fired,
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/lizthegrey.com/post/3lvkvyf3euc2u">Liz
Fong-Jones</a> believes that:<br />
<blockquote>
the megacorps use AI as pretext for layoffs, but actually rooted in end
of 0% interest, changes to R&amp;D tax credit (S174, h/t
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:3y5mmnrkhxkv37szj7twlc6n"><span
class="citation"
data-cites="pragmaticengineer.com">@pragmaticengineer.com</span></a> for
their reporting), &amp; herd mentality/labour market fixing. they want
investors to believe AI is driving cost efficiency.<br /> <br /> AI
today is literally not capable of replacing the senior engineers they
are laying off. corps are in fact getting less done, but they’re banking
on making an example of enough people that survivors put their heads
down and help them implement AI in exchange for keeping their jobs… for
now.
</blockquote>
Note that the megacorps are monopolies, so “getting less done” and
delivering worse product by using AI isn’t a problem for them — they
won’t lose business. It is just more enshittification.<br /> <br />
Presumably, most CEOs think they have been laying off the fat, and
replacing it with cheaper workers whose muscle is enhanced by AI,
thereby pumping the stock. But they can’t keep doing this; they’d end up
with C-suite surrounded by short-termers on H-1Bs with no institutional
memory of how the company actually functions. This information would
have fallen off the end of the AIs’ context.<br />
<h3>
The deleterious effects kick in
</h3>
The deleterious effects come in three forms. Within the companies, as
the hype about AI’s capabilities meets reality. For the workers, and not
just those who were laid off. And in the broader economy, as the rush to
build AI data centers meets limited resources.<br />
<h4>
The companies
</h4>
But Raval sees the
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/04a83e0d-0128-4f59-9835-cb434a4257ec">weakening
starting</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
But are leaner organisations necessarily better ones? I am not convinced
these companies are more resilient even if they perform better
financially. Faster decision making and lower overheads are great, but
does this mean fewer resources for R&amp;D, legal functions or
compliance? What about a company’s ability to withstand shocks — from
supply chain disruptions to employee turnover and dare I say it, runaway
robots?<br /> <br /> Some companies such as Klarna have
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-08/klarna-turns-from-ai-to-real-person-customer-service">reversed
tack</a>, realising that firing hundreds of staff and relying on AI
resulted in a poorer customer service experience. Now the payments group
wants them back.<br />
</blockquote>
Of course, the tech majors have already enshittified their customer
experience, so they can impose AI on their customers without fear. But
AI is enshittifying the customer experience of smaller companies who
have acutal competitors.<br />
<h4>
The workers
</h4>
Shannon Pettypiece reports that
<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/job-market-report-college-student-graduates-ai-trump-tariffs-rcna221693"><i>‘A
black hole’: New graduates discover a dismal job market</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
NBC News asked people who recently finished technical school, college or
graduate school how their job application process was going, and in more
than 100 responses, the graduates described months spent searching for a
job, hundreds of applications and zero responses from employers — even
with degrees once thought to be in high demand, like computer science or
engineering. Some said they struggled to get an hourly retail position
or are making salaries well below what they had been expecting in fields
they hadn’t planned to work in.
</blockquote>
And Anjli Raval note that
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/04a83e0d-0128-4f59-9835-cb434a4257ec"><i>The
AI job cuts are accelerating</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Younger workers should be particularly concerned about this trend.
Entire rungs on the career ladder are taking a hit, undermining
traditional job pathways. This is not only about AI of course.
Offshoring, post-Covid budget discipline, and years of underwhelming
growth have made entry-level hiring an easy thing to cut. But AI is
adding to pressures.<br /> …<br /> The consequences are cultural as well
as economic. If jobs aren’t readily available, will a university degree
retain its value? Careers already are increasingly
“<a href="https://www.amazingif.com/">squiggly</a>” and not linear. The
rise of freelancing and hiring of contractors has already fragmented the
nature of work in many cases. AI will only propel this. <br /> …<br />
The tech bros touting people-light companies underestimate the
complexity of business operations and corporate cultures that are built
on very human relationships and interactions. In fact, while AI can
indeed handle the tedium, there should be a new premium on the human —
from creativity and emotional intelligence to complex judgment. But that
can only happen if we invest in those who bring those qualities and
teach the next generation of workers — and right now, the door is
closing on many of them.
</blockquote>
In <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w34071"><i>Rising Young Worker
Despair in the United States</i></a>, David G. Blanchflower &amp; Alex
Bryson describe some of the consequences:<br />
<blockquote>
Between the early 1990s and 2015 the relationship between mental despair
and age was hump-shaped in the United States: it rose to middle-age,
then declined later in life. That relationship has now changed: mental
despair declines monotonically with age due to a rise in despair among
the young. However, the relationship between age and mental despair
differs by labor market status. The hump-shape in age still exists for
those who are unable to work and the unemployed. The relation between
mental despair and age is broadly flat, and has remained so, for
homemakers, students and the retired. The change in the age-despair
profile over time is due to increasing despair among young workers.
Whilst the relationship between mental despair and age has always been
downward sloping among workers, this relationship has become more
pronounced due to a rise in mental despair among young workers. We find
broad-based evidence for this finding in the Behavioral Risk Factor
Surveillance System (BRFSS) of 1993-2023, the National Survey on Drug
Use and Health (NSDUH), 2008-2023, and in surveys by Pew, the Conference
Board and Johns Hopkins University.
</blockquote>
History tends to show that large numbers of jobless young people
despairing of their prospects for the future is a pre-revolutionary
situation.<br />

points out the huge size of the AI bubble:<br />

The entire high-yield bond market is only valued at about $1.4tn, so
private credit investors putting in $800bn for data centre construction

be spent. Morgan Stanley estimates that $1.3tn of data centre capex will

Over-investment is back, but might this be a
<a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/will-data-centers-crash-the-economy">good
thing?</a><br />
<blockquote>
I think it’s important to look at the telecom boom of the 1990s rather
than the one in the 2010s, because the former led to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecoms_crash">a gigantic
crash</a>. The railroad boom led to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1873">a gigantic crash
too</a>, in 1873 … In both cases, companies built too much
infrastructure, outrunning growth in demand for that infrastructure, and
suffered a devastating bust as expectations reset and loans couldn’t be
paid back.<br /> <br /> In both cases, though, the big capex spenders
weren’t <i>wrong</i>, they were just <i>early</i>. Eventually, we ended
up using all of those railroads and all of those telecom fibers, and
much more. This has led a lot of people
<a href="https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2021/01/why-bubbles-are-good-for-innovation/">to
speculate</a> that big investment bubbles might actually be
<a href="https://slate.com/business/2007/05/why-bubbles-are-great-for-the-economy.html">beneficial
to the economy</a>, since manias leave behind a surplus of cheap
infrastructure that can be used to power future technological advances
and new business models.<br /> <br /> But for anyone who gets caught up
in the crash, the future benefits to society are of cold comfort.

How likely is the bubble to burst? Elder notes just
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7052c560-4f31-4f45-bed0-cbc84453b3ce">one
reason</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Morgan Stanley estimates that more than half of the new data centres
will be in the US, where there’s no obvious way yet to switch them
on:<br /> <br /> America needs to find an extra 45GW for its data farms,
says Morgan Stanley. That’s equivalent to about 10 per cent of all
current US generation capacity, or “23 Hoover Dams”, it says. Proposed
workarounds to meet the shortfall include scrapping crypto mining,
putting data centres “behind the meter” in nuclear power plants, and
building a new fleet of gas-fired generators.
</blockquote>
Good luck with that! It is worth noting that the crash has <i>already
happened in China</i>, as Caiwei Chen reports in
<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/03/26/1113802/china-ai-data-centers-unused/"><i>China
built hundreds of AI data centers to catch the AI boom. Now many stand
unused.</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Just months ago, a boom in data center construction was at its height,
fueled by both government and private investors. However, many newly
built facilities are now sitting empty. According to people on the
ground who spoke to <i>MIT Technology Review</i>—including contractors,
an executive at a GPU server company, and project managers—most of the
companies running these data centers are struggling to stay afloat. The
local Chinese outlets <i>Jiazi Guangnian</i> and <i>36Kr</i> report that
up to 80% of China’s newly built computing resources remain unused.
</blockquote>
Elder also uses the analogy with the late 90s
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7052c560-4f31-4f45-bed0-cbc84453b3ce">telecom
bubble</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
In 2000, at the telecoms bubble’s peak, communications equipment
spending topped out at
<a href="https://www.richmondfed.org/-/media/RichmondFedOrg/publications/research/economic_quarterly/2003/fall/pdf/wolman.pdf">$135bn
annualised</a>. The internet hasn’t disappeared, but
<a href="https://rupakghose.substack.com/p/a-telecoms-bubble-or-a-tech-bubble">most
of the money did</a>. All those 3G licences and fibre-optic city loops
provided zero insulation from default:<br /> <br /> Peak data centre
spend this time around might be 10 times higher, very approximately,
with public credit investors sharing the burden more equally with
corporates. The broader spread of capital might mean a slower unwind
should GenAI’s return on investment fail to meet expectations, as Morgan
Stanley says. But it’s still not obvious why creditors would be coveting
a server shed full of obsolete GPUs that’s downwind of a proposed power
plant.
</blockquote>
When the bubble bursts, who will
<a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/will-data-centers-crash-the-economy">lose
money?</a><br />
<blockquote>
A data center bust would mean that Big Tech shareholders would lose a
lot of money, like dot-com shareholders in 2000. It would also slow the
economy directly, because Big Tech companies would stop investing. But
the scariest possibility is that it would cause a financial
crisis.<br /> <br /> Financial crises tend to involve bank debt. When a
financial bubble and crash is mostly a fall in the value of stocks and
bonds, everyone takes losses and then just sort of walks away, a bit
poorer — like in 2000. Jorda, Schularick, and Taylor (2015) survey the
history of bubbles and crashes, and they find that debt (also called
“credit” and “leverage”) is a key predictor of whether a bubble ends up
hurting the real economy.
</blockquote>
The Jorda <i>et al</i> paper is
<a href="https://www.frbsf.org/wp-content/uploads/wp11-27bk.pdf"><i>When
Credit Bites Back: Leverage, Business Cycles, and Crises</i></a>, and
what they mean by “credit” and “leverage” is <i>bank loans</i>.<br />
<br /> Smith looks at whether
<a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/will-data-centers-crash-the-economy">the
banks are lending</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
So if we believe this basic story of when to be afraid of capex busts,
it means that we have to care about who is lending money to these Big
Tech companies to build all these data centers. That way, we can figure
out whether we’re worried about what happens to those lenders if Big
Tech can’t pay the money back.
</blockquote>
And so does
<a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2025/07/31/who-will-pay-for-the-trillion-dollar-ai-boom"><i>The
Economist</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
During the first half of the year investment-grade borrowing by tech
firms was 70% higher than in the first six months of 2024. In April
Alphabet issued bonds for the first time since 2020. Microsoft has
reduced its cash pile but its finance leases—a type of debt mostly
related to data centres—nearly tripled since 2023, to $46bn (a further
$93bn of such liabilities are not yet on its balance-sheet). Meta is in
talks to borrow around $30bn from private-credit lenders including
Apollo, Brookfield and Carlyle. The market for debt securities backed by
borrowing related to data centres, where liabilities are pooled and
sliced up in a way similar to mortgage bonds, has grown from almost
nothing in 2018 to around $50bn today.<br /> <br /> The rush to borrow
is more furious among big tech’s challengers. CoreWeave, an ai cloud
firm, has borrowed liberally from private-credit funds and bond
investors to buy chips from Nvidia. Fluidstack, another cloud-computing
startup, is also borrowing heavily, using its chips as collateral.
SoftBank, a Japanese firm, is financing its share of a giant partnership
with Openai, the maker of ChatGPT, with debt. “They don’t actually have
the money,” wrote Elon Musk when the partnership was announced in
January. After raising $5bn of debt earlier this year xai, Mr Musk’s own
startup, is reportedly borrowing $12bn to buy chips.
</blockquote>
Smith focuses on
<a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/will-data-centers-crash-the-economy">private
credit</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
These are the potentially scary part. Private credit funds are basically
companies that take investment, borrow money, and then lend that money
out in private (i.e. opaque) markets. They’re the debt version of
private equity, and in recent years they’ve grown rapidly to become one
of the U.S.’ economy’s major categories of debt:

Are the banks vulnerable to
<a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/will-data-centers-crash-the-economy">private
credit?</a>.<br />
<blockquote>
Private credit funds take some of their financing as equity, but they
also borrow money. Some of this money is borrowed from banks. In 2013,
only 1% of U.S. banks’ total loans to non-bank financial institutions
was to private equity and private credit firms;
<a href="https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/supervisory-research-and-analysis-notes/2025/bank-lending-to-private-equity-and-private-credit-funds.aspx">today,
it’s 14%</a>.<br /> <br /> BDCs are
“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Development_Company">Business
Development Companies</a>”, which are a type of private credit fund. If
there’s a bust in private credit, that’s an acronym you’ll be hearing a
lot.<br /> <br /> And I believe the graph above does not include
<a href="https://www.wellington.com/en-us/institutional/insights/clos-four-hot-topics-for-2024">bank
purchases of bonds (CLOs)</a> issued by private credit companies. If
private credit goes bust, those bank assets will go bust too, making
banks’ balance sheets weaker.
</blockquote>
<p>The fundamental problem here is that an AI bust would cause losses
that would be both very large and very highly correlated, and thus very
likely to be a tail risk not adequately accounted for by the banks’ risk
models, just as the large, highly correlated losses caused the banks to
need a bail-out in the

<p>date: 2025-08-14, updated: 2025-08-14, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
<a href="https://sketch.dev/blog/our-first-outage-from-llm-written-code">Here’s</a>
an interesting story about a failure being introduced by LLM-written
code. Specifically, the LLM was doing some code refactoring, and when it
moved a chunk of code from one file to another it changed a “break” to a
“continue.” That turned an error logging statement into an infinite
loop, which crashed the system.

<p>
This is an

while we can think of particular patches that alleviate this exact
failure, the larger problem is much harder to solve.

<h2 id="underlines-and-line-height">Underlines and line height</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-14, from: Jeremy Keith Blog</p>
<p>
I was thinking about something I wrote yesterday when I was talking
about <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/22084">styling underlines on
links</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
For a start, you can adjust the distance of the underline from the text
using
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-underline-offset"><code>text-underline-offset</code></a>.
If you’re using a generous line-height, use a generous distance here
too.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
For some reason, I completely forgot that we’ve got a line-height unit
in CSS now:
<a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_types_length_lh"><code>lh</code></a>.
So if you want to make the distance of your underline proportional to
the line height of the text that the link is part of, it’s easy-peasy:
</p>
<pre><code>text-underline-offset: 0.15lh;
</code></pre>
<p>
The greater the line height, the greater the distance between the link
text and its underline.
</p>
<p>
I think this one is going into
<a href="https://adactio.com/journal/21896">my collection of CSS
snippets</a> I use on almost every project.

<p>
I’m ignoring this for the moment. :(
</p>
<p>
Deleting files from the last upgrade:
</p>
<pre><code>find /etc '(' -name '*.dpkg-*' -o -name '*.ucf-*' -o -name '*.merge-error' ')' -exec rm '{}' ';'
</code></pre>
<p>
Purging config files:

<pre><code>apt purge '?narrow(?config-files)'
</code></pre>
<p>
Removing old stuff and making space:
</p>
<pre><code>apt autoremove
apt clean
</code></pre>
<p>
Lots of reading. Replacing <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> with

<p>
And then:
</p>
<pre><code>apt update
apt upgrade --without-new-pkgs
apt full-upgrade
</code></pre>
<p>
I’m ignoring the warnings about directories the upgrade process was
unable to delete: The ones I did check contained scripts and the like. I
would have felt OK to delete directories with generated files, or files
modified by me. But this? I don’t know.
</p>
<p>
Conflicts I ran into:
</p>
<pre><code>/etc/exim4/conf.d/main/03_exim4-config_tlsoptions
</code></pre>
<p>
This file showed up as a conflict but it was nothing I remember doing.
Install the maintainer version!
</p>
<pre><code>/etc/systemd/journald.conf
</code></pre>
<p>
I had added <code>SystemMaxUse=200M</code> and
<code>MaxRetentionSec=7d</code> because I didn’t want to give the log
files that much space. So I redid those changes for the maintainer
version.
</p>
<pre><code>/etc/pam.d/login
</code></pre>
<p>
I’m not sure what this is about. Did I comment <code>session optional
pam_motd.so motd=/run/motd.dynamic</code>? Perhaps I did. Let’s go with
the maintainer version and see if that’s OK.
</p>
<p>
To do after the upgrade:
</p>
<pre><code>rm /var/log/wtmp* /var/log/lastlog* /var/log/btmp*
</code></pre>
<p>
I noticed that the sway background image is back. I had to add a line at
the very end of my config file:
</p>
<pre><code>#

The old <code>tracker</code> package is now a transitional package that
depends on <code>tinysparql</code>. Trying to <code>apt remove</code>
either of them will attempt to remove <code>gnome-session gnome-sushi
tinysparql xdg-desktop-portal-gnome gnome-session-xsession nautilus
tracker-extract</code>. Fuuuck.
</p>
<p>
Looking at the man pages, I get the feeling that
<code>localsearch-daemon(3)</code> is what I need kill the processes.
But how to disable them?
</p>
<pre><code># locate localsearch|grep .service
/etc/systemd/user/gnome-session.target.wants/localsearch-3.service
/usr/lib/systemd/user/localsearch-3.service
/usr/lib/systemd/user/localsearch-control-3.service
/usr/lib/systemd/user/localsearch-writeback-3.service
/usr/share/localsearch3/miners/org.freedesktop.Tracker3.Miner.Files.service
/var/lib/systemd/deb-systemd-user-helper-enabled/localsearch-3.service.dsh-also
/var/lib/systemd/deb-systemd-user-helper-enabled/gnome-session.target.wants/localsearch-3.service
</code></pre>
<p>
OK, some candidates!
</p>
<p>
The manual page for <code>localsearch-3(1)</code> mentioned that it was
started by a <code>.desktop</code> file. But perhaps I can just disable
the service?
</p>
<p>
Maybe not.
</p>
<pre><code># systemctl --user disable localsearch-3
The following unit files have been enabled in global scope. This means
they will still be started automatically after a successful disablement
in user scope:
localsearch-3.service
# sudo systemctl disable localsearch-3.service
Failed to disable unit: Unit localsearch-3.service does not exist
</code></pre>
<p>
I’m not sure what to do.
</p>
<pre><code># locate localsearch|grep .desktop
/etc/xdg/autostart/localsearch-3.desktop
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/localsearch-3.0/extract-modules/libextract-desktop.so
/usr/share/localsearch3/extract-rules/10-desktop.rule
/usr/share/localsearch3/miners/org.freedesktop.Tracker3.Miner.Files.service
</code></pre>
<p>
Perhaps it’s that first file. But how to disable <em>that</em>?
</p>
<p>
Ah, I am not alone. With that info I found
<a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=299586">a discussion
on the Arch Linux forum</a> with various strategies being discussed. I
will try to change the <code>X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled</code> line to
<code>false</code> and see whether that helps. And while I am at it, I
will also change <code>X-GNOME-HiddenUnderSystemd</code> to
<code>false</code>.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2025-08-13</strong>. Oh, and I can no longer edit remote files
with my Emacs at home. It just hangs there and waits for the prompt or
something, I guess.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2025-08-13</strong>. Oh, and that annoying Gnome keyring?
<a href="https://www.xmodulo.com/disable-gnome-keyring-linux-desktop.html">How
to disable GNOME Keyring on GNOME desktop</a> by Dan Nanni suggests to
copy the <code>gnome-keyring-*.desktop</code> files from
<code>/etc/xdg/autostart</code> to <code>~/.config/autostart</code> and
append the line <code>X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=false</code> to each
one.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2025-08-14</strong>. The chkrootkit mail I get every day has a
lot of useless information. One looks like <em>all</em> the dotfiles?
Ugh.

<h2 id="choosing-tools-to-make-websites">Choosing Tools To Make
Websites</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-13, from: Jim Nielsen blog</p>
<p>
Jan Miksovsky lays out his idea for
<a href="https://goodinternetmagazine.com/site-creation-as-content-transformation/" >website
creation as content transformation</a>. He starts by talking about tools
that hide what’s happening “under the hood”:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A framework’s marketing usually pretends it is unnecessary for you to
understand how its core transformation works — but without that
knowledge, you can’t achieve the beautiful range of results you see in
the framework’s sample site gallery.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is a <em>great</em> callout. Tools will say, “You don’t have to
worry about the details.” But the reality is, you end up worrying about
the details — at least to some degree.
</p>
<p>
Why? Because what you want to build is full of personalization. That’s
how you differentiate yourself, which means you’re going to need a tool
that’s expressive enough to help you.
</p>
<p>
So the question becomes: how hard is it to understand the details that
are being intentionally hidden away?
</p>
<p>
A lot of the time those details are not exposed directly. Instead
they’re exposed through configuration. But configuration doesn’t really
help you learn how something works. I mean, how many of you have learned
how typescript works under the hood by using <code>tsconfig.json</code>?
As Jan says:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Configuration can lead to as many problems as it solves
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Nailed it. He continues:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Configuring software is itself a form of programming, in fact a rather
difficult and often baroque form. It can take more data files or code to
configure a framework’s transformation than to write a program that
directly implements that transformation itself.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I’m not a Devops person, but that sounds like Devops in a nutshell right
there. (It also perfectly encapsulates my feelings on trying to setup
configuration in GitHub Actions.)
</p>
<p>
Jan moves beyond site creation to also discuss site hosting. He gives
good reasons for keeping your website’s architecture simple and
decoupled from your hosting provider (something I’ve been a long time
proponent of):
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
These site hosting platforms typically charge an ongoing subscription
fee. (Some offer a free tier that may meet your needs.) The monthly fee
may not be large, but it’s forever. Ten years from now you’ll probably
still want your content to be publicly available, but will you still be
happy paying that monthly fee? If you stop paying, your site disappears.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In subscription pricing, any price (however small) is recurring. Stated
differently: pricing is forever.
</p>
<p>
Anyhow, it’s a good read from Jan and lays out his vision for why he’s
building <a href="https://weborigami.org" >Web Origami</a>: a tool for
that encourages you to understand (and customize) how you transform
content to a website. He just launched
<a href="https://github.com/WebOrigami/origami/releases/tag/0.4.0" >version
<code>0.4.0</code> </a> which has some exciting stuff I’m excited to try
out further (I’ll have to write about all that later).

<h2 id="style-your-underlines">Style your underlines</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-13, from: Jeremy Keith Blog</p>
<p>
We shouldn’t rely on colour alone to indicate that something is
interactive.
</p>
<p>
Take links, for example. Sure, you can give them a different colour to
the surrounding text, but you shouldn’t stop there. Make sure there’s
something else that distinguishes them. You could make them bold. Or you
could stick with the well-understood convention of underlying links.
</p>
<p>
This is where some designers bristle. If there are a lot of links on a
page, it could look awfully cluttered with underlines. That’s why some
designers would rather remove the underline completely.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://mastodon.social/@matuzo@front-end.social/114674911039663634">As
Manu observed</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I’ve done a lot of audits in the first half of this year and at this
point a believe that designing links without underlines is a kink. The
idea that users don’t understand that links are clickable arouses some
designers. I can’t explain it any other way.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
But underlining links isn’t the binary decision it once was. You can use
CSS to style those underlines just as you’d style any other part of your
design language.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://example.com/" style="all: revert; font-size: 1.5em; text-decoration: underline">Here’s
a regular underlined link.</a>
</p>
<p>
For a start, you can adjust the distance of the underline from the text
using
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-underline-offset"><code>text-underline-offset</code></a>.
If you’re using a generous line-height, use a generous distance here
too.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://example.com/" style="all: revert; font-size: 1.5em; text-decoration: underline; text-underline-offset: 0.2em">Here’s
a link with an offset underline.</a>
</p>
<p>
If you’d rather have a thinner or thicker underline, use
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-decoration-thickness"><code>text-decoration-thickness</code></a>.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://example.com/" style="all: revert; font-size: 1.5em; text-decoration: underline; text-underline-offset: 0.2em; text-decoration-thickness: 1px">Here’s
a link with a thin underline.</a>
</p>
<p>
The colour of the underline and the colour of the link don’t need to be
the same. Use
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-decoration-color"><code>text-decoration-color</code></a>
to make them completely different colours or make the underline a
lighter shade of the link colour.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://example.com/" style="all: revert; font-size: 1.5em; text-decoration: underline; text-underline-offset: 0.2em; text-decoration-thickness: 1px; text-decoration-color: oklch(from currentColor l c h / 50%);">Here’s
a link with a translucent underline.</a>
</p>
<p>
That’s quite a difference with just a few CSS declarations:
</p>
<pre><code>text-underline-offset: 0.2em;
text-decoration-thickness: 1px;
text-decoration-color: oklch(from currentColor l c h / 50%);
</code></pre>
<p>
If that still isn’t subtle enough for you, you could even use
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-decoration-style"><code>text-decoration-style</code></a>
to make the underline dotted or dashed, but that might be a step too
far.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://example.com/" style="all: revert; font-size: 1.5em; text-decoration: underline; text-underline-offset: 0.2em; text-decoration-thickness: 1px; text-decoration-color: oklch(from currentColor l c h / 50%); text-decoration-style: dotted">Here’s
a link with a dotted underline.</a>
</p>
<p>
Whatever you decide, I hope you’ll see that underlines aren’t the enemy
of good design. They’re an opportunity.
</p>
<p>
You should use underlines to keep your links accessible. But you should
also use CSS to make those underlines beautiful.

<a href="https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSocket/blob/main/source.opml">source.opml</a>
in <a href="http://drummer.land/">Drummer</a>, there are a lot of notes
that don’t make it through to the .js and .css files. I don’t think I’ve
ever said that on the blog before. I write my code in an outliner, and
take advantage of its ability to collapse long comments into a single
line. There are whole blogs at the top of some functions, notes about
all the big changes in code, sometimes over years, and sometimes even
decades of maintenance. There’s a
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/blob/main/source.opml">source.opml</a>
in most of the repos with a big comment at the top explaining what’s
going on. Also, most projects have a
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/blob/main/worknotes.md">worknotes.md</a>
file, and where there are dates in the source code, the refer back to
dates in the worknotes.md file. Not always, but most of the time. Some
of the code is very complex, I work really hard to make it simple so it
can be worked on, but in some cases it’s impossible to make it read
casually. But it’s all there, all the tools I use to write the code.</p>

had an hour to spare this morning so I decided for a third time to try
to coax ChatGPT to play a role in a little drama I have in mind. I still
want to use AI to power an RSS feed of news, customized to the interests
of one person (me). My
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/325#issuecomment-3179118706">query</a>
is this: “Create a summary of the news, top 20 stories with an emphasis
on these topics: how people are using AI, especially in education,
blogging, US politics, science news, the NBA and MLB, with a slight
emphasis on the Knicks and Mets. The results should be in JSON format,
with each item including: A brief one sentence summary, publication date
and a link to a source where the reader can get more info. My software
will then create an RSS feed with this information..” The response was
basically: “I’m sorry Dave.” Groan. Here are
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/325#issuecomment-3179036482">the

<h2 id="the-incriminating-video-scam">The “Incriminating Video”
Scam</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-12, updated: 2025-08-07, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
A few years ago, scammers invented a new phishing email. They would
claim to have hacked your computer, turned your webcam on, and videoed
you watching porn or having sex. BuzzFeed has an
<a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/poojashah1/new-email-scam-house-address-sc">article</a>
talking about a “shockingly realistic” variant, which includes photos of
you and your house—more specific information.
</p>
<p>
The article contains “steps you can take to figure out if it’s a scam,”
but omits the first and most fundamental piece of advice: If the hacker
had incriminating video about you, they would show you a clip. Just a
taste, not the worst bits so you had to worry about how bad it could be,
but something. If the hacker doesn’t show you any video, they don’t have
any video. Everything else is window dressing…

<p>It’s reasonable — especially for paying customers — to expect at
least some advance notice of older models going away. But it’s
unreasonable to think that older models are going to remain available in
perpetuity — especially in the current LLM climate, where model age is
measured in months, or even weeks.</p>

<h2 id="session-talk">Session talk</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-11, from: Jeremy Keith Blog</p>
<p>
I was in Nor’n Irelan’ at the end of July for my annual week of
<a href="https://www.belfasttraditionalmusic.com/">Belfast Tradfest</a>.
</p>
<p>
It was the best one yet. Classes in the morning, sessions all day, and
concerts in the evening.
</p>
<p>
There were also some excellent events at Ulster University during the
afternoons—talks, film screenings, interviews and discussions.
</p>
<p>
If you squint closely at
<a href="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/58da46ee15d5db0567e7ca1c/1750803556821-68NZW483810FRP1HALAG/Festival+Poster+-+Print_A4.png">the
poster for this year’s event</a> you’ll see my name on there. That’s
because one of those afternoon events was me giving a talk about
<a href="https://thesession.org/">thesession.org</a>.
</p>
<p>
I’m no stranger to public speaking but this was a very different
audience to the usual conferences I speak at. I had to make sure not to
get technical. So I talked about the history of the site,
<a href="https://thesession.org/help#houserules">the house rules</a>,
changes made over time, and pointed out some features that people
might’ve missed.
</p>
<p>
I also made sure not to speak for too long. I had an hour but I kept the
presentation to just 25 minutes so that there’d be plenty of time for
questions and discussions afterwards.
</p>
<p>
It went really well. People had lots of questions and ideas.
</p>
<p>
Some interesting themes emerged from the discussion…
</p>
<p>
There was no shortage of suggestions for features that were
<em>technically</em> possible, but that I’m probably not going to add
because of they might clutter up the interface.
</p>
<p>
Some other people had suggestions for features that were actually
already on the site …but implemented in such a subtle way that you could
easily miss them.
</p>
<p>
This highlights an ongoing balancing act I’ve been performing for the
site’s two and a half decades of existence. I want to keep improving the
site and ensuring that powerful features are available. But I also want
to keep the site streamlined and easy to use.
</p>
<p>
Thinking about it, this is one of the things that sets The Session apart
from other tune collections out there. Many of them have great content
but it’s not always easy to get to grips with it, at least at first.
</p>
<p>
Still, I may have gone too far in the other direction with The Session.
In trying to avoid cluttering up the interface, I might’ve buried some
features a little deep.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, all of this has been great food for thought. I’m really glad I
got to meet so many people who use The Session. It literally wouldn’t
exist without them.

want to work on the open web with other developers who make interesting
products that we can hook up together to make new products. Or if users
get an idea for linking two products, they can do it with scripting. It
was a dream we had for the Mac, but it fell apart because Apple wanted
to control everything. I find it’s better when developers are free to
work with each other, without interference from a big company like
Apple. That’s why “platform without a platform vendor” was the most
important thing about the web. That and the utter simplicity of HTTP and
HTML. We lost our way in the early-mid 00s when Twitter took over at the
center of the blogosphere. Now you couldn’t just work with other
developers, first you had to work with Twitter and accept its limits. In
one swoop we lost all the features listed on the
<a href="https://textcasting.org/">textcasting</a> page. I am betting
everything on the idea that we can build a collaborative environment
like the web was before, and that the Mac had the promise of being
before that and at the same time create a fantastic
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22writer%27s%20web%22">writer’s

Theory about why we don’t fight to save the US.
</p>
<p>
Many of us haven’t personally felt much impact.
</p>
<p>
No hyperinflation yet.
</p>
<p>
The police still respond as they always have, wearing badges, faces
uncovered.
</p>
<p>
The shelves are full at the supermarket.
</p>
<p>
The electricity is on, as is the internet. Buses and subways are
running. The airports are open.
</p>
<p>
The Obamas and Clintons are still free, living in the US.
</p>
<p>
We read the news about universities and news orgs giving in. Corruption
at the FBI and in Congress and the Supreme Court.
</p>
<p>
No major hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, tornados so cuts at FEMA not
felt yet.
</p>
<p>
And we’ve been living in a normal way for hundreds of years. We’ve had
no time to get used to the new normal. It doesn’t feel like anything
yet.
</p>
<p>
I fear by the time we feel it it will be far too late, by design.

<h2 id="sit-on-your-ass-web-development">Sit On Your Ass Web
Development</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-10, from: Jim Nielsen blog</p>
<p>
I’ve been <del>reading</del> listening to
<a href="https://press.stripe.com/poor-charlies-almanack" ><em>Poor
Charlie’s Almanack</em></a> which is a compilation of talks by Charlie
Munger, legendary vice-chairman at Berkshire Hathaway.
</p>
<p>
One thing Charlie talks about is what he calls “sit on your ass
investing” which is the opposite of day trading. Rather than being in
the market every day (chasing trends, reacting to fluctuations, and
trying to time transactions) Charlie advocates spending most of your
time “sitting on your ass”. That doesn’t mean you’re doing nothing. It
means that instead of constantly trading you’re spending your time in
research and preparation for trading.
</p>
<p>
Eventually, a top-tier opportunity will come along and your preparation
will make you capable of recognizing it and betting big. <em>That’s when
you trade.</em> After that, you’re back to “sitting on your ass”. Trust
your research. Trust your choices. Don’t tinker. Don’t micromanage.
Don’t panic. Just let the compounding effects of a good choice work in
your favor.
</p>
<h2 id="day-trading-day-developing">
Day Trading, Day Developing
</h2>
<p>
As a day trader your job is to trade daily (it’s right there in the job
title). If you’re not trading every day then what are you even doing?
Not your job, apparently.
</p>
<p>
I think it’s easy to view “development” like this. You’re a developer.
Your job is to develop programs — to write code. If you’re not doing
that every single day, then what are you even doing?
</p>
<p>
From this perspective, it becomes easy to think that writing endless
code for ever-changing software paradigms is just how one develops
websites.
</p>
<p>
But it doesn’t have to be that way. Granted,
<a href="https://dubroy.com/blog/cold-blooded-software/" >there’s
cold-blooded and warm-blooded software.</a> Sometimes you can’t avoid
that.
</p>
<p>
But I also think there’s a valuable lesson in Charlie’s insight. You
don’t have to chase “the market” of every new framework or API, writing
endless glue code for features that already exist or that will soon
exist in browsers. Instead, you can make a few select, large bets on the
web platform and then “sit on your ass” until the payoff comes later!
</p>
<h2 id="an-example-polyfills">
An Example: Polyfills
</h2>
<p>
I think polyfills are a great example of an approach to “sit on your
ass” web development. Your job as a developer is to know enough to make
a bet on a particular polyfill that aligns with the future of the web
platform. Once implemented, all you have to do is sit on your ass while
other really smart people who are building browsers do their part to
ship the polyfilled feature in the platform. Once shipped, you “sell”
your investment by stripping out the polyfill and reap the reward of
having your application get lighter and faster with zero additional
effort.
</p>
<p>
A big part of the payoff is in the waiting — in the “sitting on your
ass”. You make a smart bet, then you sit patiently while others run
around endlessly writing and rewriting more code (meanwhile the only
thing left for you will be to delete code).
</p>
<p>
Charlie’s business partner Warren Buffett once said that it’s “better to
buy a wonderful company at a fair price, than a fair company at a
wonderful price”. Similarly, I’d say it’s better to build on a polyfill
aligned with the future of the platform than to build on a framework
re-inventing a feature of the platform.

Get Out Of Your Own Way
</h2>
<p>
Want to do “Day Trading Development”?
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Jump tools and frameworks constantly — “The next one will solve all our
problems!”
</li>
<li>
Build complex, custom solutions that duplicate work the web platform is
already moving towards solving.
</li>
<li>
Commit code that churns with time, rather than compounds with it.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Want to do “Sit on Your Ass Development”?
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Do the minimum necessary to bridge the gap until browsers catch up.
</li>
<li>
Build on forward-facing standards, then sit back and leverage the
compounding effects of browser makers and standards bodies that
iteratively improve year over year (none of whom you have to pay).
</li>
<li>
As <a href="https://notes.jim-nielsen.com/#2025-07-18T0946" >Alex Russel
recommends</a>, spend as little time as possible in your own code and
instead focus on glueing together “the big C++/Rust subsystems” of the
browser.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In short: spend less time glueing together tools and frameworks <em>on
top of</em> the browser, and more time bridging tools and APIs
<em>inside of the browser</em>. Then get out of your own way and go sit
on your ass. You might find yourself more productive than ever!

<h2 id="oddμ-hashtags">2025-08-07 Oddμ hashtags</h2>

<h1 id="2025-08-07-oddμ-hashtags">
2025-08-07 Oddμ hashtags
</h1>
<p>
I was recently looking at my homepage and wondered about all the
hashtags I used and how not all of them had a topic page. The
<a href="Odd%CE%BC">Oddμ</a> page, for example, collects all the
blogposts tagged <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Oddμ">#Oddμ</a>
(including this one). So I looked at the
<a href="oddmu/oddmu-hashtags.1">hashtags</a> command and figured, “this
is going to be easy.” 🤣
</p>
<p>
The first problem is that there are a lot of garbage hashtags. There are
over 1000 hashtags used on this site! The garbage hashtags are the
result of Markdown parsing mistakes that I never fixed. Apparently the
list of hashtags includes the following:
</p>
<pre><code>#1)
#fennel”
#fudge](fudge)_and_the_[pdq](../wiki?action=edit;id=pdq_&quot;click_to_edit_this_page&quot;)_rules_used_in_[zorcererofzo.
ffffff;fill-opacity:1&quot;)
###｣
</code></pre>
<p>
This is not great. 😔
</p>
<p>
I should fix those, and many more. 🤨
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, the hashtags are all downcased. So given a hashtag such as
<code>#advanced_squad_leader</code> the code would have to infer the
page name “Advanced Squad Leader”. But what about the hashtag
<code>#älter werden</code>? If at all, that should link to a page called
“Älter werden”.
</p>
<p>
And so I concluded that this wasn’t easy after all. I saved the changes
I made on a branch, and I don’t think I’ll be merging that into the main
branch.
</p>
<p>
<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Wikis">#Wikis</a>
</p>
<p>
<strong>2025-08-09</strong>. Well! I think I worked on it and I worked
on it, and then I ran it, and kept on fixing the topic pages it created.
But I think it worked!
</p>
<p>
<strong>2025-08-10</strong>. Yesterday I cleaned up my site (somewhat)
and today I released v1.18 of Oddμ. Yay me!
