Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0647 AM CST Tue Feb 11 2025

Valid 111300Z - 121200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM SOUTHEAST
TEXAS AND THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY INTO SOUTHERN MISSISSIPPI AND
CENTRAL ALABAMA....

...SUMMARY...
Isolated to scattered thunderstorms are possible from the southern
Plains into the lower Mississippi Valley. Some strong to severe
thunderstorms are possible from southeast Texas and the Lower
Mississippi Valley into southern Mississippi and central Alabama.

...Synopsis...
A pair of shortwave troughs are expected to progress through the
southern Plains today as the cyclonic flow aloft across the western
CONUS deepens. The first of these shortwaves is currently moving
through the southern High Plains while the second remains off the
coast of the northern Baja Peninsula. Both of those shortwaves are
expected to progress quickly eastward, with the lead wave reaching
the Mid-Atlantic by early Wednesday and the second shortwave
reaching central TX.

...Lower MS Valley into southern/central MS and AL...
As mentioned in the synopsis, the lead shortwave trough is currently
moving through the southern High Plains, with preceding warm-air
advection contributing to an expansive area of precipitation from
the TX Hill Country into the Mid-South. General expectation is that
this area of precipitation will gradually shift northeastward
throughout the day, remaining just ahead of the eastward-progressing
shortwave. Low-level moisture return ahead of the first wave will be
modest, particularly across TX where the modified Gulf moisture will
likely remain confined to the coastal plain. Farther east, greater
inland moisture advection is anticipated, with mid 60s dewpoints
advection through much of the Lower MS Valley by the early
afternoon. Lower 60s dewpoints are likely in the central portions of
MS and AL by the late afternoon/early evening. 

Even with this low-level moisture advection, mid-level temperatures
will remain warm, keeping the overall buoyancy modest (i.e. MUCAPE
less than 1000 J/kg) across the region. In contrast to the modest
buoyancy, vertical shear will be quite strong, with effective bulk
shear over 50 kt from the Lower MS Valley into AL and MS during the
afternoon and evening. This strong vertical shear may be able to
compensate for the lower buoyancy, and there could be a window for a
few strong to severe storms this afternoon/evening along and ahead
of the cold front from southern MS into southern and central AL.
Primary risk would be damaging wind gusts, but enough low-level
shear exists for a low-probability tornado threat as well.

...Southern Plains late tonight...
Strong large-scale forcing for ascent will spread across the
southern High Plains and into west TX late tonight ahead of the
second shortwave trough mentioned in the synopsis. Notable
moistening between 850 and 700 mb combined with mid-level cooling
will help support modest elevated buoyancy. Thunderstorms are
expected to develop across West TX tonight before then spreading
eastward/northeastward into more of OK and north/central TX. Much of
this activity will be displaced well north/northwest of front and
greater low-level moisture. Some hail is possible, but updraft depth
and duration will be limited by weak buoyancy, and the current
expectation is for any hail to remain very isolated. 

As these storms move east/southeast with time, some interaction
could occur with a warm front gradually moving northward into more
of southeast TX early Wednesday morning. Increased buoyancy as well
as enhanced mesoscale ascent in the vicinity of the front is
expected to result in greater thunderstorm depth and duration.
Vertical shear will remain strong as well, with all of these factors
supporting a greater severe potential across southeast TX and
adjacent far southwestern LA early Wednesday morning. Damaging gusts
and/or a brief tornado are the primary threats.

Valid 110100Z - 111200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected tonight.

...01z Update...

850mb flow is beginning to increase across northern TX into
southeast OK, partially in response to a weak southern stream
short-wave trough that is approaching this region. Latest model
guidance suggests LLJ will strengthen into the late evening hours
then veer into the Arklatex by 11/12z. The strongest corridor of
low-level warm advection is currently noted from central OK into the
Ozarks. This appears to be the primary reason for ongoing elevated
convection, with scattered updrafts penetrating levels that are
favorable for lightning. 00z sounding from OUN supports this with
450 J/kg MUCAPE if lifting a parcel around 2km AGL. With time, as
temperatures cool aloft, lapse rates should adjust and permit
convection to develop southwest across north-central TX into the
Edwards Plateau. Buoyancy appears inadequate for severe hail.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0222 PM CST Mon Feb 10 2025

Valid 121200Z - 181200Z

A progressive upper pattern is in store for the upcoming week into
next weekend, with multiple surface cyclones poised to develop over
the Plains states and eject eastward in tandem with supporting
mid-level troughs. Surface cyclone development is expected in the
southern Plains with the approach of the first mid-level trough,
supporting dry downslope flow across far western Texas Day 3
(Wednesday). 25 mph sustained westerly surface winds and 15 percent
RH will overspread drying fuels over the Trans Pecos region,
necessitating the maintenance of 70 percent Critical probabilities.
The passage of another mid-level trough, surface low, and
accompanying downslope flow, is likely on Day 6 (Saturday), where
dry and windy conditions across far western Texas warrants 40
percent Critical probabilities. Some precipitation accumulations are
possible just east of the Trans Pecos on Wednesday, which may
influence the eastern extent of fire weather highlights for both
Days 3 and 6 in future outlooks. After Saturday, relatively
quiescent fire weather conditions are likely before another
mid-level trough approaches beyond the extended outlook time frame.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0157 PM CST Mon Feb 10 2025

Valid 102000Z - 111200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected through tonight.

...20z Update...
The previous forecast remains largely unchanged with minor
adjustments. Broad-scale ascent/warm air advection is increasing
across portions of the southern Plains, with elevated showers
ongoing within a weakly unstable air mass. Gradual intensification
of these showers into widely scattered thunderstorms is likely over
the southern Plains and ArkLaTex tonight. The thunder area was
expanded slightly farther east to better cover higher thunder
potential from recent guidance. Otherwise, the severe risk remains
low. See the prior outlook for additional info.

..Lyons.. 02/10/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1019 AM CST Mon Feb 10 2025/

...Central/North Texas and eastern Oklahoma/western Arkansas...
Broadly cyclonic flow aloft will continue over the CONUS with
gradual trough amplification over the northern Intermountain West,
Great Basin and Lower Colorado River Valley. Focused by increasing
warm advection and isentropic ascent within the elevated frontal
zone, thunderstorms may develop as early as this afternoon across
south-central/eastern Oklahoma into western Arkansas, and then more
broadly late tonight in a northeast-southwest corridor across
North/central Texas toward the Edwards Plateau. While vertical shear
will be strong within the cloud-bearing layer, seasonally mild
mid-level temperatures and residual subsidence-related capping in
the mid-levels will likely preclude meaningful hail potential with
this elevated convection.

Valid 131200Z - 181200Z

...DISCUSSION...
There appears to be severe potential along parts of the East Coast
as the initial trough moves offshore on Thursday. In advance of the
next trough, initial moisture return into the lower Mississippi
Valley region could promote some severe potential late Friday.
Uncertainty in the environment/forcing precludes highlights both
days. Severe weather potential increases further on Saturday in the
Southeast and may linger into Sunday along the East Coast. For
Monday, broad surface high pressure and cold air east of the Divide
will minimize severe risk. 

...Southeast...
There has been a consistent signal for a potent upper-level trough
to move into the West Coast on Friday. In response to this trough, a
deep surface low is expected to develop in eastern Colorado and move
into Oklahoma. These features will promote strong moisture return
into parts of the central Gulf Coast states late Friday into
Saturday. Appreciable moisture return may reach into the Mid-South.
This setup would favor scattered to numerous severe storms from the
Sabine Valley vicinity into much of Mississippi/Alabama. Both
low-level and deep-layer shear would be strong in this regime. The
surging cold front will likely be the primary focus for storms, but
the strong synoptic forcing within a potentially weakly capped
boundary-layer could also bring about more discrete storms ahead of
the line as well. The primary uncertainties will be the
timing/amplitude of the trough as well northward/eastward extent of
sufficient buoyancy. With the consistent signal in deterministic and
ML guidance, 15% severe probabilities appear warranted for Saturday.
Refinement of the highlighted area is probable as additional data
becomes available. 

...Carolinas into Mid-Atlantic...
As the strong trough, surface low, and cold front continue east on
Sunday, there will be some potential for additional severe storms
from the Mid-Atlantic in to portions of the Carolinas. It is not
clear if the timing of these features will be well phased with the
diurnal cycle. Trends in guidance will continue to be monitored.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE SABINE
VALLEY INTO FAR WESTERN ALABAMA...

...SUMMARY...
A few severe storms will be possible Wednesday afternoon into
Wednesday night from the Sabine Valley vicinity into far western
Alabama.

...Synopsis...
As the shortwave trough near the ArkLaTex moves northeastward
through the day on Wednesday, moisture return from the Gulf will
continue ahead of a cold front that will move through the Lower
Mississippi Valley and parts of the Southeast Wednesday
evening/overnight.

...Sabine Valley into far western Alabama...
Precipitation, likely north of the surface boundary, will be ongoing
Wednesday morning. This will have impact on both frontal position
and the exact degree of destabilization that can occur later in the
day. As the trough moves northeast, low to mid 60s F dewpoints will
move northward into much of Louisiana into central Mississippi and
portions of Alabama. Upper 60s F dewpoints are possible near the
Gulf Coast. As a surface low develops near the ArkLaTex late in the
morning, storm development in the warm sector is possible near the
Sabine Valley. Storms are expected to be at least near surface
based. Storm development along the front is likely to continue
through the period given strong low-level warm advection. This
activity may occasionally be strong to severe given the 50-60 kts of
effective shear. However, front-parallel shear will lead to storm
interactions and little surge in the line. The front will eventually
move southeastward, but this will not occur until the evening and
overnight periods. Buoyancy will decrease with northward and
eastward extent, but stronger forcing from the shortwave may
compensate. Moisture advection should keep inhibition minimal even
into the evening. The strong low-level winds and enlarged hodographs
would suggest some threat of damaging winds as well as a tornado or
two. The linear forcing from the front should limit the tornado
threat. Development of storms in the open warm sector does not
appear probable given the warmer layers aloft and the arrival of
mid-level cooling during th early/mid evening.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHWESTERN NEW
MEXICO...

...Synopsis...
A substantial midlevel trough, accompanied by strengthening westerly
flow aloft, will cross the Lower CO River Valley during the day. At
the same time, a related surface low will deepen over the Four
Corners before drifting southeastward across NM. South of the
surface low, a tightening pressure gradient will support 20-25 mph
sustained west-southwesterly surface winds amid 15-20 percent RH
across southeast AZ, southern/central NM, and the TX Trans-Pecos.
The best overlap of strong/gusty surface winds and low RH is
expected over portions of southwestern NM during the afternoon, and
given increasingly dry fuels, critical fire-weather conditions are
expected here.

...Synopsis...
Within the base of a large-scale trough over the West, an embedded
shortwave trough will track eastward across the Southwest. This will
encourage a broad area of surface low pressure over the southern
Rockies and High Plains. Along/south of the surface low, a modest
pressure gradient, coupled with boundary-layer mixing into a belt of
strong flow aloft, will favor 15-20 mph sustained west-southwesterly
surface winds (with higher gusts) across portions of NM. While
mid/high-level clouds will limit diurnal heating and RH reductions
to an extent, dry antecedent conditions and at least filtered
heating should still yield 15-25 percent minimum RH. As a result,
elevated fire-weather conditions are expected.

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated to scattered thunderstorms are possible from the southern
Plains into the lower Mississippi Valley on Tuesday. Severe weather
is not currently anticipated.

...Synopsis...
Broad upper-level troughing is expected to evolve over much of the
West on Tuesday. A shortwave perturbation is expected to eject into
the southern Plains late Tuesday into Wednesday morning. At the
surface, a cold front should extend from the southern High Plains
into central Texas before arcing northeastward along the upper Texas
Gulf Coast and into the lower Mississippi Valley.

...Southern Plains to Lower Mississippi Valley...
Precipitation is likely to be ongoing early Tuesday morning. Most of
this activity will be occurring on the cool side of the boundary.
This should reinforce the front, though some modest northward
progression of warmer, moist air may occur within the coastal plain
regions. Potential for surface-based storms south of the boundary in
southeast Texas/Sabine Valley vicinity appears low as the low-level
jet will weaken during the morning/afternoon and mid-level ascent
will be weak. Furthermore, forecast soundings indicate poor lapse
rates in the column and warm layers that will inhibit updraft
intensity. Overnight Tuesday into Wednesday morning, additional
isolated to scattered storms are possible from the Edwards Plateau
into Central/Northeast Texas as mid-level forcing and 850 mb warm
advection increases. Again, these storms will be elevated on the
cool side of the boundary. The strongest of these storms could
produce small hail. The overall severe threat appears too
isolated/uncertain for unconditional probabilities.
