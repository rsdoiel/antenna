Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0337 AM CST Mon Feb 10 2025

Valid 131200Z - 181200Z

...DISCUSSION...
There appears to be severe potential along parts of the East Coast
as the initial trough moves offshore on Thursday. In advance of the
next trough, initial moisture return into the lower Mississippi
Valley region could promote some severe potential late Friday.
Uncertainty in the environment/forcing precludes highlights both
days. Severe weather potential increases further on Saturday in the
Southeast and may linger into Sunday along the East Coast. For
Monday, broad surface high pressure and cold air east of the Divide
will minimize severe risk. 

...Southeast...
There has been a consistent signal for a potent upper-level trough
to move into the West Coast on Friday. In response to this trough, a
deep surface low is expected to develop in eastern Colorado and move
into Oklahoma. These features will promote strong moisture return
into parts of the central Gulf Coast states late Friday into
Saturday. Appreciable moisture return may reach into the Mid-South.
This setup would favor scattered to numerous severe storms from the
Sabine Valley vicinity into much of Mississippi/Alabama. Both
low-level and deep-layer shear would be strong in this regime. The
surging cold front will likely be the primary focus for storms, but
the strong synoptic forcing within a potentially weakly capped
boundary-layer could also bring about more discrete storms ahead of
the line as well. The primary uncertainties will be the
timing/amplitude of the trough as well northward/eastward extent of
sufficient buoyancy. With the consistent signal in deterministic and
ML guidance, 15% severe probabilities appear warranted for Saturday.
Refinement of the highlighted area is probable as additional data
becomes available. 

...Carolinas into Mid-Atlantic...
As the strong trough, surface low, and cold front continue east on
Sunday, there will be some potential for additional severe storms
from the Mid-Atlantic in to portions of the Carolinas. It is not
clear if the timing of these features will be well phased with the
diurnal cycle. Trends in guidance will continue to be monitored.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE SABINE
VALLEY INTO FAR WESTERN ALABAMA...

...SUMMARY...
A few severe storms will be possible Wednesday afternoon into
Wednesday night from the Sabine Valley vicinity into far western
Alabama.

...Synopsis...
As the shortwave trough near the ArkLaTex moves northeastward
through the day on Wednesday, moisture return from the Gulf will
continue ahead of a cold front that will move through the Lower
Mississippi Valley and parts of the Southeast Wednesday
evening/overnight.

...Sabine Valley into far western Alabama...
Precipitation, likely north of the surface boundary, will be ongoing
Wednesday morning. This will have impact on both frontal position
and the exact degree of destabilization that can occur later in the
day. As the trough moves northeast, low to mid 60s F dewpoints will
move northward into much of Louisiana into central Mississippi and
portions of Alabama. Upper 60s F dewpoints are possible near the
Gulf Coast. As a surface low develops near the ArkLaTex late in the
morning, storm development in the warm sector is possible near the
Sabine Valley. Storms are expected to be at least near surface
based. Storm development along the front is likely to continue
through the period given strong low-level warm advection. This
activity may occasionally be strong to severe given the 50-60 kts of
effective shear. However, front-parallel shear will lead to storm
interactions and little surge in the line. The front will eventually
move southeastward, but this will not occur until the evening and
overnight periods. Buoyancy will decrease with northward and
eastward extent, but stronger forcing from the shortwave may
compensate. Moisture advection should keep inhibition minimal even
into the evening. The strong low-level winds and enlarged hodographs
would suggest some threat of damaging winds as well as a tornado or
two. The linear forcing from the front should limit the tornado
threat. Development of storms in the open warm sector does not
appear probable given the warmer layers aloft and the arrival of
mid-level cooling during th early/mid evening.

Valid 111200Z - 121200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHWESTERN NEW
MEXICO...

...Synopsis...
A substantial midlevel trough, accompanied by strengthening westerly
flow aloft, will cross the Lower CO River Valley during the day. At
the same time, a related surface low will deepen over the Four
Corners before drifting southeastward across NM. South of the
surface low, a tightening pressure gradient will support 20-25 mph
sustained west-southwesterly surface winds amid 15-20 percent RH
across southeast AZ, southern/central NM, and the TX Trans-Pecos.
The best overlap of strong/gusty surface winds and low RH is
expected over portions of southwestern NM during the afternoon, and
given increasingly dry fuels, critical fire-weather conditions are
expected here.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0159 AM CST Mon Feb 10 2025

Valid 101200Z - 111200Z

...Synopsis...
Within the base of a large-scale trough over the West, an embedded
shortwave trough will track eastward across the Southwest. This will
encourage a broad area of surface low pressure over the southern
Rockies and High Plains. Along/south of the surface low, a modest
pressure gradient, coupled with boundary-layer mixing into a belt of
strong flow aloft, will favor 15-20 mph sustained west-southwesterly
surface winds (with higher gusts) across portions of NM. While
mid/high-level clouds will limit diurnal heating and RH reductions
to an extent, dry antecedent conditions and at least filtered
heating should still yield 15-25 percent minimum RH. As a result,
elevated fire-weather conditions are expected.

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated to scattered thunderstorms are possible from the southern
Plains into the lower Mississippi Valley on Tuesday. Severe weather
is not currently anticipated.

...Synopsis...
Broad upper-level troughing is expected to evolve over much of the
West on Tuesday. A shortwave perturbation is expected to eject into
the southern Plains late Tuesday into Wednesday morning. At the
surface, a cold front should extend from the southern High Plains
into central Texas before arcing northeastward along the upper Texas
Gulf Coast and into the lower Mississippi Valley.

...Southern Plains to Lower Mississippi Valley...
Precipitation is likely to be ongoing early Tuesday morning. Most of
this activity will be occurring on the cool side of the boundary.
This should reinforce the front, though some modest northward
progression of warmer, moist air may occur within the coastal plain
regions. Potential for surface-based storms south of the boundary in
southeast Texas/Sabine Valley vicinity appears low as the low-level
jet will weaken during the morning/afternoon and mid-level ascent
will be weak. Furthermore, forecast soundings indicate poor lapse
rates in the column and warm layers that will inhibit updraft
intensity. Overnight Tuesday into Wednesday morning, additional
isolated to scattered storms are possible from the Edwards Plateau
into Central/Northeast Texas as mid-level forcing and 850 mb warm
advection increases. Again, these storms will be elevated on the
cool side of the boundary. The strongest of these storms could
produce small hail. The overall severe threat appears too
isolated/uncertain for unconditional probabilities.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0648 AM CST Sun Feb 09 2025

Valid 091300Z - 101200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
A low risk for a few thunderstorms exists early in the period across
the Mid-South region.

...Synopsis...
Broadly cyclonic flow aloft, with several embedded shortwave
troughs, is expected across the northern CONUS today. Largely zonal
flow is anticipated across the southern CONUS, with negligible
height changes. Recent surface analysis shows an expansive area of
high pressure associated with a dry, continental airmass covering
much of the central and eastern CONUS. A weak frontal boundary is in
place from the TX Coastal Plains northeastward across the Southeast
States into NC, between the cooler and dry airmass to its north and
the modified Gulf airmass to its south. A slow southward progression
of this front is anticipated throughout the day, with this front
likely extending from southern GA westward along the Gulf Coast into
South TX by 12Z Monday.

...Arklatex into the Mid-South...
Modest warm-air advection across the frontal zone mentioned in the
synopsis is contributing to showers and isolated thunderstorms
across Arkansas this morning. 12Z LZK sounding sampled the airmass
supporting these showers and thunderstorms well, with a notable warm
nose contributing to scant elevated buoyancy above about 850 mb. The
warm-air advection is expected to persist over the region for at
least the next several hours, while it gradually shifts eastward and
weakens. This will support the potential for isolated thunderstorms
this morning from the Arklatex eastward into the Mid-South, with the
overall thunderstorm potential diminishing with eastern extent.
