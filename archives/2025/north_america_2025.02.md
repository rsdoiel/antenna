## Rubio vows to place US interests 'above all else' as Trump's top diplomat

date: 2025-01-15, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Florida Sen. Marco Rubio is promising to implement President-elect Donald Trump's "America First" vision as secretary of state, vowing in his confirmation hearing Wednesday that the incoming administration will forge a new path by placing American interests "above all else." 


"Placing our core national interests above all else is not isolationism," Rubio will tell the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, according to an opening statement obtained by The Associated Press. "It is the commonsense realization that a foreign policy centered on our national interest is not some outdated relic." 


"The postwar global order is not just obsolete; it is now a weapon being used against us," Rubio says. 


It's a remarkable opening salvo from Rubio, who was born in Miami to Cuban immigrants, and who, if confirmed, would become the first Latino ever to serve as the nation's top diplomat. 


The confirmation hearing begins a new chapter in the political career of the 53-year-old Florida Republican, whose relationship with Trump has evolved over the last decade. Once rivals trading schoolyard insults as they campaigned for president in 2016, the two men became close allies as Trump campaigned for another White House term last year. 


Rubio first came to Washington as part of the "tea party" wave in 2010 and once advocated for allowing a path to citizenship for immigrants in the country illegally. But like other Republicans, Rubio's views on immigration have shifted toward the hardline stance of Trump, who has pledged to aggressively pursue deportations once he takes office on Monday. 


Unlike many of Trump's Cabinet selections, Rubio is expected to easily win confirmation, notching support not only from Republicans but also Democrats who endorse him as a "responsible" pick to represent the U.S. abroad. Many expect he will be among the first of Trump's Cabinet picks approved. 


Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz, who served alongside Rubio on the Foreign Relations Committee, said he has high hopes that the Florida Republican will reject the isolationist approach of other Trump allies. 


"I think Marco is a hawk, but he's also an internationalist, and I think the challenge for him will be to maintain the long bipartisan tradition of America being indispensable in world affairs," the Hawaii lawmaker told AP. "And there are people in the Trump world who want us to run away from being the leaders of the free world. And I'm hoping that Marco's instincts towards American strength will win the day." 


Rubio's approach to foreign affairs is grounded in his years of service on the Foreign Relations committee and the Senate Intelligence panel. In his speeches and writings, he's delivered increasingly stern warnings about growing military and economic threats to the United States, particularly from China, which he says has benefited from a "global world order" that he characterizes as obsolete. 


China, Rubio will tell the committee, has "lied, cheated, hacked, and stolen their way to global superpower status, at our expense." 


If confirmed, Rubio will become the leader of U.S. foreign policy — though his role will surely remain secondary to Trump, who relishes the global stage and frequently uses the bully pulpit against America's allies. 


Even before taking office, Trump has stirred angst in foreign capitals by threatening to seize the Panama Canal and Greenland and suggesting he will pressure Canada to become the nation's 51st state. 


By winning another term, Trump has won an "unmistakable mandate from the voters," Rubio will say. 


"They want a strong America. Engaged in the world. But guided by a clear objective, to promote peace abroad, and security and prosperity here at home." 


A Biden administration decision to rescind Cuba's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism with just days left in office is likely to irk Rubio, who has long supported tough sanctions on the communist-run island. 


Rubio's office did not respond to multiple queries Tuesday about the senator's reaction to the move, which many believe will almost certainly be reversed by the Trump administration. 


Secretaries of state have played a key role in formulating the foreign policy of the country since its founding, starting with the first one, Thomas Jefferson, who served in the top Cabinet position under President George Washington. 


Since then, Jefferson, as well as his 19th century successors James Madison, James Monroe, John Quincy Adams, Martin Van Buren and James Buchanan, have all gone on to be elected president. 


More recent secretaries of state have been less successful in their political ambitions, including John Kerry, who lost the 2004 presidential election to President George W. Bush before becoming the top diplomat, and Hillary Clinton, who lost the 2016 election to Trump. 


The most successful secretaries of state have been known for their closeness to the presidents whom they serve, notably James Baker under George H.W. Bush, Condoleezza Rice under George W. Bush and, to some extent, Clinton under Barack Obama. 


Like Clinton, Rubio was once a political rival to the president-elect who nominated them. However, the Clinton-Obama relationship during the 2008 Democratic primaries was not nearly as hostile as that between Trump and Rubio in the 2016 GOP primaries, which was marked by name-calling and personal insults. 


Trump had an acrimonious relationship with his first secretary of state, Rex Tillerson. Trump fired him from the position via a social media post less than two years into his term.

## A Beginner’s Guide to the Hydrogen Economy

	Hydrogen. What are you even supposed to think about it? If you’ve spent serious time focusing on climate policy, you’ve heard the hype about hydrogen — about the miraculous things that it might do to eliminate carbon pollution from cars, power plants, steel mills, or more. You’ve also seen that hype fizzle out — even as governments have poured billions of dollars into making it work.
</p><p>
	On this week’s episode of Shift Key, Rob and Jesse give you a rough guide for how to think about clean hydrogen, which could help decarbonize the industrial — even the molecular — side of the economy by storing energy and helping to make clean steel and chemicals. Do we really need hydrogen to fight climate change? Where would it be useful? And why has it failed to take off in the past? What will Trump and China mean for global hydrogen policy? Shift Key is hosted by Robinson Meyer, the founding executive editor of Heatmap, and Jesse Jenkins, a professor of energy systems engineering at Princeton University.

Here is an excerpt from our conversation:</p><blockquote><strong>Jesse Jenkins: </strong>This is the next crazy thing that I think is just starting to kind of bubble up to the public awareness: Basically, hydrogen itself is not a climate forcer. It doesn’t warm the planet the way methane or [hydrofluorocarbons] or CO2 does. But it does react in the atmosphere in ways that increase the concentration of greenhouse gases.<br/><br/><strong>Robinson Meyer: </strong>I think specifically that right now, we talk about when methane leaks into the atmosphere. And it may apply to other greenhouse gases, too, but the big one that you tend to hear about is that when methane leaks into the atmosphere from natural gas — and of course, we’re very worried about methane leaks. Because the thing about methane is that it traps a lot of heat, but it breaks down really quickly, right? So it tends to break down, unlike carbon dioxide, which, when you release it into the atmosphere. sticks around for millennia. When you release it into the atmosphere, it captures a lot of heat, but then breaks down into a smaller amount of CO2 after about 20 years.<br/> <br/>The issue, and why it breaks down, that — we never talk about this, or we had no need to talk about this until hydrogen — and it’s crazy because the world is a closed system, or a largely closed system, right? Why it breaks down is it reacts with the free hydroxyl radicals floating around in the atmosphere.<br/><br/><strong>Jenkins: </strong>Right, OH molecules.<br/> <br/><strong>Meyer:</strong> Well, what else reacts with OH molecules? Hydrogen. And so if we leak too much industrially produced hydrogen into the atmosphere, it could mess with the rate of breakdown of all methane in the global atmosphere, and thus increase the global warming potential of natural gas.<br/><br/><strong>Jenkins: </strong>It makes the methane last, traps more heat, yeah. So let the record show that Robinson Meyer, the journalist, accurately captured the atmospheric chemistry of this process better than Jesse Jenkins, professor at Princeton. Nicely done.<br/></blockquote><div class="horizontal-rule"></div><p>This episode of Shift Key is sponsored by …</p><p><strong>Intersolar & Energy Storage North America</strong> is the premier U.S.-based conference and trade show focused on solar, energy storage, and EV charging infrastructure.

## California firefighters battle wildfires as forecasters warn of dangerous winds

date: 2025-01-15, from: VOA News USA

Warnings were in place again Wednesday in the Los Angeles area for the prospect of strong winds combining with dry conditions to spread wildfires as firefighters battled a series of blazes in the region that have already killed at least 25 people.


After winds were weaker than expected during the day Tuesday, the National Weather Service said the region was “not out of the woods yet,” with the potential for a surge in winds through early Wednesday afternoon.


Utility companies shut off power to more than 77,000 households to prevent their power lines from sparking new blazes.


The winds threatened to undermine incremental gains that firefighters have made in recent days as they try to control two main fires that have been burning since last week, as well as a smaller fire that sparked Monday.


The California Department of Foresty and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) said the Palisades Fire on the western side of Los Angeles had burned 96 square kilometers and was 18% contained as of early Wednesday.


The Eaton Fire in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains on the east side of the city was 35% contained and has burned 57 square kilometers, Cal Fire said.


About 88,000 people remained under evacuation orders with another nearly 85,000 being warned they might be ordered to evacuate. Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna encouraged people to consider leaving when they get a warning without waiting for an order. He said deputies have had to rescue many people who waited until the last minute after receiving orders. 


Authorities said nearly 30 people remain missing, and that the death toll was likely to rise as search crews gain access to areas that have already burned.


Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass told reporters she took an aerial tour of the affected areas on Monday.


“The massive, massive destruction is unimaginable until you actually see it,” Bass said. 


Some information for this report is from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.

## US, Japanese companies send landers on moon missions

date: 2025-01-15, from: VOA News USA

Two moon landers built by private U.S. and Japanese companies are on their way to the moon after lifting off early Wednesday on a shared ride aboard a SpaceX rocket.


The launch from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida is the latest in a public-private program that put a spacecraft from Intuitive Machines on the moon last year.


Wednesday’s launch included a lander from Japanese space exploration company ispace that is carrying a rover with the capability of collecting lunar dirt and testing potential food and water sources on the moon.


The spacecraft is also carrying a small red “Moonhouse” built by Swedish artist Mikael Genberg.


The ispace mission is expected to reach its destination on the moon’s far north in four to five months.


The company is making its second attempt at a lunar landing, after a 2023 mission failed in the final stages. 


Also aboard the rocket heading toward the moon is a lander from U.S. company Firefly Aerospace that is set to carry out 10 experiments for NASA.


The planned experiments include gathering dirt and measuring subsurface temperatures.


The spacecraft is expected to arrive in about 45 days.


Some information for this story was provided by The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters

## Why did  US exclude India from unrestricted access to AI chips?

date: 2025-01-15, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON  — U.S. President Joe Biden signed on Tuesday an executive order to boost development of artificial intelligence infrastructure in America. A day earlier, his administration announced sweeping measures to block access to the most advanced semiconductors by China and other adversaries.


But the U.S. left India, its strategic partner in the Indo-Pacific, off a list of 18 countries that are allowed unrestricted access to advanced AI chips. Analysts say while a growing technological relationship between the two countries would likely make India eligible in the future to access advanced U.S. AI chips, New Delhi's existing ties with Moscow and the perception of a less robust technology regulatory framework led to its exclusion from the top list.


Exclusion not a surprise


The Commerce Department's policy framework divides the world into three categories. The first tier includes the U.S. and 18 countries with unrestricted access, followed by a list of more than 100 countries that will be subjected to new caps on advanced semiconductors with individual exemptions. The third tier includes adversaries such as China and Russia that face maximum restrictions.


India falls in the second category, along with U.S. allies like Israel and close friends such as Singapore.


Bhaskar Chakravorti, the dean of global business at The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in Massachusetts, said that India's relationship with Russia "puts it outside a super safe category."


India has had close ties with Russia since the Soviet Union supported its desire for independence from Britain. It maintained those ties during the Cold War, when the U.S. sided with India's rival Pakistan.


Scott Jones, a non-resident fellow at Washington's Stimson Center think tank, highlighted recent reports that accused a few Indian companies of aiding Russia's war on Ukraine, but stressed that while being excluded is a disappointment, it's "not a setback for India."


He also pointed to the perception that "India's ability to control and manage technology is perhaps not as robust as evidenced in some of the 18 countries."


While India may be off the unrestricted list for now, analysts say its growing technological cooperation with the U.S. may shield it from some curbs.


Richard Rossow, senior adviser and chair on India and Emerging Asia Economies at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the presence of caveats in the new framework would ensure India's later participation.


"The fact that they have announced that there will be a pathway for some countries to get exemptions that are above what they're going to consider the standard cap, India, I imagine, would be on the short list of countries," he told VOA.


In early January, national security adviser Jake Sullivan traveled to India and met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other senior officials. During the trip, both sides reiterated their commitment to forge a "strategic technology partnership" and strengthen cooperation under the U.S.-India initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET), a bilateral mechanism focused on technology partnership.


On semiconductors, the U.S. is facilitating investments in India's semiconductor manufacturing and intensifying R&D collaboration.


During his trip, Sullivan highlighted the investment of $2.7 billion in India by U.S. chipmaker Micron to create semiconductor packaging facilities, which he hoped would contribute to establishing "India as a new hub in the global chip ecosystem."


The Indian government too is investing billions of dollars through its dedicated program called the India Semiconductor Mission and Production Linked Incentive scheme.


Rossow argued that the Indian government would not have been "terribly surprised" that "they were not included" in the list.


Jones of the Stimson Center agreed.


"Jake Sullivan was in New Delhi last week, and I would be very surprised if he did not inform his Indian counterparts of what was going to happen," he said.


Ensuring America's leadership in AI


The Biden administration has focused on the centrality of artificial intelligence to America's security and economic strength. According to a White House factsheet, the latest steps are part of its effort to prevent offshoring this critical technology and ensure that "the world's AI runs on American rails."


Since October 2022, the U.S. government has enacted a series of export controls, blocking access of advanced semiconductors to China to prevent its use for military applications. While initially the measures adversely affected the Chinese semiconductor industry, Beijing has continued to advance its capabilities and is attempting to narrow the technology gap.


According to Chakravorti of the Fletcher School, there are numerous implementation challenges of this expansive global strategy.


"From lobbying from the U.S. chipmakers that will start as soon as Trump takes office to potential leaks in the carefully calibrated list of countries. Will there be a secondary market? How does this affect where future data centers are built?" he asked.


Jones of the Stimson Center argued that the policy is more a "symbolic gesture than a practical consideration" but has a stern message for the rest of the world.


"The U.S. is clearly saying, if you want to participate in the U.S.-sponsored AI ecosystem, you have to pick now. You pick China or you pick us. You can't have it both ways. You can't play one off against the other. You have to choose," he concluded.

## US SEC sues Elon Musk over late disclosure of Twitter stake

date: 2025-01-15, from: VOA News USA

Elon Musk was sued on Tuesday by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which accused the world's richest person of waiting too long to disclose in 2022 he had amassed a large stake in Twitter, the social media company he later bought.


In a complaint filed in Washington, the SEC said Musk violated federal securities law by waiting 11 days too long to disclose his initial purchase of 5% of Twitter's common shares.


An SEC rule requires investors to disclose within 10 calendar days, or by March 24, 2022, in Musk's case, when they cross a 5% ownership threshold.


The SEC said that at the expense of unsuspecting investors, Musk bought more than $500 million of Twitter shares at artificially low prices before finally revealing his purchases on April 4, 2022, by which time he owned a 9.2% stake.


Twitter's share price rose more than 27% following that disclosure, the SEC said.


Tuesday's lawsuit seeks to force Musk to pay a civil fine and disgorge profits he didn't deserve.


Musk eventually purchased Twitter for $44 billion in October 2022, and renamed it X.


Alex Spiro, a lawyer for Musk, in an email called the SEC lawsuit the culmination of the regulator's "multi-year campaign of harassment" against his client.


"Today's action is an admission by the SEC that they cannot bring an actual case," he said. "Mr. Musk has done nothing wrong and everyone sees this sham for what it is."


Spiro added that the lawsuit addresses a mere "alleged administrative failure to file a single form — an offense that, even if proven, carries a nominal penalty."


Musk, an adviser to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, is worth $417 billion according to Forbes magazine, through businesses such as the electric car maker Tesla and rocket company.


He is worth nearly twice as much as Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, the world's second-richest person at $232 billion, Forbes said.


The SEC sued Musk six days before Trump's January 20 presidential inauguration.


SEC Chairman Gary Gensler is stepping down that day, and Paul Atkins, who Trump nominated to succeed him, is expected to review many of Gensler's rules and enforcement actions.


Musk has also been sued in Manhattan federal court by former Twitter shareholders over the late disclosure.


In that case, Musk has said it was implausible to believe he wanted to defraud other shareholders, and that "all indications" were that his delay was a mistake.


Musk has long feuded with the SEC, including after it sued him in 2018 over his Twitter posts about possibly taking Tesla private and having secured funding to do so.


He settled that lawsuit by paying a $20 million civil fine, agreeing to have Tesla lawyers review some Twitter posts in advance, and giving up his role as Tesla's chairman.


The SEC also sought sanctions from Musk after he missed court-ordered testimony last September for the Twitter probe so he could attend the launch of SpaceX's Polaris Dawn mission at Florida's Cape Canaveral.


A federal judge in San Francisco rejected that request, because Musk later testified and agreed to pay the SEC's travel costs.

## Biden announces 2 new national monuments in California

date: 2025-01-15, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — In an announcement postponed by the Los Angeles wildfires, President Joe Biden on Tuesday designated two sites in California as national monuments that will honor Native American tribes while shielding picturesque mountains and deserts from mining and energy development.


Biden made the designations at an event at the White House, a week after and on the other side of the country from where he'd originally planned to do so with a speech in California's Eastern Coachella Valley.


The president landed in California on January 6 but made it as far as Los Angeles before high winds — which helped spark the Los Angeles blazes — forced officials to scrap the event. It was a stark reminder that, even as Biden uses the last days of his administration to attempt to safeguard the environment, climate change is already helping to exacerbate natural disasters.


Instead, Biden spoke next to screens featuring towering peaks, desert vistas and an array of plant and animal life.


"I was hoping we were going to do this in place," the president said. "This is as close as we could get."


Biden formally created the Chuckwalla National Monument, in Southern California near Joshua Tree National Park, and the Sáttítla Highlands National Monument, in Northern California.


The declarations bar oil and natural gas drilling, as well as mining and other exploration and production initiatives, on the 2,400-square-kilometer Chuckwalla site, and roughly 800 square kilometers near the California-Oregon border.


The protected area encompasses natural wonders, including the Painted Canyon of Mecca Hills and Alligator Rock, and is home to 50-plus rare species of plants and animals like the desert bighorn sheep and the Chuckwalla lizard, which the monument is named for, the White House said in a statement.


At the event, Biden talked about taking his children to national monuments around the country yearly when they were young to "witness the majesty, the beauty."


"Our national wonders are the heart and soul of this nation," he said. "It's a birthright we pass on from generation to generation."


The monuments becoming realities honor past tribal requests. Many Native American tribes and environmental groups have pushed for designation of the Chuckwalla National Monument, while the Pit River Tribe has worked to get the federal government to designate the Sáttítla Highlands National Monument.


Biden joked about being careful not to mispronounce Sáttítla, then still struggled to pronounce it. When he sat down to sign the formal acts, he simply referred to it as the "highlands" monument, so he didn't have to give it another try.


The designations are part of a larger Biden administration effort to conserve at least 30% of U.S. lands and waters by 2030. They follow Biden's recent move banning new offshore oil and gas drilling in most U.S. coastal waters, including in California.


That was an attempt to thwart possible efforts by the incoming Republican administration to expand offshore drilling, but President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to quickly reverse the order.

## Biden to lift state sponsor of terrorism designation on Cuba

date: 2025-01-15, from: VOA News USA

U.S. President Joe Biden notified Congress on Tuesday that he intends to delist Cuba as a U.S.-designated state sponsor of terrorism in a deal facilitated by the Catholic Church to free political prisoners on the island. 


Speaking on the condition of anonymity before the announcement, senior administration officials told reporters that dozens of political prisoners and others deemed unjustly detained by U.S. officials would be freed by noon on January 20. 


The announcement also indicated the U.S. would aim to reduce economic pressure on the island nation. 


"Today's actions demonstrate that President Biden's Cuba policy, which is focused on achieving practical results with respect to human rights in Cuba, will pay dividends for the Cuban people," a senior official told reporters, acknowledging Havana's "direct dialogue with the Catholic Church."   


Hours after Biden's announcement, Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel said his government would gradually release 553 prisoners after talks with the church.  


Earlier, his government expressed gratitude.  


"Despite its limited scope, this is a decision that points to the right direction and is in line with the sustained and firm demand by the government and the people of Cuba," the country's foreign ministry said in a press release. 


"The decision announced today by the United States, rectifies, in a very limited way, some aspects of a cruel and unjust policy," it added. 


In Congress, the backlash to Biden's announcement was swift.  


"Today's decision is unacceptable on its merits," Republican Senator Ted Cruz said in a statement. "The terrorism advanced by the Cuban regime has not ceased. I will work with President Trump and my colleagues to immediately reverse and limit the damage from the decision." 


Fellow Republican Representative Carlos Gimenez also criticized the announcement, predicting a quick reversal on the policy by President-elect Donald Trump. 


"President Biden is a pathetic coward," Gimenez posted on X. "Come January 20th, there will be a NEW SHERIFF in town & President Trump alongside Secretary of State @SenMarcoRubio will not only put #Cuba BACK on the list but PULVERIZE the regime once & for all!" 


According to The Associated Press, human rights groups and activists, including the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, have been pressing the Biden administration to lift the designation to ease the suffering of Cuban people who feel the impact of Cuba's economic isolation. 


Some information for this report is from The Associated Press.

## New Orleans attacker had researched similar rampage, and how to access Bourbon Street balcony

date: 2025-01-14, from: VOA News USA

BATON ROUGE — Before plowing a pickup truck into a crowd of New Year's revelers in New Orleans, killing 14 people, the man who carried out the Islamic State group-inspired attack had researched how to access a balcony on the city's famed Bourbon Street and looked up information about a similar recent attack at a Christmas market in Germany, the FBI said. 


Nearly two weeks after Shamsud-Din Jabbar's rampage, the FBI continues to uncover new information detailing the extensive planning by the 42-year-old Army veteran who scouted out the area multiple times in the months leading up to the attack. Authorities also have been piecing together a timeline of his radicalization. 


In the early hours of New Year's Day, Jabbar could be seen on video surveillance placing two containers with explosive devices, which would remain undetonated, in the French Quarter. Shortly after, about 3:15 a.m., Jabbar sped a white pickup truck around a police car blockading the entrance of Bourbon Street, where partygoers continued to wander around the street lined with bars. He drove through revelers before crashing and being killed by police in a shootout. Fifty-seven people were injured, authorities said. 




Just hours before the deadly onslaught, Jabbar had searched online for information about an attack at a busy outdoor Christmas Market in east Germany that occurred just 10 days earlier and where a car was also used as a mass weapon, the FBI said on Tuesday. The attack in Europe left five people dead and more than 200 injured after a car slammed into a crowd. Police arrested a 50-year-old doctor from Saudi Arabia who has renounced Islam and supports the far-right AfD party. 


In other online searches, Jabbar had looked up how to access a balcony on Bourbon Street, information about Mardi Gras, and several recent shootings in the city, the FBI said. 


But Jabbar's research ahead of the attack was not limited to online: He also made a one-day visit to New Orleans from Houston on Nov. 10, during which he looked for an apartment, the FBI said. While Jabbar applied to rent the apartment, he later told the landlord that he changed his mind. 


That was not his only visit to New Orleans, though. The FBI had previously reported that Jabbar had traveled to the city for a planning trip on Oct. 31, when he used glasses from Meta, the parent company of Facebook, to record video as he rode through the French Quarter on a bicycle. 


In a series of online videos, posted hours before he struck, Jabbar proclaimed support for the Islamic State militant group. The Bourbon Street attack was the deadliest Islamic State-inspired assault on U.S. soil in years. On Tuesday, the FBI continued to draft out a timeline of Jabbar's radicalization, saying that he began isolating himself from society and became a more devout Muslim in 2022. By the spring of 2024, he began following extremist views. 


While investigations into the attack are ongoing and additional information continues to trickle out about Jabbar's planning of the deadly rampage, city officials face questions about safety concerns. 


State and local authorities have launched probes into possible security deficiencies that left New Orleans vulnerable. The work is especially urgent since Carnival season, a monthslong celebration that attracts tens of thousands of visitors to the French Quarter, began last week. The city is also set to host the Super Bowl on Feb. 9.

## The Five Feet That Could Prevent the Next Palisades Fire

date: 2025-01-14, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTU1MTYyMC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1ODkxMzY2OH0.qOdnOv-IMBfte5SFBVy1MTp0mGB9wm6xqY4oeGs-3qY/image.jpg?width=1185&height=793&coordinates=15%2C0%2C0%2C7"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	For more than four years, California has had a law on the books meant to protect homes and buildings during an urban firestorm like the Palisade and Eaton fires. But it’s never gone into effect.
</p><p>
	In theory, the policy was simple. It directed state officials to develop new rules for buildings in areas with high fire risk, which would govern what people were allowed to put within the five-foot perimeter immediately surrounding their homes. A large body of evidence shows that clearing this area, known in the fire mitigation world as “zone zero,” of combustible materials can be the difference between a building that alights during a wildfire and one that can weather the blaze.
</p><p>
	The new rules — essentially just a list of items allowed in that five-foot zone — were due two years ago, by January 1, 2023. But the California Natural Resources Agency, which is drafting the rules for the State Board of Forestry and Fire Protection to consider, has yet to even present a proposal. Ask anyone who’s been following this thread what’s taking so long, and they’ll almost certainly point to one thing: politics.
</p><p>
	“There’s a ton of science about what to do, but the science has run into challenges with social acceptance, and therefore political acceptance,” Michael Wara, director of Stanford University’s Climate and Energy Policy Program, told me. People do not want to be told how they can or can’t landscape or furnish or otherwise adorn the outside of their homes. Inevitably, when the rules do come out, you’ll hear about Gavin Newsom coming to take away people’s decks and policing gardens.
</p><p>
	No one thinks that zone zero rules, if enacted and adhered to, could have prevented fires in the Pacific Palisades or Altadena or saved every structure in the recent fires’ path. But alongside other fire mitigation strategies, zone zero design can significantly lower the chances of a given building burning, and therefore the chances that a fire will spread to neighboring buildings, and ultimately reduce the risk of fires becoming compounding, devastating disasters. Wara likened it to car safety rules like seatbelts and airbags — people still die in car accidents, but far fewer than would otherwise.
</p><p>
	The question now is whether the record-breaking destruction in Los Angeles will be enough to convince people that zone zero rules are effective and worthwhile. Past experience shows the answer is not an obvious yes.
</p><h3>Why homes burn</h3><p>
	There are three ways buildings ignite during a wildfire, Yana Valachovic, a forest scientist with the University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources Fire Network who specializes in community resilience and the built environment, told me. They are either exposed to burning embers, direct flames, or radiant heat, though most often a combination.

	Embers — hot, hard debris of burned material from a fire — can be carried miles away from their origin by the wind and create new spot fires next to homes. “What happens with those embers is they get thrown at the building, they hit the walls, the siding, and then drop to the base and collect at the base,” Valachovic said, “so you can have not just one, but thousands of embers at the base of our structures.”
</p><p>
	Embers can also penetrate buildings through open windows and ventilation systems. If radiant heat from nearby burning structures causes windows to shatter or fall out, that can also create new vectors for embers to enter the home. “Embers find their way,” Valachovic said.
</p><p>
	Fire mitigation experts promote two strategies for reducing vulnerability, and they go hand in hand. The first is <a href="https://readyforwildfire.org/prepare-for-wildfire/hardening-your-home/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>home hardening</u></a>, which could mean building with fire-resistant materials but also includes smaller but effective actions like covering air vents with fine mesh screens and sealing gaps to try to block embers. The second is <a href="https://readyforwildfire.org/prepare-for-wildfire/defensible-space/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>creating so-called “defensible space,”</u></a> or a buffer around the building, where any vegetation is carefully selected and managed to slow the spread of fire to and from the building. California divides defensible space into three different zones: Zone one extends from 5 feet away from the structure to 30 feet, and zone two goes out to 100 feet away. Then, of course, there’s zone zero.
</p><p>
	The state has had regulations on the books to require at least 30 feet of defensible space in high-risk areas since 1965, and it updated the standards to establish a two-zone system in 2006. In both cases, the rules were “really framed around, how do you interrupt flames running at the building?” said Valachovic. The regulations included thinning trees and removing lower branches, clearing some trees that were closer to homes, clearing dead wood and litter, and pruning branches that hang over buildings. But they still allowed for vegetation right up against the house.
</p><p>
	Since then, wildfire post-mortems have found that this scenario of flames burning a path to a building is not a primary driver of structure loss. “It was missing the point,” Valachovic told me of the previous rule structure. “What we’ve seen now for the last decade is that embers are really driving our home loss issue, and so we’re basically allowing all this vegetation and combustible material to be present in the zone that is really very vulnerable.”

	In August 2020, after Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in California due to an explosion of wildfires, the state legislature passed AB 3074, which finally sought to bridge the gap by creating a new, “ember-resistant zone” — zone zero. Had the rules been implemented under the timeline mandated by the law, new homes would have had to comply beginning in 2023, and existing homes would have had to comply beginning in 2024. Like the earlier defensible space rules, they would have applied to homes located in parts of the state designated as Fire Hazard Severity Zones. These are generally areas that you might think of as the “wildland-urban interface,” where homes abut wildland vegetation like forests or scrublands, but others extend into more urban areas. Almost all of the burned area in the Pacific Palisades, for instance, would have been <a href="https://lacounty.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=d2ea45d15c784adfa601e84b38060c4e" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>subject to the rules</u></a>, while only a small portion of the homes in Altadena are in the zone.
</p><h3>
	Why “zone zero” is political
</h3><p>
	When I reached out to the California Natural Resources Agency to ask if there was an updated timeline for the regulations, one of the first things that Tony Andersen, the Deputy Secretary for Communications, told me, was not about the timeline but about the ultimate cost of compliance.
</p><p>
	“We recognize there are costs associated with doing this work around homes and structures,” Andersen told me via email, “and we are focused on identifying options for financial assistance as well as education and outreach to help owners prepare and prioritize mitigations.” He then noted that the rulemaking was a “complex process” that the agency wanted to get right, and said it aimed to present a draft proposal to the Board “as soon as is feasible, most likely in the coming months.”
</p><p>
	Andersen’s response illustrates one of several tensions that have made it difficult to write the zone zero rules — and will ultimately make them difficult to implement. If the rules say you can’t have a wooden deck, for example, or you can’t have a fence that touches the building, homeowners could face costly retrofits. And despite witnessing the horror of destructive wildfires, many homeowners don’t want to switch their wooden fence for a metal one, or replace their bushes with gravel.
</p><p>
	Five feet might sound like a negligible amount of space, but people are attached to the aesthetics of this zone. Homeowners have become used to “softening” the line where the walls meet the ground by filling it in with vegetation, Valachovic told me. “We really developed this idea that we don’t visually want to see our foundations,” she said. “From a fire defense perspective, this idea that we have combustible material basically ringing our houses and our structures, that is problematic.”
</p><p>
	Several people I interviewed for this story asked if I had seen a documentary about the aftermath of the 2018 Camp Fire in Paradise, California called <em><em>Bring Your Own Brigade</em></em>. The film captures a series of city council meetings in 2019, when officials were considering updating local building standards. They weigh a number of ideas that would reduce the risk of embers collecting on top of, inside, or next to homes, including eliminating gutters and requiring roof overhangs and a five-foot setback for any combustible material.
</p><p>
	At the time, the Camp Fire was the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in state history, killing 85 people, displacing more than 50,000, and destroying more than 18,000 structures. But during a public hearing, community members lashed out at the potential cost, warned that new standards would prevent displaced residents from moving back, and decried the aesthetic implications.
</p><p>
	“Paradise is an individualistic town,” one person says. “That’s part of the charm and the quirkiness. We don’t need consistency and uniformity.”
</p><p>
	In another scene, a city councilmember asks Paradise Fire Chief John Messina to narrow down the list to just one rule that would make the community more fire resistant. “That five-foot barrier around your house is extremely important,” he replies. “That would be the No. 1 thing out of all of this that I would say would defend your home the best and have the most impact.” Shortly after, the council votes down the measure.
</p><p>
	Michael Wara, who recalled the scene to me over the phone, said a similar thing happened when the fire chief in his community in Mill Valley tried to get the city council to adopt zone zero rules. “The word got out in the community that this crazy fire chief was going to make us rip up our front yards,” he said. When the council convened for a vote, more than a thousand people showed up to oppose it. The council ended up passing it as a voluntary measure.
</p><p>
	To Wara, part of the problem is the language used to communicate these ideas with the public. “Zone zero” and “hardening” conjure a bunker mentality, he said. “I do not want my family to live in a bunker that is hardened to attack. I want my family to live in a home that is welcoming.”
</p><p>
	He also thinks the state can reach a compromise, like allowing succulents and other fire-resistant greenery in zone zero. The rules don’t have to turn these areas into gravel and concrete wastelands to be effective.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

The images feature stone walkways immediately next to homes, followed by raised beds made of metal and concrete containing attractive landscaping. Not quite “quirky” and “charming,” but far from a barren dystopia.</p><h3>Where insurance fits in</h3><p>Despite the delay in implementing zone zero, California has tried to pitch it as part of a strategy to solve the state’s <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/los-angeles-fire-insurance-fair" target="_self"><u>insurance crisis</u></a>. In 2022, Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara <a href="https://www.insurance.ca.gov/01-consumers/200-wrr/Safer-from-Wildfires" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>enacted new rules</u></a> requiring insurance companies to provide discounts to homeowners who do home hardening retrofits and create defensible space.</p><p>“That’s terrific,” Dave Jones, the director of the Climate Risk Initiative at the University of California, Berkeley, and Lara’s predecessor as insurance commissioner, told me. “But you don’t get the discount if they won’t write you the insurance.”</p><p>Jones said the bigger issue is that the models insurance companies use to decide whether or not to write a policy do not account for fire mitigation efforts. A homeowner could take every action on the list for home hardening, create a zone zero, live in a community that’s investing in aggressive fuels reduction, and so on, and insurance companies could still deny them coverage. Last year, Jones wrote a bill that would have required companies to change the models they use to determine coverage to account for mitigation. Several insurance industry trade groups opposed the bill, <a href="https://ains.assembly.ca.gov/system/files/2024-06/sb-1060-becker.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>arguing</u></a> that it was “premature and impossible to implement given the real-world data constraints,” and that it was “inconsistent” with the state’s efforts to “restore a healthy and competitive insurance market.” It didn’t pass.</p><p>If following zone zero guidelines meant having a shot at getting insurance, maybe people would be more open to doing it, Jones argued to me. But as things stand, that’s not the case. “I don’t think the failure is so much in the state developing the standards as it is in the lack of political courage to stand up to the insurance industry and say, hey, look, enough is enough. We’re going to pass a law to require your models to account for this.”</p><p>This past year, the California legislature passed a law giving existing homes three years, instead of just one, to comply with zone zero rules once they are finalized, whenever that is. And if the regulations are finalized this year, it’s possible that some of the rebuilt structures in the Pacific Palisades and Altadena will have to meet them. </p><p>Ultimately, Valachovic sees hope in fire mitigation work. The narrative that climate change is driving these destructive wildfires can make people feel helpless. But there are so many low-cost, simple things people can do to reduce their exposure. “I just feel like we have a moral imperative to share practical, reasonable actions that people can take to make a difference, and to know that with that, the odds improve substantially.”</p>

## US finalizes rules banning Chinese, Russian smart cars

date: 2025-01-14, from: VOA News USA

The White House says it has finalized rules that crack down on Chinese and Russian automobile technology effectively banning all personal smart cars from the two countries from entering the U.S. market.


In a White House fact sheet detailing the decision, the Biden administration Tuesday said that while connected vehicles offer advantages, the involvement of foreign adversaries such as China and Russia in their supply chains presents serious risks granting “malign actors unfettered access to these connected systems and the data they collect.”


“The Department of Commerce has issued a final rule that will prohibit the sale and import of connected vehicle hardware and software systems, as well as completed connected vehicles, from the PRC and Russia,” the fact sheet said.


PRC is the acronym for China’s official name, the People’s Republic of China.


Connected vehicles are smart cars that are designed to be convenient for consumers and provide safety for drivers, passengers, and pedestrians through the use of many connected parts such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular, and satellite connectivity.


"Cars today aren't just steel on wheels; they're computers," said Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo when speaking on the rule.


"This is a targeted approach to ensure we keep PRC- and Russian-manufactured technologies off American roads," said Raimondo.


The new rule is the “culmination of a year-long examination” of potential risks posed by connected vehicles and will “help the United States defend against the PRC’s cyber espionage and intrusion operations, which continue to pose a significant threat to U.S. critical infrastructure and public safety.”


The crackdown on cars follows Washington’s announcement earlier this month that the U.S. consider new rules aimed at addressing risks posed by drones that utilize technology from China and Russia.


The U.S. has repeatedly emphasized the need to balance technological progress with the protection of national security interests.

## The Great ESG Retreat

date: 2025-01-14, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTU3MjQwOS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4NTE2MDkzN30.aWPIwtEcHN9megHdyGfnVDVWPPqMEDYXPQgBm2ozWwQ/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">The <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/20/politics/biden-first-veto/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>first veto</u></a> of Joe Biden’s presidency, in March 2023, came on a bill that would have overturned a Department of Labor rule allowing retirement funds to consider environment, social, and governance factors — commonly known as ESG — when making investment decisions. At the time, it seemed like a good representation of where the issue stood: Though there was a conservative backlash against ESG investing, much of which revolves around whether companies are incorporating climate risks into their planning, the backlash was more bark than bite. ESG not only seemed here to stay, it was gaining in prominence as more investors and Wall Street firms realized they could no longer ignore the effects of climate change on the economic prospects of the companies they were funding.</p><p>Less than two years later, the picture looks rather different — at least politically. There is still <a href="https://www.morningstar.com/sustainable-investing/global-esg-funds-attract-104-billion-q3-2024" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>over $3 trillion</u></a> invested in ESG funds worldwide, the vast majority of it in Europe. But here in the U.S., the backlash has only grown stronger, and with Donald Trump’s election, there has been a Wall Street stampede away from public commitments to assess climate risk as a key component of investment decisions. There’s no way to know how much long-term effect this change will have on emissions, but the reversal in the public stance of the financial sector has been swift and intense. </p><p>Let’s begin with the banks. In the space of a month, the six largest banks in the United States — Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citi, Morgan Stanley, and JPMorgan — all <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/jpmorgan-says-leave-net-zero-banking-alliance-2025-01-07/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pulled out</u></a> of the <a href="https://www.unepfi.org/net-zero-banking/commitment/frequently-asked-questions/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Net-Zero Banking Alliance</u></a>, an international United Nations-sponsored group under which member banks commit to pursuing net-zero carbon emissions from their lending and investments by 2050. </p><p>While Trump’s election may have been the tipping point, it comes after an organized campaign waged at the state level over the past couple of years, as Republican attorneys general have pressured and threatened the finance industry into abandoning its efforts to contribute to the mitigation of climate change. </p><p>In the spring of 2023, 23 Republican AGs <a href="https://attorneygeneral.utah.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-05-15-NZIA-Letter.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>threatened</u></a> the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance (like the NZBA, a UN-sponsored group) with antitrust action, <a href="https://attorneygeneral.utah.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-05-15-NZIA-Letter.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>saying</u></a> it was pursuing “an activist climate agenda.” Companies began <a href="https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2023/04/19/717287.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>leaving</u></a>, and a year later, the group <a href="https://www.unepfi.org/insurance/insurance/projects/net-zero-insurance-alliance/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>disbanded</u></a>. The effort against the banking alliance followed a similar pattern: <a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/files/divisions/public-finance/ABC%20Letter%20Draft%20Net%20Zero%20Alliance%2010.17.23.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Threats</u></a> of legal action from Republican attorneys general, followed by a pullback from the banks. </p><p>Like insurance companies and banks, investment firms are clearly feeling the pressure. BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world, recently <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/blackrock-quits-climate-group-wall-streets-latest-environmental-step-back-2025-01-09/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pulled out</u></a> of the Net-Zero Asset Managers Initiative, a group similar to those for insurers and banks, citing “legal inquiries from various public officials.” That included a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/blackrock-state-street-vanguard-sued-by-republican-states-over-climate-accords-2024-11-27/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>lawsuit</u></a> filed by Texas and 10 other Republican states, alleging that BlackRock and other firms were unfairly harming the fossil fuel industry with their investment decisions. This week, the NZAMI released <a href="https://www.netzeroassetmanagers.org/update-from-the-net-zero-asset-managers-initiative/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a statement</u></a> saying that in response to “different regulatory and client expectations,” it is launching an internal review, and meanwhile “suspending activities to track signatory implementation and reporting” of climate goals.</p><p>Meanwhile, Republicans in Congress have been <a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/media/press-releases/jordan-and-massie-demand-information-over-130-companies-surrounding-their" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>issuing</u></a> reports and press releases condemning the “woke ESG cartel,” which they claim consists of “left-wing activists and major financial institutions that collude to impose radical environmental, social, and governance goals on American companies.” After the election, those Republicans now control both houses of Congress, as well as the White House. </p><p>So it’s a good bet that the pressure on the finance industry from Washington will only increase, especially with a new administration that combines dismissal of climate change with an eagerness to bring corporations to heel. In many cases, key administration positions will be staffed by former employees of the very fossil fuel companies that oppose real climate action, or at least by their allies. One vivid example: Lee Zeldin, Trump’s nominee to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/trumps-pick-to-lead-epa-was-paid-tens-of-thousands-to-write-op-eds-criticizing-climate-policies-and-esg/ar-BB1rk50z" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>revealed</u></a> in disclosure forms that he was paid tens of thousands of dollars to pen op-eds attacking ESG investing. <a href="https://extapps2.oge.gov/201/Presiden.nsf/PAS+Index/B4586F4FD7718EA485258C0F00336FAE/%24FILE/Zeldin%2C%20Lee%20%20final278.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>His forms</u></a> list only the PR firms that paid him, not the clients on whose behalf they did so. </p><p>These pullbacks from climate pledges are clearly motivated by fear, and may even be taken with regret by some of the CEOs making the decisions. If that is the case, however, it is not a universal sentiment. The <em><em>Financial Times</em></em> <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/cf876b19-8c69-498b-95f5-d018618d99ec" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reports</u></a> that “Some Wall Streeters also feel able to embrace making money openly, without nodding to any broader social goals. ‘Most of us don’t have to kiss ass because, like Trump, we love America and capitalism,’ one said.”</p><p>Here’s the kicker: These alliances that are now wavering began with few requirements in order to bring in as many participants as possible; only later would companies have to meet more reporting and emissions goals. But “as accountability mechanisms started to come into play, at the same time we started to see the conservative backlash against it,” Tensie Whelan, founding director of the NYU Stern Center for Sustainable Business, told me. Now, “they’re all running scared.” </p><p>Though some critics charge that ESG is mostly about greenwashing, many financial actors — banks, asset managers, investors — have embraced greener investing because it is both good for the planet and good for business. If a company is exposed to climate risk but fails to account for it in its long-term strategy, that company is probably a bad investment. Investments incorporating sustainability considerations tend to perform as well or better than ordinary investment vehicles — the <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/additional-material/brochure-sp-500-esg-index.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>S&P 500 ESG Index</u></a>, for instance, has outperformed the standard S&P 500. And a <a href="https://hipinvestor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/HIPinvestor-Pensions-Dems-Reps-Indeps-ProESG-AntiESG-YE2022.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>study by HIP Investor</u></a> showed that public pension funds in blue states that incorporated ESG factors have generated higher returns than red-state funds that eschewed them. </p><p>“I would hope and assume that at some point there will be some class-action suits” against states that have turned away from ESG investing, and in so doing cost taxpayers money, Whelan said. <a href="https://news.ballotpedia.org/2024/10/21/republican-states-pass-17-anti-esg-laws-democratic-states-pass-8-pro-esg-in-2024/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>In 2024</u></a>, 17 Republican-run states passed bills restricting ESG investments with state funds, while eight Democratic states passed pro-ESG bills.</p><p>When banks or investment firms abandon climate alliances or pull back from climate goals in other ways, they nearly always put out statements reiterating their commitment to reducing emissions. While those might be sincere, the most important message is that the threats and pressure are effective. And that’s what has become so clear: Conservatives are energized and emboldened to roll back corporate efforts to address climate change, and are using every tool they have — legislation, litigation, threats, public pressure campaigns — to destroy those initiatives.</p><p>Nevertheless, there is plenty of room for pressure from the other side. Whelan notes that blue states “are very adamant about having key sustainability criteria” in their investments, and as younger generations accumulate more wealth, they are more likely to demand sustainability where they put their money. As for Wall Street responding to political pressure by backing away from its climate goals, “this retrenchment is unfortunate,” Whelan told me, but “I do think it’s temporary, and I think they know that. Because they’re not stupid.”</p>

## US House Speaker orders Capitol flags raised to full height for Trump inauguration

date: 2025-01-14, from: VOA News USA

U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson on Tuesday ordered that flags at the Capitol be raised to their full height on Inauguration Day, pausing a 30-day flag-lowering order following the death of former President Jimmy Carter.


The Republican leader's decision means that President-elect Donald Trump will not take the oath of office for his second term under a half-staff flag, a prospect that he had previously complained about.


It mirrors actions taken in recent days by some Republican governors who have announced that flags in their states would be raised on Inauguration Day to mark Trump's second term.


Alabama Governor Kay Ivey and Tennessee Governor Bill Lee did so on Tuesday, noting in social media posts that U.S. flags across their states would be relowered on Jan. 21 in honor of Carter. Texas Governor Greg Abbott issued a similar notice on Monday.


The 30-day flag-lowering period, set into motion with President Joe Biden's order, affects flags at federal government buildings and their grounds, as well as at U.S. embassies and other facilities abroad, including military installations and vessels. It runs through Jan. 28, which encompasses Trump's inauguration and first week in office. In line with Biden's order, governors throughout the country issued their own orders to govern flags in their respective states.


The incoming president has expressed consternation that flags would still be lowered when he takes the oath, and it's possible that he could order the overall reversal of Biden's decision once he's installed as president on Jan. 20.


"Democrats are all 'giddy'" about the notion that flags will be lowered on Inauguration Day, Trump wrote Jan. 3 on social media.


"Nobody wants to see this," Trump wrote. He added that "no American can be happy about it. Let's see how it plays out. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"


Trump has already acted over the flags that he can control: at his home in Florida. In the days following Carter's burial, a large U.S. flag at Trump's private Mar-a-Lago club was observed flying at its full height, despite an order from Florida Governor Ron DeSantis that mirrors Biden's.




As of Tuesday, DeSantis had not made alterations to the flag order in his own state.


The U.S. flag code lays out parameters for lowering the U.S. flag to half-staff, including a 30-day period for current or former presidents to cover flags at federal government buildings and their grounds, as well as at U.S. embassies and other facilities abroad, including military installations and vessels.

## Despite international concerns, doctors say China flu-like virus is no COVID-19

date: 2025-01-14, from: VOA News USA

Reports of rising cases of a flu-like illness in China, where COVID-19 was first detected five years ago, sparked international concerns about the potential for another worldwide pandemic.

But medical experts say the human metapneumovirus, known as HMPV, is no COVID-19.

“That’s a routine virus that commonly causes upper respiratory tract infections, such as bronchitis that might cause cough and sinuses,” says Dr. Paul Auwaerter, clinical director of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine’s division of infectious diseases. “I don't feel we should be especially worried about it. It is not nearly as serious as influenza or COVID disease.”

HMPV is a common virus that has been around at least since 2001. Children under five, particularly infants, and adults over 65 — especially those with health problems — can sometimes become seriously ill from HMPV. However, for most other people, the symptoms are generally mild.

“Almost everyone has been infected with this virus by the age of five,” Auwaerter says. “HMPV has been here for, you know, a long time [and] has infected millions of people that already have immunity. It's not as though this is a brand-new virus that might cause devastating problems.”

On Sunday, China said cases of HMPV had declined among residents in its northern provinces, where the respiratory infections were rising. Chinese health officials say the number of patients seeking medical help remains lower compared to the same period last year. Still, some health experts are calling for more transparency in order to reduce the spread of rumors and misunderstandings.

"International scholars are calling on China to disclose pathogen information and conduct genetic research to confirm that it is not a new virus. Even if it is an old virus, it could still be a new variant," Dr. Ho Mei-Shang, a research fellow emeritus at the Institute of Biomedical Sciences in Taipei, told VOA’s Mandarin Service.

Ho said China's COVID-19 prevention measures during the pandemic curbed the spread of diseases, which led to a decline in herd immunity, potentially causing the current surge in cases over a short time period.

Auwaerter agrees.

“They stayed home, refrained from work, wore masks,” he says. “So, the usual cycles of acquiring an infection, for example, during the respiratory season of winter, people didn't get infected. So, their specific immunity, they weren't boosted, and so there was a larger population that might be more susceptible.”

There is no real treatment or vaccine for HMPV. Doctors say any patients who have trouble breathing should seek medical help.

Chan-Long Ku of VOA's Mandarin Service contributed to this report.

## Trump says he will create an 'External Revenue Service' agency to collect tariff income

date: 2025-01-14, from: VOA News USA

Washington — President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday announced plans to create a new agency called the External Revenue Service to collect tariffs and other revenues from foreign nations.


"We will begin charging those that make money off of us with Trade, and they will start paying," Trump said Tuesday on his social media site, Truth Social. He compared his planned creation to the Internal Revenue Service, which is the nation's domestic tax collector.


The creation of a new agency requires an act of Congress, and Republicans hold the majority of both the House and the Senate.


Trump, who has vowed to shrink the size of government, would be creating a new agency to perform functions already handled by existing agencies, including the Commerce Department and the Customs and Border Patrol, which collect duties and revenues from other nations.


The president-elect has tapped two business titans to lead his Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, a nongovernmental task force assigned to find ways to fire federal workers, cut programs and slash federal regulations, all part of what he calls his "Save America" agenda for a second term in the White House.


Billionaire Elon Musk and fellow entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy are leading the DOGE's ambitious efforts to reduce the size and scope of the federal government.


Tariffs, with the threat of a potential 25% levy on all goods from allies like Canada and Mexico and 60% on goods from China, have become a benchmark of Trump's economic agenda as he heads into his second term.


Economists have said the cost of the tariffs will be passed on to consumers, and are generally skeptical of them, considering them a mostly inefficient way for governments to raise money and promote prosperity.


Democratic lawmakers were quick to criticize the External Revenue Service plan.


"No amount of silly rebranding will hide the fact that Trump is planning a multi-trillion-dollar tax hike on American families and small businesses to pay for another round of tax handouts to the rich," Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said in a statement.

## Trump Cabinet choice faces tough first day of questions on Capitol Hill

date: 2025-01-14, from: VOA News USA

Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump's choice to lead the U.S. Department of Defense, told U.S. lawmakers Tuesday he would bring back accountability and "a warrior ethos" to the nation's military.


In the first confirmation hearing in the U.S. Senate for Trump's Cabinet secretary picks, Hegseth faced criticism from Senate Democrats over his statements about women and transgender people serving in the military, as well as allegations of sexual assault, drunkenness and financial mismanagement of two nonprofits serving U.S. veterans that he led.




"This nomination is unconventional. The nominee is unconventional, just like that New York developer who rode down the escalator in 2015 to announce his candidacy for president," Senate Armed Services Chairman Roger Wicker, a Republican, said Tuesday.


"Mr. Hegseth will bring energy and fresh ideas to shake up the bureaucracy. He will focus relentlessly on the war fighter and the military's core missions, deterring wars and winning the ones we must fight," Wicker continued.


Hegseth, a former television host at the conservative Fox News channel, also served as an officer in the Army National Guard in Iraq, Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay and is the author of several books.




"I don't have a similar biography to defense secretaries of the last 30 years," Hegseth told senators in his opening statement. "But as President Trump also told me, we've repeatedly placed people atop the Pentagon with the supposed right credentials, whether they are retired generals, academics or defense contractor executives. And where has it gotten us?"


Hegseth said his priorities, if he is confirmed as secretary of defense, would focus on the threat posed by China and defense of the homeland while reorienting the United States away from entanglements in the Middle East. He also pledged to restore morale and end diversity initiatives that he sees as harmful to establishing a merit-based military.


"Getting anything that doesn't contribute to our democracy out of how decisions are made inside the Pentagon," Hegseth said of the ways he sees his potential role. "What gender you are, what race you are, your views on climate change, your conscience and your faith should have no bearing on whether you get promoted, or whether you're selected to go to West Point, or where you go to school. Only thing that should matter is how capable are you at your job. How excellent are you at your job."


If confirmed, Hegseth would be the first secretary of defense to have served as a junior officer on the front lines and the first secretary from the generation that fought in post-9/11 wars.




Senate Democrats said Hegseth's experience running two nonprofits benefiting military veterans with fewer than 100 employees was not sufficient experience.


"We're hiring you to be the CEO of one of the most complex, largest organizations in the world. We're the board of directors here. I don't know of any corporate board of directors that would hire a CEO, that said, you know, I supervised 100 people before," said Democratic Senator Gary Peters.


The Department of Defense has more than 3 million service members and a budget of $857 billion.


Senator Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the committee, said that the FBI background investigation into Hegseth was “insufficient” and that there are still FBI obligations to talk to people.”


"You lack the character and composure and competence to hold the position of defense," Reed said, noting that he has voted for all nine previous nominees for secretary of defense, including nominees during Trump's first term.


All Cabinet nominees undergo a background check and an ethics review.


Hegseth faces allegations of financial mismanagement of the two nonprofits where he served as executive director: Vets for Freedom and Concerned Veterans for America.


After a 2009 audit of Vets for Freedom, Hegseth acknowledged the organization was $500,000 in debt, and he was demoted. During his time at Concerned Veterans for America, Hegseth faced whistleblower allegations of personal misconduct and financial mismanagement, which resulted in an investigation and a report.


Hegseth said the allegations were part of a coordinated smear campaign by left-wing media and largely came from anonymous sources.


"We undertook this responsibility with obligation to the troops to do right by them, for our war fighters. And what became very evident to us from the beginning, there was a coordinated smear campaign orchestrated in the media against us that was clear from moment one. And what we knew is, it wasn't about me. Most of it was about President Donald Trump, who's had to endure the very same thing for much longer amounts of time, and he endured it — to his credit — in incredibly strong ways," Hegseth said Tuesday.


Hegseth has also faced criticism for past remarks about diversity in the U.S. military.




Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren said Hegseth had done "a very big about-face in a short period of time" since Trump chose him to serve as secretary of defense.


"For 12 years, you were quite open about your views, and your views were consistently the same: Women are inferior soldiers, sailors, marines, airmen and guardians. Then on Nov. 9, 2024, just 32 days after your last public comments saying that women absolutely should not be in combat, you declare that 'some of our greatest warriors are women,'" Warren said on Tuesday.


Five women who served in combat wrote letters of support in favor of Hegseth's nomination.


"These women represent diverse viewpoints, from a retired colonel with over 25 years of service to an active-duty Navy Surface Warfare commander to a senior for Mr. Hegseth, and comment on his focus on merit war-fighting readiness, military training status and the warrior ethos," Wicker said.


Hegseth pledged that women would have access to ground combat roles during his tenure as secretary of defense.


"Given the standards remain high, and we'll have a review to ensure standards have not been eroded in any one of these cases," he said.


Hegseth also faces allegations of sexual assault and public drunkenness during his time at Fox News.


Cabinet nominees must receive a majority of votes to be confirmed. The U.S. Senate is composed of 53 Republicans, 45 Democrats and two independents.

## World Economic Forum says Trump to take part virtually in Davos meeting, days after inauguration

date: 2025-01-14, from: VOA News USA

GENEVA — U.S. President Donald Trump will take part virtually in the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos just days after his inauguration, the forum president said Tuesday. 


Borge Brende, a former Norwegian foreign minister who heads the Geneva-based organization, noted that Trump had twice attended the elite gathering of business, government and other leaders in person during his first term. 


"On Thursday afternoon, he will join us digitally, online, live in a dialogue with our participants," Brende told reporters Tuesday as he presented the five-day program that will start Monday — the day of Trump's inauguration. 


"We think that will be a very special moment," he added, notably to help learn the administration's "policy priorities." 


Brende said he didn't know whether Elon Musk, the multibillionaire who is poised to co-lead Trump's new Department of Government Efficiency, would attend, but said the forum expects "additional, high-level representation" from the administration once confirmation processes for Trump's nominees get underway in the U.S. Senate as early as Monday. 


Forum organizers say a record of around 900 business leaders, including from important emerging markets, will take part in the annual meeting this year, which is expected to draw nearly 3,000 participants from over 130 countries. 


With climate change, war, global tensions, economic uncertainty and other issues in mind, Brende acknowledged that the 55th annual meeting of the forum will take place "against the most complicated geopolitical backdrop in generations." 


"But still in that fragmented and partly polarized world, there are still areas where we can collaborate and ... we have big opportunities and responsibilities to find those areas where there is a possibility to improve the state of the world," he said. The theme of this year's edition is "Collaboration for the Intelligent Age" — a nod to the growing importance of technology in the world. 


The WEF has long been derided as a gathering of world elites who plot the future at a cushy, snow-bound powwow in the Swiss Alps. Critics often argue the developing world gets less attention than global powers and big business in the West or Gulf states. 


Forum managing director Mirek Dusek insisted that the number of businesses from developing countries in the "Global South" was growing, and the attendance of their leaders was "on parity" with the participation of leaders in the developed world. 


Ursula Von Der Leyen, president of the European Union's executive commission, plans to attend the opening day of meetings on Tuesday, after an introductory gala the night before. Other top envoys include President Javier Milei of Argentina, President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa, and Chinese Vice-Premier Ding Xuexiang. 


The vast array of topics will include the future of Syria — its new foreign minister is expected to attend — after the fall of President Bashar al-Assad last month; the fight against climate change; the threats and promise of artificial intelligence; global trade and economic growth; and wars in places like Ukraine, Sudan and beyond. 


"We are ready to roll up our sleeves to make the best out of a situation where we are faced with many, many challenges," Brende said.

## Biden issues executive order for building AI data centers on federal land

date: 2025-01-14, from: VOA News USA

— U.S. President Joe Biden issued an executive order Tuesday directing the development of artificial intelligence data centers on six federal land sites, with a special focus on powering them with clean energy and upholding high labor standards. 


Biden said in a statement that the United States is the world leader in AI, but cannot take that lead for granted. 


“We will not let America be out-built when it comes to the technology that will define the future, nor should we sacrifice critical environmental standards and our shared efforts to protect clean air and clean water,” Biden said. 


The order calls for the Department of Defense and Department of Energy to each identify three suitable sites where private companies will lease the land, pay for the construction and operation of the data centers and ensure the supply of enough clean energy to fully power the sites. 


The developers will also have to buy “an appropriate share” of semiconductors produced in the United States to help ensure there is a “robust domestic semiconductor supply chain,” the White House said. 


In addition to identifying the sites, the federal government will also commit under the order to expedite the permitting process for the data center construction. 


Senior administration officials, in a phone call with journalists previewing the order, highlighted the national security need for the United States to have its own powerful AI infrastructure, both to protect it for its own use but also to prevent adversaries such as China from possessing those capabilities. 


“From the national security standpoint, it's really critical to find a pathway for building the data centers and power infrastructure to support frontier AI operations here in the United States to ensure that the most powerful AI models continue to be trained and stored securely here in the United States,” an official said. 


A senior administration official cited the priority of making sure the AI industry had an anchor in the United States to avoid repeating the history of other technologies that moved offshore to areas with lower labor and environmental standards as well. 


AI chip restrictions 


Tuesday’s order comes a day after the Biden administration announced new restrictions on the export of the most advanced artificial intelligence chips and proprietary parameters used to govern the interactions of users with AI systems.    


The rule, which will undergo a 120-day period for public comments, comes in response to what administration officials described as a need to protect national security while also clarifying the rules under which companies in trusted partner countries could access the emerging technology in order to promote innovation.   


“Over the coming years, AI will become really ubiquitous in every business application in every industry around the world, with enormous potential for enhanced productivity and societal, health care and economic benefits,” Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told reporters. “That being said, as AI becomes more powerful, the risks to our national security become even more intense.”   


A senior administration official said the new rule will not include any restrictions on chip sales to Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, the United Kingdom or the United States.   


The rules build on 2023 curbs limiting the export of certain AI chips to China, a strategic competitor in the production of advanced semiconductors. Beijing attacked the new U.S. AI edict as a "flagrant violation" of international trade rules.  


China’s Ministry of Commerce said the Biden administration announcement "is another example of the generalization of the concept of national security and the abuse of export control, and a flagrant violation of international multilateral economic and trade rules."  


Beijing said it would "take necessary measures to firmly safeguard its legitimate rights and interests." 


Countries that are under U.S. arms embargoes are already subject to export restrictions on advanced AI chips, but a senior administration official said they will now be under restrictions for the transfer of the most powerful closed weight AI models.    


The weights in an AI model determine how it processes the inputs from a user and determines what to provide the user as a response, according to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration. In a closed weight system, those parameters are secret, unlike with an open weight system in which users could see the settings the model is using to make its decisions.    


Most countries — those not included in the closed partner or arms embargo lists — will not face licensing requirements for obtaining the equivalent of 1,700 of the most advanced AI chips currently available, nor for any less advanced chips.   


Companies in the United States and allied countries will not face restrictions in using the most powerful closed weight AI systems, provided they are stored under adequate security, a senior administration official said.

## Washington braces for Trump inauguration with fortress-like fencing, extra police

date: 2025-01-14, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — With 48 km of tall black temporary fencing, 25,000 law enforcement officers and security checkpoints set up to process hundreds of thousands of spectators, Washington is braced for President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration next week.


The Monday swearing-in on the steps of the U.S. Capitol and parade to the White House will follow a weekend featuring protests by Trump's opponents and parties and rallies by the Republican's supporters.


The inauguration follows a campaign marked by two attempts on Trump's life — including one from a would-be assassin who nicked his ear with a bullet — and a pair of New Year's Day attacks on ordinary Americans. In one, 14 people were killed and dozens injured when a U.S. Army veteran rammed a truck into a crowd of New Year's Eve revelers in New Orleans. The same day, an active-duty U.S. Army soldier detonated a Tesla Cybertruck outside a Trump-branded hotel in Las Vegas, killing himself.




"We are in a higher-threat environment," said U.S. Secret Service Special Agent in Charge Matt McCool at a Monday press briefing.


The inauguration itself, when Trump formally takes the oath of office with members of Congress, the Supreme Court, his incoming administration and tens of thousands of others looking on, will take place on the Capitol steps, facing the Washington Monument.


That is the same spot where, on Jan. 6, 2021, thousands of Trump supporters smashed windows, fought with police and sent lawmakers running for their lives in an attempt to overturn his 2020 election loss to Democratic President Joe Biden.


Trump's 2024 election rival, Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, conceded her defeat in the Nov. 5 contest, unlike Trump who continues to falsely maintain that his loss was the result of fraud.


Fear of lone wolf 


Security officials said they were not aware of any specific, coordinated threats to the inauguration. What they are worried about is lone wolves, such as the New Orleans attacker, or two separate incidents last week. In one, a man was arrested for trying to bring a machete into the Capitol. In the other, a man was arrested for trying to ignite a fire near the Capitol, according to U.S. Capitol Police.




"That threat of the lone actor remains the biggest justification for us being at this heightened state of alert throughout the next week," U.S. Capitol Police Chief Thomas Manger told the security briefing.


The FBI and Department of Homeland Security on Monday warned police nationwide of the risk of copycat attacks similar to the New Orleans incident.


A large chunk of downtown Washington — stretching about 3 km from the White House to the Capitol — will be closed to vehicular traffic, with entry points blocked with concrete barriers, garbage trucks and other heavy items.


The 48 km of 2-meters-tall black fencing, designed to be unclimbable, will be the longest ever erected in Washington, officials said. Some 7,800 National Guard troops and 4,000 officers brought in from other police departments around the country will reinforce security.


While some residents of the city, where 90% of voters cast ballots for Harris over Trump, were readying to leave for the holiday weekend or hunker down at home to avoid the gridlock, tens of thousands of people were expected to descend upon the city for celebrations and protests.


About 70% of Washington's 34,500 hotel rooms were booked for the night of the inauguration and the night before as of last week, according to data from Smith Travel Research and shared with Reuters by Destination DC, Washington’s official tourism organization. Hotel occupancy was at about 95% for Trump's 2017 inauguration, and about 78% for former President Barack Obama’s second inauguration in 2013.


Marches and rallies 


Trump's 2017 inauguration was marked by massive protests and counter-protests. His former spokesman, Sean Spicer, famously began his tenure by claiming — contrary to photographic evidence — that the crowd on the grassy National Mall was "the largest audience ever to witness an inauguration — period."




The Women's March the following day drew hundreds of thousands of people onto the streets of Washington — and even more in pop-up solidarity events that took place around the country.


A far smaller crowd of 25,000 people is expected to take part in the anti-Trump People's March on DC on Saturday, Metropolitan Police Chief Pamela Smith said on Monday.


Thousands are expected to show up for nearly a dozen other protests or rallies that local officials have permitted between Saturday and Monday, including a Trump rally at the 20,000-seat Capital One Arena on Sunday.


Juliette Kayyem, a professor at Harvard Kennedy School who served as a homeland security official during the Obama administration, said officials appeared to follow standard practice in planning for all possibilities.


"What you're planning for is a worst-case scenario, but my suspicion is you're not going to get it, which is good," Kayyem said. "In terms of planning, it's always easier to ratchet down than ratchet up."

## 153 winners of Nobel and World Food prizes seek new ways to grow food

date: 2025-01-14, from: VOA News USA

DES MOINES, Iowa — More than 150 recipients of the Nobel and World Food prizes released an open letter Tuesday calling for a dramatic increase in research and a commitment to new food distribution efforts with a goal of producing more crops and avoiding a global hunger crisis in coming decades.


The letter notes that an estimated 700 million people now are “food insecure and desperately poor” but that without a “moonshot” effort to grow more and different kinds of food, far more people will be in dire need of food because of climate change and population growth.


“As difficult and as uncomfortable as it might be to imagine, humanity is headed towards an even more food insecure, unstable world by mid-century than exists today, worsened by a vicious cycle of conflict and food insecurity,” states the letter, signed by 153 recipients of the two prizes. “Climate change is projected to decrease the productivity of most major staples when substantial increases are needed to feed a world which will add another 1.5 billion people to its population by 2050.”


Corn production in Africa is expected to decline and much of the world could see more soil degradation and water shortages, the letter says.


“We are not on track to meet future food needs. Not even close,” it adds.


The letter grew from a meeting of food accessibility experts last fall. Despite the potential gloom, it holds out hope for an optimistic vision of the future if people take needed actions. The letter says that a dramatic increase in research funding coupled with more effective ways to share information and distribute food could prevent a hunger crisis.


Brian Schmidt, who won the Nobel Prize in physics in 2011, said the need to dramatically increase food production in the coming decades is a huge challenge. He calls it a “destination with destiny,” but one that can be achieved with proper funding to enhance existing knowledge as well as global leadership.


“It is an imminently solvable problem. It is a problem that will affect billions of people in 25 years. It is a problem that to solve it, there are no losers, only winners,” Schmidt said in an interview. “All we have to do is do it.”


Schmidt said he hopes governments in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere can commit to solving the problem, but he thinks private groups like the Gates Foundation may need to take the lead in funding initial steps that will draw attention and prompt action by politicians.


The letter calls for “transformational efforts” such as enhancing photosynthesis in essential crops such as wheat and rice, developing crops that are not as reliant on chemical fertilizers and lengthening the shelf life of fruits and vegetables.


Cynthia Rosenzweig, a climate research scientist at NASA who won the World Food Prize in 2022, said in an interview that researchers are already making progress toward breakthroughs, but their work needs to be turbocharged with more funding and emphasis from world leaders.


“It's not that we have to dream up new solutions,” Rosenzweig said. “The solutions are very much being tested but in order to actually take them from the lab out into the agriculture regions of the world, we really do need the moonshot approach.”


The term moonshot refers to an unprecedented effort, stemming from President John F. Kennedy's call in 1962 for Americans to rocket to the Moon. Rosenzweig, noting she works for NASA, said meeting the food needs of a growing population will take the kind of commitment the U.S. made in achieving Kennedy's goal of reaching the Moon.


“Look at how the scientists had to come together. The engineers had to be part of it. The funding had to come together as well as the general public,” she said. “That base of support has to be there as well.”

## US special counsel report says prosecutors had enough evidence to convict Trump in 2020 election case

date: 2025-01-14, from: VOA News USA

In a report to Congress released early Tuesday, special counsel Jack Smith said his office had sufficient evidence to “obtain and sustain” a trial conviction of President-elect Donald Trump for efforts to overturn Trump’s loss to President Joe Biden in the 2020 election.


Smith said Trump “resorted to a series of criminal efforts to retain power” after it became clear that he had lost and that legal ways to challenge the results had failed.


“This included attempts to induce state officials to ignore true vote counts; to manufacture fraudulent slates of presidential electors in seven states that he had lost; to force Justice Department officials and his own Vice President, Michael R. Pence, to act in contravention of their oaths and to instead advance Mr. Trump's personal interests; and, on January 6 , 2021, to direct an angry mob to the United States Capitol to obstruct the congressional certification of the presidential election and then leverage rioters,” Smith said in his report.


Smith said Trump acted both in his private capacity as an election candidate, as well as with the help of multiple co-conspirators, and that Trump tried to use “the power and authority of the United States Government in furtherance of his scheme.”


The report further says that Trump’s false claims, such as votes being cast by large numbers of dead people or ineligible voters, or that voting machines had changed votes for Trump into votes for Biden, were “demonstrably and, in many cases, obviously false.”


Trump has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and attacked the special counsel’s work as politically motivated.


He responded to the report’s release early Tuesday with a post on his Truth Social platform calling Smith “a lamebrain prosecutor.”


“Deranged Jack Smith was unable to successfully prosecute the Political Opponent of his ‘boss,’ Crooked Joe Biden, so he ends up writing yet another ‘Report’ based on information that the Unselect Committee of Political Hacks and Thugs ILLEGALLY DESTROYED AND DELETED, because it showed how totally innocent I was, and how completely guilty Nancy Pelosi, and others, were,” Trump said.


Trump is set to be inaugurated for a new term next week after defeating Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election. During the 2024 campaign, Trump denied he lost the 2020 vote, including in a September debate with Harris. 


Tuesday’s report release came a day after U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon cleared the Justice Department to make public the portion of Smith’s report that dealt with Trump’s efforts to cling to power.


Judge Cannon, who was appointed by Trump, had earlier blocked the release of Smith’s full report, which also includes an unreleased section about accusations that Trump illegally retained classified documents after he left office.


Smith sought to prosecute Trump on both matters, while Trump denied wrongdoing.


Judge Cannon dismissed the classified documents case in July, ruling that Smith was illegally appointed.


The Supreme Court also ruled in July that presidents have broad immunity from prosecution for official acts, which blunted Smith’s efforts in the election interference case.


After Trump defeated Harris, the Justice Department dropped both cases against Trump, citing longstanding policy against prosecuting a sitting U.S. leader.

## Release of US special counsel’s report could bring new insight into Trump’s 2020 efforts to cling to power

date: 2025-01-14, from: VOA News USA

The public could learn as early as Tuesday new details about U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss to President Joe Biden.


A federal judge has cleared the U.S. Department of Justice to release special counsel Jack Smith’s report about Trump’s efforts to cling to power as he falsely claimed he won the election and a mob of his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol.


U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, who was appointed by Trump, had earlier blocked the release of Smith’s full report, which also includes a section about accusations that Trump illegally retained classified documents after he left office.


Judge Cannon on Monday ruled the Justice Department can release the election interference portion, but not the classified documents section.


Smith sought to prosecute Trump on both matters, while Trump denied wrongdoing.


Judge Cannon dismissed the classified documents case in July, ruling that Smith was illegally appointed.


The Supreme Court also ruled in July that presidents have broad immunity from prosecution for official acts, which blunted Smith’s efforts in the election interference case.

## California winds increase, posing new wildfire threats

date: 2025-01-14, from: VOA News USA

Winds increased in Southern California Tuesday morning, posing new challenges for firefighters trying to extinguish raging, out-of-control blazes in Los Angeles that have killed at least 24 people and left at least another 24 missing.


The National Weather Service posted an exceptionally rare red flag warning for “particularly dangerous” weather that could lead to “explosive fire growth.”


Forecasters said wind gusts in Los Angeles and Ventura counties could hit about 70 to 110 kilometers an hour, with the fires also boosted by low humidity. The same conditions are expected to continue into Wednesday.  


The winds could strengthen parts of the two major blazes that are still burning in Los Angeles County, undermining the incremental gains that firefighters have made in controlling the fires or igniting new ones.


Authorities said one of the blazes, the Palisades fire, was larger than 9,300 hectares but only 17% contained as of early Tuesday, while the Eaton fire, containing more than 5,600 hectares, was 35% contained.




More than 100,000 people have been forced from their homes and whole neighborhoods flattened, much like the war zones American television viewers have become accustomed to seeing in Ukraine and Gaza.


Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass told reporters she took an aerial tour of the affected areas on Monday with Fire Chief Kristin Crowley, saying, “The massive, massive destruction is unimaginable until you actually see it.”


Anish Mahajan, a Los Angeles County public health official, told residents to wear N95 or P100 masks if they see high winds dispersing ash. “Ash is not just dirt,” Mahajan said. “It is hazardous fine dust.”


One concern is that electrical infrastructure could spark new fires, as has happened in California wildfires in the past. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power said Monday night that it could shut off power for customers in areas with high fire risk as a precautionary measure. Another utility, Southern California Edison, said it had already shut off power to more than 60,000 customers.


Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said Monday that firefighters were “absolutely better prepared” than when a series of wildfires rapidly emerged last week, but that the wind gusts could force authorities to ground aircraft critical to the firefighting effort.




Such restrictions were in place for part of last week as four major fires burned. Together, those blazes scorched more than 160 square kilometers.


Firefighters have brought one fire fully under control, while another north of Los Angeles was 97% contained.


President Joe Biden on Monday pledged additional federal support and said during a briefing at the White House, “We’re going to keep doing everything possible to help you get through this.”


“It was a heartbreaking weekend for a lot of people in Los Angeles,” Biden said. “Ash was raining down like snow; homes burned to the ground. Thousands of those homes are gone. And we learned we lost more of our fellow Americans. So, let’s say again to the people of Los Angeles, we’re with you.”


The president also praised the work of emergency responders.


“Los Angeles is the City of Angels, and you’re now the angels,” Biden said. “You’re the angels literally saving people’s lives, and we owe you.”




Biden said the federal government was providing aid to help with overtime pay for firefighters, debris removal and temporary shelters. He said the region will need tens of billions of dollars to recover and called on Congress to “step up” and provide funding.


Some Republican leaders in Congress have suggested federal aid be given only with conditions, as they criticized Democratic California leaders for what they allege is mismanaging water and forest resources.


California Governor Gavin Newsom has said in recent days that the state has increased its firefighter force and forest management efforts since he took office in 2019.


On Monday, a lawsuit filed against Southern California Edison claims the utility’s equipment sparked the deadly Eaton Fire that began January 7.


Edison acknowledged that fire agencies are investigating whether its equipment may have started a smaller fire in the area that also occurred that day.


Authorities have not yet determined an official cause for the fire.


The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power also was sued on Monday. The suit claims that the utility failed to properly manage water supplies critical to fighting the Palisades Fire, which has killed at least eight people and destroyed thousands of structures, according to the court filing.


Some information in this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.

## Bezos' Blue Origin calls off New Glenn launch again, eyes Thursday

date: 2025-01-14, from: VOA News USA

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — Jeff Bezos' rocket company Blue Origin moved the launch of its New Glenn rocket from Tuesday to Jan. 16, further pushing back its inaugural attempt to reach orbit and compete with SpaceX in the satellite launch market.


The company called off its first scheduled launch on Monday after a technical issue was encountered in the lead-up to its takeoff.


The three-hour launch window opens at 1 a.m. EST (0600 GMT) on Thursday, Blue Origin said in a post on X.


The development of New Glenn has spanned three Blue Origin CEOs and faced numerous delays as Elon Musk's SpaceX grew into an industry juggernaut with its reusable Falcon 9, the world's most active rocket.


New Glenn is more than twice as powerful as a Falcon 9 rocket and has dozens of customer launch contracts collectively worth billions of dollars lined up.


The rocket would seek to land New Glenn's first stage booster on a sea-fairing barge in the Atlantic Ocean 10 minutes after liftoff, while the rocket's second stage continues toward orbit.


"The thing we're most nervous about is the booster landing," Bezos, who founded Blue Origin in 2000, told Reuters in a pre-launch interview on Sunday.


"Clearly on a first flight you could have an anomaly at any mission phase, so anything could happen."

## Supreme Court rejects Utah's push to wrest control of public land from the federal government

date: 2025-01-14, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Monday turned back a push by the state of Utah to wrest control of vast areas of public land from the federal government, marking a small victory for land conservation advocates who worry that similar efforts may escalate in a Republican-controlled Washington.


The high court refused to let the GOP-controlled state file a lawsuit seeking to bring the land and its resources under state control. The decision came in a brief order in which the court did not explain its reasoning, as is typical. It marks the latest roadblock for states in a running feud with the U.S. government over who should control huge swaths of the West and the enormous oil and gas, timber, and other resources they contain.


Utah's top state leaders said they have not ruled out taking their lawsuit to a lower court.


In the Western state known for its rugged mountains popular with skiers and red-rock vistas that draw throngs of tourists, federal agencies control almost 70% of the land. Utah argues that local control would be more responsive and allow the state access to revenue from taxes and development projects.


The complaint sought control of about half of federal land, which still amounts to an area nearly as large as South Carolina. The parcels are used for things like energy production, grazing, mining and recreation. Utah's world-famous national parks and national monuments would have stayed in federal hands.


Monday's decision by the high court comes as the newly Republican-controlled Congress adopted a rules package that includes language allowing lawmakers to more easily transfer or sell off public lands managed by federal agencies. The rules consider public lands to have no monetary value, meaning lawmakers will no longer need to account for lost revenue if they decide to give parcels to states or extractive industries.


While conservationists applauded the court's rejection of what they called a land-grab lawsuit, many remained worried that the efforts will continue.


Public lands under state control could be vulnerable to privatization, degradation and oil drilling, said Steve Bloch, legal director for the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance.


"If successful, Utah's lawsuit would result in the sale of millions of acres of public lands in red-rock country to the highest bidder, an end to America's system of federal public lands and the dismantling of the American West as we know it," Bloch said.


Utah's Republican Sens. Mike Lee and John Curtis criticized the court's decision and promised legislative action. Curtis, who campaigned on being a climate-conscious Republican, said the people of Utah should be entrusted to manage the land they have lived on for generations.


"Building roads, moving cattle and cleaning up campgrounds all require navigating a behemothic bureaucracy that's stacked up against the average Utahn," Curtis said.


In a joint statement with Utah's Republican legislative leaders and attorney general, Gov. Spencer Cox said he was disappointed in the court's decision to turn away the lawsuit.


"Utah remains able and willing to challenge any BLM land management decisions that harm Utah," state leaders said. "We are also heartened to know the incoming administration shares our commitments to the principle of 'multiple use' for these federal lands and is committed to working with us to improve land management."


While lawsuits typically start in federal district courts and eventually work their way up to the U.S. Supreme Court, disputes involving states can start at the nation's highest court if the justices agree to hear them.


Utah leaders noted that the high court did not comment on the merits of their arguments or prevent them from filing the lawsuit in a federal district court. Conservation groups say they'll remain ready to challenge any future lawsuits.


"This lawsuit is an assault on the country's long-standing and successful history of safeguarding valuable and vulnerable landscapes in trust for all Americans," said Chris Hill, who leads the Conservation Lands Foundation. "And while the Supreme Court's decision to not hear the case is a reprieve, we fully expect this small group of anti-public lands politicians to continue to waste taxpayer dollars and shop their bad ideas."


The federal Bureau of Land Management declined to comment.

## The rise of private firefighting

## US agencies warn of potential New Orleans copycat attack

date: 2025-01-14, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security on Monday warned of a potential public safety threat from violent extremists who might try to copy the New Year's Day attack in New Orleans that killed 14 people.


The warning comes a week before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration.


"The FBI and DHS are concerned about possible copycat or retaliatory attacks due to the persistent appeal of vehicle ramming as a tactic for aspiring violent extremist attackers," the agencies said in a statement.


Early on New Year's Day, more than a dozen people were killed and a dozen others injured when a man rammed a rented pickup truck into a crowd of revelers along Bourbon Street in New Orleans.


The man who carried out the attack was a U.S. Army veteran who had pledged allegiance to Islamic State and appeared to have made recordings condemning music, drugs and alcohol.


The agencies said such attacks, inspired by foreign "terrorist" organizations, have been carried out in the U.S. and abroad using rented, stolen and personally owned vehicles.


Attackers could also attempt to use improvised explosive devices to supplement a vehicle attack, they said.


The agencies said past targets have included pedestrians, law enforcement or military members, and crowded public venues that are accessible from roadways.


"We ask that the public remain vigilant regarding possible copycat or retaliatory attacks and report any suspicious activity to law enforcement," they said.

## Trump’s Offshore Wind Ban Is Coming, Congressman Says

date: 2025-01-14, from: Heatmap News

	President-elect Donald Trump’s team is drafting an executive order to “halt offshore wind turbine activities” along the East Coast, working with the office of Republican Rep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, the congressman said in a press release from his office Monday afternoon.
</p><p>
	“This executive order is just the beginning,” Van Drew said in a statement. “We will fight tooth and nail to prevent this offshore wind catastrophe from wreaking havoc on the hardworking people who call our coastal towns home.”
</p><p>
	The announcement indicates that some in the anti-wind space are leaving open the possibility that Trump’s much-hyped offshore wind ban may be less sweeping than initially suggested.
</p><p>
	In <a href="https://vandrew.house.gov/news/email/show.aspx?ID=4WCDH2I7AJH54" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>its press release</u></a>, Van Drew’s office said the executive order would “lay the groundwork for permanent measures against the projects,” leaving the door open to only a temporary pause on permitting new projects. The congressman had <a href="https://www.njspotlightnews.org/2025/01/nj-rep-jeff-van-drew-drafts-trump-executive-order-freezing-offshore-wind-development/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>recently told</u></a> New Jersey reporters that he anticipates only a six-month moratorium on offshore wind.
</p><p>
	The release also stated that the “proposed order” is “expected to be finalized within the first few months of the administration,” which is a far cry from Trump’s promise to stop projects <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/vineyard-wind-trump" target="_self"><u>on Day 1</u></a>. If enacted, a pause would essentially halt <em><em>all</em></em> U.S. offshore wind development because the sought-after stretches of national coastline are entirely within federal waters.
</p><p>
	Whether this is just caution from Van Drew’s people or a true moderation of Trump’s ambition we’ll soon find out. Inauguration Day is in less than a week.

## VOA Mandarin: US and China's geopolitical battle over damage to undersea cables

date: 2025-01-13, from: VOA News USA

Recent incidents, including a Chinese cargo ship allegedly cutting a Taiwanese undersea cable, underscore the vulnerability of global undersea infrastructure. While most damage results from accidents, “gray zone” tactics — which involve deliberate but covert sabotage by states like China and Russia — are becoming a geopolitical threat. VOA China examines the geopolitical battle for undersea cables, which are the backbone of modern communication, handling 98% of international data transfers.

## An Unexpected Obstacle to Putting Out the L.A. Fires

You’re working long hours — not as long as your colleagues on the ground due to flight time limitations, but the maximum scheduling allows — not to mention the added external pressures you’re also facing.

Last week, a drone punched a hole in the wing of a Québécois “Super Scooper” plane that had <a href="https://skiesmag.com/news/quebec-cl-415-super-scooper-may-resume-flying-today-after-drone-strike-repairs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>traveled down from Canada</u></a> to fight the fires, grounding Palisades firefighting operations <a href="https://abc7.com/post/california-wildfires-fbi-shares-photos-pieces-drone-damaged-super-scooper-aircraft-flying-palisades-fire/15792412/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>for an agonizing half-hour</u></a>. Thirty minutes might not seem like much, but it is precious time lost when the Santa Ana winds have already curtailed aerial operations. </p><p>“I am shocked by what happened in Los Angeles with the drone,” Anna Lau, a forestry communication coordinator with the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation, told me.

<small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Courtesy of U.S. Forest Service</small></p><p>Although the Super Scooper collision was by far the most egregious case, according to authorities there have been at least 40 “incidents involving drones” in the airspace around L.A. since the fires started. (Notably, the Federal Aviation Administration has not granted any waivers for the air space around Palisades, meaning any drone images you see of the region, including on the news, were “probably shot illegally,” <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/los-angeles-firefighters-drones.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>Intelligencer</em></em></u><u> reports</u></a>.) So far, law enforcement has arrested three people <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/5082600-unauthorized-drone-flights-double-in-southern-california-3-arrested-during-la-fires/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>connected to drones flying</u></a> near the L.A. fires, and the FBI is <a href="https://x.com/FBIMostWanted/status/1878910193259454890" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>seeking information</u></a> regarding the Super Scooper collision.</p><p>Such a problem is hardly isolated to these fires, though. The Forest Service reports that drones led to the suspension of or interfered with <a href="https://richmondobserver.com/local-news/forest-service-agencies-reminding-residents-across-the-state-to-keep-drones-away-from-wildfires.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>at least 172 fire responses</u></a> between 2015 and 2020. Some people, including Mike Fraietta, an FAA-certified drone pilot and the founder of the drone-detection company Gargoyle Systems, believe the true number of interferences is much higher — closer to 400.</p><p>Law enforcement likes to say that unauthorized drone use falls into three buckets — <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/unauthorized-drone-usage-in-double-digits-amid-socals-firefight/3602131/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>clueless, criminal, or careless</u></a> — and Fraietta was inclined to believe that it’s mostly the former in L.A. Hobbyists and other casual drone operators “don’t know the regulations or that this is a danger,” he said. “There’s a lot of ignorance.” To raise awareness, he suggested law enforcement and the media highlight the steep penalties for flying drones in wildfire no-fly zones, which is punishable <a href="https://www.kxlh.com/us-news/california-wildfires/firefighting-plane-grounded-after-drone-strike-will-be-back-in-the-air-soon-officials-said#:~:text=including%20the%20FAA.-,Officials%20said%2C%20so%20far%2C%20three%20people%20have%20been%20arrested%20for,fine%20of%20up%20to%20%2475%2C000." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>by up to</u></a> 12 months in prison or a fine of $75,000.</p><p>“What we’re seeing, particularly in California, is TikTok and Instagram influencers trying to get a shot and get likes,” Fraietta conjectured. In the case of the drone that hit the Super Scooper, it “might have been a case of citizen journalism, like, <em><em>Well, I have the ability to get this shot and share what’s going on</em></em>.” </p><p>Emergency management teams are waking up, too. Many technologies are on the horizon for drone detection, identification, and deflection, including Wi-Fi jamming, which was used to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/london-heathrow-appears-jam-drone-signals-stop-climate-protests-2019-9#:~:text=for%20more%20stories.-,London's%20Heathrow%20Airport%20appears%20to%20have%20worked%20out%20how%20to,protesters%20from%20disrupting%20its%20airspace.&text=Activists%20from%20the%20group%20Heathrow,that%20most%20did%20not%20work." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ground climate activists’ drones</u></a> at Heathrow Airport in 2019. Jamming is less practical in an emergency situation like the one in L.A., though, where lives could be at stake if people can’t communicate.</p><p>Still, the fact of the matter is that firefighters waste precious time dealing with drones when there are far more pressing issues that need their attention. Lau, in Montana, described how even just a 12-minute interruption to firefighting efforts can put a community at risk. “The biggest public awareness message we put out is, ‘If you fly, we can’t,’” she said. </p><p>Fraietta, though, noted that drone <a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/los-angeles-fires-tech" target="_self"><u>technology could be used positively in the future</u></a>, including on wildfire detection and monitoring, <a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/drone-amplified-field-tech-lab-wildfires-drones" target="_self"><u>prescribed burns</u></a>, and communicating with firefighters <a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/new-york-disaster-drones" target="_self"><u>or victims</u></a> on the ground. </p><p>“We don’t want to see this turn into the FAA saying, ‘Hey everyone, no more drones in the United States because of this incident,’” Fraietta said. “You don’t shut down I-95 because a few people are running drugs up and down it, right? Drones are going to be super beneficial to the country long term.”</p><p>But critically, in the case of a wildfire, such tools belong in the <em><em>right</em></em> hands — not the hands of your neighbor who got a DJI Mini 3 for Christmas. “Their one shot isn’t worth it,” Lau said.</p><p><em>Editor’s note: This story has been updated to reflect that the Québécois firefighting planes are called Super Scoopers, not super soakers.</em><br/></p>

## Millions have had student loans canceled under Biden, despite collapse of his forgiveness plan

date: 2025-01-13, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON  — Despite failing to deliver his promise for broad student loan forgiveness, President Joe Biden has now overseen the cancellation of student loans for more than 5 million Americans — more than any other president in U.S. history.


In a last-minute action on Monday, the Education Department canceled loans for 150,000 borrowers through programs that existed before Biden took office. His administration expanded those programs and used them to their fullest extent, pressing on with cancellation even after the Supreme Court rejected Biden's plan for a new forgiveness policy.


“My Administration has taken historic action to reduce the burden of student debt, hold bad actors accountable, and fight on behalf of students across the country,” Biden said in a written statement.


In total, the administration says it has waived $183.6 billion in student loans.


The wave of cancellations could dry up when President-elect Donald Trump takes office. Trump hasn't detailed his student loan policies but previously called cancellation “vile” and illegal. Republicans have fought relentlessly against Biden's plans, saying cancellation is ultimately shouldered by taxpayers who never attended college or already repaid their loans.


Biden loosened rules for debt forgiveness


The latest round of relief mostly comes through a program known as borrower defense, which allows students to get their loans canceled if they're cheated or misled by their colleges. It was created in 1994 but rarely used until a wave of high-profile for-profit college scandals during the Obama administration.


A smaller share of the relief came through a program for borrowers with disabilities and through Public Service Loan Forgiveness, which was created in 2007 and offers to erase all remaining debt for borrowers in a government or nonprofit job who make 10 years of monthly payments.


Most of Monday's borrower defense cancellations were for students who attended several defunct colleges owned by Center for Excellence in Higher Education, including CollegeAmerica, Stevens-Henager College, and Independence University. They are based on past findings that the schools lied to prospective students about their employment prospects and the terms of private loans.


Before Biden took office, those programs were criticized by advocates who said complex rules made it difficult for borrowers to get relief. The Biden administration loosened some of the rules using its regulatory power, a maneuver that expanded eligibility without going through Congress.


As an example, just 7,000 borrowers had gotten their loans canceled through Public Service Loan Forgiveness before the Biden administration took office. Widespread confusion about eligibility, along with errors by loan servicers, resulted in a 99% rejection rate for applicants.


Huge numbers of borrowers made years of payments only to find out they were in an ineligible repayment plan. Some were improperly put into forbearance — a pause on payments — by their loan servicers. Those periods didn't end up counting toward the 10 years of payments needed for cancellation.


The Biden administration temporarily relaxed the eligibility rules during the pandemic and then made it more permanent in 2023. As a result, more than 1 million public servants have now had their balances zeroed out through the program.


All those rule changes were meant to be a companion to Biden's marquee policy for student debt, which proposed up to $20,000 in relief for more than 40 million Americans.


But after the Supreme Court blocked the move, the Biden administration shifted its focus to maximizing relief through existing mechanisms.


Republicans have called for a different approach


Announcements of new cancellation became routine, even as conservatives in Congress accused Biden of overstepping his power. Republican states fought off Biden's later attempts at mass forgiveness, but the smaller batches of relief continued without any major legal challenge.


As Republicans take hold of both chambers of Congress and the White House, Biden's changes could be targeted for a rollback. But it's unclear how far the next administration will go to tighten the cancellation spigot.


Trump proposed eliminating PSLF during his first term in office, but Congress rejected the idea. Project 2025, a blueprint created by the Heritage Foundation for a second Trump term, proposes ending PSLF, and narrowing borrower defense and making repayment plans less generous than existing ones.

## Elon Musk says third patient got Neuralink brain implant

date: 2025-01-13, from: VOA News USA

Elon Musk said a third person has received an implant from his brain-computer interface company Neuralink, one of many groups working to connect the nervous system to machines.


“We've got ... three humans with Neuralinks and all are working well,” he said during a recent wide-ranging interview at a Las Vegas event streamed on his social media platform X.


Since the first brain implant about a year ago, Musk said the company has upgraded the devices with more electrodes, higher bandwidth and longer battery life. Musk also said Neuralink hopes to implant the experimental devices in 20 to 30 more people this year.


Musk didn't provide any details about the latest patient, but there are updates on the previous ones.


The second recipient — who has a spinal cord injury and got the implant last summer — was playing video games with the help of the device and learning how to use computer-aided design software to create 3-D objects. The first patient, also paralyzed after a spinal cord injury, described how it helped him play video games and chess.


But while such developments at Neuralink often attract notice, many other companies and research groups are working on similar projects. Two studies last year in the New England Journal of Medicine described how brain-computer interfaces, or BCIs, helped people with ALS communicate better.


Who's working on brain-computer interface technology?


More than 45 trials involving brain-computer interfaces are underway, according to a U.S. database of studies. The efforts are aimed at helping treat brain disorders, overcoming brain injuries and other uses.


Many research labs have already shown that humans can accurately control computer cursors using BCIs, said Rajesh Rao, co-director of the Center for Neurotechnology at the University of Washington.


Rao said Neuralink may be unique in two ways: The surgery to implant the device is the first time a robot has been used to implant flexible electrode threads into a human brain to record neural activity and control devices. And those threads may record from more neurons than other interfaces.


Still, he said, the advantages of Neuralink’s approach have yet to be shown, and some competitors have eclipsed the company in other ways. For example, Rao said companies such as Synchron, Blackrock Neurotech and Onward Medical are already conducting BCI trials on people “using either less invasive methods or more versatile approaches” that combine neural recording with stimulation.


What are the benefits of BCIs?


Marco Baptista, chief scientific officer of the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation, called BCI technology “very exciting” with potential benefits to people with paralysis.


Through clinical trials, “we’ll be able to see what’s going to be the winning approach,” he said. “It’s a little early to know."


Baptista said his foundation generally tries to support research teams financially and with expert help – though it hasn’t given any money to Neuralink.


“We need to really support high-risk, high-reward endeavors. This is clearly high-risk, high-reward. We don’t know how safe it’s going to be. We don’t know how feasible it’s going to be," he said.


How are BCIs tested and regulated?


Neuralink announced in 2023 that it had gotten permission from U.S. regulators to begin testing its device in people.


While most medical devices go on the market without clinical studies, high-risk ones that undergo pre-market approval need what’s called an “investigational device exemption” from the Food and Drug Administration, said Dr. Rita Redberg, a cardiologist at the University of California, San Francisco, who studies high-risk devices.


Neuralink says it has this exemption, but the FDA said it can’t confirm or disclose information about a particular study.


Redberg said the FDA tends to be involved in all steps from recruiting patients to testing devices to analyzing data. She said this regulatory process prioritizes safety.


She also pointed to another layer of protection: All research involving people needs an institutional review board, or IRB. It can also be known as an ethical review board or an independent ethics committee. Members must include at least one non-scientist as well as someone not affiliated with the institution or organization forming the board.


The role of such boards “is to assume there is reasonable risk and reasonable chance of benefit and that patients are informed of those before they enroll," said Redberg.

## Biden defends foreign policy record despite ongoing crises

date: 2025-01-13, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Outgoing President Joe Biden sought to burnish his foreign policy record on Monday and said U.S. adversaries are weaker than when he took office four years ago despite global crises that remain unresolved.


A week before handing over to President-elect Donald Trump, Biden addressed U.S. diplomats at the State Department and touted his administration's backing for Ukraine against Russia's 2022 invasion and for Israel's wars in the Middle East.


Biden said the United States was "winning the worldwide competition" and would not be surpassed economically by China as had been predicted, while Russia and Iran have been weakened by wars without direct U.S. involvement.


"Compared to four years ago, America is stronger, our alliances are stronger, our adversaries and competitors are weaker," Biden said. "We have not gone to war to make these things happen."


While wars continue to rage in Ukraine and the Middle East, officials hope a deal between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas can be reached before Biden departs the White House on Jan. 20.


Biden said negotiators were close to reaching a deal that would free hostages held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip and halt the fighting in the Palestinian enclave to allow a surge of humanitarian aid.


"So many innocent people have been killed, so many communities have been destroyed. Palestinian people deserve peace, a right to determine their own futures. Israel deserves peace and real security. The hostages and their families deserve to be reunited," Biden said. "And so we're working urgently to close this deal."


Biden has faced criticism for providing Israel with weapons and diplomatic support, since the latest bloodshed in the decades-old Israeli Palestinian conflict began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.


Israel's subsequent military assault on Gaza has killed over 46,000 Palestinians, according to the local health ministry, while also drawing accusations of genocide in a World Court case brought by South Africa and of war crimes and crimes against humanity at the International Criminal Court. Israel denies the allegations.


The assault has displaced nearly Gaza's entire 2.3 million population and drawn the concern of the world’s main hunger monitor.


Protesters shouting “war criminal” greeted Biden outside the State Department on Monday, some with signs and some throwing red liquid intended to look like blood.


Biden said he had helped Israel defeat adversaries including Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, both backed by Iran. The U.S. president also hailed Washington's support for Israel during two Iranian attacks in 2024.


"All told, Iran is weaker than it's been in decades," he added, noting the collapse of the Syrian Assad government. "There's no question that our actions contributed significantly."


Authoritarian alliance


Biden acknowledged that authoritarian states China, Iran, North Korea and Russia were now more closely aligned with one another, but he said that was more "out of weakness than out of strength."


Ukraine, with U.S. backing, had thwarted Russian President Vladimir Putin's goal of wiping the country off the map, Biden said, touting his 2023 visit to Kyiv as the first by a sitting president to a war zone outside the control of U.S. forces.


"When Putin invaded Ukraine, he thought he (could) conquer Kyiv in a matter of days. Truth is, since that war began, I'm the only one that stood in the center of Kyiv, not him," Biden said.


Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, writing on Telegram, said Biden's address amounted to an acknowledgement "that U.S. support for Kyiv created the risk of triggering a nuclear confrontation with Russia."


"Today's statement by Biden is an admission of a deliberately executed provocation," Zakharova wrote. "The Biden administration knew it was pushing the world toward the brink and still chose to escalate the conflict."


Biden defended his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan, saying there was nothing adversaries like China and Russia would have liked more than seeing the United States continue to be tied down there for another decade.


Biden said when he entered the White House, experts predicted it was inevitable that China would surpass the United States in economic terms. Now, he predicted, that will never happen. He said the U.S. economy was moving forward, but there was still work to do.


"Now, make no mistake, there are serious challenges the United States must continue to deal with," Biden said, including in Ukraine, the Middle East and the Indo-Pacific. He said the Biden administration was leaving the next administration "a very strong hand to play."

## Baltimore prosecutors back Adnan Syed's request to have his sentence reduced to time served

date: 2025-01-13, from: VOA News USA

Baltiomore, Md. — Baltimore prosecutors filed a motion supporting Adnan Syed's recent request to have his sentence reduced to time served, which could ensure he remains free indefinitely as he awaits further court decisions in a decadeslong legal saga that amassed a large following from the hit podcast "Serial."


Syed was released from prison in 2022 after prosecutors asked a judge to overturn his murder conviction in the 1999 slaying of his high school ex-girlfriend, Hae Min Lee. But challenges from Lee's family later led to his conviction being reinstated. In August, the Maryland Supreme Court upheld a lower court decision ordering a new hearing about vacating the conviction.


Last month, Syed's attorneys filed a motion asking for his sentence to be reduced under Maryland's relatively new Juvenile Restoration Act, which allows people serving long sentences for crimes they committed as minors to seek release after 20 years behind bars. The legislation was passed amid growing consensus that such defendants are especially open to rehabilitation, in part because brain science shows cognitive development continues well beyond the teenage years. Syed was 17 when Lee was found strangled to death and buried in a makeshift grave.


Prosecutors filed the motion in support of a sentence reduction on Sunday, according to the Baltimore City State's Attorney's Office.


In it, State's Attorney Ivan Bates said Syed's request is "in the interest of justice."


"I truly believe Mr. Syed's case is precisely what legislators envisioned when they crafted the Juvenile Restoration Act," Bates said in a statement Monday. "We have an individual who has served over 20 years in prison from the time he was a teenager and who has displayed tremendous personal growth and reform."


But attorneys for the Lee family argue it's premature to consider a sentence reduction while the integrity of the conviction is still up in the air.


"That question regarding ultimate guilt or innocence needs to be resolved before any thought of reducing Mr. Syed's sentence can be considered," attorney David Sanford said in a statement. "Currently Mr. Syed remains a convicted murderer and nothing the State or Mr. Syed has ever presented calls that fact into question."




The case, which has been rife with legal twists and turns, has more recently pitted criminal justice reform efforts against the rights of crime victims and their families, whose voices are often at odds with a growing movement to acknowledge and correct longstanding issues such as systemic racism, police misconduct and prosecutorial missteps.


Since his release in 2022, Syed has been working at Georgetown University's Prisons and Justice Initiative and helping care for his aging parents, according to court filings. His father died in October after a long illness.


"He cares so much about our family," his mother wrote in a recent letter to the court. "He is married and tries to be the best husband he can. He is always trying to help us out anyway that he can. He has tried hard to become a positive member of his community."




Syed has maintained his innocence from the beginning, but many questions about the case remain unanswered even after the "Serial" podcast combed through the evidence, reexamined legal arguments and interviewed witnesses. The series debuted in 2014 and drew millions of listeners who became armchair detectives.


Prosecutors wrote that since his release from prison in 2022, Syed, 43, has shown he doesn't pose a threat to public safety.


"In taking this position, the State does not want to minimize the seriousness of the crime in this case," the motion says. "The State, however, does not believe in warehousing individuals who committed a crime when they were a juvenile and have demonstrated maturity, have been rehabilitated [and] are now fit to reenter society."


But the motion doesn't present a position on Syed's conviction itself.


The Maryland Supreme Court's 4-3 ruling in August called for a new hearing on whether the conviction should be vacated because the victim's relatives didn't receive adequate notice to allow them to attend the original proceeding, which won Syed his freedom.


Bates, who took office as state's attorney a few months after the 2022 hearing, is now weighing how to proceed given the Supreme Court's decision. But if Syed's motion for a reduced sentence is granted, he would likely avoid going back to prison regardless.

## Judge clears way for release of special counsel Smith's report on Trump's Jan. 6 case

date: 2025-01-13, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The Justice Department can publicly release its investigative report on President-elect Donald Trump's 2020 election interference case, a federal judge said Monday — the latest ruling in a court dispute over the highly anticipated document days before Trump is set to take office again.


But a temporary injunction barring the immediate release of the report remains in effect until Tuesday, and it's unlikely Judge Aileen Cannon's order will be the last word on the matter. Defense lawyers may seek to challenge it all the way up to the Supreme Court.


Cannon had earlier temporarily blocked the department from releasing the entire report on former Special Counsel Jack Smith's investigations into Trump that led to two separate criminal cases. Cannon's latest order on Monday cleared the way for the release of the volume on Trump's 2020 election interference case.


She set a hearing for Friday on whether the department can release to lawmakers the volume on Trump's classified documents case. The department has said it will not publicly disclose that volume as long as criminal proceedings against two of Trump's co-defendants remain pending.


Smith resigned his position on Friday after transmitting his report to Attorney General Merrick Garland, the Justice Department revealed in a footnote in a court filing over the weekend.


The ruling, if it stands, could open the door for the public to learn additional details in the coming days about Trump's frantic but ultimately failed effort to cling to power in the run-up to the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the Capitol.


But even as Cannon permitted the release of the volume on election interference, she halted the Justice Department from immediately sharing with congressional officials a separate volume related to Trump's hoarding of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida. Lawyers for the Republican president-elect's two co-defendants, Trump valet Walt Nauta and Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos De Oliveira, had argued that the release of the report would prejudice them given that criminal proceedings remain ongoing against them in the form of a Justice Department appeal of Cannon's dismissal of charges.


As a compromise, the Justice Department said that it would not make that document public but would instead share it with select congressional officials for their private review. But Cannon halted those plans and instead scheduled a hearing for Friday afternoon.


"All parties agree that Volume II expressly and directly concerns this criminal proceeding," she wrote. "All parties also appear to agree that public release of Volume II would be inconsistent with the fair trial rights of Defendants Nauta and De Oliveira and with Department of Justice Policy governing the release of information during the pendency of criminal proceedings."

## US designates extreme right-wing 'Terrorgram' network as terrorist group

date: 2025-01-13, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The U.S. on Monday imposed sanctions on an extreme right-wing online network, designating the "Terrorgram" collective a terrorist group and accusing it of promoting violent white supremacy. 


The U.S. State Department said in a statement that it had designated the group, which primarily operates on the Telegram social media site, and three of its leaders as Specially Designated Global Terrorists. 


The State Department said the group has motivated and facilitated attacks and attempted attacks by users, including a 2022 shooting outside an LGBTQ bar in Slovakia, a planned attack in 2024 on energy facilities in New Jersey and an August knife attack at a mosque in Turkey. 


"The group promotes violent white supremacism, solicits attacks on perceived adversaries, and provides guidance and instructional materials on tactics, methods, and targets for attacks, including on critical infrastructure and government officials," the State Department said. 


The action freezes any of the group's U.S. assets and bars Americans from dealing with it. 


The leaders targeted on Monday with sanctions were based in Brazil, Croatia and South Africa, according to the statement. 


In September, U.S. prosecutors unveiled criminal charges against two alleged leaders of the group, saying they used Telegram to solicit attacks on Black, Jewish, LGBTQ people and immigrants with the aim of inciting a race war. 


Britain in April said it would proscribe the Terrorgram collective as a terrorist organization, meaning it would become a criminal offense in the country to belong to or promote the group. 


U.S. President Joe Biden has railed against white supremacy while in office. 


In 2021, Biden launched the first-ever U.S. National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism, which included resources to identify and prosecute threats and new deterrents to prevent Americans from joining dangerous groups.

## What Started the Fires in Los Angeles?

date: 2025-01-13, from: Heatmap News

	As Los Angeles continued to battle multiple big blazes ripping through some of the most beloved (and expensive) areas of the city on Friday, a question lingered in the background: What caused the fires in the first place?
</p><p>
	Though fires are less common in California during this time of the year, they aren’t unheard of. In early December 2017, power lines sparked the Thomas Fire near Ventura, California, which burned through to mid-January. At the time it was the largest fire in the state since at least the 1930s. Now <a href="https://34c031f8-c9fd-4018-8c5a-4159cdff6b0d-cdn-endpoint.azureedge.net/-/media/calfire-website/our-impact/fire-statistics/top-20-largest-ca-wildfires.pdf?rev=097f901c128347149e2614f2fca4f546&hash=27DDE83DFEF9A69E67C73765892A2B75" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>it’s the ninth-largest</u></a>. Although that fire was in a more rural area, it ignited for some of the same reasons we’re seeing fires this week.
</p><p>
	Read on for everything we know so far about how the fires started.
</p><h3>How many fires are burning in Los Angeles County and where are they?</h3><br/><p>
	Six major fires started during the Santa Ana wind event last week:
</p><p>
<br/>
</p><ul>
<li>The Palisades Fire, in the Pacific Palisades, which has burned nearly 24,000 acres, started on Tuesday, January 7, around 10:30 a.m. Pacific time.</li>
<li>The Eaton Fire, north of Pasadena, which has burned more than 14,000 acres, started on Tuesday just after 6:00 p.m.</li>
<li>The Hurst Fire, in the northern edge of the San Fernando Valley, which has burned about 800 acres, started on Tuesday night around 10:30 pm.</li>
<li>The Lidia Fire, in Acton, California, just north of Angeles National Forest, which has burned roughly 400 acres, started on Wednesday afternoon around 1:00 p.m. As of Saturday morning it was declared 100% contained.</li>
<li>The Sunset Fire, in the Hollywood Hills, which has burned about 43 acres, started on Wednesday night around 5:30 p.m. Evacuation orders lifted early Thursday morning, when the fire’s “forward progress has been stopped,” and crews were working to “put out hotspots within the fire perimeter and keep the wind from spreading embers,” <a href="https://x.com/PIOErikScott" target="_blank"><u>according to Los Angeles Fire Department Public Information Officer Erik Scott</u></a>.</li>
<li>The Kenneth Fire, in the hills above Calabasas, which burned a little over 1,000 acres, started on Thursday around 3:30 p.m. As of Sunday morning it was declared 100% contained.</li>
</ul><h3>How did the fires start?</h3><br><p>Officials are investigating the cause of the fires and have not made any public statements yet. <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-01-12/la-me-eaton-fire-power-lines" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Early eyewitness accounts</u></a> suggest that the Eaton Fire may have started at the base of a transmission tower owned by Southern California Edison. So far, the company has maintained that an analysis of its equipment showed “no interruptions or electrical or operational anomalies until more than one hour after the reported start time of the fire.” A <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2025/01/12/palisades-fire-origin-new-years-eve-fire/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>Washington Post</em></em></u><u> investigation found</u></a> that the Palisades Fire could have risen from the remnants of a fire that burned on New Year’s Eve and reignited. </p><p>On Thursday morning, Edward Nordskog, a retired fire investigator from the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department, told me it was unlikely they had even begun looking into the root of the biggest and most destructive of the fires in the Pacific Palisades. “They don't start an investigation until it's safe to go into the area where the fire started, and it just hasn't been safe until probably today,” he said.</p><p>It can take years to determine the cause of a fire. Investigators did not pinpoint the cause of the Thomas Fire until March 2019, more than two years after it started.</p><p>But Nordskog doesn’t think it will take very long this time. It’s easier to narrow down the possibilities for an urban fire because there are typically both witnesses and surveillance footage, he told me. He said the most common causes of wildfires in Los Angeles are power lines and those started by unhoused people. They can also be caused by sparks from vehicles or equipment.</p><h3>How do these fires compare to past fires in California?</h3><br/><p>At more than 40,000 acres burned total, these fires are unlikely to make the charts for the <a href="https://34c031f8-c9fd-4018-8c5a-4159cdff6b0d-cdn-endpoint.azureedge.net/-/media/calfire-website/our-impact/fire-statistics/top-20-largest-ca-wildfires.pdf?rev=097f901c128347149e2614f2fca4f546&hash=27DDE83DFEF9A69E67C73765892A2B75" target="_blank"><u>largest in California history</u></a>. But because they are burning in urban, densely populated, and expensive areas, they could be some of the most devastating. With an <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/live/pacific-palisades-fire-updates-los-angeles" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>estimated 9,000 structures damaged</u></a> as of Friday morning, the Eaton and Palisades fires are likely to make the list for <a href="https://34c031f8-c9fd-4018-8c5a-4159cdff6b0d-cdn-endpoint.azureedge.net/-/media/calfire-website/our-impact/fire-statistics/top-20-destructive-ca-wildfires.pdf?rev=9e4974c273274858880c2dd28292a96f&hash=29E21CBFCE8D9885F606246607D21CEB" target="_blank"><u>most destructive wildfire events</u></a> in the state.</p><p>And they will certainly be at the top for costliest. The Palisades Fire has already been declared a likely contender for the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-09/the-costliest-fire-on-record-not-just-for-california" target="_blank"><u>most expensive wildfire in U.S. history</u></a>.  It has destroyed <a href="https://lafd.org/news/palisades-fire-0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more than 5,000</u></a> structures in some of the most expensive zip codes in the country. Between that and the Eaton Fire, Accuweather estimates the damages could reach <a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/blogs-webinars/california-wildfires-52-57b-damage-estimate-accuweather-report/1731718" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$57 billion</u></a>.</p><h3>Why are these fires so bad? Is it climate change?</h3><br/><p>
	While we don’t know the root causes of the ignitions, several factors came together to create perfect fire conditions in Southern California this week.
</p><p>
	First, there’s the <a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/santa-ana-winds-climate-change" target="_self"><u>Santa Ana winds</u></a>, an annual phenomenon in Southern California, when very dry, high-pressure air gets trapped in the Great Basin and begins escaping westward through mountain passes to lower-pressure areas along the coast. Most of the time, the wind in Los Angeles blows eastward from the ocean, but during a Santa Ana event, it changes direction, picking up speed as it rushes toward the sea.
</p><p>
	Jon Keeley, a research scientist with the US Geological Survey and an adjunct professor at the University of California, Los Angeles told me that Santa Ana winds typically blow at maybe 30 to 40 miles per hour, while the winds this week hit upwards of 60 to 70 miles per hour. “More severe than is normal, but not unique,” he said. “We had similar severe winds in 2017 with the Thomas Fire.”
</p><p>
	Second, Southern California is currently in the midst of extreme drought. Winter is typically a rainier season, but Los Angeles has seen less than half an inch of rain since July. That means that all the shrubland vegetation in the area is bone-dry. Again, Keeley said, this was not usual, but not unique. Some years are drier than others.
</p><p>
	These fires were also not a question of fuel management, Keeley told me. “The fuels are not really the issue in these big fires. It's the extreme winds,” he said. “You can do prescription burning in chaparral and have essentially no impact on Santa Ana wind-driven fires.” As far as he can tell, <a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2025/1/7/eaton-fire/updates/b71f526e-4b91-4cdc-99cd-f5e19c80105f" target="_blank"><u>based on information from CalFire</u></a>, the Eaton Fire started on an urban street.
</p><p>
	While it’s likely that climate change played a role in amplifying the drought, it’s hard to say how big a factor it was. Patrick Brown, a climate scientist at the Breakthrough Institute and adjunct professor at Johns Hopkins University, published a long <a href="https://x.com/PatrickTBrown31/status/1877134442839310573" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>post on X</u></a> outlining the factors contributing to the fires, including a <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/city/time-series/USW00023174/pcp/3/2/1895-2024?base_prd=true&begbaseyear=1991&endbaseyear=2020&trend=true&trend_base=10&begtrendyear=1975&endtrendyear=2024" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>chart</u></a> of historic rainfall during the winter in Los Angeles that shows oscillations between wet and dry years over the past eight decades.
</p><p>
But climate change is expected to make dry years drier and wet years wetter, creating a “hydroclimate whiplash,” as Daniel Swain, a pre-eminent expert on climate change and weather in California puts it. In a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/weatherwest.bsky.social/post/3lfdot3l5dm2o" target="_blank"><u>thread on Bluesky</u></a>, Swain wrote that “in 2024, Southern California experienced an exceptional episode of wet-to-dry hydroclimate whiplash.” Last year’s rainy winter fostered abundant plant growth, and the proceeding dryness primed the vegetation for fire.

EV leases are booming</h3><p>Affordable EV leases are “the car market’s hottest deal,” <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/ev-lease-tax-credit-loophole-taxpayers-85fc489b?mod=hp_listb_pos3&utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_QOYAQ1junHUjUOJTljXfLIT2mxmej0leE1gFOZn1y-ESBGPQzEcYGr_6KqmqFwQOma5XP" target="_blank">according to</a> <em><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></em>. Car companies are changing the way they pitch EVs to buyers, offering short-term leases with low monthly payments. These deals are attractive to first-time EV shoppers who are still a little bit hesitant to commit, as well as people on a tighter budget. Roughly 45% of EV transactions at the end of 2024 were leases, much higher than the auto industry as a whole. And a provision in the Inflation Reduction Act means leased cars can more easily qualify for the government’s $7,500 EV tax credit. “The proliferation of lease deals has made EVs more accessible to buyers who couldn’t afford their higher sticker prices,” the <em><em>Journal</em></em> said. “For the automakers, it is helping get more EVs into customers’ hands after a choppy start for their electric-car operations.” </p><h3>4. Wind power generation could surpass coal in EU</h3><p>Wind power could overtake coal in Europe for electricity generation for the first time this year, according to the energy think tank Ember. At the end of 2024, wind power was closing in on coal, coming in at just 4% below the fossil fuel in power generation as the continent’s coal plants close. “That output gap could easily be made up over the course of 2025 by an increase in regional wind generation capacity or by higher average wind speeds at turbine level, or by some combination of both,” <em><em>Reuters</em></em> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/europes-wind-farms-track-eclipse-coal-output-2025-maguire-2025-01-13/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_QOYAQ1junHUjUOJTljXfLIT2mxmej0leE1gFOZn1y-ESBGPQzEcYGr_6KqmqFwQOma5XP" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>. Last year wind power accounted for 20% of electricity consumed in the EU, and the goal is to get that up to 50% by 2050. But as <em><em>Electrek</em></em> <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/01/10/europe-wind-power-hits-20-but-3-challenges-stall-progress/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_QOYAQ1junHUjUOJTljXfLIT2mxmej0leE1gFOZn1y-ESBGPQzEcYGr_6KqmqFwQOma5XP" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">noted</a>, the same problems plaguing projects in the U.S. – permitting delays and connection bottlenecks – are slowing things down. The EU accounts for <a href="https://ember-energy.org/countries-and-regions/european-union/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_QOYAQ1junHUjUOJTljXfLIT2mxmej0leE1gFOZn1y-ESBGPQzEcYGr_6KqmqFwQOma5XP#:~:text=The%20European%20Union%20(EU)%20is,2023%20%E2%80%93%20double%20the%20global%20average." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">4.6%</a> of global power sector emissions. </p><h3>5. WHO calls for case studies on mental health care in the climate crisis</h3><p>The World Health Organization’s European Centre for Environment and Health has <a href="https://extranet.who.int/dataformv6/index.php/611299?lang=en&utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_QOYAQ1junHUjUOJTljXfLIT2mxmej0leE1gFOZn1y-ESBGPQzEcYGr_6KqmqFwQOma5XP" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">issued a callout</a> for “examples of interventions to protect and promote mental health in the face of climate change.” The group wants to take stock of these interventions so that it can identify gaps in mental health care and share some best practices. The callout is aimed at Europe only, but it is indicative of a growing awareness of how the worsening climate crisis is <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/publications/all-publications/the-impact-of-climate-change-on-mental-health-and-emotional-wellbeing-current-evidence-and-implications-for-policy-and-practice.php?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_QOYAQ1junHUjUOJTljXfLIT2mxmej0leE1gFOZn1y-ESBGPQzEcYGr_6KqmqFwQOma5XP" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">taking a toll on mental health</a> worldwide.</p><h2>THE KICKER</h2><p><em>“There’s a lot of finger-pointing going around, and I would just try to emphasize that this is a really complex problem.

## What You Need to Know About the Still-Burning L.A. Fires

date: 2025-01-13, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTU1NTIzNi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0NTg5NDU1M30.ezebBuJnVTx6wSKIJu0S0Xs2Q87zwKryOSpTJ5LY-cc/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">A week ago, forecasters in Southern California warned residents of Los Angeles that conditions would be dry, windy, and conducive to wildfires. How bad things have gotten, though, has taken everyone by surprise. As of Monday morning, almost 40,000 acres of Los Angeles County have burned in six separate fires, the biggest of which, Palisades and Eaton, have yet to be fully contained. The latest red flag warning, indicating fire weather, won’t expire until Wednesday.</p><p>Many have questions about how the second-biggest city in the country is facing such unbelievable devastation (some of these questions, perhaps, being <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113813952733064849" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more politically motivated</u></a> than others). Below, we’ve tried to collect as many answers as possible — including a bit of good news about what lies ahead.</p><h3>What is the forecast for the week ahead?</h3><br/><p>
	A <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/los-angeles-fires-wind-forecast" target="_self"><u>second Santa Ana wind event</u></a> is due to set in Monday afternoon. “We’re expecting moderate Santa Ana winds over the next few days, generally in the 20 to 30 [mile per hour] range, gusting to 50, across the mountains and through the canyons,” Eric Drewitz, a meteorologist with the Forest Service, told me on Sunday. Drewitz noted that the winds will be less severe than last week’s, when the fires flared up, but he also anticipates they’ll be “more easterly,” which could blow the fires into new areas. A new red flag warning has been issued through Wednesday, signaling increased fire potential due to low humidity and high winds for several days yet.
</p><p>
If firefighters can prevent new flare-ups and hold back the fires through that wind event, they might be in good shape. By Friday of this week, “it looks like we could have some moderate onshore flow,” Drewitz said, when wet ocean air blows inland, which would help “build back the marine layer” and increase the relative humidity in the region, <em><em>decreasing</em></em> the chances of more fires. Information about the Santa Anas at that time is still uncertain — the models have been changing, and the wind is tricky to predict the strength of so far out — but an increase in humidity will at least offer some relief for the battered Ventura and Orange Counties.
</p><h3>What areas have been affected so far?</h3><br/><p>The Palisades Fire, the biggest in L.A., ripped through the hilly and affluent area between Santa Monica and Malibu, including the Pacific Palisades neighborhood, <a href="https://patch.com/california/pacificpalisades/pacific-palisades-named-2nd-most-expensive-real-estate-market-la" target="_blank"><u>the second-most expensive zip code</u></a> in Los Angeles and home to many celebrities.

	It can take years to determine the cause of a fire, and investigations typically don’t begin until after the fire is under control and the area is safe to reenter, Edward Nordskog, a retired fire investigator from the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department, <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/what-started-los-angeles-fires?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1:~:text=How%20did%20the%20fires%20start%3F" target="_self"><u>told Heatmap’s Emily Pontecorvo</u></a>. He also noted, however, that urban fires are typically easier to pinpoint the cause of than wildland fires due to the availability of witnesses and surveillance footage.
</p><p>
The vast majority of wildfires, 85%, <a href="https://www.nps.gov/articles/wildfire-causes-and-evaluation.htm" target="_blank"><u>are caused by humans</u></a>.<strong> </strong>So far, investigators have ruled out lightning — another common fire-starter — because there were no electrical storms in the area when the fires started. In the case of the Palisades Fire, there were no power lines in the area of the ignition, though investigators are now looking into an electrical transmission tower in Eaton Canyon as <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-01-12/la-me-eaton-fire-power-lines" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the possible cause</u></a> of the deadly fire in Altadena. There have been rumors that arsonists started the <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/park-fire-arson" target="_self"><u>fires</u></a>, but investigators say that scenario is also <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/weather/wildfires/are-arsonists-responsible-los-angeles-wildfires-rcna186949" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pretty unlikely</u></a> due to the spread of the fires and how remote the ignition areas are.
</p><h3>How many people have died?</h3><br/><p>Officially, <u><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2025/01/13/los-angeles-fires-california-updates-palisades-eaton/" target="_blank">24  people have died</a></u>, but that tally is likely to rise. California Governor Gavin Newsom said Sunday that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2025/01/12/los-angeles-fires-california-updates-palisades-eaton/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>he expects “a lot more” deaths</u></a> will be added to the total in the coming days as search efforts continue.</p><h3>Why has it been so challenging to put out these fires?</h3><br/><p>
	Incoming President Donald Trump slammed the response to the L.A. fires in <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113813952733064849" target="_blank"><u>a Truth Social post</u></a> on Sunday morning: “This is one of the worst catastrophes in the history of our Country,” he wrote. “They just can’t put out the fires. What’s wrong with them?”
</p><p>
	Though <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/los-angeles-fires-wind-forecast" target="_self"><u>there is much blame</u></a> going around — <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/los-angeles-fires-misinformation" target="_self"><u>not all of it founded in reality</u></a> — the challenges facing firefighters are immense. Last week, because of strong Santa Ana winds, fire crews could not drop suppressants like water or chemical retardant on the initial blazes. (In strong winds, water and retardant <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/video/news/video-3349461/Challenging-conditions-crews-wind-takes-fire-retardant-drop.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>will blow away</u></a> before they reach the flames on the ground.)
</p><p>
	Fighting a fire in an urban or suburban area <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/los-angeles-fires-water" target="_self"><u>is also different</u></a> from fighting one in a remote, wild area. In a true wildfire, crews don’t use much water; firefighters typically contain the blazes by creating breaks — areas cleared of vegetation that starve a fire of fuel and keep it from spreading. In an urban or suburban event, however, firefighters can’t simply hack through a neighborhood, and typically have to use water to fight structure fires. Their priority also shifts from stopping the fire to evacuating and saving people, which means putting out the fire itself has to wait.
</p><p>
	What’s more, the L.A. area faced dangerous fire weather going into last week — with wind gusts up to 100 miles per hour and dry air — and the persistence of the Santa Ana winds during firefighting operations through the weekend made it extremely difficult for emergency managers to gain a foothold.
</p><h3>Is there enough water to fight the fires?</h3><br/><p>
	Trump and others have criticized Los Angeles for being unprepared for the fires, given <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/09/us/los-angeles-fire-water-hydrant-failure.html" target="_blank"><u>reports</u></a> that some fire hydrants ran dry or had low pressure during operations in Pacific Palisades. According to <a href="https://www.ladwpnews.com/pacific-palisades-fire-correcting-misinformation-about-ladwps-water-system/" target="_blank"><u>the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power</u></a>, about 20% of hydrants were affected, mostly at higher elevations.
</p><p>
	The problem isn’t a lack of preparation, however. It’s that the L.A. wildfires are so large and widespread, the county’s preparations were quickly overwhelmed. “We’re fighting a wildfire with urban water systems, and that is really challenging,” Los Angeles Department of Water and Power CEO Janisse Quiñones said in a news conference last week. When houses burn down, water mains can break open. Civilians also put a strain on the system when they use hoses or sprinkler systems to try to protect their homes.
</p><p>
	On Sunday, Judy Chu, the Democratic lawmaker representing Altadena, confirmed that fire officials had told her there was <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/judy-chu-eaton-fire-altadena-response/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>enough water</u></a> to continue the battle in the days ahead. “I believe that we're in a good place right now,” she told reporters. Newsom, meanwhile, has responded to criticism over the water failure by <a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2025-01-10/newsom-water-fires-investigation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ordering an investigation</u></a> into the weak or dry hydrants.
</p><p>
 So-called “super soaker” planes have had no problem with water access; they’re scooping <a href="https://www.foxla.com/video/1572766" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>directly from the ocean</u></a>.
</p><h3>Have aerial firefighting operations resumed?</h3><br/><p>Yes. Although aerial support was grounded in the early stages of the wildfires due to severe Santa Ana winds, flights resumed during lulls in the storms last week.</p>
<p>There is a misconception, though, that water and retardant drops “put out” fires; they don’t. Instead, aerial support suppresses a fire so crews can get in close and use traditional methods, like cutting a fire break or spraying water. “All that up in the air, all that’s doing is allowing the firefighters [on the ground] a chance to get in,” Bobbie Scopa, a veteran firefighter and author of the memoir <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/95482/9781641608060" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>Both Sides of the Fire Line</em></em></u></a>, told me last week.</p>
<p>With winds expected to pick up early this week, aerial firefighting operations may be grounded again. “If you have erratic, unpredictable winds to where you’ve got a gust spread of like 20 to 30 knots,” i.e. 23 to 35 miles per hour, “that becomes dangerous,” Dan Reese, a veteran firefighter and the founder and president of the International Wildfire Consulting Group, told me on Friday.</p><h3>Should I be worried about the smoke?</h3><br/><p>
	Because of the direction of the Santa Ana winds, wildfire smoke should mostly blow out to sea. But as winds shift, unhealthy air can blow into populated areas, <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/los-angeles-fires-smoke" target="_self"><u>affecting the health of residents</u></a>.
</p><p>
	Wildfire smoke is unhealthy, period, but urban and suburban smoke like that from the L.A. fires can be particularly detrimental. It’s not just trees and brush immolating in an urban fire, it’s also cars, and batteries, and gas tanks, and plastics, and insulation, and other nasty, chemical-filled things catching fire and sending fumes into the air. PM2.5, the inhalable particulates from wildfire smoke, contributes to <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/wildfire-smoke-mortality" target="_self"><u>thousands of excess deaths annually in the U.S.</u></a>
</p><p>

</p><h3>When will it rain?</h3><br/><p>“The bad news is, I’m not seeing any rain chances,” Drewitz, the Forest Service meteorologist, told me on Sunday. Though the marine layer will bring wetter air to the Los Angeles area on Friday, his models showed it’ll be unlikely to form precipitation.</p><p><span></span>Though some forecasters have signaled potential rain <a href="https://www.desertsun.com/story/news/nation/california/2025/01/11/santa-ana-winds-fires-in-la-ventura-county-weather/77635046007/#:~:text=NWS%20Los%20Angeles%20also%20predicts%20a%2020%25%20chance%20of%20light%20rain%20during%20the%20weekend." target="_blank"><u>at the end of next week</u></a>, the general consensus is that the odds for that are low, and that any rain there may be will be <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-01-12/increasing-winds-bring-new-fire-dangers-across-l-a-county-this-week" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>too light or short-lived</u></a> to contribute meaningfully to extinguishing the fires.</p><h3>What is the relationship between the L.A. fires and climate change?</h3><br/><p>The chaparral shrublands around Los Angeles are supposed to <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/los-angeles-controlled-burns" target="_self"><u>burn every 30 to 130 years</u></a>. “There are high concentrations of terpenes — very flammable oils — in that vegetation; it’s made to burn,” Scopa, the veteran firefighter, told me.</p><p>What <em><em>isn’t</em></em> normal, though, is the amount of rain Los Angeles got ahead of this past spring — 52.46 inches in the preceding two years, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-04-01/another-wet-winter-set-record-water-year-second-in-history" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the wettest period in the city’s history</u></a> since the late 1800s — which was followed by a blisteringly hot summer and a delayed start to this year’s rainy season. Since October, parts of Southern California have <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/weather/article/drought-water-fire-california-20011706.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>received just 10% of their normal rainfall</u></a></p><p>This “weather whiplash” is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2025/01/09/california-fires-wet-dry-weather-conditions/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>caused by a warmer atmosphere</u></a>, which means that plants will grow explosively due to the influx of rain and then dry out when the drought returns, leaving lots of dry fuels ready and waiting for a spark. “This is really, I would argue, a signature of climate change that is going to be experienced almost everywhere people actually live on Earth,” Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who authored a new study on the pattern, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2025/01/09/california-fires-wet-dry-weather-conditions/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>told </u><u><em><em>The Washington Post</em></em></u></a>.</p><p>We know less about how climate change may affect the Santa Anas, though <a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/santa-ana-winds-climate-change?rebelltitem=2#rebelltitem2" target="_self"><u>experts have some theories</u></a>.</p><h3>What does this mean for L.A.’s housing crisis?</h3><br/><p><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/california-windstorm-fuels-pacific-palisades-wildfire-as-residents-flee-live-updates/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>At least 12,000 structures</u></a> have burned so far in the fires, which is already exacerbating the strain on the Los Angeles housing market — one of the country’s tightest even before the fires — as thousands of displaced people look for new places to live. “Dozens and dozens of people are going after the same properties,” one real estate agent <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-01-11/their-houses-burned-down-now-they-are-fighting-for-the-few-homes-left-on-the-market" target="_blank"><u>told the </u><u><em><em>Los Angeles Times</em></em></u></a>.

	The wildfires may “deal a devastating blow to [California’s] fragile home insurance market,” Heatmap’s Matthew Zeitlin <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/los-angeles-fire-insurance-fair" target="_self"><u>wrote last week</u></a>. In recent years, home insurers have left California or declined to write new policies, at least partially due to the increased risk of wildfires in the state.
</p><p>
Depending on the extent of the damage from the fires, the coffers of California’s FAIR Plan — which insures homeowners who can’t get insurance otherwise, including many in Pacific Palisades and Altadena — could empty, causing it to seek money from insurers, according to the state’s regulations. As Zeitlin writes, “This would mean that Californians who <em><em>were</em></em> able to buy private insurance — because they don’t live in a region of the state that insurers have abandoned — could be on the hook for massive wildfire losses.”
</p><h3>What’s the best way to keep up with evacuation orders?</h3><br/><p>
	First and foremost, <a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/how-to-protect-home-from-wildfire#:~:text=2.%20Sign%20up%20for%20emergency%20alerts%20(10%20minutes)" target="_self"><u>sign up for all relevant emergency alerts</u></a>. Make sure to turn on the sound on your phone and keep it near you in case of a change in conditions.

Read <a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/wildfire-evacuation-guide" target="_self"><u>our guide</u></a> on what to do if you get a pre-evacuation or an evacuation notice <em><em>ahead of time</em></em> so that you’re not scrambling for information if you get an alert.
</p><p>
<a href="https://www.watchduty.org/" target="_blank"><u>The free Watch Duty app</u></a> has become a go-to resource for people affected by the fires, including friends and family of Angelenos who may themselves be thousands of miles away. The app provides information on fire perimeters, evacuation notices, and power outages. Its employees pull <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/11/us/watch-duty-wildfire-app.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>information directly from emergency responders’ radio broadcasts</u></a> and sometimes beat official sources to disseminating it.

</p><h3>How can I help?</h3><br/><p>
	There are many scams in the wake of disasters as crooks look to take advantage of desperate people — and those who want to help them. To play it safe, you can use a hub <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/c/act/wildfire-relief/california" target="_blank"><u>like the one established by GoFundMe</u></a>, which is actively vetting campaigns related to the L.A. fires. If you’re looking to volunteer your time, make a donation of clothing or food, or if you’re able to foster animals the fire has displaced, you can use <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KMk34XY5dsvVJjAoD2mQUVHYU_Ib6COz6jcGH5uJWDY/htmlview?usp=sharing" target="_blank"><u>this handy database</u></a> from the Mutual Aid Network L.A. There are also many national organizations, such as the Red Cross, that you can connect with if you want to help.
</p><p>
The City of Los Angeles and the Los Angeles Fire Department have asked that do-gooders not bring donations directly to fire stations or shelters; such actions can interfere with emergency operations.

## US forecasters warn of 'explosive fire growth' conditions amid deadly California wildfires

date: 2025-01-13, from: VOA News USA

Firefighters in Southern California are battling Monday to bring multiple major Los Angeles area wildfires under control as forecasters warned of renewed strong winds that could cause “explosive fire growth.”


The new wind threat, with the biggest concern extending from late Monday through Wednesday morning, is expected to bring sustained winds of 80 kph and gusts up to about 110 kph, the National Weather Service warned.


Forecasters called it a “particularly dangerous situation” and designated it as a red flag warning.


Strong winds and dry conditions in an area that has not received significant rainfall for more than eight months helped fuel the fires that have already killed at least 24 people and caused billions of dollars in damage since they began a week ago.




A brief reprieve in the winds in recent days allowed firefighters aided by air drops of water and fire retardant to make some progress in bringing the blazes under control.


Of the three major fires still burning in the Los Angeles area, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire, said Monday the Palisades Fire was 14% contained and has burned 96 square kilometers.


Eight of the deaths were attributed to the Palisades Fire in the Pacific Palisades area, officials said.


Sixteen deaths were from the Eaton Fire, located farther inland in North Pasadena and Altadena, which was 33% contained by Monday morning and has burned nearly 60 square kilometers.




Sixteen more people have been reported missing in the areas of the two fires, with officials warning that the number of fatalities is likely to increase.


Another blaze, the Hurst Fire in the Sylmar area, was 89% contained, Cal Fire said, after burning more than three square kilometers.


The ongoing blazes, along with other fires that have been contained, together have destroyed more than 12,000 structures.


In a statement, U.S. President Joe Biden said, “Our hearts ache for the 24 innocent souls we have lost in the wildfires across Los Angeles. Jill and I pray for them and their loved ones. We are deeply saddened by the devastation caused by the unprecedented ongoing wildfires across Southern California.”


Biden said he is being updated frequently on the fires and directed federal agencies to dispatch any help and equipment California authorities need.


“To the brave firefighters and first responders working day and night to suppress these fires and save lives: our nation is grateful,” Biden said. “You represent the best of America, and we are in your debt.”


About 100,000 people remained under evacuation orders late Sunday, with officials saying people would not be allowed back in fire risk areas while the new wind warnings were still in place.


Some schools that had canceled classes last week were resuming operations Monday. The National Basketball Association’s Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Clippers were also set to resume home games Monday after canceling games due to the fires. But a key National Football League playoff game involving the Los Angeles Rams set for Monday night was moved to the neighboring state of Arizona.




Local officials expressed fears that as the fires spread, they could endanger more highly populated areas and threaten some of the city’s key landmarks, including the J. Paul Getty Museum, which houses renowned artworks, and the University of California, Los Angeles, one of the top public U.S. universities.


California Governor Gavin Newsom told NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday that the wildfires could be the worst natural disaster in U.S. history, “in terms of just the costs associated with it, in terms of the scale and scope.”


A preliminary estimate by AccuWeather put the damage and economic losses so far between $135 billion and $150 billion. The damages are so high in part because much of the housing that has burned to the ground is among the costliest in the country.


Newsom called for an independent review of how the fires raged on, with firefighters at times facing a shortage of water to fight the blazes as they quickly spread out of control.


The governor said he is asking the same questions “that people out on the streets are asking, yelling about, ‘What the hell happened? What happened to the water system?’”


Newsom said he wants to know whether the water supply was simply overwhelmed, “Or were 99 mile-an-hour winds [160 kph] determinative and there was really no firefight that could've been more meaningful?”


The U.S. Defense Department said more than 1,800 California National Guard personnel have been activated to assist with the firefighting efforts and aircraft deployed to drop water and fire retardants over the raging fires.

## Here's what happened when previous US presidents tried to downsize government

date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA

President-elect Donald Trump pledges to reduce government spending when he takes office. He has tasked billionaire businessman Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who's worth an estimated $950 million, to lead the Department of Government Efficiency, a proposed presidential advisory commission. It's not a new concept. U.S. leaders have tried to reduce the role of government since the founding of the republic.

## Philadelphia 76ers won't build disputed $1.3B downtown stadium

date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA

Philadelphia, Pennsylvania — The Philadelphia 76ers have decided not to build a $1.3 billion downtown arena, a surprising move that comes just weeks after the team received approval for the controversial project from the city council.


The Philadelphia Inquirer reported Sunday that multiple council members had confirmed the change in plans. The team has struck a deal with Comcast Spectacor to remain in the city's sports stadium district, the newspaper said, but further details about the new proposal have not been released.


The 76ers, the mayor's office and Comcast Spectacor — which owns the Wells Fargo Center, where the team currently plays — did not respond Sunday to requests for comment. The team rents the arena from Comcast Spectacor, which also owns the Philadelphia Flyers of the NHL, who also play there.


The council had voted on Dec. 19 to approve the downtown arena after more than two years of heated debate over the proposal, and the owners of the NBA team had hoped to move into what would be called 76 Place by 2031. The council vote came despite vocal opposition from nearby Chinatown residents and other activists.


“I’m so livid right now I don’t even know what to do,” Jimmy Harrity, an at-large member of the council, told the newspaper. Harrity, who supported the team’s move, said, “I feel as though I was used as a pawn.”


Mayor Cherelle Parker, a Democrat who had championed the plan, has said the entire city will benefit from what she called a “historic game-changing economic development project.” Supporters had hoped the 18,500-seat arena would help revive a distressed retail corridor called Market East, which runs from City Hall to the Liberty Bell. The area has struggled for years despite several redevelopment efforts.


The team owners, Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment, had pushed for city approval by year’s end so they could meet their target opening date. They had vowed not to ask the city for any construction funding, although they were free to seek state and federal funds. Instead of property taxes, they would have paid about $6 million in annual payments in lieu of taxes.


Opponents feared the arena would bring gridlock on game days as well as gentrification and rising rents to the area.


The Chinatown community has fought a series of proposed developments since the 1960s, including casinos, a prison, a baseball stadium and a highway, the last of which dissected the neighborhood when it opened in 1991.

## Los Angeles wildfires rage on despite added firefighting resources

## Fires burn Los Angeles schools, destroy outdoor education sanctuaries

date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA

For Irina Contreras, a program manager for Los Angeles County's Department of Arts and Culture, outdoor education was a refuge for both her and her daughter during the pandemic.


Now, much of that refuge has been burned in the raging wildfires around Los Angeles.


Her 7-year-old daughter, Ceiba, hikes with a kid's adventure group called Hawks and attended Matilija, a bilingual forest school for preschool and kindergarten. Rain or shine, she and her friends would spend their days climbing, jumping, hiking, and swimming in places like Eaton Canyon Nature Area, a 77-hectare (190-acre) preserve near Altadena, now destroyed by fire.


Ceiba learned to ask plants for permission before taking samples to glue into her nature journal. Once, her group discovered a hidden path that led behind a waterfall. Ceiba couldn't stop talking about it for days.


For parents like Contreras, the wildfires have been devastating not just because of the loss of life and thousands of homes. They are mourning natural and educational areas that served as sanctuaries and learning spaces for local families, especially in the years since the pandemic. The fires have torn through natural areas that served every type of educational setting: public and private schools, nature-based preschools, homeschool groups, summer camps and more.


"It's about so much more than what she's been learning," Contreras said. "I can speak with absolute confidence that it totally affected me, personally."


The fires have burned school buildings, too, including Odyssey Charter School in Altadena, which Miguel Ordenana's children attend.


"The community has been devastated by the fire," said Ordenana, senior manager of community science at the Natural History Museum. "It's been a challenge to carefully share that news with my children and help them work through their emotions. A lot of their friends lost their homes. And we don't know the impact to school staff, like their teachers, but a lot of them live in that area as well and have lost their homes."


Some areas untouched by fire were inaccessible because of poor air quality. Griffith Park, home of the Hollywood sign, had not been affected by the end of the week but it's not clear when the air quality there will be good enough to resume outdoor programs, said Ordenana, who was the first to capture on camera a late puma in the nearby area that gained fame under the name P-22.


Ordenana said his family was able to connect with some other families from Odyssey Charter School for pizza and an indoor playdate, but he is uncertain what the days will look like for them with school closures already extending through next week.


All schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District, the nation's second largest, were closed Friday because of heavy smoke and ash over the city. Classes will not resume until conditions improve, officials said. Pasadena Unified School District also closed schools and several of its campuses sustained damage, including Eliot Arts Magnet Middle School.


The California Department of Education released a statement Wednesday saying 335 schools from Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Riverside, Ventura, and San Diego counties were closed. It was unclear how many would be closed Monday.


During the pandemic, Contreras felt like she was stuck on a screen. She devoted much of her energy to working, writing and organizing, but her daughter's outdoor education helped her better understand the value of stepping away from the grind.


Contreras feels confident the outdoor programs will return, although it's unclear when it will be safe for people to hike around areas like Eaton Canyon.


"The nature center is gone," Richard Smart, superintendent of the Eaton Canyon Natural Area in Pasadena, said Thursday. "The wildflowers, the shrubs are gone." The park hosted dozens of school field trips a year and Smart estimates more than a thousand students visited yearly.


"Teachers liked it because it was also free, it was local, it was nearby. And it was a place to see nature — wild nature but also in a friendly, safe environment," he said.


Only a few exterior walls of the Eaton Canyon Nature Center were left standing, he said.


"For many of the local school districts, we truly were in their backyard, and now they won't be able to use it for the foreseeable future," he said. "The park is such a touchstone for people in the community, and so to lose that is just, devastating is not even the right word. It feels indescribable."


Many parents and teachers are likely wondering what to do and where to take their children as fires continue to burn across Los Angeles, said Lila Higgins, a senior manager for community science at the Natural History Museum and author of "Wild L.A," a field trip and nature guidebook.


A certified forest therapy guide, Higgins says time in nature lowers heart rates, lowers blood pressure and helps children with attention deficit disorder feel more calm and relaxed.


"For children's cognitive development, time in nature and time spent connecting with nature is so important," Higgins said. Outdoor spaces also can help children learn how to develop relationships through connections with animals, understand orientation through space by following trails and map-reading and understand human impact on wildlife.


"A lot of the places that we're talking about are really popular with homeschoolers, but they also are a destination for some field trips, certainly places like Eaton Canyon," said Greg Pauly, co-author of "Wild L.A." and director of the Urban Nature Research Center at the museum. "I do think it's safe to say that people are going to continue to be interacting with those landscapes and it will hopefully still be a field trip destination in the future. But it's certainly going to be a while before that happens."


"This is the reality of modern Southern California," he said. "Fire changes the landscape and people's lives shockingly often."

## California wildfires could be leaving deeper inequality in their wake

date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA

ALTADENA, Calif. — The sight of celebrity mansions and movie landmarks reduced to ashes can make it seem like the wildfires roaring through the Los Angeles area affected a constellation of movie stars. 


But a drive through the charred neighborhoods around Altadena shows that the fires also burned through a remarkable haven for generations of Black families avoiding discriminatory housing practices elsewhere. They have been communities of racial and economic diversity, where many people own their own homes. 


Some now fear the most destructive fires in California's history have altered that for good. Recovery and rebuilding may be out of reach for many, and pressures of gentrification could be renewed. 




Samantha Santoro, 22, a first-generation college student at Cal Poly Pomona, remembered being annoyed when the initial news coverage of the wildfires focused more on celebrities. She and her sister, who attends UC Berkeley, worry how their Mexican immigrant parents and working-class neighbors who lost their homes in Altadena will move forward. 


"We don't have like, 'Oh, I'll just go to my second home and stay there,'" Santoro said. 


The landlord of their family's two-bedroom house with a pool had never increased the $1,650 rent, making it possible for the Santoros to affordably raise their daughters. Now, they're temporarily staying with a relative in Pasadena. The family has renters insurance but not much else. 


"I think it's hard to believe that you have nothing," Santoro said, through tears, thinking of her parents. "Everything that they ever worked for was in that house." 


Altadena had been a mix of tiny bungalows and magnificent mansions. The community of 42,000 includes blue-collar families, artists, entertainment industry workers and white-collar ones. About 58% of residents are non-white, with one-fourth of them Hispanic and nearly a fifth Black, according to Census data. 




During the Civil Rights era, Altadena became a rare land of opportunity for Black Americans to reach middle class without the discriminatory practices of denying them access to credit. They kept homes within the family and helped others to flourish. Today, the Black home ownership rate there is at 81.5%, almost double the national rate. 


That's impressive considering 92% of the 15,000 residences in Altadena are single-family homes, according to the 2023 Census American Community Survey. The median income is over $129,000. Just over 7% of residents live in poverty. 


Victoria Knapp, chair of the Altadena Town Council, worries that the fires have irreparably changed the landscape for these families. 


"Someone is going to buy it and develop who knows what on it. And that is going to change the character of Altadena," Knapp said, adding that those with fewer resources will be disproportionately hurt. 


The family of Kenneth Snowden, 57, was one of the Black families able to purchase a home in 1962. That house, as well as the one Snowden bought almost 20 years ago, are both gone. 


He is challenging state and federal officials to help all fire-affected communities fairly because "your $40 million home is no different than my $2 million home." 


Snowden wants the ability to acquire home loans with 0% interest. "Give us the ability to rebuild, restart our lives," he said. "If you can spend billions of dollars fighting a war, you can spend a billion dollars to help us get back where we were at." 


Shawn Brown lost not only her home but also the public charter school she founded in Altadena. She had a message for fellow Black homeowners who might be tempted with offers for their property: "I would tell them to stand strong, rebuild, continue the generational progress of African Americans." 


She and other staff at Pasadena Rosebud Academy are trying to raise money to rebuild while looking at temporary sites in churches. 




But even some churches have burned. At Altadena Baptist Church, the bell tower is pretty much the only thing still standing. 


The Rev. George Van Alstine and others are trying to help more than 10 church members who lost homes with needs like navigating insurance and federal aid. The pastor is worried the fires will lead to gentrification, with Black parishioners, who make up half the congregation, paying the price. 


"We're seeing a number of families who are probably going to have to move out of the area because rebuilding in Altadena will be too expensive for them," he said. 


The 32-year-old photographer Daniela Dawson, who had been working two jobs to meet the $2,200 rent for her studio apartment, fled the wildfires with her Hyundai SUV and her cat, Lola. She lost almost everything else, including thousands of dollars of photography gear. 


She did not have renter's insurance. "Obviously now I'm thinking about it. Wish I had it," she said. 


Dawson plans to return to Arizona, where she lived previously, and regroup. But she likely won't be returning to Altadena.

## 'Den of Thieves 2' is No. 1 at box office as 'Better Man' flops

date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA

New York — On a quiet weekend in movie theaters, while much of Hollywood’s attention was on the wildfires that continue to rage in Los Angeles, Lionsgate’s “Den of Thieves 2: Pantera” debuted atop the box office with $15.5 million, according to studio estimates Sunday.


Mid-January is often a slow moviegoing period, and that was slightly exacerbated by the closures of about 10 theaters in Los Angeles, the country’s top box-office market.


A sequel to the Gerard Butler 2018 heist thriller, “Den of Thieves 2” performed similarly to the original. The first installment, released by STX, opened with $15.2 million seven years ago. O’Shea Jackson Jr. co-stars in the sequel, which debuted in 3,008 North American theaters.


Butler's films are becoming something of a regular feature in January. He also starred in “Plane,” which managed $32.1 million after launching on Jan. 13 in 2023.


“Den of Thieves 2,” made for about $40 million, was a bit more costly to make. Audiences liked it well enough, giving it a “B+” CinemaScore. Reviews (58% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) weren’t particularly good. But it counted as Lionsgate’s first No.1 opening since “The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes” in November 2023.


Also entering wide release over the weekend was the Robbie Williams movie “Better Man,” one of the more audacious spins on the music biopic in recent years. Rather than going the more tradition routes of Elton John (“Rocketman”) or Elvis Presley (“Elvis”), the British popstar is portrayed by a CGI chimpanzee in Michael Gracey’s film.


The Paramount Pictures release, produced for $110 million and acquired by Paramount for $25 million, didn’t catch on much better than Williams’ previous forays into the United States. It tanked, with $1.1 million in ticket sales from 1,291 locations. Gracey’s previous feature, 2017’s “The Greatest Showman” ($459 million worldwide), fared far better in theaters. Reviews, however, have been very good for “Better Man.”


It was bested by “The Last Showgirl,” the Las Vegas drama starring Pamela Anderson. The Roadside Attractions release expanded to 870 theaters and collected $1.5 million.


Also outdoing “Better Man” was Brady Corbet’s “The Brutalist.” Coming off winning best drama at the Golden Globes, the A24 postwar epic grossed a hefty $1.4 million from just 68 locations. It will expand wider in the coming weeks.


The weekend's lion share of business went to holiday holdovers, including “Mufasa: The Lion King,” “Sonic the Hedgehog 3,” “Nosferatu” and “Moana 2.”


In its fourth week of release, Barry Jenkins “Mufasa” continued to do well, adding $13.2 million to bring its total to $539.7 million worldwide. Also on its fourth weekend, “Sonic the Hedgehog 3” padded its $384.8 million global total with $11 million. Robert Eggers’ “Nosferatu,” the surprise hit of the Christmas period, collected $6.8 million in ticket sales, bringing the vampire tale to $81.1 million domestically.


The Walt Disney Co.’s “Moana 2,” in its seventh week of release, added $6.5 million to bring its global tally to $989.8 million. In the coming days, it will become the third Disney film released in 2024 to notch $1 billion, joining “Inside Out 2” and “Deadpool and Wolverine.”


Final domestic figures will be released Monday. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore:


1. “Den of Thieves 2: Pantera,” $15.5 million.


2. “Mufasa: The Lion King,” $13.2 million.


3. “Sonic the Hedgehog 3,” $11 million.


4. “Nosferatu,” $6.8 million.


5. “Moana 2,” $6.5 million.


6. “A Complete Unknown,” $5 million.


7. “Wicked,” $5 million.


8. “Babygirl,” $3.1 million.


9. “Game Changer,” $1.9 million.


10. “The Last Showgirl,” $1.5 million.

## Vance: Jan. 6 participants who committed violence 'obviously' shouldn't be pardoned

date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Vice President-elect JD Vance says people responsible for the violence during the Capitol riot "obviously" should not be pardoned, as President-elect Donald Trump is promising to use his clemency power on behalf of many of those who tried on Jan. 6, 2021, to overturn the results of the election that Trump lost. 


Vance insisted in an interview on "Fox News Sunday" that the pardon question is "very simple," saying those who "protested peacefully" should be pardoned and "if you committed violence on that day, obviously you shouldn't be pardoned." He later said there was a "bit of a gray area" in some cases. 


More than 1,500 people have been charged with federal crimes stemming from the siege that left more than 100 police officers injured and sent lawmakers running into hiding as they met to certify Democrat Joe Biden's 2020 victory. 


Hundreds of people who did not engage in destruction or violence were charged only with misdemeanor offenses for illegally entering the Capitol. Others were charged with felony offenses, including assault for beating police officers.


Leaders of the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys extremist groups were convicted of seditious conspiracy for what prosecutors described as plots to use violence to stop the peaceful transfer of power from Trump, the Republican incumbent, to Biden. 


In a post on X, Vance responded to criticism from supporters of the Capitol rioters that his position did not go far enough to free all convicted. "I've been defending these guys for years," he said. 


"The president saying he'll look at each case (and me saying the same) is not some walkback," Vance said. "I assure you, we care about people unjustly locked up. Yes, that includes people provoked and it includes people who got a garbage trial."

## Los Angeles fires death toll rises to at least 24

date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA

The death toll in the wildfires that are raging in the Los Angeles area rose to at least 24 late Sunday, with officials worried that more bodies will be found by searchers and cadaver dogs in the neighborhoods that have been leveled by the blazes. 


Roaring flames continued to ravage the West Coast state of California as the top U.S. emergency official warned that increasing winds could pose new threats in the coming days.


“The winds are potentially getting stronger and dangerous,” Deanne Criswell, the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, told CNN’s “State of the Union” show. “You never know which way they’re going.”


Local officials expressed fears that as the fires spread, they could endanger more highly populated areas and threaten some of the city’s key landmarks, including the J. Paul Getty Museum, which houses renowned art works, and the University of California, Los Angeles, one of the top public U.S. universities.

 




California Senator Adam Schiff told CNN that driving through the devastated communities “frankly reminded me of visiting war zones. There are whole neighborhoods that are gone. We haven’t seen this before.”


“The heartbreak is just overwhelming,” he said. 


California Governor Gavin Newsom told NBC’s “Meet the Press” that the wildfires could be the worst natural disaster in U.S. history, “in terms of just the costs associated with it, in terms of the scale and scope.” 


A preliminary estimate by AccuWeather put the damage and economic losses so far between $135 billion and $150 billion. The damages are so high in part because much of the housing that has burned to the ground is among the costliest in the country. 


Watch related report by Veronica Balderas Iglesias:




Newsom called for an independent review of how the fires raged on, with firefighters at times facing a shortage of water to fight the blazes as they quickly spread out of control.


The governor said he is asking the same questions “that people out on the streets are asking, yelling about, ‘What the hell happened? What happened to the water system?’

Newsom said he wants to know whether the water supply was simply overwhelmed, “Or were 99 mile-an-hour winds determinative and there was really no firefight that could've been more meaningful?”


“All of us want to know those answers, and I just don't want to wait because people are asking me. I want to know those facts,” he said. “I want them objectively determined, and let the chips fall where they may. This is not about finger pointing.”




The governor said he is asking the same questions “that people out on the streets are asking, yelling about, ‘What the hell happened? What happened to the water system?’


Newsom on Friday ordered state officials to determine why a 440-million-liter reservoir was out of service and some hydrants had run dry.


Firefighters raced Saturday to get in front of the largest and most destructive blaze burning in Los Angeles as it shifted directions and grew by about 400 hectares. The Santa Ana winds that fueled the blazes are forecast to return. 


“We need to be aggressive out there,” California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) Operations Chief Christian Litz told reporters at a Saturday briefing. 




The National Weather Service predicted winds picking up Saturday night into Sunday morning in the area and again late Monday through Tuesday morning, with sustained winds up to 48 kph and gusts up to 112 kph.


Four active fires in the Los Angeles region have burned more than 16,000 hectares, with flames destroying more than 12,000 structures. About 150,000 people have been ordered to evacuate their homes, with 700 people taking refuge in nine shelters. The causes of all four blazes remain under investigation.




Officials said two of the fires were 90- and 76% contained but the other two only 11- and 15%. The Palisades fire, the largest and only 11% contained, is threatening to jump over a major highway, Interstate 405, into a more heavily populated area.


Jim Hudson, a Cal Fire incident commander, told reporters that firefighters have three priorities: “Life, your property and permanent control” of the flames.


Firefighting crews from California and nine other states are part of the ongoing response that includes 1,354 fire engines, 84 aircraft and more than 14,000 personnel, including newly arrived firefighters from Mexico.


Some information for this report came from The Associated Press.

## Court ruling will help New Mexico stay a go-to state for women seeking abortions

date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA

SANTA FE, NEW MEXICO — The New Mexico Supreme Court on Thursday struck down abortion restrictions by conservative cities and counties, helping to ensure the state remains a go-to destination for people from other states with bans.


The unanimous opinion, in response to a request from state Attorney General Raúl Torrez, reinforces the state's position as having some of the most liberal abortion laws in the country.


Attorneys representing the cities of Hobbs and Clovis and Lea and Roosevelt counties had argued that provisions of a federal "anti-vice" law known as the Comstock Act block courts from striking down local abortion ordinances.


But Justice C. Shannon Bacon, writing for the majority opinion, said state law precludes cities and counties from restricting abortion or regulating abortion clinics.


"The ordinances violate this core precept and invade the Legislature's authority to regulate access to and provision of reproductive healthcare," she wrote. "We hold the ordinances are preempted in their entirety."


New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez praised the court's ruling Thursday, saying that the core of the argument was that state laws preempted any action by local governments to engage in activities that would infringe on the constitutional rights of citizens.


"The bottom line is simply this: Abortion access is safe and secure in New Mexico," he said. "It's enshrined in law by the recent ruling by the New Mexico Supreme Court and thanks to the work of the New Mexico Legislature."




New Mexico House Speaker Javier Martínez called access to health care a basic fundamental right in New Mexico.


"It doesn't take a genius to understand the statutory framework that we have. Local governments don't regulate health care in New Mexico. It is up to the state," the Albuquerque Democrat said.


Opposition to abortion runs deep in New Mexico communities along the border with Texas, which has one of the most restrictive bans in the U.S.


But Democrats, who control every statewide elected office in New Mexico and hold majorities in the state House and Senate, have moved to shore up access to abortion — before and after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, eliminating the nationwide right to abortion.


In 2021, the New Mexico Legislature repealed a dormant 1969 statute that outlawed most abortion procedures as felonies, ensuring access to abortion even after the Roe v. Wade reversal.


And in 2023, Democratic New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed a bill that overrides local ordinances aimed at limiting abortion access and enacted a shield law that protects abortion providers from investigations by other states.


In September, construction began on a state-funded reproductive health and abortion clinic in southern New Mexico that will cater to local residents and people who travel from neighboring states.


The new clinic is scheduled for completion by early 2026 to provide services ranging from medical and procedural abortions to contraception, cervical cancer screenings and education about adoptions.


In Thursday's opinion, justices said they "strongly admonish" Roosevelt County, in particular, for an ordinance that would have allowed individuals to file lawsuits demanding damages of more than $100,000 for violations of the county's abortion ordinance.


The provision would have created "a private right of action and damages award that is clearly intended to punish protected conduct," the court said in its opinion.


Erin Hawley, a vice president at Alliance Defending Freedom, an Arizona-based Christian legal advocacy group, is an attorney who argued on behalf of Roosevelt County in the case. On Thursday, she criticized the court's decision and emphasized its limitations.


"Roosevelt County and other New Mexico localities should be able to enforce ordinances that comply with federal law and protect the lives of their citizens," said Hawley, the wife of U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri. "We're grateful that the New Mexico Supreme Court did not abandon common sense and find a so-called right to abortion in the state constitution."


It was not immediately clear whether the ruling can be appealed in federal court or influence broader efforts to apply Comstock Act restrictions on abortion. The New Mexico Supreme Court opinion explicitly declined to address conflicts with federal law, basing its decision solely on state provisions.


Austin, Texas-based attorney Jonathan Mitchell, a former Texas solicitor general and architect of that state's strict abortion ban, said he looked forward "to litigating these issues in other states and bringing the meaning of the federal Comstock Act to the Supreme Court of the United States."

## Scarves over headscarves, Muslim women's outdoors group tackles snow tubing in Minnesota

date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA

MAPLE GROVE, Minnesota — Ice crystals clung to the eyelashes, parka hood, beanie hat and headscarf of Ruqayah Nasser as she took a break after her first-ever snow tubing runs in a Minnesota park on a -18 Celsius January morning.


She had joined two dozen other members of a group founded by a Somali-American mother in Minneapolis to promote all-seasons activities among Muslim women, who might otherwise feel singled out in the great outdoors, especially when wearing hijabs.


"They understand my lifestyle. I don't have to explain myself," said Nasser, who recently moved to the Twin Cities from Chicago and whose family hails from Yemen. "My religion is everything. It's my survival kit."


As one of the most visible signs of the Muslim faith, hijabs often attract controversy. Within Islam, some women want to wear the headscarves for piety and modesty, while others oppose them as a symbol of oppression. In the sports world, including in the last Olympics, devout athletes have often faced extra hurdles on and off the field in finding accommodations for religious practices.


Concerned about safety as a woman — particularly one wearing a head covering — but determined to get outdoors to beat seasonal depression, Nasrieen Habib put out a social media post about creating a hiking group three years ago.


From the nine women who responded, her Amanah Rec Project has grown to more than 700 members. There's a core group for Muslim women only — for "more sisterhood and modesty," Habib says — as well as a group for families. In addition to weekly outings, they organize longer trips and education on everything from appropriate winter clothing — a challenge for many migrant communities — to health and environmental sustainability from the perspective of Islam.


"It's a way to live your whole life according to a set of beliefs and rules. And part of those beliefs and rules is taking care of creation," Habib said as her 4-year-old son took a break from tubing in a toasty chalet at Elm Creek Park Reserve near Minneapolis. "How can we be more sustainable in a time where we see the impact of climate change, especially impacting people who look like us in the Global South?"




Two sisters, Ruun Mahamud and Nawal Hirsi, moved to the United States from Somalia as children about two decades ago.


They found a safe haven in Minnesota where, since the late 1990s, growing numbers of East African refugees have created an increasingly vocal Muslim community. Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar was the first lawmaker to wear a hijab while on the U.S. House floor, and Minneapolis was the first large city in the United States to allow the Islamic call to prayer to be broadcast publicly by its two dozen mosques.


Even though she feels "safe and accepted" in her hijab, Hirsi joined the group for extra support.


"I love being outdoors and joining this group has made me more comfortable to participate," she said on the tubing hill, where she had convinced Mahamud to come along for the first time.


"Oh my gosh, it's the most amazing thing I've ever done," Mahamud gushed after speeding downhill on a tube attached to her sister's as their daughters recorded the adventure on their phones.


The sisters said it's important to include love for the outdoors and physical activity in their children's religious upbringing.


"Taking care of one's health is part of our faith," Hirsi said.


Muslim women who wear hijabs can face multiple barriers to sports participation, said Umer Hussain, a Wilkes University professor who studies religion and sports. They range from activities where genders mix or head coverings pose logistical hurdles to conservative families who might frown on it.


Groups like Habib's tackle empowering women in their communities as well as raising awareness about religious accommodations like single-sex spaces or locations for prayer.


"The biggest barrier, for women specifically, is having access to spaces that allow us to practice our religion while keeping our modesty and abiding by the Islamic laws that tell us we are not supposed to be in mixed spaces without covering up," Habib said.


She appears to have tapped into a great demand.


"When she told me she was going to start a hiking group to get sisters out in nature … it was like actually something I've been looking for for a very long time," Makiya Amin said as she climbed up the tubing hill in a long white skirt, bright-red headscarf, and heavy winter coat. "I didn't really have those type of people who were outdoorsy already around me."


Isho Mohamed joined the group for the wide-ranging conversations as much as for the outdoors, which as a self-described "homebody" she had largely avoided since college days.


"It's a safe space that takes me out of my comfort zone," she said of the group outings. During them, the women share about work experiences but also life as immigrants and, most importantly, their faith.


"We also talk about spiritual connection and connecting with God as well, and just say a little prayer here and there when we're walking," Mohamed added.


Her cheeks glowing above her ski mask after two hours on the hill, Jorida Latifi was with her 7-year-old son among the last to hang up their snow tubes. Originally from Albania, Latifi has gone out with the group almost weekly since joining more than a year ago.


"With Muslim sisters … they do understand you, what you go through, even with the clothing and hijabs," Latifi said. "It feels way, way more like, you know, where you are with family."

## Biden honors Pope Francis with the Presidential Medal of Freedom

date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden on Saturday honored Pope Francis with the Presidential Medal of Freedom with distinction, the highest civilian award given by the president, saying the pontiff was "a light of faith, hope, and love that shines brightly across the world."


Biden had been scheduled to present the medal to the pope in person on Saturday in Rome on what was to be the final overseas trip of his presidency, but Biden canceled his travel plans so he could monitor the wildfires in California.


The White House said Biden bestowed the award to the pope during a phone call in which they also discussed efforts to promote peace and alleviate suffering around the world.


It's the only time Biden has presented the honor with distinction during his presidency. Biden himself is a recipient of the award with distinction, recognized when he was vice president by then-President Barack Obama in a surprise ceremony eight years ago. That was the only time in Obama's two terms that he awarded that version of the medal.


The citation for the pope says "his mission of serving the poor has never ceased. A loving pastor, he joyfully answers children's questions about God. A challenging teacher, he commands us to fight for peace and protect the planet. A welcoming leader, he reaches out to different faiths."


Biden is preparing to leave office Jan. 20 and has doled out honors to prominent individuals, including supporters and allies, in recent weeks.

## Blue Origin set for 1st launch of New Glenn rocket

date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA

CAPE CANAVERAL — A quarter of a century after its founding, Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin is finally ready for its maiden orbital voyage with a brand-new rocket the company hopes will shake up the commercial space race.


The launch initially scheduled for Sunday was pushed back a day due to "unfavorable" sea conditions, Blue Origin posted on X.


Named New Glenn after legendary astronaut John Glenn — the first American to orbit Earth in 1962 — the rocket stands 320 feet (98 meters) tall, roughly equivalent to a 32-story building — and is set to blast off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in a launch window that opens at 1 a.m. (0600 GMT) Monday.


"Pointy end up!" the company's CEO, Dave Limp posted on X alongside photos of the gleaming white behemoth.


With the mission, dubbed NG-1, Bezos, the world's second-richest man, is taking direct aim at the world's wealthiest: Elon Musk, whose company SpaceX dominates the orbital launch market through its Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets.


These serve the commercial sector, the Pentagon, and NASA — including, crucially, ferrying astronauts to and from the International Space Station.


"SpaceX has for the past several years been pretty much the only game in town and so having a competitor... this is great," G. Scott Hubbard, a retired senior NASA official, told AFP.


SpaceX, meanwhile, is planning the next orbital test of Starship — its gargantuan new-generation rocket — the same day, upping the sense of high-stakes rivalry.


If all goes to plan, shortly after launch, Blue Origin will attempt to land the first-stage booster on a drone ship named Jacklyn, in honor of Bezos' mother, stationed about 620 miles (1,000 kilometers) downrange in the Atlantic Ocean.


Though SpaceX makes such landings a near-routine spectacle, this will be Blue Origin's first shot at a touchdown on the high seas.


Meanwhile, the rocket's upper stage will fire its engines toward Earth orbit, carrying a Defense Department-funded prototype spaceship called Blue Ring, which will remain aboard for the roughly six-hour test flight.


Limp emphasized that simply reaching orbit is the prime goal, while successfully recovering the booster would be a welcome "bonus."


Blue Origin does have experience landing its New Shepard rockets — used for suborbital tourism — but they are much smaller and land on terra firma rather than a ship at sea.


Blue Origin has secured a NASA contract to launch two Mars probes aboard New Glenn. The rocket will also support the deployment of Project Kuiper, a satellite internet constellation designed to compete with Starlink.


Like Musk, Bezos has a lifelong passion for space. But whereas Musk dreams of colonizing Mars, Bezos envisions shifting heavy industry off-planet onto floating space platforms to preserve Earth, "humanity's blue origin."


He founded Blue Origin in 2000 — two years before Musk created SpaceX — but has adopted a more cautious pace, in contrast to his rival's "fail fast, learn fast" philosophy.


"There's been impatience within the space community over Blue Origin's very deliberate approach," Scott Pace, a space policy analyst at George Washington University and former member of the National Space Council, told AFP.


If New Glenn succeeds, Pace added, it will give the U.S. government "dissimilar redundancy" — valuable backup if one system fails.

## Trump prosecutor Jack Smith resigns from US Justice Department

date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA

U.S. Special Counsel Jack Smith, who led the federal cases against Donald Trump on charges of trying to overturn his 2020 election defeat and mishandling of classified documents, has resigned, as the Republican president-elect prepares to return to the White House. 


Smith resigned Friday from the Department of Justice, according to a court filing on Saturday to U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, asking her to lift a court order she issued blocking the release of his final report.  


Notice of Smith's resignation came in a footnote in the filing, which said the Special Counsel had completed his work, submitted his final confidential report on January 7, and "separated" from the Justice Department on January 10.  


A former war crimes prosecutor, Smith brought two of the four criminal cases Trump faced after leaving office, but saw them grind to a halt after a Trump-appointed judge in Florida dismissed one and the U.S. Supreme Court — with three justices appointed by Trump — found that former presidents have sweeping immunity from prosecution for official acts. Neither case went to trial. 


After Trump defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in the November 5 election, Smith dropped both cases, citing a longstanding Justice Department rule against prosecuting sitting presidents. In asking courts to dismiss the charges, Smith's team defended the merits of the cases they had brought, signaling that only Trump's impending return to the White House made them untenable.  


Smith's departure is another marker of the collapse of the criminal cases against Trump, which could end without any legal consequences for the incoming president and sparked a backlash that helped fuel his political comeback. 


Smith's resignation from the Justice Department was expected. Trump, who has frequently called Smith "deranged" had said he would fire him immediately upon taking office on January 20, and has suggested that he may pursue retribution against Smith and others who investigated him once he returns to office. 


Trump in 2023 became the first sitting or former U.S. president to face criminal prosecution, first in New York, where he was charged with trying to cover up a hush money payment to a porn star during his 2016 presidential campaign. Smith's charges followed, accusing Trump of illegally retaining classified material after leaving office and of trying to overturn his 2020 loss, a campaign that sparked the January 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol. Prosecutors in Georgia also charged Trump over his efforts to overturn his election defeat in that state. 


Trump denied wrongdoing and assailed the prosecutions as politically motivated attempts to damage his campaign. He raised millions in campaign contributions from courthouse appearances and used the cases to drive a powerful narrative that the political establishment was arrayed against him and his supporters. 


The Justice Department defended the cases, saying they were run by career prosecutors who operated free of political influence.
