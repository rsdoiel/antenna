## The rise of private firefighting

date: 2025-01-14, from: Market Place, Make me Smart

<p>As wildfires continue to burn in Los Angeles, some wealthy residents are shelling out thousands each day to hire private firefighters to protect their homes and businesses. But some argue that the market for these private crews diminishes public firefighting resources. We&#8217;ll get into it.

## US agencies warn of potential New Orleans copycat attack

date: 2025-01-14, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security on Monday warned of a potential public safety threat from violent extremists who might try to copy the New Year's Day attack in New Orleans that killed 14 people.


The warning comes a week before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration.


"The FBI and DHS are concerned about possible copycat or retaliatory attacks due to the persistent appeal of vehicle ramming as a tactic for aspiring violent extremist attackers," the agencies said in a statement.


Early on New Year's Day, more than a dozen people were killed and a dozen others injured when a man rammed a rented pickup truck into a crowd of revelers along Bourbon Street in New Orleans.


The man who carried out the attack was a U.S. Army veteran who had pledged allegiance to Islamic State and appeared to have made recordings condemning music, drugs and alcohol.


The agencies said such attacks, inspired by foreign "terrorist" organizations, have been carried out in the U.S. and abroad using rented, stolen and personally owned vehicles.


Attackers could also attempt to use improvised explosive devices to supplement a vehicle attack, they said.


The agencies said past targets have included pedestrians, law enforcement or military members, and crowded public venues that are accessible from roadways.


"We ask that the public remain vigilant regarding possible copycat or retaliatory attacks and report any suspicious activity to law enforcement," they said.

## Trump’s Offshore Wind Ban Is Coming, Congressman Says

date: 2025-01-14, from: Heatmap News

Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, the congressman said in a press release from his office Monday afternoon. </p>
<p>“This executive order is just the beginning,” Van Drew said in a statement. “We will fight tooth and nail to prevent this offshore wind catastrophe from wreaking havoc on the hardworking people who call our coastal towns home.” </p>
<p>The announcement indicates that some in the anti-wind space are leaving open the possibility that Trump’s much-hyped offshore wind ban may be less sweeping than initially suggested. </p>
<p>In <a href="https://vandrew.house.gov/news/email/show.aspx?ID=4WCDH2I7AJH54" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>its press release</u></a>, Van Drew’s office said the executive order would “lay the groundwork for permanent measures against the projects,” leaving the door open to only a temporary pause on permitting new projects. The congressman had <a href="https://www.njspotlightnews.org/2025/01/nj-rep-jeff-van-drew-drafts-trump-executive-order-freezing-offshore-wind-development/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>recently told</u></a> New Jersey reporters that he anticipates only a six-month moratorium on offshore wind. </p>
<p>The release also stated that the “proposed order” is “expected to be finalized within the first few months of the administration,” which is a far cry from Trump’s promise to stop projects <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/vineyard-wind-trump" target="_self"><u>on Day 1</u></a>. If enacted, a pause would essentially halt <em><em>all</em></em> U.S. offshore wind development because the sought-after stretches of national coastline are entirely within federal waters.</p>
<p>Whether this is just caution from Van Drew’s people or a true moderation of Trump’s ambition we’ll soon find out. Inauguration Day is in less than a week.</p>

## An Unexpected Obstacle to Putting Out the L.A. Fires

You’re working long hours — not as long as your colleagues on the ground due to flight time limitations, but the maximum scheduling allows — not to mention the added external pressures you’re also facing. Even the incoming president recently wondered aloud <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/los-angeles-fires-water" target="_self"><u>why the fires aren’t under control yet</u></a> and <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/what-you-need-to-know-la-fires?rebelltitem=5#rebelltitem5:~:text=%E2%80%9CThey%20just%20can%E2%80%99t%20put%20out%20the%20fires.%20What%E2%80%99s%20wrong%20with%20them%3F%E2%80%9D" target="_self"><u>insinuated</u></a> that it’s your and your colleagues’ fault. </p><p>You’re on a sortie, getting ready for <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DEs6vs4yIdU/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a particularly white-knuckle drop</u></a> at a low altitude in poor visibility conditions when an object catches your eye outside the cockpit window: an authorized drone dangerously close to your wing.</p><p>Aerial firefighters don’t have to imagine this terrifying scenario; they’ve lived it. Last week, a drone punched a hole in the wing of a Québécois “Super Scooper” plane that had <a href="https://skiesmag.com/news/quebec-cl-415-super-scooper-may-resume-flying-today-after-drone-strike-repairs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>traveled down from Canada</u></a> to fight the fires, grounding Palisades firefighting operations <a href="https://abc7.com/post/california-wildfires-fbi-shares-photos-pieces-drone-damaged-super-scooper-aircraft-flying-palisades-fire/15792412/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>for an agonizing half-hour</u></a>. Thirty minutes might not seem like much, but it is precious time lost when the Santa Ana winds have already curtailed aerial operations. </p><p>“I am shocked by what happened in Los Angeles with the drone,” Anna Lau, a forestry communication coordinator with the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation, told me. The Montana DNRC has also had to contend with <a href="https://www.ypradio.org/wildfire/2022-09-01/drone-complicates-response-to-fire-west-of-helena" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>unauthorized drones grounding its firefighting planes</u></a>. “We’re following what’s going on very closely, and it’s shocking to us,” Lau went on. Leaving the skies clear so that firefighters can get on with their work “just seems like a no-brainer, especially when people are actively trying to tackle the situation at hand and fighting to save homes, property, and lives.”</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Courtesy of U.S. Forest Service</small></p><p>Although the Super Scooper collision was by far the most egregious case, according to authorities there have been at least 40 “incidents involving drones” in the airspace around L.A. since the fires started. (Notably, the Federal Aviation Administration has not granted any waivers for the air space around Palisades, meaning any drone images you see of the region, including on the news, were “probably shot illegally,” <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/los-angeles-firefighters-drones.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>Intelligencer</em></em></u><u> reports</u></a>.) So far, law enforcement has arrested three people <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/5082600-unauthorized-drone-flights-double-in-southern-california-3-arrested-during-la-fires/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>connected to drones flying</u></a> near the L.A. fires, and the FBI is <a href="https://x.com/FBIMostWanted/status/1878910193259454890" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>seeking information</u></a> regarding the Super Scooper collision.</p><p>Such a problem is hardly isolated to these fires, though. The Forest Service reports that drones led to the suspension of or interfered with <a href="https://richmondobserver.com/local-news/forest-service-agencies-reminding-residents-across-the-state-to-keep-drones-away-from-wildfires.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>at least 172 fire responses</u></a> between 2015 and 2020. Some people, including Mike Fraietta, an FAA-certified drone pilot and the founder of the drone-detection company Gargoyle Systems, believe the true number of interferences is much higher — closer to 400.</p><p>Law enforcement likes to say that unauthorized drone use falls into three buckets — <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/unauthorized-drone-usage-in-double-digits-amid-socals-firefight/3602131/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>clueless, criminal, or careless</u></a> — and Fraietta was inclined to believe that it’s mostly the former in L.A. Hobbyists and other casual drone operators “don’t know the regulations or that this is a danger,” he said. “There’s a lot of ignorance.” To raise awareness, he suggested law enforcement and the media highlight the steep penalties for flying drones in wildfire no-fly zones, which is punishable <a href="https://www.kxlh.com/us-news/california-wildfires/firefighting-plane-grounded-after-drone-strike-will-be-back-in-the-air-soon-officials-said#:~:text=including%20the%20FAA.-,Officials%20said%2C%20so%20far%2C%20three%20people%20have%20been%20arrested%20for,fine%20of%20up%20to%20%2475%2C000." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>by up to</u></a> 12 months in prison or a fine of $75,000.</p><p>“What we’re seeing, particularly in California, is TikTok and Instagram influencers trying to get a shot and get likes,” Fraietta conjectured. In the case of the drone that hit the Super Scooper, it “might have been a case of citizen journalism, like, <em><em>Well, I have the ability to get this shot and share what’s going on</em></em>.” </p><p>Emergency management teams are waking up, too. Many technologies are on the horizon for drone detection, identification, and deflection, including Wi-Fi jamming, which was used to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/london-heathrow-appears-jam-drone-signals-stop-climate-protests-2019-9#:~:text=for%20more%20stories.-,London's%20Heathrow%20Airport%20appears%20to%20have%20worked%20out%20how%20to,protesters%20from%20disrupting%20its%20airspace.&text=Activists%20from%20the%20group%20Heathrow,that%20most%20did%20not%20work." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ground climate activists’ drones</u></a> at Heathrow Airport in 2019. Jamming is less practical in an emergency situation like the one in L.A., though, where lives could be at stake if people can’t communicate.</p><p>Still, the fact of the matter is that firefighters waste precious time dealing with drones when there are far more pressing issues that need their attention. Lau, in Montana, described how even just a 12-minute interruption to firefighting efforts can put a community at risk. “The biggest public awareness message we put out is, ‘If you fly, we can’t,’” she said. </p><p>Fraietta, though, noted that drone <a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/los-angeles-fires-tech" target="_self"><u>technology could be used positively in the future</u></a>, including on wildfire detection and monitoring, <a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/drone-amplified-field-tech-lab-wildfires-drones" target="_self"><u>prescribed burns</u></a>, and communicating with firefighters <a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/new-york-disaster-drones" target="_self"><u>or victims</u></a> on the ground. </p><p>“We don’t want to see this turn into the FAA saying, ‘Hey everyone, no more drones in the United States because of this incident,’” Fraietta said. “You don’t shut down I-95 because a few people are running drugs up and down it, right? Drones are going to be super beneficial to the country long term.”</p><p>But critically, in the case of a wildfire, such tools belong in the <em><em>right</em></em> hands — not the hands of your neighbor who got a DJI Mini 3 for Christmas. “Their one shot isn’t worth it,” Lau said.</p><p><em>Editor’s note: This story has been updated to reflect that the Québécois firefighting planes are called Super Scoopers, not super soakers.</em><br/></p>

## Millions have had student loans canceled under Biden, despite collapse of his forgiveness plan

date: 2025-01-13, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON  — Despite failing to deliver his promise for broad student loan forgiveness, President Joe Biden has now overseen the cancellation of student loans for more than 5 million Americans — more than any other president in U.S. history.


In a last-minute action on Monday, the Education Department canceled loans for 150,000 borrowers through programs that existed before Biden took office. His administration expanded those programs and used them to their fullest extent, pressing on with cancellation even after the Supreme Court rejected Biden's plan for a new forgiveness policy.


“My Administration has taken historic action to reduce the burden of student debt, hold bad actors accountable, and fight on behalf of students across the country,” Biden said in a written statement.


In total, the administration says it has waived $183.6 billion in student loans.


The wave of cancellations could dry up when President-elect Donald Trump takes office. Trump hasn't detailed his student loan policies but previously called cancellation “vile” and illegal. Republicans have fought relentlessly against Biden's plans, saying cancellation is ultimately shouldered by taxpayers who never attended college or already repaid their loans.


Biden loosened rules for debt forgiveness


The latest round of relief mostly comes through a program known as borrower defense, which allows students to get their loans canceled if they're cheated or misled by their colleges. It was created in 1994 but rarely used until a wave of high-profile for-profit college scandals during the Obama administration.


A smaller share of the relief came through a program for borrowers with disabilities and through Public Service Loan Forgiveness, which was created in 2007 and offers to erase all remaining debt for borrowers in a government or nonprofit job who make 10 years of monthly payments.


Most of Monday's borrower defense cancellations were for students who attended several defunct colleges owned by Center for Excellence in Higher Education, including CollegeAmerica, Stevens-Henager College, and Independence University. They are based on past findings that the schools lied to prospective students about their employment prospects and the terms of private loans.


Before Biden took office, those programs were criticized by advocates who said complex rules made it difficult for borrowers to get relief. The Biden administration loosened some of the rules using its regulatory power, a maneuver that expanded eligibility without going through Congress.


As an example, just 7,000 borrowers had gotten their loans canceled through Public Service Loan Forgiveness before the Biden administration took office. Widespread confusion about eligibility, along with errors by loan servicers, resulted in a 99% rejection rate for applicants.


Huge numbers of borrowers made years of payments only to find out they were in an ineligible repayment plan. Some were improperly put into forbearance — a pause on payments — by their loan servicers. Those periods didn't end up counting toward the 10 years of payments needed for cancellation.


The Biden administration temporarily relaxed the eligibility rules during the pandemic and then made it more permanent in 2023. As a result, more than 1 million public servants have now had their balances zeroed out through the program.


All those rule changes were meant to be a companion to Biden's marquee policy for student debt, which proposed up to $20,000 in relief for more than 40 million Americans.


But after the Supreme Court blocked the move, the Biden administration shifted its focus to maximizing relief through existing mechanisms.


Republicans have called for a different approach


Announcements of new cancellation became routine, even as conservatives in Congress accused Biden of overstepping his power. Republican states fought off Biden's later attempts at mass forgiveness, but the smaller batches of relief continued without any major legal challenge.


As Republicans take hold of both chambers of Congress and the White House, Biden's changes could be targeted for a rollback. But it's unclear how far the next administration will go to tighten the cancellation spigot.


Trump proposed eliminating PSLF during his first term in office, but Congress rejected the idea. Project 2025, a blueprint created by the Heritage Foundation for a second Trump term, proposes ending PSLF, and narrowing borrower defense and making repayment plans less generous than existing ones.

## Elon Musk says third patient got Neuralink brain implant

date: 2025-01-13, from: VOA News USA

Elon Musk said a third person has received an implant from his brain-computer interface company Neuralink, one of many groups working to connect the nervous system to machines.


“We've got ... three humans with Neuralinks and all are working well,” he said during a recent wide-ranging interview at a Las Vegas event streamed on his social media platform X.


Since the first brain implant about a year ago, Musk said the company has upgraded the devices with more electrodes, higher bandwidth and longer battery life. Musk also said Neuralink hopes to implant the experimental devices in 20 to 30 more people this year.


Musk didn't provide any details about the latest patient, but there are updates on the previous ones.


The second recipient — who has a spinal cord injury and got the implant last summer — was playing video games with the help of the device and learning how to use computer-aided design software to create 3-D objects. The first patient, also paralyzed after a spinal cord injury, described how it helped him play video games and chess.


But while such developments at Neuralink often attract notice, many other companies and research groups are working on similar projects. Two studies last year in the New England Journal of Medicine described how brain-computer interfaces, or BCIs, helped people with ALS communicate better.


Who's working on brain-computer interface technology?


More than 45 trials involving brain-computer interfaces are underway, according to a U.S. database of studies. The efforts are aimed at helping treat brain disorders, overcoming brain injuries and other uses.


Many research labs have already shown that humans can accurately control computer cursors using BCIs, said Rajesh Rao, co-director of the Center for Neurotechnology at the University of Washington.


Rao said Neuralink may be unique in two ways: The surgery to implant the device is the first time a robot has been used to implant flexible electrode threads into a human brain to record neural activity and control devices. And those threads may record from more neurons than other interfaces.


Still, he said, the advantages of Neuralink’s approach have yet to be shown, and some competitors have eclipsed the company in other ways. For example, Rao said companies such as Synchron, Blackrock Neurotech and Onward Medical are already conducting BCI trials on people “using either less invasive methods or more versatile approaches” that combine neural recording with stimulation.


What are the benefits of BCIs?


Marco Baptista, chief scientific officer of the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation, called BCI technology “very exciting” with potential benefits to people with paralysis.


Through clinical trials, “we’ll be able to see what’s going to be the winning approach,” he said. “It’s a little early to know."


Baptista said his foundation generally tries to support research teams financially and with expert help – though it hasn’t given any money to Neuralink.


“We need to really support high-risk, high-reward endeavors. This is clearly high-risk, high-reward. We don’t know how safe it’s going to be. We don’t know how feasible it’s going to be," he said.


How are BCIs tested and regulated?


Neuralink announced in 2023 that it had gotten permission from U.S. regulators to begin testing its device in people.


While most medical devices go on the market without clinical studies, high-risk ones that undergo pre-market approval need what’s called an “investigational device exemption” from the Food and Drug Administration, said Dr. Rita Redberg, a cardiologist at the University of California, San Francisco, who studies high-risk devices.


Neuralink says it has this exemption, but the FDA said it can’t confirm or disclose information about a particular study.


Redberg said the FDA tends to be involved in all steps from recruiting patients to testing devices to analyzing data. She said this regulatory process prioritizes safety.


She also pointed to another layer of protection: All research involving people needs an institutional review board, or IRB. It can also be known as an ethical review board or an independent ethics committee. Members must include at least one non-scientist as well as someone not affiliated with the institution or organization forming the board.


The role of such boards “is to assume there is reasonable risk and reasonable chance of benefit and that patients are informed of those before they enroll," said Redberg.

## Biden defends foreign policy record despite ongoing crises

date: 2025-01-13, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Outgoing President Joe Biden sought to burnish his foreign policy record Monday and said U.S. adversaries are weaker than when he took office four years ago despite global crises that remain unresolved. 


A week before handing over to President-elect Donald Trump, Biden in a rare State Department speech touted his administration's backing for Ukraine against Russia's 2022 invasion and for Israel's wars in the Middle East. 


Biden said the United States was "winning the worldwide competition" and would not be surpassed economically by China as had been predicted, while Russia and Iran have been weakened by wars without direct U.S. involvement. 


"Compared to four years ago, America is stronger, our alliances are stronger, our adversaries and competitors are weaker," Biden said. "We have not gone to war to make these things happen." 


While wars continue to rage in Ukraine and the Middle East, officials hope a deal between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas can be reached before Biden departs the White House on Jan. 20. 


Biden said negotiators were close to reaching a deal that would free hostages held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip and halt the fighting in the Palestinian enclave to allow a surge of humanitarian aid. 


"So many innocent people have been killed, so many communities have been destroyed. Palestinian people deserve peace," he said. 


Biden has faced criticism for providing Israel with weapons and diplomatic support during its assault on Gaza after Hamas attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. 


Since then, more than 46,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to Palestinian health officials, with much of the enclave laid to waste and most of its population displaced. 


Protesters shouting “war criminal” greeted Biden outside the State Department on Monday, some with signs and some throwing red liquid intended to look like blood. 


Biden said he had helped Israel defeat adversaries like Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, both backed by Iran. The U.S. president also hailed Washington's support for Israel during two Iranian attacks in 2024. 


"All told, Iran is weaker than it's been in decades," he added, noting the collapse of the Syrian Assad government. "There's no question that our actions contributed significantly."

## Baltimore prosecutors back Adnan Syed's request to have his sentence reduced to time served

date: 2025-01-13, from: VOA News USA

Baltiomore, Md. — Baltimore prosecutors filed a motion supporting Adnan Syed's recent request to have his sentence reduced to time served, which could ensure he remains free indefinitely as he awaits further court decisions in a decadeslong legal saga that amassed a large following from the hit podcast "Serial."


Syed was released from prison in 2022 after prosecutors asked a judge to overturn his murder conviction in the 1999 slaying of his high school ex-girlfriend, Hae Min Lee. But challenges from Lee's family later led to his conviction being reinstated. In August, the Maryland Supreme Court upheld a lower court decision ordering a new hearing about vacating the conviction.


Last month, Syed's attorneys filed a motion asking for his sentence to be reduced under Maryland's relatively new Juvenile Restoration Act, which allows people serving long sentences for crimes they committed as minors to seek release after 20 years behind bars. The legislation was passed amid growing consensus that such defendants are especially open to rehabilitation, in part because brain science shows cognitive development continues well beyond the teenage years. Syed was 17 when Lee was found strangled to death and buried in a makeshift grave.


Prosecutors filed the motion in support of a sentence reduction on Sunday, according to the Baltimore City State's Attorney's Office.


In it, State's Attorney Ivan Bates said Syed's request is "in the interest of justice."


"I truly believe Mr. Syed's case is precisely what legislators envisioned when they crafted the Juvenile Restoration Act," Bates said in a statement Monday. "We have an individual who has served over 20 years in prison from the time he was a teenager and who has displayed tremendous personal growth and reform."


But attorneys for the Lee family argue it's premature to consider a sentence reduction while the integrity of the conviction is still up in the air.


"That question regarding ultimate guilt or innocence needs to be resolved before any thought of reducing Mr. Syed's sentence can be considered," attorney David Sanford said in a statement. "Currently Mr. Syed remains a convicted murderer and nothing the State or Mr. Syed has ever presented calls that fact into question."




The case, which has been rife with legal twists and turns, has more recently pitted criminal justice reform efforts against the rights of crime victims and their families, whose voices are often at odds with a growing movement to acknowledge and correct longstanding issues such as systemic racism, police misconduct and prosecutorial missteps.


Since his release in 2022, Syed has been working at Georgetown University's Prisons and Justice Initiative and helping care for his aging parents, according to court filings. His father died in October after a long illness.


"He cares so much about our family," his mother wrote in a recent letter to the court. "He is married and tries to be the best husband he can. He is always trying to help us out anyway that he can. He has tried hard to become a positive member of his community."




Syed has maintained his innocence from the beginning, but many questions about the case remain unanswered even after the "Serial" podcast combed through the evidence, reexamined legal arguments and interviewed witnesses. The series debuted in 2014 and drew millions of listeners who became armchair detectives.


Prosecutors wrote that since his release from prison in 2022, Syed, 43, has shown he doesn't pose a threat to public safety.


"In taking this position, the State does not want to minimize the seriousness of the crime in this case," the motion says. "The State, however, does not believe in warehousing individuals who committed a crime when they were a juvenile and have demonstrated maturity, have been rehabilitated [and] are now fit to reenter society."


But the motion doesn't present a position on Syed's conviction itself.


The Maryland Supreme Court's 4-3 ruling in August called for a new hearing on whether the conviction should be vacated because the victim's relatives didn't receive adequate notice to allow them to attend the original proceeding, which won Syed his freedom.


Bates, who took office as state's attorney a few months after the 2022 hearing, is now weighing how to proceed given the Supreme Court's decision. But if Syed's motion for a reduced sentence is granted, he would likely avoid going back to prison regardless.

## Judge clears way for release of special counsel Smith's report on Trump's Jan. 6 case

date: 2025-01-13, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The Justice Department can publicly release its investigative report on President-elect Donald Trump's 2020 election interference case, a federal judge said Monday — the latest ruling in a court dispute over the highly anticipated document days before Trump is set to take office again.


But a temporary injunction barring the immediate release of the report remains in effect until Tuesday, and it's unlikely Judge Aileen Cannon's order will be the last word on the matter. Defense lawyers may seek to challenge it all the way up to the Supreme Court.


Cannon had earlier temporarily blocked the department from releasing the entire report on former Special Counsel Jack Smith's investigations into Trump that led to two separate criminal cases. Cannon's latest order on Monday cleared the way for the release of the volume on Trump's 2020 election interference case.


She set a hearing for Friday on whether the department can release to lawmakers the volume on Trump's classified documents case. The department has said it will not publicly disclose that volume as long as criminal proceedings against two of Trump's co-defendants remain pending.


Smith resigned his position on Friday after transmitting his report to Attorney General Merrick Garland, the Justice Department revealed in a footnote in a court filing over the weekend.


The ruling, if it stands, could open the door for the public to learn additional details in the coming days about Trump's frantic but ultimately failed effort to cling to power in the run-up to the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the Capitol.


But even as Cannon permitted the release of the volume on election interference, she halted the Justice Department from immediately sharing with congressional officials a separate volume related to Trump's hoarding of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida. Lawyers for the Republican president-elect's two co-defendants, Trump valet Walt Nauta and Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos De Oliveira, had argued that the release of the report would prejudice them given that criminal proceedings remain ongoing against them in the form of a Justice Department appeal of Cannon's dismissal of charges.


As a compromise, the Justice Department said that it would not make that document public but would instead share it with select congressional officials for their private review. But Cannon halted those plans and instead scheduled a hearing for Friday afternoon.


"All parties agree that Volume II expressly and directly concerns this criminal proceeding," she wrote. "All parties also appear to agree that public release of Volume II would be inconsistent with the fair trial rights of Defendants Nauta and De Oliveira and with Department of Justice Policy governing the release of information during the pendency of criminal proceedings."

## US designates extreme right-wing 'Terrorgram' network as terrorist group

date: 2025-01-13, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The U.S. on Monday imposed sanctions on an extreme right-wing online network, designating the "Terrorgram" collective a terrorist group and accusing it of promoting violent white supremacy. 


The U.S. State Department said in a statement that it had designated the group, which primarily operates on the Telegram social media site, and three of its leaders as Specially Designated Global Terrorists. 


The State Department said the group has motivated and facilitated attacks and attempted attacks by users, including a 2022 shooting outside an LGBTQ bar in Slovakia, a planned attack in 2024 on energy facilities in New Jersey and an August knife attack at a mosque in Turkey. 


"The group promotes violent white supremacism, solicits attacks on perceived adversaries, and provides guidance and instructional materials on tactics, methods, and targets for attacks, including on critical infrastructure and government officials," the State Department said. 


The action freezes any of the group's U.S. assets and bars Americans from dealing with it. 


The leaders targeted on Monday with sanctions were based in Brazil, Croatia and South Africa, according to the statement. 


In September, U.S. prosecutors unveiled criminal charges against two alleged leaders of the group, saying they used Telegram to solicit attacks on Black, Jewish, LGBTQ people and immigrants with the aim of inciting a race war. 


Britain in April said it would proscribe the Terrorgram collective as a terrorist organization, meaning it would become a criminal offense in the country to belong to or promote the group. 


U.S. President Joe Biden has railed against white supremacy while in office. 


In 2021, Biden launched the first-ever U.S. National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism, which included resources to identify and prosecute threats and new deterrents to prevent Americans from joining dangerous groups.

## What Started the Fires in Los Angeles?

date: 2025-01-13, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTUxNzc3MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2ODk0NDc4OH0.O5seMWvranQeLDIE7cv2PyEvitcznDDu_w2Rv2FyImk/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	As Los Angeles continued to battle multiple big blazes ripping through some of the most beloved (and expensive) areas of the city on Friday, a question lingered in the background: What caused the fires in the first place?
</p><p>
	Though fires are less common in California during this time of the year, they aren’t unheard of. In early December 2017, power lines sparked the Thomas Fire near Ventura, California, which burned through to mid-January. At the time it was the largest fire in the state since at least the 1930s. Now <a href="https://34c031f8-c9fd-4018-8c5a-4159cdff6b0d-cdn-endpoint.azureedge.net/-/media/calfire-website/our-impact/fire-statistics/top-20-largest-ca-wildfires.pdf?rev=097f901c128347149e2614f2fca4f546&hash=27DDE83DFEF9A69E67C73765892A2B75" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>it’s the ninth-largest</u></a>. Although that fire was in a more rural area, it ignited for some of the same reasons we’re seeing fires this week.
</p><p>
	Read on for everything we know so far about how the fires started.
</p><h3>How many fires are burning in Los Angeles County and where are they?</h3><br/><p>
	Six major fires started during the Santa Ana wind event last week:
</p><p>
<br/>
</p><ul>
<li>The Palisades Fire, in the Pacific Palisades, which has burned nearly 24,000 acres, started on Tuesday, January 7, around 10:30 a.m. Pacific time.</li>
<li>The Eaton Fire, north of Pasadena, which has burned more than 14,000 acres, started on Tuesday just after 6:00 p.m.</li>
<li>The Hurst Fire, in the northern edge of the San Fernando Valley, which has burned about 800 acres, started on Tuesday night around 10:30 pm.</li>
<li>The Lidia Fire, in Acton, California, just north of Angeles National Forest, which has burned roughly 400 acres, started on Wednesday afternoon around 1:00 p.m. As of Saturday morning it was declared 100% contained.</li>
<li>The Sunset Fire, in the Hollywood Hills, which has burned about 43 acres, started on Wednesday night around 5:30 p.m. Evacuation orders lifted early Thursday morning, when the fire’s “forward progress has been stopped,” and crews were working to “put out hotspots within the fire perimeter and keep the wind from spreading embers,” <a href="https://x.com/PIOErikScott" target="_blank"><u>according to Los Angeles Fire Department Public Information Officer Erik Scott</u></a>.</li>
<li>The Kenneth Fire, in the hills above Calabasas, which burned a little over 1,000 acres, started on Thursday around 3:30 p.m. As of Sunday morning it was declared 100% contained.</li>
</ul><h3>How did the fires start?</h3><br><p>Officials are investigating the cause of the fires and have not made any public statements yet. <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-01-12/la-me-eaton-fire-power-lines" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Early eyewitness accounts</u></a> suggest that the Eaton Fire may have started at the base of a transmission tower owned by Southern California Edison. So far, the company has maintained that an analysis of its equipment showed “no interruptions or electrical or operational anomalies until more than one hour after the reported start time of the fire.” A <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2025/01/12/palisades-fire-origin-new-years-eve-fire/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>Washington Post</em></em></u><u> investigation found</u></a> that the Palisades Fire could have risen from the remnants of a fire that burned on New Year’s Eve and reignited. </p><p>On Thursday morning, Edward Nordskog, a retired fire investigator from the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department, told me it was unlikely they had even begun looking into the root of the biggest and most destructive of the fires in the Pacific Palisades. “They don't start an investigation until it's safe to go into the area where the fire started, and it just hasn't been safe until probably today,” he said.</p><p>It can take years to determine the cause of a fire. Investigators did not pinpoint the cause of the Thomas Fire until March 2019, more than two years after it started.</p><p>But Nordskog doesn’t think it will take very long this time. It’s easier to narrow down the possibilities for an urban fire because there are typically both witnesses and surveillance footage, he told me. He said the most common causes of wildfires in Los Angeles are power lines and those started by unhoused people. They can also be caused by sparks from vehicles or equipment.</p><h3>How do these fires compare to past fires in California?</h3><br/><p>At more than 40,000 acres burned total, these fires are unlikely to make the charts for the <a href="https://34c031f8-c9fd-4018-8c5a-4159cdff6b0d-cdn-endpoint.azureedge.net/-/media/calfire-website/our-impact/fire-statistics/top-20-largest-ca-wildfires.pdf?rev=097f901c128347149e2614f2fca4f546&hash=27DDE83DFEF9A69E67C73765892A2B75" target="_blank"><u>largest in California history</u></a>. But because they are burning in urban, densely populated, and expensive areas, they could be some of the most devastating. With an <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/live/pacific-palisades-fire-updates-los-angeles" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>estimated 9,000 structures damaged</u></a> as of Friday morning, the Eaton and Palisades fires are likely to make the list for <a href="https://34c031f8-c9fd-4018-8c5a-4159cdff6b0d-cdn-endpoint.azureedge.net/-/media/calfire-website/our-impact/fire-statistics/top-20-destructive-ca-wildfires.pdf?rev=9e4974c273274858880c2dd28292a96f&hash=29E21CBFCE8D9885F606246607D21CEB" target="_blank"><u>most destructive wildfire events</u></a> in the state.</p><p>And they will certainly be at the top for costliest. The Palisades Fire has already been declared a likely contender for the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-09/the-costliest-fire-on-record-not-just-for-california" target="_blank"><u>most expensive wildfire in U.S. history</u></a>.  It has destroyed <a href="https://lafd.org/news/palisades-fire-0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more than 5,000</u></a> structures in some of the most expensive zip codes in the country. Between that and the Eaton Fire, Accuweather estimates the damages could reach <a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/blogs-webinars/california-wildfires-52-57b-damage-estimate-accuweather-report/1731718" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$57 billion</u></a>.</p><h3>Why are these fires so bad? Is it climate change?</h3><br/><p>
	While we don’t know the root causes of the ignitions, several factors came together to create perfect fire conditions in Southern California this week.
</p><p>
	First, there’s the <a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/santa-ana-winds-climate-change" target="_self"><u>Santa Ana winds</u></a>, an annual phenomenon in Southern California, when very dry, high-pressure air gets trapped in the Great Basin and begins escaping westward through mountain passes to lower-pressure areas along the coast. Most of the time, the wind in Los Angeles blows eastward from the ocean, but during a Santa Ana event, it changes direction, picking up speed as it rushes toward the sea.
</p><p>
	Jon Keeley, a research scientist with the US Geological Survey and an adjunct professor at the University of California, Los Angeles told me that Santa Ana winds typically blow at maybe 30 to 40 miles per hour, while the winds this week hit upwards of 60 to 70 miles per hour. “More severe than is normal, but not unique,” he said. “We had similar severe winds in 2017 with the Thomas Fire.”
</p><p>
	Second, Southern California is currently in the midst of extreme drought. Winter is typically a rainier season, but Los Angeles has seen less than half an inch of rain since July. That means that all the shrubland vegetation in the area is bone-dry. Again, Keeley said, this was not usual, but not unique. Some years are drier than others.
</p><p>
	These fires were also not a question of fuel management, Keeley told me. “The fuels are not really the issue in these big fires. It's the extreme winds,” he said. “You can do prescription burning in chaparral and have essentially no impact on Santa Ana wind-driven fires.” As far as he can tell, <a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2025/1/7/eaton-fire/updates/b71f526e-4b91-4cdc-99cd-f5e19c80105f" target="_blank"><u>based on information from CalFire</u></a>, the Eaton Fire started on an urban street.
</p><p>
	While it’s likely that climate change played a role in amplifying the drought, it’s hard to say how big a factor it was. Patrick Brown, a climate scientist at the Breakthrough Institute and adjunct professor at Johns Hopkins University, published a long <a href="https://x.com/PatrickTBrown31/status/1877134442839310573" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>post on X</u></a> outlining the factors contributing to the fires, including a <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/city/time-series/USW00023174/pcp/3/2/1895-2024?base_prd=true&begbaseyear=1991&endbaseyear=2020&trend=true&trend_base=10&begtrendyear=1975&endtrendyear=2024" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>chart</u></a> of historic rainfall during the winter in Los Angeles that shows oscillations between wet and dry years over the past eight decades.
</p><p>
But climate change is expected to make dry years drier and wet years wetter, creating a “hydroclimate whiplash,” as Daniel Swain, a pre-eminent expert on climate change and weather in California puts it. In a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/weatherwest.bsky.social/post/3lfdot3l5dm2o" target="_blank"><u>thread on Bluesky</u></a>, Swain wrote that “in 2024, Southern California experienced an exceptional episode of wet-to-dry hydroclimate whiplash.” Last year’s rainy winter fostered abundant plant growth, and the proceeding dryness primed the vegetation for fire.

EV leases are booming</h3><p>Affordable EV leases are “the car market’s hottest deal,” <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/ev-lease-tax-credit-loophole-taxpayers-85fc489b?mod=hp_listb_pos3&utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_QOYAQ1junHUjUOJTljXfLIT2mxmej0leE1gFOZn1y-ESBGPQzEcYGr_6KqmqFwQOma5XP" target="_blank">according to</a> <em><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></em>. Car companies are changing the way they pitch EVs to buyers, offering short-term leases with low monthly payments. These deals are attractive to first-time EV shoppers who are still a little bit hesitant to commit, as well as people on a tighter budget. Roughly 45% of EV transactions at the end of 2024 were leases, much higher than the auto industry as a whole. And a provision in the Inflation Reduction Act means leased cars can more easily qualify for the government’s $7,500 EV tax credit. “The proliferation of lease deals has made EVs more accessible to buyers who couldn’t afford their higher sticker prices,” the <em><em>Journal</em></em> said. “For the automakers, it is helping get more EVs into customers’ hands after a choppy start for their electric-car operations.” </p><h3>4. Wind power generation could surpass coal in EU</h3><p>Wind power could overtake coal in Europe for electricity generation for the first time this year, according to the energy think tank Ember. At the end of 2024, wind power was closing in on coal, coming in at just 4% below the fossil fuel in power generation as the continent’s coal plants close. “That output gap could easily be made up over the course of 2025 by an increase in regional wind generation capacity or by higher average wind speeds at turbine level, or by some combination of both,” <em><em>Reuters</em></em> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/europes-wind-farms-track-eclipse-coal-output-2025-maguire-2025-01-13/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_QOYAQ1junHUjUOJTljXfLIT2mxmej0leE1gFOZn1y-ESBGPQzEcYGr_6KqmqFwQOma5XP" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>. Last year wind power accounted for 20% of electricity consumed in the EU, and the goal is to get that up to 50% by 2050. But as <em><em>Electrek</em></em> <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/01/10/europe-wind-power-hits-20-but-3-challenges-stall-progress/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_QOYAQ1junHUjUOJTljXfLIT2mxmej0leE1gFOZn1y-ESBGPQzEcYGr_6KqmqFwQOma5XP" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">noted</a>, the same problems plaguing projects in the U.S. – permitting delays and connection bottlenecks – are slowing things down. The EU accounts for <a href="https://ember-energy.org/countries-and-regions/european-union/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_QOYAQ1junHUjUOJTljXfLIT2mxmej0leE1gFOZn1y-ESBGPQzEcYGr_6KqmqFwQOma5XP#:~:text=The%20European%20Union%20(EU)%20is,2023%20%E2%80%93%20double%20the%20global%20average." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">4.6%</a> of global power sector emissions. </p><h3>5. WHO calls for case studies on mental health care in the climate crisis</h3><p>The World Health Organization’s European Centre for Environment and Health has <a href="https://extranet.who.int/dataformv6/index.php/611299?lang=en&utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_QOYAQ1junHUjUOJTljXfLIT2mxmej0leE1gFOZn1y-ESBGPQzEcYGr_6KqmqFwQOma5XP" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">issued a callout</a> for “examples of interventions to protect and promote mental health in the face of climate change.” The group wants to take stock of these interventions so that it can identify gaps in mental health care and share some best practices. The callout is aimed at Europe only, but it is indicative of a growing awareness of how the worsening climate crisis is <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/publications/all-publications/the-impact-of-climate-change-on-mental-health-and-emotional-wellbeing-current-evidence-and-implications-for-policy-and-practice.php?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_QOYAQ1junHUjUOJTljXfLIT2mxmej0leE1gFOZn1y-ESBGPQzEcYGr_6KqmqFwQOma5XP" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">taking a toll on mental health</a> worldwide.</p><h2>THE KICKER</h2><p><em>“There’s a lot of finger-pointing going around, and I would just try to emphasize that this is a really complex problem.

## What You Need to Know About the Still-Burning L.A. Fires

date: 2025-01-13, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTU1NTIzNi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0NTg5NDU1M30.ezebBuJnVTx6wSKIJu0S0Xs2Q87zwKryOSpTJ5LY-cc/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">A week ago, forecasters in Southern California warned residents of Los Angeles that conditions would be dry, windy, and conducive to wildfires. How bad things have gotten, though, has taken everyone by surprise. As of Monday morning, almost 40,000 acres of Los Angeles County have burned in six separate fires, the biggest of which, Palisades and Eaton, have yet to be fully contained. The latest red flag warning, indicating fire weather, won’t expire until Wednesday.</p><p>Many have questions about how the second-biggest city in the country is facing such unbelievable devastation (some of these questions, perhaps, being <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113813952733064849" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more politically motivated</u></a> than others). Below, we’ve tried to collect as many answers as possible — including a bit of good news about what lies ahead.</p><h3>What is the forecast for the week ahead?</h3><br/><p>
	A <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/los-angeles-fires-wind-forecast" target="_self"><u>second Santa Ana wind event</u></a> is due to set in Monday afternoon. “We’re expecting moderate Santa Ana winds over the next few days, generally in the 20 to 30 [mile per hour] range, gusting to 50, across the mountains and through the canyons,” Eric Drewitz, a meteorologist with the Forest Service, told me on Sunday. Drewitz noted that the winds will be less severe than last week’s, when the fires flared up, but he also anticipates they’ll be “more easterly,” which could blow the fires into new areas. A new red flag warning has been issued through Wednesday, signaling increased fire potential due to low humidity and high winds for several days yet.
</p><p>
If firefighters can prevent new flare-ups and hold back the fires through that wind event, they might be in good shape. By Friday of this week, “it looks like we could have some moderate onshore flow,” Drewitz said, when wet ocean air blows inland, which would help “build back the marine layer” and increase the relative humidity in the region, <em><em>decreasing</em></em> the chances of more fires. Information about the Santa Anas at that time is still uncertain — the models have been changing, and the wind is tricky to predict the strength of so far out — but an increase in humidity will at least offer some relief for the battered Ventura and Orange Counties.
</p><h3>What areas have been affected so far?</h3><br/><p>The Palisades Fire, the biggest in L.A., ripped through the hilly and affluent area between Santa Monica and Malibu, including the Pacific Palisades neighborhood, <a href="https://patch.com/california/pacificpalisades/pacific-palisades-named-2nd-most-expensive-real-estate-market-la" target="_blank"><u>the second-most expensive zip code</u></a> in Los Angeles and home to many celebrities. Structures in Big Rock, a neighborhood in Malibu, have also burned. The fire has also encroached on the I-405 and the Getty Villa, and destroyed at least two homes in Mandeville Canyon, a neighborhood of multimillion-dollar homes. Students at nearby University of California, Los Angeles, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/weather/live-news/los-angeles-wildfires-palisades-eaton-california-01-11-25#cm5rwz9p400003b6nxcjozpgn" target="_blank"><u>were told</u></a> on Friday to prepare for a possible evacuation.</p><p>The Eaton Fire, the second biggest blaze in the area, has killed 16 people in Altadena, a neighborhood near Pasadena, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-01-12/death-toll-palisades-eaton-fires-rises" target="_blank">according to the </a><em><a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-01-12/death-toll-palisades-eaton-fires-rises">Los Angeles Times</a>,</em> making it one of the deadliest fires in the modern history of California.</p><p>The 1,000-acre Kenneth fire is 100% contained but still burning near Calabasas and the gated community of Hidden Hills. The Hurst Fire has burned nearly 800 acres and is 89% contained and is still burning near Sylmar, the northernmost neighborhood in L.A. Though there are no evacuation notices for either the Kenneth or the Hurst fires, residents in the L.A. area should monitor the current conditions as the situation continues to be fluid and develop.</p><p>The 43-acre Sunset Fire, which triggered evacuations last week in Hollywood and Hollywood Hills, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-01-09/firefighters-make-big-gains-battling-sunset-fire-which-forced-evacuations-in-hollywood" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>burned no homes</u></a> and is 100% contained.</p><p>The Lidia Fire, which ignited in a remote area south of Acton, California, on Wednesday afternoon, burned 350 acres of brush and is 100% contained.</p><h3>How did the fires start?</h3><br/><p>
	It can take years to determine the cause of a fire, and investigations typically don’t begin until after the fire is under control and the area is safe to reenter, Edward Nordskog, a retired fire investigator from the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department, <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/what-started-los-angeles-fires?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1:~:text=How%20did%20the%20fires%20start%3F" target="_self"><u>told Heatmap’s Emily Pontecorvo</u></a>. He also noted, however, that urban fires are typically easier to pinpoint the cause of than wildland fires due to the availability of witnesses and surveillance footage.
</p><p>
The vast majority of wildfires, 85%, <a href="https://www.nps.gov/articles/wildfire-causes-and-evaluation.htm" target="_blank"><u>are caused by humans</u></a>.<strong> </strong>So far, investigators have ruled out lightning — another common fire-starter — because there were no electrical storms in the area when the fires started. In the case of the Palisades Fire, there were no power lines in the area of the ignition, though investigators are now looking into an electrical transmission tower in Eaton Canyon as <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-01-12/la-me-eaton-fire-power-lines" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the possible cause</u></a> of the deadly fire in Altadena. There have been rumors that arsonists started the <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/park-fire-arson" target="_self"><u>fires</u></a>, but investigators say that scenario is also <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/weather/wildfires/are-arsonists-responsible-los-angeles-wildfires-rcna186949" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pretty unlikely</u></a> due to the spread of the fires and how remote the ignition areas are.
</p><h3>How many people have died?</h3><br/><p>Officially, <u><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2025/01/13/los-angeles-fires-california-updates-palisades-eaton/" target="_blank">24  people have died</a></u>, but that tally is likely to rise. California Governor Gavin Newsom said Sunday that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2025/01/12/los-angeles-fires-california-updates-palisades-eaton/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>he expects “a lot more” deaths</u></a> will be added to the total in the coming days as search efforts continue.</p><h3>Why has it been so challenging to put out these fires?</h3><br/><p>
	Incoming President Donald Trump slammed the response to the L.A. fires in <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113813952733064849" target="_blank"><u>a Truth Social post</u></a> on Sunday morning: “This is one of the worst catastrophes in the history of our Country,” he wrote. “They just can’t put out the fires. What’s wrong with them?”
</p><p>
	Though <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/los-angeles-fires-wind-forecast" target="_self"><u>there is much blame</u></a> going around — <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/los-angeles-fires-misinformation" target="_self"><u>not all of it founded in reality</u></a> — the challenges facing firefighters are immense. Last week, because of strong Santa Ana winds, fire crews could not drop suppressants like water or chemical retardant on the initial blazes. (In strong winds, water and retardant <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/video/news/video-3349461/Challenging-conditions-crews-wind-takes-fire-retardant-drop.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>will blow away</u></a> before they reach the flames on the ground.)
</p><p>
	Fighting a fire in an urban or suburban area <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/los-angeles-fires-water" target="_self"><u>is also different</u></a> from fighting one in a remote, wild area. In a true wildfire, crews don’t use much water; firefighters typically contain the blazes by creating breaks — areas cleared of vegetation that starve a fire of fuel and keep it from spreading. In an urban or suburban event, however, firefighters can’t simply hack through a neighborhood, and typically have to use water to fight structure fires. Their priority also shifts from stopping the fire to evacuating and saving people, which means putting out the fire itself has to wait.
</p><p>
	What’s more, the L.A. area faced dangerous fire weather going into last week — with wind gusts up to 100 miles per hour and dry air — and the persistence of the Santa Ana winds during firefighting operations through the weekend made it extremely difficult for emergency managers to gain a foothold.
</p><h3>Is there enough water to fight the fires?</h3><br/><p>
	Trump and others have criticized Los Angeles for being unprepared for the fires, given <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/09/us/los-angeles-fire-water-hydrant-failure.html" target="_blank"><u>reports</u></a> that some fire hydrants ran dry or had low pressure during operations in Pacific Palisades. According to <a href="https://www.ladwpnews.com/pacific-palisades-fire-correcting-misinformation-about-ladwps-water-system/" target="_blank"><u>the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power</u></a>, about 20% of hydrants were affected, mostly at higher elevations.
</p><p>
	The problem isn’t a lack of preparation, however. It’s that the L.A. wildfires are so large and widespread, the county’s preparations were quickly overwhelmed. “We’re fighting a wildfire with urban water systems, and that is really challenging,” Los Angeles Department of Water and Power CEO Janisse Quiñones said in a news conference last week. When houses burn down, water mains can break open. Civilians also put a strain on the system when they use hoses or sprinkler systems to try to protect their homes.
</p><p>
	On Sunday, Judy Chu, the Democratic lawmaker representing Altadena, confirmed that fire officials had told her there was <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/judy-chu-eaton-fire-altadena-response/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>enough water</u></a> to continue the battle in the days ahead. “I believe that we're in a good place right now,” she told reporters. Newsom, meanwhile, has responded to criticism over the water failure by <a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2025-01-10/newsom-water-fires-investigation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ordering an investigation</u></a> into the weak or dry hydrants.
</p><p>
 So-called “super soaker” planes have had no problem with water access; they’re scooping <a href="https://www.foxla.com/video/1572766" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>directly from the ocean</u></a>.
</p><h3>Have aerial firefighting operations resumed?</h3><br/><p>Yes. Although aerial support was grounded in the early stages of the wildfires due to severe Santa Ana winds, flights resumed during lulls in the storms last week.</p>
<p>There is a misconception, though, that water and retardant drops “put out” fires; they don’t. Instead, aerial support suppresses a fire so crews can get in close and use traditional methods, like cutting a fire break or spraying water. “All that up in the air, all that’s doing is allowing the firefighters [on the ground] a chance to get in,” Bobbie Scopa, a veteran firefighter and author of the memoir <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/95482/9781641608060" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>Both Sides of the Fire Line</em></em></u></a>, told me last week.</p>
<p>With winds expected to pick up early this week, aerial firefighting operations may be grounded again. “If you have erratic, unpredictable winds to where you’ve got a gust spread of like 20 to 30 knots,” i.e. 23 to 35 miles per hour, “that becomes dangerous,” Dan Reese, a veteran firefighter and the founder and president of the International Wildfire Consulting Group, told me on Friday.</p><h3>Should I be worried about the smoke?</h3><br/><p>
	Because of the direction of the Santa Ana winds, wildfire smoke should mostly blow out to sea. But as winds shift, unhealthy air can blow into populated areas, <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/los-angeles-fires-smoke" target="_self"><u>affecting the health of residents</u></a>.
</p><p>
	Wildfire smoke is unhealthy, period, but urban and suburban smoke like that from the L.A. fires can be particularly detrimental. It’s not just trees and brush immolating in an urban fire, it’s also cars, and batteries, and gas tanks, and plastics, and insulation, and other nasty, chemical-filled things catching fire and sending fumes into the air. PM2.5, the inhalable particulates from wildfire smoke, contributes to <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/wildfire-smoke-mortality" target="_self"><u>thousands of excess deaths annually in the U.S.</u></a>

</p><h3>When will it rain?</h3><br/><p>“The bad news is, I’m not seeing any rain chances,” Drewitz, the Forest Service meteorologist, told me on Sunday.

Since October, parts of Southern California have <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/weather/article/drought-water-fire-california-20011706.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>received just 10% of their normal rainfall</u></a></p><p>This “weather whiplash” is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2025/01/09/california-fires-wet-dry-weather-conditions/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>caused by a warmer atmosphere</u></a>, which means that plants will grow explosively due to the influx of rain and then dry out when the drought returns, leaving lots of dry fuels ready and waiting for a spark. “This is really, I would argue, a signature of climate change that is going to be experienced almost everywhere people actually live on Earth,” Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who authored a new study on the pattern, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2025/01/09/california-fires-wet-dry-weather-conditions/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>told </u><u><em><em>The Washington Post</em></em></u></a>.</p><p>We know less about how climate change may affect the Santa Anas, though <a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/santa-ana-winds-climate-change?rebelltitem=2#rebelltitem2" target="_self"><u>experts have some theories</u></a>.</p><h3>What does this mean for L.A.’s housing crisis?</h3><br/><p><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/california-windstorm-fuels-pacific-palisades-wildfire-as-residents-flee-live-updates/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>At least 12,000 structures</u></a> have burned so far in the fires, which is already exacerbating the strain on the Los Angeles housing market — one of the country’s tightest even before the fires — as thousands of displaced people look for new places to live. “Dozens and dozens of people are going after the same properties,” one real estate agent <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-01-11/their-houses-burned-down-now-they-are-fighting-for-the-few-homes-left-on-the-market" target="_blank"><u>told the </u><u><em><em>Los Angeles Times</em></em></u></a>.

	The wildfires may “deal a devastating blow to [California’s] fragile home insurance market,” Heatmap’s Matthew Zeitlin <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/los-angeles-fire-insurance-fair" target="_self"><u>wrote last week</u></a>. In recent years, home insurers have left California or declined to write new policies, at least partially due to the increased risk of wildfires in the state.
</p><p>
Depending on the extent of the damage from the fires, the coffers of California’s FAIR Plan — which insures homeowners who can’t get insurance otherwise, including many in Pacific Palisades and Altadena — could empty, causing it to seek money from insurers, according to the state’s regulations. As Zeitlin writes, “This would mean that Californians who <em><em>were</em></em> able to buy private insurance — because they don’t live in a region of the state that insurers have abandoned — could be on the hook for massive wildfire losses.”
</p><h3>What’s the best way to keep up with evacuation orders?</h3><br/><p>
	First and foremost, <a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/how-to-protect-home-from-wildfire#:~:text=2.%20Sign%20up%20for%20emergency%20alerts%20(10%20minutes)" target="_self"><u>sign up for all relevant emergency alerts</u></a>.

</p><p>
<a href="https://www.watchduty.org/" target="_blank"><u>The free Watch Duty app</u></a> has become a go-to resource for people affected by the fires, including friends and family of Angelenos who may themselves be thousands of miles away.

There are also many national organizations, such as the Red Cross, that you can connect with if you want to help.
</p><p>
The City of Los Angeles and the Los Angeles Fire Department have asked that do-gooders not bring donations directly to fire stations or shelters; such actions can interfere with emergency operations.

## Who is Trump's pick to go after 'Big Tech'?

## Biden administration unveils new rules for AI chip, model exports

date: 2025-01-13, from: VOA News USA

— The Biden administration announced Monday new restrictions on the export of the most advanced artificial intelligence chips and proprietary parameters used to govern the interactions of users with AI systems.


The rule, which will undergo a 120-day period for public comments, comes in response to what administration officials described as a need to protect national security while also clarifying the rules under which companies in trusted partner countries could access the emerging technology in order to promote innovation.


“Over the coming years, AI will become really ubiquitous in every business application in every industry around the world, with enormous potential for enhanced productivity and societal, healthcare and economic benefits,” Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told reporters. “That being said, as AI becomes more powerful, the risks to our national security become even more intense.”


A senior administration official said the new rule will not include any restrictions on chip sales to Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, the United Kingdom or the United States.  


The rules build on 2023 curbs limiting the export of certain AI chips to China, a strategic competitor in the production of advanced semiconductors. Beijing attacked the new U.S. AI edict as a "flagrant violation" of international trade rules. 


China’s Ministry of Commerce said the Biden administration announcement "is another example of the generalization of the concept of national security and the abuse of export control, and a flagrant violation of international multilateral economic and trade rules." 


Beijing said it would "take necessary measures to firmly safeguard its legitimate rights and interests." 


Countries that are under U.S. arms embargoes are already subject to export restrictions on advanced AI chips, but a senior administration official said they will now be under restrictions for the transfer of the most powerful closed weight AI models.   


The weights in an AI model determine how it processes the inputs from a user and determines what to provide the user as a response, according to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration. In a closed weight system, those parameters are secret, unlike with an open weight system in which users could see the settings the model is using to make its decisions.   


Most countries — those not included in the closed partner or arms embargo lists — will not face licensing requirements for obtaining the equivalent of 1,700 of the most advanced AI chips currently available, nor for any less advanced chips.  


Companies in the United States and allied countries will not face restrictions in using the most powerful closed weight AI systems, provided they are stored under adequate security, a senior administration official said.


“I think the key point I would underscore is that we identified really some of the closest security allies of the United States that have effectively implemented and have a well-documented record of upholding a robust AI technology protection regime, and generally have technology ecosystems that promote the use of AI and other advanced technologies consistent with our national security and foreign policy interests,” a senior administration official said.

## Los Angeles firefighter loses home in Eaton Fire

date: 2025-01-13, from: VOA News USA

The deadly fires in the Los Angeles area have persisted for a week amid firefighters’ efforts to contain the infernos, which had killed at least 24 people by Sunday. Officials say more than 7,000 structures have gone up in flames in what has been called the Eaton Fire, including the home of a firefighter. VOA’s Genia Dulot met with him and his family.

## US forecasters warn of 'explosive fire growth' conditions amid deadly California wildfires

date: 2025-01-13, from: VOA News USA

Firefighters in Southern California are battling Monday to bring multiple major Los Angeles area wildfires under control as forecasters warned of renewed strong winds that could cause “explosive fire growth.”


The new wind threat, with the biggest concern extending from late Monday through Wednesday morning, is expected to bring sustained winds of 80 kph and gusts up to about 110 kph, the National Weather Service warned.


Forecasters called it a “particularly dangerous situation” and designated it as a red flag warning.


Strong winds and dry conditions in an area that has not received significant rainfall for more than eight months helped fuel the fires that have already killed at least 24 people and caused billions of dollars in damage since they began a week ago.




A brief reprieve in the winds in recent days allowed firefighters aided by air drops of water and fire retardant to make some progress in bringing the blazes under control.


Of the three major fires still burning in the Los Angeles area, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire, said Monday the Palisades Fire was 14% contained and has burned 96 square kilometers.


Eight of the deaths were attributed to the Palisades Fire in the Pacific Palisades area, officials said.


Sixteen deaths were from the Eaton Fire, located farther inland in North Pasadena and Altadena, which was 33% contained by Monday morning and has burned nearly 60 square kilometers.




Sixteen more people have been reported missing in the areas of the two fires, with officials warning that the number of fatalities is likely to increase.


Another blaze, the Hurst Fire in the Sylmar area, was 89% contained, Cal Fire said, after burning more than three square kilometers.


The ongoing blazes, along with other fires that have been contained, together have destroyed more than 12,000 structures.


In a statement, U.S. President Joe Biden said, “Our hearts ache for the 24 innocent souls we have lost in the wildfires across Los Angeles. Jill and I pray for them and their loved ones. We are deeply saddened by the devastation caused by the unprecedented ongoing wildfires across Southern California.”


Biden said he is being updated frequently on the fires and directed federal agencies to dispatch any help and equipment California authorities need.


“To the brave firefighters and first responders working day and night to suppress these fires and save lives: our nation is grateful,” Biden said. “You represent the best of America, and we are in your debt.”


About 100,000 people remained under evacuation orders late Sunday, with officials saying people would not be allowed back in fire risk areas while the new wind warnings were still in place.


Some schools that had canceled classes last week were resuming operations Monday. The National Basketball Association’s Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Clippers were also set to resume home games Monday after canceling games due to the fires. But a key National Football League playoff game involving the Los Angeles Rams set for Monday night was moved to the neighboring state of Arizona.




Local officials expressed fears that as the fires spread, they could endanger more highly populated areas and threaten some of the city’s key landmarks, including the J. Paul Getty Museum, which houses renowned artworks, and the University of California, Los Angeles, one of the top public U.S. universities.


California Governor Gavin Newsom told NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday that the wildfires could be the worst natural disaster in U.S. history, “in terms of just the costs associated with it, in terms of the scale and scope.”


A preliminary estimate by AccuWeather put the damage and economic losses so far between $135 billion and $150 billion. The damages are so high in part because much of the housing that has burned to the ground is among the costliest in the country.


Newsom called for an independent review of how the fires raged on, with firefighters at times facing a shortage of water to fight the blazes as they quickly spread out of control.


The governor said he is asking the same questions “that people out on the streets are asking, yelling about, ‘What the hell happened? What happened to the water system?’”


Newsom said he wants to know whether the water supply was simply overwhelmed, “Or were 99 mile-an-hour winds [160 kph] determinative and there was really no firefight that could've been more meaningful?”


The U.S. Defense Department said more than 1,800 California National Guard personnel have been activated to assist with the firefighting efforts and aircraft deployed to drop water and fire retardants over the raging fires.

## Here's what happened when previous US presidents tried to downsize government

date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA

President-elect Donald Trump pledges to reduce government spending when he takes office. He has tasked billionaire businessman Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who's worth an estimated $950 million, to lead the Department of Government Efficiency, a proposed presidential advisory commission. It's not a new concept. U.S. leaders have tried to reduce the role of government since the founding of the republic.

## Philadelphia 76ers won't build disputed $1.3B downtown stadium

date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA

Philadelphia, Pennsylvania — The Philadelphia 76ers have decided not to build a $1.3 billion downtown arena, a surprising move that comes just weeks after the team received approval for the controversial project from the city council.


The Philadelphia Inquirer reported Sunday that multiple council members had confirmed the change in plans. The team has struck a deal with Comcast Spectacor to remain in the city's sports stadium district, the newspaper said, but further details about the new proposal have not been released.


The 76ers, the mayor's office and Comcast Spectacor — which owns the Wells Fargo Center, where the team currently plays — did not respond Sunday to requests for comment. The team rents the arena from Comcast Spectacor, which also owns the Philadelphia Flyers of the NHL, who also play there.


The council had voted on Dec. 19 to approve the downtown arena after more than two years of heated debate over the proposal, and the owners of the NBA team had hoped to move into what would be called 76 Place by 2031. The council vote came despite vocal opposition from nearby Chinatown residents and other activists.


“I’m so livid right now I don’t even know what to do,” Jimmy Harrity, an at-large member of the council, told the newspaper. Harrity, who supported the team’s move, said, “I feel as though I was used as a pawn.”


Mayor Cherelle Parker, a Democrat who had championed the plan, has said the entire city will benefit from what she called a “historic game-changing economic development project.” Supporters had hoped the 18,500-seat arena would help revive a distressed retail corridor called Market East, which runs from City Hall to the Liberty Bell. The area has struggled for years despite several redevelopment efforts.


The team owners, Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment, had pushed for city approval by year’s end so they could meet their target opening date. They had vowed not to ask the city for any construction funding, although they were free to seek state and federal funds. Instead of property taxes, they would have paid about $6 million in annual payments in lieu of taxes.


Opponents feared the arena would bring gridlock on game days as well as gentrification and rising rents to the area.


The Chinatown community has fought a series of proposed developments since the 1960s, including casinos, a prison, a baseball stadium and a highway, the last of which dissected the neighborhood when it opened in 1991.

## Los Angeles wildfires rage on despite added firefighting resources

## Fires burn Los Angeles schools, destroy outdoor education sanctuaries

date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA

For Irina Contreras, a program manager for Los Angeles County's Department of Arts and Culture, outdoor education was a refuge for both her and her daughter during the pandemic.


Now, much of that refuge has been burned in the raging wildfires around Los Angeles.


Her 7-year-old daughter, Ceiba, hikes with a kid's adventure group called Hawks and attended Matilija, a bilingual forest school for preschool and kindergarten. Rain or shine, she and her friends would spend their days climbing, jumping, hiking, and swimming in places like Eaton Canyon Nature Area, a 77-hectare (190-acre) preserve near Altadena, now destroyed by fire.


Ceiba learned to ask plants for permission before taking samples to glue into her nature journal. Once, her group discovered a hidden path that led behind a waterfall. Ceiba couldn't stop talking about it for days.


For parents like Contreras, the wildfires have been devastating not just because of the loss of life and thousands of homes. They are mourning natural and educational areas that served as sanctuaries and learning spaces for local families, especially in the years since the pandemic. The fires have torn through natural areas that served every type of educational setting: public and private schools, nature-based preschools, homeschool groups, summer camps and more.


"It's about so much more than what she's been learning," Contreras said. "I can speak with absolute confidence that it totally affected me, personally."


The fires have burned school buildings, too, including Odyssey Charter School in Altadena, which Miguel Ordenana's children attend.


"The community has been devastated by the fire," said Ordenana, senior manager of community science at the Natural History Museum. "It's been a challenge to carefully share that news with my children and help them work through their emotions. A lot of their friends lost their homes. And we don't know the impact to school staff, like their teachers, but a lot of them live in that area as well and have lost their homes."


Some areas untouched by fire were inaccessible because of poor air quality. Griffith Park, home of the Hollywood sign, had not been affected by the end of the week but it's not clear when the air quality there will be good enough to resume outdoor programs, said Ordenana, who was the first to capture on camera a late puma in the nearby area that gained fame under the name P-22.


Ordenana said his family was able to connect with some other families from Odyssey Charter School for pizza and an indoor playdate, but he is uncertain what the days will look like for them with school closures already extending through next week.


All schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District, the nation's second largest, were closed Friday because of heavy smoke and ash over the city. Classes will not resume until conditions improve, officials said. Pasadena Unified School District also closed schools and several of its campuses sustained damage, including Eliot Arts Magnet Middle School.


The California Department of Education released a statement Wednesday saying 335 schools from Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Riverside, Ventura, and San Diego counties were closed. It was unclear how many would be closed Monday.


During the pandemic, Contreras felt like she was stuck on a screen. She devoted much of her energy to working, writing and organizing, but her daughter's outdoor education helped her better understand the value of stepping away from the grind.


Contreras feels confident the outdoor programs will return, although it's unclear when it will be safe for people to hike around areas like Eaton Canyon.


"The nature center is gone," Richard Smart, superintendent of the Eaton Canyon Natural Area in Pasadena, said Thursday. "The wildflowers, the shrubs are gone." The park hosted dozens of school field trips a year and Smart estimates more than a thousand students visited yearly.


"Teachers liked it because it was also free, it was local, it was nearby. And it was a place to see nature — wild nature but also in a friendly, safe environment," he said.


Only a few exterior walls of the Eaton Canyon Nature Center were left standing, he said.


"For many of the local school districts, we truly were in their backyard, and now they won't be able to use it for the foreseeable future," he said. "The park is such a touchstone for people in the community, and so to lose that is just, devastating is not even the right word. It feels indescribable."


Many parents and teachers are likely wondering what to do and where to take their children as fires continue to burn across Los Angeles, said Lila Higgins, a senior manager for community science at the Natural History Museum and author of "Wild L.A," a field trip and nature guidebook.


A certified forest therapy guide, Higgins says time in nature lowers heart rates, lowers blood pressure and helps children with attention deficit disorder feel more calm and relaxed.


"For children's cognitive development, time in nature and time spent connecting with nature is so important," Higgins said. Outdoor spaces also can help children learn how to develop relationships through connections with animals, understand orientation through space by following trails and map-reading and understand human impact on wildlife.


"A lot of the places that we're talking about are really popular with homeschoolers, but they also are a destination for some field trips, certainly places like Eaton Canyon," said Greg Pauly, co-author of "Wild L.A." and director of the Urban Nature Research Center at the museum. "I do think it's safe to say that people are going to continue to be interacting with those landscapes and it will hopefully still be a field trip destination in the future. But it's certainly going to be a while before that happens."


"This is the reality of modern Southern California," he said. "Fire changes the landscape and people's lives shockingly often."

## California wildfires could be leaving deeper inequality in their wake

date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA

ALTADENA, Calif. — The sight of celebrity mansions and movie landmarks reduced to ashes can make it seem like the wildfires roaring through the Los Angeles area affected a constellation of movie stars. 


But a drive through the charred neighborhoods around Altadena shows that the fires also burned through a remarkable haven for generations of Black families avoiding discriminatory housing practices elsewhere. They have been communities of racial and economic diversity, where many people own their own homes. 


Some now fear the most destructive fires in California's history have altered that for good. Recovery and rebuilding may be out of reach for many, and pressures of gentrification could be renewed. 




Samantha Santoro, 22, a first-generation college student at Cal Poly Pomona, remembered being annoyed when the initial news coverage of the wildfires focused more on celebrities. She and her sister, who attends UC Berkeley, worry how their Mexican immigrant parents and working-class neighbors who lost their homes in Altadena will move forward. 


"We don't have like, 'Oh, I'll just go to my second home and stay there,'" Santoro said. 


The landlord of their family's two-bedroom house with a pool had never increased the $1,650 rent, making it possible for the Santoros to affordably raise their daughters. Now, they're temporarily staying with a relative in Pasadena. The family has renters insurance but not much else. 


"I think it's hard to believe that you have nothing," Santoro said, through tears, thinking of her parents. "Everything that they ever worked for was in that house." 


Altadena had been a mix of tiny bungalows and magnificent mansions. The community of 42,000 includes blue-collar families, artists, entertainment industry workers and white-collar ones. About 58% of residents are non-white, with one-fourth of them Hispanic and nearly a fifth Black, according to Census data. 




During the Civil Rights era, Altadena became a rare land of opportunity for Black Americans to reach middle class without the discriminatory practices of denying them access to credit. They kept homes within the family and helped others to flourish. Today, the Black home ownership rate there is at 81.5%, almost double the national rate. 


That's impressive considering 92% of the 15,000 residences in Altadena are single-family homes, according to the 2023 Census American Community Survey. The median income is over $129,000. Just over 7% of residents live in poverty. 


Victoria Knapp, chair of the Altadena Town Council, worries that the fires have irreparably changed the landscape for these families. 


"Someone is going to buy it and develop who knows what on it. And that is going to change the character of Altadena," Knapp said, adding that those with fewer resources will be disproportionately hurt. 


The family of Kenneth Snowden, 57, was one of the Black families able to purchase a home in 1962. That house, as well as the one Snowden bought almost 20 years ago, are both gone. 


He is challenging state and federal officials to help all fire-affected communities fairly because "your $40 million home is no different than my $2 million home." 


Snowden wants the ability to acquire home loans with 0% interest. "Give us the ability to rebuild, restart our lives," he said. "If you can spend billions of dollars fighting a war, you can spend a billion dollars to help us get back where we were at." 


Shawn Brown lost not only her home but also the public charter school she founded in Altadena. She had a message for fellow Black homeowners who might be tempted with offers for their property: "I would tell them to stand strong, rebuild, continue the generational progress of African Americans." 


She and other staff at Pasadena Rosebud Academy are trying to raise money to rebuild while looking at temporary sites in churches. 




But even some churches have burned. At Altadena Baptist Church, the bell tower is pretty much the only thing still standing. 


The Rev. George Van Alstine and others are trying to help more than 10 church members who lost homes with needs like navigating insurance and federal aid. The pastor is worried the fires will lead to gentrification, with Black parishioners, who make up half the congregation, paying the price. 


"We're seeing a number of families who are probably going to have to move out of the area because rebuilding in Altadena will be too expensive for them," he said. 


The 32-year-old photographer Daniela Dawson, who had been working two jobs to meet the $2,200 rent for her studio apartment, fled the wildfires with her Hyundai SUV and her cat, Lola. She lost almost everything else, including thousands of dollars of photography gear. 


She did not have renter's insurance. "Obviously now I'm thinking about it. Wish I had it," she said. 


Dawson plans to return to Arizona, where she lived previously, and regroup. But she likely won't be returning to Altadena.

## 'Den of Thieves 2' is No. 1 at box office as 'Better Man' flops

date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA

New York — On a quiet weekend in movie theaters, while much of Hollywood’s attention was on the wildfires that continue to rage in Los Angeles, Lionsgate’s “Den of Thieves 2: Pantera” debuted atop the box office with $15.5 million, according to studio estimates Sunday.


Mid-January is often a slow moviegoing period, and that was slightly exacerbated by the closures of about 10 theaters in Los Angeles, the country’s top box-office market.


A sequel to the Gerard Butler 2018 heist thriller, “Den of Thieves 2” performed similarly to the original. The first installment, released by STX, opened with $15.2 million seven years ago. O’Shea Jackson Jr. co-stars in the sequel, which debuted in 3,008 North American theaters.


Butler's films are becoming something of a regular feature in January. He also starred in “Plane,” which managed $32.1 million after launching on Jan. 13 in 2023.


“Den of Thieves 2,” made for about $40 million, was a bit more costly to make. Audiences liked it well enough, giving it a “B+” CinemaScore. Reviews (58% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) weren’t particularly good. But it counted as Lionsgate’s first No.1 opening since “The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes” in November 2023.


Also entering wide release over the weekend was the Robbie Williams movie “Better Man,” one of the more audacious spins on the music biopic in recent years. Rather than going the more tradition routes of Elton John (“Rocketman”) or Elvis Presley (“Elvis”), the British popstar is portrayed by a CGI chimpanzee in Michael Gracey’s film.


The Paramount Pictures release, produced for $110 million and acquired by Paramount for $25 million, didn’t catch on much better than Williams’ previous forays into the United States. It tanked, with $1.1 million in ticket sales from 1,291 locations. Gracey’s previous feature, 2017’s “The Greatest Showman” ($459 million worldwide), fared far better in theaters. Reviews, however, have been very good for “Better Man.”


It was bested by “The Last Showgirl,” the Las Vegas drama starring Pamela Anderson. The Roadside Attractions release expanded to 870 theaters and collected $1.5 million.


Also outdoing “Better Man” was Brady Corbet’s “The Brutalist.” Coming off winning best drama at the Golden Globes, the A24 postwar epic grossed a hefty $1.4 million from just 68 locations. It will expand wider in the coming weeks.


The weekend's lion share of business went to holiday holdovers, including “Mufasa: The Lion King,” “Sonic the Hedgehog 3,” “Nosferatu” and “Moana 2.”


In its fourth week of release, Barry Jenkins “Mufasa” continued to do well, adding $13.2 million to bring its total to $539.7 million worldwide. Also on its fourth weekend, “Sonic the Hedgehog 3” padded its $384.8 million global total with $11 million. Robert Eggers’ “Nosferatu,” the surprise hit of the Christmas period, collected $6.8 million in ticket sales, bringing the vampire tale to $81.1 million domestically.


The Walt Disney Co.’s “Moana 2,” in its seventh week of release, added $6.5 million to bring its global tally to $989.8 million. In the coming days, it will become the third Disney film released in 2024 to notch $1 billion, joining “Inside Out 2” and “Deadpool and Wolverine.”


Final domestic figures will be released Monday. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore:


1. “Den of Thieves 2: Pantera,” $15.5 million.


2. “Mufasa: The Lion King,” $13.2 million.


3. “Sonic the Hedgehog 3,” $11 million.


4. “Nosferatu,” $6.8 million.


5. “Moana 2,” $6.5 million.


6. “A Complete Unknown,” $5 million.


7. “Wicked,” $5 million.


8. “Babygirl,” $3.1 million.


9. “Game Changer,” $1.9 million.


10. “The Last Showgirl,” $1.5 million.

## Vance: Jan. 6 participants who committed violence 'obviously' shouldn't be pardoned

date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Vice President-elect JD Vance says people responsible for the violence during the Capitol riot "obviously" should not be pardoned, as President-elect Donald Trump is promising to use his clemency power on behalf of many of those who tried on Jan. 6, 2021, to overturn the results of the election that Trump lost. 


Vance insisted in an interview on "Fox News Sunday" that the pardon question is "very simple," saying those who "protested peacefully" should be pardoned and "if you committed violence on that day, obviously you shouldn't be pardoned." He later said there was a "bit of a gray area" in some cases. 


More than 1,500 people have been charged with federal crimes stemming from the siege that left more than 100 police officers injured and sent lawmakers running into hiding as they met to certify Democrat Joe Biden's 2020 victory. 


Hundreds of people who did not engage in destruction or violence were charged only with misdemeanor offenses for illegally entering the Capitol. Others were charged with felony offenses, including assault for beating police officers.


Leaders of the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys extremist groups were convicted of seditious conspiracy for what prosecutors described as plots to use violence to stop the peaceful transfer of power from Trump, the Republican incumbent, to Biden. 


In a post on X, Vance responded to criticism from supporters of the Capitol rioters that his position did not go far enough to free all convicted. "I've been defending these guys for years," he said. 


"The president saying he'll look at each case (and me saying the same) is not some walkback," Vance said. "I assure you, we care about people unjustly locked up. Yes, that includes people provoked and it includes people who got a garbage trial."

## Los Angeles fires death toll rises to at least 24

date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA

The death toll in the wildfires that are raging in the Los Angeles area rose to at least 24 late Sunday, with officials worried that more bodies will be found by searchers and cadaver dogs in the neighborhoods that have been leveled by the blazes. 


Roaring flames continued to ravage the West Coast state of California as the top U.S. emergency official warned that increasing winds could pose new threats in the coming days.


“The winds are potentially getting stronger and dangerous,” Deanne Criswell, the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, told CNN’s “State of the Union” show. “You never know which way they’re going.”


Local officials expressed fears that as the fires spread, they could endanger more highly populated areas and threaten some of the city’s key landmarks, including the J. Paul Getty Museum, which houses renowned art works, and the University of California, Los Angeles, one of the top public U.S. universities.

 




California Senator Adam Schiff told CNN that driving through the devastated communities “frankly reminded me of visiting war zones. There are whole neighborhoods that are gone. We haven’t seen this before.”


“The heartbreak is just overwhelming,” he said. 


California Governor Gavin Newsom told NBC’s “Meet the Press” that the wildfires could be the worst natural disaster in U.S. history, “in terms of just the costs associated with it, in terms of the scale and scope.” 


A preliminary estimate by AccuWeather put the damage and economic losses so far between $135 billion and $150 billion. The damages are so high in part because much of the housing that has burned to the ground is among the costliest in the country. 


Watch related report by Veronica Balderas Iglesias:




Newsom called for an independent review of how the fires raged on, with firefighters at times facing a shortage of water to fight the blazes as they quickly spread out of control.


The governor said he is asking the same questions “that people out on the streets are asking, yelling about, ‘What the hell happened? What happened to the water system?’

Newsom said he wants to know whether the water supply was simply overwhelmed, “Or were 99 mile-an-hour winds determinative and there was really no firefight that could've been more meaningful?”


“All of us want to know those answers, and I just don't want to wait because people are asking me. I want to know those facts,” he said. “I want them objectively determined, and let the chips fall where they may. This is not about finger pointing.”




The governor said he is asking the same questions “that people out on the streets are asking, yelling about, ‘What the hell happened? What happened to the water system?’


Newsom on Friday ordered state officials to determine why a 440-million-liter reservoir was out of service and some hydrants had run dry.


Firefighters raced Saturday to get in front of the largest and most destructive blaze burning in Los Angeles as it shifted directions and grew by about 400 hectares. The Santa Ana winds that fueled the blazes are forecast to return. 


“We need to be aggressive out there,” California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) Operations Chief Christian Litz told reporters at a Saturday briefing. 




The National Weather Service predicted winds picking up Saturday night into Sunday morning in the area and again late Monday through Tuesday morning, with sustained winds up to 48 kph and gusts up to 112 kph.


Four active fires in the Los Angeles region have burned more than 16,000 hectares, with flames destroying more than 12,000 structures. About 150,000 people have been ordered to evacuate their homes, with 700 people taking refuge in nine shelters. The causes of all four blazes remain under investigation.




Officials said two of the fires were 90- and 76% contained but the other two only 11- and 15%. The Palisades fire, the largest and only 11% contained, is threatening to jump over a major highway, Interstate 405, into a more heavily populated area.


Jim Hudson, a Cal Fire incident commander, told reporters that firefighters have three priorities: “Life, your property and permanent control” of the flames.


Firefighting crews from California and nine other states are part of the ongoing response that includes 1,354 fire engines, 84 aircraft and more than 14,000 personnel, including newly arrived firefighters from Mexico.

## Court ruling will help New Mexico stay a go-to state for women seeking abortions

date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA

SANTA FE, NEW MEXICO — The New Mexico Supreme Court on Thursday struck down abortion restrictions by conservative cities and counties, helping to ensure the state remains a go-to destination for people from other states with bans.


The unanimous opinion, in response to a request from state Attorney General Raúl Torrez, reinforces the state's position as having some of the most liberal abortion laws in the country.


Attorneys representing the cities of Hobbs and Clovis and Lea and Roosevelt counties had argued that provisions of a federal "anti-vice" law known as the Comstock Act block courts from striking down local abortion ordinances.


But Justice C. Shannon Bacon, writing for the majority opinion, said state law precludes cities and counties from restricting abortion or regulating abortion clinics.


"The ordinances violate this core precept and invade the Legislature's authority to regulate access to and provision of reproductive healthcare," she wrote. "We hold the ordinances are preempted in their entirety."


New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez praised the court's ruling Thursday, saying that the core of the argument was that state laws preempted any action by local governments to engage in activities that would infringe on the constitutional rights of citizens.


"The bottom line is simply this: Abortion access is safe and secure in New Mexico," he said. "It's enshrined in law by the recent ruling by the New Mexico Supreme Court and thanks to the work of the New Mexico Legislature."




New Mexico House Speaker Javier Martínez called access to health care a basic fundamental right in New Mexico.


"It doesn't take a genius to understand the statutory framework that we have. Local governments don't regulate health care in New Mexico. It is up to the state," the Albuquerque Democrat said.


Opposition to abortion runs deep in New Mexico communities along the border with Texas, which has one of the most restrictive bans in the U.S.


But Democrats, who control every statewide elected office in New Mexico and hold majorities in the state House and Senate, have moved to shore up access to abortion — before and after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, eliminating the nationwide right to abortion.


In 2021, the New Mexico Legislature repealed a dormant 1969 statute that outlawed most abortion procedures as felonies, ensuring access to abortion even after the Roe v. Wade reversal.


And in 2023, Democratic New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed a bill that overrides local ordinances aimed at limiting abortion access and enacted a shield law that protects abortion providers from investigations by other states.


In September, construction began on a state-funded reproductive health and abortion clinic in southern New Mexico that will cater to local residents and people who travel from neighboring states.


The new clinic is scheduled for completion by early 2026 to provide services ranging from medical and procedural abortions to contraception, cervical cancer screenings and education about adoptions.


In Thursday's opinion, justices said they "strongly admonish" Roosevelt County, in particular, for an ordinance that would have allowed individuals to file lawsuits demanding damages of more than $100,000 for violations of the county's abortion ordinance.


The provision would have created "a private right of action and damages award that is clearly intended to punish protected conduct," the court said in its opinion.


Erin Hawley, a vice president at Alliance Defending Freedom, an Arizona-based Christian legal advocacy group, is an attorney who argued on behalf of Roosevelt County in the case. On Thursday, she criticized the court's decision and emphasized its limitations.


"Roosevelt County and other New Mexico localities should be able to enforce ordinances that comply with federal law and protect the lives of their citizens," said Hawley, the wife of U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri. "We're grateful that the New Mexico Supreme Court did not abandon common sense and find a so-called right to abortion in the state constitution."


It was not immediately clear whether the ruling can be appealed in federal court or influence broader efforts to apply Comstock Act restrictions on abortion. The New Mexico Supreme Court opinion explicitly declined to address conflicts with federal law, basing its decision solely on state provisions.


Austin, Texas-based attorney Jonathan Mitchell, a former Texas solicitor general and architect of that state's strict abortion ban, said he looked forward "to litigating these issues in other states and bringing the meaning of the federal Comstock Act to the Supreme Court of the United States."

## Scarves over headscarves, Muslim women's outdoors group tackles snow tubing in Minnesota

date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA

MAPLE GROVE, Minnesota — Ice crystals clung to the eyelashes, parka hood, beanie hat and headscarf of Ruqayah Nasser as she took a break after her first-ever snow tubing runs in a Minnesota park on a -18 Celsius January morning.


She had joined two dozen other members of a group founded by a Somali-American mother in Minneapolis to promote all-seasons activities among Muslim women, who might otherwise feel singled out in the great outdoors, especially when wearing hijabs.


"They understand my lifestyle. I don't have to explain myself," said Nasser, who recently moved to the Twin Cities from Chicago and whose family hails from Yemen. "My religion is everything. It's my survival kit."


As one of the most visible signs of the Muslim faith, hijabs often attract controversy. Within Islam, some women want to wear the headscarves for piety and modesty, while others oppose them as a symbol of oppression. In the sports world, including in the last Olympics, devout athletes have often faced extra hurdles on and off the field in finding accommodations for religious practices.


Concerned about safety as a woman — particularly one wearing a head covering — but determined to get outdoors to beat seasonal depression, Nasrieen Habib put out a social media post about creating a hiking group three years ago.


From the nine women who responded, her Amanah Rec Project has grown to more than 700 members. There's a core group for Muslim women only — for "more sisterhood and modesty," Habib says — as well as a group for families. In addition to weekly outings, they organize longer trips and education on everything from appropriate winter clothing — a challenge for many migrant communities — to health and environmental sustainability from the perspective of Islam.


"It's a way to live your whole life according to a set of beliefs and rules. And part of those beliefs and rules is taking care of creation," Habib said as her 4-year-old son took a break from tubing in a toasty chalet at Elm Creek Park Reserve near Minneapolis. "How can we be more sustainable in a time where we see the impact of climate change, especially impacting people who look like us in the Global South?"




Two sisters, Ruun Mahamud and Nawal Hirsi, moved to the United States from Somalia as children about two decades ago.


They found a safe haven in Minnesota where, since the late 1990s, growing numbers of East African refugees have created an increasingly vocal Muslim community. Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar was the first lawmaker to wear a hijab while on the U.S. House floor, and Minneapolis was the first large city in the United States to allow the Islamic call to prayer to be broadcast publicly by its two dozen mosques.


Even though she feels "safe and accepted" in her hijab, Hirsi joined the group for extra support.


"I love being outdoors and joining this group has made me more comfortable to participate," she said on the tubing hill, where she had convinced Mahamud to come along for the first time.


"Oh my gosh, it's the most amazing thing I've ever done," Mahamud gushed after speeding downhill on a tube attached to her sister's as their daughters recorded the adventure on their phones.


The sisters said it's important to include love for the outdoors and physical activity in their children's religious upbringing.


"Taking care of one's health is part of our faith," Hirsi said.


Muslim women who wear hijabs can face multiple barriers to sports participation, said Umer Hussain, a Wilkes University professor who studies religion and sports. They range from activities where genders mix or head coverings pose logistical hurdles to conservative families who might frown on it.


Groups like Habib's tackle empowering women in their communities as well as raising awareness about religious accommodations like single-sex spaces or locations for prayer.


"The biggest barrier, for women specifically, is having access to spaces that allow us to practice our religion while keeping our modesty and abiding by the Islamic laws that tell us we are not supposed to be in mixed spaces without covering up," Habib said.


She appears to have tapped into a great demand.


"When she told me she was going to start a hiking group to get sisters out in nature … it was like actually something I've been looking for for a very long time," Makiya Amin said as she climbed up the tubing hill in a long white skirt, bright-red headscarf, and heavy winter coat. "I didn't really have those type of people who were outdoorsy already around me."


Isho Mohamed joined the group for the wide-ranging conversations as much as for the outdoors, which as a self-described "homebody" she had largely avoided since college days.


"It's a safe space that takes me out of my comfort zone," she said of the group outings. During them, the women share about work experiences but also life as immigrants and, most importantly, their faith.


"We also talk about spiritual connection and connecting with God as well, and just say a little prayer here and there when we're walking," Mohamed added.


Her cheeks glowing above her ski mask after two hours on the hill, Jorida Latifi was with her 7-year-old son among the last to hang up their snow tubes. Originally from Albania, Latifi has gone out with the group almost weekly since joining more than a year ago.


"With Muslim sisters … they do understand you, what you go through, even with the clothing and hijabs," Latifi said. "It feels way, way more like, you know, where you are with family."

## Biden honors Pope Francis with the Presidential Medal of Freedom

date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden on Saturday honored Pope Francis with the Presidential Medal of Freedom with distinction, the highest civilian award given by the president, saying the pontiff was "a light of faith, hope, and love that shines brightly across the world."


Biden had been scheduled to present the medal to the pope in person on Saturday in Rome on what was to be the final overseas trip of his presidency, but Biden canceled his travel plans so he could monitor the wildfires in California.


The White House said Biden bestowed the award to the pope during a phone call in which they also discussed efforts to promote peace and alleviate suffering around the world.


It's the only time Biden has presented the honor with distinction during his presidency. Biden himself is a recipient of the award with distinction, recognized when he was vice president by then-President Barack Obama in a surprise ceremony eight years ago. That was the only time in Obama's two terms that he awarded that version of the medal.


The citation for the pope says "his mission of serving the poor has never ceased. A loving pastor, he joyfully answers children's questions about God. A challenging teacher, he commands us to fight for peace and protect the planet. A welcoming leader, he reaches out to different faiths."


Biden is preparing to leave office Jan. 20 and has doled out honors to prominent individuals, including supporters and allies, in recent weeks.

## Blue Origin set for 1st launch of New Glenn rocket

date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA

CAPE CANAVERAL — A quarter of a century after its founding, Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin is finally ready for its maiden orbital voyage with a brand-new rocket the company hopes will shake up the commercial space race.


The launch initially scheduled for Sunday was pushed back a day due to "unfavorable" sea conditions, Blue Origin posted on X.


Named New Glenn after legendary astronaut John Glenn — the first American to orbit Earth in 1962 — the rocket stands 320 feet (98 meters) tall, roughly equivalent to a 32-story building — and is set to blast off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in a launch window that opens at 1 a.m. (0600 GMT) Monday.


"Pointy end up!" the company's CEO, Dave Limp posted on X alongside photos of the gleaming white behemoth.


With the mission, dubbed NG-1, Bezos, the world's second-richest man, is taking direct aim at the world's wealthiest: Elon Musk, whose company SpaceX dominates the orbital launch market through its Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets.


These serve the commercial sector, the Pentagon, and NASA — including, crucially, ferrying astronauts to and from the International Space Station.


"SpaceX has for the past several years been pretty much the only game in town and so having a competitor... this is great," G. Scott Hubbard, a retired senior NASA official, told AFP.


SpaceX, meanwhile, is planning the next orbital test of Starship — its gargantuan new-generation rocket — the same day, upping the sense of high-stakes rivalry.


If all goes to plan, shortly after launch, Blue Origin will attempt to land the first-stage booster on a drone ship named Jacklyn, in honor of Bezos' mother, stationed about 620 miles (1,000 kilometers) downrange in the Atlantic Ocean.


Though SpaceX makes such landings a near-routine spectacle, this will be Blue Origin's first shot at a touchdown on the high seas.


Meanwhile, the rocket's upper stage will fire its engines toward Earth orbit, carrying a Defense Department-funded prototype spaceship called Blue Ring, which will remain aboard for the roughly six-hour test flight.


Limp emphasized that simply reaching orbit is the prime goal, while successfully recovering the booster would be a welcome "bonus."


Blue Origin does have experience landing its New Shepard rockets — used for suborbital tourism — but they are much smaller and land on terra firma rather than a ship at sea.


Blue Origin has secured a NASA contract to launch two Mars probes aboard New Glenn. The rocket will also support the deployment of Project Kuiper, a satellite internet constellation designed to compete with Starlink.


Like Musk, Bezos has a lifelong passion for space. But whereas Musk dreams of colonizing Mars, Bezos envisions shifting heavy industry off-planet onto floating space platforms to preserve Earth, "humanity's blue origin."


He founded Blue Origin in 2000 — two years before Musk created SpaceX — but has adopted a more cautious pace, in contrast to his rival's "fail fast, learn fast" philosophy.


"There's been impatience within the space community over Blue Origin's very deliberate approach," Scott Pace, a space policy analyst at George Washington University and former member of the National Space Council, told AFP.


If New Glenn succeeds, Pace added, it will give the U.S. government "dissimilar redundancy" — valuable backup if one system fails.

## Trump prosecutor Jack Smith resigns from US Justice Department

date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA

U.S. Special Counsel Jack Smith, who led the federal cases against Donald Trump on charges of trying to overturn his 2020 election defeat and mishandling of classified documents, has resigned, as the Republican president-elect prepares to return to the White House. 


Smith resigned Friday from the Department of Justice, according to a court filing on Saturday to U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, asking her to lift a court order she issued blocking the release of his final report.  


Notice of Smith's resignation came in a footnote in the filing, which said the Special Counsel had completed his work, submitted his final confidential report on January 7, and "separated" from the Justice Department on January 10.  


A former war crimes prosecutor, Smith brought two of the four criminal cases Trump faced after leaving office, but saw them grind to a halt after a Trump-appointed judge in Florida dismissed one and the U.S. Supreme Court — with three justices appointed by Trump — found that former presidents have sweeping immunity from prosecution for official acts. Neither case went to trial. 


After Trump defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in the November 5 election, Smith dropped both cases, citing a longstanding Justice Department rule against prosecuting sitting presidents. In asking courts to dismiss the charges, Smith's team defended the merits of the cases they had brought, signaling that only Trump's impending return to the White House made them untenable.  


Smith's departure is another marker of the collapse of the criminal cases against Trump, which could end without any legal consequences for the incoming president and sparked a backlash that helped fuel his political comeback. 


Smith's resignation from the Justice Department was expected. Trump, who has frequently called Smith "deranged" had said he would fire him immediately upon taking office on January 20, and has suggested that he may pursue retribution against Smith and others who investigated him once he returns to office. 


Trump in 2023 became the first sitting or former U.S. president to face criminal prosecution, first in New York, where he was charged with trying to cover up a hush money payment to a porn star during his 2016 presidential campaign. Smith's charges followed, accusing Trump of illegally retaining classified material after leaving office and of trying to overturn his 2020 loss, a campaign that sparked the January 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol. Prosecutors in Georgia also charged Trump over his efforts to overturn his election defeat in that state. 


Trump denied wrongdoing and assailed the prosecutions as politically motivated attempts to damage his campaign. He raised millions in campaign contributions from courthouse appearances and used the cases to drive a powerful narrative that the political establishment was arrayed against him and his supporters. 


The Justice Department defended the cases, saying they were run by career prosecutors who operated free of political influence.
