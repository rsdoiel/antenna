even at this distance. One of the more beautiful effects of this
presence are the auroras which light up the sky in the Northern and
Southern polar regions. These displays, also called the Northern and

from the Sun and the molecules in the atmosphere above Earth’s

<h2 id="two-weeks-of-wayback-first-alpha-release-in-a-few-weeks">Two
weeks of Wayback: first alpha release in a few weeks</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>Alpine Linux maintainer Ariadne Conill only started working on
Wayback a few weeks ago, but in a blog post today they dive into a few
more details about how much progress has already been achieved. To
refresh your memory, Wayback allows you to run a legacy X11-based
desktop environment on top of Wayland by running a stub Wayland
compositor in front of Xwayland, capable of serving as a full X server.
This way, the transition to Wayland and the removal of X.org from
popular distributions won’t mean you can’t run X11-based desktop
environments anymore. Within just a few weeks, the project has made
serious progress. There’s a lot still left to do before we can
confidently say that Wayback is ready for distributions to switch to.
This work is across the stack: Wayback still needs to expose surfaces
that Xwayland can use, Xwayland needs to implement a few new features
such as cursor warping and some X extensions inside Xwayland itself need
to be properly plumbed (such as Xinerama being able to make use of the
Wayland output layout data). Longer term goals aside, we are at most a
few weeks away from the first alpha-quality release of Wayback. The main
focus of this release is to get to a point where enough is working that
users with basic setups and requirements can be reasonably served by
Wayback in place of the X.org server, to allow for further testing. It’s
already to a point where I am daily driving it. ↫ Ariadne Conill Of
course, there’s still tons of bugs to figure out and missing
functionality to implement, but the fact that they’re just weeks away
from a first alpha release is honestly impressive. I really hope Wayback
picks up even more and gets adopted by other distributions as well,
since it’s such an elegant and future-proof solution to a very real
problem. It’s important that desktop environments that will not or
cannot transition to Wayland remain available to Linux users regardless
of their choice of Wayland or X11. When facing the slow sunsetting of a
windowing system, some people go off on deranged neofascist conspiracy
rants against the woke illuminati, while others sit down and develop
real forward-looking solutions. I’m glad virtually every Linux
distribution that matters trusts the latter over the former.</p>

finally overtakes Windows 10’s user share</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>As of today, Stat Counter reports that Windows 11 now has 50.88% of
the Windows market, with Windows 10 dropping to 46.2%, giving it a
comfortable lead over its predecessor. Windows 11 has been on the market
since 2021 but had only amassed less than 10% of the market by 2022.
It’s been a slow but steady climb since then, growing from 18% to 28% in
2023, with similar growth to 36% in 2024. It’s this year where Windows
11 really started taking off, likely aided by the fact that Microsoft is
now pushing Windows 10’s end of support hard. ↫ Zac Bowden at Windows
Central Up to 50% of all Windows users, mere months before Windows 10 is
no longer supported, and it took them 4 years to get here. Windows users
really don’t like Windows 11, do they?</p>

<h2 id="microsoft-broke-windows-update-on-windows-7-again">Microsoft
broke Windows Update on Windows 7 (again)</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>The developers of Legacy Update, the tool that allows users of older
Windows versions to keep downloading updates from Microsoft, recently
discovered that users of the tool on Windows 7 were having issues. After
doing some debugging they figured out it was DNS it was an expired
Microsoft certificate. This certificate was set to expire on 1 July
2025, and when it did, nobody at Microsoft bothered to correct it until
a few days later. As you can see from &amp;lt;ExpiryDate&gt;, it
definitely stopped working because the expiry date lapsed. As seems to
happen too often in our industry, apparently nobody set a reminder to
make sure it would be updated in advance of the date. You might notice
that it has an &amp;lt;IssuedDate&gt; of 2017-12-01. That’s fairly
recent! After digging further, we learned that this already happened
once! On the 4th of that month, Bleeping Computer covered an error
Windows 7 users were receiving when checking for updates. That error
is 80248015 – pretty familiar, right? Microsoft allowed this file to
expire, not on the 1st but rather on the 4th (more specifically, 35
seconds before midnight in US Pacific time, or 8:00 PM UTC), and did not
manage to upload a new file until the 6th at 10:02 AM Pacific (6:02 PM
UTC). This left Microsoft Update broken for 3 days. ↫ Adam Demasi
Microsoft moved the expiry date up to 2033, thereby fixing the problem.
Legacy Update’s developer Adam Demasi expected that once 2033 comes
around, Legacy Update will probably have to add Widnows 7 to its proxy
server that it’s already using for older versions, as improvements in
TLS and ciphers will probably lock Windows 7 out of Windows Update
definitively. But hey, 2033 is decades away. Right?</p>

<p>With macOS 26, Apple has announced a dramatically new look to their
UI: Liquid Glass. Solid material icon elements give way to softer,
shinier, glassier icons. The rounded rectangle became slightly more
rounded, and Apple eliminated the ability for icon elements to extend
beyond the icon rectangle (as seen in the current icons for GarageBand,
Photo Booth, Dictionary, etc.). With this release being one of the most
dramatic visual overhauls of macOS’s design, I wanted to begin a
collection chronicling the evolution of the system icons over the years.
I’ve been rolling these out on social media over the past week and will
continue to add to and update this collection slowly over the summer.
Enjoy! ↫ BasicAppleGuy Every single one of these icons is getting
progressively worse with almost every design change. They go from
beautifully crafted, easily readable and supremely distinguishable icons
to generic, repetitive blobs of colour, void of any personality,
artistry, or usability considerations. Also, Apple’s new icon design
language makes the icons look fuzzy, like they’re not being rendered
properly. It’s very unnerving. The one exception is probably the generic
folder icon, which looks fine in all of its incarnations. Then there’s
the classic Platinum, pixelated version from Mac OS 9 and earlier,
which, together with icons from Windows and BeOS from the same time
period, are a whole different style that I don’t think most people would
accept anymore these days, but that I absolutely adore. Mostly I’m just
sad that the craft of making exquisite icons for operating systems is
dying, replaced by what almost look like “AI” generated blobs of
indeterminate meaning, that rely more on preexisting knowledge of the
operating system and its applications in question than on being
recognisable and decipherable by anyone. I truly hope Windows and the
various open source desktops don’t follow in Apple’s footsteps here.</p>

Xbox executive urges laid off employees to talk to Copilot for emotional
support</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-06, from: OS News</p>
<p>A couple of days ago, Microsoft announced 9,000 layoffs across its
global workforce, impacting its engineering, Xbox, sales, and management
teams. This move also affected various initiatives, resulting in
the cancellation of at least three Xbox games, job cuts across various
studios, and even the shuttering of one game studio, The Initiative. In
the wake of this dark day in the the tech industry, a tone-deaf
Microsoft executive urged laid off workers to turn to AI tools for
emotional support. ↫ Usama Jawad at Neowin These corporations are raking
in massive amounts of profit, they’re doing better than ever, the cup of
money runneth over, and yet, they keep laying off thousands and
thousands of people almost every few months. The incentives in
modern-day capitalism clearly aren’t working out for the vast majority
of people, and then to give that final kick when you’re already down,
some asshat manager tells you to “talk to” sparkly autocomplete for
emotional support. Fuck this guy.</p>
