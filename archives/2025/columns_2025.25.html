Scripting News</strong> (date: 2025-06-27, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting
News)</p>
<p>BTW, I think the right way to read Scripting News is getting the
nightly email. That’s the pulse. I jot stuff down during the day, mostly
in the morning, and later add links and finish stuff up. The
scripting.com feed is updated in realtime. So you may get many versions
of an item over the course of a day, which might be a problem with feed
readers that don’t watch for changes. I noticed that my changes to my
podcast shownotes page don’t flow back out to Pocket Casts, which is the
client I use on my Android phone. FeedLand btw, records changes, and
they flow through to the timeline. Coupled with rssCloud, which is
supported in every WordPress site, makes the whole thing realtime.
People assume that feeds have to perform like a feed reader. But if you
have a component running on the open internet, hooked up via websockets
to the client, you get the flow they get in twitter-like systems. And
the thing is we didn’t have to invent anything that didn’t already exist
in 2009.</p>

remember that you love all these characters and you can immediately
start living the ongoing drama of their lives. The scene they paint is

<h2 id="the-age-of-integrity">The Age of Integrity</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-27, updated: 2025-06-26, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
We need to talk about data integrity.
</p>
<p>
Narrowly, the term refers to ensuring that data isn’t tampered with,
either in transit or in storage. Manipulating account balances in bank
databases, removing entries from criminal records, and murder by
removing notations about allergies from medical records are all
integrity attacks.
</p>
<p>
More broadly, integrity refers to ensuring that data is correct and
accurate from the point it is collected, through all the ways it is
used, modified, transformed, and eventually deleted. Integrity-related
incidents include malicious actions, but also inadvertent mistakes…

<h2 id="productivity-traps-i-fall-into-regularly">Productivity traps I
fall into regularly</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-26, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
There’s some productivity traps I fall into on a regular basis. They all
tie into my personal flavor of ADHD but it’s not totally fair to blame
the ol’ meat-wad brain when I know when, where, and why it happens.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
There’s a Big Thing to do, so I can’t do anything else
</li>
<li>
Boredom in meetings leads internet wanderings
</li>
<li>
I should blog this real quick turns into work avoidance
</li>
</ol>
<h2>
The Big Thing…
</h2>
<p>
One of my ADHD quirks is that if there’s a Big Thing to do that day
(doctor’s appointment, package delivery, big presentation) then 100% of
my brain goes to that important event. I can’t miss it. Nothing else
gets done until The Big Thing gets done.
</p>
<p>
Conversely, after The Big Thing gets done, nothing else gets done either
because my brain –flooded with dopamine– feels an enormous sense of
accomplishment for remembering to do The Big Thing. I did The Big Thing.
The Big Thing is done. Mission accomplished.
</p>
<p>
Completing that big task should free up new brain RAM allocation for the
next task… but it doesn’t work that way. I spent so much energy keeping
the horses in the barn, my brain won’t even consider letting them out
again until much later in the evening. Hands numb from sitting on them
try to grab a new task from the shelf, but can’t.
</p>
<p>
If anyone deals with this and knows how to either a) make The Big Thing
less blocking or b) perform a tactial reset after The Big Thing, I’d
love to know.
</p>
<h2>
Boredom in meetings…
</h2>
<p>
I have a bad habit where I get dopamine starved in a meeting and I
naturally hop over to YouTube and start queuing up interesting videos.
This regrettably creates a backlog of open tabs for me to clear out when
I’m out of the meeting. This isn’t good. It’s so bad because I’ll even
look for other videos to watch <em>while I’m watching a video</em>. Why
do I do this to myself?
</p>
<p>
I need to reprogram my brain to smell boredom and find dopamine another
–more temporary– way. I used to speed cube during meetings, that was
probably my most successful era of doing meetings. I should try and go
back to that. Or 3D print a bunch of fidgets. I bought a big drawing pad
at Five Below and put it next to my desk and have had a little success
sketching during meetings, but YouTube and social media are so damn
convenient.
</p>
<p>
It’s not just video, it happens with blog posts too. One social media
link. Links to another link. Links to another. Now I have 5,000 tabs.
Oof.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2025/01/raycast-focus/">Focus</a> tools
to block social media sites has been effective, but any other strategies
I need to know about?
</p>
<h2>
Blog this real quick…
</h2>
<p>
If I ever think about something too much and it’s blogpost-worthy
content, I try to fire up a draft to get the idea out of my head. If I
can create a rough outline in my second brain now, I can come back to it
later… but it’s a worm hole.
</p>
<p>
While the intent is to capture the idea, I naturally switch into writing
mode trying to fill out sentences and shape paragraphs. I think it’s
dopamine starvation again. When I’m writing in my note taking app, I’m
in a fun place where I’m a high functioning adult and the desire to go
back to trudging through thousands of lines of JSON is low in
comparison.
</p>
<p>
Of all these productivity traps, writing a blog post is the least
offensive to me. Writing ideas helps cement knowledge and that’s a good
thing for a knowledge worker. It also keeps a skill I use at work
(writing) sharp. But when it’s a form of escapism from what I actually
need to do, I need to find efficient ways to curb that behavior.
Time-boxing seems like a good idea here.
</p>
<h2>
Here be dragons
</h2>
<p>
I’m sharing these traps in the hope that I become more cognizant and
accountable to myself. I can almost see myself falling down these traps
in a third-person over camera angle. “The Big Thing” probably gets me
the most often, I’d love to overcome it.
</p>
<p>
I’m curious about other brains. Have you found other traps I need to
know about? Do you embrace the chaos and let the day fall apart? Do you
have systems built up to self-correct?

the current mayor hostage. This will be worse than 9-11 and Covid. We

<p>date: 2025-06-25, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I tried an experiment,
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/06/25/asfarasyoucango.png">go
back</a> as far as I can in archive.org on scripting.com and see where
it gets me. The
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19961114163115/http://scripting.com/">first
try</a> got me to a classified ads site I was experimenting with in
mid-November 1996. A few weeks later, on
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19961203224609/http://scripting.com/">December
3,</a> there was a colorful directory that took you to all the sub-sites
on the server, DaveNet,
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19961203224624/http://www.scripting.com/frontier/">Frontier</a>,
Classified ads, our Midas Website (Macintosh Internet Developers
Association), DocServer, a BBS, and Guestbook.
</p>
<p>
I went digging around in the
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19961203224624/http://www.scripting.com/frontier/">Frontier</a>
part. Lots of stuff there. By then we had been working on Frontier for
eight years. It had been reborn once, from a Mac-focused single-user
scripting environment to a networked one, all because the web had
exploded and Apple didn’t want us making system software for their
platform. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>
</p>
<p>
BTW, some of this stuff is
<a href="http://scripting.com/frontier/olddefault.html">still here</a>.
</p>
<p>
There are lots of paths to try out.
</p>
<p>
This was where my
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19961203224710/http://www.scripting.com/frontier/news.html">blog
home page</a> was then.
</p>
<p>
Then to DaveNet, and in the left margin

I love the screen shots that show what a good match the Frontier object
database was to the way a website is organized.

<h2 id="inverse-text-sizing-based-on-text-length-with-attr">Inverse
text-sizing based on text-length with attr()</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-25, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
Text reflow on the web has an interesting relationship with Responsive
Web Design. As a column gets smaller text wraps and becomes
taller<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>.
But for large format display text, that’s not always what you
want<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>.
What I’ve wanted for awhile now is a way to inversely size text based on
the text length (where the font-size gets smaller as the heading gets
longer).
</p>
<p>
I’ve been chasing the white whale of responsive text-sizing for over a
decade and I think I’ve got my best attempt to-date with the new
<code>attr()</code> upgrades that landed in CSS (Chromium-only at time
of writing).
</p>

CSS’s <code>attr()</code> function got an upgrade this year where you
can use it independent of <code>content</code> in pseudo-elements. They
also added the ability to cast types to the values. Before that change
all attributes were text strings and if you tried to use it in a
<code>calc()</code> function, CSS would bail because you can’t multiply
a pixel by a text string. With the new upgraded <code>attr()</code>
function you can specify a type in the new <code>type()</code> function
as the second parameter of <code>attr()</code>: <code>attr(foo
type(&lt;number&gt;))</code> .
</p>
<p>
Having these pieces of technology in place lets us mix in HTML
attributes to our CSS math.

  <span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
We start with an <code>–ideal-cpl</code>, which is a typographic notion
that there’s an ideal line-length at or near 66 characters per line and
perhaps smaller on mobile (source:
<a href="https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/optimal-line-length-for-readability/">UXPin</a>).
Headings are probably less. We take that number and divide it by
<code>–numchars</code> from our <code>data-numchars</code> attribute to
get a ratio to multiply our text by (e.g. <code>45cpl / 60numchars =
0.75</code> or <code>45cpl / 30numchars = 1.5</code>).
</p>
<p>
Then set some min/max variables and chuck it all into a
<code>clamp()</code> function to enforce some limits. Anything under the
<code>–ideal-cpl</code> will clamped to the <code>–max-font-size</code>
and titles over the <code>–ideal-cpl</code> will shrink down until they
hit the <code>–min-font-size</code>.
</p>
<p>
To help with graceful degradation in unsupported browsers (Safari,
Firefox), we need to use the CSSOM <code><span class="citation"
data-cites="property">@property</span></code> syntax to typecast our
<code>–numchars</code> custom property. This is a hint to browsers like
Mobile Safari that <code>–numchars</code> is going to be a
<code>&lt;number&gt;</code> and we can set a fallback value as well.
</p>
<div class="language-css highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="css"><span class="c">/* Property used to provide fallback to other browsers */</span>
<span class="k">@property</span> <span class="n">--numchars</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="py">syntax</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">"&lt;number&gt;"</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
Hopefully the “magic” here is pretty easy to understand but for
completion’s sake, you’ll need to add <code>data-numchars</code> to your
HTML to make this work.
</p>
<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;h1</span> <span class="na">data-numchars=</span><span class="s">"71"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur
  adipisicing elit. Vitae, maxime.
<span class="nt">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
Templating languages can help. Here’s what I do in my Liquid templates
for Jekyll:
</p>
<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="ruby">
<span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">h1</span> <span class="n">data</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">numchars</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"{{ title.size }}"</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">{{</span> <span class="n">title</span> <span class="p">}}</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sr">/h1&gt;

</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
If you don’t have access to your template but somehow have access to
JavaScript, you can do something this:
</p>
<div class="language-js highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="js"><span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">querySelectorAll</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">h1</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">forEach</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">el</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> 
    <span class="nx">el</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">dataset</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">numchars</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">el</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">textContent</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">length</span>
<span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
I’ve went ahead and rolled this technique out on my entire site and made
a <a href="/all-titles">All Titles</a> page where I can tweak variables
to my liking. The result is I get to keep my chonky headlines on mobile,
but almost no heading wrap more than three lines. One improvement might
be to use more CSS math to snap to different short/medium/long sizes, so
its less cacophonous… but on my site you only see one display title at a
time, so it’s less of a big deal.

Scaling text responsi<del>ve</del>bly

<p>
With all that in place, we have a HTML/CSS-based solution for responsive
text-sizing with minimal overhead, no JS required, no extra DOM, and a
graceful degradation to older browsers. I intentionally kept this dumb
to allow for text wrapping, but
<a href="https://codepen.io/paulirish/pen/YPXyxeZ">Paul Irish forked
me</a> to make a <code>contenteditable</code> demo work edge-to-edge
like Kizu’s <a href="https://kizu.dev/fit-to-width/">Fit-to-Width</a> or
Zach Leatherman’s old
<a href="https://github.com/zachleat/BigText">BigText</a> jQuery plugin.

<p>
Impressive. There’s lots of ways to resize text responsively and I’ve
added another one to the pile, so here’s a little guide with how I’m
thinking about all the options.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
If you want <em>exact</em> edge-to-edge text-sizing I’d probably
recommend Kizu’s clever Fit-to-Width technique.
</li>
<li>
If you (and your designers) are okay with not-so-exact edge-to-edge
sizing, Paul’s approach seems like a good candidate.
</li>
<li>
Don’t forget about SVG. Converting display text to outlines in Figma and
exporting as SVG is also a nice option for exact fitting text one-offs,
but doesn’t localize well.
</li>
<li>
If you want text to scale-inversely to its length but still wrap, use
the approach in this post.
</li>
<li>
If you want text to be a bit more fluid between breakpoints, use
<code>clamp()</code> + <code>vw</code> units.
</li>
<li>
If you want text to scale based on it’s parent’s width like a vector,
then <strong>DON’T USE</strong> FitText and use
<code>clamp(var(–min-font-size), 10cqi, var(–max-font-size))</code> with
a CSS container instead.
</li>
<li>
If you want strict typographic control at every breakpoint, use
<code>rem</code> or <code>px</code>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Lots of options for scalable type out there that give type-setting
control freak nerds nightmares, have fun!

<p>At 6:02 last night, President Donald Trump announced on his social
media account that Israel and Iran has agreed to “a Complete and Total
CEASEFIRE” that would lead to “an Official END to THE 12 DAY WAR.”
Maggie Haberman of the New York Times reported today that the
announcement took some of Trump’s own senior advisors by surprise.</p>

<p>We treat generative AI like magic… and magic systems have rules. When
creating fantasy worlds, writers think about who can use magic, how
magic is performed, what it’s able to do, what its constraints are, what
the source of magic is, and what it costs. I’m applying a bit of reverse
worldbuilding to the real […]</p>

<p><span
class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Setting
up an Ubuntu Desktop installation for SSH, quickly</span></p>
<pre><code>        &lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve enjoyed using Ubuntu Server&#39;s GitHub SSH pubkey importer for a long time, it&#39;s a quick and easy way when doing an interactive server installation to get the built-in OpenSSH server configured for remote SSH access.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
However, many computers I work on have Ubuntu Desktop installed instead,
and it doesn’t even include OpenSSH Server in the default packages!
</p>
<p>
So I thought I’d write up a quick guide for how to set up SSH on Ubuntu
Desktop pulling in my GitHub SSH public keys quickly, since I haven’t
found a similar guide elsewhere:
</p>
<h2>
Install OpenSSH
</h2>
<p>
Open Terminal and enter the commands:
</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt install openssh-server -y
sudo systemctl enable ssh
sudo systemctl start ssh
</code></pre>
<p>
OpenSSH is running with Ubuntu’s default configuration. You can edit the
configuration inside <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> if you want (make
sure to <code>systemctl restart ssh</code> after doing so).
</p>
<h2>
Import your GitHub public keys
</h2>
<p>
Ubuntu includes a handy utility that does this for you:

<pre><code>        &lt;p&gt;Over on the 2nd channel, I posted a video detailing my process for making thumbnails for my YouTube channel:&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;

.embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute;

<p>
My videos target a more technical audience—and often deal with subjects
crowds like those on HN might find interesting.
</p>
<p>
Technical audiences don’t often enjoy the feeling of being ‘bamboozled’,
especially in subtle ways that feels like marketing or deception.
</p>
<p>
Therefore YouTube thumbnails are often a contentious topic. In the early
days, thumbnails were just a still frame from the video, meaning it was
harder (but not impossible) to ‘game the system’ and introduce

<a href="https://shownotes.scripting.com/scripting/2025/06/23/wordpressAndMe.html">podcast</a>.
He liked the idea of WordPress as the OS of the open social web. Glad
that resonated. It has so much more than the other possible platforms.
The others couldn’t even realistically claim to be part of the web. They
don’t support writers very well. We’re going to build slowly and
deliberately around this idea, always staying open for competitors,
because that’s the most important thing about the web, beyond its
simplicity, it <i>never</i> locks its users in. That’s a deal-stopper.
As I’ve learned how WordPress works internally, I immediately saw that
they embraced the concepts of the web not just as words, but in their
practice. I never hit a wall that kept me out of doing something they
already did. And they also appear to never break users and developers.
That’s one of the basic rules of the web, it’s an unchanging thing, no
one can break it because everyone is a
<a href="https://this.how/googleAndHttp/">guest</a>. Anyway, there is
only one web. Keep that in mind. Nothing exclusive about it.</p>

only DESQview/X had been launched when Quarterdeck starting talking
about it</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-23, from: Liam on Linux</p>
A response to an
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44353673">HN
comment</a>…<br /><br />The PC press had rumours of Quarterdeck’s
successor to DESQview, Desqview/X, from around 1987-1988.
<p>
That is roughly when I entered the computer industry.<br /><br />Dv/X
was remarkable tech, and if it had shipped earlier could have changed
the course of the industry. Sadly, it came too late. Dv/X was rumoured
then, but the state of the art was OS/2 1.1, released late 1988 and the
first version of OS/2 with a GUI.
</p>
<p>
Dv/X was not released until
<a href="https://winworldpc.com/product/desqview/desqview-x-1x">about 5Y
later</a>… 1992. That’s the same year as Windows 3.1, but critically,
Windows 3.0 was in 1990, 2 years <i>earlier</i>.
</p>
<p>
Windows 3.0 was a result of the flop of OS/2 1.x.
</p>
<p>
OS/2 1.x was a new 16-bit multitasking networking kernel – but that
meant new drivers.
</p>
<p>
MS discarded the radical new OS, it discarded networking completely
(until later), and moved the multitasking into the GUI layer, allowing
Win3 to run on top of the single-tasking MS-DOS kernel. That meant
excellent compatibility: it ran on almost anything, can it could run
almost all DOS apps, <i>and multitask them</i>. And thanks to a
brilliant skunkworks project, mostly by one man, David Weise, assisted
by Murray Sargent, it combined 3 separate products (Windows 2,
Windows/286 and Windows/386) into a single product that ran on all 3
types of PC and took good advantage of all of them. I wrote about its
development here:
<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/18/how_windows_got_to_v3/" rel="nofollow">https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/18/how_windows_got_to_v3…</a>
</p>
<p>
It also did bring in some of the GUI design from OS/2 1.1, mainly from
1.2, and 1.3 – the Program Manager and File Manager UI, the proportional
fonts, the fake-3D controls, some of the Control Panel, and so on. It
kept the best user-facing parts and threw away the fancy invisible stuff
underneath which was problematic.
</p>
<p>
Result: smash hit, redefined the PC market, and when Dv/X arrived it was
doomed: too late, same as OS/2 2.0, which came out the same year as
Dv/X.
</p>
<p>
If Dv/X had come out in the late 1980s, before Windows 3, it could have
changed the way the PC industry went.
</p>
<p>
Dv/X combined the good bits of DOS, 386 memory management and
multitasking, Unix networking and Unix GUIs into an interesting value
proposition: network your DOS PCs with Unix boxes over Unix standards,
get remote access to powerful Unix apps, and if vendors wanted, it
enabled ports of Unix apps to this new multitasking networked DOS.
</p>
<p>
In the ’80s that could have been a contender. Soon afterwards it was
followed by Linux and the BSDs, which made that Unix stuff free and ran
on the same kit. That would have been a great combination – Dv/X PCs
talking to BSD or Linux servers, when those Unix boxes didn’t really
have useful GUIs yet.
</p>
<p>
Windows 3 offered a different deal: it combined the good bits of DOS,
OS/2 1.x’s GUI, and Windows 2.x into a whole that ran on anything and
could run old DOS apps and new GUI apps, side by side.
</p>
<p>Networking didn’t follow until Windows for Workgroups which followed
Windows 3.1. Only businesses wanted that, so MS postponed it. Good
move.<br /> <br /><br /><img src="https://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=liam_on_linux&ditemid=95984" width="30" height="12" alt="comment count unavailable" style="vertical-align: middle;"/>

<blockquote>
<p>
The vast majority of the attack was delivered in the form of User
Datagram Protocol packets. Legitimate UDP-based transmissions are used
in especially time-sensitive communications, such as those for video
playback, gaming applications, and DNS lookups. It speeds up
communications by not formally establishing a connection before data is
transferred. Unlike the more common Transmission Control Protocol, UDP
doesn’t wait for a connection between two computers to be established
through a handshake and doesn’t check whether data is properly received
by the other party. Instead, it immediately sends data from one machine
to another…

Trump may not want regime change in Iran, but he definitely wants regime
change in California.
</p>
<p>
He’s going to war with Iran to hide his war with the United States.
</p>
<p>
We need a war-ready Democratic Party.

Governor or mayor is not a job for peaceniks.

<h2 id="wordcamp-canada-in-october">WordCamp Canada in October</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-22, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I’m keynoting the <a href="https://canada.wordcamp.org/2025/">WordCamp
Canada</a> conference in October in Ottawa. It’s the first conference
I’ve attended since before the pandemic.
</p>
<p>
The timing is ideal, and the location is significant. As an American, I
don’t want to try to attract people from around the world to a meeting
in my country. Right now, I wouldn’t come here if I didn’t live here.
</p>
<p>
I’m also not happy with the tech industry of the US. I’d like a fresh
start, a return to our roots, with the assumption that the people
control their destiny and the role of developers is to give them to the
tools to try out new ideas.
</p>
<p>
With <a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a> I’ve created a
product <a href="https://this.how/wordland/">for writers</a>, filling a
need that’s been there since the beginning of the web, using the
practices in writing tools we learned in the 80s. It doesn’t have the
artificial <a href="https://textcasting.org/">limits</a> imposed by
Twitter et al. I think they’re senseless. So we’re going to blow that
door wide open. No character limits. Simple styling. Links. Editable.
</p>
<p>
And it’s also a product for developers. There’s no lock-in anywhere in
this stack. So you can make a different style of editor. Or play with
new ways to view timelines.
</p>
<p>
I wanted to take discourse in a different direction too. A good design
for the social web shouldn’t require intense moderation. The reward for
spammers is practically nil. Also, it’ll be good for small groups in a
way that Twitter et al never have been.
</p>
<p>
So far I haven’t invented any new formats. We’re building on what works
now. WordPress is a remarkably deep product, so deep it could be used as
operating system. and that’s exactly how I’ve chosen to view it and it
works incredibly well. Some of what we’re building on is based on work I
did with Joseph Scott of Automattic in
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22joseph%20scott%22">2009</a>,
believe it or not.
</p>
<p>
And as a bonus we get a great bridge into ActivityPub, from the great
work Automattic is doing in bridging WordPress to ActivityPub. Think
about it and you’ll see how connections in and out of WordPress can
facilitate a lot of interop, not just via RSS, but any format that comes
along that people want to use.
</p>
<p>
We’ll have a lot to talk about in October!
</p>

<h2 id="rss-on-a-timeline">RSS on a timeline</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-22, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
More on the vision for WordLand and RSS.
</p>
<p>
Imagine that <a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a> is the
editor of a
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22twitter-like%22">twitter-like</a>
system built around
<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a>. It saves your
writing to WordPress, where it is published on a website and via RSS.
You don’t have to use WordLand or WordPress, because RSS is an open
format. <i>Any editor that generates RSS is part of the network.
</i>Designed to be simple.
</p>
<p>
All that’s missing is a timeline viewer, and that’s what I’m working on
now. It’s coming together pretty nicely, imho. Not an easy project,
though on the surface it looks like it should be. Also there’s nothing
proprietary about my timeline viewer. There could be a thousand of them.
Anyone who has written an RSS feed reader will have all the low-level
bits they need.
</p>
<p>
Hoping to have all the connections working by the end of the summer.
</p>
<p>
Once done, it will be the completion of the vision for RSS as the
foundation of the open social web, the place that all the open formats
agree on, so we can get on with interop and say goodbye to lock-in. It
can be done, I’m almost 100 percent sure of that now. Still have a
little ways to go. As they say – <i>still diggin!</i>
