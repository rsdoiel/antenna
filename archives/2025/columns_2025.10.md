**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-03-10, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

A hard  lesson to learn -- people don't listen to their friends, they listen to their competitors.

BTW it's worth <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/02/24/153052.html">calling attention</a> to a bit I linked to yesterday. <i>Cross-posting to Bluesky and Mastodon is not on the roadmap for WordLand.</i> They are too limited in the features they support for writers. This is a big point, not a casual thing. I am trying to create a network that's like stereo to mono. We're not going to try to scale down writing in WordLand so it fits into the tight little featureless well-silo'd boxes in order to peer with those systems. Instead, I want to force them to give writers a decent surface to write on. Somehow we lost our minds and decided deliberately to limit communication to grunts and snorts, and it should not be a surprise that when our civilization migrated to them, it became unable to understand complex ideas. I guarantee you Carl Sagan, if he were alive, would have seen this. Or maybe not? I don't know. But it's a bizarre situation that I've decided to try to fix.

My most-visited blog post of the last couple of weeks is Radio&#39;s Death Knells. I have a feeling those visits are more from people in the business than from people who listen to radio. Sad but interesting to see how many listings on my old blogroll (frozen in Augst 2007) are from people now gone: [&#8230;]

The word is starting to spread about <a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a>. And the product is holding up pretty well. There are some issues in Safari with the toolbar that pops up over selection. I see people pasting in URLs that makes me think it's not working for them. Don Park started using it. I did my first project with Don in the late 80s. The project was very successful. His respect means a lot to me. The positioning -- it makes WordPress as easy to write for as Twitter, is great to hear as users write about it. That was one of the major design goals. What people are missing, and it's right in front of their eyes, they can use writing features that somehow never made it to the twitter-like systems, the ones listed on the <a href="https://textcasting.org/">textcasting memorandum</a> (or manifesto, whichever you prefer). I'm glad people are seeing this as an enhancement to WordPress, not an attempt to create a new community. I want <i>all</i> WordPress writers to use this product. Every one of them. I want people to feel that it's an essential part of WordPress, for writers. The writer's web. Remember that, you'll be hearing a lot about that. And I want to be sure we fix all the bugs, and add all the features they believe are missing, as long as the features pertain to writing. Everything else is well-covered by the main product. There's also an API that comes with WordLand, I'll be talking more about that later. Makes it easier to write WordPress apps in JavaScript that run in the browser.

## Thousands of WordPress Websites Infected with Malware

<p>The malware includes <a href="https://cside.dev/blog/thousands-of-websites-hit-by-four-backdoors-in-3rd-party-javascript-attack">four separate backdoors</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Creating four backdoors facilitates the attackers having multiple points of re-entry should one be detected and removed. A unique case we haven&#8217;t seen before.

Lately, political writers have called attention to the tendency of billionaire Elon Musk to refer to his political opponents as &#8220;NPCs.&#8221; This term comes from the gaming world and refers to a nonplayer character, a character that follows a scripted path and cannot think or act on its own, and is there only to populate the world of the game for the actual players.

The final round of the 10th Indiana International Guitar Competition just happened, here, as well as in the natural world. We saw it in the latter. Amazing performances. Bloomington is a fabulous small city anyway, but the Jacobs School of Music—and the whole music scene here—puts Bloomington over the top for us. In addition to [&#8230;]

## Tweeting a Blog

## Tag, you're it

date: 2025-03-09, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>I’m a bit behind in my RSS feeds and I didn’t realize <a href="https://www.susanjeanrobertson.com/writing/tag-youre-it/">Susan tagged me</a> to answer a series of questions about my blog. I’ve read dozens of these and to be honest was feeling a little left out, so thanks Susan for including me! (Susan’s one of my favorite bloggers and crafters, be sure to like and subscribe.)</p>
<h2>Why did you start blogging in the first place?</h2>
<p>I published a zine in high school with my best friend Mike. Our zine Wimpkiller was a creative outlet for all the composition notebooks we filled up over a bottomless cups of coffee at IHOP. We’d print out stories on Mike’s computer, chop ‘em up, glue ‘em together, and then scam copies after midnight with the help of the friendly late-shift worker at Kinko’s. I enjoyed that thrill of self-publishing then as much as I do now. It felt like the garage band of writing. You may not be good or ever get famous, but you can brute force some art into the world.</p>
<p>In college blogs became a trend. I created a blog as I graduated from college to chronicle my entry into the corporate world and ended up chronicling my move and life in Japan. It served as a form of catharsis and outward processing as well as keeping my friends and family up to date on my adventures. That blog died after I came back from Japan and had to get a job and start a career.</p>
<p>Meeting Jeffery Zeldman at SXSW was the inspiration for this edition of the blog, if you can believe it. A brief encounter but my key takeaway on how I could become more like my web development heroes was to write more. They write, and writing begets books, and books begets conference talks. It seemed like a template I could follow and I started self-publishing again. Over time, I wrote enough to where I got to write on <a href="https://alistapart.com/">Jeffrey’s blog</a> and speak at his conference a handful of times. I guess the plan worked out.</p>
<h2>What platform are you using to manage your blog and why did you choose it?</h2>
<p>I started on WordPress but <a href="https://daverupert.com/2012/11/brander-newer/">I moved my blog to Jekyll in 2012</a>. I chose Jekyll because I was into Ruby at the time and fighting with WordPress for good performance was exhausting me. I wanted a simpler authoring and development experience. The simplicity of building with markdown files on <code>localhost</code> still resonates with me.</p>
<h2>Have you blogged on other platforms before?</h2>
<p>I’ve used Blogger, MovableType, WordPress, and Jekyll. There’s also an ill-fated Eleventy branch on my site that never made it to production. I’m sure Jekyll will implode and I’ll need to find something else, but switching platforms would be a distraction for me at this point without some obvious benefit or process improvement.</p>
<h2>How do you write your posts? For example, in a local editing tool, or in a panel/dashboard that’s part of your blog?</h2>
<p><a href="https://daverupert.com/2021/09/my-notion-blogging-kanban/">I write my posts in a giant Notion kanban</a>. It’s overkill but it’s my overkill. The organization capabilities and “markdown-like” aspects of Notion made it a good fit over a folder-o’-files. Before publishing, my posts go through a series of <a href="https://daverupert.com/2021/10/pre-publish-blogging-rituals/">pre-publishing rituals</a>. With those processes combined I maintain a level of quality and throughput that I’m happy with.</p>
<h2>When do you feel most inspired to write?</h2>
<p>I find time to write after the kids go to bed. If there’s time during the workday, I may spend a lunch break jotting some thoughts too. My blogging is very work-dependent to the extent that sometimes <a href="https://daverupert.com/2020/09/boredom-begets-boredom/">when I’m productive at work, I’m most productive at blogging</a>. But often, I’m too tired or focusing on other tasks to craft a well-reasoned blog post.</p>
<h2>Do you publish immediately after writing, or do you let it simmer a bit as a draft?</h2>
<p>Most of my drafts simmer for weeks if not months or years. From time to time I’ll do a one day turnaround on a post and that’s rewarding, but it’s inconsistent. At the time of writing I have 22 active drafts where ”active” means I’ve updated them at least once in the last six months. If I increase the scope to one year, there’s 41 drafts in my kanban.</p>
<h2>What are you generally interested in writing about?</h2>
<p>I’m a generalist at heart and enjoy writing about technology generally. If you look at my archive it’s pretty rare that two consecutive posts will be thematically similar. I write about specific technologies like CSS but also about game development or the capital-W Web. And of course prototypes, which I’m convinced are the not-so-secret sauce for building great technologies.</p>
<p>One direction I’m slipping towards in my mind is futurism and speculative fiction (e.g. <a href="https://daverupert.com/stories/">sci-fi</a>). Writing about current technology limits you to existing capitalist and corporate structures. Imagining the future <a href="https://daverupert.com/2017/10/a-good-science-fiction-story/">and the potential fallout</a> allows you to think without the confines of “Good because make money” which so much of our discourse is today.</p>
<h2>Who are you writing for?</h2>
<p>Woof. Good question. 90% of the time I’m writing to get ideas out of my head. Transfiguring ideas into text works wonders for me. I also tend to write for an abstract audience, people who are curious about the web and technology yet crave more from it; a person who considers themselves a technologist, but also factors in morality and other <a href="http://localhost:4000/2024/04/thoughts-on-cosmotechnics/">cosmotechnics</a>.</p>
<h2>What’s your favorite post on your blog?</h2>
<p><a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/08/quick-thoughts-on-chips/">Quick Thoughts on Chips</a> (2023) is up there but I feel like <a href="https://daverupert.com/2013/04/responsive-deliverables/">Responsive Deliverables</a> (2013) aka, the “tiny bootstraps” post, is a level of quality, thoughtfulness, and timelessness that I don’t achieve often. I’d like more “timeless” pieces like that, but I don’t exactly know how or if it’s worth trying to bottle that magic.</p>
<h2>Any future plans for your blog? Maybe a redesign, a move to another platform, or adding a new feature?</h2>
<p>I’m pretty comfortable with my site, but I have a couple changes in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c13gpBrnGEw&amp;t=225s">Use named grid lines</a></li>
<li>Blowout my tag pages with custom art direction</li>
<li>Make my mobile layout perfect</li>
<li>Write more <a href="https://daverupert.com/stories/">shitty sci-fi</a></li>
<li>Switch from Notion to Obsidian</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of those will happen over the course of a year, some in the dark of night, some never.</p>
<h2>Tag ‘em.</h2>
<p>What a responsibility to add people to this chain letter! Susan told me if I don’t forward this to 10 people, my grandparents will die! That seems extreme but okay. I’ll tag the following people who I think haven’t written one yet:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://zeldman.com/">Jeffrey Zeldman</a> - it feels fitting to pass the mic back to Jeffrey.</li>
<li><a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/">Eric Meyer</a> - another blogger that inspired me in my early days</li>
<li><a href="https://melanie-richards.com/">Melanie Richards</a> - a multi-talented person and another one of my favorite crafters.</li>
<li><a href="https://livelaugh.blog/">Jenn Schiffer</a> - talented artist and consistently way funnier than everyone else in the room.</li>
<li><a href="https://ericwbailey.website/">Eric Bailey</a> - one of my favorite web thinkers and also has <a href="https://buttondown.com/ericwbailey">the most interesting newsletter</a> out there.</li>
<li><a href="https://blakewatson.com/">Blake Watson</a> - deliverer of home-cooked applications</li>
<li><a href="https://joshcollinsworth.com/">Josh Collinsworth</a> - thoughtful blogger and word puzzle game developer</li>
</ul>
<p>Shoot. Only seven. Sorry, memaw and pepaw. Hopefully some unnamed individuals will answer the call.</p>

## 2025-03-09 The looming Discord IPO

date: 2025-03-09, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-03-09-the-looming-discord-ipo">2025-03-09 The looming Discord IPO</h1>

<p>So&hellip; Discord might be going there. I like their offering. I even pay them about $10/month.
What they offer works well.
People get their own little communities to administer, with the tools to administer them well, with the self-written automations and bots to handle communities from a handful of people to many thousands.
Read <a class="account" href="https://infosec.exchange/@isotopp" title="@isotopp@infosec.exchange">@isotopp</a>’s <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@isotopp/114116202418228034">perspective on Discord</a>.</p>

<p>But the monetization drive is strong.
And once the shareholders are in place, pressure for monetization will ramp up even more, I&rsquo;m sure. How long until it all goes down? Five years?</p>

<p>What are your backup plans?</p>

<p><a href="https://campaignwiki.org/wiki/Chat">My backup plan</a> is an IRC backend (<a href="https://ngircd.barton.de/">ngircd</a> uses about 5M of memory) and two instances of a web front-end called <a href="https://thelounge.chat/">The Lounge</a>. One of them is free for all and connects to my chat server; the other needs registration and offers file uploads and always-on connectivity (it acts as a &ldquo;bouncer&rdquo;). The two of them take about 150M of memory. Each registered account gets a little SQLite file with the logs. No other resources required.</p>

<p>You can connect to the IRC backend directly using your favourite IRC client, of course. Emacs comes with two of them. Just saying. 😄</p>

<p>For iOS, there&rsquo;s <a href="https://colloquy.app/">Colloquy</a>.</p>

<p>For Android, <a class="account" href="https://tabletop.social/@wandererbill" title="@wandererbill@tabletop.social">@wandererbill</a> suggests <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/io.mrarm.irc/">Revolution IRC</a>.</p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://tabletop.social/@phf" title="@phf@tabletop.social">@phf</a> suggested <a href="https://snikket.org/service/quickstart/">Snikket</a> instead. Installation requires a Docker image.</p>

<p>I dislike Docker, not because of what it is but because of what it implies. A virtual machine inside your virtual machine means that it doesn&rsquo;t auto-update. Upgrading will be tricky. It also means individual deployment requires multiple services such that it ended up being easier for them to supply a Docker image instead of supplying good instructions. I always take that to mean that the setup is brittle and underdocumented. Perhaps I’m wrong but it that’s the suspicion I have.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, I dislike Docker images for my virtual server server (6G memory, 75g storage, 2 cores) because multiple services packaged in a dockerfile usually mean lots of resources required. Frugal computing means that I am loath to accommodate that. I prefer not to upgrade my virtual machine.</p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://tabletop.social/@phf" title="@phf@tabletop.social">@phf</a> also suggested <a href="https://app.revolt.chat/">Revolt</a>.
<a class="account" href="https://tabletop.social/@wandererbill" title="@wandererbill@tabletop.social">@wandererbill</a> created a <a href="https://rvlt.gg/wkBDhJPb">Grenzland Server on Revolt</a>.
<a class="account" href="https://social.city-of-glass.net/users/cidney" title="@cidney@social.city-of-glass.net">@cidney</a> noted that it had Discord-like roles and role management for the server owner to hand out, so perhaps it&rsquo;s quite a suitable replacement.
Revolt can be self-hosted via Docker or self-building. At least there is a lot of info out there.
<a class="account" href="https://social.city-of-glass.net/users/cidney" title="@cidney@social.city-of-glass.net">@cidney</a> also found a wiki pages listing only four known instances including the default one, the largest being Andrew Tate&rsquo;s. 🤮</p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://tabletop.social/@wandererbill" title="@wandererbill@tabletop.social">@wandererbill</a> wanted to give Matrix another spin.
There are two server implementations, Synapse and Dendrite.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At an absolute minimum, Dendrite will expect 1GB RAM. For a comfortable day-to-day deployment which can participate in federated rooms for a number of local users, be prepared to assign 2-4 CPU cores and 8GB RAM — more if your user count increases. &ndash; <a href="https://element-hq.github.io/dendrite/installation/planning">Planning your installation</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p><a class="account" href="https://tabletop.social/users/kyonshi" title="@kyonshi@tabletop.social">@kyonshi</a> suggested <a href="https://jitsi.org/">Jitsi</a>.
I tried to self-host it a few years ago.
It worked well! But it also took a lot of resource. During the video call, the virtual machine&rsquo;s <a href="2020-03-26_Jitsi_and_the_CPU">load went up to 8</a>.
We sometimes use the installation at the <a href="https://ffmuc.net/">Freifunk München</a> for gaming.
Thanks, ffmuc! 😍</p>

<p>So, where does that leave is? I don&rsquo;t know. People don&rsquo;t seem to like The Lounge with IRC backend and I seem to be unwilling to upgrade my hosting commitments.</p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://hackers.town/@mc" title="@mc@hackers.town">@mc</a> recently recommended a different IRC server called <a href="https://ergo.chat/about">Ergo</a> and a different web front-end called <a href="https://codeberg.org/emersion/gamja">Gamja</a> but it&rsquo;s unclear to me what significant advantages either would offer.</p>

<p>Previously:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So… the situation is bad, but I still use Discord. &ndash; <a href="2022-08-16_Discord">Discord</a> (2022)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a class="account" href="https://tilde.zone/@dashdsrdash" title="@dashdsrdash@tilde.zone">@dashdsrdash</a> wrote wrote in with some interesting feedback. The Zulip part is interesting because I only used it for tiny bit, talking to the maintainers of Antora. Here&rsquo;s what they have to say:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Zulip is great for UI, slightly aggravating to run. It absolutely wants a dedicated server. It has a dice roller as one of the sample bots, and the API is extensive.</li>
<li>IRC is extremely easy to setup and relatively easy to write bots for. Interfaces vary from bare bones to not-bad; The Lounge is up on the not-bad end, and also easy to host.</li>
<li>Matrix may be the future of federated chat systems, but if you don&rsquo;t need federation, the complexity and ongoing maintenance are not worth it.</li>
<li>Jitsi has integrated chat but is video-conferencing-centric; the text chat is actually Prosody (an XMPP/Jabber) server under the hood. Video processing takes up a lot of CPU and bouncing it around takes a lot of bandwidth; otherwise, it&rsquo;s pretty nice.</li>
<li>I haven&rsquo;t tried running Revolt but I looked at the docs and I am really not favorably inclined. They have some questionable technology choices and insist on a Docker-first install that in my experience is a likely sign that there are too many moving parts for anyone to be able to diagnose what&rsquo;s going wrong.</li>
</ul>

<p>My suggestions would be:</p>

<ul>
<li>IRC is still a solid choice</li>
<li>Prosody without the Jitsi video conferencing is pretty nice, albeit a little complex to configure initially.</li>
<li>If I felt like spending the money for a medium-large VM at a hosting service dedicated to gaming, Zulip would be nice.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t know about the hosting of Zulip but the rest tracks my experience. IRC is the simplest option.</p>

I love how people declare that Trump doesn't represent us. But the truth is as long as our representatives don't impeach and remove him, he absolutely does represent us. There aren't two definitions of <i>represent.</i>

The issue is the same. When people post only to get attention, forget about anything useful getting done there. It's strictly a broadcast system. So the investment Masto and Bluesky make in discourse is imho wasted complexity. What we want is linking, not replies. If they were the web, they would be designed very differently. Anyway, in 2000, I asked people to put their ideas on their own sites, send me a link, and maybe I'll post it on my site. That right there is the plan for the new network. Facilitating that, it's as easy as posting on a twitter-like system (the early users <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2025/03/07/first-drafting/">confirm</a> that!), but the post goes into <i>your</i> space ie your blog, and a link goes to the person you're responding to, and it's up to them whether or not they want to amplify it, using their own criteria, in their space, to their subscribers. It's why twitter failed to be a keg of revolutionary ideas, instead one of warring factions in a prison. Not able to leave, but not able to do anything either.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-03-09, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

I did a restoration of <a href="https://discuss.userland.com/">discuss.userland.com</a>, the discussion group for scripting.com between 1998 and 2001. I think now finally it works. If you find anything interesting in the archive, send me a link. A lot of the early blogs started from discussions there, heated at times. But a lot of good stuff came from it.

A question came up about the RSS feeds that WordLand maintains, so I <a href="https://github.com/scripting/wordlandSupport/issues/55">wrote it up</a> on the support site. Net-net: Unless you're developing a component of the <a href="https://textcasting.org/">textcasting vision</a>, you should probably use the WordPress-maintained feed for your site.

## Fucking Republicans and Medicare

date: 2025-03-09, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I am hereby changing the name of "Republicans" to "Fucking Republicans" because that's what they do and what we're going to do to them. Today's issue is Medicare, which hits home to me, a person who planned for health care and depends on Medicare.</p>
<p>I need my Medicare. It's my health insurance. Health insurance always been a problem for me, with pre-existing conditions, and at one point a lapsed corporate plan.</p>
<p>I finally got on solid ground or so I thought when I turned 65 a few years ago. Now I find out that the Repubs are going to cancel or reduce my insurance, and I don't imagine that a person my age, with my pre-existing conditions (we all have them once at this age) I could get insurance.</p>
<p>So please tell me Republicans, how this is meant to work? I am not stupid and I know Medicare is not out of money. Am I going to be paying out of pocket for my health care? Are there any doctors or hospitals who even do this any longer?</p>
<p>Repubs, if my Medicare goes down, you are going down too.</p>
<p>PS: The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLLFeZGeXbA">inspiration</a> for this fucking idea. </p>

## Krugman's paywall

date: 2025-03-09, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I'm not a paid subscriber to anything on Substack. But I do read a few of their newsletters when they come out, including <a href="https://paulkrugman.substack.com/">Paul Krugman's</a>. Almost always must-read stuff. </p>
<p>But he also writes on the "other side of the paywall." When he announced it, he said he doesn't need the money, so I wondered why he does it. I kept reading anyway.</p>
<p>But he does something incredibly annoying and as clueless imho as the things he calls out in his writing — I only find out an article is on the other side of the paywall after I've read the first few paragraphs. I am a fan and I would send the money directly if he asked for it, but not via Substack.</p>
<p>Here's an <a href="https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/the-clean-little-secret-of-social">example</a> of such a post. </p>
<p>So because I don't pay I have to lose that time every time you do this? Have some respect for us who read you. I'm as old as he is, and I like to use my time well. So please either get rid of the stinking paywall, or warn us up front.</p>
<p>And also consider getting off <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=substack">Substack</a>. It's not a good look.</p>

## Skype got shouted down by Teams. But it gave us free telephony

date: 2025-03-09, from: John Naughton's online diary

Today’s Observer column The design of Arpanet’s successor, the internet we use today, started in the early 1970s and it was first switched on in January 1983. The designers of the network were, from the outset, determined to avoid the &#8230; <a href="https://memex.naughtons.org/skype-got-shouted-down-by-teams-but-it-gave-us-free-telephony/40517/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>
