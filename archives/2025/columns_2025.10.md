## Instagram is now a (photo) information network.

It is no secret that I love fountain pens, and that’s why I get excited about events such as the Manila Pen Show, which is the brainchild of a longtime friend and an admirable blogger, Leigh Reyes. She doesn’t blog much, but she posts everything she used to do on Instagram. And why not — &#8230;

## Backing the backslash

date: 2025-03-14, from: Shady Characters blog

<p>I’m almost ashamed to say it, but I never really gave the backslash a second thought.</p>
<p>The backslash’s forward-leaning counterpart is everywhere, especially in computing. It lives in network and web addresses such as <tt>https://shadycharacters.co.uk</tt>; in file paths, such as <tt>/home/keith</tt>; and it introduces human-readable “comments” in any number of programming languages, often like <tt>/* this */</tt> or <tt>// this</tt>.</p><a class="more-link" href="https://shadycharacters.co.uk/2025/03/backing-the-backslash/">Read more →</a>

## A Short History of Now

date: 2025-03-14, from: Doc Searls (at Harvard), New Old Blog

So there must be something to it. Watch how often people interrupt each other by saying the word &#34;So,&#34; and then launching into whatever they think is more essential than what somebody else is saying. And watch for people giving a speech start with &#34;So—&#34; The first speaker I heard do that was Larry Lessig, one [&#8230;]

I was looking over my <a href="http://scripting.com/2006/08.html">blog archive for August 2006</a>, which was when I started using Twitter, and came across this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTowHh1SFIA">video</a> of Jason Calacanis, at a Wikipedia conference in Cambridge. This is what videos were like back then. I probably took it with a fairly expensive Nikon camera.

## Exploring WiFi 7 (at 2 Gbps) on a Raspberry Pi 5

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Exploring WiFi 7 (at 2 Gbps) on a Raspberry Pi 5</span>

            <p></p>

<p>Last time I seriously dug into 6 GHz WiFi was with 6E on a <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2023/getting-15-gbps-wifi-6e-on-raspberry-pi-cm4">Raspberry Pi CM4 with Intel's AX210 card</a>, in 2023.</p>

<p>Back then—and even up until recently—using WiFi 6E or WiFi 7 on a Raspberry Pi meant <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/how-recompile-linux-on-raspberry-pi">recompiling Linux</a>, as the <code>iwlwifi</code> Linux drivers weren't included with the default Pi OS install.</p>

<p>But recently, the <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/issues/6497">Intel WiFi drivers were added by default</a>, and now all that's required is loading in the right firmware.</p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-03-14, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

Saw an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6h6QGVfrgQ">interview</a> with Mark Cuban where they asked why would Elon Musk do something that would cause Tesla stock to tank. He's got the power to play with the biggest financial thing that has ever existed, and quite possibly that ever will exist. In comparison Tesla is just one car company, with a lot of competition, a market-leading product for sure, but the competition is catching up. They're constantly lowering prices to keep the volume up, so eventually the stock will have to come down anyway. He certainly knows stuff about the company that no one else can see, maybe their new product pipeline is empty? He also has had to deal with short-sellers who have the incentive to drive the price down, and he can't bet alongside them (how would that look, a CEO betting against his own company). No matter what, there is nothing bigger than the USA, and he's got it, and plans to keep it. But he's human, and thus has frailties, and he loses as often as he wins and knows it. Unfortunately for us we're all in his boat now, unless somehow we can wrench it back.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-03-14, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

I heard an idea that really resonated in a Brian Lehrer <a href="https://play.pocketcasts.com/podcasts/0c3b41f0-2c8b-012e-09b1-00163e1b201c/15570ad4-8994-4fe9-83fc-1966fe0e6795">interview</a> with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anand_Giridharadas">Anand Giridharadas</a>, who says among many other things, that we should aim our ire at the <i>leaders</i> of the MAGA movement, and stop bringing our angst to the people who voted for them. Every time I see a condescending TikTok story about them, I think about how that takes us further from getting where we must go. We have to reconcile, we share a country, and our interests are totally aligned. We need each other, that will become completely obvious, and the sooner it does the better.

## "It's the people, stupid!"

date: 2025-03-14, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I keep hearing pundits and incumbent Democrats missing the point, that the people are the ones whose opinion matters about the Republicans dismantling our democracy in the United States. </p>
<p>I want to celebrate those leaders who totally get that the power is with the people, notably Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders. They are an inspiration! I live in New York and while AOC doesn't represent me in Congress (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Ryan_(politician)">Pat Ryan</a> is my rep), in a political and spiritual way she most definitely represents me. She should be the next president, as far as I'm concerned. She has all the leadership abilities we could ever want. </p>
<p>My contribution for today is the slogan that's the title of this piece. It's derived from James Carville's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_the_economy,_stupid">slogan</a> when Bill Clinton was running for president in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_United_States_presidential_election">1992</a>, updated for 2025. </p>
<p>"It's the people, dummy!" was always the right slogan. It's we, the people, who created this country, and we the people are the only ones who can make it work again.</p>

## TP-Link Router Botnet

date: 2025-03-14, updated: 2025-03-14, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>There is a new botnet that is <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/computing/malware-adware/thousands-of-tp-link-routers-have-been-infected-by-a-botnet-to-spread-malware">infecting</a> TP-Link routers:</p>
<blockquote><p>The botnet can lead to command injection which then makes remote code execution (RCE) possible so that the malware can spread itself across the internet automatically. This high severity security flaw (tracked as <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2023-1389">CVE-2023-1389</a>) has also been used to spread other malware families as far back as April 2023 when it was used in the <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/android-adb-matryosh-botnet">Mirai botnet</a> malware attacks. The flaw also linked to the Condi and AndroxGh0st malware attacks.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Of the thousands of infected devices, the majority of them are concentrated in Brazil, Poland, the United Kingdom, Bulgaria and Turkey; with the botnet targeting manufacturing, medical/healthcare, services and technology organizations in the United States, Australia, China and Mexico...</p></blockquote>

## 2025-02-06 Trans rights are human rights

<h1 id="2025-02-06-trans-rights-are-human-rights">2025-02-06 Trans rights are human rights</h1>

<p>I just read <a href="https://eldritch.cafe/@Tattie/113786790886539212">a post</a> by <a class="account" href="https://eldritch.cafe/@Tattie" title="@Tattie@eldritch.cafe">@Tattie</a> that I’m copying here, with permission:</p>

<h2 id="reminder-to-all-feminists">Reminder to all feminists</h2>

<p>If you accept trans people being defined by their reproductive role&hellip;<br>
Then men can define all woman by their reproductive role</p>

<p>If you accept that trans teenagers are too young to make decisions about their bodies&hellip;<br>
Then men can decide teenage girls are too young to make decisions about their bodies</p>

<p>If you accept medical gatekeeping of trans people&rsquo;s access to hormones&hellip;<br>
Then doctors can restrict any woman&rsquo;s access to HRT and birth control</p>

<p>If you accept stripping trans people of legal protections&hellip;<br>
Then men can strip women of legal protections</p>

<p>This is the truth of &ldquo;trans rights are human rights&rdquo;.<br>
Regardless of your personal feelings on whether trans people are &ldquo;really&rdquo; the gender they say they are, the exact same human rights protecting us also underlie women&rsquo;s liberation&ndash; bodily autonomy, dignity, equality of opportunity, and protection from harm.<br>
And so many men are desperate for those rights to disappear.</p>

<p>The Lemkin Institute for Genocide Prevention and Human Security condemns the anti-trans agenda of the second Trump Administration and warns Americans that the recent spate of executive orders, which are in line with a genocidal process against the transgender community that has been emerging in the United States for over a decade, are meant to pave the way for greater state repression against all individuals and other groups in the future. It is important to consistently and loudly reject this administration’s efforts to isolate any people or groups due to their identities, to reaffirm the USA’s commitment to individual rights and diversity, and to push back against efforts to normalize state repression and violence.

## 2025-03-13 Calculators and spreadsheets

date: 2025-03-13, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-03-13-calculators-and-spreadsheets">2025-03-13 Calculators and spreadsheets</h1>

<p>I stumbled upon a discussion about the Gnome Calculator. Apparently it stopped working for some people because a bank blocked it from retrieving the exchange rates it needs to allow users to do currency conversions. I get it. It&rsquo;s a feature, it needs data that&rsquo;s up to date, so you need to fetch it. The default is to do this once a week, I hear.</p>

<p>Based on <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-calculator/-/blob/main/lib/currency-provider.vala">currency-provider.vala</a>, the currency providers are the <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/fin/data/rms_five.aspx">International Monetary Fund</a> (IMF) and the <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/eurofxref/eurofxref-daily.xml">European Central Bank</a>.</p>

<p>So that leads me to another question: What do you use to do calculations you can&rsquo;t do in your head?</p>

<p>I mostly do it in Emacs using <code>M-x calc</code>. It uses the reverse-polish notation (RPN) I am used to from my old calculators before there where smartphones.
For a while I used <code>bc</code> but the precision was weird. Then I tried <code>dc</code> but it was weird, too. Now I have Super+C bound to <code>orpie</code> running in a terminal. Perhaps I should bind that key to run <code>emacsclient</code> and eval <code>(calc)</code>. 😂</p>

<p>From the replies, I found a large number of people reporting that they used the interpreters of their favourite programming languages. I didn&rsquo;t know that this was so wide-spread. People named Python, Ruby, Fennel, Scheme.</p>

<p>Python:</p>

<pre><code>Python 3.11.2 (main, Nov 30 2024, 21:22:50) [GCC 12.2.0] on linux

<p><a class="account" href="https://nrw.social/@HaraldKi" title="@HaraldKi@nrw.social">@HaraldKi</a> shared that they use a shell, but not just any shell: <code>tclsh</code> with the <a href="https://www.tcl-lang.org/man/tcl8.4/TclCmd/expr.htm">expr</a> built-in command.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tclsh uses just double math, afair, and understands plain and simple everyday expressions you basically learned in primary school. Plus scientific notation like 2.7e22 . Plus a chunk of log, sin, cos, tan if really needed. So no brain tweaks needed. The only thing to keep in mind: add .0 to most numbers to not accidentally get &frac34; -&gt; 0.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The key is have a function in your shell that gets transformed into a Tcl command that is piped to <code>tclsh</code>.
In my case, using <code>fish</code>, use <code>funced calc --save</code> and use the following:</p>

<pre><code>function calc
  echo &quot;puts [expr {$args}]&quot; | tclsh
end
</code></pre>

<p>At the shell prompt:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; calc 1+2+3
6
&gt; calc 4/3
1
&gt; calc 4/3.0
1.3333333333333333
</code></pre>

<p>What about the other options?</p>

<p>I think the key is that they have to startup fast and be ready to type.
<code>bc</code> certainly qualifies.
Just remember to set the scale!
Or use the <code>--mathlib</code> option.</p>

<pre><code>bc 1.07.1

</code></pre>

<p><code>dc</code> has reverse-polish notation (RPN) but is very terse.
Tokens are separated by spaces or newlines.
Thus, the Enter key doesn&rsquo;t print a result. You need to use the <code>p</code> command.
Again, the default is integer math.
Use the <code>k</code> command to switch scale.</p>

<pre><code>1 2 3 + + p
6
4 3 / p
1
3 k 4 3 / p
1.333
</code></pre>

<p>A weird part is that you need to enter negative numbers using the underscore (<code>_3</code> for -3).</p>

<p>By contrast, my favourite calculator in the terminal right now is <code>orpie</code>.
You get reverse-polish notation and immediate feedback.</p>

<p>Emacs comes with <code>M-x quick-calc</code> which simply asks for an expression and prints the result:</p>

<pre><code>Result: 1 + 2 + 3 =&gt;  6  (16#6, 8#6, 2#110, &quot;^F&quot;)
</code></pre>

<p>Then there&rsquo;s <code>M-x calculator</code> which comes with its own mode. You can use <code>o h</code> to switch output to hex, for example. So adding up 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 results in 10, or A in hex.</p>

<pre><code>Calc==H&gt; A
</code></pre>

<p>And finally there is <code>M-x calc</code>.
Check out the <a href="https://github.com/ahyatt/emacs-calc-tutorials/blob/master/README.org">short tutorials</a> by Andrew Hyatt, if you&rsquo;re interested in learning more.
As I said above, this is my default solution. <code>1 RET 2 RET 3 RET + +</code> and there we go. Plus a trail over on the right in case you&rsquo;re confused.</p>

<pre><code>---------------------- Emacs Calculator Mode ---------------------- |----- Emacs Calculator Trail -----

<p>Copying the result runs into a tiny problem, for me: The stack depth is copied along with it! So if you copy the above result (6), what you actually get is <code>1: 6</code>. Which is never what I want to paste elsewhere. Never.</p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://sfba.social/@kickingvegas" title="@kickingvegas@sfba.social">@kickingvegas</a> suggested <a href="https://github.com/kickingvegas/casual?tab=readme-ov-file#calc-elisp-library-casual-calc">casual-calc</a>, which is part of &ldquo;a project to re-imagine the primary user interface for Emacs using keyboard-driven menus&rdquo;.</p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://helvede.net/@m" title="@m@helvede.net">@m</a> suggested <a href="https://qalculate.github.io/">qcalc</a> which also offers “currency conversion”:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The exchange rates can be updated manually using File → Update Exchange Rates, or automatically at specific intervals (by default once every week, but this can be changed in the preferences dialog), when needed (when currencies are converted).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apparently it gets the exchange rates from the European Central Bank and Coinbase App APIs.</p>

<p>Another option is spreadsheets, of course.
<a class="account" href="https://merveilles.town/@neauoire" title="@neauoire@merveilles.town">@neauoire</a> mentioned <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/nebu">nebu</a>.
I don&rsquo;t have a Varvara system up and running, however.</p>

<p>There is <code>sc</code>, of course.
If you don&rsquo;t want to hit <code>=</code> for every number you enter, use <code>-n</code> for &ldquo;quick numeric entry&rdquo;.
I&rsquo;m not sure how I can quickly select the range for something like <code>@sum(A0:A2)</code> but it certainly seems possible to use <code>sc</code> for interesting stuff.</p>

<pre><code>B2 (10 2 0) [B0/B1]

        A         B         C         D         E         F         G

<p>Of course, Emacs also comes with a spreadsheet. Visit an empty file ending with <code>.ses</code>.
Enter a number. To add a new row, use <code>down</code> then create a new cell using <code>TAB</code> and enter a second number.
When you need a formula, use <code>(apply ses+ (ses-range A1 A3))</code>, for example.</p>

## Apple Intelligence: Fud, Dud or Both

John Gruber is not mincing his words. What Apple showed regarding the upcoming “personalized Siri” at WWDC was not a demo. It was a concept video. Concept videos are bullshit, and a sign of a company in disarray, if not crisis. The Apple that commissioned the futuristic “Knowledge Navigator” concept video in 1987 was the &#8230;

## The writer's web

date: 2025-03-13, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>The web was initially <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1866.txt">designed</a> for writers. Styling, links, paragraphs, titles (at all levels). The ability to edit. No character limits. That's what we had to work with when we started blogging in the mid-late 90s.  </p>
<p>Then there was a big <a href="http://scripting.com/2016/09/22/tenYearsUsingTwitter.html">corner-turn</a> in 2006. In an instant the web shrunk to almost nothing. No titles, no style, no links, 140 chars max. Enough to say "I'm waiting in line at the bank." Nothing wrong with that, but it isn't what I think of as writing. </p>
<p>A couple of years ago, I decided to focus on writers once again. I started developing ideas of what <b>the writer's web</b> would look like if we used today's technology. And here are the three main directions.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>New technology</b>. Since the last time we looked, Markdown was invented. RSS feeds had become instant. Websockets replaced long polling. Servers got cheap! And SQL is fast and the tools are much better. We'll use all the best new technology.  </li>
<li><b>Modern interfaces</b>. We'll borrow the best ideas from twitter-like systems. Writing a new post should be as easy as writing a tweet, but with all the features writers need at-hand, easy to access. </li>
<li><b>Open, for real</b>. And best of all, it'll be open, for real, now -- not some day. Each component will be completely replaceable with simple APIs, and lots of example code. </li>
</ul>
<p>I'm going to use WordPress as my basic back-end technology because it is reliable and broadly deployed, but you don't have to. The great thing about the web is that it's already federated. Nothing to wait for. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span> </p>
<p>We know how to do this. The only question is whether we <i>choose</i> to.</p>
<p>Best way to get started -- write a blog post about what the writer's web means to you. Send me a link. I'll read it. </p>

## ★ Something Is Rotten in the State of Cupertino

date: 2025-03-12, updated: 2025-03-14, from: Daring Fireball

Who decided these personalized Siri features should go in the WWDC keynote, with a promise they’d arrive in the coming year, when, at the time, they were in such an unfinished state they could not be demoed to the media even in a controlled environment? Three months later, who decided Apple should double down and advertise these features in a TV commercial, and promote them as a selling point of the iPhone 16 lineup?

He's an expert on Russian history, biographer of Stalin, he talks about what Trump is doing, and as I listened I realized we have not filled in how crazy or challenged the leaders of the other huge powers are. Trump apparently is not an outlier. Putin can't keep the war going in Europe indefinitely, their banking system is running on fumes and the people are tired of war (unlike in the US they feel their wars). There's tremendous corruption in the Chinese military, so Xi isn't rushing to try to take over Taiwan. It's easier and safer to just keep threatening. In the US we're shocked by what we've become, so quickly, we're failing to see the context. Kotkin also offers a perspective on the new media, relative to when TV and radio were new, and all the chaos the US has survived. He said something I believe is true, it'll be hard to turn America into a totalitarian state because every freaking American today was raised in a country where we had all the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_amendments_to_the_Constitution_of_the_United_States">amendments</a>. It'll be hard to get us to STFU. They have a plan in TrumpLand, but that doesn't mean it will work.

## Thoughts

date: 2025-03-12, from: Doc Searls (at Harvard), New Old Blog

An important extinction. Overheard (between veteran unemployed journalists): &#8220;I&#8217;m not a has-been. I&#8217;m a still-was.&#8221; Because you&#8217;re the only one who might employ you. &#8220;DIY journalism&#8221; just got uttered in a call I&#8217;m on. Its the windows, mostly. I didn&#8217;t like Boeing&#8217;s 787 eight years ago, and still don&#8217;t like it now. That&#8217;s my response [&#8230;]

## Fun with the Sharp Zaurus SL-5500 (and an unexpected OpenBSD link)

date: 2025-03-12, from: Liam on Linux

The <a href="https://medium.com/@alabbe/sharp-zaurus-sl-5500-collie-8254d03964d6">Zaurus SL-5500</a>&nbsp;was an early, tiny, Linux pocket computer-cum-PDA. I had one. Two, in fact.&nbsp;They got stolen from my house. :-(<br /><p>It had a CF card slot, so you could even remove your storage card and insert a CF Wifi card instead, and have mobile Internet in your pocket, 20 years ago!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />But if you did, you got a free extra with a wifi adaptor &ndash; a battery life of about 15-20 minutes.</p> <p>It was clever, but totally useless. With the wifi card in, you  couldn&rsquo;t have external storage any more, so there was very little room  left.</p> <p>I had to check: <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/first-looks/30821/sharp-zaurus-sl-5500" rel="ugc">https://uk.pcmag.com/first-looks/30821/sharp-zaurus-sl-5500</a></p> <p>64MB RAM, 16MB flash, and a 320x240 screen. Or rather 240x320 as it was portrait.</p> <p>The sheer amount of thought and planning that went into the  Linux-based Zaurus was shown by the fact that the tiny physical keyboard  <em>had no pipe symbol.</em> Bit of a snag on an xNix machine, that.</p><p>Both mine were 2nd hand, given to me by techie mates who&rsquo;d played  with them and got bored and moved on. <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/okqjn5/20_years_linux_on_desktop_part_3">I'm told others got better battery</a> life on Wifi. Maybe their tiny batteries were  already on the way out or something.</p> <p><strong>Fun side-note #1:</strong> I do not remember the battery pack looking like this one, though. I feel sure I would have noticed.</p> <p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Battery-Zaurus-SL-5500-900mAh-Li-ion/dp/B007K0DRIU" rel="ugc">https://www.amazon.co.uk/Battery-Zaurus-SL-5500-900mAh-Li-ion/dp/B007K0DRIU</a></p> <p><strong>Fun side-note #2:</strong> both came with Sharp&rsquo;s original  OS, version 1.0. I had an interesting time experimenting with  alternative OS builds, new ROMs etc. Things did get a lot better, or at  least less bad, after the first release. But the friend who gave me my  first unit swore up and down that he&rsquo;d update the ROM. I can&rsquo;t see any  possible mechanism for flash memory to just revert to earlier contents  on its own, though.</p> <p>With replacement OS images you had to decide how to partition the  device&rsquo;s tiny amount of storage: some as read-only for the OS, some as  read-write, some as swap, etc. The allocations were fixed and if you got  it wrong you had to nuke and reload.</p> <p>This would have been <em>much</em> easier if the device had some form of logical volume management, and dynamically-changeable volume sizes.</p> <p>Which is a thought I also had repeatedly around 2023-2024 when  experimenting with OpenBSD. It uses an exceptionally complex  partitioning layout, and if you forcibly simplify it, you (1) run up  against the limitations of its horribly primitive partitioning tool and  (2) reduce the OS&rsquo;s security.</p> <p>I have got just barely competent enough with OpenBSD that between <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/04/22/openbsd_71_released_including_apple/" rel="ugc">writing this</a> in early 2022 and <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/10/version_76_openbsd_of_theseus/" rel="ugc">writing this</a>  in late 2024, two and a half years later, I went from &ldquo;struggling  mightily just to get it running at all in a VM&rdquo; to &ldquo;able with only some  whimpering and cursing to get it dual-booting on bare metal with XP64,  NetBSD, and 2 Linux distros.&rdquo;</p> <p>But it&rsquo;s still a horrible <em>horrible</em> experience and some form of LVM would make matters massively easier.</p> <p>Which is odd because I avoid Linux LVM as much as possible. I find it  a massive pain when you don&rsquo;t need it. However, you need it for Linux  full-disk encryption, and one previous employer&nbsp;of mine insisted upon  that.</p> <p>In other words: I really dislike LVM, and I am annoyed by Linux  gratuitously insisting on it in situations where it should not strictly  speaking be needed &ndash; but in other OSes and other situations, I have  really wanted it, but it wasn&rsquo;t available.</p><br type="_moz" /><br /><br /><img src="https://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=liam_on_linux&ditemid=94248" width="30" height="12" alt="comment count unavailable" style="vertical-align: middle;"/> comments

## China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea Intelligence Sharing

<blockquote><p>Historically, China, Russia, Iran &#038; North Korea have cooperated to some extent on military and intelligence matters, but differences in language, culture, politics &#038; technological sophistication have hindered deeper collaboration, including in cyber. Shifting geopolitical dynamics, however, could drive these states toward a more formalized intell-sharing partnership. Such a &#8220;Four Eyes&#8221; alliance would be motivated by common adversaries and strategic interests, including an enhanced capacity to resist economic sanctions and support proxy conflicts...</p></blockquote>

<p>I thought about using Migration Assistant to transfer stuff across but then I thought about how much cruft I&rsquo;ve probably built up and went, &ldquo;No, I want to transfer stuff manually so I can be more purposeful about what I have and where I have it!&rdquo; The downside is, now I have to actually make those decisions about what apps to reinstall and how to organise my files 😒 I feel like I need a checklist.</p>

## Nobody should be a “content creator”

date: 2025-03-12, from: Chris Heilmann's blog

As part of my job, I have to keep up with the social media space and I&#8217;m worried, bored and annoyed in equal measures. There is not much social about it any longer. Instead it&#8217;s become a race to the bottom of lowest common denominator content. And interaction bait. Or rage bait. Or just obvious [&#8230;]

<blockquote><p>The US Department of Justice on Wednesday <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-charges-12-chinese-contract-hackers-and-law-enforcement-officers-global">announced</a> the indictment of 12 Chinese individuals accused of more than a decade of hacker intrusions around the world, including eight staffers for the contractor i-Soon, two officials at China&#8217;s Ministry of Public Security who allegedly worked with them, and two other alleged hackers who are said to be part of the Chinese hacker group APT27, or Silk Typhoon, which prosecutors say was involved in the US Treasury breach late last year.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>According to prosecutors, the group as a whole has targeted US state and federal agencies, foreign ministries of countries across Asia, Chinese dissidents, US-based media outlets that have criticized the Chinese government, and most recently the US Treasury, which was breached between September and December of last year.

## Bluesky is not billionaire-proof

date: 2025-03-11, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>First I want to say that <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=bluesky">Bluesky</a> is nice software, good design, attractive, they have a goal and stick to it, and it stays up, no <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/01/the-story-behind-twitters-fail-whale/384313/?gift=f35zZN0v_gDFE8xNwlQAHSNkdwehtNpsP-bh1d4EoU4&utm_source=copy-link&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=share">fail whales</a> that were so vexing of early days Twitter. </p>
<p>That said, I have two criticisms:</p>
<ul>
<li>They are implementing the same limits that Twitter designed into their product, no styling, no links, you can't edit, no titles, enclosures, and a limit of 300 chars per post. Simple stuff that, if they broke through the Twitter design, would make it a decent platform for writers. I don't see any reason to duplicate the mistakes that Twitter made, in 2006, in the design of their product.</li>
<li>They repeatedly claim to be <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/21/bluesky-ceo-jay-graber-says-x-rival-is-billionaire-proof.html">billionaire-proof</a> but as far as I can tell, and I have built software on their APIs, they are not. Yet they tell users they are safe, and what choice do the users have but to believe them, esp when tech journalism repeats the claims without challenging them. As a result, people believe that if Bluesky were to be acquired by a billionaire, something they might not even be able to stop, they will be able to quickly migrate to something that's the same as Bluesky and keep all their connections, people they follow and people following them. </li>
</ul>
<p>All of this would be nice, if it were true but imho it is not true. I'm going to go through the recent statement from their CEO in the remainder of this piece. I invite them to rebut it, esp <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/user/mmasnick/">Mike Masnick</a> of Techdirt, who has journalistic integrity, is widely respected, and is on the Bluesky board of directors. Honestly I can't understand why Masnick puts his integrity on the line here, I've tried to discuss it with him, and I guess he doesn't take me seriously enough to give a serious response. I would also like to know what his deal is with them, does he profit personally if Bluesky is acquired. That needs to be disclosed, imho. I would do it if I were in his shoes. </p>
<p>If you read my blog, I hope you know that I wouldn't challenge something like this unless I was pretty sure there is an issue. I don't imagine for a second that people would abandon Bluesky if they knew they were locked in and would have no path out if it was bought by a billionaire. I know we can't get out and I still use Bluesky, because that's where the people I want to network with are. They won. So they don't have to deceive. They can stop making this claim. Yet they continue to do it, in pretty much exactly the same terms as they have been doing it all along. </p>
<p>Here's the statement that appeared in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/10/at-sxsw-bluesky-ceo-jay-graber-pokes-fun-at-mark-zuckerberg-with-latin-phrase-t-shirt/">TechCrunch</a> yesterday.</p>
<ul>
<li>“If a billionaire came in and bought Bluesky, or took it over, or if I decided tomorrow to change things in a way that people really didn’t like, then they could fork off and go on to another application,” Graber explained at SXSW. “There’s already applications in the network that give you another way to view the network, or you could build a new one as well. And so that openness guarantees that there’s always the ability to move to a new alternative.”</li>
<li>The quote is from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Graber">Jay Graber</a>, the CEO of the company.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's go through it, point by point</p>
<ul>
<li>"they could fork it off and go on to another application" -- in this sentence "they" applies to developers, because you have to be a developer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)">fork</a> an application. Assuming Bluesky is available in source code, with an appropriate open source license, and they have released enough code so that a developer could quickly launch an exact Bluesky clone, maybe this part is true. I can't evaluate it without going through the exercise of forking their code, but I do know this -- no one has. Why not? I would think that with <a href="https://backlinko.com/bluesky-statistics">27 million users</a>, by now someone would have tried it. Maybe this post will uncover such an instance, or motivate one. I would be happy to try it out to see how it works. But it has to be completely independent of Bluesky. It would have to work, without loss of functionality, if Bluesky's network disappeared.</li>
<li>"there’s already applications in the network that give you another way to view the network" -- this is true. But they don't do very much nor do they have many users. They are basically experiments that show that you could build something else with the format they have defined. This isn't unusual. You can make a lot of different kinds of websites with HTML, for example, but very few of them have millions of users. Same thing with apps built on the Bluesky protocol that use data types that Bluesky itself doesn't understand. I don't think this adds anything to the claim of billionaire-safety. Also if these apps are in the same network, that doesn't give us any independence from Bluesky. So I think this is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOP_(code)">no-op</a>, it adds nothing but confusion to the claim.</li>
<li>"[our] openness guarantees that there’s always the ability to move to a new alternative" -- this is not true, and it's the crux of the concern. There is no such guarantee. If there were, we would be able to move to an alternative now. Where is it? It's not there and imho it can't be there. </li>
</ul>
<p>There are other problems. Mastodon, via its API, actually does what Bluesky claims to do. There are lots of <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-server-instance">instances</a> of Mastodon servers and they interop with each other. It's an incredible proof of concept. But its federation ability adds enough complexity that most people prefer Bluesky, which doesn't have those complications. There are always tradeoffs in technology. You can have flexibility but it comes at a price. Bluesky would have you believe you can have the flexibility of Mastodon without paying the price. </p>
<p>There may be a way to do what they promise, but it would mean removing features, which isn't a bad idea, but they have decided they have to do everything Twitter does and there is the conundrum. Twitter was designed around centralization, and because of that Twitter is <i>not</i> billionaire-proof as has been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk#Business_career">demonstrated</a>, and neither is Bluesky.</p>
<p>Every time I read this quote from their CEO it gets my bile up, and I say things <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com">on Bluesky</a> that I regret later. Instead I decided to take the time this morning to carefully explain the problem and now when they make the claim, I can point to this piece. And maybe I'm wrong, and they can show me an instance I can switch to and not lose access to my network of friends on Bluesky and not depend on the existence of Bluesky itself. That would actually make me happy (I think) and give me a completely new understanding of computer science. </p>

## 2025-03-09 The looming Discord IPO

date: 2025-03-11, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-03-09-the-looming-discord-ipo">2025-03-09 The looming Discord IPO</h1>

<p>So&hellip; Discord might be going there. I like their offering. I even pay them about $10/month.
What they offer works well.
People get their own little communities to administer, with the tools to administer them well, with the self-written automations and bots to handle communities from a handful of people to many thousands.
Read <a class="account" href="https://infosec.exchange/@isotopp" title="@isotopp@infosec.exchange">@isotopp</a>’s <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@isotopp/114116202418228034">perspective on Discord</a>.</p>

<p>But the monetization drive is strong.
And once the shareholders are in place, pressure for monetization will ramp up even more, I&rsquo;m sure. How long until it all goes down? Five years?</p>

<p>What are your backup plans?</p>

<p><a href="https://campaignwiki.org/wiki/Chat">My backup plan</a> is an IRC backend (<a href="https://ngircd.barton.de/">ngircd</a> uses about 5M of memory) and two instances of a web front-end called <a href="https://thelounge.chat/">The Lounge</a>. One of them is free for all and connects to my chat server; the other needs registration and offers file uploads and always-on connectivity (it acts as a &ldquo;bouncer&rdquo;). The two of them take about 150M of memory. Each registered account gets a little SQLite file with the logs. No other resources required.</p>

<p>You can connect to the IRC backend directly using your favourite IRC client, of course. Emacs comes with two of them. Just saying. 😄</p>

<p>For iOS, there&rsquo;s <a href="https://colloquy.app/">Colloquy</a>.</p>

<p>For Android, <a class="account" href="https://tabletop.social/@wandererbill" title="@wandererbill@tabletop.social">@wandererbill</a> suggests <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/io.mrarm.irc/">Revolution IRC</a>.</p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://tabletop.social/@phf" title="@phf@tabletop.social">@phf</a> suggested <a href="https://snikket.org/service/quickstart/">Snikket</a> instead. Installation requires a Docker image.</p>

<p>I dislike Docker, not because of what it is but because of what it implies. A virtual machine inside your virtual machine means that it doesn&rsquo;t auto-update. Upgrading will be tricky. It also means individual deployment requires multiple services such that it ended up being easier for them to supply a Docker image instead of supplying good instructions. I always take that to mean that the setup is brittle and underdocumented. Perhaps I’m wrong but it that’s the suspicion I have.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, I dislike Docker images for my virtual server server (6G memory, 75g storage, 2 cores) because multiple services packaged in a dockerfile usually mean lots of resources required. Frugal computing means that I am loath to accommodate that. I prefer not to upgrade my virtual machine.</p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://tabletop.social/@phf" title="@phf@tabletop.social">@phf</a> also suggested <a href="https://app.revolt.chat/">Revolt</a>.
<a class="account" href="https://tabletop.social/@wandererbill" title="@wandererbill@tabletop.social">@wandererbill</a> created a <a href="https://rvlt.gg/wkBDhJPb">Grenzland Server on Revolt</a>.
<a class="account" href="https://social.city-of-glass.net/users/cidney" title="@cidney@social.city-of-glass.net">@cidney</a> noted that it had Discord-like roles and role management for the server owner to hand out, so perhaps it&rsquo;s quite a suitable replacement.
Revolt can be self-hosted via Docker or self-building. At least there is a lot of info out there.
<a class="account" href="https://social.city-of-glass.net/users/cidney" title="@cidney@social.city-of-glass.net">@cidney</a> also found a wiki pages listing only four known instances including the default one, the largest being Andrew Tate&rsquo;s. 🤮</p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://tabletop.social/@wandererbill" title="@wandererbill@tabletop.social">@wandererbill</a> wanted to give Matrix another spin.
There are two server implementations, Synapse and Dendrite.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At an absolute minimum, Dendrite will expect 1GB RAM. For a comfortable day-to-day deployment which can participate in federated rooms for a number of local users, be prepared to assign 2-4 CPU cores and 8GB RAM — more if your user count increases. &ndash; <a href="https://element-hq.github.io/dendrite/installation/planning">Planning your installation</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p><a class="account" href="https://tabletop.social/users/kyonshi" title="@kyonshi@tabletop.social">@kyonshi</a> suggested <a href="https://jitsi.org/">Jitsi</a>.
I tried to self-host it a few years ago.
It worked well! But it also took a lot of resource. During the video call, the virtual machine&rsquo;s <a href="2020-03-26_Jitsi_and_the_CPU">load went up to 8</a>.
We sometimes use the installation at the <a href="https://ffmuc.net/">Freifunk München</a> for gaming.
Thanks, ffmuc! 😍</p>

<p>So, where does that leave is? I don&rsquo;t know. People don&rsquo;t seem to like The Lounge with IRC backend and I seem to be unwilling to upgrade my hosting commitments.</p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://hackers.town/@mc" title="@mc@hackers.town">@mc</a> recently recommended a different IRC server called <a href="https://ergo.chat/about">Ergo</a> and a different web front-end called <a href="https://codeberg.org/emersion/gamja">Gamja</a> but it&rsquo;s unclear to me what significant advantages either would offer.</p>

<p>Previously:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So… the situation is bad, but I still use Discord. &ndash; <a href="2022-08-16_Discord">Discord</a> (2022)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a class="account" href="https://tilde.zone/@dashdsrdash" title="@dashdsrdash@tilde.zone">@dashdsrdash</a> wrote wrote in with some interesting feedback. The Zulip part is interesting because I only used it for tiny bit, talking to the maintainers of Antora. Here&rsquo;s what they have to say:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Zulip is great for UI, slightly aggravating to run. It absolutely wants a dedicated server. It has a dice roller as one of the sample bots, and the API is extensive.</li>
<li>IRC is extremely easy to setup and relatively easy to write bots for. Interfaces vary from bare bones to not-bad; The Lounge is up on the not-bad end, and also easy to host.</li>
<li>Matrix may be the future of federated chat systems, but if you don&rsquo;t need federation, the complexity and ongoing maintenance are not worth it.</li>
<li>Jitsi has integrated chat but is video-conferencing-centric; the text chat is actually Prosody (an XMPP/Jabber) server under the hood. Video processing takes up a lot of CPU and bouncing it around takes a lot of bandwidth; otherwise, it&rsquo;s pretty nice.</li>
<li>I haven&rsquo;t tried running Revolt but I looked at the docs and I am really not favorably inclined. They have some questionable technology choices and insist on a Docker-first install that in my experience is a likely sign that there are too many moving parts for anyone to be able to diagnose what&rsquo;s going wrong.</li>
</ul>

<p>My suggestions would be:</p>

<ul>
<li>IRC is still a solid choice</li>
<li>Prosody without the Jitsi video conferencing is pretty nice, albeit a little complex to configure initially.</li>
<li>If I felt like spending the money for a medium-large VM at a hosting service dedicated to gaming, Zulip would be nice.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t know about the hosting of Zulip but the rest tracks my experience. IRC is the simplest option.</p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://social.vivaldi.net/@randomwizard" title="@randomwizard@vivaldi.net">@randomwizard</a> is giving <a href="https://galene.org/">Galène</a> a try. Videoconferencing that might not be as hard to setup correctly as self-hosted Jitsi!</p>

## 2025-03-11 Distrusting US arms dealers

date: 2025-03-11, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-03-11-distrusting-us-arms-dealers">2025-03-11 Distrusting US arms dealers</h1>

<p>Ah, this is where the quotes come from:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He’s done everything to discredit and demean Zelensky on the international stage with the shameful press conference in which he teamed up with the vice president to attack Zelensky,” said Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.). He pressed Whitaker, and other State Department nominees in the hearing, over whether Trump is a Russian asset. “What else could a Russian asset actually possibly do that Trump hasn’t yet done? – <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5175978-matthew-whitaker-nato-trump/">Trump’s NATO nominee commits to alliance, despite MAGA opponents</a>, by Laura Kelly, for The Hill</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the same piece:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Moreover — people should not assume that Trump’s policies are destructive for NATO. If anything, pushing European allies to increase defense spending is going to strengthen NATO.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, I&rsquo;m assuming that a NATO full of bootlickers would be great for Trump as he and Putin divvy up Europe.</p>

<p>I bet every European country that bough US equipment is super angry right now.</p>

<p>I am super angry because Switzerland, after a long fight against the new fighter planes, after considering Swedish and French fighter planes, decided to go with the planes that are the most expensive, the most unreliable (based on my uninformed opinions), and the most untrustworthy: the F-35.</p>

<p>From a country that bullies its allies and betrays its friends, that switches off the satellite phones, the intelligence sharing, and whatever else it damn pleases in order to force a settlement. Which is within their rights, of course. But also disqualifies them as a friend for a generation, if you ask me.</p>

<p>A country with the most powerful military in the world and the wisdom of a tooth that needs to be pulled. 🤮</p>

<p>And we&rsquo;re not even part of NATO.</p>

<p>⁂</p>

<p>For more about the F-35, <a class="account" href="https://agora.echelon.pl/users/kravietz" title="@kravietz@agora.echelon.pl">@kravietz</a> recently linked to this article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>With over 400 F-35s projected for Europe by 2030, per Lockheed Martin, the jet remains a cornerstone of NATO’s air power—but its integration highlights a paradox: its technological edge comes at the cost of strategic vulnerability. The U.S. policy restricting independent test operations outside CONUS, combined with reliance on U.S.-managed MDFs, ALIS, ODIN, and software updates, amplifies fears of over-dependence. &ndash; <a href="https://theaviationist.com/2025/03/10/f-35-kill-switch-myth/">The F-35 ‘Kill Switch’: Separating Myth from Reality</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p><a class="account" href="https://agora.echelon.pl/users/kravietz" title="@kravietz@agora.echelon.pl">@kravietz</a> adds:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>… but the problem is not technical. The problem is that in 2025 US has rather clearly signalled that its subjectively defined “interests” will now have priority of international agreements.</p>

<p>That is, the same agreements towards which the US has over the 30 years consistently pushed all European countries, and especially the new EU and NATO joiners. And it made sense as long as the US was the guarantor of these treaties.</p>

<p>What we have now? Let’s say Russia conducts a limited military incursion into eastern Poland with the objective of controlling the Suwalki Corridor. This of course is in violation of UN Charter, NATO Charter and a hundred of bilateral treaties between Russia and EU and Poland. So what? The 2025 US president now decides a “prolonged defense” is “not in US interests” and does everything to force “peace” on Poland.</p>

<p>“Everything” includes impairing US-delivered weapons systems and generally creating a powerful impression of stab in the back.</p>

<p>A “peace”, in which Poland’s concession is the town of Suwałki, and Russia’s “concession” is the nearby town of Olsztyn, which Russia mercifully agrees not to occupy or destroy. Well, it also happens to be a Polish town but Russia in the meantime declared it “historically Russian region” and it now presents it as a concession.</p>

<p>And the 2025 US president says it’s OK, because “peace” and “both sides did concessions”.</p>

## 2025-03-11 Chainsaw politicians

date: 2025-03-11, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-03-11-chainsaw-politicians">2025-03-11 Chainsaw politicians</h1>

<p>Recovery from DOGE is hard.</p>

<p>To put recovery from DOGE into perspective: In tiny Switzerland we elected prime right-winger Blocher into government and he ran the justice department for a handful years. And he fired a lot of people for efficiency. And the institutions are still struggling twenty years later. People fired find new jobs, new careers, early retirements. People staying work hard, burn out, are angry, work on projects and switch tracks before the projects run into walls. The institutional memory keeps shrinking as the new recruits are younger and younger. Suddenly the seniors have been here for just four years. It’s a disgrace. A festering wound. All the jobs are overwhelming and people are drained when they take these positions and they leave again or burn out or struggle or backstab.</p>

<p>And of course everybody who was against the cuts isn’t automatically in favour of increasing the budgets and raising taxes when the chainsaw politicians are gone. But the jobs still needs to get done and so quality goes down and waiting times increase and you can all join the slow march of institutional death and hope for that rekindling of the founding spirit, when having working institutions are a goal again, when the empathy-deprived scrooges are long gone.</p>

BTW it's worth <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/02/24/153052.html">calling attention</a> to a bit I linked to yesterday. <i>Cross-posting to Bluesky and Mastodon is not on the roadmap for WordLand.</i> They are too limited in the features they support for writers. This is a big point, not a casual thing. I am trying to create a network that's like stereo to mono. We're not going to try to scale down writing in WordLand so it fits into the tight little featureless well-silo'd boxes in order to peer with those systems. Instead, I want to force them to give writers a decent surface to write on. Somehow we lost our minds and decided deliberately to limit communication to grunts and snorts, and it should not be a surprise that when our civilization migrated to them, it became unable to understand complex ideas. I guarantee you Carl Sagan, if he were alive, would have seen this. Or maybe not? I don't know. But it's a bizarre situation that I've decided to try to fix.

The word is starting to spread about <a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a>. And the product is holding up pretty well. There are some issues in Safari with the toolbar that pops up over selection. I see people pasting in URLs that makes me think it's not working for them. Don Park started using it. I did my first project with Don in the late 80s. The project was very successful. His respect means a lot to me. The positioning -- it makes WordPress as easy to write for as Twitter, is great to hear as users write about it. That was one of the major design goals. What people are missing, and it's right in front of their eyes, they can use writing features that somehow never made it to the twitter-like systems, the ones listed on the <a href="https://textcasting.org/">textcasting memorandum</a> (or manifesto, whichever you prefer). I'm glad people are seeing this as an enhancement to WordPress, not an attempt to create a new community. I want <i>all</i> WordPress writers to use this product. Every one of them. I want people to feel that it's an essential part of WordPress, for writers. The writer's web. Remember that, you'll be hearing a lot about that. And I want to be sure we fix all the bugs, and add all the features they believe are missing, as long as the features pertain to writing. Everything else is well-covered by the main product. There's also an API that comes with WordLand, I'll be talking more about that later. Makes it easier to write WordPress apps in JavaScript that run in the browser.

## Thousands of WordPress Websites Infected with Malware

<p>The malware includes <a href="https://cside.dev/blog/thousands-of-websites-hit-by-four-backdoors-in-3rd-party-javascript-attack">four separate backdoors</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Creating four backdoors facilitates the attackers having multiple points of re-entry should one be detected and removed. A unique case we haven&#8217;t seen before.

Lately, political writers have called attention to the tendency of billionaire Elon Musk to refer to his political opponents as &#8220;NPCs.&#8221; This term comes from the gaming world and refers to a nonplayer character, a character that follows a scripted path and cannot think or act on its own, and is there only to populate the world of the game for the actual players.

## Tag, you're it

date: 2025-03-09, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>I’m a bit behind in my RSS feeds and I didn’t realize <a href="https://www.susanjeanrobertson.com/writing/tag-youre-it/">Susan tagged me</a> to answer a series of questions about my blog. I’ve read dozens of these and to be honest was feeling a little left out, so thanks Susan for including me! (Susan’s one of my favorite bloggers and crafters, be sure to like and subscribe.)</p>
<h2>Why did you start blogging in the first place?</h2>
<p>I published a zine in high school with my best friend Mike. Our zine Wimpkiller was a creative outlet for all the composition notebooks we filled up over a bottomless cups of coffee at IHOP. We’d print out stories on Mike’s computer, chop ‘em up, glue ‘em together, and then scam copies after midnight with the help of the friendly late-shift worker at Kinko’s. I enjoyed that thrill of self-publishing then as much as I do now. It felt like the garage band of writing. You may not be good or ever get famous, but you can brute force some art into the world.</p>
<p>In college blogs became a trend. I created a blog as I graduated from college to chronicle my entry into the corporate world and ended up chronicling my move and life in Japan. It served as a form of catharsis and outward processing as well as keeping my friends and family up to date on my adventures. That blog died after I came back from Japan and had to get a job and start a career.</p>
<p>Meeting Jeffery Zeldman at SXSW was the inspiration for this edition of the blog, if you can believe it. A brief encounter but my key takeaway on how I could become more like my web development heroes was to write more. They write, and writing begets books, and books begets conference talks. It seemed like a template I could follow and I started self-publishing again. Over time, I wrote enough to where I got to write on <a href="https://alistapart.com/">Jeffrey’s blog</a> and speak at his conference a handful of times. I guess the plan worked out.</p>
<h2>What platform are you using to manage your blog and why did you choose it?</h2>
<p>I started on WordPress but <a href="https://daverupert.com/2012/11/brander-newer/">I moved my blog to Jekyll in 2012</a>. I chose Jekyll because I was into Ruby at the time and fighting with WordPress for good performance was exhausting me. I wanted a simpler authoring and development experience. The simplicity of building with markdown files on <code>localhost</code> still resonates with me.</p>
<h2>Have you blogged on other platforms before?</h2>
<p>I’ve used Blogger, MovableType, WordPress, and Jekyll. There’s also an ill-fated Eleventy branch on my site that never made it to production. I’m sure Jekyll will implode and I’ll need to find something else, but switching platforms would be a distraction for me at this point without some obvious benefit or process improvement.</p>
<h2>How do you write your posts? For example, in a local editing tool, or in a panel/dashboard that’s part of your blog?</h2>
<p><a href="https://daverupert.com/2021/09/my-notion-blogging-kanban/">I write my posts in a giant Notion kanban</a>. It’s overkill but it’s my overkill. The organization capabilities and “markdown-like” aspects of Notion made it a good fit over a folder-o’-files. Before publishing, my posts go through a series of <a href="https://daverupert.com/2021/10/pre-publish-blogging-rituals/">pre-publishing rituals</a>. With those processes combined I maintain a level of quality and throughput that I’m happy with.</p>
<h2>When do you feel most inspired to write?</h2>
<p>I find time to write after the kids go to bed. If there’s time during the workday, I may spend a lunch break jotting some thoughts too. My blogging is very work-dependent to the extent that sometimes <a href="https://daverupert.com/2020/09/boredom-begets-boredom/">when I’m productive at work, I’m most productive at blogging</a>. But often, I’m too tired or focusing on other tasks to craft a well-reasoned blog post.</p>
<h2>Do you publish immediately after writing, or do you let it simmer a bit as a draft?</h2>
<p>Most of my drafts simmer for weeks if not months or years. From time to time I’ll do a one day turnaround on a post and that’s rewarding, but it’s inconsistent. At the time of writing I have 22 active drafts where ”active” means I’ve updated them at least once in the last six months. If I increase the scope to one year, there’s 41 drafts in my kanban.</p>
<h2>What are you generally interested in writing about?</h2>
<p>I’m a generalist at heart and enjoy writing about technology generally. If you look at my archive it’s pretty rare that two consecutive posts will be thematically similar. I write about specific technologies like CSS but also about game development or the capital-W Web. And of course prototypes, which I’m convinced are the not-so-secret sauce for building great technologies.</p>
<p>One direction I’m slipping towards in my mind is futurism and speculative fiction (e.g. <a href="https://daverupert.com/stories/">sci-fi</a>). Writing about current technology limits you to existing capitalist and corporate structures. Imagining the future <a href="https://daverupert.com/2017/10/a-good-science-fiction-story/">and the potential fallout</a> allows you to think without the confines of “Good because make money” which so much of our discourse is today.</p>
<h2>Who are you writing for?</h2>
<p>Woof. Good question. 90% of the time I’m writing to get ideas out of my head. Transfiguring ideas into text works wonders for me. I also tend to write for an abstract audience, people who are curious about the web and technology yet crave more from it; a person who considers themselves a technologist, but also factors in morality and other <a href="http://daverupert.com/2024/04/thoughts-on-cosmotechnics/">cosmotechnics</a>.</p>
<h2>What’s your favorite post on your blog?</h2>
<p><a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/08/quick-thoughts-on-chips/">Quick Thoughts on Chips</a> (2023) is up there but I feel like <a href="https://daverupert.com/2013/04/responsive-deliverables/">Responsive Deliverables</a> (2013) aka, the “tiny bootstraps” post, is a level of quality, thoughtfulness, and timelessness that I don’t achieve often. I’d like more “timeless” pieces like that, but I don’t exactly know how or if it’s worth trying to bottle that magic.</p>
<h2>Any future plans for your blog? Maybe a redesign, a move to another platform, or adding a new feature?</h2>
<p>I’m pretty comfortable with my site, but I have a couple changes in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c13gpBrnGEw&amp;t=225s">Use named grid lines</a></li>
<li>Blowout my tag pages with custom art direction</li>
<li>Make my mobile layout perfect</li>
<li>Write more <a href="https://daverupert.com/stories/">shitty sci-fi</a></li>
<li>Switch from Notion to Obsidian</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of those will happen over the course of a year, some in the dark of night, some never.</p>
<h2>Tag ‘em.</h2>
<p>What a responsibility to add people to this chain letter! Susan told me if I don’t forward this to 10 people, my grandparents will die! That seems extreme but okay. I’ll tag the following people who I think haven’t written one yet:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://zeldman.com/">Jeffrey Zeldman</a> - it feels fitting to pass the mic back to Jeffrey.</li>
<li><a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/">Eric Meyer</a> - another blogger that inspired me in my early days</li>
<li><a href="https://melanie-richards.com/">Melanie Richards</a> - a multi-talented person and another one of my favorite crafters.</li>
<li><a href="https://livelaugh.blog/">Jenn Schiffer</a> - talented artist and consistently way funnier than everyone else in the room.</li>
<li><a href="https://ericwbailey.website/">Eric Bailey</a> - one of my favorite web thinkers and also has <a href="https://buttondown.com/ericwbailey">the most interesting newsletter</a> out there.</li>
<li><a href="https://blakewatson.com/">Blake Watson</a> - deliverer of home-cooked applications</li>
<li><a href="https://joshcollinsworth.com/">Josh Collinsworth</a> - thoughtful blogger and word puzzle game developer</li>
</ul>
<p>Shoot. Only seven. Sorry, memaw and pepaw. Hopefully some unnamed individuals will answer the call.</p>

The issue is the same. When people post only to get attention, forget about anything useful getting done there. It's strictly a broadcast system. So the investment Masto and Bluesky make in discourse is imho wasted complexity. What we want is linking, not replies. If they were the web, they would be designed very differently. Anyway, in 2000, I asked people to put their ideas on their own sites, send me a link, and maybe I'll post it on my site. That right there is the plan for the new network. Facilitating that, it's as easy as posting on a twitter-like system (the early users <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2025/03/07/first-drafting/">confirm</a> that!), but the post goes into <i>your</i> space ie your blog, and a link goes to the person you're responding to, and it's up to them whether or not they want to amplify it, using their own criteria, in their space, to their subscribers. It's why twitter failed to be a keg of revolutionary ideas, instead one of warring factions in a prison. Not able to leave, but not able to do anything either.

## Fucking Republicans and Medicare

date: 2025-03-09, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I am hereby changing the name of "Republicans" to "Fucking Republicans" because that's what they do and what we're going to do to them. Today's issue is Medicare, which hits home to me, a person who planned for health care and depends on Medicare.</p>
<p>I need my Medicare. It's my health insurance. Health insurance always been a problem for me, with pre-existing conditions, and at one point a lapsed corporate plan.</p>
<p>I finally got on solid ground or so I thought when I turned 65 a few years ago. Now I find out that the Repubs are going to cancel or reduce my insurance, and I don't imagine that a person my age, with my pre-existing conditions (we all have them once at this age) I could get insurance.</p>
<p>So please tell me Republicans, how this is meant to work? I am not stupid and I know Medicare is not out of money. Am I going to be paying out of pocket for my health care? Are there any doctors or hospitals who even do this any longer?</p>
<p>Repubs, if my Medicare goes down, you are going down too.</p>
<p>PS: The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLLFeZGeXbA">inspiration</a> for this fucking idea. </p>

## Krugman's paywall

date: 2025-03-09, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I'm not a paid subscriber to anything on Substack. But I do read a few of their newsletters when they come out, including <a href="https://paulkrugman.substack.com/">Paul Krugman's</a>. Almost always must-read stuff. </p>
<p>But he also writes on the "other side of the paywall." When he announced it, he said he doesn't need the money, so I wondered why he does it. I kept reading anyway.</p>
<p>But he does something incredibly annoying and as clueless imho as the things he calls out in his writing — I only find out an article is on the other side of the paywall after I've read the first few paragraphs. I am a fan and I would send the money directly if he asked for it, but not via Substack.</p>
<p>Here's an <a href="https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/the-clean-little-secret-of-social">example</a> of such a post. </p>
<p>So because I don't pay I have to lose that time every time you do this? Have some respect for us who read you. I'm as old as he is, and I like to use my time well. So please either get rid of the stinking paywall, or warn us up front.</p>
<p>And also consider getting off <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=substack">Substack</a>. It's not a good look.</p>

## Talking Right

date: 2025-03-08, from: Doc Searls (at Harvard), New Old Blog

Great speech by David Brooks at a recent ARC conference in London. I read here that he was booed and heckled, but in the video one only sees smiles, warmth, and occasional laughs (e.g. to &#8220;At Chicago I had a double major in history and celibacy&#8221;). It&#8217;s a short, deep, and caring talk that comes from [&#8230;]

## Bookings

date: 2025-03-08, from: Doc Searls (at Harvard), New Old Blog

Even in a small city such as Bloomington, one can make fun discoveries all the time. Yesterday, for example, I discovered Redbud Books, which had a table set up to sell books from Cory Doctorow&#39;s increasingly vast oeuvre while the man himself spoke to a packed classroom in the Media School here at Indiana University. He&#39;ll [&#8230;]

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/images/2018/10/04/gumby.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Praise from David, author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Small-Pieces-Loosely-Joined-Unified/dp/0738205435">Small Pieces Loosely Joined</a> and co-author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cluetrain-Manifesto-End-Business-Usual/dp/0738204315">Cluetrain Manifesto</a>, is the best. He picked up <a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a> overnight, and he loves it, for the right reasons. WordLand is an editor for "small pieces," maybe the first. Most of the really easy editors have been stuck in silos and thus are dead-ends. I'm sure the people who designed them wished they weren't locked up, but they had to work for billionaires-to-be, I don't. I called the locked-up editors <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/14/031201.html">tiny little text boxes</a>. I created an editor that starts out slightly larger than the TLTBs, and grows as your idea grows. So David opened up <a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a> and started typing. And it turned into a <a href="https://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/2025/03/08/trying-out-wordland-for-blogging/">normal sized blog post</a>. It flowed right into it. And unlike the TLTB's in twitter-like worlds, those bits live on the open web, and can use all the features of the web, and are fed out to software networks via <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a>, which is a lot simpler than other protocols. It can grow faster because there already is a huge installed base of software and knowledge for RSS. Imho developers should <a href="https://this.how/standards/">build on existing standards</a>, not try to replace them. They might be more <a href="https://isrssdead.com/">alive</a> than you think (or more accurately, wish).

I updated the <a href="https://this.how/wordland/#1734985792000">screen shot</a> on the WordLand <a href="https://this.how/wordland/">docs page</a>. It was really out of date. <a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a> is the best editor for people to write in WordPress. I've been developing it over the last couple of years. I wanted to get a really nice editor into this slot. I felt WordPress deserved one. It's designed to feel like the editor in twitter-like services, but without the limits. I've been writing about this <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=textcasting">on my blog</a>, while I was doing that, I was developing WordLand in the background. We have ignored the needs of writers for too long. It's time to remove the limits. People believed the formula Twitter arrived at was the right one. It is far too limited for writers. WordLand is the answer, in software.

## Pancake Day

date: 2025-03-08, from: Jessica Smith's blog

<p>Earlier this week, I took Indie on her first trip into the Melbourne <abbr title="Central Business District">CBD</abbr>. Viv&rsquo;s office was celebrating Pancake Day, and Viv thought it was the perfect excuse to bring Indie in an introduce her to everybody! So I did, and <a href="https://www.jayeless.net/2025/03/04.html" title="link to my statuses from 4 March 2025">it went fine</a>.</p>
<p>Pancake Day, though. When Viv first told me his office was doing this, my reaction was, &ldquo;Oh… is that a French thing?&rdquo; Because my high school used to do an annual Pancake Day too (or, well, for us it was &ldquo;Crêpe Day&rdquo;), and I thought that used to be in March too, and for us it was <em>definitely</em> a French thing. They used to get a Real-Life French Guy™ in to make the crêpes, and if you were unfortunate enough to be in the French class like I was, you were under strict instructions to order <em>in French</em>, and the French teacher would hover around the crêpe table like a hawk to make sure his students actually did it. At least we got tasty crêpes out of it to eat, I guess. It did seem a <em>bit</em> unfair that the Chinese students <em>also</em> got to eat crêpes <em>without</em> the hassle of ordering in French, but such is life.</p>
<p>So anyway, I explained this to Viv, but his answer? He didn&rsquo;t know if it was a French thing. OK, very helpful.</p>
<p>But then! On the day, I posted on Mastodon, and <a href="https://miraz.me/">Miraz<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&thinsp;<svg style="height: 0.7em; width: 0.7em;" focusable="false" data-prefix="fas" data-icon="external-link-alt" class="svg-inline--fa fa-external-link-alt fa-w-16" role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><title>(external link)</title><path fill="currentColor" d="M432,320H400a16,16,0,0,0-16,16V448H64V128H208a16,16,0,0,0,16-16V80a16,16,0,0,0-16-16H48A48,48,0,0,0,0,112V464a48,48,0,0,0,48,48H400a48,48,0,0,0,48-48V336A16,16,0,0,0,432,320ZM488,0h-128c-21.37,0-32.05,25.91-17,41l35.73,35.73L135,320.37a24,24,0,0,0,0,34L157.67,377a24,24,0,0,0,34,0L435.28,133.32,471,169c15,15,41,4.5,41-17V24A24,24,0,0,0,488,0Z"></path></svg></span></a> kindly enlightened me as to the origins of &ldquo;Pancake Day&rdquo;, or as it&rsquo;s also known, &ldquo;Shrove Tuesday&rdquo;… the day exactly 47 days before Easter Sunday, or the last day before Lent. This gave me enough information to look it up, and as such I found out that it is <em>also</em> a French thing, and in that language it is called… Mardi Gras! Of course, in Australia we had our Mardi Gras last Saturday, but uhhh, ours is very different (and seems to never actually have been held on a Tuesday; Wikipedia claims queer activists named it that because &ldquo;the term <i>Mardi Gras</i> had become synonymous with street festivals&rdquo;, so there you go). Nonetheless, I suppose this explains why the Sydney Gay &amp; Lesbian Mardi Gras is always (excluding the first three) held at around that time of year – proximity to the pancake version! All the puzzle pieces fall into place.</p>

## POWER9 OS update and other news

date: 2025-03-08, from: Jirka's blog

I finally have upgraded my POWER9 workstation. I was running the Fedora  {sup}1{/sup} 38 for  years and it was  already unsupported. So some  weeks ago I upgraded to 39. Today  I have upgraded to 40. The current  one is 41 so it isn't that bad as it was two months ago.

Just a  short note:  the Fedora  41 for  ppc64le is  now running  on my Blackbird (my  POWER9 machine)! I'm  still using  X.org here so  no big changes actually happened so far.
