## 2025-03-15 Canada

date: 2025-03-15, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-03-15-canada">2025-03-15 Canada</h1>

<p>Today I saw somebody posting a message about Trump&rsquo;s threats to annex Canada from a friend that wanted to remain anonymous. It seems pretty important to me because that&rsquo;s how every former friend of the US is going to react. Greenland is an autonomous territory in the Kingdom of Denmark. Denmark is part of Europe. Denmark spent a lot to support Ukraine. The USA threatened to abandon Ukraine. Both Denmark and Canada are part of NATO. The USA is not behaving like a friend and ally. Not at all.</p>

<p>Trump is a Russian asset.</p>

<p>People will remember.</p>

<p>For reference, aid to Ukraine:</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="ukraine-aid-2025.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The US has contributed $69bn, Europe has contributed $66bn, the biggest contributors being Germany with $13.6bn, UK with $10.8bn, Denmark with $8.1bn, and so on. Source: <a href="https://www.ifw-kiel.de/topics/war-against-ukraine/ukraine-support-tracker/">Kiel Institute for the World Economy: War against Ukraine</a>.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the message I mentioned at the top:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One thing I&rsquo;ve learned over the past few weeks, and it&rsquo;s been a bit of a sobering lesson, is that a lot of Americans I know don&rsquo;t actually know what&rsquo;s going on between the US and Canada right now, and just how seriously Canadians are taking this. So, against my better judgement, here&rsquo;s a timeline to explain why we&rsquo;re here, and why we&rsquo;re angry.</p>

<p>Nov 30th, 2018. The United States, Canada and Mexico finalize a trade agreement. Trump personally negotiates the terms and signs the document, celebrating it as &lsquo;the greatest trade agreement in history&rdquo;. (This is important.)</p>

<p>Nov 29th, 2024. In a face to face meeting, Trump threatens the Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, that he will be imposing 25% tariffs and that if Canada wants to avoid that, it should join the US as a state.</p>

<p>Nov 30th, 2024. Trump publicly calls our Prime Minister &lsquo;Governor Trudeau&rsquo; and instructs his staff to only address him as Governor going forward. He again suggests Canada should join the USA.</p>

<p>Dec 3rd, 2024. Trump remarks that he would split Canada into two states once annexed.</p>

<p>Dec 10th, 2024. Trump posts that the majority of Canadians support annexation, despite public polling that only 13% of Canadians would consider the idea.</p>

<p>Dec 18th, 2024. Trump again falsely states that the majority of Canadians support annexation and that one of his lapdogs, Wayne Gretzky, should have a leadership role in that new scenario.</p>

<p>Jan 7th, 2025. At a press conference, Trump says that he would use economic force to destroy the Canadian economy to annex it.</p>

<p>Jan 14, 2025. Trump again claims that most Canadians want to be American, despite new polls showing only 10% of us are open to the idea.</p>

<p>Jan 20th, 2025. During his inaugural address, Trump says that the U.S. will &lsquo;expand its territory&rsquo; during his second term.</p>

<p>Jan 23rd, 2025. At the World Economic Forum, Trump says that Canada can avoid tariffs and economic collapse if it joins the US. He says this in front of representatives from most countries in the world.</p>

<p>Jan 24th, 2025. Trump states publicly that Canada &lsquo;will&rsquo; become a state</p>

<p>Jan 31st, 2025. Trump announces a 25% tariff on all Canadian imports to begin the next day.</p>

<p>Feb 2nd, 2025. Trump refers to Canada as its &lsquo;Cherished 51st state&rsquo; and that it should join the US to avoid tariffs.</p>

<p>Feb 3rd, 2025. A one month delay is agreed upon. Trump, in a conversation with Trudeau states that he doesn&rsquo;t think existing border treaties with Canada are valid, and need to be revised.</p>

<p>Feb 7th, 2025. In a closed door meeting with his cabinet, Prime Minister Trudeau is recorded, without his knowledge, telling everyone that he believes very strongly that Trump is serious and that he stated his reason for annexation as Canadian resources.</p>

<p>Feb 9th, 2025. In a Super Bowl pre-game interview, Trump says that he&rsquo;s serious about his threats, calling it a &lsquo;viable consideration for expanding US territory&rsquo;</p>

<p>Feb 10th, 2025. Trump announces an additional 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada to come into effect March 12th.</p>

<p>Feb 24th, 2025. Trump publicly remarks that whoever signed the USMCA agreement is an idiot. He was the one that signed it.</p>

<p>March 4th, 5th, and 6th 2025. Tariffs come into effect. Canada retaliates with it&rsquo;s own tariffs. Tariffs are again postponed until April 1st after a huge market backlash.</p>

<p>March 4th, 2025. In an address to a joint session of congress, Trump states that the US will own Greenland &lsquo;one way or the other&rsquo;.</p>

<p>March 5th, 2025. US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick told Canadian finance minister Dominic LeBlanc that Trump &ldquo;had come to realize that the relationship between the United States and Canada was governed by a slew of agreements and treaties that were easy to abandon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>March 7th, 2025. Unconfirmed Memorandum and maps leaked on twitter reveal Trump is allegedly planning to annex the entirety of the great lakes and Southern Ontario, home to 13,491,332 Canadians. This amounts to 35.25% of Canada&rsquo;s total population and includes its largest city, Toronto. This region accounts for 38% of the Canadian economy, and its loss would make Canada&rsquo;s independence functionally impossible.</p>

<p>March 8th, 2025. Canada&rsquo;s foreign minister warns European allies that their government considers Canada to be under existential threat.</p>

<p>March 9th, 2025. Mark Carney, the new Canadian Prime Minister, in his acceptance speech, states that Trump is seeking to destroy Canada, and its way of life.</p>

<p>March 11, 2025. President Trump threatens to “permanently shut down the automobile manufacturing business in Canada” if Canada does not drop a 250% to 390% tariff on U.S. dairy products, which he doesn’t state only kicks in after a certain quantity of tariff-free U.S. dairy enters Canada, a quantity that was originally negotiated and agreed to by Trump during the USMCA in 2018.</p>

<p>In Trump&rsquo;s own words, &ldquo;The only thing that makes sense is for Canada to become our cherished Fifty First State. This would make all Tariffs, and everything else, totally disappear.</p>

<p>Canadians’ taxes will be very substantially reduced, they will be more secure, militarily and otherwise, than ever before, there would no longer be a Northern Border problem, and the greatest and most powerful nation in the World will be bigger, better and stronger than ever — And Canada will be a big part of that. The artificial line of separation drawn many years ago will finally disappear, and we will have the safest and most beautiful Nation anywhere in the World — And your brilliant anthem, “O Canada,” will continue to play, but now representing a GREAT and POWERFUL STATE within the greatest Nation that the World has ever seen!&rdquo;</p>

<p>March 11th, 2025 PT. II. Peter Navarro, a Senior Advisor for Trump is interviewed by MSNBC. When asked about the tariffs he responds with &ldquo;Just tamp it down, please, over there, ok? They&rsquo;re throwing down the hockey gloves. Stop that rhetoric&hellip;we&rsquo;re not going to tolerate anything but them stopping killing Americans&rdquo;, insinuating that this situation was caused by Canadians killing Americans.</p>

<p>March 11th, 2025 PT III. Trump again publicly muses that Canada, Greenland, and the US should be one country, and questions the validity of the Canadian and American border.</p>

<p>To my American friends, I know most of you are amazing and generous people. You didn&rsquo;t ask for this, and I understand that. I hold no ill will towards you, whatsoever. But I must stress, with as much seriousness as I can, the amount of damage this has done.</p>

<p>We have viewed you as our closest friend and ally for a century. We thought of you as brothers and sisters. We answered the call, again and again, for any support you needed from us. Most of Canadians visit the USA so much that we&rsquo;ve seen more of the US than we have the rest of Canada.</p>

<p>American products have been taken off our shelves. Canadians are cancelling travel plans to the US. Photo after photo has been shared on social media of empty flights from Canada to the USA.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t a joke to us. We&rsquo;re not overreacting. We don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s just saying this shit to cause chaos or negotiate a deal. We wholeheartedly believe that our closest ally and friend is about to bring violence across our border, economically destroy us, and eliminate our way of life.</p>

<p>The main driver for Canada&rsquo;s creation in 1867 was SPECIFICALLY to not be part of America, and to end America&rsquo;s very public threats and plans to annex our territory.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re angry. We&rsquo;re really, really fucking angry. Open your eyes to what&rsquo;s happening because we&rsquo;re tired of trying to make you understand why and asking you why it seems like none of you care. **</p>

<p>I still hope that there is time to repair this. I still believe that this is the result of one man&rsquo;s plan to burn it all down. But time is running out, and fast.</p>

<p>&ndash; Anonymous</p>

## 2025-03-15 New window manager: niri

date: 2025-03-15, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-03-15-new-window-manager-niri">2025-03-15 New window manager: niri</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;m giving <a href="https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri">niri</a> a go.
The idea is that a scrollable tiling window manager
(&ldquo;Wayland compositor&rdquo;) is a better fit than just a tiling window manager.
For tiling window managers, I just create new stuff and have it maximized.
I really can&rsquo;t do the quick splitting and rearranging that it seems to afford.
The result is that I start moving stuff to other workspaces, where they&rsquo;re
invisible and gone.
I&rsquo;m hoping that new windows popping up next to existing windows makes it feel
like a stack.</p>

<p>Having gone through the config file and having made a few small changes it
already feels pretty nice. Right now one of the problems I have is that
by sheer bad luck I decided to rotate my external monitor by 90° and that
doesn&rsquo;t work quite as well, maybe? I&rsquo;m not sure. One of the first changes
I did was change the default widths from ⅓ / ½ / ⅔ to 0.95 / ⅔ / ½ with 0.95 being
the default.</p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-03-15, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

I'd love to get a list of old school bloggers who are still at it. How would you go about that? I decided to give it to Gemini, limiting it at first to 100 bloggers. Here's the <a href="https://daveverse.wordpress.com/2025/03/15/finding-old-school-bloggers-who-are-still-at-it/">prompt</a> I wrote. For a while I was wondering what "deep research" was for, but as it's starting the work, I'm thinking of resources that would fit in -- like blogtree.com -- a fascinating site, gives a clear picture how blogs emerge out of the community of an earlier blog. Anyway it's working on it while I write this post. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-03-15, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

An application ChatGPT is great it. You're staring at some code, it's really straightforward, you've done this a thousand times, but it doesn't work. Stare at it some more. Try re-entering it. Change the names of things. Still doesn't work. Copy and paste the problem code into ChatGPT and in an instant it tells you without you even having to ask that your comment isn't properly terminated, so the runtime was never seeing the code, and nothing I did made the slightest difference. The information was there. I had been staring at it, but humans see what we expect to see. Machines don't have that problem, at least not in this way (thinking of hallucinations).

Another BTW, I'm still thinking about how I want to transition from the public and open-to-anyone FeedLand servers. So if you're still using .org or .com, they're still on the air doing the same thing they've been doing all along.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-03-15, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

I asked <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/67d580b2-8a68-8012-ad1a-65f2553978bb">ChatGPT</a> when Google started making HTTPS a requirement. Then I asked when was HTTPS first deployed, and was surprised it was in 1994 in Netscape Navigator. But apparently it was really buggy and wasn't codified until much later. Then I asked when HTTPS became the norm? 2017. So there's a lot of web out there that isn't being maintained by anyone, it just works, that predates HTTPS being widely adopted, if you believe the timelines ChatGPT produced.

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/images/2023/07/05/pinkyFacingLeft.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Why is scripting.com not https? I hope you can see that I have no trouble deploying https sites here. I use <a href="https://caddyserver.com/">Caddy</a> on my Linux servers, and I don't see why anyone uses anything else. It's really easy and requires none of the work people complain about. Anyway the reason scripting.com is http and not https is that the site dates back to 1994, before there was such a thing as https. Google didn't start their push to get the web to convert to https until 2014, 20 years after I started blogging. Have a look at <a href="http://scripting.com/1999/12/31.html">any</a> of <a href="http://scripting.com/fatpages/about.html">my</a> <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/stories/DocSearlsonSteveJobs.html">archived</a> <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1994/10/18/billgatesvstheinternet.html">blog</a> <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1999/05/24/editThisPage.html">posts</a> and <a href="http://scripting.com/frontier/olddefault.html">docs</a>, the're pretty much all there. This is something I'm proud of. I wanted to create a record from the start, it was very deliberate. I was already an experienced developer when the web started up, so I had an idea what I was doing. I also use images on my site, in the right margin of posts, and lately as "inline" images, in their own boxes with a caption. It's a way for me to play with the ideas, and adds color to pages that are almost all text. So if I were to move the site from S3 to one of my hosted servers, which would be a fairly major undertaking on its own and add a lot of overhead because Amazon takes care of a lot of the bullshit you have to deal with, there would be a small matter of what about the images? They would all break if scripting.com was hosted on https and they were served from http. Now you might say -- Dave all you have to do is move all those images to a place with https support and remap the domains, and take care of all the michegas that's going to pop up. Or suffer with broken images. I decided to instead tell Google to stop trying to own something that belongs to no one and everyone. If they want a more secure web, create it, and make a browser for it, and respect the original web alone. Hopefully this clears it up.

## Archival Storage

date: 2025-03-15, from: David Rosenthal's blog

I gave a talk at the Berkeley I-school's <a href="https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/events/ias">Information Access Seminar</a> entitled <i>Archival Storage</i>. Below the fold is the text of the talk with links to the sources and the slides (with yellow background).<br />
<span><a name='more'></a></span>
<br />
<div align="center" style="background-color: #fff8c6; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 8px; padding-left: 8px; padding-right: 8px; padding-top: 8px; padding: 8px;">
<i>Don't, don't, don't, don't believe the hype!</i><br />
Public Enemy<br />
</div>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
I'm honored to appear in what I believe is the final series of these seminars. Most of my previous appearances have focused on debunking some conventional wisdom, and this one is no exception. My parting gift to you is to stop you wasting time and resources on yet another seductive but impractical idea — that the solution to storing archival data is quasi-immortal media.

Archival data is often confused with backup data. Everyone should back up their data. After nearly two decades working in digital preservation, here is how I back up my four important systems:<br />
<ul>
  <li>I run my own mail and Web server. It is on my DMZ network, exposed to the Internet. It is backed up to a Raspberry Pi, also on the DMZ network but not directly accessible from the Internet. Once a week there is a full backup, and daily an incremental backup. Every week the full and incremental backups for the week are written to two DVD-Rs.</li>
  <li>My desktop PC creates a full backup on an external hard drive nightly. The drive is one of a cycle of three.</li>
  <li>I back up my iPhone to my Mac Air laptop every day.</li>
  <li>I create a Time Machine backup of my Mac Air laptop, which includes the most recent iPhone backup, every day on one of a cycle of <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/01/a-lesson-learned.html">three external SSDs</a>.</li>
</ul>
Each week the DVD-Rs, the current SSD and the current hard drive are moved off-site. Why am I doing all this? In case of disasters such as fire or ransomware I want to be able to recover to a state as close as possible to that before the disaster. In my case, the worst case is not more than one week.<br />
<br />
Note the implication that the useful life of backup data is only the time that elapses between the last backup before a disaster and the recovery. Media life span is irrelevant to backup data; that is why backups and archiving are <i>completely different problems</i>.<br />
<br />
The fact that the data encoded in magnetic grains on the platters of the three hard drives is <a href="https://www.abitare.org/papers/ISandT2008.pdf">good for a quarter-century</a> is interesting but irrelevant to the backup task.<br />

I have saved many hundreds of pairs of weekly DVD-Rs but the only ones that are ever accessed more than a few weeks after being written are the ones I use for my annual series of <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/08/2024-optical-media-durability-update.html"><i>Optical Media Durability Update</i></a> posts. It is interesting that:<br />
<blockquote>
  with no special storage precautions, generic low-cost media, and consumer drives, I'm getting good data from CD-Rs more than 20 years old, and from DVD-Rs nearly 18 years old.
</blockquote>
But the DVD-R media lifetime is not why I'm writing backups to them. The attribute I'm interested in is that DVD-Rs are <i>write-once</i>; the backup data could be destroyed but it can't be modified.<br />
<br />
Note that the good data from 18-year-old DVD-Rs means that consumers have an affordable, effective archival technology. But the market for optical media and drives is dying, killed off by streaming, which suggests that consumers don't really care about archiving their data. Cathy Marshall's 2008 talk <a href="http://www.usenix.org/events/fast08/tech/marshall.pdf"><i>Its Like A Fire, You Just Have To Move On</i></a> vividly describes this attitude. Her subtitle is "Rethinking personal digital archiving".<br />
<h2>Archival Data</h2>

<ul>
<li>Over time, data falls down the storage hierarchy.</li>
<li>Data is archived when it can't earn its keep on near-line media.</li>
<li>Lower cost is purchased with longer access latency.</li>
</ul>
</div>
What is a useful definition of archival data? It is data that can no longer earn its keep on readily accessible storage. Thus the fundamental design goal for archival storage systems is to reduce costs by tolerating increased access latency. Data is archived, that is moved to an archival storage system, to save money. Archiving is an <i>economic</i> rather than a technical issue.<br />

How long should the archived data last? The <a href="https://longnow.org/">Long Now Foundation</a> is building the <a href="https://longnow.org/clock/">Clock of the Long Now</a>, intended to keep time for 10,000 years. They would like to accompany it with a 10,000-year archive. That is at least two orders of magnitude longer than I am talking about here. We are only just over 75 years from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Baby">first stored-program computer</a>, so designing a digital archive for a century is a very ambitious goal.<br />

Six years later, this is a picture of, as far as I know, the only write-to-read DNA storage drive ever demonstrated. It is from the Microsoft/University of Washington team that has done much of the research in DNA storage. They published it in 2019's <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-41228-8"><i>Demonstration of End-to-End Automation of DNA Data Storage</i></a>. It cost about $10K and took 21 hours to write then read 5 bytes. <br />
<br />
 The technical press is equally guilty.  The canonical article about some development in the lab starts with the famous IDC graph projecting the amount of data that will be generated in the future. It goes on to describe the amazing density some research team achieved by writing say a gigabyte into their favorite medium in the lab, and how this density could store all the world's data in a teacup for ever. This conveys five false impressions.<br />
<h3>Market Size</h3>
First, that there is some possibility the researchers could scale their process up to a meaningful fraction of IDC's projected demand, or even to the microscopic fraction of the projected demand that makes sense to archive. There is no such possibility. Archival media is a much <i>smaller</i> market than regular media. In 2018's <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2018/03/archival-media-not-good-business.html"><i>Archival Media: Not a Good Business</i></a> I wrote:<br />

<a href="https://digitalpreservation.gov/meetings/DSA2024/loc_dsa2024_website_0104_Lauhoff_Libary_of_Congress_2024_IBM.pdf">IBM's Georg Lauhoff and Gary M Decad's slide</a> shows that the size of the market in dollar terms <i>decreases</i> downwards. LTO tape is less than 1% of the media market in dollar terms and less than 5% in capacity terms. Archival media are a very small part of the storage market. It is noteworthy that in 2023 Optical Archival (OD-3), the most recent archive-only medium, was canceled for lack of a large enough market. It was a 1TB optical disk, an upgrade from Blu-Ray.<br />
<h3>Timescales</h3>
Second, that the researcher's favorite medium could make it into the market in the timescale of IDC's projections. Because the reliability and performance requirements of storage media are so challenging, time scales in the storage market are much longer than the industry's marketeers like to suggest.<br />

Take, for example, Seagate's development of the next generation of hard disk technology, HAMR, where research started <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190813175046/https://www.seagate.com/news/news-archive/seagate-swings-increase-disc-drive-densities-master-pr/">twenty-six years ago</a>. Nine years later in 2008 they published this graph, showing HAMR entering the market in 2009. Seventeen years later it is only now starting to be shipped to the hyper-scalers. Research on data in silica started <a href="https://www.storagenewsletter.com/2014/10/31/rd-hitachi-rw-of-digital-data-in-fused-silica-glass/">fifteen years ago</a>. Research on the DNA medium started <a href="https://doi.org/10.2307/777811">thirty-six years ago</a>. Neither is within five years of market entry.<br />
<h3>Customers</h3>
Third, that even if the researcher's favorite medium did make it into the market it would be a product that consumers could use. As <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/09/more-on-facebooks-cold-storage.html">Kestutis Patiejunas figured out</a> at Facebook more than a decade ago, because the systems that surround archival media rather than the media themselves are the major cost, the only way to make the economics of archival storage work is to do it at data-center scale but in warehouse space and harvest the synergies that come from not needing data-center power, cooling, staffing, etc.<br />

Storage has an analog of Moore's Law called <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/kryders-law/">Kryder's Law</a>, which states that over time the density of bits on a storage medium increases exponentially. Given the need to reduce costs at data-center scale, Kryder's Law limits the service life of even quasi-immortal media. As we see with tape robots, where data is routinely migrated to newer, denser media long before its theoretical lifespan, what matters is the economic, not the technical lifespan of a medium.<br />
<br />
Hard disks are replaced every five years although the magnetically encoded data on the platters is <a href="https://www.abitare.org/papers/ISandT2008.pdf">good for a quarter-century</a>. They are engineered to have a five-year life because Kryder's Law implies that they will be replaced after five years even though they still work perfectly. Seagate actually built drives with 25-year life but found that no-one would pay the extra for the longer life.<br />

Fourth, that anyone either cares or even knows what medium their archived data lives on. Only the hyper-scalers do. Consumers believe their data is safe in the cloud. Why bother backing it up, let alone archiving it, if it is safe anyway? If anyone really cares about archiving they use a service such as Glacier, when they definitely have no idea what medium is being used.<br />

</div>
Fifth, that bit rot is the only threat that matters; the idea that with quasi-immortal media you don't need Lots Of Copies to Keep Stuff Safe.<br />
<br />
No medium is perfect. They all have a specified Unrecoverable Bit Error Rate (UBER) rate. For example, typical <a href="https://www.seagate.com/content/dam/seagate/en/content-fragments/products/datasheets/exos-x24/exos-x24-DS2080-2307US-en_US.pdf">disk UBERs are 10<sup>-15</sup></a>. A petabyte is 8*10<sup>15</sup> bits, so if the drive is within its specified performance you can expect up to 8 errors when reading a petabyte. The specified UBER is an upper limit, you will normally see <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2005/12/tr-2005-166.pdf">far fewer</a>. The <a href="https://cdn.allbound.com/iq-ab/2022/12/LTO-9-TB00068A.pdf">UBER for LT09 tape is 10<sup>-20</sup></a>, so unrecoverable errors on a new tape are very unlikely. But not impossible, and the rate goes up steeply with tape wear.<br />
<br />
The property that classifies a medium as quasi-immortal is not that its reliability is greater than regular media to start with, although as with tape it may be. It is rather that its reliability decays more slowly than that of regular media. Thus archival systems need to use erasure coding to mitigate both UBER data loss and media failures such as disk crashes and tape wear-out.<br />
<br />
Another reason for needing erasure codes is that media errors are not the only ones needing mitigation. What matters is the reliability the system delivers to the end user.  Research has shown that the <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2008/03/more-bad-news-on-storage-reliability.html">majority of end user errors</a> come from layers of the system above the actual media.<br />
<br />
The archive may contain personally identifiable or other sensitive data. If so, the data on the medium must be encrypted. This is a double-edged sword, because the encryption key becomes a single point of failure; its loss or corruption renders the entire archive inaccessible. So you need Lots Of Copies to keep the key safe. But the more copies the greater the risk of key compromise.<br />
<br />
Media such as silica, DNA, quartz DVDs, steel tape and so on address bit rot, which is only one of the threats to which long-lived data is subject.  Clearly a single copy on such media, even if erasure coded, is still subject to threats including fire, flood, earthquake, ransomware, and insider attacks.  Thus even an archive needs to maintain multiple copies. This greatly increases the cost, bringing us back to the economic threat.<br />
<br />
<h2>Archival Storage Systems</h2>
At Facebook Patiejunas built rack-scale systems, each holding 10,000 100GB optical disks for a Petabyte per rack. Writable Blu-Ray disks are about 80 cents each, so the media to fill the rack would cost about $8K. This is clearly much less than the cost of the robotics and the drives.<br />
<br />

<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEikVMu254fhgifS464ejaY2f4YhDSg404cuLeqeGWe24d8TArKR0okskjUVwS7UF_OyD-8TooRJgX39DeUSavW_58SVik6rNJtXerUktsqvLp5ogV-K5MD2Kh_-b75KttqvCvjcLvpfBu317Dq8jcnDYMZfDYdkLjSZh_MrOjEkp2WXxxmr6zdSz2e8ocmE/s970/IBM-TS4300.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="970" data-original-width="834" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEikVMu254fhgifS464ejaY2f4YhDSg404cuLeqeGWe24d8TArKR0okskjUVwS7UF_OyD-8TooRJgX39DeUSavW_58SVik6rNJtXerUktsqvLp5ogV-K5MD2Kh_-b75KttqvCvjcLvpfBu317Dq8jcnDYMZfDYdkLjSZh_MrOjEkp2WXxxmr6zdSz2e8ocmE/s320/IBM-TS4300.png" width="275" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/ts4300">IBM TS4300</a></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
Let's drive this point home with another example. An <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/ts4300">IBM TS4300</a> LTO tape robot <a href="https://www.ibm.com/flashsystem/pricing/us-en/family/TP9JK5">starts at $20K</a>. Two 20-pack tape cartridges to fill it cost about $4K, so the media is about 16% of the total system capex. The opex for the robot includes power, cooling, space, staff and an IBM maintenance contract. The opex for the tapes is essentially zero.<br />
<br />
The media is an insignificant part of the total lifecycle cost of storing archival data on tape. What matters for the economic viability of an archival storage system is minimizing the total system cost, not the cost of the media. No-one is going to spend $24K on a rack-mount tape system from IBM to store 720TB for their home or small business. The economics only work at data-center scale.<br />
<br />
The reason why this focus on media is a distraction is that the fundamental problem of digital preservation is economic, not technical.  No-one wants to pay for preserving data that isn't earning its keep, pretty much the definition of archived data.  The cost per terabyte of the <i>medium</i> is irrelevant, what drives the economic threat is the capital and operational cost of the <i>system</i>. Take tape for example. The media capital cost is low, but the much higher system capital cost includes the drives and the robotics. Then there are the operational costs of the data center space, power, cooling and staff. It is only by operating at data-center scale and thus amortizing the capital and operational costs over very large amounts of data that the system costs per terabyte can be made competitive.<br />
<br />
Operating at data center scale, as <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/09/more-on-facebooks-cold-storage.html">Patiejunas discovered</a> and <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2025/01/storage-roundup.html">Microsoft understands</a>, means that one of the parameters that determines the system cost is <i>write bandwidth</i>. Each of Facebook's racks wrote 12 optical disks in parallel almost continuously. It would take over 800 times the time to write an entire disk to fill the rack.  At the 8x write speed it takes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blu-ray#Drive_speeds">22.5 minutes</a> to fill a disk, so it would take around 18,750 minutes to fill the rack, or about two weeks. It isn't clear how many racks Facebook needed simultaneously doing this to keep up with the flow of user-generated content, but it was likely enough to fill a reasonable-size warehouse. Similarly, it would take about 8.5 days to fill the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/dtl?topic=performance-lto-specifications">base model TS4300</a>.<br />
<h3>Project Silica</h3>
I wrote about <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3600006.3613208">Microsoft's Project Silica</a> a year ago, in <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/03/microsofts-archival-storage-research.html"><i>Microsoft's Archival Storage Research</i></a>. It uses femtosecond lasers to write data into platters of silica.
Like Facebook's, the prototype Silica systems are <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3600006.3613208">data-center size</a>:<br />
<div style="background-color: #fff8c6; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 8px; padding-left: 8px; padding-right: 8px; padding-top: 8px; padding: 8px;">
<blockquote>
A <i>Silica library</i> is a sequence of contiguous write, read, and storage racks interconnected by a platter delivery system.  Along all racks there are parallel horizontal rails that span the entire library. We refer to a side of the library (spanning all racks) as a <i>panel</i>. A set of <i>free roaming</i> robots called <i>shuttles</i> are used to move platters between locations.<br />
...<br />
A read rack contains multiple read drives. Each read drive is independent and has slots into which platters are inserted and removed. The number of shuttles active on a panel is limited to twice the number of read drives in the panel. The write drive is full-rack-sized and writes multiple platters concurrently.
</blockquote>
</div>
Their performance evaluation focuses on the ability to respond to read requests within 15 hours. Their cost evaluation, like Facebook's, focuses on the savings from using warehouse-type space to house the equipment, although is isn't clear that they have actually done so. The rest of their cost evaluation is somewhat hand-wavy, as is natural for a system that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3600006.3613208">isn't yet in production</a>:<br />
<div style="background-color: #fff8c6; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 8px; padding-left: 8px; padding-right: 8px; padding-top: 8px; padding: 8px;">
<blockquote>
The Silica read drives use polarization microscopy, which is a commoditized technique widely used in many applications and is low-cost. Currently, system cost in Silica is dominated by the write drives, as they use femtosecond lasers which are currently expensive and used in niche applications.  ...  As the Silica technology proliferates, it will drive up the demand for femtosecond lasers, commoditizing the technology.
</blockquote>
</div>
I'm skeptical of "commoditizing the technology". Archival systems are a niche in the IT market, and one on which companies are loath to spend money. Realistically, there aren't going to be a vast number of Silica write heads. The only customers for systems like Silica are the large cloud providers, who will be reluctant to commit their archives to technology owned by a competitor. Unless a mass-market application for femtosecond lasers emerges, the scope for cost reduction is limited.<br />
<br />
But the more I think about this technology, which is still in the lab, the more I think it probably has the best chance of impacting the market among all the rival archival storage technologies. Not great, but better than its competitors:<br />
<ul>
<li>The media is very cheap and very dense, so the effect of Kryder's Law economics driving media replacement and thus its economic rather than technical lifetime is minimal.</li>
<li>The media is quasi-immortal and survives benign neglect, so opex once written is minimal.</li>
<li>The media is write-once, and the write and read heads are physically separate, so the data cannot be encrypted or erased by malware. The long read latency makes exfiltrating large amounts of data hard.</li>
<li>The robotics are simple and highly redundant. Any of the shuttles can reach any of the platters. They should be much less troublesome than tape library robotics because, unlike tape, a robot failure only renders a small fraction of the library inaccessible and is easily repaired.</li>
<li>All the technologies needed are in the market now, the only breakthroughs needed are economic, not technological.</li>
<li>The team has worked on improving the  write bandwidth which is a critical issue for archival storage at scale. They can currently write hundreds of megabytes a second.</li>
<li>Like <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/09/more-on-facebooks-cold-storage.html">Facebook's archival storage technologies</a>, Project Silica enjoys the synergies of data center scale without needing full data center environmental and power resources.</li>
<li>Like Facebook's technologies, Project Silica has an in-house customer, Azure's archival storage, with a need for a product like this.</li>

The expensive part of the system is the write head. It is an entire rack using femtosecond lasers, which start at around $50K. The eventual system's economics will depend upon the progress made in cost-reducing the lasers.<br />

The Svalbard archipelago is where I spent the summer of 1969 doing a geological survey.<br />
<br />
The most important part of an archiving strategy is knowing how you will get stuff out of the archive. Putting stuff in and keeping it safe are important and relatively easy, but if you can't get stuff out when you need it what's the point?<br />
<br />
In some cases access is only needed to a small proportion of the archive. At Facebook, Patiejunas expected that the major reason for access would be to respond to a subpoena. In other cases, such as migrating to a new archival system, bulk data retrieval is required.<br />
<br />
But if the reason for needing access is disaster recovery it is important to have a vision of what resources are likley to be available after the disaster. Microsoft gained a lot of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-11-13/microsoft-apocalypse-proofs-open-source-code-in-an-arctic-cave">valuable PR</a> by encoding much of the world's open source software in QR codes on film and storing the cans of film in an abandoned coal mine in Svalbard so it would "survive the apocalypse". In <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2019/11/seeds-or-code.html"><i>Seeds Or Code?</i></a> I had a lot of fun imagining how the survivors of the apocalypse would be able to access the archive.<br />

To make a long story short, after even a mild apocalypse, they wouldn't be able to. Let's just point out that the first steps after the apocalypse are getting to Svalbard. They won't be able to fly to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svalbard_Airport">LYR</a>. As the crow flies, the voyage from Tromsø is 591 miles across very stormy seas. It takes several days, and getting to Tromsø won't be easy either.<br />
<h2>Archival Storage Services</h2>
Because technologies have very strong economies of scale, the economics of most forms of IT work in favor of the hyper-scalers. These forces are especially strong for archival data, both because it is almost pure cost with no income, and because as I discussed earlier the economics of archival storage only work at data-center scale. It will be the rare institution that can avoid using cloud archival storage. I analyzed the way these economic forces operate in 2019's <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2019/02/cloud-for-preservation.html"><i>Cloud For Preservation</i></a>:<br />
<div style="background-color: #fff8c6; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 8px; padding-left: 8px; padding-right: 8px; padding-top: 8px; padding: 8px;">
<blockquote>
Much of the attraction of cloud technology for organizations, especially public institutions funded through a government's annual budget process, is that they transfer costs from capital to operational expenditure. It is easy to believe that this increases financial flexibility. As regards ingest and dissemination, this may be true. Ingesting some items can be delayed to the next budget cycle, or the access rate limit lowered temporarily. But as regards preservation, it isn't true. It is unlikely that parts of the institution's collection can be de-accessioned in a budget crunch, only to be re-accessioned later when funds are adequate. Even were the content still available to be re-ingested, the cost of ingest is a significant fraction of the total life-cycle cost of preserving digital content.
</blockquote>
</div>
Cloud services typically charge differently for ingest, storage and retrieval. The service's goal in designing their pricing structure is to create lock-in, by analogy with the drug-dealer's algorithm "the first one's free".
In 2019 I used the published rates to compute the cost of ingesting in a month, storing for a year, and retrieving in a month a petabyte using the archive services of the three main cloud providers. Here is that table, with the costs adjusted for inflation to 2024 using the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm">Bureau of Labor Statistics' calculator</a>:<br />

The "Lock-in" column is the approximate number of months of storage cost that getting the Petabyte out in a month represents. Note that:<br />
<ul>
<li>In all cases getting data out is much more expensive than putting it in.</li>
<li>The lower cost of archival storage compared to the same service's near-line storage is purchased at the expense of a much stronger lock-in.</li>
<li>Since the whole point of archival storage is keeping data for the long term, the service will earn much more in storage charges over the longer life of archival data than the shorter life of near-line data.</li>
</ul>
There may well be reasons why retrieving data from archival storage is expensive. Most storage technologies have unified read/write heads, so retrieval competes with ingest which, as Patiejunas figured out, is the critical performance parameter for archival storage. This is because, to minimize cost, archival systems are designed assuming bulk retrieval is rare. When it happens, whether from a user request or to migrate data to new media, it is disruptive. For example, emptying a base model TS4300 occupies it for more than a week.<br />
<br />
Six years later, things have changed significantly. Here is the current version of the archival services table:<br />
<div align="center" style="background-color: #fff8c6; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 8px; padding-left: 8px; padding-right: 8px; padding-top: 8px; padding: 8px;">

</div>
Points to note:<br />
<ul>
<li>Glacier is the only one of the three that is significantly cheaper in real terms than it was 6 years ago.</li>
<li>Glacier can do this because Kryder's Law has made their storage about a factor of about 6 cheaper in real terms in six years, or about a 35% Kryder rate. This is somewhat faster than the rate of areal density increase of tape, and much faster than that of disk. The guess is that Glacier Deep Archive is on tape.</li>
<li>Google's pricing indicates they aren't serious about the archival market.</li>
<li>Archive services now have differentiated tiers of service. This table uses S3 Deep Archive, Google Archive and Microsoft Archive.</li>
<li>Lock-in has increased from 13.8/12.0/8.1 to 50/175/20. It is also increased by additional charges for data lifetimes less than a threshold, 180/365/180 days. So my cost estimate for Google is too low, because the data would suffer these charges. But accounting for this would skew the comparison.</li>
<li>Bandwidth charges are a big factor in lock-in. For Amazon they are 77%, for Google they are 38%, for Microsoft they are 32%.  Amazon's marketing is smart, hoping you won't notice the outbound bandwidth charges.</li>
</ul>
Looking at these numbers it is hard to see how anyone can justify any archive storage other than S3 Deep Archive. It is the only one delivering Kryder's Law to the customer, and as my <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2017/08/economic-model-of-long-term-storage.html">economic model</a> shows, delivering Kryder's Law is essential to affordable long-term storage. A petabyte for a decade costs under $120K before taking Kryder's Law into account and you can get it all out for under $50K.<br />
<h2>LOCKSS</h2>

</div>
The fundamental idea behind LOCKSS was that, given a limited budget and a realistic range of threats, data would survive better in many cheap, unreliable, loosely-coupled replicas than in a single expensive, durable one.<br />
<br />
<div style="background-color: #fff8c6; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 8px; padding-left: 8px; padding-right: 8px; padding-top: 8px; padding: 8px;">
<blockquote>
Replacing one drive takes about 15 minutes of work. If we have 30,000 drives and 2 percent fail, it takes 150 hours to replace those.  In other words, one employee for one month of 8 hour days. Getting the failure rate down to 1 percent means you save 2 weeks of employee salary - maybe $5,000 total? The 30,000 drives costs you $4m.<br />
<br />
The $5k/$4m means the Hitachis are worth 1/10th of 1 per cent higher cost to us. ACTUALLY we pay even more than that for them, but not more than a few dollars per drive (maybe 2 or 3 percent more).<br />
<br />
Moral of the story: design for failure and buy the cheapest components you can. :-)
</blockquote>
</div>
Brian Wilson, CTO of BackBlaze <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/04/evercloud-workshop.html">pointed out</a> eleven years ago that in their long-term storage environment <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/02/17/backblaze_how_not_to_evaluate_disk_reliability/">"Double the reliability is only worth 1/10th of 1 percent cost increase"</a>. And thus that the moral of the story was "design for failure and buy the cheapest components you can".<br />
<br />
In other words, don't put all your eggs in one basket.<br />

## A Short History of Now

So there must be something to it. Watch how often people interrupt each other by saying the word &#34;So,&#34; and then launching into whatever they think is more essential than what somebody else is saying. And watch for people giving a speech start with &#34;So—&#34; The first speaker I heard do that was Larry Lessig, one [&#8230;]

## Exploring WiFi 7 (at 2 Gbps) on a Raspberry Pi 5

Saw an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6h6QGVfrgQ">interview</a> with Mark Cuban where they asked why would Elon Musk do something that would cause Tesla stock to tank. He's got the power to play with the biggest financial thing that has ever existed, and quite possibly that ever will exist. In comparison Tesla is just one car company, with a lot of competition, a market-leading product for sure, but the competition is catching up. They're constantly lowering prices to keep the volume up, so eventually the stock will have to come down anyway. He certainly knows stuff about the company that no one else can see, maybe their new product pipeline is empty? He also has had to deal with short-sellers who have the incentive to drive the price down, and he can't bet alongside them (how would that look, a CEO betting against his own company). No matter what, there is nothing bigger than the USA, and he's got it, and plans to keep it. But he's human, and thus has frailties, and he loses as often as he wins and knows it. Unfortunately for us we're all in his boat now, unless somehow we can wrench it back.

I heard an idea that really resonated in a Brian Lehrer <a href="https://play.pocketcasts.com/podcasts/0c3b41f0-2c8b-012e-09b1-00163e1b201c/15570ad4-8994-4fe9-83fc-1966fe0e6795">interview</a> with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anand_Giridharadas">Anand Giridharadas</a>, who says among many other things, that we should aim our ire at the <i>leaders</i> of the MAGA movement, and stop bringing our angst to the people who voted for them. Every time I see a condescending TikTok story about them, I think about how that takes us further from getting where we must go. We have to reconcile, we share a country, and our interests are totally aligned. We need each other, that will become completely obvious, and the sooner it does the better.

## "It's the people, stupid!"

date: 2025-03-14, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I keep hearing pundits and incumbent Democrats missing the point, that the people are the ones whose opinion matters about the Republicans dismantling our democracy in the United States. </p>
<p>I want to celebrate those leaders who totally get that the power is with the people, notably Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders. They are an inspiration! I live in New York and while AOC doesn't represent me in Congress (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Ryan_(politician)">Pat Ryan</a> is my rep), in a political and spiritual way she most definitely represents me. She should be the next president, as far as I'm concerned. She has all the leadership abilities we could ever want. </p>
<p>My contribution for today is the slogan that's the title of this piece. It's derived from James Carville's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_the_economy,_stupid">slogan</a> when Bill Clinton was running for president in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_United_States_presidential_election">1992</a>, updated for 2025. </p>
<p>"It's the people, dummy!" was always the right slogan. It's we, the people, who created this country, and we the people are the only ones who can make it work again.</p>

## TP-Link Router Botnet

date: 2025-03-14, updated: 2025-03-14, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>There is a new botnet that is <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/computing/malware-adware/thousands-of-tp-link-routers-have-been-infected-by-a-botnet-to-spread-malware">infecting</a> TP-Link routers:</p>
<blockquote><p>The botnet can lead to command injection which then makes remote code execution (RCE) possible so that the malware can spread itself across the internet automatically. This high severity security flaw (tracked as <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2023-1389">CVE-2023-1389</a>) has also been used to spread other malware families as far back as April 2023 when it was used in the <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/android-adb-matryosh-botnet">Mirai botnet</a> malware attacks. The flaw also linked to the Condi and AndroxGh0st malware attacks.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Of the thousands of infected devices, the majority of them are concentrated in Brazil, Poland, the United Kingdom, Bulgaria and Turkey; with the botnet targeting manufacturing, medical/healthcare, services and technology organizations in the United States, Australia, China and Mexico...</p></blockquote>

## 2025-02-06 Trans rights are human rights

<h2 id="reminder-to-all-feminists">Reminder to all feminists</h2>

<p>If you accept trans people being defined by their reproductive role&hellip;<br>
Then men can define all woman by their reproductive role</p>

<p>If you accept that trans teenagers are too young to make decisions about their bodies&hellip;<br>
Then men can decide teenage girls are too young to make decisions about their bodies</p>

<p>If you accept medical gatekeeping of trans people&rsquo;s access to hormones&hellip;<br>
Then doctors can restrict any woman&rsquo;s access to HRT and birth control</p>

<p>If you accept stripping trans people of legal protections&hellip;<br>
Then men can strip women of legal protections</p>

<p>This is the truth of &ldquo;trans rights are human rights&rdquo;.<br>
Regardless of your personal feelings on whether trans people are &ldquo;really&rdquo; the gender they say they are, the exact same human rights protecting us also underlie women&rsquo;s liberation&ndash; bodily autonomy, dignity, equality of opportunity, and protection from harm.<br>
And so many men are desperate for those rights to disappear.</p>

<p>The Lemkin Institute for Genocide Prevention and Human Security condemns the anti-trans agenda of the second Trump Administration and warns Americans that the recent spate of executive orders, which are in line with a genocidal process against the transgender community that has been emerging in the United States for over a decade, are meant to pave the way for greater state repression against all individuals and other groups in the future. It is important to consistently and loudly reject this administration’s efforts to isolate any people or groups due to their identities, to reaffirm the USA’s commitment to individual rights and diversity, and to push back against efforts to normalize state repression and violence.

## 2025-03-13 Calculators and spreadsheets

date: 2025-03-13, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-03-13-calculators-and-spreadsheets">2025-03-13 Calculators and spreadsheets</h1>

<p>I stumbled upon a discussion about the Gnome Calculator. Apparently it stopped working for some people because a bank blocked it from retrieving the exchange rates it needs to allow users to do currency conversions. I get it. It&rsquo;s a feature, it needs data that&rsquo;s up to date, so you need to fetch it. The default is to do this once a week, I hear.</p>

<p>Based on <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-calculator/-/blob/main/lib/currency-provider.vala">currency-provider.vala</a>, the currency providers are the <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/fin/data/rms_five.aspx">International Monetary Fund</a> (IMF) and the <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/eurofxref/eurofxref-daily.xml">European Central Bank</a>.</p>

<p>So that leads me to another question: What do you use to do calculations you can&rsquo;t do in your head?</p>

<p>I mostly do it in Emacs using <code>M-x calc</code>. It uses the reverse-polish notation (RPN) I am used to from my old calculators before there where smartphones.
For a while I used <code>bc</code> but the precision was weird. Then I tried <code>dc</code> but it was weird, too. Now I have Super+C bound to <code>orpie</code> running in a terminal. Perhaps I should bind that key to run <code>emacsclient</code> and eval <code>(calc)</code>. 😂</p>

<p>From the replies, I found a large number of people reporting that they used the interpreters of their favourite programming languages. I didn&rsquo;t know that this was so wide-spread. People named Python, Ruby, Fennel, Scheme.</p>

<p>Python:</p>

<pre><code>Python 3.11.2 (main, Nov 30 2024, 21:22:50) [GCC 12.2.0] on linux
Type &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1+2+3
6
</code></pre>

<p>Ruby:</p>

<pre><code>irb(main):001:0&gt; 1+2+3
=&gt; 6
</code></pre>

<p>Fennel:</p>

<pre><code>Welcome to fennel!
&gt;&gt; (+ 1 2 3)
6
</code></pre>

<p>Chicken Scheme:</p>

<pre><code>CHICKEN
(c) 2008-2021, The CHICKEN Team
(c) 2000-2007, Felix L. Winkelmann
Version 5.3.0 (rev e31bbee5)
linux-unix-gnu-x86-64 [ 64bit dload ptables ]

Type ,? for help.
#;1&gt; (+ 1 2 3)
6
</code></pre>

<p><a class="account" href="https://nrw.social/@HaraldKi" title="@HaraldKi@nrw.social">@HaraldKi</a> shared that they use a shell, but not just any shell: <code>tclsh</code> with the <a href="https://www.tcl-lang.org/man/tcl8.4/TclCmd/expr.htm">expr</a> built-in command.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tclsh uses just double math, afair, and understands plain and simple everyday expressions you basically learned in primary school. Plus scientific notation like 2.7e22 . Plus a chunk of log, sin, cos, tan if really needed. So no brain tweaks needed. The only thing to keep in mind: add .0 to most numbers to not accidentally get &frac34; -&gt; 0.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The key is have a function in your shell that gets transformed into a Tcl command that is piped to <code>tclsh</code>.
In my case, using <code>fish</code>, use <code>funced calc --save</code> and use the following:</p>

<pre><code>function calc
  echo &quot;puts [expr {$args}]&quot; | tclsh
end
</code></pre>

<p>At the shell prompt:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; calc 1+2+3
6
&gt; calc 4/3
1
&gt; calc 4/3.0
1.3333333333333333
</code></pre>

<p>What about the other options?</p>

<p>I think the key is that they have to startup fast and be ready to type.
<code>bc</code> certainly qualifies.
Just remember to set the scale!
Or use the <code>--mathlib</code> option.</p>

<pre><code>bc 1.07.1
Copyright 1991-1994, 1997, 1998, 2000, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2012-2017 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

For details type `warranty'.
1+2+3
6
4/3
1
scale=3
4/3
1.333
</code></pre>

<p><code>dc</code> has reverse-polish notation (RPN) but is very terse.
Tokens are separated by spaces or newlines.
Thus, the Enter key doesn&rsquo;t print a result. You need to use the <code>p</code> command.
Again, the default is integer math.
Use the <code>k</code> command to switch scale.</p>

<pre><code>1 2 3 + + p
6
4 3 / p
1
3 k 4 3 / p
1.333
</code></pre>

<p>A weird part is that you need to enter negative numbers using the underscore (<code>_3</code> for -3).</p>

<p>By contrast, my favourite calculator in the terminal right now is <code>orpie</code>.
You get reverse-polish notation and immediate feedback.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Emacs comes with <code>M-x quick-calc</code> which simply asks for an expression and prints the result:</p>

<pre><code>Result: 1 + 2 + 3 =&gt;  6  (16#6, 8#6, 2#110, &quot;^F&quot;)
</code></pre>

<p>Then there&rsquo;s <code>M-x calculator</code> which comes with its own mode. You can use <code>o h</code> to switch output to hex, for example. So adding up 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 results in 10, or A in hex.</p>

<pre><code>Calc==H&gt; A
</code></pre>

<p>And finally there is <code>M-x calc</code>.
Check out the <a href="https://github.com/ahyatt/emacs-calc-tutorials/blob/master/README.org">short tutorials</a> by Andrew Hyatt, if you&rsquo;re interested in learning more.
As I said above, this is my default solution. <code>1 RET 2 RET 3 RET + +</code> and there we go. Plus a trail over on the right in case you&rsquo;re confused.</p>

<pre><code>---------------------- Emacs Calculator Mode ---------------------- |----- Emacs Calculator Trail -----

<p>Copying the result runs into a tiny problem, for me: The stack depth is copied along with it! So if you copy the above result (6), what you actually get is <code>1: 6</code>. Which is never what I want to paste elsewhere. Never.</p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://sfba.social/@kickingvegas" title="@kickingvegas@sfba.social">@kickingvegas</a> suggested <a href="https://github.com/kickingvegas/casual?tab=readme-ov-file#calc-elisp-library-casual-calc">casual-calc</a>, which is part of &ldquo;a project to re-imagine the primary user interface for Emacs using keyboard-driven menus&rdquo;.</p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://helvede.net/@m" title="@m@helvede.net">@m</a> suggested <a href="https://qalculate.github.io/">qcalc</a> which also offers “currency conversion”:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The exchange rates can be updated manually using File → Update Exchange Rates, or automatically at specific intervals (by default once every week, but this can be changed in the preferences dialog), when needed (when currencies are converted).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apparently it gets the exchange rates from the European Central Bank and Coinbase App APIs.</p>

<p>Another option is spreadsheets, of course.
<a class="account" href="https://merveilles.town/@neauoire" title="@neauoire@merveilles.town">@neauoire</a> mentioned <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/nebu">nebu</a>.
I don&rsquo;t have a Varvara system up and running, however.</p>

<p>There is <code>sc</code>, of course.
If you don&rsquo;t want to hit <code>=</code> for every number you enter, use <code>-n</code> for &ldquo;quick numeric entry&rdquo;.
I&rsquo;m not sure how I can quickly select the range for something like <code>@sum(A0:A2)</code> but it certainly seems possible to use <code>sc</code> for interesting stuff.</p>

<p>The web was initially <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1866.txt">designed</a> for writers. Styling, links, paragraphs, titles (at all levels). The ability to edit. No character limits. That's what we had to work with when we started blogging in the mid-late 90s.  </p>
<p>Then there was a big <a href="http://scripting.com/2016/09/22/tenYearsUsingTwitter.html">corner-turn</a> in 2006. In an instant the web shrunk to almost nothing. No titles, no style, no links, 140 chars max. Enough to say "I'm waiting in line at the bank." Nothing wrong with that, but it isn't what I think of as writing. </p>
<p>A couple of years ago, I decided to focus on writers once again. I started developing ideas of what <b>the writer's web</b> would look like if we used today's technology. And here are the three main directions.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>New technology</b>. Since the last time we looked, Markdown was invented. RSS feeds had become instant. Websockets replaced long polling. Servers got cheap! And SQL is fast and the tools are much better. We'll use all the best new technology.  </li>
<li><b>Modern interfaces</b>. We'll borrow the best ideas from twitter-like systems. Writing a new post should be as easy as writing a tweet, but with all the features writers need at-hand, easy to access. </li>
<li><b>Open, for real</b>. And best of all, it'll be open, for real, now -- not some day. Each component will be completely replaceable with simple APIs, and lots of example code. </li>
</ul>
<p>I'm going to use WordPress as my basic back-end technology because it is reliable and broadly deployed, but you don't have to. The great thing about the web is that it's already federated. Nothing to wait for. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span> </p>
<p>We know how to do this. The only question is whether we <i>choose</i> to.</p>
<p>Best way to get started -- write a blog post about what the writer's web means to you. Send me a link. I'll read it. </p>

## ★ Something Is Rotten in the State of Cupertino

date: 2025-03-12, updated: 2025-03-14, from: Daring Fireball

Who decided these personalized Siri features should go in the WWDC keynote, with a promise they’d arrive in the coming year, when, at the time, they were in such an unfinished state they could not be demoed to the media even in a controlled environment? Three months later, who decided Apple should double down and advertise these features in a TV commercial, and promote them as a selling point of the iPhone 16 lineup?

He's an expert on Russian history, biographer of Stalin, he talks about what Trump is doing, and as I listened I realized we have not filled in how crazy or challenged the leaders of the other huge powers are. Trump apparently is not an outlier. Putin can't keep the war going in Europe indefinitely, their banking system is running on fumes and the people are tired of war (unlike in the US they feel their wars). There's tremendous corruption in the Chinese military, so Xi isn't rushing to try to take over Taiwan. It's easier and safer to just keep threatening. In the US we're shocked by what we've become, so quickly, we're failing to see the context. Kotkin also offers a perspective on the new media, relative to when TV and radio were new, and all the chaos the US has survived. He said something I believe is true, it'll be hard to turn America into a totalitarian state because every freaking American today was raised in a country where we had all the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_amendments_to_the_Constitution_of_the_United_States">amendments</a>. It'll be hard to get us to STFU. They have a plan in TrumpLand, but that doesn't mean it will work.

## Fun with the Sharp Zaurus SL-5500 (and an unexpected OpenBSD link)

date: 2025-03-12, from: Liam on Linux

The <a href="https://medium.com/@alabbe/sharp-zaurus-sl-5500-collie-8254d03964d6">Zaurus SL-5500</a>&nbsp;was an early, tiny, Linux pocket computer-cum-PDA. I had one. Two, in fact.&nbsp;They got stolen from my house. :-(<br /><p>It had a CF card slot, so you could even remove your storage card and insert a CF Wifi card instead, and have mobile Internet in your pocket, 20 years ago!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />But if you did, you got a free extra with a wifi adaptor &ndash; a battery life of about 15-20 minutes.</p> <p>It was clever, but totally useless. With the wifi card in, you  couldn&rsquo;t have external storage any more, so there was very little room  left.</p> <p>I had to check: <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/first-looks/30821/sharp-zaurus-sl-5500" rel="ugc">https://uk.pcmag.com/first-looks/30821/sharp-zaurus-sl-5500</a></p> <p>64MB RAM, 16MB flash, and a 320x240 screen. Or rather 240x320 as it was portrait.</p> <p>The sheer amount of thought and planning that went into the  Linux-based Zaurus was shown by the fact that the tiny physical keyboard  <em>had no pipe symbol.</em> Bit of a snag on an xNix machine, that.</p><p>Both mine were 2nd hand, given to me by techie mates who&rsquo;d played  with them and got bored and moved on. <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/okqjn5/20_years_linux_on_desktop_part_3">I'm told others got better battery</a> life on Wifi. Maybe their tiny batteries were  already on the way out or something.</p> <p><strong>Fun side-note #1:</strong> I do not remember the battery pack looking like this one, though. I feel sure I would have noticed.</p> <p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Battery-Zaurus-SL-5500-900mAh-Li-ion/dp/B007K0DRIU" rel="ugc">https://www.amazon.co.uk/Battery-Zaurus-SL-5500-900mAh-Li-ion/dp/B007K0DRIU</a></p> <p><strong>Fun side-note #2:</strong> both came with Sharp&rsquo;s original  OS, version 1.0. I had an interesting time experimenting with  alternative OS builds, new ROMs etc. Things did get a lot better, or at  least less bad, after the first release. But the friend who gave me my  first unit swore up and down that he&rsquo;d update the ROM. I can&rsquo;t see any  possible mechanism for flash memory to just revert to earlier contents  on its own, though.</p> <p>With replacement OS images you had to decide how to partition the  device&rsquo;s tiny amount of storage: some as read-only for the OS, some as  read-write, some as swap, etc. The allocations were fixed and if you got  it wrong you had to nuke and reload.</p> <p>This would have been <em>much</em> easier if the device had some form of logical volume management, and dynamically-changeable volume sizes.</p> <p>Which is a thought I also had repeatedly around 2023-2024 when  experimenting with OpenBSD. It uses an exceptionally complex  partitioning layout, and if you forcibly simplify it, you (1) run up  against the limitations of its horribly primitive partitioning tool and  (2) reduce the OS&rsquo;s security.</p> <p>I have got just barely competent enough with OpenBSD that between <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/04/22/openbsd_71_released_including_apple/" rel="ugc">writing this</a> in early 2022 and <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/10/version_76_openbsd_of_theseus/" rel="ugc">writing this</a>  in late 2024, two and a half years later, I went from &ldquo;struggling  mightily just to get it running at all in a VM&rdquo; to &ldquo;able with only some  whimpering and cursing to get it dual-booting on bare metal with XP64,  NetBSD, and 2 Linux distros.&rdquo;</p> <p>But it&rsquo;s still a horrible <em>horrible</em> experience and some form of LVM would make matters massively easier.</p> <p>Which is odd because I avoid Linux LVM as much as possible. I find it  a massive pain when you don&rsquo;t need it. However, you need it for Linux  full-disk encryption, and one previous employer&nbsp;of mine insisted upon  that.</p> <p>In other words: I really dislike LVM, and I am annoyed by Linux  gratuitously insisting on it in situations where it should not strictly  speaking be needed &ndash; but in other OSes and other situations, I have  really wanted it, but it wasn&rsquo;t available.</p><br type="_moz" /><br /><br /><img src="https://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=liam_on_linux&ditemid=94248" width="30" height="12" alt="comment count unavailable" style="vertical-align: middle;"/> comments

<blockquote><p>Historically, China, Russia, Iran &#038; North Korea have cooperated to some extent on military and intelligence matters, but differences in language, culture, politics &#038; technological sophistication have hindered deeper collaboration, including in cyber. Shifting geopolitical dynamics, however, could drive these states toward a more formalized intell-sharing partnership. Such a &#8220;Four Eyes&#8221; alliance would be motivated by common adversaries and strategic interests, including an enhanced capacity to resist economic sanctions and support proxy conflicts...</p></blockquote>

## Silk Typhoon Hackers Indicted

<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>According to prosecutors, the group as a whole has targeted US state and federal agencies, foreign ministries of countries across Asia, Chinese dissidents, US-based media outlets that have criticized the Chinese government, and most recently the US Treasury, which was breached between September and December of last year.

It is the new Apple computers review day — as you can see from the top of Techmeme, which is dominated by the reviews of Apple’s new Mac Studio and MacBook Air models. While Mac Studio is garnering significant attention, the M4 MacBook Air is likely more relevant to everyday users. The new Air offers &#8230;

## A Conversation with ChatGPT About Personal AI

date: 2025-03-11, from: Doc Searls (at Harvard), New Old Blog

What follows is a conversation I&#8217;m having with ChatGPT about personal AI. I guarantee it&#8217;s unlike any conversation about AI you&#8217;ll find anywhere else. It&#8217;s copied and pasted, and full of weird HTML that later I&#8217;ll run through a text editor or something to fix. Meanwhile the &#8220;You said&#8221; and &#8220;ChatGPT said&#8221;  don&#8217;t show in [&#8230;]

## Bluesky is not billionaire-proof

date: 2025-03-11, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>First I want to say that <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=bluesky">Bluesky</a> is nice software, good design, attractive, they have a goal and stick to it, and it stays up, no <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/01/the-story-behind-twitters-fail-whale/384313/?gift=f35zZN0v_gDFE8xNwlQAHSNkdwehtNpsP-bh1d4EoU4&utm_source=copy-link&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=share">fail whales</a> that were so vexing of early days Twitter. </p>
<p>That said, I have two criticisms:</p>
<ul>
<li>They are implementing the same limits that Twitter designed into their product, no styling, no links, you can't edit, no titles, enclosures, and a limit of 300 chars per post. Simple stuff that, if they broke through the Twitter design, would make it a decent platform for writers. I don't see any reason to duplicate the mistakes that Twitter made, in 2006, in the design of their product.</li>
<li>They repeatedly claim to be <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/21/bluesky-ceo-jay-graber-says-x-rival-is-billionaire-proof.html">billionaire-proof</a> but as far as I can tell, and I have built software on their APIs, they are not. Yet they tell users they are safe, and what choice do the users have but to believe them, esp when tech journalism repeats the claims without challenging them. As a result, people believe that if Bluesky were to be acquired by a billionaire, something they might not even be able to stop, they will be able to quickly migrate to something that's the same as Bluesky and keep all their connections, people they follow and people following them. </li>
</ul>
<p>All of this would be nice, if it were true but imho it is not true. I'm going to go through the recent statement from their CEO in the remainder of this piece. I invite them to rebut it, esp <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/user/mmasnick/">Mike Masnick</a> of Techdirt, who has journalistic integrity, is widely respected, and is on the Bluesky board of directors. Honestly I can't understand why Masnick puts his integrity on the line here, I've tried to discuss it with him, and I guess he doesn't take me seriously enough to give a serious response. I would also like to know what his deal is with them, does he profit personally if Bluesky is acquired. That needs to be disclosed, imho. I would do it if I were in his shoes. </p>
<p>If you read my blog, I hope you know that I wouldn't challenge something like this unless I was pretty sure there is an issue. I don't imagine for a second that people would abandon Bluesky if they knew they were locked in and would have no path out if it was bought by a billionaire. I know we can't get out and I still use Bluesky, because that's where the people I want to network with are. They won. So they don't have to deceive. They can stop making this claim. Yet they continue to do it, in pretty much exactly the same terms as they have been doing it all along. </p>
<p>Here's the statement that appeared in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/10/at-sxsw-bluesky-ceo-jay-graber-pokes-fun-at-mark-zuckerberg-with-latin-phrase-t-shirt/">TechCrunch</a> yesterday.</p>
<ul>
<li>“If a billionaire came in and bought Bluesky, or took it over, or if I decided tomorrow to change things in a way that people really didn’t like, then they could fork off and go on to another application,” Graber explained at SXSW. “There’s already applications in the network that give you another way to view the network, or you could build a new one as well. And so that openness guarantees that there’s always the ability to move to a new alternative.”</li>
<li>The quote is from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Graber">Jay Graber</a>, the CEO of the company.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's go through it, point by point</p>
<ul>
<li>"they could fork it off and go on to another application" -- in this sentence "they" applies to developers, because you have to be a developer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)">fork</a> an application. Assuming Bluesky is available in source code, with an appropriate open source license, and they have released enough code so that a developer could quickly launch an exact Bluesky clone, maybe this part is true. I can't evaluate it without going through the exercise of forking their code, but I do know this -- no one has. Why not? I would think that with <a href="https://backlinko.com/bluesky-statistics">27 million users</a>, by now someone would have tried it. Maybe this post will uncover such an instance, or motivate one. I would be happy to try it out to see how it works. But it has to be completely independent of Bluesky. It would have to work, without loss of functionality, if Bluesky's network disappeared.</li>
<li>"there’s already applications in the network that give you another way to view the network" -- this is true. But they don't do very much nor do they have many users. They are basically experiments that show that you could build something else with the format they have defined. This isn't unusual. You can make a lot of different kinds of websites with HTML, for example, but very few of them have millions of users. Same thing with apps built on the Bluesky protocol that use data types that Bluesky itself doesn't understand. I don't think this adds anything to the claim of billionaire-safety. Also if these apps are in the same network, that doesn't give us any independence from Bluesky. So I think this is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOP_(code)">no-op</a>, it adds nothing but confusion to the claim.</li>
<li>"[our] openness guarantees that there’s always the ability to move to a new alternative" -- this is not true, and it's the crux of the concern. There is no such guarantee. If there were, we would be able to move to an alternative now. Where is it? It's not there and imho it can't be there. </li>
</ul>
<p>There are other problems. Mastodon, via its API, actually does what Bluesky claims to do. There are lots of <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-server-instance">instances</a> of Mastodon servers and they interop with each other. It's an incredible proof of concept. But its federation ability adds enough complexity that most people prefer Bluesky, which doesn't have those complications. There are always tradeoffs in technology. You can have flexibility but it comes at a price. Bluesky would have you believe you can have the flexibility of Mastodon without paying the price. </p>
<p>There may be a way to do what they promise, but it would mean removing features, which isn't a bad idea, but they have decided they have to do everything Twitter does and there is the conundrum. Twitter was designed around centralization, and because of that Twitter is <i>not</i> billionaire-proof as has been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk#Business_career">demonstrated</a>, and neither is Bluesky.</p>
<p>Every time I read this quote from their CEO it gets my bile up, and I say things <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com">on Bluesky</a> that I regret later. Instead I decided to take the time this morning to carefully explain the problem and now when they make the claim, I can point to this piece. And maybe I'm wrong, and they can show me an instance I can switch to and not lose access to my network of friends on Bluesky and not depend on the existence of Bluesky itself. That would actually make me happy (I think) and give me a completely new understanding of computer science. </p>

## 2025-03-09 The looming Discord IPO

date: 2025-03-11, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-03-09-the-looming-discord-ipo">2025-03-09 The looming Discord IPO</h1>

<p>So&hellip; Discord might be going there. I like their offering. I even pay them about $10/month.
What they offer works well.
People get their own little communities to administer, with the tools to administer them well, with the self-written automations and bots to handle communities from a handful of people to many thousands.
Read <a class="account" href="https://infosec.exchange/@isotopp" title="@isotopp@infosec.exchange">@isotopp</a>’s <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@isotopp/114116202418228034">perspective on Discord</a>.</p>

<p>But the monetization drive is strong.
And once the shareholders are in place, pressure for monetization will ramp up even more, I&rsquo;m sure. How long until it all goes down? Five years?</p>

<p>What are your backup plans?</p>

<p><a href="https://campaignwiki.org/wiki/Chat">My backup plan</a> is an IRC backend (<a href="https://ngircd.barton.de/">ngircd</a> uses about 5M of memory) and two instances of a web front-end called <a href="https://thelounge.chat/">The Lounge</a>. One of them is free for all and connects to my chat server; the other needs registration and offers file uploads and always-on connectivity (it acts as a &ldquo;bouncer&rdquo;). The two of them take about 150M of memory. Each registered account gets a little SQLite file with the logs. No other resources required.</p>

<p>You can connect to the IRC backend directly using your favourite IRC client, of course. Emacs comes with two of them. Just saying. 😄</p>

<p>For iOS, there&rsquo;s <a href="https://colloquy.app/">Colloquy</a>.</p>

<p>For Android, <a class="account" href="https://tabletop.social/@wandererbill" title="@wandererbill@tabletop.social">@wandererbill</a> suggests <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/io.mrarm.irc/">Revolution IRC</a>.</p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://tabletop.social/@phf" title="@phf@tabletop.social">@phf</a> suggested <a href="https://snikket.org/service/quickstart/">Snikket</a> instead. Installation requires a Docker image.</p>

<p>I dislike Docker, not because of what it is but because of what it implies. A virtual machine inside your virtual machine means that it doesn&rsquo;t auto-update. Upgrading will be tricky. It also means individual deployment requires multiple services such that it ended up being easier for them to supply a Docker image instead of supplying good instructions. I always take that to mean that the setup is brittle and underdocumented. Perhaps I’m wrong but it that’s the suspicion I have.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, I dislike Docker images for my virtual server server (6G memory, 75g storage, 2 cores) because multiple services packaged in a dockerfile usually mean lots of resources required. Frugal computing means that I am loath to accommodate that. I prefer not to upgrade my virtual machine.</p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://tabletop.social/@phf" title="@phf@tabletop.social">@phf</a> also suggested <a href="https://app.revolt.chat/">Revolt</a>.
<a class="account" href="https://tabletop.social/@wandererbill" title="@wandererbill@tabletop.social">@wandererbill</a> created a <a href="https://rvlt.gg/wkBDhJPb">Grenzland Server on Revolt</a>.
<a class="account" href="https://social.city-of-glass.net/users/cidney" title="@cidney@social.city-of-glass.net">@cidney</a> noted that it had Discord-like roles and role management for the server owner to hand out, so perhaps it&rsquo;s quite a suitable replacement.
Revolt can be self-hosted via Docker or self-building. At least there is a lot of info out there.
<a class="account" href="https://social.city-of-glass.net/users/cidney" title="@cidney@social.city-of-glass.net">@cidney</a> also found a wiki pages listing only four known instances including the default one, the largest being Andrew Tate&rsquo;s. 🤮</p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://tabletop.social/@wandererbill" title="@wandererbill@tabletop.social">@wandererbill</a> wanted to give Matrix another spin.
There are two server implementations, Synapse and Dendrite.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At an absolute minimum, Dendrite will expect 1GB RAM. For a comfortable day-to-day deployment which can participate in federated rooms for a number of local users, be prepared to assign 2-4 CPU cores and 8GB RAM — more if your user count increases. &ndash; <a href="https://element-hq.github.io/dendrite/installation/planning">Planning your installation</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p><a class="account" href="https://tabletop.social/users/kyonshi" title="@kyonshi@tabletop.social">@kyonshi</a> suggested <a href="https://jitsi.org/">Jitsi</a>.
I tried to self-host it a few years ago.
It worked well! But it also took a lot of resource. During the video call, the virtual machine&rsquo;s <a href="2020-03-26_Jitsi_and_the_CPU">load went up to 8</a>.
We sometimes use the installation at the <a href="https://ffmuc.net/">Freifunk München</a> for gaming.
Thanks, ffmuc! 😍</p>

<p>So, where does that leave is? I don&rsquo;t know. People don&rsquo;t seem to like The Lounge with IRC backend and I seem to be unwilling to upgrade my hosting commitments.</p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://hackers.town/@mc" title="@mc@hackers.town">@mc</a> recently recommended a different IRC server called <a href="https://ergo.chat/about">Ergo</a> and a different web front-end called <a href="https://codeberg.org/emersion/gamja">Gamja</a> but it&rsquo;s unclear to me what significant advantages either would offer.</p>

<p>Previously:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So… the situation is bad, but I still use Discord. &ndash; <a href="2022-08-16_Discord">Discord</a> (2022)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a class="account" href="https://tilde.zone/@dashdsrdash" title="@dashdsrdash@tilde.zone">@dashdsrdash</a> wrote wrote in with some interesting feedback. The Zulip part is interesting because I only used it for tiny bit, talking to the maintainers of Antora. Here&rsquo;s what they have to say:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Zulip is great for UI, slightly aggravating to run. It absolutely wants a dedicated server. It has a dice roller as one of the sample bots, and the API is extensive.</li>
<li>IRC is extremely easy to setup and relatively easy to write bots for. Interfaces vary from bare bones to not-bad; The Lounge is up on the not-bad end, and also easy to host.</li>
<li>Matrix may be the future of federated chat systems, but if you don&rsquo;t need federation, the complexity and ongoing maintenance are not worth it.</li>
<li>Jitsi has integrated chat but is video-conferencing-centric; the text chat is actually Prosody (an XMPP/Jabber) server under the hood. Video processing takes up a lot of CPU and bouncing it around takes a lot of bandwidth; otherwise, it&rsquo;s pretty nice.</li>
<li>I haven&rsquo;t tried running Revolt but I looked at the docs and I am really not favorably inclined. They have some questionable technology choices and insist on a Docker-first install that in my experience is a likely sign that there are too many moving parts for anyone to be able to diagnose what&rsquo;s going wrong.</li>
</ul>

<p>My suggestions would be:</p>

<ul>
<li>IRC is still a solid choice</li>
<li>Prosody without the Jitsi video conferencing is pretty nice, albeit a little complex to configure initially.</li>
<li>If I felt like spending the money for a medium-large VM at a hosting service dedicated to gaming, Zulip would be nice.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t know about the hosting of Zulip but the rest tracks my experience. IRC is the simplest option.</p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://social.vivaldi.net/@randomwizard" title="@randomwizard@vivaldi.net">@randomwizard</a> is giving <a href="https://galene.org/">Galène</a> a try. Videoconferencing that might not be as hard to setup correctly as self-hosted Jitsi!</p>

## 2025-03-11 Distrusting US arms dealers

date: 2025-03-11, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-03-11-distrusting-us-arms-dealers">2025-03-11 Distrusting US arms dealers</h1>

<p>Ah, this is where the quotes come from:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He’s done everything to discredit and demean Zelensky on the international stage with the shameful press conference in which he teamed up with the vice president to attack Zelensky,” said Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.). He pressed Whitaker, and other State Department nominees in the hearing, over whether Trump is a Russian asset. “What else could a Russian asset actually possibly do that Trump hasn’t yet done? – <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5175978-matthew-whitaker-nato-trump/">Trump’s NATO nominee commits to alliance, despite MAGA opponents</a>, by Laura Kelly, for The Hill</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the same piece:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Moreover — people should not assume that Trump’s policies are destructive for NATO. If anything, pushing European allies to increase defense spending is going to strengthen NATO.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, I&rsquo;m assuming that a NATO full of bootlickers would be great for Trump as he and Putin divvy up Europe.</p>

<p>I bet every European country that bough US equipment is super angry right now.</p>

<p>I am super angry because Switzerland, after a long fight against the new fighter planes, after considering Swedish and French fighter planes, decided to go with the planes that are the most expensive, the most unreliable (based on my uninformed opinions), and the most untrustworthy: the F-35.</p>

<p>From a country that bullies its allies and betrays its friends, that switches off the satellite phones, the intelligence sharing, and whatever else it damn pleases in order to force a settlement. Which is within their rights, of course. But also disqualifies them as a friend for a generation, if you ask me.</p>

<p>A country with the most powerful military in the world and the wisdom of a tooth that needs to be pulled. 🤮</p>

<p>And we&rsquo;re not even part of NATO.</p>

<p>⁂</p>

<p>For more about the F-35, <a class="account" href="https://agora.echelon.pl/users/kravietz" title="@kravietz@agora.echelon.pl">@kravietz</a> recently linked to this article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>With over 400 F-35s projected for Europe by 2030, per Lockheed Martin, the jet remains a cornerstone of NATO’s air power—but its integration highlights a paradox: its technological edge comes at the cost of strategic vulnerability. The U.S. policy restricting independent test operations outside CONUS, combined with reliance on U.S.-managed MDFs, ALIS, ODIN, and software updates, amplifies fears of over-dependence. &ndash; <a href="https://theaviationist.com/2025/03/10/f-35-kill-switch-myth/">The F-35 ‘Kill Switch’: Separating Myth from Reality</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p><a class="account" href="https://agora.echelon.pl/users/kravietz" title="@kravietz@agora.echelon.pl">@kravietz</a> adds:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>… but the problem is not technical. The problem is that in 2025 US has rather clearly signalled that its subjectively defined “interests” will now have priority of international agreements.</p>

<p>That is, the same agreements towards which the US has over the 30 years consistently pushed all European countries, and especially the new EU and NATO joiners. And it made sense as long as the US was the guarantor of these treaties.</p>

<p>What we have now? Let’s say Russia conducts a limited military incursion into eastern Poland with the objective of controlling the Suwalki Corridor. This of course is in violation of UN Charter, NATO Charter and a hundred of bilateral treaties between Russia and EU and Poland. So what? The 2025 US president now decides a “prolonged defense” is “not in US interests” and does everything to force “peace” on Poland.</p>

<p>“Everything” includes impairing US-delivered weapons systems and generally creating a powerful impression of stab in the back.</p>

<p>A “peace”, in which Poland’s concession is the town of Suwałki, and Russia’s “concession” is the nearby town of Olsztyn, which Russia mercifully agrees not to occupy or destroy. Well, it also happens to be a Polish town but Russia in the meantime declared it “historically Russian region” and it now presents it as a concession.</p>

<p>And the 2025 US president says it’s OK, because “peace” and “both sides did concessions”.</p>

## 2025-03-11 Chainsaw politicians

date: 2025-03-11, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-03-11-chainsaw-politicians">2025-03-11 Chainsaw politicians</h1>

<p>Recovery from DOGE is hard.</p>

<p>To put recovery from DOGE into perspective: In tiny Switzerland we elected prime right-winger Blocher into government and he ran the justice department for a handful years. And he fired a lot of people for efficiency. And the institutions are still struggling twenty years later. People fired find new jobs, new careers, early retirements. People staying work hard, burn out, are angry, work on projects and switch tracks before the projects run into walls. The institutional memory keeps shrinking as the new recruits are younger and younger. Suddenly the seniors have been here for just four years. It’s a disgrace. A festering wound. All the jobs are overwhelming and people are drained when they take these positions and they leave again or burn out or struggle or backstab.</p>

<p>And of course everybody who was against the cuts isn’t automatically in favour of increasing the budgets and raising taxes when the chainsaw politicians are gone. But the jobs still needs to get done and so quality goes down and waiting times increase and you can all join the slow march of institutional death and hope for that rekindling of the founding spirit, when having working institutions are a goal again, when the empathy-deprived scrooges are long gone.</p>

## Finding safety in irony, apathy, and animosity

date: 2025-03-11, from: Tracy Durnell Blog

The Disbeliever&#8217;s Guide to Authenticity by Toby Shorin [I]rony is a natural stance to take when constantly making judgments between “real” and “fake,” authentic and inauthentic. It’s a coping mechanism for preserving one’s commitment to authenticity in the midst of a commodified and commoditized society. Irony is a way of shirking responsibility. It reifies the [&#8230;]

## Smart Home is an illusion

So maybe it’s time we finally changed the way we talk about the Internet of Things (IoT). We keep talking about it as something achievable. Perhaps it’s time we started talking about what it really is: one of the biggest consumer scams ever invented. For a generation, we’ve been sold a vision of seamless automation, &#8230;

BTW it's worth <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/02/24/153052.html">calling attention</a> to a bit I linked to yesterday. <i>Cross-posting to Bluesky and Mastodon is not on the roadmap for WordLand.</i> They are too limited in the features they support for writers. This is a big point, not a casual thing. I am trying to create a network that's like stereo to mono. We're not going to try to scale down writing in WordLand so it fits into the tight little featureless well-silo'd boxes in order to peer with those systems. Instead, I want to force them to give writers a decent surface to write on. Somehow we lost our minds and decided deliberately to limit communication to grunts and snorts, and it should not be a surprise that when our civilization migrated to them, it became unable to understand complex ideas. I guarantee you Carl Sagan, if he were alive, would have seen this. Or maybe not? I don't know. But it's a bizarre situation that I've decided to try to fix.

The word is starting to spread about <a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a>. And the product is holding up pretty well. There are some issues in Safari with the toolbar that pops up over selection. I see people pasting in URLs that makes me think it's not working for them. Don Park started using it. I did my first project with Don in the late 80s. The project was very successful. His respect means a lot to me. The positioning -- it makes WordPress as easy to write for as Twitter, is great to hear as users write about it. That was one of the major design goals. What people are missing, and it's right in front of their eyes, they can use writing features that somehow never made it to the twitter-like systems, the ones listed on the <a href="https://textcasting.org/">textcasting memorandum</a> (or manifesto, whichever you prefer). I'm glad people are seeing this as an enhancement to WordPress, not an attempt to create a new community. I want <i>all</i> WordPress writers to use this product. Every one of them. I want people to feel that it's an essential part of WordPress, for writers. The writer's web. Remember that, you'll be hearing a lot about that. And I want to be sure we fix all the bugs, and add all the features they believe are missing, as long as the features pertain to writing. Everything else is well-covered by the main product. There's also an API that comes with WordLand, I'll be talking more about that later. Makes it easier to write WordPress apps in JavaScript that run in the browser.

Lately, political writers have called attention to the tendency of billionaire Elon Musk to refer to his political opponents as &#8220;NPCs.&#8221; This term comes from the gaming world and refers to a nonplayer character, a character that follows a scripted path and cannot think or act on its own, and is there only to populate the world of the game for the actual players.

## Tag, you're it

date: 2025-03-09, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>I’m a bit behind in my RSS feeds and I didn’t realize <a href="https://www.susanjeanrobertson.com/writing/tag-youre-it/">Susan tagged me</a> to answer a series of questions about my blog. I’ve read dozens of these and to be honest was feeling a little left out, so thanks Susan for including me! (Susan’s one of my favorite bloggers and crafters, be sure to like and subscribe.)</p>
<h2>Why did you start blogging in the first place?</h2>
<p>I published a zine in high school with my best friend Mike. Our zine Wimpkiller was a creative outlet for all the composition notebooks we filled up over a bottomless cups of coffee at IHOP. We’d print out stories on Mike’s computer, chop ‘em up, glue ‘em together, and then scam copies after midnight with the help of the friendly late-shift worker at Kinko’s. I enjoyed that thrill of self-publishing then as much as I do now. It felt like the garage band of writing. You may not be good or ever get famous, but you can brute force some art into the world.</p>
<p>In college blogs became a trend. I created a blog as I graduated from college to chronicle my entry into the corporate world and ended up chronicling my move and life in Japan. It served as a form of catharsis and outward processing as well as keeping my friends and family up to date on my adventures. That blog died after I came back from Japan and had to get a job and start a career.</p>
<p>Meeting Jeffery Zeldman at SXSW was the inspiration for this edition of the blog, if you can believe it. A brief encounter but my key takeaway on how I could become more like my web development heroes was to write more. They write, and writing begets books, and books begets conference talks. It seemed like a template I could follow and I started self-publishing again. Over time, I wrote enough to where I got to write on <a href="https://alistapart.com/">Jeffrey’s blog</a> and speak at his conference a handful of times. I guess the plan worked out.</p>
<h2>What platform are you using to manage your blog and why did you choose it?</h2>
<p>I started on WordPress but <a href="https://daverupert.com/2012/11/brander-newer/">I moved my blog to Jekyll in 2012</a>. I chose Jekyll because I was into Ruby at the time and fighting with WordPress for good performance was exhausting me. I wanted a simpler authoring and development experience. The simplicity of building with markdown files on <code>localhost</code> still resonates with me.</p>
<h2>Have you blogged on other platforms before?</h2>
<p>I’ve used Blogger, MovableType, WordPress, and Jekyll. There’s also an ill-fated Eleventy branch on my site that never made it to production. I’m sure Jekyll will implode and I’ll need to find something else, but switching platforms would be a distraction for me at this point without some obvious benefit or process improvement.</p>
<h2>How do you write your posts? For example, in a local editing tool, or in a panel/dashboard that’s part of your blog?</h2>
<p><a href="https://daverupert.com/2021/09/my-notion-blogging-kanban/">I write my posts in a giant Notion kanban</a>. It’s overkill but it’s my overkill. The organization capabilities and “markdown-like” aspects of Notion made it a good fit over a folder-o’-files. Before publishing, my posts go through a series of <a href="https://daverupert.com/2021/10/pre-publish-blogging-rituals/">pre-publishing rituals</a>. With those processes combined I maintain a level of quality and throughput that I’m happy with.</p>
<h2>When do you feel most inspired to write?</h2>
<p>I find time to write after the kids go to bed. If there’s time during the workday, I may spend a lunch break jotting some thoughts too. My blogging is very work-dependent to the extent that sometimes <a href="https://daverupert.com/2020/09/boredom-begets-boredom/">when I’m productive at work, I’m most productive at blogging</a>. But often, I’m too tired or focusing on other tasks to craft a well-reasoned blog post.</p>
<h2>Do you publish immediately after writing, or do you let it simmer a bit as a draft?</h2>
<p>Most of my drafts simmer for weeks if not months or years. From time to time I’ll do a one day turnaround on a post and that’s rewarding, but it’s inconsistent. At the time of writing I have 22 active drafts where ”active” means I’ve updated them at least once in the last six months. If I increase the scope to one year, there’s 41 drafts in my kanban.</p>
<h2>What are you generally interested in writing about?</h2>
<p>I’m a generalist at heart and enjoy writing about technology generally. If you look at my archive it’s pretty rare that two consecutive posts will be thematically similar. I write about specific technologies like CSS but also about game development or the capital-W Web. And of course prototypes, which I’m convinced are the not-so-secret sauce for building great technologies.</p>
<p>One direction I’m slipping towards in my mind is futurism and speculative fiction (e.g. <a href="https://daverupert.com/stories/">sci-fi</a>). Writing about current technology limits you to existing capitalist and corporate structures. Imagining the future <a href="https://daverupert.com/2017/10/a-good-science-fiction-story/">and the potential fallout</a> allows you to think without the confines of “Good because make money” which so much of our discourse is today.</p>
<h2>Who are you writing for?</h2>
<p>Woof. Good question. 90% of the time I’m writing to get ideas out of my head. Transfiguring ideas into text works wonders for me. I also tend to write for an abstract audience, people who are curious about the web and technology yet crave more from it; a person who considers themselves a technologist, but also factors in morality and other <a href="http://daverupert.com/2024/04/thoughts-on-cosmotechnics/">cosmotechnics</a>.</p>
<h2>What’s your favorite post on your blog?</h2>
<p><a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/08/quick-thoughts-on-chips/">Quick Thoughts on Chips</a> (2023) is up there but I feel like <a href="https://daverupert.com/2013/04/responsive-deliverables/">Responsive Deliverables</a> (2013) aka, the “tiny bootstraps” post, is a level of quality, thoughtfulness, and timelessness that I don’t achieve often. I’d like more “timeless” pieces like that, but I don’t exactly know how or if it’s worth trying to bottle that magic.</p>
<h2>Any future plans for your blog? Maybe a redesign, a move to another platform, or adding a new feature?</h2>
<p>I’m pretty comfortable with my site, but I have a couple changes in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c13gpBrnGEw&amp;t=225s">Use named grid lines</a></li>
<li>Blowout my tag pages with custom art direction</li>
<li>Make my mobile layout perfect</li>
<li>Write more <a href="https://daverupert.com/stories/">shitty sci-fi</a></li>
<li>Switch from Notion to Obsidian</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of those will happen over the course of a year, some in the dark of night, some never.</p>
<h2>Tag ‘em.</h2>
<p>What a responsibility to add people to this chain letter! Susan told me if I don’t forward this to 10 people, my grandparents will die! That seems extreme but okay. I’ll tag the following people who I think haven’t written one yet:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://zeldman.com/">Jeffrey Zeldman</a> - it feels fitting to pass the mic back to Jeffrey.</li>
<li><a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/">Eric Meyer</a> - another blogger that inspired me in my early days</li>
<li><a href="https://melanie-richards.com/">Melanie Richards</a> - a multi-talented person and another one of my favorite crafters.</li>
<li><a href="https://livelaugh.blog/">Jenn Schiffer</a> - talented artist and consistently way funnier than everyone else in the room.</li>
<li><a href="https://ericwbailey.website/">Eric Bailey</a> - one of my favorite web thinkers and also has <a href="https://buttondown.com/ericwbailey">the most interesting newsletter</a> out there.</li>
<li><a href="https://blakewatson.com/">Blake Watson</a> - deliverer of home-cooked applications</li>
<li><a href="https://joshcollinsworth.com/">Josh Collinsworth</a> - thoughtful blogger and word puzzle game developer</li>
</ul>
<p>Shoot. Only seven. Sorry, memaw and pepaw. Hopefully some unnamed individuals will answer the call.</p>

The issue is the same. When people post only to get attention, forget about anything useful getting done there. It's strictly a broadcast system. So the investment Masto and Bluesky make in discourse is imho wasted complexity. What we want is linking, not replies. If they were the web, they would be designed very differently. Anyway, in 2000, I asked people to put their ideas on their own sites, send me a link, and maybe I'll post it on my site. That right there is the plan for the new network. Facilitating that, it's as easy as posting on a twitter-like system (the early users <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2025/03/07/first-drafting/">confirm</a> that!), but the post goes into <i>your</i> space ie your blog, and a link goes to the person you're responding to, and it's up to them whether or not they want to amplify it, using their own criteria, in their space, to their subscribers. It's why twitter failed to be a keg of revolutionary ideas, instead one of warring factions in a prison. Not able to leave, but not able to do anything either.

I did a restoration of <a href="https://discuss.userland.com/">discuss.userland.com</a>, the discussion group for scripting.com between 1998 and 2001. I think now finally it works. If you find anything interesting in the archive, send me a link. A lot of the early blogs started from discussions there, heated at times. But a lot of good stuff came from it.

A question came up about the RSS feeds that WordLand maintains, so I <a href="https://github.com/scripting/wordlandSupport/issues/55">wrote it up</a> on the support site. Net-net: Unless you're developing a component of the <a href="https://textcasting.org/">textcasting vision</a>, you should probably use the WordPress-maintained feed for your site.

## Fucking Republicans and Medicare

date: 2025-03-09, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I am hereby changing the name of "Republicans" to "Fucking Republicans" because that's what they do and what we're going to do to them. Today's issue is Medicare, which hits home to me, a person who planned for health care and depends on Medicare.</p>
<p>I need my Medicare. It's my health insurance. Health insurance always been a problem for me, with pre-existing conditions, and at one point a lapsed corporate plan.</p>
<p>I finally got on solid ground or so I thought when I turned 65 a few years ago. Now I find out that the Repubs are going to cancel or reduce my insurance, and I don't imagine that a person my age, with my pre-existing conditions (we all have them once at this age) I could get insurance.</p>
<p>So please tell me Republicans, how this is meant to work? I am not stupid and I know Medicare is not out of money. Am I going to be paying out of pocket for my health care? Are there any doctors or hospitals who even do this any longer?</p>
<p>Repubs, if my Medicare goes down, you are going down too.</p>
<p>PS: The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLLFeZGeXbA">inspiration</a> for this fucking idea. </p>

## Krugman's paywall

date: 2025-03-09, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I'm not a paid subscriber to anything on Substack. But I do read a few of their newsletters when they come out, including <a href="https://paulkrugman.substack.com/">Paul Krugman's</a>. Almost always must-read stuff. </p>
<p>But he also writes on the "other side of the paywall." When he announced it, he said he doesn't need the money, so I wondered why he does it. I kept reading anyway.</p>
<p>But he does something incredibly annoying and as clueless imho as the things he calls out in his writing — I only find out an article is on the other side of the paywall after I've read the first few paragraphs. I am a fan and I would send the money directly if he asked for it, but not via Substack.</p>
<p>Here's an <a href="https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/the-clean-little-secret-of-social">example</a> of such a post. </p>
<p>So because I don't pay I have to lose that time every time you do this? Have some respect for us who read you. I'm as old as he is, and I like to use my time well. So please either get rid of the stinking paywall, or warn us up front.</p>
<p>And also consider getting off <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=substack">Substack</a>. It's not a good look.</p>

## Skype got shouted down by Teams. But it gave us free telephony

date: 2025-03-09, from: John Naughton's online diary

Today’s Observer column The design of Arpanet’s successor, the internet we use today, started in the early 1970s and it was first switched on in January 1983. The designers of the network were, from the outset, determined to avoid the &#8230; <a href="https://memex.naughtons.org/skype-got-shouted-down-by-teams-but-it-gave-us-free-telephony/40517/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>
