<h2 id="my-keynote-for-fediforum">My keynote for FediForum</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-04, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
<a href="https://fediforum.org/">FediForum</a> is a virtual conference
that starts tomorrow. If they had asked me to keynote, this is roughly
what I would say.
</p>
<p>
Imho this stuff is pretty freaking simple, esp since there are well over
20 years of prior art to use, and not that many ways to do what we’re
trying to do. I’m impatient, so here’s a quick set of observations with
my opinion, take it for what it’s worth, ymmv, etc.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
You shouldn’t be reinventing so much. Always look around for
<a href="http://essaysfromexodus.scripting.com/priorArtDesignMethod">prior
art</a>. That will make it possible for you to interop more quickly at
both a software level and at a human level.
</li>
<li>
Don’t invent stuff you think you may need later. Save that for later.
You have no intuition for what’s needed and more important nothing to
test against. You will get it wrong 100 percent of the time.
</li>
<li>
Don’t invent stuff you think you may need later that makes what you’re
doing now more complicated. I see a lot of that in ActivityPub.
</li>
<li>
The only reason you’re doing all this work is for interop. If you’ve
been doing it for years and you don’t have much meaningful interop
you’re doing it wrong.
</li>
<li>
Write the software first. Use formats that exist, or if you must invent
new stuff, make sure it’s simple. Work on its simplicity as you would
any other feature. Factor! If there are going to be 100 interoperable
products and you make it a little more difficult to implement, that work
will be multiplied 100 times. And it be a barrier to entry, so you may
not get the most powerful interop possible with the most interesting
products.
</li>
<li>
Read and follow the <a href="https://this.how/standards/">Rules for
Standards-makers</a>. There aren’t that many. But if you’re breaking
them, you’re not going to end up with a standard. If your goal is to
appear to be making standards, you should also read RFSM, and don’t do
anything in it. I’ve seen people do that btw.
</li>
<li>
Have you looked at the world outside the tech stuff to see how important
this all has become? All the time we’re wasting is very costly in
everything that depends on the social web actually existing as opposed
to just being talked about.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Now, what would I request if I could influence you??
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Mastodon and Bluesky should support inbound and outbound RSS, and do it
really well. Right now they do outbound only, and the implementations
are incomplete at covering the functionality they have now, and there
needs to be more (see the next item).
</li>
<li>
They’d support the basic features of the
<a href="https://textcasting.org/">textcasting</a> spec, including
Markdown because it’s a great standard, very much of the same school as
RSS. If it had existed when we did RSS 2.0 it would have been part of
it.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
That’s it. Really not much work.
</p>
<p>
From there we’d have 25 years of interop to explore.
</p>
<p>
And we could really call this the open social web.
</p>
<p>
I’m ready to do it any time you all are.
</p>
<p>
Yours in not wasting time.
</p>
<p>
Dave

everything goes well, the <a href="http://scripting.com/rss.xml">RSS
feed</a> for Scripting News will now have a channel-level image element
because it’s part of a network that requires an avatar-like image. This
required me to go through some very old code that my system still
depends on. It’s remarkable how much time this seemingly small feature
took to implement. One of these days I have to move this code to one of
my more modern servers. One reason it took so long is that a random
package that does something that never changes, had a breaking change in
it. The breakage culture of the Node.js world is just plain fucked up,
no other word for it.</p>

to joke with her how her name was a combination of two of the main types

<blockquote>
<p>
If the Ukrainians could sneak drones so close to major air bases in a
police state such as Russia, what is to prevent the Chinese from doing
the same with U.S. air bases? Or the Pakistanis with Indian air bases?
Or the North Koreans with South Korean air bases? Militaries that
thought they had secured their air bases with electrified fences and
guard posts will now have to reckon with the threat from the skies posed
by cheap, ubiquitous drones that cFan be easily modified for military
use. This will necessitate a massive investment in counter-drone
systems. Money spent on conventional manned weapons systems increasingly
looks to be as wasted as spending on the cavalry in the 1930s…

<p>If you followed the Knicks through the playoffs as I did, I recommend
the latest
<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/indianas-incredible-finals-run-a-knicks-summer/id1043699613?i=1000710778336">episode</a>
of the Bill Simmons podcast. It began with talk about the fan base and
that got me thinking. We don’t know what would happen if the Knicks were
in the Finals. Honestly. It could be the antidote to the crazyness.
Maybe the reason things are so fucked up is that it’s been 52 freaking
years since the Knicks won the title. Something happens every so often,
the energy field around the Knicks shifts – Patrick Ewing, Melo,
Linsanity and now Brunson. It’d be interesting to map that out against
events in the world at the corresponding times. We won’t find out this
year. In the same way I sensed that New Orleans was doomed when I went
to school there, I have a strong feeling connecting the Knicks to
something not sure what, but it feels big.</p>

<a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/05/29/3">CVE-2025-5054
and CVE-2025-4598</a>, both vulnerabilities are race condition bugs that

handle crash reporting and core dumps in Linux systems.

“This means that if a local attacker manages to induce a crash in a
privileged process and quickly replaces it with another one with the
same process ID that resides inside a mount and pid namespace, apport
will attempt to forward the core dump (which might contain sensitive
information belonging to the original, privileged process) into the
namespace.”…

Rosen gave a
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jayrosen.bsky.social/post/3lqmvt22be22u">brilliant
short talk</a> in 2008 about the role of links in the web, and how
journalism would have a hard time translating their self-contained
worlds with the idea of the web, which is there is no container other
than the whole world. Lots of important ideas in Jay’s talk. For
example, the idea of developing something from one direction or the
other. The problem with Bluesky and Mastodon is that they’re coming from
Twitter, and think they’re aiming toward the web, apparently – but they
must not understand the web, because they’re going to have to break with
Twitter’s model in <a href="https://textcasting.org/">so many ways</a>
to reach the web, they’ll never get there if they go slowly. If you
tried to develop the social web by starting with the web, you arrive at
a different place, w/o all the problems of twitter-like systems.
Different problems, but not the ones the twitter model has. How do I
know? Because I know. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span></p>

Doc’s post as viewed in Bluesky. His picture dominates. Imho it
shouldn’t.

</p>
<p>
I realize no one designed this, but it also is reality, it’s how a lot
of people see Doc’s writing.

<p>
Here’s my suggestion. When the user specifies a
<a href="https://wordpress.com/support/featured-images/">featured
image</a> for a post, set the og:image element in the head section of
the page. When they don’t specify such an image, omit that element.

<p><a href="https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/hating-new-york">Krugman
is right</a>, living in NYC is amazing. When I lived in Manhattan betw
2010 and 2019, I had it great but toward the end I yearned to live in
the mountains, the year before Covid hit (that was a bad time to be in
Manhattan, btw). Now I yearn to again live in the city. Funny how that
works. Even in the 70s I felt safe in NYC, and I commuted to school from
Queens to the Bronx. It was safe enough to let a 14 year old kid ride
the subway into Manhattan and up to the Bronx and back, every freaking
day. I never got mugged. And I did all kinds of dangerous stuff that
independent-minded teen agers do. If you can afford it, I recommend you
spend some time in NYC before you believe the bullshit the Repubs say
about it. They have reasons not to like the cities that have nothing to
do with how nice it is. In NYC we don’t trust our politicians to tell
the truth. You shouldn’t trust yours so much either, dear Republicans.

<h2 id="your-butt-still-stinks">Your butt still stinks</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-02, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Human beings spend far to much effort feeling better than some people or
feeling inferior to others.
</p>
<p>
This is understandable, I guess, as far as evolution is concerned, up to
a point, but I think we’ve been past that point for a long time now.
Now, evolution brought us to a point where in order to survive as a
species we have to get over this need to rank people and work together.
</p>
<p>
So if you feel other people are better than you, get over it. Same thing
if you feel better than others. You aren’t and they aren’t.
</p>
<p>
Your shit still stinks and as the great Republican philosopher Joni
Ernst so eloquently put it, she’s going to be dead pretty darned soon
and so will you.
</p>
<p>
I have to remind myself of this when I see a picture of someone who is
really ugly but acts like they’re not. And when I say ugly, I mean ugly
inside. I say to myself “Davey, they are reflecting off something inside
yourself that you don’t like. On a different day they might seem very
beautiful to you!” So I can relax and stop worrying so much about what I
think about them in the moment. It matters not one bit.

Made backups of three laptops and the external disk where we keep our
media to one of our set of external backup disks, and took those to the
office about 2 km away from where we live, exchanging them for the other
set of external backup disks which we had there. One set is always
outside of the house. Not sure whether that would help in an urban
disaster like an earthquake or a flood, but it would at least help
against a fire or a burglary.

morning and welcome to June. Another
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/opml/2025/05.opml">month
gone</a>, and coincidentally the end of the NBA season. I woke up this
morning with the worst hangover ever, and I haven’t had a drink in
months (never was my vice, I have others). The Knicks lost fair and
square to the Indianas last night. My first message came from NakedJen
who isn’t as far as I know a Mets fan, saying simply “Let’s go Mets!” I
like that, though it will of course take me some time to get
re-adjusted. I think the Knicks were jinxed because Brunson said in

Yankees. What! No. I think we may have to consider trading him to a team
without
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=philosophy">philosophy</a>.
I’m not sure anyone will have him though, considering this possibly
fatal flaw, philosophy-wise. And no doubt the Knicks are going to change
some things over the summer, and I’ve heard that they might try to get

unless they try to become a contender without kicking the Knicks in the

<h2 id="alt-text-on-this-blog">2025-05-27 Alt text on this blog</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-01, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2025-05-27-alt-text-on-this-blog">
2025-05-27 Alt text on this blog
</h1>
<p>
On the web, the alt text is a description of an image to be shown by
browsers when the image cannot be shown – like text browsers or screen
readers. So what about alt text on this blog? What about blog posts full
of photos, specifically? Like the <a href="Croatia">Croatia</a> posts.
</p>
<p>
I think that alt text should be unnecessary on my blog because the text
should carry the entire message. “Welcome to my
<a href="Wall_of_Text">Wall of Text</a>!” 😄
</p>
<p>
On fedi, I like alt text and I both read and write it. I hate clients
that don’t display it. I want to always read it. Therefore, on my blog,
the equivalent of alt text should always be readable. But real alt text
isn’t shown to me – the browser is showing me the pictures, instead. It
makes sense. And on fedi it only works because the applications and
front-ends don’t just use the alt text attribute for images in HTML –
they have an extra user-interface to allow me to read it. Buttons,
mouse-over, long-press, whatever it takes.
</p>
<p>
There are options for this blog, of course. Except I don’t like these
options.
</p>
<p>
I could reuse the alt text as the image title attribute which is shown
on mouse-over by default. I don’t like being forced to use mouse and I
don’t like duplicating the description.
</p>
<p>
In Markdown:
</p>
<pre><code>![alt text](url &quot;title&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>
I could automatically use the alt text as the title attribute but I
still don’t like to use the mouse to read the title attribute and I
wouldn’t be able to switch Markdown rendering engines as easily if I
hack it. Writing some Javascript to produce extra pop-ups or some other
user-interface element would be even worse, and it would need extra
clicking or keyboard navigation as a reader. No way.
</p>
<p>
The last option is the best. Just write the description above the image:
</p>
<pre><code>Description

![](url)
</code></pre>
<p>
I’ve tried using the title attribute for some of my recent picture-heavy
blog posts about Croatia and I’ve been checking the result using Gemini
and Gopher, and I’m not happy.
</p>
<p>
Compare the following two with the
<a href="https://alexschroeder.ch/view/2025-05-17-%C5%A1ibenik">web</a>
version where I can’t read the alt text. (Screenshots from
<a href="https://gmi.skyjake.fi/lagrange/">Lagrange</a> on my phone.)
</p>
<p>
The <a href="gemini://alexschroeder.ch/2025-05-17-šibenik">Gemini</a>
version looks OK with some text paragraphs being links to the images.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-1.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
The <a href="gopher://alexschroeder.ch/02025-05-17-šibenik">Gopher</a>
version shows the alt texts as weird disjointed text paragraphs that
sometimes repeat the preceding paragraph and sometimes don’t.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-2.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
I guess I could write longer alt texts until the Gopher version looks
good but then the Gemini version looks weird and the web version
continues to not show it.
</p>
<p>
Now check the Gemini and Gopher output for the page you’re reading right
now!
</p>
<p>
The <a href="gopher://alexschroeder.ch/02025-05-27-alt-text">Gopher</a>
version is OK. The line-breaks don’t look nice on the phone at the
default resolution so ignore that weird line-break. What we can see is
that the empty alt text generated an empty paragraph. Something I should
fix. 😅 But in general, it looks OK and reads well.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-3.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
The <a href="gemini://alexschroeder.ch/2025-05-27-alt-text">Gemini</a>
version still looks OK. It also links to the Gopher and Gemini versions,
so ignore those extra links. 😅 The browser substitutes the filenames
for the missing alt text. That works for me. I’m not sure what a screen
reader would do. Probably say: “Image. 2025-05-27-alt-text-3.jpg”? And
I’m not sure what a person with bad sight would prefer. At this point
I’d know that I can skip the image since I have already read the
description above.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-4.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
And here’s the same passage a day later, using the text browser
<code>lynx</code>. The inline links look good, and there’s no trace of
the screenshots. This is great! It’s as readable as the Gopher version
with no extra line-breaks, and the inline links are inline (unlike in
the Gemini version).
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-5.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Checking with <code>edbrowse</code>. The inline links are wrapped in
bracers, which looks good, and the images with no alt text are shown as
empty square brackets (<code>[]</code>) which works for me. Ideally, I
guess, they’d just disappear.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-6.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
All in all, I think this solution is better: Instead of alt text, just
write more text above each image.
</p>
<p>
What I’m less sure about is whether this automatically implies that all
images are “decorative” and therefore should have an empty alt text
(instead of no alt text). It seems to me that the filename being shown
is a lot of visual clutter, but that only seems to affect Gemini, not
the text browser.
</p>
<p>

<strong>2025-05-29</strong>. I fixed that minor issue in
<a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/markdown-gopher.git/">markdown-gopher</a>
so that it skips paragraphs containing just images with no alt text. 😄
</p>
<p>
<strong>2025-05-31</strong>. I added a piece of Javascript to copy the
alt text to the title attribute if the alt text is set and the title is
not. Perhaps that’ll motivate me to add more alt text.
</p>
<p>
This is what I added to my <code>view.html</code> template for
<a href="Odd%CE%BC">Oddμ</a>:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
function addTitle() {
  const images = document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;img&quot;);
  for (let img of images) {
    const alt = img.getAttribute(&quot;alt&quot;);
    const title = img.getAttribute(&quot;title&quot;);
    if (alt != null &amp;&amp; title == null) {
      img.setAttribute(&quot;title&quot;, alt);
    }
  }
}
window.addEventListener('load', addTitle);
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
