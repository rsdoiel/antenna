## Scriptnotes, Episode 677: Puzzle Box Storytelling, Transcript

date: 2025-03-17, from: John August blog

The original post for this episode can be found here. John August: Today’s episode has no bad language, but it does have some mild spoilers for Severance. If you’re trying to go into that show clean, without any spoilers, about midway through the show when Craig starts spouting wild theories, just skip ahead 30 seconds [&#8230;]

## How ‘The Righteous Gemstones’ Premiere Surprised Fans

</div> 
<p>The premier episode of the fourth and final season of <em>The Righteous Gemstones</em> has a lot of people talking.&nbsp;<br><br>The episode, titled simply “Prelude,” doesn’t feature any of the series’ regular cast. It also takes place during the Civil War, and not during the show’s present-day setting, as it follows an ancestor of the Gemstone family: Elijah Gemstone (played wonderfully by Bradley Cooper).<br><br>One of the main reasons the episode has created such a buzz is how much of a departure it is from the rest of the show. Cowritten and directed by <em>Gemstones</em> creator and star Danny McBride, “Prelude” is highly cinematic and carries far more gravitas than a typical episode of the comedic series.&nbsp;<br><br>There <em>have </em>been tonal shifts previously in <em>The Righteous Gemstones</em>, largely due to the acting chops of John Goodman (playing family patriarch Eli Gemstone), as well as the occasional dramatic-leaning turn. The same can be said for McBride’s other HBO series <em>Eastbound &amp; Down</em> and <em>Vice Principals</em>. Whether it’s a shocking burst of violence or a cathartic moment set to an evocative piece of music, McBride’s comedy — alongside frequent collaborators Jody Hill and David Gordon Green — has always been offset by not only a cinematic flair, but also a willingness to embrace different tones. &nbsp;</p>
