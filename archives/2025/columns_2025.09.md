## Is an Intel N100 a better value than a Raspberry Pi?

date: 2025-03-03, from: Jeff Geerling blog

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Is an Intel N100 a better value than a Raspberry Pi?</span>

            <p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: <em>it depends</em>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>About one year ago, I bought an Intel N100 mini PC (specifically the <a href="https://amzn.to/41EtTMk">GMKtec N100 NucBox G3</a>) and <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/when-did-raspberry-pi-get-so-expensive">compared it to the Raspberry Pi 5 8GB</a>.</p>

<p>A year later, and we have <a href="https://amzn.to/41gFu2O">a newer $159 16GB version of that mini PC</a> with a slightly-faster Intel N150, and a new <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/who-would-buy-raspberry-pi-120">16GB Raspberry Pi 5</a>.</p>

## Basic MS-DOS memory managementÂ for beginners

date: 2025-03-03, from: Liam on Linux

From a Reddit post.&nbsp;<br /><br /><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A very brief rundown:</p><ol>       <li><p>If you are using Microsoft tools, you need to load the 386 memory manager, <code>emm386.exe</code>, in your <code>CONFIG.SYS</code> file.</p></li><li><p>But, to do that, you need to load the XMS manager, <code>HIMEM.SYS</code>, <em>first</em>.</p></li><li><p>So your <code>CONFIG.SYS</code> should begin with the lines:</p></li>     </ol><pre>
DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\HIMEM.SYS
DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\EMM386.EXE
DOS=HIGH,UMB</pre><p>4. That's the easy bit. Now you have to find free Upper Memory Blocks to tell EMM386 to use.</p><p>5. Do a clean boot with F5 or F8 -- telling it not to process <code>CONFIG.SYS</code> or run <code>AUTOEXEC.BAT</code>. Alternatively boot from a DOS floppy that doesn't have them.</p><p>6. Run the Microsoft Diagnostics, <code>MSD.EXE</code>, or a similar  tool such as Quartdeck Manifest. Look at the memory usage between 640kB  and 1MB. Note, the numbers are in hexadecimal.</p><p>7. Look for unused blocks that are not ROM or I/O. Write down the address ranges.</p><p>8. An example: if you do not use monochrome VGA you can use the mono VGA memory area: 0xB000-0xB7FF.</p><p>9. One by one, tell EMM386 to use these. First choose if you want EMS (<strong>E</strong>panded Memory Services) or not. It is useful for DOS apps, but not for Windows apps.</p><p>10. If you do, you need to tell it:</p><pre>
DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\EMM386.EXE RAM</pre><p><strong>And</strong> set aside 64kB for a page frame, for example by putting this on the end of the line:</p><pre>
FRAME=E0000</pre><p>Or, tell it not to use one:</p><pre>
FRAME=none</pre><p>11. Or disable EMS:</p><pre>
DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\EMM386.EXE NOEMS</pre><p>12. <strong>Important</strong> Add these parameters one at a time, and reboot and test, every single time, without exception.</p><p>13. One you told it which you want now you need to tell it the RAM blocks to use, e.g.</p><pre>
DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\EMM386.EXE RAM FRAME=none I=B000-B7FF</pre><p>Again, reboot every time to check. Any single letter wrong can stop the PC booting. <em>Lots</em> of testing is vital. Every time, run MSD and look at what is in use or is not in use. Make lots of notes, on paper.</p><p>14. If you find EMM386 is trying to use a block that it mustn't you can eXclude it:</p><pre>
DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\EMM386.EXE RAM X=B000-B7FF
</pre><p>The more blocks you can add, the better.</p><p>15. After this -- a few hours' work -- now you can try to populate your new UMBs.</p><p>16. Device drivers: do this by prefixing lines in <code>CONFIG.SYS</code> with <code>DEVICEHIGH</code> instead of <code>DEVICE</code>.</p><p>Change:</p><pre>
DEVICE=C:\DOS\ANSI.SYS</pre><p>To:</p><pre>
DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\ANSI.SYS</pre><p>17. Try every driver, one by one, rebooting every time.</p><p>18. Now move on to loadable Terminate and Stay Resident (TSR) programs. Prefix lines that run a program in <code>AUTOEXEC.BAT</code> with <code>LH</code>, which is short for <code>LOADHIGH</code>.</p><p>Replace:</p><pre>
MOUSE</pre><p>With:</p><pre>
LH MOUSE</pre><p>Use MSD and the <code>MEM</code> command -- <code>MEM /c /p</code> -- to identify all your TSRs, note their sizes, and load them all high.</p><p>This is a day or two's work for a novice. I could do it in only an  hour or two and typically get 625kB or more base memory free, and I made  good money from this hard-won skill.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><br /><br /><img src="https://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=liam_on_linux&ditemid=93997" width="30" height="12" alt="comment count unavailable" style="vertical-align: middle;"/> comments

## Giving Away Tabs

## The best revenge is none

date: 2025-03-02, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/14997571.Pamela_Short">Pamela Short</a>: The best revenge is none. Heal yourself, forgive, move on and don't become like those who hurt you.</p>
<p>There's a pragmatic reason for this. I found, when I was young and didn't know better, that getting revenge didn't just hurt the target, it also left me with a deep pain. When I did something to another person I was also doing it to myself. I found that the dark cloud of my harmful behavior would stay with me for a long time, maybe never going away. I would find it hard to forgive myself for what I did. So it's better to not try to get revenge, and let the pain of being hurt dissipate on its own.</p>
<p>I have a story to go with that. In the beginning of RSS, I had a partner and customer ask me at lunch if there were any circumstances when I would take the server we ran for them off the air. I said that's a weird question, but of course not. The very next day, his team announced they were taking over RSS, completely changing it, and the first I heard of it was in the public announcement. Later that same day, my brain boiling over in anger at being treated so poorly, I did eventually land on the idea of just taking his server offline. And then I laughed that he knew I'd get to that, and wanted to plant a little marker there for whatever reason, I don't know. But no I didn't take his server off the air. He may be a bastard, but he did pay for the service so his server stays up. And two years later, his project a failure, I came out with RSS 2.0 and that was the end of that. It wasn't revenge, it was just picking up the ball in the playground and restarting the game that they had caused to stop. We went on and RSS did a lot of good work.</p>

## Unnecessary

date: 2025-03-02, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p><tt>Itâs a secret to everyone! This post is for RSS subscribers only.
<a href="https://daverupert.com/rss-club/">Read more about RSS Club</a>.
</tt></p>
<p>Yesterday, my daughter was in Dallas for the NCA Cheer Competition. My wife sent me a text letting me know her team won! Yay! My daughter is a national champion at age 9. Ten minutes later, the next text I get is that thereâs an active shooter and theyâre in lockdown. Panic consumed the 30,000 people in the convention center. Kids trampled in the stampede to get out. Families and teams separated. Youth running across a 10 lane freeway to escape, traffic screeching to a halt. Horrifying.</p>
<p>The actual cause of the incident was some cheer parents getting into a fight which knocked down some metal poles. The whole situation is sad. Unnecessary trauma because some dumb parents lost their ability to be civil. Unnecessary trauma created through our lax gun laws and inability to stop this uniquely American horror. An unnecessary situation. Thankfully no one was critically injured and the shooter wasnât realâ¦ this time. Weâre living inside a lit powder keg at all times and its exhausting.</p>

There is no  benefit to users of either app that they use the same complicated and new structure to communicate, where simpler and established standards would work just as well. There is a way they could make this work. Come up with a plugin architecture and something like an app store, so developers could define new data types, and then we'd really have something. I would probably do an <a href="https://opml.org/">outliner</a> plugin first, then a <a href="http://scripting.com/2022/08/25/210902.html">Markdown</a> plugin.
