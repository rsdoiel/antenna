This informative video by @lainaminute (L.A. in a Minute) on Instagram expands on something I anticipated when I shot this photo album of the KSPN/710 transmitter site at 12775 Burbank Boulevard almost four years ago: that the land under the transmitter—19 acres of fenced-in grass surrounded by suburbs—would be put up for sale by Disney, [&#8230;]

## Making the Fediverse More Accessible With Claude 3.7 Sonnet

date: 2025-03-07, from: Jonudell blog

A few years ago I abandoned Twitter in favor of Mastodon. Recent events validate that choice and underscore the strategic importance of a decentralized fediverse that can’t be owned by a single corporate or state actor. But while Mastodon meets my needs, much of the Twitter diaspora has gone to Bluesky. That’s fine for now &#8230; <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2025/03/07/making-the-fediverse-more-accessible-with-claude-3-7-sonnet/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Making the Fediverse More Accessible With Claude 3.7 Sonnet</span></a>

## Essential FOSS tools to make macOS suck less

date: 2025-03-07, updated: 2025-03-07, from: Liam Proven's articles at the Register

<h4><span class="label">Friday FOSS fest</span> Moved from Windows or Linux? Smooth some of the rough edges</h4>
      <p>There are some idiosyncrasies about macOS that long term Mac users may never notice, but cause frustration in people more used to how Windows does things – or the much more customizable Linux desktop experience. Here are a few of The Reg FOSS desk&#39;s favorite tools we routinely install on new machines to make life a little more comfortable or convenient.</p>

I was really out of shape for that. So I started riding every third day or so. And then without any warning I just passed my 600th ride. Not too bad! :-)

## ★ Apple Is Delaying the ‘More Personalized Siri’ Apple Intelligence Features

date: 2025-03-07, updated: 2025-03-08, from: Daring Fireball

This announcement is disappointing, but unsurprising. If it’s Apple’s general policy not to ship a product before it’s ready, that applies tenfold for a product involving LLM access to deeply private on-device information.

Before our media was gradually taken over by Russia, they did it to Ukraine, but they managed to dig their way out, had a democratic election, resulting in their current government. So it's not impossible to dig your way out. But you have to stop insisting that <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/03/07/letHitlerSpeak.png">Hitler be allowed</a> to speak.

The Fediverse is impossible to use even for people who understand what it's trying to do, and most people have no idea. The answer: <b>Stop trying to reinvent Twitter</b>. It wasn't a great idea! And figure out what really works in a decentralized system. It requires some serious brain work.

## 2025-03-05 How do you process the news?

date: 2025-03-07, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-03-05-how-do-you-process-the-news">2025-03-05 How do you process the news?</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking at the blog and noticing that I haven&rsquo;t posted much. It&rsquo;s hard.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A long time ago I discontinued all my daily newspapers and just kept the weekly left-leaning cooperatively-owned <a href="https://www.woz.ch/">Wochenzeitung</a>. Once a month it comes with the German edition of <a href="https://monde-diplomatique.de/">Le Monde Diplomatique</a>.</p>

<p>I used to read a lot of newspaper articles online, when I saw links in social media. But more and more of them erected a paywall. more and more of them have become pretty useless unless I go through the uBlock Origin settings to unblock random domains with more scripts and things. And so I have stopped reading them, too. And when politics look bad, I hesitate even more.</p>

<p>Sometimes I feel like perhaps this means the end of the attention economy for me. Back to books?</p>

<p>Some news sources I follow online:</p>

<ul>
<li><a class="account" href="https://troet.cafe/@woz" title="@woz@troet.cafe">@woz</a> is the feed for the weekly paper in German that I am subscribed to</li>
<li><a class="account" href="https://masto.ai/@meduza_en" title="@meduza_en@masto.ai">@meduza_en</a> for stuff about Russia, Ukraine and the USA</li>
<li><a class="account" href="https://chaos.social/@netzpolitik_feed" title="@netzpolitik_feed@chaos.social">@netzpolitik_feed</a> for civil rights online</li>
<li><a class="account" href="https://mstdn.social/@Bellingcat" title="@Bellingcat@mstdn.social">@Bellingcat</a> for various strange things</li>
<li><a class="account" href="https://mastodon.social/@theindex" title="@theindex@mastodon.social">@theindex</a> by <a class="account" href="https://mastodon.social/@Daojoan" title="@Daojoan@mastodon.social">@Daojoan</a> for independent news</li>
</ul>

<p>As always, the problem is that I feel the news should be a bit like taxes: Pay something and then read what you want. The payment models sort of imply that you&rsquo;d pay for all the subscriptions, which won&rsquo;t work. Or they imply that you&rsquo;d pay per article, which doesn&rsquo;t work because of the credit card fees. No micropayment means that one or two articles is already the equivalent of the whole subscription. And even then, I&rsquo;m not sure whether micropayments would sit well with me. My current status is that I only pay for the newspaper but <a href="https://www.woz.ch/abo/prowoz">at a pro level</a> for CHF 590 per year and I feel that CHF 50 per month ought to pay for all of my news.</p>

<p>Some days I think I should subscribe to a Swiss digital newspaper, <a class="account" href="https://republik.social/@republik_magazin" title="@republik_magazin@republik.ch">@republik_magazin</a>. Just to support more diversity in a shrinking ecosystem. But I don&rsquo;t know whether I can process the news, to be honest.</p>

<p>That seems to be my main problem.</p>

<p>How do I process the news? 😥</p>

date: 2025-03-07, from: Doc Searls (at Harvard), New Old Blog

The radio station known since 1935 as KSFO, &#8220;The Sound of the City,&#8221; was a landmark at 560 on the Bay Area radio dial for most of the last century.  Other landmarks were KGO/810, KCBS/740, KFRC/610, and KNBR/680. KFRC went away in 2005, as religious programming moved to AM from 106.9, and KCBS added that [&#8230;]

Rupak Ghose's <a href="https://rupakghose.substack.com/p/the-100-billion-bloomberg-for-academics"><i>The $100 billion Bloomberg for academics and lawyers?</i></a> is essential reading for anyone interested in academic publishing. He starts by charting the stock price of RELX, Thomson Reuters, and Wolters Kluwer, pointing out that in the past decade they have increased about ten-fold. He compares these publishers to <a href="https://bloombeg.com">Bloomberg</a>, the financial news service. They are less profitable, but that's because their customers are less profitable. Follow me below the fold for more on this.<br />

The leader in the market is RELX, which used to be <a href="https://rupakghose.substack.com/p/the-100-billion-bloomberg-for-academics">Elsevier</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
In the earlier share price chart RELX was the lower of the three lines but given its higher dividend payouts its overall shareholder returns have paced with its peers, and it is one of the best-performing large-cap stocks in the UK. The following chart shows that it is now in the top five largest in the UK by stock market value and bigger than BP. Its price-to-earnings multiple of around 30x is more like a tech giant.

Well, it is only 3/4 of Nvidia's or Apple's PE but around the same as Microsoft.<br />

The second largest listed player is Thomson Reuters worth around $80 billion (and this trades on a much higher price-to-earnings multiple than RELX). Add in Wolters Kluwer, and the much smaller Springer Nature which was listed late last year, and the combined stock market value of the four firms is more than $215 billion.
</blockquote>
Thomson Reuters' PE is around 36, a bit less than Apple's. The $215B market cap is pricing in massive growth, which given the uncertain economic conditions and the finances of their customers seems optimistic.<br />

The four companies made about $8B in profit on about $25B in revenue, or a <a href="https://rupakghose.substack.com/p/the-100-billion-bloomberg-for-academics">gross margin of around 32%</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The following chart illustrates the revenues and operating profits of the four firms in 2024. RELX generated as much operating profits as its two largest peers combined.
</blockquote>
Ghose explains how the oligopoly publishers can extract so much rent by quoting Dan Davies' book <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Unaccountability-Machine-Systems-Terrible-Decisions-ebook/dp/B0CGFWBFD6"><i>The Unaccountability Machine</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Firstly, the customer base is captive and highly vulnerable to price gouging. A university library has to have access to the best journals, without which the members of the university can’t keep up with their field or do their own research. Secondly, although the publishers who bought the titles took over the responsibility for their administration and distribution, this is a small part of the effort involved in producing an academic journal, compared to the actual work of writing the articles and peer-reviewing them. This service is provided to the publishers by academics, for free or for a nominal payment (often paid in books or subscriptions to journals). So not only does the industry have both a captive customer base and a captive source of free labour, these two commercial assets are for the most part the same group of people.
</blockquote>
Ghose then <a href="https://rupakghose.substack.com/p/the-100-billion-bloomberg-for-academics">comments</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
In essence, the academics fight to help the publishers extract monopoly profits. The whole process depends on the value of having your articles appear or receive citations in the best journals. This becomes an unaccountability sink to which universities outsource their whole system of promotion and hiring. Davies compares this to the PageRank algorithm used by Google.
</blockquote>
The big four publishers' $25B in revenue doesn't come exclusively from publishing content they get for free from academics, but about <a href="https://rupakghose.substack.com/p/the-100-billion-bloomberg-for-academics">half of it does</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
This market for academic publishing generates around $20 billion of revenue per year with half of the market controlled by the five largest firms: Elsevier (part of RELX), John Wiley &amp; Sons, Taylor &amp; Francis, Springer Nature, and SAGE.
</blockquote>
The distinctive feature of the market over the last decade or more has been the publishers failing to exercise their gate-keeping role, and the resulting flood of low-quality papers.<br />

Elsevier has been frantically acquiring and spawning <a href="https://rupakghose.substack.com/p/the-100-billion-bloomberg-for-academics">journals</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
the chart below illustrates that RELX-owned Elsevier is not only the clear market leader, but it has also grown significantly in volume.
</blockquote>
Does anyone think there is 70% more high-quality research than there was a decade ago? The graph comes from <a href="https://www.ouvrirlascience.fr/excessive-growth-in-the-number-of-scientific"><i>Excessive growth in the number of scientific publications</i></a> by Benoît Pier and Laurent Romary:<br />
<blockquote>
The first result concerns the total number of articles published, which follows very closely an exponential growth (+5.6% per year). Even taking into account the increase in the number of researchers over this period, we can deduce that the time spent on obtaining the results, validating and peer reviewing them has decreased significantly.
</blockquote>
This growth has been powered by the rise of Article Processing Charges (APCs). A journal that lives on APCs rather than subscriptions has a strong <a href="https://www.ouvrirlascience.fr/excessive-growth-in-the-number-of-scientific">disincentive to reject papers</a><br />
<blockquote>
By computing the average annual number of articles published per journal, the authors observe that the growth (significant, but not overwhelming) of the traditional publishers is mainly due to the expansion of the number of journals in their  catalogues, whereas the very strong growth of Frontiers and MDPI is the result of an explosive increase in the number of articles per journal. It should be noted that these two publishers, which appeared more recently, are thriving through publication fees paid by authors.
</blockquote>
Pier and Romary <a href="https://www.ouvrirlascience.fr/excessive-growth-in-the-number-of-scientific">conclude</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The triad (MDPI, Frontiers, Hindawi) increasingly use special issues to publish more and more articles, and this phenomenon is accompanied by a significant shortening of the time allotted to the peer-review process.
</blockquote>
Pier and Romary base their article upon <a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2309.15884"><i>The strain on scientific publishing</i></a> by Mark A. Hanson <i>et al</i> whose abstract reads:<br />
<blockquote>
Scientists are increasingly overwhelmed by the volume of articles being published. Total articles indexed in Scopus and Web of Science have grown exponentially in recent years; in 2022 the article total was approximately ~47% higher than in 2016, which has outpaced the limited growth - if any - in the number of practising scientists. Thus, publication workload per scientist (writing, reviewing, editing) has increased dramatically. We define this problem as the strain on scientific publishing. To analyse this strain, we present five data-driven metrics showing publisher growth, processing times, and citation behaviours. We draw these data from web scrapes, requests for data from publishers, and material that is freely available through publisher websites. Our findings are based on millions of papers produced by leading academic publishers. We find specific groups have disproportionately grown in their articles published per year, contributing to this strain. Some publishers enabled this growth by adopting a strategy of hosting special issues, which publish articles with reduced turnaround times. Given pressures on researchers to publish or perish to be competitive for funding applications, this strain was likely amplified by these offers to publish more articles. We also observed widespread year-over-year inflation of journal impact factors coinciding with this strain, which risks confusing quality signals. Such exponential growth cannot be sustained. The metrics we define here should enable this evolving conversation to reach actionable solutions to address the strain on scientific publishing.

Hanson <i>et al</i> present a very revealing figure, showing (A) the evolution through time of the mean time taken to review papers, and (B) the distribution of those times for 2016, 2019 and 2022. The figure shows two clear groups of publishers, more and less predatory:<br />
<ul>
<li>The triad of predatory publishers do far less reviewing, and the amount they do decreases over time.</li>
<li>The less predatory publishers do far more reviewing and the amount they do increases over time.</li>
<li>The predatory publishers' distribution of review times increasingly skews to the short end, where the other publishers' distribution is stable and skews slightly to the long end.</li>
</ul>
So Elsevier is the biggest player in academic publishing. How <a href="https://rupakghose.substack.com/p/the-100-billion-bloomberg-for-academics">big is it?</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
RELX Elsevier has over 3,000 journals including leading brands like the Lancet. These journals published more than 720,000 articles in 2024. This is almost one-fifth of all scientific articles. Elsevier’s online platform ScienceDirect has tens of millions of pieces of peer-reviewed content from tens of millions of researchers. Its citation database has content from tens of thousands of journals.<br />
<br />
The scientific, technical, and medical information division is RELX’s second largest with revenues of around $4 billion of revenues, roughly equally split between articles/research content vs databases, tools, and electronic reference solutions. The business is largely subscription fee driven and 90% of its revenues are from electronic products rather than print publishing and face-to-face events.
</blockquote>
But is it growing fast enough to justify a <a href="https://rupakghose.substack.com/p/the-100-billion-bloomberg-for-academics">P/E of 30?</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Despite the growth in the number of articles, this is RELX’s slowest-growing division with 3-4% revenue growth and 4-5% profit growth in recent years. They are expanding in line with our faster than the industry. But it is a very healthy cash cow with $1.5 billion of operating profits in 2024. This circa 40% operating margin is the best in the RELX group and far superior to other professional and business information businesses. The number two player Springer Nature has lower operating margins of around 30% in their academic publishing business, but this is much higher than their other products.
</blockquote>
30-40% operating margins demonstrate the oligopoly's rent extraction. Four of every ten dollars Elsevier extracts from the world's education and research budgets goes straight to their shareholders. And more goes to their executives' salaries and bonuses.<br />

## Tech and democracy

date: 2025-03-06, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I found the <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/03/04/why-techdirt-is-now-a-democracy-blog-whether-we-like-it-or-not/">TechDirt piece</a> by Mike Masnick about being a democracy blog disturbing because imho it should have been about democracy at least since 2017, when it was clear that Twitter had just elected a president of the United States. That was a clear strong signal that tech and democracy were tightly connected. </p>
<p>At the time I tried to <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/01/14/whatIfTwtrIsBoughtByARepub.html">raise the alarm</a>, in tech and in finance, that a Republican could buy Twitter for $12B, and that was a cheap price considering the value of the presidency in a tech entrepreneur's hands.</p>
<p>My experience in Silicon Valley goes back to the late 70s, so I have a pretty good understanding of the personality of tech entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>My blog, <a href="http://scripting.com/">Scripting News</a>, has been about democracy since <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/">inception</a>, in 1994, though it has primarily been about technology. I got the same complaints that I should stick to tech, but I didn't see a line of separation. The stakes were large then, but now they're much larger and as Masnick notes, impossible to ignore. </p>
<p>In the mid-90s there was not much of a debate whether the First Amendment applied to the web, the consensus was that it did not! The NYT didn't defend the 1st A on the web, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_Decency_Act">Congress passed a law</a> saying the 1st A didn't apply and a Democratic president, Clinton, signed the law. That was a pretty clear signal. (We were saved by a Federal appeals court, otherwise who knows what we'd be doing now.)</p>
<p>In tech, every generation thinks they're seeing a problem for the first time. This is almost never true. It's like anything else, we're iterative, going over the same issues again and again, and we have a chance to wake up at any point and learn from our mistakes and not repeat the previous cycle, but it seems we never do.</p>
<p>Most important is that we <b>work together</b> and share what we learned. But first you have to be aware that there is history. You know the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/634544-those-who-cannot-remember-the-past-are-condemned-to-repeat">famous line</a> about people who "cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it."</p>
<p>We have great historians working here, and TechDirt is more famous than Scripting News is now. It would be a shame if the historians overlooked the historic connection between tech and democracy because they weren't aware it was documented much earlier than 2025. And btw -- don't miss that <a href="https://this.how/googleAndHttp/">Google et al</a> would like to deprecate the archive of the early web. No one is paying attention to that problem, and it's another way history is lost. The wisdom of the Google people forcing this on the rest of us is very much like the DOGE bros in DC today. </p>

People who criticize Dems for weak opposition at the SOTU are not hypocrites only if they said before the event what they would do. I was glad not to have to choose. I think in the end they did what made sense to each one individually. The range of response by the Dems was much broader than the Repubs. We should be thankful they haven't capitulated, as so many have, esp in what we used to think of as journalism.

You can't dump a huge amount of code at me and expect me to quickly see what changed, that's not how human intellect works, but this is something computers are <i>extremely</i> good at. I told my bot that it would work a lot better if they just told me what to change. I said this: "I have a lot of experience being a human being and working with other humans, and all your clients as far as I know are human." In other words, be concise and direct. This is what it said in response. "That’s a sharp observation, and I appreciate the insight. I'll keep focusing on clarity, directness, and being actually helpful rather than just dumping information. If I ever seem to be leading you down a non-optimal path, feel free to call it out!" Note how concise the response was. More advice for the bot. Help your human understand. I think maybe eventually we may be their pets. Try scratching behind the ears. On the other hand, to my human friends, do not depend on the strategies they choose. They will never on their own question the path they took. It may not be the optimal one, but they'll keep going down it. It's up to you to say nah this isn't the way I want to go, and they will always respect that. It's not like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wy4EfdnMZ5g&t=18s">HAL in 2001</a>. I've sometimes wasted  whole programming session going in the wrong direction assuming my bot was good at this. None of them are, as far as I can tell.

The single most important thing about what Musk is doing is that it is Musk that is doing it. Not elected, not accountable to anyone, and the only way we know what he's doing is from the aftermath. We play no role in his choices. Plus, he would be our last choice if we were in the market for a crazy despot to ruin our country. He wasn't born or educated here, and thus has very little idea of who we are and thus what the people he's firing do.

Gardens are colonized spaces: think of the quintessential American garden with its close-hewn evenly-green lawn of invasive grass, some matching cherubic flowers along the front of the house, maybe one tree or a couple flowering shrubs, lined by a manicured hedge or wall of arborvitae. This is a landscape in service to human desires &#8212; [&#8230;]

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-03-03, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

Idea for SNL. A special episode of Law and Order where the cops arrest someone for being disrespectful to Trump,. The prosecutors debate among themselves if they have to do this, no one quits, they don't feel good about it but they prosecute, being assured by the District Attorney it's the right thing to do. When there are objections judge rules in favor of the government most of the time, but wants to show balance so once or twice rules in favor of the defense, but it doesn't matter, when the judge gives instructions to the jury he says basically the only option is to convict, or so it seems that's what he's saying and dutifully, the jury convicts. There are sentencing standards, provided by the DOJ so the judge sentences the accused to life at hard labor. Back in the studio at 30 Rock the audience isn’t sure if they should laugh, slowly realizing it’s not meant to be funny, the skit fades out to a commercial break.

## Is an Intel N100 a better value than a Raspberry Pi?

date: 2025-03-03, from: Jeff Geerling blog

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Is an Intel N100 a better value than a Raspberry Pi?</span>

            <p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: <em>it depends</em>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>About one year ago, I bought an Intel N100 mini PC (specifically the <a href="https://amzn.to/41EtTMk">GMKtec N100 NucBox G3</a>) and <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/when-did-raspberry-pi-get-so-expensive">compared it to the Raspberry Pi 5 8GB</a>.</p>

<p>A year later, and we have <a href="https://amzn.to/41gFu2O">a newer $159 16GB version of that mini PC</a> with a slightly-faster Intel N150, and a new <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/who-would-buy-raspberry-pi-120">16GB Raspberry Pi 5</a>.</p>

## Basic MS-DOS memory management for beginners

date: 2025-03-03, from: Liam on Linux

From a <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DOS/comments/1j1efb0/wheres_my_upper_memory/">Reddit post</a>.&nbsp;<br /><br /><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A very brief rundown:</p><ol>       <li><p>If you are using Microsoft tools, you need to load the 386 memory manager, <code>emm386.exe</code>, in your <code>CONFIG.SYS</code> file.</p></li><li><p>But, to do that, you need to load the XMS manager, <code>HIMEM.SYS</code>, <em>first</em>.</p></li><li><p>So your <code>CONFIG.SYS</code> should begin with the lines:</p></li>     </ol><pre>
DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\HIMEM.SYS
DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\EMM386.EXE
DOS=HIGH,UMB</pre><p>4. That's the easy bit. Now you have to find free Upper Memory Blocks to tell EMM386 to use.</p><p>5. Do a clean boot with F5 or F8 -- telling it not to process <code>CONFIG.SYS</code> or run <code>AUTOEXEC.BAT</code>. Alternatively boot from a DOS floppy that doesn't have them.</p><p>6. Run the Microsoft Diagnostics, <code>MSD.EXE</code>, or a similar  tool such as Quartdeck Manifest. Look at the memory usage between 640kB  and 1MB. Note, the numbers are in hexadecimal.</p><p>7. Look for unused blocks that are not ROM or I/O. Write down the address ranges.</p><p>8. An example: if you do not use monochrome VGA you can use the mono VGA memory area: 0xB000-0xB7FF.</p><p>9. One by one, tell EMM386 to use these. First choose if you want EMS (<strong>E</strong>xpanded Memory Services) or not. It is useful for DOS apps, but not for Windows apps.</p><p>10. If you do, you need to tell it:</p><pre>
DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\EMM386.EXE RAM</pre><p><strong>And</strong> set aside 64kB for a page frame, for example by putting this on the end of the line:</p><pre>
FRAME=E0000</pre><p>Or, tell it not to use one:</p><pre>
FRAME=none</pre><p>11. Or disable EMS:</p><pre>
DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\EMM386.EXE NOEMS</pre><p>12. <strong>Important</strong> Add these parameters one at a time, and reboot and test, every single time, without exception.</p><p>13. Once you told it which you want now you need to tell it the RAM blocks to use, e.g.</p><pre>
DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\EMM386.EXE RAM FRAME=none I=B000-B7FF</pre><p>Again, reboot every time to check. Any single letter wrong can stop the PC booting. <em>Lots</em> of testing is vital. Every time, run MSD and look at what is in use or is not in use. Make lots of notes, on paper.</p><p>14. If you find EMM386 is trying to use a block that it mustn't you can eXclude it:</p><pre>
DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\EMM386.EXE RAM X=B000-B7FF
</pre><p>The more blocks you can add, the better.</p><p>15. After this -- a few hours' work -- now you can try to populate your new UMBs.</p><p>16. Device drivers: do this by prefixing lines in <code>CONFIG.SYS</code> with <code>DEVICEHIGH</code> instead of <code>DEVICE</code>.</p><p>Change:</p><pre>
DEVICE=C:\DOS\ANSI.SYS</pre><p>To:</p><pre>
DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\ANSI.SYS</pre><p>17. Try every driver, one by one, rebooting every time.</p><p>18. Now move on to loadable Terminate and Stay Resident (TSR) programs. Prefix lines that run a program in <code>AUTOEXEC.BAT</code> with <code>LH</code>, which is short for <code>LOADHIGH</code>.</p><p>Replace:</p><pre>
MOUSE</pre><p>With:</p><pre>
LH MOUSE</pre><p>Use MSD and the <code>MEM</code> command -- <code>MEM /c /p</code> -- to identify all your TSRs, note their sizes, and load them all high.</p><p>This is a day or two's work for a novice. I could do it in only an  hour or two and typically get 625kB or more base memory free, and I made  good money from this hard-won skill.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><br /><br /><br /><img src="https://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=liam_on_linux&ditemid=93997" width="30" height="12" alt="comment count unavailable" style="vertical-align: middle;"/> comments

## The best revenge is none

date: 2025-03-02, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/14997571.Pamela_Short">Pamela Short</a>: The best revenge is none. Heal yourself, forgive, move on and don't become like those who hurt you.</p>
<p>There's a pragmatic reason for this. I found, when I was young and didn't know better, that getting revenge didn't just hurt the target, it also left me with a deep pain. When I did something to another person I was also doing it to myself. I found that the dark cloud of my harmful behavior would stay with me for a long time, maybe never going away. I would find it hard to forgive myself for what I did. So it's better to not try to get revenge, and let the pain of being hurt dissipate on its own.</p>
<p>I have a story to go with that. In the beginning of RSS, I had a partner and customer ask me at lunch if there were any circumstances when I would take the server we ran for them off the air. I said that's a weird question, but of course not. The very next day, his team announced they were taking over RSS, completely changing it, and the first I heard of it was in the public announcement. Later that same day, my brain boiling over in anger at being treated so poorly, I did eventually land on the idea of just taking his server offline. And then I laughed that he knew I'd get to that, and wanted to plant a little marker there for whatever reason, I don't know. But no I didn't take his server off the air. He may be a bastard, but he did pay for the service so his server stays up. And two years later, his project a failure, I came out with RSS 2.0 and that was the end of that. It wasn't revenge, it was just picking up the ball in the playground and restarting the game that they had caused to stop. We went on and RSS did a lot of good work.</p>

## Unnecessary

date: 2025-03-02, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p><tt>It’s a secret to everyone! This post is for RSS subscribers only.
<a href="https://daverupert.com/rss-club/">Read more about RSS Club</a>.
</tt></p>
<p>Yesterday, my daughter was in Dallas for the NCA Cheer Competition. My wife sent me a text letting me know her team won! Yay! My daughter is a national champion at age 9. Ten minutes later, the next text I get is that there’s an active shooter and they’re in lockdown. Panic consumed the 30,000 people in the convention center. Kids trampled in the stampede to get out. Families and teams separated. Youth running across a 10 lane freeway to escape, traffic screeching to a halt. Horrifying.</p>
<p>The actual cause of the incident was some cheer parents getting into a fight which knocked down some metal poles. The whole situation is sad. Unnecessary trauma because some dumb parents lost their ability to be civil. Unnecessary trauma created through our lax gun laws and inability to stop this uniquely American horror. An unnecessary situation. Thankfully no one was critically injured and the shooter wasn’t real… this time. We’re living inside a lit powder keg at all times and its exhausting.</p>

There is a way they could make this work. Come up with a plugin architecture and something like an app store, so developers could define new data types, and then we'd really have something.

## ★ Why Can’t We Screenshot Frames From DRM-Protected Video on Apple Devices?

date: 2025-03-01, updated: 2025-03-01, from: Daring Fireball

This “feature” accomplishes nothing of value for anyone, including the streaming services, but imposes a massive (and for most people, confusing and frustrating) hindrance on honest people simply trying to easily capture high-quality (as opposed to, say, using their damn phone to take a photograph of their reflective laptop display) screenshots of the shows and movies they’re watching.

## One America Together

date: 2025-03-01, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez">AOC</a> asked for ideas of what to do for the SOTU.</p>
<p>I suggested we come up with a new slogan. Like this.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>One America Together.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Make hats, purple — enough for everyone, including the Repubs. </p>
<p>During applause, Dems rise and chant “One America Together.”</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>

## I don't like sand

date: 2025-03-01, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>Happened upon a good example of the problem with AI generated <code>alt</code> text. It’s a gif of the infamous scene from Star Wars Episode II where Hayden Christensen playing Anakin Skywalker tells Natalie Portman’s character Queen Amadala, “I don’t like sand.” It’s the first phrase in the worst lines of dialogue in cinematic history. And here’s how the computer interpreted the gif…</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2025/sand.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the image upload interface of Bluesky that autocompletes alt-text. As described in the post there’s a gif from Star Wars Episode II where Anakin tells Queen Amadala “I don’t like sand”, but the alt text says “a man and a woman are sitting next to each other and the woman is saying I don’t like sand”" /></p>
<p>The AI said “a man and a woman are sitting next to each other and the woman is saying I don’t like sand.” Not only does this miss the context that it’s from the world famous movie Star Wars, it gets the speaker entirely wrong. It OCR’d the text fine, but missed relaying the entire context.</p>
<p>Context. That’s what <code>alt</code> text is. I’d hypothesize that <em>context</em> is probably one of the biggest reasons why language evolved. A caveman could yell “AHHH!H” to alert others of dangers, but I imagine after a couple rounds of those others would begin asking, “Ok, Grog, I understand you think there’s an AHHH!H out there, but what <em>kiiiiiiind</em> of AHHH!H?”</p>
<p>My ears are starting to perk up when I hear the word context. I hear all the time that “<em>You have to give the AI more context and it will give you a better answer.”</em> AI has a lot of vectorized text and image processing nodes, but it’s short on context I guess. Will AI one day have every frame of the expensive-to-license Star Wars franchise indexed in its brain like I do? Or are we the gatherers and keepers of context? Does our capacity for empathy (which allows us to project and inhabit other contexts we don’t necessary have) set humans apart?</p>
<p>I hate to leave on such an open-ended question, but I think we can all agree… that woman doesn’t like sand.</p>

## The only way to know for sure... is to build a prototype

date: 2025-03-01, from: Dave Rupert blog

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0m60QbT85Tc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>I’ve mentioned Mark Brown’s channel Game Makers Tool Kit <a href="https://daverupert.com/2018/10/how-mega-man-11-s-levels-do-more-with-less-game-maker-s-toolkit/">many</a> <a href="https://daverupert.com/2020/09/follow-the-fun/">times</a> <a href="https://daverupert.com/2021/10/the-mistake-every-new-game-developer-makes/">before</a>. Well, I’m back with another banger about “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/?v=0m60QbT85Tc">How to find amazing game ideas</a>”. The whole video is great but I specifically want to highlight something Mark said during the last ten seconds of the video as the credits and video thumbnails started to roll…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And then the final question to answer is… is the game idea actually fun? Because the truth is… our brains are terrible video game simulators. Almost every idea seems fun in our heads. But once we actually make it we’ll realise  that it’s boring, that it’s too complicated, and that it has disastrous  unforeseen design problems. So the only way to know for sure… is to build a prototype.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answer again –and I cannot stress this enough– is prototypes.</p>
<p>“Our brains are terrible video game simulators.” Woof. This is a powerful sentiment and I regularly encounter this. I feel this is true with websites as well. I can make the best fantasy website – so beautiful, so perfect in pixels, so incredibly evocative people will throw their wallets at me – but if I haven’t put prototypes into people’s hands, I’m introducing a huge amount of risk.</p>
<p>That’s all. Prototypes. I think the rest of the video applies to where you can find ideas for amazing websites:</p>
<ul>
<li>Other websites - <del>Stealing</del> Borrowing good UX is a great start for an idea</li>
<li>Genres - Follow the rules or offering an interesting twist on an existing genre (like ecommerce)</li>
<li>Mechanics - Adding interesting iteractions or gimmicks can add distinction</li>
<li>Experience - Go hard on experience and ambiance!</li>
</ul>
<p>Mark also raises some important questions at the end and I wanted to highlight two of those because I think they’re important.</p>
<ul>
<li>“Can you make it?” - Be honest with yourself, do you in your personal capacity have the capability to deliver the idea? I often succumb to making ideas in my head that are so big and complex that it becomes impossible to build and maintain.</li>
<li>“Will it stand out?” - In the sea of websites or podcast people come across each day, will it be unique or will it join the cacophony?<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>And wouldn’t you know it, those are the types of questions that prototypes help to answer.</p>
<section class="footnotes">
<ol>
<li id="fn1">
<p>Personal websites are exempt from this question. I think “It won’t stand out” is one reason people avoid making one. The world (more than ever) needs your unique perspective. Don’t let uniqueness be a reason <em>not to try</em> and make something. Get to the first checkpoint, make your idea, get the first draft in people’s hands. Then over time find what makes your idea unique and breakaway from the default template. <a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-backref">↩</a></p>
</li>
</ol>

## My cookie spec problem

Before RFC 6265 was published in 2011, the world of cookies was a combination of anarchy and guesswork because the only &#8220;spec&#8221; there was was not actually a spec but just a brief text lacking a lot of details. RFC 6265 brought order to a world of chaos. It was good.

## Windows 7 lives! How to keep your favorite fossil running

<h4>You probably shouldn&#39;t, but if you must, you can</h4>
      <p>As the expiration date for Windows 10 presses ever closer, spare a thought for its classic forerunner. No, not Windows 8 – nobody ever loved that – but Windows 7, with its classic Start menu, tasteful transparency, lack of built-in advertising, and so on.</p>
