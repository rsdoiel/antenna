<h2 id="evolving-the-preprint-evaluation-world-with-sciety">Evolving the
preprint evaluation world with Sciety</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-17, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
This post is based on an interview with Sciety team at eLife.
</p>
<h2 id="what-is-sciety">
What is Sciety?
</h2>
<p>
Sciety is a community-led initiative developed by a team within eLife,
that brings together expert evaluations of papers in one place. It is
focused on preprints, preprint review and curation.
</p>
<h2 id="can-you-tell-us-more-about-how-sciety-works">
Can you tell us more about how Sciety works?
</h2>
<p>
Sciety aggregates preprints from different sources to facilitate the
processes of discovery and evaluation. Groups can triage the content and
offer preprint reviews and endorsements, and individual researchers can
learn about and share preprints of interest and their evaluations. We
see the value of increasing trust in preprints, and transparency around
the process of peer review, and we are trying to highlight this value
and encourage more people to take part.
</p>
<p>
There are two key angles to Sciety: first, as preprints proliferate,
we’re helping to make people more productive in their research by only
surfacing the content they might be interested in and that they know
they can trust. Second, we are also trying to get more people involved
in the public review and curation of preprints. Contributors on Sciety
are part of ‘groups’, representing organisations and other communities
that facilitate some form of preprint evaluation. We’re broadly talking
about peer review, but we also see the highlighting and summarisation of
research. eLife, Biophysics Colab, MetaROR and Gigabyte, for example,
are all providing some kind of review summary which Sciety shows as a
‘curation statement’. There’s also this additional layer of individual
curation on top of it: we have people creating their own highlights in
lists which they curate by topic; for example, ‘preprints by authors in
the Global South’ or ‘Papers we want to discuss in our lab’. There is
also an update feed available to users to help them keep track of all
the reviews and endorsements from the groups they follow. We post these
assessments and reviews alongside the preprint, which others can then
use as an indicator of trust: why should one care about this particular
study? As a given group – let’s say GigaByte – and its reviewers
highlight the specific strengths of a preprint or reference an updated
version, this feedback offers essential context for readers.
</p>
<p>
By making this evaluation and curation activity visible, Sciety
clarifies who has reviewed the work and which groups have added it to
their lists. These signals are invaluable for readers seeking reliable,
curated research. The activity feed, which at present shows you all the
added value in the form of comments, reviews and curation we are
bringing from diverse sources, could be expanded to show different forms
of curation activity in the future. Furthermore, other providers ingest
and surface this information on their own platforms, such as Europe PMC
and bioRxiv.
</p>
<h2 id="what-is-your-main-use-of-crossref-resources">
What is your main use of Crossref resources?
</h2>
<p>
We started using the Crossref API to pull in the front matter of
articles. Originally, these were only bioRxiv preprints, and then we
expanded to various other preprint servers. We would aggregate reviews
and build on top of all the preprint servers that have put the authors’
content out there.
</p>
<p>
We were mostly after a representation of the papers that we could link
to: titles, authors, abstracts, publication dates, and, to have a way to
go from the DOI of a paper, a classic Crossref entry point. Initially,
we used the public API, but the performance wasn’t high enough for what
we needed and we switched to Metadata Plus. This immediately increased
the speed at which we got data to the point where we could compose pages
on the fly and talk to Crossref simultaneously. Even if we needed to
pull 10 or 20 different paper titles at the same time to show a list of
articles, it stayed that way for a long time. Next, we implemented
caching – that is, we started storing temporal local copies to improve
performance further. Eventually, we expanded the set of preprint servers
we were interested in. It’s always been quite a good experience to be
able to put in a DOI and use the same code, essentially, to pull out
titles, author information and so on. Crossref does this great job of
aggregating the world of content so that we don’t have to. The metadata
standardisation via Crossref’s API saves us the need to write special
code for every new preprint server.
</p>
<p>
By the end of 2023, we were interested in multiple revisions and
versions of a single preprint. Because the scholarly world is moving on,
we can now see cases where the updates to a manuscript produce multiple
versions in bioRxiv, and these might eventually evolve into an article
in eLife, Nature, or another journal. The publication history complexity
of papers has been increasing and we started relying a lot on Crossref
to trace the relationships and the different versions of a paper across
time. There is some good support on the relationship metadata on
Crossref APIs, where you can see that a preprint has a new version with
a different DOI, or conversely, that a preprint has an older version. Or
you can see that a preprint has become a journal article, or the journal
article was originally a preprint – along with all the dates that
accompany these different versions. And we can establish the time it
took for a preprint to become a journal article. In some cases it can
take years, which is not great, right? We don’t want science to be stuck
and not relied upon for years. So it helps us to make our case that
preprints are the evolution of publishing, that authors publish them and
then the preprints evolve rather than being stuck between gates kept by
journals.
</p>
<h2 id="what-can-you-tell-us-about-the-use-of-preprints">
What can you tell us about the use of preprints?
</h2>
<p>
We have noticed an increase in the interest in how a paper evolves over
time and the cross-links between different preprint expressions or
journal articles. We’re now seeing enthusiasm from those who are trying
alternative publishing models to bring reviewed scientific preprints to
people faster, and there is also interest in the transparency of a
journal. And I think that’s part of what the Crossref relationship
metadata gives us.
</p>
<p>
For example, we collaborated on a paper aimed at enhancing the culture
of preprint peer review. One of the things we observed was that it was
published on an OSF preprint server, and then went on to be published in
PLOS Biology. As we’d started this project to show the relationships
between something that had originally been a preprint, we noticed that
the connection between PLOS and OSF for that specific preprint was not
explicit. So, we asked a colleague if this was something that could be
done. And our contact at PLOS said, “yes, we’ll do this”. At the time,
we were aware of Crossref’s intention to either make this more
manageable or to do it in bulk. This also prompted another group on
Sciety to explore whether they could do the same. Consequently, GigaByte
and GigaScience, two other reviewing communities on Sciety, inquired
with their publishing platform, Riverview, if they could do the same.
Eventually, they realised there was a way to connect the dots through
Crossref, and they also started doing it. So, there seems to be a lot of
enthusiasm around this idea of making the relationships more explicit:
we should show if something has been a preprint, because it’s important
to the authors, and it’s important to show the transparency in the
journey. That was a real-world example of something that we’re able to
service through Sciety by using the Crossref metadata, and the community
is responding in a very positive manner to that.

How has your experience been using Crossref services? What are you
looking forward to seeing in the future?
</h2>
<p>
The <em>works</em> endpoint is really the 99% of what we have been
historically interested in. We generally experiment by putting DOIs in
the public API or trying to discover content in the API itself. The
amount of data is so big that there are always different examples of
what we seek. And we don’t have many performance problems now because we
have adopted some aggressive caching. So anything that comes from
Crossref is typically cached for 24 hours.
</p>
<p>
For example, take a bioRxiv preprint that might have multiple versions
available on bioRxiv itself, because it’s quite common for authors to
update the preprint as they make new changes to it. With this context,
an example of something we would like to see is supporting <strong>the
preprint version number</strong>. So this is something that we could
implement for bioRxiv over some specific preprint servers on Sciety. But
in the end, as we expanded our set of preprint servers, we had to get
rid of that, because there wasn’t a sustainable way to aggregate it
across most servers, like we would do with Crossref. So there’s probably
a space there for papers as living documents. And we certainly have an
interest in preprint-specific metadata – that’s where we will place our
bets.
</p>
<p>
Also, as part of the preprint review metadata group, which is something
that formed out of the recent meeting with EMC Europe and ASAPbio, we’re
trying to drive forward a <strong>recommendation and prototypes for more
consistency in preprint review metadata</strong>. It’s quite exciting to
be involved in this and, as you can see, Sciety is a place where we’re
starting to pull all this stuff together. And like I say, it is a bit of
a Wild West. <strong>There are so many things that are called a review,
but in metadata, we know there are different terminologies.</strong> As
people are saying, everyone should be commenting on preprints, everyone
should be curating them, and we’re trying to make some sense of that.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, in terms of data formats, we started to use XML
because of the higher fidelity. So, we had to compare the JSON and XML,
and we still use the ‘transform works’ API because the JSON format
doesn’t have enough formatting for the article abstracts and titles for
our satisfaction. So things like italicising the research organism, for
example <em>C. elegans</em>, and other markups that come through the
abstract are not preserved in JSON. We can only get the maximum fidelity
on these article front matter if we go for the XML versions.
</p>
<p>
Working on Sciety and exploring Crossref metadata to make preprint
review more open and valuable has been a rewarding experience.
