President Donald Trump’s tariff fight with the European Union just got a
little more heated after the EU accused U.S. tech giants Google and
Apple of breaching antitrust rules. Could this escalate the EU-U.S.
trade war? We’ll also talk about the erasure of Black history and why
Elon Musk is about to be back in the money. Finally, Nova makes us smile
with some of the funniest and nerdiest bumper stickers seen around the
streets of Los Angeles.

<p>
<em>Hey Smarties! Today we’re revisiting an episode from earlier this
year that might help you make sense of all the tit for tat tariff fight
from the past few weeks. It unpacks some tariff history and the
potential economic consequences of President Trump’s ongoing trade
war.</em>

<p>
If President Donald Trump goes through with his plan to levy sweeping
tariffs on foreign imports, it wouldn’t be the first time the U.S. has
done such a thing. Ever heard of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930?
Anyone? Those tariffs are widely credited with sinking the United States
deeper into the Great Depression. And although global trade looks
different nowadays, they can teach us a lot about how Trump’s
protectionist approach to global trade could play out. On the show
today, Inu Manak, a fellow for trade policy at the Council on Foreign
Relations, explains how the Smoot-Hawley tariff debacle can shed light
on the current moment, why the president has the power to wield tariffs
in the first place, and how punishing trading partners could leave the
U.S. economy at a disadvantage. Plus, what this fight has to do with the
1980s film “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off” and Roomba vacuum cleaners!

On today’s episode, Kai Ryssdal and Kimberly Adams discuss the Donald
Trump administration’s disregard for the courts. The White House has
ignored a judge’s order to turn around a pair of deportation flights and
failed to rehire federal workers. A constitutional crisis has arrived.
Plus, get ready for a three-bleep Kai rant. And how anime helps explain
the GOP’s attempt to get around the real cost of its $4 trillion tax
cut.
