Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0732 AM CDT Mon Jul 21 2025

Valid 211300Z - 221200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE NORTHERN PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms capable of producing large hail, severe gusts,
and perhaps a tornado or two will be possible today and tonight
across parts of the northern Plains. Additional isolated strong to
severe storms may occur across portions of the central Plains.

...Northern Plains into the Upper Midwest...
A long-lived and compact MCS has advanced into parts of west-central
MN this morning. This convection is on the northern periphery of
meaningful low-level moisture and related instability. It should
generally weaken over the next few hours while it tracks
southeastward over southern MN as a low-level jet gradually lessens.
But in the short term, it may still be capable of producing
occasional strong to severe wind gusts. Behind this activity, a
moist and rather unstable airmass will exist across the northern
Plains along and south of a convectively reinforced front that
should become oriented generally east-west along the ND/SD border by
late this afternoon. Large-scale ascent across the northern Plains
will likely be weak for much of the day, as upper ridging remains
prominent over the central CONUS.

Even so, there are indications that a weak mid-level perturbation
emanating from upper troughing over the Pacific Northwest should
overspread the northern Rockies and adjacent High Plains of
central/eastern MT by mid/late afternoon as ample daytime heating of
a slowly moistening low-level airmass occurs. A belt of enhanced
west-southwesterly mid-level flow will accompany this feature,
supporting ample veering/strengthening of the wind profile with
height through mid/upper levels. Related strong deep-layer shear of
40-50+ kt will easily support supercells with initial development
off the Bighorns given the presence of at least moderate instability
across the High Plains. Large hail will be possible with these
supercells this afternoon, followed by an increasing severe wind
threat with time this evening/overnight into parts of the Dakotas as
convection potentially grows upscale, and where ample MUCAPE and
strong deep-layer shear will be present along/north of the surface
boundary. The development of elevated supercells also appears
possible across parts of the Dakotas late tonight as a low-level jet
gradually strengthens, with a related threat for at least isolated
severe hail if they occur.

...Central Plains...
Much of the central Plains will remain capped today, as the upper
ridge and warm temperatures aloft exert their influence. A surface
trough is expected to extend southward across the central High
Plains this afternoon, and a remnant MCV related to earlier
convection should move eastward along/near the NE/KS border. Both of
these features may aid in at least isolated thunderstorm development
this afternoon, in the presence of moderate to strong instability
amid modest deep-layer shear. Isolated severe hail and wind gusts
may occur with any of the more robust cores that can develop and be
maintained in an otherwise weak forcing regime. The Marginal Risk
has been expanded southward a little to include more of northern KS
and southeast NE, where strong to severe convection may develop
later today in close proximity to the MCV.

...Tennessee Valley into the Southeast...
A weak MCV related to ongoing convection across MO and southern IL
this morning will track southeastward across the TN Valley and
vicinity through this afternoon. Modest west-northwesterly flow
should be in place today across parts of the OH/TN Valleys into the
Southeast. This may support loosely organized multicells and pulse
thunderstorms today, as mostly sunny conditions aid in the
development of moderate to locally strong instability this
afternoon. While deep-layer shear is forecast to remain weak, some
of this convection may still be capable of producing strong to
locally damaging winds. Parts of these regions may be considered for
inclusion in a Marginal Risk in a later outlook update, pending
additional observational/model trends.

## SPC Jul 21, 2025 Day 4-8 Severe Weather Outlook

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0353 AM CDT Mon Jul 21 2025

Valid 241200Z - 291200Z

...DISCUSSION...
Medium-range models indicate that mid-level ridging, initially
centered over the Ohio Valley, will weaken late this work week
through next weekend, as flow undergoes substantive amplification
upstream.  This appears likely to include a significant short wave
trough digging southeast of the Aleutians, accompanied by
lower/mid-tropospheric cyclogenesis across the northeastern Pacific.
 Part of a higher latitude blocking pattern, little subsequent
movement of this cyclone is forecast through early next week, as an
expansive, prominent mid-level ridge also evolves in the downstream
lower latitudes, across much of the Intermountain West, Rockies and
Great Plains into mid and lower Mississippi Valley.

However, as a notable mid-level low continues slowly east of Hudson
Bay, across northern Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador, a belt of
seasonably strong westerly mid/upper flow may be maintained across
Ontario and Quebec this Thursday through Friday.  Along the
favorably sheared southern fringe of this regime, seasonably moist
low-level air advecting ahead of a stalled to southward advancing
frontal zone may contribute to sufficient destabilization for the
evolution of organizing thunderstorm clusters capable of producing
swaths of damaging wind gusts.  The extent to which this may impact
U.S. portions of the Great Lakes into New England remains unclear.

It might not be out of the question that a similar type regime could
evolve beneath developing northwesterly mid-level flow, from the
North Dakota/Minnesota international border area into the Upper
Midwest/Great Lakes late next weekend into early next week.  Current
guidance is still suggestive that this is a lower probability, but
this could be due to the low predictability of the pertinent
features at this extended range.

Mesoscale Discussion 1738
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0241 PM CDT Sun Jul 20 2025

Areas affected...south-central South Dakota across western Nebraska
and toward northwest Kansas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 201941Z - 202215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered severe storms appear likely later this afternoon
from south-central SD across west-central NE and toward northwest
KS. A few cells may produce large hail, with locally damaging gusts.
A tornado is possible over southern SD into far northern NE after
23Z. A portion of the area may require a watch.

DISCUSSION...Surface map shows low pressure extending from southwest
SD across western NE and into the CO/KS border area, with strong
heating. This trough will continue to deepen, and sufficient
convergence within the uncapped air mass should allow for widely
scattered storms to develop late this afternoon.

Of particular note is the warm front area which currently curls
northwestward out of northern NE and into south-central SD. Here,
heating is occurring on the cool side of the boundary, where
dewpoints remain above 70 F and low-level shear is enhanced. Any
supercell that develops here, most likely after 23Z, could be
tornadic at times, and produce very large hail as it proceeds
southeastward, aided by a modest evening low-level jet.

Farther south into the deeper/heated air mass, higher based storms
are expected, and overall shear is weaker as well. However, steep
lapse rates will favor locally severe gusts, and even some hail in
the early and robust formation stages.

Areas affected...southern Indiana and Ohio...northern Kentucky

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 201835Z - 202130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A few strong storms producing locally damaging gusts
cannot be ruled out later this afternoon from southern Indiana
across southern Ohio and northeast Kentucky.

DISCUSSION...An MCV continues to move rapidly eastward across
northern IN, well north of a stalled front draped across southern
IL/IN and southwest OH. Meanwhile, a very moist air mass remains
near this boundary, with heating occurring upstream across the Mid
MS and OH Valleys.

While the entire warm sector is unstable, areas near the front exist
beneath slightly stronger deep-layer mean winds, on the southern
periphery of the larger scale trough (and MCV) influence.

Visible imagery show increasing CU fields from southern IN into
northern and eastern KY, and scattered storms are likely within this
zone. Locally strong downbursts will be possible, but any more
substantial wind threat would be conditional on a large cluster of
storms producing outflow, and tracking east/southeast near the
boundary. At this time, it appears a watch will not be necessary.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 530
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
410 PM EDT Sun Jul 20 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Connecticut
  Massachusetts
  Far Southern Maine
  Southern New Hampshire
  Rhode Island
  Southern Vermont
  Coastal Waters

* Effective this Sunday afternoon and evening from 410 PM until
  900 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 65 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1 inch in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Scattered thunderstorms are forecast to continue to
develop and intensify and pose primarily a threat for strong to
severe gusts (55-65 mph).  Isolated large hail may accompany the
stronger cells.  This activity will likely reach the coast by the
mid evening.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 80
statute miles north and south of a line from 30 miles east northeast
of Boston MA to 25 miles south southwest of Pittsfield MA. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU0).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1 inch. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 55 knots. A few
cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 400. Mean storm motion vector
28025.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0256 PM CDT Sun Jul 20 2025

Valid 211200Z - 221200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHWESTERN AND NORTH-CENTRAL
NEVADA...

The Critical area across northwest Nevada was expanded to include
portions of north-central Nevada with this update. Latest ensemble 
guidance suggests high probabilities that Critical conditions will
continue into this region on Monday afternoon. Otherwise, the
Elevated area remains unchanged. See previous discussion for more
information.

..Thornton.. 07/20/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1249 AM CDT Sun Jul 20 2025/

...Synopsis...
The upper-level trough in the Northwest will continue to dig
southward through the day on Monday. Some increase in the mid-level
jet is expected to occur from northwest Nevada into the northern
Rockies. A surface low will deepen in the northern Great Basin.

...Central/northern Great Basin into western Wyoming...
A broad area of elevated fire weather conditions are expected across
these regions. Surface winds will reach 15-20 mph in most locations,
though areas of higher speeds are possible in terrain-favored areas.
Single digit RH is possible in parts of central/northern Nevada, but
15-20% will be more common elsewhere.

Critical conditions are expected along the Sierra Front in northwest
Nevada. Here, the mid-level jet will enhance winds aloft during the
afternoon. While the surface low will not be overly deep, the
combination of these factors will support winds around 20 mph near
the terrain. Gusts to around 30 mph are also possible. There is some
potential for high level clouds to limit RH reductions. Even with
some of these marginal factors, wind speeds should be sufficient to
promote rapid fire spread in fuels that are very dry (ERCs above
90th percentile).

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0239 PM CDT Sun Jul 20 2025

Valid 202000Z - 211200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PORTIONS OF
THE CENTRAL INTO NORTHERN PLAINS...PARTS OF THE OHIO VALLEY...AND
PARTS OF THE NORTHEAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms appear most likely this afternoon into this
evening across parts of the Northeast, portions of the northern and
central Plains, and perhaps the Ohio Valley.

...20Z Update...
The primary change made to the Day 1 outlook was to add 5 percent
tornado probabilities across south-central SD into north-central NE.
Here, a cluster of supercells is expected to develop along a diffuse
warm-frontal boundary, where directional low-level shear will be
present. Up to 200 m2/s2 effective SRH in this region may support
the development of a tornado in addition to severe winds and very
large hail, given 2500-4000 J/kg MLCAPE by evening. 

Consideration was also given to remove Slight risk and 2 percent
tornado probabilities over the OH Valley given remnant cloud cover
and overall lack of upper support to foster an organized severe
threat. However, on the immediate southern periphery of this cloud
deck resides an axis of overlapping 2000+ MLCAPE and 30+ kts of
effective bulk shear. Should storms manage to develop, especially
before nocturnal cooling commences, a conditional risk for scattered
damaging gusts or a brief tornado would exist, so 15 percent severe
wind/2 percent tornado probabilities have been maintained.

Otherwise, the previous forecast (see below) remains on track.

..Squitieri.. 07/20/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1130 AM CDT Sun Jul 20 2025/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will amplify across the Northeast today with
increasing mid-level flow ahead of an approaching jet streak. A
low-amplitude ridge will build somewhat across the Upper Midwest.
Farther west, mid-level flow will strengthen across the northern
Rockies into the northern Plains as a trough amplifies on the
Pacific Northwest coast. 

...Northeast...
Weak to moderate instability is forecast to develop across the
Northeast through mid afternoon as the airmass continues to
destabilize.  Midday surface analysis indicates temperatures are
warming into the 80s with dewpoints in the upper 60s to lower 70s. 
As the cold front advances east into this uncapped airmass,
scattered thunderstorms should develop. Shear of 30 to 35 knots and
relatively long/straight hodographs will support the potential for
supercells. Weak mid-level lapse rates will be the primary limiting
factor for large hail, but the overall favorable shear with strong
venting aloft and potential supercells may support some isolated
large hail. 

Damaging wind gusts will be the primary threat, both from initial
cells and also from any clusters which develop. Any stronger
clusters with bowing segments could support a better organized
damaging wind swath. The greatest wind damage threat will likely
exist from western Massachusetts to far southern Maine. 

...Southeast MT into the Dakotas and Central Plains...
Lee troughing is forecast to extend southward from eastern MT into
the central High Plains near and south of the westerlies confined to
the northern tier of states.  Elevated weak thunderstorm activity
along the ND/SD border may continue but considerable uncertainty
exists whether these storms will intensify and pose a severe risk
this afternoon.  Meanwhile, farther west, moist low levels arc from
southeast MT southeastward through west-central SD and south into
NE/northwest KS.  Strong heating will contribute to a moderate to
very unstable airmass from the central Plains states into eastern
MT.  Easterly low-level flow beneath 30-40 kt 500 mb flow in
southeast MT will support organized storms, including supercell
potential.  Isolated to scattered storms are forecast to develop and
spread east into the Dakotas.  Other isolated to widely scattered
storms are possible from SD southward into NE/CO/KS border vicinity
late this afternoon into the evening.  

Large to very large hail will be possible with any supercells that
develop within this general region.  However, the severe wind threat
may increase by this evening and become the main threat as storms
congeal into one or more clusters or MCS.

...Ohio Valley...
Visible-satellite/radar composite shows an elongated area of
showers/thunderstorms from northern MO east into western OH in
conjunction with an MCV moving east from IL into IN.  Additional
storm development along the composite front/trailing outflow
boundary is expected, but timing of this storm activity remains
unclear.  Nonetheless, differential heating along the baroclinic
zone will yield 2000 to 3000 J/kg MLCAPE amidst moderate effective
shear (25-35 kt).  A few clusters are forecast to eventually evolve
later this afternoon into the evening with the stronger storms
capable primarily of a wind-damage threat.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0230 PM CDT Sun Jul 20 2025

Valid 221200Z - 231200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE UPPER MIDWEST...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong/severe thunderstorms may impact parts of the
northern Great Plains into the Upper Midwest Tuesday into Tuesday
night, posing a risk for severe wind and hail. Damaging thunderstorm
wind gusts are also possible across parts of the Southeast.

...Northern Plains to the Upper Midwest...
Along the northwestern periphery of an expansive midlevel ridge
centered on Mid MS Valley, moderate west-southwesterly midlevel flow
will be in place from the northern Plains to the Upper Midwest --
downstream of a persistent midlevel trough over the Northwest.
Several embedded impulses should advance through the belt of
west-southwesterlies, while a surface low moves slowly eastward
across the Dakotas. Downstream of the surface low, middle/upper 70s
dewpoints beneath a steep midlevel lapse rate plume will contribute
to a corridor of extreme surface-based buoyancy along a warm-front
type feature draped across the Upper Midwest. While subtle forcing
for ascent and potential early-day convection cast uncertainty on
the overall convective scenario here, a broad/strong low-level jet
(and related warm-air advection), the extreme buoyancy, and strong
deep-layer shear will support robust/organized storms capable of
producing swaths of severe wind and hail. 

Farther west over eastern MT into the Dakotas, subtle midlevel
height falls atop seasonably rich boundary-layer moisture will also
favor strong to severe storms, with a risk of severe wind gusts and
large hail.

...Southeast...
A very high PW air mass will be in place across the Southeast, where
diurnal heating will contribute to moderate surface-based buoyancy.
As a weak cold front impinges on this air mass during the afternoon,
modestly enhanced midlevel northerly flow will support loosely
organized storm clusters capable of producing damaging winds.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1230 PM CDT Sun Jul 20 2025

Valid 211200Z - 221200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
EASTERN/CENTRAL MONTANA...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms capable of producing severe wind gusts and
large hail are expected across parts of the northern Great Plains.
Damaging thunderstorm wind gusts are also possible across parts of
the Ohio Valley and the Southeast.

...Northern Plains...
Downstream of a slow-moving midlevel trough over the Northwest, a
related southwesterly jet streak will emerge over the northern
Rockies into the adjacent High Plains during the day. Related
forcing for ascent will aid in widely scattered thunderstorm
development within a deeply mixed air mass over western/central MT.
As storms track eastward into an increasingly moist and unstable air
mass over central/eastern MT, around 50 kt of effective shear will
promote supercells and small organized clusters. Any longer-lived
storms will be capable of producing severe wind gusts and large
hail. 

...Ohio Valley and the Southeast...
Modestly enhanced west-northwesterly flow will be in place from the
OH/TN Valleys to the Southeast. Here, diurnal heating amid deep
tropospheric moisture will contribute to an environment favorable
for locally damaging thunderstorm wind gusts through the afternoon.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1154 AM CDT Sun Jul 20 2025

Valid 201700Z - 211200Z

...Dry Thunderstorms...
A few isolated thunderstorms will be possible across west-central
Nevada. Overall, PWs around 0.75" and generally slow storm motions
around 5-10 kts should promote wetting rainfall. However, strikes
outside of the core may promote new starts, given critically dry
fuels. Overall, this risk looks to remain too isolated for inclusion
of a dry thunderstorm area.

No changes are needed to the previous D1 Fire Weather Outlook
Elevated area. See previous discussion below for more information.

..Thornton.. 07/20/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1248 AM CDT Sun Jul 20 2025/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough will begin to sag into northern California and
the northern Great Basin today. A surface trough will develop from
the Northwest into the central Great Basin.

Elevated to locally critical conditions are possible from northern
Nevada into the Snake River Plain and western Wyoming. RH will be
lowest in Nevada where 10-20% is expected. Farther north and east,
15-20% will be more common. Surface wind speeds will generally range
from 15-20 mph in most locations. With some terrain enhancement in
the Snake River Plain, there is some potential for briefly stronger
winds. This location has a greater probability for sustained
critical conditions, though ensemble guidance continues to suggest
it will remain quite localized.

Valid 201630Z - 211200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PORTIONS OF
THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL PLAINS...OHIO VALLEY...AND PARTS OF THE
NORTHEAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms appear most likely this afternoon into this
evening across parts of the Northeast, portions of the northern and
central Plains, and perhaps the Ohio Valley.

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will amplify across the Northeast today with
increasing mid-level flow ahead of an approaching jet streak. A
low-amplitude ridge will build somewhat across the Upper Midwest.
Farther west, mid-level flow will strengthen across the northern
Rockies into the northern Plains as a trough amplifies on the
Pacific Northwest coast. 

...Northeast...
Weak to moderate instability is forecast to develop across the
Northeast through mid afternoon as the airmass continues to
destabilize.  Midday surface analysis indicates temperatures are
warming into the 80s with dewpoints in the upper 60s to lower 70s. 
As the cold front advances east into this uncapped airmass,
scattered thunderstorms should develop. Shear of 30 to 35 knots and
relatively long/straight hodographs will support the potential for
supercells. Weak mid-level lapse rates will be the primary limiting
factor for large hail, but the overall favorable shear with strong
venting aloft and potential supercells may support some isolated
large hail. 

Damaging wind gusts will be the primary threat, both from initial
cells and also from any clusters which develop. Any stronger
clusters with bowing segments could support a better organized
damaging wind swath. The greatest wind damage threat will likely
exist from western Massachusetts to far southern Maine. 

...Southeast MT into the Dakotas and Central Plains...
Lee troughing is forecast to extend southward from eastern MT into
the central High Plains near and south of the westerlies confined to
the northern tier of states.  Elevated weak thunderstorm activity
along the ND/SD border may continue but considerable uncertainty
exists whether these storms will intensify and pose a severe risk
this afternoon.  Meanwhile, farther west, moist low levels arc from
southeast MT southeastward through west-central SD and south into
NE/northwest KS.  Strong heating will contribute to a moderate to
very unstable airmass from the central Plains states into eastern
MT.  Easterly low-level flow beneath 30-40 kt 500 mb flow in
southeast MT will support organized storms, including supercell
potential.  Isolated to scattered storms are forecast to develop and
spread east into the Dakotas.  Other isolated to widely scattered
storms are possible from SD southward into NE/CO/KS border vicinity
late this afternoon into the evening.  

Large to very large hail will be possible with any supercells that
develop within this general region.  However, the severe wind threat
may increase by this evening and become the main threat as storms
congeal into one or more clusters or MCS.

...Ohio Valley...
Visible-satellite/radar composite shows an elongated area of
showers/thunderstorms from northern MO east into western OH in
conjunction with an MCV moving east from IL into IN.  Additional
storm development along the composite front/trailing outflow
boundary is expected, but timing of this storm activity remains
unclear.  Nonetheless, differential heating along the baroclinic
zone will yield 2000 to 3000 J/kg MLCAPE amidst moderate effective
shear (25-35 kt).  A few clusters are forecast to eventually evolve
later this afternoon into the evening with the stronger storms
capable primarily of a wind-damage threat.

Mesoscale Discussion 1735
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0735 AM CDT Sun Jul 20 2025

Areas affected...Portions of far east-central IL into central IN

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 201235Z - 201430Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...A small complex of thunderstorms may pose a gradually
increasing threat for damaging winds over the next few hours. Watch
issuance is possible later this morning if this activity can
intensify.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms are ongoing this morning across parts of
central IL, aided by modest west-southwesterly low-level warm
advection and a low-amplitude mid-level perturbation. This
convection should continue to track generally east-southeastward
this morning across parts of central IN along an instability
gradient evident in latest mesoanalysis. While low/mid-level flow is
not overly strong, recent VWPs from KILX/KIND do show some
strengthening with height through mid levels. Resultant 25-30 kt of
effective bulk shear should continue to support some updraft
organization, with a recent supercell structure noted with a
thunderstorm near the IL/IN border. If a small bowing cluster can
become established as some recent high-resolution guidance suggests,
then a greater threat for scattered severe/damaging winds may be
realized across parts of central IN later this morning as the
boundary layer gradually destabilizes with filtered daytime heating.
While not immediately likely, Severe Thunderstorm Watch issuance may
eventually be needed if the ongoing activity can intensify.
