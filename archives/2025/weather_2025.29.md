Mesoscale Discussion 1773
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0308 PM CDT Thu Jul 24 2025

Areas affected...portions of eastern KS into northwest MO

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 242008Z - 242215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated strong wind gusts are possible the remainder of
the afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms have gradually increased in intensity
this afternoon amid a very moist and moderately unstable airmass.
Vertical shear will remain modest, with effective shear magnitude
only expected to be around 20 kt. Nevertheless, strong instability
and high PW values near 2 inches could support isolated wet
microbursts within this weakly sheared environment. North and east
extent of strong/severe potential may remain somewhat limited due to
early day convection and lingering cloud cover across northern MO.
Weak inhibition remains over this area and instability is somewhat
less. At this time, the overall threat appears limited/transient and
a severe thunderstorm watch is not currently expected.

Mesoscale Discussion 1772
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0241 PM CDT Thu Jul 24 2025

Areas affected...parts of eastern Wyoming and northern Colorado

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 241941Z - 242145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Storms may produce a few instance of large hail and a few
severe gusts across portions of eastern Wyoming and northern
Colorado. A watch is not anticipated.

DISCUSSION...Convection has developed along the mountains across
parts of eastern Wyoming and northern Colorado, where diurnal
inhibition has eroded. Farther east across the High Plains, some
inhibition remains for mixed-layer parcels, but additional heating
should continue to erode the MLCINH as the afternoon progresses.
Kinematically, the region is on the southern periphery of a modest
mid-level jet. This should provide sufficient shear for at least
transient supercells, and in some places low-level wind profiles
favor left-moving supercells. Given the long hodographs and steep
lapse rates with low freezing levels, some hail is possible with the
strongest storms. Shear decreases with southward extent, so this may
put a limit on the southern extent of the hail risk. With time,
storms may begin to cluster, and these clusters may also produce a
risk for severe gusts given the relatively dry boundary layer and
steep low-level lapse rates. Given the expected sparse coverage of
severe weather, a watch is not anticipated.

Mesoscale Discussion 1771
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0210 PM CDT Thu Jul 24 2025

Areas affected...portions of northern IL/IN into southern Lower MI

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 241910Z - 242115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated strong to severe wind gusts are possible this
afternoon into early evening across portions of northeast Illinois,
northern Indiana, and southern Lower Michigan.

DISCUSSION...Isolated thunderstorms are developing across northeast
IL as of 19z ahead of surface boundary moving slowly southeastward.
Ahead of the boundary and initial thunderstorm development, strong
heating into the low 90s, with dewpoints in the mid/upper 70s, is
resulting in a corridor of moderate/strong instability (MLCAPE up to
3000 J/kg). Deep shear will remain weak across the region, but
effective shear magnitudes around 20-30 kt may be sufficient for a
few organized cells/clusters. Modified RAP forecast soundings show
large instability, with steep low-level lapse rates from 7-8 C/km in
the 0-3 km layer. Given the very moist and strongly unstable
airmass, isolated downbursts producing strong to severe gusts are
possible through the afternoon into early evening. 

Some uncertainty remains regarding storm coverage, especially given
veering low-level flow, reducing convergence/lift along the surface
boundary. Nevertheless, any storm that does develop could produce
locally damaging gusts. A severe thunderstorm watch may be needed at
some point this afternoon.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0252 PM CDT Thu Jul 24 2025

Valid 242000Z - 251200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THERE IS A SLIGHT
RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS OF THE MIDWEST/GREAT
LAKES...

...SUMMARY...
Locally damaging thunderstorm wind gusts are possible from parts of
the Great Lakes to the central and southern Plains this afternoon
and evening. Isolated severe storms will also pose a risk of hail
and severe wind gusts over portions of the northern and central High
Plains.

...20z Update...
The previous forecast largely remains on track. Thunderstorm
development is underway across portions of northern IL, which should
intensify and track into northern IN and southern MI through the
evening hours. Severe hail/wind risk probabilities were reduced
across far northern lower MI due to the recent passage of deep
convection and an influx of cooler/lower theta-e air. See the
previous discussion below as well as MCDs #1771 and #1772 for
additional details.

..Moore.. 07/24/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1134 AM CDT Thu Jul 24 2025/

...Northern Lower Michigan...
Ahead of an MCV, a well-organized cluster of storms will pose at a
short-term severe risk across far northern Lower Michigan early this
afternoon, although there is some potential for additional
development southwestward along the front this afternoon.

...Midwest/Lake Michigan vicinity to south-central Plains...
Aside from an MCV nearing northern Lake Michigan, at least one
additional eastward-moving MCV exists across eastern Iowa, nearing
the southwest Wisconsin/northwest Illinois border vicinity as of
midday. Some multi-layer cloud debris still persists, and a
pre-frontal veering of winds (westerly component) has occurred in
some areas. However, heating of a very moist air mass (70s F surface
dewpoints) will lead to strong destabilization (2500-4000 J/kg
MLCAPE) and relatively weak boundary-layer inhibition this afternoon
near/ahead of the front. Most 12z global guidance/HREF members are
more aggressive in the coverage/intensity of convection than morning
HRRR/RRFS/MPAS runs, particularly for northern portions of
Illinois/Indiana into Lower Michigan.

Where deep convection does develop/sustain this afternoon, MCV-aided
enhancement of low/mid-tropospheric flow will support some
well-organized bands/clusters of storms with wind damage as the most
common severe risk across northern Missouri, northern portions of
Illinois/Indiana, into Lower Michigan. A more localized/pulse-type
severe risk is anticipated farther southwest into southern
Kansas/northwest Oklahoma.

...High Plains...
Moderate instability will develop across parts of the
northern/central High Plains this afternoon. Large-scale ascent will
tend to be weak behind a departing mid-level shortwave trough. Even
so, convective development should occur near the adjacent higher
terrain this afternoon. Effective shear of 25-40 kt will support
some updraft organization. Initially discrete cells may pose an
isolated threat for hail. Some outflow amalgamation/mergers could
eventually occur, with a threat of strong to locally severe gusts
spreading eastward into the evening before convection eventually
weakens. Farther south across portions of the southern High Plains,
scattered to numerous thunderstorms are also expected to develop
this afternoon/early evening. Deep-layer shear will remain weak
across this region, but localized strong to severe outflow gusts may
still be possible.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0233 PM CDT Thu Jul 24 2025

Valid 251200Z - 261200Z

...Update...
Only very subtle changes were made to the Isolated Dry Thunderstorm
area for Friday based on recent NWP trends. This included a slight
extension northeastward into far southwestern MT where fuels remain
receptive due to a lack of recent rainfall, and a slight extension
westward into far northern CA/Sierra where lower PWATs and expected
QPF may still support a mix of dry and wet thunderstorms. Please see
the previous discussion for additional details.

..Barnes.. 07/24/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1158 PM CDT Wed Jul 23 2025/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level low will continue inland on D2/Friday, with more widely
scattered thunderstorm activity continuing across portions of
northern California into the Pacific Northwest and northern Great
Basin. A mix of wet/dry thunderstorms will remain possible on the
periphery of the deeper moisture. As such, an area of Isolated Dry
Thunderstorm potential was maintained across the portions of the
Sierras in northern California into eastern Oregon, northern Nevada,
and central Idaho. Here, lower QPF amounts are forecast and fuels
remain receptive to fire spread.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0230 PM CDT Thu Jul 24 2025

Valid 261200Z - 271200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS SATURDAY THROUGH
SATURDAY NIGHT ACROSS PARTS OF THE MIDWEST INTO SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF
THE GREAT LAKES REGION...AND ACROSS PARTS OF THE NORTHERN ROCKIES
INTO THE DAKOTAS...

...SUMMARY...
Strong thunderstorms accompanied by potentially damaging wind gusts
are possible Saturday through Saturday night, across parts of the
Midwest into southern Great Lakes region and across parts of the
northern Rockies into the Dakotas.

...Midwest into southern Great Lakes region...
Along the northern periphery of an expansive midlevel anticyclone
centered on the Southeast, a convectively augmented midlevel impulse
will advance eastward from the Lower Missouri Valley into the
southern Great Lakes region. A related cluster of thunderstorms will
likely be ongoing at the start of the period, which should generally
track eastward along a weak warm frontal zone extending from the
Midwest through southern Great Lakes region. Diurnal
heating/destabilization along the southern fringes of this activity
may support an uptick in convective intensity through the afternoon
-- given the development of moderate-strong surface-based buoyancy
and around 30 kt of deep-layer shear. While the overall details
remain unclear, damaging winds will be possible with any stronger
storms that evolve.  

...Northern Rockies into the Dakotas...
Downstream of a broad large-scale trough over the West, guidance
indicates one or more embedded midlevel perturbations advancing
northeastward across the northern Rockies into the adjacent High
Plains during the day. This should aid in the development of widely
scattered high-based thunderstorms across the region from the
afternoon into the evening/overnight hours. Steep deep-layer lapse
rates and modestly enhanced midlevel southwesterly flow should
support some convective organization into clusters -- with a risk of
strong to severe wind gusts. While strong-extreme surface-based
buoyancy and sufficient deep-layer shear farther east into the Upper
Midwest will pose a conditional severe risk, substantial inhibition
at the base of an EML casts too much uncertainty to add severe
probabilities at this time.

1230 PM CDT Thu Jul 24 2025

Valid 251200Z - 261200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE NORTHEAST...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong to severe thunderstorms will pose a risk of
damaging wind gusts across parts of New England and the northern Mid
Atlantic on Friday. Isolated severe storms are also possible across
parts of the northern and central Plains.

...Northeast into the Northern Mid-Atlantic...
A robust midlevel trough will advance eastward across Quebec and
parts of New England through the day, while a related belt of 30-40
kt midlevel westerly flow overspreads the Northeast and northern
Mid-Atlantic. At the same time, a cold front will move southward
across the region through the afternoon. As widely scattered
thunderstorms along the front intercept a moist/destabilizing
pre-convective air mass (upwards of 2500 J/kg MLCAPE), around 30 kt
of effective shear will promote organized clusters, small line
segments, and possibly some supercell structures. The enhanced
low/midlevel flow, steepening boundary-layer lapse rates, and
expected clustering will support scattered wind damage across the
region. A Slight risk was added where confidence is highest in the
overlap of scattered organized storms, highest buoyancy, and
sufficient deep-layer flow/shear. 

...Northern Plains...
Within a belt of enhanced midlevel westerly flow, guidance indicates
a subtle/embedded midlevel perturbation moving into the northern
Plains during the afternoon. This should aid in diurnally driven
high-based thunderstorm development over the northern High Plains,
before spreading eastward into an increasingly moist/unstable air
mass. An elongated hodograph and steep deep-layer lapse
rates/moderate buoyancy will support a couple organized storms
initially capable or producing large hail and locally severe gusts.
As storms track eastward, upscale growth into an organized cluster
is possible -- aided by a strengthening low-level jet. A separate
area of thunderstorm development is possible farther east, where
warm advection and an enlarged/curved hodograph will support
damaging winds and possibly a brief tornado risk.

...Eastern KS...
Thunderstorms are expected ahead of a convectively augmented compact
wave moving east-northeastward across the central Plains. Pockets of
diurnal heating amid rich boundary-layer moisture and a
clockwise-curved hodograph will support a couple organized storms
including supercells. Damaging winds and perhaps a tornado will be
possible with the stronger storms that can evolve.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1134 AM CDT Thu Jul 24 2025

Valid 241630Z - 251200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS OF
THE MIDWEST/GREAT LAKES...

...SUMMARY...
Locally damaging thunderstorm wind gusts are possible from parts of
the Great Lakes to the central and southern Plains this afternoon
and evening. Isolated severe storms will also pose a risk of hail
and severe wind gusts over portions of the northern and central High
Plains.

...Northern Lower Michigan...
Ahead of an MCV, a well-organized cluster of storms will pose at a
short-term severe risk across far northern Lower Michigan early this
afternoon, although there is some potential for additional
development southwestward along the front this afternoon.

...Midwest/Lake Michigan vicinity to south-central Plains...
Aside from an MCV nearing northern Lake Michigan, at least one
additional eastward-moving MCV exists across eastern Iowa, nearing
the southwest Wisconsin/northwest Illinois border vicinity as of
midday. Some multi-layer cloud debris still persists, and a
pre-frontal veering of winds (westerly component) has occurred in
some areas. However, heating of a very moist air mass (70s F surface
dewpoints) will lead to strong destabilization (2500-4000 J/kg
MLCAPE) and relatively weak boundary-layer inhibition this afternoon
near/ahead of the front. Most 12z global guidance/HREF members are
more aggressive in the coverage/intensity of convection than morning
HRRR/RRFS/MPAS runs, particularly for northern portions of
Illinois/Indiana into Lower Michigan.

Where deep convection does develop/sustain this afternoon, MCV-aided
enhancement of low/mid-tropospheric flow will support some
well-organized bands/clusters of storms with wind damage as the most
common severe risk across northern Missouri, northern portions of
Illinois/Indiana, into Lower Michigan. A more localized/pulse-type
severe risk is anticipated farther southwest into southern
Kansas/northwest Oklahoma.

...High Plains...
Moderate instability will develop across parts of the
northern/central High Plains this afternoon. Large-scale ascent will
tend to be weak behind a departing mid-level shortwave trough. Even
so, convective development should occur near the adjacent higher
terrain this afternoon. Effective shear of 25-40 kt will support
some updraft organization. Initially discrete cells may pose an
isolated threat for hail. Some outflow amalgamation/mergers could
eventually occur, with a threat of strong to locally severe gusts
spreading eastward into the evening before convection eventually
weakens. Farther south across portions of the southern High Plains,
scattered to numerous thunderstorms are also expected to develop
this afternoon/early evening. Deep-layer shear will remain weak
across this region, but localized strong to severe outflow gusts may
still be possible.

1121 AM CDT Thu Jul 24 2025

Valid 241700Z - 251200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA...

...Update...
No changes were made to today's forecast. Expect increasing chances
of dry/wet lightning this afternoon into early this evening from
northern CA/southern OR, eastward into far western WY. Please see
the previous discussion for additional details.

..Barnes.. 07/24/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1149 PM CDT Wed Jul 23 2025/

...Synopsis...
A closed mid-level low will bring moisture in across portions of
northern California into the Pacific Northwest. A trough is expected
to dig into the Pacific Northwest, with increasing westerly flow
overspreading the Cascades. Some locally Elevated fire weather
concerns will be possible across the Cascade Gaps.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
An increase in shower and thunderstorm activity is expected across
portions of northern California and southern Oregon with the
increase in moisture and inland progression of the upper low. A mix
of wet/dry thunderstorms are expected a moisture increases through
the afternoon. 

Forecast soundings indicate the boundary layer conditions will be
initially very dry, though training storms will likely lead to
moistening through time. It is likely that localized areas of
wetting rainfall will occur, but productive lighting activity will
likely lead to strikes outside of the heavier cores. An area of
Scattered Dry Thunderstorms was maintained with this outlook, as
overall broad QPF amounts appear light and fuels remain critically
dry. A broader area of Isolated Dry Thunderstorm risk was reduced
across north-central California where PWs will be around 1.00". The
broader area extending into southern Oregon, Idaho and northern
Nevada was maintained.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0730 AM CDT Thu Jul 24 2025

Valid 241300Z - 251200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM PARTS OF
THE GREAT LAKES INTO THE MIDWEST...CENTRAL/SOUTHERN PLAINS...AND
HIGH PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Locally damaging thunderstorm wind gusts will be possible from parts
of the Great Lakes to the central and southern Plains, mainly this
afternoon and evening. Isolated severe storms will also pose a risk
of hail and severe wind gusts over portions of the northern and
central High Plains.

...Synopsis...
Modestly enhanced westerly mid-level flow will be maintained today
between an upper trough progressing slowly eastward over central
Canada and the north-central CONUS, and upper ridging across the
Southeast and Mid-Atlantic. Multiple mid-level MCVs evident on
satellite and radar should move generally east-northeastward across
parts of the Midwest and Great Lakes today. At the surface, a
convectively reinforced front will be draped from Ontario/Quebec
southwestward to the southern Plains. This front will likely serve
as a focused for additional scattered to numerous thunderstorms this
afternoon and evening, some of which could become strong to severe
on an isolated basis.

...Great Lakes into the Midwest and Central/Southern Plains...
A moist and rather unstable airmass will exist along/ahead of the
front today, as diurnal heating aids in the gradual steepening of
low-level lapse rates. Stronger mid-level flow and related
deep-layer shear should be present across parts of MI and vicinity.
Some enhancement to the low/mid-level winds and modest ascent
associated with an MCV over northeast WI this morning may also aid
in thunderstorm development and organization downstream into parts
of northern Lower MI by early afternoon. This area appears to have
the best combination of forecast instability and shear, and any
thunderstorms which can form here could become severe while posing a
threat for both isolated hail and damaging winds. However, low-level
flow along/near the front is generally expected to remain veered to
southwesterly, which should limit low-level convergence to some
extent. Therefore, confidence in overall coverage of severe
convection remains too low to include greater severe probabilities
across northern Lower MI at this time.

Mid-level flow and effective bulk shear values will decrease with
southward extent across the Midwest into the southern Plains, away
from any remnant MCV influences. This should tend to limit updraft
organization with thunderstorms that develop this afternoon across
these regions. Still, some potential should exist for loosely
organized clusters given the linear low-level forcing. And with
steep low-level lapse rates and moderate to strong instability, some
of this convection may be capable of producing strong to locally
severe winds through the early evening hours before eventually
weakening with the loss of daytime heating.

...High Plains...
Moderate instability should develop across parts of the
northern/central High Plains this afternoon. Large-scale ascent will
be weak behind a departing mid-level shortwave trough. Even so,
convective development should occur near the adjacent higher terrain
this afternoon. Effective shear of 25-40 kt will support some
updraft organization. Initially discrete cells may pose an isolated
threat for hail. Some outflow amalgamation/mergers could eventually
occur, with a threat of strong to locally severe gusts spreading
eastward into the evening before convection eventually weakens.
Farther south across portions of the southern High Plains, scattered
to numerous thunderstorms are also expected to develop this
afternoon/early evening. Deep-layer shear will remain weak across
this region, but localized strong to severe outflow gusts may still
be possible.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0358 AM CDT Thu Jul 24 2025

Valid 271200Z - 011200Z

...DISCUSSION...
Models indicate substantive amplification within an initially zonal
belt of westerlies across the northern mid-latitude Pacific during
the coming days, with several embedded closed lows evolving,
including one by the beginning of the period across the northeastern
Pacific, on the leading edge of an increasingly blocked regime. 
Downstream, as another significant low, emerging from the Arctic
latitudes, turns across the eastern Northwest Territories into and
through Hudson Bay, mid/upper ridging is forecast to build through
much of the Canadian Prairies.  Gradually, models indicate that
amplified ridging will encompass much of interior North America,
across and east of the Rockies through the mid to latter portions of
next week, while amplified troughing evolves further downstream,
across the eastern Canadian provinces, the Great Lakes and
Northeast.

The evolution of this regime appears likely to be accompanied by a
plume of steepening mid-level lapse rates overspreading the northern
U.S. Great Plains and adjacent portions of southern Canada, toward
the Upper Midwest/Great Lakes, during the early to middle portion of
next week, before becoming suppressed southwestward.  Aided by the
return of seasonably high boundary layer moisture content to areas
near and northeast of the lower through middle Missouri Valley, it
appears that this will contribute to a broad area of moderate to
large potential instability.  

This environment may become conditionally supportive of the
evolution of longer-lived organized thunderstorm clusters, with
potential to produce swaths of damaging wind gusts across parts of
the northern Great Plains, Upper Midwest and Great Lakes into the
Ohio Valley and perhaps parts of the Northeast.  However, prior to
more substantive mid/upper trough amplification, and the southward
advancement of a cold front into much of the northeastern U.S. by
the middle of next week, the evolution of any such cluster, south of
the international border, will likely largely depend on subtle short
wave perturbations progressing through the larger scale ridging. 
Given the low predictability of these features at this extended
range, and the uncertain impacts of their associated convection and
outflow on subsequent destabilization, severe probabilities remain
low due to the uncertainties.

Mesoscale Discussion 1764
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0343 PM CDT Wed Jul 23 2025

Areas affected...parts of northeastern Colorado...southeast
Wyoming...and far western Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 232043Z - 232245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Storms may produce a few severe gusts and some marginally
severe hail across parts of northeastern Colorado, southeast
Wyoming, and far western Nebraska this afternoon. A watch is not
anticipated.

DISCUSSION...Mid-level clouds from morning convection have been slow
to clear portions of northeastern Colorado, and so heating has been
delayed, which has led to some residual inhibition. Despite this, a
narrow corridor of heating along the mountains has allowed storms to
percolate along the Front Range this afternoon in a post-frontal
upslope flow regime. These storms are well south of the strongest
mid-level flow, and therefore deep-layer shear is relatively weak.
Because of this, multicell clusters are expected to be the dominant
storm mode. In addition, the environment has some mid-level dry air
and steep lapse rates, which may lead to a threat for severe gusts
with the strongest clusters. Some hail is possible with these storms
given low freezing levels, but the lack of deep-layer shear and the
multicell storm mode may limit the severe hail risk with these
storms.

Areas affected...portions of southeast MN into north-central WI

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 231954Z - 232200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Intensifying thunderstorms may pose a risk of damaging
wind gusts across southeast Minnesota into portions of
northern/central Wisconsin the next few hours. Area is being
monitored for possible watch issuance.

DISCUSSION...Isolated to scattered thunderstorms are
developing/intensifying this afternoon along/just ahead of the
southward-advancing cold front. This activity is tracking along a
differential heating zone and within the strong instability gradient
oriented across north-central WI. Strong heating ahead of these
storms and dewpoints in the mid 70s have allowed inhibition to
weaken. This area is on the edges of more favorable deep shear, but
20-30 kt effective shear magnitudes may be sufficient for organized
clusters/small bows given strong instability. Modified RAP forecast
soundings and regional VWP data show somewhat small but favorably
curved low-level hodographs. Low-level shear will remain modest, but
given the very moist and unstable boundary layer, a tornado or two
also could occur, in addition to damaging wind gusts. This area is
being monitored for possible watch issuance.

Areas affected...parts of eastern Wyoming...southeastern Montana.

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 231911Z - 232115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Storms with a risk of large hail and severe gusts are
possible this afternoon across portions of eastern Wyoming,
southeastern Montana, western South Dakota, and northwestern
Nebraska. A watch may be needed to cover this threat.

DISCUSSION...Storms are developing in a post-frontal upslope flow
regime in northern and eastern Wyoming. These storms are situated on
the southern periphery of a modest mid-level jet. This flow should
provide sufficient deep-layer shear for a supercell storm mode, and
given the relatively straight hodographs and lower freezing levels,
some severe hail is possible initially with these storms. The
deep-layer shear decreases markedly with southward extent, so this
may put a limit on the southern extent of the hail risk.

Given relatively high boundary layer humidity, cold pools may be
weaker, and therefore upscale growth may be slow to occur. However,
some clustering of storms is expected with time. This would
transition the primary threat to severe gusts given the relatively
steep low-level lapse rates and modest flow aloft on the regional
RAP short-term forecast profiles.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 538
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
135 PM MDT Wed Jul 23 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Western South Dakota
  Central into Northeast Wyoming

* Effective this Wednesday afternoon and evening from 135 PM
  until 800 PM MDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
    inches in diameter possible
  Isolated damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Widely scattered to scattered thunderstorms are forecast
to develop this afternoon.  The stronger storms will likely become
supercells and pose a risk for large hail (1 to 2 inches in
diameter).  Isolated severe gusts (60-70 mph) are possible with
supercells and with storms that may congeal into a linear cluster
towards the evening.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 90
statute miles east and west of a line from 50 miles north northeast
of Gillette WY to 30 miles east southeast of Douglas WY. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU8).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 450. Mean storm motion vector
27020.

Mesoscale Discussion 1759
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0728 AM CDT Wed Jul 23 2025

Areas affected...eastern SD and western MN

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 231228Z - 231400Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Sporadic severe gusts may persist this morning with
multiple messy clusters across eastern South Dakota. Watch issuance
in the near-term is uncertain with increasing likelihood towards
midday.

DISCUSSION...A small but persistent cluster that has produced a
focused swath of measured severe gusts across southwest into central
SD has weakened in terms of reflectivity structure and IR cloud top
warming. The downstream front has oscillated southward, suggesting
that this cluster will persist to the cool side of this front and
likely impinge on weak downstream convection towards the SD/ND/MN
border area. Meanwhile, a west/east-oriented convective band
emanating northward across southern SD has produced a couple
measured severe gusts at mesonet sites. This convection will
probably evolve more northeastward into late morning and could also
congeal with the post-frontal convection to the north. Overall messy
and complex convective mode, along with the time of day, suggests
that severe potential may remain sporadic and disorganized. More
positive cold pool merging could occur into western MN towards

for mainly scattered severe/damaging winds as they spread generally
eastward through the rest of the morning into the early afternoon.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 50
statute miles north and south of a line from 70 miles west southwest
of Aberdeen SD to 50 miles northeast of Watertown SD. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU7).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1 inch. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 65 knots. A few
cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 550. Mean storm motion vector
27035.

Mesoscale Discussion 1756
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0319 PM CDT Tue Jul 22 2025

Areas affected...portions of southeast North Dakota and northeast
South Dakota

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 222019Z - 222215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Strong to severe thunderstorms are possible into early
evening. Hail and strong gusts may occur with stronger storms.

DISCUSSION...Scattered thunderstorms have developed this afternoon
within the post-outflow airmass. While early day convection and
cloud cover have impacted the airmass to some degree, some recovery
is apparent as temperatures have warmed into the upper 70s to low
80s and dewpoints have been maintained in the upper 60s to low 70s.
As a result, capping is eroding, and MLCAPE has increased to
1000-2000 J/kg. Ongoing storms may be somewhat elevated initially,
but could become surface-based with time. Effective shear magnitudes
greater than 40 kt and steep midlevel lapse rates suggests robust
updrafts supporting isolated large hail and strong/severe gusts will
be possible. Given the influence of outflow and modification of the
airmass from morning convection, convective evolution remains
somewhat uncertain. Portions of the area may eventually need a
severe thunderstorm watch, but timing and location is uncertain.

Mesoscale Discussion 1755
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0300 PM CDT Tue Jul 22 2025

Areas affected...northern WY into southeast MT

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 222000Z - 222200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms are possible
across parts of southern Montana and northern Wyoming this afternoon
and evening.

DISCUSSION...Occasionally robust thunderstorms have developed over
higher terrain in portions of southern MT and northern WY. Weak
inhibition remains downstream over the adjacent high Plains, but
additional heating and increasing ascent should allow for storms to
become sustained further from the terrain with time into late
afternoon. Regional VWP data shows elongated, straight hodographs
amid steep midlevel lapse rates. While instability is muted due to
the drier, post-frontal low-level airmass, MLCAPE will still be
sufficient to sustain updrafts. Isolated strong to severe
thunderstorms posing a risk for hail (possibly up to 2 inches,
especially over far southeast MT) will be possible over the next
several hours. Trends will be monitored and a severe thunderstorm
watch may be needed for parts of the discussion area later this
afternoon.

Mesoscale Discussion 1738
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0241 PM CDT Sun Jul 20 2025

Areas affected...south-central South Dakota across western Nebraska
and toward northwest Kansas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 201941Z - 202215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered severe storms appear likely later this afternoon
from south-central SD across west-central NE and toward northwest
KS. A few cells may produce large hail, with locally damaging gusts.
A tornado is possible over southern SD into far northern NE after
23Z. A portion of the area may require a watch.

DISCUSSION...Surface map shows low pressure extending from southwest
SD across western NE and into the CO/KS border area, with strong
heating. This trough will continue to deepen, and sufficient
convergence within the uncapped air mass should allow for widely
scattered storms to develop late this afternoon.

Of particular note is the warm front area which currently curls
northwestward out of northern NE and into south-central SD. Here,
heating is occurring on the cool side of the boundary, where
dewpoints remain above 70 F and low-level shear is enhanced. Any
supercell that develops here, most likely after 23Z, could be
tornadic at times, and produce very large hail as it proceeds
southeastward, aided by a modest evening low-level jet.

Farther south into the deeper/heated air mass, higher based storms
are expected, and overall shear is weaker as well. However, steep
lapse rates will favor locally severe gusts, and even some hail in
the early and robust formation stages.

Mesoscale Discussion 1737
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0135 PM CDT Sun Jul 20 2025

Areas affected...southern Indiana and Ohio...northern Kentucky

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 201835Z - 202130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A few strong storms producing locally damaging gusts
cannot be ruled out later this afternoon from southern Indiana
across southern Ohio and northeast Kentucky.

DISCUSSION...An MCV continues to move rapidly eastward across
northern IN, well north of a stalled front draped across southern
IL/IN and southwest OH. Meanwhile, a very moist air mass remains
near this boundary, with heating occurring upstream across the Mid
MS and OH Valleys.

While the entire warm sector is unstable, areas near the front exist
beneath slightly stronger deep-layer mean winds, on the southern
periphery of the larger scale trough (and MCV) influence.

Visible imagery show increasing CU fields from southern IN into
northern and eastern KY, and scattered storms are likely within this
zone. Locally strong downbursts will be possible, but any more
substantial wind threat would be conditional on a large cluster of
storms producing outflow, and tracking east/southeast near the
boundary. At this time, it appears a watch will not be necessary.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 530
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
410 PM EDT Sun Jul 20 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Connecticut
  Massachusetts
  Far Southern Maine
  Southern New Hampshire
  Rhode Island
  Southern Vermont
  Coastal Waters

* Effective this Sunday afternoon and evening from 410 PM until
  900 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 65 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1 inch in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Scattered thunderstorms are forecast to continue to
develop and intensify and pose primarily a threat for strong to
severe gusts (55-65 mph).  Isolated large hail may accompany the
stronger cells.  This activity will likely reach the coast by the
mid evening.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 80
statute miles north and south of a line from 30 miles east northeast
of Boston MA to 25 miles south southwest of Pittsfield MA. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU0).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1 inch. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 55 knots. A few
cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 400. Mean storm motion vector
28025.

Mesoscale Discussion 1735
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0735 AM CDT Sun Jul 20 2025

Areas affected...Portions of far east-central IL into central IN

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 201235Z - 201430Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...A small complex of thunderstorms may pose a gradually
increasing threat for damaging winds over the next few hours. Watch
issuance is possible later this morning if this activity can
intensify.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms are ongoing this morning across parts of
central IL, aided by modest west-southwesterly low-level warm
advection and a low-amplitude mid-level perturbation. This
convection should continue to track generally east-southeastward
this morning across parts of central IN along an instability
gradient evident in latest mesoanalysis. While low/mid-level flow is
not overly strong, recent VWPs from KILX/KIND do show some
strengthening with height through mid levels. Resultant 25-30 kt of
effective bulk shear should continue to support some updraft
organization, with a recent supercell structure noted with a
thunderstorm near the IL/IN border. If a small bowing cluster can
become established as some recent high-resolution guidance suggests,
then a greater threat for scattered severe/damaging winds may be
realized across parts of central IN later this morning as the
boundary layer gradually destabilizes with filtered daytime heating.
While not immediately likely, Severe Thunderstorm Watch issuance may
eventually be needed if the ongoing activity can intensify.
