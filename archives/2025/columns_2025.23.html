<h2 id="democratic-resurrection-plan">Democratic resurrection plan</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-13, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/07/04/butHerEmails.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Having
a
<a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/01/152316.html?title=whatWouldCuomoDo">Democrat</a>
rise from the ashes of
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=metoo">metoo</a> is just
what the doctor ordered. It could cure the revulsion some voters feel
for Democratic wokeness.
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=cuomo">Cuomo</a> was
never tried or convicted of any crime, or voted out of office by the
state assembly or senate in Albany. Or the people of the State of New
York. Al Franken wasn’t allowed to have his case adjudicated by a
committee of Congress. Both were pushed from office by journalism, which
imho needs to be put in their place, they’ve been sloshing into lanes
they weren’t elected to. Let me try to make this clear. Journalism’s
role is to inform us of events. Once informed, it’s their responsibility
to stop. Anything past that is campaigning, not news. Step back and let
the process run its course. Ultimately it’s the people who will decide.
Now, if Cuomo wins, this is the best outcome possible because the NYT et
al will complain endlessly about how the Democrats just elected someone
who they <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gi9zFRBCIM">don’t
approve of</a>. This will probably get the Dems more votes in coming
elections, because there are a lot of people who legitimately are
disgusted by the NYT trying to run the show. If you want to govern, run
for office. If you want to be a journalist, know when it’s time to shut
up.
</p>
<p>
BTW isn’t it amazing that when you say something counter to Democratic
dogma, their first impulse is to try to destroy you? If the Dems were a
healthy political party and not a religion, their first impulse would be
to try to work with you not destroy you.
</p>
<p>
“Who me?” asks the Democrat. Yes, you.
</p>
<p>
You’ll know who the next leader of the Democratic Party is because they
will be campaigning against the Democratic Party. Talking about things
that actually happened rather than the hallucinations the Trumpies
indulge in.

Paragon is an Israeli spyware company, increasingly in the news (now
that NSO Group seems to be waning). “Graphite” is the name of its
product. Citizen Lab
<a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2025/06/first-forensic-confirmation-of-paragons-ios-mercenary-spyware-finds-journalists-targeted/">caught
it</a> spying on multiple European journalists with a zero-click iOS
exploit:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
On April 29, 2025, a select group of iOS users were notified by Apple
that they were targeted with advanced spyware. Among the group were two
journalists that consented for the technical analysis of their cases.
The key findings from our forensic analysis of their devices are
summarized below:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Our analysis finds forensic evidence confirming with high confidence
that both a prominent European journalist (who requests anonymity), and
Italian journalist Ciro Pellegrino, were targeted with Paragon’s
Graphite mercenary spyware. …

American Airlines, and United, collected U.S. travellers’ domestic
flight records, sold access to them to Customs and Border Protection
(CBP), and then as part of the contract told CBP to not reveal where the
data came from, according to internal CBP documents obtained by 404

The rise of the technology industry over the last few decades has been
powered by its very strong
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Increasing-Returns-Dependence-Economics-Cognition/dp/0472064967">economies
of scale</a>. Once you have invested in developing and deploying a
technology, the benefit of adding each additional customer greatly
exceeds the additional cost of doing so. This led to the concept of
“<a href="https://hbr.org/2016/04/blitzscaling">blitzscaling</a>”, that
it makes sense to delay actually making a profit and devote these
benefits to <i>adding more customers</i>. That way you follow the
example of Amazon and Uber on the path to a monopoly laid out by Brian
Arthur’s
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Increasing-Returns-Dependence-Economics-Cognition/dp/0472064967"><i>Increasing
Returns and Path Dependence in the Economy</i></a>. Eventually you can
extract monopoly rents and make excess profits, but in the meantime
blitzscale believers will pump your stock price.<br /> <br /> This is
what the VCs behind OpenAI and Anthropic are doing, and what Google,
Microsoft and Oracle are trying to emulate. Is it going to work? Below
the fold I report on some back-of-the-envelope calculations, which I did
without using

that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Microsoft is forecast to spend $80 <i>billion</i> on AI in 2025.
</blockquote>
Lets try to figure out the return on this investment. We will assume
that the $80B is split two ways, $40B to Nvidia for hardware and $40B on
building data centers to put it in. Depreciating the $40B of hardware
over five years is very optimistic, it is likely to be
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/22/24162860/nvidia-ai-chip-every-year-blackwell-rubin">uneconomic
to run after 2-3 years</a>. But that’s what we’ll do. So that is minus
$8B/year on the bottom line over the next five years. Similarly,
depreciating the data centers over 20 years is likely optimistic, given
the rate at which
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joule.2025.101961">AI power demand is
increasing</a>. But that’s what we’ll do, giving another minus $2B/year
on the bottom line.<br /> <br /> Microsoft could argue that some of the
$80B is the cost of training the models. But since the models will
depreciate even faster than the hardware used to train them, this
doesn’t make things look better.<br /> <br /> Microsoft’s gross margin
for cloud services is
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2024-Q4/performance">about
70%</a>, so they will be expecting this $10B/year cost to generate
$33B/year in revenue, or about 13% of Microsoft’s total. Of course,
there will be some ramp up in the revenue, but Microsoft is planning to
keep investing, so next year’s investment will need to generate a return
too. We will thus ignore the ramp.<br /> <br />

<a href="https://www.perspectives.plus/p/microsofts-non-profit-ai-adventures">notes
that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Microsoft is today promoting the pay-as-you-go pricing model of Copilot
Studio as the preferred sales motion. The list price of one message is
$0.01. While enterprise clients may get discounts, there’s also the
chance of prepaid message capacity being unused, so things may even out.
With this price point, Copilot Studio usage generates $2.5M revenue per
month, and $30M per year.
</blockquote>
So Microsoft is processing about 30B messages/year. It needs adoption to
be so fast that next year’s revenue will be around <i>1,100 times</i>
its current rate. They will need next year’s customers to generate about
330T messages/year.<br /> <br /> How is adoption going? Jukka Niiranen
<a href="https://www.perspectives.plus/p/microsofts-non-profit-ai-adventures">notes
that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
160k organizations using Copilot, this translates to around 1.5K
messages per org per month. Or 52 messages per day. Now, we have to
remember that one action in a Copilot Studio agent often consumes more
than one message. …<br /> <br /> If those 52 messages were only about
regular GenAI usage without any business process logic, that would mean
26 responses from Copilot Studio agents per day. If they were to include
things like agent actions (meaning, AI does something more than just
chatting back at you) or AI tools, we’re quickly at a point where the
average Copilot Studio customer organization does a couple of agent runs
per day.<br /> <br /> <b>This is shockingly low</b>. It is plain and
obvious that most customers are merely experimenting with trying to
build agents. Hardly anyone is running it in production yet. Which
wouldn’t be that bad if this was a new 2025 product. But Copilot Studio
has been out since November 2023.
</blockquote>
The back of my envelope says that Microsoft’s AI business needs to grow
customers like no business (even OpenAI) has ever grown customers if it
is not to be a huge drag on the bottom line.<br /> <br /> If this were a
traditional technology business with very strong economies of scale
growing customers incredibly fast would be good, because the incremental
revenue from each new customer vastly outweighs the incremental cost of
supporting them. This is where Microsoft’s 70% gross margin comes
from.<br /> <br /> OpenAI lost $5B on $4B in revenue, so each $1 of
revenue cost them $2.25. Ed Zitron had a
<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/oai-business/">more detailed
estimate</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
To be abundantly clear, as it stands, OpenAI currently spends $2.35 to
make $1.
</blockquote>
Lets assume Microsoft is doing better, with each $1 in revenue costing
$1.50. But, as James O’Donnell and Casey Crownhart report in
<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/20/1116327/ai-energy-usage-climate-footprint-big-tech/"><i>We
did the math on AI’s energy footprint. Here’s the story you haven’t
heard.</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
As conversations with experts and AI companies made clear, inference,
not training, represents an increasing majority of AI’s energy demands
and will continue to do so in the near future. It’s now estimated that
80–90% of computing power for AI is used for inference.
</blockquote>
<p>If we assume unrealistically that training is a one-time cost and
they don’t need to retrain for next year, training cost them say 15% of
$45M, or about $6.75M and answering the 30B messages cost them $38.25M.
Scaling up by a factor of 1,100 means answering the messages would cost
them $42B plus the $10B depreciation, so $52B. But it would only
generate $33B in revenue, so each $1 of revenue would cost about $1.58.
Scaling up would make the losses worse.<br /> <br /> There are only two
possibilities. Either inference gets at least an order of magnitude
cheaper than training instead of around 6 times more expensive, or the
price of using AI goes up by at least an order of magnitude. Now you see
why Sam Altman <i>et al</i> are so desperate to run the “drug-dealer’s
algorithm” (<i>the first one’s free</i>) and get the world hooked on
this drug so they can supply a world of addicts.<br /> <br /></p>

<h2 id="democrats-and-men">Democrats and men</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-12, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Yesterday I posted a link to my
<a href="https://this.how/davewiner/politics.opml">political
disclaimer</a> from 2018. Also listened to a
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/archive/2025/06/david-frum-show-trumps-plot-against-the-2026-elections/683107/">podcast
interview</a> with Senator Gallego of Arizona who says, correctly, that
the Democrats have work to do with men. It’s true, speaking as a man who
has been voting solid Democratic since Kerry, but I didn’t stop being a
man, which is something that makes me cringe to say it, the way I
cringed at admitting to being Jewish when I was a kid. I lived in a
place where hate of Jews was always just under the surface in school,
but not so well hidden at the playground.
</p>
<p>
Men as a gender were really pushed into a corner we couldn’t get out of
during #metoo, all men, not just some. If they say they weren’t they’re
lying. I went to a future of journalism conference in 2018, and the only
thing men talked about, quietly, among ourselves, was how scared we were
of losing everything. It really was bad, but since then it’s eased.
</p>
<p>
I wrote about #metoo in my
<a href="https://this.how/davewiner/politics.opml#1520013967000">political
disclaimer</a>, but didn’t promote it for fear of retribution. I was
threatened when I stood up for a friend whose life was ruined for as far
as I could tell doing nothing wrong. If you don’t shut up we’ll do you
too, basically.
</p>
<p>
Women are people just like men, and when they got to rage online against
men, even people I thought I knew and were friends behaved abhorently.
The way we imagine Trump might deal with us soon.
</p>
<p>
I have to add not all women, there were some who didn’t forget that
their male friends were still friends.
</p>
<p>
It was very clear where the Democratic Party came down on all this, and
of course, the Republicans took total advantage of this. If you want to
understand the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manosphere">manosphere</a> as you
all call it, start here. I vote with you all, but absolutely abhor the
way you pushed us all into a corner and shut down our pride. Women are
people too and they can be just as ugly as men. If you believe otherwise
you’re believing lies. I speak from experience, I was raised to believe
all women are saints. That lie did not prepare us well for life.
</p>
<p>
The good news is if the Democrats can make peace with men, there are a
lot more votes available to us. We can put it behind us, but we can’t
ignore that in the late teens we went absolutely fucking batshit crazy
about half of the electorate. It’s amazing the whole thing didn’t
completely crumble, irrevocably. We can still fix it, but we have to
acknowledge that men were hurt in that period. You all seem to have
forgotten that we are just people too.
</p>
<p>
PS: Re-reading the #metoo section of the disclaimer I can’t believe how
I tiptoed around the truth. The truth I didn’t dare say was it was a
huge hate campaign as divisive as anything the Repubs ever did. In a
country that was supposed to outlaw this, and from a political party
that was supposed to be liberal. The “both sides do it” reality probably
hasn’t yet sunk in but the Democrats sided with sadists and fascists. No
other way to put it. Men absolutely were silenced. Afraid to speak for
fear of retribution. If you were on the wrong side of this you have some
soul-searching to do. And you probably pushed a lot of people of all
genders into voting for Trump. The Dems posture of “who me?” has an
answer – yes you.

<p>I was lucky to grow up in NYC, and had to commute from Queens to the
Bronx every day to go to school. Some days I took the

to the

or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_(New_York_City_Subway_service)">D
trains</a> up to 205th St in the Bronx. Took the same amount of time
either way. So at age 15 I was able to go see the Grateful Dead after
school at the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fillmore_East">Fillmore East</a>
on April 27, 1971. Midway through the set, a special guest band who they
didn’t introduce started tuning up on stage. We all wondered who they
were. I now know the history thanks to the
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=500+Songs+podcast+beach+boys">500

and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNEW-FM#%22Where_Rock_Lives%22">WNEW-FM</a>.
When they started playing one of their biggest hits,

<a href="https://youtu.be/kRKY-S4wI1s?si=zTwSE5tvk6LKNjjb&t=2348">points</a>

<h2 id="alt-text-on-this-blog">2025-05-27 Alt text on this blog</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-12, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2025-05-27-alt-text-on-this-blog">
2025-05-27 Alt text on this blog
</h1>
<p>
On the web, the alt text is a description of an image to be shown by
browsers when the image cannot be shown – like text browsers or screen
readers. So what about alt text on this blog? What about blog posts full
of photos, specifically? Like the <a href="Croatia">Croatia</a> posts.
</p>
<p>
I think that alt text should be unnecessary on my blog because the text
should carry the entire message. “Welcome to my
<a href="Wall_of_Text">Wall of Text</a>!” 😄
</p>
<p>
On fedi, I like alt text and I both read and write it. I hate clients
that don’t display it. I want to always read it. Therefore, on my blog,
the equivalent of alt text should always be readable. But real alt text
isn’t shown to me – the browser is showing me the pictures, instead. It
makes sense. And on fedi it only works because the applications and
front-ends don’t just use the alt text attribute for images in HTML –
they have an extra user-interface to allow me to read it. Buttons,
mouse-over, long-press, whatever it takes.
</p>
<p>
There are options for this blog, of course. Except I don’t like these
options.
</p>
<p>
I could reuse the alt text as the image title attribute which is shown
on mouse-over by default. I don’t like being forced to use mouse and I
don’t like duplicating the description.
</p>
<p>
In Markdown:
</p>
<pre><code>![alt text](url &quot;title&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>
I could automatically use the alt text as the title attribute but I
still don’t like to use the mouse to read the title attribute and I
wouldn’t be able to switch Markdown rendering engines as easily if I
hack it. Writing some Javascript to produce extra pop-ups or some other
user-interface element would be even worse, and it would need extra
clicking or keyboard navigation as a reader. No way.
</p>
<p>
The last option is the best. Just write the description above the image:
</p>
<pre><code>Description

![](url)
</code></pre>
<p>
I’ve tried using the title attribute for some of my recent picture-heavy
blog posts about Croatia and I’ve been checking the result using Gemini
and Gopher, and I’m not happy.
</p>
<p>
Compare the following two with the
<a href="https://alexschroeder.ch/view/2025-05-17-%C5%A1ibenik">web</a>
version where I can’t read the alt text. (Screenshots from
<a href="https://gmi.skyjake.fi/lagrange/">Lagrange</a> on my phone.)
</p>
<p>
The <a href="gemini://alexschroeder.ch/2025-05-17-šibenik">Gemini</a>
version looks OK with some text paragraphs being links to the images.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-1.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
The <a href="gopher://alexschroeder.ch/02025-05-17-šibenik">Gopher</a>
version shows the alt texts as weird disjointed text paragraphs that
sometimes repeat the preceding paragraph and sometimes don’t.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-2.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
I guess I could write longer alt texts until the Gopher version looks
good but then the Gemini version looks weird and the web version
continues to not show it.
</p>
<p>
Now check the Gemini and Gopher output for the page you’re reading right
now!
</p>
<p>
The <a href="gopher://alexschroeder.ch/02025-05-27-alt-text">Gopher</a>
version is OK. The line-breaks don’t look nice on the phone at the
default resolution so ignore that weird line-break. What we can see is
that the empty alt text generated an empty paragraph. Something I should
fix. 😅 But in general, it looks OK and reads well.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-3.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
The <a href="gemini://alexschroeder.ch/2025-05-27-alt-text">Gemini</a>
version still looks OK. It also links to the Gopher and Gemini versions,
so ignore those extra links. 😅 The browser substitutes the filenames
for the missing alt text. That works for me. I’m not sure what a screen
reader would do. Probably say: “Image. 2025-05-27-alt-text-3.jpg”? And
I’m not sure what a person with bad sight would prefer. At this point
I’d know that I can skip the image since I have already read the
description above.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-4.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
And here’s the same passage a day later, using the text browser
<code>lynx</code>. The inline links look good, and there’s no trace of
the screenshots. This is great! It’s as readable as the Gopher version
with no extra line-breaks, and the inline links are inline (unlike in
the Gemini version).
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-5.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Checking with <code>edbrowse</code>. The inline links are wrapped in
bracers, which looks good, and the images with no alt text are shown as
empty square brackets (<code>[]</code>) which works for me. Ideally, I
guess, they’d just disappear.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-6.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
All in all, I think this solution is better: Instead of alt text, just
write more text above each image.
</p>
<p>
What I’m less sure about is whether this automatically implies that all
images are “decorative” and therefore should have an empty alt text
(instead of no alt text). It seems to me that the filename being shown
is a lot of visual clutter, but that only seems to affect Gemini, not
the text browser.
</p>

<strong>2025-05-29</strong>. I fixed that minor issue in
<a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/markdown-gopher.git/">markdown-gopher</a>
so that it skips paragraphs containing just images with no alt text. 😄
</p>
<p>
<strong>2025-05-31</strong>. I added a piece of Javascript to copy the
alt text to the title attribute if the alt text is set and the title is
not. Perhaps that’ll motivate me to add more alt text.
</p>
<p>
This is what I added to my <code>view.html</code> template for
<a href="Odd%CE%BC">Oddμ</a>:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
function addTitle() {
  const images = document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;img&quot;);
  for (let img of images) {
    const alt = img.getAttribute(&quot;alt&quot;);
    const title = img.getAttribute(&quot;title&quot;);
    if (alt != null &amp;&amp; title == null) {
      img.setAttribute(&quot;title&quot;, alt);
    }
  }
}
window.addEventListener('load', addTitle);
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
<strong>2025-06-09</strong>. Tweaked the JavaScript. I’m now replacing
the <code>img</code> element with a <code>figure</code> element, moving
the <code>img</code> element into the <code>figure</code> and adding a
<code>figcaption</code> element. The caption is rendered smaller and
italic via CSS.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-7.jpg" alt="Example" />
</p>
<p>
Code:
</p>
<pre><code>function addTitle() {
  const images = document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;img&quot;);
  for (let img of images) {
    const parent = img.parentNode;
    const figure = document.createElement(&quot;figure&quot;);
    const figCaption = document.createElement(&quot;figcaption&quot;);
    parent.replaceChild(figure, img);
    figure.append(img);
    figure.append(figCaption);
    const alt = img.getAttribute(&quot;alt&quot;);
    const title = img.getAttribute(&quot;title&quot;);
    figCaption.textContent = alt;
    if (alt != null &amp;&amp; title == null) {
      img.setAttribute(&quot;title&quot;, alt);
    }
  }
}
window.addEventListener('load', addTitle);
</code></pre>
<p>
<strong>2025-06-12</strong>. More fiddling. No figure and figure caption
for inline images such as the RSS icon.
</p>
<p>
Code:
</p>
<pre><code>function addTitle() {
  const images = document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;img&quot;);
  for (let img of images) {
    const alt = img.getAttribute(&quot;alt&quot;);
    const title = img.getAttribute(&quot;title&quot;);
    if (alt != null &amp;&amp; title == null) {
      img.setAttribute(&quot;title&quot;, alt);
    }
    if ((!img.previousElementSibling || img.previousElementSibling.tagName == &quot;IMG&quot; || img.previousElementSibling.tagName == &quot;FIGURE&quot;)
        &amp;&amp; (!img.nextElementSibling || img.nextElementSibling.tagName == &quot;IMG&quot; || img.nextElementSibling.tagName == &quot;FIGURE&quot;)) {
      const parent = img.parentNode;
      const figure = document.createElement(&quot;figure&quot;);
      const figCaption = document.createElement(&quot;figcaption&quot;);
      parent.replaceChild(figure, img);
      figure.append(img);
      figure.append(figCaption);
      figCaption.textContent = alt;
    }
  }
}

<p>While President Donald Trump is trying to project strength by
ordering a federalized National Guard and the Marines into Los Angeles,
a new Quinnipiac poll of American registered voters out today reinforces
that both Trump and his policies are unpopular.</p>

<h2 id="generalissimo-trump">Generalissimo Trump?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-11, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I was wondering if Saturday’s military parade in Washington was going to
be the rollout of the Trump junta, and if that meant the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalissimo">president</a>
would appear in military garb, perhaps subdued so next year’s parade
they can add more features. So I asked ChatGPT to help.
</p>
<p>
<i>President Trump is reviewing the military parade in on a stage in
front of the White House in Washington DC. To honor the troops, he’s
dressed in a faux military uniform with medals, and a cap that says Make
America Great Again. Fighter jets are flying overhead.</i>
</p>
<p>
When I tried the first time, last night, it got halfway through the
drawing then quit, saying it violated their content guidelines. So I
went to <a href="https://www.meta.ai/">meta.ai</a>, which also does
drawing, and it was willing to do it, and even animated it. I uploaded
the result to my
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1610208569758308">AI group</a>
on Facebook. It should be visible to everyone, without an invitation.
</p>
<p>
I then tried again with ChatGPT and it was willing to do the same task
it wasn’t willing to do last night.

Yesterday I
<a href="http://scripting.com/2025/06/10/153445.html">introduced</a> a
new feed for great art, 24 times a day. Every hour on the hour.
</p>
<p>
Today, a version of that feed provides one work of art each day, at
midnight, Eastern.

Why I did this feed. I’m crafting a new information product, and I want
to include a random work of art but not every hour, once a day is
enough. I thought it was worth a detour to make the feed that I wanted.

The first work of art in the feed on its inaugural issue was

a documentary coming out about podcasting. I was interviewed in it and
got to tell a bunch of stories, about how you get people interested in
working with each other. I told the story of how I chose the Grateful
Dead’s music to get the initial implementation going, on both the
sending and receiving side. I used their music, since it so totally fit
in with the philosophy, ie come as you are, we’re all just people. And
the song I chose was a good one too, the
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22US%20Blues%22">US
Blues</a>. “I’m Uncle Sam, that’s who I am. I’ve been hiding out. In a
rock and roll band.” Using great art to prototype this connection makes
total sense. It says we carry forward our art where ever we go, no
matter where it takes us, a great work of music or art is always a good
thing to share.</p>

<h2 id="a-cname-for-your-feed">A CNAME for your feed</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-10, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Here’s something to think about. As you may recall, I have an hourly art
feed, available both in RSS and on Bluesky. Same content.
</p>
<p>
Today I gave each the same new name,
<a href="https://art.feediverse.org/">art.feediverse.org</a>.
</p>
<p>
If you use that URL
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/art.feediverse.org">on Bluesky</a>,
you go to its
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/art.feediverse.org">version</a> of the
content stream. And if you give the same URL to a web browser, ie
accessing it via HTTP, you get the
<a href="https://art.feediverse.org/">RSS version</a> of the same data.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
On Bluesky:
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/art.feediverse.org">https://bsky.app/profile/art.feediverse.org</a>.
</li>
<li>
On the web:
<a href="https://art.feediverse.org/">https://art.feediverse.org</a>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
BTW – think of <a href="https://feediverse.org/">feediverse</a> as a web
of feeds. It’s open of course, because the web itself is open. And it’s
pretty social as you will see. It’s why I think it’s really the first
instance of the “open social web.”
</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/images/2019/12/06/dorothy.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I’ve
long felt documents should have their own CNAMEs. I even went so far as
to design a system where each node in an outline could have a CNAME. I
still believe in this, why not have a hierarchic file system that’s as
editable as an outline? It’s the same idea that works in so many other
contexts. It’s why the idea of a scripting system on a graphic PC like
the early Mac made a world of sense. It’s why Unix underneath that same
UI was the right way to go. And why the web is so nice, you just View
Source and you get to lift the hood and see how it works.
</p>
<p>
They were smart at Bluesky to use DNS this way. Why invent your own
identity system when the net itself has a great distributed system that
scales? They just made the wrong call (imho) in not using
<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> for their
timeline data, or at least the outside world’s view of their timeline,
in both directions – in and out. That’s the basic idea of the Internet
itself. No one cares what’s behind your TCP interface, it could be a
network with a million nodes using some wacky protocol to connect them.
As long as I can get to you via TCP, you’re on the net. This is the
kumbaya philosophy of the net, why not just use what already works.
</p>
<p>
You’ll see that we’re able to do some interesting twitter-like stuff
with this duality.

The season has begun: as the sun sets, the Sanseveria flowers hidden
deep amidst the leaves open and that sweet opium fills the room. I walk
past the door and stop as if running into a different medium. Have I
stepped out of an air-conditioned room into a Bangkok summer night? That
sweetness takes me away as if I could bury my face into the neck of the
love of my life. Sanseveria bloom. You are blessed if you have
experienced it. Now is the season of my heart.

use ChatGPT for all kinds of work problems, and for a lot of other stuff
too. It can collaborate, and it has much more broad and deep knowledge
than I do, than any human. No one knows whether it thinks or is
self-aware, any more than we know whether humans think or are
self-aware. For that reason, I think, ironically, there’s no point
discussing it, we’ll never get an answer, because we have no idea what
intelligence or thinking is. But it is every bit as thoughtful as any
human I have ever worked with. And the whole business about
pattern-recognition is imho bs. People who say that are just repeating
what they heard from someone else. From a user standpoint, it’s
absolutely nothing like pattern recognition.</p>

<p>I went to the
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=dnc">DNC</a> in 2004 and
2008. Both times I heard from friends later that TV had been focused on
riots, which confused the hell out of me, because I didn’t see anything.
There was some obnoxious stuff at the 2008 convention in Denver, we had
to walk a gauntlet of ugly pictures of dead fetuses going in and out of
the convention center. But in neither case were there <i>any</i>
disturbances.</p>

<h2 id="the-game-of-being-rich">The game of being rich</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-09, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Some random thoughts about wealth.
</p>
<p>
Suppose you’re an average middle-class person who works for a tech
company when the company is bought out for a huge amount of money and
your stock is now worth $10 million. It’s liquid today. You just
received a check for $10 million. What do you do?
</p>
<p>
Answer: You buy things to see if there was a reason to make the money,
and it turns out there really wasn’t. You would have been just as happy
in the big house in the rich neighborhood or the smaller house in a more
modest area.
</p>
<p>
Then what if you reach another level, now you have a check in your hand
for $100 million, then $1 billion, then $25 billion and keep going. It
doesn’t stop there. At each level you are compelled to find something
fantastic that you can use that money for. Some power that the new level
of wealth gets you.
</p>
<p>
We saw in
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=succession">Succession</a>,
they played out the lunacy, the people use a lot of space, but they’re
still just people. If they loved someone or someone loved them, they’d
be much happier than all the happiness all that money ever gave them.
</p>
<p>
Having such large useless amounts of money is a not only a problem for
the rich folk, we’ve found out, it’s a problem for everyone else too,
because eventually they get around to buying political power and they
start using the money to change other people lives, always for the
worse, it seems.
</p>
<p>
We need a new game that only super rich people can play that doesn’t
hurt the rest of us. I’m not advising anyone to do anything. But I think
this is what I’ve been writing about on my blog since the beginning.
</p>
<p>
I didn’t understand why, for example, Evan Williams didn’t just make
technology and give it away, after having made billions from Twitter.
</p>
<p>
Why did Bill Gates have to accumulate so much money and threaten the
independence of the open web, a miracle, to get it? Why not use your
power to make miracles <i>before</i> you retire, start doing the good
you were promising to do later, right now? What good, in hindsight, did
the extra billions do for anyone, including Gates? When his power was at
his peak, in the 90s, he could have done a much bigger thing for the
world, give us a free new level of communication that would be available
equally to everyone.
</p>
<p>
Elon Musk, having done some incredible things in computers, finance,
cars and space, had to invent new challenges that only his wealth can
buy, and eventually came up with things that only the US Treasury could
buy, and some things like relocating the human species on Mars, that no
amount of money can buy (or so scientists say). He needs to receive an
award of love and gratitude for not using his wealth to make everyone
else totally miserable (including himself, it seems).

Track Android Users</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-09, updated: 2025-06-14, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Researchers have <a href="https://localmess.github.io/">discovered</a> a
new way to covertly track Android users. Both Meta and Yandex were using
it, but have suddenly stopped now that they have been caught.
</p>
<p>
The
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/06/meta-and-yandex-are-de-anonymizing-android-users-web-browsing-identifiers/">details</a>
are interesting, and worth reading in detail:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Tracking code that Meta and Russia-based Yandex embed into millions of
websites is de-anonymizing visitors by abusing legitimate Internet
protocols, causing Chrome and other browsers to surreptitiously send
unique identifiers to native apps installed on a device,
<a href="https://localmess.github.io/">researchers have discovered</a>.
Google says it’s investigating the abuse, which allows Meta and Yandex
to convert ephemeral web identifiers into persistent mobile app user
identities…

ChatGPT there’s no excuse for a congressperson not validating every word
in every bill. They could ask the bot to read the bill and call out any
provisions that contradict your previous positions. It knows where you
stand even if you’ve never written it down. I’ve found it can do that
for my work. I’m sure it could do it for a legislator. Even better, news
orgs could do that for them. Or validate a bill against their campaign
platforms. “I promise never to touch Social Security” could be validated
against pending legislation. The time delay part of this isn’t an excuse
any longer.</p>

systems doing mathematics and basically not finding any. Mathematical
proofs creative things, not algorithmic. That has not been my experience
with ChatGPT and creating software. I find that when I want to talk
about software I’m working on, it understands what I’m saying, but I’ve
never had it come up with an original idea on its own. A human who
captivated my attention as it does, and who I spent as much time with as
I do with ChatGPT would have stimulated <i>some</i> original ideas by
now. If I talk with a friend for even a few minutes there will be at

and backward compatible.
