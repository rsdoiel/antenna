<h1 id="2025-05-27-alt-text-on-this-blog">
2025-05-27 Alt text on this blog
</h1>
<p>
On the web, the alt text is a description of an image to be shown by
browsers when the image cannot be shown ‚Äì like text browsers or screen
readers. So what about alt text on this blog? What about blog posts full
of photos, specifically? Like the <a href="Croatia">Croatia</a> posts.
</p>
<p>
I think that alt text should be unnecessary on my blog because the text
should carry the entire message. ‚ÄúWelcome to my
<a href="Wall_of_Text">Wall of Text</a>!‚Äù üòÑ
</p>
<p>
On fedi, I like alt text and I both read and write it. I hate clients
that don‚Äôt display it. I want to always read it. Therefore, on my blog,
the equivalent of alt text should always be readable. But real alt text
isn‚Äôt shown to me ‚Äì the browser is showing me the pictures, instead. It
makes sense. And on fedi it only works because the applications and
front-ends don‚Äôt just use the alt text attribute for images in HTML ‚Äì
they have an extra user-interface to allow me to read it. Buttons,
mouse-over, long-press, whatever it takes.
</p>
<p>
There are options for this blog, of course. Except I don‚Äôt like these
options.
</p>
<p>
I could reuse the alt text as the image title attribute which is shown
on mouse-over by default. I don‚Äôt like being forced to use mouse and I
don‚Äôt like duplicating the description.
</p>
<p>
In Markdown:
</p>
<pre><code>![alt text](url &quot;title&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>
I could automatically use the alt text as the title attribute but I
still don‚Äôt like to use the mouse to read the title attribute and I
wouldn‚Äôt be able to switch Markdown rendering engines as easily if I
hack it. Writing some Javascript to produce extra pop-ups or some other
user-interface element would be even worse, and it would need extra
clicking or keyboard navigation as a reader. No way.
</p>
<p>
The last option is the best. Just write the description above the image:
</p>
<pre><code>Description

![](url)
</code></pre>
<p>
I‚Äôve tried using the title attribute for some of my recent picture-heavy
blog posts about Croatia and I‚Äôve been checking the result using Gemini
and Gopher, and I‚Äôm not happy.
</p>
<p>
Compare the following two with the
<a href="https://alexschroeder.ch/view/2025-05-17-%C5%A1ibenik">web</a>
version where I can‚Äôt read the alt text. (Screenshots from
<a href="https://gmi.skyjake.fi/lagrange/">Lagrange</a> on my phone.)
</p>
<p>
The <a href="gemini://alexschroeder.ch/2025-05-17-≈°ibenik">Gemini</a>
version looks OK with some text paragraphs being links to the images.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-1.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
The <a href="gopher://alexschroeder.ch/02025-05-17-≈°ibenik">Gopher</a>
version shows the alt texts as weird disjointed text paragraphs that
sometimes repeat the preceding paragraph and sometimes don‚Äôt.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-2.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
I guess I could write longer alt texts until the Gopher version looks
good but then the Gemini version looks weird and the web version
continues to not show it.
</p>
<p>
Now check the Gemini and Gopher output for the page you‚Äôre reading right
now!
</p>
<p>
The <a href="gopher://alexschroeder.ch/02025-05-27-alt-text">Gopher</a>
version is OK. The line-breaks don‚Äôt look nice on the phone at the
default resolution so ignore that weird line-break. What we can see is
that the empty alt text generated an empty paragraph. Something I should
fix. üòÖ But in general, it looks OK and reads well.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-3.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
The <a href="gemini://alexschroeder.ch/2025-05-27-alt-text">Gemini</a>
version still looks OK. It also links to the Gopher and Gemini versions,
so ignore those extra links. üòÖ The browser substitutes the filenames
for the missing alt text. That works for me. I‚Äôm not sure what a screen
reader would do. Probably say: ‚ÄúImage. 2025-05-27-alt-text-3.jpg‚Äù? And
I‚Äôm not sure what a person with bad sight would prefer. At this point
I‚Äôd know that I can skip the image since I have already read the
description above.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-4.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
And here‚Äôs the same passage a day later, using the text browser
<code>lynx</code>. The inline links look good, and there‚Äôs no trace of
the screenshots. This is great! It‚Äôs as readable as the Gopher version
with no extra line-breaks, and the inline links are inline (unlike in
the Gemini version).
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-5.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Checking with <code>edbrowse</code>. The inline links are wrapped in
bracers, which looks good, and the images with no alt text are shown as
empty square brackets (<code>[]</code>) which works for me. Ideally, I
guess, they‚Äôd just disappear.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-6.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
All in all, I think this solution is better: Instead of alt text, just
write more text above each image.
</p>
<p>
What I‚Äôm less sure about is whether this automatically implies that all
images are ‚Äúdecorative‚Äù and therefore should have an empty alt text
(instead of no alt text). It seems to me that the filename being shown
is a lot of visual clutter, but that only seems to affect Gemini, not
the text browser.
</p>
<p>
What do you think?

<p>
<strong>2025-05-29</strong>. I fixed that minor issue in
<a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/markdown-gopher.git/">markdown-gopher</a>
so that it skips paragraphs containing just images with no alt text. üòÑ
</p>
<p>
<strong>2025-05-31</strong>. I added a piece of Javascript to copy the
alt text to the title attribute if the alt text is set and the title is
not. Perhaps that‚Äôll motivate me to add more alt text.
</p>
<p>
This is what I added to my <code>view.html</code> template for
<a href="Odd%CE%BC">OddŒº</a>:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
function addTitle() {
  const images = document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;img&quot;);
  for (let img of images) {
    const alt = img.getAttribute(&quot;alt&quot;);
    const title = img.getAttribute(&quot;title&quot;);
    if (alt != null &amp;&amp; title == null) {
      img.setAttribute(&quot;title&quot;, alt);
    }
  }
}
window.addEventListener('load', addTitle);
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
<strong>2025-06-09</strong>. Tweaked the JavaScript. I‚Äôm now replacing
the <code>img</code> element with a <code>figure</code> element, moving
the <code>img</code> element into the <code>figure</code> and adding a
<code>figcaption</code> element. The caption is rendered smaller and
italic via CSS.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-7.jpg" alt="Example" />
</p>
<p>
Code:
</p>
<pre><code>function addTitle() {
  const images = document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;img&quot;);
  for (let img of images) {
    const parent = img.parentNode;
    const figure = document.createElement(&quot;figure&quot;);
    const figCaption = document.createElement(&quot;figcaption&quot;);
    parent.replaceChild(figure, img);
    figure.append(img);
    figure.append(figCaption);
    const alt = img.getAttribute(&quot;alt&quot;);
    const title = img.getAttribute(&quot;title&quot;);
    figCaption.textContent = alt;
    if (alt != null &amp;&amp; title == null) {
      img.setAttribute(&quot;title&quot;, alt);
    }
  }
}
window.addEventListener('load', addTitle);

use ChatGPT for all kinds of work problems, and for a lot of other stuff
too. It can collaborate, and it has much more broad and deep knowledge
than I do, than any human. No one knows whether it thinks or is
self-aware, any more than we know whether humans think or are
self-aware. For that reason, I think, ironically, there‚Äôs no point
discussing it, we‚Äôll never get an answer, because we have no idea what
intelligence or thinking is. But it is every bit as thoughtful as any
human I have ever worked with. And the whole business about
pattern-recognition is imho bs. People who say that are just repeating
what they heard from someone else. From a user standpoint, it‚Äôs
absolutely nothing like pattern recognition.</p>

<p>I went to the
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=dnc">DNC</a> in 2004 and
2008. Both times I heard from friends later that TV had been focused on
riots, which confused the hell out of me, because I didn‚Äôt see anything.
There was some obnoxious stuff at the 2008 convention in Denver, we had
to walk a gauntlet of ugly pictures of dead fetuses going in and out of
the convention center. But in neither case were there <i>any</i>
disturbances. I see the same sort of thing happening in LA now.</p>

<h2 id="the-game-of-being-rich">The game of being rich</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-09, from: Dave Winer‚Äôs Scripting News</p>
<p>
Some random thoughts about wealth.
</p>
<p>
Suppose you‚Äôre an average middle-class person who works for a tech
company when the company is bought out for a huge amount of money and
your stock is now worth $10 million. It‚Äôs liquid today. You just
received a check for $10 million. What do you do?
</p>
<p>
Answer: You buy things to see if there was a reason to make the money,
and it turns out there really wasn‚Äôt. You would have been just as happy
in the big house in the rich neighborhood or the smaller house in a more
modest place.
</p>
<p>
Then what if you reach another level, now you have a check in your hand
for $100 million, then $1 billion, then $25 billion and keep going. It
doesn‚Äôt stop there. At each level you are compelled to find something
fantastic that you can use that money for. Some power that the new level
of wealth gets you.
</p>
<p>
We saw in
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=succession">Succession</a>,
they played out the lunacy, the people use a lot of space, but they‚Äôre
still just people. If they loved someone or someone loved them, they‚Äôd
be much happier than all the happiness all that money ever gave them.
</p>
<p>
Having such large useless amounts of money is a not only a problem for
the rich folk, we‚Äôve found out, it‚Äôs a problem for everyone else too,
because eventually they get around to buying political power and they
start using the money to change other people lives, always for the
worse, it seems.
</p>
<p>
We need a new game that only super rich people can play that doesn‚Äôt
hurt the rest of us. I‚Äôm not advising anyone to do anything. But I think
this is what I‚Äôve been writing about on my blog since the beginning.
</p>
<p>
I didn‚Äôt understand why, for example, Evan Williams didn‚Äôt just make
technology and give it away, after having made billions from Twitter.
</p>
<p>
Why did Bill Gates have to accumulate so much money and threaten the
independence of the open web, a miracle, to get it? Why not use your
power to make miracles <i>before</i> you retire, start doing the good
you were promising to do later, right now? What good, in hindsight, did
the extra billions do for anyone, including Gates? When his power was at
his peak, in the 90s, he could have done a much bigger thing for the
world, give us a free new level of communication that would be available
equally to everyone.
</p>
<p>
Elon Musk, having done some incredible things in computers, finance,
cars and space, had to invent new challenges that only his wealth can
buy, and eventually came up with things that only the US Treasury could
buy, and some things like relocating the human species on Mars, that no
amount of money can buy (or so scientists say). He needs to receive an
award of love and gratitude for not using his wealth to make everyone
else totally miserable (including himself, it seems).

Researchers have <a href="https://localmess.github.io/">discovered</a> a
new way to covertly track Android users. Both Meta and Yandex were using
it, but have suddenly stopped now that they have been caught.

<p>
The

are interesting, and worth reading in detail:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
&gt;Tracking code that Meta and Russia-based Yandex embed into millions
of websites is de-anonymizing visitors by abusing legitimate Internet
protocols, causing Chrome and other browsers to surreptitiously send
unique identifiers to native apps installed on a device,
<a href="https://localmess.github.io/">researchers have discovered</a>.
Google says it‚Äôs investigating the abuse, which allows Meta and Yandex
to convert ephemeral web identifiers into persistent mobile app user
identities‚Ä¶

<p>Today is the 100th birthday of Gail Jesswein, my father-in-law. Gail
was the father of eight, the first of whom is my wife Joyce. Gail was a
merchant mariner during World War II, when the casualty rate was one in
twenty-six, higher than any U.S. military branch. On shore after the end

<p>If it takes Apple as long to have its own competitive LLMs as it did
to have its own competitive web browser, I suspect they‚Äôll soon be
paying to use the LLMs that are owned and controlled by others, not

ChatGPT there‚Äôs no excuse for a congressperson not validating every word
in every bill. They could ask the bot to read the bill and call out any
provisions that contradict your previous positions. It knows where you
stand even if you‚Äôve never written it down. I‚Äôve found it can do that
for my work. I‚Äôm sure it could do it for a legislator. Even better, news
orgs could do that for them. Or validate a bill against their campaign
platforms. ‚ÄúI promise never to touch Social Security‚Äù could be validated
against pending legislation. The time delay part of this isn‚Äôt an excuse
any longer.</p>

on Bluesky this morning about what we need to hear incumbent Dems say
before they step aside as part of the future of the party. We can‚Äôt be
lead by Democrats who didn‚Äôt do everything in their power the four years
of the Biden presidency to shut the door on autocracy. They argued the
niceties of filibusters, and letting the DoJ procrastinate on cleaning
up the mess, as if everything had snapped back to normal. There was huge
unfinished business. We never shut down the insurrection that started on
January 6. Otherwise we will wait until the whole system falls down for
the Democratic Party to reform probably around someone who comes from
MuskLand.</p>
