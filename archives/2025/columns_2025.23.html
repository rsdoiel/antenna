<p>Would one of the browser vendors work with me on doing something nice
with displaying feeds in XML form? I don’t support obfuscating what a
feed is, that just adds confusion. When I lift the hood of a car I want
to see an engine not a drawing of something that sort of looks like a
car, but not really, and looks nothing like an engine.</p>

<p>
Yesterday I
<a href="http://scripting.com/2025/06/10/153445.html">introduced</a> a
new feed for great art, 24 times a day. Every hour on the hour.
</p>
<p>
Today, a version of that feed provides one work of art each day, at
midnight, Eastern.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://art.feediverse.org/">art.feediverse.org</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://artdaily.feediverse.org/">artdaily.feediverse.org</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Why I did this feed. I’m crafting a new information product, and I want
to include a random work of art but not every hour, once a day is
enough. I thought it was worth a detour to make the feed that I wanted.
</p>
<p>
The first work of art in the feed on its inaugural issue was
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scripting/artDownloader/main/data/images/FCZ5y6oWQAU8Gum.jpg">The
Countess</a> from Hans Holbein the Younger,
<a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/365207">1526</a>.
It was chosen at random from a
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/artDownloader/tree/main">collection</a>
of 42,473 works of art.

a documentary coming out about podcasting. I was interviewed in it and
got to tell a bunch of stories, about how you get people interested in
working with each other. I told the story of how I chose the Grateful
Dead’s music to get the initial implementation going, on both the
sending and receiving side. I used their music, since it so totally fit
in with the philosophy, ie come as you are, we’re all just people. And
the song I chose was a good one too, the
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22US%20Blues%22">US
Blues</a>. “I’m Uncle Sam, that’s who I am. I’ve been hiding out. In a
rock and roll band.” Using great art to prototype this connection makes
total sense. It says we carry forward our art where ever we go, no
matter where it takes us, a great work of music or art is always a good
thing to share.</p>

<h2 id="a-cname-for-your-feed">A CNAME for your feed</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-10, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Here’s something to think about. As you may recall, I have an hourly art
feed, available both in RSS and on Bluesky. Same content.
</p>
<p>
Today I gave each the same new name,
<a href="https://art.feediverse.org/">art.feediverse.org</a>.
</p>
<p>
If you use that URL
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/art.feediverse.org">on Bluesky</a>,
you go to its
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/art.feediverse.org">version</a> of the
content stream. And if you give the same URL to a web browser, ie
accessing it via HTTP, you get the
<a href="https://art.feediverse.org/">RSS version</a> of the same data.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
On Bluesky:
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/art.feediverse.org">https://bsky.app/profile/art.feediverse.org</a>.
</li>
<li>
On the web:
<a href="https://art.feediverse.org/">https://art.feediverse.org</a>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
BTW – think of <a href="https://feediverse.org/">feediverse</a> as a web
of feeds. It’s open of course, because the web itself is open. And it’s
pretty social as you will see. It’s why I think it’s really the first
instance of the “open social web.”
</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/images/2019/12/06/dorothy.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I’ve
long felt documents should have their own CNAMEs. I even went so far as
to design a system where each node in an outline could have a CNAME. I
still believe in this, why not have a hierarchic file system that’s as
editable as an outline? It’s the same idea that works in so many other
contexts. It’s why the idea of a scripting system on a graphic PC like
the early Mac made a world of sense. It’s why Unix underneath that same
UI was the right way to go. And why the web is so nice, you just View
Source and you get to lift the hood and see how it works.
</p>
<p>
They were smart at Bluesky to use DNS this way. Why invent your own
identity system when the net itself has a great distributed system that
scales? They just made the wrong call (imho) in not using
<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> for their
timeline data, or at least the outside world’s view of their timeline,
in both directions – in and out. That’s the basic idea of the Internet
itself. No one cares what’s behind your TCP interface, it could be a
network with a million nodes using some wacky protocol to connect them.
As long as I can get to you via TCP, you’re on the net. This is the
kumbaya philosophy of the net, why not just use what already works.
</p>
<p>
You’ll see that we’re able to do some interesting twitter-like stuff
with this duality.

The season has begun: as the sun sets, the Sanseveria flowers hidden
deep amidst the leaves open and that sweet opium fills the room. I walk
past the door and stop as if running into a different medium. Have I
stepped out of an air-conditioned room into a Bangkok summer night? That
sweetness takes me away as if I could bury my face into the neck of the
love of my life. Sanseveria bloom. You are blessed if you have
experienced it. Now is the season of my heart.

<h2 id="alt-text-on-this-blog">2025-05-27 Alt text on this blog</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-09, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2025-05-27-alt-text-on-this-blog">
2025-05-27 Alt text on this blog
</h1>
<p>
On the web, the alt text is a description of an image to be shown by
browsers when the image cannot be shown – like text browsers or screen
readers. So what about alt text on this blog? What about blog posts full
of photos, specifically? Like the <a href="Croatia">Croatia</a> posts.
</p>
<p>
I think that alt text should be unnecessary on my blog because the text
should carry the entire message. “Welcome to my
<a href="Wall_of_Text">Wall of Text</a>!” 😄
</p>
<p>
On fedi, I like alt text and I both read and write it. I hate clients
that don’t display it. I want to always read it. Therefore, on my blog,
the equivalent of alt text should always be readable. But real alt text
isn’t shown to me – the browser is showing me the pictures, instead. It
makes sense. And on fedi it only works because the applications and
front-ends don’t just use the alt text attribute for images in HTML –
they have an extra user-interface to allow me to read it. Buttons,
mouse-over, long-press, whatever it takes.
</p>
<p>
There are options for this blog, of course. Except I don’t like these
options.
</p>
<p>
I could reuse the alt text as the image title attribute which is shown
on mouse-over by default. I don’t like being forced to use mouse and I
don’t like duplicating the description.
</p>
<p>
In Markdown:
</p>
<pre><code>![alt text](url &quot;title&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>
I could automatically use the alt text as the title attribute but I
still don’t like to use the mouse to read the title attribute and I
wouldn’t be able to switch Markdown rendering engines as easily if I
hack it. Writing some Javascript to produce extra pop-ups or some other
user-interface element would be even worse, and it would need extra
clicking or keyboard navigation as a reader. No way.
</p>
<p>
The last option is the best. Just write the description above the image:
</p>
<pre><code>Description

![](url)
</code></pre>
<p>
I’ve tried using the title attribute for some of my recent picture-heavy
blog posts about Croatia and I’ve been checking the result using Gemini
and Gopher, and I’m not happy.
</p>
<p>
Compare the following two with the
<a href="https://alexschroeder.ch/view/2025-05-17-%C5%A1ibenik">web</a>
version where I can’t read the alt text. (Screenshots from
<a href="https://gmi.skyjake.fi/lagrange/">Lagrange</a> on my phone.)
</p>
<p>
The <a href="gemini://alexschroeder.ch/2025-05-17-šibenik">Gemini</a>
version looks OK with some text paragraphs being links to the images.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-1.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
The <a href="gopher://alexschroeder.ch/02025-05-17-šibenik">Gopher</a>
version shows the alt texts as weird disjointed text paragraphs that
sometimes repeat the preceding paragraph and sometimes don’t.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-2.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
I guess I could write longer alt texts until the Gopher version looks
good but then the Gemini version looks weird and the web version
continues to not show it.
</p>
<p>
Now check the Gemini and Gopher output for the page you’re reading right
now!
</p>
<p>
The <a href="gopher://alexschroeder.ch/02025-05-27-alt-text">Gopher</a>
version is OK. The line-breaks don’t look nice on the phone at the
default resolution so ignore that weird line-break. What we can see is
that the empty alt text generated an empty paragraph. Something I should
fix. 😅 But in general, it looks OK and reads well.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-3.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
The <a href="gemini://alexschroeder.ch/2025-05-27-alt-text">Gemini</a>
version still looks OK. It also links to the Gopher and Gemini versions,
so ignore those extra links. 😅 The browser substitutes the filenames
for the missing alt text. That works for me. I’m not sure what a screen
reader would do. Probably say: “Image. 2025-05-27-alt-text-3.jpg”? And
I’m not sure what a person with bad sight would prefer. At this point
I’d know that I can skip the image since I have already read the
description above.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-4.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
And here’s the same passage a day later, using the text browser
<code>lynx</code>. The inline links look good, and there’s no trace of
the screenshots. This is great! It’s as readable as the Gopher version
with no extra line-breaks, and the inline links are inline (unlike in
the Gemini version).
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-5.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Checking with <code>edbrowse</code>. The inline links are wrapped in
bracers, which looks good, and the images with no alt text are shown as
empty square brackets (<code>[]</code>) which works for me. Ideally, I
guess, they’d just disappear.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-6.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
All in all, I think this solution is better: Instead of alt text, just
write more text above each image.
</p>
<p>
What I’m less sure about is whether this automatically implies that all
images are “decorative” and therefore should have an empty alt text
(instead of no alt text). It seems to me that the filename being shown
is a lot of visual clutter, but that only seems to affect Gemini, not
the text browser.
</p>
<p>
What do you think?

<strong>2025-05-29</strong>. I fixed that minor issue in
<a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/markdown-gopher.git/">markdown-gopher</a>
so that it skips paragraphs containing just images with no alt text. 😄
</p>
<p>
<strong>2025-05-31</strong>. I added a piece of Javascript to copy the
alt text to the title attribute if the alt text is set and the title is
not. Perhaps that’ll motivate me to add more alt text.
</p>
<p>
This is what I added to my <code>view.html</code> template for
<a href="Odd%CE%BC">Oddμ</a>:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
function addTitle() {
  const images = document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;img&quot;);
  for (let img of images) {
    const alt = img.getAttribute(&quot;alt&quot;);
    const title = img.getAttribute(&quot;title&quot;);
    if (alt != null &amp;&amp; title == null) {
      img.setAttribute(&quot;title&quot;, alt);
    }
  }
}
window.addEventListener('load', addTitle);
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
<strong>2025-06-09</strong>. Tweaked the JavaScript. I’m now replacing
the <code>img</code> element with a <code>figure</code> element, moving
the <code>img</code> element into the <code>figure</code> and adding a
<code>figcaption</code> element. The caption is rendered smaller and
italic via CSS.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-7.jpg" alt="Example" />
</p>
<p>
Code:
</p>
<pre><code>function addTitle() {
  const images = document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;img&quot;);
  for (let img of images) {
    const parent = img.parentNode;
    const figure = document.createElement(&quot;figure&quot;);
    const figCaption = document.createElement(&quot;figcaption&quot;);
    parent.replaceChild(figure, img);
    figure.append(img);
    figure.append(figCaption);
    const alt = img.getAttribute(&quot;alt&quot;);
    const title = img.getAttribute(&quot;title&quot;);
    figCaption.textContent = alt;
    if (alt != null &amp;&amp; title == null) {
      img.setAttribute(&quot;title&quot;, alt);
    }
  }
}
window.addEventListener('load', addTitle);

use ChatGPT for all kinds of work problems, and for a lot of other stuff
too. It can collaborate, and it has much more broad and deep knowledge
than I do, than any human. No one knows whether it thinks or is
self-aware, any more than we know whether humans think or are
self-aware. For that reason, I think, ironically, there’s no point
discussing it, we’ll never get an answer, because we have no idea what
intelligence or thinking is. But it is every bit as thoughtful as any
human I have ever worked with. And the whole business about
pattern-recognition is imho bs. People who say that are just repeating
what they heard from someone else. From a user standpoint, it’s
absolutely nothing like pattern recognition.</p>

<p>I went to the
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=dnc">DNC</a> in 2004 and
2008. Both times I heard from friends later that TV had been focused on
riots, which confused the hell out of me, because I didn’t see anything.
There was some obnoxious stuff at the 2008 convention in Denver, we had
to walk a gauntlet of ugly pictures of dead fetuses going in and out of
the convention center. But in neither case were there <i>any</i>
disturbances.</p>

<h2 id="the-game-of-being-rich">The game of being rich</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-09, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Some random thoughts about wealth.
</p>
<p>
Suppose you’re an average middle-class person who works for a tech
company when the company is bought out for a huge amount of money and
your stock is now worth $10 million. It’s liquid today. You just
received a check for $10 million. What do you do?
</p>
<p>
Answer: You buy things to see if there was a reason to make the money,
and it turns out there really wasn’t. You would have been just as happy
in the big house in the rich neighborhood or the smaller house in a more
modest area.
</p>
<p>
Then what if you reach another level, now you have a check in your hand
for $100 million, then $1 billion, then $25 billion and keep going. It
doesn’t stop there. At each level you are compelled to find something
fantastic that you can use that money for. Some power that the new level
of wealth gets you.
</p>
<p>
We saw in
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=succession">Succession</a>,
they played out the lunacy, the people use a lot of space, but they’re
still just people. If they loved someone or someone loved them, they’d
be much happier than all the happiness all that money ever gave them.
</p>
<p>
Having such large useless amounts of money is a not only a problem for
the rich folk, we’ve found out, it’s a problem for everyone else too,
because eventually they get around to buying political power and they
start using the money to change other people lives, always for the
worse, it seems.
</p>
<p>
We need a new game that only super rich people can play that doesn’t
hurt the rest of us. I’m not advising anyone to do anything. But I think
this is what I’ve been writing about on my blog since the beginning.
</p>
<p>
I didn’t understand why, for example, Evan Williams didn’t just make
technology and give it away, after having made billions from Twitter.
</p>
<p>
Why did Bill Gates have to accumulate so much money and threaten the
independence of the open web, a miracle, to get it? Why not use your
power to make miracles <i>before</i> you retire, start doing the good
you were promising to do later, right now? What good, in hindsight, did
the extra billions do for anyone, including Gates? When his power was at
his peak, in the 90s, he could have done a much bigger thing for the
world, give us a free new level of communication that would be available
equally to everyone.
</p>
<p>
Elon Musk, having done some incredible things in computers, finance,
cars and space, had to invent new challenges that only his wealth can
buy, and eventually came up with things that only the US Treasury could
buy, and some things like relocating the human species on Mars, that no
amount of money can buy (or so scientists say). He needs to receive an
award of love and gratitude for not using his wealth to make everyone
else totally miserable (including himself, it seems).

Covertly Android Users</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-09, updated: 2025-06-08, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Researchers have <a href="https://localmess.github.io/">discovered</a> a
new way to covertly track Android users. Both Meta and Yandex were using
it, but have suddenly stopped now that they have been caught.
</p>
<p>
The
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/06/meta-and-yandex-are-de-anonymizing-android-users-web-browsing-identifiers/">details</a>
are interesting, and worth reading in detail:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
&gt;Tracking code that Meta and Russia-based Yandex embed into millions
of websites is de-anonymizing visitors by abusing legitimate Internet
protocols, causing Chrome and other browsers to surreptitiously send
unique identifiers to native apps installed on a device,
<a href="https://localmess.github.io/">researchers have discovered</a>.
Google says it’s investigating the abuse, which allows Meta and Yandex
to convert ephemeral web identifiers into persistent mobile app user
identities…

ChatGPT there’s no excuse for a congressperson not validating every word
in every bill. They could ask the bot to read the bill and call out any
provisions that contradict your previous positions. It knows where you
stand even if you’ve never written it down. I’ve found it can do that
for my work. I’m sure it could do it for a legislator. Even better, news
orgs could do that for them. Or validate a bill against their campaign
platforms. “I promise never to touch Social Security” could be validated
against pending legislation. The time delay part of this isn’t an excuse
any longer.</p>
