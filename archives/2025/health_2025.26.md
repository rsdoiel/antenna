## Innovo GenMax MTB-RIF/INH: a moderate-complexity automated NAAT for rapid simultaneous detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and rifampin/isoniazid resistance

date: 2025-06-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectiveGiven the increase of treatment failure, relapse and acquired resistance observed in isoniazid (INH) resistance, there is an urgent to improve rifampin (RIF) -priority based diagnostic strategies. Therefore, we evaluated the performance of Innovo GenMax MTB-RIF/INH (GenMax), a moderate- complexity automated nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), for detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) and resistance to RIF and INH.MethodsAnalytical sensitivity (limit of detection, LOD) was determined using serial dilutions of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (ATCC 27249) strains. Diagnostic accuracy was assessed in clinical sputum specimens against microbiological reference standards (MRS: positive by smear microscopy, culture or Xpert MTB/RIF for diagnosis of TB) and phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST). Discordant results were resolved by sequencing resistance genes (IS6110, rpoB, katG, inhA, ahpC) and follow-up diagnosis results.ResultsGenMax demonstrated a calculated LOD of 8.8 CFU/mL (95% CI: 7.4-11.4) for MTBC, 674.1 CFU/mL (95% CI: 578.8-923.5) for RIF resistance, and 747.3 CFU/mL (95% CI: 613.7-1081.3) for INH resistance. In clinical evaluation, the sensitivity and specificity for MTBC detection were 97.52% (95% CI: 92.38–99.36) and 93.65% (95% CI: 88.91–96.53), respectively. For RIF and INH resistance, sensitivities were 88.46% (95% CI: 68.72–96.97) and 85.19% (95% CI: 65.39–95.14), with specificity of 92.42% (95% CI: 82.50-97.18) and 94.12% (95% CI: 84.86-98.10).ConclusionInnovo GenMax MTB-RIF/INH is a rapid and automated assay with high sensitivity for MTBC detection, suitable for decentralized settings. While its performance for RIF/INH resistance detection is competitive with existing assays, its sensitivity remains gaps relative to WHO targets. Further optimization, particularly through expanded probe coverage, is needed to bridge this gap and ensure reliable detection in clinical settings.

## Coculture of tumor organoids with pathogenic microorganisms: a novel system to mimic in vivo pathogenic infection

date: 2025-06-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Since the early 20th century, there has been extensive discussion on the intricate relationship between pathogenic infection and tumors. However, most studies on host-pathogen interactions are performed based on the in-vitro culture, immortalized cell lines or animal experiments. A significant challenge lies in accurately establishing a coculture model between tumors and pathogens under the three-dimensional (3D) context. Recently, the hybrid model system that incorporates 3D tumor organoids and two-dimensional cell lines have been gradually used to analyze the intricate relationship between pathogens and tumors, and several coculture techniques for tumor organoids and pathogens have also been developed. Therefore, this study systematically reviewed the preparation and identification of tumor organoids, coculture techniques with pathogens, and their clinical applications, aiming to further understand and simulate the interaction mechanism between the hosts and pathogens.

## TrexAB, a novel tetracycline resistance determinant in Streptococcus dysgalactiae

date: 2025-06-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundStreptococcus dysgalactiae (SD) is a potent pathogen associated with infections in a broad range of host species. Notably, a substantial proportion of SD isolates exhibit reduced susceptibility to tetracycline but lack identifiable resistance determinants. In the present study, we wanted to explore the genetic basis for this low-grade resistance to tetracycline.MethodsGenome-wide association studies were performed on a collection of 407 SD genomes to identify potential novel resistance determinants. Two strains of SD, belonging to each of the subspecies dysgalactiae and equisimilis were used for mutagenesis. Natural transformation was exploited to knock out resistance gene candidates, and the resultant mutants were compared with their respective wildtypes regarding susceptibility to tetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline, tigecycline, erythromycin, gentamicin, clindamycin and ciprofloxacin.ResultsWe identified a two gene operon, herein designated trexAB, significantly associated with reduced susceptibility to tetracycline. The proteins encoded by the operon were predicted in silico to constitute a heterodimeric efflux transporter. The knockout of trexAB led to a 16- to 32-fold reduction in minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for tetracycline and a 4-fold reduction in MIC for tigecycline in the investigated strains. No differences between mutants and wildtypes were observed for other antibiotics included in the test panel. Whole genome alignment of mutants and their respective wildtypes revealed no differences other than the expected differences caused by the knockout.ConclusionWe have characterized a novel operon causing low-grade resistance to tetracycline in SD. The MIC distribution of trexAB-positive isolates is intersected by the current EUCAST susceptibility breakpoint, and our findings are relevant for future revisions and determinations of adequate breakpoints for tetracycline in S. dysgalactiae.

## Eco-friendly silver nanoparticles from garlic: a novel therapeutic approach for treating Escherichia fergusonii wound infections

date: 2025-06-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionComplicated wound infections pose a significant challenge to patient recovery and healthcare systems, particularly due to the emergence of less common but highly resistant multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens that undermine the efficacy of conventional antibiotic therapies. This growing threat highlights the urgent need for innovative antimicrobial approaches. MethodologyIn this study, we synthesized eco-friendly silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using garlic extract to combat complicated wound infections caused by atypical MDR pathogens. ResultsGenetic sequencing of 16S rRNA gene, aligned with phenotypic identification methods, confirmed that Escherichia fergusonii (E. fergusonii) as a significant atypical pathogen responsible for complicated wound infections, with a prevalence rate of 24% (12 out of 50 cases). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed that all identified E. fergusonii strains exhibited MDR patterns. Garlic extract, analyzed using GC-MS and UPLC-ESI-MS/MS, identified sulfur-containing bioactive compounds such as allyl methyl trisulfide, dimethyl trisulfide, and allicin, which facilitated the biosynthesis of AgNPs. Stable, spherical AgNPs (15–20 nm) with strong antimicrobial properties were confirmed under optimal conditions (10 mL garlic extract, 40°C, pH 8.0). Their properties were validated using UV-Vis spectroscopy, XRD, and TEM. Antibacterial assays of AgNPs showed mean inhibition zones of 28±0.5 mm and MIC values of 100 µg/mL. TEM analysis revealed that AgNPs compromised bacterial membrane integrity, leading to structural damage, increased permeability, and leakage of intracellular contents. Simultaneously, they induced a concentration-dependent depletion of intracellular glutathione (GSH) in E. fergusonii, suggesting that both membrane disruption and oxidative stress synergistically contribute to bacterial cell lysis and death.  A strong synergistic interaction was observed between AgNPs, used at a safe concentration below 50 µM as confirmed by cytotoxicity assays, and antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin, as evidenced by a fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) index of 0.37. Time-kill assays demonstrated rapid bacterial eradication when AgNPs were combined with antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin. ConclusionThese findings underscore the promise of garlic-derived silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) as a fast-acting, eco-friendly option for treating complex wound infections caused by atypical multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens.

## Majority of the erythrocyte binding proteins of the Pvfam “a” family of Plasmodium vivax interact with Basigin to assist parasite entry into the host cell

date: 2025-06-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Molecular mechanisms of red cell invasion by the Plasmodium vivax parasite remain obscure since information on receptor–ligand interaction is scarce. Several proteins of the P. vivax Pvfam “a” family are known to bind with host erythrocytes. Some of them share their erythrocyte receptors with each other and vice versa, but the identification of these receptors is awaited with the exception of PvTRAg38. Here, we demonstrate by using solid-phase binding assay and surface plasmon resonance that majority (7 out of 10) of these erythrocyte binding proteins (PvTRAg, PvTRAg33.5, PvTRAg35.2, PvTRAg34, PvTRAg36, PvTRAg38, and PvTRAg69.4) interact with the erythrocyte receptor Basigin. These interactions seem to be important for the parasite’s survival since each of these proteins interfered with the parasite’s growth in a heterologous culture system. Furthermore, a higher parasite growth inhibition rate was observed with the combination of these proteins, suggesting the significance of multiple parasite ligand’s interaction with the same erythrocyte receptor during the invasion process. These results will be helpful in understanding P. vivax biology and developing the therapeutics for vivax malaria.

## Experimental dissection of tuberculosis protective immunity: a human perspective

date: 2025-06-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), has plagued humankind for millennia. Claiming 1.25 million lives in 2023, TB remains the worldwide leading cause of death from a single-infectious agent. Improved vaccines, diagnostics and treatment regimens for drug-susceptible and drug-resistant cases are paramount to attain the goals of the WHO’s End TB Strategy. Our knowledge gap in protective immunity in TB impedes the development of such new vaccines and host-directed interventions. Mtb is a pathogen highly adapted to humans and primarily infects the lungs. Access to relevant specimens is invasive, preventing ample human TB studies, which therefore mostly rely on peripheral blood specimens and biopsies. Thus, there is a need for relevant surrogates. In recent years, in vivo, in vitro, and in silico systems have arisen to approach and model different aspects of TB pathogenesis. Moving away from cell-line infections and classical animal models, TB research has advanced to genetically diverse mice, 3D organoid cultures and computational modelling. We will review current TB models and discuss their applicability to decipher protective human immunity, understand disease progression, transmission, as well as evaluate vaccine candidates and unravel host-directed therapeutic approaches.

## Effect of prone positioning on inflammatory markers in blood and lungs: a retrospective cohort study in COVID-19-related ARDS

date: 2025-06-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionProne positioning is a commonly recommended intervention in clinical practice to enhance oxygenation in COVID-19 patients with ARDS, but its effects on inflammatory markers in the blood and lungs have not been thoroughly investigated.MethodsThis retrospective study examined COVID-19-related ARDS patients admitted to the ICU of a tertiary hospital between January 2020 and November 2023. The analysis focused on measuring cytokines and lymphocyte subsets in both blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) to evaluate the impact of prone positioning on inflammatory markers in the lungs and systemic circulation.ResultsOf the 86 intubated patients, 44 were included in the study, with 30 undergoing prone positioning. Compared to the supine position, prone positioning was associated with elevated plasma levels of IL-12p70 and IL-4, as well as increased expression of IFN-α and TNF-α in BALF. With increased frequency of prone positioning, oxygenation progressively improved, accompanied by a rise in plasma IL-4 levels. No significant differences in peripheral blood lymphocyte levels were observed between the supine and prone groups.ConclusionThis study sheds light on the potential mechanisms of prone positioning in both local and systemic circulation, particularly in the context of inflammatory markers. In COVID-19-related ARDS, prone positioning may strengthen the immune response by modulating inflammatory markers in the lungs and bloodstream.

## The necessity and challenges of human papillomavirus testing for men

date: 2025-06-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Beyond its historical association with cervical cancer in women, human papillomavirus (HPV) infection poses a widespread health concern, particularly for men. Recent studies have highlighted the prevalence of HPV-related cancers, including penile and anal cancers, among the male population, making the case for male HPV testing all the more compelling. The potential for cross-infection between sexual partners underscores the need for comprehensive screening strategies. However, challenges still remain, such as the limited availability of testing methods and the absence of uniform medical guidelines, hampering effective HPV detection in men. Addressing these challenges through intensified research efforts and the revision of medical guidelines is crucial to enhancing prevention strategies and unlocking significant public health benefits.

## CD8+ T cells promote tubule-interstitial damage in malaria-induced acute kidney injury

date: 2025-06-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionMalaria acute kidney injury (MAKI) is associated with severe malaria and correlates with poor prognosis and death of patients infected with Plasmodium falciparum. The pathogenesis of MAKI is not completely understood but some hypotheses are well recognized. Host–parasite interactions lead to mechanical obstruction, disorders in the renal microcirculation, and immune-mediated glomerular injury. We investigated the influence of CD8⁺ T cells in the pathogenesis of malaria-induced renal disease.MethodsTo assess the role of T lymphocytes in MAKI pathogenesis, we used adoptive transfer; antibody-driven CD8+ T cells depletion and treatment with FYT720.ResultsThe transference of total T cells isolated from malaria-infected donor mice into naive recipient animals reproduced kidney tubule-interstitial damage without affecting glomerular function. It was associated with increased accumulation of CD8+ T cells in the kidneys of recipient mice. The selective depletion of CD8+ T cells in infected animals resulted in protection from tubular injury, although glomerular alterations still occurred. Finally, we evaluated FTY720, an immunomodulatory drug that sequesters T cells in lymphoid organs and limits their migration, as a potential therapeutic strategy. Treatment with FTY720 prevented the development of proteinuria and the increase in the urine to creatinine ratio. Moreover, FTY720 reduced urinary γ-glutamyl transferase (γ-GT) levels, a marker of tubular injury, but did not alter plasma urea and creatinine, two markers of glomerular function.DiscussionOur results add new knowledge demonstrating that CD8+ T cells have a specific role in tubule-interstitial injury pathology during MAKI.

## Rosuvastatin ameliorates obesity-associated insulin resistance in high-fat diet-fed mice by modulating the gut microbiota and gut metabolites

date: 2025-06-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionInsulin resistance (IR) underlies metabolic diseases such as obesity and diabetes. Statins are lipid-lowering drugs that have also been studied to improve insulin resistance, but the mechanism is not well understood. Metagenomics and metabolomics were used to analyze the main species and metabolic pathways involved in intestinal microbes while improving insulin resistance in mice with rosuvastatin in this study.MethodsC57BL/6J male mice fed a high-fat diet were used to establish the insulin resistance (IR) mouse model. Rosuvastatin (RSV) was then administered for 8 weeks. Metagenomics and metabolomics were utilized to analyze the microbial composition and short chain fatty acid metabolites in intestinal feces of mice.ResultsIt was observed that insulin-resistant mice showed significant improvement in insulin resistance following treatment with RSV. In comparison to the HFD group, specific bacterial strains were significantly increased, and the levels of butyric acid, caproic acid, and isovaleric acid among the short-chain fatty acids were notably elevated in the RSV group. Through KEGG enrichment analysis, 19 dominant strains and 15 key enzymes involved in butyric acid metabolism were identified.ConclusionsThe results suggested that IR mice might enhance insulin sensitivity by promoting butyric acid synthesis via intestinal microbes following RSV treatment.

## Biotherapeutic potential of different fractions of cell-free supernatants from Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus against Pseudomonas aeruginosa

date: 2025-06-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionDue to their content of multiple antimicrobial bioactive substances, cell-free supernatants (CFS) from lactic acid bacteria are emerging as novel antimicrobials. We have previously demonstrated that CFS from Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus exert strong antibacterial and antibiofilm activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from chronic infections. Herein, we sought to identify the CFS fraction(s) responsible for such activities and characterize the same CFS in terms of immunomodulatory properties and protein content.MethodsA P. aeruginosa clinical isolate was used in the study. CFS fractions were obtained by 3 kDa cut-off size-exclusion filtration. The antibacterial and antibiofilm activity of unfractionated and fractionated CFS was tested on planktonic and biofilm-associated P. aeruginosa using colony-forming unit enumeration, crystal violet staining, and confocal microscopy. Label-free qualitative proteomic was performed using a shotgun approach with mass spectrometry to characterize the protein content of the CFS. Additionally, the immunomodulatory effects of the CFS were evaluated on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) stimulated with P. aeruginosa lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or biofilm-derived P. aeruginosa cells.ResultsBoth antibacterial and antibiofilm activities were mainly, but not exclusively, ascribed to the low molecular weight CFS fraction (≤ 3 kDa), which contained most of the lactic acid, suggesting a major role of this component in the antimicrobial effect of CFS. The > 3 kDa fraction alone was almost inactive but displayed a synergistic antibacterial effect when reconstituted with the ≤ 3 kDa fraction. Proteomics analysis of CFS revealed the presence of cell wall hydrolases, suggesting that these enzymes might contribute to the antibacterial activity observed in the reconstituted fractions. Following 6 h stimulation of PBMC with LPS or biofilm-derived P. aeruginosa, a marked anti-inflammatory effect was exhibited by unfractionated CFS as well as ≤ 3kDa fraction at non-toxic concentrations, while the > 3kDa fraction was found to induce the production of IL-6, TNF-α, and to a lesser extent of IL-10.ConclusionThe obtained results support that, due to their multiple antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects, probiotic metabolites might represent a promising strategy for the prevention and/or treatment of chronic infections with an intense inflammatory response such as those caused by P. aeruginosa.

## Metabolomics and lipidomics of plasma biomarkers for tuberculosis diagnostics using UHPLC-HRMS

date: 2025-06-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionDetermining metabolic profiles during host-pathogen interactions is crucial for developing novel diagnostic tests and exploring the mechanisms underlying infectious diseases. However, the characteristics of the circulating metabolites and their functions after Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection have not been fully elucidated. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the differential metabolites in tuberculosis (TB) patients and explore the diagnostic value of these metabolites as potential biomarkers.MethodsSeventy-two TB patients and 78 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited as the training set, while 30 TB patients and 30 HCs were enrolled as the independent validation set. Metabolites in plasma samples were analyzed by high-resolution mass spectrometry. Differential metabolites were screened using principal component analysis and machine learning algorithms including LASSO, Random Forest, and XGBoost. The diagnostic accuracy of the core differential metabolites was evaluated. Pearson correlation analysis was performed.ResultThe metabolic profiling of TB patients showed significant separation from that of the HCs. In the training set, 282 metabolites were identified as differentially expressed in TB patients, with 214 metabolites validated in the independent validation cohort. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that the differential metabolites were mainly enriched in lipid metabolism. Seven core differential metabolites were identified by the three machine learning algorithms. Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that Angiotensin IV had high accuracy in diagnosing TB.ConclusionThese newly identified plasma metabolites are expected to serve as potentially valuable biomarkers for TB, potentially facilitating the diagnosis of the disease and enhancing the understanding of its underlying mechanisms.
