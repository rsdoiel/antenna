## Review: Dabbsson 2000L power station – compact, fast-charging, and ready for anything

Sometimes I use them simply when I’m too lazy to go find an extension cord! I recently got my hands on the new <a href="https://www.dabbsson.com/products/2000l-portable-power-station">Dabbsson 2000L</a> power station, and after putting it through its paces, I think this one’s going to earn a permanent spot in my gear lineup – and yes, probably a spot in my e-bike charging garage!</p>
