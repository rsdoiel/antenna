## Tesla does a rare ad and it’s pathetically misleading

date: 2025-08-11, from: Electrek Feed

<div class="feat-image"><img src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/08/Tesla-misleading-advertising.png?w=1600" /></div><p>Tesla is slowly starting to advertise, and it has now done a rare ad on a billboard in Los Angeles.

## Review: Dabbsson 2000L power station – compact, fast-charging, and ready for anything

date: 2025-08-11, from: Electrek Feed

<div class="feat-image"><img src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/08/dabbsson-head.jpg?quality=82&#038;strip=all&#038;w=1600" /></div><p>Portable power stations long ago became one of those “why didn’t I get one sooner?” products for me. Whether it’s keeping a fridge running during a power outage, charging cameras in the field, or juicing up my growing fleet of electric bikes, a good battery box is worth its weight in gold. Sometimes I use them simply when I’m too lazy to go find an extension cord! I recently got my hands on the new <a href="https://www.dabbsson.com/products/2000l-portable-power-station">Dabbsson 2000L</a> power station, and after putting it through its paces, I think this one’s going to earn a permanent spot in my gear lineup – and yes, probably a spot in my e-bike charging garage!</p>
