## New EV Totem from Blink could solve electric fuel’s biggest problem

date: 2025-08-13, from: Electrek Feed

<div class="feat-image"><img src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/08/Breezewood_Pennsylvania.jpg?quality=82&#038;strip=all&#038;w=1600" /></div><p>EV charging is everywhere now, and it’s reliable, accessible, and affordable. There are thousands of public chargers already out there – and, in some places, <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/03/21/california-50-percent-more-ev-chargers-than-gas-nozzles/">you’ll find more plugs than pumps</a>. But if you don’t drive electric, you’d never know it. That’s because gas stations don’t just exist, they announce themselves with giant, illuminated signs that can be seen for miles, while EV chargers tend to just sort of sit, nestled away in the back of the parking lot.</p>



<p>That’s why the new EV Totem from Blink Charging is such a big deal. It doesn’t just charge your car, it stands tall, lights up, and tells the world: <strong>electric fuel is here, now</strong>.</p>
