## “Tariff on the brain”

date: 2025-03-13, from: Market Place, Make me Smart

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In this episode, Kai and Kimberly divide into the back and forth over tariffs. The on-again, off-again levies are making it tough for industries to plan and trade. With all the uncertainty, are markets — from stocks to agriculture — on the verge of becoming untradable? Plus, we’ll wryly smile at a biting, century-old song about farmers who were ticked off about tariffs. (Thanks to our listener, Robert, for sharing his rendition!)</p>

Plus, more federal layoffs took place this past week, this time in the U.S. Department of Education and its civil rights division. Then, the hosts get smiley about rescue dogs in a sled dog race (thanks, Abigail!) and the birds in Kai&#8217;s neighborhood.</p>

## Unpacking our collective COVID-19 trauma, five years on

date: 2025-03-12, from: Market Place, Make me Smart

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Five years ago, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Since then, there have been lockdowns, a recession, two presidential elections and more than a million American lives lost from the disease. In many ways, life feels like it’s back to normal, but David Wallace-Wells, a writer for The New York Times, argues that the pandemic still has a grip on American life, from our faith in public health institutions to the way consumers feel about the economy. On the show today, Wallace-Wells walks us through how Americans neglected to process the seismic impact of the pandemic in the rush to recover from it, and how it&#8217;s left us more self-interested and less empathetic. Plus, how this can help explain disgruntled consumers and a growing appetite for risk-taking in the economy.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Then, we&#8217;ll get into how responses to public health emergencies have shifted to the realm of the private sector. And, we&#8217;ll hear listeners&#8217; reflections on the COVID-19 pandemic, five years on.</p>
