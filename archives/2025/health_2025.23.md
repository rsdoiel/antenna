## Microorganism changes in the gut of Apis mellifera surviving for the long term in Camellia oleifera forests

date: 2025-06-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Alpha-galactosides (oligosaccharides) in C. oleifera nectar and pollen cause honey bee larval rot and worker bloats. Honey bee colonies surviving in C. oleifera forests for a long period have low rates of larval rot and worker bloats; however, the mechanism of oligosaccharide metabolism is unclear. In this study, we used metagenomics and metabolomics to investigate the structure and function of the gut flora and the digestion characteristics of oligosaccharides in the gut of A. mellifera foragers (CN group) that had been in the C. oleifera forest for a long period (continuously for 14 years), and those that had not been pollinated with C. oleifera (N group) after 24 h of consumption of C. oleifera honey. The results revealed that the abundance of Gilliamella apicola up to 24.08%, which can metabolize α-galactoside (α-Gal), was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in the gut of foragers in the CN group than in the N group. Additionally, the gut flora of foragers in the CN group carried a significantly higher (P < 0.05) abundance of genes encoding α-galactosidase (Glycoside hydrolase family 4, GH4) than the N group. Similarly, metabolomic results indicated that the three toxic oligosaccharides in C. oleifera honey were lower in the gut of CN group foragers. These results suggest that the gut flora of A. mellifera, which inhabits oil tea forests for long periods of time, changes and adapts to the predominant ecological niche, enhancing the host’s ability to metabolize toxic oligosaccharides. This important discovery provides positive guidance for the subsequent directions for breeding of A. mellifera (G. apicola enrichment and GH4 upregulation), specialized in pollinating C. oleifera.

## Genomic evolution and dissemination of non-conjugative virulence plasmid of ST65 carbapenem-resistant and hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae strains in a Chinese hospital

date: 2025-06-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundThe global rise in infections caused by hypervirulent and carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CR-hvKp) represents a growing public health threat. This study investigates ST65 CR-hvKp strains, with a focus on their genomic attributes and the mechanisms underlying the transmission of non-conjugative virulence plasmids.MethodsTwo clinical K2-ST65 CR-hvKp isolates (P6 and P10) were identified. Plasmid conjugation experiments were performed to assess the dissemination of the virulence plasmid. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing and virulence assays, including serum resistance, siderophore production, and G. mellonella larvae infection models, were used to characterize resistance and virulence phenotypes. Comprehensive bioinformatic analyses were performed to explore genetic evolution.ResultsGenomic analyses showed that both P6 and P10 carry a non-conjugative virulence plasmid, a conjugative untyped KPC plasmid, and a conjugative IncM2 plasmid. These isolates displayed broad-spectrum anti-microbial resistance and multiple virulence phenotypes, although they failed to sustain both hypervirulence and carbapenem resistance over time. The IncM2 plasmid was shown to be essential for the transfer of non-conjugative virulence plasmid. Mechanistic studies highlighted IS26-mediated plasmid fusion and the role of IncM2 plasmids in mobilizing non-conjugative virulence plasmids. The resulting transconjugants exhibited multidrug resistance, enhanced capsule production, and increased siderophore production.ConclusionsThis study provides new insights into the genomic dynamics of ST65-CR-hvKp strains and uncovers key mechanisms, such as IS26-mediated plasmid fusion and IncM2-mediated mobilization, which facilitate the dissemination of non-conjugative virulence plasmids. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing effective strategies to manage and prevent the spread of these clinically challenging strains.

## Structural remodeling activates bacterial anti-phage immunity: insights from HerA-DUF4297

date: 2025-06-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

In response to phage infection, bacteria have evolved a variety of sophisticated immune defense systems to combat viral predation. Among these defense mechanisms, the transmission of immune signals via intracellular signal transduction molecules is a common strategy that often accompanies enzyme activity. Recent studies have characterized the HerA-DUF4297 protein complex, a two-component defense system that integrates ATPase and nuclease activities. This complex inhibits phage infection by inducing DNA degradation. Notably, DUF4297 displays minimal nuclease activity when it operates on its own. However, it demonstrates robust nuclease activity when in complex with HerA. Crucially, the nuclease activity within this complex is regulated by structural changes. These findings provide novel insights into the activation of bacterial immune systems against phages, suggesting that the architectural remodeling of protein complexes can serve as a mechanism for transmitting immune signals.

## Harnessing the microbiome to improve clinical outcomes for cancer, transplant, and immunocompromised patients in the intensive care unit (ICU)

date: 2025-06-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

In recent decades, there has been a growing emphasis on understanding how the architecture of the human microbiome can impact typical biological processes and patient clinical outcomes. In fact, microbiome modifications and modulations have not only been associated with impacts on general health and well-being but have also been shown to yield differences in patient responsiveness to vaccines, medications, and chemotherapeutic regimens. Much of this influence likely stems from how changes in the microbiome result in differences in microbial communities and the subsequent release of microbial-derived metabolites that can alter typical immunological processes. Understanding how microbial composition can impact patient responsiveness can be particularly important in the intensive care unit (ICU), where the efficacy of medications and treatments can result in negative patient outcomes if unsuccessful. Clinical scientists have further developed the concept of the pathobiome, a disease-promoting microbiome whose development can be associated with dysbiosis. Understanding how the microbiome and its associated components can impact patient responsiveness, especially in the ICU, must be further researched and understood. Here, we analyze what causes variances in the microbiome and pathobiome in significant immunocompromised populations, including cancer patients and transplant recipients, and how variances in the microbiome can impact patient outcomes in the ICU. Further, we detail potential future applications of how our understanding of what impacts the human microbiome during the treatment of these populations may be exploited to improve patient prognosis.

## Alterations in BCR heavy chain CDR3 repertoire characteristics in pediatric mycoplasma pneumoniae infection

date: 2025-06-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionMycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) infection is a leading cause of pediatric pneumonia, triggering a complex immune response in which B cells play a critical role. This study aimed to analyze B cell receptor (BCR) heavy chain CDR3 repertoires in MP patients.MethodsClinical data from 202 children diagnosed with MP were retrospectively analyzed. Flow cytometry was used to assess B cell counts in 99 MP patients and 25 healthy controls (HC). Multiplex PCR was used to construct BCR heavy chain CDR3 repertoires from peripheral blood samples of 8 MP patients and 9 HC.ResultsSerological analysis revealed elevated levels of inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and ferritin, indicating an active immune response. Flow cytometry showed significantly increased B cell counts in MP patients compared to HC. Immunoglobulin levels were elevated in several patients, indicating immune fluctuations during infection. BCR repertoire analysis revealed increased diversity and altered clonotype distribution in MP patients, with preferential usage of IGHV1-18, IGHV7-4-1, and IGHJ6. MP patients exhibited a bimodal distribution of CDR3 lengths, with significantly longer CDR3 regions. Sixty-eight MP-exclusive clonotypes were identified, with evidence of clonal expansion.ConclusionThese findings suggest that alterations in the BCR heavy chain CDR3 repertoire play a crucial role in the immune response to MP infection and may offer insight into disease progression and therapeutic targets.

## Effects of short-chain fatty acid-producing probiotic metabolites on symptom relief and intestinal barrier function in patients with irritable bowel syndrome: a double-blind, randomized controlled trial

date: 2025-06-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundIBS often appears as bloating, altered bowel patterns, and abdominal pain (AP).Probiotics and SCFA may be useful in mucosal repair and symptom relief, according to earlier research, however there is currently a lack of systematic evidence supporting their therapeutic effectiveness across a variety of IBS subtypes.ObjectiveTo investigate the impacts of probiotics on signs and intestinal barrier function (IBF) in individuals with multiple IBS subtypes, and evaluate the role of SCFA in this process.MethodsA double-blind randomized controlled trial (DBRCT) design was adopted. Using the Rome IV criteria, a total of 120 individuals with IBS were randomised to either the probiotic group (PG) or placebo group (PLG). The intervention lasted for 12 weeks with an additional 4-week follow-up. In addition to fecal SCFA (FSCFA) levels, intestinal permeability (L/M ratio), tight junction proteins (TJP), serum/fecal inflammatory markers, and adverse event occurrence, the primary endpoint (PEP) evaluated was IBS Symptom Severity Scale (IBS-SSS) scores. Subgroup analysis was performed in selected cases.ResultsIn terms of symptom scores, there was a major correlation among group and time (F=9.314, P<0.001), and repeated-measures ANOVA showed that the PG’s scores were considerably < than those of the control group (CG) beginning in week 8 (all P<0.01). Levels of acetate, propionate, and butyrate considerably increased after 12 weeks of intervention (all P<0.01). Intestinal permeability and Occludin significantly improved at weeks 8 and 12 (all P<0.0167), while important differences in Claudin-1 and Zonulin appeared only at week 12 (all P<0.0167). Inflammatory markers considerably decreased at week 12 (all P<0.0167). There were no statistically significant differences in adherence or adverse events (P>0.05). Reductions in symptom scores were positively connected with an increase in SCFAs (r=0.43, P=0.002). Subgroup analysis across multiple IBS subtypes indicated significant symptom relief at week 12 for all subtypes (all P<0.05).ConclusionProbiotics significantly improved clinical symptoms in IBS patients of different subtypes by increasing short-chain fatty acid levels, repairing the intestinal barrier, and reducing inflammation.

## Prevalence and molecular characterization of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Heyuan City in China

date: 2025-06-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

PurposeTuberculosis (TB) represents a significant global public health challenge, with China identified as a high-burden country. Data on the prevalence of drug resistance is crucial for informing the selection of appropriate pharmacological interventions for the treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB).To evaluate the prevalence and drug resistance patterns among patients with DR-TB in Heyuan City, China.MethodsAll 291 patients registered between April 2021 and March 2023 were tested for drug resistance, and information about their medical history and demographics was collected directly from the hospital’s computer database. Eight genes were analyzed for mutations associated with resistance to five antituberculosis drugs: the katG, ahpC, and inhA promoters for isoniazid (INH); rpoB for rifampicin (RIF); embB for ethambutol (EMB); gyrA for fluoroquinolones (FQs); and rrs and rpsL for streptomycin (STR). All strains were genotyped using fluorescence melting curve analysis.ResultsIn Heyuan, 24.4% (71/291) of patients with treatment-resistant TB were resistant to at least one drug. Following are the rates of general resistance to each drug: RIF (28/272, 10.29%), INH (38/274, 13.87%), FQs (10/259, 3.86%), EMB (20/248, 8.06%), and STR (15/150, 10.00%). Age or gender had no statistically significant impact on the likelihood of developing drug resistance. Nevertheless, a statistically significant difference was observed between the three strategies of drug resistance testing, AFB testing, and MTB antibody testing. There were 48 cases of single-drug resistance and 23 cases of multiple-drug resistance among the 71 drug-resistant patients. Eight genes had 127 altered nucleotide sequences, with KatG315 (20.47%) having the most significant incidence of mutations. The top three mutated genes were rpoB (32.28%), katG (23.62%), and embB (15.75%).ConclusionThese findings may be helpful in Heyuan City for the quick molecular identification of DR-TB isolates in clinical samples.

## The oncolytic avian reovirus p17 protein suppresses invadopodia formation via disruption of TKs5 complexes and oncogenic signaling pathways

date: 2025-06-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundAvian reovirus (ARV) is an oncolytic virus that induces autophagy and apoptosis in cancer cells, modulates the immune response, and exposes tumor-associated antigens to the immune system, making it a promising candidate for cancer therapy. Cancer cell migration and invadopodia formation are essential processes in metastasis, and targeting these mechanisms could be beneficial in limiting cancer progression.MethodsThis study investigated the effects of ARV p17 protein on cancer cell migration and invadopodia formation in HeLa and A549 cell lines. Molecular assays were conducted to examine the expression and interactions of key signaling molecules, including nucleoporin Tpr, p53, PTEN, FAK, Src, Rab40b, PI3K, Akt, TKs5, and Nck1. Analysis of TKs5, Nck1, and Rab40b mRNA levels by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Furthermore, invadopodia detection, gelatin degradation assay, and Fluorescence imaging was performed to visualize invadopodia structures and assess extracellular matrix degradation. Additionally, rescue experiments were performed by co-transfecting cells with mutant PTEN (C124A), TKs5, or Rab40b plasmids to confirm their roles in mediating the effects of p17.Resultsp17 suppressed nucleoporin Tpr, resulting in the activation of p53 and upregulation of PTEN. This blocked the formation of the FAK-Src complex and inhibited the Rab40b-PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. p17 also transcriptionally downregulated TKs5, Nck1, and Rab40b, thereby reducing the formation of TKs5-Nck1 and TKs5-Rab40b complexes, which are critical for invadopodia formation. Fluorescence imaging confirmed a marked reduction in invadopodia formation and matrix degradation in cells expressing p17. Restoration of invadopodia formation upon co-transfection with mutant PTEN, TKs5, or Rab40b confirmed that these molecules are key mediators of p17’s inhibitory effects.ConclusionARV p17 inhibits cancer cell migration and invadopodia formation by activating the p53-PTEN pathway and suppressing essential signaling and scaffolding complexes (FAK-Src, Rab40b-PI3K-Akt, TKs5-Nck1, and TKs5-Rab40b). These findings suggest that p17 plays a crucial anti-metastatic role and may serve as a novel therapeutic agent for targeting invasive cancer cells.

## The significance of metagenomic next-generation sequencing and targeted next-generation sequencing in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with suspected pulmonary infections

date: 2025-06-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectiveTo investigate the diagnostic value of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) and targeted next-generation sequencing (tNGS) in identifying pathogens in patients with pulmonary infections.MethodsA retrospective analysis was conducted on 155 patients with suspected lung infections who underwent alveolar lavage and were admitted to the Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine at Baodi Hospital, Tianjin Medical University, from July 2023 to December 2023. The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples obtained were subjected to mNGS, tNGS and culture methods to compare their diagnostic efficacy in identifying lung infection pathogens.ResultsThe results indicated that both tNGS and mNGS methods exhibit comparable detection efficiencies in identifying pathogens in patients with pulmonary infections, significantly outperforming BALF culture approach. In terms of diagnostic accuracy, tNGS exhibited a higher sensitivity than mNGS, with rates of 96.1% and 75.7% respectively (P>0.05). However, the specificity of tNGS was slightly lower than that of mNGS, with rates of 59.1% and 68.2% respectively (P>0.05). It is noteworthy that this difference in specificity was not statistically significant.ConclusiontNGS exhibits a diagnostic efficacy comparable to mNGS, particularly in its sensitivity for identifying lung infections, as evidenced by expert insights and clinical applications. Furthermore, tNGS offers advantages in convenience, time efficiency, and cost-effectiveness, hinting at its potential to serve as an alternative to mNGS in clinical settings.

## Epidemiological trends of influenza A and B in one hospital in Chengdu and national surveillance data (2019–2024)

date: 2025-06-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundInfluenza A (Flu A) and Influenza B (Flu B) are major contributors to seasonal epidemics, causing significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Understanding their epidemiological trends is essential for optimizing prevention and control strategies.ObjectiveThis study aims to analyze the epidemiological trends of Flu A and Flu B, compare hospital-based and national surveillance data, and evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on influenza transmission to provide scientific evidence for influenza control measures.MethodsWe analyzed influenza positivity rates from Sichuan Jinxin Xinan Women and Children Hospital data (HD) and Chinese National Influenza Center (CNIC) between 2019 and 2024. Temporal trends, subtype distributions, and the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were assessed.ResultsInfluenza activity exhibited significant temporal variations. In HD, the highest cumulative positivity rate of Flu A + Flu B was observed in 2023 (31.9%), whereas the lowest rate occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020–2022), with a nadir in 2021 (2.0%). Flu A remained the predominant subtype in HD except in 2021, whereas CNIC data showed a relatively higher proportion of Flu B. Weekly positivity rates displayed distinct seasonal trends in CNIC data but not in HD. A comparative analysis of pre-pandemic (2019), pandemic (2020–2022), and post-pandemic (2023–2024) phases indicated that NPIs had a stronger suppressive effect on Flu A than on Flu B.ConclusionHospital-based and national influenza surveillance data showed heterogeneity in subtype proportions, seasonal trends, and pandemic-related impacts. These findings underscore the importance of integrating multiple surveillance sources for a comprehensive understanding of influenza dynamics. Enhancing vaccine coverage, implementing targeted public health interventions, and optimizing resource allocation are crucial for mitigating the influenza burden in the post-pandemic era.

## Neurodevelopmental disorders and gut-brain interactions: exploring the therapeutic potential of pycnogenol through microbial-metabolic-neural networks

date: 2025-06-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), characterized by cognitive impairments and behavioral abnormalities, represent a clinically diverse group of conditions typically emerging during childhood or adolescence. Major subtypes encompass autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and epilepsy. The pathogenesis of these disorders involves multifactorial interactions between genetic susceptibility (Shank3 mutations in ASD), environmental triggers (prenatal toxins), neurotransmitter dysregulation (dopamine (GA) and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) systems) and immune dysregulation. Growing research highlights the gut-brain axis disruption as a potential contributor to NDDs pathophysiology, though systematic evaluation of therapeutic approaches targeting this axis and related gastrointestinal comorbidities (GIDs) remains limited. This review comprehensively examines the pathological mechanisms underlying ADHD, ASD, and epilepsy, while analyzing the reciprocal relationship between gut-brain axis dysregulation and GID manifestations in NDDs. Notably, abnormal activation of key signaling pathways including NF-κB, MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR is strongly associated with the pathogenesis of NDDs. We further propose pycnogenol (PYC), a polyphenol extract of pine bark, as a natural compound with multiple bioactivities such as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant, can directly or indirectly affect the function of the gut-brain axis by regulating the structure of the intestinal microbial community (increasing the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila and butyric acid-producing bacteria) and its metabolites, providing a new strategy for the treatment of NDDs.

## AliC and AliD of nonencapsulated Streptococcus pneumoniae enhance virulence in a Galleria mellonella model of infection by contributing to reactive oxygen species resistance

date: 2025-06-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionNonencapsulated Streptococcus pneumoniae (NESp) are isolated worldwide. Due to the lack of capsule in NESp strains the current vaccines, that target the pneumococcal capsule are ineffective. Some NESp contain the oligopeptide transporters AliC and AliD which are required for virulence through unknown mechanisms. AliC and AliD have been previously shown to reduce rates of phagocytosis and alter the transcriptome and proteome of MNZ41. We hypothesize that oligopeptide regulated genes are responsible for reduced phagocytosis and increased survival through resistance to reactive oxygen species (ROS).MethodsTo test this a mutant library of AliC and AliD regulated genes was used in in vitro and in vivo models. ROS resistance was tested through quantifying bacterial counts after exposure to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). A modified surface killing assay was also used to calculate resistance to phagocytosis of our mutant library. A Galleria mellonella larvae model of infection was used to determine survival curve analyses.ResultsTwo mutant genes in our library, ∆lytFN1 (CDT04) and ∆mgtC (CDT05), displayed greater sensitivity to H2O2 killing and phagocytosis compared to wildtype MNZ41. Deletion of AliD in an AliD-expressing encapsulated strain reduced virulence.ConclusionThis research demonstrates that proteins encoded by genes regulated by AliC and AliD alter susceptibility to host-derived mechanisms for bacterial clearance and increases bacterial survival in response to ROS.

## Rapidly progressive pulmonary abscess initially misdiagnosed as lung cancer: the role of Peptostreptococcus stomatis and Parvimonas micra

date: 2025-06-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Pulmonary abscess is a serious infectious disease characterized by localized lung tissue necrosis, primarily caused by anaerobic or facultative anaerobic bacterial infections. While the Streptococcus anginosus group (SAG) is a well-established pathogen in pulmonary abscess formation, recent findings suggest that strict anaerobes such as Peptostreptococcus stomatis and Parvimonas micra can also contribute to deep-seated infections. However, their role in rapidly progressive pulmonary abscesses has not been previously documented. Here, we present a case of a rapidly progressive pulmonary abscess caused by Peptostreptococcus stomatis and Parvimonas micra in an immunocompetent patient, initially misdiagnosed as lung cancer. This case highlights the importance of differentiating infectious lung lesions from malignancies and underscores the clinical utility of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) in diagnosing rare anaerobic infections, offering valuable insights for precise diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

## The activity of cell-free supernatant of Lactobacillus crispatus M247: a promising treatment against vaginal infections

date: 2025-06-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Lactobacillus crispatus is renowned for its antimicrobial properties, and some strains are used to treat vaginal dysbiosis, although the mechanisms underlying the antimicrobial properties remain elusive. We isolated L. crispatus M247 (LcM247) from a commercially available probiotic product Crispact® and tested its antimicrobial activity against selected pathobionts such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis and Candida albicans using both cocultures and testing the antimicrobial activity of cell-free supernatant (CFS) obtained from the culture of the probiotic strain. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CFS antimicrobial activity is pH dependent and that it is not affected by temperature and proteinase K treatment. Proteomic analysis suggests that this activity is mediated by S-layer secreted proteins. In a series of in vitro infection models, we infected Henrietta Lacks’ cervical eukaryotic cancer cells (HeLa) with E. coli, S. agalactiae and C. albicans at specific multiplicities of infection (MOIs) before the administration of LcM247, CFS, gentamicin or fluconazole alone or in combination with LcM247/CFS. We observed a slight decrease in the microbial burden following LcM247 administration, while treatment with CFS significantly reduced microbial growth compared to control and antimicrobial compounds. These results highlight the antimicrobial properties of LcM247 and its CFS and the likely mechanism of action that contributes to the eradication of common pathobionts. We show that actively replicating LcM247 is less efficient than its CFS, so the oral administration of LcM247 may result in treatment failure. Finally, the use of CFS may result in an upswing of the host Lactobacillus strains and promote the engraftment of Lactobacillus probiotic treatments.

## The emerging roles of ubiquitin-like modifications in regulating HIV replication and host defense

date: 2025-06-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

As a post-translational modification (PTM) mechanism analogous to ubiquitination, ubiquitin-like (UBL) modification plays a crucial regulatory role in virus-host interactions. With the increasing discovery of UBL modification types, their roles in diverse biological process, including HIV infection, have gained growing attention. Rather than merely serving as anti-HIV defenses or being exploited by the virus, UBLs often exert dual roles by modulating both host restriction factors and viral proteins, thereby impacting key steps of HIV life cycle, immune evasion, and intracellular signaling. This article summarizes recent advances on the contribution of UBLs in regulating HIV replication and host defense, highlighting their indispensable roles in arms races between HIV and host, aiming to provide a theoretical framework for developing novel therapeutic strategies against HIV-1 targeting virus-host interactions.

## In vivo RNA-seq and infection model reveal the different infection and immune characteristics of B. pertussis strains in China

date: 2025-06-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionVarious strains emerged in B. pertussis re-emergence, the pathogenic characteristics and mechanisms remain elusive. We aimed to explore the relationship between the in vivo transcriptome and colonization advantage of various pertussis clinical strains during the B. pertussis re-emergence.MethodsFour pertussis strains were isolated from clinically suspected cases by active surveillance. The phylogenetic relationships of clinical strains and global isolates were compared by a genome-wide SNP-based phylogenetic tree and allele genotyping. LC-MS/MS analysis and binding affinity detection allowed the identification of expression and antigenicity of pertactin. The characteristics of infection and immunity of clinical strains were compared in a BALB/c mouse aerosol challenge model. In vivo RNA-seq analysis was performed in NSG mouse model to describe the transcriptome during infection, and verified by detecting biofilm formation and paraquat tolerance.ResultsThe partial pertactin-deficient strain BP-L2 was first reported. It showed significantly enhanced tracheal colonization compared to both CS and BP-L1 strains in naive mice (P < 0.0001 vs. CS) and exhibited superior fitness over BP-L1 in immunized mice (P < 0.001). BP-L1 showed superior lung colonization (P < 0.0001) and tissue-resident memory T cell induction versus BP-L2 and CS (P < 0.001). Colonization dominance of BP-L1 in lungs and BP-L2 in trachea aligned with the pathological injury (P < 0.05) and the inflammatory cytokine enhancement (IL-6 in lungs of BP-L1 group, P < 0.01). In vivo RNA-seq results revealed that BP-L2 significantly upregulated relA (log2FC = 2.1, FDR P-value = 0.019) and sodA (log2FC =2.4, FDR P-value = 8.61E-06) compared to BP-L1, functionally linked to enhanced stringent response and oxidative stress defense. BP-L1 exhibited significant in vivo bipA upregulation over BP-L2 (log2FC = 1.8, FDR P-value = 0.027) without concurrent biofilm enhancement (P = 0.51 vs. BP-L2). Furthermore, the BP-L2 and BP-L3 strains of the same ptxP1-ptxA1-fhaB3 lineage showed significantly higher paraquat tolerance than other strains (P < 0.001), showing extremely high SODs activity.ConclusionThe emerging pertussis strains exhibit different colonization advantages in the trachea or lungs, which will influence the transmission patterns of the clinical strains. The tracheal colonization advantage of the partial pertactin-deficient strain may be associated with the overexpression of the relA and sodA in vivo infection.

## Establishment of an infectious clone of the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus and a study on the location and function of accessory protein 3

date: 2025-06-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionTransmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), as the causative agent of TGE, causes huge economic losses in the pig industry worldwide.MethodsIn this study, we successfully constructed a reverse genetic system for the TGEV TH-98 strain and rescued the recombinant virus rTH-98-Δ3-COE-HA based on this system.ResultsThe results showed that ORF3 is a non-structural protein and does not exist in mature virions. Therefore, rTH-98-Δ3-COE-HA induced inflammatory cytokine expression in IPEC-J2 cells, but the expression levels were significantly lower than those triggered by TH-98 and rTH-98, indicating that TGEV ORF3 may play a critical role in inducing the host immune response. To detect whether the exogenous protein expressed in the rTH-98-Δ3-COE-HA has immunogenicity, the results showed that the levels of antibodies were significantly increased in mice. rTH-98-Δ3-COE-HA can induce a specific immune response in the host body against its expressed exogenous proteins.Discussion and conclusionOur study provides important clues for revealing the role of ORF3 in virus replication and pathogenesis, laying a theoretical and material foundation for the construction of recombinant viral multi-valent vaccines.

## Veillonella parvula outer membrane vesicles increase ICAM-1+ neutrophils exhibiting elevated NET formation via ROS–PAD4 signaling

date: 2025-06-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundVeillonella parvula (V. parvula), as an anaerobic Gram-negative coccus, produces outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) to promote bacterial colonization and periodontitis progress. Neutrophils are the first immune cells during bacterial stimulation, while neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are the early triggers in the progress of periodontitis. However, the interactions between neutrophils and V. parvula are still unknown. Therefore, this study investigated the effects and underlying mechanisms of V. parvula OMVs on neutrophils.MethodsNeutrophil migration, apoptosis, and phagocytosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were assessed following stimulation with V. parvula OMVs. The differential gene expression in neutrophils was characterized using RNA sequencing. The correlation between intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) expression and NET formation was verified through flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. The NET formation-associated components, including cell-free DNA, neutrophil elastase, myeloperoxidase, and the PAD4 expression were analyzed. The frequencies of the ICAM-1+ neutrophils and NET formation were evaluated in neutrophils pretreated with CYBB or PAD4 inhibitors.ResultsNeutrophils exhibited robust migration, increased apoptosis, and ROS production following exposure to V. parvula OMVs. No significant differences were observed in neutrophil phagocytosis. RNA sequencing analysis revealed a significant increase in the expression of Icam-1 mRNA. And higher ICAM-1+ neutrophils in the V. parvula OMVs group enhanced the levels of NET formation via activation of ROS-PAD4 signaling pathway.ConclusionsV. parvula OMVs were initially found to increase the population of ICAM-1+ neutrophils, which subsequently exhibited elevated NET formation via the ROS–PAD4 signaling pathway. This study elucidates a novel pathogenic mechanism of V. parvula OMVs and highlights the potential of targeting ICAM-1+ neutrophils as a therapeutic approach for chronic periodontitis.

## Proteomic analysis of outer membrane vesicles derived from the type A5 Strain of Mannheimia haemolytica

date: 2025-06-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Mannheimia haemolytica (M. haemolytica) cause mastitis in sheep, acute sepsis in newborn lambs, and co-infections with various pathogens, leading to bovine respiratory disease syndrome (BRDS), these infections have resulted in significant economic losses to both domestic and international farming industries. An in-depth understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of M. haemolytica is crucial for the prevention and control of this disease. Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) play a vital role in bacterial pathogenesis, serving as key mediators of interactions between Gram-negative bacteria and their hosts. However, the specific role of OMVs in the pathogenic process of M. haemolytica remains poorly understood. To address this, we isolated OMVs from the Mannheimia haemolytica Type A5 strain (MH-5) using ultracentrifugation and subsequently characterized their secretory properties, protein composition, and immunogenicity through electron microscopy, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and cellular experiments. The electron microscopy results indicated that the MH-5 strain secreted OMVs under natural growth conditions. Proteomic and bioinformatics analyses revealed that these OMVs contained 282 proteins, with significant enrichment in proteins related to immunity, iron metabolism, and catalytic activity. Cellular experiments demonstrated that, compared to the control group, the OMVs group exhibited a significant increase in the mRNA expression of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, with secretion levels increasing in a dose-dependent manner, thereby enhancing the inflammatory response. These findings lay the groundwork for further exploration of the role of OMVs in the pathogenesis of M. haemolytica and provide insights for the development of effective vaccines and antibiotics against this pathogen.

## Prevalence and related factors of TB/HIV co-infection among hospitalized children with tuberculosis in Southwest China

date: 2025-06-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectivesThis study aimed to investigate the prevalence of TB/HIV co-infection in pediatric TB patients in southwest China and its associated variables.MethodsPediatric TB patients were recruited from January 2014 to September 2024 in southwest China, based on etiology or clinical confirmation. Hospitalization records were extracted for each patient.ResultsAmong 2,607 pediatric TB patients with an average age of 9.58 ± 4.08 years, 39 (1.5%) were HIV-positive. The TB/HIV co-infection group male-to-female ratio was 2:1, higher than the TB-only group 1.19:1. The highest proportion of TB/HIV co-infection was in the 5-9 years age group (43.6%), while the 10-14 years age group accounted for the highest proportion of TB-alone cases (57.5%). In terms of population distribution, the Yi ethnic group had the highest proportion of TB/HIV co-infection cases (43.6%), while the Tibetan group had the highest proportion of TB-alone cases (51.1%). Extrapulmonary TB in the TB/HIV co-infection group primarily involved abdominal and pericardial sites, whereas the TB-alone infection group had more cases of lymphadenitis and pleural TB. The length of hospitalization (>14 days) in the TB/HIV co-infection group (74.4%) was significantly longer than in the TB-alone infection group (51.7%). Over the past 11 years, most pediatric TB/HIV co-infection cases were from the eastern-central and southern-central regions of Sichuan, particularly the southern Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture. The number of children with TB-alone infections increased gradually during this period. No significant difference in the number of pediatric TB/HIV co-infection cases was observed over the 11 years.ConclusionPediatric TB/HIV co-infection in southwest China predominantly affects middle-aged and young boys, with a higher co-infection rate than the national average. The central and southern regions of Sichuan have a relatively high proportion of cases. Public health efforts should focus on strengthening awareness, screening, and early diagnosis of TB and HIV in children in high-risk areas to prevent further infections.

## Characteristics of metabolites analysis for patients with granulomatous lobular mastitis

date: 2025-06-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundGranulomatous lobular mastitis (GLM) is a type of non-puerperal mastitis (NPM) associated with autoimmune factors. Previous studies suggest that gut microbiota dysbiosis may play a role in the pathological process of GLM; however, the specific role of gut microbiota metabolites in this process remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the gut metabolic characteristics of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) in patients with GLM, a type of NPM.MethodsStool samples were collected from 35 patients with GLM and 26 healthy control (HC) subjects. These samples underwent targeted metabolomic analysis to measure SCFA and 16s rRNA high-throughput sequencing to assess gut microbiota composition and differences between the groups.ResultsGas chromatography-mass spectrometry(GC-MS) analysis revealed that the content of SCFA-butanoic acid in the feces of patients with GLM was higher than that in the HC group. Notably, significant differences in metabolic pathways were observed between the HC and GLM groups. High-throughput sequencing results showed that the richness and diversity of gut microbiota in patients with GLM were significantly lower than those in healthy individuals. In addition, 53 bacterial species were found to differ significantly in abundance between the two groups. Moreover, the level of isohexanoic acid in the feces of patients with GLM with recurrence disease was significantly higher than that of patients without recurrence.ConclusionsPatients with GLM exhibit disturbances in gut butanoic acid metabolism and significant differences in gut microbiota structure compared to healthy individuals.

## Oncogenic viruses rewire the epigenome in human cancer

date: 2025-06-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Viruses contribute to approximately 15–20% of global cancer cases, yet the full spectrum of their oncogenic mechanisms continues to be uncovered. Beyond the classical roles of genome integration, chronic inflammation, and immune evasion, mounting evidence reveals that oncogenic viruses—including the human papillomavirus (HPV), Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1)—profoundly reshape the host epigenome to establish persistent infection and promote tumorigenesis. These viruses orchestrate widespread and durable changes in DNA methylation, histone modification, chromatin accessibility, and non-coding RNA expression, silencing tumor suppressors, deregulating oncogenic pathways, and inducing stemness-like phenotypes. In this review, we provide a comprehensive synthesis of how distinct oncogenic viruses modulate the epigenetic landscape across tissue contexts, with a focus on cervical, hepatic, and lymphoepithelial cancers. We also explore how these virus-induced epigenetic “scars” may persist after viral clearance and highlight recent advances in therapeutic targeting. Emerging therapeutic strategies that integrate oncolytic virotherapy, epigenetic drugs, and immune modulation through combinational therapy offer synergistic mechanisms to overcome immune resistance and epigenetic silencing in virus-induced cancers. These integrated approaches hold transformative potential for more durable and targeted treatment outcomes.

## Evaluation of Beauvericin’s activity and mode of action against all life stages of L. tropica for cutaneous Leishmaniasis therapy

date: 2025-06-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundLeishmaniasis, particularly its cutaneous form caused by Leishmania tropica, remains a significant global health concern due to the limitations of current treatments, including drug resistance, toxicity, and inconsistent efficacy. This study investigates the potential of Beauvericin (BEA), a fungal secondary metabolite, as an alternative antileishmanial agent.ObjectivesThis study investigates the potential of Beauvericin (BEA), a fungal secondary metabolite, as an alternative antileishmanial agent.MethodsWe assessed the efficacy of BEA against different developmental stages of L. tropica using in vitro assays and an in vivo Galleria mellonella infection model. The ability of L. tropica to develop resistance to BEA and its effects on the parasite’s gene expression profile were also examined.ResultsBEA exhibited potent antileishmanial activity with equipotency across both promastigote and amastigote stages of L. tropica, with IC50 values of 0.25 µM and 0.27 µM, respectively, significantly lower than those of miltefosine. Mechanistically, BEA acts as a calcium ionophore, inducing a marked increase in intracellular calcium levels, which serves as the primary cytotoxic event. Transcriptomic profiling further revealed that BEA-induced calcium dysregulation triggers secondary cellular responses involving calcium homeostasis, lipid metabolism, and stress response, contributing to its multifaceted mechanism of action. The G. mellonella model demonstrated that BEA significantly reduced parasite burden, improved survival rates. Notably, BEA showed a slower rate of resistance development compared to ML, indicating its potential as a more sustainable treatment option.ConclusionsBEA is a promising candidate for antileishmanial therapy, demonstrating superior efficacy, a broad mechanism of action, and a favorable resistance profile compared to ML. Further investigations in mammalian models are warranted to validate BEA’s potential as a novel, cost-effective treatment for leishmaniasis.

## Fungi and cancer: unveiling the complex role of fungal infections in tumor biology and therapeutic resistance

date: 2025-06-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Cancer remains one of the most significant causes of mortality across the world. Despite remarkable advancements made in early detection, therapeutic strategies, and the advent of immunotherapy in recent years, numerous challenges continue to hinder optimal outcomes. The development and progression of cancer are driven not only by genetic and epigenetic alterations within tumor cells but also by dynamic interactions occurring with the surrounding tumor microenvironment (TME). It is a highly complex milieu composed of tumor cells, non-tumor stromal cells, extracellular matrix components, immune cells, blood vessels, and diverse signaling molecules. Emerging evidence underscores the pivotal role of fungi in influencing cancer biology, including initiation, progression, immune evasion, and the modulation of TME. Fungi, which are omnipresent microorganisms, have traditionally been considered opportunistic pathogens. However, recent research highlights their broader impact on host immunity and their potential contributions to cancer pathogenesis. For instance, in patients with cancer, fungal infections not only exacerbate clinical complications but also create conditions conducive to tumor growth, metastasis, and immune escape by altering the immune microenvironment. In addition, fungal-derived metabolites and their interactions with host immune pathways can significantly modulate the efficacy of immunotherapies. These findings have spurred interest in exploring antifungal strategies as adjunctive approaches in cancer management, positioning antifungal therapy as a burgeoning area of oncological research. This review provides an in-depth exploration of the complex interplay between fungi and cancer. It examines the multifaceted role of fungal infections in tumor biology, the mechanisms through which fungi reshape the TME through immune modulation and their influence on immune-evasion strategies and therapeutic resistance. Furthermore, the potential for integrating antifungal therapies into comprehensive cancer treatment regimens has been highlighted, offering insights into novel avenues for improving patient outcomes.

## Predicting gut microbiota dynamics in obese individuals from cross-sectional data

date: 2025-06-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionObesity affects approximately 39% of adults worldwide. While gut microbiota has been linked to obesity, most research has focused on static taxonomic composition rather than the dynamic interactions between microbial taxa.MethodsWe applied BEEM-Static, a generalized Lotka-Volterra model, to cross-sectional 16S rRNA gut microbiome data from six public datasets, comprising 2,435 profiles from lean and obese individuals.ResultsA total of 57 significant microbial interactions were identified in obese individuals (79% negative), compared to 37 in lean individuals (92% negative). For example, Bacteroidetes showed a stronger inhibitory effect on Firmicutes in obese individuals (−0.41) than in lean ones (−0.26). Firmicutes and Proteobacteria exhibited consistently higher carrying capacities in obese populations.DiscussionThese findings suggest that microbial interaction networks—not just taxonomic abundance—play a key role in obesity-related dysbiosis. Our approach enables the inference of microbiota dynamics from a single time point, paving the way for tailored dietary interventions, which we refer to as Optibiomics.

## Comparison of the diagnostic capabilities of tNGS and mNGS for pathogens causing lower respiratory tract infections: a prospective observational study

date: 2025-06-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

AimsPathogens in lower respiratory tract infections(LRTI) are complex. Conventional microbiological testings(CMTs) are time-consuming and inaccurate. mNGS is widely used to overcome these issues. tNGS, as an emerging NGS technology, has uncertain diagnostic efficacy.Materials and methods136 suspected LRTI patients were included from January 2022 to February 2024 from the Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine at Jiangsu Province People’s Hospital,China.We simultaneously submitted the bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALFs) for mNGS, tNGS and conventional microbial testing (CMTs) and compared the pathogen diagnostic efficacy of mNGS, and tNGS.ResultsA total of 136 patients were included, and there was no statistically significant difference in the detection sensitivity(74.75% VS 78.64%, p>0,05) and specificity(81.82% vs 93,94%,p>0.05) between mNGS and tNGS. However, tNGS has a higher sensitivity(27.94% vs 17.65%,p=0.043)and specificity(88.78% vs 84.82%,p=0.048) for fungi. According to our diagnostic criteria, tNGS successfully identified 3 cases of Pneumocystis jirovecii(P. jirovecii) individually. In addition, both tNGS and mNGS detected chlamydia psittaci whereas CMTs were unable to detect it.ConclusionstNGS demonstrates diagnostic efficacy for pathogens in lower respiratory tract infections that is comparable to mNGS. However, tNGS has specific advantages in the detection of fungi. Considering the cost-effectiveness of tNGS, it is recommended to implement tNGS clinically for patients with lower respiratory tract infections.

## Transcriptomic profiling reveals RetS-mediated regulation of type VI secretion system and host cell responses in Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections

date: 2025-06-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a major opportunistic pathogen that causes chronic infections, particularly in patients with cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a primary virulence factor of P. aeruginosa in chronic infections. The objective of this study was to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms and pathogenic effects of the T6SS during P. aeruginosa infection, utilizing transcriptome sequencing and functional assays. We found that T6SS expression is elevated in P. aeruginosa isolated from chronically infected patients. Deletion of the retS gene activates P. aeruginosa PAO1 T6SS while repressing T3SS in vitro. Bacterial and cellular transcriptome sequencing analyses showed that T6SS genes were upregulated, while T3SS genes were downregulated in the ΔretS mutant. Additionally, the expression levels of the fimbriae gene cupC, the histidine phosphotransfer protein hptC (PA0033), and the transcription factor PA0034 were significantly increased. Subsequent experiments revealed that adhesion mediated by cupC enhances the contact-killing activity of the T6SS. Deletion of the hptC-PA0034 operon results in the down-regulation of cupC expression. The ΔretSΔcupC and ΔretSΔhptC-PA0034 mutants exhibited reduced cytotoxicity compared to the ΔretS mutant, similar to the ΔretSΔclpV1ΔclpV2 mutant. The ΔretS infection increased cell death, inflammatory factors (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α), and reactive oxygen species compared to a T6SS-inactive strain. Importantly, our study demonstrates that the T6SS activates the PDE4C pathway in epithelial cells, leading to significant cellular alterations. The application of PDE inhibitors effectively mitigates cell damage and inflammatory responses. These findings highlight the critical role of T6SS in modulating host cell signaling and suggest potential therapeutic strategies for conditions associated with T6SS-mediated inflammation.

## Real-world pharmacovigilance reports of hepatitis A inactivated and hepatitis B (recombinant) vaccine: insights from disproportionality analysis of the vaccine adverse event reporting system

date: 2025-06-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundHepatitis A Inactivated and Hepatitis B (Recombinant) Vaccine (Hep AB) was approved for use in 2001. Hep AB demonstrates satisfactory efficacy in protecting the public from hepatitis virus infections. However, there is a lack of recent real-world report on its adverse events (AEs).MethodsWe retrieved US AE reports related to Hep AB vaccination from VAERS for the period 2020-2024. We used four algorithms: Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR), Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) and Multi-Item Gamma-Poisson Shrinkage (MGPS) to examine AE signals. The ROR and PRR algorithms have higher sensitivity but lower specificity. However, BCPNN and MGPS compensate for this limitation. Combining all four algorithms helps reduce false-positive signals. In addition to the general population, we also focused on reports stratified by gender.ResultsWe retrieved 1,640 eligible reports from VAERS. In the general population, we identified two AE signals at the System Organ Classification (SOC) level. Additionally, we found 39 AE signals at the Preferred Term (PT) level. Among these, endocrine disorders were identified for the first time as AE signals. In the subsequent gender stratified analysis, more AE signals were identified in females compared to males. Notably, signals for endocrine disorders (autoimmune thyroiditis and Graves’ disease) were detected in females, whereas no such signals were found in males.ConclusionsWe conducted a comprehensive examination of the recent AE reports for Hep AB and identified unexpected AEs, particularly in females. These findings will provide valuable insights into future evidence-based surveillance strategies of Hep AB.

## Clinical and diagnostic insights into brucellar arthritis: a single-center retrospective cohort study

date: 2025-06-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundThis study evaluates the diagnostic value of etiological and serological testing in distinguishing brucellosis arthropathy from other inflammatory joint diseases.MethodsA retrospective analysis was conducted on 68 cases of brucellosis arthropathy diagnosed between 2012 and 2024, alongside 60 non-infected controls. Bacterial cultures were performed using blood, joint fluid-blood bottle culture, and joint tissue samples, with microbial identification via VITEK Compact-II or MALDI-TOF MS. Clinical features, serological results (Standard Agglutination Test [SAT] and Rose Bengal Test [RBT]), and imaging findings were analyzed. The diagnostic performance of biomarkers was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.ResultsAmong the 68 cases, 22 (32.4%) were confirmed by bacterial culture, with Brucella melitensis identified as the causative agent. Joint fluid-blood bottle culture was the most effective method (62.2%), with a mean detection time of 74.8 ± 17.9 hours (range: 41–110 hours) in aerobic bottles. Blood culture and joint tissue culture yielded positive results in 40.9% and 4.5% of cases, respectively. Brucellosis arthropathy accounted for 7.5% of total brucellosis cases, predominantly affecting males (67.6%) with a median age of 43.1 ± 13.2 years. Brucellosis arthropathy infection median time were 90[30,343] days. The knee joint was the most commonly affected site (64.7%), followed by the hip (20.6%) and sacroiliac joints (10.3%). Imaging revealed septic arthritis (20.7%), joint effusion (31.0%), bone destruction (12.0%), degenerative changes (10.3%), and prosthetic joint infection (6.9%). The sensitivity for Brucella culture, SAT, and RBT were 69.7%, 87.7%, and 91.2%, respectively, with a combined sensitivity of 92.6%. ROC analysis identified CRP as a highly sensitive and specific biomarker (cutoff: 4.07 mg/mL; sensitivity: 84.2%, specificity: 72.2%; Z = 5.568, p < 0.001). All patients were treated with doxycycline and rifampicin for 3 months, with 34% requiring surgical intervention. The prognosis was satisfactory in all cases.ConclusionsBrucellosis arthropathy, often chronic and predominantly affecting the knee and hip joints, presents with septic arthritis, joint effusion, and bone destruction on imaging. Diagnosis can be effectively achieved through aerobic joint fluid-blood bottle culture, SAT, and RBT. Early diagnosis and combined medical-surgical management yield favorable outcomes.

## Pathogens that infect mammalian cells via sulfonated glycosaminoglycans

date: 2025-06-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Sulfonated glycosaminoglycans, such as heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate, form major components of the cell surface and extracellular matrix, and display vital roles in mammalian physiology, including growth and development. The identification of specific binding to different glycosaminoglycans by a variety of pathogens has led to increased interest in this mechanism for understanding infection. Over the past four decades there have been more than 300 studies on various pathogens that utilize glycosaminoglycans in their infection process. Currently, no articles have collated all known pathogens that use this process. So it is timely that this article provides an overview of all known pathogens that use glycosaminoglycans to enhance their binding and/or infection in human cells. This was done by using the search terms “sulfate/sulphate” “pathogen”, “virus”, “bacteria”, “parasite”, “infection” and “glycosaminoglycans” to curate peer-reviewed and relevant original research articles from PubMed. This search found that glycosaminoglycans are used in the infection process for 59 viruses, 28 bacteria, and 8 other pathogens (i.e. parasitic protozoa, prions). These findings highlight the conserved and widespread use of glycosaminoglycans for enhancing pathogen infection. In addition, the curated list of pathogens in this study provides a resource for future studies to consider potential therapeutic approaches for targeted disruption of the interaction between pathogens and glycosaminoglycans.

## Modeling pathogen-driven neonatal late-onset sepsis: a modification to the murine cecal slurry

date: 2025-06-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionNeonatal sepsis is a major cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Reliable animal models are essential to our understanding of late-onset sepsis, but notable limitations exist in the current standard murine cecal slurry model. We sought to refine the existing model by using an injection of known stock slurry (“NEC’teria”) cultured from an infant who died of necrotizing enterocolitis to better mimic sepsis following the translocation of neonatal specific bacterial pathogens from the intestine into the peritoneum.MethodsTo induce sepsis, neonatal mice (P7 and P14 – P16) were given an intraperitoneal injection of varying concentrations of NEC’teria, while sham controls received an injection of PBS. Mice were monitored for survival and tissue samples, serum, and peritoneal washes were collected for further assessment of inflammation, immune response, and intestinal injury. Ceca were collected for microbiome analysis.ResultsWhile the polymicrobial cecal slurry from adult mice contained common healthy gut microbes, NEC’teria is composed of bacteria, primarily from the Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcaceae families, that are common causes of late-onset sepsis. NEC’teria exposure significantly increased serum inflammatory cytokines, resulted in intestinal injury, altered the microbiome composition, and induced significant changes in local and systemic immune cell expression. Sepsis-induced mortality, inflammation, and intestinal injury were live-bacteria dependent and could be attenuated by administration of an antibiotic one hour after bacterial injection.DiscussionOur modification to the cecal slurry neonatal sepsis model resulted in a consistent sepsis-related mortality and phenotypic changes in neonatal mouse pups that resembled the changes that occur in human preterm infants who develop late-onset sepsis. Our pathogenic slurry is highly relevant to neonatal sepsis, as it is comprised of bacterial families found commonly in septic neonates. We expect our model to be highly reproducible between institutions, due to the standardized bacterial dose and characterized stock solution.

## Application of targeted next-generation sequencing for pathogens diagnosis and drug resistance prediction in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of pulmonary infections

date: 2025-06-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundRecently, targeted next-generation sequencing (tNGS) have been extensively utilized for the identification of pathogens in pulmonary infections, there have been some studies systematically evaluating differences in the efficacy of tNGS and conventional microbiological tests (CMTs) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) specimens.MethodsA retrospective analysis was conducted on 203 patients with pulmonary infections treated in one tertiary hospital from July 2023 to February 2024. BALF specimens underwent parallel testing via tNGS and CMTs. Pathogen detection consistency, the drug resistance genes concordance with phenotypic drug sensitivity, and clinical impact of tNGS-guided therapy adjustments were analyzed. Furthermore, two patients with complex infections were selected for tNGS microbiological surveillance to evaluate the efficacy of monitoring severe pneumonia.ResultsThis study included 205 confirmed infectious BALF specimens (two patients were tested twice). tNGS identified 56 putative pathogens, compared to 20 by CMTs, with a significantly higher positive rate (99.5% vs. 35.6%, P<0.0001). The detection of pathogenic microorganisms using tNGS showed a high concordance rate with the results of CMTs. tNGS-guided therapy adjustments occurred in 17.2% (35/203) of patients. Resistance gene predictions aligned with the drug sensitivity results in 40% (6/15) of carbapenem-resistant organisms (CROs) and 80% (4/5) of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) cases. Additionally, for monitored two patients with severe pneumonia, the tNGS results were consistent with the culture and imaging test results during treatment.ConclusionsThe application of tNGS highlights its promise and significance in identifying potential pathogens, predicting drug resistance, and providing guidance for anti-infection therapies for severe pneumonia. It can be at least a complementary approach to CMTs reporting.

## Integrated analysis of microbiome and host transcriptome revealed correlations between tissue microbiota and tumor progression in early-stage papillary thyroid carcinoma

date: 2025-06-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionEmerging evidences suggest that microorganisms in the tumor microenvironment play important roles in tumor occurrence and progression. However, the microbial distribution in the papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) tissue and its relationship with PTC are unclear.MethodsWe performed 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and RNA-Seq to characterize the tissue microbiome and transcriptome between the tumor and paracancerous tissue, respectively. The association analysis between microbes and host gene expression were conducted to screen the potential microbe-gene/cell interactions.ResultsWe found that the tumor tissues indeed harbored complex microbial communities, which showed significant differences in microbial and functional composition between the tumor and para-cancerous tissues. A set of differential microbial genera were identified to be significantly associated with the clinical factors, such as Planococcus enriched in tumor tissue, Limnobacter in T1a stage and Cutibacterium in N1b stage. 793 differential expressed genes were also identified, which are mainly enriched with functions related to cell-cell communication and extracellular matrix. In terms of the immune cell composition, 8 differential immune cell types were further identified, suggesting a significant immune response in PTC. Finally, association analysis identified 5 pairs of microbe-gene association and 1 pair of microbe-cell with significance, which were all involved in the tumorigenesis and tumor progression via inflammation-related pathways.ConclusionsIn addition to characterizing the tissue microbiome and host gene expression in PTC patients, we further explored the roles of microbe-gene/cell interactions in PTC. The results provide candidate biomarkers for exploring the molecular mechanisms of tissue microbiome in tumorigenesis and tumor progression of PTC.

## First report of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus exposure in human and livestock populations, Center Region, Cameroon

date: 2025-06-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a widespread, tick-borne viral infection present in many African countries. Its epidemiology and impact on public health remain poorly understood in Cameroon. The main objective of the current study was to investigate the circulation of CCHF virus (CCHFV) in ruminants (cattle and goats), humans, and ticks collected simultaneously in a study area of Akonolinga, a health district in the central region of Cameroon. From the 15 to 28 July 2024, a cross-sectional study was conducted in Akonolinga, by collecting survey data and serum samples (from humans, goats, and cattle) and picking ticks from cattle and goats. This study included 100 randomly selected households from eight localities. Data were also collected using questionnaires to assess CCHFV seropositivity-associated factors. Individual characteristics of 189 goats and 246 cattle were collected and the data geo-referenced. To assess the prevalence of CCHF, serological enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and molecular (real-time Reverse Transcriptase (RT) PCR) methods were used to detect antibodies targeting CCHF viral nucleoprotein and CCHFV-specific RNA in collected sera, respectively. The presence of CCHFV-specific RNA was also assessed in tick homogenate using real-time RT PCR. The overall CCHFV seroprevalence was 1.9% [95% CI (1.02%–3.64%)] in humans, 10.9% [n = 42; 95% CI (8.15%–14.38%)] in cattle, and 3.38% [n = 5; 95% CI (1.45%–7.66%)] in goats. Seroprevalence in cattle increased significantly with age. A total of 554 ticks were collected from 162 of the 386 (42%) cattle examined, with Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus being the dominant species. CCHFV RNA was detected in two sera of women sampled. Phylogenetic analysis of a small portion of the L segment classified the strain within the African genotype III. This study reported, for the first time, the proven exposure of the human population to CCHFV in central Cameroon, showing strong evidence that CCHFV is infecting humans. Serological analyses revealed exposure of cattle and goats to CCHFV-strains collected in the same geographical area. These results demonstrate the potential risk of CCHF emergence in the human population, especially in rural areas in close vicinity with animals.

## Porphyromonas gingivalis-induced periodontitis promotes neuroinflammation and neuronal loss associated with dysfunction of the brain barrier

date: 2025-06-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundIn our previous study, Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis)-induced periodontitis caused cognitive impairment which was associated with abnormal amyloid β (Aβ) metabolite in the brain. The brain barrier is critical in maintaining homeostasis, controlling influx and efflux transport and regulating waste clearance. However, the specific role of the brain barrier in linking periodontitis to cognitive function remains unclear.MethodsA murine model of periodontitis-induced cognitive impairment was constructed via oral topical application of P. gingivalis. Neuroinflammation was observed by detecting the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and glia activation. Western blot (WB), immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF) were used to detect the expression of tau-related molecules and neuronal loss. WB, Evans blue staining and flow cytometry were used to evaluate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) function including the infiltration of P. gingivalis and immune cells, and BBB permeability. The changes of meningeal lymphatic drainage were observed using an in vivo animal imaging system and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The effect of P. gingivalis on lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) was further verified using IF and RT-PCR.ResultsP. gingivalis-induced periodontitis exacerbated cognitive impairment by the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokine and glia activation. In the brain of periodontitis mice, p-Akt and p-GSK3β levels were reduced, leading to tau hyperphosphorylation and neuronal loss including cell bodies and neurites. P. gingivalis-induced periodontitis enhanced BBB permeability, promoted P. gingivalis and immune cell infiltration, and downregulated the expression of Occludin and ZO-1. In addition, the meningeal lymphatic drainage was impaired and the mRNA levels of lymphangiogenesis-related factor LYVE1 were decreased in the dura matter of periodontitis mice. After P. gingivalis infection, the inflammatory response was increased, and LYVE1 and ZO1 expression was decreased in LECs.ConclusionsPeriodontitis aggravated neuroinflammation and neuronal loss which was associated with tau hyperphosphorylation. The impaired meningeal lymphatic vessels (MLV) and disrupted BBB affected the brain barrier function, further inhibiting the clearance of pathogenic substances and enhancing immune cell infiltration in periodontitis mice. These results indicated that brain barrier dysfunction may be the link between periodontitis and cognitive impairment.

## A multi-omics study of magnesium sulfate to improve prognosis in sepsis-related encephalopathy: integrating clinical data-driven network pharmacology

date: 2025-06-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundSepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) constitutes a significant neurological manifestation of sepsis, characterized by high mortality rates and posing a critical threat to patient outcomes. Magnesium sulfate has multiple effects in the nervous system, including neuroprotection, sedation, anticonvulsant activity, enhanced neuroplasticity, anti - inflammation and promotion of nerve repair. It can regulate calcium homeostasis, exert antioxidant effects, and reduce the release of inflammatory factors, thereby alleviating neuronal damage and neurological deficits. This study integrated MIMIC-IV database and network pharmacology to explore magnesium sulfate’s neuroprotective mechanisms and clinical impact on SAE outcomes.MethodsRetrospective data from 4,650 SAE patients in MIMIC-IV 3.0 were analyzed. Propensity score matching balanced covariates. Cox models and Kaplan-Meier curves evaluated magnesium sulfate’s association with 28-day all-cause mortality (ACM). Network pharmacology identified magnesium sulfate’s core targets and pathways.Results4183 patients (89.96%) received magnesium sulfate during ICU, while 467 (10.04%) did not receive. The 28-day ACM in patients with SAE was 11.05%. After propensity score matching participants with and without magnesium sulfate administration had 28-day ACM of 17.29% and 30.42%, respectively (P < 0.001). Magnesium sulfate administration was associated with reduced 28-day ACM. Subgroup analysis revealed this association differed in several stratification. Network pharmacology revealed magnesium sulfate targets TNF, IL6, IL1B and CXCL8, modulating pathways including inflammatory response, immune regulation, and cellular stress.ConclusionsMagnesium sulfate use correlates with improved SAE survival, particularly those with comorbid chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and acute kidney injury, and using vasoconstrictors, likely through multi-target modulation of inflammatory response and immune regulation. Prospective studies are needed for validation.

## Lower respiratory tract co-infection of Streptococcus pneumoniae and respiratory syncytial virus shapes microbial landscape and clinical outcomes in children

date: 2025-06-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundLower respiratory tract infections (LRTI), which are most commonly caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), pose a substantial global health burden in children. However, the causal pathways of bacterial-viral co-infections, particularly the mechanisms by which commensal microbiota could modulate SP-RSV-associated LRTI outcomes remain to be elucidated.MethodsA population-based cross-sectional study was conducted on children aged 0–18 years who were admitted to Beijing Children’s Hospital and Baoding Children’s Hospital in China from September 2021 to August 2022. Children with LRTI who underwent respiratory pathogen testing were divided into SP single infection and SP-RSV co-infection groups, with sex- and time-matched non-LRTI children as controls. Sputum and LRT secretion samples were collected for microbiota analysis using 16S rRNA sequencing, and child characteristics were obtained from medical records and pharmacy data.ResultsA total of 125 children with LRTI (84 with SP infection and 41 with SP-RSV co-infection) and 87 children without LRTI were recruited for this study. We found that LRT microbiota composition was strongly related to age, with a more pronounced increase in Shannon index within the first 5 years of life. Children with SP and RSV infection exhibited significantly altered microbiota composition in comparison to children without LRTI, particularly a higher abundance of Streptococcus. The competitive interactions among respiratory bacteria were found to be more complex in the SP single-infection group and simpler in the SP-RSV co-infection group.ConclusionOur findings show that RSV co-infection exacerbates SP-induced LRTI microbiota disorder and disease severity. This study may help us to better understand the characteristics of SP-RSV interaction and provide direction for the pathogen diagnosis of LRTI.

## A comprehensive evaluation of a novel targeted-sequencing workflow for Mycobacterium species identification and anti-tuberculosis drug-resistance detection

date: 2025-06-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundAlthough several World Health Organization–endorsed targeted next-generation sequencing (tNGS) assays exist for tuberculosis (TB) drug-resistance detection, their target selection and diagnostic accuracy vary widely. In this study, we developed a novel tNGS workflow (the TB Pro assay) and evaluated its performance in identifying Mycobacterium species and predicting drug resistance.MethodsThe TB Pro assay was validated for identifying 10 Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) and 39 nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) species, as well as predicting resistance to 4 first-line and 13 second-line anti-TB drugs. The limit of detection (LOD) was determined using 11 reference strains spiked in sputum. The prediction of resistance to anti-tuberculous drugs/drug classes was compared with phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (pDST) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) using 435 clinical isolates.ResultsThe assay demonstrated high sensitivity with a calculated LOD of 3.0 CFU/ml for MTB and 1.4–16.2 CFU/ml for most NTMs, except for Mycobacterium intracellulare with 117.9 CFU/ml. Using pDST as the reference standard, the sensitivity of the TB Pro assay for the detection of resistance ranged from 74.3% (ethambutol) to 94.4% (rifampicin), with specificity values >98% for all drugs. Compared with WGS, the sensitivity of the TB Pro assay was over 98.0% for all drugs except pyrazinamide (66.7%), and the specificity values were all nearly 100.0%. Directly on sputum, the TB Pro assay showed 100% agreement with smear- and culture-positive sputum specimens.ConclusionsThe TB Pro assay represents a sensitive and specific solution for simultaneous mycobacterial identification and comprehensive drug-resistance profiling, performing robustly on both cultured isolates and direct clinical specimens.
