id="gut-microbial-composition-associated-with-risk-of-premature-aging-in-women-with-yin-deficiency-constitution">Gut
microbial composition associated with risk of premature aging in women
with Yin-deficiency constitution</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundYin-deficiency constitution (YinDC) refers to a traditional
Chinese medicine concept, characterized by an imbalance state that
includes an imbalance in the gut microbiota, resulting from a relative
deficiency of Yin fluids within the body. In recent years, it has become
apparent that the composition and structure of the gut microbiota play a
significant role in the aging process. The imbalance of gut microbiota
in YinDC may accelerate the aging process. However, the specific gut
microbiota compositions involved in the YinDC premature aging process
remain unknown.MethodsIn this study, we conducted a cohort study
including 60 women with YinDC and BC to analyze their gut microbiota
composition. We integrated 16S rDNA sequencing with machine learning
methods to reveal the association between gut microbiota and premature
aging in YinDC women.ResultsWe found a significant difference in the
composition of gut microbiota between the YinDC and the BC group. At the
phylum level, Cyanobacteria and Synerobacteria only emerged in the YinDC
group. At the genus level, Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Haemophilus,
Alistipes, and Dialister showed higher abundance in the YinDC group.
Bilophila, Eubacterium, and Aeromonas were the most significant
indicators influencing the YinDC premature aging. The YinDC group had
the most functional gene pathways associated with the
metabolism.ConclusionOur study demonstrated that the gut microbiota was
associated with premature aging in women with YinDC, potentially
providing preliminary evidence and guidance for personalized anti-aging
strategies.</p>

on the MaxEnt model the analysis of influencing factors and simulation
of potential risk areas of human infection with avian influenza A (H7N9)
in China</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Exposure to infected animals and their contaminated environments may
be the primary cause of human infection with the H7N9 avian influenza
virus. However, the transmission characteristics and specific role of
various influencing factors in the spread of the epidemic are not
clearly understood. Therefore, it is of great significance for
scientific research and practical application to explore the influencing
factors related to the epidemic. Based on the data of relevant
influencing factors and case sample points, this study used the MaxEnt
model to test the correlation between human infection with H7N9 avian
influenza and influencing factors in China from 2013 to 2017, and
scientifically simulated and evaluated the potential risk areas of human
infection with H7N9 avian influenza in China. The simulation results
show that the epidemic risk is increasing year by year, and the eastern
and southeastern coasts have always been high-risk areas. After
verification, the model simulation results are generally consistent with
the actual outbreak of the epidemic. Population density was the main
influencing factor of the epidemic, and the secondary influencing
factors included vegetation coverage, precipitation, altitude, poultry
slaughter, production value, and temperature. The study revealed the
spatial distribution and diffusion rules of the H7N9 epidemic and
clarified the key influencing factors. In the future, more variables
need to be included to improve the model and provide more accurate
support for prevention and control strategies.</p>

efficacy of antibiotic-loaded bone cement and negative pressure wound
therapy in multidrug-resistant organisms diabetic foot ulcers: a
retrospective analysis</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectiveThe purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical
efficacy of antibiotic-loaded bone cement (ALBC) combined with Negative
pressure wound therapy (NPWT) aspiration technique in the treatment of
multidrug-resistant diabetic foot ulcers (MDRO-DFUs).MethodsA
retrospective analysis of the clinical data of 80 patients with
MDROs-DFU who were used Vacuum sealing drainage (VSD) as NPWT excipient
and met the inclusion criteria from January 2019 to January 2024 at our
hospital. Patients were divided into an experimental group and a control
group, with 40 cases in each. The control group received conventional
treatment, routine debridement, and NPWT treatment, while the
experimental group received ALBC treatment in addition to the treatment
plan of the control group. Measurements of blood inflammatory
indicators, foot hemodynamic indicators, wound bacterial clearance time,
wound healing time, and hospital stay were taken before and after
treatment for both groups.ResultsInflammatory indexes, Vascular
endothelial growth factor(VEGF), and internal diameter of dorsalis pedis
arteriosus of both groups after treatment were significantly better than
those before treatment, and the improvement of the experimental group
was more obvious than that of the control group; the experimental group
had a significantly shorter time of trauma bacterial turnover, healing
time of trauma, and hospitalization time compared with that of the
control group (P&lt;0.05).</p>

chemical warfare: the role of aflatoxin and fumonisin in governing the
interaction between the maize pathogens, Aspergillus flavus and Fusarium
verticillioides</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The mycotoxigenic fungi, Aspergillus flavus and Fusarium
verticillioides, commonly co-colonize maize in the field, yet their
direct interactions at the chemical communication level have not been
well characterized. Here, we examined if and how the two most infamous
mycotoxins produced by these species, aflatoxin and fumonisin,
respectively, govern interspecies growth and mycotoxin production. We
showed that fumonisin producing strains of F. verticillioides suppressed
the growth of A. flavus while non-producers did not. Additionally, while
aflatoxin did not inhibit F. verticillioides growth, it did suppress
fumonisin production. Fumonisin B1 concentration levels plummeted when
challenged with a high dose of aflatoxin B1 or with an aflatoxin
producing strain. With these findings, expression of the genetic
regulators of secondary metabolism was investigated for both fungi.
While no strong effect was seen on genes in the aflatoxin biosynthetic
gene cluster when exposed to fumonisin B1, the fumonisin repressor
FvZBD1, which is adjacent to the cluster, was induced with expression
proportionate to concentration when F. verticillioides was challenged
with aflatoxin B1. We also assessed the expression of the global
regulators of fungal secondary metabolism, veA and laeA, and found that
their expression is altered in both A. flavus and F. verticillioides
when exposed to their competitorâ€™s mycotoxin. This work gives insight
into the ecological roles of mycotoxins and why these fungi may produce
them as weapons in the interspecies battle for resource acquisition.</p>

of a rapid method for the detection of Brucella canis based on
recombinase-mediated thermostable nucleic acid amplification
technology</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectiveTo establish a rapid detection method for canine brucellosis
using recombinase-aided amplification (RAA) technology.MethodsThe outer
membrane protein 25 gene fragment (Omp25) of Brucella canis was
targeted. Primers and fluorescent probes were designed and synthesized,
and recombinant plasmids were constructed as standards. The RAA assay
was optimized by screening primers and establishing a fluorescent
reaction system. Sensitivity was analyzed using plasmid standards with
varying copy numbers. Specificity was tested using genomes from Brucella
canis, Brucella suis, Brucella melitensis, Brucella abortus,
Staphylococcus aureus, pathogenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella
enteritidis, Shigella spp., Proteus mirabilis, and Listeria
monocytogenes. Reproducibility was evaluated using plasmid standards
from the same and different batches.ResultsThe optimized RAA system used
primers bOmp25-F2/bOmp25-R2 and probe bOmp25-P, with a constant reaction
temperature of 39Â°C for 15 minutes. The detection sensitivity was 1
copy/Î¼L. No cross-reaction was observed with other Brucella species or
pathogenic bacteria, indicating high specificity. Intra-batch
variability was below 1.00%, and inter-batch variability was below
2.00%. The positive detection coincidence rate of RAA was significantly
higher than that of commercial real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR
(100% VS 86.96%, P&lt;0.05).ConclusionThe RAA-based rapid detection
method for Brucella canis is suitable for clinical rapid testing. It
offers advantages such as quick detection, high sensitivity, strong
specificity, and good reproducibility. This method provides new insights
for the rapid detection of canine brucellosis and the precise diagnosis
of other pet diseases, making it suitable for promotion and
application.</p>
