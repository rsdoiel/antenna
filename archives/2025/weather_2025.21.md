Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1142 AM CDT Tue May 27 2025

Valid 271700Z - 281200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No changes to previous forecast with no significant fire weather
concerns across CONUS. Upper-level ridge across the West will bring
warm temperatures and generally light winds to the region.
Afternoon showers/isolated thunderstorms are expected across higher
terrain of the Intermountain West and Rockies. Limited shear/storm
motions will allow longer residence times of precipitation cores
across New Mexico where fuels are dry, precluding introduction of
dry thunderstorm highlights.

..Williams.. 05/27/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0135 AM CDT Tue May 27 2025/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will remain low today. Heights will rise
across the southwestern US bringing generally light winds to where
the driest fuels reside. Afternoon relative humidity will remain
low, around 5-15 percent across AZ/NM. Overall, the lighter winds
should keep rapid fire spread concerns low.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1139 AM CDT Tue May 27 2025

Valid 271630Z - 281200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
SOUTHERN PLAINS AND SOUTHEAST...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong to severe thunderstorms across parts of the
southern Plains to the Southeast. Large to very large hail and
severe winds should be the main threats across western and southern
portions of Texas, with damaging winds the primary concern across
the Southeast.

...Southeast States...
A modestly organized quasi-linear cluster persists at midday across
east-central/southwest Alabama, with a trailing MCV near the
Mississippi and Alabama border. These storms will continue generally
eastward and potentially intensify along the composite outflow
through the afternoon into areas along/south of a front across
Georgia, with at least isolated damaging wind potential. While not
certain, some short-term guidance suggests that a degree of air mass
recovery and abatement of outflow could allow for strong/localized
severe storm redevelopment near the synoptic front later today
farther west across southern Mississippi and possibly nearby
Louisiana. 

...Southern Plains including West/South Texas...
In the wake of last night's extensive storms and prominent outflow
now over the western Gulf, substantial convective development should
focus later today over portions of west/south Texas, as a weak
mid-level shortwave trough moves from northwest/north-central Mexico
into the Southwest and southern High Plains. Weak low-level upslope
flow against the higher terrain in west Texas and northern Mexico
may also aid thunderstorm development. Most guidance suggests that
moderate to locally strong instability will exist by peak afternoon
heating, with steep mid-level lapse rates once again overspreading
the warm sector from higher terrain to the south/west.

Mid-level westerly flow is expected to remain fairly modest, but
veering and gradual strengthening with height through mid/upper
levels should support around 30-40 kt of deep-layer shear.
Slow-moving supercells posing a threat for large to very large hail
(2+ inches) should be the main threat with initial development. A
transition to one or more bowing clusters with a greater severe wind
threat appears possible through the evening and overnight hours as
convection spreads generally southeastward toward and across
south-central/Deep South Texas including the Rio Grande vicinity.

...Central/Southern High Plains...
On the back side of an upper trough/low over the north-central
states, isolated/high-based thunderstorms should initially form over
the higher terrain this afternoon before spreading southeastward
over the adjacent High Plains. While instability should tend to
remain fairly weak, steepened low-level lapse rates this
afternoon/evening and sufficient deep-layer shear to support modest
updraft organization may support occasional hail and severe wind
gusts.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 336
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
505 AM CDT Tue May 27 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  East and Southeast Louisiana
  Southern and Central Mississippi
  Coastal Waters

* Effective this Tuesday morning and afternoon from 505 AM until
  100 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1 inch in diameter possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...A small bowing cluster of thunderstorms should continue to
pose some threat for scattered damaging winds this morning into the
early afternoon. Isolated hail may occur with cells ahead of the
cluster, and a brief tornado also appears possible with circulations
embedded within the line.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 75
statute miles north and south of a line from 50 miles southwest of
Natchez MS to 50 miles east of Pine Belt MS. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU6).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0702 AM CDT Tue May 27 2025

Valid 271300Z - 281200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE SOUTHERN PLAINS AND SOUTHEAST...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong to severe thunderstorms should occur today across
parts of the southern Plains and the Southeast. Large to very large
hail and severe winds should be the main threats across portions of
Texas, while damaging winds will be the primary concern across the
Southeast.

...Lower Mississippi Valley/Southeast...
The northern portion of a long-lived MCS has maintained its
structure through the early morning hours across LA into western MS,
with occasional strong to severe gusts observed. The airmass
downstream of this small bowing complex is not overly unstable at
the moment. But, filtered daytime heating of a moist low-level
airmass across southern MS into AL/GA is expected to aid the
development of weak to moderate instability by late morning/early
afternoon. Current expectations are for this bow (or new updrafts
along its outflow) to gradually intensify into the afternoon as it
tracks east-northeastward in tandem with a weak mid-level shortwave
trough embedded within larger cyclonic flow over the
north-central/eastern CONUS. Deep-layer shear is forecast to remain
adequate for continued organization with this cluster, and the
threat for isolated to scattered damaging winds should increase by
this afternoon across parts of the central Gulf Coast states as the
boundary layer gradually destabilizes. There may also be some chance
for additional cells/clusters to develop ahead of the ongoing
activity across the lower MS Valley this morning. Isolated hail and
damaging winds may also occur with these thunderstorms if they form.

...Southern Plains...
An extensive area of thunderstorms moved offshore from the TX Gulf
Coast region earlier this morning and subsequently weakened. In its
wake, a convectively reinforced front has settled well south into TX
and parts of northern Mexico. Isolated cells which have developed
this morning across parts of south-central TX may pose some risk for
hail over the next few hours. Otherwise, more substantial convective
development should occur over portions of west/south TX later this
afternoon and evening, as a weak mid-level shortwave trough moves
from northwest/north-central Mexico into the Southwest and southern
High Plains. Weak low-level upslope flow against the higher terrain
in west TX and northern Mexico may also aid thunderstorm
development. Most guidance suggests that moderate to locally strong
instability will exist by peak afternoon heating, with steep
mid-level lapse rates once again overspreading the warm sector from
higher terrain to the south/west. Mid-level westerly flow is
expected to remain fairly modest, but veering and gradual
strengthening with height through mid/upper levels should still
foster around 30-40 kt of deep-layer shear. Slow-moving supercells
posing a threat for large to very large hail (2+ inches) should be
the main threat with initial development. A transition to one or
more bowing clusters with a greater severe wind threat appears
possible through the evening and overnight hours as convection
spreads generally southeastward across south-central and possibly
deep south TX.

...Central/Southern High Plains...
On the back side of an upper trough/low over the north-central
states, isolated/high-based thunderstorms should initially form over
the higher terrain of the central/southern Rockies this afternoon
before spreading southeastward over the adjacent High Plains. While
instability should tend to remain fairly weak, steepened low-level
lapse rates this afternoon/evening and sufficient deep-layer shear
to support modest updraft organization may support occasional hail
and severe wind gusts with this activity.

Mesoscale Discussion 0973
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0348 PM CDT Sun May 25 2025

Areas affected...TX Panhandle

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 252048Z - 252315Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Convective Initiation along a frontal zone appears
increasingly likely between 4-7pm CDT (21-00z).  Large hail appears
to be the primary threat, although the risk for severe gusts will
increase during the evening.

DISCUSSION...Visible-satellite imagery shows a gradual clumping of
cumulus along a front draped from southwest to northeast across the
TX Panhandle.  A patch of cirrus over eastern NM appears associated
with the leading edge of appreciable large-scale ascent from a
Desert Southwest upper trough.  As continued heating of a
moist/destabilizing boundary layer occurs this this afternoon,
expecting additional erosion of convective inhibition along the
boundary.  Modifying the 18z Amarillo raob for lower 80s deg F
temperatures and lower 60s dewpoints, yields around 2400 J/kg MLCAPE
and minimal MLCINH (-35 J/kg).  

Models continue to vary regarding timing/coverage of storm
development within this mesoscale corridor.  However, cloud trends
and forecaster experience imply at least isolated to widely
scattered storm development over the next 3 or so hours.  Depending
on timing/coverage of developing storms, a severe thunderstorm watch
will be considered.

Areas affected...much of Arkansas into southern Tennessee and

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 322...

Valid 252033Z - 252200Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 322
continues.

SUMMARY...The severe risk continues across much of WW322. Damaging
winds remain the primary threat though some hail with more scattered
convection is also possible.

DISCUSSION...As of 2030 UTC, regional radar imagery showed gradual
intensification of the ongoing convective cluster across
northwestern portions of WW322. Continued upscale growth of this
cluster is likely this afternoon/evening as the expanding cold pool
continues to interact with a broad warm and unstable air mass south
of the East-West stationary front. The expectation continues to be
for one or more bowing clusters to emerge from this convection, and
spread eastward with a risk for damaging winds and perhaps an
embedded tornado or two.

Additional, more scattered, convection has also developed across
much of the warm sector this afternoon. Given the robust buoyancy
(3,000 J/kg of MLCAPE), some hail and occasional damaging winds are
also possible with these storms. However, the main risk is still
expected to be the broader complex over AR/TN maturing later into
the evening. Given the gradual intensification/organization, the
severe threat will continue to increase across much of WW322.

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Storm development will initially focus near the higher
terrain before moving east atop the escarpment/plains.  Large
hail/severe gusts are possible.

DISCUSSION...Visible-satellite imagery shows towering cumulus over
the Sangre de Cristos and a swelling cumulus field along the I-25
corridor in a post-frontal regime.  Surface analysis indicates
temperatures have warmed into the mid 60s to lower 70s deg F with
upper 40s to lower 50s dewpoints.  Short-term model forecast
soundings and RAP-based Objective Analysis imply 750-1500 J/kg
MLCAPE across northeast NM.  A belt of 35-40 kt southwesterly 500-mb
flow will support storm organization as storms develop/mature into
slightly richer moisture with eastward movement later this
afternoon.  A few of the stronger storms may attain supercellular
characteristics and pose a risk for large hail.  Severe gusts could
become more prevalent if/once storms cluster and congeal east of
I-25 during the early evening before low-level lapse rates lessen
with the loss of heating.

Mesoscale Discussion 0970
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0215 PM CDT Sun May 25 2025

Areas affected...Atlantic Coast portions of SC and GA into the FL
Panhandle.

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 251915Z - 252115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered thunderstorms along multiple sea-breeze
boundaries will support a risk for occasional damaging gusts or
sporadic hail this afternoon. A WW is not expected.

DISCUSSION...As of 1915 UTC, regional radar and satellite showed
scattered to numerous thunderstorms erupting along the Atlantic
Coasts of GA and SC, extending southward across much of the FL
Peninsula. Driven largely by diurnal heating and localized
confluence along typical sea-breeze boundaries, a few stronger
multicells/clusters have been noted recently. With little in the way
of upper-level forcing for ascent, convection has been largely
unorganized and is expected to remain as such. However, additional
clustering may support stronger cold pool development with time.
This could allow for occasional damaging gusts and wet microbursts
given the high PWATs (~1.8-2 inches) air mass. Sporadic hail is also
possible with the more intense updrafts given around 2000 J/kg of
MLCAPE. While occasional damaging gusts and hail are possible, the
lack of broader upper-level support suggests the severe risk will be
transient/isolated. A WW is not expected this afternoon.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0253 PM CDT Sun May 25 2025

Valid 252000Z - 261200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE SOUTHERN PLAINS AND MID-SOUTH/TENNESSEE VALLEY...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms, including the risk for very large hail, swaths
of severe winds with isolated 75+ mph gusts, and a few tornadoes,
are expected across parts of the southern Plains this afternoon and
evening, including northwest Texas and southern/central Oklahoma.
Scattered severe thunderstorms with large hail and damaging winds
will also be a concern across the Mid-South, Tennessee Valley, and
other parts of the Southeast.

...20Z Update...
Minimal changes were made to the ongoing forecast based on recent
high-resolution guidance. The prior forecast reasoning otherwise
remains valid. See the previous discussion for additional details.

..Wendt.. 05/25/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1143 AM CDT Sun May 25 2025/

...Arkansas/Mid-South to Tennessee Valley/Southeast...
A rather complex scenario exists regionally owing to yesterday's MCS
and its impacts in addition to renewed MCS development overnight
across the Ozarks. That said, air mass recovery and boundary layer
destabilization is well underway along the
west/northwest-east/southeast-oriented outflow-reinforced baroclinic
zone across the region. Multi-MCV-related enhancement to the flow
field is also evident across the Ozarks, and this should translate
downstream (east-southeasterly) toward the Mid-South and eventually
Tennessee Valley.

This scenario appears favorable for one or more well-organized
east/southeastward-moving clusters/bowing line segments to evolve
later this afternoon into evening. Damaging winds can be expected,
with occasional large hail as well. Portions of the region have been
upgraded to an Enhanced Risk for this potential.

...Southern High Plains to Oklahoma/North Texas/ArkLaTex...
A low-amplitude mid-level shortwave trough over northern Mexico this
morning will move northeastward across the southern High Plains by
this afternoon/evening. Ahead of this feature, ample daytime heating
will likely aid in the development of moderate to strong instability
by mid afternoon amid a moist low-level airmass. A surface front
will extend from eastern New Mexico across northwest Texas and the
southern Texas Panhandle into parts of western/central Oklahoma,
with a dryline extending southward from the front across west Texas.
Both of these surface boundaries will likely prove instrumental, in
combination with modest large-scale ascent associated with the
shortwave trough, to focus intense thunderstorm development later
today. While mid/upper-level winds are not expected to be overly
strong, veering and gradual strengthening with height should support
around 30-45 kt of deep-layer shear. Stronger shear is forecast near
the front. Convective temperatures will likely be reached by 20-22Z,
and explosive thunderstorm development is expected in this time
frame across west/northwest Texas along the front and dryline.

A mix of supercells and clusters will likely form and spread
east-northeastward through the late afternoon and early evening.
Very large hail (2-3 inches in diameter) will be possible with any
initial supercells given favorably steep mid-level lapse rates and
relatively long/straight hodographs at mid/upper levels. By early
evening, consolidation into a bowing complex appears likely across
northwest Texas and southern Oklahoma. An increasing threat for
scattered to numerous severe winds will exist with this cluster as
it develops generally east-southeastward ward into western north
Texas and southern Oklahoma through the evening.

Given steepened low-level lapse rates and the presence of strong to
locally extreme instability, some wind gusts of 75+ mph appear
possible with the bowing cluster. The potential for supercells to
develop separately farther east along the front in western/central
Oklahoma still remains unclear. If thunderstorms can form here, they
would likely become severe quickly, and pose a threat for very large
hail. Some risk for a few tornadoes may also exist this evening,
either embedded with the bow or with semi-discrete supercells, as a
southerly low-level jet and related 0-1 km SRH gradually
strengthens. A continued threat for severe/damaging winds may
continue into the overnight hours across north Texas.

...Eastern New Mexico...
A somewhat separate area of at least isolated supercell potential is
evident across northeast to east-central New Mexico this afternoon
in a modest low-level upslope flow regime along and north of the
front. Large hail should be the main threat with this activity. The
eastward extent of the severe threat will likely be confined by
weaker instability into the Oklahoma Panhandle and northern Texas
Panhandle.

...Colorado Front Range...
As clouds abate/thin, a relatively isolated/focused severe threat
will again exist near the foothills/urban corridor of east-central
Colorado later this afternoon.

...Florida...
Compared to the prior couple of days, mid/upper-level winds appear
somewhat weaker across the Florida Peninsula today, while mid-level
temperatures are also slightly warmer per regionally observed 12Z
soundings. Even so, another day of scattered thunderstorm
development is anticipated over much of the Florida Peninsula, with
various sea breezes acting as foci for initiation. Moderate
instability coupled with modest deep-layer shear may still support
an isolated threat for marginally severe hail and gusty winds with
the stronger cores that can develop this afternoon.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0247 PM CDT Sun May 25 2025

Valid 261200Z - 271200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Southern New Mexico and far West Texas...
Lighter winds overall are expected across the Southwest as an
upper-level trough translates eastward into the Southern/Central
Plains. Although broad a fire weather threat is not expected across
southern New Mexico and far West Texas, locally elevated fire
weather conditions are still possible in typical downslope/leeward
areas where winds of around 15 mph combined with afternoon relative
humidity of 5-15 percent and very dry fuels exist.

..Williams.. 05/25/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1214 AM CDT Sun May 25 2025/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will remain low on D2/Monday. The upper-level
trough will move into the Plains on Monday, with rising heights and
southwest flow relaxing across the Southwest. A very dry air mass
will remain in place, with afternoon relative humidity around 10-15
percent across much of Arizona and western New Mexico. Overall, the
lighter winds preclude the need for highlights on Monday.

Valid 271200Z - 281200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PARTS OF
SOUTHWEST TEXAS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong to locally severe storms are expected on Tuesday
from parts of the southern Plains eastward into the Southeast. The
greatest threat of large hail or wind damage will be over parts of
southwest Texas.

...Synopsis and Discussion...
An upper low will remain over the northern Plains on Tuesday, with
modest west/southwest flow aloft stretching from the southern Plains
and across the TN/OH Valleys. High pressure will remain over the
northern to central Plains, upper MS Valley and Great Lakes,
limiting northward moisture return at the surface.

A zone of moderate to strong instability will remain on Tuesday from
much of TX eastward along the Gulf Coast states, with an effective
east-west boundary pushing south each day due to multiple rounds of
storms and outflows. Scattered storms may be ongoing roughly from
northeast TX into TN Tuesday morning, with various outflows spread
southeastward across the region, aiding new daytime development.
Locally damaging gusts will be the primary concern.

Farther west, severe storms chances appear greater, as easterly
surface winds bring a moist air mass far westward into a region of
steep lapse rates. Although midlevel winds will not be strong, the
combination of deep low-level easterlies and good high level flow
may support scattered severe storms in clusters, with hail and wind
potential as instability will be strong and over 3000 J/kg MUCAPE.

Modest southwest flow aloft will persist over the southern Plains
and into the TN/OH Valleys on Monday, with embedded waves in
association with convective clusters throughout the period. 

At the surface, high pressure will remain over the northern
Plains/Great Lakes/Northeast, with a large-scale boundary roughly
from northern TX into SC. Substantial moisture will remain south of
the front, with episodes of thunderstorms producing primarily strong
to damaging gusts.

...From eastern TX into LA/MS/AL - Daytime...
Models indicate that early day convection, possibly with wind
potential, will affect much of eastern TX into southern AR and
northern LA, and move into MS during the day. Substantial moisture
and instability will remain across the region ahead of any such
system, suggesting a wind threat. If the early day storms diminish,
outflows may still serve as a focal point for afternoon development.
Additional warm sector activity may develop eastward into AL and GA
as well, where shear will be weak but CAPE sufficient for locally
severe gusts or marginal hail.

...West-central into central and southeast TX...
Strong instability will redevelop across the region in the wake of
the early activity over much of eastern TX. Cool midlevel
temperatures with -10 to -12 C at 500 mb combined with upper 60s+
dewpoints will lead to strong instability. The nose of the low-level
lapse rate plume emanating out of southwest TX will be a primary
focus for supercell development, with very large hail and perhaps a
brief tornado possible. Near or just east of the lapse rate plume
may be the composite front/outflow boundary, and a large convective
complex is forecast during the late afternoon and evening. Details
are inherently uncertain with these MCS tracks and antecedent
outflows, but in general, much of central into eastern TX should
experience strong to severe wind gusts.

...Eastern NM and CO...TX Panhandle...
Beneath the upper wave, cold temperatures aloft and daytime heating
over the high terrain will lead to an uncapped air mass along the
Front Range and extending south across most of eastern NM. Easterly
upslope flow combined with weak westerlies aloft may be sufficient
for scattered cells producing marginal hail. Clustering of storms
with aggregate outflows may stretch into the OK/TX Panhandles late,
with marginal wind and hail risk.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 321
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1145 PM CDT Sat May 24 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Far Northwest Arkansas
  Southern Kansas
  Far Southwest Missouri
  Northern Oklahoma

* Effective this Saturday night and Sunday morning from 1145 PM
  until 700 AM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
    inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm coverage is expected to increase tonight
across northern OK into southern KS and adjacent portions of far
northwest AR and far southwest MO. Steep mid-level lapse rates and
strong vertical shear will support the potential for large hail.
Isolated damaging gusts are also possible, particularly across
southwestern KS where a potential bowing segment may move into the
region from the northwest.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 55
statute miles north and south of a line from 20 miles west southwest
of Garden City KS to 30 miles east of Grove OK. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU1).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 319...WW 320...

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
24035.

...Mosier

## SPC May 25, 2025 Day 4-8 Severe Weather Outlook

date: 2025-05-25, from: NOAA tornado/severe thunderstorm watches, mesoscale discussions, convective outlooks, fire weather outlooks

<br /><a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/exper/day4-8/"><img src="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/exper/day4-8/day48prob.gif" border="1" alt="Day 4-8 Outlook Image" hspace="1" vspace="1" width="815" height="555" align="center" /></a><pre>
Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0353 AM CDT Sun May 25 2025

Valid 281200Z - 021200Z

...DISCUSSION...
...Wednesday/Day 4 and Thursday/Day 5...
A mid-level low is forecast to move eastward into the upper
Mississippi Valley on Wednesday, as a cold front advances
southeastward across the southern and eastern U.S. Thunderstorm
development is expected to take place along and near the front
during the day as surface temperatures warm. An isolated severe
threat will be possible Wednesday afternoon and evening, mainly
across parts of the Southeast and southern Plains, where some areas
could moderately destabilize. Mid-level flow is forecast to be
somewhat weak, should could marginalize the severe threat in most
areas.

On Thursday, the mid-level low is forecast to move eastward across
the Great Lakes, as the previously mentioned front moves slowly
southeastward. The tail end of the front is forecast to be in the
southern Plains, where scattered thunderstorms should develop
Thursday afternoon. Over the southern Plains, northwest mid-level
flow is forecast to create enough deep-layer shear for isolated
severe storms. However, predictability is too low to delineate any
areas with a potentially greater risk.

...Friday/Day 6 to Sunday/Day 8...
From Friday to Sunday, a mid-level trough in the lower Great Lakes
is forecast to move into the western Atlantic, as another trough
develops in its wake, over the eastern U.S. Behind this trough,
northwest mid-level flow will remain in place across much of the
central and eastern U.S. In response, a relatively dry airmass is
forecast remain in place across much of the central and eastern U.S.
For this reason, the potential for strong thunderstorm development
is expected to remain isolated in most areas over the weekend.
