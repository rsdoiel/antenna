Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0751 AM CDT Sun Jun 01 2025

Valid 011300Z - 021200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PORTIONS OF
NORTHERN AND EASTERN TEXAS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered large hail and isolated damaging winds are possible later
today into this evening across central and east Texas. More isolated
severe thunderstorms are possible across parts of the mid-Tennessee
River Valley into the Carolinas, central and southern High Plains,
northern Rockies, and south Florida.

...Central and eastern TX...
Thunderstorms that developed earlier over northern/central OK have
moved into southern OK/Red River vicinity at 13z, and have thus far
remained only loosely organized. Expectations in the short term are
for this area of rain/thunderstorms to continue south/southeast into
north-central and northeast TX, with perhaps an isolated stronger
storm posing a hail/wind threat. Redevelopment/re-intensification is
anticipated this afternoon as the residual outflow encounters
moderate/strong MLCAPE on the order of 2500-3000 J/kg. Northwesterly
deep-layer shear averaging 35-40 kts will be sufficient for
organized storms, including supercells, posing a risk for large to
very large hail and damaging gusts. A sustained storm interacting
with residual/modifying outflow may have some tornado potential in
the presence of locally-augmented low-level shear.  

...TN to the Carolinas...
A quasi-stationary front is forecast to extend from eastern MO
southeastward into NC by early afternoon. Despite relatively modest
low-level moisture, diurnal heating combined with seasonably cold
temperatures aloft associated with a deep upper-level trough will
allow for weak to moderate destabilization near and south of the
front. Isolated to scattered storm development is expected this
afternoon, with somewhat greater coverage expected with eastward
extent. Modestly favorable effective shear (generally 25-30 kt) may
support occasionally organized storms capable of isolated damaging
wind and hail. Any longer-lived clusters could pose a more
concentrated wind-damage threat, and latest hi-res guidance suggests
this may be most likely across central/eastern NC in association
with a weak surface low moving east along the front.

...Eastern ID/Southwest MT/Northwest WY...
A mid/upper-level shortwave trough will move eastward from the
Pacific Northwest toward the northern Rockies by this evening. Weak
to locally moderate buoyancy and increasing deep-layer shear will
support the potential for somewhat organized cells/clusters with an
attendant threat of isolated severe gusts and hail. Depending on the
extent of diurnal heating/destabilization, a localized corridor of
somewhat greater potential may evolve with the broader Marginal Risk
area. 

...South FL...
Thunderstorms have redeveloped this morning along a low-level
confluence zone, with a few stronger updrafts occasionally
exhibiting low/mid-level rotation. There will be some potential for
modest diurnal heating and additional destabilization before storms
spread across the rest of south FL through the morning into early
afternoon. Westerly mid-level flow averaging 30 kts with a weakening
mid-level jet will support sufficient deep-layer shear for some
storm organization and the potential for isolated damaging gusts and
hail. A tornado cannot be ruled out this morning through early
afternoon with any stronger/semi-discrete storm. Please refer to
Mesoscale Convective Discussion 1060 for the latest short-term
thinking in this area. 

...Eastern CO/NM...
Scattered storms are again expected this afternoon and evening long
and east of the higher terrain in eastern CO/NM. While deep-layer
flow/shear will be relatively modest, guidance suggests some
increase in low-level moisture and instability by afternoon. Initial
storms could pose a threat for isolated hail and strong to severe
gusts. There is some potential for one or more loosely organized
clusters to develop by evening and spread eastward with strong to
locally severe outflow winds. 

...Southern CA into southern/central AZ...
A mid/upper-level cyclone will move northeastward into parts of
southern CA/AZ later today. Cool temperatures aloft will overspread
the region, but relatively widespread cloudiness and precipitation
will tend to limit destabilization. If pockets of locally stronger
heating/destabilization can develop, then a few strong storms will
be possible. However, confidence remains too low to introduce severe
probabilities at this time. 

...Great Basin...
High-based thunderstorms are expected to develop this afternoon from
parts of NV into western UT. Buoyancy and shear are expected to
remain weak, and organized thunderstorms are not expected, however
localized strong outflow gusts will be possible within this regime
through early evening.

Mesoscale Discussion 1060
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0705 AM CDT Sun Jun 01 2025

Areas affected...South-central Florida Peninsula

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 011205Z - 011400Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...An isolated tornado threat may continue for the next two
to three hours across south-central Florida. The threat is expected
to remain localized, and weather watch issuance appears unlikely,
although trends will be monitored.

DISCUSSION...An east-to-west band of strong thunderstorms is ongoing
across south-central Florida, along a zone of somewhat focused
low-level convergence. The storms are being supported by a shortwave
trough that is moving through the eastern Gulf. A mid-level jet
streak is analyzed by the RAP from the eastern Gulf extending
eastward across the Florida Peninsula. This jet has strengthened
deep-layer shear over south-central Florida into the 40 to 50 knot
range, according to the RAP. This will support isolated supercell
development this morning. Although RAP forecast soundings across
south-central Florida suggest that low-level shear is not
particularly strong, storm-relative helicity could be locally higher
near the zone of low-level convergence. As a result, transient
supercells could be capable of producing low to mid-level rotation,
with a brief tornado possible. Marginally severe wind gusts could
also occur. The threat should remain localized, and watch issuance
is currently not expected.

Mesoscale Discussion 1059
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0622 AM CDT Sun Jun 01 2025

Areas affected...Southern Oklahoma...North Texas

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 351...

Valid 011122Z - 011315Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 351
continues.

SUMMARY...A few strong thunderstorms, with isolated severe gusts or
hail, will be possible over the next few hours. However, any threat
should remain localized, and weather watch issuance is not expected
to the south of the current watch.

DISCUSSION...A cluster of thunderstorms is ongoing in south-central
Oklahoma, which is near a 500 mb jet analyzed by the RAP. This
cluster will continue to move southward across the remainder of
Oklahoma into parts of north Texas over the next few hours. Any
severe threat associated with the cluster will likely remain
localized and brief, primarily due to weak instability. For this
reason, weather watch issuance is not expected to the south of the
ongoing watch. 

As the outflow boundary, associated with the cluster, stalls over
north Texas later this morning, it will likely become a focus for
new convective development. Through that time, the situation will
continue to be monitored for changes in severe weather potential.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 351
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
125 AM CDT Sun Jun 1 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Central and Southern Oklahoma

* Effective this Sunday morning from 125 AM until 900 AM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail likely with isolated very large hail events
    to 2 inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Scattered severe thunderstorms will continue to move
southeast across the watch area early this morning with a risk
mainly for damaging thunderstorm wind gusts and large hail.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 75
statute miles east and west of a line from 50 miles north of
Oklahoma City OK to 25 miles southwest of Ardmore OK. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU1).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0330 AM CDT Sun Jun 01 2025

Valid 041200Z - 091200Z

...DISCUSSION...
Enhanced mid-level southwesterlies initially present over the
central Great Lakes early Wednesday should become confined to ON/QC
as a lower-amplitude shortwave trough dampens. Trailing to the south
of this, low-probability severe is apparent on Wednesday afternoon
in the eastern Midwest, and on Thursday afternoon over the Northeast
along/ahead of a decaying cold front. 

Another southern-stream shortwave impulse is progged to move east
from the Southwest mid-week. But initial surface ridging downstream
over the southern High Plains suggests the potential severe area
will be limited. Greater potential may await D6-7/Friday-Saturday,
as the ridging breaks down and zonal mid-level flow returns in the
wake of the aforementioned impulse. This will yield strengthening
and expansion of the EML east of the CO Plateau. ML guidance from
both the latest 00Z SPC/NSSL GEFS and yesterday's 00Z NCAR ECENS
highlight 15 percent probabilities on D6-7/Friday-Saturday across
the TX Panhandle into western KS/OK. Potential MCVs embedded within
this regime appear too minor at this time frame to reliably
delineate an area, but bear watching for shorter-term outlooks.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0342 PM CDT Sat May 31 2025

Valid 021200Z - 081200Z

Mid/upper-level troughing is forecast to persist across the western
CONUS through much of the upcoming week, which is forecast to foster
appreciable rainfall across most areas along/east of the
inter-mountain West, while it remains dry across the West Coast and
the Pacific Northwest. 

Although, critical fire weather potential appears limited through
much of the extended forecast, locally elevated fire weather
conditions are possible across portions of the northern Great Basin
Day 3/Monday and Day 4/Tuesday, as enhanced mid-level flow
associated with the aforementioned trough impinges on the area.
Isolated dry thunderstorms are also possible across portions of the
eastern Sierra Day 3/Monday, though relatively slow storm motions
coupled with higher precipitable water values reduces confidence in
introducing probabilities.

Areas affected...Parts of eastern North Carolina and southeastern
Virginia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 312004Z - 312200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...A couple locally damaging wind gusts may accompany
eastward-moving thunderstorms this afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Convection is gradually deepening in the left exit
region of a west-northwesterly midlevel jet across parts of northern
NC. This activity will continue spreading eastward across eastern NC
and southeastern VA this afternoon, where steepened low/midlevel
lapse rates and a long/straight hodograph (40-50 kt of effective
shear) could support a couple small, briefly organized storm
clusters. Locally damaging wind gusts may accompany any stronger
storms that can evolve, though weak instability and a lack of
focused mesoscale ascent should limit the overall severe risk.

Valid 312000Z - 011200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PORTIONS OF
SOUTHERN KANSAS INTO OKLAHOMA...

...SUMMARY...
Large hail and severe outflow gusts remain possible late this
afternoon into tonight from southern Kansas across central Oklahoma
to the Red River. Isolated strong to severe storms may still occur
this afternoon over parts of the Mid-Atlantic coastal region.

...20Z Update...
The main changes made to the updated Day 1 Convective Outlook were
to remove Slight Risk probabilities across the Mid Atlantic, and
remove Marginal Risk probabilities across the southern FL Peninsula.
Over the Mid-Atlantic, a loosely organized MCS has moved offshore,
leaving an overturned airmass in its wake. Though thunderstorms
remain possible in this area, buoyancy should be diluted enough to
reduce the severe threat to some degree. Similarly, the passage of
strong thunderstorms, along with residual cloud cover, will also
limit additional thunderstorm development across the FL Peninsula,
though a couple of lightning flashes cannot be ruled out.

Otherwise, the previous forecast (see below) remains on track.

..Squitieri.. 05/31/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1059 AM CDT Sat May 31 2025/

...KS/OK...
Morning satellite imagery shows a well-defined shortwave trough
digging southward across the Dakotas.  This feature will approach KS
by late afternoon, and track into the southern Plains overnight. 
Strong heating and steep lapse rates ahead of the trough, combined
with increasing large scale ascent, will result in scattered
thunderstorms over eastern NE/northern KS with a risk of hail and
gusty winds.  As this activity moves southward into a progressively
more moist/unstable air mass, thunderstorm intensification is
expected - mainly after dark.  Storms will continue southward across
southern KS into OK, with a few supercells expected capable of large
hail and damaging winds.  Storms may persist into the overnight
hours across southern OK/north TX.

...DelMarVa...
A broad upper trough is present today over the northeast states,
with a compact shortwave trough over southwest PA approaching the
DelMarVa region.  This system will promote afternoon convective
development from southeast PA into eastern VA, with storms spreading
across eastern MD/DE/southern NJ before tracking offshore.  Cool
temperatures aloft and sufficient westerly mid-level winds suggest
the potential for thunderstorm organization and a few severe storms
capable of damaging winds and hail.  Refer to MCD #1054 for further
details.

...South FL...
A sagging cold front will continue to result in a few strong
thunderstorms across south FL this afternoon, capable of locally
gusty winds.  Refer to MCD #1053 for further details.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0227 PM CDT Sat May 31 2025

Valid 021200Z - 031200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are possible from far western
Minnesota to the central High Plains from late afternoon to evening
Monday. Isolated severe thunderstorms are possible across a broader
portion of the central states from northern Minnesota to western
Texas.

...Synopsis...
A long-wave trough/ridge wave will continue to shift east across the
central CONUS over the next 72 hours. By Monday afternoon, the
primary ridge axis will shift across the lower MS River
Valley/Midwest with a mean southwesterly flow regime across the
Rockies/Plains. A pair of embedded shortwave trough, one moving
along the U.S./Canadian border and another emanating out of the
Southwest, will migrate into the Plains through early Tuesday. At
the surface, a cold front trailing from a low cyclone over the
Canadian Prairies will push into the northern/central Plains while a
dryline sharpens along the High Plains. Severe thunderstorm chances
will be focused along these boundaries as convection develops by
late afternoon. 

...Central and northern Plains...
The deepening of the surface low over the Canadian Prairies will aid
in moisture return into the Plains through the day Monday. Most
guidance suggests dewpoints should reach into the low to mid 60s
with MLCAPE values approaching 2000 J/kg as the front begins to
impinge on the developing warm sector by late afternoon. While the
strongest mid-level flow will remain displaced to the northwest of
the front/warm sector, 25-35 knot winds will likely support adequate
wind shear for organized convection. Initially discrete cells may
pose a large hail threat, though weak off-boundary storm
motions/deep-layer shear vectors and strong frontal forcing will
likely promote relatively quick upscale growth into clusters/line
segments. A strengthening nocturnal jet may promote southeastward
propagation of clusters/lines into the evening hours across eastern
SD and central/eastern NE with an attendant severe wind threat. 

...Central to southern High Plains...
Medium and long-range guidance nearly universally show some form of
a QPF signal along the lee trough/dryline by 00 UTC Tuesday across
southwest KS into western TX as a low-amplitude upper disturbance
ejects into the Plains and lifts/erodes lingering capping.
Sufficient buoyancy for robust convection will be in place across
much of the High Plains east of the dryline (and should exceed 2000
J/kg based on the typically-dry GFS forecasts), but forecast
hodographs show only modest elongation of the low to mid-level wind
profile owing to somewhat mundane mid-level flow (generally between
15-30 knots). Questionable/uncertain kinematic forecasts preclude
higher risk probabilities at this time, but the overall synoptic
regime and parameter space should still be supportive of a severe
hail/wind, and potentially brief tornado, threat.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0144 PM CDT Sat May 31 2025

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

Elevated to locally critical fire weather conditions remain possible
Day 2/Saturday afternoon/evening across portions of Nevada and along
the eastern Sierra in northern California. A relatively minor
eastward expansion of the Elevated fire weather area into central
Nevada was made with this forecast based on the latest
high-resolution ensemble guidance and updated fuel information
(which suggests ERC percentiles exceeding the 85th percentile across
portions of Nevada). 

Isolated dry thunderstorms are also possible across portions of
Nevada into northern California tomorrow afternoon/evening. However,
uncertainty currently remains too large to introduce an isolated dry
thunderstorm area either due to areas with marginal fuel
receptiveness and/or questions regarding thunderstorm mode
(wet/dry/mixed) and coverage.

Please see the previous discussion below for more information on
tomorrow's fire weather forecast.

..Elliott.. 05/31/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1232 AM CDT Sat May 31 2025/

...Synopsis...
While the strongest upper-level winds will depart northward,
troughing will continue in the Northwest. The upper-level cyclone
near Baja will begin to move northward ahead of the Northwest
trough. As this occurs, a boundary should stall in the northern
Great Basin/northern Rockies. A surface low will deepen in northern
Nevada along this boundary.

...Nevada...
The greatest potential for elevated to locally critical fire weather
concerns will exist in northwest Nevada along the lee of the Sierra.
The deepening surface low along with a belt of modestly enhanced
mid-level winds will promote 15-20 (locally up to 25) mph winds
during the afternoon/early evening. RH of 10-15% appears probable.

An increase in southerly winds in southern Nevada can also be
expected. With the approach of the upper-level low, an increase in
mid/upper-level clouds is expected. High-resolution guidance shows
ample cloud cover and potential for virga. Even the typically
dry-bias guidance shows RH struggling to fall to near 20% more than
briefly. Locally elevated conditions may still occur, particularly
along the northern fringe of the moisture/clouds, but sustained
elevated conditions do not appear probable at this time.

Lastly, the increase in mid-level moisture and lift from the surface
boundary/trough will likely promote isolated thunderstorms in
northeast/east-central Nevada. Low-levels will be dry enough that
some storms could be on the dry side. However, less receptive fuels
in these areas as well as a fairly rapid increase in PW values
suggests dry thunderstorm risk is low.

1225 PM CDT Sat May 31 2025

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
CENTRAL AND EASTERN TEXAS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered large hail and isolated damaging winds are possible on
Sunday from mid-afternoon to mid-evening Sunday in east Texas. More
isolated severe thunderstorms are possible across parts of the
mid-Tennessee River Valley into the southern Appalachians, central
High Plains, northern Rockies, and south Florida.

...Synopsis...
Little change is expected to the overall synoptic regime over the
next 48 hours across the country. Long-wave ridging will persist
across much of the Rockies/Plains with embedded shortwave troughs
propagating across the western CONUS. To the east, a long-wave
trough will undergo gradual de-amplification as it continues to
shift east/northeast. Overall, this synoptic regime will favor
multiple focused corridors of at least low-end strong to severe
thunderstorm potential, though the greatest risk will reside across
parts of TX where buoyancy/shear should be most conducive for
organized convection.

...Central to eastern Texas...
Early-morning convection associated with the progressive shortwave
trough currently over the central Plains will likely be ongoing
across parts of north/northeast TX by 12z Sunday. Recent forecast
guidance suggests this activity will weaken through morning,
possibly leaving an outflow boundary draped across parts of
eastern/central TX. Heating of a moist air mass along and west of
the boundary and/or along a weak surface trough should yield around
3000 J/kg MLCAPE by mid-afternoon with weak capping. Recent
convective allowing guidance continues to show some uncertainty
regarding convective coverage within this weakly forced regime, but
all solutions show at least a few robust cells developing along the
boundary/trough by late afternoon. 30-40 knot mid-level flow
associated with the departing upper-level perturbation will support
adequate deep-layer wind shear for supercells capable of severe
gusts and large to very large (2+ inches in diameter) hail. While
low-level wind shear is expected to generally be weak for much of
the region, a tornado threat may materialize if convection can
become rooted along the boundary where low-level vorticity may be
locally maximized.

...Tennessee to the Carolinas...
A diffuse cold front currently pushing south across the Midwest/OH
Valley is forecast to stall from southern IL into parts of KY, TN,
and the Carolinas by peak heating Sunday. A combination of moist
low-level conditions and weak capping should facilitate thunderstorm
development along the front by late afternoon. 25-30 knot mid-level
flow within the base of a mid-level trough should allow for
sufficient deep-layer wind shear for a few organized cells/clusters
capable of severe hail and sporadic damaging winds. Confidence in
the severe threat is greatest across eastern TN into the Carolinas
where mesoscale ascent along the boundary will be aided by lift
ahead of the trough axis. 

...Northern Rockies...
A shortwave trough is forecast to move across the Pacific
Northwest/northern Rockies through Sunday evening. Steepening
mid-level lapse rates and modest broad-scale ascent ahead of the
wave should promote thunderstorm development by late afternoon from
eastern ID into western MT. Although overall buoyancy will be modest
(MUCAPE approaching 200-400 J/kg), strong speed shear within the
CAPE-bearing layer (around 35-40 knots within the 0-3 km layer)
should promote some storm organization/longevity with an attendant
hail/wind risk. 

...Central High Plains...
Thunderstorm development along the eastern slopes of the central
Rockies is anticipated by mid-afternoon within a weak upslope flow
regime. 20-25 knot westerly mid-level flow will not only help
elongate hodographs, but will advect steeper mid-level lapse rates
into the region. This, combined with slightly improved low-level
moisture, should be sufficient for a few robust thunderstorms
capable of severe gusts and perhaps large hail. 

...South Florida...
The frontal boundary currently drifting southward along the FL
peninsula is forecast to stall later tonight/early Sunday morning.
Although forcing for ascent along the stalled boundary will be weak,
very moist low-level conditions and limited capping will promote
thunderstorm development across the central peninsula by late
morning. Through late afternoon, additional heating combined with
persistent 25-30 knot mid-level flow aloft should promote some storm
organization with an attendant wind threat across southern FL.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1126 AM CDT Sat May 31 2025

Valid 311700Z - 011200Z

Today's fire weather forecast remains largely on-track with Elevated
conditions expected over portions of the Northern Great Basin and
the Northwest. The greatest chance of locally critical conditions
still appears to be across portions of western Nevada, where very
hot surface temperatures (highs near 100F) and minimum RH values
near 10-15% coupled with downslope surface winds of 20-25 mph and at
least marginally receptive fuels are possible for a few hours this
afternoon into the evening. 

A 10-20% chance of isolated dry thunderstorms is also possible later
this afternoon into the evening across portions of the eastern
Sierra. While thunderstorm's may tend to anchor on terrain and
produce marginally wetting rainfall, a dry sub-cloud layer, 
favorable precipitable water values (i.e., between 0.5 and 0.8
inches), and seasonal ERC percentiles near or exceeding the 80th
percentile suggest isolated lightning ignitions are possible.

Please see the discussion below for more information on today's fire
weather forecast.

..Elliott.. 05/31/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1230 AM CDT Sat May 31 2025/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough will move into the Northwest while the
stagnant upper-level low will remain near Baja today. While the
overall pattern will keep stronger winds away from the driest fuels
in the Southwest, some elevated concerns are possible in the Great
Basin/Northwest.

...Northern Great Basin/Northwest...
With the stronger flow aloft moving in during the afternoon, some
increase in surface winds is expected in the lee of the northern
Sierra as well as in the Columbia Basin. RH in northwest
Nevada/southeast Oregon will likely reach 10-15%. Wind of 15-20 mph.
A period of locally critical conditions appears possible in Nevada
as downslope winds may reach 20-25 mph at least briefly. Fuels are
only approaching critical so some fire weather risk should be
mitigated.

In the Columbia Basin, RH may only fall to 20-25%. Winds will
increase, but this will primarily occur towards evening. Potential
for mid/upper-level clouds as well as some increase in marine
airmass influence east of the Cascades should limit a more robust
fire weather concern. However, at least some overlap of stronger
winds and marginally lowered RH appears possible during the
afternoon.

...Southwest...
Additional thunderstorms are expected in Arizona/New Mexico. PW
values are expected to gradually increase during the day. This,
along with slow storm motions, should limit potential for lightning
ignitions.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1059 AM CDT Sat May 31 2025

Valid 311630Z - 011200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON
OVER PARTS OF THE MID-ATLANTIC COASTAL REGION...AND TONIGHT OVER
PARTS OF KANSAS/OKLAHOMA....

...SUMMARY...
Large hail and severe outflow gusts will be possible late this
afternoon into tonight from southern Kansas across central Oklahoma
to the Red River.  A few severe storms are also possible this
afternoon over parts of the Mid-Atlantic coastal region.

...KS/OK...
Morning satellite imagery shows a well-defined shortwave trough
digging southward across the Dakotas.  This feature will approach KS
by late afternoon, and track into the southern Plains overnight. 
Strong heating and steep lapse rates ahead of the trough, combined
with increasing large scale ascent, will result in scattered
thunderstorms over eastern NE/northern KS with a risk of hail and
gusty winds.  As this activity moves southward into a progressively
more moist/unstable air mass, thunderstorm intensification is
expected - mainly after dark.  Storms will continue southward across
southern KS into OK, with a few supercells expected capable of large
hail and damaging winds.  Storms may persist into the overnight
hours across southern OK/north TX.

...DelMarVa...
A broad upper trough is present today over the northeast states,
with a compact shortwave trough over southwest PA approaching the
DelMarVa region.  This system will promote afternoon convective
development from southeast PA into eastern VA, with storms spreading
across eastern MD/DE/southern NJ before tracking offshore.  Cool
temperatures aloft and sufficient westerly mid-level winds suggest
the potential for thunderstorm organization and a few severe storms
capable of damaging winds and hail.  Refer to MCD #1054 for further
details.

...South FL...
A sagging cold front will continue to result in a few strong
thunderstorms across south FL this afternoon, capable of locally
gusty winds.  Refer to MCD #1053 for further details.

## Post-Tropical Cyclone Alvin Forecast Discussion Number 12

Post-Tropical Cyclone Alvin Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP012025
800 AM MST Sat May 31 2025
 
Cool waters, dry mid-level air, and strong vertical wind shear
have taken their toll on Alvin.  The system has been devoid of deep
convection for more than 12 hours, and has become a swirl of low- to
mid-level clouds.  The initial intensity has been lowered to a
possibly generous 30 kt.  Continued hostile environmental
conditions are expected to prevent any return of deep convection,
and therefore this will be the final advisory on the system as it
has become a post-tropical remnant low.
 
The low should continue to spin down as it moves slowly northward
today. Global model guidance indicates that the low will open up
into a trough of low pressure as it passes near the southern tip of
the Baja California Peninsula in about 24 hours.
 
Swells generated by Alvin are expected to persist along portions of
the west-central mainland Mexico and southern Baja California 
coasts through the weekend, creating potentially dangerous surf and 
rip current conditions.

Tropical Storm Alvin Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP012025
200 AM MST Sat May 31 2025
 
A collapsing area of fragmented convection is all that remains of 
Alvin's cloud pattern this morning.  The initial intensity has been 
lowered to 35 kt, between the objective intensity guidance of 32-40 
kt and closest to the TAFB T-2.5/35 kt Dvorak classification. Global 
models predict that the strong shear, dry air, and cool sea surface 
temperatures should prevent any new organized deep convection from 
forming.  Alvin is forecast to become a remnant low later today and 
dissipate on Sunday.  

Alvin is moving northward at 9 kt in the low-level flow.  This 
general motion is expected to continue through the weekend and only 
minor adjustments have been made to the latest NHC track forecast.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM MST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Alvin was
located near latitude 20.0 North, longitude 109.3 West. Alvin is 
moving toward the north near 10 mph (17 km/h). A slightly slower 
northward motion is expected during the next day or so.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 40 mph (65 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Continued weakening is forecast, and Alvin is
expected to become a remnant low later today and dissipate entirely
on Sunday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by Alvin will affect portions of the coasts
of west-central and southwestern Mexico and the southern Baja
California Peninsula through the weekend. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.

Mesoscale Discussion 1047
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0332 PM CDT Fri May 30 2025

Areas affected...Eastern Wisconsin

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 302032Z - 302200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm activity has begun to increase across
portions of northeastern Wisconsin ahead of a southward-moving
surface cold front. While no WW issuance is anticipated, storms
could be capable of intermittent hail and damaging wind gusts.

DISCUSSION...Storms have developed along and ahead of a southward
moving cold front in northeastern Wisconsin, with some modest
clearing out ahead of the storms and cooler temperatures aloft
resulting in some modest 1000 J/kg MUCAPE. Deep layer shear
exceeding 40 knots will support some convective organization, with
relatively well-mixed/dry boundary layer profiles supporting
damaging wind gusts with the strongest storms. With the freezing
level being at approximately 700 mb, potential exists for hail up to
1.00"-1.25" as well.

Mesoscale Discussion 1046
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0329 PM CDT Fri May 30 2025

Areas affected...Parts of south-central VA into north-central NC

Concerning...Tornado Watch 348...

Valid 302029Z - 302200Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 348 continues.

SUMMARY...The greatest near-term severe threat (through at least
22Z) should be focused over south-central Virginia into
north-central North Carolina within Tornado Watch 348.

DISCUSSION...A north/south-oriented band of convection with
brief/embedded supercell structures is tracking eastward across
southwest/south-central VA into far north-central NC -- ahead of the
cold front. Ahead of these storms, temperatures have warmed into the
upper 70s amid middle/upper 60s dewpoints, which is yielding
moderately unstable surface-based inflow. Around 40-50 kt of
effective shear and locally boosted low-level SRH (upwards of 150
m2/s2 effective SRH) should support a locally favorable area for
embedded supercell structures capable of producing locally damaging
gusts and perhaps a tornado or two.

Mesoscale Discussion 1045
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0250 PM CDT Fri May 30 2025

Areas affected...Far southeast Georgia...eastern South
Carolina...and southeastern North Carolina

Concerning...Severe potential...Severe Thunderstorm Watch likely 

Valid 301950Z - 302115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...A severe thunderstorm watch will likely be needed within
the next hour as a line of thunderstorms moves eastward out of the
southern Appalachians towards the Atlantic coast. These storms will
primarily be capable of damaging wind gusts, particularly where any
convective clusters/bowing segments organize.

DISCUSSION...A line of thunderstorms is moving eastward towards far
eastern Georgia, eastern South Carolina, and southeastern Virginia.
Ahead of the storms, daytime heating and boundary-layer mixing has
destabilized the environment -- with 1500 J/kg MLCAPE and 40 kts of
deep-layer shear -- which will support some organization into severe
thunderstorm lines and clusters capable of damaging winds, and
perhaps some hail. WW issuance will be needed within the next hour
as convection exits WW 347.

Mesoscale Discussion 1044
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0249 PM CDT Fri May 30 2025

Areas affected...Parts of eastern VA...MD...DE...northeastern
NC...and far southeastern PA

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 301949Z - 302145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...The risk of damaging wind gusts and a few tornadoes will
increase in the 22Z-00Z time frame. A watch will likely be issued
for parts of the area within an hour or two.

DISCUSSION...Latest surface analysis shows a surface low over
northern WV, with a quasi-warm front extending eastward across MD
into southern NJ. Along/south of the front, diurnal heating within
cloud breaks and lower/middle 60s dewpoints are contributing to
around 1500 J/kg MLCAPE. As storms spread/develop eastward into the
destabilizing air mass, 40-50 kt of effective shear should favor
gradual intensification/organization into semi-discrete clusters and
supercells. Enhanced clockwise hodograph curvature (around 150 m2/s2
effective SRH) ahead of the east-northeastward-moving surface low
will support the potential for a few tornadoes (along with locally
damaging wind gusts) with the more organized supercells that evolve.
A watch is likely for parts of the area within an hour or two.

Tropical Storm Alvin Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP012025
200 PM MST Fri May 30 2025
 
The satellite presentation of Alvin has gradually degraded today. 
Alvin is entering an environment of strong south-southwesterly wind 
shear.  Although much of the convection has been pushed off to the 
north and become elongated, the low-level center still appears to be 
underneath the southernmost portion of the central dense overcast.  
A pair of recent ASCAT passes missed the center, but still provided 
useful information that shows somewhat larger 34-kt radii, so these 
have been been expanded a bit.  The ASCAT data show winds up to 40 
kt about 50 n mi east of the center, but there is a good chance that 
stronger winds are still occurring slightly closer to the center 
where there was a gap in ASCAT data. The latest subjective intensity 
estimates from TAFB and SAB are T-2.5/35 kt, and the latest 
objective intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS are in the 41-47 kt 
range.  The intensity is held at 45 kt for this advisory since the 
low-level center has not emerged from underneath the central dense 
overcast yet, and based on the ASCAT data.
 
The initial motion is estimated to be north-northwest, or 335/9 kt.
Alvin is forecast to turn northward tonight as it moves through a 
weakness in the subtropical ridge, toward the east side of a 
mid-level cutoff low located just west of Baja California.  Little 
change is made to the previous NHC track prediction, which lies down 
the middle of the consensus model envelope.
 
Alvin will continue moving into an increasingly hostile environment
of very strong wind shear, dry air, and sea-surface temperatures
that will drop below 26C along Alvin's path in about 6 hours.  
These conditions should lead to Alvin losing its convection on
Saturday, which is depicted by the GFS and ECMWF simulated
satellite imagery.  There are no significant changes to the NHC
intensity forecast, and Alvin is forecast to degenerate to a
remnant low in about 24 hours, with dissipation predicted to 
occur in about 2 days.

MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NNW OR 335 DEGREES AT 10 MPH...17 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1001 MB...29.56 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM MST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Alvin was
located near latitude 18.1 North, longitude 109.0 West. Alvin is
moving toward the north-northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h). A turn 
toward the north is expected tonight, and this motion should 
continue through the weekend.

Maximum sustained winds remain near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Weakening is forecast, and Alvin is expected to degenerate to 
a remnant low on Saturday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by Alvin will affect portions of the coasts
of west-central and southwestern Mexico and the southern Baja
California Peninsula through the weekend. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 800 PM MST.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 347
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1255 PM EDT Fri May 30 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  East-Central Alabama
  Northern into Central and Eastern Georgia
  Western North Carolina
  Western and Central South Carolina

* Effective this Friday afternoon and evening from 1255 PM until
  800 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Widespread damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...A developing broken band of intensifying thunderstorms
will quickly move across the Watch area this afternoon into the
early evening.  Severe gusts (60-70 mph) capable of wind damage will
be the primary hazard.  A brief tornado or two is possible in
addition to an isolated risk for large hail.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 115
statute miles east and west of a line from 35 miles east northeast
of Hickory NC to 25 miles southeast of Columbus GA. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU7).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
27045.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 348
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
135 PM EDT Fri May 30 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Northwest into Central North Carolina
  Western and Northern Virginia
  Southern and Eastern West Virginia

* Effective this Friday afternoon and evening from 135 PM until
  800 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A couple tornadoes possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Scattered thunderstorms are forecast to develop ahead of a
surface low where enlarged hodographs and moist low levels will
promote a mix of cells and bands of storms.  The stronger storms
will pose a risk for a couple of tornadoes, scattered damaging
gusts, and isolated large hail.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 80 statute miles
east and west of a line from 30 miles north northeast of Elkins WV
to 20 miles southwest of Greensboro NC. For a complete depiction of
the watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS
WOU8).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 347...

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 60 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean
storm motion vector 25035.

## Tropical Storm Alvin Forecast Discussion Number 7

Tropical Storm Alvin Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP012025
200 AM MST Fri May 30 2025
 
Alvin is unraveling quickly.  Overnight satellite surface wind data 
placed the center of the storm near the southern edge of the cold 
cloud tops.  The vertical wind shear analysis from CIMSS-UW 
estimates that Alvin has entered a region of strong shear.  The 
initial intensity is lowered slightly to 45 kt, based on the recent 
scatterometer observations.
 
The storm is moving north-northwestward at 9 kt.  Alvin should 
gradually turn toward the north over the next day or so as it moves 
towards a weakness in the ridge.  Only minor adjustments have been 
made to the official forecast, which lies near the various consensus 
aids.
 
The increasingly hostile environmental conditions are expected to 
weaken Alvin further over the next 24 h.  Strong vertical wind 
shear and cooling sea surface temperatures should cause the storm 
to become a post-tropical remnant low by this weekend.  No 
significant changes were made to the latest NHC intensity forecast.

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM MST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Alvin was 
located near latitude 16.6 North, longitude 108.3 West. Alvin is 
moving toward the north-northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h). A turn 
toward the north is expected to later today and this motion should 
continue through the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 50 mph (85 km/h) with 
higher gusts. Gradual weakening is forecast during the next couple 
of days, and Alvin is expected to degenerate to a remnant low on 
Saturday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by Alvin will affect portions of the coasts
of west-central and southwestern Mexico and the southern Baja
California Peninsula during the next couple of days. These swells
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 800 AM MST.

Mesoscale Discussion 1038
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0306 PM CDT Thu May 29 2025

Areas affected...southeast New Mexico into West Texas and parts of
the Texas Big Country

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 292006Z - 292130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...The severe weather threat will increase across southeast
New Mexico and West Texas later this afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Moderate instability has developed across West Texas
and into far southeastern New Mexico this afternoon. Additional
heating and destabilization, combined with increasing ascent ahead
of a southeastward moving shortwave trough, should be sufficient for
storm development later this afternoon along and south of the front
moving south across West Texas. Storms will initially be
supercellular given 45-50 knots of effective shear (per SPC
mesoanalysis). The primary hazard initially will be large hail, with
the potential for hail in excess of 3 inches. Some tornado and
severe wind threat will also exist during the supercell storm mode.
Through time, these supercells may congeal into a southeastward
moving MCS. In addition, the mass of convection across southeast New
Mexico and vicinity may eventually develop a strong enough cold pool
to support a forward propagating MCS as it moves southeast into the
greater instability. As these MCSs combine, the severe wind threat
will increase, particularly as storms move into the Texas Big
Country/Concho Valley later this evening.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 346
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
350 PM CDT Thu May 29 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Southeast New Mexico
  Far West into West and West-Central Texas

* Effective this Thursday afternoon and evening from 350 PM until
  1100 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 85
    mph likely
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 3.5
    inches in diameter likely
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Scattered severe thunderstorms are forecast to develop
over the northwestern half of the Watch this afternoon.  The
stronger thunderstorms will likely become supercells and be capable
of large to giant hail (1 to 3.5 inches in diameter).  A tornado is
possible early this evening before additional storms congeal into an
eastward-moving thunderstorm cluster.  Severe gusts ranging from
60-85 mph are possible with the more intense downdrafts within the
cluster.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 90
statute miles north and south of a line from 15 miles west northwest
of Carlsbad NM to 65 miles north northeast of San Angelo TX. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU6).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
3.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 75 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
28020.

## Tropical Storm Alvin Forecast Discussion Number 5

Tropical Storm Alvin Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP012025
200 PM MST Thu May 29 2025
 
Satellite imagery depicts that Alvin has continued to become better 
organized throughout the day, showing convective banding and a 
central dense overcast with cold cloud tops near -75C located over 
the low-level center. An earlier scatterometer pass shows wind 
speeds around 45 kt. Given the improving convective structure since 
that pass, and increasing objective satellite intensity estimates, 
the initial intensity has increased to 50 kt for this advisory.
 
The initial motion is 320/10 kt.  The storm is expected to continue
moving toward the northwest today, then begin turning toward the
north-northwest tomorrow as it moves around a ridge centered over
central Mexico. By tomorrow night, Alvin will begin moving northward
as it is influenced by a mid-level cut-off low. The NHC track
forecast is very near the previous one.
 
The storm will remain within a favorable environment of warm sea 
surface temperatures and low wind shear over the next 12 hours or 
so. Given the latest convective trends and conducive conditions, the 
peak intensity forecast has increased this cycle to 60 kt. Tomorrow, 
Alvin will begin to move into a hostile environment with cooler 
SSTs, higher wind shear, and a drier mid-level airmass which will 
induce weakening. Latest model derived IR imagery from both the 
ECMWF and GFS depict the system becoming devoid of convection, and 
the latest NHC forecast depicts the system becoming a remnant low in 
48 h. Thus, there is high confidence that the system will weaken to 
a remnant low before it nears the Baja California Peninsula.

BULLETIN
Tropical Storm Alvin Advisory Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP012025
200 PM MST Thu May 29 2025
 
...TROPICAL STORM ALVIN CONTINUES TO STRENGTHEN...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 200 PM MST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...15.1N 107.2W
ABOUT 565 MI...910 KM SSE OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...60 MPH...95 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 320 DEGREES AT 12 MPH...19 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...999 MB...29.50 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM MST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Alvin was 
located near latitude 15.1 North, longitude 107.2 West. Alvin is 
moving toward the northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h). This general 
motion is expected to continue through today, followed by a 
northward turn tomorrow and Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 60 mph (95 km/h) with 
higher gusts. Some additional strengthening is expected through 
early tomorrow, but weakening is expected to begin by late Friday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by Alvin will affect portions of the coast of
west-central Mexico and the coast of the southern Baja California
Peninsula during the next couple of days. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 800 PM MST.

## Tropical Depression One-E Forecast Discussion Number 3

WTPZ41 KNHC 290837
TCDEP1
 
Tropical Depression One-E Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP012025
200 AM MST Thu May 29 2025
 
The depression has been holding steady overnight.  While 
thunderstorm activity has increased since the previous advisory, 
recent scatterometer data has revealed that the surface winds remain 
generally unchanged.  The initial intensity is held at 30 kt based 
on the ASCAT data, which is also close to the other subjective and 
objective satellite estimates.

The initial motion is 330/8 kt.  The depression is expected to move 
north-northwestward to northwestward for the next day or so.  Then 
an amplifying upper-level trough offshore Baja California should 
turn the system northward on Friday and into the weekend. The NHC 
track forecast has shifted slightly to the west, largely because of 
the initial position, and it lies between the various consensus 
aids.
 
The window for the cyclone to strengthen is gradually closing.  The 
depression is still expected to become a tropical storm sometime 
later today, though the system only has about 36 hours of conducive 
environmental conditions.  The NHC peak intensity has been lowered 
to 50 kt and is at the top of the intensity forecast guidance 
envelope.  In a couple of days, the vertical wind shear is forecast 
to increase while the cyclone moves over cooler waters and into a 
dry and stable air mass. Global models predict the system will lose 
its organized convection at this point and the NHC forecast now 
shows the system becoming post-tropical in 60 h.  Based on the 
latest track and size forecasts, tropical-storm-force winds are not 
expected to impact the coast of mainland Mexico or Baja California.

Mesoscale Discussion 1027

0358 PM CDT Wed May 28 2025

Areas affected...central Texas

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 343...

Valid 282058Z - 282230Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 343
continues.

SUMMARY...Several supercells to persist through the afternoon with a
primary threat of large hail.

DISCUSSION...A few supercells have developed in central Texas and
have recently started to turn right. The north-easternmost storm has
recently produced baseball sized hail in Hamilton County, Texas. A
favorable environment persists south of this activity which should
maintain this threat through the afternoon and into the early
evening. Eventually, these storms may congeal as they move southeast
which would result in an increased severe wind threat. However, in
the near term, large hail is the primary threat. 

Farther southwest convective attempts continue but it remains
unclear whether additional mature supercells may develop. If they
do, a similar environment will support supercells capable of large
to very large hail, similar to the storms farther east.

Mesoscale Discussion 1026
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0338 PM CDT Wed May 28 2025

Areas affected...Parts of Far West Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 282038Z - 282215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...There is an increasing threat for large hail this
afternoon and evening across portions of Far West Texas.

DISCUSSION...SPC mesoanalysis has indicated that inhibition has
mostly eroded across portions of Far West Texas and some towers have
started to develop over the Davis Mountains. Current visible
satellite data suggests that any convection this afternoon/evening
will likely be confined to the Davis Mountain vicinity. As
destabilization continues this afternoon, expect at least one storm,
potentially a few storms, to develop over the higher terrain. RAP
forecast soundings and SPC mesoanalysis indicate effective shear
around 30 to 35 knots which could support a supercell threat. Large
hail will likely be the primary threat with storms quickly weakening
after peak heating. 

If a few strong storms develop with a threat which may persist for
several hours, a severe thunderstorm watch may be necessary, but
more than isolated coverage and a short duration threat seems
questionable at this time.

Mesoscale Discussion 1025
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0334 PM CDT Wed May 28 2025

Areas affected...Far southeast Colorado...far southwest Kansas...and
the Oklahoma Panhandle

Concerning...Tornado Watch 342...

Valid 282034Z - 282130Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 342 continues.

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms have developed in far southeastern Colorado
and the far western Oklahoma Panhandle this afternoon, with an
additional cluster of thunderstorms moving from far northwest
Kansas/eastern Colorado due southeast. These thunderstorms will be
capable of all hazards, including tornadoes -- particularly across
southern portions of WW 342 in the short term.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms in the Oklahoma Panhandle/southwest
Kansas have developed west of an environment characterized by rich
boundary-layer moisture (mixing ratios ~13-14 g/kg), 35-40 kts of
deep-layer shear, and southeasterly surface winds. VAD wind profiles
from KDDC show some low-level curvature of the hodograph that will
support stronger low-level mesocyclones and potential tornado
development, and low-level shear is expected to increase into the
evening with the nocturnal low-level jet around and after sunset.
While convective interactions in the short term lead to some
uncertainty, the expectation is that any isolated/strong supercells
that emerge from the convective clusters will have increased tornado
potential heading into this evening. 

Further north in eastern Colorado/northwest Kansas, a cluster of
convection is moving south-southeastward through WW 342. These
storms will be moving into an increasingly unstable and sheared
environment, though current KGLD VAD wind profiles show mostly
straight-line hodographs that would favor splitting supercell
thunderstorms. These storms will be capable of all hazards, with the
threat increasing as they continue to progress south and east with
time.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 343
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
245 PM CDT Wed May 28 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Central and South-Central Texas

* Effective this Wednesday afternoon and evening from 245 PM
  until 1000 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail likely with isolated very large hail events
    to 2.5 inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...At least isolated severe storms including supercells
capable of large hail are expected this afternoon across the region,
as the air mass further destabilizes after early day storms.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 65
statute miles north and south of a line from 50 miles south
southwest of San Angelo TX to 20 miles southeast of Waco TX. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU3).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

## Tropical Depression One-E Forecast Discussion Number 1

TCDEP1
 
Tropical Depression One-E Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP012025
300 PM CST Wed May 28 2025
 
Showers and thunderstorms associated with an area of low pressure 
have continued to become better organized over the past 12 hours. 
Some banding features have become more pronounced over the southern 
semi-circle. Recent scatterometer data depicts that the system now 
has a well-defined low-level center. Thus, the system is now 
classified as a tropical depression, the first of the eastern 
Pacific season. The initial intensity is set at 30 kt based on a 
T2.0 Dvorak classification from TAFB.
 
The initial estimated motion is northwest at 320/8 kt, although 
there is higher uncertainty in this motion given the recent 
low-level center formation. Models are in fairly good agreement 
that the system should continue northwest to north-northwest over 
the next few days within the low-level flow. Environmental 
conditions are favorable for strengthening over the next couple of 
days with warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear. After 
48 h the system is likely to enter a fairly harsh environment with 
drier mid-level air, cooler sea surface temperatures, and increasing 
wind shear which should induce a weakening trend. The latest model 
simulated IR satellite imagery shows that convection is likely to 
collapse by Saturday, and the system is forecast to become a remnant 
low and dissipate early next week.

Mesoscale Discussion 0973
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0348 PM CDT Sun May 25 2025

Areas affected...TX Panhandle

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 252048Z - 252315Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Convective Initiation along a frontal zone appears
increasingly likely between 4-7pm CDT (21-00z).  Large hail appears
to be the primary threat, although the risk for severe gusts will
increase during the evening.

DISCUSSION...Visible-satellite imagery shows a gradual clumping of
cumulus along a front draped from southwest to northeast across the
TX Panhandle.  A patch of cirrus over eastern NM appears associated
with the leading edge of appreciable large-scale ascent from a
Desert Southwest upper trough.  As continued heating of a
moist/destabilizing boundary layer occurs this this afternoon,
expecting additional erosion of convective inhibition along the
boundary.  Modifying the 18z Amarillo raob for lower 80s deg F
temperatures and lower 60s dewpoints, yields around 2400 J/kg MLCAPE
and minimal MLCINH (-35 J/kg).  

Models continue to vary regarding timing/coverage of storm
development within this mesoscale corridor.  However, cloud trends
and forecaster experience imply at least isolated to widely
scattered storm development over the next 3 or so hours.  Depending
on timing/coverage of developing storms, a severe thunderstorm watch
will be considered.

Mesoscale Discussion 0972
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0333 PM CDT Sun May 25 2025

Areas affected...much of Arkansas into southern Tennessee and
northern Mississippi

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 322...

Valid 252033Z - 252200Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 322
continues.

SUMMARY...The severe risk continues across much of WW322. Damaging
winds remain the primary threat though some hail with more scattered
convection is also possible.

DISCUSSION...As of 2030 UTC, regional radar imagery showed gradual
intensification of the ongoing convective cluster across
northwestern portions of WW322. Continued upscale growth of this
cluster is likely this afternoon/evening as the expanding cold pool
continues to interact with a broad warm and unstable air mass south
of the East-West stationary front. The expectation continues to be
for one or more bowing clusters to emerge from this convection, and
spread eastward with a risk for damaging winds and perhaps an
embedded tornado or two.

Additional, more scattered, convection has also developed across
much of the warm sector this afternoon. Given the robust buoyancy
(3,000 J/kg of MLCAPE), some hail and occasional damaging winds are
also possible with these storms. However, the main risk is still
expected to be the broader complex over AR/TN maturing later into
the evening. Given the gradual intensification/organization, the
severe threat will continue to increase across much of WW322.

Mesoscale Discussion 0971
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0224 PM CDT Sun May 25 2025

Areas affected...northeast NM

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 251924Z - 252130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Storm development will initially focus near the higher
terrain before moving east atop the escarpment/plains.  Large
hail/severe gusts are possible.

DISCUSSION...Visible-satellite imagery shows towering cumulus over
the Sangre de Cristos and a swelling cumulus field along the I-25
corridor in a post-frontal regime.  Surface analysis indicates
temperatures have warmed into the mid 60s to lower 70s deg F with
upper 40s to lower 50s dewpoints.  Short-term model forecast
soundings and RAP-based Objective Analysis imply 750-1500 J/kg
MLCAPE across northeast NM.  A belt of 35-40 kt southwesterly 500-mb
flow will support storm organization as storms develop/mature into
slightly richer moisture with eastward movement later this
afternoon.  A few of the stronger storms may attain supercellular
characteristics and pose a risk for large hail.  Severe gusts could
become more prevalent if/once storms cluster and congeal east of
I-25 during the early evening before low-level lapse rates lessen
with the loss of heating.

Mesoscale Discussion 0970
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0215 PM CDT Sun May 25 2025

Areas affected...Atlantic Coast portions of SC and GA into the FL
Panhandle.

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 251915Z - 252115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered thunderstorms along multiple sea-breeze
boundaries will support a risk for occasional damaging gusts or
sporadic hail this afternoon. A WW is not expected.

DISCUSSION...As of 1915 UTC, regional radar and satellite showed
scattered to numerous thunderstorms erupting along the Atlantic
Coasts of GA and SC, extending southward across much of the FL
Peninsula. Driven largely by diurnal heating and localized
confluence along typical sea-breeze boundaries, a few stronger
multicells/clusters have been noted recently. With little in the way
of upper-level forcing for ascent, convection has been largely
unorganized and is expected to remain as such. However, additional
clustering may support stronger cold pool development with time.
This could allow for occasional damaging gusts and wet microbursts
given the high PWATs (~1.8-2 inches) air mass. Sporadic hail is also
possible with the more intense updrafts given around 2000 J/kg of
MLCAPE. While occasional damaging gusts and hail are possible, the
lack of broader upper-level support suggests the severe risk will be
transient/isolated. A WW is not expected this afternoon.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 321
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1145 PM CDT Sat May 24 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Far Northwest Arkansas

  until 700 AM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
    inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm coverage is expected to increase tonight
across northern OK into southern KS and adjacent portions of far
northwest AR and far southwest MO. Steep mid-level lapse rates and
strong vertical shear will support the potential for large hail.
Isolated damaging gusts are also possible, particularly across
southwestern KS where a potential bowing segment may move into the
region from the northwest.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 55
statute miles north and south of a line from 20 miles west southwest
of Garden City KS to 30 miles east of Grove OK. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU1).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.
