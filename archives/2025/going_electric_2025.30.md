## This cool-looking electric motorcycle wants to pretend to be an e-bike [Update]

With throwback café racer design and a respectable top speed of 45 mph (72 km/h), it’s a slick little ride with a curious twist: it calls itself an e-bike.</p>



<p>[Update: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the Beachman ’64 E-bike did not have pedals. In fact, it does have small cranks and pedals folded up against the bike, mounted to the swingarm.] </p>
