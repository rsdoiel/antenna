The design is bold, brutalist, and unapologetically industrial. As a first product offering, it does a great job of catching people’s attention. Whether you like the look or not is up to you, but there is no denying that it is a head-turner. So when I had the opportunity to get some hands-on time with it, I knew I had to jump at that chance. </p>



<p>And after just an hour of riding the P1 around NYC, I can confidently say this thing turns heads for good reason. It’s fast, futuristic, and fun. This is just a first impression, but I’ll have it for an extended period soon — so stay tuned for a deeper dive and complete review. For now, let’s talk about my experience. </p>

## This cool-looking electric motorcycle wants to pretend to be an e-bike [Update]

date: 2025-07-27, from: Electrek Feed

<div class="feat-image"><img src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/07/beachman-64-header.webp?w=1600" /></div><p>Canadian startup Beachman has just unveiled its latest electric two-wheeler, the ’64, a vintage-styled electric motorcycle that looks like it rolled straight out of the 1960s. With throwback café racer design and a respectable top speed of 45 mph (72 km/h), it’s a slick little ride with a curious twist: it calls itself an e-bike.</p>



<p>[Update: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the Beachman ’64 E-bike did not have pedals. In fact, it does have small cranks and pedals folded up against the bike, mounted to the swingarm.] </p>
