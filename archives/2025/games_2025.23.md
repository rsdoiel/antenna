## Lost in Random: The Eternal Die is a welcome entry to roguelike canon

date: 2025-06-10, updated: 2025-06-03, from: Polygon Website

Lost in Random: The Eternal Die stuck its hooks in me after just a few rooms. Dashing between enemy projectile attacks and then slicing those enemies up, I quickly got into a rhythm with the roguelike’s combat, which reminded me of Hades in all the best ways. It also has enough fresh gameplay ideas to [&#8230;]

## All character weight classes in Mario Kart World

date: 2025-06-09, updated: 2025-06-09, from: Polygon Website

Weight classes in Mario Kart World work much like they do in Mario Kart 8, in that they determine how a kart performs. With no kart customization in World, though, a character’s weight class is the sole influencing factor on your kart’s stats. There’s no quick-and-easy way to see who belongs in what category, and [&#8230;]

## Elden Ring Nightreign’s rarest item could be hiding the game’s biggest secret

date: 2025-06-09, updated: 2025-06-09, from: Polygon Website

The first time I saw the Cord End on the ground in Elden Ring Nightreign, I was vexed. The enigmatic item had a simple description: “Gain entry somewhere.” Where is somewhere, you might ask? Good question. I didn’t find out during that playthrough. Painfully, I relinquished the item on the floor in the waiting area [&#8230;]

## Nintendo made a fantastic Mario Kart, but a half-baked World

date: 2025-06-09, updated: 2025-06-09, from: Polygon Website

Mario Kart 8 — especially in its 68-million-selling Deluxe form on Nintendo Switch — is the definitive Mario Kart, and perhaps it always will be. It has the crispness and technicality of 1992’s Super; the rollicking, combative multiplayer of 64; the accessibility and gloss of Mario Kart Wii. Refined and expanded over 10 years, it [&#8230;]
