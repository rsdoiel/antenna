movies on Netflix right now</h2>

<p>[Ghostface voice] Do you like scary movies? [Slightly less Ghostface
voice] Do you, like 300 million other human beings on the planet Earth,
have a Netflix account? Then, logically, you’ve probably found yourself
scrolling around, looking to find the best horror movies on the service.

<p>date: 2025-03-10, updated: 2025-03-07, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>A few years ago, a sound bite went viral on TikTok: “Darling, I’ve
told you several times before, I have no dream job. I do not dream of
labor.” As writer Caitlyn Clark put it in Jacobin at the time, it’s no
surprise that the statement resonated with people: a “tighter labor
market,” Clark wrote, […]</p>

<p>At Polygon, we want to introduce you to at least one thing we think
you’d love every single day. With so many games, movies, shows, and
internet-based quick bites (or “quibis”) out there to experience, we
know it’s next to impossible to decide how to take a chance on the
untested, dive into the unknown. […]</p>

<p>We won’t know what The Fantastic Four: First Steps is really about
until it hits theaters this July. Or… won’t we? I’m Polygon’s resident
comic book expert, and I’m ready to place some bets.  I may not know the
plot of Marvel Studios’ big swing on Marvel’s First Family, but I bet I

<p>date: 2025-03-09, updated: 2025-03-09, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Creators always feel extra pressure when adapting work by their
favorite authors. That pressure only multiplies when that author’s other
work led to one of the most celebrated and popular television series
ever. That was the test Paul W.S. Anderson and Milla Jovovich faced with
In the Lost Lands, their new dark fantasy Western movie, […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-03-09, updated: 2025-03-07, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Bong Joon Ho’s latest movie, Mickey 17, is a lot of things. It’s a
story about work, cloning, colonization, inequality, first contact, and
the evils of capitalism. It’s a satire, a slapstick comedy, and a sci-fi
epic. It also belongs to one of the rarest and strangest subgenres of
film: doppelgänger movies. Robert Pattinson plays […]</p>

<p>Developer LocalThunk, the anonymous individual who made Balatro,
recently published an extensive breakdown of how they made the game. The
post, which details all the milestones involved with launching the indie
game, goes deep on personal experiences, from self-doubt and disbelief
at his success to serious health concerns and anxiety attacks. It’s also
about the […]</p>

<p>The perfect murder mystery is a rare thing to come by these days.
Procedurals are a dime a dozen, of course; for FBI agents alone there’s
a whole universe. But the art of a murder mystery is something more
specific. Plenty of episodic procedurals borrow the idea and contain
each investigation to a single episode; […]</p>
