into the protein domains of C-VI TRIM subfamily in viral infection</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Tripartite motif (TRIM) proteins, defined by their conserved RBCC
domain architecture, play key roles in various cellular processes and
virus-host interactions. In this review, we focus on Class VI TRIM
proteins, including TRIM24, TRIM28, and TRIM33, highlighting the
distinct functional attributes of their RING, B-BOX1, B-BOX2, COILED
COIL, PHD, and BRD domains in viral infection. Through multiple sequence
alignment, we delineate both the conserved and divergent features within
this subclass, underscoring the uniqueness of Class VI TRIM protein.
Additionally, we explore the post-translational modifications (PTMs) of
Class VI TRIM proteins including their functional differences in
modulating viral infection. Moreover, we examine the C-VI TRIM protein
complexes and their significant contributions to the antiviral response.
Furthermore, we discuss small molecule ligands targeting Class VI TRIM
domains, with a focus on druggable structural motifs. Understanding the
multi-domain features of TRIM proteins is crucial for developing
effective antiviral strategies and the therapeutic modulation of their
activity.</p>

status, research, and development in Lower Mekong Basin</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The family Ganodermataceae encompasses several genera, including the
widely studied Ganoderma, which is prominent in traditional medicine for
its therapeutic properties. Species within this family, particularly
Ganoderma lucidum, have been valued for centuries in regions such as
China, Korea, and Japan for enhancing vitality, longevity, and overall
health. However, the taxonomy of Ganodermataceae remains complex, with
ongoing debates about species identification and classification. Members
of this family are globally distributed, with the Lower Mekong
Basin—comprising Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam—offering optimal
conditions for their growth due to its warm, humid climate. In the Lower
Mekong Basin, the species of Ganodermataceae are significant for their
medicinal applications in treating conditions such as bronchitis,
hepatitis, diabetes, and cancer. They also hold significant economic
value, being used in products like teas, dietary supplements, and
cosmetics. Ganoderma lucidum is particularly notable as a high-value
market product in this region. Recent research has revealed a rich
diversity of Ganodermataceae species in the region, highlighting their
ecological roles, medicinal properties, and importance in plant
pathology, particularly in addressing diseases in crops such as oil
palm. These findings underscore the need for further research into the
taxonomy, ecological functions, and potential applications of
Ganodermataceae species. Advancing our understanding will support
sustainable utilization, conservation efforts, and the maximization of
their medicinal and commercial benefits.</p>

resistance, virulence gene, phylogenetic group and genetic diversity of
Escherichia coli isolated from Tibetan pig farms in Garze Tibetan
Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan, China</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionTo investigate the correlations among antibiotic
resistance, virulence gene, phylogenetic group, and genetic diversity,
providing essential data for Escherichia coli (E. coli) infection
prevention and control in Tibetan pigs.MethodsA total of 244 E. coli
isolates were collected. Antimicrobial susceptibility was assessed using
the microdilution method. PCR was used to detect antibiotic resistance
genes (ARGs), virulence genes, and phylogenetic groups. Genetic
diversity was analyzed using enterobacterial repetitive element
sequence-based PCR. Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) 5-12, a
representative strain with multidrug resistance and strong
biofilm-forming ability, harboring abundant virulence genes, was
selected for whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to validate PCR
results.ResultsAmong the 244 isolates, 84.43% showed multidrug
resistance (MDR), with the highest resistance rates for chloramphenicol
(99.59%), sulfadiazine (96.31%), and sulfamethoxazole (93.85%).
Twenty-five ARGs were detected, with ant(3’)-Ia, blaTEM, aac(3’)-II,
floR, and qnrS exceeding 80% detection rates. Integrase genes intl1 and
intl2 were found in 90.16% and 15.16% of isolates, respectively.
Seventeen virulence genes were detected; bcsA (98.77%), fimC (89.75%),
and agn43 (59.43%) were the most prevalent. A total of 106 virulence
patterns were identified, with agn43/bcsA/fimC being predominant
(17.92%). Most strains belonged to phylogenetic group A (45.90%),
followed by B1 (34.43%), while 29 strains were unclassified. Sixty-four
isolates were identified as diarrheagenic E. coli (DEC), predominantly
enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC, 90.63%). Biofilm-forming ability was
categorized as strong (4.69%), moderate (21.88%), weak (59.38%), or
absent (14.06%). Clustering based on 61.2% similarity grouped the 64 DEC
into five clusters, with 84.38% in cluster II, which contained all
strong biofilm producers.DiscussionAntimicrobial resistance profiles of
EAEC 5–12 confirmed that primarily confer resistance through antibiotic
efflux, target alteration, and reduced permeability. These findings will
contribute to further understanding the positive correlation between
antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity in E. coli from Tibetan pig
farms, shedding light on the rational use of antimicrobial agents and
tackling the antibiotic resistance crisis in Tibetan pig breeding in
Garze Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan, China.</p>

ventilator-associated lower respiratory tract infection outcomes using
sequencing-based early microbiological response: a proof-of-concept
prospective study</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectivesVentilator-associated lower respiratory tract infections
(VA-LRTIs) cause significant mortality. This study was assigned to
explore the association between early microbiological responses defined
by quantitative targeted amplicon-based next-generation sequencing
(QtNGS) and clinical outcomes in patients with Acinetobacter
baumannii-dominant VA-LRTI.Measurements and main resultsA prospective
observational study including 34 participants was conducted to assess
the probability of predicting clinical outcomes using sequencing-based
early microbiological response. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALFs)
were collected at admission and 3 days post-treatment from these
patients for QtNGS to determine the relative quantification ratio (RQR)
of A. baumannii. Patients were categorized into survival (n=26) and
non-survival (n=8) groups. The RQR was calculated as the quantification
of A. baumannii determined by QtNGS after treatment to pretreatment. RQR
significantly increased on day 4 in the non-survival group (median
5.285), and decreased in the survival group (median 0.1864). Receiver’s
operation characteristic curves revealed that an RQR ≥1.41 was
predictive of poor outcomes, with an area under the curve of 0.9471
(0.8759-1). The accuracy of the RQR determined by QtNGS was further
evaluated by retesting the same specimen using digital droplet PCR, and
the linear correlation was confirmed in the RQR calculated by two
methods. The 23 patients with RQR&lt;1.41 all survived for 28 days,
whereas the survival rate for the 11 patients with RQR ≥1.41 was 27.27%.
RQR was significantly and positively correlated with the length of ICU
stay in survivors.ConclusionsThe RQR of A. baumannii detected by QtNGS
correlates with the prognosis of VA-LRTI patients.</p>
