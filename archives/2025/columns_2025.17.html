Swift Concurrency has been a bumpy business
</p>
<p>
But yesterday, there I was, minding my own thread and wrote some code
backed by my 30 years of experience and Swift was having none of it
</p>
<p>
Took me a moment to realize that the compiler was right, fixed the flaw
and moved on with life
</p>
<p>
Nice progression: from wasting weeks tracking an obscure race condition
that rarely ever happens, to fighting the compiler for half an hour, to
accepting my role as a meat-based LLM that writes thread safe code

<p>
That is, running the Alps with a heart for plants! We arrived in the
Vallais today and as soon as we had emptied our luggage we decided to go
for a jogging-hike to the Cave du Sex (yeah, that‚Äôs the name! Or Cave du
Scex. üòÖ) and we took some pictures on the way.

From the Cave du Sex we were running along the Bisse du Tsittoret
towards Colombire. This an old waterway along the mountainside to
transport water from one alp to the next. It has been restored for the
tourists and it‚Äôs super nice. Pretty nice for running, since it follows
the gentle slope along the waster.

<p>
The bisse empties into a wild mountain river. A few meters downhill
there‚Äôs a new beginning but the sluice gate was closed. As it turns out,
the bisse got replenished quickly from new rivulets joining from the
mountain.

This is La Sign√®se, according to Open Street Map (OSM). I also saw it

There‚Äôs a nice view point, there.

Plant identification mostly done by Flora Incognita

the mushroom I fell back to Seek by iNaturalist. What I love about Flora
Incognita is that I can follow links to all sorts of reference works,
including Wikipedia. Seek, on the other, has nothing. No longer
explanation, no link to Wikipedia. Truly, a lost opportunity.

2025-04-27 Structural navigation
</h1>
<p>
Sometimes my mind goes back to text editing and text editors. I have a
love/hate relationship with ed(1). I kind of like the deliberate mindset
I need to bring. But I also don‚Äôt like to think in terms of lines. Maybe
if each sentence is a line, that‚Äôs better. But I often think about
better semantic addressing.
</p>
<p>
Example: <code>p</code> prints a range of line(s) is the standard. What
I would also like is ‚Äúprint a range of paragraph‚Äù, ‚Äúprint a range of
sentences‚Äù, ‚Äúprint a range of words‚Äù. There‚Äôs a hierarchy, here. So once
there‚Äôs a ‚Äúcurrent‚Äù paragraph, you can list its sentences or its words.
My hope is that this is more useful than working on lines.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm still struggling to invent a command language, however. ‚ÄúPrint
paragraph. Next. Next. Number sentences. Third sentence. Replace this
with that. Print paragraph.‚Äù I think this how I would work? ‚ÄúLast
paragraph. Insert paragraph. Start typing.‚Äù Would that be <code>p p n 3s
/this/that/ p</code> and <code>par $ i ‚Ä¶</code> Effectively,
<code>p</code> switches to paragraphs and prints them, and moves to the
next one if used without a range. <code>n</code> numbers the items one
level down. In this case, with a paragraph selected, <code>n</code>
numbers the sentences. <code>s</code> switches to sentences and prints
them. I‚Äôm not sure about the search &amp; replace command. Is that also
<code>s</code>?
</p>
<p>
Should the data be kept in a tree? Should reading the text involve a
real parser that delivers a sort of abstract syntax tree and names the
nodes which automatically turn into commands?
</p>
<p>
And then: should this be written in Perl? üòç
</p>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://mastodon.acm.org/@mxp" title="@mxp@mastodon.acm.org"><span
class="citation" data-cites="mxp">@mxp</span></a> said he had written
¬´an Emacs interface to a syntactic parser¬ª, but I‚Äôm not sure this is
what I‚Äôm looking for. A natural language parser (NLP) is maybe not what
I‚Äôm looking for. I suspect it would help avoid grammar mistakes, which
makes sense to me. But is it what need as I write?
</p>
<p>
He then pointed me at Engelbart‚Äôs
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/1476589.1476645">A research center for
augmenting human intellect</a>. There, we find
<a href="https://communitywiki.org/wiki/PurpleNumbers">purple
numbers</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The principal manifestation of this hierarchical structure is the
breaking up of text into arbitrary segments called ‚Äústatements,‚Äù each of
which bears a number showing its serial location in the text and its
‚Äúlevel‚Äù in an ‚Äúoutline‚Äù of the text.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I‚Äôm not sure about the use of an outline. Many people seem to like
outlines, but for me an outline as a writing tool is weird. I never
start with an outline, except for cases where I know I need to follow a
structure and even then the structure is usually trivial: Introduction,
Materials and Methods, Results, Discussion, References, or something
along these lines. A bunch of headings is all I need. Do I need an
outline view? I agree that showing all the headings is important to
navigate any non-trivial text document when you‚Äôre reading and working
with it. But if I focus on writing, the outline doesn‚Äôt seem too
important. It‚Äôs too far ‚Äúup‚Äù in the structure, for me.
</p>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://mastodon.acm.org/@CerstinMahlow" title="@CerstinMahlow@mastodon.acm.org"><span
class="citation" data-cites="CerstinMahlow">@CerstinMahlow</span></a>
wrote a position paper:
<a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2303.17894">Writing Tools:
Looking Back to Look Ahead</a> where she argues that ¬´new writing tools
should be inspired by ‚Äúfailed‚Äù projects from the 1970s and 1980s¬ª and
discusses the current state of affairs:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
One type of functionality that Mahlow and Piotrowski suggest are
information functions that use NLP techniques to highlight certain
aspects of the evolving text, commonly referred to as ‚Äúsyntax
highlighting.‚Äù Since 2013, iA Writer has offered such a feature in a
commercial product to specifically highlight nouns, verbs, adjectives,
etc., advertising it as ‚Äúusing parts of speech to improve your writing‚Äù
and explicitly stating that writers deserve the same professional
support as programmers.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This goes in a different direction, ‚Äúdown‚Äù to the grammar roles of
words. Nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs. The problem is that when I
write, I hardly ever worry about a particular verb. I never want to
navigate to the accusative object of this sentence or focus on the
subject. This is a very detailed view that I don‚Äôt care about.
</p>
<p>
The question is: What do I care about? Moving sentences around. Starting
sentences between some other sentences and then realizing that I started
at the wrong place and moving that fragments around. I think what I need
is a prototype editor that I can start using and where I can easily add
and remove functionality. And I‚Äôm not sure that Emacs is the correct
environment because there is so damn much to distract me.
</p>
<p>
<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Editors">#Editors</a>
</p>
<p>
<strong>2025-05-03</strong>. I wrote a little Perl script called
<code>scr</code> that opens a bunch of files and allows me to navigate
using p for paragraph, s for sentence and w for word. Typing the letter
with an optional range:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
p prints the current paragraph, one sentence per line
</li>
<li>
s prints the current sentence
</li>
<li>
w prints the current word
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Use an address prefix like ed:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
a number prints the element with that number (currently zero indexed
because I was lazy)
</li>
<li>
$ prints the last element (the first one is 0 but the last one requires
counting)
</li>
<li>
plus and a number or minus and a number prints the element relative the
current one (so +1p prints the next paragraph)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Use address prefixes like ed:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
two such numbers separated by a comma prints the range (so 0,2s prints
the first three sentences)
</li>
<li>
if you use a comma but just one number the other number is replaced by
the current address (so ,+2w prints the current word and the next two)
</li>
<li>
if you use just the comma, this prints all the elements (so ,p is the
same as 0,$p and prints the whole file)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Currently whitespace is not significant:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
multiple whitespace characters collapse
</li>
<li>
leading and trailing whitespace disappears
</li>
</ul>

# Warfare

<u>0 0:</u> 1p
Im Telepolis Artikel _Der Krieg wird zum Terroranschlag_ [¬π](http://www.heise.de/tp/deutsch/special/irak/15069/1.html) steht, was mich auch schon im Fall von [Israel](Israel) graust: Auf blossen Verdacht hin werden Leute erschossen.
Kein Gericht.
Keine Verteidigung.
Ein Geheimdiensturteil, und schon wird ein Auto beschossen, um irgendeinen Anf√ºhrer zu t√∂ten.
Dabei sterben Leibw√§chtern, Unbeteiligte, und wohlm√∂glich noch eine Frau oder ein Kind.
Sowas kennt man aus Israel.
Im Iraq ist man nun eine Stufe weiter.
Man bombardiert Luxuslimousinen (die sicher irgendeinem Schuft geh√∂ren ‚Äì aber haben er und _alle_ Insassen wirklich die Todesstrafe verdient?
Geh√∂rt die nicht vielmehr abgeschafft?) ‚Äì und nachher ist nicht mal klar, wenn man √ºberhaupt _versucht_ hat zu t√∂ten.
Unfassbar.

<u>0 1:</u> 2s
Keine Verteidigung.

<u>0 1 2:</u> 0w
Keine

<u>0 1 2 0:</u> q
</pre>
<p>
The prompt current prints file number, paragraph number, sentence
number, word number.
</p>
<p>
The example also shows problems handling parentheticals (or quote).
</p>
<p>
I think before I can move on to insert or append operations, I need to
further investigate navigation and selection. I‚Äôd like to remember
context, so 1p p should print paragraph number one and then the next one
without me having to type +1p. Perhaps we can use a period for the
current one. So .p prints the current paragraph again.
</p>
<p>
I also think that a paragraph print should forget the sentence and word
position. That currently doesn‚Äôt happen.

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Pistons">Detroit

was really gratified, ecstatic even, to see the Timberwolves give the

I am so fed up with LeBron James. I can‚Äôt imagine another team would
want him. I can‚Äôt imagine why he wants to win <i>another</i> freaking
title. And I was really pissed off when people started saying they were
contenders this year. Bull. Shit. And the reason I‚Äôm glad it was the
Timberwolves is because
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Randle">Julius Randle</a>
is on that team now, and I hear he gets a fair amount of credit for
their victory. The Knicks traded him for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Anthony_Towns">KAT</a> last
summer. They‚Äôre a solid team. And while
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo">Donte
DiVincenzo</a> isn‚Äôt playing very well, we really need him back in NY,
so maybe the Knicks can figure out a deal that makes sense. And why
aren‚Äôt the Knicks playing

Achiuwa</a>. He did great last year when
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OG_Anunoby">OG</a> was injured.
The Knicks have a good bench imho, they just don‚Äôt get to play enough to
be warmed up properly. So sad the way
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_McBride">Doooooce</a>
performed in the Detroit series. Anyway it was exhausting. I would have
been okay with the DP‚Äôs winning, seriously ‚Äì I‚Äôm ready for baseball. And
I don‚Äôt imagine the next series, with the Celtics will be any kind of a
walk in the park.</p>

<h2 id="on-becoming-living-history">On becoming living history</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-03, from: Liam on Linux</p>
<p>
It is one of the oddest things in computing that stuff to me, as a big
kid of heading for 60 years old but who still feels quite young and
enjoys learning and exploring, that the early history of Linux ‚Äì a
development that came along mid-career for me ‚Äì and indeed Unix, which
was taking shape when I was a child, is mysterious lost ancient history
now to those working in the field.
</p>
<p>
It‚Äôs not that long ago. It‚Äôs well within living memory for lots of us
<em>who are still working with it in full time employment.</em> Want to
know why this command has that weird switch? Then go look up who wrote
it and <em>ask him</em>. (And sadly yes there‚Äôs a good chance it‚Äôs a
‚Äúhim‚Äù.)
</p>
<p>
Want to know why Windows command switches are one symbol and Unix ones
another? Go look at the OSes the guys who wrote them ran before. They
are a 2min Google away and emulators are FOSS. Just try them and you can
see what they learned from.
</p>
<p>
This stuff isn‚Äôt hieroglyphics. It‚Äôs not carved on the walls of tombs
deep underground.
</p>
<p>
The reason that we have Snap and Flatpak and AppImage and macOS
<code>.app</code> is all stuff that happened since I started my first
job. I was there. So were thousands of others. I watched it take shape.
</p>
<p>
But now, I write about how and why and I get shouted at by people who
weren‚Äôt even born yet. It‚Äôs very odd.
</p>
<p>
To me it looks like a lot of people spend thousands of developer-hours
flailing away trying to rewrite stuff that I deployed in production in
my 30s and they have no idea how it‚Äôs supposed to work or what they‚Äôre
trying to do. They‚Äôre failing to copy a bad copy of a poor imitation.
</p>
<p>
Want to know how KDE 6 should have been? Run Windows 95 in VirtualBox
and see how the original worked! But no, instead, the team flops and
flails adding 86 more wheels to a bicycle and then they wonder why
people choose a poor-quality knock-off of a 2007 iPhone designed by
people who don‚Äôt know why the iPhone works like that.
</p>
<p>I am, for clarity, talking about GNOME &gt;3. And the iPhone runs a
cut down version of Mac OS X Tiger‚Äôs ‚ÄúDashboard‚Äù as its main
UI.¬†<br /><br /><img src="https://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=liam_on_linux&ditemid=95105" width="30" height="12" alt="comment count unavailable" style="vertical-align: middle;"/>

<h2 id="ncsc-guidance-on-advanced-cryptography">NCSC Guidance on
‚ÄúAdvanced Cryptography‚Äù</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-02, updated: 2025-05-01, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
The UK‚Äôs National Cyber Security Centre just released its
<a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/whitepaper/advanced-cryptography">white
paper</a> on ‚ÄúAdvanced Cryptography,‚Äù which it defines as ‚Äúcryptographic
techniques for processing encrypted data, providing enhanced
functionality over and above that provided by traditional cryptography.‚Äù
It includes things like homomorphic encryption, attribute-based
encryption, zero-knowledge proofs, and secure multiparty computation.
</p>
<p>
It‚Äôs full of good advice. I especially appreciate this warning:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
When deciding whether to use Advanced Cryptography, start with a clear
articulation of the problem, and use that to guide the development of an
appropriate solution. That is, you should not start with an Advanced
Cryptography technique, and then attempt to fit the functionality it
provides to the problem. ‚Ä¶

official responsible for including the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic
on an unsecure Signal chat in which leaders shared classified
information about a military strike on the Houthis in Yemen.</p>

<p>The title is all wrong because I extensively used the TRG Pro in the
past. But the last time when I synced the TRG was in 2/2016 and then I
have been using the original Palm III devices (IIIx + IIIxe) instead of
the TRG. I have not wanted to damage or lost my only TRG Pro (which is
pretty rare as you may know). Now I have two TRGs so I can use one of
them on daily basis, I think.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm trying to set up a standing desk in my office. I found a (less or

keyboard and mouse.</p>

<p>I tried to add a Raspberry Pi model B. It seems to work (I have to
figure how to set up the EDUROAM WiFi on the Raspbian) and it‚Äôs
relatively slow. I need network connection here only for some tasks so
slow connection and even slower WWW browser may be OK. I should test it
LaTeX works (I think that I even didn‚Äôt tried to install it).</p>

<a href="https://www.today.com/video/flashback-watch-bernie-sanders-today-interview-from-1981-1448099395517">interview
with Bernie Sanders</a> from 1981, then-mayor of Burlington, VT. He was
a novelty then, an American politician who was a socialist. He was asked
if capitalism was the normal way for humans to relate, he said no. I
wonder if he still agrees, because I think that‚Äôs the goal, and the
reason we‚Äôre in so much trouble is there really isn‚Äôt an impulse to work
with each other. What I‚Äôve seen mostly is that when there‚Äôs work to do,
it‚Äôs hard to find help, but once something has taken off, there isn‚Äôt
much help available either, the people who could make the greatest
contribution just want to take over. And they often feel they have, but
usually it doesn‚Äôt work out, it would have been better if we all
collaborated. At this point, the hurdle the human race has to get over
<i>is</i> working together. We will never get out of the climate crisis
without it, or avoid the next pandemic without millions of unnecessarily
lost lives. The cynics are winning, basically ‚Äì and there isn‚Äôt net-net
much of a will for our species to survive. It‚Äôs only getting worse.</p>

<p>I turned yesterday‚Äôs
<a href="http://scripting.com/code/baselineplayground/">Baseline
Playground</a> into a
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/baselinePlayground">GitHub
repo</a>. I never made one of these before and thought it was worth
sharing, or just writing about. I‚Äôm struggling to find the most readable
font, size, line-height. I‚Äôm looking at the screen where I do most of my
online writing, and I find this very readable, it just fades into the
background, to the base of the spine, so intrinsic it occupies none of
my conscious mind. Anyway the purpose of the baseline is to give
WordLand a target to work out all the glitches in, so the writing
experience goes fully end-to-end. I didn‚Äôt find any WordPress themes
that I felt worked really well for this, so we set out to create one.
Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/scotthansonde">Scott Hansen</a>
who is using my work to build out a
<a href="https://github.com/scotthansonde/wordlandBaseline">WordPress
theme</a> and thanks to <a href="https://github.com/jeherve">Jeremy
Herve</a> for helping us work with WordPress, which is more than a CMS,
it‚Äôs a network OS. There‚Äôs a lot of value in the WordPress platform that
has been widely overlooked, imho.</p>

<p>I really dislike how the Lynx WWW browser looks on some modern
systems. On my SGI it was OK - it simply respected IRIS terminal colors.
On modern systems in seems to be full of colors with gray background.
Text colors are quite nice but I have disliked the gray background. I
have wished to have or black one or transparent one (it a terminal
emulator supports transparency).</p>

does not work, unfortunately). And she is happy with it.</p>

<p>Things are continuously developing or at least changing. For example,
my gVim on my GPD Pocket (Ubuntu MATE 18.04) has issues with text
encoding. If I create a new file then I everything is OK. But when I
save it and re-open it then it en-codes local language characters
incorrectly. It is strange because I have been using the same
.vimrc/.gvimrc for ages on several Linux machines and I never
encountered such behaviour.</p>

<p>According to Joseph Cox at 404, the U.S. government registered the
domains thetrilliondollardinner.gov, dinnerforamerica.gov, and
thetrillion.gov. All of these (correct me if I‚Äôm wrong) are about
enriching the U.S. president, his family, and favored friends through a
memecoin scheme by which anyone (say, Putin) can buy influence. There is
nothing conservative about this. Nothing republican. [‚Ä¶]</p>

<h2 id="how-blogs-show-their-site-title">How blogs show their site
title</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-30, from: Dave Winer‚Äôs Scripting News</p>
<p>
We‚Äôre working on the ‚Äúbaseline‚Äù theme for WordLand, the default ‚Äì the
one that shows the user‚Äôs writing in a WordPress context. I did a survey
of news sites and blogs to see how they show their titles:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://gothamist.com/news/gov-hochul-says-ny-budget-will-create-50m-rental-aid-program-championed-by-tenant-groups">Gothamist</a>
puts the name in the upper left corner, leaving room for some buttons
and a menu in the right corner.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/redditor-accidentally-reinvents-discarded-90s-tool-to-escape-todays-age-gates/">Ars
Technica</a> does something similar, name of site in upper left corner,
with an array of buttons flush right.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.emptywheel.net/2025/04/30/three-coequal-timelines-of-government/">Empty
Wheel</a> does the same thing. (I sense a pattern here.)
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://missouriindependent.com/2025/04/30/missouri-lawmakers-should-reject-fake-chaplains-in-schools-bill/">Missouri
Independent</a> centers the title in much bigger type than the previous
examples, the buttons are arrayed above it (more buttons).
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://evgrieve.com/2025/04/east-village-mainstay-cafe-mogador.html">EV
Grieve</a> puts the name in the upper left corner without much fanfare.
Proves that it doesn‚Äôt have to be eye-catching, it‚Äôs the attitude and
the content I love. One of my longtime favorites. It‚Äôs an East Village
neighborhood blog, running in Blogger for ages.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://seths.blog/2025/04/uncomfortable-ideas/">Seth‚Äôs
Blog</a> is a WordPress site, managed by Automattic. The left sidebar
includes the title of the blog, and has a list of things he wants you to
read, and how to get on his mail list, etc. So effectively the title is
in the upper left corner, and the equiv of the buttons are arrayed
vertically in a column. The functionality of his blog is probably
closest to what I have in mind for WordLand, but into spartan
beginnings. It‚Äôs easy to add stuff, impossible to take away.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/30/sycophancy-in-gpt-4o/#atom-everything">Simon
Willison‚Äôs Weblog</a>, another great example of the kind of writing I
want people to do with WordLand. He puts the title in the upper left
corner, with a single button flush right. He deals with the recent
articles thing by putting a list of three posts, linkblog style, at the
bottom. I like this placement, btw. Positioned as an afterthought. If
you‚Äôre lingering here, you might like this? I pretty much always ignore
this kind of stuff.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.manton.org/2025/04/29/model-train-at-the-casey.html">Manton
Reece</a> does the same thing everyone else is doing. Title at the top
left, an array of buttons flush-right at the same level. What‚Äôs uncommon
about his style is that the name of his blog is tiny, 13px. But it also
is very visible.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://kottke.org/25/04/0046739-trump-is-a-hallucinating-">Kottke</a>
does not include the title of his blog on a story page. This is
remarkable. But he does have the author name very prominently placed,
it‚Äôs the very topmost text on the page, impossible to miss. So amazingly
the title is visible, even though it isn‚Äôt there.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/04/29/cheaters-and-liars/https://pluralistic.net/2025/04/29/cheaters-and-liars/https://pluralistic.net/2025/04/29/cheaters-and-liars/https://pluralistic.net/2025/04/29/cheaters-and-liars/">Pluralistic</a>
puts the title in big type flush left, with a subtitle, and the buttons
are below the title, before the headline of the post (lots of white
space separating).
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Meta is suing NSO Group,
<a href="https://cyberscoop.com/whatsapp-nso-group-trial-judge-limits-evidence-2025/">basically
claiming</a> that the latter hacks WhatsApp and not just WhatsApp users.
We have a procedural ruling:

<blockquote>
<p>
Under
<a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/16395340/686/whatsapp-inc-v-nso-group-technologies-limited/">the
order</a>, NSO Group is prohibited from presenting evidence about its
customers‚Äô identities, implying the targeted WhatsApp users are
suspected or actual criminals, or alleging that WhatsApp had
insufficient security protections.

Hamilton said NSO Group undercut its arguments to use evidence about its
customers with contradictory statements‚Ä¶

<p>I really dislike how the Lynx WWW browser looks on some modern

On modern systems in seems to be full of colors with gray background.
Text colors are quite nice but I have disliked the gray background. I
have wished to have or black one or transparent one (it a terminal
emulator supports transparency).</p>

<p>Today my wife requested new keyboard. I thought that the Apple

Well, it is. So I have replaced it by spare HP one. A HP keyboard which
was a part of the PA-RISC Visualize workstation (the workstation itself
does not work, unfortunately). And she is happy with it.</p>

<p>Things are continuously developing or at least changing. For example,
my gVim on my GPD Pocket (Ubuntu MATE 18.04) has issues with text
encoding. If I create a new file then I everything is OK. But when I
save it and re-open it then it en-codes local language characters
incorrectly. It is strange because I have been using the same
.vimrc/.gvimrc for ages on several Linux machines and I never
encountered such behaviour.</p>

was down this morning</a>. Usually I don‚Äôt criticize a service when it‚Äôs
down, because I can relate. We like to help each other when there are
outages. But Bluesky is special, because they claim to be decentralized.
If it were, it wouldn‚Äôt go down unless the internet itself had. And
since the internet, amazingly, <i>is</i> decentralized, that‚Äôs not
likely to happen. It was designed that way when it was developed at
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET">Arpanet</a>, a project
of the US Department of Defense. It was designed to survive a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET#Inspiration">nuclear
strike</a>. Bluesky is nice, but it‚Äôs fragile, and their hype says
otherwise. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre special. They should straighten this out
so we can properly get decentralization into <i>our</i> networks.
Bluesky could easily add a layer of
<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> on top of what
they have, so that news flow could survive a disaster. In 2025 this is a
realistic concern, as it was in the 1960s. Also it would be nice if
other network experts would support this, esp if they‚Äôre on Bluesky.
This is not personal, if they wanted to get the RSS layer built, I would
help them do it. We should all pitch in because then it would really be
our network, and not owned by anyone. Live up to the promise, now.</p>

This seems like an
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/04/researchers-claim-breakthrough-in-fight-against-ais-frustrating-security-hole/">important
advance</a> in LLM security against prompt injection:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Google DeepMind has <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18813">unveiled
CaMeL</a> (CApabilities for MachinE Learning), a new approach to
stopping prompt-injection attacks that abandons the failed strategy of
having AI models police themselves. Instead, CaMeL treats language
models as fundamentally untrusted components within a secure software
framework, creating clear boundaries between user commands and
potentially malicious content.
</p>
<p>
[‚Ä¶]

<p>
To understand CaMeL, you need to understand that prompt injections
happen when AI systems can‚Äôt distinguish between legitimate user
commands and malicious instructions hidden in content they‚Äôre
processing‚Ä¶

<p>
Windscribe, a globally used privacy-first VPN service, announced today
that its founder, Yegor Sak, has been fully acquitted by a court in
Athens, Greece, following a two-year legal battle in which Sak was
personally charged in connection with an alleged internet offence by an
unknown user of the service.
</p>
<p>
The case centred around a Windscribe-owned server in Finland that was
allegedly used to breach a system in Greece. Greek authorities, in
cooperation with INTERPOL, traced the IP address to Windscribe‚Äôs
infrastructure and, unlike standard international procedures, proceeded
to initiate criminal proceedings against Sak himself, rather than
pursuing information through standard corporate channels‚Ä¶

<h2 id="dont-let-your-voice-be-flattened-by-the-√ºber-theme">Don‚Äôt let
your voice be flattened by the √ºber theme</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-28, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
I want you to have a blog. Despite this being nearly my entire online
ethos, one situation I struggle with are design systems and UX blogs on
Medium. A lot of them exist. Yet. I have difficulty understanding UX and
design professionals in this space who yield their UX and design
decisions over to the ‚Äúeveryone looks the same‚Äù content silo.
</p>
<p>
To be fair, I get why you or an organization would want to use a service
like Medium:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
People are busy and maintaining a blog is work.
</li>
<li>
It‚Äôs hard for the design team to get dev resources for a custom site.
</li>
<li>
There‚Äôs ‚Äúfree‚Äù community engagement there.
</li>
<li>
There‚Äôs even monetization paths.
</li>
<li>
Self-publishing obsessed dorks aren‚Äôt the target market.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Don‚Äôt get me wrong‚Äì I‚Äôd rather have more blogs than no blogs so if
that‚Äôs your situation don‚Äôt mind me and my niche beef. But consider for
a moment that I can‚Äôt tell you the last Medium post I‚Äôve read because
they‚Äôre all the same to me. I follow a lot of UX and design systems
blogs‚Ä¶ but I can‚Äôt tell you a single person who writes on Medium. Those
posts and authors have all blended together into a monolithic
groupthinkpiece where individual voices and personality are flattened by
the √ºber theme.
</p>
<p>
If everyone is wearing the same uniform, you all look the same. You are
interchangeable. Your voice exists in a crowded space of vanilla
platitudes. A recent WIRED article suggested over
<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-generated-medium-posts-content-moderation/">40%
of the content on Medium is AI generated</a> slop. I think the question
for you ‚Äìand for me‚Äì is how do you stand out in this <em>fancy
copy-pasted</em> new world? My personal belief is that the answer starts
with your own personal website that looks like you, talks like you,
smells like you, and has quirks like you. I want that for you.

<p>date: 2025-04-28, from: Dave Winer‚Äôs Scripting News</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm sick of saying this
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lnunfkdru22h">over
and over</a>, the Dems need a regular snark-filled irreverent presence
on social media to condemn every freaking fascist thing the Trumps do.
They had it with the Kamala accounts, but they shut them down on
Election Day.
</p>
<p>
It‚Äôs so freaking simple. Not having a raging presence on social media in
the future will be seen as like a successful company not being listed on
the NYSE, or a country not having a rep at the United Nations. Aside
from the cost of keeping a staff online 24x7, it‚Äôs free, and serves as
its own money-raising channel.
</p>
<p>
The Repubs figured this out in 2016.
</p>
<p>
Maybe what the Dems need is some entrepreneurs and comedians at the top
to actually get through to voters that say ‚ÄúHey we‚Äôre the Dems, we‚Äôre
here and we love America and we love you, Americans!‚Äù And actually make
a stink when they try to kill Social Security.
</p>
<p>
Another purpose ‚Äì tell people when the next pandemic is here. You know
the Trumps aren‚Äôt going to do that.

podcast</a> ‚Äì new problems popped up with websockets in WordLand. I
worked through the whole tree of possibilities with ChatGPT and it came
to the conclusion that the source was an out of date package, and it was
confident if I replaced it with the one ‚Äúeveryone else‚Äù is using, the
problems will go away. Now this is the moment when human judgement
prevails. I‚Äôm going to experiment in a very small app first, to make
sure I have the approach right, then I will cautiously make the change
on my test WordLand server, and if it works there, then I will figure
out how to install it on the main site. It couldn‚Äôt break all that much
because for some reason the WS code stopped working, completely, with no
code changes anywhere.</p>

Text colors are quite nice but I have disliked the gray background. I

<p>Today my wife requested new keyboard. I thought that the Apple

Well, it is. So I have replaced it by spare HP one. A HP keyboard which
was a part of the PA-RISC Visualize workstation (the workstation itself
does not work, unfortunately). And she is happy with it.</p>

<p>Lots of news reports about Trump‚Äôs polls. But it isn‚Äôt surprising
that in the transition from a democracy to autocracy the people would
become increasingly unhappy with the change, until we basically give up,
and the polls from some pollsters are always this way, but the polls
from others tell a different story. Fox News still runs polls the old
way, as does the NYT and others. But that will change, as the lawyers
have, and the Washington Post and NY Times have, in their editorial
functions. And they just arrested a judge in Wisconsin. Makes you think
maybe it doesn‚Äôt matter if the polls say what they say, if there isn‚Äôt
something behind them.</p>

<h2 id="nightly-email-switchover">Nightly email switchover</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-27, from: Dave Winer‚Äôs Scripting News</p>
<p>
If all goes as planned, if you‚Äôre subscribed to the
<a href="http://scripting.com/email/">nightly email</a>, you should get
two copies of the posts for April 27, one sent by the old software, and
one sent by the new. The new version might look better in your mail
reader app. That was the point of this transition.
</p>
<p>
Here‚Äôs a
<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdBkVybd_vaWT4oen5uNAEKxK8ztFUvAStcCq0Y8m-0VSsTNQ/viewform?usp=header">Google
form</a> where you can let me know how it went. Did it work? How many
emails did you get? Does the v2 email look better than the old version?
In general do you want to comment?
</p>
<p>
<b>The story</b>
</p>
<p>
I had to do a rewrite because when I originally wrote it, I
misunderstood how CSS styling works in some/most email clients and it
required a very deep rewrite of the software, it was actually harder to
do the conversion than it was to write the software in the first place.
And the app was running on an old version of PagePark and depended on
Dropbox, and had broken in many ways over the years. But I never had the
time to zero in on this.
</p>
<p>
Now was the time to do it, because I want to do an <i>excellent</i>
email sender for <a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a>. And in
order for that to have even a small chance of working, I needed to do
this transition, to get fully up to date on the best practices for HTML
email in 2025.
</p>
<p>
And yet another plug for ChatGPT. It‚Äôs like having a library of medical
journals for a general practitioner. I‚Äôm sure they have this, if a GP
has a question about which specialist to send a patient to. And then
they probably have good reference materials for the specialist too, to
be sure they‚Äôre using the latest proven techniques for treating disease.
Believe it or not we have nothing like this in software development.
Which means we don‚Äôt interop, and don‚Äôt use prior art and are constantly
reinventing each others‚Äô work because there‚Äôs no way to find out about
it. No conferences, no journals, nothing but hearsay and O‚ÄôReilly books
and I hear they aren‚Äôt very good these days. Enter ChatGPT, and all of a
sudden if you have a question it has the freaking answer. It‚Äôs as if
medicine went from the pre-internet days to now, in just a couple of
years. Only more so because medicine was considered a discipline, where
developing software never has been. Now at least us practitioners have
the tools if not the respect.
</p>

PS: The <a href="http://scripting.com/email/">signup page</a> moved to

<a href="https://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/sxsw/2025-04-26/huge-changes-in-sxsw-leadership/">Hugh
Forrest</a> was fired at SXSW. Many people loved him based on the
outpouring of grief, but I didn‚Äôt. They had keynotes and panels about
stuff I was working on at the time, in the 90s and 00s, blogging, RSS,
podcasting, bringing blogs to politics. He wouldn‚Äôt take my calls. I
wanted to be on stage to talk about what I was working on, and to set
the record straight on what we had created. Instead my competitors got
top billing and I was not allowed in. It felt corrupt to me, as if
someone was trading favors behind the scenes. My hope is now SXSW, or
whatever replaces it, will be more open-minded about who they include in
the show. I‚Äôm still working and still have a story to tell.</p>
