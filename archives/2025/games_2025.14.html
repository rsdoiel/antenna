<p>If there’s something gamers love in the fantasy genre, it’s when
ancient beings are sealed inside cool swords, from which they can only
whisper and beguile mortal beings. League of Legends takes this concept
even further with the Darkin by creating a whole arsenal of evil weapons
containing ancient evils.  The Darkin had a rough […]</p>

<p>Autonomous sensory meridian response, or ASMR, is a sensation where

<p>For those of us who grew up in the 1990s or early 2000s, A Goofy
Movie was everywhere. Substitute teachers showed it during the last lazy
days before summer vacation. Disney Channel played it during prime
cartoon-watching hours. And friends loaded up the VHS tape during
sleepovers. The 1995 blockbuster disappointment deserves the cult
classic […]</p>

the gaming company is looking to shut down the third-party buying and
selling of Roblox’s digital goods, in new court documents filed in late

<p>Last week, Nintendo revealed a ton of information about the Switch 2.
And while there were some surprises — like a bizarrely destructive
Donkey Kong game — the real shock was that of the sticker variety. The
