<p>date: 2025-04-07, updated: 2025-04-05, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Straight from Critical Role’s Exandria setting comes Der Katzenprinz
&amp; Other Zemnian Tales, a fully illustrated collection of fairy
tales. All three are native to the Zemni Fields, the northernmost region
of the Dwendalian Empire, and have been faithfully translated from the
original Zemnian. We’ve managed to pierce through time, space, and
reality to bring […]</p>

Switch 2 is so expensive, according to Nintendo</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-07, updated: 2025-04-07, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Last week, Nintendo revealed a ton of information about the Switch 2.
And while there were some surprises — like a bizarrely destructive
Donkey Kong game — the real shock was that of the sticker variety. The
prices of both the Switch 2 console ($449.99) and its games (as much as
$79.99 for Mario Kart […]</p>

<p>Nintendo has made its own Discord-like chat app for the Switch 2, and
it’s going to charge you for it. Once the free period is over on March
31, 2026, GameChat, and the C button that activates it, will require a
Nintendo Switch Online (NSO) membership. So what happens if you aren’t a
subscriber and […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-04-07, updated: 2025-04-07, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>There is something perfectly simple and catchy about the Wii eShop’s
theme song. It’s been remixed and parodied, even becoming the perfect
sketch fodder for Nirvana the Band the Show. You’re probably already
humming it right now. While that music was so iconic, there is a
surprisingly practical reason that later system shops, like the […]</p>

<p>Good news! If you’ve been fretting about abandoning your Animal
Crossing: New Horizons island save on a console that will rot away in
storage, then worry not. You’ll be able to seamlessly transfer your
island save data to the Nintendo Switch 2, without needing to download
an extra app or use a cloud save. The […]</p>

<p>The house at Mt. Holly has 45 rooms. But the placement of each of
those rooms is up to you — and it resets every day. You’ve been left the
house and its estate as an inheritance, but only if you can find the
mysterious 46th room.  In this way, Blue Prince blends its puzzles

<p>While Nintendo shared a lot about the hardware for Switch 2 during
its April 2 Direct and subsequent Treehouse streams, the company still
won’t share the exact workings of the second iteration of Joy-Con or Pro
Controller directional inputs. Specifically, it won’t confirm if the new
sticks will use Hall effect technology, which has been […]</p>

<p>The Switch 2 won’t be joining the Xbox and PlayStation consoles with
its own system-wide achievements, Nintendo confirmed to Polygon in a
recent interview. When we asked vice president of player and product
experience Bill Trinen if we can expect achievements, he gave a pretty
clear answer: “Nope.” Just like on Switch 1, it’ll be […]</p>

<p>Friend codes continue to exist on Nintendo Switch 2, but adding
people will be slightly easier than it was on Switch 1, Nintendo
confirmed to Polygon in a recent interview. The heart of the friends
list system on Switch 2 remains the same as it was on Switch 1. That’s
why you can transfer it […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-04-06, updated: 2025-04-04, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>When Nintendo launched the Switch in 2017, it had no competition in
dedicated handheld gaming, a sector it had established with the Game Boy
in 1989 and ruled ever since. Sega had come and gone; Sony, after two
determined attempts with the PlayStation Portable and PlayStation Vita,
had just about given up. As Switch 2 […]</p>

<p>As it barrels through its characteristically outlandish fourth and
final season, Danny McBride’s HBO comedy The Righteous Gemstones has
cemented a reputation for itself. Yes, it’s side-splittingly funny. Yes,
its “failchildren of a crumbling empire” narrative is surprisingly
relevant. Yes, there is a core of sincerity at the center of the
madness. But Gemstones’ legacy […]</p>

<p>I did something horrible. I told Jafar, the scheming vizier villain
in Disney’s Aladdin, about cryptocurrency, and now he’s determined to
get WyshCoin off the ground by selling the luxurious lifestyle
associated with the brand. The problem is he’s actually broke, so I need
to brew him teleportation potion after teleportation potion so he can

<p>Tuesday morning, Lionsgate announced that among a trio of new
projects in the John Wick universe, there will be an animated prequel
movie about the night the master assassin initially broke free from his
obligation to the High Table. Intended for “more mature audiences,” the
movie will be directed by Shannon Tindle (Ultraman: Rising) and […]</p>
