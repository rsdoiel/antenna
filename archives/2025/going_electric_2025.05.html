Ford’s <a href="https://electrek.co/guides/ford-f-150-lightning/">F-150
Lightning</a> is losing ground in the US with new electric pickups like
the Tesla Cybertruck and Chevy Silverado EV now available. Although Ford
plans to launch smaller, more affordable EVs, including an SUV and
pickup, they won’t arrive for (at least) another two years. With new
threats, including a wave of lower-cost EVs and Trump threatening to
impose tariffs on imports from Mexico, will Ford’s aging lineup set it
further behind?

There finally appears to be some Tesla shareholder momentum to fire Elon
Musk from the company after years of concerns being ignored by the board
and most shareholders.

However, probably nothing will happen as long as the stock (TSLA) is up.

in the United States</a>, featuring an all-new light bar design, a

as a “launch series” model, starting at $59,990 – with deliveries
beginning in March.

<p>
The new Model Y is currently in

seven different micromobility companies, each of which invited me to
tour their factory, test out their new products, or attend their major
events. The trip is something of a sequel to the
<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/07/15/i-went-to-china-to-witness-the-secrets-of-micromobility-factories-heres-whats-coming/">first

GM cut a shift at its Ramos Arizpe manufacturing plant in Mexico, where
it builds the Chevy Equinox EV and Honda Prologue. According to
<a href="https://electrek.co/guides/gm/">GM</a>, the move was due to
Honda’s decision to slow Prologue output. With sales of its sole
electric SUV in the US surging, why is Honda cutting back?

numbers coming for January 2025. Many are linking this to
dissatisfaction with CEO Elon Musk’s meddling in European politics.

While there’s undoubtedly some of that going on, it’s not the only
factor.

Best known for offering roadside assistance plans and TripTik travel
maps in the days before GPS, the American Automobile Association (AAA)
is still popular, claiming more than 60 million members in the US and
Canada – and now, those members will be able to get preferred pricing at
ChargePoint stations.

As we enter the second month of 2025,
<a href="https://electrek.co/guides/honda/">Honda</a> is inching closer
to commencing BEV production at its long-standing US plant in
Marysville, Ohio, later this year. That $1 billion transition will begin
with the assembly of the recently confirmed Acura RSX EV, followed by
the first two models in Honda’s 0 Series lineup. Before that happened,
however, Honda gave an exclusive tour of its new EV Hub in Ohio, which
included an innovative new approach to modular vehicle assembly, massive
mega press machines, and an insightful look into the positive impact
Honda has established amongst the residents of The Buckeye State. You
can view my whole tour expeirience in the video below.

much will the new Trump tariffs on China increase electric bike

With the flick of a Sharpie
marker,<a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-trade-china-mexico-canada-inflation-753a09d56cd318f2eb1d2efe3c43b7d4">
new tariffs</a> on goods imported from Canada, Mexico, and China were
imposed this morning and will take effect next week on February 4, 2025.
According to President Trump, the tariffs are intended “to protect
Americans”, though nearly all economists agree that they will result in
higher prices for consumer goods and increased inflation, devaluing the
US dollar.
</p>
<p>
The Trump Administration’s new 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and
Mexico are larger than the 10% additional tariffs on Chinese goods, but
the latter will have the biggest impact on the electric bicycle industry
in the US.
