## Volcano Watch: Determining magma storage depths at Kilauea

date: 2025-03-16, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>Consider a can of soda. When the can is closed (pressurized), the soda contains dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2). When you open the can, the pressure drops, bubbles form and rise. Molten rock (magma) beneath the Earth&#8217;s surface behaves similarly and we can learn from the gas trapped in tiny bubbles preserved in crystals from the rock after it&#8217;s erupted on the surface.</p>
