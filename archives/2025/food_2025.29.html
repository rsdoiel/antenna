<p>date: 2025-07-23, from: Taste of Home</p>
<p>This s’mores pie captures everything you love about the classic
campfire treat in one slice. It starts with a buttery graham cracker
crust filled with a silky chocolate custard made with hot cocoa mix for
that nostalgic milk chocolate flavor. Feel free to use a store-bought
graham cracker crust to save time! A little whipped cream is folded into
the custard to keep it light and mousse-like, and it’s all topped with a
billowy toasted marshmallow meringue. The result is gooey, creamy and
completely irresistible. —Hetal Vasavada, San Francisco, California</p>

THE IRISH USED TO COOK BEFORE OVENS – OPEN-FIRE, GRIDDLE, AND
PIT-COOKING TECHNIQUES</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-21, from: Irish Food Hub</p>
<p>
Long before modern appliances entered the Irish kitchen, cooking was a
matter of fire, stone, and ingenuity. We will now explore the ancient
cooking techniques that sustained generations — from the flicker of the
hearth to the smoky depths of pit ovens. Table of Contents The Hearth as
the Heart of the Home The Griddle (Báicín): Flatbreads and Bannocks
Earth Ovens and Pit Cooking Cauldrons, Spits, and Sospans Legacy of
Fire-Cooked Flavour in Irish Cuisine Today The Hearth as the Heart of
the Home In early Irish homes, the hearth was more than a place to cook
— it was the spiritual and social center of domestic life. Positioned in
the middle of the house or along a wall, the open hearth provided
warmth, light, and nourishment. Cooking was done directly over the
flames or in the hot embers, using tools and methods passed down for
generations. Hearth Design and Materials The typical hearth was a stone
or clay-lined pit, raised slightly to protect the floor. In many rural
cottages, turf (peat) was the fuel of choice — slow-burning, aromatic,
and abundantly available. Hardwood logs were used where available, but
in the boggy western regions, turf ruled. Cooking Methods Around the
Fire Suspended Pots: A pot crane (or crook) was often used to hang iron
pots over the fire. This method was ideal for boiling soups, stews, or
porridges. Hot Stone Cooking: Flat stones were placed in or near the
embers to cook oatcakes, fish, or meat directly on the surface — a
primitive but effective grill. Coal Baking: Dough wrapped in cabbage
leaves or encased in clay was placed under the coals, allowing for slow,
even baking. The Communal Nature of the Hearth Beyond sustenance, the
hearth symbolized protection and community. Families gathered around it
for warmth, storytelling, and prayer. It was considered sacred — in
pre-Christian times, associated with the goddess Brigid, and later with
Saint Brigid. The fire was never allowed to go out, as it was believed
to bring blessings and keep evil at bay. Foods Commonly Cooked at the
Hearth Daily meals reflected what was local and seasonal. Oat porridge,
nettle broth, cabbage, and boiled barley were staples. Occasionally,
fish or a joint of salted meat might be cooked when available. The diet
was humble, but the methods coaxed out deep, smoky, and comforting
flavors. Preserving the Tradition Today, heritage centers and folk
villages across Ireland demonstrate these time-honored techniques,
preserving the knowledge of a time when flame and patience were the only
kitchen tools available. The hearth may be gone from modern homes, but
its memory lives on in our stories — and our food. The Griddle (Báicín)
– Flatbreads and Bannocks Before metal ovens were common, the Irish
relied on a simple yet versatile cooking tool: the griddle, or báicín in
Irish. This flat, round iron plate was placed directly over the open
fire or rested on a tripod of stones. With no need for enclosed heat,
the griddle offered a quick and efficient way to bake flatbreads,
bannocks, and even early versions of soda bread. A Tool of Simplicity
and Ingenuity The traditional Irish griddle was made from cast iron or
thick wrought metal. It had no sides or lid — just a flat surface,
slightly convex to allow fat or liquid to run off. Cooks controlled the
heat by adjusting the griddle’s distance from the flame or by moving
coals beneath it. Some households had griddles with detachable legs or
handles, depending on the setup of the hearth. Flatbreads and Everyday
Baking Without yeast or ovens, early Irish breads were typically
unleavened or made with simple rising agents like sour milk and ash.
Oats and barley were the main grains used, later joined by wheat when it
became more available. Key griddle-baked breads included: Oatcakes:
Thin, rustic rounds made from oats and water or buttermilk. These were
quick to make and lasted well when dried. Bannocks: Thicker, round cakes
cut into farls (quarters) and cooked on the griddle. Often made with
barley or oatmeal and eaten warm with butter. Soda Farls: A later
development, made from flour, baking soda, salt, and buttermilk — a
precursor to modern soda bread. Techniques Passed Through Generations
Women typically managed the griddle, developing a feel for when the heat
was right and the dough was ready to flip. There was no timer or
thermometer — just intuition, tradition, and practice. The smell of
griddle bread browning on the fire was a familiar comfort in Irish
cottages. Serving and Storing Breads were eaten fresh when possible, but
could also be hung to dry for later use. A smear of homemade butter or a
spoon of jam transformed a simple oatcake into a satisfying meal. In
lean times, bread alone might have to serve as both breakfast and
supper. The Griddle’s Legacy Though replaced by the oven in most homes,
the griddle lives on in traditional Irish cookery. Some still use a cast
iron pan or modern griddle to make soda farls and potato breads. The
báicín remains a symbol of practical, nourishing food made with minimal
resources and plenty of heart. Earth Ovens and Pit Cooking – The Ancient
Art of Cooking Underground Long before metal cookware or masonry
hearths, the Irish — like many ancient cultures — harnessed the earth
itself as a cooking tool. Earth ovens, or pit ovens, were among the
earliest and most effective methods for preparing food. These
underground cooking pits, known in Irish as “poll cócaireachta,” made
use of heated stones and insulating materials to slow-cook meat, fish,
and root vegetables to tender perfection. How Pit Cooking Worked The
basic method was deceptively simple and required minimal tools: A pit
was dug into the earth, often lined with stones. A fire was built inside
the pit to heat the stones for several hours. Once the stones were
glowing hot, the embers were removed or spread out, and the food —
wrapped in leaves, grass, or cloth — was placed

of Irish blue cheese and the natural sweetness of apples, all wrapped in
buttery puff pastry. Perfect as a starter, elegant appetizer, or even a
savory-sweet brunch treat, they celebrate the best of Irish artisan
cheese in every bite. Preparation Time: 15 minutesCooking Time: 20
minutesServing Size: Makes 6 tartlets Ingredients 1 sheet of
ready-rolled puff pastry (thawed if frozen) 1 large eating apple (e.g.,
Braeburn or Pink Lady), thinly sliced 100g Cashel Blue cheese, crumbled
1 tsp fresh thyme leaves (or ½ tsp dried thyme) 1 tbsp honey (optional,
for drizzling) 1 egg, beaten (for egg wash) Instructions Preheat your

a few apple slices and top with crumbled Cashel Blue. Sprinkle with
thyme leaves and lightly brush the pastry edges with the beaten egg.
Bake for 18–20 minutes or until the pastry is puffed and golden and the
cheese is bubbling. If desired, drizzle lightly with honey before

(220°C). Lightly flour a baking sheet or line it with parchment paper.
In a large mixing bowl, combine the barley flour, all-purpose flour,
baking soda, and salt. Pour in the buttermilk and stir just until a
dough forms. If it’s too dry, add a little more buttermilk, one
tablespoon at a time. Turn the dough onto a floured surface and gently
shape it into a round loaf. Do not over-knead. Place the loaf on the
prepared baking sheet. Use a sharp knife to cut a deep cross into the
top—this helps the bread cook evenly. Bake for 35–40 minutes, or until
the bread is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.
Cool on a wire rack before slicing. Serve warm or at room temperature.
Tips If you don’t have buttermilk, mix 1 ¾ cups milk with 1 tbsp lemon
juice or vinegar and let sit for 5 minutes. Try adding a tablespoon of
honey or molasses for a hint of sweetness. Enjoy Your Homemade Barley
Soda Bread!
