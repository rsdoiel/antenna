Change to the Staked Chair</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-06, from: Lost Arg Press blog</p>
<p>Editor’s note: Our Mind Upon Mind series is a nod to a 1937 Chips
from the Chisel column (also featured in “Honest Labour: The Charles H.
Hayward Years”), in which Hayward wrote, “The influence of mind upon
mind is extraordinary.” The idea being there’s often room for
improvement. (You can read the entire Chips from…</p>

Moldings</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-05, from: Lost Arg Press blog</p>
<p>The following is excerpted from “Woodworker’s Pocket Book,” edited by
Charles Hayward.  The division of the periods from 1500 to 1800 into the
ages of the Carpenter, Cabinet Maker, and Designer is convenient because
these terms suggest the type of furniture being produced. In the
earliest period furniture was made by the carpenter, who regarded…</p>

<h2 id="michel-pellerin">102. Michel Pellerin</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-31, from: Luthier on Luthier with Michael Bashkin</p>
<p>
For episode 102 of the podcast, I talk with Michel Pellerin, an
inspiring guitar maker from Québec.
</p>
<p>
Michel shares his journey, from teaching guitarmaking at lutherie
schools to his time at the Godin factory, to developing and teaching his
own advanced finishing course.
</p>
<p>
We also dive into his current line of guitars — from parlor to harp —
and how he continues to evolve his work through collaboration with
musicians and colleagues.
</p>
<p>
Michel explains his method of building two nearly identical instruments,
changing just one feature between them to push the boundaries of design
and sound.
</p>
<p>
Stick around after the main episode for a bonus segment: I catch up with
Mario Beauregard at the Sound Messe Guitar Show in Osaka for a quick
conversation on what’s new.
