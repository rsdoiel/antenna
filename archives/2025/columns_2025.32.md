End of the Valley Langdale on a beautiful day. Quote of the Day &#8220;For Trump, everything is a shakedown, the way it was for Vito Genovese, who is Trump&#8217;s model of governance.

## It hasn't hit us yet

date: 2025-08-10, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Theory about why we don‚Äôt fight to save the US.</p>
<p>Many of us haven‚Äôt personally felt much impact.</p>
<p>No hyperinflation yet.</p>
<p>The police still respond as they always have, wearing badges, faces uncovered.</p>
<p>The shelves are full at the supermarket.</p>
<p>The electricity is on, as is the internet. Buses and subways are running. The airports are open. </p>
<p>The Obamas and Clintons are still free, living in the US.</p>
<p>We read the news about universities and news orgs giving in. Corruption at the FBI and in Congress and the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>No major hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, tornados so cuts at FEMA not felt yet.</p>
<p>And we‚Äôve been living in a normal way for hundreds of years. We‚Äôve had no time to get used to the new normal. It doesn‚Äôt feel like anything yet.</p>
<p>I fear by the time we feel it it will be far too late, by design.</p>

One more bingeable, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Lights_(2023_TV_series)">Blue Lights</a> from BBC on HBO Max. I love police dramas, esp British ones. I watched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaky_Blinders_(TV_series)">Peaky Blinders</a> earlier this year and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fall_(TV_series)">The Fall</a>, another British crime drama, and, amazingly they all take place in Belfast, believe it or not, and don't count the number of times people say "wee" in the darndest places in BBC Belfast crime dramas. Do Brits really say <i>wee</i> all the time? How did I not see that coming.

Luckily it was one of the most perfect days to spend outside. In the meantime, I highly recommend the <a href="https://feedland.org/?feedurl=https%3A%2F%2Ffeeds.megaphone.fm%2Ffloodlines">Floodlines serial podcast</a> from the Atlantic. It's bingeable in an afternoon, tells an interesting story of Katrina and New Orleans. The interview with <a href="https://www.c-span.org/clip/white-house-event/katrina-10-years-later-brownie-youre-doing-a-heck-of-a-job/4548480">Brownie</a> is <i>cringe</i>-worthy not binge-worthy, I skipped over it.

## 2025-08-07 OddŒº hashtags

date: 2025-08-10, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-08-07-oddŒº-hashtags">2025-08-07 OddŒº hashtags</h1>

<p>I was recently looking at my homepage and wondered about all the hashtags I used and how not all of them had a topic page. The <a href="Odd%CE%BC">OddŒº</a> page, for example, collects all the blogposts tagged <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23OddŒº">#OddŒº</a> (including this one). So I looked at the <a href="oddmu/oddmu-hashtags.1">hashtags</a> command and figured, &ldquo;this is going to be easy.&rdquo; ü§£</p>

<p>The first problem is that there are a lot of garbage hashtags. There are over 1000 hashtags used on this site! The garbage hashtags are the result of Markdown parsing mistakes that I never fixed. Apparently the list of hashtags includes the following:</p>

<pre><code>#1)
#fennel‚Äù
#fudge](fudge)_and_the_[pdq](../wiki?action=edit;id=pdq_&quot;click_to_edit_this_page&quot;)_rules_used_in_[zorcererofzo.
ffffff;fill-opacity:1&quot;)
###ÔΩ£
</code></pre>

<p>This is not great. üòî</p>

<p>I should fix those, and many more. ü§®</p>

<p>Furthermore, the hashtags are all downcased. So given a hashtag such as <code>#advanced_squad_leader</code> the code would have to infer the page name &ldquo;Advanced Squad Leader&rdquo;. But what about the hashtag <code>#√§lter werden</code>? If at all, that should link to a page called &ldquo;√Ñlter werden&rdquo;.</p>

<p>And so I concluded that this wasn&rsquo;t easy after all. I saved the changes I made on a branch, and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll be merging that into the main branch.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Wikis">#Wikis</a></p>

<p><strong>2025-08-09</strong>. Well! I think I worked on it and I worked on it, and then I ran it, and kept on fixing the topic pages it created. But I think it worked!</p>

<p><strong>2025-08-10</strong>. Yesterday I cleaned up my site (somewhat) and today I released v1.18 of OddŒº. Yay me!</p>
