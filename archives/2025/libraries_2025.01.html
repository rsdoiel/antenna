<h2 id="metadata-matching-beyond-correctness-1">Metadata matching:
beyond correctness</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-08, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
<img src="https://www.crossref.org/img/crossref-logo-icon-only.svg" alt="Crossref logo icon" height="15" style="display: inline;" />
<a href="https://doi.org/10.13003/axeer1ee" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.13003/axeer1ee</a>
</p>
<p>
In our
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/how-good-is-your-matching">previous
entry</a>, we explained that thorough evaluation is key to understanding
a matching strategy’s performance. While evaluation is what allows us to
assess the correctness of matching, choosing the best matching strategy
is, unfortunately, not as simple as selecting the one that yields the
best matches. Instead, these decisions usually depend on weighing
multiple factors based on your particular circumstances. This is true
not only for metadata matching, but for
<a href="https://www.wired.com/2012/04/netflix-prize-costs/" target="_blank">many
technical choices</a> that require navigating trade-offs. In this blog
post, the last one in the metadata matching series, we outline a
subjective set of criteria we would recommend you consider when making
decisions about matching.
</p>
<h2 id="openness">
Openness
</h2>
<p>
Matching tools come in many different shapes and sizes: web
applications, APIs, command-line tools, sometimes even
<a href="https://adambuttrick.github.io/mysterious-crystal-ball-matching/" target="_blank">enchanted
crystal balls showing matched identifiers emerging from a mysterious
mist</a>! No matter what form they take, an important consideration is
whether the source code and all the related resources for the matching
are openly available.
</p>
<p>
Matching strategies that are either closed-source, or rely on
closed-source services for their matching logic, make it difficult to
fully understand and explain matching processes. This lack of
transparency also makes it impossible to adjust or improve the matching
logic, since we cannot understand or improve code we cannot see.
</p>
<p>
Users are similarly impeded from identifying flaws or suggesting
improvements to processes they are unable to examine. By blocking this
community participation, we also lose the proven cycle of real-world
testing, refinement, and validation that has strengthened myriad of open
source projects. The cumulative impact of both minor and major
community-driven refinements over time is incredibly valuable and should
not be underestimated.
</p>
<p>
Using open source matching will also help build trust in the matching
workflows and results. This is one reason why open source is one of the
tenets of the
<a href="https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org" target="_blank">Principles
of Open Scholarly Infrastructure</a>, adopted by Crossref, DataCite,
ROR, and other organizations who build and maintain open scholarly
infrastructure.
</p>
<p>
When evaluating matching strategies, we strongly recommend prioritizing
those that are fully open source. This not only ensures their
transparency and trustworthiness, but also allows for the kind of
continuous improvement that results from this visibility and community
engagement.
</p>
<h2 id="explainability">
Explainability
</h2>
<p>
In terms of our ability to understand and improve a matching strategy,
using an open source model is only the first step. What typically
matters most in the context of building and maintaining matching
services is that we are able to understand their underlying code and
have a clear model of how matches are derived from their corresponding
inputs. Even if the matching code itself and all of the resources used
in the matching are open, if they are poorly documented, lack
reproducibility or tests, or are otherwise opaque, there is no guarantee
that it will be possible to understand or improve the strategy. Striving
for a high level of interpretability in our matching plays a
determinative role in how well we can understand and modify our
strategies in the future.
</p>
<p>
Being able to explain the behaviour of the matching will also help you
to respond to and incorporate user feedback. When users encounter
errors, you will be able to do things like advise them on how to modify
or clean their inputs so that the results are better. Conversely,
examining the behaviour of the strategy relative to user inputs and
feedback can provide you with ideas for improving the matching.
</p>
<p>
Typically, heuristic-based strategies, such as those that use forms of
search or string similarity measures, like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit_distance" target="_blank">edit
distance</a>, are easier to explain than, say, machine learning models.
If a strategy uses machine learning, at least some internal decisions
might be made by passing data through a complex network of algebraic
equations. Those can be mysterious, non-deterministic, and are famous
for being <a href="https://xkcd.com/1838/" target="_blank">hard to
interpret</a>. This doesn’t mean they should be avoided entirely - we
have built and use many machine-learning based tools ourselves! Instead,
it is a good idea to weigh how their inherent lack of explainability
could affect your ability to continue work on the strategy and respond
to user needs, relative to all the available options.
</p>
<h2 id="complexity">
Complexity
</h2>
<p>
Complexity is another aspect that can greatly affect how easy it is to
maintain the strategy. Complexity is related to how many different
components the strategy has and how difficult they are to use and
maintain. When a strategy has multiple interconnected parts, each
component becomes a potential failure point that requires discrete
assessment and maintenance.
</p>
<p>
Consider, for example, two different approaches to a matching strategy:
one that uses a single machine learning model versus another that uses
an ensemble of models. A single model requires maintaining one set of
training data, a single training pipeline, and one deployment process.
If the model’s performance unexpectedly deteriorates, whether because of
an issue with the training data, a configuration error, or the need for
additional input sanitization, the source of the problem is easier to
isolate and fix.
</p>
<p>
The ensemble, by contrast, combines multiple, specialized models, each
requiring its own training data, tests, updates, and deployments. If one
model in the ensemble is found to reduce the performance of the
strategy, the interdependence between models can cause this degradation
to cascade through the entire system and undermine its overall
reliability. Correcting for these errors becomes more challenging. If
fixing one model’s performance requires retraining or adjusting its
outputs, this could require recalibrating the entire ensemble to
maintain the balance between models, identify regressions, and prevent
new errors from emerging.
</p>
<p>
In general, preferring simpler strategies not only reduces operational
overhead, but also makes it easier to diagnose issues, test changes, and
iterate on user feedback. When problems arise, having fewer moving parts
means less places to look for the root cause and fewer components that
could be affected by any fixes.
</p>
<h2 id="flexibility">
Flexibility
</h2>
<p>
The metadata to which we match grows and changes over time. New records
are created, existing ones are updated, with schemas changing and
evolving alongside. The resources that underlie our matching are also
not static. The libraries we depend on may deprecate features between
versions or the taxonomies we used to categorize results might undergo
significant revisions. We thus rarely have the luxury of deploying a
matching strategy once and using it forever without any changes. A good
strategy has to be flexible enough to adapt to such changes, with this
adaptation also being both technically feasible and practical to
implement.
</p>
<p>
Much of this flexibility is also determined by a matching strategy’s
ability to incorporate new data. Strategies that use continuously
updated databases or indices can immediately match against new metadata
as it appears in the system. By contrast, some machine learning-based
approaches require training on target matches and can thus be limited in
flexibility and face more constraints. While some models can be
incrementally updated to recognize new matches, others require
retraining from scratch to incorporate these changes - a process that
can be both time-consuming and resource-intensive.
</p>
<p>
Paying close attention to a strategy’s flexibility and favoring this
aspect, when possible, can significantly impact its long-term viability.
When comparing different matching strategies, flexibility should thus be
a primary concern in your decision-making process.
</p>
<h2 id="resources">
Resources
</h2>
<p>
Matching strategies can vary significantly in their resource
requirements, including things like CPU and GPU utilization, memory
consumption, storage capacity, and network bandwidth. These requirements
are directly related to infrastructure costs and energy consumption, so
when evaluating a matching strategy, it is necessary to assess its
resource demands across all phases of the matching lifecycle. This
includes things like initial model training, re-training, index
construction, updates and management for all aspects of the strategy, as
well as the real-world processing of matching requests. It is a good
idea to measure and monitor resource usage carefully in considering
which strategies to use, as the best performing strategy may also be too
resource intensive to run as a service or might grow to this state over
time with additional utilization.
</p>
<h2 id="speed">
Speed
</h2>
<p>
Matching strategies can operate at a wide range of speeds, from
milliseconds to minutes per match. Since the overall response time of a
strategy can affect both system scalability and user experience, we
should always assess the strategy’s performance for different usage
scenarios and scales of data. While some strategies might perform
adequately with small datasets, they can also exhibit exponential
slowdowns as data volume and complexity increases or as concurrent
requests grow in number. We should therefore consider carefully how
requirements for matching speed might evolve with increased usage, data
complexity, and total anticipated growth. The fastest matching strategy
might not always be the best choice if it comes at the cost of reduced
accuracy or requires large amounts of resources, but unacceptable
latency can make an otherwise excellent strategy unusable in practice
for many use cases.
</p>
<h2 id="putting-it-all-together">
Putting it all together
</h2>
<p>
The typical life cycle of developing a metadata matching strategy is as
follows:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Scoping</strong>: we define the matching task, along with its
inputs and outputs.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Research</strong>: we research what existing strategies are
available for our task and/or we develop our own.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Evaluation</strong>: we evaluate all available strategies,
internally or externally-developed, exploring all of the aspects
described above.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Decision</strong>: we choose which strategy (if any) we want to
use in our production system.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Production setup</strong>: we prepare the production models,
indexes, and other resources needed for the matching.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Maintenance</strong>: we monitor and adapt the strategy relative
to changing data, user feedback, and new resource requirements.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
In practice, these phases do not happen all at once, nor in this strict
order. Often we need to proceed through multiple iterations of them to
arrive at the best strategy. For example, if initial evaluation of a
strategy yields poor results, we might return to the research phase to
investigate other strategies or refine our understanding of the task.
Often, during the maintenance phase, we receive feedback from users that
indicates potential areas of improvement and then pursue them with a new
round of research and evaluation.
</p>
<p>
As we cycle through these phases, ideally all the aspects described in
this entry, along with the results of the evaluation, would be taken
into account. Of course, this means that these decisions have to be
based on multiple criteria and by making trade-offs between their
performance and all other considerations. In making these complex and
difficult choices, it is useful to consider two primary questions:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Are any of the considered matching strategies good enough for our use
case?
</li>
<li>
Out of all the considered strategies that are sufficient for our use
case, which would be the best?
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The first question requires us to create clear and quantifiable criteria
that allow for eliminating some of the potential strategies. As we have
indicated, these could include things like the strategy being open
source, minimum performance baselines using measures like precision or
recall, and operational thresholds, like the strategy being able to
return results quickly, relative to user expectations or the volume of
data to be processed. It should be fairly easy to test these
requirements and eliminate any strategies that fall short of them. If
the strategies are difficult to assess, that is likely a mark against
them.
</p>
<p>
If no strategies meet these criteria, we have two options: either to
abandon matching entirely or to reassess and relax our criteria to align
with the available options. While the former is always an option,
adopting a more pragmatic lens, framing in terms of potential value (or
harm) to the users, might be beneficial. Sometimes we approach matching
tasks with too high expectations and a dose of realism helps us to
re-center our perspectives. After more consideration, you might decide
that your criteria were too stringent or realize that you need to better
define and decompose the tasks to fit the available options.
</p>
<p>
When multiple strategies appear viable, the selection process becomes
more nuanced. When evaluating strategies across these various
dimensions, we should try to avoid placing undue weight on minor
performance differences. Evaluation metrics are useful estimates of
performance, but do not always translate to real-world applications and
changing data. In cases where a more complex strategy offers only
marginal improvements over a simpler alternative, the maintenance and
operational benefits of the simpler solution often outweigh small
performance gains.
</p>
<p>
This concludes our series on metadata matching, where we described the
conceptual, product, and technical aspects of matching and its
applications. We hope this overview was instructive and helps you to
make better decisions about the use of matching in your own tools and
services!
