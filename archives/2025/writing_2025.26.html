When it comes to being a screenwriter, the creative process is a very
personal thing; almost as personal as our voice. That voice is what
distinguishes our script from the next, and when it comes to completing
a script – no matter how inspired we are – getting all those words on
the page can sometimes feel like an insurmountable
task. <br><br>Therefore, it’s up to our Creative Process, capital C,
capital P, to get the job done! The story wants to come out: we’ve taken
up the screenwriter mantle for a reason. Our Creative Process is the
thing that will get us to that outcome, so we must invest in cultivating
a solid one.<br><br>So when motivation is flagging, the muse has taken
up residence elsewhere, the world is feeling heavy, and yet, that tiny
little spark of <em>I must write to keep breathing</em> won’t let go of
you—what’s a creative writer to do? <br><br>One way to keep
screenwriting while the world feels like it’s on fire is to set your
intentions—and then follow through with them.

John and Craig plant the idea for setups that have the most satisfying
payoffs. Different from exposition, setups introduce ideas and concepts
to an audience, priming them for a later revelation. They look at the
sleight of hand required to have your setups deftly planted, take root
in your audience’s mind, and grow into something […]

On Scriptnotes, we often explore craft topics, looking at the specific
choices writers make on the page. But there’s an obvious challenge when
discussing visual storytelling in an audio medium. That’s why for the

Christina Hodson on writing action sequences. In this new format, […]

“One thing I’ve found in the crime genre is that homicides are always
interesting. When somebody’s killed, whatever that case may be, it’s
usually compelling drama. So then it’s up to you as the writer to
surprise the audience and do things that they didn’t think were coming.
I’ve described it like this before: If you can hit the sweet spot of, ‘I
didn’t see that coming! I should have seen it coming, but I didn’t see
it coming,’ That, to me, is the best writing. It’s like, when you got to
the end of <em>The Sixth Sense</em>, and you were like, ‘Oh my god, I
should have seen that coming!’ That was great writing,” says Derek Haas,
creator and writer for the show <em>Countdown</em> on Prime. <br><br>You
may know Derek Haas from the popular NBC procedural dramas like
<em>Chicago Med, Chicago Fire</em> and <em>Chicago PD</em>. Now, he’s
got a new crime drama on Prime called <em>Countdown</em> that tells one
twisty crime story over 13 episodes – all written by Haas. Set in Los
Angeles, <em>Countdown</em> follows a secret task force who discover a
sinister international plot that threatens millions of lives. The show
stars Eric Dane, Jensen Ackles and Jessica Camacho as undercover agents
all harboring dark secrets of their own. <br><br>On this episode of the
podcast, we chat with Haas about starting his career as a crime
novelist, writing movies like<em> 2 Fast 2 Furious, 3:10 to Yuma</em>
and <em>Wanted</em> before making the switch to TV. Haas talks about
working with director John Singleton, prolific TV producer Dick Wolf and
writing characters that hook audiences. He also shares his advice for
writing action sequences that both stun visually and surprise the
audience. <br><br>“When I think about action sequences, I always go back
to <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em>. My favorite action sequence of any
movie ever is when Indiana Jones has to fight this gigantic Nazi guy,
and – in any other movie – that would have been the only thing that’s
happening. But they put Marion in a plane where she gets trapped because
the cover of the plane closes. Then the plane’s propellers start
spinning. The plane starts spinning, gas is leaking out of the plane,
there’s other people running by with machine guns. So it’s not just,
‘Oh, here’s a fight,’ it’s ‘Here’s a fight, but there’s eight other
things happening at once.’ I really try to do that in these chase
sequences, because you have seen a million of them. What’s the other
factors I can bring to it? How can I show you something you haven’t seen
before? Sometimes it’s character, and sometimes, it’s the stunt itself,”
says Haas. <br><br>To hear more screenwriting advice from Haas, listen
to the podcast.

Author-Library Alliance: Supporting Fair eBook Legislation Together</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-30, from: Author’s Union blog</p>
<p>In May 2025, Connecticut’s legislature passed landmark legislation to
address restrictive ebook licensing practices that limit libraries’
ability to serve the public. It aims to ensure ebook licenses align more
closely with  libraries’ core public interest mission of lending,
access, and preservation. This represents a pivotal step toward
safeguarding the role of libraries in the digital age. As more states
consider similar measures, a key question arises: Should authors support
these efforts? The answer is unequivocally yes— and here’s why.</p>
