<p>date: 2025-08-05, from: John August blog</p>
<p>
John and Craig descend into development hell to look at films that
almost but never quite existed. Using both widely-publicized and
little-known examples, they examine common patterns that keep movies
frozen in script form. We also follow up on solar storms, writer
education and genres people should see at least one of. We then answer

Before he was the Emmy-winning showrunner behind <em>Slow Horses</em>,
the darkly funny and emotionally rich Apple TV+ spy drama, Will Smith
tested punchlines on the stand-up comedy circuit in the UK, even opening
for Ricky Gervais’s sold-out tour in 2007.

Writer’s block isn’t real. It’s not something that should be feared by
writers, whether you’re writing novels or screenplays. It is nothing
more than an over-generalized term for the multiple hurdles <span
style="font-weight: bold;">all</span> writers must face, overcome, and
adapt to in their writing process. <br><br>It’s true. Any writer that
has felt that lingering weight on their shoulders perceived as the
mystical condition <em>writer’s block</em> should take solace knowing
that they don’t have to be a victim to it any longer. <br><br>To truly
conquer a problem, it’s best to explore and understand every dynamic and
angle of it. For writers battling with supposed writer’s block, and for
those who want to avoid it, you must first be able to identify what it
really is, what triggers it, and how you can put a stop to it before it
takes hold. <br><br>With that in mind, here we present seven ways to
identify and prevent what most people initially attribute to being the
dreaded <span style="font-weight: bold;">writer’s block</span>.
