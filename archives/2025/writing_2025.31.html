When you type <em>FADE OUT, FADE TO BLACK,</em> or <em>THE END</em> on
your first draft of a script, by all means, celebrate. That’s a huge
accomplishment. You’ve just done what most beginning screenwriters never
do: you finished a script. <br><br>But the writing isn’t done yet. You
shouldn’t be sharing that first draft with anyone. You certainly
shouldn’t be submitting it anywhere. You’ve made an amazing leap forward
in your screenwriting. But now it’s time for the real work, where the
real script starts to shine. This happens in the <span
style="font-weight: bold;">rewrite</span>.

Screenwriting is a visual medium. We know that. We’re taught that. We
preach that. But how often do most screenwriters take a step back and
ask themselves, <em>“Am I actually writing visually?”</em> <br><br>To
make an immediate impact on whoever is reading and considering your
work, your screenplays need to make the script reader feel as if they
are watching a movie unfold as they read. This is one of the most
underrated aspects of screenwriting — writing a visually cinematic
script where these three elements pop off of the page:

A <span style="font-weight: bold;">spec screenplay</span> (a.k.a. a
<a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/what-is-a-spec-script">spec
script</a>) is an original screenplay that a
<a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/how-to-be-a-screenwriter-in-5-basic-steps">screenwriter</a>
conceives and writes themselves (or with a writing partner) with a view
to selling it. With the help of a
<a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/the-differences-between-an-agent-and-a-manager">manager
or agent</a>, the spec script is given to several production companies
or directly to a studio. In an ideal scenario, the script is
well-received and an interested party
<a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/screenplay-options-vs.-screenplay-sales">purchases
it</a>. In an even more ideal scenario, several parties want to purchase
it, leading to a bidding war and <span style="font-weight: bold;">big
spec sale</span>.<br><br>The heyday of the Big Spec Sale is undoubtedly
the 90s in which news of such sales were common in the industry trades
and often created much buzz. This trend continued into the 00s, in which
some of the biggest spec sales ever occurred. Not only did news of these
sales help boost the profile of the writers, they created excitement
about the project and acted as early promotion for the film. These sales
also acted as inspiration for aspiring and beginner screenwriters. Maybe
one day <span style="font-style: italic;">they’d</span> write a script
that sold for a lot of money…<br><br>But how much exactly?<br><br>I,
myself, broke into the industry with a
<a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/5-things-i-did-to-become-a-professional-screenwriter">big
spec sale</a>, so this is something I’ve experienced firsthand. I’ve
also done my research over the years and have a pretty good grasp on the
spec script market. Below is my breakdown of how much spec screenplays
have sold for in the past, as well as what they can sell for today.

Some film genres never go out of style. Thrillers and action/adventure
movies, for example, remain perennial favorites, consistently drawing
audiences in theaters and on streaming platforms. Other genres, however,
tend to fade in and out of popularity.

Before he was the Emmy-winning showrunner behind <em>Slow Horses</em>,
the darkly funny and emotionally rich Apple TV+ spy drama, Will Smith
tested punchlines on the stand-up comedy circuit in the UK, even opening
for Ricky Gervais’s sold-out tour in 2007.

Writer’s block isn’t real. It’s not something that should be feared by
writers, whether you’re writing novels or screenplays. It is nothing
more than an over-generalized term for the multiple hurdles <span
style="font-weight: bold;">all</span> writers must face, overcome, and
adapt to in their writing process. <br><br>It’s true. Any writer that
has felt that lingering weight on their shoulders perceived as the
mystical condition <em>writer’s block</em> should take solace knowing
that they don’t have to be a victim to it any longer. <br><br>To truly
conquer a problem, it’s best to explore and understand every dynamic and
angle of it. For writers battling with supposed writer’s block, and for
those who want to avoid it, you must first be able to identify what it
really is, what triggers it, and how you can put a stop to it before it
takes hold. <br><br>With that in mind, here we present seven ways to
identify and prevent what most people initially attribute to being the
dreaded <span style="font-weight: bold;">writer’s block</span>.
