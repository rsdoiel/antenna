extracellular vesicles: emerging mediators of gut-liver axis crosstalk
in hepatic diseases</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-20, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Bacterial Extracellular Vesicles (BEVs) are key mediators of
cross-talk between gut microorganisms and host organs, playing an
especially important role in the gut-liver axis. In this paper, we
systematically review the mechanisms of BEV production, their
classification, and their regulatory networks in liver diseases. BEVs
carry pathogenic factors such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and bacterial
DNA, which can enter the circulatory system by disrupting the intestinal
barrier and target the liver to induce metabolic abnormalities,
including insulin resistance. Furthermore, through activation of
signaling pathways such as LPS/TLR4, cGAS/STING, and TGF-β, BEVs promote
the progression of metabolism-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD),
liver fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. In addition, BEVs show
dual potential in the diagnosis and treatment of liver diseases: on one
hand, they can be used as non-invasive biomarkers to enhance diagnostic
specificity through multi-omics analysis; on the other hand, engineered
and modified BEVs, as well as probiotic BEVs (e.g., from Lactobacillus
and Bifidobacterium species), can regulate lipid metabolism, reduce
inflammation, and even enhance immunotherapy by targeting the tumor
microenvironment. However, the heterogeneity of BEVs, efficient
isolation techniques, storage stability, and clinical translation remain
major challenges in current research. In the future, combining
multi-omics techniques to resolve the molecular fingerprints of BEVs,
optimizing isolation methods, and exploring their potential as precision
medicine tools will be necessary to advance the study of the gut-liver
axis toward clinical applications.</p>

of a novel aspergillus IgG lateral flow assay for the diagnosis of
non-neutropenic patients with acute and subacute invasive
aspergillosis</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-20, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>PurposeThis study aimed to assess a novel lateral flow assay (LFA)
for Aspergillus IgG detection in patients with non-neutropenic invasive
aspergillosis (IA).MethodsAspergillus IgG LFA and enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were performed in non-neutropenic IA
patients and control group (proven community acquired pneumonia and
healthy persons), respectively. The diagnostic performance of
Aspergillus IgG LFA for IA was evaluated and compared with ELISA
method.Results33 cases of acute IA, 30 cases of subacute IA and 80
controls were enrolled in this study. The level of plasma Aspergillus
IgG LFA in the IA group was significantly higher than that in the
control group (190.5 AU/mL vs. 50.3 AU/mL, P &lt; 0.001). In total, the
sensitivity/specificity/PPV/NPV of Aspergillus IgG LFA was
65.1%/97.5%/95.4%/78.0%. The sensitivity and specificity of Aspergillus
IgG LFA were equivalent to those of Aspergillus IgG ELISA with a 120
AU/mL cut-off, but exhibited significantly higher specificity (97.5% vs
87.5%, P = 0.021) compared to the ELISA with an 80 AU/mL cut-off. The
consistency was strong among the two methods (P &lt; 0.001, Kappa =
0.67/0.68). The sensitivities/specificities/PPVs/NPVs of Aspergillus IgG
LFA were 57.6%/97.5%/90.5%/84.8% for patients with acute IA, and
73.3%/97.5%/91.7%/90.7% for patients with subacute IA, respectively. The
“any-positive” strategy, which combined Aspergillus IgG LFA with sputum
culture and serum galactomannan (GM), had a
sensitivity/specificity/PPV/NPV of 81.1%/94.7%/95.6%/78.3%. The
sensitivity/specificity/PPV/NPV of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF)
GM was 65.0%/90.0%/92.9%/56.3%. When combined Aspergillus IgG LFA with
BALF GM, the figures were 87.5%/85.0%/92.1%/77.3%.ConclusionsCompared to
the Aspergillus IgG ELISA, the Aspergillus IgG LFA exhibits comparable
or superior diagnostic efficiency in IA patients, while offering a
faster and more convenient option for clinical diagnosis. The
“any-positive” strategy of combined diagnosis with Aspergillus IgG LFA
serves as a valuable supplement to current diagnostic approaches,
particularly benefiting patients who cannot tolerate invasive
bronchoscopic procedures.</p>

of functional cure in interferon-treated chronic hepatitis B: a
retrospective cohort analysis of HBsAg dynamics and clinical
predictors</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-20, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Background and ObjectivesFunctional cure of chronic hepatitis B (CHB)
is the optimal goal of antiviral therapy. This study evaluates the
functional cure rates in a large cohort treated with interferon (IFNα)
and explores baseline predictors to optimize personalized treatment
strategies.MethodsThis retrospective study included CHB patients treated
with IFN monotherapy or IFN combined with nucleos(t)ide analogs at
Beijing You’an Hospital from 2008 to 2023. Patients were categorized
into functional cure (FC) and non-functional cure (NFC) groups based on
treatment outcomes.ResultsAmong 5288 patients, 887 (16.8%) achieved
functional cure. FC patients had significantly lower baseline HBsAg, HBV
DNA, and HBeAg positivity compared to NFC patients. Kaplan-Meier
analysis revealed cumulative functional cure rates of 10.6%, 25.7%, and
39.9% at 48, 96, and 144 weeks, respectively. Multivariate logistic
regression analysis identified lower baseline HBsAg levels, female,
HBeAg negativity, lower γ-GT levels, and higher FT3 and FT4 levels as
factors associated with higher functional cure rates. Patients with
HBsAg &lt;100 IU/ml had a cure rate of 58.8% within 96 weeks, compared
to 11.1% for those with &gt;1500 IU/ml.ConclusionEarly HBsAg decline is
critical for functional cure. Female patients, HBeAg-negative status,
and baseline HBsAg &lt;100 IU/mL predict higher success rates.</p>

droplet digital PCR for the detection and quantitation of Streptococcus
pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-20, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundLower respiratory tract infection is one of the major
causes of disease and death worldwide. Streptococcus pneumoniae,
Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae are important
pathogens responsible for lower respiratory tract infection. Here, we
established a multiplex droplet digital polymerase chain reaction
(ddPCR) method for the simultaneous detection of S. pneumoniae, M.
pneumoniae and H. influenzae DNA.MethodsSpecific primers and probes were
designed for ddPCR. The sensitivity and specificity of the ddPCR assay
were evaluated using standard strains, positive samples and 26 common
pathogenic bacteria. One hundred and sixty-seven clinical samples were
collected and tested via ddPCR, qPCR, bacterial culture and microfluidic
chip technology.ResultsThe limits of detection (LoDs) of ddPCR were 2.5,
2.8 and 2.0 copies/μL for S. pneumoniae, M. pneumoniae and H.
influenzae, respectively, which were approximately tenfold lower than
the LoDs of qPCR. For 167 clinical samples, the positivity rates of
ddPCR and microfluidic chip for S. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae were
27.5% and 22.8%, respectively, which were higher than those of qPCR
25.7% and 21.6%. The positive rate of H. influenzae detection via ddPCR
and microfluidic chip method was 29.9%, which was higher than that of
qPCR (28.7%). The clinical sensitivity for S. pneumoniae, M. pneumoniae
and H. influenzae improved from 97.4%, 94.7% and 95.1% for qPCR to 100%
for ddPCR. Moreover, ddPCR showed less inhibition by the inhibitor in
respiratory specimens than qPCR.ConclusionThe multiplex ddPCR assay
established in this study can accurately detect S. pneumoniae, M.
pneumoniae and H. influenzae DNA and can be used as an auxiliary tool
for the clinical identification of pathogens and guidance of antibiotic
therapy.</p>

in the interrelated nature of vaginal microecology, HPV infection, and
cervical lesions</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-19, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Vaginal microecology serves as a crucial defense mechanism in women’s
reproductive health. It encompasses vaginal anatomy, microbial flora,
endocrine regulation, and immune responses. Lactobacillus species
dominate this ecosystem, maintaining a dynamic balance essential for
vaginal health. Studies have highlighted a strong association between
vaginal microecology, human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, and cervical
lesions. A well-balanced vaginal microenvironment enhances mucosal
barriers and immune function, aiding in HPV prevention and clearance.
Conversely, disruptions in vaginal microecology compromise these
defenses, increasing susceptibility to HPV infection. Persistent
high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) infections are key contributors to cervical
lesions and may further destabilize the vaginal microbiota(VMB).
Additionally, cervical lesion progression is influenced by local immune
responses, with HPV infection potentially accelerating disease
development by suppressing cervical immunity. This review explores the
intricate association between vaginal microecology, HPV infection, and
cervical lesions, offering insights into early diagnosis, prevention,
and treatment strategies.</p>

updated duplex fluorescence quantitative RT-PCR assay for simultaneous
detection of PRRSV-1 and PRRSV-2</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-19, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is
one of the most economically devastating infectious diseases in the
global swine industry. With the continuous mutation and recombination of
PRRSV, existing detection methods frequently result in false negatives,
further complicating the prevention and control of PRRS.MethodsThe
duplex real-time quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) for the simultaneous
detection of PRRSV-1 and PRRSV-2 was developed by designing specific
primers and probes based on the ORF6 gene, which is different from
conventional nucleic acid detection methods that are typically based on
the ORF7 gene.ResultsThe method showed high specificity for exclusively
detecting PRRSV-1 and PRRSV-2, with no cross-reactivity observed against
other porcine pathogens. The limit of detection (LOD) was 8.42 copies
for PRRSV-1 and 7.84 copies for PRRSV-2. Intra-assay coefficients of
variation (CVs) were 0.22–1.07% and inter-assay CVs were 0.52–1.28%. A
total of 356 clinical samples were detected using the developed duplex
RT-qPCR and compared to the WOAH-recommended RT-qPCR assay and
commercial universal PRRSV RT-qPCR detection kit. The assay established
in this study demonstrated higher positivity rates, indicating its
superior sensitivity.DiscussionAn efficient, sensitive, and accurate
method for the detection and differentiation of PRRSV-1 and PRRSV-2 was
developed and applied to the detection and monitoring of PRRSV.</p>

Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThe gastrointestinal (GI) tract acts as an essential
interface between the host and the microbiota, with microbial
metabolites exerting a significant role in regulating host
physiology.MethodsIntegrative network-based methodology that combines
metabolite-protein interactions with tissue-specific transcriptomics to
uncover host targets of probiotic-derived metabolites and determine
their potential biological significance. Utilizing curated interaction
data, it is about to construct metabolite-host protein network and
prioritised genes using centrality metrics. Gene expression analysis
across human tissues indicated that some high-degree genes, including
SLC27A4, LCN12, and APOD, are abundant in GI areas including small
intestine, colon, and duodenum, indicating a potential role in local
host-microbe interactions. Further metabolite-specific expression
analysis revealed separate but overlapping expression landscapes.
10-hydroxy-cis-12-octadecenoic acid has been associated to increased
production of sialyltransferases and neuraminidase in metabolically and
immunologically active tissues.Results and discussionGlycodeoxycholic
acid was associated with high levels of lipocalins and fatty acid
transporters in enterohepatic tissues, indicating functions in bile acid
metabolism and lipid transport. Meanwhile,
N-(1-carbamoyl-2-phenyl-ethyl) butyramide was linked to detoxifying
enzymes that are highly expressed in the liver, kidney, and
gastrointestinal tissues. Collectively, these data reveal a
tissue-specific molecular architecture that governs host responses to
microbial metabolites, notably in the GI tract. Our findings shed light
on how microbial compounds interact with host pathways at both the local
and systemic levels, paving the way for new microbiome-targeted
treatments and precision feeding initiatives.</p>

the evolutionary trajectory of the IncP-2 plasmid co-harboring blaIMP-45

<p>date: 2025-06-19, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundCarbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CRPA) poses a
significant global health risk, particularly for immunocompromised
individuals. This study documents an outbreak of CRPA strains
co-harboring blaVIM-1 and blaIMP-45 on IncP-2 plasmids in a Chinese
tertiary hospital, resulting in poor outcomes for transplant
patients.Methods17 ST313 VIM-1-IMP-45 CRPA strains were collected from
transplant patients, and antibiotic susceptibility was tested via
microbroth dilution. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) identified drug
resistance and virulence mechanisms, analyzed ST313 P. aeruginosa
phylogeny, and traced blaVIM-1 and blaIMP-45 origins. Conjugation
experiments were conducted to assess the conjugative potential of the
IncP-2 plasmid co-harboring blaVIM-1 and blaIMP-45. Structural and
molecular docking studies explored the PBP3 (P527S) mutation’s role in
aztreonam resistance.ResultsFrom February 2022 to July 2024, 17 ST313
VIM-1-IMP-45 CRPA strains from 10 transplant patients were identified.
All strains were extensively drug-resistant but sensitive to colistin
and cefiderocol. WGS showed blaIMP-45 and blaVIM-1 on an IncP-2
megaplasmid. Phylogenetic analysis indicated high homology with plasmids
carrying blaIMP-45. Further analysis of the genetic environment showed
that the IncP-2 plasmid co-harboring blaVIM-1 and blaIMP-45 was formed
by the insertion of a Tn3-family transposon carrying blaVIM-1 into the
IncP-2 plasmid carrying blaIMP-45. In addition aztreonam-resistant
strains (14/15) had a PBP3 (P527S) mutation, with molecular docking
studies suggesting reduced aztreonam binding.ConclusionsThis study
reports a clonal outbreak of ST313 P. aeruginosa strains co-producing
IMP-45 and VIM-1 carbapenemases in a tertiary hospital. The evolutionary
path of the IncP-2 plasmid co-harboring blaIMP-45 and blaVIM-1 was
elucidated.</p>

sequencing for identification of nontuberculous mycobacteria and other
pathogens in patients with mixed infection of the lung</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-19, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundIt can be difficult to distinguish lung disease caused by
nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and mixed
infections (MIs) that include NTM. Metagenomic next generation
sequencing (mNGS) is a highly sensitive method that can reliably
identify lung pathogens. We retrospectively analyzed the records of
patients who had MIs of the lungs that included NTM and received mNGS
testing.MethodsThe records of 36 patients who were diagnosed with NTM
infection of the lungs at the Second Hospital of Jilin University from
Nov 2023 to Jun 2024 were analyzed. Initial empirical treatments were
ineffective in all patients, leading to the application of mNGS of
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF).ResultsThe average patient age was
62.4 years, 22 patients had one or more underlying chronic disease, and
all patients had at least one respiratory symptom (cough, sputum
production, fever, or dyspnea). Chest CT examinations showed that
patients had different degrees of pneumonia and pleural effusion. Among
tested patients, there were elevated levels of erythrocyte sedimentation
rate in 81.8% (18/22) and elevated C-reactive protein in 90.5% (19/21).
There were variable results from acid-fast staining of bronchoalveolar
lavage fluid (BALF; 3/36, 8.3%), and transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB;
5/14, 35.7%). mNGS identified seven NTM species. Treatment based on the
mNGS results led to the resolution of clinical symptoms and absorption
of lung lesions in all patients.ConclusionsMost of the 36 patients with
MIs of the lungs that included NTM had underlying diseases. The results
of traditional tests, including sputum or BALF culture and smear, acute
phase markers, and TBLB pathological examination, were problematic. mNGS
provides rapid and reliable diagnosis, allowing the rapid implementation
of appropriate therapy in patients with MIs of the lungs that include
NTM.</p>

VII secretion system gene mutations driving global mycobacterium
tuberculosis transmission revealed by whole genomic sequence</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionPathogenic mycobacteria are able to transfer virulence
factors across their complex cell wall using a type VII secretion system
(T7SS)/early secreted antigenic target-6 of the kDa secretion system
(ESX). Since the discovery of ESX loci during the Mycobacterium
tuberculosis H37Rv genome project, extensive research in areas such as
structural biology, cell biology, and evolutionary analysis has improved
our understanding of the role of these systems. However, regulatory
mechanisms for ESX in Mycobacterium tuberculosis remain elusive. Despite
extensive research, the effects of ESX gene mutations on the dynamics of
Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission are not well understood. In this
study, we investigated the role of ESX mutations in TB transmission,
assessing their risk and characteristics. We analyzed 13582 whole genome
sequences of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates, of which 6130 (45.13%)
were clustered strains. Initially, Boruta algorithm was used to pinpoint
SNPs that were significant for TB transmission. These SNPs were then
subjected to univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis to
determine the significance of each SNP. The intersection of these two
independent methods was recognized as the optimal set of risk mutations
for TB transmission. Specifically, we identified one risk mutation
(espA(Rv3616c, 4055801)) in L1, four risk mutations (espK(Rv3879c,
4357597), esxU(Rv3445c, 3863138), esxO(Rv2346c, 2626018), and
esxW(Rv3620c, 4060588)) in L2, and four risk mutations (eccE1(Rv3882c,
4362807), espE(Rv3864, 4340330), espA(Rv3616c, 4055993), and
eccC5(Rv1783, 2019942)) in L4. These risk mutations were significantly
associated with clustering, potentially increasing TB transmission. Our
findings suggest that mutations in ESX genes play a crucial role in
Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission. These results can be applied to
the development of novel strategies for the treatment and prevention of
disease.</p>

from cross-pathogen studies: understanding the metabolic rewiring of

<p>date: 2025-06-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Bacterial infections remain a significant cause of morbidity and
mortality globally. Compounding the issue is the rise of
antimicrobial-resistant strains, which limit treatment options.
Macrophages play key roles in the immunity and pathogenicity of
intracellular infections, such as those caused by Mycobacterium
tuberculosis and Salmonella. Recent advancements have enabled us to
better understand how the host orchestrates immune responses to fight
these infections and, specifically how the infected cell rewires its
metabolism to face this challenge. The engagement of the host cell in
specific metabolic pathways impacts cell function and behaviour, and
ultimately, infection outcomes. In this perspective, we summarise key
findings regarding the metabolic adaptations in macrophages induced by
Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Salmonella infections. We also explore
how cross-pathogen studies can deepen our insights into infection
biology to improve therapeutic design.</p>

<p>BackgroundAlveolar echinococcosis (AE), a severe zoonotic disease
predominantly endemic to pastoral regions, is characterized by hepatic
parasitic lesions caused by Echinococcus multilocularis.MethodsThis
study investigated the role of T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-4
(TIMD4/Tim-4) in patients with hepatic AE. In total, 129 patients were
enrolled from the First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical
University between 1 March 2018 and 1 March 2021. Histological, genetic,
and serological tests were employed to evaluate Tim-4 and inflammatory
cytokine expression. The liver immune microenvironment at the middle and
late stages of mice infected with E. multilocularis was established in
vitro to assess cytokine dynamics and liver fibrosis
biomarkers.ResultsClinical analysis revealed the upregulation of Tim-4
within the hepatic lesions of patients with AE, with its expression
spatially localized to macrophage-enriched regions and functionally
linked to extracellular inflammatory modulation. Meanwhile, the liver
tissues of the patients had characteristic pathological changes in the
vesicles and progressive fibrotic remodeling, concurrent with a
significant suppression of proinflammatory cytokine activity. Tim-4+
macrophages inhibited the release of proinflammatory cytokines at the
middle and late stages of E. multilocularis infection to maintain immune
tolerance, and inhibition of Tim-4 expression may even reverse the level
of liver fibrosis in vitro.ConclusionsTim-4 attenuated the predominant
proinflammatory response, thereby facilitating immune evasion by E.
multilocularis. Notably, inhibition of Tim-4 in macrophages not only
restored the inflammatory balance but also significantly reversed
hepatic fibrotic progression.</p>

and Helicobacter pylori infection: a correlation in metabolic
dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundMetabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease
(MAFLD) has recently replaced nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)
as a term that more accurately describes its pathogenesis. Helicobacter
pylori (H. pylori), a bacterium that infects over half the world’s
population, has been increasingly linked to various extragastric
diseases. However, the impact of H. pylori on MAFLD in the Chinese
population remains unexplored.MethodsA retrospective cross-sectional
study was conducted, encompassing 5619 participants from the First
Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, spanning from April
2016 to August 2017. Detection of H. pylori was achieved through the 13C
urea breath test or gastric biopsies with histochemical staining. Fatty
liver was primarily diagnosed via ultrasound and assessed alongside
metabolic indicators to confirm MAFLD. Logistic regression was utilized
to evaluate the association between H. pylori and MAFLD.ResultsNo
significant correlation between H. pylori infection and MAFLD was found
in the overall population through either univariate (OR=1.136, 95%CI
0.995-1.297, p=0.059) or multivariate logistic regression analysis
(OR=1.036, 95%CI 0.877-1.224, p=0.675). However, subgroup analysis
revealed a significant association in overweight individuals (BMI ≥ 23
kg/m2) within the MAFLD group (51.2% vs. 35.5%, p=0.002), a pattern not
observed in the non-MAFLD group (47.7% vs. 45.4%, p=0.126). This
association persisted after adjusting for confounders (OR=1.957, 95%CI
1.176-3.256, p=0.010).ConclusionOverweight individuals with MAFLD have a
higher prevalence of H. pylori infection than their lean counterparts.
This suggests a detrimental cycle between overweight status and H.
pylori infection in MAFLD patients, potentially exacerbating metabolic
deterioration. Therefore, eradication of H. pylori infection may have
positive implications for reducing the incidence rate of overweight
MAFLD.</p>

for the role of Irk2 and Irk5 in ATP and metabolism regulation in
Cryptococcus neoformans</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionCryptococcus neoformans, a human fungal pathogen, harbors
the kinases Irk2 and Irk5, which are classified within the APH
phosphotransferase, AGC/YANK protein kinase, and diacylglycerol
kinase-like kinase families. Both Irk2 and Irk5 are pivotal for
virulence during lung and brain infections. Previous studies have
demonstrated that deletion of the IRK5 gene results in a significant
reduction in cell wall associated melanin production, a vital virulence
factor that facilitates evasion of host immune responses, while deletion
of IRK2 does not manifest any notable phenotypic alterations.MethodsTo
investigate the impact of IRK2 or IRK5 deletion, we generated targeted
deletion mutants for each gene. Following the creation of these mutants,
we conducted mass spectrometry analyses to evaluate changes in their
proteomic and metabolomic profiles. Moreover, we measured intracellular
ATP levels in both the wild-type and mutant strains to assess
modifications in ATP synthesis.ResultsMass spectrometry analyses
revealed significant alterations in protein and metabolite expression
levels in the IRK2 or IRK5 deletion mutant compared to the wild-type
strain. Furthermore, the deletion of either IRK2 or IRK5 resulted in
notable changes in intracellular ATP levels.ConclusionThis study
suggests that the core virulence kinases Irk2 and Irk5 may play roles in
regulating ATP levels and metabolic pathways. By elucidating the effects
of these kinases on the proteomic and metabolomic profiles of C.
neoformans, this research contributes to our understanding of the
underlying molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of this
pathogen.</p>

<p>BackgroundClinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of azvudine
in alleviating clinical symptoms among patients with coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19). However, evidence regarding its real-world
effectiveness and safety profile remains limited.ObjectiveTo evaluate
the effectiveness and safety of azvudine in COVID-19
patients.MethodsThis retrospective cohort study included 192 COVID-19
patients hospitalized in Fengtai District, Beijing, from November 1 to
December 31, 2022. Patients were divided into azvudine (n=118) and
non-azvudine (n=74) groups. Propensity score matching (PSM) was applied
to balance baseline characteristics (age, sex, vaccination status,
etc.), yielding 48 matched pairs. Outcomes included time to SARS-CoV-2
RNA negativity, hospitalization duration, and symptom resolution (fever,
cough). Adverse events were recorded.ResultsAfter PSM, 48 pairs of
COVID-19 patients were identified. The azvudine group exhibited
significantly shorter hospitalization than the non-azvudine group
(median: 8 vs. 10 days, P ≤ 0.05). No significant differences were
observed in time to RNA negativity (4.23 vs. 4.52 days, P&gt;0.05),
fever duration (2 vs. 2 days, P&gt;0.05), or cough duration (4.5 vs. 5
days, P&gt;0.05). One case of mild gastrointestinal discomfort was
reported in the azvudine group.ConclusionAzvudine significantly reduced
hospitalization duration in mild-to-moderate COVID-19 patients with a
favorable safety profile.</p>

dynamics</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The persistence of the major enteric pathogen Campylobacter jejuni in
the natural environment, despite being microaerophilic, remains
unsolved. Its survival in the natural atmospheric environment likely
stems from several factors, including interactions with amoebae. C.
jejuni transiently interacts with Acanthamoeba, and this is thought to
provide protection against unfavorable atmospheric conditions and
subsequently prime the bacteria for interactions with warm-blooded
hosts. Acanthamoeba play vital roles in microbial ecosystems by preying
on bacterial species, some of which are clinically important. We
analyzed the whole transcriptome of A. castellanii infected with C.
jejuni 11168H. Our findings provide evidence that infection of A.
castellanii with C. jejuni triggers distinct and reproducible cellular
responses. Upregulated genes were associated with protein synthesis, DNA
damage and repair, gluconeogenic pathways, and protein folding and
targeting, while downregulated genes were involved in calcium ion
transport, osmotic stress response, energy reserve metabolic processes,
and protein hydroxylation. From these data, we characterized Cj0979c,
named here C. jejuni endonuclease (CjeN), which induces DNA damage in A.
castellanii. High-resolution microscopy revealed an unexpected
association between C. jejuni and host mitochondria, while infected
cells show elevated cytosolic calcium levels and metabolic changes
favoring “Warburg-like” metabolism. A. castellanii cells showed
increased lactate production, which was subsequently depleted,
suggesting that this host metabolic by-product may support C. jejuni
survival. These findings identify an unexpected interaction between
amoebae and a microaerophilic bacterium and provides a useful model for
further research on host–pathogen interactions.</p>

habits and vaginal environment: can a beneficial impact be
expected?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionIn reproductive-aged women, a vaginal microbiota
dominated by several Lactobacillus species is crucial for maintaining
vaginal health. Among the various factors affecting the composition of
the vaginal ecosystem, the impact of dietary habits has rarely been
explored. Thus, in this cross-sectional study, we assessed the role of
macronutrient intake on the vaginal microbiota in a cohort of 113 young
women, independently from potential confounders.MethodsFor each subject,
we characterized (i) the vaginal bacterial community-state type (CST) by
16S rRNA gene profiling, (ii) the vagina lmetabolic profile by 1H-NMR
spectroscopy, and (iii) the energy, nutrient and alcohol intake through
a validated food frequency questionnaire.ResultsWe found that the
increase in animal protein intake, mainly derived from red and processed
meat, was positively associated with the dysbiotic condition of CST IV
and, similarly, alcohol consumption was significantly associated with
the levels of Gardnerella spp. and Ureaplasma spp. On the other hand, we
noticed a beneficial effect of a-linolenic acid, with its increase
inversely associated with CST III, dominated by the ‘less-protective’
species Lactobacillus iners. Moreover, linolenic acid was related to the
abundance of Lactobacillus crispatus, in turn related tovarious vaginal
metabolites such as 4-hydroxyphenyllactate and several amino acids.
Total carbohydrates, vegetable proteins, total fiber, and starch were
negatively correlated with Gardnerella spp.DiscussionWe highlighted that
specific dietary habits (i.e., reduced consumption of alcohol and animal
proteins, higher intake of linolenic acid) can have a beneficial impact
on the vaginal environment, through the maintenance of a microbiota
mainly dominated by ‘protective’ Lactobacillus species.</p>

<p>IntroductionNorovirus is a key pathogen of acute gastroenteritis and
poses a significant burden on both the economy and public health. This
study focuses on continuous monitoring of norovirus in Shenzhen, China,
from 2016 to 2022, aiming to analyze the epidemic characteristics and
genetic diversity of norovirus in the context of global sequence
data.MethodsThe study was based on data collected from local sentinel
hospitals. It involved analyzing the demographic, spatial, and temporal
distribution of norovirus infections. Phylogenetic analysis was
conducted, and genotype dynamics were compared across geographic levels.
Mutations affecting protein stability were evaluated, and recombination
analysis was performed to identify critical breakpoints and fragments
for norovirus.ResultsThe study found that norovirus primarily infected
infants under 3 years old, with epidemics occurring in winter and
concentrated in developed districts. Phylogenetic analysis revealed both
similarities and differences in the evolutionary patterns of various
genotypes at different geographical levels. Mutations in the VP1
protein, based on the protein structure of GII.4_Sydney[P31], provided
insights into the evolutionary trends of key genotypes. Additionally,
recombination analysis identified important breakpoints and fragments
for norovirus.DiscussionThe findings offer valuable insights to
evolution and transmission of norovirus. These results can serve as a
reference for future research, and they may aid in vaccine development
efforts aimed at controlling norovirus outbreaks.</p>

<p>date: 2025-06-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectiveThis study aimed to evaluate the real-world clinical
efficacy and safety of cefepime in treating pediatric community-acquired
pneumonia (CAP), comparing it with other broad-spectrum antibiotics,
including cefoperazone-sulbactam and meropenem, using a propensity
score-matched design.MethodsA retrospective, propensity score-matched
cohort study was conducted in pediatric patients (0–18 years)
hospitalized with CAP. Patients treated with cefepime were compared to
those treated with cefoperazone-sulbactam or meropenem. Clinical
outcomes, microbiological clearance, and adverse events were assessed,
and propensity score matching was applied to minimize
confounding.ResultsA total of 788 patients were included, with 720 in
the cefepime group and 68 in the comparator group. Both groups showed
comparable clinical efficacy, with no significant differences in symptom
resolution, laboratory normalization, or radiographic improvement.
Microbiological clearance rates were also similar between the groups.
The incidence of adverse events was low in both groups, and no
statistically significant difference in adverse events was observed
between cefepime and the comparator group.ConclusionOur results suggest
that cefepime is a clinically effective and well-tolerated alternative
to other broad-spectrum antibiotics for pediatric CAP, demonstrating
comparable clinical outcomes and safety profiles. These findings support
cefepime as a viable empiric therapy option, particularly in settings
with limited microbiological diagnostics. Further studies are needed to
confirm these results and optimize dosing strategies for pediatric
populations.</p>

gut microbiota alterations in Parkinson’s disease: distinct associations
compared to healthy individuals</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Background and objectivesAnxiety affects 25–49% of Parkinson’s
disease (PD) patients, exacerbating non-motor symptoms and significantly
reducing quality of life. Growing evidence suggests that gut microbiota
plays a role in anxiety, but whether its impact differs between PD and
non-PD populations remains unclear. This study explores the
heterogeneity of gut microbiota-associated anxiety in PD and non-PD
individuals.MethodsParticipants from the NeuroGenetics Research
Consortium provided clinical data, including PD status, anxiety status,
and stool samples analyzed via 16S rRNA sequencing. After excluding nine
participants with missing anxiety data, 322 individuals were included
(193 PD, 129 non-PD). We assessed α-diversity, β-diversity, taxonomic
composition, and functional pathways to compare microbial differences
between anxious and non-anxious individuals within and across PD and
non-PD groups.ResultsBeta diversity analysis revealed significant
microbial differences between anxious and non-anxious PD patients (p =
0.043 in Bray-Curtis index) but not in the non-PD group.
Escherichia-Shigella was significantly enriched in non-anxious PD
patients (p = 0.011). Functional pathway analysis identified distinct
metabolic alterations associated with anxiety in PD and non-PD
individuals. In non-PD participants, anxiety was linked to increased
activity in glycosphingolipid biosynthesis, sphingolipid metabolism,
other glycan degradation, glycosphingolipid biosynthesis, and
glycosaminoglycan degradation. In contrast, PD patients with anxiety
exhibited enrichment in indole alkaloid biosynthesis, linoleic acid
metabolism, and polyketide sugar unit biosynthesis.ConclusionGut
microbiota-associated anxiety differs between PD and non-PD populations,
suggesting distinct pathophysiological mechanisms. These findings
underscore the potential of microbiome-targeted interventions as novel
therapeutic strategies for anxiety in PD patients.</p>

essential oil (Origanum vulgare) induces death in a resistant strain of
Leishmania infantum isolated from a naturally infected dog through
increased production of reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial damage

<p>date: 2025-06-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Background: Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by
protozoa of the Leishmania genus, transmitted by phlebotomine sandflies.
Clinical manifestations vary depending on the parasite’s species and the
host’s immune system, ranging from self-healing skin lesions to lethal
visceral diseases. Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), mainly caused by L.
infantum and L. donovani, is a serious public health issue. Conventional
treatment is challenging due to toxicity, long duration, and resistance,
highlighting the need for alternative therapies. Oregano essential oil
(OEO) has biological effects, including antibacterial, antifungal, and
antioxidant actions, making it a potential leishmanicidal agent. To
evaluate its activity, promastigotes of two L. infantum strains were
tested: MS (from naturally infected dogs in Brazil) and a reference
strain (MCAN/BR/97/p142). The IC50 values were 12.53 µg/mL and 43.61
µg/mL, respectively, while amphotericin B (AmB) showed lower IC50 values
(0.1453 µg/mL and 0.2126 µg/mL). OEO treatment increased reactive oxygen
species (ROS) production, mitochondrial damage, lipid droplet
accumulation, and autophagic vacuoles, indicating intense cellular
stress. Additionally, apoptosis markers such as phosphatidylserine
exposure and membrane permeabilization were detected. Fluorescence,
scanning (SEM), and transmission (TEM) microscopy revealed morphological
and ultrastructural alterations, including membrane blebbing, flagellar
damage, intracellular content leakage, and mitochondrial swelling. To
assess its anti-amastigote effect, THP-1 cells infected with L. infantum
strains were treated with OEO. The MS strain showed a lower infection
rate but a higher parasite load per macrophage. All tested
concentrations (25, 50, and 75 μg/mL) reduced both the number of
infected macrophages and intracellular amastigotes. Thus, OEO exhibits
leishmanicidal activity in both promastigote and amastigote forms of L.
infantum, inducing metabolic disruption and cell death, even in strains
from naturally infected dogs. These findings highlight OEO’s potential
as an alternative treatment for VL.</p>

potential biomarkers for predicting childhood caries via metagenomic
analysis</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundDental caries is a prevalent global health issue,
particularly among children, with significant oral and overall health
implications. The oral microbiome is considered a critical factor in
caries development, with various microbial species implicated in the
disease process.ObjectivesThis study aims to explore the changes and
interactions of oral microbiota in childhood caries using metagenomic
analysis, and identify potential biomarkers for early caries detection
and treatment.MethodsSaliva samples were collected from 241 children
aged 6 to 9 years, categorized into caries-free (CF), low-caries (CL),
and caries-severe (CS) groups. Metagenomic sequencing was performed to
analyze the oral microbiome, followed by a series of statistical and
functional analyses to characterize microbial diversity and
function.ResultsThe study revealed significant differences in the
microbial community composition among the groups, with the CS group
exhibiting higher alpha and beta diversity than that of the CF group.
Numerous unclassified microorganisms, such as Campylobacter SGB19347 and
Catonella SGB4501, are intimately linked to dental caries and display
intricate interaction networks, suggesting the potential formation of a
distinct ecological network. In functional assessment, we identified a
possible link between pectin and caries, suggesting that microorganisms
that produce pectinase enzymes might play a role in the advancement of
severe dental caries. Additionally, we identified 16 species as the best
marker for severe dental caries, achieving an impressive AUC of
0.91.ConclusionThe role of microbiota in dental caries is multifaceted,
involving a complex interplay of microbial species and functions. Our
findings enhance the understanding of the microbial basis of dental
caries and offer potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets. The
predictive capacity of the identified biomarkers warrants further
investigation for early caries detection and intervention.Clinical
SignificanceThe identification of novel biomarkers through metagenomic
analysis enables early detection and targeted intervention for childhood
caries, potentially transforming children dental care and significantly
improving long-term oral health outcomes.</p>

<p>IntroductionCarbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) bloodstream
infections (BSI) represent a frequent and grave complication among
hematological patients, whose prevailing culprits are
Carbapenem-Resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) and Escherichia coli
bacteremia (EC). Nevertheless, there is a paucity of studies that have
undertaken a comparative analysis of clinical outcomes in patients
afflicted with CRKP and EC.MethodsThis study was conducted with the aim
of identifying the microbiological and clinical characteristics of
hematological patients suffering from bacteremia caused by CRKP and
CREC.ResultsThe cohort included 90 patients with equal proportions of
CRKP BSI and CREC BSI from 2017 to 2022. Among the tested CRE strains (n
= 45) for carbapenemase (CP) genes, the KPC gene was most commonly found
in CP-CRKP isolates (12/21), while the NDM gene predominated among
CP-CREC strains (18/24). A comparison of drug susceptibility showed that
CREC was significantly more susceptible to tigecycline than CRKP (97.73%
vs. 64.86%, P = 0.018). Patients treated with tigecycline-based therapy
had a higher survival rate in the CREC group (18/24,75%) compared to the
CRKP group (8/14,57.1%). The CRKP group had a significantly lower rate
of prior cephalosporin use within 30 days compared to the CREC group
(27% vs. 49%, P = 0.03) and a higher incidence of multi-site infections
before BSI (44% vs. 8.9%, P&lt;0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that
BSI caused by CRKP was an independent risk factor for survival (P =
0.029), while CAZ-AVI-based therapy emerged as an independent factor
improving patient prognosis (P =0.013).ConclusionsOur results found that
bacteremia instigated by CRKP was associated with a less favorable
prognosis when compared to cases induced by CREC. Moreover, treatment
regimens incorporating CAZ-AVI have the potential to enhance the
prognosis of patients grappling with CRE BSI.</p>

<p>Acrosin is a proteolytic enzyme in the sperm acrosome that can
stimulate sperm to penetrate the zona pellucida, causing the
fertilization of the oocyte. Its activity is a crucial indicator of the
sperm’s fertilization ability, which is critical in mammalian and human
reproduction. However, there exists a lack of a comprehensive review of
acrosin. In this study, we compared the extraction methods of acrosin,
including acid extraction, buffer extraction, and saline extraction. The
main methods for purifying acrosin, such as ammonium sulfate
precipitation, ultrafiltration, dialysis, gel filtration chromatography,
ion-exchange chromatography, and affinity chromatography, are reviewed.
In addition, a detailed overview of the biological functions, inhibitors
and applications of acrosin are outlined. This study provides methods
for the extraction and purification of acrosin and some theoretical
basis for the study of its properties. This provides a reference for
further research on acrosin.</p>

<p>date: 2025-06-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Lactoferrin is known to exhibit broad spectrum activity against a
multitude of bacteria, fungi, and viruses due to its multi-functional
mode of action. Recently, Lactea Therapeutics and its affiliates have
developed a novel, patent-pending technology to purify naturally derived
bovine lactoferrin (Lactea Lf) for use as a medical countermeasure that
was not previously available. To assess the efficacy of Lactea Lf
against biothreat pathogens, we performed biofilm inhibition assays and
generated dose-response curves against Burkholderia pseudomallei,
Burkholderia mallei, and Francisella tularensis for proof-of-principle
studies. Here, we show that Lactea Lf can significantly inhibit biofilm
and decrease the overall growth in a dose dependent manner for all
Burkholderia species tested. Of note, Lactea Lf was found to completely
inhibit biofilm formation by virulent B. pseudomallei without observing
complete growth inhibition. The growth of F. tularensis was also
significantly inhibited when cultured in the presence of Lactea Lf and
appeared more sensitive to treatment when compared to B. pseudomallei.
Based on these results, a pneumonic infection model using the F.
tularensis LVS strain was performed prophylactically administering
Lactea Lf and continuing treatment post challenge. No protection was
observed in this model which prompted biodistribution studies using
fluorescent tagged Lactea Lf. These experiments revealed that
therapeutic material was mainly confined to the NALT region following
intranasal delivery and then quickly dispersed or inactivated suggesting
that future formulation and delivery method could be addressed to
increase in vivo treatment efficacy. Taken together, these data support
that Lactea Lf is a potentially new candidate for further studies as a
broad-spectrum antimicrobial medical countermeasure with efficacy
against several high priority biodefense-related bacterial
pathogens.</p>

interventions aimed at cccDNA: unveiling mechanisms and evaluating the
potency of natural products</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection persists as a formidable global
health predicament, imposing a substantial burden on public health. It
not only elevates the risk of cirrhosis but also significantly heightens
the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), thereby exacerbating
the complexity of managing this disease. Central to the intractability
of chronic hepatitis B is the tenacious persistence of covalently closed
circular DNA (cccDNA) within the nuclei of infected hepatocytes. This
cccDNA serves as a stable transcriptional template, continuously fueling
the production of viral components and rendering the virus refractory to
current antiviral interventions.​ The attainment of a definitive cure for
HBV infection hinges upon the development of innovative antiviral
strategies that can precisely and effectively target and eliminate
cccDNA from the infected liver cells. In this regard, natural products
have emerged as a promising source of potential therapeutics. This
comprehensive review delves into the natural products that have shown
promise in specifically targeting cccDNA. It meticulously elucidates the
intricate molecular mechanisms through which these natural compounds
modulate cccDNA activity, such as interfering with cccDNA formation,
disrupting its epigenetic regulation, or inhibiting its transcriptional
output. Developing innovative strategies to target and eliminate cccDNA
is crucial for curing HBV infection, and natural products hold great
promise. This review details several natural products with
cccDNA-targeting potential, supported by clear mechanisms and data.
Dehydrocheilanthifolin (DHCH) from Corydalis saxicola inhibits HBsAg and
HBeAg secretion in HepG2.2.15 cells. It may disrupt viral processes like
pgRNA packaging or DNA polymerase activity, with IC50 values for
reducing extracellular, intracellular DNA, and cccDNA at 15.08 μM, 7.62
μM, and 8.25 μM respectively. Methyl helicterate from Helicteres
angustifolia decreases HBsAg, HBeAg, HBV DNA, and cccDNA in HepG2.2.15
cells. 15.8 μM reduces intracellular cccDNA. Curcumin from turmeric
reduces viral load and cccDNA in d-imHCs; 30µM halves cccDNA levels.
Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) from green tea hinders viral
transcription and replication. 22.9μg/ml EGCG lowers cccDNA by about
60%. Asiaticoside from Hydrocotyle sibthorpioides inhibits HBsAg, HBeAg,
and cccDNA in HepG2.2.15 cells. Notably, despite extensive research, no
natural product has yet obtained clinical validation for cccDNA
clearance, highlighting the significant translational gap between
pre-clinical research and clinical application. By elucidating these
molecular mechanisms, this review aims to contribute to the development
of HBV-targeted therapies, offering valuable insights for designing
novel therapeutic agents and optimizing existing treatment regimens,
ultimately advancing the quest for an effective cure for HBV
infection.</p>

profiling of Chlamydia trachomatis and its host in an ex vivo
endocervical primary cell culture system using dual RNA sequencing</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) is an obligate intracellular bacterium
that causes significant ocular and urogenital morbidity worldwide.
Understanding host-pathogen interactions is challenging but dual RNA
sequencing offers simultaneous transcriptome data for comprehensive
interrogations into these interactions. While transcriptional profiling
of both Ct and host-derived immortalized cells has been performed, this
study used dual RNA sequencing to examine host-pathogen interactions in
ex vivo human primary endocervical stromal cells infected with Ct strain
E/Bour. At 1-hour post-infection (1hpi), 168 differentially expressed
host genes (DEGs) were identified, 40% of which were non-coding RNAs,
novel proteins, or pseudogenes. Pathway analysis revealed no significant
enrichment at this stage, indicating a quiescent host response. At
24hpi, 212 DEGs were identified, with strong upregulation of
interferon-stimulated genes and activation of the cGAS-STING and RLR
pathways, despite the absence of detectable type I interferons.
Pro-inflammatory and leukocyte recruitment genes were also highly
expressed, suggesting an immunoreactive phenotype at this later stage.
Ct transcriptomics identified 331 early and 903 mid-infection genes.
Inclusion-membrane genes peaked at 1hpi, while hemolysin-like and
polymorphic membrane protein genes were upregulated at 24hpi. Enrichment
analysis identified pathways related to catalytic activity, host
modulation, and bacterial survival. This study demonstrates distinct
temporal dynamics in Ct-host interactions, including early host immune
quiescence and robust mid-infection activation of innate immunity in
contradistinction to previous host and Ct findings in immortalized cell
lines. The findings emphasize the utility of ex vivo human primary cell
culture for investigating Ct pathogenesis using clinically relevant Ct
strains and provide a foundation for future exploration of
uncharacterized genes and pathways critical to Ct infection.</p>

combination of recombinase polymerase amplification with CRISPR
technology rapidly detects goose parvovirus with high accuracy and
sensitivity</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-16, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundGoose parvovirus (GPV) poses a significant threat to the
waterfowl industry, necessitating reliable detection methods. However,
conventional techniques are often time-consuming, equipment-dependent,
or lack sufficient sensitivity for detecting early-stage infection. In
contrast, emerging CRISPR/Cas12a-based systems offer a promising
alternative for rapid, sensitive, and on-site diagnostics.MethodsWe
developed and optimized a recombinase polymerase amplification
(RPA)-CRISPR/Cas12a assay targeting the conserved VP3 gene of GPV. The
analytical and diagnostic performance of this assay was rigorously
validated using plasmid standards and clinical specimens from both
experimentally infected and field-collected ducklings.ResultsOur
developed assay combines RPA with CRISPR/Cas12a technology for rapid GPV
nucleic acids detection. This method achieves a detection limit of 10
copies/μL of the VP3 gene within one hour, demonstrating high
sensitivity and rapid turnaround. The assay exhibited exceptional
specificity, with no cross-reactivity against other waterfowl viruses,
and showed robust reproducibility, with intra- and inter-assay
coefficients of variation consistently below 5.0%. Clinical validation
using 42 field samples confirmed a diagnostic sensitivity of 100% and
95.5% specificity, showing superior performance to real-time
quantitative PCR (qPCR) in both metrics. Furthermore, the assay supports
flexible visual readouts using portable blue light transilluminators,
facilitating on-site interpretation.ConclusionsThis study established a
highly field-deployable RPA-CRISPR/Cas12a assay for rapid, visual
detection of GPV with outstanding sensitivity and specificity. Its
capability for instrument-free on-site diagnosis via blue light
transillumination makes this approach particularly promising for
resource-limited settings.</p>

dengue vaccine challenges through next-generation virus-like particle
immunization strategies</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-16, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Dengue fever represents an escalating global health threat, as
unprecedented outbreaks expose significant limitations of current
vaccine strategies. Conventional live-attenuated dengue vaccines, while
partially efficacious, face critical hurdles including serotype
imbalances and antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). This review
critically assesses virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines as a promising
alternative, providing safer, non-replicating platforms that mimic viral
structure without risks associated with live replication. Technological
advancements in recombinant expression systems have improved VLP yield,
stability, and scalability, addressing deployment obstacles. Recent
preclinical studies demonstrate that tetravalent dengue VLP vaccines
induce balanced neutralizing antibodies across all serotypes,
effectively circumventing ADE in animal models. These findings suggest
superior safety and robust immune responses, potentially surpassing
live-attenuated and mRNA-based vaccines. We emphasize advancements in
VLP vaccine technology, including novel tetravalent particle designs
engineered to exclude ADE-related immunopathogenic components (prM
protein), innovative stability-enhancing formulation techniques, and
cost-effective recombinant production platforms (yeast and plant-based
systems). Additionally, this review proposes novel deployment
strategies, such as regional manufacturing hubs, standardized modular
VLP platforms, adaptive clinical trial frameworks leveraging surrogate
endpoints, and strengthened international coordination for equitable
vaccine distribution. Integrating these scientific innovations and
practical strategies positions dengue VLP vaccines as pivotal
next-generation solutions for global dengue prevention.</p>

<p>date: 2025-06-16, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The discovering new fungal strains, optimal production, and
understanding the fundamental aspects of exopolysaccharides (EPs) are
important to utilize them in an industrial, medical, and
biotechnological perspective. In this study, the optimal conditions for
EP production from seven basidiomycetous fungal strains were
investigated. The results indicated that six fungal species,
Schizophyllum commune, Ganoderma fornicatum, G. williamsianum, Earliella
scabrosa, Favolus tenuiculus, and Pycnoporus sanguineus, produced the
highest EP yield in potato dextrose broth. The highest yield of EPs
produced by Lentinus sajor-caju was obtained in mushroom complete medium
broth. It was found that a pH value between 6 and 8 in the liquid
culture media promoted EP production. The highest EP yield was obtained
for 10 to 14 days which depends on fungal strain. Interestingly, this
present study revealed the first report of EP production from G.
fornicatum, G. williamsianum, E. scabrosa, F. tenuiculus, and P.
sanguineus, including the genera Earliella and Favolus. The obtained
crude EPs showed water solubilization ability. The Fourier-transform
infrared spectroscopy spectra exhibited typical carbohydrate patterns in
all crude EPs. Monosaccharide composition analysis revealed that the
crude EPs were primarily composed of glucose, followed by fructose,
allose, and allulose, with variations depending on the fungal strain.
Additionally, crude EPs demonstrated positive antioxidant potential.
Finally, we determined the anti-Salmonella and immunomodulatory effects
of crude EPs from S. commune, G. fornicatum, and L. sajor-caju due to
their high EP yield. Pretreatment of mouse macrophages with these fungal
EPs enhanced the phagocytic killing activity of Salmonella-infected
macrophages. Upregulations of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in
macrophages were detected in the fungal EPs-treated groups. Our study
reported the optimizing conditions for EP production from several
strains of Basidiomycetous fungi and their potential as an alternative
to antibiotics for multidrug-resistant Salmonella infection.</p>

effects of cervical cerclage on the vaginal microbiota and its
metabolites in pregnant women</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-16, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Cervical cerclage is widely used to reduce the risk of preterm birth
in pregnant women. The effects of cervical cerclage on the vaginal
microbiota and its metabolites are not fully clear. The purpose of this
study was to explore the influence of cervical cerclage on the vaginal
microbiota and its metabolites. Our results showed that the clinical
characteristics [white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil, lymphocyte,
monocytes, platelet, NLR, PLR, SII, SIRI, and C-reactive protein (CRP)]
and α-diversity (Observed, Shannon, Chao1, and Simpson indexes) of the
vaginal microbiota were not altered during pregnancy after cervical
cerclage. 16S rRNA gene sequencing found that the relative abundance of
Muribaculaceae and Blautia was significantly increased in the
post-cerclage group compared with the pre-cerclage group, but the
relative abundance of Sneathia was significantly reduced. In addition,
the volcano plot revealed that a total of 19 metabolites [including
alpha-hydroxyalprazolam, LPE (18:1(9Z)/0:0), PS(16:0/15:0),
N-acetylhistamine, carnitine, pseudouridine, and allopregnanolone] were
significantly changed during pregnancy after cervical cerclage. Pathway
analysis based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
database showed that the changes in the vaginal microbiota and its
metabolites mainly involved purine metabolism and amino acid metabolism.
The alteration in the vaginal microbiota and its metabolites induced by
cervical cerclage is associated with the therapeutic efficacy of
cervical cerclage. Further studies are needed to explore how the vaginal
microbiota affects the outcomes of pregnancy.</p>

bacterial community dynamics during induction of gingival
inflammation</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-16, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThe human oral cavity is a complex and dynamic microbial
ecosystem integral to oral and overall health. While the specific roles
of microbial communities in health and disease are not fully understood,
dysbiosis of the oral microbiota is, along with inadequate immune
fitness, recognized as a key factor driving the onset of inflammatory
conditions such as gingivitis. Gingivitis, an early and reversible stage
of periodontal disease, involves shifts in microbial composition and
diversity. This study aimed to investigate the compositional dynamics of
the oral microbiota during the early stages of gingival inflammation,
focusing on changes across multiple oral niches and their relationship
to clinical outcomes.MethodsWe conducted an experimental gingivitis
intervention study with 41 healthy volunteers. After a two-week baseline
period, participants refrained from oral hygiene for two weeks to induce
gingivitis, followed by a one-week resolution phase with resumed oral
hygiene. Clinical parameters, including plaque and bleeding scores, were
monitored at seven time points. Samples from saliva and five oral niches
(tongue, keratinized gingiva, supragingival, subgingival, and
interproximal dental plaque) were collected and analyzed using 16S rRNA
gene sequencing. Multivariate statistical analyses were applied to
evaluate microbial dynamics and their associations with clinical
outcomes.ResultsThe study revealed pronounced microbial changes,
particularly in supragingival plaque, where Leptotrichia and Prevotella
increased while Streptococcus decreased. Alpha diversity significantly
increased in supragingival plaque, tongue, and saliva during gingivitis
induction, highlighting shifts in microbial complexity. Clinical
correlations indicated that plaque presence was primarily associated
with bacterial load, while gingival bleeding was driven by compositional
changes in supragingival plaque and tongue biofilms. These findings
suggest that microbial density and composition independently contribute
to gingivitis markers.ConclusionThis study concludes that occurrence of
dental plaque and gingival bleeding are independent clinical parameters,
linked to bacterial load and composition, respectively. Interactions
between multiple niches, especially the tongue, influence clinical
outcomes, highlighting a complex, nonlinear dynamic behavior in the oral
microbiota. These findings suggest intricate ecological interactions
that may approach tipping points, advancing understanding of microbial
dynamics during gingival inflammation and informing future strategies
for managing gingivitis.</p>
