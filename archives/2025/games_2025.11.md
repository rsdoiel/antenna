date: 2025-03-20, updated: 2025-03-19, from: Polygon Website

What’s better than the idea of a road trip? It’s one of the most romantic and liberating forms of travel — combining go-anywhere freedom with the ability to quickly cover large distances and drink in the landscape as you travel. In the real world, though, clogged roads and energy efficiency concerns can dent your enjoyment; [&#8230;]

## Assassin’s Creed Shadows guides and walkthroughs

date: 2025-03-20, updated: 2025-03-20, from: Polygon Website

Assassin’s Creed Shadows sees the long-running stealth series cover perhaps its most requested setting: feudal Japan.

## Should you play canon mode in Assassin’s Creed Shadows?

date: 2025-03-20, updated: 2025-03-19, from: Polygon Website

Canon mode is a setting in Assassin’s Creed Shadows. Like all the familiar boot-up settings — subtitle preferences, game difficulty, immersive mode, guided exploration mode, and so on — you’ll choose whether or not to activate it before starting a new game. But the thing is, once you select it, you can’t change it. You’re [&#8230;]

## This underrated sci-fi horror game has the coolest UI design since Dead Space

date: 2025-03-19, updated: 2025-03-18, from: Polygon Website

Experimental user interface design is worth admiring. When done right, a game’s UI can not only serve the vital role of communicating important game mechanics to the player, but convey something deeper about the universe the player’s avatar inhabits and how they themselves view the world. One of the most memorable examples of this is [&#8230;]

## All Galar Pokémon in Pokémon Go so far

The Galar region is in Pokémon Go, meaning Pokémon from the Sword and Shield games (Gen 8) will start appearing over time. Most Pokémon will get added through events, with various Pokémon making their debuts around whatever theme each event has. While we did already have some Pokémon like Falinks and regional variations like Galarian [&#8230;]

## Opus’ director intended the movie’s ending as a warning

Ambition is a great thing. It drives us to seek out bigger and bigger things, or even just something new. No one knows that better than Opus protagonist Ariel (Ayo Edebiri), a music writer who can’t get a single pitch through her editor (at least, without him stealing it). That changes when aging pop star [&#8230;]

## I installed a bunch of Fallout 4 mods to experience maximum coziness

Typing “cozy” into the Fallout 4 section of Nexus Mods doesn&#8217;t bring you as many actually cozy mods as you might think. According to modders, a custom bedroom with an American flag, something called “visible rain,” and a busty sweater are all cozy. I realize that the nuclear post-apocalypse isn&#8217;t exactly chill, but mods are [&#8230;]

## The comic book story behind Daredevil’s mystery killer

date: 2025-03-19, updated: 2025-03-17, from: Polygon Website

The funny thing about Daredevil: Born Again is that, despite sharing a name with one of the most iconic Daredevil stories ever told, it’s not based on that story at all. (In part because 2018’s third season of Netflix’s Daredevil already adapted it.)&#160; No, Daredevil: Born Again owes much more to Charles Soule’s 2015-2018 run [&#8230;]

The Master League in Pokémon Go’s Go Battle League features the best of the best, thanks to its lack of CP cap — meaning titans of the Pokédex lock heads in heated battles, and only the very best trainers stand to reach the top of the rankings.&#160; Whether you’re looking to introduce your Pokémon to [&#8230;]

## The official Cyberpunk 2077 board game is 36% off for the first time

The transition from tabletop to video game, then back to tabletop, is something that few franchises have done successfully. Yet Cyberpunk has done it with relative ease. The Gangs of Night City board game from CMON borrows the setting and much of the styling of CD Projekt Red’s first-person RPG, Cyberpunk 2077, and turns it [&#8230;]

## Can Shellder be shiny in Pokémon Go?

Shellder, the water-type bivalve Pokémon from Kanto, can be found in the wild in Pokémon Go. Yes, Shellder can be shiny in Pokémon Go! Cloyster doesn’t see much use in raids, as there’s many ice- and water-type Pokémon that do significantly more damage than it. However, Cloyster does see some usage in Ultra League PvP [&#8230;]

## Looking back at how Nintendo pitched the original Switch

It’s been more than eight years since we were first introduced to the Nintendo Switch. What was once seen as a bold new concept and a reinvention of Nintendo’s console business —&#160;a move that initially spooked investors —&#160;now feels pretty normal. Widespread adoption certainly helped. Since 2017, Nintendo has sold a staggering 150 million Switch [&#8230;]
