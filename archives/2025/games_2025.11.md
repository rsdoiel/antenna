## This underrated sci-fi horror game has the coolest UI design since Dead Space

date: 2025-03-19, updated: 2025-03-18, from: Polygon Website

Experimental user interface design is worth admiring. When done right, a game’s UI can not only serve the vital role of communicating important game mechanics to the player, but convey something deeper about the universe the player’s avatar inhabits and how they themselves view the world. One of the most memorable examples of this is [&#8230;]

## All Galar Pokémon in Pokémon Go so far

date: 2025-03-19, updated: 2025-03-19, from: Polygon Website

The Galar region is in Pokémon Go, meaning Pokémon from the Sword and Shield games (Gen 8) will start appearing over time. Most Pokémon will get added through events, with various Pokémon making their debuts around whatever theme each event has. While we did already have some Pokémon like Falinks and regional variations like Galarian [&#8230;]

## How to get Nickit and evolution Thievul in Pokémon Go

date: 2025-03-19, updated: 2025-03-19, from: Polygon Website

Nickit makes its debut in Pokémon Go as part of March 2025’s “Deep Depths” event. The Galar dark-type can evolve into Thievul as part of its evolution line, provided you have enough Candy. Unlike many new Pokémon added to Pokémon Go in the past year, Nickit can be encountered in the wild — though there [&#8230;]

## Opus’ director intended the movie’s ending as a warning

date: 2025-03-19, updated: 2025-03-18, from: Polygon Website

Ambition is a great thing. It drives us to seek out bigger and bigger things, or even just something new. No one knows that better than Opus protagonist Ariel (Ayo Edebiri), a music writer who can’t get a single pitch through her editor (at least, without him stealing it). That changes when aging pop star [&#8230;]

## I installed a bunch of Fallout 4 mods to experience maximum coziness

date: 2025-03-19, updated: 2025-03-18, from: Polygon Website

Typing “cozy” into the Fallout 4 section of Nexus Mods doesn&#8217;t bring you as many actually cozy mods as you might think. According to modders, a custom bedroom with an American flag, something called “visible rain,” and a busty sweater are all cozy. I realize that the nuclear post-apocalypse isn&#8217;t exactly chill, but mods are [&#8230;]

## The comic book story behind Daredevil’s mystery killer

date: 2025-03-19, updated: 2025-03-17, from: Polygon Website

The funny thing about Daredevil: Born Again is that, despite sharing a name with one of the most iconic Daredevil stories ever told, it’s not based on that story at all. (In part because 2018’s third season of Netflix’s Daredevil already adapted it.)&#160; No, Daredevil: Born Again owes much more to Charles Soule’s 2015-2018 run [&#8230;]

## Best Master League teams to use in Pokémon Go

date: 2025-03-18, updated: 2025-03-18, from: Polygon Website

The Master League in Pokémon Go’s Go Battle League features the best of the best, thanks to its lack of CP cap — meaning titans of the Pokédex lock heads in heated battles, and only the very best trainers stand to reach the top of the rankings.&#160; Whether you’re looking to introduce your Pokémon to [&#8230;]

## The official Cyberpunk 2077 board game is 36% off for the first time

date: 2025-03-18, updated: 2025-03-18, from: Polygon Website

The transition from tabletop to video game, then back to tabletop, is something that few franchises have done successfully. Yet Cyberpunk has done it with relative ease. The Gangs of Night City board game from CMON borrows the setting and much of the styling of CD Projekt Red’s first-person RPG, Cyberpunk 2077, and turns it [&#8230;]

## Can Shellder be shiny in Pokémon Go?

Shellder, the water-type bivalve Pokémon from Kanto, can be found in the wild in Pokémon Go. Yes, Shellder can be shiny in Pokémon Go! Cloyster doesn’t see much use in raids, as there’s many ice- and water-type Pokémon that do significantly more damage than it. However, Cloyster does see some usage in Ultra League PvP [&#8230;]

## There will likely never be a Hunger Games sequel, says Suzanne Collins&#8217; editor

Sunrise on the Reaping, the highly-anticipated Hunger Games prequel book, comes out tomorrow. It’ll tell the story of the Second Quarter Quell, the Hunger Games that Katniss’s gruff mentor Haymitch won. Considering the success of the previous Hunger Games prequel, The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, which was all about the dark origin of despotic [&#8230;]

## Famitsu readers still yearn for Pragmata despite its indefinite delay

In the latest issue of Weekly Famitsu, a poll lists Pragmata as the magazine readership’s third most wanted game despite its indefinite delay almost two years ago.

Announced at The Mix + Kinda FunnySpring Game Showcase Monday, Atari is bringing back ’80s arcade defense game Missile Command. Titled Missile Command Delta, the new game comes from from 13AM Games and Mighty Yell and looks to be a more elaborate reimagining than we’re used to from Atari’s revivals.

## Looking back at how Nintendo pitched the original Switch

date: 2025-03-17, updated: 2025-03-17, from: Polygon Website

It’s been more than eight years since we were first introduced to the Nintendo Switch. What was once seen as a bold new concept and a reinvention of Nintendo’s console business —&#160;a move that initially spooked investors —&#160;now feels pretty normal. Widespread adoption certainly helped. Since 2017, Nintendo has sold a staggering 150 million Switch [&#8230;]

## The RTX 5080 is a great GPU that you probably can’t get right now

It’s a strange time to be reviewing an Nvidia graphics card. The company sent me a GeForce RTX 5080 a month and a half ago, and in that time, I’ve played a lot of games and watched a lot of GPU benchmark comparison videos. But also in that time, Nvidia’s longtime competitor AMD (which has [&#8230;]

## Kraven the Hunter embodies the fatal flaw of Sony’s Spider-Man Universe

After seeing Kraven the Hunter in theaters in December 2024, I couldn’t stop thinking about one detail of the movie. Kraven’s arrival on Netflix this week — its debut for the streaming audience — brought it back to the forefront of my mind.

## 10 cozy games that hide a secret twist

date: 2025-03-16, updated: 2025-03-14, from: Polygon Website

It’s nice to be cozy. I’m a huge fan of being wrapped up in a big blanket, sipping hot chocolate, and leisurely walks under colorful autumn trees. Cozy games are also great, and they’re an increasingly popular genre. While I’ve spent hours preparing the perfect farm in Stardew Valley or exploring Bahari Bay in Palia, [&#8230;]
