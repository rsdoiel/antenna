## Looking back at how Nintendo pitched the original Switch

date: 2025-03-17, updated: 2025-03-17, from: Polygon Website

It’s been more than eight years since we were first introduced to the Nintendo Switch. What was once seen as a bold new concept and a reinvention of Nintendo’s console business —&#160;a move that initially spooked investors —&#160;now feels pretty normal. Widespread adoption certainly helped. Since 2017, Nintendo has sold a staggering 150 million Switch [&#8230;]

It’s a strange time to be reviewing an Nvidia graphics card. The company sent me a GeForce RTX 5080 a month and a half ago, and in that time, I’ve played a lot of games and watched a lot of GPU benchmark comparison videos.

After seeing Kraven the Hunter in theaters in December 2024, I couldn’t stop thinking about one detail of the movie.

## 10 cozy games that hide a secret twist

date: 2025-03-16, updated: 2025-03-14, from: Polygon Website

It’s nice to be cozy. I’m a huge fan of being wrapped up in a big blanket, sipping hot chocolate, and leisurely walks under colorful autumn trees. Cozy games are also great, and they’re an increasingly popular genre. While I’ve spent hours preparing the perfect farm in Stardew Valley or exploring Bahari Bay in Palia, [&#8230;]
