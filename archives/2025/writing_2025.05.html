2024 was bit of an irregular year for me, reading-wise. As per my
notebooks, I read around 90 books (alas, less than my last year’s score
of 110 on Goodreads) – the main course obviously be­ing speculative
fiction, with a small dessert sampling of literary fiction, romances,
comics and non-fiction. The meal wasn’t entirely satisfying, as there
were plenty of anticipated titles that I didn’t get to read, and plenty

Hiromi Kawakami is one of those authors whose long and decorated career

released as <strong>The Briefcase </strong>in 2012, and then re-edited

<strong>The Man Who Saw Seconds </strong>is an action thriller that uses
an age-old trope – when a man is wronged, his family threatened, how

If there’s one writer/director whose work I’ve been consistently excited
by and whose name at festivals promises a project both heartbreakingly
raw and funny, it’s
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4323708/">Cooper
Raiff</a>. <br><br>He was a SXSW breakout in 2020 with college comedy
<span style="font-style: italic;">Shithouse</span>, which snagged him
the fest’s Grand Jury Award. And in 2022 took a step into more adult
territory with the Sundance Film Festival premiere of <span
style="font-style: italic;">Cha Cha Real Smooth</span>, which won the
<a href="https://www.vulture.com/2022/01/cha-cha-real-smooth-sundance-win-cooper-raiff-dakota-johnson.html">Audience
Award</a> in the U.S. Dramatic category.<br><br>This year, he is back at
Sundance with an episodic work,
<a href="https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/6753360063b9434588c22178" style="font-style: italic;">Hal
&amp; Harper</a>. The series follows two codependent siblings (Raiff and
Lili Reinhart) who, years after a traumatic event in their family, still
haven’t quite recovered. That pain seeps into their messy present-day
relationships, including the ones they have with their dad (Mark
Ruffalo) and his new partner (Betty Gilpin). When we get flashbacks into
their childhood, Raiff and Reinhart play their grade-school versions of
the characters, forced to mature too soon.<br><br>Raiff is always highly
involved in his projects, writing and directing as well as starring, and
he brings a singular sensibility to the work that’s a bit hard to pin
down—something about an awkward honesty, naturalistic dialogue, moments
of emotional punch that feel familiar and real.  <br><br><span
style="font-style: italic;">Hal &amp; Harper</span> is no different, but
as an episodic, the story is a bit more freewheeling, interwoven with
<a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/frame-story-flashback">past and
present threads</a> that slowly unravel the family’s
anguish.<br><br>Final Draft spoke with Raiff ahead of Sundance to learn
what was different about his approach to episodic work, his methods for
building characters that he might not fully understand in the beginning,
and how the writing comes together on set.

“<strong>Telling the Soul of Mars</strong>” by <strong>Alina Pete

explores the power and limits of language and narrative, and how the
traditions of storytelling might change and evolve with space travel. A
