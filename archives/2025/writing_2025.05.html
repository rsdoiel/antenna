Imagine suddenly being attacked by a creature that comes down from the
sky. The thing, which you can’t see well, has big teeth and powerful,
sharp talons that dig into your flesh. Now imag­ine this: That horror
isn’t the worst thing in J.S. Breukelaar’s <strong>Remedy</strong>, a
curious horror novel that explores the
