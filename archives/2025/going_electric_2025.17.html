and used the opportunity to travel to Hangzhou with ZEEKR and test drive

temporary driver’s permits in China, enabling us to test EVs like the
new 007 GT on public roads. Read on and check out my full video below

Republicans in Congress have voted to use its authority under the
Congressional Review Act to roll back California’s states’ right to
protect its own residents’ lungs and pocketbooks with better emissions
rules.

But here’s the thing: Congress doesn’t <em>have</em> that authority, and
the republican party is once again just farting in the wind with the
sole purpose of letting everyone know that it wants to poison Americans
and raise their fuel costs.

Juiced Bikes spent 15 years as a beloved e-bike brand building some of
the most iconic and highest-performance electric bicycles in the US
market. But financial troubles put the brand into a tailspin last year,
ultimately culminating in bankruptcy and closure. The brand appeared to
be a goner until two young e-bike entrepreneurs stepped up to try and
salvage Juiced’s legacy in a deal whose details have never been revealed
– until now.

<p>
Cynics will point at big rebates and claim they mean the vehicle isn’t
selling, but that just exposes them for the industry noobs that they
are. A rebate is a powerful financial tool that helps dealers overcome
obstacles like negative equity, poor credit, and down payment
requirements and get you to drive home in the car of your dreams today.
</p>
<p>
So if you’re dealing with any of the above,
<a href="https://electrek.co/guides/tariffs/">but still hope to slide
behind the wheel of a new EV before new tariffs kick in</a>, pay
attention: these EVs could get you behind the wheel of a new electric
ride sooner than you think!
</p>
<p>
<strong>UPDATE</strong>: Kia really, <em>really</em> wants you to buy a
new EV this month!
