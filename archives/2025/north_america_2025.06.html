id="paul-mccartney-rocks-the-bowery---inside-his-surprise-nyc-concert">Paul
McCartney rocks the Bowery - Inside his surprise NYC concert</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — Paul McCartney’s previous New York-area performance took
place three years ago at MetLife Stadium, capacity 82,500. His surprise
show Tuesday night at the Bowery Ballroom fit, at most, 575.</p>
<p>It was probably less than that since McCartney’s sound board and gear
— too much to fit backstage — occupied a portion of the floor space at
the venerable downtown theater. The whole thing felt like, and was, a
lark. McCartney announced the show just hours before taking the
stage.</p>
<p>Like an echo of Beatlemania, the news swept through Manhattan and
beyond earlier in the day, sending New Yorkers sprinting down Delancey
Street for a chance to snag one of the few tickets at the Bowery. Most
in attendance, including McCartney, himself, could hardly believe it was
happening.</p>
<p>“So, here we are,” McCartney said, grinning. “Some little gig. New
York. Why not?”</p>
<p>Later, before launching into “Let Me Roll It,” he added: “I can’t
quite believe we’re here, doing this. But we are here, doing this.”</p>
<p>It was not McCartney’s first impromptu concert. The Beatles famously
performed in 1969 atop the roof of their Apple Corps headquarters at 3
Savile Row in London. Since then, he’s made something of a habit of it
on trips to New York.</p>
<p>In 2009, McCartney returned to the Ed Sullivan Theater, site of the
Beatles’ famous U.S. debut, and performed above the marquee. In 2018, he
popped up in Grand Central Terminal to promote the release of his
“Egyptian Station.”</p>
<p>With temperatures in the low 30s on Tuesday, McCartney, 82, this time
opted for an intimate, indoor show. Tickets were sold only physically at
the venue, one per person. All were snapped up within about 30
minutes.</p>
<p>For those quick enough, it was like hitting the lottery.</p>
<p>Amy Jaffe, 69, was at home about 30 blocks north when she saw the
announcement on Instagram. “I thought: I can do this,” Jaffe said before
the show. “I put on jeans, grabbed a coat, called a Lyft.”</p>
<p>Jaffe has seen McCartney many times before, including with the
Beatles in 1964 in Forrest Hills, Queens. But she was still incredulous,
smiling and shaking her head: “I don’t actually believe it.”</p>
<p>Phil Sokoloff, 31, was on his way to work nearby when he saw the
news. He ran in and told his co-worker, Mat Fuller, and they rushed over
to the Bowery Ballroom.</p>
<p>“We just got lucky,” Sokoloff said. “I’m always learning about these
things the day after.”</p>
<p>McCartney took the stage roughly on time at 6:30 p.m. with his
regular band, along with a three-member horn section. They had only
rehearsed once, the day before, McCartney said. Someone shouted: “You
don’t need to rehearse!”</p>
<p>If the location was stripped down, the former Beatle didn’t come with
a minimized show, packing in a blistering tour through his entire
catalog, from Beatles classics to Wings hits. He began with “A Hard
Day’s Night” and also performed “Got To Get You Into My Life,” “Maybe
I’m Amazed,” “Lady Madonna,” “Jet,” “Get Back,” “Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da,”
“Let it Be” and “Hey Jude.”</p>
<p>“Blackbird” was a solo number on acoustic guitar, and afterward
McCartney reflected on how he wrote it for the Civil Rights Movement, a
memory that brought back his first trips to the United States.</p>
<p>“We were just kids,” McCartney said. “I’ve got grandchildren older
than that now.”</p>
<p>In the early days, he said, he and John Lennon were always writing
for the audience, and the songs were all about reaching out: “I Want to
Hold Your Hand,” “From Me to You.”</p>
<p>“It had everything to do with the fans, really,” McCartney said.</p>
<p>Before playing the Wings song “Mrs. Vanderbilt,” McCartney spoke of
playing it in front of 350,000 people in Kyiv, when Ukraine was
exuberant with a newfound freedom. “Let’s hope it gets back to that
soon,” he said.</p>
<p>Conversation, mixed with shouts from the audience, peppered the set.
After one particularly shrill scream, McCartney responded. “That was a
Beatles scream.” Then he asked for more, saying, “OK, let’s get it out
of the way. Girls, give me a Beatles scream.” All in attendance
obliged.</p>
<p>McCartney also performed the so-called last Beatles song, “Now and
Then,” a ballad penned by Lennon in the late ’70s but only released in
2023 with the help of the some of the technology used in Peter Jackson’s
2021 documentary, “The Beatles: Get Back.” The song made McCartney
wistful for his songwriting partner, whom he noted loved New York.</p>
<p>“Let’s hear it for John,” he said.</p>
<p>McCartney, who was spotted Sunday at the Super Bowl in New Orleans
chatting with Adam Sandler, was in New York for the upcoming “Saturday
Night Live” 50th anniversary festivities. He’s to be a guest on the
star-studded television special Sunday.</p>
<p>It was unclear if McCartney was playing a single show or preparing
for something more. He wrapped the Got Back Tour in December and has
said he’s hoping to finish a new album this year.</p>
<p>For now, though, it was a one-night-only event. One crowd member
asked McCartney if it could go all night. “Some of us need to get some
sleep, you know,” he replied.</p>

id="snow-and-freezing-rain-pummel-the-mid-atlantic-while-california-prepares-for-likely-flooding">Snow
and freezing rain pummel the mid-Atlantic while California prepares for
likely flooding</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Snow, sleet and freezing rain were expected to continue pummeling the
central Appalachians and mid-Atlantic states Wednesday, while California
readied for a storm that could flood areas ravaged by the recent
wildfires. </p>
<p>Especially heavy snowfall — up to nearly 25 centimeters — was
expected in parts of Virginia and West Virginia, according to the
National Weather Service. Ice accumulations could reach more than 8.4
millimeters in Stanleytown, Virginia, and 6.3 millimeters in Glendale
Springs, North Carolina. </p>
<p>In California, an atmospheric river — a long band of water vapor that
can transport moisture from the tropics to more northern areas — was
expected to move in late Wednesday, likely flooding urban areas across
central and Southern California, according to the weather service. </p>
<p>The snowstorm that blew into the mid-Atlantic states on Tuesday
caused accidents on icy roads and prompted school closures. By Tuesday
night, nearly 12,000 people in Virginia had lost power, according to
PowerOutage.us. </p>
<p>“Stay home and off the roads tonight, Virginia,” the Virginia
Department of Transportation posted on social media Tuesday night,
alongside a meme of Dorothy from “The Wizard of Oz” saying, “There’s no
place like home.” </p>
<p>In parts of Baltimore and Washington, 2.5 centimeters of snow was
falling each hour, according to the weather service. All Washington
public schools were closed Wednesday due to the weather. </p>
<p>Appalachian Power, which serves 1 million customers in West Virginia,
Virginia and Tennessee, said Tuesday it had 5,400 workers dedicated to
restoring power. </p>
<p>About 65 Virginia National Guard soldiers were at facilities along
the Interstate 95 and state Route 29 corridors and in southwest Virginia
to support the storm response, guard officials said. Another 20 soldiers
and members of the Virginia Defense Force were in support roles. </p>
<p>Winter storm warnings extended from northwest North Carolina to
southern New Jersey, and the snow-and-ice mix was expected to become all
rain by Wednesday afternoon as temperatures climb. </p>
<p>Meanwhile a separate storm system was expected to dump heavy snow on
an area stretching from Kansas to the Great Lakes starting Tuesday
night, the weather service said. The Kansas Legislature canceled
Wednesday meetings because of the weather, and Gov. Laura Kelly closed
state offices in the capital, Topeka. </p>
<p>Hundreds of accidents </p>
<p>In Virginia, where Gov. Glenn Youngkin declared a state of emergency
and schools and government offices were closed Tuesday, state police
reported 700 accidents and dozens of injuries Tuesday. Matt Demlein, a
spokesperson for the Virginia State Police, said they can’t say
definitively that all were weather related. </p>
<p>In southern West Virginia, multiple crashes temporarily shut down
several major highways Tuesday. Smith’s Towing and Truck Repair
responded to at least 15 calls, mostly from tractor-trailer drivers who
got stuck on Interstate 64 in Greenbrier County near the Virginia
border, dispatcher Kelly Pickles said. </p>
<p>“Basically, they just get sucked over into the median or they go off
of the interstate just a little bit on the right-hand side,” she said.
“And they just don’t have enough power in their vehicles to get back
onto the road, due to the icy conditions.” </p>
<p>‘Skating rinks instead of roads’ </p>
<p>Paige Williams, who owns Downtown Books in Lexington, Virginia,
closed her store Tuesday because of the weather. She hoped to reopen
Wednesday, noting that Lexington and surrounding Rockbridge County are
dependable when it comes to clearing the roads. </p>
<p>But with temperatures on either side of freezing Tuesday night and
Wednesday, the rain that is supposed to follow could make the roads
better or worse. </p>
<p>“It’s just going to depend on where those temperatures go,” Williams
said. “Rain can clear things off. And rain can also freeze. And then you
have a lot of skating rinks instead of roads.” </p>
<p>Bitter cold temperatures </p>
<p>An Arctic air mass stretched from Portland, Oregon, to the Great
Lakes. </p>
<p>The temperature bottomed out Tuesday morning at minus 35 Celsius in
Butte, Montana, where over the past two winters at least five people
died from cold exposure, said Brayton Erickson, executive director of
the Butte Rescue Mission. </p>
<p>Advocates for homeless people in the city of about 35,000 were out on
the streets distributing sleeping bags, jackets, mittens and other cold
weather gear to anyone who needed them, according to Erickson. </p>
<p>“When it gets this cold, we kind of pull out all the stops,” Erickson
said. </p>
<p>In Oregon’s Multnomah County, officials extended a state of emergency
through at least Thursday. Five emergency shelters were set to open
Tuesday night through Wednesday afternoon. Midweek wind chill readings
could dip to minus 12 Celsius in Portland, the weather service said.</p>

<h2 id="us-teacher-returns-home-after-being-freed-by-russia">US teacher
returns home after being freed by Russia</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump welcomed American teacher Marc Fogel to
the White House late Tuesday after Fogel was freed from Russia where he
had been detained since August 2021 for bringing medically prescribed
marijuana into the country.</p>
<p>“I feel like the luckiest man on Earth right now,” Fogel said as he
stood next to Trump.</p>
<p>Fogel praised the president, U.S. diplomats and lawmakers for working
to secure his release.</p>
<p>“I am in awe of what they all did,” Fogel said.</p>
<p>Trump said he appreciated what Russia did in letting Fogel go home
but declined to specify the details of any agreement with Russia beyond
calling it “very fair” and very reasonable.”</p>
<p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Wednesday that the
United States was releasing a Russian citizen from a U.S. prison as part
of the deal and that their identity would be made public once they
arrived back in Russia. </p>
<p>Trump also said another hostage release would be announced
Wednesday.</p>
<p>Mike Waltz, Trump’s national security adviser, said earlier Tuesday
the United States and Russia “negotiated an exchange” to free Fogel but
gave no details about what the U.S. side of the bargain entailed. In
such deals in recent years, the U.S. has often released Russian
prisoners that Moscow wanted in exchange.</p>
<p>Instead, Waltz cast the deal for Fogel’s release in broader
geopolitical terms, saying it was “a show of good faith from the
Russians and a sign we are moving in the right direction to end the
brutal and terrible war in Ukraine,” an invasion Russia launched against
its neighbor in February 2022, with hundreds of thousands killed or
wounded on both sides.</p>
<p>Trump had vowed to broker an end to Russia’s war on Ukraine before
taking office Jan. 20, but his aides more recently have said he hopes to
do it within the first 100 days of his new administration, roughly by
the end of April.</p>
<p>“Since President Trump’s swearing-in, he has successfully secured the
release of Americans detained around the world, and President Trump will
continue until all Americans being held are returned to the United
States,” Waltz said. The recent release of six Americans held in
Venezuela and Fogel’s freeing are the only publicly known instances.</p>
<p>Fogel had been traveling with a small amount of medically prescribed
marijuana to treat back pain. Once convicted by a Russian court, he
began serving his 14-year sentence in June 2022, with the outgoing
administration of former President Joe Biden late last year classifying
him as wrongfully detained.</p>

<h2 id="us-japan-aligned-in-peace-through-strength-to-counter-china">US,
Japan aligned in ‘peace through strength’ to counter China</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — After the meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump
and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba last week, the two nations
voiced alignment on Trump’s “peace through strength” approach toward
countering China in the Indo-Pacific region, analysts said.</p>
<p>“The prime minister and I will be working closely together to
maintain peace and security — and I also say – peace through strength
all over the Indo-Pacific,” said Trump, at a press conference after his
meeting Friday with Ishiba in Washington.</p>
<p>“We agreed to cooperate even more closely to combat the Chinese
economic aggression, which is quite aggressive,” Trump said.</p>
<p>Ishiba said: “Further strengthening the strong and unwavering
Japan-U.S. alliance to achieving a free and open Indo-Pacific” is key
“to advance the national interests of both of our countries in synergy
and to realize peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific.”</p>
<p>Analysts say the first official meeting between Trump and Ishiba
succeeded in striking agreements on what both leaders consider crucial:
combating China’s aggression and strengthening their national
interests.</p>
<p>Security commitment</p>
<p>Ishiba continued to forge close ties with the U.S. to maintain
multilateral alliance security cooperation close to home in the
Indo-Pacific, while Trump secured Japanese investments and
purchases.</p>
<p>Taken together, analysts say, Ishiba is aligned with Trump’s vision
of making the U.S. strong at home in his “America First” approach as a
prerequisite for maintaining peace through strength in the Indo-Pacific,
a region crucial to Japan’s defense.</p>
<p>“The U.S.-Japan leaders’ communiqué went a long way to reaffirm
Trump’s peace through strength approach to the Indo-Pacific,” said
Kenneth Weinstein, the Japan chair at Hudson Institute.</p>
<p>“The U.S.-Japan leaders’ communiqué, which President Trump signed off
on, highlighted the importance of multilateral networks in the
Indo-Pacific,” Weinstein told VOA on Sunday.</p>
<p>“The two leaders intend to advance multilayered and aligned
cooperation” with the Quad security dialogue and three separate
trilateral ties with South Korea, Australia and the Philippines “to
realize a free and open Indo-Pacific,” Trump and Ishiba said in a joint
statement.</p>
<p>There were concerns by some that Trump would not support alliance
security formations aimed at maintaining peace and security in the
region.</p>
<p>“A big concern on the part of the Japanese” was whether the Biden
administration’s emphasis “on the centrality of alliance” or the
“so-called multilayered structures” or “mini laterals” would continue,
said Daniel Sneider, a lecturer in East Asian Studies at Stanford
University.</p>
<p>Sneider told VOA on Monday, “It was reassuring for the Japanese and
for those in the U.S. who are worried whether those types of policies
would have continuity that there was at least a written affirmation of
those things in the joint statement.”</p>
<p>In their joint statement, Trump and Ishiba also expressed “strong
opposition” to China’s attempts to change the status quo in the East
China Sea and its unlawful maritime claims in the South China Sea.</p>
<p>They also expressed support for Taiwan’s “meaningful participation in
international organizations” and opposed China’s efforts to disturb
stability across the Taiwan Strait.</p>
<p>At a press briefing held in Beijing on Monday, Chinese Foreign
Ministry Spokesperson Guo Jiakun, said, “The part of the U.S.-Japan
joint statement on China constitutes open interference in China’s
domestic affairs and an attack and smear against China, which is also
aimed at scaremongering in the region.”</p>
<p>Increased investment</p>
<p>Trump announced at the press conference that Japan will invest $1
trillion in the U.S., participate in the Alaska LNG project, and invest
in, rather than buy, U.S. Steel.</p>
<p>In one of the first executive orders Trump signed on Jan. 20, he made
Alaskan natural resources open to development and production and its
liquefied natural gas available for sale to U.S. allied nations within
the Pacific region.</p>
<p>Ishiba said, “An unprecedented investment” from Japan to the U.S. and
the Japanese investments in U.S. Steel are “mutually beneficial” and
“contribute not only to the United States and Japan but also to the
whole world.”  </p>
<p>Weinstein, at Hudson, said, “The announcement of a trillion dollars
in foreign investment in the U.S. was the landmark moment, as was the
announcement of the investments in the LNG sector” and “the pending U.S.
Steel investment.”</p>
<p>“Ishiba is supporting what is in Japan’s best interest: an alliance
with minimal distance between the U.S. and Japan,” he said. “So he
understands he needs to back the America First approach to continue
alignment with the Trump administration. A strong America is the best
guarantee for global peace and stability.”</p>
<p>In explaining what foreign policy would look like under the Trump
administration, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, during his confirmation
hearing in January, emphasized “a foreign policy centered on our
national interest” and making the U.S. strong first at home as the
prerequisite for maintaining peace and security around the world.</p>
<p>“Ishiba respects Trump’s America First” policy, but he is also a
“Japan first” prime minister, said Yuki Tatsumi, director of the Japan
Program at the Stimson Center.</p>
<p>She told VOA on Friday that “both leaders gained. Trump got a
commitment of increased investment by Japan in the U.S., while Ishiba
gained Trump’s articulation of the U.S. commitment to the defense of
Japanese territory, including the Senkaku Islands, and the joint
statement in which U.S.-Japan support for Taiwan was articulated.”</p>
<p>In the joint statement, Ishiba and Trump underscored the United
States’ “unwavering commitment” to defending Japan using its full range
of capabilities, including nuclear capabilities. The two also
“reiterated their strong opposition to any action that seeks to
undermine Japan’s long and peaceful administration of the Senkaku
Islands.”</p>
<p>There is “continuity” from the Biden administration to the Trump
administration, Tatsumi said, and that is to make U.S.-Japan ties “the
hub of alliance cooperation and partnership across the
Indo-Pacific.”</p>

schnauzer named Monty wins top prize at Westminster Kennel Club</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — A giant schnauzer named Monty won the top prize at the
Westminster Kennel Club dog show Tuesday night.</p>
<p>Monty bested six other finalists to take best in show at Madison
Square Garden. The award is considered the most prestigious prize in the
U.S. dog show world.</p>

<p>Other finalists included a bichon frisé called Neal, a Skye terrier
named Archer, a whippet and repeat runner-up known as Bourbon, a shih
tzu called Comet who’s been a finalist before, a German shepherd named
Mercedes, who came in second last year, and an English springer spaniel
called Freddie.</p>
<p>Monty made the finals for a third year in a row and won the huge
American Kennel Club’s big show in December.</p>
<p>A Westminster win is considered the most prestigious award in the

<p>Winners get a trophy, ribbons and bragging rights, but no cash
prize.</p>
<p>Every dog at Westminster is a titled champion, but they also are
household pets. Some also do therapy work, search-and-rescue or other
canine jobs.</p>
<p>“A good German shepherd is an all-purpose dog,” said co-breeder and
co-owner Sheree Moses Combs of Wardensville, West Virginia. Some of her
pups have become service dogs for wounded veterans, she said.</p>
<p>“Dog shows are fun, but that is what our breed is all about,” she
said.</p>
<p>Big dogs had their day at Westminster on Tuesday, when “working”
breeds had their turns in the ring. First-round competitor Brina, for
instance, is a 71.6 kilogram Neapolitan mastiff.</p>
<p>“I’ve been struck by this breed since I was 12. … They’re so unique,”
owner Yves Belmont, Ph.D., said as Brina napped in her crate, equipped
with a 7.5-liter water bucket.</p>
<p>With their size, jowly heads and guard-dog history, the breed was
developed to be imposing. But Belmont, who currently has several of them
at his family’s Atlanta-area home, said he also is impressed by their
intelligence.</p>
<p>A trip to Westminster is a reminder of dogs’ variety, even just among
purebreds. The same day Brina competed, Tyra the miniature bull terrier
also strutted her stuff. Formally called GCH CH Rnr’s Top Model, she’s
named after fashion model Tyra Banks.</p>
<p>The hardy terrier breed is “a big dog in a small package, but they
always keep you smiling,” said owner and co-breeder Jessica Harrison of
Austin, Texas. Asked where the 2-year-old Tyra falls on the mischief
meter, Harrison smiled, “like a nine, for sure.”</p>
<p>“You can’t be upset with them because they’re just so cute,” she said
as Tyra rolled on her back to get a belly rub from a passerby at the
Javits Center, the convention venue that hosted the first-round judging
of each breed.</p>
<p>Regardless which dog gets the trophy at Westminster, others also have
scored points with the crowd.</p>
<p>During two nights of semifinals, spectators shouted out breeds and
names of canine competitors as if they played for one of the pro teams
that call the Garden home, the NBA’s New York Knicks and NHL’s New York
Rangers.</p>
<p>“Love you, Lumpy!” someone yelled to a Pekingese named Lumpy, who
earned laughs for his ambling gait.</p>
<p>The arena erupted with cheers for a golden retriever named Tuffy, a
representative of a popular breed that has never won. Calaco, a
Xoloitzcuintli, got huge applause for a confident performance that also
earned him some recognition from the judge. Xoloitzcuintlis, are
hairless dogs with deep roots in Mexico.</p>
<p>A Doberman pinscher called Penny got whoops of approval from
spectators, too. Despite her dignified, focused appearance, Penny can be
“a mush,” breeder and co-owner Theresa Connors-Chan of Ontario, Canada,
said earlier in the day.</p>
<p>Westminster also featured agility and obedience championships, held
Saturday. The agility prize went to a border collie named Vanish, and an
Australian shepherd called Willie triumphed in obedience.</p>

House fires USAID inspector general after funding oversight warning,
officials say</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The White House fired the inspector general for the U.S.
Agency for International Development on Tuesday, several U.S. officials
said. The dismissal comes a day after his office warned that the Trump
administration’s dismantling of USAID had made it all but impossible to
monitor $8.2 billion in unspent humanitarian funds. </p>
<p>The White House gave no reason for the firing of Inspector General
Paul Martin, one of the officials said. The dismissal was first reported
by CNN. The officials were not authorized to comment publicly and spoke
on condition of anonymity. </p>
<p>Inspectors general are typically independently funded watchdogs
tasked with rooting out waste, fraud and abuse at government agencies.
The Trump administration earlier purged more than a dozen inspectors
general. </p>
<p>On Monday, Martin’s office issued a flash report warning that the
Trump administration’s funding freeze and staff actions within USAID had
left oversight of the humanitarian aid “largely nonoperational.” </p>
<p>That includes the agency’s greatly reduced ability to ensure none of
the $8.2 billion in unspent unhumanitarian funds falls into the hands of
violent extremist groups or goes astray in conflict zones, the watchdog
said. </p>
<p>Multiparty lawsuit </p>
<p>Separately, a lawsuit filed Tuesday alleged that the Trump
administration’s fast-paced dismantling of USAID is stiffing American
businesses on hundreds of millions of dollars in unpaid bills for work
that has already been done. </p>
<p>The administration’s abrupt freeze on foreign aid also is forcing
mass layoffs by U.S. suppliers and contractors for USAID, including 750
furloughs at one company, Washington-based Chemonics International, the
lawsuit says. </p>
<p>“One cannot overstate the impact of that unlawful course of conduct:
on businesses large and small forced to shut down their programs and let
employees go; on hungry children across the globe who will go without;
on populations around the world facing deadly disease; and on our
constitutional order,” the U.S. businesses and organizations said. </p>
<p>An organization representing 170 small U.S. businesses, major
suppliers, an American Jewish group aiding displaced people abroad, the
American Bar Association and others joined the court challenge. </p>
<p>It was filed in U.S. District Court in Washington against President
Donald Trump; Secretary of State Marco Rubio; acting USAID Deputy
Administrator Peter Marocco, a Trump appointee who has been a central
figure in hollowing out the agency; and Russell Vought, Trump’s head of
the Office of Management and Budget. </p>
<p>Marocco defended the funding cutoff and push to put all but a
fraction of USAID staff on leave in an affidavit filed late Monday in
the lawsuit brought by the workers’ groups. </p>
<p>“Insubordination” and “noncompliance” by USAID staffers made it
necessary to stop funding and operations by the agency to allow the
administration to carry out a program-by-program review to decide which
U.S. aid programs could resume overseas, Marocco wrote. </p>
<p>It is at least the third lawsuit over the administration’s rapid
unraveling of the U.S. aid and development agency and its programs
worldwide. Trump and ally Elon Musk have targeted USAID in particular,
saying its work is out of line with Trump’s agenda. </p>
<p>Marocco, Musk and Rubio have overseen an across-the-board freeze on
foreign assistance and an agency shutdown under a January 20 executive
order by Trump. A lawsuit brought by federal employees associations has
temporarily blocked the administration from pulling thousands of USAID
staffers off the job. The funding freeze and other measures have
persisted, including the agency losing the lease on its Washington
headquarters. </p>
<p>Interceding for farmers </p>
<p>The new administration terminated contracts without the required
30-day notice and without back payments for work that was already done,
according to a U.S. official, a businessperson with a USAID contract and
an email seen by The Associated Press. They spoke on condition of
anonymity for fear of reprisal by the Trump administration. </p>
<p>For Chemonics, one of the larger of the USAID partners, the funding
freeze has meant $103 million in unpaid invoices and almost $500 million
in USAID-ordered medication, food and other goods stalled in the supply
chain or ports, the lawsuit says. </p>
<p>For the health commodities alone, not delivering them “on time could
potentially lead to as many as 566,000 deaths from HIV/AIDS, malaria,
and unmet reproductive health needs, including 215,000 pediatric
deaths,” the lawsuit says. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, seven Republican lawmakers from farm states introduced
legislation to safeguard a long-running $1.8 billion food-aid program
run by the aid agency, by moving the Food for Peace program under the
Department of Agriculture. </p>
<p>Farmers, a politically important bloc for the Trump administration,
have been affected by the administration’s funding freeze as well.
Kansas Republican Senator Jerry Moran, who announced the legislation,
over the weekend thanked Rubio for interceding to allow delivery of $560
million in U.S.-grown commodities intended for hunger programs worldwide
but stuck in ports because of the administration’s abrupt cutoff of
foreign assistance spending.</p>

York health department confirms first case of new mpox strain</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The New York State Department of Health on Tuesday confirmed its
first case of the new mpox strain, adding to the global concerns over
the spread of the little-known variant.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
there were three confirmed cases in the country — in California, Georgia
and New Hampshire — caused by the clade Ib strain. The agency said the
three cases were not linked.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization declared mpox a global public health
emergency for the second time in two years in August, following an
outbreak of the viral infection in the Democratic Republic of Congo that
has spread to neighboring countries.</p>
<p>The New York State Department of Health declined to provide further
information on the case.</p>

<h2 id="doge-cuts-900m-from-agency-tracking-us-students-progress">DOGE
cuts $900M from agency tracking US students’ progress</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — A federal research agency that tracks the progress of
America’s students is to lose $900 million in funding after Elon Musk’s
Department of Government Efficiency found no need for much of its
work. </p>
<p>It’s unclear to what degree the Education Department’s Institute of
Education Sciences will continue to exist after Musk’s team slashed
scores of contracts. Industry groups said at least 169 contracts were
suddenly terminated Monday, accounting for much of the institute’s
work. </p>
<p>The Education Department did not immediately share details on the
cuts. Madison Biedermann, an agency spokesperson, said the action will
not affect the institute’s primary work, including the NAEP assessment,
known as the nation’s report card, and the College Scorecard, a database
of university costs and outcomes. </p>
<p>Musk’s grip on the Education Department was dealt a setback Tuesday
when the agency temporarily blocked DOGE workers from more than a dozen
internal systems containing sensitive information. As part of a lawsuit
challenging its access, the department agreed to block Musk’s team until
at least Monday while a judge weighs a broader pause. </p>
<p>Advocates sound alarm</p>
<p>The cuts to the institute raised alarm among advocates who said it
could hurt the accountability of America’s education system, leaving the
nation in the dark on schools’ effectiveness. Historically, achievement
gaps have shown low-income students and students of color falling behind
their peers. </p>
<p>The cuts are counterproductive and destructive, said Rachel Dinkes,
president and CEO of the Knowledge Alliance, a coalition of education
research firms. “Cutting out at the knees the one independent agency
that helps improve student outcomes is ridiculous,” Dinkes said. </p>
<p>Biedermann declined to share the names of vendors whose contracts
were cut. </p>
<p>Cuts under contract clause </p>
<p>The Institute of Education Sciences is a central source of
information on the health of America’s education system. Across the
country, it tracks student progress over time and across demographics.
It evaluates the effectiveness of federal programs, and colleges and
schools rely on its research to improve student outcomes. </p>
<p>The cuts appear to have been carried out under a clause allowing IES
to end contracts at any time “for the government’s convenience,”
according to notices obtained by The Associated Press. </p>
<p>Among the projects being cut is a study exploring how to accelerate
math learning for students in fourth and fifth grade, according to a
document obtained by the AP. Known as ReSolve, the project was being led
by research group MDRC. </p>
<p>Last month, IES released the latest NAEP results, revealing that
America’s children have continued to lose ground on reading skills and
made little improvement in math in the wake of the COVID-19
pandemic. </p>
<p>Activate Research, a small business, lost four contracts and plans to
lay off at least 20 of its 28 workers. The company was hired to ensure
accuracy and objectivity in reports. When founder Dinah Sparks announced
the company was winding down Tuesday, she had a message for her team:
“We are not waste,” she said. “We did valuable work for the U.S.
taxpayer.” </p>
<p>Another small business lost multiple contracts after being hired to
collect basic information on the nation’s schools. The company started
laying off workers this week, according to an employee who spoke on the
condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. </p>
<p>Congress gave the institute about $800 million last year, roughly 1%
of the Education Department’s annual budget. </p>
<p>Associations call to reinstate contracts </p>
<p>Two prominent research associations jointly called for the contracts
to be reinstated, saying much of IES’ work is mandated by Congress and
relies on contracts to support its limited staff. The groups said 169
contracts had been cut, curbing the institute’s ability to report data
on school finances and student outcomes. </p>
<p>The institute oversees a wide range of work, including the
administration of the NAEP exam and U.S. participation in PISA, an
assessment that compares academic progress across nations. It’s also a
major funder of education research and keeps a database of research that
has shown results in improving education. </p>
<p>IES shines a light on inequity, and its work is “more than just
numbers and statistics,” said the Education Trust, a nonprofit research
and advocacy group. “Without it, we are left in the dark, unable to see
where educational gaps exist or how to close them,” the group said in a
statement. </p>
<p>Mark Schneider, a former IES commissioner appointed by President
Donald Trump in 2018, said the cuts give the new administration a chance
to rethink programs that have changed little in decades.  </p>
<p>“The question is not what happened on Monday; it’s what happens
next,” Schneider said. “If we just swing this sledgehammer, break all
this stuff and say, ‘OK, done,’ then we’ve wasted an opportunity to fix
things.” </p>
<p>Democratic Senator Patty Murray, a former teacher and member of the
Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, said she will be
“sounding the alarm” to fight the cuts. </p>
<p>Trump has promised to abolish the Education Department and turn its
power over to states and schools. The White House is considering an
order that would direct Trump’s education chief to dismantle the agency
as far as possible while calling on Congress to fully shut it down. </p>
<p>It’s unclear how far Trump could act on his own to slash the
department’s spending, much of which is ordered by Congress.</p>

id="first-us-navy-ships-sail-through-taiwan-strait-since-trump-inauguration">First
US Navy ships sail through Taiwan Strait since Trump inauguration</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BEIJING/TEIPEI — Two U.S. Navy ships sailed through the sensitive
Taiwan Strait this week in the first such mission since President Donald
Trump took office last month, drawing an angry reaction from China,
which said the mission increased security risks.</p>
<p>The U.S. Navy, occasionally accompanied by ships from allied
countries, transits the strait about once a month. China, which claims
Taiwan as its own territory, says the strategic waterway belongs to
it.</p>
<p>The U.S. Navy said the vessels were the Arleigh Burke-class
guided-missile destroyer USS Ralph Johnson and Pathfinder-class survey
ship, USNS Bowditch. The ships carried out a north-to-south transit
Feb. 10-12, it said.</p>
<p>“The transit occurred through a corridor in the Taiwan Strait that is
beyond any coastal state’s territorial seas,” said Navy Commander
Matthew Comer, a spokesperson at the U.S. military’s Indo-Pacific
Command. “Within this corridor all nations enjoy high-seas freedom of
navigation, overflight, and other internationally lawful uses of the sea
related to these freedoms.”</p>
<p>China’s military said that Chinese forces had been dispatched to keep
watch.</p>
<p>“The U.S. action sends the wrong signals and increases security
risks,” the Eastern Theatre Command of the People’s Liberation Army said
in a statement early Wednesday.</p>
<p>China considers Taiwan its most important diplomatic issue and it is
regularly a stumbling block in Sino-U.S. relations.</p>
<p>China this week complained to Japan over “negative” references to
China in a statement issued after a meeting between Trump and Japanese
Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.</p>
<p>That statement called for “maintaining peace and stability across the
Taiwan Strait,” and voiced support for “Taiwan’s meaningful
participation in international organizations.”</p>
<p>Asked in Beijing on Wednesday about the U.S. warships, Zhu Fenglian,
spokesperson for China’s Taiwan Affairs Office, said that Taiwan was a
“core interest” for the country and that the United States should act
with caution.</p>
<p>“We are resolutely opposed to this and will never allow any outside
interference, and have the firm will, full confidence and capability to
uphold the country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,” she
said.</p>
<p>Taiwan’s defense ministry said its forces had also kept watch but
noted the “situation was as normal.”</p>
<p>China’s military operates daily in the strait as part of what
Taiwan’s government views as part of Beijing’s pressure campaign.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Taiwan’s defense ministry said that it had detected 30
Chinese military aircraft and seven navy ships operating around the
island in the previous 24 hour period.</p>
<p>“I really don’t need to explain further who is the so-called
troublemaker around the Taiwan Strait. All other countries in the
neighborhood have a deep appreciation of this,” ministry spokesperson
Sun Li-fang told reporters in Taipei.</p>
<p>Chinese state television said on Wednesday that since Lunar New
Year’s Eve on January 28, the Eastern Theatre Command had repeatedly
dispatched sea and air forces to carry out “combat readiness” patrols
and training missions around Taiwan.</p>
<p>China’s operations aim to “guard the joy and peace of the people on
both sides of the Taiwan Strait,” the report said.</p>
<p>The last publicly acknowledged U.S. Navy mission in the strait was in
late November, when a P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft flew over
the waterway.</p>
<p>The last time a U.S. Navy ship was confirmed to have sailed through
the strait was in October, a joint mission with a Canadian warship.</p>
<p>Taiwan President Lai Ching-te rejects Beijing’s sovereignty claims,
saying only Taiwan’s people can decide their future.</p>

id="appeals-court-rejects-push-to-reinstate-spending-freezes-on-grants-loans">Appeals
court rejects push to reinstate spending freezes on grants, loans</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — A federal appeals court on Tuesday rejected a Trump
administration push to reinstate a sweeping pause on federal funding, a
decision that comes after a judge found the administration had not fully
obeyed an earlier order.</p>
<p>The Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals turned back the
emergency appeal, though it said it expected the lower court judge to
act quickly to clarify.</p>
<p>The Justice Department had asked the appeals court to let it
implement sweeping pauses on federal grants and loans, calling the lower
court order to keep promised money flowing “intolerable judicial
overreach.”</p>
<p>That ruling came from U.S. District Court Judge John McConnell in
Rhode Island, the first judge to find that the administration had
disobeyed a court order.</p>
<p>He is presiding over a lawsuit from nearly two dozen Democratic
states filed after the administration issued a boundary-pushing memo
purporting to halt all federals grants and loans, worth trillions of
dollars. The plan sparked chaos around the country.</p>
<p>The administration has since rescinded that memo, but McConnell found
Monday that not all federal grants and loans had been restored.</p>
<p>Money for things like early childhood education, pollution reduction
and HIV prevention research has remained tied up even after his Jan. 31
order halting the spending freeze plan, the states said.</p>
<p>McConnell, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama,
ordered the Trump administration to “immediately take every step
necessary” to unfreeze all federal grants and loans.</p>
<p>He also said his order blocked the administration from cutting
billions of dollars in grant funding from the National Institutes of
Health, a move announced last week.</p>
<p>The Justice Department said McConnell’s order prevents the executive
branch from exercising its lawful authority, including over
discretionary spending or fraud.</p>
<p>“A single district court judge has attempted to wrest from the
President the power to ‘take care that the laws be faithfully executed.’
This state of affairs cannot be allowed to persist for one more day,”
government attorneys wrote in their appeal.</p>
<p>The states, meanwhile, argued that the president can’t block money
that Congress has approved, and the still-frozen grants and loans are
causing serious problems for their residents. They urged the appeals
court to keep allowing the case to play out in front of McConnell.</p>
<p>The court battle is unfolding as a string of court losses is
increasingly frustrating top administration officials by slowing
President Donald Trump’s wide-ranging agenda .</p>
<p>Judges have also blocked, at least temporarily, Trump’s push to end
birthright citizenship for anyone born in the U.S., access to Treasury
Department records by billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government
Efficiency and a mass deferred resignation plan for federal workers.</p>
<p>The Republican administration previously said the sweeping funding
pause would bring federal spending in line with the president’s
priorities, including increasing fossil fuel production, removing
protections for transgender people and ending diversity, equity and
inclusion efforts.</p>
<p>A different federal judge in Washington has also issued a temporary
restraining order against the funding freeze plan and since expressed
concern that some nonprofit groups weren’t getting their funding.</p>

<h2 id="vance-stakes-claim-to-us-leadership-in-ai">Vance stakes claim to
US leadership in AI</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance on Tuesday vowed that the United
States would maintain its leadership position in the development of
advanced artificial intelligence and warned leaders of other countries
not to adopt regulatory standards that might “kill” the new technology
“just as it’s taking off.” </p>
<p>“The United States of America is the leader in AI, and our
administration plans to keep it that way,” Vance told an audience of
world leaders at an AI summit in Paris. He said the administration of
President Donald Trump “will ensure that the most powerful AI systems
are built in the U.S. with American-designed and manufactured
chips.” </p>
<p>Vance said that the U.S. is open to collaboration with its allies.
“But,” he said, “to create that kind of trust, we need international
regulatory regimes that foster the creation of AI technology rather than
strangles it, and we need our European friends in particular to look to
this new frontier with optimism rather than trepidation.” </p>
<p>Regulations criticized </p>
<p>The vice president criticized the European Union’s regulatory
structure, in particular the privacy-focused General Data Protection
Regulation and the misinformation-focused Digital Services Act, and he
said the Trump administration will not accept foreign governments
“tightening the screws on U.S. tech companies with international
footprints.” </p>
<p>Vance also appeared to criticize the effort in Europe to replace
power generated by burning fossil fuels with more sustainable sources,
saying that countries are “chasing reliable power out of their nations”
at a time when AI systems demand ever-greater access to
electricity. </p>
<p>“The AI future is not going to be won by handwringing about safety,”
Vance said. “It will be won by building — from reliable power plants to
the manufacturing facilities that can produce the chips of the
future.” </p>
<p>While dozens of countries in attendance at the summit signed a joint
declaration on “building trustworthy data governance frameworks to
encourage development of innovative and privacy-protective AI,” the U.S.
and U.K. did not. </p>
<p>More calls for reduced regulation </p>
<p>Although not as dismissive of regulations and safety concerns as Vice
President Vance, other leaders at the summit appeared to agree that the
regulatory burden on companies in the AI field should be lightened. </p>
<p>French President Emmanuel Macron, the summit’s host, said that while
safety concerns are important, Europe also needs to make it easier for
AI firms there to move quickly and innovate at the same pace as other
countries. </p>
<p>“At the national and European scale, it is very clear that we have to
resynchronize with the rest of the world,” Macron said. </p>
<p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen defended the
bloc’s privacy regulations and other standards, pointing out that they
are meant to help businesses by creating rules that apply uniformly
across all 27 member countries. </p>
<p>“At the same time, I know that we have to make it easier, and we have
to cut red tape — and we will,” von der Leyen said. </p>
<p>Veiled China comments </p>
<p>Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing, who also attended the summit,
said Beijing is prepared to work with other countries to develop AI
technology, and it is willing to share its discoveries in the field with
the aim of creating “a community with a shared future for mankind.” </p>
<p>In his remarks on Tuesday, Vance did not mention China by name but
appeared to warn other nations against engaging in the kind of
collaboration that Zhang described. </p>
<p>Vance spoke of “hostile foreign adversaries” that “have weaponized AI
software to rewrite history, surveil users and censor speech” and
authoritarian regimes that have “stolen and used AI to strengthen their
military intelligence and surveillance capabilities to capture foreign
data and create propaganda to undermine other nations national
security.” </p>
<p>Partnering with authoritarian regimes, Vance said, “means chaining
your nation to an authoritarian master that seeks to infiltrate, dig in
and seize your information infrastructure.” </p>
<p>The remarks came at a time when the U.S. is taking wide-ranging
action to prevent China from gaining access to the most cutting-edge AI
technologies. Recent news reports revealing that a seemingly innovative
Chinese AI chatbot known as DeepSeek has been collecting user data and
storing it on insecure servers in China has led several nations to
restrict access to the service. </p>
<p>On Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Gou Jiakun said in a
press conference: “We take the safety and security of AI seriously, and
support entrepreneurial innovation by Chinese companies, thus
contributing China’s part to global AI development.” </p>
<p>“We have helped developing countries enhance capacity building,
advocating that AI technologies should be open-sourced and there should
be greater accessibility to AI services so that the benefits of AI can
be shared by all countries. That said, we are against drawing lines
along ideological difference, overstretching the concept of national
security, or politicizing trade and tech issues,” Gou said.  </p>
<p>Tech researchers concerned </p>
<p>Vance’s remarks about excessive AI safety concerns were in sync with
actions taken so far by the Trump administration. On the day he took
office, President Trump rescinded an executive order signed by his
predecessor entitled, “Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use
of Artificial Intelligence.” </p>
<p>Following Vance’s remarks Tuesday, U.S.-based artificial intelligence
researchers warned that a world in which the U.S. declines to require
companies to adopt AI safety precautions could make collaboration with
colleagues in countries with stronger protections difficult. </p>
<p>“In order to build effective AI, you have to source data globally, so
you have more accurate, complete and representative data sets,” Susan
Ariel Aaronson told VOA. She is a professor at George Washington
University and co-leader of the National Science Foundation’s
Trustworthy AI Institute for Law and Society. </p>
<p>“Many AI researchers believe we’re running out of data,” Aaronson
said. “The future for these firms, the future [for these] markets are
overseas, and so we need rules to govern how we interact with
policymakers and users in those markets.”  </p>
<p>Mona Sloane, a professor at the University of Virginia who leads an
AI research lab, told VOA that maintaining access to those data sets is
a prevailing concern. </p>
<p>“If you talk to people in the research community in the United
States, those folks are acutely worried about access to data sets, about
collaborating [internationally] on AI questions, or using AI in their
research,” she said. </p>
<p>“There will be very severe implications for research in the United
States on AI — but also with AI — by getting cut off from these
international conversations,” Sloane said.</p>

pauses enforcement, orders review of foreign corruption act</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has ordered a pause and review of
a law that has defined the activities of U.S. business overseas for
nearly five decades, claiming that the strict prohibitions against
bribing foreign officials strangle American competitiveness in a tough
global market.  </p>
<p>“It’s going to mean a lot more business for America,” Trump said as
he signed the order on Monday for the Department of Justice to pause
ongoing investigations and review the 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
for the next six months.  </p>
<p>The order argues that “overexpansive and unpredictable FCPA
enforcement against American citizens and businesses — by our own
Government — for routine business practices in other nations not only
wastes limited prosecutorial resources that could be dedicated to
preserving American freedoms, but actively harms American economic
competitiveness and, therefore, national security.” </p>
<p>But the latest annual review of the law’s enforcement by Stanford Law
School says the number of enforcement actions in 2024 were “well below
the ten-year average of 36,” with 26 cases that year filed by the two
entities responsible for enforcement — the DOJ and the Securities and
Exchange Commission.  </p>
<p>“This decline suggests that each bribery scheme yielded more unique
actions against a corporation and its subsidiaries, employees, and
agents, but that fewer separate schemes were targeted for enforcement in
2024,” the report concluded.  </p>
<p>The president’s order garnered criticism from anti-corruption
advocates.  </p>
<p>“The world must not default to where bribery and corruption are the
norm,” Gary Kalman, executive director of Transparency International
U.S., said in a statement to VOA. “A race to the bottom harms both the
citizens in the country and the businesses involved in corrupt
transactions. Those who do choose to flout the law often face multiple
bribery demands that delay or prevent these businesses from obtaining
the licenses and permits they need to enter overseas markets. In the
end, bribery is a lose-lose proposition.” </p>
<p>Bribery is still illegal  </p>
<p>Private legal experts rushed Tuesday to clarify the order’s scope and
significance.  </p>
<p>“Bribery is still Illegal,” according to the headline of the analysis
issued Tuesday morning by Washington-based multinational law firm Arnold
&amp; Porter. </p>
<p>The eight lawyer-authors go on to say in their analysis that not only
does bribery remain illegal under the law, which has not been repealed
by Congress, but also under various state, federal and foreign laws.
They also note that other countries have boosted their enforcement of
anti-corruption laws.  </p>
<p>“For now, we recommend that companies wait and see what will happen,
and meanwhile continue to focus on compliance,” the lawyers concluded.
 </p>
<p>Democratic Representative Jamie Raskin, a constitutional lawyer, said
Tuesday that the new order “puts America on the side of ‘routine’
corrupt business practices all over the world.” The order, he said,
gives corporations “free rein to pay bribes, kickbacks, and financial
tribute to corrupt foreign officials.” </p>
<p>His statement also took aim at Elon Musk, the billionaire businessman
whose closeness to Trump has put him at the head of efforts to radically
reshape the U.S. government and target waste, fraud and corruption
through his Department of Government Efficiency.  </p>
<p>“The Trump-Musk Administration is making bribery and corruption
perfectly legal again,” Raskin wrote in a statement. “The prices of eggs
and other groceries, housing and rent and electricity continue to soar,
but it just became a lot cheaper to engage in political corruption.”
 </p>
<p>Musk and his companies have tangled publicly with the SEC and the
Department of Commerce, but neither his name nor those of any of the
businesses he is associated with appears on either’s complete list of
FCPA enforcement actions.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
</p>
<p>
If President Donald Trump goes through with his plan to levy sweeping
tariffs on foreign imports, it wouldn’t be the first time the U.S. has
done such a thing. Ever heard of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930?
Anyone? Those tariffs are widely credited with sinking the United States
deeper into the Great Depression. And although global trade looks
different nowadays, they can teach us a lot about how Trump’s
protectionist approach to global trade could play out. On the show
today, Inu Manak, a fellow for trade policy at the Council on Foreign
Relations, explains how the Smoot-Hawley tariff debacle can shed light
on the current moment, why the president has the power to wield tariffs
in the first place, and how punishing trading partners could leave the
U.S. economy at a disadvantage. Plus, what this fight has to do with the
1980s film “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off” and Roomba vacuum cleaners!

id="trump-signs-executive-order-to-continue-downsizing-federal-workforce">Trump
signs executive order to continue downsizing federal workforce</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump made a rare appearance with Elon
Musk, his most powerful adviser, in the Oval Office on Tuesday before
signing an executive order to continue downsizing the federal
workforce.</p>
<p>The Associated Press reviewed a White House fact sheet on the order,
which is intended to advance Musk’s work slashing spending with his
Department of Government Efficiency.</p>
<p>Musk said there are some good people in the federal bureaucracy, but
they need to be accountable and called it an “unelected” fourth
branch.</p>
<p>“The people voted for major government reform, and that’s what the
people are going to get,” he said. “That’s what democracy is all
about.”</p>
<p>It was Musk’s first time taking questions from reporters since he
joined the Trump administration as a special government employee with
sprawling influence over federal agencies. He’s also the world’s richest
person and the owner of X, the social media platform formerly known as
Twitter.</p>
<p>Despite concerns that he’s amassing unaccountable power with little
transparency, Musk described himself as an open book. He joked that the
scrutiny was like a “daily proctology exam.”</p>
<p>The White House fact sheet said that “agencies will undertake plans
for large-scale reductions in force and determine which agency
components (or agencies themselves) may be eliminated or combined
because their functions aren’t required by law.”</p>
<p>It also said that agencies should “hire no more than one employee for
every four employees that depart from federal service.” There are plans
for exceptions when it comes to immigration, law enforcement and public
safety.</p>
<p>Trump and Musk are pushing federal workers to resign in return for
financial incentives, although their plan is currently on hold while a
judge reviews its legality. The deferred resignation program, commonly
described as a buyout, would allow employees to quit and still get paid
until Sept. 30. Administration officials said more than 65,000 workers
have taken the offer.</p>
<p>Hundreds of people gathered for a rally Tuesday across the street
from the U.S. Capitol in support of federal workers.</p>
<p>Janet Connelly, a graphic designer with the Department of Energy,
said she’s fed up with emails from the Office of Personnel Management
encouraging people to take the deferred resignation program.</p>
<p>She tried to use her spam settings to filter out the emails but to no
avail. Connelly said she has no plans to take the offer.</p>
<p>“From the get-go, I didn’t trust it,” she said.</p>
<p>Connelly said she thinks of her work as trying to do an important
service for the American public.</p>
<p>“It’s too easy to vilify us,” she said.</p>
<p>Others have said fear and uncertainty have swept through the federal
workforce.</p>
<p>“They’re worried about their jobs. They’re worried about their
families. They’re also worried about their work and the communities they
serve,” said Helen Bottcher, a former Environmental Protection Agency
employee and current union leader in Seattle.</p>
<p>Bottcher participated in a press conference hosted by Senator Patty
Murray, a Democrat from Washington.</p>
<p>Murray said workers “deserve better than to be threatened,
intimidated and pushed out the door by Elon Musk and Donald Trump.” She
also said that “we actually need these people to stay in their jobs or
things are going to start breaking.”</p>

withdrawal from UN human rights body draws mixed reactions</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Human rights experts in Washington are divided over
whether the U.S. withdrawal from a United Nations body on human rights
will hurt North Korea’s already poor human rights situation.</p>
<p>Last Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order
pulling the U.S. out of the U.N. Human Rights Council, or UNHRC,
reintroducing the stance he held during his previous term.</p>
<p>The executive order said that the UNHRC has “protected human rights
abusers by allowing them to use the organization to shield themselves
from scrutiny,” adding that the council deserves “renewed scrutiny.”</p>
<p>The decision was announced ahead of Trump’s recent meeting with
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who visited Washington for
the first time since Trump’s second inauguration.</p>
<p>Since his first term, President Trump has been disapproving of the
activities of the U.N. human rights body. In June 2018, the Trump
administration criticized the UNHRC for its “bias against Israel,”
stressing the council that year passed resolutions against Israel more
than those passed against North Korea, Iran and Syria combined.</p>
<p>Negative impact</p>
<p>Robert King, who served as the U.S. special envoy for North Korea’s
human rights under the Obama administration, said that the U.S. decision
to withdraw from the U.N. Human Rights Council could negatively
undermine international efforts to improve human rights conditions in
the North.</p>
<p>“It will have a negative impact. The U.N. Human Rights Council has
been a very effective body in terms of calling attention to North
Korea’s serious human rights abuses,” King told VOA Korean on the phone
last week. “And the fact that the United States will not be an active
participant is again a very unfortunate situation.”</p>
<p>Roberta Cohen, former deputy assistant secretary of state for human
rights, said leaving the UNHRC is “a short-sighted decision.”</p>
<p>Cohen, who also served as senior adviser to the U.S. Delegation to
the U.N. Commission on Human Rights and the General Assembly, said it is
important that the U.S. be seated at the council with a vote and be
active in mobilizing support for any new initiatives.</p>
<p>“If the reforms are needed and they are, the U.S. should be involved
heavily,” Cohen told VOA Korean by phone last week. “Walking away cedes
the floor to your opponents.”</p>
<p>Cohen highlighted that the council was where the Commission of
Inquiry on the Human Rights in North Korea, or COI, was conceived. The
COI is widely considered to be the first systematic and thorough
documentation of Pyongyang’s violations of human rights.</p>
<p>She added that an update of the COI is to be presented in September
for the first time in more than a decade, saying that Washington needs
to be part of the process when the report is introduced.</p>
<p>However, others question the role of the Human Rights Council in
making a real impact on improving North Korea’s human rights
conditions.</p>
<p>“The Human Rights Council has become a very tragic farce. It was
supposed to promote and protect human rights around the world but
instead it coddles dictatorships and gives them legitimacy by including
them as members of the council,” said Suzanne Scholte, president of the
Defense Forum Foundation and a longtime North Korea human rights
activist. “We’re not addressing the horrific things that are happening
to the North Korean refugees in China that are being shot and executed
when they’re returned.”</p>
<p>‘Illegitimate’ members</p>
<p>Human rights experts have long criticized Beijing for failing to
afford protection to North Korean refugees and forcefully repatriating
them to North Korea.</p>
<p>David Maxwell, vice president of the Center for Asia Pacific Strategy
in Washington, said North Korean human rights issues need to be
separated from how Trump wants to deal with the United Nations.</p>
<p>“This is about the Trump administration’s views toward U.N.
organizations and how they are being misused by countries such as China,
Russia, Iran and North Korea,” Maxwell told VOA Korean on Monday via
email. “When these organizations are coerced by members of the so-called
axis of upheaval, they are not able to support the people who are
suffering true human rights abuses.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Andrew Yeo, a senior fellow and the SK-Korea Foundation
chair at the Brookings Institution’s Center for Asia Policy Studies in
Washington, said the U.S. has other tools to address the North Korean
human rights issue.</p>
<p>“Pulling out of the UNHRC won’t make much of a difference practically
speaking,” Yeo told VOA Korean via email last week. “The U.S. has other
means and platforms to raise North Korean human rights objections,
including its own State Department human rights reports.”</p>
<p>The U.S. rejoined the UNHRC shortly after the inauguration of Joe
Biden as president in 2021, but the Biden administration decided not to
seek a second term as a board member of the council when the three-year
membership was to expire at the end of 2024.</p>
<p>The move was made amid the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas,
which launched a surprise attack on the former a year prior. The State
Department explained at the time that the U.S. decided not to pursue a
second term at the council “because we are engaged with our allies about
the best way to move forward.”</p>
<p>Every March or April, the State Department releases the annual Human
Rights Reports, which cover the human rights situations around the
world. The document last year said there were credible reports of
unlawful killing, enforced disappearances and torture taking place in
North Korea.</p>

<h2 id="vance-tells-europeans-that-heavy-regulation-could-kill-ai">Vance
tells Europeans that heavy regulation could kill AI</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Paris — U.S. Vice President JD Vance told Europeans on Tuesday their
“massive” regulations on artificial intelligence could strangle the
technology, and rejected content moderation as “authoritarian
censorship.”</p>
<p>The mood on AI has shifted as the technology takes root, from one of
concerns around safety to geopolitical competition, as countries jockey
to nurture the next big AI giant.</p>
<p>Vance, setting out the Trump administration’s America First agenda,
said the United States intended to remain the dominant force in AI and
strongly opposed the European Union’s far tougher regulatory
approach.</p>
<p>“We believe that excessive regulation of the AI sector could kill a
transformative industry,” Vance told an AI summit of CEOs and heads of
state in Paris.</p>
<p>“We feel very strongly that AI must remain free from ideological bias
and that American AI will not be co-opted into a tool for authoritarian
censorship,” he added.</p>
<p>Vance criticized the “massive regulations” created by the EU’s
Digital Services Act, as well as Europe’s online privacy rules, known by
the acronym GDPR, which he said meant endless legal compliance costs for
smaller firms.</p>
<p>“Of course, we want to ensure the internet is a safe place, but it is
one thing to prevent a predator from preying on a child on the internet,
and it is something quite different to prevent a grown man or woman from
accessing an opinion that the government thinks is misinformation,” he
said.</p>
<p>European lawmakers last year approved the bloc’s AI Act, the world’s
first comprehensive set of rules governing the technology.</p>
<p>Vance is leading the American delegation at the Paris summit.</p>
<p>Vance also appeared to take aim at China at a delicate moment for the
U.S. technology sector.</p>
<p>Last month, Chinese startup DeepSeek freely distributed a powerful AI
reasoning model that some said challenged U.S. technology leadership. It
sent shares of American chip designer Nvidia down 17%.</p>
<p>“From CCTV to 5G equipment, we’re all familiar with cheap tech in the
marketplace that’s been heavily subsidized and exported by authoritarian
regimes,” Vance said.</p>
<p>But he said that “partnering with them means chaining your nation to
an authoritarian master that seeks to infiltrate, dig in and seize your
information infrastructure. Should a deal seem too good to be true? Just
remember the old adage that we learned in Silicon Valley: if you aren’t
paying for the product, you are the product.”</p>
<p>Vance did not mention DeepSeek by name. There has been no evidence of
information being able to surreptitiously flow through the startup’s
technology to China’s government, and the underlying code is freely
available to use and view. However, some government organizations have
reportedly banned DeepSeek’s use.</p>
<p>Speaking after Vance, French President Emmanuel Macron said that he
was fully in favor of trimming red tape, but he stressed that regulation
was still needed to ensure trust in AI, or people would end up rejecting
it. “We need a trustworthy AI,” he said.</p>
<p>European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen also said the EU would
cut red tape and invest more in AI.</p>
<p>In a bilateral meeting, Vance and von der Leyen were also likely to
discuss Trump’s substantial increase of tariffs on steel.</p>
<p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was expected to address the summit on Tuesday.
A consortium led by Musk said on Monday it had offered $97.4 billion to
buy the nonprofit controlling OpenAI.</p>
<p>Altman promptly posted on X: “no thank you but we will buy twitter
for $9.74 billion if you want.”</p>
<p>The technology world has closely watched whether the Trump
administration will ease recent antitrust enforcement that had seen the
U.S. sue or investigate the industry’s biggest players.</p>
<p>Vance said the U.S. would champion American AI – which big players
develop – he also said: “Our laws will keep Big Tech, little tech, and
all other developers on a level playing field.”</p>

id="modi-to-meet-trump-with-focus-on-trade-immigration-and-strategic-ties">Modi
to meet Trump with focus on trade, immigration and strategic ties</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New Delhi — As Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi heads to the
United States for a two-day visit starting Wednesday, officials in New
Delhi expressed optimism that the visit will herald a renewed and
substantive partnership. However analysts said there will be contentious
issues to navigate on trade and immigration, which are among U.S.
President Donald Trump’s top priorities.</p>
<p>Underlining that Modi will be meeting Trump within weeks of his
taking office, Indian foreign secretary Vikram Misri said India-U.S.
ties are solid and that “this has been one of our strongest
international partnerships.”</p>
<p>Modi will reach Washington after visiting France, where he is
attending a global conference on artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Trade is important for both countries and India has taken steps to
demonstrate that it is ready to address concerns of Trump, who has named
India among countries that are “very big tariff abusers.” In a phone
conversation with Modi last month, Trump called for moving toward a fair
bilateral trading relationship.</p>
<p>His top economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, repeated such concerns on
Monday. “India has enormously high” tariffs that lock out imports, he
said in an interview with CNBC.</p>
<p>New Delhi, which wants to avoid trade tensions with the U.S.,
announced earlier this month that it will lower import duties on some
items that will benefit American exports such as high-end motorcycles
and cars.</p>
<p>It also may offer other concessions that could help American goods
gain market access to India and boost energy imports from the U.S., say
analysts.</p>
<p>“New Delhi thought it would take a first step and try to resolve
differences on trade. But, certainly, as a great negotiator and
bargainer, he [Trump] will ask for more,” said Chintamani Mahapatra,
founder of the Kalinga School of Indo Pacific Studies. “India also
bargains very well. So, somehow, we will try to make a compromise that
will benefit both.”</p>
<p>For India, the stakes are high — the U.S. is its largest trading
partner. Bilateral trade between the two countries was $118 billion,
with a surplus of about $32 billion in India’s favor in 2023.</p>
<p>India has not been impacted so far by Trump’s tariff impositions —
the latest 25 percent tariffs he imposed on steel and aluminum imports
will have merely a marginal impact on India, as New Delhi is a small
exporter of steel to the U.S., according to Indian officials.</p>
<p>Strengthening security and defense ties with the U.S., Indian
officials say will also be discussed in Washington. According to
analysts that could include potential purchases of weapon systems and
technology. In the recent phone conversation with Modi, President Trump
had called on Modi to increase procurement of American-made security
equipment.</p>
<p>India, the world’s largest spender on military equipment, needs a
range of weapons systems to modernize its military. As it diversifies
its purchases from its traditional weapons supplier, Russia, India has
been purchasing more arms from countries like France, Israel and the
United States.</p>
<p>“The U.S. is a little concerned that it is losing out on the India
[security] buys, so it has stepped up pressure to sell India a lot more
defense equipment than India has bought in the last few years,”
according to Rahul Bedi, defense analyst in New Delhi. “There is likely
to be initiatives on transport aircraft, surveillance aircraft for the
navy, and possibly even fighter aircraft, as well as a lot of technology
transfers for aircraft engines, infantry combat vehicles.”</p>
<p>Immigration is another issue of concern to both countries. Although
India has cooperated with the U.S. and said it is ready to take back
undocumented migrants, reports of 104 undocumented Indians being
shackled for 40 hours while being brought back to India on a military
plane last week from the U.S. led to an uproar and protests by
opposition parties.</p>
<p>Indian officials have said that New Delhi will call for better
treatment during future deportations.</p>
<p>At the same time, India’s top priority during discussions will be to
protect legal channels of immigration for skilled Indian workers and
students heading to American universities. Indians are the largest
beneficiaries of H1B visas, which allow U.S. employers to hire foreign
professionals in specialized fields, such as technology.</p>
<p>“People-to-people relationships constitute the bedrock of our
deepening ties with the United States,” Indian foreign minister,
Subrahmanyam Jaishankar told lawmakers, while responding to concerns
about the transport and treatment of the deportees.</p>
<p>In a statement before leaving New Delhi, Modi called his upcoming
meeting with Trump an opportunity to build upon the successes of their
collaboration in Trump’s first term.</p>
<p>Mutual concerns about an assertive China are likely to keep the two
countries aligned, according to analysts. Along with the U.S., Australia
and Japan, India is a partner in the Quad, a strategic security grouping
focused on the Indo-Pacific. Analysts point out that the two countries
have convergence on geostrategic issues.</p>
<p>“It was president Trump in his first term, who dusted off the Quad,
which was in a dormant state for about ten years, and he was solely
responsible for reviving it,” said Mahapatra. “This is an area where
both the countries have a lot of things in common for maintaining peace,
stability and contributing to the growth story in the Indo-Pacific
region.”</p>

id="virginia-governor-declares-storm-emergency-as-snow-and-ice-bear-down-on-mid-atlantic-states">Virginia
governor declares storm emergency as snow and ice bear down on
mid-Atlantic states</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A wintry mess was bearing down on mid-Atlantic states Tuesday with
forecasts of significant snow and ice accumulations prompting warnings
of potential power outages.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service said travel would become treacherous
Tuesday through early Wednesday in much of Virginia and West
Virginia.</p>
<p>Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin on Monday declared a state of
emergency ahead of the storm, allowing state agencies to assist local
governments. Schools and government offices throughout Virginia were set
to be closed Tuesday.</p>
<p>The heaviest snow, up to 25.4 centimeters, was forecast in portions
of northern and central Virginia and eastern West Virginia. Ice
accumulations could range from a glaze in Kentucky and West Virginia to
1.3 centimeters in the Roanoke Valley of southwest Virginia, the weather
service said. Power outages and tree damage were likely in places with
heavy ice buildups.</p>
<p>“Did you think winter was over? Think again!” the weather service’s
office in Blacksburg, Virginia, said in a post on the social media
platform X.</p>
<p>Appalachian Power, which serves 1 million customers in West Virginia,
Virginia and Tennessee, said it has requested 700 additional workers
from neighboring utilities to assist with problems by Tuesday
morning.</p>
<p>In northern Virginia, the National Park Service closed a portion of
the George Washington Memorial Parkway, a narrow highway that winds its
way through woods along the Potomac River. The parkway connects multiple
small national park sites and has historically been a trouble spot
during winter storms for abandoned cars that created a slalom course for
snowplows and other vehicles.</p>
<p>Winter storm warnings extended from Kentucky to southern New Jersey,
and a flood watch was posted for a wide swath of Kentucky, Tennessee,
southwest Virginia and northern Georgia. The snow-and-ice mix was
expected to become all rain as temperatures climb by Wednesday
afternoon.</p>
<p>A separate storm system is set to bring heavy snow from Kansas and
Missouri to the Great Lakes on Wednesday, the weather service said.</p>
<p>Dangerous cold was forecast Tuesday from an Arctic air mass
stretching from Portland, Oregon, to the Great Lakes.</p>
<p>The temperature was expected to bottom out Tuesday morning at minus
36 degrees Celsius in Butte, Montana, where over the past two winters at
least five people died due to cold exposure, said Brayton Erickson,
executive director of the Butte Rescue Mission. Advocates for the
homeless in the city of about 35,000 planned to be out on the streets
distributing sleeping bags, jackets, mittens and other cold weather gear
to anyone who needs them, Erickson said.</p>
<p>“When it gets this cold, we kind of pull out all the stops,” he said.
“Having all those resources available literally can save their life or
keep them from frostbite.”</p>

jets collide at Scottsdale Airport in Arizona, killing 1 person,
authorities say</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. — One person was killed and others were injured
when a private jet owned by Mötley Crüe singer Vince Neil collided with
another jet Monday afternoon at the Scottsdale Airport in Arizona,
authorities said.</p>
<p>Neil’s jet was landing at the airport when it veered off the runway
and collided with another parked plane, Neil’s representative Worrick
Robinson, IV, said in a statement. There were two pilots and two
passengers on Neil’s plane, but he was not among them.</p>
<p>“Mr. Neil’s thoughts and prayers go out to everyone involved, and he
is grateful for the critical aid of all first responders assisting
today,” Robinson said.</p>
<p>The arriving jet veered off the runway and collided with the
Gulfstream 200 jet that was parked, according to Kelli Kuester, aviation
planning and outreach coordinator at the Scottsdale Airport. It appeared
that the primary landing gear of the arriving jet failed, resulting in
the collision, she said.</p>
<p>Kuester said four people were on the arriving jet, which had come
from Austin, Texas, and one person was in the parked plane.</p>
<p>Two people injured in the collision were taken to trauma centers and
one was in stable condition at a hospital, Scottsdale Fire Department
Capt. Dave Folio said. He said they were working to recover the body of
the person killed in the collision.</p>
<p>“Our thoughts and prayers go out to everybody involved in this,”
Folio said.</p>
<p>The runway has been closed and will remain closed “for the
foreseeable future,” Kuester said.</p>
<p>Scottsdale Mayor Lisa Borowsky said in a statement that she is
closely monitoring the situation and is in touch with the airport,
police and federal agencies.</p>
<p>“On behalf of the city of Scottsdale, we offer our deepest
condolences to those involved in the accident and for those who have
been taken to our trauma center for treatment,” she said. “We will keep
all affected by this tragedy in our prayers.”</p>
<p>The airport is a popular hub for jets coming in and out of the
Phoenix area, especially during big sports weekends like the Waste
Management Phoenix Open golf tournament, which attracts huge crowds just
a few miles away.</p>
<p>The Scottsdale collision comes after three major U.S. aviation
disasters in the past two weeks. </p>
<p>A commercial jetliner and an Army helicopter collided near the
nation’s capital on Jan. 29, killing 67 people. A medical transportation
plane crashed in Philadelphia on Jan. 31, killing the six people on
board and another person on the ground. And last week a small commuter
plane crashed in western Alaska on its way to the hub community of Nome,
killing all 10 people on board.</p>

<p>date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday announced a 25% tariff on
aluminum and steel tariffs that could hit Canada and Mexico, the top two
exporters to the U.S., the hardest. Trump’s ongoing trade offensive also
provoked chiding from the U.S.’ top competitor, China. VOA correspondent

id="back-to-plastic-trump-announces-us-policy-to-end-the-use-of-paper-straws">Back
to plastic: Trump announces US policy ‘to end the use of paper
straws’</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>President Donald Trump issued an executive order Monday declaring
that it is “the policy of the United States to end the use of paper
straws.”</p>
<p>Former President Joe Biden’s administration, in an attempt to phase
out federal purchases of single-use plastics, announced a plan in July
2024 to replace plastics with reusable, compostable and highly
recyclable products.</p>
<p>Trump’s order Monday stated that paper straws “are nonfunctional, use
chemicals that may carry risks to human health, are more expensive to
produce than plastic straws, and often force users to use multiple
straws.”</p>
<p>He also noted that paper straws are often individually wrapped in
plastic, which undermines the environmental argument for their use.</p>
<p>“It’s a ridiculous situation. We’re going back to plastic straws,”
Trump said Monday as he signed the order.</p>
<p>The Biden policy aimed to get plastic straws and other single-use
plastics out of federal food service operations, events and packaging by
2027, and from all federal operations by 2035.</p>
<p>Trump declared President Joe Biden’s policy “DEAD!” in a social media
post over the weekend.</p>
<p>In his Monday order, he instructed agency officials to stop buying
paper straws and make sure paper straws are no longer provided within
agency buildings.</p>
<p>He also directed officials to create a national strategy to end the
use of paper straws within 45 days.</p>

<h2 id="trump-imposes-25-tariffs-on-steel-aluminum-imports-1">Trump
imposes 25% tariffs on steel, aluminum imports</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>White House — President Donald Trump on Monday fired another volley
in his ongoing trade war, announcing 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum
imports and canceling exemptions and duty-free quotas for major
suppliers.</p>
<p>“It’s a big deal,” Trump said, the thick black marker in his right
hand hovering over the executive order.</p>
<p>“This is the beginning of making America rich again,” he said,
dragging his distinctive jagged signature over the paper.</p>
<p>Billionaire financier Howard Lutnick, Trump’s nominee to lead the
Commerce Department, watched from over Trump’s left shoulder in the Oval
Office. Trump’s trade adviser said this move will help domestic
producers and support U.S. economic and national security. Lutnick spoke
of the 120,000 jobs this could bring back.</p>
<p>“You are the president who is standing up for the American
steelworker, and I am just tremendously impressed and delighted to stand
next to you,” Lutnick said.</p>
<p>The nuts and bolts</p>
<p>Trump’s proclamations raised the rate on aluminum imports to 25% from
the previous 10% that he imposed in 2018 to aid the struggling sector.
And he restored a 25% tariff on millions of tons of steel and aluminum
imports.</p>
<p>Trump’s actions also will impose a new North American standard
requiring steel imports to be “melted and poured” and aluminum to be
“smelted and cast” in the region to curb imports of minimally processed
Chinese steel.</p>
<p>The order also targets downstream steel products that use imported
steel for tariffs.</p>
<p>Trump’s trade adviser, Peter Navarro, said the measures would help
U.S. steel and aluminum producers and shore up America’s economic and
national security.</p>
<p>“The steel and aluminum tariffs 2.0 will put an end to foreign
dumping, boost domestic production and secure our steel and aluminum
industries as the backbone and pillar industries of America’s economic
and national security,” he told reporters.</p>
<p>“This isn’t just about trade. It’s about ensuring that America never
has to rely on foreign nations for critical industries like steel and
aluminum,” Navarro said.</p>
<p>What now?</p>
<p>Trump first broached the steel and aluminum action Sunday — and the
move drew instant pushback in what is unfolding as a tit-for-tat
exchange.</p>
<p>Earlier Monday, Beijing enacted additional tariffs on U.S. goods as a
countermeasure to Trump’s earlier 10% hike on Chinese goods.</p>
<p>“There are no winners in trade wars and tariff wars,” said Guo
Jiakun, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. “They
harm the interests of the people of both countries. What is needed now
is not unilateral tariff increases but equal dialogue and consultation
based on mutual respect. We urge the U.S. to correct its wrong practices
and stop politicizing and instrumentalizing economic and trade
issues.”</p>
<p>Most economists believe tariffs raise consumer prices. Scholars of
supply chains and logistics say Trump’s move also raises major global
policy questions.</p>
<p>“It’s not clear whether this is a negotiating strategy, whether this
is going to be permanent,” said Professor Sunderesh Heragu of Oklahoma
State University. “Is this only restricted to Canada, Mexico and China
as it is now, or is it going to expand to the European Union, for
example, or even the BRICS countries, of which, you know, Brazil,
Russia, India, China, South Africa and 12 or 14 other countries, are
part of?”</p>
<p>He said these concerns may prompt countries to realign their trade
relationships, which will likely alarm producers.</p>
<p>“It clearly causes a lot of confusion, and you know, businesses,
again, hate uncertainty,” Heragu said. “So, they’re going to put
everything on pause. That means, you know, there could be a decrease in
production activity, while at the same time, the tariffs could have
inflationary effects.”</p>
<p>Some in the automotive industry in Detroit, the U.S.’ “Motor City,”
echoed that concern.</p>
<p>“Sudden tariffs to a system — there isn’t a lot of good that comes
out of that,” said Glenn Stevens Jr., executive director of MichAuto and
vice president of automotive and mobility initiatives at the Detroit
Regional Chamber.</p>
<p>Studies attempting to understand the impact of these moves yield
mixed pictures. The Washington, D.C.-based Tax Foundation estimates that
the tariffs will generate around $100 billion each year in federal tax
revenue.</p>
<p>Another analysis shows they could “impose significant costs on the
broader economy: disrupting supply chains, raising costs for businesses,
eliminating hundreds of thousands of jobs and ultimately driving up
consumer prices.”</p>

<h2 id="hamas-threatens-to-delay-hostage-release">Hamas threatens to
delay hostage release</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Hamas officials accused Israel of violating a ceasefire agreement
Monday and threatened to delay releasing more hostages, prompting U.S.
President Donald Trump to say “all hell is going to break out” if all
the remaining hostages are not turned over by Saturday.</p>
<p>The next exchange was set for Saturday, with three more Israelis set
to be freed in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners jailed by
Israel.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Hamas’ armed wing, the al-Qassam Brigades, said in
a statement the militants remain committed to the ceasefire terms “as
long as the occupation adheres to them.”</p>
<p>Hamas accused Israel of delaying the return of displaced Palestinians
to northern Gaza, although hundreds of thousands have returned. The
group said Palestinians were targeted “with airstrikes and gunfire
across various areas” and Israel has failed “to facilitate the entry of
humanitarian aid as agreed.”</p>
<p>However, a United Nations official said 12,600 humanitarian aid
trucks have entered Gaza since the ceasefire began and the immediate
threat of famine has dissipated.</p>
<p>Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said any delay by Hamas would be
“a complete violation” of the ceasefire agreement. He placed the Israeli
military on the highest level of alert.</p>
<p>In Washington Monday, Trump said he would propose canceling the
ceasefire agreement if all the remaining hostages being held in Gaza
were not released by 12 o’clock Saturday, but he did not specify whether
that was noon or midnight, and he did not indicate a time zone. </p>
<p>He also said he might withhold aid to Jordan and Egypt if they don’t
take Palestinian refugees being relocated from Gaza.</p>
<p>Since the ceasefire took effect last month, Hamas has freed 21
hostages while Israel has released more than 730 prisoners.</p>
<p>Trump has proposed moving Palestinians living in Gaza to an
unspecified location outside the territory. Under his plan for the
enclave, they would have no right to return.</p>
<p>In an interview with Fox News released Monday, he called his plan for
the narrow territory along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea a “real
estate development for the future.”</p>
<p>“I would own it,” he said, adding that the 2.3 million Palestinians
now living in war-ravaged Gaza would be moved to as many as six
different sites outside Gaza under a plan that the Arab world, as well
as U.S. allies and adversaries alike, have already rejected.</p>
<p>Trump, a billionaire New York real estate magnate before entering
politics in 2015, did not say where the Palestinians would be relocated.
But when asked by Fox anchor Bret Baier if they would be allowed to
return home to Gaza, Trump said, “No, they wouldn’t, because they’re
going to have much better housing.”</p>
<p>“In other words, I’m talking about building a permanent place for
them because if they have to return now, it’ll be years before you could
ever — it’s not habitable,” Trump said of Gaza, decimated by 15 months
of fighting between Israel and Hamas.</p>
<p>In the Fox interview, Trump said he would build “beautiful
communities” for the Palestinians.</p>
<p>“Could be five, six, could be two. But we’ll build safe communities,
a little bit away from where they are, where all of this danger is,”
Trump said.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Israeli troops withdrew from the Netzarim corridor, a
narrow strip of land that bisects the territory. It allowed more
Palestinians to return to the northern sector where they once lived, but
much of the land has been leveled by fighting.</p>
<p>Hamas spokesperson Abdel Latif Al-Qanoua said the withdrawal showed
Hamas had “forced the enemy to submit to our demands” and that it
thwarted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s “Illusion of
achieving total victory.”</p>
<p>Israeli officials did not disclose how many soldiers withdrew or to
where. Troops currently remain along Gaza’s borders with Israel and
Egypt and a full withdrawal is expected to be negotiated in a later
stage of the initial 42-day ceasefire.</p>
<p>During the first six-week phase of the ceasefire, Hamas is gradually
releasing 33 Israeli hostages captured during its Oct. 7, 2023, attack
on Israel in exchange for a pause in fighting, freedom for hundreds of
Palestinian prisoners and a flood of humanitarian aid into Gaza. The
deal also stipulated that Israeli troops would pull back from populated
areas of Gaza as well as the Netzarim corridor.</p>
<p>In the second phase, all remaining living hostages would be released
in return for a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a “sustainable
calm.” But details are unclear and yet to be negotiated.</p>
<p>The war in Gaza was triggered by the shock October 2023 Hamas terror
attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of 250
hostages. Israel’s counteroffensive killed more than 47,000
Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to
local health authorities. Israel says the death toll includes 17,000
militants it has killed.</p>

<p>date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The Justice Department on Monday directed federal prosecutors in New
York to drop corruption charges against New York Mayor Eric Adams,
according to a memo from acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove.</p>
<p>Bove, a political appointee of President Donald Trump, intervened in
the case, saying the indictment of Adams interfered with his 2025
mayoral reelection campaign.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney’s office in Manhattan, which
brought the charges, declined to comment.</p>
<p>Prosecutors have not yet indicated to the judge overseeing the case,
U.S. District Judge Dale Ho in Manhattan, that they plan to drop the
case, court records showed Monday evening.</p>
<p>Adams was the subject of a five-count indictment charging him with
accepting travel perks from Turkish officials and political donations
from foreigners in exchange for taking actions to benefit Turkey.</p>
<p>Adams pleaded not guilty.</p>

id="musk-led-group-makes-97.4-billion-bid-for-control-of-openai">Musk-led
group makes $97.4 billion bid for control of OpenAI</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A consortium led by Elon Musk said Monday it has offered $97.4
billion to buy the nonprofit that controls OpenAI, another salvo in the
billionaire’s fight to block the artificial intelligence startup from
transitioning to a for-profit firm.</p>
<p>Musk’s bid is likely to ratchet up longstanding tensions with OpenAI
CEO Sam Altman over the future of the startup at the heart of a boom in
generative AI technology. Altman on Monday promptly posted on X: “no
thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74 billion if you want.”</p>
<p>Musk cofounded OpenAI with Altman in 2015 as a nonprofit, but left
before the company took off. He founded the competing AI startup xAI in
2023.</p>
<p>Musk, the CEO of Tesla and owner of tech and social media company X,
is a close ally of President Donald Trump. He spent more than a quarter
of a billion dollars to help elect Trump, and leads the Department of
Government Efficiency, a new arm of the White House tasked with
radically shrinking the federal bureaucracy. Musk recently criticized a
$500 billion OpenAI-led project announced by Trump at the White
House.</p>
<p>OpenAI is now trying to transition into a for-profit from a nonprofit
entity, which it says is required to secure the capital needed for
developing the best AI models.</p>
<p>Musk sued Altman and others in August last year, claiming they
violated contract provisions by putting profit ahead of the public good
in the push to advance AI. In November, he asked a U.S. district judge
for a preliminary injunction blocking OpenAI from converting to a
for-profit structure.</p>
<p>Musk’s lawsuit against OpenAI and Altman says the founders originally
approached him to fund a nonprofit focused on developing AI to benefit
humanity, but that it was now focused on making money.</p>
<p>“It’s time for OpenAI to return to the open-source, safety-focused
force for good it once was,” Musk said in a statement Monday. “We will
make sure that happens.”</p>
<p>Musk and OpenAI backer Microsoft did not immediately respond to
requests for comment.</p>
<p>“Musk’s bid puts another wrinkle into OpenAI’s quest to remove the
nonprofit’s control over its for-profit entity,” said Rose Chan Loui,
executive director of the UCLA Law Center for Philanthropy and
Nonprofits.</p>
<p>“This bid sets a marker for the valuation of the nonprofit’s economic
interests,” she said. “If OpenAI values the nonprofit’s interests at
less than what Musk is offering, then they would have to show why.”</p>
<p>The consortium led by Musk includes his AI startup xAI, Baron Capital
Group, Valor Management, Atreides Management, Vy Fund III, Emanuel
Capital Management, and Eight Partners.</p>
<p>XAI could merge with OpenAI following a deal, according to The Wall
Street Journal which first reported Musk’s offer earlier Monday. XAI
recently raised $6 billion from investors at a valuation of $40 billion,
sources have told Reuters.</p>
<p>Throwing a wrench</p>
<p>“This (bid) is definitely throwing a wrench in things,” said Jonathan
Macey, a Yale Law School professor specializing in corporate
governance.</p>
<p>“The nonprofit is supposed to take money to do whatever good deeds,
and if OpenAI prefers to sell it to somebody else for less money, it’s a
concern for protecting the interests of the beneficiaries of the
not-for-profit. If this was a public company, plaintiffs’ lawyers would
justifiably be lining up down the block to sue that transaction.”</p>
<p>OpenAI was valued at $157 billion in its last funding round,
cementing its status as one of the most valuable private companies in
the world. SoftBank Group is in talks to lead a funding round of up to
$40 billion in OpenAI at a valuation of $300 billion, including the new
funds, Reuters reported in January.</p>
<p>Aside from any antitrust implications, a deal this size would need
Musk and his consortium to raise enormous funds.</p>
<p>“Musk’s offer to buy OpenAI’s nonprofit should significantly
complicate OpenAI’s current fundraising and the process of converting
into a for-profit corporation,” said Gil Luria, analyst at D.A.
Davidson.</p>
<p>“The offer seems to be backed by more credible investors … OpenAI may
not be able to ignore it. It will be the fiduciary responsibility of
OpenAI’s board to decide whether this is a better offer, which could
call into question the offer from SoftBank.”</p>
<p>Musk’s stock in Tesla is valued at roughly $165 billion, according to
LSEG data, but his leverage with banks is likely to be thin after his
$44 billion buyout of the social media platform that was called Twitter
in 2022.</p>

id="facing-backlash-over-500k-salary-las-wildfire-recovery-czar-agrees-to-work-for-free">Facing
backlash over $500K salary, LA’s wildfire recovery czar agrees to work
for free</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — Steve Soboroff, a longtime fixture in Los Angeles civic
life who is now serving as chief recovery officer for the city’s
wildfire comeback, won’t take a salary after facing backlash over plans
to pay him $500,000. He would have been paid through charitable
donations, not with taxpayer money.</p>
<p>Soboroff had defended the proposed salary of half-a-million dollars
for three months of work, saying his expertise as a residential property
developer made him worth the price. But after criticisms mounted from
elected officials and residents, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass reversed
course over the weekend and said Soboroff would receive no compensation.
Soboroff is the city’s former police commissioner.</p>
<p>“Steve is always there for LA. I spoke to him today and asked him to
modify his agreement and work for free. He said yes. We agree that we
don’t need anything distracting from the recovery work we’re doing,”
Bass said in a statement Saturday. She had named him to the recovery
czar position on Jan. 17.</p>
<p>A message seeking comment was left for Soboroff on Monday.</p>
<p>Soboroff, 76, raised his family in the Pacific Palisades area, where
nearly 7,000 homes were destroyed by last month’s inferno. His son, NBC
News journalist Jacob Soboroff, reported from the devastated
neighborhood where he grew up.</p>
<p>He was initially tasked with leading the first phase of the city’s
wildfire rebuilding effort. On Friday though, Bass suggested that the
scope of his work could be diminished, saying he would focus primarily
on rebuilding the Palisades’ historic business district.</p>
<p>Soboroff disputed that notion, saying he is regularly interacting
with federal agencies.</p>
<p>In addition to developing thousands of homes over decades, Soboroff
served on the city’s Board of Police Commissioners and on the city
commission that oversees the Department of Recreation and Parks — both
volunteer positions.</p>
<p>Before the salary reversal, he told the Los Angeles Times that he put
aside other real estate and environmental consulting work to take on the
role of the city’s recovery officer.</p>
<p>“I’ve been doing this for 35 years for free on some of the biggest
civic projects for the city of Los Angeles. But nobody ever asked me to
drop everything. This time they did,” Soboroff said. “And I said OK,
under the condition that my pay not be taken out of city money, or from
any wildfire survivors who would otherwise benefit from that money.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t clear which charitable organizations would have covered his
pay. Los Angeles City Councilmember Monica Rodriguez, who sits on the
committee overseeing the recovery, called the proposed salary
“obscene.”</p>
<p>Soboroff’s original salary was first reported by the Times.</p>

<h2 id="what-the-westminster-show-dogs-names-mean">What the Westminster
show dogs’ names mean</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>They have names that could make a random password generator cry
uncle.</p>
<p>Meet, for example, GCHG CH Calicops Sassafras Gonnakikurass.</p>
<p>“She’s a saucy girl. Her name says it all,” Fred Ortiz said as he
groomed the Brussels griffon to compete Monday at the Westminster Kennel
Club dog show.</p>
<p>Her name says … what exactly? Well, ponder the final part, and you
may understand what her owners are wryly getting at. But in any event,
you can just call her Wrassy.</p>
<p>Westminster’s main competition began Monday with breed-by-breed
judging that leads to U.S. dogdom’s most illustrious best in show prize,
awarded Tuesday night. The kennel club held agility and obedience
contests Saturday, as well as other events.</p>
<p>If show dogs are the aristocrats of the canine world, they often have
the names, titles and nicknames to match.</p>
<p>Their “registered,” or formal, names are the ones used for showing.
Those long, confounding-sounding appellations are packed with show-dog
information.</p>
<p>Clumps of capital letters at the beginning, and sometimes also the
end, signify the dogs’ achievements in various sports. “GCHG” and “CH,”
for example, denote various levels of championship in the traditional,
breed-by-breed judging.</p>
<p>After those titles, the first word in a registered name generally
indicates the kennel, or breeding program, that produced the dog. Other
kennels or dogs in the pedigree might get a shout-out at the end.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, show dogs have “call names” that they go by on a
day-to-day basis. A dog might also have had a different “puppy name”
bestowed by its breeder and later changed by its eventual owner.</p>
<p>The portmanteau words and puzzling phrases in registered names are
partly meant to avoid duplication with other dogs in registries that go
back over a century.</p>
<p>But many breeders also use patterns to help them remember which
litter was which.</p>
<p>Professional dog handlers and sometime miniature schnauzer breeders
Rachel Adams and Alberto Montila name their litters in alphabetical
order — one litter had names that start with “A,” the next with “B,” and
so on, Adams said Monday. She was blow-drying a French bulldog named
GCHG CH Elysium’s Adventurous Rapscallion D’Assisi, better known as
Finn.</p>
<p>When Amie McLaughlin picks names for her litters of Norwegian
buhunds, she just likes to have pun.</p>
<p>“I like the name to be something that someone looks at and says, ‘Oh,
that’s cute,’” said McLaughlin, of Kent, Washington.</p>
<p>A dog she bred and guided Monday, GCH CH Cloudpointe Nothing Betta
Than This CGC, was born into a fish-themed litter (hence “Betta,” a type
of Southeast Asian fish). He goes by Eirik when he’s at home with
co-owner Sarah Woodworth in Paloa, Hawaii.</p>
<p>GCH CH Aberdeen’s Zoltar RN BN-V — just Zoltar, to his friends — has
owners who appreciate humor, too. For one thing, they share their Los
Angeles-area home with a shaggy, clownish, 120-pound otterhound who
likes to cuddle.</p>
<p>Comedian and actor Chris Hardwick, who owns the dog with his wife,
model and actor Lydia Hearst, named Zoltar for the fortune-telling
machine that makes a teenager grow to adult proportions overnight in the
movie “Big.”</p>
<p>“We knew he was going to grow,” and plenty big, explained Hearst.</p>
<p>Zoltar got some recognition Monday from the judge, but the dog’s
cousin Melody, aka GCHS CH Dobhran’s Alexa Play Some Music, won best of
breed.</p>
<p>Hardwick and Hearst were also cheering on the French bulldog breed
winner called Sassy, or GCHS Diva’s Sassafras Lass. She and other breed
winners were headed into a semifinal round Monday night.</p>
<p>Sassy is owned and was co-bred by Hearst’s mother, newspaper heir
Patricia Hearst Shaw. Famous in the 1970s for her abduction and
involvement in a robbery by a radical group, she’s been renowned in
recent years for her Frenchies and other show dogs.</p>
<p>Colton Johnson and his family name their litters of old English
sheepdogs by themes, such as songs, movies, money, or — appropriately —
fluffy things.</p>
<p>One of those “fluff” dogs is GCH CH Bugaboo’s Give Me S’more, who
lolled on a table while Johnson brushed him Monday.</p>
<p>“It’s his spa day,” joked Johnson, of Colorado Springs, Colorado.</p>
<p>The dog’s call name is Graham, as in the crackers that join toasted
marshmallow and chocolate to make s’mores. The Johnsons considered
calling him Marsh or Mallow, but those names didn’t stick.</p>
<p>Three-year-old Graham is a grandson of Swagger, the old English
sheepdog whom Johnson handled to a second-place finish at Westminster in
2013.</p>
<p>Last year’s runner-up, a German shepherd named GCHP Kaleef’s
Mercedes, is back this year for a last hurrah and won her breed Monday.
The 5-year-old will retire from showing after this event, co-owner
Dr. Cynthian Wilhelmy said.</p>
<p>As for her name, “I wanted something German and something that
represented excellence,” said Wilhelmy, of Martinsburg, West Virginia.
“Classic, reliable and excellent — that’s Mercedes.”</p>

id="democrats-look-for-ways-to-oppose-trump-administrations-changes-while-in-the-minority">Democrats
look for ways to oppose Trump administration’s changes while in the
minority</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Democratic lawmakers criticized what they called the Trump
administration’s “extreme” efforts to reshape the U.S. government,
vowing to oppose those changes despite limited political capital in both
chambers of the U.S. Congress.</p>
<p>House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said on the chamber’s floor
Monday that Republicans were departing from their campaign pledge not to
follow Project 2025, a conservative blueprint for reshaping the U.S.
government.</p>
<p>“This year, Republicans have spent all of their time implementing the
most extreme parts of Project 2025 and have done nothing to lower the
high cost of living,” Jeffries said.</p>
<p>Congressional Republicans say Trump is exercising broad presidential
authority to reevaluate government agencies. Trump is accomplishing this
through Elon Musk, a multibillionaire whom he put in charge of the
Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, whose aim is to reduce
federal spending.</p>
<p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer wrote in a letter to colleagues
that Democrats have a four-pronged strategy to oppose the Trump
administration’s actions: oversight, litigation, legislation, and
communication and mobilization.</p>
<p>Schumer also said Democrats would continue to support litigation in
the courts to stop the funding freeze and to prevent federal employees
from being laid off.</p>
<p>Vice President JD Vance criticized those judicial decisions, writing
on X, “If a judge tried to tell a general how to conduct a military
operation, that would be illegal. If a judge tried to command the
attorney general in how to use her discretion as a prosecutor, that’s
also illegal. Judges aren’t allowed to control the executive’s
legitimate power.”</p>
<p>Democratic Senator Chris Murphy responded on X Monday, “For those of
us who believe we are in the middle of a constitutional crisis, this is
the meat of it. Trump and Vance are laying the groundwork to ignore the
courts — democracy’s last line of defense against unchecked executive
power.”</p>
<p>Senate Democrats also announced a new whistleblowers portal for
federal civil service employees and public servants to disclose
information about wrongdoing.</p>
<p>In a statement, they said, “As Senate Republicans refuse to fulfill
their constitutional duty to provide a check on the Executive Branch,
Senate Democrats remain steadfast in our commitment to uncovering the
truth. We are prepared to issue demand letters, preserve public records,
conduct public hearings, and pursue legal action where necessary.”</p>
<p>Schumer said Democrats would support legislation funding the U.S.
government but called on Republicans to negotiate in a bipartisan
fashion. A short-term resolution funding the U.S. government expires on
March 14. Any bill funding the government past that date needs 60 votes
in the U.S. Senate to pass. Republicans currently hold the majority in
the chamber with 53 seats.</p>

id="as-tariffs-take-effect-beijing-and-washington-look-back-to-2020-deal">As
tariffs take effect, Beijing and Washington look back to 2020 deal</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New Chinese tariffs on a range of U.S. goods went into effect Monday,
following U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to impose a 10% tariff
on Chinese products last week. Tariffs of 25% on steel and aluminum are
next.</p>
<p>Despite the tariffs and rising tensions, both sides seem reluctant to
launch into a full-on trade war, analysts say.</p>
<p>Beijing has its plate full battling its own internal economic
struggles, and for now President Trump has deferred most of his promised
tariffs on the world’s second-largest economy.</p>
<p>Last week, The Wall Street Journal reported that Beijing is preparing
to offer to return to a so-called “Phase 1” trade deal that was signed
during Trump’s first term.</p>
<p>The Trump administration has sent its own signals as well. </p>
<p>Trump has called for the Office of the United States Trade
Representative to review the first phase of the U.S.-China trade
agreement and determine whether Beijing has fulfilled its commitments in
the contract.</p>
<p>Last week, Jamieson Greer, Trump’s nominee for U.S. trade
representative, said he would assess China’s compliance with the first
phase of the agreement quickly upon his appointment to ensure the
implementation of the deal. Greer also said he would use it as a
starting point in relations with China.</p>
<p>What is the Phase 1 deal?</p>
<p>On January 15, 2020, Trump and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He signed the
Phase 1 agreement, which laid out several terms for trade between the
world’s two biggest economies. The deal called on the United States to
cut some of its imposed tariffs on China and included a commitment from
Beijing to buy more U.S. products and implement certain reforms.</p>
<p>The 96-page agreement, divided into eight sections, placed a big
emphasis on reducing the U.S. trade deficit with China, and protecting
domestic industries by cracking down on Chinese trade practices, such as
nontariff trade barriers, intellectual property violations and the
forced transfer of technology without adequate compensation.</p>
<p>The agreement mandated that China purchase at least $200 billion in
U.S. products and services over a two-year period from January 1, 2020,
to December 31, 2021. It also required that Beijing stop subsidizing
strategic sectors and give fairer treatment to American companies in
terms of regulation.</p>
<p>Despite those commitments from China, data from a report published in
2022 by the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington
showed that Beijing did not reach its purchase target.</p>
<p>The report also showed that Beijing has completed 57% of the spending
laid out in the agreement, a total that is lower than the level of
China’s purchase of goods from the United States before the U.S.-China
trade war.</p>
<p>Although China was not expected to fully meet its commitments, the
agreement did have some benefits for Washington, as it helped decrease
Washington’s trade deficit with Beijing.</p>
<p>Starting point</p>
<p>Analysts say the agreement may be revisited as a starting point for
new trade discussions.</p>
<p>“The two sides need to start somewhere. Phase 1 may at least provide
some common language that both sides will be familiar with so as to get
that ball rolling,” Chad Brown, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute
for International Economics, explained to VOA in an emailed response
Friday.</p>
<p>Denny Roy, a senior fellow at the East-West Center in Hawaii, says
the Phase 1 agreement has two advantages for acting as a foundation for
U.S.-China trade discussions.</p>
<p>“First, the two sides reached a similar agreement before, so they
know it’s feasible,” he told VOA in an emailed response on Friday.</p>
<p>He also explained that using the agreement “suits both sides’
interests.”</p>
<p>“Trump wants to claim he has resolved the bilateral trade imbalance,
which he sees as his primary measure of success,” he explained, noting
that this agreement supports that narrative.</p>
<p>He added that the deal benefits Beijing by allowing China to avoid
making significant structural reforms.</p>
<p>Roy, however, adds that several factors make an agreement between
Washington and Beijing difficult.</p>
<p>“A major bilateral economic deal would depend on avoiding a strategic
crisis, which might occur over Taiwan or the South China Sea, or an
encounter between U.S. and Chinese ships or aircraft that escalates, or
something like the spy balloon incident,” he said.</p>
<p>Early in 2023, the discovery of a Chinese spy balloon floating
through U.S. airspace delayed a U.S. diplomatic visit to the country by
then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken. The ballon was eventually shot
down.</p>

id="arizona-adds-endangered-bat-to-list-of-night-flying-creatures-that-frequent-the-state">Arizona
adds endangered bat to list of night-flying creatures that frequent the
state</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>FLAGSTAFF, ARIZONA — Scientists have long suspected that Mexican
long-nosed bats migrate through southeastern Arizona, but without
capturing and measuring the night-flying creatures, proof has been
elusive. </p>
<p>Researchers say they now have a way to tell the endangered species
apart from other bats by analyzing saliva the nocturnal mammals leave
behind when sipping nectar from plants and residential hummingbird
feeders. </p>
<p>Bat Conservation International, a nonprofit group working to end the
extinction of bat species worldwide, teamed up with residents from
southeastern Arizona, southwestern New Mexico and west Texas for the
saliva-swabbing campaign. </p>
<p>The samples of saliva left along potential migration routes were sent
to a lab at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, where researchers
looked for environmental DNA — or eDNA — to confirm that the bats cycle
through Arizona and consider the region their part-time home. </p>
<p>The Mexican long-nosed bat has been listed as endangered under the
Endangered Species Act since 1988, and is the only one in Arizona with
that federal protection. It is an important species for pollinating
cactus, agave and other desert plants. </p>
<p>Officials from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Arizona
Game and Fish Department announced the discovery in late January. While
expanding Arizona’s list of bat species to 29 is exciting, wildlife
managers say the use of this novel, noninvasive method to nail it down
also deserves to be celebrated. </p>
<p>“If we were trying to identify the species in the absence of eDNA,
biologists could spend hours and hours trying to catch one of these
bats, and even then, you’re not guaranteed to be successful,” said Angie
McIntire, a bat specialist for the Arizona’s Game and Fish Department.
“By sampling the environment, eDNA gives us an additional tool for our
toolkit.” </p>
<p>Every spring, Mexican long-nosed bats traverse a lengthy migratory
path north from Mexico into the southwestern U.S., following the sweet
nectar of their favorite blooming plants like breadcrumbs. They return
along the same route in the fall. </p>
<p>The bat conservation group recruited ordinary citizens for the
mission, giving them kits to swab samples from bird feeders throughout
the summer and fall. </p>
<p>Inside the university lab, microbiology major Anna Riley extracted
the DNA from hundreds of samples and ran them through machines that
ultimately could detect the presence of bats. Part of the work involved
a steady hand, with Riley using a syringe of sorts to transfer diluted
DNA into tiny vials before popping them into a centrifuge. </p>
<p>Sample after sample, vial after vial, the meticulous work took
months. </p>
<p>“There’s a big database that has DNA sequences of not every animal
but most species, and so we could compare our DNA sequences we got from
these samples to what’s in the database,” Riley said. “A little bit like
a Google search — you’ve got your question, you’re asking Google, you
plug it into the database, and it turns up you’ve got a bat, and you
have this kind of bat.” </p>
<p>Kristen Lear, of the conservation group, said the collection of eDNA
has been used successfully for determining the presence of other kinds
of wildlife in various environments, so the group proposed trying it
with bats. </p>
<p>“They do apparently leave behind a lot of spit on these plants and
hummingbird feeders,” Lear said.</p>

id="cases-of-measles-in-texas-county-with-numerous-vaccine-exemptions">15
cases of measles in Texas county with numerous vaccine exemptions</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Fifteen measles cases — mostly in school-aged children — have been
confirmed in a small county in West Texas with one of the highest rates
of vaccine exemptions in the state.</p>
<p>South Plains Public Health District Director Zach Holbrooks said
Monday that his department was first notified in late January about the
first two cases in Gaines County, which he said were “two children who
had seen a physician in Lubbock.”</p>
<p>Some of the cases appear to be connected to private religious schools
in the district, said Holbrooks, who cautioned that the investigation is
ongoing.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t say they’re all connected, but our teams are looking into
exposure sites and the background of those cases,” he said.</p>
<p>Local health officials set up a drive-through vaccination clinic last
week and are offering screening services to residents.</p>
<p>The U.S. saw a rise in measles cases in 2024, including an outbreak
in Chicago that sickened more than 60. This month, health officials in
metro Atlanta are working to contain a measles case that spread to two
unvaccinated family members.</p>
<p>Texas law allows children to get an exemption from school vaccines
for reasons of conscience, including religious beliefs.</p>
<p>The percentage of kids with exemptions has risen over the last decade
from .76% in 2014 to 2.32% last year, according to Texas Department of
State Health Services data.</p>
<p>Gaines County has one of the highest rates in Texas of school-aged
children who opt out of at least one required vaccine: Nearly 14% of
children from kindergarten through grade 12 had an exemption in the
2023-24 school year, which is more than five times the state average of
2.32% and beyond the national rate of 3.3%.</p>
<p>But the number of unvaccinated kids in the county is likely
significantly higher, DSHS spokesperson Lara Anton said, because Gaines
County has many children who are homeschooled and whose data would not
be reported.</p>
<p>The measles, mumps and rubella vaccines are a two-shot series: The
first is recommended at 12 to 15 months old and second between 4 to 6
years old. The vaccine is required to attend most public schools in the
U.S.</p>
<p>But vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the COVID-19
pandemic and most states are below the 95% vaccination threshold for
kindergartners — the level needed to protect communities against measles
outbreaks. Lawmakers across the country have proposed various vaccine
requirement changes at a time when anti-vaccine activist Robert F.
Kennedy Jr. is awaiting confirmation as the secretary of Health and
Human Services.</p>
<p>One of the early Gaines County cases traveled to neighboring New
Mexico while they were still infectious, Anton said, but there were no
immediate reports of infection. New Mexico Department of Health
spokesperson Robert Nott said the agency has been in communication with
Texas officials but there was no known exposure to measles in his
state.</p>
<p>“We’re going to watch this very closely,” Nott said.</p>
<p>Two cases of measles were reported in early January in the Houston
area, but Holbrooks said the West Texas cases don’t appear to be
connected.</p>
<p>Measles is a highly contagious virus that can survive in the air for
up to two hours. Up to 9 out of 10 people who are susceptible will get
the virus if exposed, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention. Before the vaccine was introduced in 1963, the U.S. saw
some 3 million to 4 million cases per year. Now, it’s usually fewer than
200 in a normal year.</p>

judge keeps block on Trump federal buyout plan in place for now</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BOSTON/WASHINGTON — A U.S. judge kept his block on President Donald
Trump’s buyout plan for federal employees in place on Monday while he
considers whether to impose it for a longer period of time. </p>
<p>The decision by U.S. District Judge George O’Toole in Boston prevents
Trump’s administration from implementing the buyout plan for now, giving
a temporary victory to labor unions that have sued to stop it
entirely. </p>
<p>More than 2 million federal civilian employees had faced a midnight
deadline Monday to accept the proposal. It is unclear when O’Toole will
rule on the request by the unions. </p>
<p>The buyout effort is part of a far-reaching plan by Trump and his
allies to reduce the size and rein in the actions of the federal
bureaucracy. Trump, who returned to the presidency on Jan. 20, has
accused the federal workforce of undercutting his agenda during his
first term in office, from 2017 to 2021. </p>
<p>Unions have urged their members not to accept the buyout offer —
saying Trump’s administration cannot be trusted to honor it — but about
65,000 federal employees had signed up for the buyouts as of Friday,
according to a White House official. </p>
<p>Reuters has been unable to independently verify that number, which
does not include a breakdown of workers from each agency. </p>
<p>The offer promises to pay employees their regular salaries and
benefits until October without requiring them to work, but that may not
be ironclad. Current spending laws expire on March 14, and there is no
guarantee that salaries would be funded beyond that point. </p>
<p>At a court hearing, U.S. Justice Department attorney Eric Hamilton
called the buyout plan a “humane off-ramp” for those frustrated by
Trump’s decision to reduce the size of the workforce and end the ability
of many of them to work from home. </p>
<p>But a lawyer for the unions said the plan had been carried out in a
“slap dash” fashion with little regard to how it might disrupt
operations at agencies such as the Department of Veterans Affairs. </p>
<p>“They failed to consider the continued functioning of government,”
lawyer Elena Goldstein said. </p>
<p>The administration had initially proposed a deadline of last Thursday
before O’Toole, an appointee of Democratic former President Bill
Clinton, extended it so he could consider the case. </p>
<p>Trump has tasked Tesla CEO and SpaceX founder Elon Musk, the world’s
richest person, with overseeing the purge of federal employees through
his Department of Government Efficiency, which is not an actual
government agency. </p>
<p>Musk’s actions have sown panic among federal workers and prompted
public protests. His actions also have led to a flood of calls to U.S.
lawmakers by voters worried about the access that Musk’s team has been
given to sensitive information in government computer systems that
contain data on federal payments to Americans and personal details of
federal workers. </p>
<p>Several lawsuits </p>
<p>The unions and Democratic attorneys general have brought lawsuits
challenging Trump’s rapid remaking of government and won some initial
victories. </p>
<p>A union that represents Consumer Financial Protection Bureau workers
has filed a lawsuit seeking to block acting chief Russell Vought’s move
to suspend CFPB activities, one of several legal challenges that Trump’s
administration now faces. </p>
<p>Democratic attorneys general from 22 U.S. states filed a lawsuit on
Monday in Boston challenging sharp cuts to federal grant funding for
universities, medical centers and other research institutions by the
Trump administration. </p>
<p>An effort to hollow out the U.S. Agency for International Development
is partially on hold after a judge’s ruling. </p>
<p>Trump’s effort to freeze trillions of dollars in federal loans,
grants and other financial assistance has also been paused in a separate
case. A federal judge in Rhode Island on Monday ruled that the
administration must restore all domestic funding while he considers the
case. </p>
<p>On Saturday, a judge temporarily blocked Musk’s entity from accessing
government systems used to process trillions of dollars in payments at
the Treasury Department.</p>

<h2 id="trump-signs-executive-orders-on-steel-aluminum-tariffs">Trump
signs executive orders on steel, aluminum tariffs</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — President Donald Trump moved to substantially raise
tariffs on steel and aluminum imports on Monday, canceling exemptions
and duty-free quotas for major suppliers Canada, Mexico, Brazil and
other countries in a move that could boost the risk of a multifront
trade war. </p>
<p>Trump signed proclamations that raised the tariff rate on aluminum
imports to 25% from the previous 10% that he imposed in 2018 to aid the
struggling sector. His action reinstates a 25% tariff on millions of
tons of steel imports and aluminum imports that had been entering the
U.S. duty free under quota deals, exemptions and thousands of product
exclusions. </p>
<p>The proclamations were extensions of Trump’s 2018 Section 232
national security tariffs to protect steel and aluminum makers. A White
House official said the exemptions had eroded the effectiveness of these
measures. </p>
<p>Trump also will impose a new North American standard requiring steel
imports to be “melted and poured” and aluminum to be “smelted and cast”
in the region to curb imports of minimally processed Chinese steel into
the U.S. </p>
<p>The order also targets downstream steel products that use imported
steel for tariffs. </p>
<p>Trump’s trade adviser Peter Navarro said the measures would help U.S.
steel and aluminum producers and shore up America’s economic and
national security. </p>
<p>“The steel and aluminum tariffs 2.0 will put an end to foreign
dumping, boost domestic production and secure our steel and aluminum
industries as the backbone and pillar industries of America’s economic
and national security,” he told reporters. </p>
<p>“This isn’t just about trade. It’s about ensuring that America never
has to rely on foreign nations for critical industries like steel and
aluminum.” </p>
<p>Trump first broached the steel and aluminum action on Sunday, adding
that he would also announce a further set of reciprocal tariffs later in
the week, drawing warnings of retaliation from trade partners.</p>

US deportation flights head to Venezuela, alleged gang members
aboard</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Two planes carrying Venezuelan migrants deported from the United
States — the first since a January deal between the administration of
U.S. President Donald Trump and Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro —
are heading to Venezuela, the South American country’s government said
Monday. </p>
<p>The flights, run by Venezuelan airline Conviasa, are part of a plan
to repatriate thousands of migrants who fled Venezuela “because of
economic sanctions and the campaigns of psychological warfare against
our country,” the government statement said. </p>
<p>Some of the people on the flight are allegedly involved in illegal
activities with the Tren de Aragua gang, the statement said and will be
vigorously investigated for criminal ties. </p>
<p>Trump envoy Richard Grenell met with Maduro in Caracas on Jan. 31,
where the two men discussed migration and sanctions, among other issues.
Grenell left the South American country with six Americans who had been
held by Venezuelan authorities. </p>
<p>The Trump administration has said it is a priority to deport members
of Tren de Aragua from the U.S. and Trump himself said after Grenell’s
visit that Maduro agreed to receive all Venezuelan illegal migrants and
provide for their transportation back home. </p>
<p>The Venezuelan government says it destroyed Tren de Aragua within its
borders in 2023. </p>
<p>Trump’s administration has also moved to remove deportation
protection from about 348,000 Venezuelans in the U.S., who could lose
work permits and then be deported in April. </p>
<p>More than 7 million Venezuelan migrants have left their country in
recent years amid a sustained economic and social collapse blamed by the
government on sanctions by the United States and others. </p>
<p>Maduro and several allies have been indicted by the United States on
drug trafficking charges and international observers and the country’s
opposition say a July election which gave Maduro his third term was
fraudulent.</p>

id="trump-calls-for-halting-penny-production-saying-its-too-expensive">Trump
calls for halting penny production, saying it’s too expensive</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>RICHMOND, VIRGINIA — The lowly penny, the forgotten mainstay of coin
jars and car cupholders everywhere, may soon be no more.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump announced Sunday he’s ordered his
administration to cease production of the 1-cent coin, whose buying
power is long past its prime.</p>
<p>Advocates for ditching the penny cite its high production cost —
currently almost 4 cents per penny, according to the U.S. Mint — and
limited utility. Fans of the penny cite its usefulness in charity drives
and relative bargain in production costs compared with the nickel, which
costs almost 14 cents to mint.</p>
<p>Trump’s surprise order comes after decades of unsuccessful efforts to
pitch the penny.</p>
<p>“Only tradition explains our stubborn attachment to the penny. But
sometimes traditions get ridiculous,” the Farmers’ Almanac said in its
1989 edition.</p>
<p>Here’s a look at some questions surrounding Trump’s order.</p>
<p>Can Trump really order the Treasury to stop minting pennies without
Congress’ approval?</p>
<p>Yes, according to legal scholar Laurence H. Tribe, the Carl M. Loeb
University Professor of Constitutional Law Emeritus at Harvard
University.</p>
<p>U.S. code gives the Treasury Secretary the authority to mint and
issue coins “in amounts the secretary decides are necessary to meet the
needs of the United States.”</p>
<p>If Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent decides the amount necessary for
the penny is zero, he’s within his legal rights, Tribe said.</p>
<p>“Unlike a lot of what the new administration has been doing pursuant
to the flood of executive orders since January 20, this action seems to
me entirely lawful and fully constitutional,” Tribe said, referring to
the aggressive executive action Trump’s taken on other issues since
taking office.</p>
<p>Congress, which dictates currency specifications like the size and
metal content of coins, could make Trump’s order permanent through law.
But past congressional efforts to ditch the penny have failed.</p>
<p>Pennies are mostly made of zinc, and the American zinc lobby has been
a major opponent to suggestions that the penny be eliminated.</p>
<p>How many pennies are in circulation?</p>
<p>It depends on what you mean by circulation.</p>
<p>Pennies are the most popular coin made by the U.S. Mint, which
reported making 3.2 billion of them last year. That’s more than half of
all the new coins it made last year.</p>
<p>MIT Professor Jeff Gore, who founded Citizens to Retire the Penny,
said coins are supposed to stay in circulation for about 30 years and
that in the last three decades the U.S. Mint has made about 250 billion
pennies.</p>
<p>But, he says, “because nobody wants to use pennies, they fall out of
active circulation much faster than other coins.”</p>
<p>If pennies sit in drawer for a decade, Gore asks, “Does that qualify
as being in circulation?”</p>
<p>Will Americans miss pennies?</p>
<p>Experience in other countries suggests no.</p>
<p>Canada started phasing out its penny a dozen years ago and urged
store owners to round prices to the nearest nickel for cash
transactions. Electronic purchases were still billed to the nearest
cent. The move came after New Zealand, Australia, the Netherlands and
others dropped their lowest-denomination coins.</p>
<p>After dropping the penny or its equivalent, those countries have not
looked back.</p>
<p>What comes next?</p>
<p>Trump’s order, which he announced in a social media post as he was
departing New Orleans after watching the first half of the Super Bowl,
was the latest in his administration’s rapid-fire efforts to cut
government costs.</p>
<p>“Let’s rip the waste out of our great nation’s budget, even if it’s a
penny at a time,” Trump wrote in his post, which was light on details
about plans for a post-penny future.</p>
<p>After Canada stopped minting new pennies, it began recycling them for
their “valuable” copper and zinc, according to a 2022 report from the
Canadian Mint.</p>

id="boston-man-cleared-of-us-charges-he-acted-as-chinese-agent">Boston
man cleared of US charges he acted as Chinese agent</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Boston — A jury found a Boston man not guilty on Monday of U.S.
charges that he acted as an unlawful agent of China’s government by
supplying officials information about individuals, dissidents and groups
in the local Chinese community. </p>
<p>Litang Liang, 65, was acquitted in federal court of charges that he
acted as an unregistered Chinese agent in a case brought in 2023 that
U.S. authorities had portrayed as part of their commitment to counter
efforts by China’s government ato silence its critics abroad. </p>
<p>Liang, a China-born U.S. citizen, had denied the charges and pleaded
not guilty. His lawyer during the trial called the charges “ridiculous”
and called them an effort to chill the free speech of a local community
activist who advocated for the “reunification” of democratically
governed Taiwan with mainland China – a view in harmony with China’s
leaders. </p>
<p>“Justice has finally arrived,” Liang told reporters through a
translator following the verdict. </p>
<p>U.S. Attorney Leah Foley, whose office pursued the case, said in a
statement that while prosecutors “respect the jury’s decision, we are
disappointed in (Monday’s) verdict.” </p>
<p>Liang had worked at a hotel and for years had been an active member
in his union as well as a community organizer and activist in the
Chinese-American community in Boston, according to his lawyer, Derege
Demissie. </p>
<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Timothy Kistner told jurors on Friday during
closing arguments in the case that China’s government sought out Liang
because it “wanted someone already involved in the community who knew
the people who were there.” </p>
<p>Prosecutors said Liang from 2018 to 2022 provided Chinese officials
with information on individuals and shared details about dissidents and
groups with pro-Taiwan leanings. </p>
<p>Prosecutors said that in 2018, after traveling to Beijing for
meetings with an arm of the Chinese Communist Party, Liang founded the
New England Alliance for the Peaceful Unification of China, which
focused on promoting China’s goals with Taiwan. </p>
<p>China views democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory.
Taiwan rejects Beijing’s sovereignty claims, saying only the island’s
people can decide their future. </p>
<p>Prosecutors said Liang, also at the direction of Chinese officials,
in 2019 organized a counter-demonstration against pro-democracy
protesters, and in 2022 provided an official with a Chinese agency,
tasked with investigating political dissidents, information on two
potential local recruits. </p>
<p>Demissie in his closing argument to the jury countered that Liang
made no secret of his activism and that his prosecution infringed on
Liang’s right to free speech under the U.S. Constitution’s First
Amendment. </p>
<p>“This case would have meant nothing if it did not involve China,”
Demissie said. “That’s what this is about. And it had the purpose of
scaring people, and it achieved that purpose.”</p>

judge says Trump administration violated order lifting spending
freeze</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A U.S. judge on Monday said President Donald Trump’s administration
violated a court order lifting a broad freeze on federal spending and
directed the government to immediately release any withheld funds. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge John McConnell in Providence, Rhode Island, had
already blocked the funding freeze with a temporary restraining order on
Jan. 31, but a group of Democratic state attorneys general who sued to
block the move said last week that the government was still withholding
funds. </p>
<p>The Trump administration on Monday said it is appealing. </p>
<p>“The broad categorical and sweeping freeze of federal funds is, as
the court found, likely unconstitutional and has caused and continues to
cause irreparable harm to a vast portion of this country,” McConnell
said on Monday. “These pauses in funding violate the plain text of the
TRO.” </p>
<p>McConnell said all funding must be restored at least until he can
hold a hearing on the states’ motion for a longer-term order. </p>
<p>On Feb. 6, a lawyer with the office of Democratic New York Attorney
General Letitia James told McConnell that state agencies were still
having difficulty accessing federal funds, including billions of dollars
for infrastructure projects under the Inflation Reduction Act. </p>
<p>The Trump administration had told states it believed the order did
not apply to certain environmental and infrastructure spending, and that
some payments were delayed for “operational and administrative
reasons.” </p>
<p>However, McConnell said his order had been “clear and unambiguous” in
applying to all funding frozen in response to sweeping executive orders
by Trump. </p>
<p>The states originally sued the administration over a memorandum from
the White House’s Office of Management and Budget announcing a
wide-ranging freeze of federal spending. Soon after the lawsuit was
filed, OMB rescinded that memo. </p>
<p>The memo was part of a larger Trump administration push to tighten
federal spending and reshape the federal bureaucracy, which has sparked
a flurry of lawsuits. </p>
<p>In a separate case over Trump’s push to dismantle the U.S. Agency for
International Development, federal employee unions have accused the
administration of violating a court order reinstating USAID workers who
were placed on administrative leave.</p>

<p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to visit the U.S. on
Wednesday. President Donald Trump announced Modi’s White House visit as

Minister Wang Yi in Beijing, where they agreed to restore bilateral ties
and resume direct flights and pilgrimages by Indian pilgrims to a holy

<p>While Modi’s government has shifted toward populist policies, China
launched an aggressive public relations campaign in 2024 to improve its

to the deepening U.S.-India partnership and Beijing’s desire to maintain
regional influence, particularly given expected tensions with the Trump
administration. </p>

Persian: With no new nuclear deal, Iran to remain under maximum
pressure, US says</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The restored maximum pressure campaign on Iran will continue if it
does not want a new nuclear deal, the ‌State Department said, while
reiterating Washington’s commitment to preventing Iran from acquiring a
nuclear weapon. </p>
<p>“If the Iranian regime does not want a deal, the president is clear,
Iran will remain under the restored maximum pressure campaign,” a State
Department spokesperson told VOA Persian on Monday, referring to
President Donald Trump’s willingness to discuss a new deal with
Iran. </p>
<p>Trump wrote on Truth Social that he seeks a “Verified Nuclear Peace
Agreement, which will let Iran peacefully grow and prosper” in return
for ensuring that the Islamic Republic “cannot have a Nuclear
Weapon.” </p>

<h2 id="us-defense-chief-headed-to-europe-for-nato-ukraine-meetings">US
defense chief headed to Europe for NATO, Ukraine meetings</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Pentagon — New U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is headed to
Europe, his first international trip since taking office last month.</p>
<p>Hegseth departed from Joint Base Andrews, just outside of Washington,
early Monday, for stops in Germany, Belgium and Poland.</p>
<p>In Germany, the defense secretary is scheduled to visit the
headquarters for U.S. European Command, and U.S. Africa Command, getting
updates on developments in both regions. </p>
<p>From Germany, Hegseth will travel to Brussels for the NATO Defense
Ministerial and a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group on
Wednesday and Thursday.</p>
<p>U.S. defense officials say Hegseth is expected to press U.S. allies
in Europe to increase their defense spending and take more of a
leadership role for challenges facing Europe.</p>
<p>He is also expected to echo U.S. President Donald Trump’s call for a
diplomatic end to the war between Russia and Ukraine, which is about to
enter its third year.</p>
<p>The meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group — a group of almost
50 countries who have pledged to support Ukraine in its efforts to repel
Russia — is the first to take place during the new Trump administration
and will be the first led by a country other than the U.S.</p>
<p>This week’s meeting, the 26th, will be led by Britain.</p>
<p>Britain’s Defense Ministry, in a statement Thursday said the meeting
will focus on “priorities for Ukraine as the international community
continues to work together to support Ukraine in its fight against
[Russian President Vladimir] Putin’s illegal invasion.”</p>
<p>The Pentagon, in a statement previewing Hegseth’s participation in
the meeting, said in addition to emphasizing Trump’s push for a
diplomatic resolution to the war, the secretary, “will also highlight
the need for increased European leadership on security assistance to
Ukraine.”</p>
<p>Following the meetings in Brussels, Hegseth is scheduled to travel to
Poland to meet with leaders there and visit with U.S. troops.</p>
<p>Of note, the U.S. defense secretary said he is skipping the annual
Munich Security Conference in Germany, which bills itself as “the
world’s leading forum for debating international security policy,” which
gets underway Friday.</p>
<p>“We’re not going to the Munich Security Conference,” Hegseth told
defense officials and troops at a town hall meeting last Friday at the
Pentagon.</p>
<p>“We’re instead going to Poland to see the troops out there and we’re
going to Germany to see EUCOM and AFRICOM,” he said. “I would much
rather talk to troops than go to cocktail parties. That’s my job.”</p>
<p>Instead, the U.S. is set to be represented in Munich by Vice
President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.</p>

id="opening-statements-begin-in-trial-of-man-accused-of-trying-to-kill-salman-rushdie">Opening
statements begin in trial of man accused of trying to kill Salman
Rushdie</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Mayville, New York — Lawyers began delivering opening statements
Monday at the trial of the man charged with trying to fatally stab
author Salman Rushdie in front of a lecture audience in western New
York.  </p>
<p>Rushdie, 77, is expected to testify during the trial of Hadi Matar,
bringing the writer face-to-face with his knife-wielding attacker for
the first time in more than two years.  </p>
<p>Rushdie, the Booker Prize-winning author, had been about to speak
about keeping writers safe from harm in August 2022 when Matar ran
toward him on the stage at the Chautauqua Institution Amphitheater.
Matar stabbed Rushdie more than a dozen times in the neck, stomach,
chest, hand and right eye, leaving him partially blind and with
permanent damage to one hand. </p>
<p>The Indian-born British-American author detailed the attack and his
long, painful recovery in a memoir, “Knife: Meditations After an
Attempted Murder,” released last year. Rushdie had worried for his
safety since his 1989 novel “The Satanic Verses” was denounced as
blasphemous by many Muslims and led to Iran’s Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini issuing a fatwa calling for his death.  </p>
<p>Rushdie spent years in hiding, but had traveled freely over the past
quarter century after Iran announced it would not enforce the decree.
 </p>
<p>The trial is taking place as the 36th anniversary of the fatwa —
Feb. 14, 1989 — approaches.  </p>
<p>Matar, 27, of Fairview, New Jersey, is charged with attempted murder
and assault. He has pleaded not guilty.  </p>
<p>A jury was selected last week. Matar was in court throughout the
three-day process, taking notes and consulting with his attorneys. He
calmly said, “Free Palestine” while being led in to court Monday past
members of the media taking photographs and video.  </p>
<p>Matar’s defense faced a challenging start after it was announced that
his lawyer, Nathaniel Barone, was hospitalized with an undisclosed
illness and would not attend the start of the trial.  </p>
<p>Judge David Foley refused a defense request to postpone opening
statements, instead instructing an associate of Barone to deliver the
defense’s opening statement in his place.</p>
<p>Once testimony is underway, the trial is expected to last a week to
10 days. Jurors will be shown video and photos from the day of the
attack, which ended when onlookers rushed Matar and held him until
police arrived.  </p>
<p>The event’s moderator, Henry Reese, co-founder of City of Asylum in
Pittsburgh, was also wounded. Matar told investigators he traveled by
bus to Chautauqua, about 120 kilometers south of Buffalo. He is believed
to have slept in the grounds of the arts and academic retreat the night
before the attack.  </p>
<p>Matar’s attorney has not indicated what his defense will be. In a
separate indictment, federal authorities allege Matar was motivated by a
terrorist organization’s endorsement of a fatwa, or edict, calling for
Rushdie’s death.  </p>
<p>A later trial on the federal charges — terrorism transcending
national boundaries, providing material support to terrorists and
attempting to provide material support to a terrorist organization —
will be scheduled in U.S. District Court in Buffalo.  </p>
<p>Rushdie has been one of the world’s most celebrated authors since the
1981 publication of “Midnight’s Children,” winner of the Booker Prize.
His other works include the novels “Shame” and “Victory City,” which he
had completed shortly before the 2022 stabbing, and the 2012 memoir
“Joseph Anton,” in which he wrote about his time in hiding.</p>
<p>In the federal indictment, authorities allege Matar believed the
edict was backed by the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah and
endorsed in a 2006 speech by the group’s then-leader, Hassan
Nasrallah.</p>

id="third-federal-judge-blocks-trumps-birthright-citizenship-order">Third
federal judge blocks Trump’s birthright citizenship order</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Concord, New Hampshire — A third federal judge on Monday blocked
President Donald Trump’s executive order ending birthright citizenship
for the children of people who are in the U.S. illegally.  </p>
<p>The ruling from U.S. District Judge Joseph N. Laplante in New
Hampshire comes after two similar rulings by judges in Seattle and
Maryland last week. A lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties
Union contends that Trump’s order violates the Constitution and
“attempts to upend one of the most fundamental American constitutional
values.”  </p>
<p>Trump’s Republican administration has asserted that children of
noncitizens are not “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States
and therefore are not entitled to citizenship.  </p>
<p>The administration is appealing the Seattle judge’s block on Trump’s
executive order.  </p>
<p>At the heart of the lawsuits in the three cases is the 14th Amendment
to the Constitution, ratified in 1868 after the Civil War and the Dred
Scott Supreme Court decision, which held that Scott, an enslaved man,
wasn’t a citizen despite having lived in a state where slavery was
outlawed.  </p>
<p>In 1898, in a case known as United States v. Wong Kim Ark, the U.S.
Supreme Court found the only children who did not automatically receive
U.S. citizenship upon being born on U.S. soil were children of
diplomats, who have allegiance to another government; enemies present in
the U.S. during hostile occupation; those born on foreign ships; and
those born to members of sovereign Native American tribes.  </p>
<p>The U.S. is among about 30 countries where birthright citizenship —
the principle of jus soli, or “right of the soil” — is applied. Most are
in the Americas and Canada and Mexico are among them.</p>

grants request to block detained Venezuelan immigrants from being sent
to Guantanamo</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — A federal court on Sunday blocked the Trump
administration from sending three Venezuelan immigrants held in New
Mexico to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba as part of the president’s
immigration crackdown.</p>
<p>In a legal filing earlier in the day, lawyers for the men said the
detainees “fit the profile of those the administration has prioritized
for detention in Guantanamo, i.e. Venezuelan men detained in the El Paso
area with (false) charges of connections with the Tren de Aragua
gang.”</p>
<p>It asked a U.S. District Court in New Mexico for a temporary
restraining order blocking their transfer, adding that “the mere
uncertainty the government has created surrounding the availability of
legal process and counsel access is sufficient to authorize the modest
injunction.”</p>
<p>During a brief hearing, Judge Kenneth J. Gonzales granted the
temporary order, which was opposed by the government, said Jessica
Vosburgh, an attorney for the three men.</p>
<p>“It’s short term. This will get revisited and further fleshed out in
the weeks to come,” Vosburgh told The Associated Press.</p>
<p>A message seeking comment was left for U.S. Customs and Immigration
Enforcement.</p>
<p>The filing came as part of a lawsuit on behalf of the three men filed
by the Center for Constitutional Rights, the American Civil Liberties
Union of New Mexico, and Las Americas Immigrant Advisory Center.</p>
<p>The Tren de Aragua gang originated in a lawless prison in the central
Venezuelan state of Aragua more than a decade ago and has expanded in
recent years as millions of desperate Venezuelans fled President
President Nicolás Maduro ’s rule and migrated to other parts of Latin
America or the U.S.</p>
<p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said last week that flights
of detainees had landed at Guantanamo. Immigrant rights groups sent a
letter Friday demanding access to people who have been sent there,
saying the base should not be used as a “legal black hole.”</p>
<p>White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday that more
than 8,000 people have been arrested in immigration enforcement actions
since Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration.</p>
<p>Trump has vowed to deport millions of the estimated 11.7 million
people in the U.S. illegally.</p>

<h2 id="anora-wins-at-producers-and-directors-guild-awards">‘Anora’ wins
at Producers and Directors Guild Awards</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Did a wide-open Oscar race just get a front runner?</p>
<p>Sean Baker’s Brooklyn comedy “Anora” took top honors at both the
Producers Guild Awards and the Directors Guild Awards on Saturday night,
catapulting it to Oscar favorite status with wins from a pair of closely
watched Academy Awards precursors.</p>
<p>Hollywood’s award season has been uncharacteristically up for grabs
with half a dozen films viewed as legitimate best-picture contenders.
Some had pegged “Anora” as the front runner going into the season after
the film, starring Mikey Madison as a Brooklyn exotic dancer who marries
the son of a Russian oligarch, won the Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film
Festival.</p>
<p>But after several films took turns in the spotlight, including Golden
Globe winners “The Brutalist” and “Emilia Perez,” “Anora” reemerged in a
big way over the weekend. Baker’s film also won best picture at the
Critics Choice Awards on Friday.</p>
<p>Both guild ceremonies were held in Beverly Hills, California. The
PGA’s top prize, the Darryl F. Zanuck Award, has matched the Oscar
winner for best picture in 16 of the last 21 years. Since 2009, when the
guild and the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences both adopted
a preferential ballot to pick a winner from 10 nominees, they’ve
corresponded all but three times.</p>
<p>The DGA is similarly predictive. In the past 74 years, 66 winners
have gone on to triumph at the Oscars. That makes Baker the favorite for
best director in a field entirely composed of first-time nominees.</p>
<p>The guild also named RaMell Ross’ “Nickel Boys” best first film.
Ross’ movie, nominated for best picture by the Oscars, is his narrative
film debut.</p>
<p>Oscar voting begins Tuesday. Jacques Audiard’s “Emilia Perez” is the
lead nominee with 13 nominations, but the Netflix film has seen its
chances crater following multiple waves of backlash and controversy.</p>
<p>Another Oscar category also found clarity over the weekend. On
Saturday at the Annie Awards, DreamWorks Animation’s “The Wild Robot”
cleaned up with nine awards including best film. “The Wild Robot” will
be the heavy favorite to win best animated film at the March 2 Academy
Awards.</p>

id="super-bowl-commercials-rely-on-comedy-nostalgia-to-avoid-potential-missteps">Super
Bowl commercials rely on comedy, nostalgia to avoid potential
missteps</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Most of the commercials airing during this year’s Super Bowl are
going for laughs, with advertisers betting that America could use a
little break.</p>
<p>As the Philadelphia Eagles and the Kansas City Chiefs hit the field
in New Orleans, a parade of silly ads will hit airwaves Sunday. Many
companies put their ads online ahead of the game, but some held out to
maintain an element of surprise.</p>
<p>Humor dominates in the ads released so far. Four old ladies go on a
joy ride with WeatherTech, while Eugene Levy’s eyebrows fly off and buzz
around after he eats some Little Caesars. Sloths have a case of the
Mondays in an ad for Coors Light. A man’s tongue starts dancing to
celebrate cold foam from Nestlé Coffee Mate. British singer Seal becomes
an actual seal, sad that he can’t hold Mountain Dew with his
flippers.</p>
<p>Actor Glenn Powell does a take on Goldilocks for Ram Trucks, while
comedian Nate Bargatze clones himself and hires an opera singer because
he saved so much money using DoorDash. Shaboozey takes a lighthearted
stroll through New Orleans for Nerds, while the stars of the “Fast and
Furious” franchise take a slow cruise in a convertible so they can enjoy
Häagen-Dazs ice cream bars.</p>
<p>Tim Calkins, a professor of marketing at Northwestern University’s
Kellogg School of Management, said this was a complicated Super Bowl for
advertisers.</p>
<p>Most ads were in development during last fall’s U.S. presidential
election race, so avoiding controversy was even more of a priority than
usual, Calkins said. The finalized crop of commercials features a lot of
simple humor, nostalgia and few creative risks, he said. But even that
approach can backfire.</p>
<p>“That’s the challenge this year. Everybody wants to be safe, but you
also want to be interesting,” Calkins said. “Safe advertising isn’t the
advertising you notice or remember.”</p>
<p>And advertisers can’t afford not to be noticed. Some of the roughly
80 Super Bowl ads spots cost a record $8 million for 30 seconds this
year.</p>
<p>Here are some of the themes of this year’s Super Bowl ads:</p>
<p>Heartwarming nostalgia</p>
<p>Budweiser brings back its Clydesdales for its Super Bowl ad,
including a foal that wants to join the delivery team. Meg Ryan and
Billy Crystal reenact their famous scene from 1989’s “When Harry Met
Sally,” except this time Sally is expressing her enthusiasm for
Hellmann’s mayonnaise.</p>
<p>The Muppets search for accommodations with Booking.com, while an
Instacart ad features a parade of familiar mascots like Mr. Clean, the
Jolly Green Giant and the Pillsbury Doughboy. Disney asks what the world
would be like without the iconic characters it owns, like Elsa from
“Frozen,” Bart Simpson and the Marvel superheroes.</p>
<p>Advertisers are leaning on nostalgia more than they used to in Super
Bowl ads, according to Kimberly Whitler, a marketing professor at the
University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business. Nods to the past can
broaden the appeal of an ad to different generations and connect
products to positive cultural moments, she said.</p>
<p>Celebrity mashups</p>
<p>Putting celebrities together in unexpected combinations can also
broaden the appeal of a commercial. In their Super Bowl ad for Michelob
Ultra, actors Catherine O’Hara and Willem Dafoe are pickleball champs.
Soccer star David Beckham and actor Matt Damon are long-lost twins who
bond over Stella Artois. Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay and comedian Pete
Davidson team up for a HexClad commercial, while Post Malone, Shane
Gillis and Peyton Manning have a block party with Bud Light. A slew of
celebrities, including Matthew McConaughey, Martha Stewart, Greta Gerwig
and Charlie XCX, appear in an ad for Uber Eats.</p>
<p>Linli Xu, an associate professor of marketing at the University of
Minnesota’s Carlson School of Management, said celebrity endorsements
can get people talking. But with dozens of brands using them, there’s a
risk of diminishing returns.</p>
<p>Celebrities can also get so much attention that viewers don’t
remember which brand they’re advertising, Xu said.</p>
<p>Serious moments</p>
<p>It isn’t all fun and games at the Super Bowl this year.
Pharmaceutical company Novartis urges women to get early detection for
breast cancer. Dove warns that half of girls who quit sports have been
criticized for their body type. Hims &amp; Hers, a telehealth company,
talks about America’s obesity epidemic.</p>
<p>For the third Super Bowl in a row, Come Near — a nonprofit that
promotes the teachings of Jesus — is running an ad as part of its He
Gets Us campaign. The ad, featuring Johnny Cash’s cover of “Personal
Jesus,” shows everyday people being helpful and heroic. And the
Foundation to Combat Antisemitism, founded by New England Patriots
Chairman and CEO Robert Kraft, has a stark ad featuring Snoop Dogg and
Tom Brady saying what they hate about each other, in an effort to show
how pointless hate is.</p>
<p>Xu said she expected more ads promoting that unifying message. But
for the most part, advertisers went with humor, she said.</p>
<p>“We just had an election year and there’s a lot of discussion around
divisiveness,” she said. “People might be wanting to see some unity,
everybody coming together as a country.”</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence arrives</p>
<p>Several Super Bowl ads make the case for AI as a helpmate. Chris
Pratt, Chris Hemsworth and Kris Jenner team up for an ad wearing Meta ’s
smart glasses, which use artificial intelligence to answer questions
about what wearers are seeing. Actor Walton Goggins pitches GoDaddy
Airo, which uses AI to help build websites and social content. And
Google’s “50 States, 50 Stories” campaign will show viewers a small
business from their state that’s using Google’s Gemini AI assistant. But
Cirkul, a water bottle brand, pokes fun at AI, showing comedian Adam
Devine accidentally ordering 100,000 bottles using the AI assistant on
his phone.</p>

id="westminster-shows-canine-athletes-get-their-piece-of-super-bowl-weekend">Westminster
show’s canine athletes get their piece of Super Bowl weekend</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — They’re at the top of their sport. They run, weave and go
airborne. And they went all out for this weekend’s championship.</p>
<p>Sorry — no, they’re not the Chiefs or the Eagles. They’re the agility
dogs at the Westminster Kennel Club show, which began Saturday by
showcasing agility and other dog sports.</p>
<p>Dog folk often call Westminster the Super Bowl of dog shows, and the
comparison might be especially fitting this year. The United States’
most prestigious canine competition opened on the same weekend as pro
football’s Super Bowl, which features the Kansas City Chiefs and the
Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday. The rare coincidence comes after both
competitions’ dates shifted in recent years.</p>
<p>“I always said I wanted people to call the Super Bowl ‘the
Westminster of football,’” quipped dog expert David Frei, who has a foot
in both worlds: He used to work in publicity for the Denver Broncos and
the San Francisco 49ers.</p>
<p>The Westminster of football? Well, Westminster is 90 years older than
the Super Bowl, after all.</p>
<p>And there have been some other connections between the gridiron and
Westminster’s green carpet. Los Angeles Chargers defensive end Morgan
Fox co-owns a French bulldog who came within a smushy-nose length of
winning at Westminster in 2022 and was a finalist the following year.
(Many other NFL players also have dogs for fun, if not for show,
including Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes.)</p>
<p>Whatever the analogy, being at Westminster was a triumph for Guster
the rescue pug. He and owner Steve Martin took up agility after Guster
started wagging his tail and tilting his head while they watched the
Westminster agility contest on TV several years ago.</p>
<p>“We never thought we’d be here. And now we’re here,” Martin, of
Austin, Texas, said Saturday.</p>
<p>A border collie named Vanish won the contest, which featured about
300 champion-level canines.</p>
<p>“She’s very intuitive, very natural — probably smarter than me,”
handler Emily Klarman of Doylestown, Pennsylvania, told a Fox
interviewer in the ring. While Klarman said the win initially left her
speechless, Vanish had plenty to say, barking enthusiastically.</p>
<p>A special award for the best mixed-breed competitor went to Gable,
handled by Kayla Feeney of Lima, New York.</p>
<p>Westminster added agility in 2014, marking the show’s first event
with mixed-breed dogs since the 1800s. Last year saw the first
mixed-breed agility winner, a border collie-papillon mix named Nimble,
who competed again this year.</p>
<p>She’s an intentional blend of two top agility breeds. But the sport
also draws rescue dogs such as an Australian cattle dog mix named
Sawyer, or Soy Sauce for short.</p>
<p>His owner, Dr. Amy Ondeyka, has a complicated work schedule as a New
Jersey emergency room doctor and EMS medical director. But she made time
for agility after realizing she’d adopted a super-energetic dog who
opens cabinets, unzips things and otherwise causes domestic mayhem when
bored.</p>
<p>“He’s always exciting — he does ridiculous things,” Ondeyka said as
he intermittently leaped into her arms during what was ostensibly down
time between agility runs. “We have fun, regardless what happens.”</p>
<p>While some dogs do agility to burn off energy, the sport helps others
come out of their shell. Tully, a lanky, shaggy, mostly Labradoodle mix,
used to be “afraid of the world” but now is excited to go to agility
classes and competitions, owner Carla Rash said.</p>
<p>Saturday’s competitors were a spectrum of dogdom, from a great Dane
to a 7-pound (0.9-kilogramg) papillon, and they included such
lesser-known breeds as a large Munsterlander and a Danish-Swedish
farmdog.</p>
<p>They navigated jumps, tunnels, ramps and other obstacles as handlers
gave hand and voice signals. The object is to be the fastest, without
making mistakes.</p>
<p>Regardless of scores, some dogs won cheers from spectators. There was
a bichon frise with its tail dyed blue, a standard poodle that took a
leisurely trot across an A-frame ramp, and a curly-coated mix that
apparently had second thoughts about the weave poles, circled around and
went through them again.</p>
<p>Westminster’s traditional, breed-by-breed judging happens Monday and
Tuesday, capped by the coveted best in show prize Tuesday night.</p>
<p>That’s for purebreds only, but mixed-breed dogs also were eligible
for Saturday’s obedience competition, an event that Westminster added in
2016. The top prize went to Willie, an Australian shepherd who also won
in 2022 with handler Kathleen Keller of Flemington, New Jersey.</p>
<p>Steve Wesler sported a Philadelphia Eagles sweatshirt as he cheered
on partner Jennifer Weinik and Cookie, her Belgian Malinois. They came
away with a ribbon, which Wesler deemed more exciting than the Super
Bowl — because he was confident the Eagles would prevail.</p>
<p>There are no cash prizes at Westminster, but the agility and
obedience winners each get to direct a $5,000 donation to a training
club or the American Kennel Club Humane Fund.</p>
<p>The show also featured Westminster’s first demonstration of flyball,
a canine relay race that involves retrieving a ball.</p>
<p>“It’s a lot of organized chaos,” Hillary Brown said after competing
with her Boston terrier, Paxil. His teammates on a York,
Pennsylvania-based squad called Clean Break were a standard poodle, a
border collie and a whippet-border collie mix.</p>
<p>“It’s a blast. The dogs love it,” Brown said.</p>

id="trump-to-announce-25-steel-aluminum-tariffs-in-latest-trade-escalation">Trump
to announce 25% steel, aluminum tariffs in latest trade escalation</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE — U.S. President Donald Trump said Sunday that
he will announce on Monday new 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum
imports into the U.S., which would come on top of existing metals duties
in another major escalation of his trade policy overhaul.</p>
<p>Trump, speaking to reporters on Air Force One, also said he will
announce reciprocal tariffs Tuesday or Wednesday, to take effect almost
immediately.</p>
<p>Trump, during his first term, imposed tariffs of 25% on steel and 10%
on aluminum, but later granted several trading partners duty-free
quotas, including Canada, Mexico and Brazil.</p>
<p>Former President Joe Biden extended these quotas to Britain, Japan
and the European Union, and U.S. steel mill capacity utilization has
dropped in recent years.</p>
<p>White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said that the new tariffs
would come on top of the existing duties on steel and aluminum.</p>
<p>Trump on Friday announced that he would impose reciprocal tariffs —
raising U.S. tariff rates to match those of trading partners — on many
countries this week. He did not identify the countries, but the duties
would be imposed “so that we’re treated evenly with other
countries.”</p>

id="chiefs-chase-super-bowl-three-peat-as-trump-attends-nfl-showpiece">Chiefs
chase Super Bowl ‘three-peat’ as Trump attends NFL showpiece</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New Orleans, Louisiana — The Kansas City Chiefs aim for a historic
hat-trick of Super Bowl titles on Sunday when they take on the
Philadelphia Eagles in front of a star-studded crowd in New Orleans
headed by U.S. President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Trump will become the first sitting president ever to attend the NFL
showpiece when he takes his seat among a sell-out crowd of around 74,000
fans at the Superdome for the biggest annual event in the American
sporting calendar, which kicks off at 5:30pm local time (2330 GMT).</p>
<p>Pop superstar Taylor Swift will also be in the VIP seats to watch as
her boyfriend Travis Kelce and his fellow Chiefs bid to become the first
team in history to lift three consecutive Vince Lombardi Trophies.</p>
<p>Trump’s presence at the NFL showpiece will mean even tighter security
than normal around an event which was already bolstered by a heavy
police presence following a New Year’s Day attack which left 14 people
dead and many more injured on the Big Easy’s famous Bourbon Street.</p>
<p>Trump has had a strained relationship with the NFL stretching back
several decades, and triggered uproar during his first time in 2017 when
he attacked the patriotism of players who kneeled during the playing of
the U.S. national anthem in a protest against racial injustice.</p>
<p>Speaking in a pre-game interview aired on Fox News, Trump said his
decision to attend this year’s Super Bowl was for the good of the
country.</p>
<p>“I thought it would be a good thing for the country to have the
President be at the game,” Trump told Fox.</p>
<p>“It’s an iconic day. It’s going to be a great game, two great teams,
and let’s see what happens,” Trump added, revealing that he was tipping
Kansas City for victory, citing the record of Chiefs quarterback Patrick
Mahomes, who is eyeing his fourth Super Bowl win.</p>
<p>“When a quarterback wins as much as he’s won, I have to go with
Kansas City,” Trump said. “I have to go with Kansas City.”</p>
<p>Trump was due to fly into New Orleans from Florida, where he
reportedly played a round of golf with Tiger Woods earlier Sunday. A
schedule released by the White House said he is expected to leave the
Superdome at around 8.05pm local time, well before the game reaches its
conclusion.</p>
<p>Super Bowl fans on Sunday welcomed Trump’s attendance at the
game.</p>
<p>“I think it is awesome, congratulations to him for being the first
President to make it,” Bob Benderovich, a Philadelphia Eagles fan from
Fort Myers, Florida, told AFP.</p>
<p>Chiefs favorites</p>
<p>As always, the Super Bowl crosses over into popular culture and the
half-time show this year will feature hip-hop artist Kendrick Lamar, who
had a clean sweep at last Sunday’s Grammys, winning in all five
categories for which he received nominations.</p>
<p>Bookmakers and casinos meanwhile are taking odds on whether Chiefs
star Kelce will propose to pop icon Swift after what might be his final
game in the NFL.</p>
<p>For the more serious punters, the oddsmakers have the Chiefs as
slight favorite for the game, a rematch of the Super Bowl from two years
ago which the Chiefs won by three points.</p>
<p>They defended their title last year, beating the San Francisco 49ers
in Las Vegas and putting them one win away from an unprecedented
“three-peat.”</p>
<p>The 29-year-old Mahomes will become one of just four quarterbacks in
National Football League history to have won more than three Super Bowls
should he triumph again, having first led the Chiefs to Super Bowl glory
in 2020.</p>
<p>But the Eagles have added serious offensive firepower since their
defeat two years ago with mobile quarterback Jalen Hurts joined by the
game-changing speed and power of running back Saquon Barkley.</p>
<p>The Chiefs put the finishing touches to their game preparations
Saturday with a 30-minute walkthrough of a mock game.</p>
<p>Chiefs coach Andy Reid saluted his team’s attitude to training over
the whole week since arriving in Louisiana.</p>
<p>“I thought the guys worked hard, they got done what they needed to
get done,” Reid said.</p>
<p>The Eagles had a similarly relaxed final session before going to the
Superdome on Saturday for a team photo.</p>
<p>Head coach Nick Sirianni said his Eagles were “hungry” and “ready to
roll.”</p>
<p>“We’re ready for the challenge against a really good team,” Sirianni
said.</p>

id="trump-official-orders-consumer-protection-agency-to-stop-work">Trump
official orders consumer protection agency to stop work</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The Trump administration has ordered the Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau to stop nearly all its work, effectively
shutting down an agency that was created to protect consumers after the
2008 financial crisis and subprime mortgage-lending scandal. </p>
<p>Russell Vought, the newly installed director of the Office of
Management and Budget, directed the CFPB, in a Saturday night email
confirmed by The Associated Press, to stop work on proposed rules, to
suspend the effective dates on any rules that were finalized but not yet
effective, and to stop investigative work and not begin any new
investigations. The agency has been a target of conservatives since
President Barack Obama pushed to include it in the 2010 financial reform
legislation that followed the 2007-2008 financial crisis. </p>
<p>The email also ordered the bureau to “cease all supervision and
examination activity.” </p>
<p>Since the CFPB is a creation of Congress, it would require a separate
act of Congress to formally eliminate it. But the head of the agency has
discretion over what enforcement actions to take, if any. </p>
<p>Yet Elon Musk commented, “CFPB RIP” on social media site X on Friday.
And the CFPB homepage on the Internet was down Sunday, replaced by a
message reading “page not found.” </p>
<p>Also late Saturday, Vought said in a social media post that the CFPB
would not withdraw its next round of funding from the Federal Reserve,
adding that its current reserves of $711.6 million are “excessive.”
Congress directed the bureau to be funded by the Fed to insulate it from
political pressures. </p>
<p>“This spigot, long contributing to CFPB’s unaccountability, is now
being turned off,” Vought said on X. </p>
<p>The CFPB says that it has obtained nearly $20 billion in financial
relief for U.S. consumers since its founding in the form of canceled
debts, compensation, and reduced loans. Last month, the bureau sued
Capital One for allegedly misleading consumers about its offerings for
high-interest savings accounts — and “cheating” customers out of more
than $2 billion in lost interest payments as a result. </p>
<p>Dennis Kelleher, president of Better Markets, an advocacy group,
said, “that’s why Wall Street’s biggest banks and Trump’s billionaire
allies hate the bureau: it’s an effective cop on the finance beat and
has stood side-by-side with hundreds of millions of Americans —
Republicans and Democrats — battling financial predators, scammers, and
crooks.” </p>
<p>The administration’s move against the CFPB also highlights the
tensions between Trump’s more populist promises to lower costs for
working-class families and his pledge to reduce government
regulation. </p>
<p>During the campaign, Trump said he would cap credit card interest
rates at 10%, after they had soared to record levels above 20%, on
average, as the Federal Reserve lifted interest rates in 2022 and 2023.
The CFPB had started work on how that proposal would be
implemented. </p>
<p>The bureau can still take complaints, but it can’t conduct exams or
pursue existing investigations, according to a person familiar with the
agency who insisted on anonymity to discuss CFPB business. The memo is
also interpreted as blocking it from communicating with companies it
regulates, consumer advocates or other outside groups. </p>
<p>Musk’s team would also have access to complaints, investigations and
regulatory oversight data. The access raises uncomfortable questions if
Musk’s company X launches a payments system as the CFPB has data on
competitors such as Cash App, the person said. </p>
<p>Vought’s email follows a similar directive from Treasury Secretary
Scott Bessent Feb. 3 and is the latest move by the Trump administration
to rapidly curtail the work of federal agencies that they have deemed
excessive. </p>
<p>Obama spearheaded the creation of the bureau in the wake of the
2007-2008 housing bubble and financial crisis, which was caused in part
by fraudulent mortgage lending. It was the brainchild of Massachusetts
Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren and has attracted lawsuits from large
banks and financial industry trade associations. </p>
<p>“Vought is giving big banks and giant corporations the green light to
scam families,” Warren said. </p>
<p>Last week, Warren called on Trump to work with the bureau to protect
Americans from de-banking, the practice of banks shutting down customer
accounts because they believe they pose financial, legal or reputational
risks to the banks. </p>
<p>Vought’s email said that President Donald Trump had made him acting
director of the CFPB on Friday. Trump fired the previous director of the
bureau, Rohit Chopra, on Feb. 1. Vought was an architect of Project
2025, a policy blueprint for the Trump White House that Trump tried to
disavow during last year’s campaign. </p>
<p>Under Chopra, the CFPB approved rules to cap overdraft fees by banks,
limit junk fees, and has proposed restrictions on data brokers selling
personal information such as Social Security numbers.</p>

House defends efforts to shut down foreign aid agency</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>White House national security adviser Michael Waltz on Sunday
defended President Donald Trump’s plan to shut down the country’s chief
foreign aid agency, contending that “all too often” it was not aligned
with U.S. strategic interests and wastes money.</p>
<p>Waltz told NBC’s “Meet the Press” that the U.S. Agency for
International Development programs, often food and humanitarian
assistance across the world, “are not in line with strategic U.S.
interests like pushing back on China. They’re doing all kinds of other
things that frankly, aren’t in line with strategic interests or the
president’s vision.”</p>
<p>Moreover, he said, “Often, all too often, only cents on the dollar
actually makes it to people in need, between the big contractors, the
subcontractors, the local contractors, the dollars aren’t being used …
wisely. We need to take a hard look at it. We need to move quickly, and
that’s exactly what’s being done.”.”</p>
<p>Trump this past week ordered the 10,000-worker agency shut down with
fewer than 300 of them expected to eventually be retained as the
agency’s programs are either shifted to State Department control or
terminated.</p>
<p>A federal judge in Washington on Friday ordered a temporary halt to
plans to pull thousands of USAID staffers off the job.</p>
<p>On the same day, workers pried the name of the agency letter by
letter off the entryway of its headquarters in Washington.</p>
<p>Democrats in Congress have been critical of the changes regarding
USAID, with some pledging to stall Trump’s Cabinet nominees and leverage
their votes on a new government spending bill, in protest.</p>
<p>The effort to shut down USAID was the most visible result of Trump
dispatching billionaire Elon Musk and his aides to review programs and
the legitimacy of spending at dozens of federal government agencies.</p>
<p>Trump offered virtually all the government’s 2.3 million civilian
workers a chance to resign and continue to get paid through Sept. 30
without working, but a federal judge paused the offer until he holds a
new hearing Monday afternoon on its legality.</p>
<p>The White House said 65,000 workers, 2.8% of the government’s
civilian workforce, accepted the offer to quit and be paid not to work,
far fewer than the 5- to 10% figure Musk and his cost cutters were
hoping for.</p>
<p>Trump said all government agencies would be subject to financial
reviews, including one of the biggest targets, the Defense Department,
where Musk has billions of dollars of contracts.</p>
<p>Waltz said a review of Pentagon spending was especially
necessary.</p>
<p>“Everything there seems to cost too much, take too long and deliver
too little to the soldiers… we do need great minds, and we do need
business leaders to go in there and absolutely reform the Pentagon’s
acquisition process,” he said.</p>
<p>Waltz, a former congressman from the southern state of Florida, said,
“I, as a member of the House Armed Services Committee, held up a bag of
bolts that would cost 100 bucks … in a hardware store, that cost $90,000
to the United States Air Force and the American people have said enough,
enough with the bloat and the waste….”</p>
<p>“For our barracks and our soldiers, we need all the efficiency we can
get in the Pentagon, and I think the American people and the soldiers
will welcome” a spending review, he said.”</p>
<p>On another matter, Waltz said “sensitive conversations” are occurring
on how to end Russia’s nearly three-year war on Ukraine.</p>
<p>“We will have our secretary of state, our secretary of defense, our
vice president, our special envoy in Europe this week talking through
the details of how to end this war,” Waltz said. “And that means getting
both sides (to) the table.”</p>
<p>Waltz said the discussions would include future U.S. aid to Ukraine,
possibly in exchange for Kyiv supplying the U.S. with its rare earth
minerals — necessary for the manufacture of high-tech goods.</p>
<p>“Those conversations are going to happen this week. And I think an
underlying principle here is that the Europeans have to own this
conflict going forward,” Waltz said. “President Trump is going to end
it. And then in terms of security guarantees, that is squarely going to
be with the Europeans.”</p>

<h2 id="dog-man-bests-heart-eyes-love-hurts-at-box-office">‘Dog Man’
bests ‘Heart Eyes,’ ‘Love Hurts’ at box office</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — On a quiet winter weekend at the box office, DreamWorks
Animation’s “Dog Man” chased its own tail, repeating as the top movie in
theaters. </p>
<p>The animated Universal Pictures release, adapted from Dav Pilkey’s
popular graphic novel series, collected $13.7 million in ticket sales,
according to studio estimates Sunday. Both new releases — the Ke Huy
Quan action movie “Love Hurts” and the Valentine’s Day-themed slasher
“Heart Eyes”— were left nipping at the heels of “Dog Man.” </p>
<p>Hollywood often largely punts Super Bowl weekend to the small screen.
Last year, Apple’s much-derided “Argylle” debuted on the same weekend.
Instead, the movie industry spends more energy pitching its blockbusters
in trailers for the huge football audience on TV. </p>
<p>It wasn’t a banner weekend for “Dog Man.” It fell steeply, dropping
62% in it second weekend. But with a production budget of $40 million,
“Dog Man” has already tallied $54.1 million domestically in two
weeks. </p>
<p>Coming in second was Spyglass Media Group’s “Heart Eyes,” released by
Sony. The horror-rom-com mashup earned $8.5 million from 3,102
locations. Reviews have been good for the film, directed by Josh Ruben
and starring Oliva Holt and Mason Gooding, though audiences were less
impressed. Moviegoers gave it a “B-” CinemaScore. Spyglass made “Heart
Eyes” for $18 million. </p>
<p>“Love Hurts,” the action comedy from 87North Productions (“John
Wick,” “The Fall Guy”), debuted with a paltry $5.8 million in 3,055
theaters. In his first big movie role since his Oscar-winning comeback
in “Everything All at Once,” Ke Huy Quan stars as a mild-mannered
realtor with a hitman past. Ariana DeBose co-stars. It, too, was
modestly budgeted at $18 million. Audiences, however, mostly rejected
the movie, giving “Love Hurts” a “C+” CinemaScore. </p>

egg prices in US pique interest in backyard chickens</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Thinking about backyard chickens as egg prices soar? Think
hard, especially in light of the bird flu outbreak.</p>
<p>Keeping home chickens as a pastime has continued to grow since the
pandemic. But if eggs are the goal, remember that it takes planning and
investment to raise the chickens and protect against bird flu. Costs
might go well beyond the nationwide average of $4.15 a dozen that
commercial eggs sold for in December.</p>
<p>“Anyone who’s done an ounce of research will very quickly understand
that there are no free eggs, there are no inexpensive eggs in keeping
chickens,” said Kathy Shea Mormino, a home chicken blogger and author
who has about 50 of the birds at her Suffield, Connecticut, home.</p>
<p>“You’re going to pay more, particularly in your first several years,
in your setup and in your birds. And there’s a huge learning curve on
how to care for animals that are really unusual pets,” said Mormino, who
has kept chickens for 15 years and calls herself the Chicken Chick.</p>
<p>Costs vary wildly, from about $200 to $2,000 for a coop alone.
Feeders and waterers range from about $8 to $50 or more, depending on
the size and type.</p>
<p>Bird flu has forced farmers to slaughter millions of chickens a
month, contributing (along with inflation) to the steep price of
commercial eggs and resulting in some scantily stocked stores around the
country. The scarcity and high prices are causing some to look for a
backyard alternative.</p>
<p>“We’ve seen a real uptick in calls recently from people wanting to
start their own backyard flocks. With the egg shortages at grocery
stores, many are excited about the idea of raising chickens and taking
steps toward sustainability,” said Matthew Aversa, a co-owner of Winding
Branch Ranch, a nonprofit sanctuary and farm animal rescue outside San
Antonio.</p>
<p>“We adopt out whole flocks. We’re receiving at least a dozen
inquiries per week,” he said.</p>
<p>Kate Perz, the animal science coordinator for Cornell Cooperative
Extension of Suffolk County, New York, said that unlike other pandemic
pastimes, raising home chickens has only grown.</p>
<p>“It’s not always cost-effective,” she said. “You have to really look
at how many eggs you’re eating and what the cost of those are versus
what you would be spending.”</p>
<p>There are other reasons, of course, to keep chickens at home, not the
least of which is the sheer joy of their presence. Mormino and other
“chickeneers,” as she calls home enthusiasts, have a coop full of tips
on how to get started.</p>
<p>Tend to legal matters</p>
<p>You may be ready to dive right in. Your town may not. Mormino, who
wrote The Chicken Chick’s Guide to Backyard Chickens, said the first
thing to consider is whether chickens are right for you. After that,
don’t assume your county, town or city will allow it.</p>
<p>Look up zoning and building codes yourself if you feel capable.
Otherwise, consult an attorney who specializes in municipal law in your
area.</p>
<p>Don’t rely on word of mouth or even a town worker to know the ins and
outs. Is a building permit required to build a coop? Are roosters banned
under noise ordinances? Sometimes, zoning codes are silent on the
subject. Don’t assume that’s a green light. Many codes are “permissive
use” regulations, Mormino said, essentially meaning that if the code
doesn’t say you’re permitted, you’re not!</p>
<p>If chicken-keeping is allowed, is there a limit on how many birds?
Are there restrictions on where a coop can be built in relation to
neighboring property lines. Most homeowners associations have rules on
animal keeping.</p>
<p>Mormino lives in a farming town and had a neighbor who kept three
horses and a small flock of chickens, so she assumed they were legal.
They weren’t. She called the town clerk’s office to ask whether a
building permit was required to build a coop and was told it wasn’t. It
was.</p>
<p>In the end, she successfully defended a lawsuit against her (she’s an
attorney) and prevailed in a long battle to amend the law, legalizing
backyard chickens in her town.</p>
<p>What about bird flu?</p>
<p>Bird flu is highly contagious. It spreads mostly by migrating
waterfowl in their droppings. Chickens are far from immune if they spend
any time free ranging or in a run without protection from wild fowl
droppings.</p>
<p>“There’s a limited number of things that we can do because our birds
live where wildlife live,” Mormino said. “People need to know if they
have a bird or birds that die suddenly from some of the symptoms, they
need to contact the USDA to get the postmortem exam and the birds tested
for bird flu.”</p>
<p>Don’t bring sick birds into the house for care. That raises the risk
of transmission to humans. Once the virus is confirmed, the entire flock
needs to be euthanized, she and Perz said.</p>
<p>Symptoms of bird flu include: sudden death without any clinical
signs; swelling of the head, eyelids, comb, wattles or hocks; diarrhea;
stumbling or falling down; decreased egg production and/or soft-shelled
or misshapen eggs; and coughing and sneezing.</p>
<p>Don’t feed any wildlife in areas where your chickens dwell or roam.
Wash hands thoroughly after tending to chickens and dedicate a pair of
shoes or boots strictly for use around them.</p>
<p>“The biggest mistake backyard chickeneers make is to bring new
chickens into their flock that have lived someplace else. That’s the
fastest way to bring disease into your chicken yard,” Mormino said.</p>
<p>Consider your costs</p>
<p>Sarah Penny has turned her 7,000-square-foot home lot in Knoxville,
Tennessee, into a beautiful garden and chicken home. She has nine birds
and grows more than half the food she and her 13-year-old son eat.</p>
<p>She’s had chickens since 2021 and estimates her startup costs at
about $2,500.</p>
<p>Monthly costs vary based on what chickens are fed and how coops are
kept. Penny, for instance, uses the deep litter method and composts from
her coop, meaning she’s not mucking out her coop more than twice a
year.</p>
<p>“But the cost of starting with backyard chickens is definitely quite
expensive. I don’t know if a lot of people know that,” Penny said.</p>
<p>Her coop alone, which her family built themselves, cost about $2,000.
It had to be outfitted to keep predators out, including rats that tunnel
under the ground.</p>
<p>Many people start with buying hatchlings, which just got more
expensive to ship via the U.S. Postal Service due to new fees. Raising
hatchlings requires a chick brooder involving a separate enclosure, heat
lamp, feeders and other supplies.</p>
<p>Penny buys a bag of feed every two weeks for $15 to $20 a bag.
There’s also the cost of calcium, such as oyster shells, and grit to aid
digestion if chickens are not free-ranging or getting those elements in
their feed.</p>
<p>She estimates her monthly costs at about $60, saving a bit by also
feeding her chickens healthy human leftovers. She’s careful not to
include foods that are toxic for chickens, including onions, potatoes
and avocados.</p>
<p>It’s all worth it to Penny.</p>
<p>“We eat a lot of eggs,” she said. “We probably go through a dozen
every two days. We bake a lot. We’re an ingredient household, so the
majority of our food is cooked from scratch. Eggs are a main staple for
our breakfast.”</p>

id="high-home-prices-and-mortgage-rates-put-american-dream-out-of-reach-for-many">High
home prices and mortgage rates put American dream out of reach for
many</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The Petersen family’s two-bedroom apartment in northern California is
starting to feel small.</p>
<p>Four-year-old Jerrik’s toy monster trucks are everywhere in the
1,100-square-foot unit in Campbell, just outside of San Jose. And it’s
only a matter of time before 9-month-old Carolynn starts amassing more
toys, adding to the disarray, said her mother, Jenn Petersen.</p>
<p>The 42-year-old chiropractor had hoped she and her husband, Steve, a
39-year-old dental hygienist, would have bought a house by now. But when
they can afford a bigger place, it will have to be another rental.
Petersen has done the math: With mortgage rates and home prices
stubbornly high, there’s no way the couple, who make about $270,000 a
year and pay about $2,500 in monthly rent, can afford a home anywhere in
their area.</p>
<p>According to October data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, a
San Jose family with a median income of $156,700 would need to spend 80%
of their income on housing — including an $8,600 monthly mortgage
payment — to own a median-priced $1.54 million home. That’s far higher
than the general rule of thumb that people should pay no more than 30%
of their income on a mortgage or rent.</p>
<p>Moving out of state is out of the question for the Petersens — they
have strong family ties to the area and their income would plummet if
they move to a lower cost-of-living area. “I’m not willing to give up my
job and close connections with my family for a house,” Petersen
said.</p>
<p>The issue is widespread and near historic highs nationally: As of
last fall, the median homeowner in the U.S. was paying 42% of their
income on homeownership costs, according to the Atlanta Fed. Four years
ago, that percentage was 28% and had not previously reached 38% since
late 2007, just before the housing market crash.</p>
<p>“The American dream, as our parents knew it, doesn’t exist anymore,”
Petersen said. “The whole idea that you get a house after you graduate
college, get a steady job and get married? I’ve done most of those
milestones. But the homeownership part? That just doesn’t fit
financially.”</p>
<p>Supply lags demand</p>
<p>First-time homeowners are getting older. The same is true for an
increasing number of American families.</p>
<p>In 2024, the median first-time homebuyer was 38 years old, a jump
from age 35 the previous year, according to a recent report by the
National Association of Realtors. That’s significantly above historic
norms, when median first-time buyers hovered between 30 and 32 years old
from 1993 to 2018.</p>
<p>The biggest driver of this trend, experts said, is simple: There are
far too few houses on the market to match pent-up demand, driving prices
past the point of affordability for many people who are relatively early
in their careers. Coupled with high mortgage rates, many have concluded
that renting is their only option.</p>
<p>“Wage growth hasn’t kept up with the increase in home prices and
interest rates,” said Domonic Purviance, who studies housing at the
Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta in Atlanta, Georgia. “Even though people
are making more money, home prices are increasing at a faster rate.”</p>
<p>That gap has left many out of the housing market, which for
generations has been a way for Americans to build equity and wealth that
they can pass down or leverage to buy a larger home. It’s also led to
widespread worries about housing in the United States. About 7 in 10
voters under age 45 said they were “very” concerned about the cost of
housing in their community, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of more
than 120,000 voters in the 2024 election.</p>
<p>Is the dream going to fade?</p>
<p>Brian McCabe, a sociology professor at Georgetown University, said he
frequently tells his students that “there are few things that all
Americans agree on, but one of them is that they’d rather own a home
than rent.”</p>
<p>McCabe said homeownership, especially as a wealth-building tool, is
the right move for many, especially if the owner intends to be in one
place for a long time. But he also said many are realizing that not
owning a home has its advantages, too — it gives people more flexibility
to move and allows them to live in exciting neighborhoods they would not
be able to afford to buy property in.</p>
<p>McCabe said millennials are getting married later, having children
later, have a stronger desire to stay in cities and, especially due to
remote work, value the flexibility of being able to move with ease — all
of which he said could prompt an end to the notion that homeownership is
the “apex of the American dream.”</p>
<p>“The big question is whether we see the sheen of homeownership start
to fade,” McCabe said. “It’s such an interesting cultural marker: Why is
owning a home the pinnacle for so many people?”</p>
<p>It’s a question Petersen wrestles with because she knows any
three-bedroom home she found in her area would leave her family “house
poor.”</p>
<p>“I used to subscribe to the idea that owning a house is just a
natural milestone you have to reach,” she said. “At some point, though,
what are you sacrificing by just owning a house and gaining equity? I
want to be able to travel with my kids. I want to be able to sign them
up for extracurriculars. How are we supposed to do that if we’re paying
a mortgage that’s most of our take-home pay?”</p>
<p>Petersen said she’ll “always hold out a little bit of hope” that
homeownership will be in her family’s future. But if they find a
townhouse to rent that has space for her kids and fits within their
$3,600 monthly rental budget?</p>
<p>“I’d take that,” she said.</p>
<p>Cities offer support</p>
<p>Some cities are providing crucial aid to first-time homebuyers</p>
<p>Lifelong Boston resident Julieta Lopez, 63, spent decades hoping to
buy a home but watched as prices became increasingly out of reach.</p>
<p>“The prices in Boston just got higher and higher and higher and
higher,” said Lopez, who works for the city traffic department issuing
tickets for parking violations.</p>
<p>Two years ago, furious to learn that her subsidized apartment’s
monthly rent was being hiked to $2,900, Lopez, who earns about $60,000
annually, took out her phone and began searching for government programs
that help first-time homebuyers. She was determined to finally own her
own place.</p>
<p>Within months, she had succeeded. Lopez qualified to receive $50,000
from the local Massachusetts Affordable Homeownership Alliance nonprofit
and another $50,000 from the city of Boston’s Office of Housing — funds
that helped her with a down payment on the $430,000 two-bedroom
condominium she shares with her 30-year-old son. She now pays about
$2,160 a month on her mortgage.</p>
<p>Lopez knows she is lucky the city has placed such a focus on aiding
first-time buyers like herself — Boston has poured more than $24 million
into its homeownership assistance programs since Mayor Michelle Wu took
office in 2021, helping nearly 700 residents get their first homes.</p>
<p>But Lopez also feels proud to have her own place after years of
working — doing jobs that included everything from telecommunications to
health care to electronics.</p>
<p>“I was determined to have my piece of the pie,” she said. “I felt I
deserved that. I’ve always worked. Always. Nonstop.”</p>

id="japan-prime-minister-voices-optimism-over-averting-us-tariffs">Japan
prime minister voices optimism over averting US tariffs</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>TOKYO — Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba expressed optimism on
Sunday that his country could avoid higher U.S. tariffs, saying
President Donald Trump had recognized Japan’s huge investment in the
U.S. and the American jobs that it creates.</p>
<p>At his first White House summit on Friday, Ishiba told public
broadcaster NHK, he explained to Trump how many Japanese automakers were
creating jobs in the United States.</p>
<p>The two did not specifically discuss auto tariffs, Ishiba said,
although he said he did not know whether Japan would be subject to the
reciprocal tariffs that Trump has said he plans to impose on
imports.</p>
<p>Tokyo has so far escaped the trade war Trump unleashed in his first
weeks in office. He has announced tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico
and China, although he postponed the 25% duties on his North American
neighbors to allow for talks.</p>
<p>The escalating trade tensions since Trump returned to the White House
on Jan. 20 threaten to rupture the global economy.</p>
<p>Ishiba said he believes Trump “recognized the fact Japan has been the
world’s largest investor in the United States for five straight years
and is therefore different from other countries.”</p>
<p>“Japan is creating many U.S. jobs. I believe (Washington) won’t go
straight to the idea of higher tariffs,” he said.</p>
<p>Ishiba voiced optimism that Japan and the U.S. can avoid a
tit-for-tat tariff war, stressing that tariffs should be put in place in
a way that “benefits both sides.”</p>
<p>“Any action that exploits or excludes the other side won’t last,”
Ishiba said. “The question is whether there is any problem between Japan
and the United States that warrants imposing higher tariffs,” he
added. </p>
<p>Japan had the highest foreign direct investment in the United States
in 2023 at $783.3 billion, followed by Canada and Germany, according to
the most recent U.S. Commerce Department data.</p>
<p>Trump pressed Ishiba to close Japan’s $68.5 billion annual trade
surplus with Washington but expressed optimism this could be done
quickly, given a promise by Ishiba to bring Japanese investment in the
U.S. to $1 trillion.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Ishiba identified liquefied natural gas, steel, AI and
autos as areas that Japanese companies could invest in.</p>
<p>He also touched on Trump’s promise to look at Nippon Steel investing
in U.S. Steel as opposed to buying the storied American company, a
planned purchase opposed by Trump and blocked by his predecessor, Joe
Biden.</p>
<p>“Investment is being made to ensure that it remains an American
company. It will continue to operate under American management, with
American employees,” Ishiba said. “The key point is how to ensure it
remains an American company. From President Trump’s perspective, this is
of utmost importance.”</p>
<p>On military spending, another area where Trump has pressed allies for
increases, Ishiba said Japan would not increase its defense budget
without first winning public backing.</p>
<p>“It is crucial to ensure that what is deemed necessary is something
the taxpayers can understand and support,” he said.</p>

<p>Historical precedent, legal questions swirl around Trump plan to
detain migrants at Guantanamo</p>
<p>The Trump administration’s expansion of migrant detention facilities,
notably its use of the U.S. naval station at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, has
reignited debate among human rights advocates and legal experts. VOA’s
immigration Aline Barros reports.</p>
<p>What is birthright citizenship?</p>
<p>President Donald Trump is reigniting a fierce debate: Should everyone
born on U.S. soil automatically become a citizen? This question strikes
at the heart of American identity, history and law. Trump signed an
executive order last month seeking to end the right, but two federal
judges have placed injunctions on the order, pausing it indefinitely.
Here’s what you need to know about birthright citizenship.</p>
<p>Rubio visiting Costa Rica, Guatemala on trip focused on migration,
security ties</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio met Tuesday with officials in
Costa Rica and later in Guatemala as part of a tour of Latin America
focused on migration, security cooperation and countering Chinese
influence in the region. Rubio was in El Salvador for talks Monday with
President Nayib Bukele, and he announced that Bukele had offered to
accept any deportees from the United States, regardless of their
nationality. Reported by VOA’s State Department Correspondent Nike
Ching.</p>
<p>California city breaks with state on shielding undocumented
migrants</p>
<p>U.S. Border Patrol agents are detaining undocumented migrants as part
of President Donald Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration. Many of
those arrests have been in California, where one city is trying to break
with the state and cooperate with federal immigration agencies. Genia
Dulot reports from Huntington Beach.</p>
<p>10 ‘high-threat illegal aliens’ arrive at Guantanamo Bay</p>
<p>The first undocumented migrants — described by U.S. officials as the
“the worst of the worst” — are being held in jail cells at the U.S.
detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, waiting to be sent home. The
Pentagon on Wednesday confirmed 10 “high-threat illegal aliens” arrived
Tuesday at the detention facility, where they are being held under the
watch of officers with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
Carla Babb, VOA’s Pentagon correspondent, and Jeff Seldin, VOA’s
national security correspondent, report.</p>
<p>Trump’s birthright citizenship order put on hold by 2nd federal
judge</p>
<p>A U.S. federal judge ordered a second temporary pause Wednesday on
President Donald Trump’s executive order seeking to end birthright
citizenship for anyone born in the United States to someone in the
country illegally. U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman said no court in
the country has endorsed the Trump administration’s interpretation of
the 14th Amendment. “This court will not be the first,” she said. The
Associated Press reports.</p>
<p>Trump administration moves to end deportation protections for 348,000
Venezuelans</p>
<p>U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Monday moved to
remove protection against deportation from hundreds of thousands of
Venezuelans in the U.S., part of President Donald Trump’s expanding
immigration crackdown. The decision means about 348,000 Venezuelans with
Temporary Protected Status, more than half of all Venezuelans in the
program, could be deported and lose work permits in April, according to
a government notice. The notice said the protections were contrary to
U.S. interests and no longer justified by conditions in Venezuela.
Reuters reports.</p>
<p>Afghan refugees in California seek clarity amid illegal immigration
crackdowns</p>
<p>Afghan refugees in the United States are expressing concern about
their status as the Trump administration cracks down on illegal
immigration. In California, immigration lawyers are stepping in to
address these concerns and clarify the potential effects on their
status. Fahim Sediqi reports from Sacramento, California, narrated by
Bezhan Hamdard.</p>
<p>Immigration around the world</p>
<p>Darfuri women face sexual violence in war, refuge</p>
<p>Aid groups say sexual violence is a constant threat for women in
Sudan’s Darfur, but refugees also say it’s a problem for those who have
fled the region. Reporting from a refugee camp on Chad’s border with
Darfur, Henry Wilkins looks at the phenomenon of “firewood rape.”

<p>US deportation flight carrying undocumented Indian migrants lands in
Punjab</p>
<p>A U.S. deportation flight carrying Indian nationals accused of
entering the U.S. illegally landed in the northern state of Punjab on
Wednesday – the first such flight to India since the Trump
administration launched a crackdown on undocumented immigrants. The
military aircraft, which landed amid tight security, brought 104
deportees, according to media reports. Authorities did not confirm the
number, but said the deportees will be received in a friendly manner.

all 67 victims were recovered this week, and crews will spend the coming
days looking for smaller debris before finishing the work in about a
week. </p>
<p>A plane operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration and equipped with laser scanning technology flew at low
altitudes over the crash site. The lasers are used to penetrate the
river’s surface and map the riverbed. </p>
<p>“All major pieces” of the two aircraft have been found, and
investigators will examine them for any markings that could reveal the
angle of the collision, according to an NTSB statement released Saturday
afternoon. </p>
<p>The NTSB said information collected will be part of its ongoing
investigation into the January 29 collision between the Army helicopter
and an American Airlines flight over Washington. There were no
survivors. </p>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday blamed the collision on what
he called an obsolete computer system used by U.S. air traffic
controllers and vowed to replace it. </p>
<p>NTSB officials told members of Congress that the helicopter’s
advanced surveillance technology, which transmits aircraft location and
other data to air traffic control and other aircraft, was turned off,
Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz said Thursday. </p>
<p>Investigators are also looking into the altitude of the plane and
helicopter, including whether the helicopter was above its 61-meter
flight ceiling. Investigators need to be able to examine the wreckage of
the Black Hawk to get more precise information. </p>
<p>The crash was the deadliest in the U.S. since November 12, 2001, when
a jet slammed into a New York City neighborhood just after takeoff,
killing all 260 people on board and five on the ground.</p>

judge temporarily blocks Musk’s DOGE from accessing payment systems</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A federal judge early Saturday temporarily blocked billionaire Elon
Musk’s government efficiency team and Trump administration political
appointees from accessing government systems used to process trillions
of dollars in payments, citing a risk that sensitive information could
be improperly disclosed.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer in Manhattan issued the order
after a coalition of Democratic attorneys general from 19 U.S. states
filed a lawsuit late Friday arguing Musk’s Department of Government
Efficiency has no legal power to access the U.S. Department of Treasury
systems.</p>
<p>Musk, on X, called the ruling “absolutely insane!” and said without
evidence that “something super shady is going to protect scammers.”</p>
<p>“How on Earth are we supposed to stop fraud and waste of taxpayer
money without looking at how money is spent?” Musk said on his social
media platform and called Engelmayer “an activist posing as a
judge.”</p>
<p>The lawsuit said Musk and his team could disrupt federal funding for
health clinics, preschools, climate initiatives, and other programs, and
that Republican President Donald Trump could use the information to
further his political agenda.</p>
<p>DOGE’s access to the system also “poses huge cybersecurity risks that
put vast amounts of funding for the States and their residents in
peril,” the state attorneys general said. They sought a temporary
restraining order blocking DOGE’s access.</p>
<p>The judge, an appointee of Democratic former President Barack Obama,
said the states’ claims were “particularly strong” and warranted him
acting on their request for emergency relief pending a further hearing
before another judge on Feb. 14.</p>
<p>“That is both because of the risk that the new policy presents of the
disclosure of sensitive and confidential information and the heightened
risk that the systems in question will be more vulnerable than before to
hacking,” Engelmayer wrote.</p>
<p>New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat whose office is
leading the case, welcomed the ruling, saying nobody was above the law
and that Americans across the country had been horrified by the DOGE
team’s unfettered access to their data.</p>
<p>“We knew the Trump administration’s choice to give this access to
unauthorized individuals was illegal, and this morning, a federal court
agreed,” James said in a statement. “Now, Americans can trust that Musk
— the world’s richest man — and his friends will not have free rein over
their personal information while our lawsuit proceeds.”</p>
<p>Engelmayer’s order bars access from being granted to Treasury
Department payment and data systems by political appointees, special
government employees and government employees detailed from an agency
outside the Treasury Department.</p>
<p>The judge also directed that anyone prohibited under his order from
accessing those systems to immediately destroy anything they copied or
downloaded.</p>
<p>The White House and Treasury Department did not immediately respond
to requests for comment.</p>
<p>Trump deputized Musk to lead DOGE to identify fraud and waste in the
government. Musk’s efforts have alarmed Democrats and advocacy groups
who say he is overstepping his authority by seeking to dismantle
agencies responsible for critical government programs and fire federal
workers en masse.</p>
<p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, a Trump appointee, said this week
that the department’s payment system will not be touched by Musk and
that any decisions to stop payments would be made by other agencies.</p>

bill talks bog down after Trump’s efforts to slash government</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Before President Donald Trump and Republicans in
Congress can enact much of their legislative agenda, they must deal with
some unfinished business — completing work on the current budget year’s
spending bills. It’s a task that by all accounts is not going well. </p>
<p>The current stopgap measure lasts through March 14. After that,
without congressional action, there would be a partial government
shutdown. </p>
<p>Five weeks is an eternity when it comes to resolving spending bills
in Washington. But Trump’s first weeks in office have escalated tensions
between the two parties as the new administration reshapes agency
priorities and dismantles existing programs without congressional
approval. </p>
<p>A look at where the talks stand: </p>
<p>Republicans accuse Democrats of abandoning negotiations </p>
<p>Republican and Democratic leaders of the two appropriations
committees in Congress were holding spending bill talks in late January;
aides said the two sides were committed to getting a deal done. But
optimism has faded in recent days. </p>
<p>“Obviously, the Democrats are not in a good place right now, so they
walked away from talks. But it’ll have to resume,” House Majority Leader
Steve Scalise, a Republican from Louisiana, said Thursday. </p>
<p>House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, gave a
similar assessment, contending that comments by House Democratic leader
Hakeem Jeffries of New York and some of his colleagues made it seem as
though they are “trying to set up some sort of government shutdown,
which I think is very unfortunate. We were negotiating in good faith and
trying to get the topline number, but so far as I know, they’ve been
sort of unresponsive the last two days or so. So, I hope we can get back
to it.” </p>
<p>Representative Tom Cole, the chairman of the House Appropriations
Committee, said he heard from Democratic lawmakers as recently as
Thursday, so he did not believe they were walking away from talks. </p>
<p>“But we’re not making the progress I would hope,” said Cole, a
Republican from Oklahoma. </p>
<p>Democrats dispute GOP leadership’s characterization </p>
<p>Connecticut Representative Rosa DeLauro, the lead Democrat on the
House Appropriations Committee, said “that is false” in response to the
assertion that Democrats have withdrawn from negotiations. </p>
<p>“The Democrats have made their offer. We have not walked away from
the table,” DeLauro said. </p>
<p>Jeffries told reporters that DeLauro “has been trying to get
Republicans to respond to her for weeks.” </p>
<p>“I’m hopeful that Republicans are actually willing now to sit down at
the table and reach a spending agreement in the best interest of the
American people, not in the best interest of their billionaire donors,”
Jeffries said. </p>
<p>Tensions over topline spending levels </p>
<p>Under terms of an agreement that former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a
Republican from California, worked out with then-President Joe Biden,
spending for defense and non-defense would increase by 1% for the
current budget year, which began October 1. That would bring the tallies
to about $895.2 billion for defense and $780.4 billion for
non-defense. </p>
<p>Congress set the spending levels to grow below the rate of inflation,
at the insistence of Republicans, as part of a package that also
suspended the debt limit so that the federal government could continue
paying its bills. Democrats say an agreement is an agreement. </p>
<p>“That is the path forward that will allow everyone to come together
to reach a spending agreement that meets the needs of the American
people,” Jeffries said. </p>
<p>Republicans don’t see it that way. </p>
<p>Cole said Democrats should adjust to the reality of a Republican
president in the White House and Republicans controlling both chambers
of Congress. </p>
<p>“We have to remember the deal they are trying to enforce is when we
had a Democratic president and a Democratic Senate. We don’t have those
anymore,” Cole said. “And in particular, the president doesn’t feel
bound by an agreement made by another president that didn’t go down on
his watch.” </p>
<p>Cole said that “there’s only one signature that matters right now and
it’s not Joe Biden’s anymore.” </p>
<p>Democrats wary as Trump, Musk revamp federal government </p>
<p>Democrats are struggling to keep up and provide a unified response to
Trump’s first weeks in office as government workers are pushed to
resign, entire agencies are dismantled, and Elon Musk’s team from the
Department of Government Efficiency gains access to sensitive
information of countless Americans. </p>
<p>They are worried about how current government services are being
affected, with Democrats accusing the administration of blocking
hundreds of billions of dollars in previously approved funding. Those
concerns are also swaying their thinking as they approach the spending
bill negotiations. </p>
<p>“The level of trust is at the lowest I have ever seen it here in
Congress,” said Washington Senator Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the
Senate Appropriations Committee. “It is up to our Republican colleagues
to stand up to this and assure us an agreement and a law is real.” </p>
<p>DeLauro said Democrats need assurances that Republicans will follow
through on whatever spending agreement the negotiators reach. </p>
<p>“You won some. I won some. We lost some each. But we have a deal. And
that’s got to be it. Those assurances have to be made,” DeLauro
said. </p>
<p>Plan B </p>
<p>If lawmakers fail to reach agreement on a full-year spending measure,
then it’s possible that they could also pass another temporary measure
to keep the government open for a few more weeks or months while they
try to work out their differences. </p>
<p>Such stopgap measures, called continuing resolutions (CRs), generally
fund government programs and agencies at current levels. </p>
<p>“I don’t want a CR,” Cole said. “But I certainly prefer a CR to a
shutdown.”</p>
