South Africans gather in support of Trump, his claims they are victims
of racism</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PRETORIA, SOUTH AFRICA — Some white South Africans showed support for
President Donald Trump on Saturday and gathered at the U.S. Embassy in
Pretoria to claim they are victims of racism by their own
government.</p>
<p>Hundreds of protesters held placards that read “Thank God for
President Trump” and displayed other messages criticizing what they see
as racist laws instituted by the South African government that
discriminate against the white minority.</p>
<p>Many were from the Afrikaner community that Trump focused on in an
executive order a week ago that cut aid and assistance to the Black-led
South African government. In the order, Trump said South Africa’s
Afrikaners, who are descendants of mainly Dutch colonial settlers, were
being targeted by a new law that allows the government to expropriate
private land. </p>
<p>The South African government has denied its new law is tied to race
and says Trump’s claims over the country and the law have been full of
misinformation and distortions. </p>
<p>Trump said land was being expropriated from Afrikaners — which the
order referred to as “racially disfavored landowners” — when no land has
been taken under the law. Trump also announced a plan to offer
Afrikaners refugee status in the U.S. They are only one part of South
Africa’s white minority. </p>
<p>In a speech to Parliament this week, South African President Cyril
Ramaphosa said the forced removal of any people from their land will
never be allowed in South Africa again after millions of Blacks were
dispossessed of property under the apartheid system of white minority
rule and hundreds of years of colonialism before that. </p>
<p>“The people of this country know the pain of forced removals,”
Ramaphosa said. He said the land law does not allow any arbitrary taking
of land and only refers to land that can be redistributed for the public
good. </p>
<p>The Trump administration’s criticism and punishment of South Africa
has elevated a long-standing dilemma in the country over moves to
address the wrongs of centuries of white minority rule that oppressed
the Black majority. </p>
<p>According to the government, the land law aims to fairly address the
inequality that the majority of farmland in South Africa is owned by
whites, even though they make up just 7% of the country’s
population. </p>
<p>White protesters on Saturday held banners referencing the
expropriation law but also other affirmative action policies put in
place by the government since the end of apartheid in 1994 to advance
opportunities for Blacks. Those laws, known as Black Economic
Empowerment, have been a source of frustration for some white
people.</p>
<p>Influential Trump adviser Elon Musk — who was raised in South Africa
— has also criticized South Africa’s government and claimed it is
anti-white for years, although some have questioned his motivations. He
has recently failed to get a license for his Starlink satellite internet
service in South Africa because it doesn’t meet the country’s
affirmative action criteria.</p>
<p>While race has long framed South African politics, the country has
been largely successful in reconciling its racially diverse people in
the years after apartheid. The current government is made up of a
coalition of 10 Black-led and white-led political parties that are
working together.</p>

id="breakfast-is-booming-at-us-restaurants.-is-it-also-contributing-to-high-egg-prices">Breakfast
is booming at US restaurants. Is it also contributing to high egg
prices?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>It’s a chicken-and-egg problem: Restaurants are struggling with
record-high U.S. egg prices, but their omelets, scrambles and huevos
rancheros may be part of the problem.</p>
<p>Breakfast is booming at U.S. eateries. First Watch, a restaurant
chain that serves breakfast, brunch and lunch, nearly quadrupled its
locations over the past decade to 570. Eggs Up Grill has 90 restaurants
in nine southern states, up from 26 in 2018. Florida-based Another
Broken Egg Café celebrated its 100th restaurant last year.</p>
<p>Fast-food chains are also adding more breakfast items. Starbucks,
which launched egg bites in 2017, now has a breakfast menu with 12
separate items containing eggs. Wendy’s reintroduced breakfast in 2020
and offers 10 items with eggs.</p>
<p>Reviews website Yelp said 6,421 breakfast and brunch businesses
opened in the United States last year, 23% more than in 2019.</p>
<p>In normal times, producers could meet the demand for all those eggs.
But an ongoing bird flu outbreak, which so far has forced farms to
slaughter nearly 159 million chickens, turkeys and other birds —
including nearly 47 million since the start of December — is making
supplies scarcer and pushing up prices. In January, the average price of
eggs in the U.S. hit a record $4.95 per dozen.</p>
<p>The percentage of eggs that go to U.S. restaurants versus other
places, like grocery stores or food manufacturers, is not publicly
available. U.S. Foods, a restaurant supplier, and Cal-Maine Foods, the
largest U.S. producer of shell eggs, did not respond to The Associated
Press’ requests for comment.</p>
<p>But demand from restaurants is almost certainly growing. Foot traffic
at U.S. restaurants has grown the most since 2019 for morning meals,
2019, according to market research firm Circana. Pre-lunchtime hours
accounted for 21% of total restaurant visits in 2024.</p>
<p>Breakfast sandwiches are the most popular order during morning
visits, Circana said, and 70% of the breakfast sandwiches on U.S. menus
include eggs.</p>
<p>Eggs Up Grill CEO Ricky Richardson said breakfast restaurants took
off after the COVID pandemic because people longed for comfort and
connection. As inflation made food more expensive, customers saw
breakfast and lunch as more affordable options for eating out, he
said.</p>
<p>The growth in restaurant demand reverses a pattern that emerged
during the pandemic, when consumers tried to stock up on eggs for home
use but restaurants needed fewer of them because many of them had to
close for a time, according to Brian Earnest, a lead economist for
animal proteins at CoBank.</p>
<p>U.S. egg consumption declined for more than five decades before
reaching a low of 247 per person in 2008, according to data from the
U.S. Department of Agriculture. As nutritional research and marketing
established eggs as an inexpensive protein source instead of
heart-clogging cholesterol bombs, per capita consumption of egg products
grew to the equivalent of 292 fresh eggs in 2019, the data shows.</p>
<p>“Consumers think eggs are really fresh, so if you’re making something
with eggs, you know it’s fresh,” Earnest said.</p>
<p>Before the pandemic reduced demand and bird flu outbreaks impacted
supplies, the USDA had forecast that Americans would continue eating
more eggs. By 2023, the most recent year for which annual data is
available, they were down to 249 eggs per person.</p>
<p>Other trends have impacted the economics of eggs. To address animal
rights concerns, McDonald’s and some other companies have switched to
100% cage-free eggs, which limits the sources they will buy from. Ten
states, including California and Colorado, have passed laws restricting
egg sales to products from cage-free environments.</p>
<p>“It makes the market much more complicated than it was 20 years ago,”
Earnest said.</p>
<p>The higher prices are hitting restaurants hard. Wholesale egg prices
hit a national average of $7.34 per dozen last week, according to the
U.S. Department of Agriculture. That was 51% higher than at the
beginning of the year. Wholesale costs may be higher than retail prices
since grocers use eggs as a loss leader to get customers in the
door.</p>
<p>Some chains, like Waffle House, have added a surcharge to help offset
the cost of eggs. Others may turn to egg substitutes like tapioca starch
for some recipes or cut egg dishes from the menu, said Phil Kafarakis,
the president and CEO of the International Foodservice Manufacturers
Association.</p>
<p>First Watch President and CEO Chris Tomasso said eggs are critical
for the chain’s brand and are found in the majority of its offerings,
whether at the center of the plate or as an ingredient in batters. So
far, he said, the company has been able to obtain the eggs it needs and
isn’t charging extra for them.</p>
<p>First Watch is also increasing portion sizes for non-egg items like
meat and potatoes, Tomasso said.</p>
<p>Richardson, of Eggs Up Grill, said he recently met with franchisees
to discuss adding a surcharge but they decided against it.</p>
<p>“Eggs have always been and will continue to be an important part of
American diets,” Richardson said.</p>

id="us-man-sues-travel-company-after-hippo-kills-wife-on-zambia-trip">US
man sues travel company after hippo kills wife on Zambia trip</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A New Jersey man whose wife was killed in a horrific hippopotamus
attack last year during a safari in Africa is suing the U.S. company
that arranged the trip, alleging it failed to ensure their safety and
did not adequately screen and supervise the tour guides.</p>
<p>Craig and Lisa Manders were on a guided walk in Zambia in June when a
hippo charged out of the water, grabbed Lisa Manders by its mouth and
crushed her head and body with its bite, according to the lawsuit filed
against African Portfolio, a safari tour company based in Greenwich,
Connecticut. The company denies the lawsuit’s allegations.</p>
<p>The lawsuit, filed Feb. 5 in Stamford, Connecticut, alleges that as a
horrified Craig Manders watched the attack, the tour guides — including
at least one armed with a rifle — walked away without helping the
couple. Lisa Manders, 70, suffered catastrophic injuries and died
shortly after, the lawsuit says.</p>
<p>“We’re doing this because this should never have happened,” said Paul
Slager, an attorney who is representing Craig Manders with his law
partner, Nicole Coates. “There are basic safety standards that
businesses are expected to follow, and that includes people in the
safari tour industry. And those were not followed, and the consequences
here were absolutely devastating.”</p>
<p>Slager said the lawsuit seeks monetary damages that have not yet been
determined, as well as accountability for Lisa Manders’ death and
keeping others safe in the future. He said Craig Manders was not giving
interviews.</p>
<p>The Manderses, of Cranford, New Jersey, were on a special anniversary
trip and it was their first time in Africa, Slager said. Lisa Manders
had worked in the financial industry for over 40 years and loved
cooking, traveling and visiting New York City, where she was born in
Queens in 1953, according to her obituary. The couple had three children
and a granddaughter.</p>
<p>The company’s lawyer, Rodney Gould, said it was not negligent or
reckless in connection with Lisa Manders’ death. He said African
Portfolio only arranged the couple’s lodging and the owners of the
lodging, Chiawa Safaris in Zambia, provided the tour guides.</p>
<p>“It’s a horrible tragedy when somebody goes on one of these trips and
is injured or killed. It’s awful,” Gould said. “I think it’s important
to understand what African Portfolio’s role in this is. It’s a tour
operator. It arranges trips. It puts together the pieces.”</p>
<p>He added, “My client didn’t conduct the safari. It arranged it. It
booked all the components.”</p>
<p>Gould also said the company was not negligent in vetting Chiawa,
because it has an excellent reputation. He said African Portfolio will
either ask a judge to dismiss the lawsuit or request that the matter go
to arbitration, which was a condition of an agreement the Manderses
signed for the trip.</p>
<p>In a statement, African Portfolio did not directly address the
lawsuit. It said Chiawa arranged the walking safari and guests were
accompanied by an experienced and highly trained guide, a ranger and an
armed National Park scout. It said Chiawa told authorities that safety
measures were implemented before the attack and “repeated warnings” were
issued to guests to return to the safety of the vehicle “during the
incident.”</p>
<p>Asked whether the guests were warned about the hippo before the
attack, African Portfolio said in an email only that “the statement is
an accurate reflection of the events as we understand them.” Gould
declined to comment.</p>
<p>The company also said its founder flew to Zambia immediately after
the attack and joined Chiawa’s owner in ensuring that “everything
possible was being done to support the family and all those involved.
Our thoughts and prayers continue to be with the family, and everyone
else involved in this tragic incident.”</p>
<p>The lawsuit, which does not mention Chiawa, says African safaris are
“inherently dangerous activities” because of the unpredictability and
sometime aggressive nature of wild animals, and they require careful
planning and execution to be completed safely. It says African Portfolio
vetted and oversaw the tour guides and vouched that they were competent,
qualified and trained to keep people safe.</p>
<p>The suit alleges that African Portfolio “encouraged and/or permitted”
the Manderses to be exposed to an “avoidable and highly dangerous
encounter with a dangerous hippopotamus in the Zambian wilderness.” It
also accuses the company of failing to provide safe conditions during
the wilderness walk and failing to ensure that the tour guides were
adequately selected, screened, supervised and trained to provide a safe
experience.</p>
<p>African Portfolio also failed to take adequate steps to protect the
Manderses before and during the attack, the suit alleges.</p>
<p>Hippos are the world’s second-largest land mammals after elephants,
measuring about 3.5 meters long and about 1.5 meters tall, according to
International Fund for Animal Welfare. The average male hippo weighs
about 3,200 kilograms.</p>
<p>Hippos are known to be territorial and aggressive at times. A year
before Lisa Manders died, seven people were killed in the southern
African nation of Malawi when a hippo charged into a canoe and capsized
it on a river. Estimates of how many people are killed by hippos each
year vary, with lower figures beginning at around 500.</p>
<p>Lisa Manders suffered “significant premorbid fear and emotional pain,
suffering and mental anguish” before her death, the suit says. Craig
Manders suffered severe and debilitating emotional and psychological
injuries that have made it difficult for him to cope with daily
routines, it says.</p>
<p>The lawsuit is seeking damages on allegations of negligence and
recklessness.</p>
<p>“He’s suing both for the loss of his wife and the impact that has on
him and his life,” Slager said. “And he also has a claim for having
witnessed what happened to her, having seen the attack, which is
unthinkable. It’s unimaginable.”</p>

id="photos-lost-in-us-disasters-find-way-home-with-help-from-people-who-care">Photos
lost in US disasters find way home with help from people who care</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — Hollowed-out homes. Cars entombed by mud. Unpeopled
roads. Belongings reduced to dirt and debris. </p>
<p>It all took a toll on Taylor Schenker. </p>
<p>After Hurricane Helene last September, Schenker was upset by the
deluge of images of Asheville, North Carolina. “This storm has taken so
much,” she said, “and it’s so jarring to see the photos of the horrible
devastation.”</p>
<p>So less than a week after the storm, she set out to do something
about the wide-scale loss. </p>
<p>While helping a friend search for belongings cast downriver, she
stumbled on a handful of photos of strangers — mud-caked, curled up in
tree branches and stuck under river rocks. The images captured family
reunions, newborn babies, weddings, birthday parties, beloved pets and
school portraits. </p>
<p>“These tiny photos had been through so much and miraculously had
washed up and were in decent enough condition that you could see what
they were,” said Schenker, 27. “It stuck with me.” </p>
<p>To reclaim the search phrase “photos from Helene,” she created an
Instagram for “something positive, which is reuniting people with their
memories.” She set up a post-office box, linked up with a volunteer
search and rescue crew, and ultimately uncovered more than 500 photos —
or what she calls “little needles in a haystack.” </p>
<p>When Schenker made her first match, she got chills. </p>
<p>Then, sitting in her car, she cried. </p>
<p>Photos found amid muck </p>
<p>We hold onto photos to keep memories alive — of people, places and
moments that might otherwise fade. Or sometimes are ripped away
abruptly. </p>
<p>Schenker has since returned more than 70 such images. A stack of them
were hand-delivered to Mary Moss, whose car was destroyed by an uprooted
tree as she and her husband evacuated the Asheville home where they had
lived for almost 40 years. </p>
<p>“It was really kind of overwhelming at first when she handed me those
pictures. I just couldn’t even speak,” Moss said. “You don’t expect
something as fragile as photos to be retrieved.” </p>
<p>Months later, they’ve received some FEMA assistance and found a
temporary home, which they’re gradually furnishing with church
donations. But some things are irreplaceable. </p>
<p>“This is not really about losing the home and all the material stuff
in there. But what’s been devastating is that that was everything we had
of Tommy,” she said of their son who died at age 12 from a genetic
disorder. “It’s those memories and the little things, the photos, that
you can’t replace.” </p>
<p>As Schenker later understood it, “When they lost their home, they
lost virtually all proof that this child existed.” </p>
<p>“It is such a privilege to look into the intimate moments of people’s
lives,” she said. “They’ve literally lost everything and they can’t ever
recreate those childhood photos.” </p>
<p>In photos Schenker found nearly 3 miles (5 kilometers) from the Moss
family home, Tommy is seen as a 2-year-old dressed like an angel for a
Christmas pageant. In another, he is wearing a toddler-sized suit; in
yet another, he’s playing at daycare alongside his younger brother
Dallas. </p>
<p>“It is just breathtaking,” Moss said. “This is one thing that the
river didn’t get to take — or didn’t get to keep.” </p>
<p>Smoke, water, ash, soot</p>
<p>More than 2,000 miles (3,200 kilometers) away, in the Altadena
foothills of Los Angeles, Claire Schwartz, 31, began to collect photos
with a similar idea: Find images, post them online, try to unite them
with their owners. </p>
<p>After the Eaton fire, but before the first rain, she panicked. When
rain and ash mix, it makes lye, which destroys photos. “Someone has to
do this ASAP,” she remembers thinking to herself. “And I realized it had
to be me — because nobody else was doing it.” </p>
<p>Luca Ackerman, a New York-based photo conservator, cautions that mold
can start to develop 48 hours after water exposure. To slow the
deterioration process, he freezes such prints — and advised to not wipe
off any surfaces, which can drag toxic oils across the print, “driving
particles deeper into the material.” Some photos are so brittle, too,
that when touched they may disintegrate. </p>
<p>In the wake of disasters, conservators like Ackerman are deployed in
volunteer rotations with the National Heritage Responders. Rapidly, he
trains art handlers and museum staff how to treat sensitive materials,
whether they are damaged by smoke, water, ash or soot. </p>
<p>Wearing a respirator, nitrile gloves and booties, Schwartz swiftly
set out to salvage photos — finding them alongside pages from yearbooks,
sheet music, and children’s art in nearby parks, neighbors’ front yards
and a golf course. </p>
<p>“The wind has scattered everything, everywhere. And trash is mixed in
with precious mementos everywhere you look,” she said. “It’s just
absolutely bizarre how stuff clumps together and travels as a
unit.” </p>
<p>Finding the photographed people</p>
<p>Normally, a local library would take in found items, but the Altadena
Public Library, along with more than 9,000 homes, burned to the ground.
Librarians are redirecting residents who have found photos to
Schwartz. </p>
<p>She adopted parts of her process from what she learned as an archival
intern at the Corita Art Center — protecting photos in acid-free,
glassine envelopes and storing them in a waterproof box in a
temperature-controlled room with good air circulation. </p>
<p>Last week, she made her first match: disposable camera photos of
teenagers, smiling, in prom dresses and glittering tiaras. The image is
flecked with damage, but all four corners are intact. </p>
<p>“It’s funny — you formulate these ideas of who the person is,”
Schwartz said. “She was kind of exactly what I pictured, just really
friendly and bubbly and lovely — you could tell that just from her
photos.” </p>
<p>Schwartz’s house survived because her neighbors stayed behind to
fight the fire themselves, but the landscape around it — full of
burned-out lots, ghostly palm trees and blackened telephone poles — is
otherworldly and changed. “It looks like the moon. It looks like another
planet. It doesn’t look like home.” </p>
<p>Nearby is Joshua Simpson, a photographer who lost his Altadena home
and studio, along with decades of film negatives, silver gelatin prints
and camera equipment. But something meaningful survived. </p>
<p>“The very first thing we found was this beautiful vintage print of my
mother-in-law holding my wife when she was a newborn baby,” said
Simpson. The black-and-white photo carries an extra layer of poignancy,
as his mother-in-law died just few months ago. “We were both pretty
overjoyed in that moment. It felt a little magical finding that
one.” </p>
<p>Above all, Ackerman said, personal safety comes first. “When you’re
picking up people’s heirlooms or family photographs, that can be
traumatic — even if they’re not yours,” he said. </p>
<p>When people survive catastrophic events such as wildfires or
hurricanes, and are left to cope with loss, they may express a wide
range of emotions — from overwhelmed to outraged to numb sometimes all
at once. Tragedies, though, can also strengthen the ties in communities,
and people like Schenker and Schwartz are Exhibits A and B. </p>
<p>“Disasters like this really bring out the best in people,” Moss said.
“You know, I can laugh or I can cry about it — and I choose to laugh
about it. Fortunately, we didn’t lose the most important thing. That’s
lives.”</p>

anthem boos in stormy US-Canada ice hockey clash</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MONTREAL — Three fights in the first nine seconds and a chorus of
deafening boos for the US national anthem marked a stormy ice hockey
clash between the United States and Canada in Montreal on Saturday.</p>
<p>An emotionally charged showdown between the star-studded lineups of
the North American rivals – which comes against a backdrop of political
tension between the two neighboring countries – erupted into violence
from the opening puck drop at Montreal’s Bell Centre.</p>
<p>The U.S. squad clinched a spot in the 4 Nations Face-Off final
Thursday at Boston with a 3-1 victory, but the result was almost a
footnote to the mayhem that marked the start of a game played before a
fiercely partisan Canadian crowd.</p>
<p>With Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in the crowd, home fans
booed The Star-Spangled Banner before the game, catcalls that have
become a regular feature at NHL and NBA games in Canada since U.S.
President Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on Canadian goods
crossing U.S. borders.</p>
<p>Then came three fights in nine seconds.</p>
<p>“I just think it’s very indicative of what this means to the
players,” U.S. coach Mike Sullivan said. “There’s two teams out there
that are very competitive, that have a ton of pride for their respective
teams and their countries.</p>
<p>“For me, when you have an investment in trying to win like the way
that it occurred – I think that’s an indication of it. What an
incredible hockey game.”</p>
<p>Canada coach Jon Cooper, the two-time Stanley Cup champion coach for
Tampa Bay who will guide the Canadian 2026 Olympic team, said the melee
in the first moments was not prearranged.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t planned,” Cooper said. “That wasn’t two coaches throwing
guys over and saying ‘This is happening’ – none of that happened. That
was as organic as it gets.”</p>
<p>At the opening puck drop, the gloves came off for real on the ice as
Canada’s Brandon Hagel and Matthew Tkachuk of the United States began
swinging punches as the crowd went wild and teammates skated back to
give the brawlers a clear stage at center ice.</p>
<p>Referees restored order, sent the combatants to the penalty box and
tried to restart the game, only for Canada’s Sam Bennett and Brady
Tkachuk of the Americans to drop their gloves and trade punches until
officials could break them apart, Tkachuk following his brother into the
penalty box.</p>
<p>The game was restarted but only got to nine seconds before American
J.T. Miller and Canada’s Colton Parayko began the third and final
fight.</p>
<p>‘Jacked up’</p>
<p>Asked about U.S. players having agreed on the fight-filled start
beforehand on a group chat, Sullivan said he was unaware of such a
move.</p>
<p>“These guys care very much about winning,” he said. “Brady and
Matthew, they play the game with so much emotion – and they’re leaders
in so many ways.</p>
<p>“It’s just an indication of how much these guys care and how bad they
want to win. I was not aware of it. Obviously, there’s a lot of energy
around this game. I knew we were going to be jacked up to play.”</p>
<p>Top NHL players from the United States and Canada had not faced off
against each other for their home nations since the 2016 World Cup of
Hockey, the league’s best traditionally skipping the world championships
and the NHL having chosen not to send its players to the 2018
PyeongChang or 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.</p>
<p>“It was probably I guess 10 years of no international hockey exhaled
in a minute and a half,” Cooper said.</p>
<p>The intense drama continued once the game began in earnest with
Canada going ahead on Connor McDavid’s goal 5:31 into the first
period.</p>
<p>But the Americans equalized on Jake Guentzel’s goal at 10:15 of the
first period and the U.S. went ahead to stay on Dylan Larkin’s tally at
13:33 of the second period. The Americans sealed the triumph on
Guentzel’s empty-net goal with 1:19 remaining in the third period.</p>

South Korea, Japan reaffirm pledge to seek denuclearization of North
Korea</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MUNICH — The United States, Japan and South Korea renewed their
“resolute” pledge to seek the “complete denuclearization” of North
Korea, according to a joint statement from the three allies released
Saturday.</p>
<p>The statement came after new U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio held
his first meetings with South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul and
Japan’s top diplomat Takeshi Iwaya on the sidelines of the Munich
Security Conference on Saturday.</p>
<p>“The Secretary and Foreign Ministers reaffirmed their resolute
commitment to the complete denuclearization of the Democratic People’s
Republic of Korea (DPRK) in accordance with the United Nations Security
Council Resolutions (UNSCRs),” it said.</p>
<p>“They expressed their serious concerns over and the need to address
together the DPRK’s nuclear and missile programs, malicious cyber
activities including cryptocurrency thefts, and increasing military
cooperation with Russia,” it added.</p>
<p>The three sent a “strong warning” that they “will not tolerate any
provocations or threats to their homelands,” and vowed to maintain and
strengthen international sanctions against Pyongyang.</p>
<p>They also said they were committed to “the immediate resolution of
the issues of abductees, detainees, and unrepatriated prisoners of war
as well as the issue of separated families.”</p>
<p>Largely cut off from the world diplomatically and economically, and
under a bevy of sanctions, North Korea with its ongoing nuclear weapons
program has been a major thorn in the side of the United States for
years.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump, who had a rare series of meetings with Kim
Jong Un during his first term in office, has said he will reach out
again to the North Korean leader, calling Kim a “smart guy.”</p>
<p>Despite Trump’s diplomatic overtures, North Korea said in January
that its nuclear program would continue “indefinitely.”</p>
<p>Pyongyang also said earlier this month it would not tolerate any
“provocation” by the United States after Rubio called it a “rogue state”
in a radio interview.</p>
<p>It has also slammed a visit by a U.S. nuclear submarine to a naval
base in South Korea this month as a “hostile military act.”</p>
<p>A summit between Trump and Kim in Hanoi collapsed in 2019 over talks
on sanctions relief and what Pyongyang would be willing to give up in
return.</p>

20 immigration judges from backlogged courts</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA — The administration of U.S. President Donald
Trump has fired 20 immigration judges without explanation, a union
official said Saturday amid sweeping moves to shrink the size of the
federal government. </p>
<p>On Friday, 13 judges who had yet to be sworn in and five assistant
chief immigration judges were dismissed without notice, said Matthew
Biggs, president of the International Federation of Professional &amp;
Technical Engineers, which represents federal workers. Two other judges
were fired under similar circumstances in the last week. </p>
<p>It was unclear if they would be replaced. The U.S. Justice
Department’s Executive Office for Immigration Review, which runs the
courts and oversees its roughly 700 judges, did not immediately respond
to a request for comment Saturday. </p>
<p>Immigration courts are backlogged with more than 3.7 million cases,
according to Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access
Clearinghouse. Applicants can wait years for their asylum case to be
decided. There is support across the political spectrum for more judges
and support staff, though the first Trump administration also pressured
some judges to decide cases more quickly. </p>
<p>The Trump administration earlier replaced five top court officials,
including Mary Cheng, the agency’s acting director. Sirce Owen, the
current leader and previously an appellate immigration judge, has issued
a slew of new instructions, many reversing policies of the Biden
administration. </p>
<p>Last month, the Justice Department halted financial support for
nongovernmental organizations to provide information and guidance to
people facing deportation but restored funding after a coalition of
nonprofit groups filed a federal lawsuit. </p>
<p>The firings touch on two top Trump priorities: mass deportations and
shrinking the size of the federal government. On Thursday, it ordered
agencies to lay off nearly all probationary employees who had not yet
gained civil service protection, potentially affecting hundreds of
thousands of workers. Probationary workers generally have less than a
year on the job.</p>

East faces flooding as snow forecast for Northeast, cold in Midwest</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY — Much of the Eastern U.S. endured a renewed
round of harsh, soggy weather Saturday, with snowstorms predicted in the
Northeast and heavy winds bringing the threat of tornadoes to the
Mississippi Valley.</p>
<p>The states of Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia and Arkansas were
under flood warnings, and people were warned by the National Weather
Service to stay off the roads. Parts of western Kentucky could face up
to 20.3 centimeters of rain.</p>
<p>Governor Andy Beshear preemptively declared a state of emergency in
Kentucky, where flash flooding was expected into Sunday.</p>
<p>“We want to specifically put assets in places that flood and have
flooded in the past,” Beshear said on social media.</p>
<p>Photos posted by authorities and users on social media showed cars
and buildings underwater in Warren County, Kentucky, and in Buchanan
County, Virginia, where the sheriff’s office said multiple roads were
blocked by mudslides.</p>
<p>The Simpson County Office of Emergency Management in Kentucky said
authorities performed several rescues from stalled-out vehicles in
floodwaters.</p>
<p>“Stay home if you can,” the office said on Facebook.</p>
<p>Flash flooding was possible in the Mississippi, Tennessee and Ohio
valleys, the weather service said. In Tennessee, flash flood warnings
were issued for much of the middle of the state through the evening.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service called the expected rain a “major,
potentially historic, flash flood event.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile heavy snow was expected to blanket much of New England and
then transition to sleet, making travel nearly impossible. The heaviest
accumulations — possibly 30.5 centimeters or more — were expected in
upstate New York and portions of northern New England.</p>
<p>“Ice accumulations up to a quarter inch (half a centimeter) are
forecast for some areas, making driving conditions dangerous. Heavy
icing in some locations may result in downed trees and power outages,”
the weather service warned.</p>
<p>Snow and arctic temperatures swept much of the Midwest and Upper
Plains, covering roads in eastern Nebraska, northern Iowa and much of
Wisconsin. Winter weather advisories were issued for parts of those
states and Michigan, with up to 10.6 centimeters of snow predicted
throughout Iowa, southern Wisconsin and most of Michigan by Sunday
evening.</p>
<p>Frigid polar vortex</p>
<p>Meteorologists said the U.S. was about to get its 10th and coldest
polar vortex stretching event this season, with the northern Rockies and
northern Plains first in line. Weather forces in the Arctic are
combining to push the chilly air that usually stays near the North Pole
into the U.S. and Europe.</p>
<p>In Denver, where temperatures were expected to dip as low as minus 10
degrees Celsius over the weekend, the city opened shelters for those
living on the streets.</p>
<p>Forecasters reported 2.5 centimeters of snow falling every hour just
north of Denver.</p>
<p>The weather service also warned of extreme cold in the Upper Plains
over the coming days, with wind chills ranging from minus 34 degree
Celsius to as low as minus 51 degrees Celsius in parts of western
Montana, North Dakota, northern South Dakota and western Minnesota.
People in those areas were urged to stay indoors and make provisions to
shelter livestock and other animals.</p>
<p>California struggles with mudslides</p>
<p>Dry weather returned to Southern California after the strongest storm
of the year. But the risk of rockslides and mudslides on
wildfire-scarred hillsides continued because dangerous slides can strike
even after rain stops, particularly in areas where vegetation that helps
keep soil anchored has burned away.</p>
<p>Water, debris and boulders rushed down the mountain in the city of
Sierra Madre on Thursday night, trapping at least one car in the mud and
damaging several homes with mud and debris. Bulldozers cleaned up
mud-covered streets in the city of 10,000 people.</p>
<p>A storm in the Sierra Nevada dumped 1.8 meters of snow over 36 hours.
Two Mammoth Mountain ski patrol workers were caught in an avalanche
during avalanche mitigation work Friday morning, the resort said in a
Facebook post. One was extracted and was responsive, while the other was
taken to a hospital with serious injuries.</p>

to lay off thousands of probationary workers in tax season</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will lay off
thousands of probationary workers in the middle of tax season, according
to two sources familiar with the agency’s plans, and the cuts could
happen as soon as next week.</p>
<p>The Trump administration intensified sweeping efforts to shrink the
size of the federal workforce. It is doing it by ordering agencies to
lay off nearly all probationary employees who had not yet gained civil
service protection.</p>
<p>It’s unclear how many IRS workers will be affected.</p>
<p>Previously, the administration announced a plan to offer buyouts to
almost all federal employees through a “deferred resignation program” to
quickly reduce the government workforce. The program deadline was
Feb. 6, and administration officials said employees who accept will be
able to stop working while still collecting a paycheck until
Sept. 30.</p>
<p>However, IRS employees involved in the 2025 tax season were told they
will not be allowed to accept a buyout offer from the Trump
administration until after the taxpayer filing deadline, according to a
letter sent recently to IRS employees.</p>
<p>It is unclear how many workers will be impacted by the layoff
announcement plan. Representatives from the U.S. Treasury and IRS did
not respond to Associated Press requests for comment.</p>
<p>Jan. 27 was the official start date of the 2025 tax season, and the
IRS expects more than 140 million tax returns to be filed by the April
15 deadline. The Biden administration invested heavily in the IRS
through an $80 billion infusion of funds in Democrats’ Inflation
Reduction Act, which included plans to hire tens of thousands of new
employees to help with customer service and enforcement as well as new
technology to update the tax collection agency.</p>
<p>Republicans have been successful at clawing back that money, and
billionaire Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency have
called for the U.S. to “delete entire agencies” from the federal
government as part of his plan to radically cut spending and restructure
its priorities.</p>
<p>Elected officials are trying to fight against DOGE plans. Attorneys
general from 14 states challenged the authority of DOGE to access
sensitive government data and exercise “virtually unchecked power” in a
lawsuit filed Thursday.</p>
<p>The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington, says the actions
taken by Musk at the helm of DOGE can only be taken by a nominated and
Senate-confirmed official. It cites constitutional provisions that
delineate the powers of Congress and the president.</p>

African Republic soldiers kidnapped by mercenaries, advocates
allege</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BANGUI, CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC — Human rights advocates and
politicians in Central African Republic claim soldiers who disappeared
after being detained last month were kidnapped by mercenaries backed by
Russia. The Kremlin has in recent years deepened ties with the gold- and
diamond-rich country’s military and government.</p>
<p>Celestin Bakoyo and Elie Ngouengue — two soldiers who led a Wagner
Group-aligned militia fighting rebels in the country’s southeast — were
reportedly detained on January 24 at a police station in the country’s
capital.</p>
<p>Ernest Mizedio, a politician from the region, told The Associated
Press that the two soldiers were among a group arrested earlier by
Russian mercenaries tasked with training militia members and
incorporating them into the army.</p>
<p>“We searched without success for where they took them,” he said,
noting that supporters had inquired with both law enforcement and
Russian security contractors about their whereabouts. “They said they
had nothing to offer us and knew nothing of their situation.”</p>
<p>Mizedio, a member of one of Central African Republic’s opposition
parties, said there had been marches and protests decrying the arrests
in the country’s southeast.</p>
<p>Neither Wagner nor the military responded to AP’s requests for
comment on the disappearance. However, a police officer, speaking on the
condition of anonymity, said mercenaries were gradually vying for
position and replacing officers on the ground in conflict zones.</p>
<p>Before going missing, the two had come to the capital to open new
bank accounts to access their earnings after being integrated into the
army. The backlash against their disappearance comes as Russia expands
its military and economic presence throughout Africa, using mercenaries
to quell rebellion and fight extremists.</p>
<p>Joseph Bindoumi, president of Central African Republic’s League for
Human Rights, denounced the disappearances, called them kidnappings and
said even if the soldiers were accused of crimes, their whereabouts
should be known.</p>
<p>“We have the right to know if standard procedures are being followed.
We have the right to see people to ensure their well-being and to ensure
their parents, advocates and lawyers can visit them,” he said.</p>
<p>Central African Republic was one of the first places the mercenaries
became active. Amid years of conflict between government forces and
predominantly Muslim rebels, citizens and officials credited the Russian
mercenaries with fighting back armed groups who tried to overtake Bangui
in 2021.</p>
<p>Yet they’ve been dogged by reports of recklessly disregarding human
rights and civilian welfare. A 2023 investigation from the U.S.-based
watchdog group The Sentry found that mercenaries train the army on
torture tactics and as part of the fight against armed groups opposed to
the government had carried out killings, torture and rape.</p>

braces for flooding; parts of California face mudslides</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SIERRA MADRE, CALIFORNIA — Much of the Eastern United States braced
for a renewed round of harsh, soggy weather Saturday, with thunderstorms
and melting snow combining to pound the Ohio and Tennessee valleys. The
lower Mississippi valley was facing the threat of strong tornadoes. </p>
<p>Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia and Arkansas were under flood
warnings, and residents were warned by the National Weather Service to
stay off roads. Parts of western Kentucky could face up to eight inches
of rain. </p>
<p>“This may be a major, potentially historic, flash flood event,” the
NWS said. </p>
<p>Heavy snow, meanwhile, was expected to blanket much of New England
and then transition to sleet, making travel nearly impossible, the NWS
said. </p>
<p>In northern New York, heavy mixed precipitation is expected
throughout the weekend. Weather forecasters said residents should expect
snow, sleet and ice accumulations of six to 13 inches and wind gusts as
high as 72 kilometers per hour (45 miles per hour) late Saturday and
Sunday. </p>
<p>“Power outages and tree damage are likely due to the ice and strong
winds. Travel could be very difficult to nearly impossible, the NWS
said. </p>
<p>California struggles with mudslides </p>
<p>In Southern California on Friday, a mountain community near the Eaton
Fire burn scar dug out of roads submerged in sludge after the strongest
storm of the year swept through the area, unleashing debris flows and
muddy messes in several neighborhoods recently torched by
wildfires. </p>
<p>Dry weather returned to the region but the risk of rock and mudslides
on wildfire-scarred hillsides continued Friday since dangerous slides
can strike even after rain stops, particularly in scorched areas where
vegetation that helps keep soil anchored has burned away. </p>
<p>Water, debris and boulders rushed down the mountain in the city of
Sierra Madre on Thursday night, trapping at least one car in the mud and
damaging several home garages with mud and debris. Bulldozers on Friday
were cleaning up the mud-covered streets in the city of 10,000
people. </p>
<p>Sierra Madre officials issued evacuation orders for areas affected by
the Eaton Fire, warning that fire, police and public works personnel
would not enter areas experiencing active mud and debris flows and
anyone who remained in a home under evacuation orders would need to
shelter in place until areas are deemed safe for city personnel to
enter. Residents of the city also had to evacuate during the Eaton Fire,
which destroyed 15 homes in the community. </p>
<p>In Pacific Palisades on Friday, some residents washed their
mud-covered driveways and bulldozers worked to clear mud-coated roads
not far from where, just weeks ago, officials moved abandoned cars after
people fleeing last month’s wildfires got stuck in traffic and fled on
foot. </p>
<p>Southern California reported 2.5 to 7 centimeters (1 to 3 inches) of
rain in coastal areas and valleys and 7.6 to 15.2 centimeters (3 to 6
inches) across the coastal slopes Thursday, said Mike Wofford, a
meteorologist with the weather service. </p>
<p>The precipitation was badly needed, as much of Southern California
remains in extreme or severe drought, according to the U.S. Drought
Monitor. In neighboring Nevada, the weather service said it recorded a
measurable amount of rain in Las Vegas, ending a streak of 214 days
without precipitation. </p>
<p>A storm in the Sierra Nevada mountains dumped 1.8 meters (6 feet) of
snow over 36 hours. Two ski patrol staff from Mammoth Mountain were
caught in an avalanche during avalanche mitigation work Friday morning,
the resort said in a Facebook post. One was extracted and was
responsive, while the other was taken to a hospital with serious
injuries. </p>
<p>More winter weather descending</p>
<p>Meteorologists warn that the U.S. is about to get its 10th and
coldest polar vortex stretching event this season. Weather forces in the
Arctic are combining to push the chilly air that usually stays near the
North Pole into the U.S. and Europe. The latest projected cold outbreak
should first hit the northern Rockies and northern Plains on Saturday
and then stick around all next week. </p>
<p>In Denver, Colorado, where temperatures are expected to dip as low as
minus 10 degrees Celsius (14 degrees Fahrenheit) over the weekend, the
city has extended its cold weather shelters for those living on the
streets. The Denver Coliseum — an arena with some 10,000 seats — will be
opened Saturday for additional space, while a free bus will loop between
the shelters across the city.</p>

id="carafano-a-free-independent-ukraine-is-in-americas-best-interest">Carafano:
‘A free, independent Ukraine is in America’s best interest’</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — James Carafano, senior counselor to the president and
national security expert at The Heritage Foundation, responsible for its
defense and foreign policy team, spoke with VOA’s Ukraine Service about
the Trump administration’s goals and considerations in the negotiation
process to achieve peace in Ukraine.</p>
<p>He explained that while not a vital interest, a free and independent
Ukraine that can defend itself is in America’s best interests, and he
outlined how to achieve this goal.</p>
<p>Voice of America: How do you and The Heritage Foundation see ending
the war in Ukraine, and what is the strategy behind it?</p>
<p>James Carafano, The Heritage Foundation: It is in America’s best
interest that there be a free and independent Ukraine that can defend
itself. And the reason for that is the United States. The United States
is a global power with global interests and global responsibilities.</p>
<p>A peaceful Europe, whole, free and at peace, that is a vital American
interest. The trans Atlantic community is important to us. And the
number one threat, physical threat to that is the destabilizing actions
of Russia. And the most concerning and destabilizing action is the
security of the Eastern front of NATO and Ukraine, that is free and
independent, that can defend itself is an obstacle to the Russians,
whether it’s in NATO or not.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, it’s not a vital interest in the United States.
For the practical matter is, the United Europe can defend itself and the
United States can defend Europe if Ukraine’s occupied by Russia. Now
having said that, are we way better off? I mean, way, way better off
with the Russians on the other side of Ukraine? And the answer is
“absolutely.”</p>
<p>At this point, what is in America’s interest is that the war stops
and that there is a ceasefire that is both from a strategic perspective
to preserve Ukraine, and that we have to be realistic about Ukraine’s
capacity to recover territory that’s been occupied. But also from a
humanitarian perspective, and I think this is very deeply reflected in
our president. More Ukrainians dying is never going to reconquer all of
Ukrainian territory. A war of attrition is never going to create a
stronger Ukraine.</p>
<p>I think everybody is focused on what the deal looks like. I think the
deals are relevant. Stopping the war is the objective. The real question
is, what do we do the day after the war to ensure there’s a free and
independent Ukraine in the future?</p>
<p>VOA: The defense secretary said we don’t want Minsk 3.0. Are we
falling into the trap of Munich 2.0, where we appease the dictator, give
away territories, embolden the aggressor, and end up in a world war?</p>
<p>Carafano: I don’t think that’s the peace that the U.S. envisions. So,
I’ll tell you what appeasement would be. Appeasement would be giving the
Russians something at the negotiating table that they didn’t win on the
battlefield. That’s appeasement.</p>
<p>Recognizing that the Russians have territory they have and the
inability of the Ukraine [forces] to retake that territory — maybe they
trade territory, I don’t know — that’s called being realistic.</p>
<p>VOA: If Russia is allowed to keep its spoils of war, what message
would it send to other would-be aggressors?</p>
<p>Carafano: That Russia has failed. Russia’s goal was to conquer and
destroy Ukraine. It failed. Russia’s goal was to have NATO fall apart.
It failed. If Russia is stopped in Ukraine, and look what they have
achieved, they’ve achieved some marginal territorial gains at the cost
of destroying the Russian army, crippling the Russian economy, and
making themselves a global pariah. If that’s a victory, it’s a kind of
really weird Pyrrhic victory.</p>
<p>VOA: Then, why would [Defense Secretary] Pete Hegseth articulate
these concessions?</p>
<p>Carafano: They’re not concessions. They are statements of reality. We
all know it’s true. If you give Putin something at the negotiation table
that he wasn’t able to take on the battlefield, that is a concession.
So, if for example you said, Ukraine has to give up the sovereignty of
its territory even its occupied territory, I would say that’s a really
bad deal. That’s a concession. We have never ever forced any country to
actually give up the sovereignty of its territory.”</p>
<p>VOA: What about [Ukraine`s membership] in NATO? Here is a
counterargument: Why Russia should have a veto power over NATO?</p>
<p>Carafano: First of all, Hegseth has never said Russia should have a
veto power over the entry of Ukraine into NATO. Hegseth has said, “This
is not going to be part of the negotiation and Ukraine is not going to
get into NATO now.” That’s no different from the Biden policy and that’s
actually just a reflection of reality. NATO is a consensus organization.
Every member has to agree. Every member does not agree. So, we all know,
the Russians know, we know, everybody in NATO knows, Ukraine is not
going to get NATO membership now.”</p>
<p>VOA: What about the future?</p>
<p>Carafano: He didn’t say that Ukraine shouldn’t join NATO in the
future. He just said that NATO membership is not going to be part of the
negotiation.</p>
<p>VOA: So, the main issue here is security guarantees.</p>
<p>Carafano: That’s also wrong. Somehow that we’re going to say
something that’s going deter Putin in the future. That’s nonsense and
ridiculous. What’s going to deter Putin in the future is, does Ukraine
have the capacity to defend itself?</p>
<p>VOA: So how do we deter the Russians?</p>
<p>Carafano: We have a Ukraine as a country that can defend itself and
that is free, and its economy grows, and it builds a defense industrial
base. And we strengthen NATO because that will equally deter the
Russians.</p>
<p>And we do the other things, which by the way Donald Trump is going to
do already, whether there’s a peace deal or not. Donald Trump is going
to put a lot of pressure on the Russians. He’s going to lower the price
of oil. He’s going to increase sanctions. He’s going to [do] a lot of
things that are going to hamstring the Russian economy. Russia is going
to be weaker. He’s going to do a lot of things to go after the Iranians.
So, the Iranians are going to have a lot less capacity to support the
Russians. He’s going to do a lot of things to put a lot of pressure on
the Chinese.</p>
<p>The Chinese are going to be less able to support the Russians. Donald
Trump can do a lot to North Korea.</p>
<p>Regardless of what happens in the actual peace deal in Ukraine, Trump
is going to do a lot to the Russians, the Chinese, the North Koreans and
the Iranians that really diminishes their capacity to sustain this
war.</p>

citizen detained in Russia, accused of drug smuggling</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MOSCOW — A Moscow court has ordered a U.S. citizen suspected of drug
smuggling held in pre-trial detention for 30 days, the Moscow courts
press service said Saturday, days after a Moscow-Washington prisoner
swap that the White House called a diplomatic thaw and a step toward
ending the fighting in Ukraine. </p>
<p>The U.S. citizen, whom Saturday’s statement named as Kalob Wayne
Byers, was detained after airport customs officials found cannabis-laced
marmalade in his baggage. </p>
<p>Russian police said the 28-year-old American had attempted to smuggle
a “significant amount” of drugs into the country, the Interfax agency
reported, citing Russia’s Federal Customs Service. The agency said the
American was detained at Moscow’s Vnukovo airport after flying in from
Istanbul on February 7. </p>
<p>Mash, a Russian Telegram channel with links to the security services,
said the U.S. citizen faces up to seven years in prison if
convicted. </p>
<p>There was no immediate comment from the U.S. State Department. </p>
<p>The Washington-Moscow prisoner exchange this month saw Alexander
Vinnik, a Russian cryptocurrency expert who faced Bitcoin fraud charges
in the United States, returned to Russia in exchange for American Marc
Fogel, a teacher from Pennsylvania who was detained in 2021 when
traveling to Russia to work at a school. </p>
<p>Fogel had been serving a 14-year sentence for having what his family
and supporters said was medically prescribed marijuana. President Joe
Biden’s administration designated Fogel as wrongfully detained in
December. </p>
<p>President Donald Trump on Wednesday upended three years of U.S.
policy toward Ukraine, saying he and Russian leader Vladimir Putin had
agreed to begin negotiations on ending the conflict following a lengthy
direct phone call.</p>

<h2 id="us-counterterror-official-warns-of-growing-global-threat">US
counterterror official warns of growing global threat</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — A senior U.S. counterterrorism official is cautioning
that the threat from global jihadists has expanded significantly,
although the resources to counter them have declined.</p>
<p>Sebastian Gorka, deputy assistant to President Donald Trump and
senior director for counterterrorism, on Feb. 11 told a Washington
conference organized by the American Foreign Policy Council that he
based the current threat assessment on several factors.</p>
<p>“Number one, jihadist groups are more geographically dispersed than
ever before, with networks extending across the Sahel, Central and East
Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia,” he said.</p>
<p>“To cite just one example, West African countries like Benin and
Togo, that once had little exposure to jihadi threats, are now seeing
jihadi Sunni actors in their territory and elsewhere, affecting their
national sovereignty.”</p>
<p>Benin and Togo have reported attacks by al-Qaida, an expansion of the
violence the terror group is carrying out in Niger, Mali and Burkina
Faso.</p>
<p>Gorka said militant groups are increasingly capable and using new
forms of technology to execute their deadly missions.</p>
<p>Gorka said that militants “remain highly adaptive entities.”</p>
<p>“If you look at their use of social media, especially encrypted apps
to communicate, these individuals have acclimatized to the new
technological environment,” he said.</p>
<p>One of Trump’s main campaign promises in last year’s election was to
tighten security along the U.S. border and deport migrants without legal
status. He signed an executive order declaring a national emergency at
the border. Gorka argued that border vulnerabilities give militants an
advantage.</p>
<p>“The global jihadi actors are poised to capitalize on global security
vulnerabilities, especially the fact that, for four years, we have had
no southern border,” Gorka said.</p>
<p>Former President Joe Biden defended his immigration policies during
the 2024 presidential election campaign and blamed the Republicans for
walking back on a bipartisan immigration bill. Biden said Trump was
involved in sinking the bill.</p>
<p>The Middle East</p>
<p>Gorka said militant groups in the Middle East, including Hezbollah
and Hamas, which the United States, Britain and other Western nations
have designated as terrorist groups, have been severely
marginalized.</p>
<p>“Let’s just be blunt — since the heinous, tragic massacre of more
Jews than have ever been killed since the end of the Shoah [Holocaust]
in 1945, since Oct. 7, our friends in Israel have literally redrawn the
map of the region,” he said.</p>
<p>The war in Gaza was triggered by the October 2023 Hamas terror attack
on Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of 250
hostages. Israel’s counteroffensive has killed more than 48,200
Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to
Gaza health authorities. Israel says the death toll includes 17,000
militants it has killed.</p>
<p>“As a result, groups like Hezbollah and Hamas have been radically
degraded,” Gorka said. This has paved the way for what? The collapse of
the [Bashar al-] Assad regime in Syria, which together represent
devastating blows to the greatest global sponsor of terrorism as a
nation-state — Iran’s capability to hurt our interests and the interests
of our friends and partners.”</p>
<p>US airstrikes in Somalia</p>
<p>Gorka also gave more details about the airstrikes on Feb. 1 that
targeted Islamic State group militants in Somalia’s northeastern region
of Puntland.</p>
<p>The strikes were carried out by the U.S. Africa Command and
authorized by Trump and coordinated with Somalia.</p>
<p>“We told the president, ’There is a cave complex in northern Somalia
full of ISIS,” he said, using an acronym for the Islamic State group.
“We have been surveilling it for years, but the last administration
refused to take action.”</p>
<p>According to the Africa Command, 14 militants were killed, including
Ahmed Maeleninine, who was described as a “recruiter, financier and
external operations leader responsible for the deployment of jihadists
into the United States and across Europe.”</p>
<p>Somali officials said he is from Oman, although the U.S. has not
commented on his nationality.</p>
<p>“The person you saw in the footage is not just a foot soldier,” Gorka
said as video of the airstrike was played. “He is a recruiter, trainer
and financier for ISIS, one of the guys who is hard to replace. We had
been surveilling him for months.”</p>
<p>The strikes were carried out by fighter jets launched from the USS
Harry S. Truman, which was in the Red Sea at the time.</p>
<p>Trump confirmed ordering a precision military airstrikes on the same
day.</p>
<p>Somali forces in Puntland this week reported success against the
militants. Scores were killed after Puntland forces repelled a complex
attack from the militants in the early hours of Feb. 11.</p>
<p>The U.S. has been training elite Somali forces known as Danab, which
means “lightning.” So far, there has been no publicly known change of US
security support to Somalia.</p>

<h2 id="stars-galore-celebrate-saturday-night-live-in-concert">Stars
galore celebrate ‘Saturday Night Live’ in concert</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — By the time Cher sang “If I Could Turn Back Time,” it
seemed as if time had indeed been turned back and every single “Saturday
Night Live” musical guest of 50 years had magically found their way to
Radio City Music Hall.</p>
<p>Of course, it was only a smattering. But “SNL50: The Homecoming
Concert” boasted an epic lineup. It was an evening of memorable solo
performances and often fascinating, one-time-only collaborations.</p>
<p>The concert, hosted by Jimmy Fallon, was only one element of what has
become an enormous celebration of the show’s 50 years in existence,
leading up to Sunday’s “SNL50: The Anniversary Special,” live from
Studio 8H.</p>
<p>But Friday night was all about music.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Return of the 1990s</p>
<p>If a decade can win the night, let’s hear it for the 1990s. A classic
performance from that decade was most likely to get the Radio City
audience on its feet, singing along and pulling out their phones to
record.</p>
<p>The Backstreet Boys proved irresistible when they broke into “I Want
it That Way.” Snoop Dogg may have sung “Gin and Juice,” but he was
trailed by enough smoke to give nearby audience members a contact
high.</p>
<p>Wearing a gigantic coat befitting a winter night, Lauryn Hill
commanded the stage with Wyclef Jean, and the crowd melted at the first
notes of “Killing Me Softly.”</p>
<p>Some comics can do music</p>
<p>Naturally, some former “SNL” cast members reprised old characters,
with varying levels of success.</p>
<p>The Culps, the stuffy music teachers played by Will Ferrell and Ana
Gasteyer, hit harder and funnier than they ever did on the show. Their
attempts at being current were hilarious and they even worked in a few
verses of “Not Like Us,” with a plea for harmony between Kendrick Lamar
and Drake.</p>
<p>Andy Samberg and Chris Parnell’s “Lazy Sunday” was welcome, but too
short. Lady Gaga was a good sport, replacing Justin Timberlake to sing
about a Christmas gift whose title can’t be repeated here. But Bill
Murray’s lounge singer “foursome” routine with Gasteyer, Maya Rudolph
and Cecily Strong fell a bit flat.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>They love Michaels</p>
<p>“SNL” creator Lorne Michaels didn’t perform, but he was referred to
all night long.</p>
<p>“I love you, Lorne Michaels,” declared Miley Cyrus, dedicating her
hit song “Flowers” to the show’s founder.</p>
<p>Raitt, finishing “I Can’t Make You Love Me,” thanked Michaels for
having her on the show so many times.</p>
<p>“Let’s give it up for Lorne,” said former cast member Adam Sandler,
introducing a collaboration between Post Malone and Nirvana. “We love
you buddy.”</p>
<p>And Marcus Mumford, lead singer of the British folk band Mumford
&amp; Sons, said he was there to represent Michaels’ admirers from
across the pond.</p>
<p>Creative collaborations</p>
<p>The night featured fascinating collaborations that brought together
musicians of all kinds.</p>
<p>Cyrus teamed with Brittany Howard to sing Queen’s “Crazy Little Thing
Called Love.”</p>
<p>Arcade Fire joined with David Byrne, St. Vincent and the Preservation
Hall Jazz Band to perform David Bowie’s “Heroes.” Byrne later also
collaborated with Robyn, in matching khaki suits, for “Dancing on My
Own” and “This Must Be the Place (Naive Melody).”</p>
<p>And for Raitt’s second song, she sat down with Chris Martin, the
Coldplay frontman becoming her pianist for “I Can’t Make You Love
Me.”</p>
<p>In another collab of sorts, the B-52s were joined on “Love Shack” by
former and current SNL cast members Fred Armisen, Bowen Yang and Sarah
Sherman, singing the “bang bang” lyrics.</p>
<p>Lady Gaga collaborated with herself, singing both parts of “Shallow”
and bringing down the house.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Most valuable player</p>
<p>Questlove is more associated with the “Tonight” show, but he is
proving to be the MVP of these “Saturday Night Live” anniversary
festivities.</p>
<p>Not only did the drummer produce the splendid documentary on the
“SNL” musical legacy, but he effortlessly kept the beat with The Roots,
his legendary hip-hop group and “Tonight” show house band, as they
covered every style imaginable, from Snoop to Eddie Vedder to Brandi
Carlile. Byrne bowed in appreciation.</p>
<p>A second Nirvana reunion</p>
<p>For the second time in as many weeks, the surviving members of
Nirvana reunited.</p>
<p>Rather than the quartet of women who fronted the band for the Fire
Aid concert, Malone took Kurt Cobain’s place Friday.</p>
<p>Their version of “Smells Like Teen Spirit” was fierce, a reminder of
why the song packed such a wallop when it was first heard.</p>

defense secretary’s Europe debut irks allies, wins Trump’s nod</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s attention-grabbing
overseas debut may have irritated some key Republicans and alienated
allies in Europe, where his statements on Ukraine and NATO went down
like a lead balloon.</p>
<p>But his forceful comments gained him a nod from one key listener:
U.S. President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>And Hegseth — who on Saturday wraps up a weeklong trip to Belgium,
Germany and Poland — delivered a message at the heart of Trump’s
“America First” agenda.</p>
<p>Speaking at the NATO headquarters in Brussels on Wednesday, Hegseth
said that a return to Ukraine’s pre-2014 borders was unrealistic, and
that the Trump administration does not see NATO membership for Kyiv as
part of a solution to the war triggered by Russia’s 2022 invasion.</p>
<p>Trump broadly backed Hegseth’s remarks on Thursday on NATO
membership, saying, “I think probably that’s true,” because, he said,
Putin would not allow Ukraine to join the military alliance.</p>
<p>“I thought his comments were good yesterday, and they’re probably
good today,” Trump said.</p>
<p>Senator Roger Wicker, the Republican who leads the Pentagon’s main
oversight committee in the Senate, had championed Hegseth’s nomination
throughout a bruising confirmation review in which Democrats united
against the nominee and three Republicans joined them, as questions were
raised about Hegseth’s qualifications, temperament and views about women
in combat.</p>
<p>Asked whether he spent a lot of political capital getting Hegseth, a
military veteran and former Fox News personality, confirmed, Wicker
said: “I surely did, yes.”</p>
<p>Republican Congressman Mike Turner said issues like the future of
NATO membership for Ukraine should not be taken off the table.</p>
<p>“We don’t need members of the Cabinet, President Trump’s Cabinet, to
be defining those in the public,” Turner said Friday on CNN.</p>
<p>Republican Congressman Don Bacon responded to Hegseth’s comments by
saying that there should be moral clarity on who started the war.</p>
<p>“There are consequences of rewarding the invader even if its leader
foolishly led over 700,000 of its citizens to slaughter,” Bacon said on
social media platform X.</p>
<p>Uncle Sam or Uncle Sucker?</p>
<p>Trump has played down any tensions. On Friday, he said he had not
seen Wicker’s comments but would reach out to him and Hegseth.</p>
<p>“Roger’s a very good friend of mine, and Pete is obviously, he’s been
doing a great job,” Trump said.</p>
<p>Hegseth, in what some analysts saw as walking back his remarks,
clarified on Thursday that Trump was the one who would ultimately decide
what was on or off the table in the Ukraine talks.</p>
<p>Calling Trump the world’s best negotiator, Hegseth said it would not
be appropriate for him to “declare what President Trump will do or won’t
do, what will be in or what will be out.”</p>
<p>He also delivered a message that resonates with Trump and his
“America First” agenda: Europe has been taking advantage of the United
States.</p>
<p>Hegseth spoke about Europe’s reliance on costly U.S. military
deployments for its defense. Trump has criticized Europe over what he
sees as its unfair tariffs against American goods.</p>
<p>The United States and European Union have the world’s largest
commercial relationship, trading $1.55 trillion of goods and services in
2023.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters at NATO headquarters, Hegseth said: “Make no
mistake: President Trump will not allow anyone to turn Uncle Sam into
‘Uncle Sucker.’”</p>
<p>In Trump’s first term, NATO was seen as a red line for his Pentagon
chiefs. Jim Mattis, his first defense secretary, resigned in part
because of Trump’s skepticism toward NATO.</p>
<p>America’s European allies were critical of Hegseth.</p>
<p>“I think that was clumsy. I think that was a mistake,” German Defense
Minister Boris Pistorius said, also criticizing Trump.</p>
<p>European foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas went further. “It is
appeasement. It has never worked,” she said.</p>

Justice Department asks court to dismiss charges against NYC mayor</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — The U.S. Justice Department asked a court Friday to
dismiss corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, with
a top official from Washington intervening after federal prosecutors in
Manhattan rebuffed his demands to drop the case and some quit in
protest.</p>
<p>Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove, the department’s
second-in-command, and lawyers from the public integrity section and
criminal division filed paperwork asking to end the case. They contend
that it was marred by appearances of impropriety and that letting it
continue would interfere with the mayor’s reelection bid.</p>
<p>A judge must still approve the request.</p>
<p>The filing came hours after Bove convened a call with the prosecutors
in the Justice Department’s public integrity section — which handles
corruption cases — and gave them an hour to pick two people to sign onto
the motion to dismiss, saying those who did so could be promoted,
according to a person familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>After prosecutors got off the call with Bove, the consensus among the
group was that they would all resign. But a veteran prosecutor stepped
up out of concern for the jobs of the younger people in the unit, said
the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details
of the private meeting.</p>
<p>The three-page dismissal motion bore Bove’s signature and the names
of Edward Sullivan, the public integrity section’s senior litigation
counsel, and Antoinette Bacon, a supervisory official in the
department’s criminal division. No one from the federal prosecutor’s
office in Manhattan, which brought the Adams case, signed the
document.</p>
<p>The move came five days into a showdown between Justice Department
leadership in Washington and its Manhattan office, which has long prided
itself on its independence as it has taken on Wall Street malfeasance,
political corruption and international terrorism. At least seven
prosecutors in Manhattan and Washington quit rather than carry out
Bove’s directive to halt the case, including interim Manhattan U.S.
Attorney Danielle Sassoon and the acting chief of the public integrity
section in Washington.</p>
<p>The Justice Department said in its motion to Judge Dale E. Ho that it
was seeking to dismiss Adams’ charges with the option of refiling them
later. Ho had yet to act on the request as of Friday evening.</p>
<p>“I imagine the judge is going to want to explore what his role is
under the rules,” said Joshua Naftalis, a former Manhattan federal
prosecutor who is not involved in Adams’ case. “I would expect the court
to either ask the parties to come in person to court or to file papers,
or both.”</p>
<p>Bove said earlier this week that U.S. President Donald Trump’s
permanent, appointed Manhattan U.S. attorney, who has yet to be
confirmed by the Senate, can decide whether to refile the charges after
the November election.</p>
<p>Adams faces a Democratic primary in June, with several challengers
lined up. His trial had been on track to be held in the spring. Bove
said that continuing the prosecution would interfere with Adams’ ability
to govern, posing “unacceptable threats to public safety, national
security, and related federal immigration initiatives and policies,” the
dismissal motion said.</p>
<p>Among other things, it said, the case caused Adams to be denied
access to sensitive information necessary to help protect the city.</p>
<p>Adams pleaded not guilty in September to charges he accepted more
than $100,000 in illegal campaign contributions and lavish travel perks
from foreign nationals looking to buy his influence while he was
Brooklyn borough president campaigning to be mayor. Although critical in
the past, Adams has bonded at times with Trump recently and visited him
at his Florida golf club last month.</p>
<p>The president has criticized the case against Adams and said he was
open to giving the mayor, who was a registered Republican in the 1990s,
a pardon.</p>
<p>Bove sent a memo Monday directing Sassoon, a Republican, to drop the
case. He argued the mayor was needed in Trump’s immigration crackdown
and echoed Adams’ claims that the case was retaliation for his criticism
of Biden administration immigration policies.</p>
<p>Instead of complying, Sassoon resigned Thursday, along with five
high-ranking Justice Department officials in Washington. A day earlier,
she sent a letter to Trump’s new attorney general, Pam Bondi, asking her
to meet and reconsider the directive to drop the case.</p>
<p>Sassoon suggested in her letter that Ho “appears likely to conduct a
searching inquiry” as to why the case should be dismissed. She noted
that in at least one instance, a judge has rejected such a request as
contrary to the public interest.</p>
<p>“A rigorous inquiry here would be consistent with precedent and
practice in this and other districts,” she wrote.</p>
<p>Seven former Manhattan U.S. attorneys, including James Comey,
Geoffrey S. Berman and Mary Jo White, issued a statement lauding
Sassoon’s “commitment to integrity and the rule of law.”</p>
<p>On Friday, Hagan Scotten, an assistant U.S. attorney in Manhattan who
worked for Sassoon and had a leading role in Adams’ case, became the
seventh prosecutor to resign — and blasted Bove in the process. Scotten
wrote in a resignation letter to Bove that it would take a “fool” or a
“coward” to meet his demand to drop the charges, “But it was never going
to be me.” He told Bove he was “entirely in agreement” with Sassoon’s
decision.</p>
<p>Scotten and other Adams case prosecutors were suspended with pay on
Thursday by Bove, who launched a probe of the prosecutors that he said
would determine whether they kept their jobs.</p>
<p>Scotten is an Army veteran who earned two Bronze medals serving in
Iraq as a Special Forces troop commander. He graduated from Harvard Law
School at the top of his class in 2010 and clerked for Chief Justice
John Roberts.</p>
<p>In her letter to Bondi, Sassoon accused Adams’ lawyers of offering
what amounted to a “quid pro quo” — his help on immigration in exchange
for dropping the case — when they met with Justice Department officials
in Washington last month. Adams’ lawyer Alex Spiro said Thursday that
the allegation of a quid pro quo was a “total lie.”</p>
<p>“We were asked if the case had any bearing on national security and
immigration enforcement and we truthfully answered it did,” Spiro said
in an email to reporters.</p>
<p>On Friday, Adams added: “I never offered — nor did anyone offer on my
behalf — any trade of my authority as your mayor for an end to my case.
Never.”</p>
<p>Scotten seconded Sassoon’s objections in his letter, writing: “No
system of ordered liberty can allow the Government to use the carrot of
dismissing charges, or the stick of threatening to bring them again, to
induce an elected official to support its policy objectives.”</p>
<p>The prosecutor, who appeared in court for various hearings in the
case, said he was following “a tradition in public service of resigning
in a last-ditch effort to head off a serious mistake.” He said he could
see how a president such as Trump, with a background in business and
politics, “might see the contemplated dismissal-with-leverage as a good,
if distasteful, deal.” But he said any prosecutor “would know that our
laws and traditions do not allow using the prosecutorial power to
influence other citizens, much less elected officials, in this way.”</p>

id="no-need-for-one-country-to-control-chip-industry-taiwan-official-says">No
need for one country to control chip industry, Taiwan official says</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>TAIPEI, TAIWAN — There is no need for one country to control the
semiconductor industry, which is complex and needs a division of labor,
Taiwan’s top technology official said on Saturday after U.S. President
Donald Trump criticized the island’s chip dominance.</p>
<p>Trump repeated claims on Thursday that Taiwan had taken the industry
and he wanted it back in the United States, saying he aimed to restore
U.S. chip manufacturing.</p>
<p>Wu Cheng-wen, head of Taiwan’s National Science and Technology
Council, did not name Trump in a Facebook post but referred to Taiwan
President Lai Ching-te’s comments on Friday that the island would be a
reliable partner in the democratic supply chain of the global
semiconductor industry.</p>
<p>Wu wrote that Taiwan has in recent years often been asked how its
semiconductor industry had become an internationally acclaimed
benchmark.</p>
<p>“How did we achieve this? Obviously, we did not gain this for no
reason from other countries,” he said, recounting how the government
developed the sector from the 1970s, including helping found TSMC, now
the world’s largest contract chipmaker, in 1987.</p>
<p>“This shows that Taiwan has invested half a century of hard work to
achieve today’s success, and it certainly wasn’t something taken easily
from other countries.”</p>
<p>Each country has its own specialty for chips, from Japan making
chemicals and equipment to the United States, which is “second to none”
on the design and application of innovative systems, Wu said.</p>
<p>“The semiconductor industry is highly complex and requires precise
specialization and division of labor. Given that each country has its
own unique industrial strengths, there is no need for a single nation to
fully control or monopolize all technologies globally.”</p>
<p>Taiwan is willing to be used as a base to assist “friendly democratic
countries” in playing their appropriate roles in the semiconductor
supply chain, Wu said.</p>

would have ‘low chance to survive’ without US support, Zelenskyy
says</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Ukraine would have a “very, very difficult” time surviving without
U.S. military support to fend off Russia’s invasion, President Volodymyr
Zelenskyy said in a interview broadcast the night before he is scheduled
to address the Munich Security Conference.</p>
<p>“Probably it will be very, very, very difficult. And of course, you
know in all the difficult situations, you have a chance,” he told NBC
News. “But we will have low chance – low chance to survive without
support of the United States.”</p>
<p>Zelenskyy also said that Ukraine has increased its war production but
not enough to make up for what it would lose if it did not have U.S.
backing.</p>
<p>Zelenskyy on Feb. 14 took part in a day of meetings and news
briefings at the Munich Security Conference as efforts to seek a
resolution to the war ramp up. The Ukrainian president is scheduled to
deliver a speech on diplomacy and prospects for Ukraine’s future at the
conference on Feb. 15.</p>
<p>He will take the spotlight after meeting with top U.S. officials,
including Vice President JD Vance, who stressed the need for a “durable,
lasting peace” in Ukraine in his speech to the conference on Feb. 14.
Zelenskyy told Vance that Ukraine wants “security guarantees” from
Washington before any negotiations with Russia on ending almost three
years of war.</p>
<p>Zelenskyy said in the interview that he doesn’t want to think about
Ukraine not being a strategic partner of the United States because it
would damage Ukrainian morale, but added, “We have to think about
it.”</p>
<p>The United States has sent mixed signals on its strategy, sparking
worry in Kyiv that Ukraine could be forced into a bad deal that leaves
Putin emboldened.</p>
<p>U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told NATO defense ministers
earlier this week that it’s “unrealistic” to expect Ukraine’s borders to
return to their pre-2014 positions and said NATO membership is not seen
by the White House as part of the solution to the conflict.</p>
<p>Ukraine demands Russia withdraw from captured territory and says it
must receive NATO membership or equivalent security guarantees to
prevent Moscow from attacking again.</p>
<p>Speaking in Warsaw on Feb. 14, he again warned that America’s
European NATO partners would have to do far more for their own defense
and to secure a future Ukraine peace.</p>
<p>Hegseth also argued that you “don’t have to trust” President Vladimir
Putin to negotiate with Russia.</p>
<p>Two days earlier U.S. President Donald Trump said he had a “lengthy
and highly productive” phone call with Putin and said they agreed that
their teams should begin negotiations immediately.</p>
<p>Zelenskyy responded by saying he wouldn’t accept any deals made
without Ukraine’s involvement.</p>
<p>Asked in the interview if he believed that Ukraine would be
vulnerable in another few years if a cease-fire were reached, Zelenskyy
said: “Yes, I think this can be.”</p>
<p>He said Putin wanted to come to the negotiating table not to end the
war but to get a cease-fire deal to lift some sanctions on Russia and
allow Moscow’s military to regroup.</p>
<p>“This is really what he wants. He wants pause, prepare, train, take
off some sanctions, because of ceasefire,” Zelenskyy said.</p>
<p>Vance, who is representing Trump at the high-profile gathering of
world leaders and foreign policy experts, said the United States wants
“the kind of peace that’s going to have Eastern Europe in conflict just
a couple years down the road.”</p>
<p>There have been a number of “good conversations” with Ukraine, and
more would follow “in the days, weeks and months to come,” Vance
said.</p>
<p>Zelenskyy agreed, calling the meeting with Vance “a good
conversation” and said Kyiv wants to work toward ending Russia’s war in
Ukraine, but added that “we need real security guarantees.”</p>
<p>Some information for this report came from NBC News.</p>

<h2 id="why-is-trump-pausing-us-anti-bribery-law">Why is Trump pausing
US anti-bribery law?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order
this week pausing almost all enforcement of a decades-old U.S.
anti-bribery law.</p>
<p>The law, known as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, makes it illegal
for both U.S. firms and foreign companies with a U.S. connection to
bribe foreign officials.</p>
<p>Transparency advocates have credited the U.S. Justice Department’s
vigorous enforcement of the law over the past two decades with curbing
foreign corruption. Critics, including business leaders, however, have
long complained that the law puts U.S. companies at a disadvantage in
international markets where certain business practices are common.</p>
<p>Trump, a longtime critic of the FCPA, voiced those concerns during
the Oval Office signing ceremony on Monday.</p>
<p>“It sounds good on paper, but in practicality it’s a disaster,” Trump
said. “It means that if an American goes to a foreign country and starts
doing business there legally, legitimately or otherwise, it’s almost a
guaranteed investigation, indictment, and nobody wants to do business
with the Americans because of it.”</p>
<p>Here is a breakdown of the law and the implications of the executive
order for foreign bribery and U.S. business.</p>
<p>What is the FCPA?</p>
<p>The FCPA is a U.S. law that prohibits companies from providing cash
payments or valuable gifts to foreign officials for business advantages.
While the law exempts certain “facilitation payments,” it prohibits the
use of third parties to make bribes.</p>
<p>The FCPA was enacted in 1977 following post-Watergate investigations
that revealed widespread foreign bribery by U.S.-based multinational
corporations. Congress, concerned about the impact on U.S. foreign
policy and international standing, responded by criminalizing such
practices, imposing prison terms and substantial penalties on
violators.</p>
<p>Though initially focused on American companies, the law’s
jurisdiction has expanded substantially. It now extends to any foreign
business or individual with connections to the U.S. This broad reach
enables prosecutors to pursue cases against foreign firms — for example,
a Dutch company with a subsidiary based in Ohio accused of paying off
Chinese officials through another subsidiary in Thailand.</p>
<p>The law has had a significant impact on the development of
anti-corruption laws around the world. In 1997, the Paris-based
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development used the FCPA as a
model for its Anti-Bribery Convention, which now has 46 member
countries.</p>
<p>While enforcement of FCPA was negligible in the decades following its
enactment, the early 2000s marked a significant shift. The Justice
Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission, the two agencies
responsible for enforcing FCPA’s provisions, ramped up enforcement,
driven in part by emerging business scandals and new congressional
requirements for corporate governance and financial reporting.</p>
<p>How has the law been used in recent years?</p>
<p>In recent years, U.S. foreign bribery law enforcement has been
robust, with the Justice Department and the SEC opening nearly 174
investigations between 2018 and 2021. Last year, the Justice Department
alone filed 17 enforcement actions under the law.</p>
<p>Latin America has emerged as a particular hot spot for U.S.
investigators in recent years.</p>
<p>In 2016, two Brazilian companies agreed to pay a combined $3.5
billion after pleading guilty in a sprawling international foreign
bribery case. U.S. authorities investigated the case in part because the
illicit payments were made through U.S. bank accounts. </p>
<p>In 2020, Airbus SE, the European aircraft maker, agreed to pay nearly
$4 billion to resolve foreign bribery charges brought in the U.S.,
Britain and France. Airbus admitted using intermediaries to bribe
government officials and airline executives to win lucrative contracts
in China and other countries. </p>
<p>In January 2024, SAP SE, a German software company with offices in
the U.S., agreed to pay $220 million to resolve investigations into
bribery payments to South African and Indonesia officials.</p>
<p>In December, AAR Corp., an Illinois-based aviation services company,
agreed to pay more than $55 million to resolve investigations into
bribery payments to government officials in Nepal and South Africa.</p>
<p>Several cases have involved India. In November, prosecutors charged
three former employees of a Canadian institutional investor in
connection with a bribery scheme involving Indian billionaire Gautam
Adani and two other executives.</p>
<p>Why is Trump pausing FCPA enforcement?</p>
<p>Trump, a real estate tycoon-turned-president, has been a vocal critic
of the law since well before his first term. In 2012, he called it a
“horrible” and “ridiculous” statute that impeded U.S. companies’ ability
to do business abroad.</p>
<p>Despite his criticism, FCPA enforcement actually surged during his
first term in office, with 2000 marking a record-breaking year,
according to the Morrison Foerster law firm.</p>
<p>The executive order frames the pause in enforcement as part of the
president’s broader agenda to “advance American economic and national
security by eliminating excessive barriers to American commerce
abroad.”</p>
<p>The order says the FCPA’s scope has been “stretched beyond proper
bounds and abused in a manner that harms the interests of the United
States.” A White House fact sheet on the order released Monday says the
“overenforcement” of the law harms U.S. companies and “infringes on the
President’s Article II authority to conduct foreign affairs.”</p>
<p>This concern about aggressive enforcement isn’t new, said Mike
Koehler, a law professor and leading authority on the FCPA, who noted
that both Republicans and Democrats have raised similar issues over the
past two decades.</p>
<p>“There has been a focus on the quantity of enforcement actions
compared to the quality of those enforcement actions,” Koehler told VOA.
“Enforcement has in many cases has gone so far off the rails that this
law is being enforced in ways that do put companies at a competitive
disadvantage.”</p>
<p>Transparency advocates, however, warn that suspending enforcement
could deal a significant blow to global anti-bribery efforts.</p>
<p>“This pause will work to the advantage of unscrupulous business
actors around the world who until now feared U.S. criminal pursuits,”
Transparency International said in a statement calling on other OECD
Anti-Bribery Convention members to increase their enforcement following
the U.S. shift in policy.</p>
<p>What are the implications for investigating foreign bribery?</p>
<p>The executive order imposes a six-month freeze on foreign bribery
investigations by the Justice Department. Almost all FCPA cases will be
suspended while Attorney General Pam Bondi conducts a review and revises
enforcement guidelines. The executive order gives Bondi discretion to
extend the pause for an additional six months.</p>
<p>Bondi, however, has directed federal prosecutors to prioritize FCPA
cases involving cartels and transnational criminal organizations.</p>
<p>And corporate lawyers were quick to caution clients that the
executive order doesn’t give them free rein.</p>
<p>“Bribery is still illegal,” attorneys at the Arnold &amp; Porter law
firm wrote in an analysis of the executive order. “The FCPA remains on
the books; Congress has not repealed it. And many other state, federal
and foreign laws still prohibit bribery.”</p>

Blimp at 100: ‘Floating piece of Americana’ still thrives</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>DAYTONA BEACH, FLORIDA — Flying a few hundred feet above the streets
and shores of Daytona Beach, the Goodyear Blimp draws a crowd.  </p>
<p>Onlookers stare and point. Drivers pull over for better looks,
snapping pictures, recording videos and trying to line up the perfect
selfie.  </p>
<p>For some, it’s nostalgic. For others, it’s a glimpse at a
larger-than-life advertising icon. </p>
<p>At 100 years old, the blimp is an ageless star in the sky. And the
246-foot-long airship will be in the background of the Daytona 500 on
Sunday — roughly 1,500 feet above Daytona International Speedway,
actually — to celebrate its latest and greatest anniversary tour.  </p>
<p>Even though remote camera technologies — drones, mostly — are
improving regularly and changing the landscape of aerial footage, the
blimp continues to carve out a niche. </p>
<p>At Daytona, with the usual 40-car field racing around a 2½-mile super
speedway, views from the blimp aptly provide the scope of the event.
 </p>
<p>“It’s great to show the pack racing,” Fox Sports director Artie
Kempner said, adding that he expected to use aerial shots from the blimp
about 50 times during Sunday’s race. </p>
<p> The Goodyear Blimp has been a regular at major sporting events since
flying above the 1955 Rose Bowl. A few years later, it became a service
vehicle for television coverage while simultaneously functioning as a
highly visible advertising platform.  </p>
<p>It’s been at every Daytona 500 since 1962. During that streak, blimps
have undergone wholesale changes and improved dramatically: steering
technology, safety innovations, high-definition cameras, gyro-stabilized
aerial views and much quieter rides thanks to relocated engines and
propellers.  </p>
<p>Nowadays, riding on the blimp isn’t much different than traveling on
a small plane.  </p>
<p>The 12-seater comes with reclining seats, tray tables, seatbelts, a
safety briefing and a bathroom with amazing views. A few windows serve
as the only air conditioning onboard. The blimp offers a smooth ride
even at top speed, creeping along at 73 mph — well below the cars
pushing 200 mph on the track. </p>
<p>“It’s an iconic symbol for our nation, a floating piece of
Americana,” blimp pilot Jensen Kervern said. “There’s nothing like it in
the world.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The blimp has covered more than 2,500 events and taken more than
500,000 passengers for rides, according to Goodyear.  </p>
<p>Former President Ronald Reagan might be the most famous passenger,
and rapper Ice Cube raised the blimp’s street cred when he included a
line about it in his 1992 song titled “It Was A Good Day.”  </p>
<p>But not just anyone can climb aboard.  </p>
<p>Rides are invitation only, even though phones at blimp headquarters —
the three U.S.-based airships are housed in California, Florida and Ohio
— ring off the hook with people inquiring about buying a ride.  </p>
<p>As part of the blimp’s 100-year anniversary celebration, however,
Goodyear is giving three U.S. residents a chance to join the exclusive
club and win a ride.  </p>
<p>The sweepstakes will provide each winner a certificate for two to fly
on the blimp. The prize also includes $3,000 for travel expenses to one
of Goodyear’s airship hangars. It would be a once-in-a-lifetime
experience, no doubt. The blimp flies low enough to spot pods of
dolphins or flotillas of sea turtles in the Atlantic Ocean.  </p>
<p>The view over Daytona International Speedway is equally stunning,
with the ability to see every inch of the famed track while watching
(and hearing) race cars turning laps. </p>
<p>Already in 2025, the Goodyear fleet has flown over the Rose Bowl, the
Orange Bowl, the Pro Bowl and Pebble Beach. Its upcoming schedule
includes the Academy Awards, Coachella and WrestleMania.  </p>
<p>But will the blimp survive another 100 years? Drone imagery and
resolution continue to improve along with maneuverability, stability and
flight longevity. And where drones can be flown by one person, the
Goodyear Blimp crew at Daytona tops 20 staffers.  </p>
<p>But given the blimp’s longevity, adaptability and celebrity, no one
should bet against it sticking around for generations to come.</p>
<p>“Despite changes in technology and our environment, people still get
so excited to see the blimp,” Kervern said. “It’s just an iconic symbol
for our nation.”</p>

id="with-doors-closed-to-the-us-asylum-seekers-turn-a-new-life-in-mexico">With
doors closed to the US, asylum-seekers turn a new life in Mexico</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MEXICO CITY — When Angelica Delgado took a one-way flight to Mexico
as she fled Cuba in December, she was set on seeking asylum in the
United States.</p>
<p>But after President Donald Trump effectively slammed the door on
asylum-seekers crossing the U.S. border when he took office last month,
the 23-year-old recalibrated her plans.</p>
<p>She decided she would seek protection in Mexico.</p>
<p>“Like almost all Cubans, our objective was to go to the United
States,” she said. “It wasn’t in our plans to stay, but now we have to
face reality.”</p>
<p>Amid a clampdown on asylum under Trump and tightening restrictions in
recent years under the Biden administration, Delgado is among a growing
number of migrants from across the world to ditch — or at least pause —
their ambitions of reaching the U.S., and focus instead on building a
life in Mexico.</p>
<p>Migrants trying to apply for asylum in Mexico in January more than
tripled compared to the monthly average from the previous year,
according to an international official with knowledge of the numbers who
was not authorized to discuss them publicly. Mexico’s refugee agency has
not yet published figures for January.</p>
<p>“All of these policies Trump is pushing are leading more people to
seek international protection in Mexico,” said Andrés Ramírez, former
director of the Mexican Commission for Refugee Aid, which processes
asylum cases.</p>
<p>Delgado was among hundreds of migrants from Cuba, Venezuela, Haiti,
Afghanistan and other countries gathering outside the refugee agency in
Mexico City after Trump unleashed executive orders last month meant to
slash access to asylum and militarize the border.</p>
<p>The Associated Press spoke to around a half-dozen people who had
asylum appointments in the U.S. through the Biden-era app, CBP One, that
Trump canceled on Inauguration Day. They were left stranded on the
Mexican side of the border, their dreams of a legal pathway into the
U.S. snuffed.</p>
<p>Many more said they now intended to seek asylum in Mexico, citing
increasingly harsh restrictions in recent years in the U.S. or what they
said was anti-immigrant sentiment there.</p>
<p>“Now, it’s the Mexican dream,” said a Mexican man helping Haitian
friends try to get an appointment this month to apply for asylum in
Mexico following the Trump executive orders.</p>
<p>Delgado, her partner and many others had put their hopes on pathways
opened by the Biden administration to legally seek asylum in the U.S.
They said they had no intention of hiring a smuggler to enter the U.S.
illegally.</p>
<p>They said the risks of returning to Cuba were too great following a
government clampdown on protests in recent years.</p>
<p>“Crossing illegally isn’t an option for us. We’d rather stay here” in
Mexico, Delgado said, adding that if they crossed illegally into the
U.S. and were caught “they’ll deport us and they’ll send us back to
Cuba.”</p>
<p>Delgado, who is an architect, and her partner, a doctor, aren’t able
to work in their fields in Mexico because their training in Cuba is not
recognized there, she said. So for now she’s washing dishes in a
market.</p>
<p>Mexico has long opened its doors to refugees and exiles, but asylum
applications have soared in recent years, growing from 1,295 in 2013 to
a record 140,982 in 2023.</p>
<p>That number dipped to 78,975 in 2024, as the CBP One app allowed
migrants in southern Mexico to apply for appointments for entry into the
U.S. before heading to the northern border.</p>
<p>The rise in petitions for asylum in Mexico may not result in an
immediate uptick in refugees there as only a couple hundred applications
can be processed each day, fueling criticism about Mexico’s capacity to
take on the burgeoning asylum demand.</p>
<p>Amid criticisms over the backlog, President Claudia Sheinbaum has
sharply boosted funding for Mexican agencies handling migration and
asylum.</p>
<p>Venezuelan asylum-seeker Harry Luzardo, 37, said life in Mexico is an
improvement after scrambling for years to scrape by in Ecuador and
Chile.</p>
<p>Ecuador, Chile, Peru and Colombia were once the epicenter of the
exodus of 8 million people from Venezuela, fleeing spiraling economic
and political crises.</p>
<p>But with little international aid and an array of their own economic
and security crises, Chile was among countries that began closing their
doors to migrants.</p>
<p>“In Chile, you don’t receive any kind of support,” Luzardo said,
waiting patiently in line earlier this month to make an asylum petition
request in Mexico City. “In Chile, there’s nothing for migrants.”</p>
<p>Luzardo left Venezuela four years ago, but unable to get legal status
to stay and work in Chile, he decided he’d try his luck at reuniting
with family in the U.S.</p>
<p>Now, with that door closed, Mexico is his plan B.</p>
<p>“For now, I feel good here,” he said. Still, he conceded, he’d rather
be in the U.S.</p>
<p><br></p>

California slammed with debris flows, mudslides</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>After days of heavy rain, the strongest storm of the year brought
dangerous debris flows and rock- and mudslides across Southern
California on Friday, including in several areas that last month were
ablaze with devastating fires.</p>
<p>Some areas in the region received as much as 12 centimeters of rain
this week, the National Weather Service said.</p>
<p>“There are plenty of reports of debris flow,” meteorologist Scott
Kleebauer of the weather service said Friday.</p>
<p>The scorched earth left behind by the fires is now particularly
vulnerable to the water-fueled rock- and mudslides, as the vegetation
that once anchored the soil was burned away.</p>
<p>While this week’s rain is beginning to ease, that does not mean the
slides will stop. The drenched soil can continue to move even after the
rain subsides.</p>
<p>Parts of the iconic Pacific Coast Highway were shut down Thursday
because of flooding and mudslides.</p>
<p>In Pacific Palisades, a highway intersection was under a meter of
sludge.</p>
<p>Photographs posted on social media showed parked cars in Pacific
Palisades covered in mud up to their windows. Bulldozers have been
assigned to the area to clean up the muck.</p>
<p>In one harrowing experience Thursday, a member of the Los Angeles
Fire Department was driving along the Pacific Coast Highway when a
debris flow swept his vehicle into the ocean. Erik Scott, a spokesperson
for the fire department, said the driver was able to get out of his
vehicle and reportedly suffered only minor injuries.</p>
<p>In Sierra Madre, a city of 10,000 that was the site of last month’s
Eaton Fire, a boulder-strewn mudslide damaged several homes.</p>
<p>“It happened very quickly but it was very loud, and you could even
hear the ground or feel the ground shaking,” Bull Duvall, who has lived
in Sierra Madre for 28 years, told The Associated Press. City officials
issued an evacuation order warning residents that emergency responders
would not enter locations with active mud and debris flows.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service confirmed Friday that a weak tornado hit
a mobile home community Thursday in Oxnard, California. There were no
reports of deaths or injuries at Country Club Mobile Estates, but
property damage included ripped roofs and downed power lines.</p>
<p>The rain was badly needed in the region, much of which is still
suffering from drought.</p>
<p>In nearby Nevada, Las Vegas was glad to see rain Thursday, after
enduring more than 200 days without precipitation. A National Weather
Service Las Vegas post said, “Las Vegas has officially measured 0.01
inch of rainfall this morning, effectively ending our dry streak of 214
days without measurable rain.”</p>

<h2 id="us-deports-119-migrants-from-several-nations-to-panama">US
deports 119 migrants from several nations to Panama</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PANAMA CITY, PANAMA — Panama has received the first U.S. flight
carrying deportees from other nations as the Trump administration takes
Panama up on its offer to act as a stopover for expelled migrants, the
Central American nation’s president said Thursday. </p>
<p>“Yesterday a flight from the United States Air Force arrived with 119
people from diverse nationalities of the world,” President Jose Raul
Mulino said Thursday in his weekly press briefing. He said there were
migrants from China, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and other
countries, aboard. </p>
<p>The president said it was the first of three planned flights that
were expected to total about 360 people. “It’s not something massive,”
he said. </p>
<p>The migrants were expected to be moved to a shelter in Panama’s
Darien region before being returned to their countries, Mulino
said. </p>
<p>Asked later Thursday why Panama was acting as a stopover for these
deportations, Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos Ruiz Hernandez said that it
was something the U.S. government had requested. He also said the U.S.
government was paying for the repatriations through U.N. immigration
agencies. </p>
<p>The migrants who arrived Wednesday had been detained after crossing
the U.S. border and did not have criminal records, he said. </p>
<p>Last week, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Mulino in
Panama. While U.S. President Donald Trump’s demands to retake control of
the Panama Canal dominated the visit, Mulino also discussed Panama’s
efforts to slow migration through the Darien Gap and he offered Panama
as a bridge to send U.S. deportees back to their countries. </p>
<p>Rubio secured agreements on the trip with Guatemala and El Salvador
as well, to accept migrants from other nations in what was seen as the
laying groundwork for expanding U.S. capacity to speedily deport
migrants. </p>
<p>Migration through the Darien Gap connecting Panama and Colombia was
down about 90% in January compared to the same month a year
earlier. </p>
<p>Since Mulino entered office last year, Panama has made dozens of
deportation flights, most funded by the U.S. government. </p>
<p>Ruiz said Thursday that Panama “has been completely willing to
participate and cooperate in this request they have made of us.”</p>

<p>date: 2025-02-15, from: Market Place, Make me Smart</p>
<p>
Associated Press journalists have been blocked from accessing spaces
like the Oval Office after the organization opted not to use the term
“Gulf of America.” We’ll unpack the conundrum this creates for other
news outlets covering the White House. And, while the GOP eyes spending
cuts to key social safety net programs, some Republican representatives
are feeling pressure from their constituents. We’ll get into it. Plus, a
penny for your thoughts on getting rid of the penny. We’ll weigh in
during a round of Half Full/Half Empty!

<p>Ukraine’s vast reserves of critical minerals give it the potential to

considering a deal that would continue U.S. support for Ukraine in the
war against Russia in exchange for access to its minerals. That proposed
agreement is set for discussion at the Munich Security Conference.

id="helicopter-crew-might-not-have-heard-towers-instructions-before-crash-say-investigators">Helicopter
crew might not have heard tower’s instructions before crash, say
investigators</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The crew of the Army helicopter that collided in midair
with an American Airlines jet near Washington’s Ronald Reagan National
Airport may have had inaccurate altitude readings in the moments before
the crash, and also may not have heard key instructions from air traffic
controllers to move behind the plane, investigators said Friday.</p>
<p>National Transportation Safety Board Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy told
reporters that the recording from the Black Hawk helicopter cockpit
suggested an incomplete radio transmission may have left the crew
without an understanding of how it should shift position just before the
January 29 crash, in which all 67 aboard the two aircraft were
killed.</p>
<p>“That transmission was interrupted — it was stepped on,” she said,
leaving them unable to hear the words “pass behind the” because the
helicopter’s microphone key was pressed at the same moment.</p>
<p>The helicopter pilots also may have missed part of another
communication, when the tower said the jet was shifting to a different
runway, she said.</p>
<p>Homendy said the helicopter was on a check flight that night where
the pilot was undergoing an annual test and a test on using night vision
goggles. Investigators believe the crew was wearing night vision goggles
throughout the flight.</p>
<p>It will take more than a year to get the final NTSB report on the
collision, and Homendy warned reporters that many issues were still
being investigated.</p>
<p>“We’re only a couple weeks out” from the crash, she said. “We have a
lot of work to do.”</p>
<p>The collision was the deadliest plane crash in the U.S. since 2001,
when a jet slammed into a New York City neighborhood just after takeoff,
killing all 260 people on board and five more on the ground.</p>
<p>William Waldock, professor of safety science at Embry-Riddle
Aeronautical University, said stepped-on transmissions — where a pressed
microphone key blocks incoming communication — is a well-known problem
in aviation.</p>
<p>“It’s an old story and it’s one of the problems oftentimes with radio
communications,” he said.</p>
<p>The collision likely occurred at an altitude of about 325 feet,
investigators have said, which would put the Black Hawk above its
200-foot limit for that location.</p>
<p>Cockpit conversations a few minutes before the crash indicated
conflicting altitude data, Homendy said, with the helicopter’s pilot
calling out that they were then at 300 feet, but the instructor pilot
saying it was 400 feet, Homendy said.</p>
<p>“We are looking at the possibility there may be bad data,” she
said.</p>
<p>That generation of Black Hawks typically has two types of altimeters
– one relying on barometric pressure and the other on radio frequency
signals bounced off the ground. Helicopter pilots typically rely on
barometric readings while flying, but the helicopter’s black box
captures its radio altitude.</p>
<p>The radio altitude at the time of the impact put the Black Hawk at
278 feet, Homendy said.</p>
<p>“But I want to caution, that does not mean that’s what the Black Hawk
crew was seeing on the barometric altimeters in the cockpit,” she
said.</p>
<p>Waldock said the helicopter pilots, with their night vision goggles
interfering with their peripheral vision, may have wrongly focused on a
plane that took off just before the collision.</p>
<p>“If they did indeed lock onto that departing airplane and assume
that’s the traffic they were supposed to be avoiding, they didn’t see
the other airplane coming,” he said.</p>
<p>The Army has said the Black Hawk crew was highly experienced and
accustomed to the crowded skies around the nation’s capital.</p>

<h2 id="new-york-city-mayor-to-allow-ice-agents-at-rikers-jail">New York
City mayor to allow ICE agents at Rikers jail</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — New York City Mayor Eric Adams says he will allow federal
immigration officials to operate at the city’s Rikers Island jail
following a meeting Thursday with President Donald Trump’s border
czar.</p>
<p>Adams said he will issue an executive order reestablishing U.S.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement presence at the complex — one of the
nation’s largest and most notorious lockups — as had been the case under
prior administrations.</p>
<p>The Democrat said ICE agents would be focused on assisting the
corrections department’s intelligence bureau in criminal investigations,
particularly those focused on violent criminals and gangs.</p>
<p>“As I have always said, immigrants have been crucial in building our
city and will continue to be key to our future success, but we must fix
our long-broken immigration system,” Adams said in a statement. “That is
why I have been clear that I want to work with the new federal
administration, not war with them, to find common ground and make better
the lives of New Yorkers.”</p>
<p>Opponents dismissed the move as a “needless concession” and “legally
dubious.”</p>
<p>“ICE’s presence on Rikers serves no legitimate purpose and opens the
door to unlawful collusion between local law enforcement and federal
immigration officials in violation of our city’s well-established
sanctuary protections,” Zach Ahmad, senior policy counsel at the New
York Civil Liberties Union, said.</p>
<p>Trump’s border czar, Thomas Homan, argued that having an ICE presence
at local jails is crucial to removing violent criminals who have entered
the country illegally.</p>
<p>“For the naysayers, the city council who wants nothing to do with
ICE, they need to understand: If we arrest the bad guy at Rikers Island,
then the alien’s safe, the officer’s safe, the community’s safe,” he
said in an interview with NewsMax after the meeting.</p>
<p>Troubled relationship</p>
<p>Homan met with Adams at a federal office building in Manhattan as the
Republican administration pushes for more help detaining and deporting
people accused of crimes.</p>
<p>ICE has long had a contentious relationship with New York, which has
rules and laws limiting police cooperation with federal immigration
enforcement.</p>
<p>Immigration officials, for example, aren’t able to request that city
jails hold people wanted for civil immigration law violations past when
they would ordinarily be released from custody, under city policy.</p>
<p>New York City also has passed measures that curtail ICE’s access to
public schools and other city properties.</p>
<p>Adams, who faces a Democratic primary in June, has said he favors
loosening these so-called sanctuary policies, but he doesn’t have the
broad power to do so as mayor.</p>
<p>Adams said he talked with Homan about ways to embed more New York
police detectives into federal task forces focused on violent gangs and
criminal activity, as well as allowing ICE agents to participate in
regular meetings with law enforcement agencies in the city.</p>
<p>“We walked away with some real tangible things we can do together,
and I’m looking forward to aligning with him and other federal partners
to remove dangerous people from our streets,” he said in a radio show
interview after the meeting.</p>
<p>Mayor under pressure</p>
<p>The Democrat is under unique pressure to cooperate with the Trump
administration’s immigration crackdown.</p>
<p>On Monday, the U.S. Justice Department ordered federal prosecutors in
Manhattan to dismiss corruption charges against Adams so he could focus
on assisting the president’s immigration agenda.</p>
<p>As of Thursday, the criminal charges remained in place. If the case
is ultimately dropped, the Justice Department says it will conduct a
review after the November mayoral election to assess whether it should
be reinstated.</p>
<p>Immigration advocates worry Adams might feel pressure from the Trump
administration to disregard or rescind some of the city’s sanctuary
protections, which come from a patchwork of state and city laws and
mayoral executive orders, some stretching back decades.</p>
<p>Adams has already ordered city officials to lawfully cooperate with
Trump’s agenda around immigration and other issues, though the
administration’s instructions have sparked confusion among some city
workers and contractors.</p>
<p>Adams confirmed later that he also discussed with Homan restoring
more than $80 million meant to defray the city’s costs for sheltering
homeless migrants that the Federal Emergency Management Agency
unexpectedly clawed back Wednesday.</p>
<p>“I’m not happy about losing $80 million, and we had a conversation on
that,” he said during a local television interview.</p>
<p>The Adams administration has leased several hotels and vacant
buildings and repurposed them as migrant shelters as the city has tried
to house an estimated 230,000 people who have arrived from the U.S.
southern border in recent years.</p>
<p>Adams reflects on challenges</p>
<p>In a local radio interview after the meeting, Adams also reflected on
the week’s turn of events with a mix of relief and defiance.</p>
<p>“I did nothing wrong. No American should endure what I had to
endure,” he said on WABC, referring to the “humiliation and
embarrassment” of the monthslong federal corruption probe.</p>
<p>As he gears up for a bruising primary fight, Adams said he wants New
Yorkers to see his resiliency.</p>
<p>“We’ve all gone through some hard times,” he said. “No matter what
you’re going through, have faith in yourself, faith in God, faith in
your family, faith in your country, and you will navigate through
it.”</p>

id="hhs-to-lose-thousands-of-workers-under-probationary-job-cuts">HHS to
lose thousands of workers under probationary job cuts</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. Department of Health and Human Services officials expect most of
the agency’s roughly 5,200 probationary employees to be fired Friday
under the Trump administration’s move to get rid of nearly all
probationary employees, according to an audio recording of a National
Institutes of Health department meeting.</p>
<p>In that meeting, an NIH office director told employees that some
probationary staff with specialized skills might be spared. Probationary
staff being terminated would receive an email Friday afternoon,
according to audio shared with The Associated Press.</p>
<p>Among those being cut are nearly 1,300 probationary employees at the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — roughly one-tenth of the
agency’s workforce.</p>
<p>The Atlanta-based agency’s leadership was notified of the decision
Friday morning. The verbal notice came from HHS officials in a meeting
with CDC leaders, according to a federal official who was at the
meeting. The official was not authorized to discuss it and spoke to the
AP on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>Some portion of the affected employees are supposed to receive four
weeks paid administrative leave, according to the federal official and
the recording.</p>
<p>HHS officials did not answer questions about the specifics of the
layoffs. In an emailed statement, Andrew Nixon, the department’s
director of communications, wrote: “HHS is following the
Administration’s guidance and taking action to support the President’s
broader efforts to restructure and streamline the federal government.
This is to ensure that HHS better serves the American people at the
highest and most efficient standard.”</p>
<p>HHS employs more than 80,000 people and runs 13 supporting agencies.
Besides the CDC, they include the NIH and the Food and Drug
Administration. The department also provides health coverage for nearly
half the country through Medicare and Medicaid.</p>
<p>Its staff includes scientists, researchers, doctors and other
officials. It oversees research of vaccines, diseases and cures. It
regulates the medications found in medicine cabinets and inspects the
foods that end up in cupboards.</p>
<p>With a $9.2 billion core budget, the CDC is charged with protecting
Americans from outbreaks and other public health threats. Before the
cuts, the agency had about 13,000 employees, including more than 2,000
staffers working in other countries.</p>
<p>Historically CDC has been seen as a global leader on disease control
and a reliable source of health information, boasting some of the top
experts in the world. The staff is heavy with scientists — 60% have
master’s degrees or doctorates.</p>
<p>Those being fired included all first-year officers — about 50 in
total — in the CDC’s Epidemic Intelligence Service, according to two
agency employees who communicated with some of the affected staffers.
The two spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity for fear of
retribution.</p>
<p>The EIS, as it is known, was established in 1951 to recruit young
doctors and researchers to join the agency for two-year stints as
disease investigators. The laid-off first-year officers represent a
little less than half the service’s current staff.</p>
<p>EIS officers often are sent to different states and countries to
become primary investigators of outbreaks and emerging health dangers.
Many EIS graduates have gone on to leadership jobs at the CDC and at
other public health organizations.</p>
<p>It’s not only new employees who are subject to probation.
Probationary periods also are applied to veteran staffers who, for
example, were recently promoted to a new job in management.</p>
<p>The layoffs are part of a broad effort by President Donald Trump and
billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk to reduce the number of workers
across the entire federal government. The job cuts also came one day
after Robert F. Kennedy was sworn in to oversee HHS.</p>
<p>Dr. Joshua Barocas, an infectious diseases expert at the University
of Colorado School of Medicine, said many of the probationary-status CDC
employees are filling vital roles.</p>
<p>“It’s essentially assuming that they are not in a job that is crucial
for the success of keeping everyone safe — just because they’ve been
there for less than a year or less than six months,” said Barocas,
speaking Friday morning during an Infectious Diseases Society of America
call with reporters.</p>
<p>In a Thursday interview on Fox News, Kennedy was asked if half the
HHS staff would be losing their jobs.</p>
<p>“I don’t know anything about 50% of people being cut,” Kennedy said.
“I would be surprised if there were 50% cuts.”</p>
<p>He added: “If you’ve been involved in good science, you have nothing
to worry about. If you care about public health, you have nothing to
worry about. If you’re in there working for the pharmaceutical industry,
I’d say you should move out and work for the pharmaceutical
industry.”</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has
laid off about 1,200 to 2,000 workers at the Department of Energy,
including employees at a power grid office, the nuclear security
administration and the loans office, three sources familiar with the
matter said on Friday.</p>
<p>Democratic lawmakers also said the layoffs include workers at
national labs, hydroelectric plants and Cold War legacy nuclear sites
that pose safety risks. The DOE has about 14,000 federal employees and
95,000 contractors.</p>
<p>The layoffs of probationary workers come after three people
representing billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency
arrived at the agency last week.</p>
<p>Some 325 workers have been let go from the department’s National
Nuclear Security Administration, which manages the U.S. nuclear weapons
fleet and works to secure radiological materials around the world, two
of the sources said.</p>
<p>But those layoffs at NNSA have been “partly rescinded” to retain
essential nuclear security workers, one of the sources said. It was
unclear how many of the 325 firings were rescinded.</p>
<p>The DOE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>“It’s been chaotic for the staff,” one source at NNSA said. “We just
want to focus on national security stuff, and this has distracted us
from our work.”</p>
<p>The losses at the NNSA occur at a time when nuclear power plants have
been at risk in Russia’s war on Ukraine, including Zaporizhzhia, the
largest in Europe.</p>
<p>The NNSA is still working to secure radiological materials in the
region, one source said.</p>
<p>‘Not … in the public interest’</p>
<p>A copy of a letter seen by Reuters and sent to some DOE employees
says: “DOE finds that your further employment would not be in the public
interest. For this reason, you are being removed from your position with
DOE and the federal civil service effective today.”</p>
<p>The department withdrew laid off workers’ access to government-issued
laptops and phones just after midnight Eastern Standard Time on Friday,
which left many with no way to receive the notifications and no
knowledge they had been fired, one source said.</p>
<p>Some 45 workers were let go from the Loan Programs Office, which has
hundreds of billions of dollars in loan authority for clean energy,
nuclear and clean vehicle projects, one source said. Another seven laid
off in the Office of General Counsel had been supporting work in clean
energy demonstration projects.</p>
<p>In addition, 18 of 148 people were let go at the Grid Deployment
Office, which seeks to modernize the power grid, making it resilient to
extreme weather and able to transmit power from clean energy and fossil
fuel-fired power plants.</p>
<p>In Washington state, at least a dozen workers at the Hanford nuclear
site — a 1940s site for plutonium and uranium production for atomic
bombs, now decommissioned but highly contaminated — were laid off,
including safety engineers who clean up and monitor the site, according
to Democratic Senator Patty Murray of Washington.</p>
<p>“These reckless firings will slow down critical cleanup work and make
workers less safe. Trying to run Hanford with a skeleton crew is a
recipe for disaster that could have irreversible impacts,” she said.
“These layoffs will hurt companies, workers and their families across
Eastern Washington.”</p>
<p>Murray said there were layoffs at other DOE-run facilities in the
Pacific Northwest, including the Bonneville Power Administration
hydroelectric facility and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory,
which carries out research on everything from nuclear energy to battery
storage.</p>
<p>Murray’s office reported layoffs of more than 600 electricians,
scientists and cybersecurity experts at BPA.</p>

id="at-munich-conference-vance-warns-european-allies-of-threat-from-within-1">At
Munich conference, Vance warns European allies of ‘threat from
within’</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. Vice President JD Vance warned European allies attending the
security conference in Munich, Germany, against “the threat from
within,” arguing that European governments are exercising extreme
censorship and have failed to adequately get a handle on “out-of-control
migration.”</p>
<p>“The threat that I worry the most about vis a vis Europe is not
Russia, it’s not China, it’s not any other external actor,” he said
Friday. “What I worry about is the threat from within, the retreat of
Europe from some of its most fundamental values, values shared with the
United States of America.”</p>
<p>Vance denounced Romania, a NATO ally, for its recent cancellation of
presidential election results over evidence of Russian
disinformation.</p>
<p>“If your democracy can be destroyed with a few hundred thousand
dollars of digital advertising from a foreign country, then it wasn’t
very strong to begin with,” he said. “I’d ask my European friends to
have some perspective.”</p>
<p>He also appeared to voice support for right-wing anti-immigration
parties that have been banned from joining governments in Europe,
including the Alternative for Germany, or AfD, party.</p>
<p>“Democracy rests on the sacred principle that the voice of the people
matters. There’s no room for firewalls,” he said, referring to Berlin’s
“firewall” effort against extremism in a country still haunted by the
role of the Nazi party in the past.</p>
<p>Vance met with AfD leader Alice Weidel on Friday, according to an
official in the vice president’s office.</p>
<p>Vance said of all the pressing challenges facing Europe and the U.S.
“there is nothing more pressing than migration.”</p>
<p>He blamed the “series of conscious decisions made by politicians all
over the continent and others across the world,” and he highlighted the
Thursday attack in Munich where an Afghan national drove a car into a
crowd, injuring at least 30 people.</p>
<p>The remarks came as a surprise to the audience of leaders and top
officials who were expecting Vance to focus on Ukraine and Russia. The
vice president only made a passing remark on the issue.</p>
<p>The Trump administration is “very concerned with European security
and believes that we can come to a reasonable settlement between Russia
and Ukraine,” Vance said. “And we also believe that it’s important in
the coming years for Europe to step up in a big way to provide for its
own defense.”</p>
<p>Following Vance’s speech, Germany’s Defense Minister Boris Pistorius
rejected Vance’s characterization of European policies.</p>
<p>“If I understand him correctly, he is comparing conditions in parts
of Europe with those in authoritarian regions … that is not
acceptable.”</p>
<p>Vance’s remarks are “an effort to flip the script,” on Europe’s
concerns about American democracy, said Kristine Berzina, managing
director of GMF Geostrategy North.</p>
<p>“There was shockingly no mention of NATO, no discussion of Ukraine.
Instead, it was the presentation of a right-wing vision of democracy
days before the German election,” she told VOA.</p>
<p>In his meeting with Vance on the sidelines of the conference,
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said more discussion is needed
“to prepare the plan [on] how to stop [Russian President Vladimir] Putin
and finish the war.”</p>
<p>“Really, we want peace very much, but we need real security
guarantees,” he said.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters upon his arrival in Munich, Zelenskyy said his
priority is to speak with U.S. and European officials before engaging
with the Russians. Moscow has said it is not sending a delegation to the
conference.</p>
<p>Ukraine said its delegation will present its position on ending the
war. Zelenskyy said that if Trump could bring him and Putin to the
negotiating table, he would offer to swap Ukrainian-occupied territory
in Russia for Russian-held land in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Peace talks with Russia</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters from the White House on Friday, President
Donald Trump said Vance’s speech was “very brilliant,” and warned Europe
“to be careful.”</p>
<p>On Wednesday he spoke with Putin about ending the war in Ukraine,
which will mark its three-year anniversary on Feb. 24. Trump said he and
the Russian president have “agreed to have our respective teams start
negotiations immediately” to end the war.</p>
<p>Trump told White House reporters Thursday that Kyiv’s NATO membership
bid is “impractical” and its desire to win back Russian-occupied
territories “illusionary.”</p>
<p>His comments mirror remarks made by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth
who said Wednesday at NATO headquarters that it was unrealistic for
Ukraine to join NATO — something Zelenskyy argues is central to
protecting Ukraine in the long-term, but that Putin has long opposed.
Hegseth also called Ukraine’s desire to regain territory that it lost to
Russia an “unrealistic objective.”</p>
<p>Additionally, Trump said it was a mistake to kick Moscow out of the
Group of Seven of industrialized democracies, then known as the G8,
following Russia’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region in 2014.</p>
<p>“I’d love to have them back,” Trump said, adding that he and Putin
“agreed to work together, very closely, including visiting each other’s
nations” and added that they would “probably” meet in Saudi Arabia
soon.</p>
<p>Russian politicians have welcomed the shift from former President Joe
Biden’s policies that aimed to isolate Moscow.</p>
<p>“I am sure that in Kyiv, Brussels, Paris and London they are now
reading Trump’s lengthy statement on his conversation with Putin with
horror and cannot believe their eyes,” senior Russian lawmaker Alexei
Pushkov wrote on his messaging app Friday.</p>
<p>European leaders have said they worry Washington is conceding key
agenda items to Putin that would jeopardize Kyiv’s standing toward a
potential settlement of the conflict.</p>
<p>“A failed Ukraine would weaken Europe, but it would also weaken the
United States,” warned European Commission President Ursula von der
Leyen, who spoke before Vance in Munich.</p>
<p>It is unclear what the Trump administration’s ultimate strategy is to
end the war — a promise the president campaigned on. In an interview
with The Wall Street Journal published Friday ahead of his Munich
speech, Vance said Moscow could face more sanctions and even “military
tools” if it refuses to agree to a deal ensuring Ukraine’s long-term
independence.</p>
<p>Gaza and the fragile ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas
also are likely to be a focus in Munich. Trump recently said that
Palestinians should leave Gaza and that the U.S. will take over the
enclave — a proposition that several governments have condemned.</p>
<p>The conference will also host sessions on the conflicts in Sudan and
the Democratic Republic of Congo, as well as climate change, energy
security and artificial intelligence.</p>

id="taiwan-pledges-chip-talks-and-investment-in-bid-to-ease-trumps-concerns">Taiwan
pledges chip talks and investment in bid to ease Trump’s concerns</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>TAIPEI — Taiwan President Lai Ching-te pledged on Friday to talk with
the United States about President Donald Trump’s concerns over the chip
industry and to increase U.S. investment and buy more from the country,
while also spending more on defense.</p>
<p>Trump spoke critically about Taiwan on Thursday, saying he aimed to
restore U.S. manufacturing of semiconductor chips and repeating claims
about Taiwan having taken away the industry he wanted back in the United
States.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters after holding a meeting of the National
Security Council at the presidential office, Lai said that the global
semiconductor supply chain is an ecosystem in which the division of work
among various countries is important.</p>
<p>“We of course are aware of President Trump’s concerns,” Lai said.</p>
<p>“Taiwan’s government will communicate and discuss with the
semiconductor industry and come up with good strategies. Then we will
come up with good proposals and engage in further discussions with the
United States,” he added.</p>
<p>Democratic countries including the United States should come together
to build a global alliance for AI chips and a “democratic supply chain”
for advanced chips, Lai said.</p>
<p>“While admittedly we have the advantage in semiconductors, we also
see it as Taiwan’s responsibility to contribute to the prosperity of the
international community.”</p>
<p>Taiwan is home to the world’s largest contract chipmaker, TSMC, a
major supplier to companies including Apple and Nvidia, and a crucial
part of the developing AI industry.</p>
<p>TSMC is investing $65 billion in new factories in the U.S. state of
Arizona, a project begun in 2020 under Trump’s first administration.</p>
<p>TSMC’s Taipei-listed shares closed down 2.8% on Friday,
underperforming the broader market, which ended off 1.1%.</p>
<p>A senior Taiwan security official, speaking to reporters on condition
of anonymity in order to speak more freely, said if TSMC judged it was
feasible to increase its U.S. investment, Taiwan’s government would help
in talks with the United States.</p>
<p>TSMC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>The official added that communications between Taiwan and U.S.
economic, security and defense officials at present was “quite good” and
“strong support from the United States can be felt”.</p>
<p>US support</p>
<p>The United States, like most countries, has no formal diplomatic ties
with Chinese-claimed Taiwan, but is the democratically governed island’s
most important international backer and arms supplier.</p>
<p>Trump cheered Taiwan last week after a joint U.S.-Japan statement
following Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba’s visit to Washington
called for “maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait”
and voiced support for “Taiwan’s meaningful participation in
international organizations.”</p>
<p>But Taiwan also runs a large trade surplus with the United States,
which surged 83% last year, with the island’s exports to the U.S.
hitting a record $111.4 billion, driven by demand for high-tech products
such as semiconductors.</p>
<p>Lai said that the United States is Taiwan’s largest foreign
investment destination, and that Taiwan is the United States’ most
reliable trade partner.</p>
<p>Trump has also previously criticized Taiwan, which faces a growing
military threat from China, for not spending enough on defense, a
criticism he has made of many U.S. allies.</p>
<p>“Taiwan must demonstrate our determination to defend ourselves,” Lai
said, adding his government is working to propose a special budget this
year to boost defense spending from 2.5% of its GDP to 3%.</p>
<p>His government is involved in a standoff with parliament, where
opposition parties hold a majority, over cuts to the budget, including
defense spending.</p>
<p>“Certainly, more and more friends and allies have expressed concern
to us, worried whether Taiwan’s determination for its self-defense has
weakened,” Lai said.</p>

Vinnik back in Moscow after prisoner swap, news agency says</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Alexander Vinnik, a Russian national convicted of cybercrime and
released by U.S. authorities as part of a prisoner swap, arrived in
Moscow on Thursday and thanked President Vladimir Putin and others for
arranging the exchange, state news agency RIA said.</p>
<p>Vinnik, who pleaded guilty in May 2024 to charges of conspiracy to
commit money laundering, told RIA in a dispatch issued after midnight
that he was at home with his family.</p>
<p>He said he had flown on a U.S. plane that stopped in Poland and not
in Turkey as his lawyer had said.</p>
<p>Quoted by RIA, Vinnik thanked Putin, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey
Lavrov, Russian diplomats and special services, his lawyers “and
especially my family.”</p>
<p>He added: “What can I say? And I can also thank [U.S. President
Donald] Trump. On the whole, without him, things would probably have
been difficult.”</p>
<p>Leonid Slutsky, head of the foreign affairs committee of Russia’s
State Duma, the lower house of parliament, told the Tass news agency
that Vinnik’s return home was “yet another victory for Russian diplomacy
and all services and agencies associated with his liberation.”</p>
<p>Unlike previous instances of Russians returning home after a prisoner
swap, there was little fanfare around Vinnik’s arrival.</p>
<p>Vinnik operated a cryptocurrency exchange, BTC-e, through which he
was suspected of funneling $4 billion in proceeds from ransomware
attacks, identity theft, drug rings and other criminal activity.</p>
<p>He was freed by the United States from prison in return for Moscow’s
release of American schoolteacher Marc Fogel, who returned home on
Tuesday.</p>

id="trump-administration-lays-off-probationary-employees-plans-large-scale-cuts">Trump
administration lays off probationary employees, plans ‘large-scale’
cuts</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The Trump administration on Thursday intensified its
sweeping efforts to shrink the size of the federal workforce, the
nation’s largest employer, by ordering agencies to lay off nearly all
probationary employees who had not yet gained civil service protection —
potentially affecting hundreds of thousands of workers.</p>
<p>In addition, workers at some agencies were warned that large
workplace cuts would be coming.</p>
<p>The decision on probationary workers, who generally have less than a
year on the job, came from the Office of Personnel Management, which
serves as a human resources department for the federal government. The
notification was confirmed by a person familiar with the matter, who
spoke on condition of anonymity because of a lack of authorization to
discuss the matter publicly.</p>
<p>It’s expected to be the first step in sweeping layoffs throughout the
federal government. President Donald Trump signed an executive order
Tuesday that told agency leaders to plan for “large-scale reductions in
force.”</p>
<p>Elon Musk, whom Trump has given wide leeway to slash government
spending with his Department of Government Efficiency, called Thursday
for the country to “delete entire agencies” from the federal
government.</p>
<p>“I think we do need to delete entire agencies as opposed to leave a
lot of them behind,” Musk said as he spoke via a videocall to the World
Governments Summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. “If we don’t remove
the roots of the weed, then it’s easy for the weed to grow back.”</p>
<p>‘Vast unraveling’</p>
<p>Paul Light, an expert on the federal government and professor
emeritus of public service at New York University, said it seemed like
the administration was “inventing new methods for destroying government
capacity.”</p>
<p>By laying people off, the government will be able to accomplish fewer
things.</p>
<p>“It’s a vast unraveling of what federal agencies do,” he said.</p>
<p>Thursday’s order was an expansion of previous directions from OPM,
which told agencies earlier this week that probationary employees should
be fired if they weren’t meeting high standards. It’s not clear how many
workers are in a probationary period. According to government data
maintained by OPM, there were 220,000 workers with under a year on the
job as of March 2024, the most recent data available.</p>
<p>The firing of probationary employees began earlier this week, and it
has included workers at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the
Department of Education.</p>
<p>At least 39 workers were fired from the Education Department on
Wednesday, according to a union that represents agency workers,
including civil rights workers, special education specialists and
student aid officials.</p>
<p>The civilian federal workforce, not including military personnel and
postal workers, is made up of about 2.4 million people. While about 20%
of the workers are in Washington and the neighboring states of Maryland
and Virginia, more than 80% live outside the capital region.</p>
<p>Trump’s initial attempt to downsize the workforce was the deferred
resignation program, commonly described as a buyout, which offered to
pay people until September 30 if they agreed to quit. The White House
said 75,000 people signed up, and a federal judge cleared a legal
roadblock for the program on Wednesday.</p>
<p>However, the number of workers who took the offer was lower than the
administration’s target, and Trump has made it clear that he would take
further steps to lay people off.</p>
<p>Employees at the National Science Foundation and Housing and Urban
Development Department were told this week that large reductions in the
workforce, in some cases a halving of the workforce, would be coming,
according to a person familiar with the situation who spoke on condition
of anonymity because of a lack of authorization to discuss it.</p>
<p>The National Science Foundation was told to expect a 25% to 50%
reduction in force within two months, while the Housing and Urban
Development Department was told to plan for a 50% reduction, the person
said.</p>
<p>Employees at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration were
also bracing Thursday for reductions in their workforce.</p>
<p>The order Trump signed Tuesday stipulated that government functions
not required by law would be prioritized for cuts and hiring would be
restricted. With exceptions for functions such as public safety, only
one employee can be added for every four who leave. In addition, new
hires would generally need the approval from a representative of the
DOGE, expanding the influence of Musk’s team.</p>

<h2 id="trump-takes-tit-for-tat-trade-action-with-tariffs">Trump takes
tit-for-tat trade action with tariffs</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday took what could
become his most consequential action involving international trade early
in his second administration.</p>
<p>Trump, who signed a memorandum calling for reciprocal tariffs, told a
group of reporters in the Oval Office that “if you build your product in
the United States, there are no tariffs.”</p>
<p>The goal is to bring down America’s budget deficit, estimated to be
approaching $2 trillion.</p>
<p>The president added that the action “is fair to all. No other country
can complain.”</p>
<p>Trump ordered Howard Lutnick and Jamieson Greer, his picks for
commerce secretary and U.S. trade representative, respectively, to lead
teams to calculate new import taxes on America’s trading partners. To
assess the amounts, they are to take into consideration other countries’
tariff rates, subsidies to industry, value-added taxes — which are
common in the European Union — regulations and undervaluing of
currencies.</p>
<p>The EU value-added tax is the “poster child” for unfair trade, Peter
Navarro, the president’s senior counselor for trade, told reporters on
Thursday.</p>
<p>Modi visit</p>
<p>Trump put his signature on the edict just hours before welcoming
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the White House.</p>
<p>India is expected to be one of the countries most affected by the
action. India has relatively high tariff and non-tariff barriers on
numerous American exports. It has faced pressure from Washington to
reduce its 100% tariff on walnuts, the 70% levy on apples and the 60%
import tax on dairy products.</p>
<p>Other sectors include smartphones, pork and poultry, and medical
devices. India reduced a 100% tariff on Harley-Davidson motorcycles — an
iconic brand deeply embedded in the economy of the Midwestern state of
Wisconsin — to 50% in 2018.</p>
<p>The two countries announced on Thursday an energy agreement to make
the United States the primary supplier of oil and gas to India.</p>
<p>Trump, alongside Modi, at a Thursday evening news conference said he
would pave the way for the United States to sell F-35 Stealth fighter
jets to India and the two leaders would work to make tariff cuts in
order to reduce America’s nearly $50 billion trade deficit with
India.</p>
<p>“Prime Minister Modi and I agreed we would begin negotiations to
address the long-standing disparities,” Trump said.</p>
<p>Modi said he and Trump have set a “target of more than doubling our
bilateral trade to attain $500 billion by 2030. Our teams will work on
concluding very soon a mutually beneficial trade agreement.”</p>
<p>In response to a reporter’s question about the reciprocal tariffs,
Trump confirmed India would also be targeted.</p>
<p>“Whatever India charges, we’re charging them,” he said.</p>
<p>Some high-ranking government officials in New Delhi have suggested
finding a way to appease the U.S. president amid concern that he could
negotiate a sweeping trade deal with India’s neighbor and rival, China,
according to Aparna Pande, director of the Hudson Institute’s Initiative
on the Future of India and South Asia.</p>
<p>If Trump and China’s leader, Xi Jinping, were to forge a sweeping
trade pact, “India could face a double challenge — on the trade/economic
front and the strategic big picture front,” Pande told VOA on
Thursday.</p>
<p>“India is a country that Trump has railed against in the past,
although I don’t think it’s a particular obsession of his in the way
that China is, because China is a major strategic competitor to the
United States. Or the way Canada and Mexico are, because they are the
bordering countries,” according to Milan Vaishnav, director of the South
Asia program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.</p>
<p>Since being sworn into office on Jan. 20 for his second
nonconsecutive term as president, Trump has moved quickly on the trade
front. He imposed, and then put on hold amid further negotiations,
across-the-board 25% tariffs on nearly all products from America’s two
continental neighbors, Canada and Mexico.</p>
<p>He placed a flat 10% tariff on all Chinese goods, which prompted
Beijing to respond with countertariffs of 10% to 15% on crude oil,
liquefied natural gas, farm machinery and some other U.S. products.
Economists say the tariffs cover about $450 billion worth of Chinese
goods, while the Chinese tariffs hit $15 billion to $20 billion in
American products.  </p>
<p>Trump characterized his actions as a way to pressure those three
countries into doing more to stop the flow of the synthetic opioid
fentanyl into the United States. He also has blamed Canada and Mexico
for being lax in preventing migrants from crossing their borders into
the U.S.</p>
<p>Trump earlier this week announced that effective in March, all steel
and aluminum imports will be taxed at a minimum of 25%, an action
analysts predict could significantly raise sticker prices at automotive
dealerships in North America.</p>
<p>‘Stagflationary shock’</p>
<p>Analysts say Trump’s tariff actions will hurt the growth of the U.S.
economy this year. </p>
<p>“Tariffs impart a modest stagflationary shock to an economy,”
according to a report issued Thursday by financial services provider
Wells Fargo. “The U.S. economy entered 2025 with a fair amount of
momentum, but we look for real GDP growth to downshift a bit over the
next few quarters as the price-boosting effects of tariffs erode growth
in real income, thereby weighing on growth in real consumer
spending.”</p>
<p>Peter Harrell, who was jointly appointed to the White House National
Security Council and National Economic Council in the previous
administration of President Joe Biden, said Trump “promised us he would
be a ‘tariff man’ and he is certainly delivering.”</p>
<p>“I think this is only part of the tariffs we are likely to see or at
least threatened” over the coming months, Harrell said Thursday morning
on “The Capital Cable,” a livestream program of the Center for Strategic
and International Studies’ (CSIS) Korea Chair.</p>
<p>These actions or the threat of them give the Trump administration
leverage by having “a tariff bazooka ready to fire,” said Harrell,
currently a Carnegie nonresident fellow.</p>
<p>On the same livestream, Philip Luck, director of the CSIS economic
program, warned that Trump’s “Fortress America” will result in Americans
paying “really high costs” due to retaliatory actions by Washington’s
trading partners. If the president’s goal is to use such trade actions
partly to increase the cash coffers, tariff revenue is approximately
1.5% of government revenue, “so it’s tiny,” Luck said.</p>
<p>The United States is in a dominant position as the largest economy
and well-integrated into the global trading system, giving it leverage
built up over an 80-year period, but Trump’s actions could squander that
goodwill, Luck said.</p>
<p>“We’ve been a reliable partner for a long period of time,” he noted,
with the United States traditionally setting tariffs through
negotiations involving international groups such as the World Trade
Organization. </p>
<p>“There’s a lot of anxiety, bordering on panic in [South] Korea,”
because Trump, immediately in his second term, is using tariffs for
noneconomic reasons, said Yeo Han-Koo, a senior fellow at the Peterson
Institute for International Economics</p>
<p>“U.S. policymakers really need to see the strategic angle” amid the
regional competition with China and how they can collaborate with Tokyo
and Seoul, suggested Yeo, who as South Korea’s trade minister coinciding
with Trump’s first term was at the negotiating table across from
American officials.</p>
<p>Shipbuilding, civil nuclear power and biopharmaceuticals are three
sectors where the United States, Japan and South Korea could cooperate
to help counter Beijing’s rising trade and military influence, Yeo
suggested.</p>

judge pauses Trump order restricting gender-affirming care for trans
youth</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BALTIMORE — A federal judge on Thursday temporarily blocked President
Donald Trump’s recent executive order aimed at restricting
gender-affirming health care for transgender people under age 19.</p>
<p>The judge’s ruling came after a lawsuit was filed earlier this month
on behalf of families with transgender or nonbinary children who allege
their health care has been compromised by the president’s order. A
national group for family of LGBTQ+ people and a doctors organization
are also plaintiffs in the court challenge, one of many lawsuits
opposing one of the many executive orders Trump has issued.</p>
<p>Judge Brendan Hurson, who was nominated by former President Joe
Biden, granted the plaintiffs’ request for a temporary restraining order
following a hearing in federal court in Baltimore. The ruling, in effect
for 14 days, essentially puts Trump’s directive on hold while the case
proceeds. The restraining order could also be extended.</p>
<p>Shortly after taking office, Trump signed an executive order
directing federally run insurance programs to exclude coverage for
gender-affirming care. That includes Medicaid, which covers such
services in some states, and TRICARE for military families. Trump’s
order also called on the Department of Justice to vigorously pursue
litigation and legislation to oppose the practice.</p>
<p>The lawsuit includes several accounts from families of appointments
being canceled as medical institutions react to the new directive.</p>
<p>Attorneys for the plaintiffs argue Trump’s executive order is
“unlawful and unconstitutional” because it seeks to withhold federal
funds previously authorized by Congress and because it violates
anti-discrimination laws while infringing on the rights of parents.</p>
<p>Like legal challenges to state bans on gender-affirming care, the
lawsuit also alleges the policy is discriminatory because it allows
federal funds to cover the same treatments when they’re not used for
gender transition.</p>
<p>Some hospitals immediately paused gender-affirming care, including
prescriptions for puberty blockers and hormone therapy, while they
assess how the order affects them.</p>
<p>Trump’s approach on the issue represents an abrupt change from the
Biden administration, which sought to explicitly extend civil rights
protections to transgender people. Trump has used strong language in
opposing gender-affirming care, asserting falsely that “medical
professionals are maiming and sterilizing a growing number of
impressionable children under the radical and false claim that adults
can change a child’s sex.”</p>
<p>Major medical groups such as the American Medical Association and the
American Academy of Pediatrics support access to gender-affirming
care.</p>
<p>Young people who persistently identify as a gender that differs from
their sex assigned at birth are first evaluated by a team of
professionals. Some may try a social transition, involving changing a
hairstyle or pronouns. Some may later also receive puberty blockers or
hormones. Surgery is extremely rare for minors.</p>

id="prosecutors-quit-after-being-ordered-to-end-case-against-new-york-mayor">Prosecutors
quit after being ordered to end case against New York mayor</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — The top federal prosecutor in Manhattan resigned Thursday
after refusing a Justice Department order to drop corruption charges
against New York City Mayor Eric Adams. Two senior Justice Department
officials also quit after the department leadership in Washington moved
to seize control of the case.</p>
<p>Danielle Sassoon, a Republican serving as interim U.S. attorney for
the Southern District of New York, announced her resignation in an email
to her staff. The move was confirmed by a spokesperson for the office.
Adams’ case has yet to be dropped.</p>
<p>After Sassoon declined to dismiss the case, the department’s public
integrity section in Washington was asked to take over, according to a
person familiar with the matter. Two senior officials who oversee the
unit, including the acting chief, resigned in response, according to the
person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss personnel
matters.</p>
<p>The exits came days after a high-ranking Justice Department official
directed federal prosecutors in New York to end the case against Adams,
a Democrat who was accused of accepting illegal campaign contributions
and bribes of free or discounted travel from people who wanted to buy
his influence. He has pleaded not guilty.</p>
<p>Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove said in a memo Monday that
the case should be dismissed so Adams could aid President Donald Trump’s
immigration crackdown and campaign for reelection free from facing
criminal charges. The primary is four months away and Adams has multiple
challengers.</p>
<p>Bove had directed that be done as soon as “practicable,” but there
have been no public statements or actions by the prosecution team. On
Wednesday, Attorney General Pam Bondi said she would “look into” why the
case had yet to be dismissed. As of Thursday afternoon, the charges
remained in place.</p>
<p>In the email to her staff, Sassoon did not give a reason for her
resignation. In the note, the contents of which were obtained by The
Associated Press, she said she had just submitted her resignation to
Bondi.</p>
<p>“As I told her, it has been my greatest honor to represent the United
States and to pursue justice as a prosecutor in the Southern District of
New York,” Sassoon wrote.</p>
<p>The Justice Department did not ask Sassoon to resign, according to a
department official who spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>The department declined public comment on Sassoon’s exit. A message
seeking comment was left for Adams’ attorney, Alex Spiro. A spokesperson
for the mayor did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>The government’s decision to end the Adams case because of political
considerations, rather than the strength or weakness of the evidence,
alarmed some career prosecutors who said it was a departure from
long-standing norms.</p>
<p>The directive from Bove, a former Trump personal lawyer, was all the
more remarkable because Bove had been a longtime prosecutor and
supervisor in the Southern District and because department leaders are
historically reluctant to intervene in cases where charges have been
brought — particularly in an office as prestigious as that U.S.
attorney’s office.</p>
<p>Bove’s memo also steered clear of any legal basis for the dismissal
despite decades of department tradition dictating that charging
decisions are to be guided by facts, evidence and the law.</p>
<p>Sassoon, a former clerk for the late U.S. Supreme Court Justice
Antonin Scalia, was not the prosecutor who brought the case against
Adams last year. That was then-U.S. Attorney Damian Williams, who
stepped down after Trump’s election victory in November.</p>
<p>Sassoon had only been tapped to serve as acting U.S. attorney on
January 21, the day after Trump took office.</p>
<p>Her role was intended to be temporary. Trump in November nominated
Jay Clayton, the former chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, to the post, an appointment that must be confirmed by the
Senate. That has not happened yet.</p>
<p>The Southern District of New York is among the largest and most
prominent prosecutor’s offices in the U.S., with a long track record of
tackling Wall Street malfeasance, political corruption and international
terrorism.</p>
<p>It has a tradition of independence from Washington, something that
has earned it the nickname “the sovereign district.”</p>
<p>During Trump’s first term, the office prosecuted both the president’s
personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, and his strategic adviser, Steve Bannon,
in separate cases. Cohen pleaded guilty to tax evasion and campaign
finance charges. Trump ended the federal fraud case against Bannon by
pardoning him, though nearly identical charges were then brought by
state prosecutors.</p>
<p>This is the second Justice Department tussle in five years between
Washington and New York officials to result in a dramatic leadership
turnover.</p>
<p>In 2020, William Barr, who served as one of Trump’s attorneys general
during his first term pushed out Geoffrey Berman, the U.S. attorney in
Manhattan, in a surprise nighttime announcement. Berman initially
refused to resign his position, creating a brief standoff with Barr, but
did so after an assurance that his investigations into allies of Trump
would not be disturbed.</p>
<p>Sassoon joined the U.S. attorney’s office in 2016. In 2023 she helped
lead the fraud prosecution of Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of the
cryptocurrency exchange FTX. More recently, she had served as the
office’s co-chief of criminal appeals.</p>
<p>Adams was indicted in September on charges that while he worked as
Brooklyn borough president, he accepted over $100,000 in illegal
campaign contributions and lavish travel perks such as expensive flight
upgrades, luxury hotel stays and even a trip to a bathhouse.</p>
<p>The indictment said a Turkish official who helped facilitate the
trips then leaned on Adams for favors, including asking him to lobby the
Fire Department to let a newly constructed, 36-story diplomatic building
open in time for a planned visit by Turkey’s president.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said they had proof that Adams personally directed
political aides to solicit foreign donations and disguise them to help
the campaign qualify for a city program that provides a generous,
publicly funded match for small dollar donations. Under federal law,
foreign nationals are banned from contributing to U.S. election
campaigns.</p>
<p>As recently as Jan. 6, prosecutors had indicated their investigation
remained active, writing in court papers that they continued to “uncover
additional criminal conduct by Adams.”</p>
<p>Bove said in his memo that Justice Department officials in Washington
hadn’t evaluated the evidence in the case before deciding it should be
dropped — at least until after the mayoral election in November.</p>
<p>Federal agents also had been investigating other senior Adams aides.
It was unclear what would happen to that side of the probe.</p>

wants denuclearization talks with Russia and China, hopes for defense
spending cuts</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said Thursday that he wants to
restart nuclear arms control talks with Russia and China and that
eventually he hopes all three countries could agree to cut their massive
defense budgets in half.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Trump lamented the hundreds
of billions of dollars being invested in rebuilding the nation’s nuclear
deterrent and said he hopes to gain commitments from the U.S.
adversaries to cut their own spending.</p>
<p>“There’s no reason for us to be building brand-new nuclear weapons.
We already have so many,” Trump said. “You could destroy the world 50
times over, 100 times over. And here we are building new nuclear
weapons, and they’re building nuclear weapons.”</p>
<p>“We’re all spending a lot of money that we could be spending on other
things that are actually, hopefully, much more productive,” Trump
said.</p>
<p>While the U.S. and Russia have held massive stockpiles of weapons
since the Cold War, Trump predicted that China would catch up in its
capability to exact nuclear devastation “within five or six years.”</p>
<p>He said if the weapons were ever called to use, “that’s going to be
probably oblivion.” </p>
<p>Trump said he would look to engage in nuclear talks with the two
countries once “we straighten it all out” in the Middle East and
Ukraine.</p>
<p>“One of the first meetings I want to have is with President Xi
[Jinping] of China, President [Vladimir] Putin of Russia. And I want to
say, ‘Let’s cut our military budget in half.’ And we can do that. And I
think we’ll be able to.”</p>
<p>Trump in his first term tried and failed to bring China into nuclear
arms reduction talks when the U.S. and Russia were negotiating an
extension of a pact known as New START. Russia suspended its
participation in the treaty during the Biden administration, as the U.S.
and Russia continued on massive programs to extend the lifespans or
replace their Cold War-era nuclear arsenals.</p>

id="pentagon-chief-calls-on-nato-partners-to-increase-role-in-europes-defense">Pentagon
chief calls on NATO partners to increase role in Europe’s defense</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PENTAGON — U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has called for
NATO’s European members to increase their role in the defense of Europe
as the United States focuses on defending the alliance’s Pacific
flank.</p>
<p>It is a move that he says will likely require European allies to
significantly increase defense spending from 2% of GDP to about 5% of
GDP.</p>
<p>“We can talk all we want about values. Values are important, but you
can’t shoot values, you can’t shoot flags, and you can’t shoot strong
speeches. There is no replacement for hard power,” Hegseth told
reporters on Thursday at NATO headquarters in Brussels.</p>
<p>Last year, NATO’s European allies collectively spent 2% of their GDP,
amounting to about $380 billion, for the first time after setting a 2%
defense spending goal in 2014. The U.S. currently spends about 3.5% of
its GDP on defense. Canada, the other non-European NATO ally, currently
spends about 1.4% of its GDP on defense.</p>
<p>“NATO is a great alliance, the most successful defense alliance in
history, but to endure for the future, our partners must do far more for
Europe’s defense,” Hegseth said. He emphasized that deterrence of
Chinese aggression “in the Pacific is one that really can only be led by
the United States.”</p>
<p>He said the U.S. does not seek conflict with China, nor does it feel
that conflict with China is inevitable, but he contended the
administration must work with allies to ensure deterrence in the
Indo-Pacific is “hard power deterrence, not just reputational.”</p>
<p>Russia-Ukraine war</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Hegseth said keeping Ukraine’s pre-invasion boundaries
is an “unrealistic objective” in its war against Russian aggression, as
was the expectation that Ukraine would join NATO. He advocated for a
negotiated end to the war with security guarantees backed by European
and non-European troops that would not include U.S. forces.</p>
<p>German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said Ukraine’s potential
membership in NATO and whether it should concede any territory should
not be decided before peace talks start, referring to Hegseth’s comments
as “concessions” made by the United States.</p>
<p>“Vladimir Putin responds to strength,” Hegseth said on Thursday when
asked whether the U.S. was decreasing Ukraine’s leverage.</p>
<p>“No one’s going to get everything that they want, understanding who
committed the aggression in the first place,” he added, referring to
Putin.</p>
<p>NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte reiterated his support for higher
defense spending and appeared to defend Hegseth’s comments on Ukraine
not joining the alliance. Rutte said on Thursday that while NATO must
“make sure that Vladimir Putin never ever tries again to attack
Ukraine,” he said, “it has never been a promise to Ukraine that as part
of a peace deal, they would be part of NATO.”</p>
<p>The European Union’s top diplomat warned that any peace deal struck
between the United States and Russia — without Ukraine or the EU — will
fail.</p>
<p>“Trump says that the killing should stop. Putin can stop the killing
by stopping bombing Ukraine. This is doable if there is a will,” said
Kaja Kallas, the EU high representative for foreign affairs and security
policy. She added that any agreement without Ukraine at the table
amounts to appeasement.</p>
<p>Kallas’ comments reflected those of many NATO allies at Thursday’s
meeting following U.S. President Donald Trump’s call with Putin and
Trump’s signaling that talks on Ukraine between the two were
imminent.</p>
<p>After Thursday’s NATO ministerial gathering, Hegseth travels to
Poland for what the Pentagon said will be talks with leaders about
“bilateral defense cooperation, continued deterrence efforts along
NATO’s eastern flank and Poland’s leadership as a model ally in defense
investment and burden-sharing in NATO.”</p>

of accused ‘high-threat’ migrants at Guantanamo Bay rising</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. military is now housing about 68 detainees at
its prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as part of an effort to assist the
Department of Homeland Security with mass deportations. </p>
<p>The commander of U.S. Southern Command, which oversees the U.S. naval
base at Guantanamo Bay, shared the updated figure with lawmakers
Wednesday, but said he could not yet provide details on how much it will
cost to house the growing number of individuals. </p>
<p>Admiral Alvin Holsey said those efforts include both the detention of
individuals described by DHS officials as “high-threat criminal aliens”
and eventually holding up to 30,000 non-violent migrants slated for
deportation. </p>
<p>“We’re doing a phased approach,” Holsey told members of the Senate
Armed Services Committee, adding that the base has the capacity now to
hold about 2,500 non-violent migrants. </p>
<p>“We’re working with DHS to understand the flow of migrants,” he said.
“We’re not going to go to 30,000 unless we know that migrant flow will
come. So, we’re waiting at this point.” </p>
<p>U.S. Transportation Command told VOA on Monday that there have been
at least five flights of migrants to Guantanamo Bay, each aboard a C-17
or C-130 military cargo plane. </p>
<p>Most of the flights, according to multiple officials, have carried
between 10 and 15 detainees. </p>
<p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who visited the prison
facility last Friday and oversaw the transfer of the third flight of
detainees to the detention center, has repeatedly described the men as
“murderers and vicious gang members” from Venezuela and as “the worst of
the worst.” </p>
<p>In one social media post, Noem said that at least one of the migrants
sent to Guantanamo Bay had confessed to murder, while others were wanted
for attempted murder, assault, weapons trafficking and
impersonation. </p>
<p>One official, speaking to VOA on the condition of anonymity to
discuss the deportation efforts, said that all of the individuals held
at Guantanamo Bay have been issued final deportation orders. But DHS has
not yet provided charging documents or other details regarding the
crimes the detainees are accused of committing.  </p>
<p>On Wednesday, the American Civil Liberties Union, along with several
immigration rights groups, filed a lawsuit against DHS, alleging the
detainees being held at the Guantanamo Bay prison facility have been
improperly denied access to lawyers. </p>
<p>“By hurrying immigrants off to a remote island cut off from lawyers,
family, and the rest of the world, the Trump administration is sending
its clearest signal yet that the rule of law means nothing to it,”
according to a statement from ACLU lead attorney Lee Gelernt. </p>
<p>“It will now be up to the courts to reaffirm that the rule of law
governs our nation,” he added. </p>
<p>According to the ACLU and the other groups, one of the plaintiffs in
the lawsuit, Eucaris Carolina Gomez Lugo, learned her brother had been
sent to Guantanamo Bay only after seeing him in a photo. </p>
<p>The group also said she was shocked to learn that the government was
alleging he was a member of the Tren de Aragua Venezuelan street
gang. </p>
<p>DHS dismissed the lawsuit’s allegations. </p>
<p>“There is a system for phone utilization to reach lawyers,” said a
senior Homeland Security official in a written statement shared with
VOA. </p>
<p>“If the AMERICAN Civil Liberties Union cares more about highly
dangerous criminal aliens including murderers &amp; vicious gang members
than they do about American citizens—they should change their name,” the
official added, responding to the lawsuit only on the condition of
anonymity.</p>

aircraft carrier collides with merchant ship near Egypt</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman was involved in
a collision at sea with a merchant vessel near Port Said, Egypt, the
Navy said Thursday.</p>
<p>The collision occurred late Wednesday while both ships were moving.
It did not result in flooding or injuries aboard the carrier, and there
was no damage to the ship’s propulsion systems, the Navy said in a
statement.</p>
<p>None of the crew on the merchant ship, the Besiktas-M, were injured
either, according to a defense official who spoke on the condition of
anonymity to provide details that had not yet been made public.</p>
<p>The Truman, which is based in Norfolk, Virginia, deployed in
September to the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It had just
completed a port call in Souda Bay, Greece.</p>

id="zelenskyy-rejects-bilateral-us-russia-pact-to-end-moscows-war-against-ukraine">Zelenskyy
rejects bilateral US-Russia pact to end Moscow’s war against
Ukraine</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Thursday that his
country would not accept any agreement on its fate decided bilaterally
by Russia and the United States on how to end Moscow’s three-year war on
Ukraine without Kyiv’s involvement.</p>
<p>“We, as an independent country, simply will not be able to accept any
agreements without us,” Zelenskyy told reporters as he visited a nuclear
plant on his way to the Munich Security Conference, where he plans to
meet Friday with U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State
Marco Rubio.</p>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump spoke Wednesday with Russian President
Vladimir Putin, and they agreed that negotiations to end the war should
start immediately, with Trump suggesting the two of them might soon hold
a summit in Saudi Arabia. Trump later talked with Zelenskyy and informed
him of his discussions with Putin.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Zelenskyy said, “Today it’s important that everything
does not go according to Putin’s plan, in which he wants to do
everything to make his negotiations bilateral” with the U.S.</p>
<p>Still, on Wednesday, Zelenskyy said after talking with Trump, “We
discussed many nuances, diplomatic, military, economic, and President
Trump informed me of what Putin told him. We believe that America’s
power is enough to, together with us, together with all partners,
pressure Russia and Putin toward peace.”</p>
<p>Zelenskyy said he talked with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk on
Thursday, telling him that “no negotiations with Putin can begin without
a united position from Ukraine, Europe, and the U.S. I emphasized that
Ukraine must negotiate from a position of strength, with strong and
reliable security guarantees, and that NATO membership would be the most
cost-effective for partners.”</p>
<p>“Another key guarantee is serious investment in Ukraine’s defense
industry. I also warned world leaders against trusting Putin’s claims of
readiness to end the war,” Zelenskyy said.</p>
<p>Trump said, in all caps on his Truth Social media platform on
Thursday, “Great talks with Russia and Ukraine yesterday. Good
possibility of ending that horrible, very bloody war!!!”</p>
<p>Trump’s phone call with Putin came after U.S. Defense Secretary Pete
Hegseth told other NATO defense chiefs that Ukraine’s goal of restoring
its 2014 borders was unrealistic and that the U.S. does not foresee
Ukraine joining NATO, the West’s key military alliance, as part of a
negotiated settlement of Russia’s war on Ukraine.</p>
<p>Moscow’s forces now hold about 20% of Ukrainian territory, including
the Crimean Peninsula it unilaterally annexed in 2014.</p>
<p>Zelenskyy said it was important for the United States and Ukraine to
draw up a plan to end the war before talking to the Russian side.
Ukraine has said it is working on a Zelenskyy-Trump meeting, but nothing
firm has been announced.</p>
<p>Zelenskyy said he did not discuss the possibility of NATO membership
during his phone call with Trump, although he said he knew that the
United States was against the idea. NATO’s 32-nation bloc says it is
committed to eventual Ukraine NATO membership but not while the
Russia-Ukraine war rages.</p>
<p>Russian officials and state-backed media appeared triumphant after
Wednesday’s call between Trump and Putin that lasted more than an
hour.</p>
<p>“To us, the position of the current [U.S.] administration is much
more appealing,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Thursday.</p>
<p>Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy chair of Russia’s National Security
Council, said in an online statement, “The presidents of Russia and the
U.S. have talked at last. This is very important in and of itself.”</p>
<p>Trump in the past has declined to say he wants Ukraine to win the war
against Russia. On Wednesday, after talking with Putin and Zelenskyy, he
said, “I’m backing Ukraine, but I do want security for our money,” with
U.S. officials suggesting recently that Ukraine agree to supply the U.S.
with rare earth minerals for manufacture of technology products in
exchange for continued military support.</p>

id="chinese-apps-face-scrutiny-in-us-but-users-keep-scrolling">Chinese
apps face scrutiny in US but users keep scrolling</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Seoul — As a high school junior in the Maryland suburbs of
Washington, Daneel Kutsenko never gave much thought to China.</p>
<p>Last month, though, as the U.S. government prepared to ban TikTok –
citing national security concerns about its Chinese ownership – Kutsenko
downloaded RedNote, another Chinese video-sharing app, which he felt
gave him a new perspective on China.</p>
<p>“It just seems like people who live their life and have fun,”
Kutsenko told VOA of RedNote, which reportedly attracted hundreds of
thousands of U.S. users in the leadup to the now-paused TikTok ban.</p>
<p>Kutsenko’s move is part of a larger trend. Even as U.S. policymakers
grow louder in their warnings about Chinese-owned apps, they have become
a central part of American life.</p>
<p>TikTok, owned by China’s ByteDance, boasts 170 million U.S. users.
China’s AI chatbot DeepSeek surged to the top of Apple’s App Store
rankings, including those in the United States, for several days after
its release last month.</p>
<p>Another major shift has come in online shopping, where Americans are
flocking to digital Chinese marketplaces such as Temu and Shein in
search of ultra-low prices on clothes, home goods, and other items.</p>
<p>According to a 2024 survey by Omnisend, an e-commerce marketing
company, 70% of Americans shopped on Chinese platforms during the past
year, with 20% doing so at least once a week.</p>
<p>Multifaceted threat</p>
<p>U.S. officials warn that Chinese apps pose a broad range of threats –
whether to national security, privacy, human rights, or the economy.</p>
<p>TikTok has been the biggest target. Members of Congress attempting to
ban the app cited concerns that China’s government could use TikTok as
an intelligence-gathering tool or manipulate its algorithms to push
narratives favorable to Beijing.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Chinese commerce apps face scrutiny for their rock-bottom
prices, which raise concerns about ethical sourcing and potential links
to forced labor, Sari Arho Havrén, an associate fellow at the Royal
United Services Institute, a London-based research organization, said in
an email conversation with VOA.</p>
<p>“It raises questions of how sustainably these products are made,”
Havrén, who focuses on China’s foreign policy and great power
competition, said. Moreover, he said, “the pricing simply kills local
manufacturers and businesses.”</p>
<p>Many U.S. policymakers also warn Chinese apps pose greater privacy
risks, since Chinese law requires companies to share data with the
government on request.</p>
<p>‘Curiosity and defiance’</p>
<p>Still, a growing number of Americans appear unfazed. Many young
people in particular seem to shrug off the privacy concerns, arguing
that their personal data is already widely exposed.</p>
<p>“They could get all the data they want. And anyway, I’m 16 – what are
they going to find? Oh my gosh, he goes to school? There’s not much,”
Kutsenko said.</p>
<p>Ivy Yang, an expert on U.S.-China digital interaction, told VOA many
young Americans also find it unlikely that they would ever be caught up
in a Chinese national security investigation.</p>
<p>“What they’re chasing is a dopamine peak. They’re not thinking about
whether or not the dance videos or the cat tax pictures they swipe on
RedNote are going to be a national security threat,” Yang, who founded
the New York-based consulting company Wavelet Strategy, said.</p>
<p>Yang said the TikTok ban backlash and surge in RedNote downloads may
reflect a shift in how young Americans see China – not just as a
geopolitical rival, but as a source of apps they use in daily life.</p>
<p>She also attributes their skepticism to a broader cultural mindset –
one shaped by a mix of curiosity, defiance, and a growing distrust of
institutions, including conventional media.</p>
<p>Jeremy Goldkorn, a longtime analyst of U.S.-China digital trends and
an editorial fellow at the online magazine ChinaFile, said growing
disillusionment with America’s political turmoil and economic
uncertainty has intensified these shifts.</p>
<p>“It makes it much more difficult for, particularly, young people to
get worked up about what China’s doing when they feel so horrified about
their own country,” Goldkorn said during a recent episode of the Sinica
podcast, which focuses on current affairs in China.</p>
<p>Polling reflects this divide. A 2024 Pew survey found 81% of
Americans view China unfavorably, but younger adults are less critical –
only 27% of those under 30 have strongly negative views, compared to 61%
of those 65 and older.</p>
<p>Digital barrier</p>
<p>While Chinese apps are expanding in the United States, in many ways
the digital divide remains as impenetrable as ever.</p>
<p>China blocks nearly all major Western platforms and tightly controls
its own apps, while the U.S. weighs new restrictions on Chinese
tech.</p>
<p>Though President Donald Trump paused the TikTok ban, his
administration has signaled broader efforts to curb China’s tech
influence.</p>
<p>Trump officials have hinted they could take steps to regulate
DeepSeek, the Chinese digital chatbot.</p>
<p>The Trump administration also recently signaled it intends to close a
trade loophole that lets Chinese retailers bypass import duties and
customs checks.</p>
<p>Broader challenges</p>
<p>Even as Washington debates how to handle the rise of Chinese apps,
some analysts say the conversation risks obscuring the deeper issue of
the broader role of social media itself.</p>
<p>Rogier Creemers, a specialist in digital governance at Leiden
University, told VOA that while Chinese apps may raise valid concerns
for Western countries, they are just one part of a larger, unaddressed
problem.</p>
<p>“There’s a whole range of social ills that emerge from these social
media that I think are far more important than anything the Chinese
Communist Party could do,” he said, pointing to issues like digital
addiction, declining attention spans, and the way social media amplifies
misinformation and political unseriousness.</p>
<p>“And that would apply whether these apps are Chinese-owned or
American-owned or Tajikistani-owned, as far as I’m concerned,” he
added.</p>
<p>The United States, Creemer said, has taken a more hands-off approach
to regulating online platforms, in part due to strong free speech
protections and pushback by the tech industry.</p>
<p>Apps or influence?</p>
<p>For millions of Americans, the bigger debates about China and digital
influence barely register when they open TikTok.</p>
<p>Kutsenko said neither he nor his friends have strong opinions about
U.S.-China tensions. They just wanted an alternative to TikTok – one
that felt fun, familiar, and easy to use.</p>
<p>It’s a sign that while policymakers see Chinese apps as part of a
growing tech rivalry, for many Americans they’re just another way to
scroll, shop, and stay entertained, no matter where they come from.</p>

allies seek clarity on Ukraine support at Munich Security
Conference</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LONDON — Hundreds of world leaders and delegates are set to attend
the Munich Security Conference in Germany this weekend, with conflicts
in Ukraine, the Middle East, Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo
high on the agenda, alongside simmering tensions in the Indo-Pacific
region.</p>
<p>It’s the first major global summit for the new administration in
Washington under President Donald Trump and comes amid speculation that
his America First agenda could presage significant changes in U.S.
foreign policy.</p>
<p>US delegation</p>
<p>The U.S. delegation includes Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of
State Marco Rubio.</p>
<p>“We are very happy that we will have a strong representation of both
the administration of the new American government there, as well as
representation from Congress,” said conference chairman Christoph
Heusgen.</p>
<p>“And so, the American point of view will also be presented on stage,
as will the European point of view, and that of other regions. And then,
and that is what Munich stands for, there will be a dialogue, a
discussion about the many issues at hand,” Heusgen told Reuters.</p>
<p>Vance is scheduled to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in
Munich.</p>
<p>Ukraine’s war against Russia’s full-scale invasion is about to enter
its fourth year. Zelenskyy said this week he shared a “common vision”
with the Trump administration.</p>
<p>“Of course, there may be different opinions, but a common vision of
the main things — of how to stop [Russian President Vladimir] Putin and
how to give guarantees of security to Ukraine and Ukrainians,” Zelenskyy
told reporters on Monday.</p>
<p>‘Unrealistic’</p>
<p>However, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Wednesday that
American troops would not be deployed to Ukraine following any ceasefire
deal with Russia and ruled out NATO membership for Kyiv. He also
described Ukraine’s hopes to return to its pre-2014 borders with Russia
as unrealistic.</p>
<p>“European allies must lead from the front,” Hegseth told reporters in
Brussels following a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group.</p>
<p>President Trump has made clear he wants a quick end to the war but
it’s not clear how that might be achieved. Trump announced Wednesday he
and Putin agreed in a phone call to “immediately” begin negotiations
with Ukraine to bring an end to the nearly three-year-conflict.</p>
<p>NATO allies</p>
<p>Nevertheless, U.S. allies sense a change in tone from the president
since his inauguration last month, said Charles Grant, director of the
Center for European Reform, a London-based research group.</p>
<p>“Though Trump has said a lot of things to worry a lot of people on
tariffs, on trade, on Gaza and so on, he hasn’t yet said anything
particularly crazy from a European point of view about Ukraine or NATO.
He hasn’t repeated his threat to pull out of NATO. He said the Europeans
should spend more [on defense] but most of us agree with him on that. He
hasn’t said he’s going to cut off all aid for Ukraine,” Grant told
VOA.</p>
<p>“One of the issues that will come up in Munich is to what extent the
Europeans should help to keep the peace if there is a ceasefire in
Ukraine. And certainly, President [Emmanuel] Macron of France, and to
some degree the British, and possibly Friedrich Merz who may well be the
next German chancellor, are all in favor of sending troops to keep the
peace in Ukraine, if there’s a peace to be kept,” Grant added.</p>
<p>Ukrainian hopes</p>
<p>On the streets of Kyiv, some Ukrainians expressed hope that the
Munich conference will strengthen Ukrainian ties with the Trump
administration.</p>
<p>“We hope that this personal meeting between President Zelenskyy and
Vice President Vance will give an opportunity to convey the real
situation of what is happening today in the Russian-Ukrainian war,”
sociologist Asked Ashurbekov told The Associated Press.</p>
<p>Ukrainian journalist Borden Semeniuk was less optimistic.</p>
<p>“The country has been living in expectation for three years, and
because of this, belief in this expectation has decreased. … I would
like to see some relief from the situation. But it is impossible to live
in the hope that it will 100 percent happen at this meeting,” Semeniuk
told AP.</p>
<p>Russia and Iran have not been invited to Munich. Last year, the
conference organizers said their governments had not shown a serious
interest in negotiations.</p>
<p>China</p>
<p>The official report of the Munich Security Conference cites the
“multipolarization of the international order” — a theme welcomed by
China, which is sending a large delegation to the summit.</p>
<p>“The report shows that the international community’s acceptance of a
multipolar world is on the rise. … China has always called for an equal
and orderly multipolar world and a universally beneficial and inclusive
economic globalization,” Guo Jiakun, a spokesperson for the Chinese
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told reporters in Beijing on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the U.S Navy sailed two warships through the
Taiwan Strait, prompting an angry response from Beijing.</p>
<p>China has ramped up military activity around Taiwan in recent months.
China considers Taiwan a breakaway province that someday will be
reunified with the mainland, while Taipei considers the island a
sovereign state.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Rubio is due to hold a trilateral meeting with
allies Japan and South Korea while in Munich.</p>
<p>Gaza</p>
<p>Conflict in the Middle East will also top the agenda at the Munich
conference, amid fears that the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is at
risk.</p>
<p>President Trump’s repeated suggestion that Palestinians should leave
Gaza will overshadow the conference, said analyst Charles Grant.</p>
<p>“I don’t see it happening because you can’t just eliminate 2 million
people and put them nowhere at all,” Grant said.</p>
<p>“But I think most European governments are hoping that Trump will
just push this for a while, and he’ll get bored of it and talk about
something else – and hope he will kind of move on and forget it. But so
long as he does talk about it, it’s very disruptive and creates a lot of
ill-feeling between European and many other governments, and the U.S.,”
Grant told VOA.</p>
<p>The conference will also host sessions on the conflicts in Sudan and
the Democratic Republic of Congo. Climate change, energy security and
artificial intelligence also feature on a packed agenda across the
three-day conference.</p>

Trump to meet with focus on trade, immigration, strategic ties</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW DELHI — U.S. President Donald Trump welcomes Indian Prime
Minister Narendra Modi for talks Thursday at the White House.</p>
<p>Officials in New Delhi expressed optimism Modi’s visit will herald a
renewed and substantive partnership. However, analysts said there will
be contentious issues to navigate on trade and immigration, which are
among Trump’s top priorities. </p>
<p>Underlining that Modi will be meeting Trump within weeks of his
taking office, Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri – the ministry’s
top civil servant — said India-U.S. ties are solid and that “this has
been one of our strongest international partnerships.” </p>
<p>Trade is important for both countries and India has taken steps to
demonstrate that it is ready to address concerns of Trump, who has named
India among countries that are “very big tariff abusers.” In a phone
conversation with Modi last month, Trump called for moving toward a fair
bilateral trading relationship. </p>
<p>Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council,
repeated such concerns on Monday. “India has enormously high” tariffs
that lock out imports, he said in an interview with CNBC. </p>
<p>New Delhi, which wants to avoid trade tensions with the U.S.,
announced earlier this month that it would lower import duties on some
items that will benefit American exports such as high-end motorcycles
and cars. </p>
<p>It also may offer other concessions that could help American goods
gain Indian market access and boost energy imports from the U.S.,
analysts say. </p>
<p>“New Delhi thought it would take a first step and try to resolve
differences on trade. But, certainly, as a great negotiator and
bargainer, he [Trump] will ask for more,” said Chintamani Mahapatra,
founder of the Kalinga School of Indo Pacific Studies. “India also
bargains very well. So, somehow, we will try to make a compromise that
will benefit both.” </p>
<p>For India, the stakes are high – the United States is its largest
trading partner. Bilateral trade between the two countries was $118
billion, with an Indian surplus of about $32 billion in 2023. </p>
<p>India has not been affected so far by Trump’s tariff impositions –
the latest 25% tariffs he imposed on steel and aluminum imports will
have an only marginal affect on India, as New Delhi is a small exporter
of steel to the U.S., according to Indian officials. </p>
<p>Strengthening security and defense ties with the U.S., Indian
officials say will also be discussed in Washington. According to
analysts that could include potential purchases of weapon systems and
technology.  In the recent phone conversation with Modi, Trump had
called on Modi to increase procurement of U.S.-made security
equipment </p>
<p>India, the world’s largest spender on military equipment, needs a
range of weapons systems to modernize its military. As it diversifies
its purchases from its traditional weapons supplier, Russia, India has
been purchasing more arms from countries such as France, Israel and the
United States.  </p>
<p>“The U.S. is a little concerned that it is losing out on the India
[security] buys, so it has stepped up pressure to sell India a lot more
defense equipment than India has bought in the last few years,”
according to Rahul Bedi, a defense analyst in New Delhi. “There is
likely to be initiatives on transport aircraft, surveillance aircraft
for the navy, and possibly even fighter aircraft, as well as a lot of
technology transfers for aircraft engines, infantry combat
vehicles.”   </p>
<p>Immigration is another issue of concern to both countries. Although
India has cooperated with the U.S. and said it is ready to take back
undocumented migrants, reports of 104 undocumented Indians being
shackled for 40 hours while being brought back to India on a military
plane last week from the U.S. led to an uproar and protests by
opposition parties.   </p>
<p>Indian officials have said that New Delhi will call for better
treatment during future deportations. </p>
<p>At the same time, India’s top priority during discussions will be to
protect legal channels of immigration for skilled Indian workers and
students heading to American universities. Indians are the largest
beneficiaries of H1B visas, which allow U.S. employers to hire foreign
professionals in specialized fields, such as technology.   </p>
<p>“People-to-people relationships constitute the bedrock of our
deepening ties with the United States,” Indian foreign minister,
Subrahmanyam Jaishankar told lawmakers, while responding to concerns
about the transport and treatment of the deportees. </p>
<p>In a statement before leaving New Delhi, Modi called his upcoming
meeting with Trump an opportunity to build upon the successes of their
collaboration in Trump’s first term.  </p>
<p>Mutual concerns about an assertive China are likely to keep the two
countries aligned, according to analysts. Along with the U.S., Australia
and Japan, India is a partner in the Quad, a strategic security grouping
focused on the Indo-Pacific. Analysts say the two countries have
convergence on geostrategic issues. </p>
<p>“It was President Trump in his first term, who dusted off the Quad,
which was in a dormant state for about 10 years, and he was solely
responsible for reviving it,” said Mahapatra. “This is an area where
both the countries have a lot of things in common for maintaining peace,
stability and contributing to the growth story in the Indo-Pacific
region.”</p>

<h2
id="us-judge-allows-trump-to-proceed-with-federal-worker-deferred-retirement">US
judge allows Trump to proceed with federal worker deferred
retirement</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS — A federal judge on Wednesday allowed
President Donald Trump’s administration to carry out its federal worker
deferred retirement program as the president moves to overhaul and
downsize the U.S. government, handing a setback to unions trying to stop
the plan.</p>
<p>The decision could clear the way for the Republican president’s
administration to swiftly try to wrap up the program, though the unions
could ask another court to halt the program.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge George O’Toole in Boston dissolved an earlier
order he issued that had paused the program at the urging of unions
representing more than 800,000 federal employees.</p>
<p>O’Toole concluded that the unions lacked legal standing to challenge
the rule.</p>
<p>The American Federation of Government Employees and other unions have
called the administration’s deferred resignation offer to more than 2
million federal civilian employees unlawful.</p>
<p>“The unions do not have the required direct stake in the Fork
directive, but are challenging a policy that affects others,
specifically executive branch employees,” wrote O’Toole, an appointee of
Democratic former President Bill Clinton. “This is not sufficient.”</p>
<p>The Office of Personnel Management, which announced the program in a
January 28 email titled “Fork in the Road,” on Monday told employees it
intends to close the program to new entrants as soon as legally
permissible.</p>
<p>As of Friday, about 65,000 federal employees had signed up for the
buyouts, according to a White House official, as the Trump
administration ramps up plans to engage in wide-ranging job cuts
throughout the government.</p>
<p>The White House did not immediately respond to a request for
comment.</p>
<p>American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) National President
Everett Kelley called the ruling a setback.</p>
<p>“Importantly, this decision did not address the underlying lawfulness
of the program,” he said in a statement.</p>
<p>The unions that had filed the lawsuit argued that the plan announced
in January was unlawful and that OPM lacked authority to implement the
program.</p>
<p>Trump, who began his second term as president on January 20, has
appointed Elon Musk a “special government employee” to oversee a
sweeping effort called the Department of Government Efficiency with the
stated aim of reducing federal spending and reshaping the United States’
2.2 million-strong federal workforce, potentially purging thousands of
workers.</p>
<p>He also signed an executive order on Tuesday to expand Musk’s
influence and continue downsizing the federal workforce.</p>
<p>Democrats and other critics have accused Musk, who heads electric
carmaker Tesla and rocket company SpaceX, of improperly taking over the
federal government. Some federal workers have held protests against
Musk’s actions.</p>
<p>In an email that was sent last month to nearly all federal employees,
OPM said employees could choose to resign now and retain all pay and
benefits until September 30.</p>
<p>The email said employees could remain on the payroll without having
to work in person and possibly having their duties reduced or eliminated
in the meantime. Interested employees needed only to reply with the word
“resign” to take part.</p>
<p>The email’s title and contents mirrored a message that Musk, the
world’s richest man, sent to Twitter employees after he acquired the
social media platform, now called X, in 2022.</p>
<p>As the deadline approached, the Trump administration had repeated its
warning that most federal agencies are likely to be downsized, a message
seen by workers as pressure to accept the buyout offer.</p>
<p>The unions in their lawsuit argued that OPM’s buyout directive was
“stunningly arbitrary” and violated the Antideficiency Act, a federal
law that bars agencies from spending more money than Congress
appropriated.</p>
<p>By encouraging employees to broadly quit without regard to their
agency, job duties or institutional memory, OPM is ignoring the adverse
consequences resignations could have on the government’s ability to
function, the unions said.</p>
<p>At the request of the unions, O’Toole last week delayed an initial
February 6 deadline for employees to resign to Monday. On that day, he
put it on hold pending a further order of the court while he considered
the case.</p>
<p>The unions asked that the deadline be put fully on hold to give them
time to seek further relief through the courts and ensure that their
members can make informed decisions.</p>

disconnect on the way the government measures the economy — sending
economic circles abuzz! We’ll explain what the tizzy is all about. Plus,
is the Senate confirmation process for federal officials still useful?

orders revamp of US diplomatic corps to ensure it follows his
agenda</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday issued an
executive order directing Secretary of State Marco Rubio to revamp the
Foreign Service to ensure “faithful and effective implementation” of
Trump’s foreign policy agenda. </p>
<p>The order, which follows upheaval at the U.S. Agency for
International Development, comes as Trump institutes changes to ensure
U.S. foreign policy is aligned with his “America First” agenda. He has
also repeatedly pledged to “clean out the deep state” by firing
bureaucrats that he deems disloyal. </p>
<p>The order also says failure to implement the president’s agenda is
grounds for professional discipline, which may result in the termination
of personnel. </p>
<p>“The Secretary must maintain an exceptional workforce of patriots to
implement this policy effectively,” the order read. </p>
<p>“The Secretary shall, consistent with applicable law, reform the
Foreign Service and the administration of foreign relations to ensure
faithful and effective implementation of the President’s foreign policy
agenda.” </p>
<p>The executive order says the secretary of state will implement
reforms in recruiting, performance, evaluation and retention standards
to “ensure a workforce that is committed to faithful implementation of
the President’s foreign policy.” </p>
<p>It also said the secretary can revamp the programs of the Foreign
Service Institute and revise or replace the Foreign Affairs Manual. </p>
<p>Just hours after taking office on Jan. 20, Trump ordered a freeze of
most U.S. foreign aid to ensure it was aligned with his “America First”
policies. </p>
<p>Following the order, USAID staff were put on leave and told not to
report to work at the agency’s headquarters, where signs were covered in
tape or removed. The USAID website stopped working, and Rubio was named
acting administrator.</p>

id="lawsuit-by-us-rights-group-seeks-access-to-migrants-sent-to-guantanamo-bay">Lawsuit
by US rights group seeks access to migrants sent to Guantanamo Bay</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit on
Wednesday seeking access to dozens of migrants flown to a U.S. naval
base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, saying they were being denied the right to
an attorney. </p>
<p>ACLU filed the complaint on behalf of families of detainees, who say
the detainees themselves cannot sue because they are being held without
the ability to communicate with the outside world. The suit seeks
immediate phone and video access to detainees, as well as in-person
visitation. </p>
<p>President Donald Trump, a Republican, kicked off a wide-ranging
immigration crackdown after taking office on Jan. 20, including the
transfer of dozens of migrants to a detention site on Guantanamo Bay,
which is best known for the separate high-security U.S. prison used for
suspected foreign terrorists. </p>
<p>The lawsuit follows a letter sent by ACLU and other civil and
immigrant rights groups to top Trump officials last week, demanding a
way to speak to detainees. </p>
<p>“Shipping immigrants off to Guantanamo without access to lawyers or
the outside world cannot be reconciled with our country’s laws or
principles,” said Lee Gelernt, ACLU lawyer and lead counsel on the case.
“It will now be up to the courts to reaffirm that the rule of law
governs our nation.” </p>
<p>The lawsuit cites the cases of three Venezuelan men believed to be
detained at Guantanamo. </p>
<p>Angela Carolina Sequera, one of the plaintiffs, said she was in
almost daily contact with her son while he was in a Texas immigration
detention center and last spoke to him on Saturday, the complaint
stated. On Sunday, she received a call from the detention center saying
her son would be sent to Guantanamo. </p>
<p>“Ms. Sequera has made numerous calls to try to locate her son and
speak to him, to no avail,” the complaint said. “She is distraught over
the lack of information, and she desires that her son be provided with
the ability to communicate with legal counsel regarding his detention at
Guantanamo.” </p>
<p>The plaintiffs also include four nonprofit legal service providers
who said they were unable to represent migrants shuttled to the naval
base. The providers have clients in Texas and Florida.</p>
<p>The Trump administration has provided few specifics about the
detainees sent to Guantanamo Bay but said the first flight carried
alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.  </p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said
there is a system at the Guantanamo detention site for migrants to phone
lawyers. She questioned the ACLU raising concerns about “highly
dangerous criminal aliens including murderers and vicious gang members”
rather than U.S. citizens.  </p>
<p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who visited the base on
Friday, said in a social media post that some of the detainees had
allegedly been charged or convicted of homicide, robbery and other
crimes.  </p>
<p>The ACLU lawsuit said the U.S. had never before moved migrants held
on civil immigration charges from the U.S. to the Guantanamo Bay base
and now held them “incommunicado, without access to attorneys, family or
the outside world.” </p>
<p>The complaint said that despite significant public concern, the Trump
administration had offered no explanation of its legal authority to move
the detainees.</p>

id="trump-pushes-for-lower-interest-rates-alongside-reciprocal-tariffs">Trump
pushes for lower interest rates alongside reciprocal tariffs</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — As his trade advisers finalized plans to enact
reciprocal measures on every country that charges duties on U.S.
imports, President Donald Trump announced Wednesday he will push for
lower interest rates alongside his tariff policies.</p>
<p>“Interest Rates should be lowered, something which would go hand in
hand with upcoming Tariffs!!! Lets Rock and Roll, America!!!” Trump said
on social media Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>To maintain the Federal Reserves’ autonomy from politics, U.S.
presidents traditionally avoid even the appearance of meddling in
monetary policy and the nation’s interest rates, which is the purview of
the central bank.</p>
<p>Trump, however, has not shied from the practice. In a videoconference
address to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in January,
Trump said he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”</p>
<p>“I know interest rates much better than they do,” he said of Fed
officials. He has ramped up his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair
Jerome Powell, whom he appointed in 2017 for a term that ends in
2026.</p>
<p>Trump’s push to lower interest rates is intended to go hand in hand
with punitive measures on trading partners.</p>
<p>The president said Wednesday afternoon that he would approve
reciprocal tariffs on Wednesday or Thursday.</p>
<p>“We’re going to be doing reciprocal tariffs,” he said. “Very simply,
if they charge us, we charge them.”</p>
<p>Reciprocal tariffs are “absolutely a high priority for the
president,” White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett told reporters
Wednesday, promising “a lot more action on it today.”</p>
<p>Hassett said the White House has begun negotiations with other
countries early to lay the groundwork for imposing such tariffs,
although he acknowledged the details about which sectors or how they
will be implemented is a “work in progress.”</p>
<p>Under World Trade Organization rules, member countries have the right
to impose tariffs on imports. Countries negotiate those rates at the WTO
to determine the maximum tariff rate a member country can impose on
imports from other member countries.</p>
<p>Inflation, looming trade war</p>
<p>U.S. inflation rose to 3% in January, according to government data
released Wednesday. Last month, the annual pace was 2.9%.</p>
<p>Trump campaigned on lowering high consumer prices he blamed on his
predecessor, Joe Biden. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt
again attributed the increase to the previous administration.</p>
<p>“This is an indictment on the Biden administration’s mismanagement of
the inflation crisis and their lack of transparency,” she said during
her briefing Wednesday.</p>
<p>Trump wants to lower interest rates and inflation, she said. “He
believes that the whole of government economic approach that this
administration is taking will result in lower inflation.”</p>
<p>However, some economists warn that combining high tariffs and low
interest rates will have the opposite effect.</p>
<p>Trump’s plan reflects a “misunderstanding of how the economy works,”
said Joseph Gagnon, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for
International Economics.</p>
<p>“Tariffs raise prices directly, that is inflationary, but also
cutting interest rates is inflationary if you do it excessively,” he
told VOA. “Especially with today’s data, cutting interest rates would
not be a good idea.”</p>
<p>During testimony Tuesday before the Senate Banking Committee, Powell
said the Fed was in no rush to cut interest rates because the economy
had stabilized. He noted that inflation, while still above the Fed’s 2%
target, was at 2.6% last year, and he said the labor market was cooling
without plummeting, with the unemployment rate at 4%.</p>
<p>Gagnon also warned of a looming trade war. Trump already had
announced Monday his decision to impose 25% tariffs on all steel and
aluminum imports beginning March 12.</p>
<p>The duties will hit top U.S. steel supplier Canada, followed by
Brazil, Mexico, South Korea and Germany. Additionally, Canada is the
leader in aluminum exports to the American market.</p>
<p>European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen vowed on Tuesday the move
“will not go unanswered,” saying it will trigger tough countermeasures
from the 27-nation bloc, potentially targeting iconic American
industries such as bourbon, jeans and motorcycles. EU trade ministers
are meeting Wednesday to determine their next moves.</p>
<p>China, Mexico and Canada</p>
<p>Last week, Trump imposed an additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods,
which the White House said was aimed at halting the flow of fentanyl
opioids and their precursor chemicals.</p>
<p>On Monday China began slapping retaliatory actions on some American
goods, including 15% duties on coal and natural gas imports and 10% on
petroleum, agricultural equipment, high-emission vehicles and pickup
trucks. The country also immediately implemented restrictions on the
export of certain critical minerals, and it launched an antitrust
investigation into American tech giant Google.</p>
<p>Trump delayed enacting a 25% tariff on goods from Mexico and Canada
for a month — until March 4 — to allow negotiations over his demands for
the U.S. neighbors to secure their borders and stop the flow of the
illegal drug fentanyl.</p>
<p>The duties could affect about $1.323 trillion in trade imports that
come from China, Mexico and Canada, according to U.S. government data.
This accounts for 43% of U.S. imports and 5% of the $27 trillion U.S.
gross domestic product.</p>
<p>If enacted, the new import taxes on Canada, Mexico and China will
increase the average tariff rate from its current level of 3% to 10.7%
based on contemporary trade patterns, said Joseph Brusuelas, chief
economist at financial advisory firm RSM.</p>
<p>“Should the trade skirmishes escalate to include the European Union
and turn into an all-out trade war, expect U.S. economic growth to ease
back to 2% as the tariffs drag down growth and employment, stoke
inflation and widen the current account deficit, all amid higher
interest rates,” he wrote on RSM’s Real Economy Blog.</p>

id="federal-appeals-court-upholds-singer-r.-kellys-convictions-30-year-prison-term">Federal
appeals court upholds singer R. Kelly’s convictions, 30-year prison
term</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — R. Kelly’s racketeering and sex trafficking convictions,
along with a 30-year prison sentence, were upheld Wednesday by a federal
appeals court that concluded the American singer exploited his fame for
over a quarter century to sexually abuse girls and young women. </p>
<p>The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan ruled Wednesday
after hearing arguments last March. </p>
<p>The Grammy-winning, multiplatinum-selling R&amp;B songwriter was
convicted in 2021 in Brooklyn federal court of multiple charges,
including racketeering and sex trafficking. </p>
<p>Attorney Jennifer Bonjean, representing R. Kelly, said in a statement
that she believed the Supreme Court will agree to hear an appeal. She
called the 2nd Circuit ruling “unprecedented,” saying it gives
prosecutors limitless discretion to apply the racketeering law “to
situations absurdly remote” from the statute’s intent. </p>
<p>Last year, the high court declined to hear an appeal of a 20-year
sentence Kelly received after he was convicted in 2022 of child sex
charges including charges of producing images of child sexual abuse in
Chicago. </p>
<p>The 2nd Circuit rejected Kelly’s arguments that the trial evidence
was inadequate, the constitutionality of some state laws used against
him were questionable, four jurors were biased, the trial judge made
some improper rulings, and a racketeering charge more commonly used in
organized crime cases was improper. </p>
<p>“Enabled by a constellation of managers, assistants, and other staff
for over twenty-five years, Kelly exploited his fame to lure girls and
young women into his grasp,” the appeals court said, noting members of
his entourage helped introduce him to underage girls. </p>
<p>“Evidence at trial showed that he would isolate them from friends and
family, control nearly every aspect of their lives, and abuse them
verbally, physically, and sexually,” the three-judge panel said. </p>
<p>The appeals court said it was “neither arbitrary nor irrational” that
several accusers were permitted to testify at trial that Kelly gave them
herpes without disclosing he had an STD, and it was not unduly
prejudicial or cumulative that seven witnesses who were not yet adults
when Kelly began to abuse them were allowed to testify. </p>
<p>“None of the testimony was more inflammatory than the charged acts,”
the appeals court said. </p>
<p>The 2nd Circuit also said it was not unfairly prejudicial for the
trial judge to let jurors view graphic videos. The videos, the appeals
court said, “were properly admitted to show the means and methods of the
enterprise, including the level of control and dominance Kelly had over
his victims.” </p>
<p>Bonjean, in her statement on R. Kelly’s behalf, also cited a partial
dissent in which one 2nd Circuit judge, Richard J. Sullivan, concurred
with what he described as the majority’s “excellent opinion,” but
dissented in part over a restitution award given one victim for a
lifetime supply of a suppressive regime of herpes medication. The award
was based on the cost of the brand-name drug when a generic drug is
available. </p>
<p>“This was not restitution. This was an effort by the government to
unfairly enrich government witnesses for their testimony,” Bonjean
said. </p>
<p>Kelly, born Robert Sylvester Kelly, is known for work including the
1996 hit I Believe I Can Fly and the cult classic Trapped in the Closet,
a multipart tale of sexual betrayal and intrigue. </p>
<p>Kelly sold millions of albums and remained in demand even after
allegations about his abuse of young girls began circulating publicly in
the 1990s. He was acquitted of child sexual abuse image charges in
Chicago in 2008, but a second trial in Chicago in 2022 ended with his
conviction on charges of producing images of child sexual abuse and
enticing girls for sex. </p>
<p>Widespread outrage over Kelly’s sexual misconduct did not emerge
until the #MeToo reckoning, reaching a crescendo after the release of
the documentary Surviving R. Kelly.</p>

<h2 id="trump-launches-diplomatic-blitz-to-end-war-in-ukraine">Trump
launches diplomatic blitz to end war in Ukraine</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday set in motion a diplomatic
charge aimed at ending the nearly 3-year-old war in Ukraine and laid
down what appears to be his condition for continued U.S. support.</p>
<p>“I’m backing Ukraine, but I do want security for our money,” he said
in the Oval Office, when asked by reporters about his stance on the
conflict sparked by the 2022 Russian invasion.</p>
<p>Trump said he told former President Joe Biden on Biden’s support for
Kyiv, “‘You ought to be asking for a loan or a security, like their oil
and gas or something, for the money.’”</p>
<p>U.S. lawmakers have approved nearly $183 billion in military and
non-military support for Ukraine since 2022, according to an oversight
report delivered to Congress on Wednesday, which also said that just
under $40 billion remains available.</p>
<p>This followed a whirlwind day of developments between Washington and
Moscow.</p>
<p>President welcomes teacher home</p>
<p>The events kicked off Tuesday night, when the president welcomed
American teacher Marc Fogel into the White House after his release from
Russian custody.</p>
<p>Before noon Wednesday, Trump announced that he and Russian President
Vladimir Putin had agreed, by phone, to “immediately” begin negotiations
with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to bring an end to the
conflict.</p>
<p>Around midday, Trump dispatched Vice President JD Vance and Secretary
of State Marco Rubio to a Friday meeting in Munich with Zelenskyy.</p>
<p>And then, speaking to reporters in the Oval Office as the skies
turned gray over snowy Washington, he teased to a future summit with
Putin in Saudi Arabia “in the not-too-distant future.”</p>
<p>Zelenskyy conversation went ‘very well’</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, Trump said in a social media statement read aloud
by press secretary Karoline Leavitt that the conversation with Zelenskyy
went “very well.”</p>
<p>Likewise, of the meeting in Munich, he said, “I am hopeful that the
results of that meeting will be positive.”</p>
<p>Zelenskyy confirmed that the two men spoke Wednesday. In a video
released by the Ukrainian presidency, he described their conversation as
long.</p>
<p>“We discussed many nuances, diplomatic, military, economic, and
President Trump informed me of what Putin told him,” he said. “We
believe that America’s power is enough to, together with us, together
with all partners, pressure Russia and Putin toward peace.”</p>
<p>Earlier Wednesday, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, in Germany for
a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, ruled out a key demand
by Ukraine: eventual membership in NATO.</p>
<p>“The United States does not believe that NATO membership for Ukraine
is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement,” Hegseth said.</p>
<p>When asked about Hegseth’s statement, Trump said NATO membership for
Ukraine was “not practical.”</p>
<p>‘Great friendship’</p>
<p>A top Trump envoy on Wednesday credited Trump’s “great friendship”
with Putin and with Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as
key in freeing Fogel from Russian custody late Tuesday. Fogel had been
detained since August 2021 for bringing medically prescribed marijuana
into the country.</p>
<p>“I think that getting Marc Fogel out was critical, and the Russians
were very, very helpful in that effort and very accommodating,” said
Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy to the Mideast, speaking to
reporters at the White House. “And I think that’s maybe a sign about how
that working relationship between President Trump and President Putin
will be in the future and what that may portend for the world at large
for conflict and so forth.”</p>
<p>“I feel like the luckiest man on Earth right now,” Fogel said as he
stood next to Trump at the White House late Tuesday.</p>
<p>Trump said he appreciated what Russia did in letting Fogel go home
but declined to specify the details of any agreement with Russia beyond
calling it “very fair, very reasonable.”</p>
<p>The White House on Wednesday said the U.S. would, in turn, release
Russian cryptocurrency kingpin Alexander Vinnik.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Russian spokesman Dmitry Peskov directly linked Fogel’s
exchange to the larger picture.</p>
<p>“In Washington, Fogel’s return is considered an important step in the
Ukrainian crisis,” he said.</p>
<p>And he said such negotiations between Washington and Moscow build
mutual trust, which he said “is now at its lowest point.”</p>
<p>The White House also announced the release of three prisoners held by
Kremlin ally Belarus. Among them, Andrey Kuznechyk, a veteran journalist
with U.S.-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty’s Belarus service.</p>
<p>“This is a joyous day for Andrey, his wife, and their two young
children. After more than three years apart, this family is together
again thanks to President Trump,” RFE/RL President Stephen Capus said in
a statement.</p>
<p>Capus added, “We remain hopeful that our journalist Ihar Losik will
also be released and look to the Trump administration for its continued
leadership and guidance.”</p>

lawmakers confirming Tulsi Gabbard as the nation’s next director of

<p>The Senate voted 52-48 in favor of Gabbard on Wednesday, narrowly
rejecting concerns about her experience and past statements on leaks of
classified intelligence and other matters.</p>
<p>Following the vote, Gabbard told Trump she would “help fulfill that
mandate that the American people delivered to you very clearly in this
election.”</p>
<p>“The American people have very little trust in the intelligence
community, largely because they’ve seen the weaponization and
politicization of an entity that is supposed to be purely focused on
ensuring our national security,” she said moments after being sworn in
during a ceremony at the White House’s Oval Office.</p>
<p>“It is truly humbling to be in this position to serve in your
administration, help to rebuild that trust and ultimately to keep the
American people safe,” Gabbard said, praising the president for
“ensuring that war is the last resort, not the first.”</p>
<p>Gabbard got support from every Republican senator except for former
Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who joined Democrats in opposing her
confirmation.</p>
<p>Last-minute pleas by Senate Democrats to their Republican colleagues
to reject Gabbard’s nomination, however, had no impact.</p>
<p>“We simply cannot, in good conscience, trust our most classified
secrets to someone who echoes Russian propaganda and falls for
conspiracy theories,” said Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, addressing
lawmakers before Wednesday’s vote.</p>
<p>Schumer also alleged that most Republicans secretly agree.</p>
<p>“If we had a secret ballot, Gabbard might get 10 votes,” he said.
“People know. That’s why they raise so many questions. But Donald Trump
and Elon Musk evidently threaten them, and they’re changing their
view.”</p>
<p>Trump selected Gabbard in November, praising her “fearless
spirit.”</p>
<p>But the former Democratic representative from the state of Hawaii and
one-time Democratic presidential candidate faced criticism from
Democrats and some Republicans. Gabbard’s nomination to serve as
director of national intelligence advanced to the full Senate by a 9-8
party-line vote in the Senate Intelligence Committee.</p>
<p>“It’s fair to say Ms. Gabbard’s nomination has generated a bit more
interest and attention than do most nominees before this committee,”
Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Tom Cotton, a Republican,
acknowledged during Gabbard’s confirmation hearing late last month.</p>
<p>During the hearing, Gabbard was questioned repeatedly by Republicans
and Democrats about Edward Snowden, a former National Security Agency
contractor accused of leaking thousands of classified documents before
ultimately fleeing to Russia, and specifically about legislation she
introduced to pardon him.</p>
<p>Each time they asked whether she considered Snowden a traitor,
Gabbard declined to answer.</p>
<p>“Senator, my heart is with my commitment to our Constitution and our
nation’s security,” Gabbard said during once exchange with Republican
Senator James Lankford.</p>
<p>Senators also questioned Gabbard about a 2017 trip to Syria, during
which she met with then-Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, despite
allegations he had used chemical weapons against civilians, and about
her comments about Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>“I continue to have significant concerns about your judgment and your
qualifications,” said Warner, a Democrat. “Repeatedly, you have excused
our adversaries’ worst actions, [and] instead often blame them on the
United States.”</p>
<p>Gabbard, however, managed to find common ground with the committee’s
Republican senators, winning over Susan Collins and Todd Young.</p>
<p>Young also shared a letter from Gabbard in which she pledged to hold
U.S. intelligence employees and contractors accountable for intelligence
leaks and to “not advocate for any protections which should only be
extended to lawful and legitimate whistleblowers.”</p>
<p>Gabbard further promised to not make any recommendation “regarding
the legal standing of Edward Snowden” to the U.S. attorney general or to
Trump.</p>
<p>And she pledged to support the use of warrantless surveillance
capabilities despite her opposition to the program while she was a
lawmaker.</p>

<h2 id="us-defense-chief-return-to-ukraines-2014-borders-unrealistic">US
defense chief: Return to Ukraine’s 2014 borders ‘unrealistic’</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told NATO military allies on
Wednesday that Ukraine’s hoped-for return to its 2014 borders is an
“unrealistic objective,” and that the United States does not believe
that Kyiv membership in NATO is a “realistic outcome” of a negotiated
end to Russia’s three-year war on Ukraine.</p>
<p>Speaking in Brussels at NATO headquarters, Hegseth told his fellow
defense chiefs, “We want, like you, a sovereign and prosperous Ukraine.
But we must start by recognizing that returning to Ukraine’s pre-2014
borders is an unrealistic objective. Chasing this illusionary goal will
only prolong the war and cause more suffering.”</p>
<p>No peace talks have been scheduled, but Hegseth said any durable
conclusion to the war must include “robust security guarantees to ensure
that the war will not begin again.”</p>
<p>“The United States does not believe that NATO membership for Ukraine
is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement,” he said, which would
invoke the military alliance’s mutual defense provision among NATO’s 32
member nations that requires each of them to help defend each other when
they are attacked.  </p>
<p>Kyiv has long sought NATO membership, and the alliance’s other member
nations have said they are committed to it, but not while the war rages
on.  </p>
<p>Instead, Hegseth said security guarantees for Ukraine should be
backed by “capable European and non-European troops.”</p>
<p>“If these troops are deployed as peacekeepers to Ukraine at any
point, they should be deployed as part of a non-NATO mission, and they
should not be covered under Article 5,” he said, referring to the
alliance’s mutual defense clause.</p>
<p>Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014, supported
pro-Russian separatists fighting against Kyiv’s forces in eastern
Ukraine in the ensuing years and then launched a full-scale invasion in
February 2022. It now controls about 20% of Ukraine’s pre-2014
territory.</p>
<p>Before taking office to begin his second term in the White House,
U.S. President Donald Trump said he would resolve the Russia-Ukraine
conflict even before being inaugurated. More recently, his aides say he
hopes for a peace pact in the first 100 days of his new term, roughly by
the end of April.</p>
<p>Under former President Joe Biden, the U.S. was Ukraine’s biggest
military benefactor. Trump has often voiced skepticism of continued U.S.
support, refusing to say at a political debate last year that he wanted
Ukraine to win the war.</p>
<p>Now Trump appears intent on getting Europe to assume most of the
financial and military responsibilities for the defense of Ukraine. He
also has suggested that going forward, Ukraine should pay for continued
U.S. support by giving the United States access to its rare earth
minerals needed to produce technology products.</p>
<p>“Members of this [Ukraine] contact group must meet the moment,”
Hegseth said to the assembled group of about 50 member countries that
have provided $126 billion worth of weapons and military assistance to
Ukraine since Russia’s 2022 invasion.</p>
<p>“We hear you,” British Defense Secretary John Healey said in response
to Hegseth’s opening remarks.  </p>
<p>Hegseth said that NATO members must increase their defense spending
to 5% of their national economies, a figure that no NATO country
currently allocates.</p>
<p>The U.S. is at 3.4%, with Poland the highest NATO country at 4.12%.
The current NATO defense spending goal is 2% of each country’s national
economy, a figure that 23 of the 32 countries meet, up from six in 2021
after Trump chided other NATO countries about the issue during his first
presidential term.</p>
<p>Hegseth would not commit the U.S. to the 5% figure, saying it was up
to Trump.</p>
<p>“We live in fiscally constrained times,” Hegseth said, and need to be
responsible with taxpayer money.</p>
<p>But the U.S. defense leader said, “The United States will no longer
tolerate an imbalanced relationship [among NATO members] which
encourages dependence [on the U.S.]; rather our relationship will
prioritize empowering Europe to own responsibility for its own
security.”</p>
<p>NATO leaders are expected to agree on new spending targets at their
next planned summit, in The Hague, Netherlands, June 24-26.   </p>

Reuters.</p>

heads to Munich amid diplomatic push for Ukraine peace deal</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>STATE DEPARTMENT — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is set to
depart Thursday for Munich and later this week will visit the Middle
East amid an intensive diplomatic push to end Russia’s aggression in
Ukraine, as well as efforts to follow up on U.S. President Donald
Trump’s plan for the post-war Gaza Strip. </p>
<p>Preparations are also underway for Rubio to hold talks with his
counterparts from Japan and South Korea on the sidelines of the Munich
Security Conference, according to people familiar with the plan who
spoke with VOA on condition of anonymity. </p>
<p>If the meeting takes place as expected, it would be the first
U.S.-Japan-South Korea foreign ministerial trilateral under the Trump
administration. </p>
<p>Ukraine </p>
<p>As Russia’s invasion of Ukraine approaches its third year, the U.S.
is pursuing multiple diplomatic avenues to secure a peace deal. </p>
<p>Although not directly linked to efforts to secure a peace deal, U.S.
officials have described Russia’s Tuesday release of American
schoolteacher Marc Fogel as “a show of good faith from the Russians” and
“a sign that we are moving in the right direction to end” the brutal war
in Ukraine. </p>
<p>Rubio has said that the U.S. will reaffirm its determination to end
the war during meetings at the Munich Security Conference, a
high-profile international security forum running from Feb. 14 to
16.   </p>
<p>U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr
Zelenskyy are set to hold in-person talks in Munich. U.S. Special Envoy
for Ukraine and Russia Keith Kellogg and Zelenskyy’s chief of staff,
Andriy Yermak, will also attend the conference. </p>
<p>Ukraine has said that its delegation will present its position on
ending the war and outline its vision for achieving a lasting peace.
Meanwhile, negotiations are in progress as Ukraine seeks security
guarantees from the U.S. and Europe. </p>
<p>Ukraine is willing to offer U.S. companies lucrative reconstruction
contracts, Zelenskyy told The Guardian newspaper in an interview this
week. He also said that if Trump manages to bring him and Russian
President Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table, he would offer a land
swap: Ukrainian-occupied territory in Kursk in exchange for Russian-held
land in Ukraine. </p>
<p>Rare earth minerals </p>
<p>Trump has expressed interest in making continued military aid
conditional on access to Ukraine’s raw materials. </p>
<p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent visited Kyiv on Wednesday for talks
on energy and rare earth minerals. He is the first cabinet-level
official in the Trump administration to visit the country. </p>
<p>More than four dozen minerals, including several types of rare
earths, nickel and lithium, are considered critical to the U.S. economy
and national defense. Ukraine has large deposits of uranium, lithium and
titanium. </p>
<p>Russia has gained control over a significant portion of Ukraine’s
identified mineral resources in the territories it occupies. If Russia
permanently seizes that land, Ukraine will lose access to those minerals
and other reserves, which would be a blow to both European and U.S.
security. </p>
<p>First US-Japan-ROK trilateral </p>
<p>Rubio’s expected talks with both Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi
Iwaya and South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul in Munich would take
place amid concerns over North Korea’s military ties with Russia,
China’s support for Russia’s defense industry, and security challenges
in the Indo-Pacific. </p>
<p>On Jan. 21, Rubio met with Iwaya in Washington to discuss
strengthening U.S.-Japan cooperation against global security threats,
including what officials describe as “China’s destabilizing actions” in
the Indo-Pacific. The following day, he spoke with Cho by phone, where
both emphasized the need to further trilateral cooperation among the
U.S., Japan and South Korea. </p>
<p>“We need to do more and strengthen relationships with our friends
around the world,” said Republican Congressman Rob Wittman of Virginia
during a discussion hosted by the Washington-based Center for Strategic
and International Studies, or CSIS, on Tuesday.   </p>
<p>“We should be concerned about China’s growing relationships with
countries like Russia,” he added. Wittman serves as the vice chairman of
the House Armed Services Committee. </p>
<p>He described the military cooperation between Russia and North Korea
as “transactional,” adding that Moscow’s technology transfers to
Pyongyang are not out of the “goodness of the heart.” </p>
<p>The U.S.-Japan-ROK trilateral framework was established under former
president Joe Biden’s administration.  </p>
<p>Experts, including former senior State Department official Rick
Waters, note that such trilateral cooperation has become increasingly
institutionalized, making it “hard to reverse” — even amid South Korea’s
political turmoil following President Yoon Suk Yeol’s impeachment over
his brief martial law attempt last December. </p>
<p>“I’d be very surprised if, in four years, we would see anything other
than further consolidation” of existing U.S. alliance frameworks in the
Indo-Pacific,” Waters said Tuesday at the CSIS event. </p>
<p>Middle East </p>
<p>Rubio will travel to the Middle East after holding talks with his
counterparts in Munich. </p>
<p>On Tuesday, he spoke with UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al
Nahyan ahead of his visit to Abu Dhabi, the country’s capital, next
week. </p>
<p>They “discussed the ceasefire agreement in Gaza and the importance of
ensuring that Hamas releases all hostages, including American citizens,”
according to the State Department. </p>
<p>Spokesperson Tammy Bruce said that the two also “highlighted the
imperative of ensuring that Hamas can never rule Gaza or threaten Israel
again” during the call. </p>
<p>Trump said this week the Hamas militant group must release all
hostages held in Gaza by midday Saturday, or he will propose canceling
the Israel-Hamas ceasefire. </p>
<p>Rubio is scheduled to travel to Munich, Jerusalem, Riyadh and Abu
Dhabi from Feb. 13-18.</p>

id="white-house-blocks-ap-reporter-from-oval-office-event-over-gulf-of-america-policy">White
House blocks AP reporter from Oval Office event over ‘Gulf of America’
policy</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The White House blocked an Associated Press reporter from an event in
the Oval Office on Tuesday because the news agency has not altered its
style on the Gulf of Mexico, which U.S. President Donald Trump has
ordered renamed to the Gulf of America, the news agency said.</p>
<p>Julie Pace, the AP’s executive editor, said the White House informed
the nonprofit news agency that the AP would be blocked from the Oval
Office event if the outlet did not align its editorial standards with
Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf
of America.</p>
<p>An AP reporter attempted to enter the White House event on Tuesday
afternoon but was turned away. Later Tuesday night, a second AP reporter
was barred from an event in the White House Diplomatic Room.</p>
<p>“As a global news organization, The Associated Press informs billions
of people around the world every day with factual, nonpartisan
journalism,” Pace said in a statement.</p>
<p>“It is alarming that the Trump administration would punish AP for its
independent journalism,” Pace said. “Limiting our access to the Oval
Office based on the content of AP’s speech not only severely impedes the
public’s access to independent news, it plainly violates the First
Amendment.”</p>
<p>The White House Correspondents’ Association, or WHCA, also condemned
the decision as “unacceptable.”</p>
<p>“The White House cannot dictate how news organizations report the
news,” WHCA President Eugene Daniels said in a statement.</p>
<p>The White House did not immediately reply to a VOA request for
comment in response to the AP and WHCA statements.</p>
<p>Shortly after being inaugurated, Trump signed an executive order to
rename the Gulf of Mexico and Denali, the highest peak in North America.
According to his order, the Gulf of Mexico would be renamed the Gulf of
America, and Denali would revert to Mount McKinley — its name before
President Barack Obama changed it in 2015.</p>
<p>A few days later, the AP announced that the news agency would
continue referring to the body of water as the Gulf of Mexico while
acknowledging the new name Trump had picked. The AP said it made that
decision because the gulf has carried the Gulf of Mexico name for more
than 400 years and that other countries and international bodies do not
need to recognize the name change.</p>
<p>However, since the area of the Alaskan mountain lies entirely in the
United States and Trump has authority to change the name, the AP said it
will use the name Mount McKinley.</p>
<p>Thousands of journalists and writers around the world follow the AP’s
style.</p>
<p>Voice of America typically follows the AP’s style, but VOA’s
standards editor announced in late January that the congressionally
funded but editorially independent news outlet would begin referring to
the body of water as the Gulf of America, in addition to referring to
the mountain as Mount McKinley.</p>

<h2 id="cost-of-groceries-gas-goes-up-as-us-inflation-worsens">Cost of
groceries, gas goes up as US inflation worsens</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. inflation accelerated last month as the cost of
groceries, gas and used cars rose, a disappointment for families and
businesses struggling with higher costs and likely underscoring the
Federal Reserve’s resolve to delay any further interest rate cuts.</p>
<p>The consumer price index increased 3% in January from a year ago,
Wednesday’s report from the Labor Department showed, up from 2.9% the
previous month. It has increased from a 3½-year low of 2.4% in
September.</p>
<p>The figures show that inflation has remained stubbornly above the
Fed’s 2% target for roughly the past six months, after it fell steadily
for about a year and a half. Elevated prices created a major political
problem for former President Joe Biden. President Donald Trump pledged
to reduce prices in last year’s campaign, although most economists worry
that his many proposed tariffs could at least temporarily increase
costs.</p>
<p>The unexpected boost in inflation could dampen some of the business
enthusiasm that arose after Trump’s election on promises to reduce
regulation and cut taxes. Dow futures tumbled 400 points, and all major
markets are likely to sell off at the opening bell. Bond yields rose, a
sign traders expect inflation and interest rates to remain high.</p>
<p>Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core consumer
prices rose 3.3% in January compared with a year ago, up from 3.2% in
December. Economists closely watch core prices because they can provide
a better read of inflation’s future.</p>
<p>Month-to-month inflation</p>
<p>Inflation also worsened monthly, with prices jumping 0.5% in January
from December, the largest increase since August 2023. Core prices
climbed 0.4% last month, the most since March 2024.</p>
<p>Grocery prices climbed 0.5% just in January, pushed higher by a 15.2%
surge in egg prices, the biggest monthly increase since June of 2015.
Egg prices have soared 53% compared with a year ago.</p>
<p>An avian flu epidemic has forced many egg producers to cull millions
of birds from their flocks. Some stores have imposed limits on egg
purchases, and some restaurants have placed surcharges on egg
dishes.</p>
<p>The cost of car insurance continues to rise and picked up 2% just
from December to January. Hotel prices rose 1.4% last month, while the
cost of a gallon of gas moved up 1.8%.</p>
<p>Inflation often jumps in January as many companies raise their prices
at the beginning of the year, although the government’s seasonal
adjustment process is supposed to filter out those effects.</p>
<p>Later Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will testify
before the House Financial Services Committee, where he will likely be
asked about inflation and the Fed’s response to it. The Fed raised its
benchmark rate in 2022 and 2023 to a two-decade high of 5.3% to combat
inflation. With inflation down significantly from its 9.1% peak in June
2022, it cut its rate to about 4.3% in its final three meetings last
year.</p>
<p>Interest rates and tariffs</p>
<p>Early Wednesday, Trump said on social media that interest rates
should be lowered, “something which would go hand in hand with upcoming
Tariffs!!!” Yet the tick up in consumer prices makes it less likely the
Fed will cut rates anytime soon.</p>
<p>Fed officials are mostly confident that inflation over time will head
lower, but they want to see further evidence that it is declining before
cutting their key rate any further. The Fed’s rate typically influences
other borrowing costs for things such as mortgages, auto loans and
credit cards.</p>
<p>Inflation’s recent uptick is a major reason the Federal Reserve has
paused its interest rate cuts, after implementing three of them last
year. “We do not need to be in a hurry” to implement further reductions,
Powell said Tuesday in testimony to the Senate Banking Committee.</p>
<p>The Trump administration’s tariff policy could lift prices in the
coming months. Trump on Monday imposed 25% taxes on steel and aluminum
imports and has pledged to impose more tariffs. Economists at Goldman
Sachs forecast that yearly core inflation would fall almost a full
percentage point, to 2.3%, by the end of this year, absent any import
duties. But they expect tariffs will raise end-of-year inflation to
2.8%.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Powell acknowledged that higher tariffs could lift
inflation and limit the central bank’s ability to cut rates, calling it
“a possible outcome.”</p>
<p>But he emphasized that it would depend on how many imports are hit
with tariffs and for how long.</p>
<p>“In some cases, it doesn’t reach the consumer much, and in some cases
it does,” Powell said. “And it really does depend on facts that we
haven’t seen yet.”</p>

id="paul-mccartney-rocks-the-bowery---inside-his-surprise-nyc-concert">Paul
McCartney rocks the Bowery - Inside his surprise NYC concert</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — Paul McCartney’s previous New York-area performance took
place three years ago at MetLife Stadium, capacity 82,500. His surprise
show Tuesday night at the Bowery Ballroom fit, at most, 575.</p>
<p>It was probably less than that since McCartney’s sound board and gear
— too much to fit backstage — occupied a portion of the floor space at
the venerable downtown theater. The whole thing felt like, and was, a
lark. McCartney announced the show just hours before taking the
stage.</p>
<p>Like an echo of Beatlemania, the news swept through Manhattan and
beyond earlier in the day, sending New Yorkers sprinting down Delancey
Street for a chance to snag one of the few tickets at the Bowery. Most
in attendance, including McCartney, himself, could hardly believe it was
happening.</p>
<p>“So, here we are,” McCartney said, grinning. “Some little gig. New
York. Why not?”</p>
<p>Later, before launching into “Let Me Roll It,” he added: “I can’t
quite believe we’re here, doing this. But we are here, doing this.”</p>
<p>It was not McCartney’s first impromptu concert. The Beatles famously
performed in 1969 atop the roof of their Apple Corps headquarters at 3
Savile Row in London. Since then, he’s made something of a habit of it
on trips to New York.</p>
<p>In 2009, McCartney returned to the Ed Sullivan Theater, site of the
Beatles’ famous U.S. debut, and performed above the marquee. In 2018, he
popped up in Grand Central Terminal to promote the release of his
“Egyptian Station.”</p>
<p>With temperatures in the low 30s on Tuesday, McCartney, 82, this time
opted for an intimate, indoor show. Tickets were sold only physically at
the venue, one per person. All were snapped up within about 30
minutes.</p>
<p>For those quick enough, it was like hitting the lottery.</p>
<p>Amy Jaffe, 69, was at home about 30 blocks north when she saw the
announcement on Instagram. “I thought: I can do this,” Jaffe said before
the show. “I put on jeans, grabbed a coat, called a Lyft.”</p>
<p>Jaffe has seen McCartney many times before, including with the
Beatles in 1964 in Forrest Hills, Queens. But she was still incredulous,
smiling and shaking her head: “I don’t actually believe it.”</p>
<p>Phil Sokoloff, 31, was on his way to work nearby when he saw the
news. He ran in and told his co-worker, Mat Fuller, and they rushed over
to the Bowery Ballroom.</p>
<p>“We just got lucky,” Sokoloff said. “I’m always learning about these
things the day after.”</p>
<p>McCartney took the stage roughly on time at 6:30 p.m. with his
regular band, along with a three-member horn section. They had only
rehearsed once, the day before, McCartney said. Someone shouted: “You
don’t need to rehearse!”</p>
<p>If the location was stripped down, the former Beatle didn’t come with
a minimized show, packing in a blistering tour through his entire
catalog, from Beatles classics to Wings hits. He began with “A Hard
Day’s Night” and also performed “Got To Get You Into My Life,” “Maybe
I’m Amazed,” “Lady Madonna,” “Jet,” “Get Back,” “Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da,”
“Let it Be” and “Hey Jude.”</p>
<p>“Blackbird” was a solo number on acoustic guitar, and afterward
McCartney reflected on how he wrote it for the Civil Rights Movement, a
memory that brought back his first trips to the United States.</p>
<p>“We were just kids,” McCartney said. “I’ve got grandchildren older
than that now.”</p>
<p>In the early days, he said, he and John Lennon were always writing
for the audience, and the songs were all about reaching out: “I Want to
Hold Your Hand,” “From Me to You.”</p>
<p>“It had everything to do with the fans, really,” McCartney said.</p>
<p>Before playing the Wings song “Mrs. Vanderbilt,” McCartney spoke of
playing it in front of 350,000 people in Kyiv, when Ukraine was
exuberant with a newfound freedom. “Let’s hope it gets back to that
soon,” he said.</p>
<p>Conversation, mixed with shouts from the audience, peppered the set.
After one particularly shrill scream, McCartney responded. “That was a
Beatles scream.” Then he asked for more, saying, “OK, let’s get it out
of the way. Girls, give me a Beatles scream.” All in attendance
obliged.</p>
<p>McCartney also performed the so-called last Beatles song, “Now and
Then,” a ballad penned by Lennon in the late ’70s but only released in
2023 with the help of the some of the technology used in Peter Jackson’s
2021 documentary, “The Beatles: Get Back.” The song made McCartney
wistful for his songwriting partner, whom he noted loved New York.</p>
<p>“Let’s hear it for John,” he said.</p>
<p>McCartney, who was spotted Sunday at the Super Bowl in New Orleans
chatting with Adam Sandler, was in New York for the upcoming “Saturday
Night Live” 50th anniversary festivities. He’s to be a guest on the
star-studded television special Sunday.</p>
<p>It was unclear if McCartney was playing a single show or preparing
for something more. He wrapped the Got Back Tour in December and has
said he’s hoping to finish a new album this year.</p>
<p>For now, though, it was a one-night-only event. One crowd member
asked McCartney if it could go all night. “Some of us need to get some
sleep, you know,” he replied.</p>

id="snow-and-freezing-rain-pummel-the-mid-atlantic-while-california-prepares-for-likely-flooding">Snow
and freezing rain pummel the mid-Atlantic while California prepares for
likely flooding</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Snow, sleet and freezing rain were expected to continue pummeling the
central Appalachians and mid-Atlantic states Wednesday, while California
readied for a storm that could flood areas ravaged by the recent
wildfires. </p>
<p>Especially heavy snowfall — up to nearly 25 centimeters — was
expected in parts of Virginia and West Virginia, according to the
National Weather Service. Ice accumulations could reach more than 8.4
millimeters in Stanleytown, Virginia, and 6.3 millimeters in Glendale
Springs, North Carolina. </p>
<p>In California, an atmospheric river — a long band of water vapor that
can transport moisture from the tropics to more northern areas — was
expected to move in late Wednesday, likely flooding urban areas across
central and Southern California, according to the weather service. </p>
<p>The snowstorm that blew into the mid-Atlantic states on Tuesday
caused accidents on icy roads and prompted school closures. By Tuesday
night, nearly 12,000 people in Virginia had lost power, according to
PowerOutage.us. </p>
<p>“Stay home and off the roads tonight, Virginia,” the Virginia
Department of Transportation posted on social media Tuesday night,
alongside a meme of Dorothy from “The Wizard of Oz” saying, “There’s no
place like home.” </p>
<p>In parts of Baltimore and Washington, 2.5 centimeters of snow was
falling each hour, according to the weather service. All Washington
public schools were closed Wednesday due to the weather. </p>
<p>Appalachian Power, which serves 1 million customers in West Virginia,
Virginia and Tennessee, said Tuesday it had 5,400 workers dedicated to
restoring power. </p>
<p>About 65 Virginia National Guard soldiers were at facilities along
the Interstate 95 and state Route 29 corridors and in southwest Virginia
to support the storm response, guard officials said. Another 20 soldiers
and members of the Virginia Defense Force were in support roles. </p>
<p>Winter storm warnings extended from northwest North Carolina to
southern New Jersey, and the snow-and-ice mix was expected to become all
rain by Wednesday afternoon as temperatures climb. </p>
<p>Meanwhile a separate storm system was expected to dump heavy snow on
an area stretching from Kansas to the Great Lakes starting Tuesday
night, the weather service said. The Kansas Legislature canceled
Wednesday meetings because of the weather, and Gov. Laura Kelly closed
state offices in the capital, Topeka. </p>
<p>Hundreds of accidents </p>
<p>In Virginia, where Gov. Glenn Youngkin declared a state of emergency
and schools and government offices were closed Tuesday, state police
reported 700 accidents and dozens of injuries Tuesday. Matt Demlein, a
spokesperson for the Virginia State Police, said they can’t say
definitively that all were weather related. </p>
<p>In southern West Virginia, multiple crashes temporarily shut down
several major highways Tuesday. Smith’s Towing and Truck Repair
responded to at least 15 calls, mostly from tractor-trailer drivers who
got stuck on Interstate 64 in Greenbrier County near the Virginia
border, dispatcher Kelly Pickles said. </p>
<p>“Basically, they just get sucked over into the median or they go off
of the interstate just a little bit on the right-hand side,” she said.
“And they just don’t have enough power in their vehicles to get back
onto the road, due to the icy conditions.” </p>
<p>‘Skating rinks instead of roads’ </p>
<p>Paige Williams, who owns Downtown Books in Lexington, Virginia,
closed her store Tuesday because of the weather. She hoped to reopen
Wednesday, noting that Lexington and surrounding Rockbridge County are
dependable when it comes to clearing the roads. </p>
<p>But with temperatures on either side of freezing Tuesday night and
Wednesday, the rain that is supposed to follow could make the roads
better or worse. </p>
<p>“It’s just going to depend on where those temperatures go,” Williams
said. “Rain can clear things off. And rain can also freeze. And then you
have a lot of skating rinks instead of roads.” </p>
<p>Bitter cold temperatures </p>
<p>An Arctic air mass stretched from Portland, Oregon, to the Great
Lakes. </p>
<p>The temperature bottomed out Tuesday morning at minus 35 Celsius in
Butte, Montana, where over the past two winters at least five people
died from cold exposure, said Brayton Erickson, executive director of
the Butte Rescue Mission. </p>
<p>Advocates for homeless people in the city of about 35,000 were out on
the streets distributing sleeping bags, jackets, mittens and other cold
weather gear to anyone who needed them, according to Erickson. </p>
<p>“When it gets this cold, we kind of pull out all the stops,” Erickson
said. </p>
<p>In Oregon’s Multnomah County, officials extended a state of emergency
through at least Thursday. Five emergency shelters were set to open
Tuesday night through Wednesday afternoon. Midweek wind chill readings
could dip to minus 12 Celsius in Portland, the weather service said.</p>

<h2 id="us-teacher-returns-home-after-being-freed-by-russia">US teacher
returns home after being freed by Russia</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump welcomed American teacher Marc Fogel to
the White House late Tuesday after Fogel was freed from Russia where he
had been detained since August 2021 for bringing medically prescribed
marijuana into the country.</p>
<p>“I feel like the luckiest man on Earth right now,” Fogel said as he
stood next to Trump.</p>
<p>Fogel praised the president, U.S. diplomats and lawmakers for working
to secure his release.</p>
<p>“I am in awe of what they all did,” Fogel said.</p>
<p>Trump said he appreciated what Russia did in letting Fogel go home
but declined to specify the details of any agreement with Russia beyond
calling it “very fair” and very reasonable.”</p>
<p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Wednesday that the
United States was releasing a Russian citizen from a U.S. prison as part
of the deal and that their identity would be made public once they
arrived back in Russia. </p>
<p>Trump also said another hostage release would be announced
Wednesday.</p>
<p>Mike Waltz, Trump’s national security adviser, said earlier Tuesday
the United States and Russia “negotiated an exchange” to free Fogel but
gave no details about what the U.S. side of the bargain entailed. In
such deals in recent years, the U.S. has often released Russian
prisoners that Moscow wanted in exchange.</p>
<p>Instead, Waltz cast the deal for Fogel’s release in broader
geopolitical terms, saying it was “a show of good faith from the
Russians and a sign we are moving in the right direction to end the
brutal and terrible war in Ukraine,” an invasion Russia launched against
its neighbor in February 2022, with hundreds of thousands killed or
wounded on both sides.</p>
<p>Trump had vowed to broker an end to Russia’s war on Ukraine before
taking office Jan. 20, but his aides more recently have said he hopes to
do it within the first 100 days of his new administration, roughly by
the end of April.</p>
<p>“Since President Trump’s swearing-in, he has successfully secured the
release of Americans detained around the world, and President Trump will
continue until all Americans being held are returned to the United
States,” Waltz said. The recent release of six Americans held in
Venezuela and Fogel’s freeing are the only publicly known instances.</p>
<p>Fogel had been traveling with a small amount of medically prescribed
marijuana to treat back pain. Once convicted by a Russian court, he
began serving his 14-year sentence in June 2022, with the outgoing
administration of former President Joe Biden late last year classifying
him as wrongfully detained.</p>

<h2 id="us-japan-aligned-in-peace-through-strength-to-counter-china">US,
Japan aligned in ‘peace through strength’ to counter China</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — After the meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump
and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba last week, the two nations
voiced alignment on Trump’s “peace through strength” approach toward
countering China in the Indo-Pacific region, analysts said.</p>
<p>“The prime minister and I will be working closely together to
maintain peace and security — and I also say – peace through strength
all over the Indo-Pacific,” said Trump, at a press conference after his
meeting Friday with Ishiba in Washington.</p>
<p>“We agreed to cooperate even more closely to combat the Chinese
economic aggression, which is quite aggressive,” Trump said.</p>
<p>Ishiba said: “Further strengthening the strong and unwavering
Japan-U.S. alliance to achieving a free and open Indo-Pacific” is key
“to advance the national interests of both of our countries in synergy
and to realize peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific.”</p>
<p>Analysts say the first official meeting between Trump and Ishiba
succeeded in striking agreements on what both leaders consider crucial:
combating China’s aggression and strengthening their national
interests.</p>
<p>Security commitment</p>
<p>Ishiba continued to forge close ties with the U.S. to maintain
multilateral alliance security cooperation close to home in the
Indo-Pacific, while Trump secured Japanese investments and
purchases.</p>
<p>Taken together, analysts say, Ishiba is aligned with Trump’s vision
of making the U.S. strong at home in his “America First” approach as a
prerequisite for maintaining peace through strength in the Indo-Pacific,
a region crucial to Japan’s defense.</p>
<p>“The U.S.-Japan leaders’ communiqué went a long way to reaffirm
Trump’s peace through strength approach to the Indo-Pacific,” said
Kenneth Weinstein, the Japan chair at Hudson Institute.</p>
<p>“The U.S.-Japan leaders’ communiqué, which President Trump signed off
on, highlighted the importance of multilateral networks in the
Indo-Pacific,” Weinstein told VOA on Sunday.</p>
<p>“The two leaders intend to advance multilayered and aligned
cooperation” with the Quad security dialogue and three separate
trilateral ties with South Korea, Australia and the Philippines “to
realize a free and open Indo-Pacific,” Trump and Ishiba said in a joint
statement.</p>
<p>There were concerns by some that Trump would not support alliance
security formations aimed at maintaining peace and security in the
region.</p>
<p>“A big concern on the part of the Japanese” was whether the Biden
administration’s emphasis “on the centrality of alliance” or the
“so-called multilayered structures” or “mini laterals” would continue,
said Daniel Sneider, a lecturer in East Asian Studies at Stanford
University.</p>
<p>Sneider told VOA on Monday, “It was reassuring for the Japanese and
for those in the U.S. who are worried whether those types of policies
would have continuity that there was at least a written affirmation of
those things in the joint statement.”</p>
<p>In their joint statement, Trump and Ishiba also expressed “strong
opposition” to China’s attempts to change the status quo in the East
China Sea and its unlawful maritime claims in the South China Sea.</p>
<p>They also expressed support for Taiwan’s “meaningful participation in
international organizations” and opposed China’s efforts to disturb
stability across the Taiwan Strait.</p>
<p>At a press briefing held in Beijing on Monday, Chinese Foreign
Ministry Spokesperson Guo Jiakun, said, “The part of the U.S.-Japan
joint statement on China constitutes open interference in China’s
domestic affairs and an attack and smear against China, which is also
aimed at scaremongering in the region.”</p>
<p>Increased investment</p>
<p>Trump announced at the press conference that Japan will invest $1
trillion in the U.S., participate in the Alaska LNG project, and invest
in, rather than buy, U.S. Steel.</p>
<p>In one of the first executive orders Trump signed on Jan. 20, he made
Alaskan natural resources open to development and production and its
liquefied natural gas available for sale to U.S. allied nations within
the Pacific region.</p>
<p>Ishiba said, “An unprecedented investment” from Japan to the U.S. and
the Japanese investments in U.S. Steel are “mutually beneficial” and
“contribute not only to the United States and Japan but also to the
whole world.”  </p>
<p>Weinstein, at Hudson, said, “The announcement of a trillion dollars
in foreign investment in the U.S. was the landmark moment, as was the
announcement of the investments in the LNG sector” and “the pending U.S.
Steel investment.”</p>
<p>“Ishiba is supporting what is in Japan’s best interest: an alliance
with minimal distance between the U.S. and Japan,” he said. “So he
understands he needs to back the America First approach to continue
alignment with the Trump administration. A strong America is the best
guarantee for global peace and stability.”</p>
<p>In explaining what foreign policy would look like under the Trump
administration, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, during his confirmation
hearing in January, emphasized “a foreign policy centered on our
national interest” and making the U.S. strong first at home as the
prerequisite for maintaining peace and security around the world.</p>
<p>“Ishiba respects Trump’s America First” policy, but he is also a
“Japan first” prime minister, said Yuki Tatsumi, director of the Japan
Program at the Stimson Center.</p>
<p>She told VOA on Friday that “both leaders gained. Trump got a
commitment of increased investment by Japan in the U.S., while Ishiba
gained Trump’s articulation of the U.S. commitment to the defense of
Japanese territory, including the Senkaku Islands, and the joint
statement in which U.S.-Japan support for Taiwan was articulated.”</p>
<p>In the joint statement, Ishiba and Trump underscored the United
States’ “unwavering commitment” to defending Japan using its full range
of capabilities, including nuclear capabilities. The two also
“reiterated their strong opposition to any action that seeks to
undermine Japan’s long and peaceful administration of the Senkaku
Islands.”</p>
<p>There is “continuity” from the Biden administration to the Trump
administration, Tatsumi said, and that is to make U.S.-Japan ties “the
hub of alliance cooperation and partnership across the
Indo-Pacific.”</p>

<p>date: 2025-02-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — A giant schnauzer named Monty won the top prize at the
Westminster Kennel Club dog show Tuesday night.</p>
<p>Monty bested six other finalists to take best in show at Madison
Square Garden. The award is considered the most prestigious prize in the
U.S. dog show world.</p>
<p>Each dog is judged according to how closely it matches the ideal for
its breed.</p>
<p>Winners get a trophy, ribbons and bragging rights, but no cash
prize.</p>
<p>Other finalists included a bichon frisé called Neal, a Skye terrier
named Archer, a whippet and repeat runner-up known as Bourbon, a shih
tzu called Comet who’s been a finalist before, a German shepherd named
Mercedes, who came in second last year, and an English springer spaniel
called Freddie.</p>
<p>Monty made the finals for a third year in a row and won the huge
American Kennel Club’s big show in December.</p>
<p>A Westminster win is considered the most prestigious award in the
U.S. dog show world. Each dog is judged according to how closely it
matches the ideal for its breed.</p>
<p>Winners get a trophy, ribbons and bragging rights, but no cash
prize.</p>
<p>Every dog at Westminster is a titled champion, but they also are
household pets. Some also do therapy work, search-and-rescue or other
canine jobs.</p>
<p>“A good German shepherd is an all-purpose dog,” said co-breeder and
co-owner Sheree Moses Combs of Wardensville, West Virginia. Some of her
pups have become service dogs for wounded veterans, she said.</p>
<p>“Dog shows are fun, but that is what our breed is all about,” she
said.</p>
<p>Big dogs had their day at Westminster on Tuesday, when “working”
breeds had their turns in the ring. First-round competitor Brina, for
instance, is a 71.6 kilogram Neapolitan mastiff.</p>
<p>“I’ve been struck by this breed since I was 12. … They’re so unique,”
owner Yves Belmont, Ph.D., said as Brina napped in her crate, equipped
with a 7.5-liter water bucket.</p>
<p>With their size, jowly heads and guard-dog history, the breed was
developed to be imposing. But Belmont, who currently has several of them
at his family’s Atlanta-area home, said he also is impressed by their
intelligence.</p>
<p>A trip to Westminster is a reminder of dogs’ variety, even just among
purebreds. The same day Brina competed, Tyra the miniature bull terrier
also strutted her stuff. Formally called GCH CH Rnr’s Top Model, she’s
named after fashion model Tyra Banks.</p>
<p>The hardy terrier breed is “a big dog in a small package, but they
always keep you smiling,” said owner and co-breeder Jessica Harrison of
Austin, Texas. Asked where the 2-year-old Tyra falls on the mischief
meter, Harrison smiled, “like a nine, for sure.”</p>
<p>“You can’t be upset with them because they’re just so cute,” she said
as Tyra rolled on her back to get a belly rub from a passerby at the
Javits Center, the convention venue that hosted the first-round judging
of each breed.</p>
<p>Regardless which dog gets the trophy at Westminster, others also have
scored points with the crowd.</p>
<p>During two nights of semifinals, spectators shouted out breeds and
names of canine competitors as if they played for one of the pro teams
that call the Garden home, the NBA’s New York Knicks and NHL’s New York
Rangers.</p>
<p>“Love you, Lumpy!” someone yelled to a Pekingese named Lumpy, who
earned laughs for his ambling gait.</p>
<p>The arena erupted with cheers for a golden retriever named Tuffy, a
representative of a popular breed that has never won. Calaco, a
Xoloitzcuintli, got huge applause for a confident performance that also
earned him some recognition from the judge. Xoloitzcuintlis, are
hairless dogs with deep roots in Mexico.</p>
<p>A Doberman pinscher called Penny got whoops of approval from
spectators, too. Despite her dignified, focused appearance, Penny can be
“a mush,” breeder and co-owner Theresa Connors-Chan of Ontario, Canada,
said earlier in the day.</p>
<p>Westminster also featured agility and obedience championships, held
Saturday. The agility prize went to a border collie named Vanish, and an
Australian shepherd called Willie triumphed in obedience.</p>

House fires USAID inspector general after funding oversight warning,
officials say</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The White House fired the inspector general for the U.S.
Agency for International Development on Tuesday, several U.S. officials
said. The dismissal comes a day after his office warned that the Trump
administration’s dismantling of USAID had made it all but impossible to
monitor $8.2 billion in unspent humanitarian funds. </p>
<p>The White House gave no reason for the firing of Inspector General
Paul Martin, one of the officials said. The dismissal was first reported
by CNN. The officials were not authorized to comment publicly and spoke
on condition of anonymity. </p>
<p>Inspectors general are typically independently funded watchdogs
tasked with rooting out waste, fraud and abuse at government agencies.
The Trump administration earlier purged more than a dozen inspectors
general. </p>
<p>On Monday, Martin’s office issued a flash report warning that the
Trump administration’s funding freeze and staff actions within USAID had
left oversight of the humanitarian aid “largely nonoperational.” </p>
<p>That includes the agency’s greatly reduced ability to ensure none of
the $8.2 billion in unspent unhumanitarian funds falls into the hands of
violent extremist groups or goes astray in conflict zones, the watchdog
said. </p>
<p>Multiparty lawsuit </p>
<p>Separately, a lawsuit filed Tuesday alleged that the Trump
administration’s fast-paced dismantling of USAID is stiffing American
businesses on hundreds of millions of dollars in unpaid bills for work
that has already been done. </p>
<p>The administration’s abrupt freeze on foreign aid also is forcing
mass layoffs by U.S. suppliers and contractors for USAID, including 750
furloughs at one company, Washington-based Chemonics International, the
lawsuit says. </p>
<p>“One cannot overstate the impact of that unlawful course of conduct:
on businesses large and small forced to shut down their programs and let
employees go; on hungry children across the globe who will go without;
on populations around the world facing deadly disease; and on our
constitutional order,” the U.S. businesses and organizations said. </p>
<p>An organization representing 170 small U.S. businesses, major
suppliers, an American Jewish group aiding displaced people abroad, the
American Bar Association and others joined the court challenge. </p>
<p>It was filed in U.S. District Court in Washington against President
Donald Trump; Secretary of State Marco Rubio; acting USAID Deputy
Administrator Peter Marocco, a Trump appointee who has been a central
figure in hollowing out the agency; and Russell Vought, Trump’s head of
the Office of Management and Budget. </p>
<p>Marocco defended the funding cutoff and push to put all but a
fraction of USAID staff on leave in an affidavit filed late Monday in
the lawsuit brought by the workers’ groups. </p>
<p>“Insubordination” and “noncompliance” by USAID staffers made it
necessary to stop funding and operations by the agency to allow the
administration to carry out a program-by-program review to decide which
U.S. aid programs could resume overseas, Marocco wrote. </p>
<p>It is at least the third lawsuit over the administration’s rapid
unraveling of the U.S. aid and development agency and its programs
worldwide. Trump and ally Elon Musk have targeted USAID in particular,
saying its work is out of line with Trump’s agenda. </p>
<p>Marocco, Musk and Rubio have overseen an across-the-board freeze on
foreign assistance and an agency shutdown under a January 20 executive
order by Trump. A lawsuit brought by federal employees associations has
temporarily blocked the administration from pulling thousands of USAID
staffers off the job. The funding freeze and other measures have
persisted, including the agency losing the lease on its Washington
headquarters. </p>
<p>Interceding for farmers </p>
<p>The new administration terminated contracts without the required
30-day notice and without back payments for work that was already done,
according to a U.S. official, a businessperson with a USAID contract and
an email seen by The Associated Press. They spoke on condition of
anonymity for fear of reprisal by the Trump administration. </p>
<p>For Chemonics, one of the larger of the USAID partners, the funding
freeze has meant $103 million in unpaid invoices and almost $500 million
in USAID-ordered medication, food and other goods stalled in the supply
chain or ports, the lawsuit says. </p>
<p>For the health commodities alone, not delivering them “on time could
potentially lead to as many as 566,000 deaths from HIV/AIDS, malaria,
and unmet reproductive health needs, including 215,000 pediatric
deaths,” the lawsuit says. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, seven Republican lawmakers from farm states introduced
legislation to safeguard a long-running $1.8 billion food-aid program
run by the aid agency, by moving the Food for Peace program under the
Department of Agriculture. </p>
<p>Farmers, a politically important bloc for the Trump administration,
have been affected by the administration’s funding freeze as well.
Kansas Republican Senator Jerry Moran, who announced the legislation,
over the weekend thanked Rubio for interceding to allow delivery of $560
million in U.S.-grown commodities intended for hunger programs worldwide
but stuck in ports because of the administration’s abrupt cutoff of
foreign assistance spending.</p>

York health department confirms first case of new mpox strain</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The New York State Department of Health on Tuesday confirmed its
first case of the new mpox strain, adding to the global concerns over
the spread of the little-known variant.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
there were three confirmed cases in the country — in California, Georgia
and New Hampshire — caused by the clade Ib strain. The agency said the
three cases were not linked.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization declared mpox a global public health
emergency for the second time in two years in August, following an
outbreak of the viral infection in the Democratic Republic of Congo that
has spread to neighboring countries.</p>
<p>The New York State Department of Health declined to provide further
information on the case.</p>

<h2 id="doge-cuts-900m-from-agency-tracking-us-students-progress">DOGE
cuts $900M from agency tracking US students’ progress</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — A federal research agency that tracks the progress of
America’s students is to lose $900 million in funding after Elon Musk’s
Department of Government Efficiency found no need for much of its
work. </p>
<p>It’s unclear to what degree the Education Department’s Institute of
Education Sciences will continue to exist after Musk’s team slashed
scores of contracts. Industry groups said at least 169 contracts were
suddenly terminated Monday, accounting for much of the institute’s
work. </p>
<p>The Education Department did not immediately share details on the
cuts. Madison Biedermann, an agency spokesperson, said the action will
not affect the institute’s primary work, including the NAEP assessment,
known as the nation’s report card, and the College Scorecard, a database
of university costs and outcomes. </p>
<p>Musk’s grip on the Education Department was dealt a setback Tuesday
when the agency temporarily blocked DOGE workers from more than a dozen
internal systems containing sensitive information. As part of a lawsuit
challenging its access, the department agreed to block Musk’s team until
at least Monday while a judge weighs a broader pause. </p>
<p>Advocates sound alarm</p>
<p>The cuts to the institute raised alarm among advocates who said it
could hurt the accountability of America’s education system, leaving the
nation in the dark on schools’ effectiveness. Historically, achievement
gaps have shown low-income students and students of color falling behind
their peers. </p>
<p>The cuts are counterproductive and destructive, said Rachel Dinkes,
president and CEO of the Knowledge Alliance, a coalition of education
research firms. “Cutting out at the knees the one independent agency
that helps improve student outcomes is ridiculous,” Dinkes said. </p>
<p>Biedermann declined to share the names of vendors whose contracts
were cut. </p>
<p>Cuts under contract clause </p>
<p>The Institute of Education Sciences is a central source of
information on the health of America’s education system. Across the
country, it tracks student progress over time and across demographics.
It evaluates the effectiveness of federal programs, and colleges and
schools rely on its research to improve student outcomes. </p>
<p>The cuts appear to have been carried out under a clause allowing IES
to end contracts at any time “for the government’s convenience,”
according to notices obtained by The Associated Press. </p>
<p>Among the projects being cut is a study exploring how to accelerate
math learning for students in fourth and fifth grade, according to a
document obtained by the AP. Known as ReSolve, the project was being led
by research group MDRC. </p>
<p>Last month, IES released the latest NAEP results, revealing that
America’s children have continued to lose ground on reading skills and
made little improvement in math in the wake of the COVID-19
pandemic. </p>
<p>Activate Research, a small business, lost four contracts and plans to
lay off at least 20 of its 28 workers. The company was hired to ensure
accuracy and objectivity in reports. When founder Dinah Sparks announced
the company was winding down Tuesday, she had a message for her team:
“We are not waste,” she said. “We did valuable work for the U.S.
taxpayer.” </p>
<p>Another small business lost multiple contracts after being hired to
collect basic information on the nation’s schools. The company started
laying off workers this week, according to an employee who spoke on the
condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. </p>
<p>Congress gave the institute about $800 million last year, roughly 1%
of the Education Department’s annual budget. </p>
<p>Associations call to reinstate contracts </p>
<p>Two prominent research associations jointly called for the contracts
to be reinstated, saying much of IES’ work is mandated by Congress and
relies on contracts to support its limited staff. The groups said 169
contracts had been cut, curbing the institute’s ability to report data
on school finances and student outcomes. </p>
<p>The institute oversees a wide range of work, including the
administration of the NAEP exam and U.S. participation in PISA, an
assessment that compares academic progress across nations. It’s also a
major funder of education research and keeps a database of research that
has shown results in improving education. </p>
<p>IES shines a light on inequity, and its work is “more than just
numbers and statistics,” said the Education Trust, a nonprofit research
and advocacy group. “Without it, we are left in the dark, unable to see
where educational gaps exist or how to close them,” the group said in a
statement. </p>
<p>Mark Schneider, a former IES commissioner appointed by President
Donald Trump in 2018, said the cuts give the new administration a chance
to rethink programs that have changed little in decades.  </p>
<p>“The question is not what happened on Monday; it’s what happens
next,” Schneider said. “If we just swing this sledgehammer, break all
this stuff and say, ‘OK, done,’ then we’ve wasted an opportunity to fix
things.” </p>
<p>Democratic Senator Patty Murray, a former teacher and member of the
Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, said she will be
“sounding the alarm” to fight the cuts. </p>
<p>Trump has promised to abolish the Education Department and turn its
power over to states and schools. The White House is considering an
order that would direct Trump’s education chief to dismantle the agency
as far as possible while calling on Congress to fully shut it down. </p>
<p>It’s unclear how far Trump could act on his own to slash the
department’s spending, much of which is ordered by Congress.</p>

id="first-us-navy-ships-sail-through-taiwan-strait-since-trump-inauguration">First
US Navy ships sail through Taiwan Strait since Trump inauguration</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BEIJING/TEIPEI — Two U.S. Navy ships sailed through the sensitive
Taiwan Strait this week in the first such mission since President Donald
Trump took office last month, drawing an angry reaction from China,
which said the mission increased security risks.</p>
<p>The U.S. Navy, occasionally accompanied by ships from allied
countries, transits the strait about once a month. China, which claims
Taiwan as its own territory, says the strategic waterway belongs to
it.</p>
<p>The U.S. Navy said the vessels were the Arleigh Burke-class
guided-missile destroyer USS Ralph Johnson and Pathfinder-class survey
ship, USNS Bowditch. The ships carried out a north-to-south transit
Feb. 10-12, it said.</p>
<p>“The transit occurred through a corridor in the Taiwan Strait that is
beyond any coastal state’s territorial seas,” said Navy Commander
Matthew Comer, a spokesperson at the U.S. military’s Indo-Pacific
Command. “Within this corridor all nations enjoy high-seas freedom of
navigation, overflight, and other internationally lawful uses of the sea
related to these freedoms.”</p>
<p>China’s military said that Chinese forces had been dispatched to keep
watch.</p>
<p>“The U.S. action sends the wrong signals and increases security
risks,” the Eastern Theatre Command of the People’s Liberation Army said
in a statement early Wednesday.</p>
<p>China considers Taiwan its most important diplomatic issue and it is
regularly a stumbling block in Sino-U.S. relations.</p>
<p>China this week complained to Japan over “negative” references to
China in a statement issued after a meeting between Trump and Japanese
Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.</p>
<p>That statement called for “maintaining peace and stability across the
Taiwan Strait,” and voiced support for “Taiwan’s meaningful
participation in international organizations.”</p>
<p>Asked in Beijing on Wednesday about the U.S. warships, Zhu Fenglian,
spokesperson for China’s Taiwan Affairs Office, said that Taiwan was a
“core interest” for the country and that the United States should act
with caution.</p>
<p>“We are resolutely opposed to this and will never allow any outside
interference, and have the firm will, full confidence and capability to
uphold the country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,” she
said.</p>
<p>Taiwan’s defense ministry said its forces had also kept watch but
noted the “situation was as normal.”</p>
<p>China’s military operates daily in the strait as part of what
Taiwan’s government views as part of Beijing’s pressure campaign.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Taiwan’s defense ministry said that it had detected 30
Chinese military aircraft and seven navy ships operating around the
island in the previous 24 hour period.</p>
<p>“I really don’t need to explain further who is the so-called
troublemaker around the Taiwan Strait. All other countries in the
neighborhood have a deep appreciation of this,” ministry spokesperson
Sun Li-fang told reporters in Taipei.</p>
<p>Chinese state television said on Wednesday that since Lunar New
Year’s Eve on January 28, the Eastern Theatre Command had repeatedly
dispatched sea and air forces to carry out “combat readiness” patrols
and training missions around Taiwan.</p>
<p>China’s operations aim to “guard the joy and peace of the people on
both sides of the Taiwan Strait,” the report said.</p>
<p>The last publicly acknowledged U.S. Navy mission in the strait was in
late November, when a P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft flew over
the waterway.</p>
<p>The last time a U.S. Navy ship was confirmed to have sailed through
the strait was in October, a joint mission with a Canadian warship.</p>
<p>Taiwan President Lai Ching-te rejects Beijing’s sovereignty claims,
saying only Taiwan’s people can decide their future.</p>

id="appeals-court-rejects-push-to-reinstate-spending-freezes-on-grants-loans">Appeals
court rejects push to reinstate spending freezes on grants, loans</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — A federal appeals court on Tuesday rejected a Trump
administration push to reinstate a sweeping pause on federal funding, a
decision that comes after a judge found the administration had not fully
obeyed an earlier order.</p>
<p>The Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals turned back the
emergency appeal, though it said it expected the lower court judge to
act quickly to clarify.</p>
<p>The Justice Department had asked the appeals court to let it
implement sweeping pauses on federal grants and loans, calling the lower
court order to keep promised money flowing “intolerable judicial
overreach.”</p>
<p>That ruling came from U.S. District Court Judge John McConnell in
Rhode Island, the first judge to find that the administration had
disobeyed a court order.</p>
<p>He is presiding over a lawsuit from nearly two dozen Democratic
states filed after the administration issued a boundary-pushing memo
purporting to halt all federals grants and loans, worth trillions of
dollars. The plan sparked chaos around the country.</p>
<p>The administration has since rescinded that memo, but McConnell found
Monday that not all federal grants and loans had been restored.</p>
<p>Money for things like early childhood education, pollution reduction
and HIV prevention research has remained tied up even after his Jan. 31
order halting the spending freeze plan, the states said.</p>
<p>McConnell, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama,
ordered the Trump administration to “immediately take every step
necessary” to unfreeze all federal grants and loans.</p>
<p>He also said his order blocked the administration from cutting
billions of dollars in grant funding from the National Institutes of
Health, a move announced last week.</p>
<p>The Justice Department said McConnell’s order prevents the executive
branch from exercising its lawful authority, including over
discretionary spending or fraud.</p>
<p>“A single district court judge has attempted to wrest from the
President the power to ‘take care that the laws be faithfully executed.’
This state of affairs cannot be allowed to persist for one more day,”
government attorneys wrote in their appeal.</p>
<p>The states, meanwhile, argued that the president can’t block money
that Congress has approved, and the still-frozen grants and loans are
causing serious problems for their residents. They urged the appeals
court to keep allowing the case to play out in front of McConnell.</p>
<p>The court battle is unfolding as a string of court losses is
increasingly frustrating top administration officials by slowing
President Donald Trump’s wide-ranging agenda .</p>
<p>Judges have also blocked, at least temporarily, Trump’s push to end
birthright citizenship for anyone born in the U.S., access to Treasury
Department records by billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government
Efficiency and a mass deferred resignation plan for federal workers.</p>
<p>The Republican administration previously said the sweeping funding
pause would bring federal spending in line with the president’s
priorities, including increasing fossil fuel production, removing
protections for transgender people and ending diversity, equity and
inclusion efforts.</p>
<p>A different federal judge in Washington has also issued a temporary
restraining order against the funding freeze plan and since expressed
concern that some nonprofit groups weren’t getting their funding.</p>

<h2 id="vance-stakes-claim-to-us-leadership-in-ai">Vance stakes claim to
US leadership in AI</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance on Tuesday vowed that the United
States would maintain its leadership position in the development of
advanced artificial intelligence and warned leaders of other countries
not to adopt regulatory standards that might “kill” the new technology
“just as it’s taking off.” </p>
<p>“The United States of America is the leader in AI, and our
administration plans to keep it that way,” Vance told an audience of
world leaders at an AI summit in Paris. He said the administration of
President Donald Trump “will ensure that the most powerful AI systems
are built in the U.S. with American-designed and manufactured
chips.” </p>
<p>Vance said that the U.S. is open to collaboration with its allies.
“But,” he said, “to create that kind of trust, we need international
regulatory regimes that foster the creation of AI technology rather than
strangles it, and we need our European friends in particular to look to
this new frontier with optimism rather than trepidation.” </p>
<p>Regulations criticized </p>
<p>The vice president criticized the European Union’s regulatory
structure, in particular the privacy-focused General Data Protection
Regulation and the misinformation-focused Digital Services Act, and he
said the Trump administration will not accept foreign governments
“tightening the screws on U.S. tech companies with international
footprints.” </p>
<p>Vance also appeared to criticize the effort in Europe to replace
power generated by burning fossil fuels with more sustainable sources,
saying that countries are “chasing reliable power out of their nations”
at a time when AI systems demand ever-greater access to
electricity. </p>
<p>“The AI future is not going to be won by handwringing about safety,”
Vance said. “It will be won by building — from reliable power plants to
the manufacturing facilities that can produce the chips of the
future.” </p>
<p>While dozens of countries in attendance at the summit signed a joint
declaration on “building trustworthy data governance frameworks to
encourage development of innovative and privacy-protective AI,” the U.S.
and U.K. did not. </p>
<p>More calls for reduced regulation </p>
<p>Although not as dismissive of regulations and safety concerns as Vice
President Vance, other leaders at the summit appeared to agree that the
regulatory burden on companies in the AI field should be lightened. </p>
<p>French President Emmanuel Macron, the summit’s host, said that while
safety concerns are important, Europe also needs to make it easier for
AI firms there to move quickly and innovate at the same pace as other
countries. </p>
<p>“At the national and European scale, it is very clear that we have to
resynchronize with the rest of the world,” Macron said. </p>
<p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen defended the
bloc’s privacy regulations and other standards, pointing out that they
are meant to help businesses by creating rules that apply uniformly
across all 27 member countries. </p>
<p>“At the same time, I know that we have to make it easier, and we have
to cut red tape — and we will,” von der Leyen said. </p>
<p>Veiled China comments </p>
<p>Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing, who also attended the summit,
said Beijing is prepared to work with other countries to develop AI
technology, and it is willing to share its discoveries in the field with
the aim of creating “a community with a shared future for mankind.” </p>
<p>In his remarks on Tuesday, Vance did not mention China by name but
appeared to warn other nations against engaging in the kind of
collaboration that Zhang described. </p>
<p>Vance spoke of “hostile foreign adversaries” that “have weaponized AI
software to rewrite history, surveil users and censor speech” and
authoritarian regimes that have “stolen and used AI to strengthen their
military intelligence and surveillance capabilities to capture foreign
data and create propaganda to undermine other nations national
security.” </p>
<p>Partnering with authoritarian regimes, Vance said, “means chaining
your nation to an authoritarian master that seeks to infiltrate, dig in
and seize your information infrastructure.” </p>
<p>The remarks came at a time when the U.S. is taking wide-ranging
action to prevent China from gaining access to the most cutting-edge AI
technologies. Recent news reports revealing that a seemingly innovative
Chinese AI chatbot known as DeepSeek has been collecting user data and
storing it on insecure servers in China has led several nations to
restrict access to the service. </p>
<p>On Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Gou Jiakun said in a
press conference: “We take the safety and security of AI seriously, and
support entrepreneurial innovation by Chinese companies, thus
contributing China’s part to global AI development.” </p>
<p>“We have helped developing countries enhance capacity building,
advocating that AI technologies should be open-sourced and there should
be greater accessibility to AI services so that the benefits of AI can
be shared by all countries. That said, we are against drawing lines
along ideological difference, overstretching the concept of national
security, or politicizing trade and tech issues,” Gou said.  </p>
<p>Tech researchers concerned </p>
<p>Vance’s remarks about excessive AI safety concerns were in sync with
actions taken so far by the Trump administration. On the day he took
office, President Trump rescinded an executive order signed by his
predecessor entitled, “Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use
of Artificial Intelligence.” </p>
<p>Following Vance’s remarks Tuesday, U.S.-based artificial intelligence
researchers warned that a world in which the U.S. declines to require
companies to adopt AI safety precautions could make collaboration with
colleagues in countries with stronger protections difficult. </p>
<p>“In order to build effective AI, you have to source data globally, so
you have more accurate, complete and representative data sets,” Susan
Ariel Aaronson told VOA. She is a professor at George Washington
University and co-leader of the National Science Foundation’s
Trustworthy AI Institute for Law and Society. </p>
<p>“Many AI researchers believe we’re running out of data,” Aaronson
said. “The future for these firms, the future [for these] markets are
overseas, and so we need rules to govern how we interact with
policymakers and users in those markets.”  </p>
<p>Mona Sloane, a professor at the University of Virginia who leads an
AI research lab, told VOA that maintaining access to those data sets is
a prevailing concern. </p>
<p>“If you talk to people in the research community in the United
States, those folks are acutely worried about access to data sets, about
collaborating [internationally] on AI questions, or using AI in their
research,” she said. </p>
<p>“There will be very severe implications for research in the United
States on AI — but also with AI — by getting cut off from these
international conversations,” Sloane said.</p>

pauses enforcement, orders review of foreign corruption act</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has ordered a pause and review of
a law that has defined the activities of U.S. business overseas for
nearly five decades, claiming that the strict prohibitions against
bribing foreign officials strangle American competitiveness in a tough
global market.  </p>
<p>“It’s going to mean a lot more business for America,” Trump said as
he signed the order on Monday for the Department of Justice to pause
ongoing investigations and review the 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
for the next six months.  </p>
<p>The order argues that “overexpansive and unpredictable FCPA
enforcement against American citizens and businesses — by our own
Government — for routine business practices in other nations not only
wastes limited prosecutorial resources that could be dedicated to
preserving American freedoms, but actively harms American economic
competitiveness and, therefore, national security.” </p>
<p>But the latest annual review of the law’s enforcement by Stanford Law
School says the number of enforcement actions in 2024 were “well below
the ten-year average of 36,” with 26 cases that year filed by the two
entities responsible for enforcement — the DOJ and the Securities and
Exchange Commission.  </p>
<p>“This decline suggests that each bribery scheme yielded more unique
actions against a corporation and its subsidiaries, employees, and
agents, but that fewer separate schemes were targeted for enforcement in
2024,” the report concluded.  </p>
<p>The president’s order garnered criticism from anti-corruption
advocates.  </p>
<p>“The world must not default to where bribery and corruption are the
norm,” Gary Kalman, executive director of Transparency International
U.S., said in a statement to VOA. “A race to the bottom harms both the
citizens in the country and the businesses involved in corrupt
transactions. Those who do choose to flout the law often face multiple
bribery demands that delay or prevent these businesses from obtaining
the licenses and permits they need to enter overseas markets. In the
end, bribery is a lose-lose proposition.” </p>
<p>Bribery is still illegal  </p>
<p>Private legal experts rushed Tuesday to clarify the order’s scope and
significance.  </p>
<p>“Bribery is still Illegal,” according to the headline of the analysis
issued Tuesday morning by Washington-based multinational law firm Arnold
&amp; Porter. </p>
<p>The eight lawyer-authors go on to say in their analysis that not only
does bribery remain illegal under the law, which has not been repealed
by Congress, but also under various state, federal and foreign laws.
They also note that other countries have boosted their enforcement of
anti-corruption laws.  </p>
<p>“For now, we recommend that companies wait and see what will happen,
and meanwhile continue to focus on compliance,” the lawyers concluded.
 </p>
<p>Democratic Representative Jamie Raskin, a constitutional lawyer, said
Tuesday that the new order “puts America on the side of ‘routine’
corrupt business practices all over the world.” The order, he said,
gives corporations “free rein to pay bribes, kickbacks, and financial
tribute to corrupt foreign officials.” </p>
<p>His statement also took aim at Elon Musk, the billionaire businessman
whose closeness to Trump has put him at the head of efforts to radically
reshape the U.S. government and target waste, fraud and corruption
through his Department of Government Efficiency.  </p>
<p>“The Trump-Musk Administration is making bribery and corruption
perfectly legal again,” Raskin wrote in a statement. “The prices of eggs
and other groceries, housing and rent and electricity continue to soar,
but it just became a lot cheaper to engage in political corruption.”
 </p>
<p>Musk and his companies have tangled publicly with the SEC and the
Department of Commerce, but neither his name nor those of any of the
businesses he is associated with appears on either’s complete list of
FCPA enforcement actions.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
</p>
<p>
If President Donald Trump goes through with his plan to levy sweeping
tariffs on foreign imports, it wouldn’t be the first time the U.S. has
done such a thing. Ever heard of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930?
Anyone? Those tariffs are widely credited with sinking the United States
deeper into the Great Depression. And although global trade looks
different nowadays, they can teach us a lot about how Trump’s
protectionist approach to global trade could play out. On the show
today, Inu Manak, a fellow for trade policy at the Council on Foreign
Relations, explains how the Smoot-Hawley tariff debacle can shed light
on the current moment, why the president has the power to wield tariffs
in the first place, and how punishing trading partners could leave the
U.S. economy at a disadvantage. Plus, what this fight has to do with the
1980s film “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off” and Roomba vacuum cleaners!

id="trump-signs-executive-order-to-continue-downsizing-federal-workforce">Trump
signs executive order to continue downsizing federal workforce</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump made a rare appearance with Elon
Musk, his most powerful adviser, in the Oval Office on Tuesday before
signing an executive order to continue downsizing the federal
workforce.</p>
<p>The Associated Press reviewed a White House fact sheet on the order,
which is intended to advance Musk’s work slashing spending with his
Department of Government Efficiency.</p>
<p>Musk said there are some good people in the federal bureaucracy, but
they need to be accountable and called it an “unelected” fourth
branch.</p>
<p>“The people voted for major government reform, and that’s what the
people are going to get,” he said. “That’s what democracy is all
about.”</p>
<p>It was Musk’s first time taking questions from reporters since he
joined the Trump administration as a special government employee with
sprawling influence over federal agencies. He’s also the world’s richest
person and the owner of X, the social media platform formerly known as
Twitter.</p>
<p>Despite concerns that he’s amassing unaccountable power with little
transparency, Musk described himself as an open book. He joked that the
scrutiny was like a “daily proctology exam.”</p>
<p>The White House fact sheet said that “agencies will undertake plans
for large-scale reductions in force and determine which agency
components (or agencies themselves) may be eliminated or combined
because their functions aren’t required by law.”</p>
<p>It also said that agencies should “hire no more than one employee for
every four employees that depart from federal service.” There are plans
for exceptions when it comes to immigration, law enforcement and public
safety.</p>
<p>Trump and Musk are pushing federal workers to resign in return for
financial incentives, although their plan is currently on hold while a
judge reviews its legality. The deferred resignation program, commonly
described as a buyout, would allow employees to quit and still get paid
until Sept. 30. Administration officials said more than 65,000 workers
have taken the offer.</p>
<p>Hundreds of people gathered for a rally Tuesday across the street
from the U.S. Capitol in support of federal workers.</p>
<p>Janet Connelly, a graphic designer with the Department of Energy,
said she’s fed up with emails from the Office of Personnel Management
encouraging people to take the deferred resignation program.</p>
<p>She tried to use her spam settings to filter out the emails but to no
avail. Connelly said she has no plans to take the offer.</p>
<p>“From the get-go, I didn’t trust it,” she said.</p>
<p>Connelly said she thinks of her work as trying to do an important
service for the American public.</p>
<p>“It’s too easy to vilify us,” she said.</p>
<p>Others have said fear and uncertainty have swept through the federal
workforce.</p>
<p>“They’re worried about their jobs. They’re worried about their
families. They’re also worried about their work and the communities they
serve,” said Helen Bottcher, a former Environmental Protection Agency
employee and current union leader in Seattle.</p>
<p>Bottcher participated in a press conference hosted by Senator Patty
Murray, a Democrat from Washington.</p>
<p>Murray said workers “deserve better than to be threatened,
intimidated and pushed out the door by Elon Musk and Donald Trump.” She
also said that “we actually need these people to stay in their jobs or
things are going to start breaking.”</p>

withdrawal from UN human rights body draws mixed reactions</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Human rights experts in Washington are divided over
whether the U.S. withdrawal from a United Nations body on human rights
will hurt North Korea’s already poor human rights situation.</p>
<p>Last Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order
pulling the U.S. out of the U.N. Human Rights Council, or UNHRC,
reintroducing the stance he held during his previous term.</p>
<p>The executive order said that the UNHRC has “protected human rights
abusers by allowing them to use the organization to shield themselves
from scrutiny,” adding that the council deserves “renewed scrutiny.”</p>
<p>The decision was announced ahead of Trump’s recent meeting with
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who visited Washington for
the first time since Trump’s second inauguration.</p>
<p>Since his first term, President Trump has been disapproving of the
activities of the U.N. human rights body. In June 2018, the Trump
administration criticized the UNHRC for its “bias against Israel,”
stressing the council that year passed resolutions against Israel more
than those passed against North Korea, Iran and Syria combined.</p>
<p>Negative impact</p>
<p>Robert King, who served as the U.S. special envoy for North Korea’s
human rights under the Obama administration, said that the U.S. decision
to withdraw from the U.N. Human Rights Council could negatively
undermine international efforts to improve human rights conditions in
the North.</p>
<p>“It will have a negative impact. The U.N. Human Rights Council has
been a very effective body in terms of calling attention to North
Korea’s serious human rights abuses,” King told VOA Korean on the phone
last week. “And the fact that the United States will not be an active
participant is again a very unfortunate situation.”</p>
<p>Roberta Cohen, former deputy assistant secretary of state for human
rights, said leaving the UNHRC is “a short-sighted decision.”</p>
<p>Cohen, who also served as senior adviser to the U.S. Delegation to
the U.N. Commission on Human Rights and the General Assembly, said it is
important that the U.S. be seated at the council with a vote and be
active in mobilizing support for any new initiatives.</p>
<p>“If the reforms are needed and they are, the U.S. should be involved
heavily,” Cohen told VOA Korean by phone last week. “Walking away cedes
the floor to your opponents.”</p>
<p>Cohen highlighted that the council was where the Commission of
Inquiry on the Human Rights in North Korea, or COI, was conceived. The
COI is widely considered to be the first systematic and thorough
documentation of Pyongyang’s violations of human rights.</p>
<p>She added that an update of the COI is to be presented in September
for the first time in more than a decade, saying that Washington needs
to be part of the process when the report is introduced.</p>
<p>However, others question the role of the Human Rights Council in
making a real impact on improving North Korea’s human rights
conditions.</p>
<p>“The Human Rights Council has become a very tragic farce. It was
supposed to promote and protect human rights around the world but
instead it coddles dictatorships and gives them legitimacy by including
them as members of the council,” said Suzanne Scholte, president of the
Defense Forum Foundation and a longtime North Korea human rights
activist. “We’re not addressing the horrific things that are happening
to the North Korean refugees in China that are being shot and executed
when they’re returned.”</p>
<p>‘Illegitimate’ members</p>
<p>Human rights experts have long criticized Beijing for failing to
afford protection to North Korean refugees and forcefully repatriating
them to North Korea.</p>
<p>David Maxwell, vice president of the Center for Asia Pacific Strategy
in Washington, said North Korean human rights issues need to be
separated from how Trump wants to deal with the United Nations.</p>
<p>“This is about the Trump administration’s views toward U.N.
organizations and how they are being misused by countries such as China,
Russia, Iran and North Korea,” Maxwell told VOA Korean on Monday via
email. “When these organizations are coerced by members of the so-called
axis of upheaval, they are not able to support the people who are
suffering true human rights abuses.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Andrew Yeo, a senior fellow and the SK-Korea Foundation
chair at the Brookings Institution’s Center for Asia Policy Studies in
Washington, said the U.S. has other tools to address the North Korean
human rights issue.</p>
<p>“Pulling out of the UNHRC won’t make much of a difference practically
speaking,” Yeo told VOA Korean via email last week. “The U.S. has other
means and platforms to raise North Korean human rights objections,
including its own State Department human rights reports.”</p>
<p>The U.S. rejoined the UNHRC shortly after the inauguration of Joe
Biden as president in 2021, but the Biden administration decided not to
seek a second term as a board member of the council when the three-year
membership was to expire at the end of 2024.</p>
<p>The move was made amid the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas,
which launched a surprise attack on the former a year prior. The State
Department explained at the time that the U.S. decided not to pursue a
second term at the council “because we are engaged with our allies about
the best way to move forward.”</p>
<p>Every March or April, the State Department releases the annual Human
Rights Reports, which cover the human rights situations around the
world. The document last year said there were credible reports of
unlawful killing, enforced disappearances and torture taking place in
North Korea.</p>

<h2 id="vance-tells-europeans-that-heavy-regulation-could-kill-ai">Vance
tells Europeans that heavy regulation could kill AI</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Paris — U.S. Vice President JD Vance told Europeans on Tuesday their
“massive” regulations on artificial intelligence could strangle the
technology, and rejected content moderation as “authoritarian
censorship.”</p>
<p>The mood on AI has shifted as the technology takes root, from one of
concerns around safety to geopolitical competition, as countries jockey
to nurture the next big AI giant.</p>
<p>Vance, setting out the Trump administration’s America First agenda,
said the United States intended to remain the dominant force in AI and
strongly opposed the European Union’s far tougher regulatory
approach.</p>
<p>“We believe that excessive regulation of the AI sector could kill a
transformative industry,” Vance told an AI summit of CEOs and heads of
state in Paris.</p>
<p>“We feel very strongly that AI must remain free from ideological bias
and that American AI will not be co-opted into a tool for authoritarian
censorship,” he added.</p>
<p>Vance criticized the “massive regulations” created by the EU’s
Digital Services Act, as well as Europe’s online privacy rules, known by
the acronym GDPR, which he said meant endless legal compliance costs for
smaller firms.</p>
<p>“Of course, we want to ensure the internet is a safe place, but it is
one thing to prevent a predator from preying on a child on the internet,
and it is something quite different to prevent a grown man or woman from
accessing an opinion that the government thinks is misinformation,” he
said.</p>
<p>European lawmakers last year approved the bloc’s AI Act, the world’s
first comprehensive set of rules governing the technology.</p>
<p>Vance is leading the American delegation at the Paris summit.</p>
<p>Vance also appeared to take aim at China at a delicate moment for the
U.S. technology sector.</p>
<p>Last month, Chinese startup DeepSeek freely distributed a powerful AI
reasoning model that some said challenged U.S. technology leadership. It
sent shares of American chip designer Nvidia down 17%.</p>
<p>“From CCTV to 5G equipment, we’re all familiar with cheap tech in the
marketplace that’s been heavily subsidized and exported by authoritarian
regimes,” Vance said.</p>
<p>But he said that “partnering with them means chaining your nation to
an authoritarian master that seeks to infiltrate, dig in and seize your
information infrastructure. Should a deal seem too good to be true? Just
remember the old adage that we learned in Silicon Valley: if you aren’t
paying for the product, you are the product.”</p>
<p>Vance did not mention DeepSeek by name. There has been no evidence of
information being able to surreptitiously flow through the startup’s
technology to China’s government, and the underlying code is freely
available to use and view. However, some government organizations have
reportedly banned DeepSeek’s use.</p>
<p>Speaking after Vance, French President Emmanuel Macron said that he
was fully in favor of trimming red tape, but he stressed that regulation
was still needed to ensure trust in AI, or people would end up rejecting
it. “We need a trustworthy AI,” he said.</p>
<p>European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen also said the EU would
cut red tape and invest more in AI.</p>
<p>In a bilateral meeting, Vance and von der Leyen were also likely to
discuss Trump’s substantial increase of tariffs on steel.</p>
<p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was expected to address the summit on Tuesday.
A consortium led by Musk said on Monday it had offered $97.4 billion to
buy the nonprofit controlling OpenAI.</p>
<p>Altman promptly posted on X: “no thank you but we will buy twitter
for $9.74 billion if you want.”</p>
<p>The technology world has closely watched whether the Trump
administration will ease recent antitrust enforcement that had seen the
U.S. sue or investigate the industry’s biggest players.</p>
<p>Vance said the U.S. would champion American AI – which big players
develop – he also said: “Our laws will keep Big Tech, little tech, and
all other developers on a level playing field.”</p>

id="modi-to-meet-trump-with-focus-on-trade-immigration-and-strategic-ties">Modi
to meet Trump with focus on trade, immigration and strategic ties</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New Delhi — As Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi heads to the
United States for a two-day visit starting Wednesday, officials in New
Delhi expressed optimism that the visit will herald a renewed and
substantive partnership. However analysts said there will be contentious
issues to navigate on trade and immigration, which are among U.S.
President Donald Trump’s top priorities.</p>
<p>Underlining that Modi will be meeting Trump within weeks of his
taking office, Indian foreign secretary Vikram Misri said India-U.S.
ties are solid and that “this has been one of our strongest
international partnerships.”</p>
<p>Modi will reach Washington after visiting France, where he is
attending a global conference on artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Trade is important for both countries and India has taken steps to
demonstrate that it is ready to address concerns of Trump, who has named
India among countries that are “very big tariff abusers.” In a phone
conversation with Modi last month, Trump called for moving toward a fair
bilateral trading relationship.</p>
<p>His top economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, repeated such concerns on
Monday. “India has enormously high” tariffs that lock out imports, he
said in an interview with CNBC.</p>
<p>New Delhi, which wants to avoid trade tensions with the U.S.,
announced earlier this month that it will lower import duties on some
items that will benefit American exports such as high-end motorcycles
and cars.</p>
<p>It also may offer other concessions that could help American goods
gain market access to India and boost energy imports from the U.S., say
analysts.</p>
<p>“New Delhi thought it would take a first step and try to resolve
differences on trade. But, certainly, as a great negotiator and
bargainer, he [Trump] will ask for more,” said Chintamani Mahapatra,
founder of the Kalinga School of Indo Pacific Studies. “India also
bargains very well. So, somehow, we will try to make a compromise that
will benefit both.”</p>
<p>For India, the stakes are high — the U.S. is its largest trading
partner. Bilateral trade between the two countries was $118 billion,
with a surplus of about $32 billion in India’s favor in 2023.</p>
<p>India has not been impacted so far by Trump’s tariff impositions —
the latest 25 percent tariffs he imposed on steel and aluminum imports
will have merely a marginal impact on India, as New Delhi is a small
exporter of steel to the U.S., according to Indian officials.</p>
<p>Strengthening security and defense ties with the U.S., Indian
officials say will also be discussed in Washington. According to
analysts that could include potential purchases of weapon systems and
technology. In the recent phone conversation with Modi, President Trump
had called on Modi to increase procurement of American-made security
equipment.</p>
<p>India, the world’s largest spender on military equipment, needs a
range of weapons systems to modernize its military. As it diversifies
its purchases from its traditional weapons supplier, Russia, India has
been purchasing more arms from countries like France, Israel and the
United States.</p>
<p>“The U.S. is a little concerned that it is losing out on the India
[security] buys, so it has stepped up pressure to sell India a lot more
defense equipment than India has bought in the last few years,”
according to Rahul Bedi, defense analyst in New Delhi. “There is likely
to be initiatives on transport aircraft, surveillance aircraft for the
navy, and possibly even fighter aircraft, as well as a lot of technology
transfers for aircraft engines, infantry combat vehicles.”</p>
<p>Immigration is another issue of concern to both countries. Although
India has cooperated with the U.S. and said it is ready to take back
undocumented migrants, reports of 104 undocumented Indians being
shackled for 40 hours while being brought back to India on a military
plane last week from the U.S. led to an uproar and protests by
opposition parties.</p>
<p>Indian officials have said that New Delhi will call for better
treatment during future deportations.</p>
<p>At the same time, India’s top priority during discussions will be to
protect legal channels of immigration for skilled Indian workers and
students heading to American universities. Indians are the largest
beneficiaries of H1B visas, which allow U.S. employers to hire foreign
professionals in specialized fields, such as technology.</p>
<p>“People-to-people relationships constitute the bedrock of our
deepening ties with the United States,” Indian foreign minister,
Subrahmanyam Jaishankar told lawmakers, while responding to concerns
about the transport and treatment of the deportees.</p>
<p>In a statement before leaving New Delhi, Modi called his upcoming
meeting with Trump an opportunity to build upon the successes of their
collaboration in Trump’s first term.</p>
<p>Mutual concerns about an assertive China are likely to keep the two
countries aligned, according to analysts. Along with the U.S., Australia
and Japan, India is a partner in the Quad, a strategic security grouping
focused on the Indo-Pacific. Analysts point out that the two countries
have convergence on geostrategic issues.</p>
<p>“It was president Trump in his first term, who dusted off the Quad,
which was in a dormant state for about ten years, and he was solely
responsible for reviving it,” said Mahapatra. “This is an area where
both the countries have a lot of things in common for maintaining peace,
stability and contributing to the growth story in the Indo-Pacific
region.”</p>

id="virginia-governor-declares-storm-emergency-as-snow-and-ice-bear-down-on-mid-atlantic-states">Virginia
governor declares storm emergency as snow and ice bear down on
mid-Atlantic states</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A wintry mess was bearing down on mid-Atlantic states Tuesday with
forecasts of significant snow and ice accumulations prompting warnings
of potential power outages.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service said travel would become treacherous
Tuesday through early Wednesday in much of Virginia and West
Virginia.</p>
<p>Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin on Monday declared a state of
emergency ahead of the storm, allowing state agencies to assist local
governments. Schools and government offices throughout Virginia were set
to be closed Tuesday.</p>
<p>The heaviest snow, up to 25.4 centimeters, was forecast in portions
of northern and central Virginia and eastern West Virginia. Ice
accumulations could range from a glaze in Kentucky and West Virginia to
1.3 centimeters in the Roanoke Valley of southwest Virginia, the weather
service said. Power outages and tree damage were likely in places with
heavy ice buildups.</p>
<p>“Did you think winter was over? Think again!” the weather service’s
office in Blacksburg, Virginia, said in a post on the social media
platform X.</p>
<p>Appalachian Power, which serves 1 million customers in West Virginia,
Virginia and Tennessee, said it has requested 700 additional workers
from neighboring utilities to assist with problems by Tuesday
morning.</p>
<p>In northern Virginia, the National Park Service closed a portion of
the George Washington Memorial Parkway, a narrow highway that winds its
way through woods along the Potomac River. The parkway connects multiple
small national park sites and has historically been a trouble spot
during winter storms for abandoned cars that created a slalom course for
snowplows and other vehicles.</p>
<p>Winter storm warnings extended from Kentucky to southern New Jersey,
and a flood watch was posted for a wide swath of Kentucky, Tennessee,
southwest Virginia and northern Georgia. The snow-and-ice mix was
expected to become all rain as temperatures climb by Wednesday
afternoon.</p>
<p>A separate storm system is set to bring heavy snow from Kansas and
Missouri to the Great Lakes on Wednesday, the weather service said.</p>
<p>Dangerous cold was forecast Tuesday from an Arctic air mass
stretching from Portland, Oregon, to the Great Lakes.</p>
<p>The temperature was expected to bottom out Tuesday morning at minus
36 degrees Celsius in Butte, Montana, where over the past two winters at
least five people died due to cold exposure, said Brayton Erickson,
executive director of the Butte Rescue Mission. Advocates for the

jets collide at Scottsdale Airport in Arizona, killing 1 person,
authorities say</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. — One person was killed and others were injured
when a private jet owned by Mötley Crüe singer Vince Neil collided with
another jet Monday afternoon at the Scottsdale Airport in Arizona,
authorities said.</p>
<p>Neil’s jet was landing at the airport when it veered off the runway
and collided with another parked plane, Neil’s representative Worrick
Robinson, IV, said in a statement. There were two pilots and two
passengers on Neil’s plane, but he was not among them.</p>
<p>“Mr. Neil’s thoughts and prayers go out to everyone involved, and he
is grateful for the critical aid of all first responders assisting
today,” Robinson said.</p>
<p>The arriving jet veered off the runway and collided with the
Gulfstream 200 jet that was parked, according to Kelli Kuester, aviation
planning and outreach coordinator at the Scottsdale Airport. It appeared
that the primary landing gear of the arriving jet failed, resulting in
the collision, she said.</p>
<p>Kuester said four people were on the arriving jet, which had come
from Austin, Texas, and one person was in the parked plane.</p>
<p>Two people injured in the collision were taken to trauma centers and
one was in stable condition at a hospital, Scottsdale Fire Department
Capt. Dave Folio said. He said they were working to recover the body of
the person killed in the collision.</p>
<p>“Our thoughts and prayers go out to everybody involved in this,”
Folio said.</p>
<p>The runway has been closed and will remain closed “for the
foreseeable future,” Kuester said.</p>
<p>Scottsdale Mayor Lisa Borowsky said in a statement that she is
closely monitoring the situation and is in touch with the airport,
police and federal agencies.</p>
<p>“On behalf of the city of Scottsdale, we offer our deepest
condolences to those involved in the accident and for those who have
been taken to our trauma center for treatment,” she said. “We will keep
all affected by this tragedy in our prayers.”</p>
<p>The airport is a popular hub for jets coming in and out of the
Phoenix area, especially during big sports weekends like the Waste
Management Phoenix Open golf tournament, which attracts huge crowds just
a few miles away.</p>
<p>The Scottsdale collision comes after three major U.S. aviation
disasters in the past two weeks. </p>
<p>A commercial jetliner and an Army helicopter collided near the
nation’s capital on Jan. 29, killing 67 people. A medical transportation
plane crashed in Philadelphia on Jan. 31, killing the six people on
board and another person on the ground. And last week a small commuter
plane crashed in western Alaska on its way to the hub community of Nome,
killing all 10 people on board.</p>

<p>date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday announced a 25% tariff on
aluminum and steel tariffs that could hit Canada and Mexico, the top two
exporters to the U.S., the hardest. Trump’s ongoing trade offensive also
provoked chiding from the U.S.’ top competitor, China. VOA correspondent

id="back-to-plastic-trump-announces-us-policy-to-end-the-use-of-paper-straws">Back
to plastic: Trump announces US policy ‘to end the use of paper
straws’</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>President Donald Trump issued an executive order Monday declaring
that it is “the policy of the United States to end the use of paper
straws.”</p>
<p>Former President Joe Biden’s administration, in an attempt to phase
out federal purchases of single-use plastics, announced a plan in July
2024 to replace plastics with reusable, compostable and highly
recyclable products.</p>
<p>Trump’s order Monday stated that paper straws “are nonfunctional, use
chemicals that may carry risks to human health, are more expensive to
produce than plastic straws, and often force users to use multiple
straws.”</p>
<p>He also noted that paper straws are often individually wrapped in
plastic, which undermines the environmental argument for their use.</p>
<p>“It’s a ridiculous situation. We’re going back to plastic straws,”
Trump said Monday as he signed the order.</p>
<p>The Biden policy aimed to get plastic straws and other single-use
plastics out of federal food service operations, events and packaging by
2027, and from all federal operations by 2035.</p>
<p>Trump declared President Joe Biden’s policy “DEAD!” in a social media
post over the weekend.</p>
<p>In his Monday order, he instructed agency officials to stop buying
paper straws and make sure paper straws are no longer provided within
agency buildings.</p>
<p>He also directed officials to create a national strategy to end the
use of paper straws within 45 days.</p>

<h2 id="trump-imposes-25-tariffs-on-steel-aluminum-imports-1">Trump
imposes 25% tariffs on steel, aluminum imports</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>White House — President Donald Trump on Monday fired another volley
in his ongoing trade war, announcing 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum
imports and canceling exemptions and duty-free quotas for major
suppliers.</p>
<p>“It’s a big deal,” Trump said, the thick black marker in his right
hand hovering over the executive order.</p>
<p>“This is the beginning of making America rich again,” he said,
dragging his distinctive jagged signature over the paper.</p>
<p>Billionaire financier Howard Lutnick, Trump’s nominee to lead the
Commerce Department, watched from over Trump’s left shoulder in the Oval
Office. Trump’s trade adviser said this move will help domestic
producers and support U.S. economic and national security. Lutnick spoke
of the 120,000 jobs this could bring back.</p>
<p>“You are the president who is standing up for the American
steelworker, and I am just tremendously impressed and delighted to stand
next to you,” Lutnick said.</p>
<p>The nuts and bolts</p>
<p>Trump’s proclamations raised the rate on aluminum imports to 25% from
the previous 10% that he imposed in 2018 to aid the struggling sector.
And he restored a 25% tariff on millions of tons of steel and aluminum
imports.</p>
<p>Trump’s actions also will impose a new North American standard
requiring steel imports to be “melted and poured” and aluminum to be
“smelted and cast” in the region to curb imports of minimally processed
Chinese steel.</p>
<p>The order also targets downstream steel products that use imported
steel for tariffs.</p>
<p>Trump’s trade adviser, Peter Navarro, said the measures would help
U.S. steel and aluminum producers and shore up America’s economic and
national security.</p>
<p>“The steel and aluminum tariffs 2.0 will put an end to foreign
dumping, boost domestic production and secure our steel and aluminum
industries as the backbone and pillar industries of America’s economic
and national security,” he told reporters.</p>
<p>“This isn’t just about trade. It’s about ensuring that America never
has to rely on foreign nations for critical industries like steel and
aluminum,” Navarro said.</p>
<p>What now?</p>
<p>Trump first broached the steel and aluminum action Sunday — and the
move drew instant pushback in what is unfolding as a tit-for-tat
exchange.</p>
<p>Earlier Monday, Beijing enacted additional tariffs on U.S. goods as a
countermeasure to Trump’s earlier 10% hike on Chinese goods.</p>
<p>“There are no winners in trade wars and tariff wars,” said Guo
Jiakun, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. “They
harm the interests of the people of both countries. What is needed now
is not unilateral tariff increases but equal dialogue and consultation
based on mutual respect. We urge the U.S. to correct its wrong practices
and stop politicizing and instrumentalizing economic and trade
issues.”</p>
<p>Most economists believe tariffs raise consumer prices. Scholars of
supply chains and logistics say Trump’s move also raises major global
policy questions.</p>
<p>“It’s not clear whether this is a negotiating strategy, whether this
is going to be permanent,” said Professor Sunderesh Heragu of Oklahoma
State University. “Is this only restricted to Canada, Mexico and China
as it is now, or is it going to expand to the European Union, for
example, or even the BRICS countries, of which, you know, Brazil,
Russia, India, China, South Africa and 12 or 14 other countries, are
part of?”</p>
<p>He said these concerns may prompt countries to realign their trade
relationships, which will likely alarm producers.</p>
<p>“It clearly causes a lot of confusion, and you know, businesses,
again, hate uncertainty,” Heragu said. “So, they’re going to put
everything on pause. That means, you know, there could be a decrease in
production activity, while at the same time, the tariffs could have
inflationary effects.”</p>
<p>Some in the automotive industry in Detroit, the U.S.’ “Motor City,”
echoed that concern.</p>
<p>“Sudden tariffs to a system — there isn’t a lot of good that comes
out of that,” said Glenn Stevens Jr., executive director of MichAuto and
vice president of automotive and mobility initiatives at the Detroit
Regional Chamber.</p>
<p>Studies attempting to understand the impact of these moves yield
mixed pictures. The Washington, D.C.-based Tax Foundation estimates that
the tariffs will generate around $100 billion each year in federal tax
revenue.</p>
<p>Another analysis shows they could “impose significant costs on the
broader economy: disrupting supply chains, raising costs for businesses,
eliminating hundreds of thousands of jobs and ultimately driving up
consumer prices.”</p>

<h2 id="hamas-threatens-to-delay-hostage-release">Hamas threatens to
delay hostage release</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Hamas officials accused Israel of violating a ceasefire agreement
Monday and threatened to delay releasing more hostages, prompting U.S.
President Donald Trump to say “all hell is going to break out” if all
the remaining hostages are not turned over by Saturday.</p>
<p>The next exchange was set for Saturday, with three more Israelis set
to be freed in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners jailed by
Israel.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Hamas’ armed wing, the al-Qassam Brigades, said in
a statement the militants remain committed to the ceasefire terms “as
long as the occupation adheres to them.”</p>
<p>Hamas accused Israel of delaying the return of displaced Palestinians
to northern Gaza, although hundreds of thousands have returned. The
group said Palestinians were targeted “with airstrikes and gunfire
across various areas” and Israel has failed “to facilitate the entry of
humanitarian aid as agreed.”</p>
<p>However, a United Nations official said 12,600 humanitarian aid
trucks have entered Gaza since the ceasefire began and the immediate
threat of famine has dissipated.</p>
<p>Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said any delay by Hamas would be
“a complete violation” of the ceasefire agreement. He placed the Israeli
military on the highest level of alert.</p>
<p>In Washington Monday, Trump said he would propose canceling the
ceasefire agreement if all the remaining hostages being held in Gaza
were not released by 12 o’clock Saturday, but he did not specify whether
that was noon or midnight, and he did not indicate a time zone. </p>
<p>He also said he might withhold aid to Jordan and Egypt if they don’t
take Palestinian refugees being relocated from Gaza.</p>
<p>Since the ceasefire took effect last month, Hamas has freed 21
hostages while Israel has released more than 730 prisoners.</p>
<p>Trump has proposed moving Palestinians living in Gaza to an
unspecified location outside the territory. Under his plan for the
enclave, they would have no right to return.</p>
<p>In an interview with Fox News released Monday, he called his plan for
the narrow territory along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea a “real
estate development for the future.”</p>
<p>“I would own it,” he said, adding that the 2.3 million Palestinians
now living in war-ravaged Gaza would be moved to as many as six
different sites outside Gaza under a plan that the Arab world, as well
as U.S. allies and adversaries alike, have already rejected.</p>
<p>Trump, a billionaire New York real estate magnate before entering
politics in 2015, did not say where the Palestinians would be relocated.
But when asked by Fox anchor Bret Baier if they would be allowed to
return home to Gaza, Trump said, “No, they wouldn’t, because they’re
going to have much better housing.”</p>
<p>“In other words, I’m talking about building a permanent place for
them because if they have to return now, it’ll be years before you could
ever — it’s not habitable,” Trump said of Gaza, decimated by 15 months
of fighting between Israel and Hamas.</p>
<p>In the Fox interview, Trump said he would build “beautiful
communities” for the Palestinians.</p>
<p>“Could be five, six, could be two. But we’ll build safe communities,
a little bit away from where they are, where all of this danger is,”
Trump said.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Israeli troops withdrew from the Netzarim corridor, a
narrow strip of land that bisects the territory. It allowed more
Palestinians to return to the northern sector where they once lived, but
much of the land has been leveled by fighting.</p>
<p>Hamas spokesperson Abdel Latif Al-Qanoua said the withdrawal showed
Hamas had “forced the enemy to submit to our demands” and that it
thwarted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s “Illusion of
achieving total victory.”</p>
<p>Israeli officials did not disclose how many soldiers withdrew or to
where. Troops currently remain along Gaza’s borders with Israel and
Egypt and a full withdrawal is expected to be negotiated in a later
stage of the initial 42-day ceasefire.</p>
<p>During the first six-week phase of the ceasefire, Hamas is gradually
releasing 33 Israeli hostages captured during its Oct. 7, 2023, attack
on Israel in exchange for a pause in fighting, freedom for hundreds of
Palestinian prisoners and a flood of humanitarian aid into Gaza. The
deal also stipulated that Israeli troops would pull back from populated
areas of Gaza as well as the Netzarim corridor.</p>
<p>In the second phase, all remaining living hostages would be released
in return for a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a “sustainable
calm.” But details are unclear and yet to be negotiated.</p>
<p>The war in Gaza was triggered by the shock October 2023 Hamas terror
attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of 250
hostages. Israel’s counteroffensive killed more than 47,000
Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to
local health authorities. Israel says the death toll includes 17,000
militants it has killed.</p>

<p>The Justice Department on Monday directed federal prosecutors in New
York to drop corruption charges against New York Mayor Eric Adams,
according to a memo from acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove.</p>
<p>Bove, a political appointee of President Donald Trump, intervened in
the case, saying the indictment of Adams interfered with his 2025
mayoral reelection campaign.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney’s office in Manhattan, which
brought the charges, declined to comment.</p>
<p>Prosecutors have not yet indicated to the judge overseeing the case,
U.S. District Judge Dale Ho in Manhattan, that they plan to drop the
case, court records showed Monday evening.</p>
<p>Adams was the subject of a five-count indictment charging him with
accepting travel perks from Turkish officials and political donations
from foreigners in exchange for taking actions to benefit Turkey.</p>
<p>Adams pleaded not guilty.</p>

id="musk-led-group-makes-97.4-billion-bid-for-control-of-openai">Musk-led
group makes $97.4 billion bid for control of OpenAI</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A consortium led by Elon Musk said Monday it has offered $97.4
billion to buy the nonprofit that controls OpenAI, another salvo in the
billionaire’s fight to block the artificial intelligence startup from
transitioning to a for-profit firm.</p>
<p>Musk’s bid is likely to ratchet up longstanding tensions with OpenAI
CEO Sam Altman over the future of the startup at the heart of a boom in
generative AI technology. Altman on Monday promptly posted on X: “no
thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74 billion if you want.”</p>
<p>Musk cofounded OpenAI with Altman in 2015 as a nonprofit, but left
before the company took off. He founded the competing AI startup xAI in
2023.</p>
<p>Musk, the CEO of Tesla and owner of tech and social media company X,
is a close ally of President Donald Trump. He spent more than a quarter
of a billion dollars to help elect Trump, and leads the Department of
Government Efficiency, a new arm of the White House tasked with
radically shrinking the federal bureaucracy. Musk recently criticized a
$500 billion OpenAI-led project announced by Trump at the White
House.</p>
<p>OpenAI is now trying to transition into a for-profit from a nonprofit
entity, which it says is required to secure the capital needed for
developing the best AI models.</p>
<p>Musk sued Altman and others in August last year, claiming they
violated contract provisions by putting profit ahead of the public good
in the push to advance AI. In November, he asked a U.S. district judge
for a preliminary injunction blocking OpenAI from converting to a
for-profit structure.</p>
<p>Musk’s lawsuit against OpenAI and Altman says the founders originally
approached him to fund a nonprofit focused on developing AI to benefit
humanity, but that it was now focused on making money.</p>
<p>“It’s time for OpenAI to return to the open-source, safety-focused
force for good it once was,” Musk said in a statement Monday. “We will
make sure that happens.”</p>
<p>Musk and OpenAI backer Microsoft did not immediately respond to
requests for comment.</p>
<p>“Musk’s bid puts another wrinkle into OpenAI’s quest to remove the
nonprofit’s control over its for-profit entity,” said Rose Chan Loui,
executive director of the UCLA Law Center for Philanthropy and
Nonprofits.</p>
<p>“This bid sets a marker for the valuation of the nonprofit’s economic
interests,” she said. “If OpenAI values the nonprofit’s interests at
less than what Musk is offering, then they would have to show why.”</p>
<p>The consortium led by Musk includes his AI startup xAI, Baron Capital
Group, Valor Management, Atreides Management, Vy Fund III, Emanuel
Capital Management, and Eight Partners.</p>
<p>XAI could merge with OpenAI following a deal, according to The Wall
Street Journal which first reported Musk’s offer earlier Monday. XAI
recently raised $6 billion from investors at a valuation of $40 billion,
sources have told Reuters.</p>
<p>Throwing a wrench</p>
<p>“This (bid) is definitely throwing a wrench in things,” said Jonathan
Macey, a Yale Law School professor specializing in corporate
governance.</p>
<p>“The nonprofit is supposed to take money to do whatever good deeds,
and if OpenAI prefers to sell it to somebody else for less money, it’s a
concern for protecting the interests of the beneficiaries of the
not-for-profit. If this was a public company, plaintiffs’ lawyers would
justifiably be lining up down the block to sue that transaction.”</p>
<p>OpenAI was valued at $157 billion in its last funding round,
cementing its status as one of the most valuable private companies in
the world. SoftBank Group is in talks to lead a funding round of up to
$40 billion in OpenAI at a valuation of $300 billion, including the new
funds, Reuters reported in January.</p>
<p>Aside from any antitrust implications, a deal this size would need
Musk and his consortium to raise enormous funds.</p>
<p>“Musk’s offer to buy OpenAI’s nonprofit should significantly
complicate OpenAI’s current fundraising and the process of converting
into a for-profit corporation,” said Gil Luria, analyst at D.A.
Davidson.</p>
<p>“The offer seems to be backed by more credible investors … OpenAI may
not be able to ignore it. It will be the fiduciary responsibility of
OpenAI’s board to decide whether this is a better offer, which could
call into question the offer from SoftBank.”</p>
<p>Musk’s stock in Tesla is valued at roughly $165 billion, according to
LSEG data, but his leverage with banks is likely to be thin after his
$44 billion buyout of the social media platform that was called Twitter
in 2022.</p>

id="facing-backlash-over-500k-salary-las-wildfire-recovery-czar-agrees-to-work-for-free">Facing
backlash over $500K salary, LA’s wildfire recovery czar agrees to work
for free</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — Steve Soboroff, a longtime fixture in Los Angeles civic
life who is now serving as chief recovery officer for the city’s
wildfire comeback, won’t take a salary after facing backlash over plans
to pay him $500,000. He would have been paid through charitable
donations, not with taxpayer money.</p>
<p>Soboroff had defended the proposed salary of half-a-million dollars
for three months of work, saying his expertise as a residential property
developer made him worth the price. But after criticisms mounted from
elected officials and residents, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass reversed
course over the weekend and said Soboroff would receive no compensation.
Soboroff is the city’s former police commissioner.</p>
<p>“Steve is always there for LA. I spoke to him today and asked him to
modify his agreement and work for free. He said yes. We agree that we
don’t need anything distracting from the recovery work we’re doing,”
Bass said in a statement Saturday. She had named him to the recovery
czar position on Jan. 17.</p>
<p>A message seeking comment was left for Soboroff on Monday.</p>
<p>Soboroff, 76, raised his family in the Pacific Palisades area, where
nearly 7,000 homes were destroyed by last month’s inferno. His son, NBC
News journalist Jacob Soboroff, reported from the devastated
neighborhood where he grew up.</p>
<p>He was initially tasked with leading the first phase of the city’s
wildfire rebuilding effort. On Friday though, Bass suggested that the
scope of his work could be diminished, saying he would focus primarily
on rebuilding the Palisades’ historic business district.</p>
<p>Soboroff disputed that notion, saying he is regularly interacting
with federal agencies.</p>
<p>In addition to developing thousands of homes over decades, Soboroff
served on the city’s Board of Police Commissioners and on the city
commission that oversees the Department of Recreation and Parks — both
volunteer positions.</p>
<p>Before the salary reversal, he told the Los Angeles Times that he put
aside other real estate and environmental consulting work to take on the
role of the city’s recovery officer.</p>
<p>“I’ve been doing this for 35 years for free on some of the biggest
civic projects for the city of Los Angeles. But nobody ever asked me to
drop everything. This time they did,” Soboroff said. “And I said OK,
under the condition that my pay not be taken out of city money, or from
any wildfire survivors who would otherwise benefit from that money.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t clear which charitable organizations would have covered his
pay. Los Angeles City Councilmember Monica Rodriguez, who sits on the
committee overseeing the recovery, called the proposed salary
“obscene.”</p>
<p>Soboroff’s original salary was first reported by the Times.</p>

<h2 id="what-the-westminster-show-dogs-names-mean">What the Westminster
show dogs’ names mean</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>They have names that could make a random password generator cry
uncle.</p>
<p>Meet, for example, GCHG CH Calicops Sassafras Gonnakikurass.</p>
<p>“She’s a saucy girl. Her name says it all,” Fred Ortiz said as he
groomed the Brussels griffon to compete Monday at the Westminster Kennel
Club dog show.</p>
<p>Her name says … what exactly? Well, ponder the final part, and you
may understand what her owners are wryly getting at. But in any event,
you can just call her Wrassy.</p>
<p>Westminster’s main competition began Monday with breed-by-breed
judging that leads to U.S. dogdom’s most illustrious best in show prize,
awarded Tuesday night. The kennel club held agility and obedience
contests Saturday, as well as other events.</p>
<p>If show dogs are the aristocrats of the canine world, they often have
the names, titles and nicknames to match.</p>
<p>Their “registered,” or formal, names are the ones used for showing.
Those long, confounding-sounding appellations are packed with show-dog
information.</p>
<p>Clumps of capital letters at the beginning, and sometimes also the
end, signify the dogs’ achievements in various sports. “GCHG” and “CH,”
for example, denote various levels of championship in the traditional,
breed-by-breed judging.</p>
<p>After those titles, the first word in a registered name generally
indicates the kennel, or breeding program, that produced the dog. Other
kennels or dogs in the pedigree might get a shout-out at the end.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, show dogs have “call names” that they go by on a
day-to-day basis. A dog might also have had a different “puppy name”
bestowed by its breeder and later changed by its eventual owner.</p>
<p>The portmanteau words and puzzling phrases in registered names are
partly meant to avoid duplication with other dogs in registries that go
back over a century.</p>
<p>But many breeders also use patterns to help them remember which
litter was which.</p>
<p>Professional dog handlers and sometime miniature schnauzer breeders
Rachel Adams and Alberto Montila name their litters in alphabetical
order — one litter had names that start with “A,” the next with “B,” and
so on, Adams said Monday. She was blow-drying a French bulldog named
GCHG CH Elysium’s Adventurous Rapscallion D’Assisi, better known as
Finn.</p>
<p>When Amie McLaughlin picks names for her litters of Norwegian
buhunds, she just likes to have pun.</p>
<p>“I like the name to be something that someone looks at and says, ‘Oh,
that’s cute,’” said McLaughlin, of Kent, Washington.</p>
<p>A dog she bred and guided Monday, GCH CH Cloudpointe Nothing Betta
Than This CGC, was born into a fish-themed litter (hence “Betta,” a type
of Southeast Asian fish). He goes by Eirik when he’s at home with
co-owner Sarah Woodworth in Paloa, Hawaii.</p>
<p>GCH CH Aberdeen’s Zoltar RN BN-V — just Zoltar, to his friends — has
owners who appreciate humor, too. For one thing, they share their Los
Angeles-area home with a shaggy, clownish, 120-pound otterhound who
likes to cuddle.</p>
<p>Comedian and actor Chris Hardwick, who owns the dog with his wife,
model and actor Lydia Hearst, named Zoltar for the fortune-telling
machine that makes a teenager grow to adult proportions overnight in the
movie “Big.”</p>
<p>“We knew he was going to grow,” and plenty big, explained Hearst.</p>
<p>Zoltar got some recognition Monday from the judge, but the dog’s
cousin Melody, aka GCHS CH Dobhran’s Alexa Play Some Music, won best of
breed.</p>
<p>Hardwick and Hearst were also cheering on the French bulldog breed
winner called Sassy, or GCHS Diva’s Sassafras Lass. She and other breed
winners were headed into a semifinal round Monday night.</p>
<p>Sassy is owned and was co-bred by Hearst’s mother, newspaper heir
Patricia Hearst Shaw. Famous in the 1970s for her abduction and
involvement in a robbery by a radical group, she’s been renowned in
recent years for her Frenchies and other show dogs.</p>
<p>Colton Johnson and his family name their litters of old English
sheepdogs by themes, such as songs, movies, money, or — appropriately —
fluffy things.</p>
<p>One of those “fluff” dogs is GCH CH Bugaboo’s Give Me S’more, who
lolled on a table while Johnson brushed him Monday.</p>
<p>“It’s his spa day,” joked Johnson, of Colorado Springs, Colorado.</p>
<p>The dog’s call name is Graham, as in the crackers that join toasted
marshmallow and chocolate to make s’mores. The Johnsons considered
calling him Marsh or Mallow, but those names didn’t stick.</p>
<p>Three-year-old Graham is a grandson of Swagger, the old English
sheepdog whom Johnson handled to a second-place finish at Westminster in
2013.</p>
<p>Last year’s runner-up, a German shepherd named GCHP Kaleef’s
Mercedes, is back this year for a last hurrah and won her breed Monday.
The 5-year-old will retire from showing after this event, co-owner
Dr. Cynthian Wilhelmy said.</p>
<p>As for her name, “I wanted something German and something that
represented excellence,” said Wilhelmy, of Martinsburg, West Virginia.
“Classic, reliable and excellent — that’s Mercedes.”</p>

id="democrats-look-for-ways-to-oppose-trump-administrations-changes-while-in-the-minority">Democrats
look for ways to oppose Trump administration’s changes while in the
minority</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Democratic lawmakers criticized what they called the Trump
administration’s “extreme” efforts to reshape the U.S. government,
vowing to oppose those changes despite limited political capital in both
chambers of the U.S. Congress.</p>
<p>House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said on the chamber’s floor
Monday that Republicans were departing from their campaign pledge not to
follow Project 2025, a conservative blueprint for reshaping the U.S.
government.</p>
<p>“This year, Republicans have spent all of their time implementing the
most extreme parts of Project 2025 and have done nothing to lower the
high cost of living,” Jeffries said.</p>
<p>Congressional Republicans say Trump is exercising broad presidential
authority to reevaluate government agencies. Trump is accomplishing this
through Elon Musk, a multibillionaire whom he put in charge of the
Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, whose aim is to reduce
federal spending.</p>
<p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer wrote in a letter to colleagues
that Democrats have a four-pronged strategy to oppose the Trump
administration’s actions: oversight, litigation, legislation, and
communication and mobilization.</p>
<p>Schumer also said Democrats would continue to support litigation in
the courts to stop the funding freeze and to prevent federal employees
from being laid off.</p>
<p>Vice President JD Vance criticized those judicial decisions, writing
on X, “If a judge tried to tell a general how to conduct a military
operation, that would be illegal. If a judge tried to command the
attorney general in how to use her discretion as a prosecutor, that’s
also illegal. Judges aren’t allowed to control the executive’s
legitimate power.”</p>
<p>Democratic Senator Chris Murphy responded on X Monday, “For those of
us who believe we are in the middle of a constitutional crisis, this is
the meat of it. Trump and Vance are laying the groundwork to ignore the
courts — democracy’s last line of defense against unchecked executive
power.”</p>
<p>Senate Democrats also announced a new whistleblowers portal for
federal civil service employees and public servants to disclose
information about wrongdoing.</p>
<p>In a statement, they said, “As Senate Republicans refuse to fulfill
their constitutional duty to provide a check on the Executive Branch,
Senate Democrats remain steadfast in our commitment to uncovering the
truth. We are prepared to issue demand letters, preserve public records,
conduct public hearings, and pursue legal action where necessary.”</p>
<p>Schumer said Democrats would support legislation funding the U.S.
government but called on Republicans to negotiate in a bipartisan
fashion. A short-term resolution funding the U.S. government expires on
March 14. Any bill funding the government past that date needs 60 votes
in the U.S. Senate to pass. Republicans currently hold the majority in
the chamber with 53 seats.</p>

id="as-tariffs-take-effect-beijing-and-washington-look-back-to-2020-deal">As
tariffs take effect, Beijing and Washington look back to 2020 deal</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New Chinese tariffs on a range of U.S. goods went into effect Monday,
following U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to impose a 10% tariff
on Chinese products last week. Tariffs of 25% on steel and aluminum are
next.</p>
<p>Despite the tariffs and rising tensions, both sides seem reluctant to
launch into a full-on trade war, analysts say.</p>
<p>Beijing has its plate full battling its own internal economic
struggles, and for now President Trump has deferred most of his promised
tariffs on the world’s second-largest economy.</p>
<p>Last week, The Wall Street Journal reported that Beijing is preparing
to offer to return to a so-called “Phase 1” trade deal that was signed
during Trump’s first term.</p>
<p>The Trump administration has sent its own signals as well. </p>
<p>Trump has called for the Office of the United States Trade
Representative to review the first phase of the U.S.-China trade
agreement and determine whether Beijing has fulfilled its commitments in
the contract.</p>
<p>Last week, Jamieson Greer, Trump’s nominee for U.S. trade
representative, said he would assess China’s compliance with the first
phase of the agreement quickly upon his appointment to ensure the
implementation of the deal. Greer also said he would use it as a
starting point in relations with China.</p>
<p>What is the Phase 1 deal?</p>
<p>On January 15, 2020, Trump and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He signed the
Phase 1 agreement, which laid out several terms for trade between the
world’s two biggest economies. The deal called on the United States to
cut some of its imposed tariffs on China and included a commitment from
Beijing to buy more U.S. products and implement certain reforms.</p>
<p>The 96-page agreement, divided into eight sections, placed a big
emphasis on reducing the U.S. trade deficit with China, and protecting
domestic industries by cracking down on Chinese trade practices, such as
nontariff trade barriers, intellectual property violations and the
forced transfer of technology without adequate compensation.</p>
<p>The agreement mandated that China purchase at least $200 billion in
U.S. products and services over a two-year period from January 1, 2020,
to December 31, 2021. It also required that Beijing stop subsidizing
strategic sectors and give fairer treatment to American companies in
terms of regulation.</p>
<p>Despite those commitments from China, data from a report published in
2022 by the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington
showed that Beijing did not reach its purchase target.</p>
<p>The report also showed that Beijing has completed 57% of the spending
laid out in the agreement, a total that is lower than the level of
China’s purchase of goods from the United States before the U.S.-China
trade war.</p>
<p>Although China was not expected to fully meet its commitments, the
agreement did have some benefits for Washington, as it helped decrease
Washington’s trade deficit with Beijing.</p>
<p>Starting point</p>
<p>Analysts say the agreement may be revisited as a starting point for
new trade discussions.</p>
<p>“The two sides need to start somewhere. Phase 1 may at least provide
some common language that both sides will be familiar with so as to get
that ball rolling,” Chad Brown, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute
for International Economics, explained to VOA in an emailed response
Friday.</p>
<p>Denny Roy, a senior fellow at the East-West Center in Hawaii, says
the Phase 1 agreement has two advantages for acting as a foundation for
U.S.-China trade discussions.</p>
<p>“First, the two sides reached a similar agreement before, so they
know it’s feasible,” he told VOA in an emailed response on Friday.</p>
<p>He also explained that using the agreement “suits both sides’
interests.”</p>
<p>“Trump wants to claim he has resolved the bilateral trade imbalance,
which he sees as his primary measure of success,” he explained, noting
that this agreement supports that narrative.</p>
<p>He added that the deal benefits Beijing by allowing China to avoid
making significant structural reforms.</p>
<p>Roy, however, adds that several factors make an agreement between
Washington and Beijing difficult.</p>
<p>“A major bilateral economic deal would depend on avoiding a strategic
crisis, which might occur over Taiwan or the South China Sea, or an
encounter between U.S. and Chinese ships or aircraft that escalates, or
something like the spy balloon incident,” he said.</p>
<p>Early in 2023, the discovery of a Chinese spy balloon floating
through U.S. airspace delayed a U.S. diplomatic visit to the country by
then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken. The ballon was eventually shot
down.</p>

id="arizona-adds-endangered-bat-to-list-of-night-flying-creatures-that-frequent-the-state">Arizona
adds endangered bat to list of night-flying creatures that frequent the
state</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>FLAGSTAFF, ARIZONA — Scientists have long suspected that Mexican
long-nosed bats migrate through southeastern Arizona, but without
capturing and measuring the night-flying creatures, proof has been
elusive. </p>
<p>Researchers say they now have a way to tell the endangered species
apart from other bats by analyzing saliva the nocturnal mammals leave
behind when sipping nectar from plants and residential hummingbird
feeders. </p>
<p>Bat Conservation International, a nonprofit group working to end the
extinction of bat species worldwide, teamed up with residents from
southeastern Arizona, southwestern New Mexico and west Texas for the
saliva-swabbing campaign. </p>
<p>The samples of saliva left along potential migration routes were sent
to a lab at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, where researchers
looked for environmental DNA — or eDNA — to confirm that the bats cycle
through Arizona and consider the region their part-time home. </p>
<p>The Mexican long-nosed bat has been listed as endangered under the
Endangered Species Act since 1988, and is the only one in Arizona with
that federal protection. It is an important species for pollinating
cactus, agave and other desert plants. </p>
<p>Officials from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Arizona
Game and Fish Department announced the discovery in late January. While
expanding Arizona’s list of bat species to 29 is exciting, wildlife
managers say the use of this novel, noninvasive method to nail it down
also deserves to be celebrated. </p>
<p>“If we were trying to identify the species in the absence of eDNA,
biologists could spend hours and hours trying to catch one of these
bats, and even then, you’re not guaranteed to be successful,” said Angie
McIntire, a bat specialist for the Arizona’s Game and Fish Department.
“By sampling the environment, eDNA gives us an additional tool for our
toolkit.” </p>
<p>Every spring, Mexican long-nosed bats traverse a lengthy migratory
path north from Mexico into the southwestern U.S., following the sweet
nectar of their favorite blooming plants like breadcrumbs. They return
along the same route in the fall. </p>
<p>The bat conservation group recruited ordinary citizens for the
mission, giving them kits to swab samples from bird feeders throughout
the summer and fall. </p>
<p>Inside the university lab, microbiology major Anna Riley extracted
the DNA from hundreds of samples and ran them through machines that
ultimately could detect the presence of bats. Part of the work involved
a steady hand, with Riley using a syringe of sorts to transfer diluted
DNA into tiny vials before popping them into a centrifuge. </p>
<p>Sample after sample, vial after vial, the meticulous work took
months. </p>
<p>“There’s a big database that has DNA sequences of not every animal
but most species, and so we could compare our DNA sequences we got from
these samples to what’s in the database,” Riley said. “A little bit like
a Google search — you’ve got your question, you’re asking Google, you
plug it into the database, and it turns up you’ve got a bat, and you
have this kind of bat.” </p>
<p>Kristen Lear, of the conservation group, said the collection of eDNA
has been used successfully for determining the presence of other kinds
of wildlife in various environments, so the group proposed trying it
with bats. </p>
<p>“They do apparently leave behind a lot of spit on these plants and
hummingbird feeders,” Lear said.</p>

id="cases-of-measles-in-texas-county-with-numerous-vaccine-exemptions">15
cases of measles in Texas county with numerous vaccine exemptions</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Fifteen measles cases — mostly in school-aged children — have been
confirmed in a small county in West Texas with one of the highest rates
of vaccine exemptions in the state.</p>
<p>South Plains Public Health District Director Zach Holbrooks said
Monday that his department was first notified in late January about the
first two cases in Gaines County, which he said were “two children who
had seen a physician in Lubbock.”</p>
<p>Some of the cases appear to be connected to private religious schools
in the district, said Holbrooks, who cautioned that the investigation is
ongoing.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t say they’re all connected, but our teams are looking into
exposure sites and the background of those cases,” he said.</p>
<p>Local health officials set up a drive-through vaccination clinic last
week and are offering screening services to residents.</p>
<p>The U.S. saw a rise in measles cases in 2024, including an outbreak
in Chicago that sickened more than 60. This month, health officials in
metro Atlanta are working to contain a measles case that spread to two
unvaccinated family members.</p>
<p>Texas law allows children to get an exemption from school vaccines
for reasons of conscience, including religious beliefs.</p>
<p>The percentage of kids with exemptions has risen over the last decade
from .76% in 2014 to 2.32% last year, according to Texas Department of
State Health Services data.</p>
<p>Gaines County has one of the highest rates in Texas of school-aged
children who opt out of at least one required vaccine: Nearly 14% of
children from kindergarten through grade 12 had an exemption in the
2023-24 school year, which is more than five times the state average of
2.32% and beyond the national rate of 3.3%.</p>
<p>But the number of unvaccinated kids in the county is likely
significantly higher, DSHS spokesperson Lara Anton said, because Gaines
County has many children who are homeschooled and whose data would not
be reported.</p>
<p>The measles, mumps and rubella vaccines are a two-shot series: The
first is recommended at 12 to 15 months old and second between 4 to 6
years old. The vaccine is required to attend most public schools in the
U.S.</p>
<p>But vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the COVID-19
pandemic and most states are below the 95% vaccination threshold for
kindergartners — the level needed to protect communities against measles
outbreaks. Lawmakers across the country have proposed various vaccine
requirement changes at a time when anti-vaccine activist Robert F.
Kennedy Jr. is awaiting confirmation as the secretary of Health and
Human Services.</p>
<p>One of the early Gaines County cases traveled to neighboring New
Mexico while they were still infectious, Anton said, but there were no
immediate reports of infection. New Mexico Department of Health

state.</p>
<p>“We’re going to watch this very closely,” Nott said.</p>
<p>Two cases of measles were reported in early January in the Houston
area, but Holbrooks said the West Texas cases don’t appear to be
connected.</p>
<p>Measles is a highly contagious virus that can survive in the air for
up to two hours. Up to 9 out of 10 people who are susceptible will get
the virus if exposed, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention. Before the vaccine was introduced in 1963, the U.S. saw
some 3 million to 4 million cases per year. Now, it’s usually fewer than
200 in a normal year.</p>

judge keeps block on Trump federal buyout plan in place for now</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BOSTON/WASHINGTON — A U.S. judge kept his block on President Donald
Trump’s buyout plan for federal employees in place on Monday while he
considers whether to impose it for a longer period of time. </p>
<p>The decision by U.S. District Judge George O’Toole in Boston prevents
Trump’s administration from implementing the buyout plan for now, giving
a temporary victory to labor unions that have sued to stop it
entirely. </p>
<p>More than 2 million federal civilian employees had faced a midnight
deadline Monday to accept the proposal. It is unclear when O’Toole will
rule on the request by the unions. </p>
<p>The buyout effort is part of a far-reaching plan by Trump and his
allies to reduce the size and rein in the actions of the federal
bureaucracy. Trump, who returned to the presidency on Jan. 20, has
accused the federal workforce of undercutting his agenda during his
first term in office, from 2017 to 2021. </p>
<p>Unions have urged their members not to accept the buyout offer —
saying Trump’s administration cannot be trusted to honor it — but about
65,000 federal employees had signed up for the buyouts as of Friday,
according to a White House official. </p>
<p>Reuters has been unable to independently verify that number, which
does not include a breakdown of workers from each agency. </p>
<p>The offer promises to pay employees their regular salaries and
benefits until October without requiring them to work, but that may not
be ironclad. Current spending laws expire on March 14, and there is no
guarantee that salaries would be funded beyond that point. </p>
<p>At a court hearing, U.S. Justice Department attorney Eric Hamilton
called the buyout plan a “humane off-ramp” for those frustrated by
Trump’s decision to reduce the size of the workforce and end the ability
of many of them to work from home. </p>
<p>But a lawyer for the unions said the plan had been carried out in a
“slap dash” fashion with little regard to how it might disrupt
operations at agencies such as the Department of Veterans Affairs. </p>
<p>“They failed to consider the continued functioning of government,”
lawyer Elena Goldstein said. </p>
<p>The administration had initially proposed a deadline of last Thursday
before O’Toole, an appointee of Democratic former President Bill
Clinton, extended it so he could consider the case. </p>
<p>Trump has tasked Tesla CEO and SpaceX founder Elon Musk, the world’s
richest person, with overseeing the purge of federal employees through
his Department of Government Efficiency, which is not an actual
government agency. </p>
<p>Musk’s actions have sown panic among federal workers and prompted
public protests. His actions also have led to a flood of calls to U.S.
lawmakers by voters worried about the access that Musk’s team has been
given to sensitive information in government computer systems that
contain data on federal payments to Americans and personal details of
federal workers. </p>
<p>Several lawsuits </p>
<p>The unions and Democratic attorneys general have brought lawsuits
challenging Trump’s rapid remaking of government and won some initial
victories. </p>
<p>A union that represents Consumer Financial Protection Bureau workers
has filed a lawsuit seeking to block acting chief Russell Vought’s move
to suspend CFPB activities, one of several legal challenges that Trump’s
administration now faces. </p>
<p>Democratic attorneys general from 22 U.S. states filed a lawsuit on
Monday in Boston challenging sharp cuts to federal grant funding for
universities, medical centers and other research institutions by the
Trump administration. </p>
<p>An effort to hollow out the U.S. Agency for International Development
is partially on hold after a judge’s ruling. </p>
<p>Trump’s effort to freeze trillions of dollars in federal loans,
grants and other financial assistance has also been paused in a separate
case. A federal judge in Rhode Island on Monday ruled that the
administration must restore all domestic funding while he considers the
case. </p>
<p>On Saturday, a judge temporarily blocked Musk’s entity from accessing
government systems used to process trillions of dollars in payments at
the Treasury Department.</p>

<h2 id="trump-signs-executive-orders-on-steel-aluminum-tariffs">Trump
signs executive orders on steel, aluminum tariffs</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — President Donald Trump moved to substantially raise
tariffs on steel and aluminum imports on Monday, canceling exemptions
and duty-free quotas for major suppliers Canada, Mexico, Brazil and
other countries in a move that could boost the risk of a multifront
trade war. </p>
<p>Trump signed proclamations that raised the tariff rate on aluminum
imports to 25% from the previous 10% that he imposed in 2018 to aid the
struggling sector. His action reinstates a 25% tariff on millions of
tons of steel imports and aluminum imports that had been entering the
U.S. duty free under quota deals, exemptions and thousands of product
exclusions. </p>
<p>The proclamations were extensions of Trump’s 2018 Section 232
national security tariffs to protect steel and aluminum makers. A White
House official said the exemptions had eroded the effectiveness of these
measures. </p>
<p>Trump also will impose a new North American standard requiring steel
imports to be “melted and poured” and aluminum to be “smelted and cast”
in the region to curb imports of minimally processed Chinese steel into
the U.S. </p>
<p>The order also targets downstream steel products that use imported
steel for tariffs. </p>
<p>Trump’s trade adviser Peter Navarro said the measures would help U.S.
steel and aluminum producers and shore up America’s economic and
national security. </p>
<p>“The steel and aluminum tariffs 2.0 will put an end to foreign
dumping, boost domestic production and secure our steel and aluminum
industries as the backbone and pillar industries of America’s economic
and national security,” he told reporters. </p>
<p>“This isn’t just about trade. It’s about ensuring that America never
has to rely on foreign nations for critical industries like steel and
aluminum.” </p>
<p>Trump first broached the steel and aluminum action on Sunday, adding
that he would also announce a further set of reciprocal tariffs later in
the week, drawing warnings of retaliation from trade partners.</p>

US deportation flights head to Venezuela, alleged gang members
aboard</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Two planes carrying Venezuelan migrants deported from the United
States — the first since a January deal between the administration of
U.S. President Donald Trump and Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro —
are heading to Venezuela, the South American country’s government said
Monday. </p>
<p>The flights, run by Venezuelan airline Conviasa, are part of a plan
to repatriate thousands of migrants who fled Venezuela “because of
economic sanctions and the campaigns of psychological warfare against
our country,” the government statement said. </p>
<p>Some of the people on the flight are allegedly involved in illegal
activities with the Tren de Aragua gang, the statement said and will be
vigorously investigated for criminal ties. </p>
<p>Trump envoy Richard Grenell met with Maduro in Caracas on Jan. 31,
where the two men discussed migration and sanctions, among other issues.
Grenell left the South American country with six Americans who had been
held by Venezuelan authorities. </p>
<p>The Trump administration has said it is a priority to deport members
of Tren de Aragua from the U.S. and Trump himself said after Grenell’s
visit that Maduro agreed to receive all Venezuelan illegal migrants and
provide for their transportation back home. </p>
<p>The Venezuelan government says it destroyed Tren de Aragua within its
borders in 2023. </p>
<p>Trump’s administration has also moved to remove deportation
protection from about 348,000 Venezuelans in the U.S., who could lose
work permits and then be deported in April. </p>
<p>More than 7 million Venezuelan migrants have left their country in
recent years amid a sustained economic and social collapse blamed by the
government on sanctions by the United States and others. </p>
<p>Maduro and several allies have been indicted by the United States on
drug trafficking charges and international observers and the country’s
opposition say a July election which gave Maduro his third term was
fraudulent.</p>

id="trump-calls-for-halting-penny-production-saying-its-too-expensive">Trump
calls for halting penny production, saying it’s too expensive</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>RICHMOND, VIRGINIA — The lowly penny, the forgotten mainstay of coin
jars and car cupholders everywhere, may soon be no more.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump announced Sunday he’s ordered his
administration to cease production of the 1-cent coin, whose buying
power is long past its prime.</p>
<p>Advocates for ditching the penny cite its high production cost —
currently almost 4 cents per penny, according to the U.S. Mint — and
limited utility. Fans of the penny cite its usefulness in charity drives
and relative bargain in production costs compared with the nickel, which
costs almost 14 cents to mint.</p>
<p>Trump’s surprise order comes after decades of unsuccessful efforts to
pitch the penny.</p>
<p>“Only tradition explains our stubborn attachment to the penny. But
sometimes traditions get ridiculous,” the Farmers’ Almanac said in its
1989 edition.</p>
<p>Here’s a look at some questions surrounding Trump’s order.</p>
<p>Can Trump really order the Treasury to stop minting pennies without
Congress’ approval?</p>
<p>Yes, according to legal scholar Laurence H. Tribe, the Carl M. Loeb
University Professor of Constitutional Law Emeritus at Harvard
University.</p>
<p>U.S. code gives the Treasury Secretary the authority to mint and
issue coins “in amounts the secretary decides are necessary to meet the
needs of the United States.”</p>
<p>If Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent decides the amount necessary for
the penny is zero, he’s within his legal rights, Tribe said.</p>
<p>“Unlike a lot of what the new administration has been doing pursuant
to the flood of executive orders since January 20, this action seems to
me entirely lawful and fully constitutional,” Tribe said, referring to
the aggressive executive action Trump’s taken on other issues since
taking office.</p>
<p>Congress, which dictates currency specifications like the size and
metal content of coins, could make Trump’s order permanent through law.
But past congressional efforts to ditch the penny have failed.</p>
<p>Pennies are mostly made of zinc, and the American zinc lobby has been
a major opponent to suggestions that the penny be eliminated.</p>
<p>How many pennies are in circulation?</p>
<p>It depends on what you mean by circulation.</p>
<p>Pennies are the most popular coin made by the U.S. Mint, which
reported making 3.2 billion of them last year. That’s more than half of
all the new coins it made last year.</p>
<p>MIT Professor Jeff Gore, who founded Citizens to Retire the Penny,
said coins are supposed to stay in circulation for about 30 years and
that in the last three decades the U.S. Mint has made about 250 billion
pennies.</p>
<p>But, he says, “because nobody wants to use pennies, they fall out of
active circulation much faster than other coins.”</p>
<p>If pennies sit in drawer for a decade, Gore asks, “Does that qualify
as being in circulation?”</p>
<p>Will Americans miss pennies?</p>
<p>Experience in other countries suggests no.</p>
<p>Canada started phasing out its penny a dozen years ago and urged
store owners to round prices to the nearest nickel for cash
transactions. Electronic purchases were still billed to the nearest
cent. The move came after New Zealand, Australia, the Netherlands and
others dropped their lowest-denomination coins.</p>
<p>After dropping the penny or its equivalent, those countries have not
looked back.</p>
<p>What comes next?</p>
<p>Trump’s order, which he announced in a social media post as he was
departing New Orleans after watching the first half of the Super Bowl,
was the latest in his administration’s rapid-fire efforts to cut
government costs.</p>
<p>“Let’s rip the waste out of our great nation’s budget, even if it’s a
penny at a time,” Trump wrote in his post, which was light on details
about plans for a post-penny future.</p>
<p>After Canada stopped minting new pennies, it began recycling them for
their “valuable” copper and zinc, according to a 2022 report from the
Canadian Mint.</p>

id="boston-man-cleared-of-us-charges-he-acted-as-chinese-agent">Boston
man cleared of US charges he acted as Chinese agent</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Boston — A jury found a Boston man not guilty on Monday of U.S.
charges that he acted as an unlawful agent of China’s government by
supplying officials information about individuals, dissidents and groups
in the local Chinese community. </p>
<p>Litang Liang, 65, was acquitted in federal court of charges that he
acted as an unregistered Chinese agent in a case brought in 2023 that
U.S. authorities had portrayed as part of their commitment to counter
efforts by China’s government ato silence its critics abroad. </p>
<p>Liang, a China-born U.S. citizen, had denied the charges and pleaded
not guilty. His lawyer during the trial called the charges “ridiculous”
and called them an effort to chill the free speech of a local community
activist who advocated for the “reunification” of democratically
governed Taiwan with mainland China – a view in harmony with China’s
leaders. </p>
<p>“Justice has finally arrived,” Liang told reporters through a
translator following the verdict. </p>
<p>U.S. Attorney Leah Foley, whose office pursued the case, said in a
statement that while prosecutors “respect the jury’s decision, we are
disappointed in (Monday’s) verdict.” </p>
<p>Liang had worked at a hotel and for years had been an active member
in his union as well as a community organizer and activist in the
Chinese-American community in Boston, according to his lawyer, Derege
Demissie. </p>
<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Timothy Kistner told jurors on Friday during
closing arguments in the case that China’s government sought out Liang
because it “wanted someone already involved in the community who knew
the people who were there.” </p>
<p>Prosecutors said Liang from 2018 to 2022 provided Chinese officials
with information on individuals and shared details about dissidents and
groups with pro-Taiwan leanings. </p>
<p>Prosecutors said that in 2018, after traveling to Beijing for
meetings with an arm of the Chinese Communist Party, Liang founded the
New England Alliance for the Peaceful Unification of China, which
focused on promoting China’s goals with Taiwan. </p>
<p>China views democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory.
Taiwan rejects Beijing’s sovereignty claims, saying only the island’s
people can decide their future. </p>
<p>Prosecutors said Liang, also at the direction of Chinese officials,
in 2019 organized a counter-demonstration against pro-democracy
protesters, and in 2022 provided an official with a Chinese agency,
tasked with investigating political dissidents, information on two
potential local recruits. </p>
<p>Demissie in his closing argument to the jury countered that Liang
made no secret of his activism and that his prosecution infringed on
Liang’s right to free speech under the U.S. Constitution’s First
Amendment. </p>
<p>“This case would have meant nothing if it did not involve China,”
Demissie said. “That’s what this is about. And it had the purpose of
scaring people, and it achieved that purpose.”</p>

judge says Trump administration violated order lifting spending
freeze</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A U.S. judge on Monday said President Donald Trump’s administration
violated a court order lifting a broad freeze on federal spending and
directed the government to immediately release any withheld funds. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge John McConnell in Providence, Rhode Island, had
already blocked the funding freeze with a temporary restraining order on
Jan. 31, but a group of Democratic state attorneys general who sued to
block the move said last week that the government was still withholding
funds. </p>
<p>The Trump administration on Monday said it is appealing. </p>
<p>“The broad categorical and sweeping freeze of federal funds is, as
the court found, likely unconstitutional and has caused and continues to
cause irreparable harm to a vast portion of this country,” McConnell
said on Monday. “These pauses in funding violate the plain text of the
TRO.” </p>
<p>McConnell said all funding must be restored at least until he can
hold a hearing on the states’ motion for a longer-term order. </p>
<p>On Feb. 6, a lawyer with the office of Democratic New York Attorney
General Letitia James told McConnell that state agencies were still
having difficulty accessing federal funds, including billions of dollars
for infrastructure projects under the Inflation Reduction Act. </p>
<p>The Trump administration had told states it believed the order did
not apply to certain environmental and infrastructure spending, and that
some payments were delayed for “operational and administrative
reasons.” </p>
<p>However, McConnell said his order had been “clear and unambiguous” in
applying to all funding frozen in response to sweeping executive orders
by Trump. </p>
<p>The states originally sued the administration over a memorandum from
the White House’s Office of Management and Budget announcing a
wide-ranging freeze of federal spending. Soon after the lawsuit was
filed, OMB rescinded that memo. </p>
<p>The memo was part of a larger Trump administration push to tighten
federal spending and reshape the federal bureaucracy, which has sparked
a flurry of lawsuits. </p>
<p>In a separate case over Trump’s push to dismantle the U.S. Agency for
International Development, federal employee unions have accused the
administration of violating a court order reinstating USAID workers who
were placed on administrative leave.</p>

<p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to visit the U.S. on
Wednesday. President Donald Trump announced Modi’s White House visit as
India’s foreign secretary, Vikram Misri, met with Chinese Foreign
Minister Wang Yi in Beijing, where they agreed to restore bilateral ties
and resume direct flights and pilgrimages by Indian pilgrims to a holy

<p>While Modi’s government has shifted toward populist policies, China
launched an aggressive public relations campaign in 2024 to improve its

to the deepening U.S.-India partnership and Beijing’s desire to maintain
regional influence, particularly given expected tensions with the Trump
administration. </p>

Persian: With no new nuclear deal, Iran to remain under maximum
pressure, US says</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The restored maximum pressure campaign on Iran will continue if it
does not want a new nuclear deal, the ‌State Department said, while
reiterating Washington’s commitment to preventing Iran from acquiring a
nuclear weapon. </p>
<p>“If the Iranian regime does not want a deal, the president is clear,
Iran will remain under the restored maximum pressure campaign,” a State
Department spokesperson told VOA Persian on Monday, referring to
President Donald Trump’s willingness to discuss a new deal with
Iran. </p>
<p>Trump wrote on Truth Social that he seeks a “Verified Nuclear Peace
Agreement, which will let Iran peacefully grow and prosper” in return
for ensuring that the Islamic Republic “cannot have a Nuclear
Weapon.” </p>

<h2 id="us-defense-chief-headed-to-europe-for-nato-ukraine-meetings">US
defense chief headed to Europe for NATO, Ukraine meetings</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Pentagon — New U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is headed to
Europe, his first international trip since taking office last month.</p>
<p>Hegseth departed from Joint Base Andrews, just outside of Washington,
early Monday, for stops in Germany, Belgium and Poland.</p>
<p>In Germany, the defense secretary is scheduled to visit the
headquarters for U.S. European Command, and U.S. Africa Command, getting
updates on developments in both regions. </p>
<p>From Germany, Hegseth will travel to Brussels for the NATO Defense
Ministerial and a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group on
Wednesday and Thursday.</p>
<p>U.S. defense officials say Hegseth is expected to press U.S. allies
in Europe to increase their defense spending and take more of a
leadership role for challenges facing Europe.</p>
<p>He is also expected to echo U.S. President Donald Trump’s call for a
diplomatic end to the war between Russia and Ukraine, which is about to
enter its third year.</p>
<p>The meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group — a group of almost
50 countries who have pledged to support Ukraine in its efforts to repel
Russia — is the first to take place during the new Trump administration
and will be the first led by a country other than the U.S.</p>
<p>This week’s meeting, the 26th, will be led by Britain.</p>
<p>Britain’s Defense Ministry, in a statement Thursday said the meeting
will focus on “priorities for Ukraine as the international community
continues to work together to support Ukraine in its fight against
[Russian President Vladimir] Putin’s illegal invasion.”</p>
<p>The Pentagon, in a statement previewing Hegseth’s participation in
the meeting, said in addition to emphasizing Trump’s push for a
diplomatic resolution to the war, the secretary, “will also highlight
the need for increased European leadership on security assistance to
Ukraine.”</p>
<p>Following the meetings in Brussels, Hegseth is scheduled to travel to
Poland to meet with leaders there and visit with U.S. troops.</p>
<p>Of note, the U.S. defense secretary said he is skipping the annual
Munich Security Conference in Germany, which bills itself as “the
world’s leading forum for debating international security policy,” which
gets underway Friday.</p>
<p>“We’re not going to the Munich Security Conference,” Hegseth told
defense officials and troops at a town hall meeting last Friday at the
Pentagon.</p>
<p>“We’re instead going to Poland to see the troops out there and we’re
going to Germany to see EUCOM and AFRICOM,” he said. “I would much
rather talk to troops than go to cocktail parties. That’s my job.”</p>
<p>Instead, the U.S. is set to be represented in Munich by Vice
President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.</p>

id="opening-statements-begin-in-trial-of-man-accused-of-trying-to-kill-salman-rushdie">Opening
statements begin in trial of man accused of trying to kill Salman
Rushdie</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Mayville, New York — Lawyers began delivering opening statements
Monday at the trial of the man charged with trying to fatally stab
author Salman Rushdie in front of a lecture audience in western New
York.  </p>
<p>Rushdie, 77, is expected to testify during the trial of Hadi Matar,
bringing the writer face-to-face with his knife-wielding attacker for
the first time in more than two years.  </p>
<p>Rushdie, the Booker Prize-winning author, had been about to speak
about keeping writers safe from harm in August 2022 when Matar ran
toward him on the stage at the Chautauqua Institution Amphitheater.
Matar stabbed Rushdie more than a dozen times in the neck, stomach,
chest, hand and right eye, leaving him partially blind and with
permanent damage to one hand. </p>
<p>The Indian-born British-American author detailed the attack and his
long, painful recovery in a memoir, “Knife: Meditations After an
Attempted Murder,” released last year. Rushdie had worried for his
safety since his 1989 novel “The Satanic Verses” was denounced as
blasphemous by many Muslims and led to Iran’s Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini issuing a fatwa calling for his death.  </p>
<p>Rushdie spent years in hiding, but had traveled freely over the past
quarter century after Iran announced it would not enforce the decree.
 </p>
<p>The trial is taking place as the 36th anniversary of the fatwa —
Feb. 14, 1989 — approaches.  </p>
<p>Matar, 27, of Fairview, New Jersey, is charged with attempted murder
and assault. He has pleaded not guilty.  </p>
<p>A jury was selected last week. Matar was in court throughout the
three-day process, taking notes and consulting with his attorneys. He
calmly said, “Free Palestine” while being led in to court Monday past
members of the media taking photographs and video.  </p>
<p>Matar’s defense faced a challenging start after it was announced that
his lawyer, Nathaniel Barone, was hospitalized with an undisclosed
illness and would not attend the start of the trial.  </p>
<p>Judge David Foley refused a defense request to postpone opening
statements, instead instructing an associate of Barone to deliver the
defense’s opening statement in his place.</p>
<p>Once testimony is underway, the trial is expected to last a week to
10 days. Jurors will be shown video and photos from the day of the
attack, which ended when onlookers rushed Matar and held him until
police arrived.  </p>
<p>The event’s moderator, Henry Reese, co-founder of City of Asylum in
Pittsburgh, was also wounded. Matar told investigators he traveled by
bus to Chautauqua, about 120 kilometers south of Buffalo. He is believed
to have slept in the grounds of the arts and academic retreat the night
before the attack.  </p>
<p>Matar’s attorney has not indicated what his defense will be. In a
separate indictment, federal authorities allege Matar was motivated by a
terrorist organization’s endorsement of a fatwa, or edict, calling for
Rushdie’s death.  </p>
<p>A later trial on the federal charges — terrorism transcending
national boundaries, providing material support to terrorists and
attempting to provide material support to a terrorist organization —
will be scheduled in U.S. District Court in Buffalo.  </p>
<p>Rushdie has been one of the world’s most celebrated authors since the
1981 publication of “Midnight’s Children,” winner of the Booker Prize.
His other works include the novels “Shame” and “Victory City,” which he
had completed shortly before the 2022 stabbing, and the 2012 memoir
“Joseph Anton,” in which he wrote about his time in hiding.</p>
<p>In the federal indictment, authorities allege Matar believed the
edict was backed by the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah and
endorsed in a 2006 speech by the group’s then-leader, Hassan
Nasrallah.</p>

id="third-federal-judge-blocks-trumps-birthright-citizenship-order">Third
federal judge blocks Trump’s birthright citizenship order</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Concord, New Hampshire — A third federal judge on Monday blocked
President Donald Trump’s executive order ending birthright citizenship
for the children of people who are in the U.S. illegally.  </p>
<p>The ruling from U.S. District Judge Joseph N. Laplante in New
Hampshire comes after two similar rulings by judges in Seattle and
Maryland last week. A lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties
Union contends that Trump’s order violates the Constitution and
“attempts to upend one of the most fundamental American constitutional
values.”  </p>
<p>Trump’s Republican administration has asserted that children of
noncitizens are not “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States
and therefore are not entitled to citizenship.  </p>
<p>The administration is appealing the Seattle judge’s block on Trump’s
executive order.  </p>
<p>At the heart of the lawsuits in the three cases is the 14th Amendment
to the Constitution, ratified in 1868 after the Civil War and the Dred
Scott Supreme Court decision, which held that Scott, an enslaved man,
wasn’t a citizen despite having lived in a state where slavery was
outlawed.  </p>
<p>In 1898, in a case known as United States v. Wong Kim Ark, the U.S.
Supreme Court found the only children who did not automatically receive
U.S. citizenship upon being born on U.S. soil were children of
diplomats, who have allegiance to another government; enemies present in
the U.S. during hostile occupation; those born on foreign ships; and
those born to members of sovereign Native American tribes.  </p>
<p>The U.S. is among about 30 countries where birthright citizenship —
the principle of jus soli, or “right of the soil” — is applied. Most are
in the Americas and Canada and Mexico are among them.</p>

grants request to block detained Venezuelan immigrants from being sent
to Guantanamo</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — A federal court on Sunday blocked the Trump
administration from sending three Venezuelan immigrants held in New
Mexico to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba as part of the president’s
immigration crackdown.</p>
<p>In a legal filing earlier in the day, lawyers for the men said the
detainees “fit the profile of those the administration has prioritized
for detention in Guantanamo, i.e. Venezuelan men detained in the El Paso
area with (false) charges of connections with the Tren de Aragua
gang.”</p>
<p>It asked a U.S. District Court in New Mexico for a temporary
restraining order blocking their transfer, adding that “the mere
uncertainty the government has created surrounding the availability of
legal process and counsel access is sufficient to authorize the modest
injunction.”</p>
<p>During a brief hearing, Judge Kenneth J. Gonzales granted the
temporary order, which was opposed by the government, said Jessica
Vosburgh, an attorney for the three men.</p>
<p>“It’s short term. This will get revisited and further fleshed out in
the weeks to come,” Vosburgh told The Associated Press.</p>
<p>A message seeking comment was left for U.S. Customs and Immigration
Enforcement.</p>
<p>The filing came as part of a lawsuit on behalf of the three men filed
by the Center for Constitutional Rights, the American Civil Liberties
Union of New Mexico, and Las Americas Immigrant Advisory Center.</p>
<p>The Tren de Aragua gang originated in a lawless prison in the central
Venezuelan state of Aragua more than a decade ago and has expanded in
recent years as millions of desperate Venezuelans fled President
President Nicolás Maduro ’s rule and migrated to other parts of Latin
America or the U.S.</p>
<p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said last week that flights
of detainees had landed at Guantanamo. Immigrant rights groups sent a
letter Friday demanding access to people who have been sent there,
saying the base should not be used as a “legal black hole.”</p>
<p>White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday that more
than 8,000 people have been arrested in immigration enforcement actions
since Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration.</p>
<p>Trump has vowed to deport millions of the estimated 11.7 million
people in the U.S. illegally.</p>

<h2 id="anora-wins-at-producers-and-directors-guild-awards">‘Anora’ wins
at Producers and Directors Guild Awards</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Did a wide-open Oscar race just get a front runner?</p>
<p>Sean Baker’s Brooklyn comedy “Anora” took top honors at both the
Producers Guild Awards and the Directors Guild Awards on Saturday night,
catapulting it to Oscar favorite status with wins from a pair of closely
watched Academy Awards precursors.</p>
<p>Hollywood’s award season has been uncharacteristically up for grabs
with half a dozen films viewed as legitimate best-picture contenders.
Some had pegged “Anora” as the front runner going into the season after
the film, starring Mikey Madison as a Brooklyn exotic dancer who marries
the son of a Russian oligarch, won the Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film
Festival.</p>
<p>But after several films took turns in the spotlight, including Golden
Globe winners “The Brutalist” and “Emilia Perez,” “Anora” reemerged in a
big way over the weekend. Baker’s film also won best picture at the
Critics Choice Awards on Friday.</p>
<p>Both guild ceremonies were held in Beverly Hills, California. The
PGA’s top prize, the Darryl F. Zanuck Award, has matched the Oscar
winner for best picture in 16 of the last 21 years. Since 2009, when the
guild and the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences both adopted
a preferential ballot to pick a winner from 10 nominees, they’ve
corresponded all but three times.</p>
<p>The DGA is similarly predictive. In the past 74 years, 66 winners
have gone on to triumph at the Oscars. That makes Baker the favorite for
best director in a field entirely composed of first-time nominees.</p>
<p>The guild also named RaMell Ross’ “Nickel Boys” best first film.
Ross’ movie, nominated for best picture by the Oscars, is his narrative
film debut.</p>
<p>Oscar voting begins Tuesday. Jacques Audiard’s “Emilia Perez” is the
lead nominee with 13 nominations, but the Netflix film has seen its
chances crater following multiple waves of backlash and controversy.</p>
<p>Another Oscar category also found clarity over the weekend. On
Saturday at the Annie Awards, DreamWorks Animation’s “The Wild Robot”
cleaned up with nine awards including best film. “The Wild Robot” will
be the heavy favorite to win best animated film at the March 2 Academy
Awards.</p>

id="super-bowl-commercials-rely-on-comedy-nostalgia-to-avoid-potential-missteps">Super
Bowl commercials rely on comedy, nostalgia to avoid potential
missteps</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Most of the commercials airing during this year’s Super Bowl are
going for laughs, with advertisers betting that America could use a
little break.</p>
<p>As the Philadelphia Eagles and the Kansas City Chiefs hit the field
in New Orleans, a parade of silly ads will hit airwaves Sunday. Many
companies put their ads online ahead of the game, but some held out to
maintain an element of surprise.</p>
<p>Humor dominates in the ads released so far. Four old ladies go on a
joy ride with WeatherTech, while Eugene Levy’s eyebrows fly off and buzz
around after he eats some Little Caesars. Sloths have a case of the
Mondays in an ad for Coors Light. A man’s tongue starts dancing to
celebrate cold foam from Nestlé Coffee Mate. British singer Seal becomes
an actual seal, sad that he can’t hold Mountain Dew with his
flippers.</p>
<p>Actor Glenn Powell does a take on Goldilocks for Ram Trucks, while
comedian Nate Bargatze clones himself and hires an opera singer because
he saved so much money using DoorDash. Shaboozey takes a lighthearted
stroll through New Orleans for Nerds, while the stars of the “Fast and
Furious” franchise take a slow cruise in a convertible so they can enjoy
Häagen-Dazs ice cream bars.</p>
<p>Tim Calkins, a professor of marketing at Northwestern University’s
Kellogg School of Management, said this was a complicated Super Bowl for
advertisers.</p>
<p>Most ads were in development during last fall’s U.S. presidential
election race, so avoiding controversy was even more of a priority than
usual, Calkins said. The finalized crop of commercials features a lot of
simple humor, nostalgia and few creative risks, he said. But even that
approach can backfire.</p>
<p>“That’s the challenge this year. Everybody wants to be safe, but you
also want to be interesting,” Calkins said. “Safe advertising isn’t the
advertising you notice or remember.”</p>
<p>And advertisers can’t afford not to be noticed. Some of the roughly
80 Super Bowl ads spots cost a record $8 million for 30 seconds this
year.</p>
<p>Here are some of the themes of this year’s Super Bowl ads:</p>
<p>Heartwarming nostalgia</p>
<p>Budweiser brings back its Clydesdales for its Super Bowl ad,
including a foal that wants to join the delivery team. Meg Ryan and
Billy Crystal reenact their famous scene from 1989’s “When Harry Met
Sally,” except this time Sally is expressing her enthusiasm for
Hellmann’s mayonnaise.</p>
<p>The Muppets search for accommodations with Booking.com, while an
Instacart ad features a parade of familiar mascots like Mr. Clean, the
Jolly Green Giant and the Pillsbury Doughboy. Disney asks what the world
would be like without the iconic characters it owns, like Elsa from
“Frozen,” Bart Simpson and the Marvel superheroes.</p>
<p>Advertisers are leaning on nostalgia more than they used to in Super
Bowl ads, according to Kimberly Whitler, a marketing professor at the
University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business. Nods to the past can
broaden the appeal of an ad to different generations and connect
products to positive cultural moments, she said.</p>
<p>Celebrity mashups</p>
<p>Putting celebrities together in unexpected combinations can also
broaden the appeal of a commercial. In their Super Bowl ad for Michelob
Ultra, actors Catherine O’Hara and Willem Dafoe are pickleball champs.
Soccer star David Beckham and actor Matt Damon are long-lost twins who
bond over Stella Artois. Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay and comedian Pete
Davidson team up for a HexClad commercial, while Post Malone, Shane
Gillis and Peyton Manning have a block party with Bud Light. A slew of
celebrities, including Matthew McConaughey, Martha Stewart, Greta Gerwig
and Charlie XCX, appear in an ad for Uber Eats.</p>
<p>Linli Xu, an associate professor of marketing at the University of
Minnesota’s Carlson School of Management, said celebrity endorsements
can get people talking. But with dozens of brands using them, there’s a
risk of diminishing returns.</p>
<p>Celebrities can also get so much attention that viewers don’t
remember which brand they’re advertising, Xu said.</p>
<p>Serious moments</p>
<p>It isn’t all fun and games at the Super Bowl this year.
Pharmaceutical company Novartis urges women to get early detection for
breast cancer. Dove warns that half of girls who quit sports have been
criticized for their body type. Hims &amp; Hers, a telehealth company,
talks about America’s obesity epidemic.</p>
<p>For the third Super Bowl in a row, Come Near — a nonprofit that
promotes the teachings of Jesus — is running an ad as part of its He
Gets Us campaign. The ad, featuring Johnny Cash’s cover of “Personal
Jesus,” shows everyday people being helpful and heroic. And the
Foundation to Combat Antisemitism, founded by New England Patriots
Chairman and CEO Robert Kraft, has a stark ad featuring Snoop Dogg and
Tom Brady saying what they hate about each other, in an effort to show
how pointless hate is.</p>
<p>Xu said she expected more ads promoting that unifying message. But
for the most part, advertisers went with humor, she said.</p>
<p>“We just had an election year and there’s a lot of discussion around
divisiveness,” she said. “People might be wanting to see some unity,
everybody coming together as a country.”</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence arrives</p>
<p>Several Super Bowl ads make the case for AI as a helpmate. Chris
Pratt, Chris Hemsworth and Kris Jenner team up for an ad wearing Meta ’s
smart glasses, which use artificial intelligence to answer questions
about what wearers are seeing. Actor Walton Goggins pitches GoDaddy
Airo, which uses AI to help build websites and social content. And
Google’s “50 States, 50 Stories” campaign will show viewers a small
business from their state that’s using Google’s Gemini AI assistant. But
Cirkul, a water bottle brand, pokes fun at AI, showing comedian Adam
Devine accidentally ordering 100,000 bottles using the AI assistant on
his phone.</p>

id="westminster-shows-canine-athletes-get-their-piece-of-super-bowl-weekend">Westminster
show’s canine athletes get their piece of Super Bowl weekend</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — They’re at the top of their sport. They run, weave and go
airborne. And they went all out for this weekend’s championship.</p>
<p>Sorry — no, they’re not the Chiefs or the Eagles. They’re the agility
dogs at the Westminster Kennel Club show, which began Saturday by
showcasing agility and other dog sports.</p>
<p>Dog folk often call Westminster the Super Bowl of dog shows, and the
comparison might be especially fitting this year. The United States’
most prestigious canine competition opened on the same weekend as pro
football’s Super Bowl, which features the Kansas City Chiefs and the
Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday. The rare coincidence comes after both
competitions’ dates shifted in recent years.</p>
<p>“I always said I wanted people to call the Super Bowl ‘the
Westminster of football,’” quipped dog expert David Frei, who has a foot
in both worlds: He used to work in publicity for the Denver Broncos and
the San Francisco 49ers.</p>
<p>The Westminster of football? Well, Westminster is 90 years older than
the Super Bowl, after all.</p>
<p>And there have been some other connections between the gridiron and
Westminster’s green carpet. Los Angeles Chargers defensive end Morgan
Fox co-owns a French bulldog who came within a smushy-nose length of
winning at Westminster in 2022 and was a finalist the following year.
(Many other NFL players also have dogs for fun, if not for show,
including Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes.)</p>
<p>Whatever the analogy, being at Westminster was a triumph for Guster
the rescue pug. He and owner Steve Martin took up agility after Guster
started wagging his tail and tilting his head while they watched the
Westminster agility contest on TV several years ago.</p>
<p>“We never thought we’d be here. And now we’re here,” Martin, of
Austin, Texas, said Saturday.</p>
<p>A border collie named Vanish won the contest, which featured about
300 champion-level canines.</p>
<p>“She’s very intuitive, very natural — probably smarter than me,”
handler Emily Klarman of Doylestown, Pennsylvania, told a Fox
interviewer in the ring. While Klarman said the win initially left her
speechless, Vanish had plenty to say, barking enthusiastically.</p>
<p>A special award for the best mixed-breed competitor went to Gable,
handled by Kayla Feeney of Lima, New York.</p>
<p>Westminster added agility in 2014, marking the show’s first event
with mixed-breed dogs since the 1800s. Last year saw the first
mixed-breed agility winner, a border collie-papillon mix named Nimble,
who competed again this year.</p>
<p>She’s an intentional blend of two top agility breeds. But the sport
also draws rescue dogs such as an Australian cattle dog mix named
Sawyer, or Soy Sauce for short.</p>
<p>His owner, Dr. Amy Ondeyka, has a complicated work schedule as a New
Jersey emergency room doctor and EMS medical director. But she made time
for agility after realizing she’d adopted a super-energetic dog who
opens cabinets, unzips things and otherwise causes domestic mayhem when
bored.</p>
<p>“He’s always exciting — he does ridiculous things,” Ondeyka said as
he intermittently leaped into her arms during what was ostensibly down
time between agility runs. “We have fun, regardless what happens.”</p>
<p>While some dogs do agility to burn off energy, the sport helps others
come out of their shell. Tully, a lanky, shaggy, mostly Labradoodle mix,
used to be “afraid of the world” but now is excited to go to agility
classes and competitions, owner Carla Rash said.</p>
<p>Saturday’s competitors were a spectrum of dogdom, from a great Dane
to a 7-pound (0.9-kilogramg) papillon, and they included such
lesser-known breeds as a large Munsterlander and a Danish-Swedish
farmdog.</p>
<p>They navigated jumps, tunnels, ramps and other obstacles as handlers
gave hand and voice signals. The object is to be the fastest, without
making mistakes.</p>
<p>Regardless of scores, some dogs won cheers from spectators. There was
a bichon frise with its tail dyed blue, a standard poodle that took a
leisurely trot across an A-frame ramp, and a curly-coated mix that
apparently had second thoughts about the weave poles, circled around and
went through them again.</p>
<p>Westminster’s traditional, breed-by-breed judging happens Monday and
Tuesday, capped by the coveted best in show prize Tuesday night.</p>
<p>That’s for purebreds only, but mixed-breed dogs also were eligible
for Saturday’s obedience competition, an event that Westminster added in
2016. The top prize went to Willie, an Australian shepherd who also won
in 2022 with handler Kathleen Keller of Flemington, New Jersey.</p>
<p>Steve Wesler sported a Philadelphia Eagles sweatshirt as he cheered
on partner Jennifer Weinik and Cookie, her Belgian Malinois. They came
away with a ribbon, which Wesler deemed more exciting than the Super
Bowl — because he was confident the Eagles would prevail.</p>
<p>There are no cash prizes at Westminster, but the agility and
obedience winners each get to direct a $5,000 donation to a training
club or the American Kennel Club Humane Fund.</p>
<p>The show also featured Westminster’s first demonstration of flyball,
a canine relay race that involves retrieving a ball.</p>
<p>“It’s a lot of organized chaos,” Hillary Brown said after competing
with her Boston terrier, Paxil. His teammates on a York,
Pennsylvania-based squad called Clean Break were a standard poodle, a
border collie and a whippet-border collie mix.</p>
<p>“It’s a blast. The dogs love it,” Brown said.</p>

id="trump-to-announce-25-steel-aluminum-tariffs-in-latest-trade-escalation">Trump
to announce 25% steel, aluminum tariffs in latest trade escalation</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE — U.S. President Donald Trump said Sunday that
he will announce on Monday new 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum
imports into the U.S., which would come on top of existing metals duties
in another major escalation of his trade policy overhaul.</p>
<p>Trump, speaking to reporters on Air Force One, also said he will
announce reciprocal tariffs Tuesday or Wednesday, to take effect almost
immediately.</p>
<p>Trump, during his first term, imposed tariffs of 25% on steel and 10%
on aluminum, but later granted several trading partners duty-free
quotas, including Canada, Mexico and Brazil.</p>
<p>Former President Joe Biden extended these quotas to Britain, Japan
and the European Union, and U.S. steel mill capacity utilization has
dropped in recent years.</p>
<p>White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said that the new tariffs
would come on top of the existing duties on steel and aluminum.</p>
<p>Trump on Friday announced that he would impose reciprocal tariffs —
raising U.S. tariff rates to match those of trading partners — on many
countries this week. He did not identify the countries, but the duties
would be imposed “so that we’re treated evenly with other
countries.”</p>

id="chiefs-chase-super-bowl-three-peat-as-trump-attends-nfl-showpiece">Chiefs
chase Super Bowl ‘three-peat’ as Trump attends NFL showpiece</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New Orleans, Louisiana — The Kansas City Chiefs aim for a historic
hat-trick of Super Bowl titles on Sunday when they take on the
Philadelphia Eagles in front of a star-studded crowd in New Orleans
headed by U.S. President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Trump will become the first sitting president ever to attend the NFL
showpiece when he takes his seat among a sell-out crowd of around 74,000
fans at the Superdome for the biggest annual event in the American
sporting calendar, which kicks off at 5:30pm local time (2330 GMT).</p>
<p>Pop superstar Taylor Swift will also be in the VIP seats to watch as
her boyfriend Travis Kelce and his fellow Chiefs bid to become the first
team in history to lift three consecutive Vince Lombardi Trophies.</p>
<p>Trump’s presence at the NFL showpiece will mean even tighter security
than normal around an event which was already bolstered by a heavy
police presence following a New Year’s Day attack which left 14 people
dead and many more injured on the Big Easy’s famous Bourbon Street.</p>
<p>Trump has had a strained relationship with the NFL stretching back
several decades, and triggered uproar during his first time in 2017 when
he attacked the patriotism of players who kneeled during the playing of
the U.S. national anthem in a protest against racial injustice.</p>
<p>Speaking in a pre-game interview aired on Fox News, Trump said his
decision to attend this year’s Super Bowl was for the good of the
country.</p>
<p>“I thought it would be a good thing for the country to have the
President be at the game,” Trump told Fox.</p>
<p>“It’s an iconic day. It’s going to be a great game, two great teams,
and let’s see what happens,” Trump added, revealing that he was tipping
Kansas City for victory, citing the record of Chiefs quarterback Patrick
Mahomes, who is eyeing his fourth Super Bowl win.</p>
<p>“When a quarterback wins as much as he’s won, I have to go with
Kansas City,” Trump said. “I have to go with Kansas City.”</p>
<p>Trump was due to fly into New Orleans from Florida, where he
reportedly played a round of golf with Tiger Woods earlier Sunday. A
schedule released by the White House said he is expected to leave the
Superdome at around 8.05pm local time, well before the game reaches its
conclusion.</p>
<p>Super Bowl fans on Sunday welcomed Trump’s attendance at the
game.</p>
<p>“I think it is awesome, congratulations to him for being the first
President to make it,” Bob Benderovich, a Philadelphia Eagles fan from
Fort Myers, Florida, told AFP.</p>
<p>Chiefs favorites</p>
<p>As always, the Super Bowl crosses over into popular culture and the
half-time show this year will feature hip-hop artist Kendrick Lamar, who
had a clean sweep at last Sunday’s Grammys, winning in all five
categories for which he received nominations.</p>
<p>Bookmakers and casinos meanwhile are taking odds on whether Chiefs
star Kelce will propose to pop icon Swift after what might be his final
game in the NFL.</p>
<p>For the more serious punters, the oddsmakers have the Chiefs as
slight favorite for the game, a rematch of the Super Bowl from two years
ago which the Chiefs won by three points.</p>
<p>They defended their title last year, beating the San Francisco 49ers
in Las Vegas and putting them one win away from an unprecedented
“three-peat.”</p>
<p>The 29-year-old Mahomes will become one of just four quarterbacks in
National Football League history to have won more than three Super Bowls
should he triumph again, having first led the Chiefs to Super Bowl glory
in 2020.</p>
<p>But the Eagles have added serious offensive firepower since their
defeat two years ago with mobile quarterback Jalen Hurts joined by the
game-changing speed and power of running back Saquon Barkley.</p>
<p>The Chiefs put the finishing touches to their game preparations
Saturday with a 30-minute walkthrough of a mock game.</p>
<p>Chiefs coach Andy Reid saluted his team’s attitude to training over
the whole week since arriving in Louisiana.</p>
<p>“I thought the guys worked hard, they got done what they needed to
get done,” Reid said.</p>
<p>The Eagles had a similarly relaxed final session before going to the
Superdome on Saturday for a team photo.</p>
<p>Head coach Nick Sirianni said his Eagles were “hungry” and “ready to
roll.”</p>
<p>“We’re ready for the challenge against a really good team,” Sirianni
said.</p>

id="trump-official-orders-consumer-protection-agency-to-stop-work">Trump
official orders consumer protection agency to stop work</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The Trump administration has ordered the Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau to stop nearly all its work, effectively
shutting down an agency that was created to protect consumers after the
2008 financial crisis and subprime mortgage-lending scandal. </p>
<p>Russell Vought, the newly installed director of the Office of
Management and Budget, directed the CFPB, in a Saturday night email
confirmed by The Associated Press, to stop work on proposed rules, to
suspend the effective dates on any rules that were finalized but not yet
effective, and to stop investigative work and not begin any new
investigations. The agency has been a target of conservatives since
President Barack Obama pushed to include it in the 2010 financial reform
legislation that followed the 2007-2008 financial crisis. </p>
<p>The email also ordered the bureau to “cease all supervision and
examination activity.” </p>
<p>Since the CFPB is a creation of Congress, it would require a separate
act of Congress to formally eliminate it. But the head of the agency has
discretion over what enforcement actions to take, if any. </p>
<p>Yet Elon Musk commented, “CFPB RIP” on social media site X on Friday.
And the CFPB homepage on the Internet was down Sunday, replaced by a
message reading “page not found.” </p>
<p>Also late Saturday, Vought said in a social media post that the CFPB
would not withdraw its next round of funding from the Federal Reserve,
adding that its current reserves of $711.6 million are “excessive.”
Congress directed the bureau to be funded by the Fed to insulate it from
political pressures. </p>
<p>“This spigot, long contributing to CFPB’s unaccountability, is now
being turned off,” Vought said on X. </p>
<p>The CFPB says that it has obtained nearly $20 billion in financial
relief for U.S. consumers since its founding in the form of canceled
debts, compensation, and reduced loans. Last month, the bureau sued
Capital One for allegedly misleading consumers about its offerings for
high-interest savings accounts — and “cheating” customers out of more
than $2 billion in lost interest payments as a result. </p>
<p>Dennis Kelleher, president of Better Markets, an advocacy group,
said, “that’s why Wall Street’s biggest banks and Trump’s billionaire
allies hate the bureau: it’s an effective cop on the finance beat and
has stood side-by-side with hundreds of millions of Americans —
Republicans and Democrats — battling financial predators, scammers, and
crooks.” </p>
<p>The administration’s move against the CFPB also highlights the
tensions between Trump’s more populist promises to lower costs for
working-class families and his pledge to reduce government
regulation. </p>
<p>During the campaign, Trump said he would cap credit card interest
rates at 10%, after they had soared to record levels above 20%, on
average, as the Federal Reserve lifted interest rates in 2022 and 2023.
The CFPB had started work on how that proposal would be
implemented. </p>
<p>The bureau can still take complaints, but it can’t conduct exams or
pursue existing investigations, according to a person familiar with the
agency who insisted on anonymity to discuss CFPB business. The memo is
also interpreted as blocking it from communicating with companies it
regulates, consumer advocates or other outside groups. </p>
<p>Musk’s team would also have access to complaints, investigations and
regulatory oversight data. The access raises uncomfortable questions if
Musk’s company X launches a payments system as the CFPB has data on
competitors such as Cash App, the person said. </p>
<p>Vought’s email follows a similar directive from Treasury Secretary
Scott Bessent Feb. 3 and is the latest move by the Trump administration
to rapidly curtail the work of federal agencies that they have deemed
excessive. </p>
<p>Obama spearheaded the creation of the bureau in the wake of the
2007-2008 housing bubble and financial crisis, which was caused in part
by fraudulent mortgage lending. It was the brainchild of Massachusetts
Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren and has attracted lawsuits from large
banks and financial industry trade associations. </p>
<p>“Vought is giving big banks and giant corporations the green light to
scam families,” Warren said. </p>
<p>Last week, Warren called on Trump to work with the bureau to protect
Americans from de-banking, the practice of banks shutting down customer
accounts because they believe they pose financial, legal or reputational
risks to the banks. </p>
<p>Vought’s email said that President Donald Trump had made him acting
director of the CFPB on Friday. Trump fired the previous director of the
bureau, Rohit Chopra, on Feb. 1. Vought was an architect of Project
2025, a policy blueprint for the Trump White House that Trump tried to
disavow during last year’s campaign. </p>
<p>Under Chopra, the CFPB approved rules to cap overdraft fees by banks,
limit junk fees, and has proposed restrictions on data brokers selling
personal information such as Social Security numbers.</p>

id="white-house-defends-efforts-to-shut-down-foreign-aid-agency">White
House defends efforts to shut down foreign aid agency</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>White House national security adviser Michael Waltz on Sunday
defended President Donald Trump’s plan to shut down the country’s chief
foreign aid agency, contending that “all too often” it was not aligned
with U.S. strategic interests and wastes money.</p>
<p>Waltz told NBC’s “Meet the Press” that the U.S. Agency for
International Development programs, often food and humanitarian
assistance across the world, “are not in line with strategic U.S.
interests like pushing back on China. They’re doing all kinds of other
things that frankly, aren’t in line with strategic interests or the
president’s vision.”</p>
<p>Moreover, he said, “Often, all too often, only cents on the dollar
actually makes it to people in need, between the big contractors, the
subcontractors, the local contractors, the dollars aren’t being used …
wisely. We need to take a hard look at it. We need to move quickly, and
that’s exactly what’s being done.”.”</p>
<p>Trump this past week ordered the 10,000-worker agency shut down with
fewer than 300 of them expected to eventually be retained as the
agency’s programs are either shifted to State Department control or
terminated.</p>
<p>A federal judge in Washington on Friday ordered a temporary halt to
plans to pull thousands of USAID staffers off the job.</p>
<p>On the same day, workers pried the name of the agency letter by
letter off the entryway of its headquarters in Washington.</p>
<p>Democrats in Congress have been critical of the changes regarding
USAID, with some pledging to stall Trump’s Cabinet nominees and leverage
their votes on a new government spending bill, in protest.</p>
<p>The effort to shut down USAID was the most visible result of Trump
dispatching billionaire Elon Musk and his aides to review programs and
the legitimacy of spending at dozens of federal government agencies.</p>
<p>Trump offered virtually all the government’s 2.3 million civilian
workers a chance to resign and continue to get paid through Sept. 30
without working, but a federal judge paused the offer until he holds a
new hearing Monday afternoon on its legality.</p>
<p>The White House said 65,000 workers, 2.8% of the government’s
civilian workforce, accepted the offer to quit and be paid not to work,
far fewer than the 5- to 10% figure Musk and his cost cutters were
hoping for.</p>
<p>Trump said all government agencies would be subject to financial
reviews, including one of the biggest targets, the Defense Department,
where Musk has billions of dollars of contracts.</p>
<p>Waltz said a review of Pentagon spending was especially
necessary.</p>
<p>“Everything there seems to cost too much, take too long and deliver
too little to the soldiers… we do need great minds, and we do need
business leaders to go in there and absolutely reform the Pentagon’s
acquisition process,” he said.</p>
<p>Waltz, a former congressman from the southern state of Florida, said,
“I, as a member of the House Armed Services Committee, held up a bag of
bolts that would cost 100 bucks … in a hardware store, that cost $90,000
to the United States Air Force and the American people have said enough,
enough with the bloat and the waste….”</p>
<p>“For our barracks and our soldiers, we need all the efficiency we can
get in the Pentagon, and I think the American people and the soldiers
will welcome” a spending review, he said.”</p>
<p>On another matter, Waltz said “sensitive conversations” are occurring
on how to end Russia’s nearly three-year war on Ukraine.</p>
<p>“We will have our secretary of state, our secretary of defense, our
vice president, our special envoy in Europe this week talking through
the details of how to end this war,” Waltz said. “And that means getting
both sides (to) the table.”</p>
<p>Waltz said the discussions would include future U.S. aid to Ukraine,
possibly in exchange for Kyiv supplying the U.S. with its rare earth
minerals — necessary for the manufacture of high-tech goods.</p>
<p>“Those conversations are going to happen this week. And I think an
underlying principle here is that the Europeans have to own this
conflict going forward,” Waltz said. “President Trump is going to end
it. And then in terms of security guarantees, that is squarely going to
be with the Europeans.”</p>

<h2 id="dog-man-bests-heart-eyes-love-hurts-at-box-office">‘Dog Man’
bests ‘Heart Eyes,’ ‘Love Hurts’ at box office</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — On a quiet winter weekend at the box office, DreamWorks
Animation’s “Dog Man” chased its own tail, repeating as the top movie in
theaters. </p>
<p>The animated Universal Pictures release, adapted from Dav Pilkey’s
popular graphic novel series, collected $13.7 million in ticket sales,
according to studio estimates Sunday. Both new releases — the Ke Huy
Quan action movie “Love Hurts” and the Valentine’s Day-themed slasher
“Heart Eyes”— were left nipping at the heels of “Dog Man.” </p>
<p>Hollywood often largely punts Super Bowl weekend to the small screen.
Last year, Apple’s much-derided “Argylle” debuted on the same weekend.
Instead, the movie industry spends more energy pitching its blockbusters
in trailers for the huge football audience on TV. </p>
<p>It wasn’t a banner weekend for “Dog Man.” It fell steeply, dropping
62% in it second weekend. But with a production budget of $40 million,
“Dog Man” has already tallied $54.1 million domestically in two
weeks. </p>
<p>Coming in second was Spyglass Media Group’s “Heart Eyes,” released by
Sony. The horror-rom-com mashup earned $8.5 million from 3,102
locations. Reviews have been good for the film, directed by Josh Ruben
and starring Oliva Holt and Mason Gooding, though audiences were less
impressed. Moviegoers gave it a “B-” CinemaScore. Spyglass made “Heart
Eyes” for $18 million. </p>
<p>“Love Hurts,” the action comedy from 87North Productions (“John
Wick,” “The Fall Guy”), debuted with a paltry $5.8 million in 3,055
theaters. In his first big movie role since his Oscar-winning comeback
in “Everything All at Once,” Ke Huy Quan stars as a mild-mannered
realtor with a hitman past. Ariana DeBose co-stars. It, too, was
modestly budgeted at $18 million. Audiences, however, mostly rejected
the movie, giving “Love Hurts” a “C+” CinemaScore. </p>
<p>Next weekend should bring Hollywood its biggest box-office weekend of
the year with the release of Marvel’s “Captain America: Brave New World”
and Sony’s “Paddington in Peru.” </p>
<p>Final domestic figures will be released Monday. Estimated ticket
sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according
to Comscore: </p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>“Dog Man,” $13.7 million. </p></li>

egg prices in US pique interest in backyard chickens</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Thinking about backyard chickens as egg prices soar? Think
hard, especially in light of the bird flu outbreak.</p>
<p>Keeping home chickens as a pastime has continued to grow since the
pandemic. But if eggs are the goal, remember that it takes planning and
investment to raise the chickens and protect against bird flu. Costs
might go well beyond the nationwide average of $4.15 a dozen that
commercial eggs sold for in December.</p>
<p>“Anyone who’s done an ounce of research will very quickly understand
that there are no free eggs, there are no inexpensive eggs in keeping
chickens,” said Kathy Shea Mormino, a home chicken blogger and author
who has about 50 of the birds at her Suffield, Connecticut, home.</p>
<p>“You’re going to pay more, particularly in your first several years,
in your setup and in your birds. And there’s a huge learning curve on
how to care for animals that are really unusual pets,” said Mormino, who
has kept chickens for 15 years and calls herself the Chicken Chick.</p>
<p>Costs vary wildly, from about $200 to $2,000 for a coop alone.
Feeders and waterers range from about $8 to $50 or more, depending on
the size and type.</p>
<p>Bird flu has forced farmers to slaughter millions of chickens a
month, contributing (along with inflation) to the steep price of
commercial eggs and resulting in some scantily stocked stores around the
country. The scarcity and high prices are causing some to look for a
backyard alternative.</p>
<p>“We’ve seen a real uptick in calls recently from people wanting to
start their own backyard flocks. With the egg shortages at grocery
stores, many are excited about the idea of raising chickens and taking
steps toward sustainability,” said Matthew Aversa, a co-owner of Winding
Branch Ranch, a nonprofit sanctuary and farm animal rescue outside San
Antonio.</p>
<p>“We adopt out whole flocks. We’re receiving at least a dozen
inquiries per week,” he said.</p>
<p>Kate Perz, the animal science coordinator for Cornell Cooperative
Extension of Suffolk County, New York, said that unlike other pandemic
pastimes, raising home chickens has only grown.</p>
<p>“It’s not always cost-effective,” she said. “You have to really look
at how many eggs you’re eating and what the cost of those are versus
what you would be spending.”</p>
<p>There are other reasons, of course, to keep chickens at home, not the
least of which is the sheer joy of their presence. Mormino and other
“chickeneers,” as she calls home enthusiasts, have a coop full of tips
on how to get started.</p>
<p>Tend to legal matters</p>
<p>You may be ready to dive right in. Your town may not. Mormino, who
wrote The Chicken Chick’s Guide to Backyard Chickens, said the first
thing to consider is whether chickens are right for you. After that,
don’t assume your county, town or city will allow it.</p>
<p>Look up zoning and building codes yourself if you feel capable.
Otherwise, consult an attorney who specializes in municipal law in your
area.</p>
<p>Don’t rely on word of mouth or even a town worker to know the ins and
outs. Is a building permit required to build a coop? Are roosters banned
under noise ordinances? Sometimes, zoning codes are silent on the
subject. Don’t assume that’s a green light. Many codes are “permissive
use” regulations, Mormino said, essentially meaning that if the code
doesn’t say you’re permitted, you’re not!</p>
<p>If chicken-keeping is allowed, is there a limit on how many birds?
Are there restrictions on where a coop can be built in relation to
neighboring property lines. Most homeowners associations have rules on
animal keeping.</p>
<p>Mormino lives in a farming town and had a neighbor who kept three
horses and a small flock of chickens, so she assumed they were legal.
They weren’t. She called the town clerk’s office to ask whether a
building permit was required to build a coop and was told it wasn’t. It
was.</p>
<p>In the end, she successfully defended a lawsuit against her (she’s an
attorney) and prevailed in a long battle to amend the law, legalizing
backyard chickens in her town.</p>
<p>What about bird flu?</p>
<p>Bird flu is highly contagious. It spreads mostly by migrating
waterfowl in their droppings. Chickens are far from immune if they spend
any time free ranging or in a run without protection from wild fowl
droppings.</p>
<p>“There’s a limited number of things that we can do because our birds
live where wildlife live,” Mormino said. “People need to know if they
have a bird or birds that die suddenly from some of the symptoms, they
need to contact the USDA to get the postmortem exam and the birds tested
for bird flu.”</p>
<p>Don’t bring sick birds into the house for care. That raises the risk
of transmission to humans. Once the virus is confirmed, the entire flock
needs to be euthanized, she and Perz said.</p>
<p>Symptoms of bird flu include: sudden death without any clinical
signs; swelling of the head, eyelids, comb, wattles or hocks; diarrhea;
stumbling or falling down; decreased egg production and/or soft-shelled
or misshapen eggs; and coughing and sneezing.</p>
<p>Don’t feed any wildlife in areas where your chickens dwell or roam.
Wash hands thoroughly after tending to chickens and dedicate a pair of
shoes or boots strictly for use around them.</p>
<p>“The biggest mistake backyard chickeneers make is to bring new
chickens into their flock that have lived someplace else. That’s the
fastest way to bring disease into your chicken yard,” Mormino said.</p>
<p>Consider your costs</p>
<p>Sarah Penny has turned her 7,000-square-foot home lot in Knoxville,
Tennessee, into a beautiful garden and chicken home. She has nine birds
and grows more than half the food she and her 13-year-old son eat.</p>
<p>She’s had chickens since 2021 and estimates her startup costs at
about $2,500.</p>
<p>Monthly costs vary based on what chickens are fed and how coops are
kept. Penny, for instance, uses the deep litter method and composts from
her coop, meaning she’s not mucking out her coop more than twice a
year.</p>
<p>“But the cost of starting with backyard chickens is definitely quite
expensive. I don’t know if a lot of people know that,” Penny said.</p>
<p>Her coop alone, which her family built themselves, cost about $2,000.
It had to be outfitted to keep predators out, including rats that tunnel
under the ground.</p>
<p>Many people start with buying hatchlings, which just got more
expensive to ship via the U.S. Postal Service due to new fees. Raising
hatchlings requires a chick brooder involving a separate enclosure, heat
lamp, feeders and other supplies.</p>
<p>Penny buys a bag of feed every two weeks for $15 to $20 a bag.
There’s also the cost of calcium, such as oyster shells, and grit to aid
digestion if chickens are not free-ranging or getting those elements in
their feed.</p>
<p>She estimates her monthly costs at about $60, saving a bit by also
feeding her chickens healthy human leftovers. She’s careful not to
include foods that are toxic for chickens, including onions, potatoes
and avocados.</p>
<p>It’s all worth it to Penny.</p>
<p>“We eat a lot of eggs,” she said. “We probably go through a dozen
every two days. We bake a lot. We’re an ingredient household, so the
majority of our food is cooked from scratch. Eggs are a main staple for
our breakfast.”</p>

id="high-home-prices-and-mortgage-rates-put-american-dream-out-of-reach-for-many">High
home prices and mortgage rates put American dream out of reach for
many</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The Petersen family’s two-bedroom apartment in northern California is
starting to feel small.</p>
<p>Four-year-old Jerrik’s toy monster trucks are everywhere in the
1,100-square-foot unit in Campbell, just outside of San Jose. And it’s
only a matter of time before 9-month-old Carolynn starts amassing more
toys, adding to the disarray, said her mother, Jenn Petersen.</p>
<p>The 42-year-old chiropractor had hoped she and her husband, Steve, a
39-year-old dental hygienist, would have bought a house by now. But when
they can afford a bigger place, it will have to be another rental.
Petersen has done the math: With mortgage rates and home prices
stubbornly high, there’s no way the couple, who make about $270,000 a
year and pay about $2,500 in monthly rent, can afford a home anywhere in
their area.</p>
<p>According to October data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, a
San Jose family with a median income of $156,700 would need to spend 80%
of their income on housing — including an $8,600 monthly mortgage
payment — to own a median-priced $1.54 million home. That’s far higher
than the general rule of thumb that people should pay no more than 30%
of their income on a mortgage or rent.</p>
<p>Moving out of state is out of the question for the Petersens — they
have strong family ties to the area and their income would plummet if
they move to a lower cost-of-living area. “I’m not willing to give up my
job and close connections with my family for a house,” Petersen
said.</p>
<p>The issue is widespread and near historic highs nationally: As of
last fall, the median homeowner in the U.S. was paying 42% of their
income on homeownership costs, according to the Atlanta Fed. Four years
ago, that percentage was 28% and had not previously reached 38% since
late 2007, just before the housing market crash.</p>
<p>“The American dream, as our parents knew it, doesn’t exist anymore,”
Petersen said. “The whole idea that you get a house after you graduate
college, get a steady job and get married? I’ve done most of those
milestones. But the homeownership part? That just doesn’t fit
financially.”</p>
<p>Supply lags demand</p>
<p>First-time homeowners are getting older. The same is true for an
increasing number of American families.</p>
<p>In 2024, the median first-time homebuyer was 38 years old, a jump
from age 35 the previous year, according to a recent report by the
National Association of Realtors. That’s significantly above historic
norms, when median first-time buyers hovered between 30 and 32 years old
from 1993 to 2018.</p>
<p>The biggest driver of this trend, experts said, is simple: There are
far too few houses on the market to match pent-up demand, driving prices
past the point of affordability for many people who are relatively early
in their careers. Coupled with high mortgage rates, many have concluded
that renting is their only option.</p>
<p>“Wage growth hasn’t kept up with the increase in home prices and
interest rates,” said Domonic Purviance, who studies housing at the
Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta in Atlanta, Georgia. “Even though people
are making more money, home prices are increasing at a faster rate.”</p>
<p>That gap has left many out of the housing market, which for
generations has been a way for Americans to build equity and wealth that
they can pass down or leverage to buy a larger home. It’s also led to
widespread worries about housing in the United States. About 7 in 10
voters under age 45 said they were “very” concerned about the cost of
housing in their community, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of more
than 120,000 voters in the 2024 election.</p>
<p>Is the dream going to fade?</p>
<p>Brian McCabe, a sociology professor at Georgetown University, said he
frequently tells his students that “there are few things that all
Americans agree on, but one of them is that they’d rather own a home
than rent.”</p>
<p>McCabe said homeownership, especially as a wealth-building tool, is
the right move for many, especially if the owner intends to be in one
place for a long time. But he also said many are realizing that not
owning a home has its advantages, too — it gives people more flexibility
to move and allows them to live in exciting neighborhoods they would not
be able to afford to buy property in.</p>
<p>McCabe said millennials are getting married later, having children
later, have a stronger desire to stay in cities and, especially due to
remote work, value the flexibility of being able to move with ease — all
of which he said could prompt an end to the notion that homeownership is
the “apex of the American dream.”</p>
<p>“The big question is whether we see the sheen of homeownership start
to fade,” McCabe said. “It’s such an interesting cultural marker: Why is
owning a home the pinnacle for so many people?”</p>
<p>It’s a question Petersen wrestles with because she knows any
three-bedroom home she found in her area would leave her family “house
poor.”</p>
<p>“I used to subscribe to the idea that owning a house is just a
natural milestone you have to reach,” she said. “At some point, though,
what are you sacrificing by just owning a house and gaining equity? I
want to be able to travel with my kids. I want to be able to sign them
up for extracurriculars. How are we supposed to do that if we’re paying
a mortgage that’s most of our take-home pay?”</p>
<p>Petersen said she’ll “always hold out a little bit of hope” that
homeownership will be in her family’s future. But if they find a
townhouse to rent that has space for her kids and fits within their
$3,600 monthly rental budget?</p>
<p>“I’d take that,” she said.</p>
<p>Cities offer support</p>
<p>Some cities are providing crucial aid to first-time homebuyers</p>
<p>Lifelong Boston resident Julieta Lopez, 63, spent decades hoping to
buy a home but watched as prices became increasingly out of reach.</p>
<p>“The prices in Boston just got higher and higher and higher and
higher,” said Lopez, who works for the city traffic department issuing
tickets for parking violations.</p>
<p>Two years ago, furious to learn that her subsidized apartment’s
monthly rent was being hiked to $2,900, Lopez, who earns about $60,000
annually, took out her phone and began searching for government programs
that help first-time homebuyers. She was determined to finally own her
own place.</p>
<p>Within months, she had succeeded. Lopez qualified to receive $50,000
from the local Massachusetts Affordable Homeownership Alliance nonprofit
and another $50,000 from the city of Boston’s Office of Housing — funds
that helped her with a down payment on the $430,000 two-bedroom
condominium she shares with her 30-year-old son. She now pays about
$2,160 a month on her mortgage.</p>
<p>Lopez knows she is lucky the city has placed such a focus on aiding
first-time buyers like herself — Boston has poured more than $24 million
into its homeownership assistance programs since Mayor Michelle Wu took
office in 2021, helping nearly 700 residents get their first homes.</p>
<p>But Lopez also feels proud to have her own place after years of
working — doing jobs that included everything from telecommunications to
health care to electronics.</p>
<p>“I was determined to have my piece of the pie,” she said. “I felt I
deserved that. I’ve always worked. Always. Nonstop.”</p>

id="japan-prime-minister-voices-optimism-over-averting-us-tariffs">Japan
prime minister voices optimism over averting US tariffs</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>TOKYO — Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba expressed optimism on
Sunday that his country could avoid higher U.S. tariffs, saying
President Donald Trump had recognized Japan’s huge investment in the
U.S. and the American jobs that it creates.</p>
<p>At his first White House summit on Friday, Ishiba told public
broadcaster NHK, he explained to Trump how many Japanese automakers were
creating jobs in the United States.</p>
<p>The two did not specifically discuss auto tariffs, Ishiba said,
although he said he did not know whether Japan would be subject to the
reciprocal tariffs that Trump has said he plans to impose on
imports.</p>
<p>Tokyo has so far escaped the trade war Trump unleashed in his first
weeks in office. He has announced tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico
and China, although he postponed the 25% duties on his North American
neighbors to allow for talks.</p>
<p>The escalating trade tensions since Trump returned to the White House
on Jan. 20 threaten to rupture the global economy.</p>
<p>Ishiba said he believes Trump “recognized the fact Japan has been the
world’s largest investor in the United States for five straight years
and is therefore different from other countries.”</p>
<p>“Japan is creating many U.S. jobs. I believe (Washington) won’t go
straight to the idea of higher tariffs,” he said.</p>
<p>Ishiba voiced optimism that Japan and the U.S. can avoid a
tit-for-tat tariff war, stressing that tariffs should be put in place in
a way that “benefits both sides.”</p>
<p>“Any action that exploits or excludes the other side won’t last,”
Ishiba said. “The question is whether there is any problem between Japan
and the United States that warrants imposing higher tariffs,” he
added. </p>
<p>Japan had the highest foreign direct investment in the United States
in 2023 at $783.3 billion, followed by Canada and Germany, according to
the most recent U.S. Commerce Department data.</p>
<p>Trump pressed Ishiba to close Japan’s $68.5 billion annual trade
surplus with Washington but expressed optimism this could be done
quickly, given a promise by Ishiba to bring Japanese investment in the
U.S. to $1 trillion.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Ishiba identified liquefied natural gas, steel, AI and
autos as areas that Japanese companies could invest in.</p>
<p>He also touched on Trump’s promise to look at Nippon Steel investing
in U.S. Steel as opposed to buying the storied American company, a
planned purchase opposed by Trump and blocked by his predecessor, Joe
Biden.</p>
<p>“Investment is being made to ensure that it remains an American
company. It will continue to operate under American management, with
American employees,” Ishiba said. “The key point is how to ensure it
remains an American company. From President Trump’s perspective, this is
of utmost importance.”</p>
<p>On military spending, another area where Trump has pressed allies for
increases, Ishiba said Japan would not increase its defense budget
without first winning public backing.</p>
<p>“It is crucial to ensure that what is deemed necessary is something
the taxpayers can understand and support,” he said.</p>

<p>Historical precedent, legal questions swirl around Trump plan to
detain migrants at Guantanamo</p>
<p>The Trump administration’s expansion of migrant detention facilities,
notably its use of the U.S. naval station at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, has
reignited debate among human rights advocates and legal experts. VOA’s
immigration Aline Barros reports.</p>
<p>What is birthright citizenship?</p>
<p>President Donald Trump is reigniting a fierce debate: Should everyone
born on U.S. soil automatically become a citizen? This question strikes
at the heart of American identity, history and law. Trump signed an
executive order last month seeking to end the right, but two federal
judges have placed injunctions on the order, pausing it indefinitely.
Here’s what you need to know about birthright citizenship.</p>
<p>Rubio visiting Costa Rica, Guatemala on trip focused on migration,
security ties</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio met Tuesday with officials in
Costa Rica and later in Guatemala as part of a tour of Latin America
focused on migration, security cooperation and countering Chinese
influence in the region. Rubio was in El Salvador for talks Monday with
President Nayib Bukele, and he announced that Bukele had offered to
accept any deportees from the United States, regardless of their
nationality. Reported by VOA’s State Department Correspondent Nike
Ching.</p>
<p>California city breaks with state on shielding undocumented
migrants</p>
<p>U.S. Border Patrol agents are detaining undocumented migrants as part
of President Donald Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration. Many of
those arrests have been in California, where one city is trying to break
with the state and cooperate with federal immigration agencies. Genia
Dulot reports from Huntington Beach.</p>
<p>10 ‘high-threat illegal aliens’ arrive at Guantanamo Bay</p>
<p>The first undocumented migrants — described by U.S. officials as the
“the worst of the worst” — are being held in jail cells at the U.S.
detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, waiting to be sent home. The
Pentagon on Wednesday confirmed 10 “high-threat illegal aliens” arrived
Tuesday at the detention facility, where they are being held under the
watch of officers with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
Carla Babb, VOA’s Pentagon correspondent, and Jeff Seldin, VOA’s
national security correspondent, report.</p>
<p>Trump’s birthright citizenship order put on hold by 2nd federal
judge</p>
<p>A U.S. federal judge ordered a second temporary pause Wednesday on
President Donald Trump’s executive order seeking to end birthright
citizenship for anyone born in the United States to someone in the
country illegally. U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman said no court in
the country has endorsed the Trump administration’s interpretation of
the 14th Amendment. “This court will not be the first,” she said. The
Associated Press reports.</p>
<p>Trump administration moves to end deportation protections for 348,000
Venezuelans</p>
<p>U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Monday moved to
remove protection against deportation from hundreds of thousands of
Venezuelans in the U.S., part of President Donald Trump’s expanding
immigration crackdown. The decision means about 348,000 Venezuelans with
Temporary Protected Status, more than half of all Venezuelans in the
program, could be deported and lose work permits in April, according to
a government notice. The notice said the protections were contrary to
U.S. interests and no longer justified by conditions in Venezuela.
Reuters reports.</p>
<p>Afghan refugees in California seek clarity amid illegal immigration
crackdowns</p>
<p>Afghan refugees in the United States are expressing concern about
their status as the Trump administration cracks down on illegal
immigration. In California, immigration lawyers are stepping in to
address these concerns and clarify the potential effects on their
status. Fahim Sediqi reports from Sacramento, California, narrated by
Bezhan Hamdard.</p>
<p>Immigration around the world</p>
<p>Darfuri women face sexual violence in war, refuge</p>
<p>Aid groups say sexual violence is a constant threat for women in
Sudan’s Darfur, but refugees also say it’s a problem for those who have
fled the region. Reporting from a refugee camp on Chad’s border with
Darfur, Henry Wilkins looks at the phenomenon of “firewood rape.”

<p>US deportation flight carrying undocumented Indian migrants lands in
Punjab</p>
<p>A U.S. deportation flight carrying Indian nationals accused of
entering the U.S. illegally landed in the northern state of Punjab on
Wednesday – the first such flight to India since the Trump
administration launched a crackdown on undocumented immigrants. The
military aircraft, which landed amid tight security, brought 104
deportees, according to media reports. Authorities did not confirm the
number, but said the deportees will be received in a friendly manner.

aid river search for debris from plane-helicopter collision</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Crews continuing to search for debris from the deadly collision of a
passenger jet and Army helicopter near Washington used a plane outfitted
with lasers to scan the bottom of the Potomac River early Saturday, the
National Transportation Safety Board said. </p>
<p>Large pieces of the jetliner and helicopter along with the remains of
all 67 victims were recovered this week, and crews will spend the coming
days looking for smaller debris before finishing the work in about a
week. </p>
<p>A plane operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration and equipped with laser scanning technology flew at low
altitudes over the crash site. The lasers are used to penetrate the
river’s surface and map the riverbed. </p>
<p>“All major pieces” of the two aircraft have been found, and
investigators will examine them for any markings that could reveal the
angle of the collision, according to an NTSB statement released Saturday
afternoon. </p>
<p>The NTSB said information collected will be part of its ongoing
investigation into the January 29 collision between the Army helicopter
and an American Airlines flight over Washington. There were no
survivors. </p>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday blamed the collision on what
he called an obsolete computer system used by U.S. air traffic
controllers and vowed to replace it. </p>
<p>NTSB officials told members of Congress that the helicopter’s
advanced surveillance technology, which transmits aircraft location and
other data to air traffic control and other aircraft, was turned off,
Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz said Thursday. </p>
<p>Investigators are also looking into the altitude of the plane and
helicopter, including whether the helicopter was above its 61-meter
flight ceiling. Investigators need to be able to examine the wreckage of
the Black Hawk to get more precise information. </p>
<p>The crash was the deadliest in the U.S. since November 12, 2001, when
a jet slammed into a New York City neighborhood just after takeoff,
killing all 260 people on board and five on the ground.</p>

judge temporarily blocks Musk’s DOGE from accessing payment systems</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A federal judge early Saturday temporarily blocked billionaire Elon
Musk’s government efficiency team and Trump administration political
appointees from accessing government systems used to process trillions
of dollars in payments, citing a risk that sensitive information could
be improperly disclosed.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer in Manhattan issued the order
after a coalition of Democratic attorneys general from 19 U.S. states
filed a lawsuit late Friday arguing Musk’s Department of Government
Efficiency has no legal power to access the U.S. Department of Treasury
systems.</p>
<p>Musk, on X, called the ruling “absolutely insane!” and said without
evidence that “something super shady is going to protect scammers.”</p>
<p>“How on Earth are we supposed to stop fraud and waste of taxpayer
money without looking at how money is spent?” Musk said on his social
media platform and called Engelmayer “an activist posing as a
judge.”</p>
<p>The lawsuit said Musk and his team could disrupt federal funding for
health clinics, preschools, climate initiatives, and other programs, and
that Republican President Donald Trump could use the information to
further his political agenda.</p>
<p>DOGE’s access to the system also “poses huge cybersecurity risks that
put vast amounts of funding for the States and their residents in
peril,” the state attorneys general said. They sought a temporary
restraining order blocking DOGE’s access.</p>
<p>The judge, an appointee of Democratic former President Barack Obama,
said the states’ claims were “particularly strong” and warranted him
acting on their request for emergency relief pending a further hearing
before another judge on Feb. 14.</p>
<p>“That is both because of the risk that the new policy presents of the
disclosure of sensitive and confidential information and the heightened
risk that the systems in question will be more vulnerable than before to
hacking,” Engelmayer wrote.</p>
<p>New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat whose office is
leading the case, welcomed the ruling, saying nobody was above the law
and that Americans across the country had been horrified by the DOGE
team’s unfettered access to their data.</p>
<p>“We knew the Trump administration’s choice to give this access to
unauthorized individuals was illegal, and this morning, a federal court
agreed,” James said in a statement. “Now, Americans can trust that Musk
— the world’s richest man — and his friends will not have free rein over
their personal information while our lawsuit proceeds.”</p>
<p>Engelmayer’s order bars access from being granted to Treasury
Department payment and data systems by political appointees, special
government employees and government employees detailed from an agency
outside the Treasury Department.</p>
<p>The judge also directed that anyone prohibited under his order from
accessing those systems to immediately destroy anything they copied or
downloaded.</p>
<p>The White House and Treasury Department did not immediately respond
to requests for comment.</p>
<p>Trump deputized Musk to lead DOGE to identify fraud and waste in the
government. Musk’s efforts have alarmed Democrats and advocacy groups
who say he is overstepping his authority by seeking to dismantle
agencies responsible for critical government programs and fire federal
workers en masse.</p>
<p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, a Trump appointee, said this week
that the department’s payment system will not be touched by Musk and
that any decisions to stop payments would be made by other agencies.</p>

bill talks bog down after Trump’s efforts to slash government</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Before President Donald Trump and Republicans in
Congress can enact much of their legislative agenda, they must deal with
some unfinished business — completing work on the current budget year’s
spending bills. It’s a task that by all accounts is not going well. </p>
<p>The current stopgap measure lasts through March 14. After that,
without congressional action, there would be a partial government
shutdown. </p>
<p>Five weeks is an eternity when it comes to resolving spending bills
in Washington. But Trump’s first weeks in office have escalated tensions
between the two parties as the new administration reshapes agency
priorities and dismantles existing programs without congressional
approval. </p>
<p>A look at where the talks stand: </p>
<p>Republicans accuse Democrats of abandoning negotiations </p>
<p>Republican and Democratic leaders of the two appropriations
committees in Congress were holding spending bill talks in late January;
aides said the two sides were committed to getting a deal done. But
optimism has faded in recent days. </p>
<p>“Obviously, the Democrats are not in a good place right now, so they
walked away from talks. But it’ll have to resume,” House Majority Leader
Steve Scalise, a Republican from Louisiana, said Thursday. </p>
<p>House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, gave a
similar assessment, contending that comments by House Democratic leader
Hakeem Jeffries of New York and some of his colleagues made it seem as
though they are “trying to set up some sort of government shutdown,
which I think is very unfortunate. We were negotiating in good faith and
trying to get the topline number, but so far as I know, they’ve been
sort of unresponsive the last two days or so. So, I hope we can get back
to it.” </p>
<p>Representative Tom Cole, the chairman of the House Appropriations
Committee, said he heard from Democratic lawmakers as recently as
Thursday, so he did not believe they were walking away from talks. </p>
<p>“But we’re not making the progress I would hope,” said Cole, a
Republican from Oklahoma. </p>
<p>Democrats dispute GOP leadership’s characterization </p>
<p>Connecticut Representative Rosa DeLauro, the lead Democrat on the
House Appropriations Committee, said “that is false” in response to the
assertion that Democrats have withdrawn from negotiations. </p>
<p>“The Democrats have made their offer. We have not walked away from
the table,” DeLauro said. </p>
<p>Jeffries told reporters that DeLauro “has been trying to get
Republicans to respond to her for weeks.” </p>
<p>“I’m hopeful that Republicans are actually willing now to sit down at
the table and reach a spending agreement in the best interest of the
American people, not in the best interest of their billionaire donors,”
Jeffries said. </p>
<p>Tensions over topline spending levels </p>
<p>Under terms of an agreement that former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a
Republican from California, worked out with then-President Joe Biden,
spending for defense and non-defense would increase by 1% for the
current budget year, which began October 1. That would bring the tallies
to about $895.2 billion for defense and $780.4 billion for
non-defense. </p>
<p>Congress set the spending levels to grow below the rate of inflation,
at the insistence of Republicans, as part of a package that also
suspended the debt limit so that the federal government could continue
paying its bills. Democrats say an agreement is an agreement. </p>
<p>“That is the path forward that will allow everyone to come together
to reach a spending agreement that meets the needs of the American
people,” Jeffries said. </p>
<p>Republicans don’t see it that way. </p>
<p>Cole said Democrats should adjust to the reality of a Republican
president in the White House and Republicans controlling both chambers
of Congress. </p>
<p>“We have to remember the deal they are trying to enforce is when we
had a Democratic president and a Democratic Senate. We don’t have those
anymore,” Cole said. “And in particular, the president doesn’t feel
bound by an agreement made by another president that didn’t go down on
his watch.” </p>
<p>Cole said that “there’s only one signature that matters right now and
it’s not Joe Biden’s anymore.” </p>
<p>Democrats wary as Trump, Musk revamp federal government </p>
<p>Democrats are struggling to keep up and provide a unified response to
Trump’s first weeks in office as government workers are pushed to
resign, entire agencies are dismantled, and Elon Musk’s team from the
Department of Government Efficiency gains access to sensitive
information of countless Americans. </p>
<p>They are worried about how current government services are being
affected, with Democrats accusing the administration of blocking
hundreds of billions of dollars in previously approved funding. Those
concerns are also swaying their thinking as they approach the spending
bill negotiations. </p>
<p>“The level of trust is at the lowest I have ever seen it here in
Congress,” said Washington Senator Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the
Senate Appropriations Committee. “It is up to our Republican colleagues
to stand up to this and assure us an agreement and a law is real.” </p>
<p>DeLauro said Democrats need assurances that Republicans will follow
through on whatever spending agreement the negotiators reach. </p>
<p>“You won some. I won some. We lost some each. But we have a deal. And
that’s got to be it. Those assurances have to be made,” DeLauro
said. </p>
<p>Plan B </p>
<p>If lawmakers fail to reach agreement on a full-year spending measure,
then it’s possible that they could also pass another temporary measure
to keep the government open for a few more weeks or months while they
try to work out their differences. </p>
<p>Such stopgap measures, called continuing resolutions (CRs), generally
fund government programs and agencies at current levels. </p>
<p>“I don’t want a CR,” Cole said. “But I certainly prefer a CR to a
shutdown.”</p>
