date: 2025-03-18, from: Market Place, Make me Smart

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>On today&#8217;s episode, Kai Ryssdal and Kimberly Adams discuss the Donald Trump administration&#8217;s disregard for the courts.

Plus, get ready for a three-bleep Kai rant. And how anime helps explain the GOP&#8217;s attempt to get around the real cost of its $4 trillion tax cut.</p>
