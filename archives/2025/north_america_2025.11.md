## U.S. trade tensions with the EU just got tenser

date: 2025-03-20, from: Market Place, Make me Smart

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>President Donald Trump&#8217;s tariff fight with the European Union just got a little more heated after the EU accused U.S. tech giants Google and Apple of breaching antitrust rules. Could this escalate the EU-U.S. trade war? We&#8217;ll also talk about the erasure of Black history and why Elon Musk is about to be back in the money. Finally, Nova makes us smile with some of the funniest and nerdiest bumper stickers seen around the streets of Los Angeles.</p>

## What we can learn from a past tariff tiff (rerun)

date: 2025-03-18, from: Market Place, Make me Smart

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em>Hey Smarties! Today we&#8217;re revisiting an episode from earlier this year that might help you make sense of all the tit for tat tariff fight from the past few weeks. It unpacks some tariff history and the potential economic consequences of President Trump&#8217;s ongoing trade war.</em></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If President Donald Trump goes through with his plan to levy sweeping tariffs on foreign imports, it wouldn’t be the first time the U.S. has done such a thing. Ever heard of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930? Anyone? Those tariffs are widely credited with sinking the United States deeper into the Great Depression. And although global trade looks different nowadays, they can teach us a lot about how Trump’s protectionist approach to global trade could play out. On the show today, Inu Manak, a fellow for trade policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, explains how the Smoot-Hawley tariff debacle can shed light on the current moment, why the president has the power to wield tariffs in the first place, and how punishing trading partners could leave the U.S. economy at a disadvantage. Plus, what this fight has to do with the 1980s film “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off” and Roomba vacuum cleaners!</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

## We have a constitutional crisis. Now what?

date: 2025-03-18, from: Market Place, Make me Smart

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>On today&#8217;s episode, Kai Ryssdal and Kimberly Adams discuss the Donald Trump administration&#8217;s disregard for the courts.

Plus, get ready for a three-bleep Kai rant. And how anime helps explain the GOP&#8217;s attempt to get around the real cost of its $4 trillion tax cut.</p>
