Mesoscale Discussion 0241
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0554 AM CDT Wed Mar 19 2025

Areas affected...Parts of western/central KS into central/eastern
NE...northwest IA...and extreme southeast SD/south-central MN

Concerning...Blizzard 

Valid 191054Z - 191600Z

SUMMARY...Blizzard conditions will gradually spread eastward through
the morning. Snow rates of 1-2+ inches per hour are possible, along
with widespread 50-60+ mph gusts.

DISCUSSION...Blizzard conditions are ongoing this morning from
southwest/south-central NE into western KS, to the northwest of a
powerful 987 mb cyclone centered over northeast KS. Very strong
deep-layer ascent will continue to  support heavy precipitation
rates through the morning, aided by very favorable low/midlevel
frontogenesis, and the presence of elevated buoyancy and
regenerative convection along the eastern periphery of heavier
precipitation, near the midlevel dry slot. The heaviest
precipitation rates will gradually shift eastward through the
morning, in conjunction with the movement of the cyclone, while
low-level cold advection and strong ascent result in cooling of the
column and a changeover to snow in areas that are currently in the
mid/upper 30s F. 

Meanwhile, very strong low-level flow increasing to near/above 70 kt
at 1 km AGL (as noted on the KUEX VWP) will continue to support wind
gusts in the 50-70 mph range (as already noted through the night
across parts of KS/NE), resulting in widespread blowing snow and
blizzard conditions. 

Short-term guidance generally suggests that the heaviest snow rates
will become focused from central/northern KS into northeast
NE/northwest IA later this morning. Areas within the most intense
snow bands may experience rates of 1-2+ inches per hour, along with
wind gusts near/above 60 mph, near-zero visibility, and occasional
lightning. A rather sharp gradient in snow rates is expected along
the eastern periphery of the heavier precipitation, though the very
strong wind gusts may result in blizzard conditions even in areas
that experience only light to moderate snow.

Mesoscale Discussion 0222
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0628 AM CDT Sun Mar 16 2025

Areas affected...North Florida and southeast Georgia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 161128Z - 161300Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...A broken band of storms will spread eastward into
southeast Georgia and north Florida through late morning.  A new
tornado watch appears likely.

DISCUSSION...A broken band of storms has persisted overnight from
south central GA into the eastern FL Panhandle, with
occasional/embedded supercell structures.  Low-level moistening over
the next few hours and the onset of diurnal heating will drive
destabilization across north FL/southeast GA later this morning. 
Though the low-level jet core will develop northeastward toward the
Carolinas through the day, low-level flow/shear will remain
sufficiently strong to support additional supercells through the
morning across north FL/southeast GA.  The storms will remain
capable of producing occasional damaging winds and possibly a couple
of tornadoes, and a new tornado watch will likely be needed from
12-13z.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 51
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
610 AM EDT Sun Mar 16 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Southeast Georgia
  Southern North Carolina
  Central and Eastern South Carolina
  Coastal Waters

* Effective this Sunday morning and afternoon from 610 AM until
  200 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A couple tornadoes possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 0.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...A broken band of thunderstorms will continue east into the
Watch area this morning within a weakly unstable airmass with very
strong flow aloft.  A greater risk for wind damage along with a
threat for a couple of tornadoes, will seemingly focus with
organized bowing segments and perhaps a few embedded circulations
within the band of thunderstorms.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 80 statute miles
east and west of a line from 35 miles north northeast of
Fayetteville NC to 45 miles southwest of Savannah GA. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU1).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 50...

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail

Mesoscale Discussion 0196
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0747 AM CDT Sat Mar 15 2025

Areas affected...portions of western Minnesota

Concerning...Heavy snow 

Valid 151247Z - 151645Z

SUMMARY...Periods of heavy snow (perhaps exceeding 1 inch/hr at
times), along with blizzard conditions are possible this morning.
Winds may sustain over 35 mph (with higher gusts), with reduced
visibility possible in spots.

DISCUSSION...A stacked cyclone continues to occlude while drifting
toward Ontario. As this cyclone continues to track northward,
continued CAA will keep the column below freezing while 850-700 mb
frontogenesis will continue to support adequate convergence/lift for
efficient dendrite production over central MN, which will pivot
around the northwestern quadrant of the cyclone and support moderate
to heavy snowfall over western MN this morning. Strong surface
isallobaric flow across the northwestern cyclone quadrant may
coincide with heavier snowfall rates (perhaps exceeding 1 inch/hr at
times), resulting in periodic blizzard conditions. Visibility may
reduce to or less than a quarter mile in the heavier snow bands.

Mesoscale Discussion 0195
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0719 AM CDT Sat Mar 15 2025

Areas affected...portions of northeastern Kentucky...southern and
central Ohio...and extreme western West Virginia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 151219Z - 151345Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A few instances of severe hail or damaging gusts may
continue for a few more hours. The overall severe threat appears
isolated and a downstream WW issuance is not currently anticipated.

DISCUSSION...A line of thunderstorms with a history of severe hail
and damaging gusts (some of which have exceeded severe limits)
continues to progress eastward as a stacked cyclone over the Great
Lakes continues to track toward Ontario. This line of storms
(especially the southern portion) continues to effectively transport
stronger flow aloft to the surface, with 7-8 C/km mid-level lapse
rates likely supporting continuing severe hail production. However,
this line of storms is approaching the eastern bounds of what is
already scant buoyancy (characterized by 200 J/kg MUCAPE per the 12Z
ILN observed sounding), and this line should gradually outpace this
marginal instability with time. As such, the severe threat should
generally remain limited, though a focused severe threat may
continue with the more robust storms (southern portion of the line
in KY) for at least a few more hours.

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.
