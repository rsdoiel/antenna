Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0743 AM CDT Thu Mar 20 2025

Valid 201300Z - 211200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorm development will be possible today in parts of the
Mid-Atlantic and northern Rockies. Severe weather is not expected.

...Eastern NC/southeast VA this afternoon...
A midlevel trough and an associated surface cold front will progress
eastward from the Appalachians to the Atlantic coast by late this
evening/early tonight.  Only a narrow corridor of low-level
moistening is expected ahead of the front, as a result of only
partial air mass modification and poor trajectories from the Gulf
and western Atlantic.  There could be sufficient heating and
moistening for very weak buoyancy (100-200 J/kg MLCAPE) and
convection deep enough to produce isolated lightning flashes in a
band along the front this afternoon, especially across eastern NC. 
While there is a low chance for isolated wind damage, the very weak
buoyancy does not support the addition of severe wind probabilities.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0358 AM CDT Thu Mar 20 2025

Valid 231200Z - 281200Z

...DISCUSSION...
...Sunday/Day 4 and Monday/Day 5...
A large-scale cyclonic flow pattern will be in place across much of
the continental U.S. on Sunday. An upper-level low will develop over
the Great Lakes, as an associated trough moves southeastward from
the Great Plains to the Mississippi Valley. A cold front is forecast
to move southeastward into the Ozarks. Ahead of the front, moisture
advection is forecast to occur over the Sabine and lower Mississippi
Valleys, where surface dewpoints will likely be in the 60s F and
moderate instability is expected to develop. Scattered thunderstorms
appear likely to initiate ahead of the front Sunday evening from the
Sabine River Valley northeastward into the Tennessee Valley, with an
MCS developing Sunday evening. Moderate deep-layer shear will likely
support severe thunderstorm development, with a potential for severe
wind gusts, isolated large hail. A tornado threat may also develop.

A cold front is forecast to move through the Gulf Coast region
Sunday morning. Isolated severe storms could develop ahead of the
front early in the day from the Texas Coast eastward to the central
Gulf Coast and Florida Panhandle. Predictability remains low
concerning where the greatest severe threat will be along this
corridor. The severe threat should end during the day as the front
moves southward into the Gulf.

...Tuesday/Day 6 to Thursday/Day 8...
On Tuesday, a mid-level trough is forecast to dig southeastward into
the Mississippi Valley. At the surface, a moist airmass will remain
over the Gulf Coast region. Isolated strong to severe storms could
occur along the northern edge of this moist airmass. The greatest
potential for severe could be across the Sabine River Valley, where
some solutions have moderate instability Tuesday afternoon. This
appears to be a conditional severe threat, and predictability is
low.

From Wednesday into Thursday, a relatively dry airmass is forecast
over much of the nation. The exception could be across south Texas,
where thunderstorm development will be possible. Although an
isolated severe threat would be possible there, predictability at
this extended range in the forecast cycle is low.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0112 AM CDT Thu Mar 20 2025

Valid 211200Z - 221200Z

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will continue to linger across the Plains and
parts of the Midwest on Friday as a dry cold front pushes
southeastward across the central CONUS. The weak upper trough
currently pushing into the Pacific Northwest and an attendant
surface low are forecast to eject into the Plains early Friday,
reaching the Great Lakes by evening. As this occurs, a trailing
surface trough/cold front will migrate southeast into the central
and southern Plains. Both pre- and post-frontal winds are forecast
to reach into the 15-25 mph range across a broad swath of the
central CONUS. A dry return flow regime is expected across central
TX/OK and into KS/MO ahead of the front, while an influx of dry
post-frontal air will promote RH values in the teens across NE, KS,
CO, and NM. 

...Southern Plains into the mid-MS River Valley...
The recent frontal intrusion into the Gulf has shunted any
appreciable moisture well offshore with low 30 dewpoints noted along
the TX Gulf coast as of 05 UTC. Moisture return through Friday is
expected to be minimal, and guidance that typically over-mixes the
boundary layer will likely better capture RH trends within the dry
return flow regime. As such, the current forecast relies heavily on
RAP/HRRR solutions that depict widespread 15-20 mph winds and 20-25%
RH minimums ahead of the front, including into northeast AR and MO
where active fires were observed on Wednesday. Ensemble guidance
appears to support these solutions with 50-70% probabilities for
sustained winds above 15 mph across this region. 

...High Plains...
Elevated fire weather conditions are expected to be fairly
widespread behind the front from the NE Panhandle southward into the
southern High Plains. Downslope warming/drying should yield the
driest conditions with RH values in the 15-25% range and widespread
wind speed between 15-25 mph. Although continuous elevated wind/RH
conditions are expected, the risk area is bifurcated across parts of
eastern CO and KS where substantial rain/snow has fallen over the
past 24 hours. Fuel trends will be monitored across these regions,
and an expansion of the risk area(s) may be needed as snow melts and
grasses dry over the next 48 hours.

Mesoscale Discussion 0241
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0554 AM CDT Wed Mar 19 2025

Areas affected...Parts of western/central KS into central/eastern
NE...northwest IA...and extreme southeast SD/south-central MN

Concerning...Blizzard 

Valid 191054Z - 191600Z

SUMMARY...Blizzard conditions will gradually spread eastward through
the morning. Snow rates of 1-2+ inches per hour are possible, along
with widespread 50-60+ mph gusts.

DISCUSSION...Blizzard conditions are ongoing this morning from
southwest/south-central NE into western KS, to the northwest of a
powerful 987 mb cyclone centered over northeast KS. Very strong
deep-layer ascent will continue to  support heavy precipitation
rates through the morning, aided by very favorable low/midlevel
frontogenesis, and the presence of elevated buoyancy and
regenerative convection along the eastern periphery of heavier
precipitation, near the midlevel dry slot. The heaviest
precipitation rates will gradually shift eastward through the
morning, in conjunction with the movement of the cyclone, while
low-level cold advection and strong ascent result in cooling of the
column and a changeover to snow in areas that are currently in the
mid/upper 30s F. 

Meanwhile, very strong low-level flow increasing to near/above 70 kt
at 1 km AGL (as noted on the KUEX VWP) will continue to support wind
gusts in the 50-70 mph range (as already noted through the night
across parts of KS/NE), resulting in widespread blowing snow and
blizzard conditions. 

Short-term guidance generally suggests that the heaviest snow rates
will become focused from central/northern KS into northeast
NE/northwest IA later this morning. Areas within the most intense
snow bands may experience rates of 1-2+ inches per hour, along with
wind gusts near/above 60 mph, near-zero visibility, and occasional
lightning. A rather sharp gradient in snow rates is expected along
the eastern periphery of the heavier precipitation, though the very
strong wind gusts may result in blizzard conditions even in areas
that experience only light to moderate snow.

Mesoscale Discussion 0222
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0628 AM CDT Sun Mar 16 2025

Areas affected...North Florida and southeast Georgia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 161128Z - 161300Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...A broken band of storms will spread eastward into
southeast Georgia and north Florida through late morning.  A new
tornado watch appears likely.

DISCUSSION...A broken band of storms has persisted overnight from
south central GA into the eastern FL Panhandle, with
occasional/embedded supercell structures.  Low-level moistening over
the next few hours and the onset of diurnal heating will drive
destabilization across north FL/southeast GA later this morning. 
Though the low-level jet core will develop northeastward toward the
Carolinas through the day, low-level flow/shear will remain
sufficiently strong to support additional supercells through the
morning across north FL/southeast GA.  The storms will remain
capable of producing occasional damaging winds and possibly a couple
of tornadoes, and a new tornado watch will likely be needed from
12-13z.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 51
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
610 AM EDT Sun Mar 16 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Southeast Georgia
  Southern North Carolina
  Central and Eastern South Carolina
  Coastal Waters

* Effective this Sunday morning and afternoon from 610 AM until
  200 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A couple tornadoes possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 0.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...A broken band of thunderstorms will continue east into the
Watch area this morning within a weakly unstable airmass with very
strong flow aloft.  A greater risk for wind damage along with a
threat for a couple of tornadoes, will seemingly focus with
organized bowing segments and perhaps a few embedded circulations
within the band of thunderstorms.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 80 statute miles
east and west of a line from 35 miles north northeast of
Fayetteville NC to 45 miles southwest of Savannah GA. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU1).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.
