## The tariff countdown

date: 2025-04-01, from: Market Place, Make me Smart

<p>President Donald Trump has promised that a fresh wave of tariffs on April 2 will usher in an era of growth in American manufacturing. But does history bear that out? We’ll explain how steel tariffs under President George W. Bush did more harm than good. And, in response to Trump&#8217;s trade agenda, the &#8220;buy Canadian&#8221; movement is gaining steam. American exporters are already feeling it. Plus, we&#8217;ll smile about flowers, parties and the unspoken rules of texting.</p>
