## Our post-tariff takeaways

date: 2025-04-03, from: Market Place, Make me Smart

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>President Donald Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on American imports, with the levies coming in higher than expected. Do we need to be stockpiling our carts to get in front of rising costs? We asked economists how they&#8217;re personally preparing for higher prices. Plus, Reema and Kimberly unpack international responses as countries buckle up to negotiate — or take retaliatory measures. Also, why are we putting tariffs on uninhabited islands near Antarctica?</p>

## The problem with running the government like a business

date: 2025-04-01, from: Market Place, Make me Smart

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The idea that the government should be run more like a business isn&#8217;t new. But with two businessmen, Donald Trump and Elon Musk, now taking a proverbial chainsaw to the federal bureaucracy all in the name &#8220;efficiency,&#8221; this theory is being put to the test. While it&#8217;s an appealing idea, Philip Joyce, professor of public policy at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy, said governments can&#8217;t afford to take risks the way businesses can. On the show today, Joyce explains the origins of the idea that the government should be run like a business, how we define &#8220;success&#8221; differently for the two entities, and how the way Trump and Musk do business is showing up in the White House.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Then, we&#8217;ll break down the high stakes of today&#8217;s special elections in Wisconsin and Florida. Plus, reflections on serendipitous moments in walkable communities and what we gain by admitting we were wrong.</p>

## The tariff countdown

date: 2025-04-01, from: Market Place, Make me Smart

<p>President Donald Trump has promised that a fresh wave of tariffs on April 2 will usher in an era of growth in American manufacturing. But does history bear that out? We’ll explain how steel tariffs under President George W. Bush did more harm than good. And, in response to Trump&#8217;s trade agenda, the &#8220;buy Canadian&#8221; movement is gaining steam. American exporters are already feeling it. Plus, we&#8217;ll smile about flowers, parties and the unspoken rules of texting.</p>

## CoreWeave’s IPO tests money magic of AI
