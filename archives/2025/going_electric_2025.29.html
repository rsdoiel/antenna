A fully electric Japanese electric pickup truck? It’s not a Toyota or
Honda, but <a href="https://electrek.co/guides/isuzu/">Isuzu’s</a> new
electric pickup packs a punch. The D-MAX EV can tow over 7,770 lbs
(3,500 kg), plow through nearly 24″ (600 mm) of water, and it even has a
dedicated Terrain Mode for extreme off-roading. However, it comes at a
cost.

schedule.
