<p>
The Fiat Topolino Vilebrequin is a new beach town cruiser that captures
the elegance, glamour, and relaxed vibe of the French Riviera. More
significantly, the updated EV also heralds Stellantis’ plans to
<em>double</em> EV production at its Kenitra Assembly Plant in Morocco.

you think electric bikes are bad, there’s a much bigger menace hitting
our roads</h2>

<p>
Electric bikes are a menace. They go almost as fast as a car (if the car
is parking), they’re whisper quiet (which makes them impossible to hear
