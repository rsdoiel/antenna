Post — The Open Access – AI Conundrum: Does Free to Read Mean Free to
Train?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-15, from: Scholarly Kitchen</p>
<p>
It is time for OA proponents to engage in public debate with academic
associations, universities and national funding agencies, because the
widespread use of academic content in AI models poses significant risks
for the research ecosystem.

Control Automation for Student Driven Digitization Workflows</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-14, from: /Code4Lib Journal</p>
<p>At Union College Schaffer Library, the digitization lab is mostly
staffed by undergraduates who only work a handful of hours a week. While
they do a great job, the infrequency of their work hours and lack of
experience results in errors in digitization and metadata. Many of these
errors are difficult to catch during quality control checks because they
are so minute, such as a missed counted page number here, or a
transposed character in a filename there. So, a Computer Science student
and a librarian collaborated to create a quality control automation
application for the digitization workflow. The application is written in
Python and relies heavily on using Openpyxl libraries to check the
metadata spreadsheet and compare metadata with the digitized files. This
article discusses the purpose and theory behind the Quality Control
application, how hands-on experience with the digitization workflow
informs automation, the methodology, and the user interface decisions.
The goal of this application is to make it usable by other students and
staff and to build it into the workflow in the future. This
collaboration resulted in an experiential learning opportunity that has
benefited the student’s ability to apply what they have learned in class
to a real-world problem.</p>

A Minimally Constrained Vocabulary for Work, Expression, Manifestation,
and Item</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-14, from: /Code4Lib Journal</p>
<p>The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative has published a minimally
constrainted vocabulary for the concepts of Work, Expression,
Manifestation and Item (WEMI) that can support the use of these concepts
in metadata describing any type of created resources. These concepts
originally were defined for library catalog metadata and did not
anticipate uses outside of that application. Employment of the concepts
in non-library applications is evidence that the concepts are useful for
a wider variety of metadata users, once freed from the constraints
necessitated for the library-specific use.</p>

the Generative AI Wild West: Integrating Knowledge Graphs in Digital
Library Systems</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-14, from: /Code4Lib Journal</p>
<p>Since the 17th century, scientific publishing has been
document-centric, leaving knowledge—such as methods and best
practices—largely unstructured and not easily machine-interpretable,
despite digital availability. Traditional practices reduce content to
keyword indexes, masking richer insights. Advances in semantic
technologies, like knowledge graphs, can enhance the structure of
scientific records, addressing challenges in a research landscape where
millions of contributions are published annually, often as
pseudo-digitized PDFs. As a case in point, generative AI Large Language
Models (LLMs) like OpenAI’s GPT and Meta AI’s LLAMA exemplify rapid
innovation, yet critical information about LLMs remains scattered across
articles, blogs, and code repositories. This highlights the need for
knowledge-graph-based publishing to make scientific knowledge truly FAIR
(Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). This article explores
semantic publishing workflows, enabling structured descriptions and
comparisons of LLMs that support automated research insights—similar to
product descriptions on e-commerce platforms. Demonstrated via the Open
Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG) platform, a flagship project of the TIB
Leibniz Information Centre for Science &amp; Technology and University
Library, this approach transforms scientific documentation into
machine-actionable knowledge, streamlining research access, update,
search, and comparison.</p>

Information Literacy: Using Unity and Github to Collaborate on a Video
Game for the Library</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-14, from: /Code4Lib Journal</p>
<p>Gamification, as a way to engage students in the library, has been a
topic explored by librarians for many years. In this article, two
librarians at a small rural academic library describe their year-long
collaboration with students from a Game Design Program to create a
single-player pixel-art video game designed to teach information
literacy skills asynchronously. The project was accomplished using the
game engine Unity and utilizing GitHub for project management. Outlined
are the project’s inspiration, management, team structure, and outcomes.
Not only did the project serve to instruct, but it was also meant to
test the campus’ appetite for digital scholarship projects. While the
project ended with mixed results, it is presented here as an example of
how innovation can grow a campus’ digital presence, even in resistant
libraries.</p>

Language Models for Machine-Readable Citation Data: Towards an Automated
Metadata Curation Pipeline for Scholarly Journals</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-14, from: /Code4Lib Journal</p>
<p>Northwestern University spent far too much time and effort curating
citation data by hand. Here, we show that large language models can be
an efficient way to convert plain-text citations to BibTeX for use in
machine-actionable metadata. Further, we prove that these models can be
run locally, without cloud compute cost. With these tools,
university-owned publishing operations can increase their operating
efficiency which, when combined with human review, has no effect on
quality.</p>

Alma: Simplifying Circulation Settings in the Alma Integrated Library
System (ILS)</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-14, from: /Code4Lib Journal</p>
<p>Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing code, in order
to make the code easier to maintain, without changing the behavior of
the software. Georgia Southern University is the product of a
consolidation of two separate universities in 2017. Before
consolidation, each predecessor university had its own cataloging
practices and software settings in the integrated library system (ILS) /
library services platform (LSP). While the machine-readable cataloging
(MARC) standard focuses on discovery, and descriptive search blended
well to support discovery, settings related to circulation were in
discord following the merger. Three busy checkout desks each had
different localized behaviors and requested additional behaviors to be
built out without centrally standardizing. Complexity stemming from
non-unified metadata and settings plus customizations implemented over
time for multiple checkout desks had ballooned to make for circulation
settings which were overly baroque, difficult to meaningfully edit when
a change to circulation practices was needed, and which were layered and
complex to such a degree that local standards could not be explained to
employees creating and editing library metadata. This resulted in
frequent frustration with how circulation worked, difficulty knowing
what was or wasn’t a software bug, and inability to quickly fix problems
once problems were identified or to make requested changes. During 2024,
the Georgia Southern University Libraries (University Libraries)
undertook a comprehensive settings clean up in Alma centered around
software settings related to circulation. This article describes
step-by-step how the University Libraries streamlined and simplified
software settings in the Alma ILS, in order to make the software
explainable and easier to manage, and all without impacting three busy
checkout desks during the change process. Through refactoring, the
University Libraries achieved more easily maintainable and explainable
software settings, with minimal disruption to day-to-day operations
along the way.</p>

Listening: Using Python and Apps Scripts to Text Mine and Tag Oral
History Collections</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-14, from: /Code4Lib Journal</p>
<p>This article presents a case study for creating subject tags
utilizing transcription data across entire oral history collections,
adapting Franco Moretti’s distant reading approach to narrative audio
material. Designed for oral history project managers, the workflow
empowers student workers to generate, modify, and expand subject tags
during transcription editing, thereby enhancing the overall accuracy and
discoverability of the collection. The paper details the workflow,
surveys challenges the process addresses, shares experiences of
transcribers, and examines the limitations of data-driven, human-edited
tagging.</p>

Web Methodology as a Sustainable Approach to Digital Humanities
Projects</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-14, from: /Code4Lib Journal</p>
<p>The web platforms adopted for digital humanities (DH) projects come
with significant short- and long-term costs—selecting a platform will
impact how resources are invested in a project and organization. As DH
practitioners, the time (or money paid to contractors) we must invest in
managing servers, maintaining platform updates, and learning
idiosyncratic administrative systems ultimately limits our ability to
create and sustain unique, innovative projects. Reexamining DH platforms
through a minimal computing lens has led University of Idaho librarians
to pursue new project-development methods that minimize digital
infrastructure as a means to maximize investment in people, growing
agency, agility, and long-term sustainability in both the organization
and digital outputs. U of I librarians’ development approach centered
around static web-based templates aims to develop transferable technical
skills that all digital projects require, while also matching the
structure of academic work cycles and fulfilling DH project needs. In
particular, a static web approach encourages the creation of
preservation-ready project data, enables periods of iterative
development, and capitalizes on the low-cost/low-maintenance
characteristics of statically-generated sites to optimize limited
economic resources and personnel time. This short paper introduces
static web development methodology (titled “Lib-Static”) as a
provocation to rethink DH infrastructure choices, asking how our
frameworks can build internal skills, collaboration, and empowerment to
generate more sustainable digital projects.</p>
