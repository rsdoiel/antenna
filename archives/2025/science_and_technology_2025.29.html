<h2 id="aros-continues-centimetering-closer-to-64bit">AROS continues
centimetering closer to 64bit</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>The work towards making the 64bit version of AROS a viable choice is
continuing, as is the work on AROS’ web browser, and developer Krzysztof
‘deadwood’ Śmiechowicz gave an update a few days ago detailing the
progress that’s been made – and it’s extensive. First, the beta version
of Odyssey 3.0, the web browser for AROS, can now load a whole slew of
important websites, like YouTube, Google Docs, and Discord, which is a
big deal for an alternative operating system like AROS. Odyssey uses
Apple’s WebKit as its browser engine, and it’s obviously important to
make sure it runs on the 64bit version of AROS. Speaking of 64bit, more
and more applications are being recompiled to add 64bit support, with
the stated goal being to have at least the best application in each
category available in 64bit. A major issue is that certain pieces of
hardware that work in 32bit do not yet work in 64bit. As a temporary
solution, they’re going to make use of the virtualisation route AROS
Portable uses to plug the gaps in 64bit hardware support until such
support is realised. AROS Portable is basically a Linux distribution
that runs a virtual copy of the 32bit version of AROS. It’s clear that a
lot of work is happening in the 64bit space for AROS, which is crucial
for the long-term viability of the project. AROS is still the easiest
and most accessible way to get a taste of an Amiga-like experience since
it runs on plain x86 hardware, so it’s important to keep that dream
alive.</p>

id="freebsd-15.0s-installer-to-gain-option-to-install-a-full-kde-plasma-desktop-environment">FreeBSD
15.0’s installer to gain option to install a full KDE Plasma desktop
environment</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>One of the things lacking from the FreeBSD installation routine is
the easy installation of a full desktop experience, from X11 all the way
up to a login manager, desktop environment, and its applications. It
seems this might finally change for FreeBSD 15.0, as the FreeBSD
Foundation’s Laptop Support and Usability Improvements project is
working on adding support for this to bsdinstall, the FreeBSD installer.
Based on a goal set out in this GitHub issue, the way this will work is
that through a set of dialogs (which you can check out on GitLab) in the
FreeBSD installer, the user can select to install KDE, which will then
guide the user through installing the correct graphics driver and adding
users to the video group. Once the installation is finished, the
computer will reboot and load directly into SDDM, allowing you to log
into the installed KDE Plasma desktop environment. For FreeBSD 15.0, our
goal is to extend the FreeBSD installer to offer a minimal KDE-based
desktop as an install option. The initial concept is a low-interaction
installation process that, upon completion, brings the user directly to
a KDE graphical login screen. ↫ FreeBSD Foundation Laptop Update – June
2025 Future plans for desktop users in the FreeBSD installers are more
elaborate, and will include additional desktop environments to choose
from, the ability to install sets of desktop applications during
FreeBSD’s installation, and yes, even opting for Wayland instead of X11,
because FreeBSD developers know which way the wind is blowing. This is
excellent news, and will make installing a FreeBSD-based desktop a lot
easier for a ton of people. Work isn’t fully completed just yet, but
even if the developers miss their FreeBSD 15.0 target, it’ll just move
on to one of the follow-up releases.</p>

<p>date: 2025-07-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>Ever wanted Windows to monitor what’s on your screen continuously and
ask it to do stuff for you? Well, have I got news for you: Copilot
Vision, as this feature is called, is now rolling out to users in the
US. Copilot Vision on Windows, now available in the U.S., is a new way
to engage with your Windows 11 PC. When you enable it, it can see what
you see on your device and talk to you about it in real time. It acts as
your second set of eyes, able to analyze content, help when you’re lost,
provide insights and answer your questions as you go. Whether you’re
browsing, working or deep in a project, Copilot Vision offers instant
insights and answers. ↫ The Windows Experience Blog team Do note that
Copilot Vision will not keep its data on your device, instead sending it
off to Microsoft. So, if you ever wanted to give Microsoft even more
insight into exactly what you’re doing with your Windows installation,
now’s your chance. Well, if you’re in the US, that is, and some its
capabilities are only available on Snapdragon PCs, not on Intel or AMD
machines. In the same blog post, Microsoft also highlights a few
actually useful features coming to Windows, like a colour picker in the
screenshot tool, the ability to change the lighting in photos, or having
the area selector in the screenshot tool snap to what it thinks is the
important part you wish to actually take a screenshot of. However,
Microsoft is also adding nonsense like sticker generators in Paint, text
generators in Word, and stuff related to Teams that makes me even
happier than I already am that I’m self-employed and work alone. If
you’re in the US, you can get these features now if you wish through
Windows Update.</p>

id="fedora-needs-to-embrace-flathub-and-heres-how-that-could-be-done">Fedora
needs to embrace Flathub, and here’s how that could be done</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>Earlier this year, we talked about a peculiar oddity concerning
Flatpaks and Fedora: unlike just about any other distribution, Fedora
maintains its own Flatpak repository, while everyone else just defaults
to Flathub. While there’s a few technical differences between Fedora
Flatpaks and Flathub Flatpaks, the main gist is that the Fedora ones are
built using Fedora’s own RPMs, while Flathub’s are built using different
means. This is an odd situation, since it does not reflect what users
really want – users seem to greatly prefer Flatpaks from Flathub, since
they have fewer bugs, are packaged by the applications’ creators, and
bugs in Flathub Flatpaks can be reported to the actual developers,
whereas bugs in Fedora Flatpaks generally cannot. As such, Fedora users
are often surprised to learn that the Flatpak they installed came from
Fedora instead of Flathub. Now, since Fedora’s long-term goal is to make
their immutable, Flatpak-focused variants the default, this situation
needs to be addressed. As such, Fedora and GNOME developer Michael
Catanzaro has published an incredibly detailed article outlining all the
issues and possible solutions and courses of action. The basic gist is
that before Fedora can consider switching from its own Flatpak
repository to Flathub, a number of shortcomings in Flathub must be
addressed: Some of these points are fairly obvious, but let’s go over
them anyway. A lot of binaries on Flathub are pre-built in that they are
not built using Flathub’s infrastructure, and as such, you don’t know if
anything has been done to the code between, say, the code’s release on
GitHub and the Flatpak you install on your computer. This obviously
needs to change, and ideally, all Flatpaks on Flathub should be
reproducible. End-of-life runtimes should obviously also not be a thing,
for entirely obvious reasons. Currently, a little under a third of
applications on Flathub use end-of-life runtimes, meaning the runtimes
they use are not receiving any security updates. The same applies to
external dependencies packaged inside Flatpaks; they can be outdated
too, but many Flatpaks do not use the designated tool to deal with this
issue. Obviously, holes in the Flatpak sandbox should not exist either,
again for entirely obvious reasons. Catanzaro proposes a number of
solutions to all of these problems, which require work from both Fedora
and Flathub to be implemented. On top of that, even once these issues
are satisfactorily addressed, there’s a debate to be had over the exact
way in which both the traditional and immutable variants of Fedora move
on over to Flathub – the variant I personally like the most is where the
core applications installed by default remain in control of Fedora,
while everything else gets installed from Flathub. Of course, this is
not of much relevance to people who prefer plain, traditional RPMs –
such as myself – to whom Flatpaks are more of a “if all else fails”
option than a default. While the immutable, Flatpak-based variants of
Fedora are definitely on their way to become the default option, the
traditional RPM variants will not be going anywhere, and will remain an
option as well. I think defaulting new users to the immutable variants
is the way to go, even if I personally won’t be using them.</p>

adding a feature in the latest Insider Preview to collect data when a
Windows 11 machine is experiencing slowness or sluggishness. As part of
our commitment to improving Windows performance, logs are now collected
when your PC has experienced any slow or sluggish performance. Windows
Insiders are encouraged to provide feedback when experiencing PC issues
related to slow or sluggish performance, allowing Feedback Hub to
automatically collect these logs, which will help us root cause issues
faster. Use the Desktop &gt; System Sluggishness category when filing
feedback to allow Feedback Hub to automatically pick up these logs.
These logs are stored locally (%systemRoot%folder) and only sent to
Microsoft via Feedback Hub when feedback is submitted. ↫ Amanda

smallest, actually usable window manager I know about. Even TinyWM is
twice as large. However, it doesn’t let you launch programs, or assign
key bindings. mwm does. ↫ Mwm’s GitHub page It will open a window, and
let you switch between windows, that are always fullscreen. No
titlebars, no virtual desktops, no menus, no nothing. This is the true
minimalist’s experience.</p>

<h2 id="an-artificially-complex-xml-schema-as-a-lock-in-tool">An
artificially complex XML schema as a lock-in tool</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>The Document Foundation, which developers LibreOffice, is mad at
Microsoft for the levels of complexity in the Microsoft 365 document
format. They claim Microsoft intentionally makes this format’s XML
schema as complex and obtuse as possible to lock users into the
Microsoft Office ecosystem. This artificial complexity is characterised
by a deeply nested tag structure with excessive abstraction, dozens or
even hundreds of optional or overloaded elements, non-intuitive naming
conventions, the widespread use of extension points and wildcards, the
multiple import of namespaces and type hierarchies, and sparse or
cryptic documentation. In the case of the Microsoft 365 document format,
the only characteristic not present is sparse or cryptic documentation,
given that we are talking about a set of documents totalling over 8,000
pages. All the other characteristics are present to a greater or lesser
extent, making life almost impossible for a developer trying to
implement the schema. ↫ Italo Vignoli I feel like this was widely known
already, since I distinctly remember the discussions around the
standardisation process for the Office Open XML file formats. Then, too,
it was claimed that Microsoft’s then-new XML file formats were far more
complex and obtuse than the existing, already standardised OpenDocument
file formats, and that there was no need to push Microsoft’s new file
formats through the process. These days, you might wonder how relevant
all of this still is, but considering vast swaths of the private,
corporate, government, and academic world still run on Microsoft Office
and its default file formats, it’s definitely still a hugely relevant
matter. As an office suite, you are basically required to support Office
Open XML, and if Microsoft is making that more complex and obtuse on
purpose, that’s a form of monopoly abuse that should be addressed.</p>
