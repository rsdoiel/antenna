id="fedora-needs-to-embrace-flathub-and-heres-how-that-could-be-done">Fedora
needs to embrace Flathub, and here’s how that could be done</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>Earlier this year, we talked about a peculiar oddity concerning
Flatpaks and Fedora: unlike just about any other distribution, Fedora
maintains its own Flatpak repository, while everyone else just defaults
to Flathub. While there’s a few technical differences between Fedora
Flatpaks and Flathub Flatpaks, the main gist is that the Fedora ones are
built using Fedora’s own RPMs, while Flathub’s are built using different
means. This is an odd situation, since it does not reflect what users
really want – users seem to greatly prefer Flatpaks from Flathub, since
they have fewer bugs, are packaged by the applications’ creators, and
bugs in Flathub Flatpaks can be reported to the actual developers,
whereas bugs in Fedora Flatpaks generally cannot. As such, Fedora users
are often surprised to learn that the Flatpak they installed came from
Fedora instead of Flathub. Now, since Fedora’s long-term goal is to make
their immutable, Flatpak-focused variants the default, this situation
needs to be addressed. As such, Fedora and GNOME developer Michael
Catanzaro has published an incredibly detailed article outlining all the
issues and possible solutions and courses of action. The basic gist is
that before Fedora can consider switching from its own Flatpak
repository to Flathub, a number of shortcomings in Flathub must be
addressed: Some of these points are fairly obvious, but let’s go over
them anyway. A lot of binaries on Flathub are pre-built in that they are
not built using Flathub’s infrastructure, and as such, you don’t know if
anything has been done to the code between, say, the code’s release on
GitHub and the Flatpak you install on your computer. This obviously
needs to change, and ideally, all Flatpaks on Flathub should be
reproducible. End-of-life runtimes should obviously also not be a thing,
for entirely obvious reasons. Currently, a little under a third of
applications on Flathub use end-of-life runtimes, meaning the runtimes
they use are not receiving any security updates. The same applies to
external dependencies packaged inside Flatpaks; they can be outdated
too, but many Flatpaks do not use the designated tool to deal with this
issue. Obviously, holes in the Flatpak sandbox should not exist either,
again for entirely obvious reasons. Catanzaro proposes a number of
solutions to all of these problems, which require work from both Fedora
and Flathub to be implemented. On top of that, even once these issues
are satisfactorily addressed, there’s a debate to be had over the exact
way in which both the traditional and immutable variants of Fedora move
on over to Flathub – the variant I personally like the most is where the
core applications installed by default remain in control of Fedora,
while everything else gets installed from Flathub. Of course, this is
not of much relevance to people who prefer plain, traditional RPMs –
such as myself – to whom Flatpaks are more of a “if all else fails”
option than a default. While the immutable, Flatpak-based variants of
Fedora are definitely on their way to become the default option, the
traditional RPM variants will not be going anywhere, and will remain an
option as well. I think defaulting new users to the immutable variants
is the way to go, even if I personally won’t be using them.</p>

wants to find out why Windows 11 is so slow</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>Microsoft wants to know why, exactly, Windows 11 is slow, so it’s
adding a feature in the latest Insider Preview to collect data when a
Windows 11 machine is experiencing slowness or sluggishness. As part of
our commitment to improving Windows performance, logs are now collected
when your PC has experienced any slow or sluggish performance. Windows
Insiders are encouraged to provide feedback when experiencing PC issues
related to slow or sluggish performance, allowing Feedback Hub to
automatically collect these logs, which will help us root cause issues
faster. Use the Desktop &gt; System Sluggishness category when filing
feedback to allow Feedback Hub to automatically pick up these logs.
These logs are stored locally (%systemRoot%folder) and only sent to
Microsoft via Feedback Hub when feedback is submitted. ↫ Amanda
Langowski and Brandon LeBlanc In case you want to solve performance
problems with Windows 11, just go here and follow the steps, and your
computer will be spry as a Spring chicken in a few minutes. I am very
funny.</p>

<p>Is KDE too much for you? GNOME tries to do too much? Xfce still a bit
too fancy? Do you need something smaller? Even more minimalist? What
about a mere 20 lines of code which provide the absolute barest possible
minimum of window management functionality? You need mwm. This is the
smallest, actually usable window manager I know about. Even TinyWM is
twice as large. However, it doesn’t let you launch programs, or assign
key bindings. mwm does. ↫ Mwm’s GitHub page It will open a window, and
let you switch between windows, that are always fullscreen. No
titlebars, no virtual desktops, no menus, no nothing. This is the true
minimalist’s experience.</p>

<h2 id="an-artificially-complex-xml-schema-as-a-lock-in-tool">An
artificially complex XML schema as a lock-in tool</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>The Document Foundation, which developers LibreOffice, is mad at
Microsoft for the levels of complexity in the Microsoft 365 document
format. They claim Microsoft intentionally makes this format’s XML
schema as complex and obtuse as possible to lock users into the
Microsoft Office ecosystem. This artificial complexity is characterised
by a deeply nested tag structure with excessive abstraction, dozens or
even hundreds of optional or overloaded elements, non-intuitive naming
conventions, the widespread use of extension points and wildcards, the
multiple import of namespaces and type hierarchies, and sparse or
cryptic documentation. In the case of the Microsoft 365 document format,
the only characteristic not present is sparse or cryptic documentation,
given that we are talking about a set of documents totalling over 8,000
pages. All the other characteristics are present to a greater or lesser
extent, making life almost impossible for a developer trying to
implement the schema. ↫ Italo Vignoli I feel like this was widely known
already, since I distinctly remember the discussions around the
standardisation process for the Office Open XML file formats. Then, too,
it was claimed that Microsoft’s then-new XML file formats were far more
complex and obtuse than the existing, already standardised OpenDocument
file formats, and that there was no need to push Microsoft’s new file
formats through the process. These days, you might wonder how relevant
all of this still is, but considering vast swaths of the private,
corporate, government, and academic world still run on Microsoft Office
and its default file formats, it’s definitely still a hugely relevant
matter. As an office suite, you are basically required to support Office
Open XML, and if Microsoft is making that more complex and obtuse on
purpose, that’s a form of monopoly abuse that should be addressed.</p>
