anesthesia for a tattoo? What anesthesiologists say you need to
know</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-10, updated: 2025-07-12, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>(BPT) - Tattoos have gone mainstream — about one in three U.S. adults
has at least one. Some people consider the pain of getting a tattoo part
of the experience or a rite of passage. Others may look for relief via
numbing creams, sprays, ice packs or even anesthesia. This is especially
true for large tattoos or long sessions, which can last eight hours or
more. If you are considering anesthesia for a lengthy tattoo session,
make sure the procedure follows the same safety standards as any
elective surgery or procedure, according to new guidance from the
American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA). With National Tattoo Day on
July 17, it’s the perfect time to remember that safety should be as much
of a priority as self-expression.</p>

lived long ago. But the oldest DNA obtained so far dates back about two
million years. Proteins, a cell’s molecular machinery, also offer
valuable information and have the virtue of surviving much longer, as

<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO &amp;#8212; OpenAI is close to releasing an AI-powered web browser that will challenge Alphabet&amp;#8217;s market-dominating Google Chrome, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters. The browser is slated to launch in the coming weeks, three of the people said, and aims to use artificial intelligence to fundamentally change how consumers browse the web. It will give OpenAI more direct access to a cornerstone of Google&amp;#8217;s success: user data. If adopted by the 500 million weekly active users of ChatGPT, OpenAI&amp;#8217;s browser could put pressure on a key component of rival Google&amp;#8217;s ad-money spigot. Chrome is an important pillar of Alphabet&amp;#8217;s ad business, which makes up nearly three-quarters of its revenue, as Chrome provides user information to help Alphabet target ads more effectively and profitably, and also gives Google a way to route search traffic to its own engine by default.&lt;/p&gt;
