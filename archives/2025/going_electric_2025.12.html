The fastest-growing EV brand in the US is not Tesla or Rivian. It’s GM’s
Chevrolet. With the electric Equinox, Blazer, and Silverado rolling out,
<a href="https://electrek.co/guides/chevrolet/">Chevy</a> is now the
fastest-growing EV brand in the US. Although Tesla still accounts for
about 50% of EV retail share, new models are eating away at its lead.

Tesla (TSLA) surged 10% this morning, fueled by money from retail

It is sending Tesla’s price-to-earning ratio back up to record highs,
which Musk warned could lead to the stock crashing “like a soufflé being

<p>
Global energy demand spiked in 2024, driven largely by surging
electricity use, according to a new report released today by the
International Energy Agency (IEA). Electricity consumption jumped by
nearly 1,100 terawatt-hours – a hefty 4.3% increase – nearly twice the
annual average growth of the past decade.
</p>
<p>
This dramatic rise was largely fueled by the electrification of
transportation, record-breaking global temperatures that ramped up
cooling needs, coupled with increased industrial activity, and growing
energy demand from data centers and AI applications.

Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) is stagnating with no real improvement

Cynics will point at big rebates and claim they mean the vehicle isn’t
selling, but that just exposes them as industry noobs. A rebate is a
powerful financial tool that helps dealers overcome obstacles like
negative equity, poor credit, down payment requirements, and interest
rate objections so you can drive home in the car of your dreams today.
