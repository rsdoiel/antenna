The SGMW Wuling Hongguang EV offers Chinese car buyers five or
seven-seat configurations, 300 km of range (that’s about 185 miles to
you and me), and a $9,600 price tag – but it’s the 1000 km EREV version
that would take the US by storm in 2025.

We built a tracker to follow Tesla’s income catching up to Musk’s

company.

<p>
Global energy demand spiked in 2024, driven largely by surging
electricity use, according to a new report released today by the
International Energy Agency (IEA). Electricity consumption jumped by
nearly 1,100 terawatt-hours – a hefty 4.3% increase – nearly twice the
annual average growth of the past decade.
</p>
<p>
This dramatic rise was largely fueled by the electrification of
transportation, record-breaking global temperatures that ramped up
cooling needs, coupled with increased industrial activity, and growing
energy demand from data centers and AI applications.

We already know that BMW closed off 2024 with a banner year for its
electrified “i” models – but it took a while for the larger picture to
become clear. Not only is BMW succeeding with EVs, the Bavarians are
outselling their two closest competitors <em>combined</em>. (!)

Full Self-Driving is stagnating after Elon said it is going

<p>
Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) is stagnating with no real improvement
in miles between disengagement in months just as CEO Elon Musk said it
is going exponential.
</p>
<p>
The stagnation of FSD could be explained by Tesla making a pivot and
focusing on its geo-fenced ride-hailing service instead of its
long-standing promises.

Cynics will point at big rebates and claim they mean the vehicle isn’t
selling, but that just exposes them as industry noobs. A rebate is a
powerful financial tool that helps dealers overcome obstacles like
negative equity, poor credit, down payment requirements, and interest
rate objections so you can drive home in the car of your dreams today.
</p>
<p>
If you’re dealing with any of the above, pay attention: these EVs could
get you behind the wheel of a new electric ride sooner than you think!

A video came out last week comparing two approaches to autonomous
vehicles: cameras and LiDAR. The video was fun, as YouTube videos are
wont to be, but the fallout from it has been anything but fun, with
pretty much everyone missing the point of the video in the first place.

Xiaomi is building some of the best,
<a href="https://electrek.co/2025/03/15/tesla-model-s-plaid-smoked-drag-race-xiaomis-su7-ultra/">most
capable high-performance electric cars in the world right now</a> – and
Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun wants you to know that they’re among the safest, too.
To prove it, he’s wrapping a watermelon in the company’s “bulletproof”
battery armor and dropping it off a six-storey building.
