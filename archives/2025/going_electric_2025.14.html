We recently had the chance to take an up-close look at the 100% electric
EF-12 Escape. The passenger hydrofoil ferry is one of the many vessels
the UK-based company designed, and we might be seeing more of them in
the near future as the company expands into the US.

The US wind industry installed just 5.2 gigawatts (GW) in 2024 – the
lowest level in a decade, according to Wood Mackenzie’s new US Wind
Energy Monitor
<a href="https://www.woodmac.com/industry/power-and-renewables/us-wind-energy-monitor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a>.
Installations are expected to rebound in 2025, but the real concern lies
in US wind’s sharply downgraded 5-year outlook. As for the reason behind
that bleak forecast, we’ll give you one guess as to why, and it starts
with a T.

<a href="https://electrek.co/guides/volkswagen/">Volkswagen’s</a>
smallest and cheapest EV, the ID.1, will start at around $22,000 (20,000
euros) when it arrives. Despite its compact size, the entry-level
electric car could be the brand’s biggest hit yet with advanced new
software from Rivian. Here’s a closer look at the upcoming EV.
