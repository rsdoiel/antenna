The US wind industry installed just 5.2 gigawatts (GW) in 2024 – the
lowest level in a decade, according to Wood Mackenzie’s new US Wind
Energy Monitor
<a href="https://www.woodmac.com/industry/power-and-renewables/us-wind-energy-monitor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a>.
Installations are expected to rebound in 2025, but the real concern lies
in US wind’s sharply downgraded 5-year outlook. As for the reason behind
that bleak forecast, we’ll give you one guess as to why, and it starts
with a T.

Specialized has announced a voluntary recall for several of its popular

clothing-eating drivetrain setup that may be a bit too hungry for its
own good.
