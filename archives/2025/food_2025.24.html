<h2 id="lucy-wangs-banana-brulee">Lucy Wang’s Banana Brulee</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-18, from: Taste of Home</p>
<p>We had a bunch of overly ripe bananas and at first I thought of
banana bread, but then I made this banana brulee instead and it’s so
much better! The mildly sweet custard is perfect as a pudding, or pipe
it into dinner rolls for a bakery-level pastry. —Lucy Wang, Los Angeles,
California</p>

HIDDEN GEMS OF IRISH FOOD: LESSER-KNOWN REGIONAL DISHES WORTH
TRYING</h2>

Waterford Blaa – A Floury Bun with a Protected Name 3. Drisheen, Dulse
&amp; Dillisk – Coastal Flavours from Cork to Down 4. Boxty and Cavan
Bacon – Ulster’s Humble Staples 5. Connemara Lamb and the Taste of the
West Why Regional Irish Food Deserves the Spotlight Irish food is
globally known for comforting classics like Irish stew, soda bread, and
colcannon. But beyond these staples lies a rich world of local
delicacies tied to county, soil, sea, and centuries-old traditions.
These lesser-known dishes tell stories of survival, celebration, and
place. From salted seaweed to sheep raised on rugged hillsides, Irish
regional food is deeply rooted in heritage—and absolutely worth
discovering. As Ireland’s food scene continues to evolve, chefs and home
cooks alike are rediscovering these regional specialties. Some are being
protected by EU status, while others live on in rural kitchens and
farmers’ markets. If you want to eat like a true local, these are the
dishes to seek out. Waterford Blaa – A Floury Bun with a Protected Name
Where to Find It: Waterford and surrounding areas What It Is: A soft
white bread roll, dusted heavily with flour and protected under EU PGI
(Protected Geographical Indication) status. The Waterford blaa might
sound like a simple bread roll, but to the locals, it’s a cherished part
of daily life. Its origins are believed to date back to the 17th century
with the arrival of the Huguenots, who introduced French-style white
flour baking. The name “blaa” may come from the French word “blanc,”
meaning white. Soft and slightly chewy, the blaa is typically served
with butter, rashers, or sausage for breakfast—but also makes a perfect
sandwich base any time of day. Only bakeries in Waterford can produce
the true version, making it a food worth traveling for. Try it with:
Dry-cured bacon and Irish cheddar for a classic Waterford sandwich. View
Our Blaa Recipe Drisheen, Dulse &amp; Dillisk – Coastal Flavours from
Cork to Down Where to Find It: Cork, Derry, Down, and coastal towns
along the Atlantic Drisheen: A traditional blood sausage made with
sheep’s blood, oatmeal, and herbs, primarily eaten in Cork. It’s often
served with tripe in a dish known locally as “packet and tripe.”
Dulse/Dillisk: Edible seaweed harvested along Ireland’s rocky
coastlines. Chewy, salty, and rich in minerals, dulse is often eaten
dried as a snack or chopped into seafood dishes. These dishes are strong
reminders of Ireland’s resourceful coastal communities. Where meat was
scarce, seaweed and offal-based recipes like drisheen provided vital
nutrition. Today, they offer a connection to a more sustainable and
ancient way of eating. Modern Twist: Seaweed now features in artisan
butters, soda breads, and even chocolate across Ireland’s gourmet food
scene. View Our Drisheen Recipe Related Article: The health benefits of
irish sea vegetables: from kelp to dulse and nori Boxty and Cavan Bacon
– Ulster’s Humble Staples Where to Find It: Counties Cavan, Leitrim,
Fermanagh, and across Ulster Boxty: A traditional potato pancake made
with a mix of grated raw and mashed potatoes. It’s a staple in Northern
and Western counties, especially around Leitrim and Cavan. Cavan Bacon:
Cured bacon or gammon from County Cavan, often paired with cabbage,
parsley sauce, or even soda bread stuffing. Boxty’s versatility allows
it to be pan-fried, boiled, or baked. It was once considered a poor
man’s food, designed to stretch ingredients during lean times, but now
it’s featured on many restaurant menus with upscale accompaniments like
smoked salmon, wild mushrooms, or poached eggs. Tip: Look for local
cafés in Leitrim or Sligo offering boxty brunches for a true regional
experience. View Our Boxty Recipe Connemara Lamb and the Taste of the
West Where to Find It: Connemara, County Galway, and surrounding western
regions What It Is: Free-range lamb raised on the heather-covered hills
and salty grasses of the Connemara region, known for its distinctive
flavor and tenderness. Connemara lamb is a true example of “terroir”—the
idea that the environment shapes the taste of food. These sheep graze
freely across the rugged west coast landscape, and the result is meat
that’s earthy, slightly gamey, and deeply flavorful. It’s a seasonal
delight, often celebrated in local food festivals. This lamb is often
simply roasted or slow-cooked with rosemary and garlic, letting the
natural flavor shine. Many foodies travel to Galway just for a taste
during peak season. Pair it with: Creamy mashed potatoes and wild garlic
butter for an unforgettable Irish dinner. Conclusion: Celebrating
Ireland’s Culinary Diversity These lesser-known regional foods aren’t
just delicious—they’re stories, landscapes, and legacies on a plate.
While Guinness and Irish stew remain icons, it’s dishes like the
Waterford blaa, boxty, and Connemara lamb that truly showcase the
diversity of Ireland’s culinary culture. Whether you’re exploring a
farmers’ market or a countryside café, keep an eye out for these hidden
gems—they may just surprise your tastebuds and connect you more deeply
to the soul of Ireland.

<h2 id="carrageen-moss-jelly">CARRAGEEN MOSS JELLY</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-16, from: Irish Food Hub</p>
<p>
Carrageen Moss Jelly – A Traditional Irish Seaweed Dessert Preparation
Time: 15 minutes (plus soaking time) Cooking Time: 30 minutes Serves: 4
Carrageen Moss Jelly is a unique and wholesome dessert made from dried
Irish moss (a type of red seaweed) that has long been prized in Ireland
for its health-giving properties. Traditionally used to soothe coughs
and colds, this natural gelatin alternative creates a light, nourishing
jelly often flavored with lemon or vanilla. It’s a taste of coastal
heritage in every spoonful. Ingredients 15g dried carrageen moss (also
called Irish moss) 600ml (2½ cups) water 1 cinnamon stick (optional) 1
lemon – zest and juice 1–2 tbsp honey or sugar (to taste) 250ml (1 cup)
milk (or almond/oat milk for dairy-free option) 1 tsp vanilla extract
(optional) Instructions Rinse the dried carrageen moss under cold water
to remove any sand or impurities. Soak in cold water for about 15
minutes until it expands and softens. Drain and place in a saucepan with
600ml of fresh water, the cinnamon stick, and lemon zest. Bring to a
gentle boil, then simmer for 25–30 minutes, stirring occasionally. The
liquid will thicken as the moss releases its natural gel. Strain the
mixture through a sieve or muslin cloth into a bowl, pressing down to
extract as much liquid as possible. Discard the solids. Add honey or
sugar, lemon juice, milk, and vanilla to the warm liquid. Stir well
until combined. Pour into serving glasses or molds. Let cool, then chill
in the fridge for at least 2–3 hours until set. Serving Suggestions
Serve chilled, plain or topped with a dollop of whipped cream, fruit
compote, or a drizzle of heather honey. A refreshing and soothing
dessert with a rich Irish coastal history. Health Note Carrageen moss
has been used in traditional Irish remedies for generations to help with
colds, congestion, and digestion. While not a substitute for medical
advice, it remains a time-honored comfort during flu season.

<h2 id="dublin-coddle-soup">DUBLIN CODDLE SOUP</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-16, from: Irish Food Hub</p>
<p>
Dublin Coddle Soup – A Hearty Twist on an Irish Classic Preparation
Time: 15 minutes Cooking Time: 45 minutes Serves: 4–6 Dublin Coddle Soup
is a comforting and brothy version of the traditional Irish coddle – a
dish beloved in the capital for generations. Featuring tender sausages,
smoky bacon, soft potatoes, and sweet onions all simmered in a rich
stock, this one-pot wonder captures the rustic soul of Irish home
cooking. Perfect for chilly days, casual family dinners, or a taste of
Dublin heritage in a bowl. Ingredients 4 pork sausages (or Irish-style
bangers) 150g thick-cut bacon or rashers, chopped 1 large onion, sliced
2 cloves garlic, minced 3 medium potatoes, peeled and diced 2 carrots,
sliced (optional) 1 bay leaf 1 tsp dried thyme 1 tbsp chopped fresh
parsley (plus extra for garnish) 1 litre (4 cups) chicken or vegetable
stock Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste 1 tbsp butter or oil
for sautéing Instructions In a large pot, heat the butter or oil over
medium heat. Brown the sausages on all sides, then remove and slice into
thick chunks. Add the bacon to the same pot and cook until lightly
crisp. Add the onions and garlic, sautéing until soft and fragrant.
Return the sausages to the pot along with potatoes, carrots, thyme, and
bay leaf. Stir to combine. Pour in the stock and bring to a gentle boil.
Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 30–35 minutes, or until the potatoes
are tender and the flavors have melded. Season with salt and pepper to
taste. Remove the bay leaf before serving. Serving Suggestions Ladle
into warm bowls and garnish with chopped parsley. Serve with slices of
buttered soda bread or crusty brown bread to soak up the flavorful
broth. A pint of Irish stout makes the perfect pairing. Tip For a
thicker consistency, lightly mash some of the potatoes in the pot before
serving. You can also stir in a splash of cream for added richness.
