## Interstellar MegaChef by Lavanya Lakshminarayan: Review by Ian Mond

date: 2025-01-11, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>Interstellar MegaChef</strong>, Lavanya Lakshminarayan (Solaris 978-1-83786-233-7, $16.99, 400pp, tp) November 2024.</p>
<p>I’ve always loved a good cooking show. Back in the day, it was <strong>Top Chef </strong>(where a contestant always undercooked the chicken) and <strong>Great British Menu </strong>(where every pudding had to include rhubarb). Now, I’m obsessed with Uncle Roger’s YouTube channel. His takedown of Jamie Oliver’s Egg Fried Rice, with 28 million views and over one million likes,  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/01/interstellar-megachef-by-lavanya-lakshminarayan-review-by-ian-mond/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## Dungeon Crawler Carl by Matt Dinniman: Review by Gabino Iglesias

date: 2025-01-10, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>Dungeon Crawler Carl</strong>, Matt Dinniman (Dandy House 979-8-6885-9150-7, $13.99, 400pp, tp) September 2020. (Ace 978-0-59382-024-7, $30.00, 464pp, hc) August 2024. Cover by George Towne.</p>
<p><strong>Dungeon Crawler Carl </strong>is not really a book; it’s a long joke, a gimmick, a video game turned into fiction. The thing is, it works. It has spots where it is juvenile or a little slow, but author Matt Dinniman clearly had a blast writing  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/01/dungeon-crawler-carl-by-matt-dinniman-review-by-gabino-iglesias/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

<p><strong>Countess</strong>, Suzan Palumbo (ECW Press 978-1770417571, $16.95, 168pp, tp) September 2024</p>
<p>Trinidadian-Canadian author Suzan Palumbo draws on Caribbean history, culture, and experi­ence in her space opera novella <strong>Countess. </strong>Pa­lumbo has been previously best known for short fiction: Her collection <strong>Skin Thief </strong>was published by Neon Hemlock Press in 2023.</p>
<p>As a novella, <strong>Countess </strong>is a mixed bag. Its first half is genuinely compelling, while its second feelts to me  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/01/countess-by-suzan-palumbo-review-by-liz-bourke/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## Death of the Author by Nnedi Okorafor: Review by Gary K. Wolfe

<p><strong>Death of the Author</strong>, Nnedi Okorafor (Morrow 978-0-06-344578-9, $30.00, 448pp, hc) January 2025.</p>
<p>For a certain generation of academics, ‘‘the death of the author’’ is the title of an influential 1967 essay by Roland Barthes arguing against interpreting literature in terms of the author’s identity or psychology. Nnedi Okorafor’s <strong>Death of the Author </strong>makes a brief and oblique reference to this in an early chapter in which the protagonist,  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/01/death-of-the-author-by-nnedi-okorafor-review-by-gary-k-wolfe/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## Sophie Haeder Guest Post–“From Dice to Pen: How Tabletop Roleplaying Games Are Fuelling a New Wave of Fantasy Writing”

date: 2025-01-08, from: Locus Magazine

<p>As a lifelong lover of all things nerdy and a Dungeon Master for my own Dungeons &#38; Dragons group, I’ve spent countless hours weaving intricate worlds, devising devious plots, and watching as my players gleefully derailed them. For me, tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs) are more than just a pastime. They’re a way of life, a source of endless creativity, and, as it turns out, the perfect training ground for writing  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/01/sophie-haeder-guest-post-from-dice-to-pen-how-tabletop-roleplaying-games-are-fuelling-a-new-wave-of-fantasy-writing/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

<p><strong>The Kwaidan Collection </strong>is not only a fascinating illustrated volume of vintage supernatural Japanese folk tales, brilliantly interpreted by acclaimed multimedia artist Kent Williams, it’s historically significant. These stories were literally rescued by the eccentric multilingual world traveler Lafcadio Hearn (1850-1904) in the early 20th century when the  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/01/the-kwaidan-collection-by-lafcadio-hearn-review-by-karen-haber/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

<p>“If everything’s being played on the surface, it’s very hard to make that character come to life.<br>You want hinterland, you want subtext. You want the things that are buried, the things that we don’t know about them, the things that maybe they don’t know about themselves. And always, the story is about this excavation of what’s underneath the surface. One way or the other, that’s kind of what story <em>is.</em> It’s about bringing things to the surface,” says <em>Conclave</em> screenwriter Peter Straughan, about the importance of giving your characters secrets.&nbsp;<br><br>In this episode, we speak to Peter Straughan about his powerful film <em>Conclave</em>, starring Ralph Fiennes, Stanley Tucci and John Lithgow. Based on the book by Robert Harris, the movie follows five very different modern Catholic Cardinals as they go through the process of electing a new Pope. Straughan talks about why he loves a flawed hero, getting to tour the Vatican, what surprised him the most, and whether or not he thinks the real Pope will watch this movie.&nbsp;<br><br>Having also written the TV show <em>Wolf Hall</em> about Tudor England, Straughan also talks about the surprising connection between King Henry VIII and the modern Catholic Church.&nbsp;<br><br>“Both the world of the Tudors and the world of <em>Conclave</em> give us a way of looking at human behavior and the pursuit of power from a sort of angle that makes it particularly clear and fresh, without the clutter of the normal secular world of elections, that really anchors it in the human individual. So, Tudor England was maybe the last time where the sexual desires of one man was going to dominate the political landscape of an entire country. Maybe not the last time. Maybe this still happens in the world. But it becomes really pared down to basics, so you see very clearly what’s going on. And I think it feels the same with <em>Conclave</em>, it’s about the personalities and the morals of these few individuals,” says Straughan.&nbsp;<br><br>Just a warning, there are spoilers about the ending of <em>Conclave</em> in this episode, but we give you plenty of warning before they are discussed.&nbsp;<br><br>To hear more about Straughan’s writing process, listen to the podcast.&nbsp;</p>

## Remember You Will Die by Eden Robins: Review by Ian Mond

date: 2025-01-05, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>Remember You Will Die</strong>, Eden Robins (Source­books Landmark 978-1-72825-603-0, $16.99, 336pp, tp) October 2024.</p>
<p>It has been another excellent year for uncon­ventional narratives. There’s <strong>Rakesfall </strong>by Vajra Chandrasekera, which I called “a full-frontal deconstruction of narrative and genre”; there’s Rita Bullwinkel’s magnificent <strong>Headshot</strong>, a story structured around the intense, chaotic and bal­letic bouts of a junior girl’s boxing tournament; and there are the 1,281 F-bombs that punctuate the  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/01/remember-you-will-die-by-eden-robins-review-by-ian-mond/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>
