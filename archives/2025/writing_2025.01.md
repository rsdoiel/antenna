## "Played Games" now displays your play times

date: 2025-01-06, from: IF Database News

When you go to <a href="https://ifdb.org/personal">My Activity</a> you can find <a href="https://ifdb.org/playlist">a list of all of your played games</a> (games where you've checked the "I've played it" checkbox). If you submitted a vote for how long it takes to finish the game, we'll now include your play time there, as well.

## Sort search results by Estimated Play Time

date: 2025-01-06, from: IF Database News

You can now sort game results by their estimated play time–from shortest to longest, or longest to shortest. When you sort this way, each game’s estimated play time will display as part of the results. (IFDB's <a href="https://ifdb.org/api/search">search API</a> and <a href="https://ifdb.org/api/viewgame">viewgame API</a> will also include estimated play times, where available.)

## Multiple "Play Online" Links

date: 2025-01-06, from: IF Database News

Now, games can have multiple "Play Online" links, if we have multiple external links that can be played online. (The big blue "Play Online" button will link to the first "Play Online" link on the list.) We've also updated IFDB's <a href="https://ifdb.org/api/viewgame">viewgame API</a> to match. The API now includes a <code>primaryPlayOnlineUrl</code> as well as separate <code>playOnlineUrl</code> links on each external link.

## Remember You Will Die by Eden Robins: Review by Ian Mond

date: 2025-01-05, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>Remember You Will Die</strong>, Eden Robins (Source­books Landmark 978-1-72825-603-0, $16.99, 336pp, tp) October 2024.</p>
<p>It has been another excellent year for uncon­ventional narratives. There’s <strong>Rakesfall </strong>by Vajra Chandrasekera, which I called “a full-frontal deconstruction of narrative and genre”; there’s Rita Bullwinkel’s magnificent <strong>Headshot</strong>, a story structured around the intense, chaotic and bal­letic bouts of a junior girl’s boxing tournament; and there are the 1,281 F-bombs that punctuate the  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/01/remember-you-will-die-by-eden-robins-review-by-ian-mond/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## Dream Machine: A Portrait of Artificial Intelligence by Appupen & Laurent Daudet: Review by Archita Mittra

date: 2025-01-05, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>Dream Machine: A Portrait of Artificial Intel­ligence</strong>, Appupen &#38; Laurent Daudet (The MIT Press 978-0-26255-129-8, $29.95, 160pp, tp) August 2024.</p>
<p>The graphic novel <strong>Dream Machine </strong>is the brainchild of versatile Indian artist Appu­pen (known for <strong>Legends of Halahala</strong>, <strong>The Snake and the Lotus</strong>, and other inventive myth-building comics) and Laurent Daudet, a French physicist and AI researcher. Educational and engaging, the book delves into the wide-reaching ramifications  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/01/dream-machine-a-portrait-of-artificial-intelligence-by-appupen-laurent-daudet-review-by-archita-mittra/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>
