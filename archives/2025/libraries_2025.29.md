## Connecting the dots: FWFs transition to linked grant metadata to support a thriving culture of openness

date: 2025-07-23, from: Crossref Blog

<p>As a new Community Engagement Manager at Crossref, dedicated to working with the funders community, I frequently hear requests for examples and case studies of adopting Crossref&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/grant-linking-system/">Grant Linking System (GLS)</a> by &lsquo;funders like us&rsquo;. This has spurred me to start a series of blog posts presenting funders&rsquo; perspectives on joining Crossref and using our system &ndash; to demonstrate how it&rsquo;s done. </p>
<p>In the first case study of a series, I speak with Katharina Rieck, Open Science Manager at the Austrian Science Fund (FWF), Austria&rsquo;s national funding agency for basic research, about the agency&rsquo;s approach to research metadata, transparency and openness, and the role that the Grant Linking System plays in it. </p>
<p>With a strong track record in Open Access and Open Science, the FWF&rsquo;s decision to implement grant IDs represents more than a mere technical upgrade. What began as an initiative to enhance the openness and interoperability of grant information illustrates that truly open research infrastructure is not solely a matter of systems, but about people, policies and collaboration.</p>
<p>Katharina was also elected to the <a href="https://www.crossref.org/board-and-governance">Crossref Board</a> at our November 2024 Annual Meeting, and started her three-year term in January 2025.</p>
<h3 id="could-you-introduce-your-organisation-and-what-is-your-role">Could you introduce your organisation? And what is your role?</h3>
<p>The Austrian Science Fund (FWF) is Austria&rsquo;s national funding agency for basic research. The FWF funds all disciplines, from Social Sciences and Humanities to Life Sciences and Natural Sciences and Technology. As Open Science Manager, I am responsible for developing the FWF&rsquo;s Open Science strategy, including the development of the <a href="https://www.fwf.ac.at/en/about-us/what-we-do/open-science/open-access-policy/open-access-policy-for-peer-reviewed-publications" target="_blank">Open Access Policy for Peer-Reviewed Publications</a>, the <a href="https://www.fwf.ac.at/en/about-us/what-we-do/open-science/open-access-policy/open-access-policy-for-research-data" target="_blank">Open Access Policy for Research Data</a> as well as the FWF <a href="https://www.fwf.ac.at/en/about-us/what-we-do/open-science/research-data-management" target="_blank">Research Data Management Policy</a>. I am also responsible for the development and implementation of funding instruments such as the FWF <a href="https://www.fwf.ac.at/en/funding/portfolio/communication/open-access-block-grant" target="_blank">Open-Access Block Grant</a> and support for <a href="https://www.fwf.ac.at/en/about-us/what-we-do/open-science/open-science-infrastructures" target="_blank">Open Science infrastructures</a>.</p>
<h3 id="what-motivated-you-to-join-crossref">What motivated you to join Crossref?</h3>
<p>For more than two decades, the FWF has actively promoted and supported various aspects of Open Science. In 2004, it published its first Open Access Policy, making it one of the first funding organizations worldwide to adopt an Open Access policy for publications. In line with the commitment to open research information as a core pillar of Open Science, the FWF has taken further steps to strengthen openness and transparency: it joined <a href="https://api.crossref.org/funders/501100002428/works?filter=type:grant" target="_blank">Crossref to register grant DOIs</a> and became a signatory of the <a href="https://www.fwf.ac.at/en/news/detail/fwf-signs-barcelona-declaration-on-open-research-information" target="_blank">Barcelona Declaration on Open Research Information</a> and joined <a href="https://api.crossref.org/funders/501100002428/works?filter=type:grant" target="_blank">Crossref to register grant DOIs.</a></p>
<p>While funding metadata––information about projects funded by the FWF––has long been freely available on our website, the launch of the <a href="https://www.fwf.ac.at/en/discover/research-radar" target="_blank">Research Radar</a> in 2023 marked a significant step forward. Our goal was not only to maintain accessibility but to ensure that the data published in the Research Radar is interoperable and aligned with the FAIR principles. By implementing the Grant Linking System from Crossref, we assign each FWF funded project a unique, persistent identifier with associated metadata, helping to make FWF grant information open, interoperable and sustainable.</p>
<h3 id="can-you-tell-us-about-your-experience-using-the-grant-linking-system">Can you tell us about your experience using the Grant Linking System?</h3>
<p>We have been using the Grant Linking System since November 2023. With the launch of the FWF&rsquo;s new website and the introduction of the Research Radar, we began registering Crossref grant IDs (DOIs) for all grants included in the Research Radar database. As a result, all FWF-funded projects dating back to 1995 are now uniquely identifiable. The process of registering grant metadata with Crossref is straightforward, and we have set up a smooth internal workflow that enables the registration of DOIs after the FWF&rsquo;s funding decision.</p>
<p>It is important to note that implementing Crossref grant IDs involved more than just a technical setup––it required the development of new internal processes and coordination through a dedicated Crossref grant DOI implementation group. The implementation process also resulted in a revised structure for grant numbers (DOI suffixes) for FWF-funded projects, establishing a sustainable and future-proof system.</p>
<h3 id="how-was-your-journey-to-socialise-the-grant-linking-system-within-your-research-community-how-did-you-communicate-the-importance-of-identifiers-and-grant-metadata-to-your-grant-holders">How was your journey to socialise the Grant Linking System within your research community? How did you communicate the importance of identifiers and grant metadata to your grant holders?</h3>
<p>The introduction of grant DOIs was supported by a comprehensive communication strategy, including dedicated online resources (e.g., <a href="https://www.fwf.ac.at/en/news/detail/neue-identifikations-nummer-fuer-fwf-projekte" target="_blank">New Identification Numbers for FWF Projects –– FWF</a>), updates across multiple pages of the FWF website (such as <a href="https://www.fwf.ac.at/en/funding/steps-to-your-fwf-project/carrying-out-your-project" target="_blank">Carrying out Your Project –– FWF</a>), and presentations at various events. This communication strategy aimed to explain the purpose and value of the &ldquo;new numbers&rdquo; ensuring that researchers and stakeholders understood how this contributes to greater visibility, traceability, and openness of funded research.</p>
<p>As a funding organisation, we require grant recipients to acknowledge FWF support in all research outputs resulting from their projects. With the integration of grant DOIs into FWF&rsquo;s metadata, the standardised acknowledgment text was updated to ensure that the DOIs are now included in outputs. The new required wording is: &lsquo;This research was funded in whole or in part by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [grant DOI],&rsquo; and is now a requirement in the FWF funding agreement. Including the grant DOI both in the output metadata and the acknowledgment text enhances traceability and supports more effective analysis of FWF-funded outputs.</p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-find-useful-about-registering-grant-metadata-with-crossref">What do you find useful about registering grant metadata with Crossref?</h3>
<p>One of the key benefits of registering grant metadata is the enhanced interconnectivity and the unique identification of FWF&rsquo;s grant information. By registering our grants with Crossref, funding information becomes more than just information on the FWF website––it becomes interoperable data that is accessible and reusable. This not only increases visibility but also enables us to better analyse the outcomes of funded projects and ensures that the data is accessible as well as (re)usable by the broader research community.</p>
<p>In addition to assigning Crossref Grant IDs and registering grant metadata, the FWF has required <a href="https://orcid.org/" target="_blank">ORCID IDs</a> for researchers since 2016 and mandates the use of <a href="https://ror.org/" target="_blank">ROR IDs</a> for institutions. The consistent use of persistent identifiers in metadata ensures the interoperability of FWF grant information and facilitates seamless integration with external data sources.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-your-hopes-for-the-gls-and-greater-transparency-in-funding-metadata-in-general">What are your hopes for the GLS and greater transparency in funding metadata in general?</h3>
<p>The FAIRness and openness of research information––including metadata on funding information, research outputs, researchers, and institutions––are fundamental to a well-functioning research ecosystem. I hope to see a broader adoption of persistent identifiers in metadata, particularly in grant information, as well as a broader commitment to openly sharing research information as expressed in the Barcelona Declaration. Moreover, a key objective should be to ensure the highest possible accuracy of metadata at the point of entry. This entails, for instance, that publication metadata accurately includes funding metadata.</p>
<h3 id="what-were-the-key-challenges-you-encountered-when-embracing-the-gls-and-how-did-you-overcome-them">What were the key challenges you encountered when embracing the GLS, and how did you overcome them?</h3>
<p>One of the key challenges we encountered when adopting the GLS was ensuring seamless integration in our existing IT infrastructure and workflows. Integrating the new number across different systems required considerable coordination. We overcame this challenge by establishing a dedicated implementation team that included IT experts.</p>
<p>Another challenge involved communicating and disseminating information regarding the grant DOI, ensuring that researchers and other relevant stakeholders were adequately informed. This was successfully managed through targeted and comprehensive communication efforts.</p>
<h3 id="based-on-your-experience-what-would-be-your-advice-for-colleagues-from-other-research-funders">Based on your experience, what would be your advice for colleagues from other research funders?</h3>
<p>It is important to recognise that registering grant identifers and metadata goes beyond a mere technical implementation. This is an opportunity to engage with diverse stakeholders, rethink processes and highlight the value of open funding metadata for the entire research community.</p>
<p>We are grateful to Katharina Rieck and FWF for generously sharing their insights and know-how. Their experience highlights the importance of seeing metadata not just as information, but as a shared resource that connects and empowers the research community.</p>
