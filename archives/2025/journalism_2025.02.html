<p>After hearing from a neighbor that his family’s Altadena home had
burned down, Zion Berry knew he had to see it for himself.  He drove to
his home of over 12 years on Wednesday after his neighborhood had been
destroyed by the Altadena fire, which started near Pasadena and Altadena
on Tuesday and has since claimed over 14,000 acres of land.  While
driving and walking through his hometown, the first-year music
performance student said he saw power lines on fire, street signs
missing and chimneys with no houses left standing, including his
own.</p>
