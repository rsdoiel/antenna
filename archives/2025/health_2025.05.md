## Risk factors associated with mortality and pathogen characteristics of bloodstream infection-induced severe sepsis in the pediatric intensive care unit: a retrospective cohort study

date: 2025-02-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundBloodstream infection (BSI)-induced severe sepsis is a common cause of mortality, frequently resulting in septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). This study aimed to analyze mortality risk factors and summarize pathogen characteristics associated with BSI-induced severe sepsis in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU).MethodsThis retrospective study was conducted at a tertiary pediatric hospital between January 2015 and December 2023, encompassing children with BSI-induced severe sepsis in the PICU. Clinical characteristics, laboratory parameters, pathogen characteristics, and drug resistance profiles of the patients were collected. Clinical and laboratory indicators along with pathogen characteristics were summarized. Logistic regression analysis was employed to identify independent risk factors associated with 28-day mortality.ResultsA total of 192 patients with bloodstream infection (BSI)-induced severe sepsis were identified, with a 28-day in-hospital mortality rate of 36.98% (71/192). The incidence of septic shock (42.1% vs. 69%, P < 0.001) and AKI (14% vs. 31%, P = 0.005) was significantly lower in the survival group compared to the non-survival group. In multivariate analysis, independent risk factors for 28-day mortality were the pediatric sequential organ failure assessment (pSOFA) score (OR 1.176; 95% CI: 1.046-1.321, p = 0.007) and the P/F value (OR 0.994; 95% CI: 0.991-0.997, P < 0.001). Double organism growth was detected in 8 cultures, and a total of 200 pathogenic bacteria were isolated from all blood cultures. Of these, 110 strains (55.0%) were Gram-negative bacteria, 88 strains (44.0%) were gram-positive bacteria, and 2 strains (1.0%) were Candida albicans. The most commonly isolated pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus, Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, and Escherichia coli. The detection rate of carbapenem resistance (CR) in Acinetobacter baumannii (66.7%) was higher than that in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15.4%). The detection rates of extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistance (ECR) and fluoroquinolone resistance (FQR) in Escherichia coli (E. coli) were higher than those in Klebsiella pneumoniae.ConclusionIn the PICU, higher mortality was observed in children with BSI-induced severe sepsis who presented with elevated pSOFA scores and low P/F values. Acinetobacter baumannii exhibited the highest levels of CR and FQR, while Escherichia coli demonstrated the highest level of ECR.

## Correlation between uterine microbiota and pregnancy outcomes of embryo transfer in overweight and obese women

date: 2025-02-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectiveCurrently, it has been reported that uterine microbiota affected pregnancy outcomes in assisted reproductive technology, but little was known in obese women. Thus, this study aims to explore how body weight affects pregnancy outcomes by comparing the differences in uterine microbiota between women of normal weight and those with obesity or overweight.MethodsThe study included 45 embryo transfer cycles. Patients were divided into two groups based on body mass index (BMI): normal-weight group, BMI ≤23.9 kg/m² (Con group, n=31) and obesity/overweight group, BMI >23.9 kg/m² (OwOb group, n=14). Microbial samples were collected from the catheter tips and analyzed using RNA Ribosomal 16S.ResultsIn 45 women, the β-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) positivity rate and clinical pregnancy rate 10-12 days after embryo transfer were higher in the Con group. At the genus level, the relative abundance of Lactobacillus in the Con group was 2.2 times higher than that in the OwOb group. The Alpha diversity in the OwOb group was significantly higher than in the Con group (p=0.028). After regrouping based on β-hCG results 10-12 days post-transfer, in the Con-negative group (the group with negative β-hCG in the Con group, n=16) the relative abundances of pathogenic bacteria such as Klebsiella (p<0.001), Parasutterella (p=0.004), Dialister (p=0.01), and Gardnerella (p=0.029) were significantly higher than in the Con-positive group (the group with positive β-hCG in the Con group, n=15).ConclusionOverweight and obese women possess a distinct uterine microbiota, characterized by a lower relative abundance of Lactobacillus and an increased relative abundance of pathogenic bacteria, along with specific genera strongly associated with obesity. In individuals with higher BMI, pathogenic bacteria are more likely to impair endometrial receptivity, ultimately leading to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Therefore, modulating the uterine microbiota in overweight/obese women may improve assisted reproductive technology success rates.

## Genotype 3 is linked to worse liver disease progression in hepatitis C patients even after SVR following DAA therapy

date: 2025-02-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Background and aimsHCV genotype (GT) 3 is associated with rapid liver disease progression. However, the liver disease progression and its risk factors in patients with HCV GT 3 infection after sustained virological response (SVR) following direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) remain unclear. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the liver disease progression of patients with GT 3 after SVR.MethodsThis was a retrospective cohort study of patients with HCV infection who achieved SVR by DAAs. The clinical outcome was overall liver disease progression (OLDP), defined as newly diagnosed compensated liver cirrhosis, decompensated liver cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma. The incidence of OLDP was evaluated by Kaplan−Meier analysis. Cox regression analysis identified the risk factors for OLDP.ResultsA total of 409 patients (46.9% GT3) were followed for 43.7 (32.9, 58.7) months. The incidence of OLDP was higher in patients with GT 3 (4.63/100PY) than non-GT 3 (0.60/100PY; P < 0.001). According to Cox multivariate analysis, GT 3 was significantly associated with OLDP (HR 6.41, 95% CI 1.82 - 22.56; P=0.004). The predictors of OLDP in patients with GT 3 were HCV recurrence (HR 12.15, 95% CI 3.18 - 46.46; P < 0.001) and FIB-4 > 3.25 (HR 16.40, 95% CI 1.03 - 39.81; P = 0.046) at baseline.ConclusionHCV GT 3-infected patients remain at a higher risk of OLDP even after achieving SVR by DAAs, especially patients with advanced liver fibrosis and at high risk for reinfection or virological late relapse.

## Rapid and simple detection of Candida albicans using closed dumbbell-mediated isothermal amplification

date: 2025-02-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionCandida albicans, a human fungal pathogen, multiplies to invade body cells and causes fungal diseases in the condition of insufficient body's immune function. Early detection of C. albicans is required to guide appropriate prevention and treatment.MethodsThe purpose of this study was to establish a C. albicans assay based on newly developed closed dumbbell-mediated isothermal amplification (CDA) to achieve rapid and simple point of care diagnostic. The CDA technique was carried out by specific primers targeting at the conserved C. albicans ITS2 gene. All primers were selected and evaluated by real-time fluorescence monitoring and endpoint visual judgement indicated by hydroxy naphthol blue (HNB). Optimal primers and accelerate primers (out primers and loop primers) were designed and selected after confirmation of the fundamental CDA primers to achieve more efficient CDA reaction for C. albicans detection (CA-OL-CDA).ResultsAfter establishment of the assay, 9 non-Candida albicans strains, including 3 Candida species were tested to negative by adopting the established CA-OL-CDA assay, indicated high specificity. The limit of detection of Candida albicans DNA by CA-OL-CDA assay was 6.2×10-6 ng/μL of DNA (10 copies/μL), 10-fold more sensitive than real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR).DiscussionThe CA-OL-CDA assay exhibited advantages of high specificity, sensitivity, simpler and more efficient operation. In addition, the CA-OL-CDA method holds potential in on-site detection for C. albicans using color shift by adopting the reaction mixture based on HNB.

## Bacterial blood microbiome of Mastomys rodents: implications for disease spill-over at the animal-human interface within the Bushbuckridge-East community, South Africa

date: 2025-02-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The Bushbuckridge-East community in Mpumalanga Province, South Africa is bordered by nature reserves, including the Manyeleti Game Reserve. Murid rodents are prevalent in both Manyeleti and communal rangelands adjoining the community households. Although rodents are reservoir hosts for a broad range of viral, bacterial and parasitic pathogens, the rodent microbial diversity and transmission of zoonotic agents to humans in the community is understudied. In this study we investigated bacterial diversity in wild and commensal rodents sampled from different habitats. The 16S rRNA gene was amplified from DNA extracted from the blood of 24 wild Mastomys and one Steatomys sp. and subjected to PacBio circular consensus sequencing. As Bartonella species were dominant in the blood microbiome, gltA gene characterization was performed to delineate species. Rodents sampled from peri-urban and communal rangelands had higher proportions of Bartonella spp. [Hlalakahle (77.7%), Gottenburg (47.8%), Tlhavekisa (83.8%)] compared to those from the protected habitat (43.8%). Ehrlichia spp., Anaplasma spp., and Coxiella burnetii were detected at <1% of the sequence reads. Conventional PCR and sequencing validated the detection of Bartonella spp. with the first confirmation of Bartonella mastomydis infection in Mastomys in South Africa. Additionally, 317 mites, 90 fleas, 10 ticks and eight lice were collected from the rodents, providing evidence of possible vectors of the organisms detected. The detection of zoonotic agents in rodents in Bushbuckridge-East community, together with prior serological confirmation of Bartonella and Coxiella in non-malarial acute febrile patients from this community, highlights the possible risks that commensal rodents pose to human health.

## Gut-brain axis mediated by intestinal content microbiota was associated with Zhishi Daozhi decoction on constipation

date: 2025-02-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundConstipation is a common digestive system disorder, which is closely related to the intestinal flora. Zhishi Daozhi decoction (ZDD) is a traditional Chinese medicine prescription used to treat constipation caused by indigestion. This study is to evaluate the efficacy of ZDD in treating constipation and to elucidate the underlying mechanism.MethodsIn this study, Kunming mice were administered a high-protein diet (HFHPD) and loperamide hydrochloride injections to induce constipation. The mice then received varying doses (2.4, 4.7, and 9.4 mg/kg) of ZDD for seven days. Following the sampling process, we measured fecal microbial activity. The levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and aquaporin-3 (AQP3) were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Changes in the gut microbiota were evaluated through 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Additionally, we investigated the correlation between specific microbiota features and the levels of 5-HT, VIP, and AQP3.ResultsThe fecal surface of the mice in the model group (CMM) was rough and dry. The stool of mice in the low-dose ZDD group (CLD), medium-dose ZDD group (CMD), and high-dose ZDD group (CHD) exhibited a smoother texture, closely resembling that of the normal group (CNM). 5-HT levels in the CMM group were significantly lower than in the CNM, CLD, and CHD. VIP levels in the CMD were lower than in the other four groups, and AQP3 levels in CMM showed a decreasing trend. The fecal microbial activity of the CMM group was significantly higher than that of the other groups. Diversity analysis indicated that CMD and CHD treatments were more effective in restoring the intestinal microbiota structure. Potential pathogenic bacteria, including Clostridium, Aerococcus, Jeotgalicoccus, and Staphylococcus were enriched in CMM. In contrast, beneficial bacteria such as Faecalibacterium, Bacillaceae, and Bacillus were more prevalent in the CLD, CMD, and CHD. Correlation analysis revealed that Streptococcus and Enterococcus were positively correlated with VIP, while Succinivibrio showed a negative correlation with 5-HT.ConclusionsConstipation induced by HFHPD and loperamide hydrochloride disrupts the structure of the intestinal microbiota. ZDD appears to alleviate constipation, potentially through mechanisms linked to the brain-gut axis and its interaction with the intestinal microbiota. Among the treatment groups, the medium dose of ZDD demonstrated the most effective results.

## Attenuation of acute kidney injury in a murine model of neonatal Escherichia coli sepsis

date: 2025-02-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionSepsis is a risk factor for acute kidney injury (AKI) in neonates, for which no effective treatment exists. The phosphodiesterase inhibitor pentoxifylline (PTX) has demonstrated renal protection from ischemia and inflammation in adult rodents. We hypothesized that addition of PTX to antibiotics may attenuate immune and histological AKI in a murine neonatal sepsis model.MethodsPostnatal (PN) day 1 C57BL/6J mice were injected with E. coli K1 strain at 105 colony forming units per gram weight or saline control. After 1.5 hours, septic pups randomly received saline, gentamicin or cefotaxime, with/without PTX. 5.5h after sepsis initiation, kidneys and blood were harvested for measurements of biomarkers of inflammation and kidney injury. Renal sections from PN7 mice were used for histology and immunofluorescence. Linear mixed effect models were employed to fit the outcomes including interaction between treatment group and sex.ResultsSeptic mice demonstrated robust expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and biomarkers of tubular injury in renal tissue, which were attenuated in response to combined PTX and antibiotics (gentamicin or cefotaxime): chemokines (p<0.001), plasma (p<0.01) and tissue IL-6 (p<0.05), plasma TNF (p<0.001), NGAL (p<0.01), CXCL10 (p<0.01), osteopontin (p<0.05), and VEGF (p<0.05), with a trend for KIM-1 (tissue concentration: p=0.21, fluorescence area: p=0.12). Interactions between treatment and sex were present for several cytokines and kidney injury biomarkers. Immunofluorescence findings for the tubular injury markers (NGAL and KIM-1) were consistent with biomarker expression in tissue lysates.ConclusionNeonatal E. coli sepsis leads to increased expression of renal tissue inflammation and injury biomarkers consistent with AKI, which may be attenuated with PTX combined with antibiotic treatment.

## Modulation of virulence and metabolic profiles in Klebsiella pneumoniae under indole-mediated stress response

date: 2025-02-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Indole, a crucial bacterial signaling molecule, plays a fundamental role in regulating various physiological processes within bacteria, including growth, acid tolerance, biofilm development, motility, and other cellular functions. Its regulatory influence extends beyond indole-producing bacteria, significantly impacting the physiological activities in non-indole-producing species. In this study, we demonstrate that indole enhances the pathogenicity and viability of Klebsiella pneumoniae using the Galleria mellonella infection model and serum killing assay. Concurrently, indole has varying effects on biofilm formation in K. pneumoniae, with some strains showing enhanced biofilm formation ability. To elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms, transcriptome analysis revealed that indole exposure in K. pneumoniae led to the upregulation of genes associated with pili formation and iron acquisition systems, while simultaneously inducing oxidative stress responses. Additionally, our analysis uncovered extensive metabolic remodeling. Specifically, we observed significant upregulation of genes involved in simple carbohydrate utilization pathways, including those responsible for galactose, mannose, and maltose metabolism, as well as enhanced expression of genes associated with pyrimidine biosynthesis. These findings collectively indicate that indole enhances the intestinal colonization and pathogenicity of K. pneumoniae primarily by modulation of fimbriae expression and metabolic pathway regulation.

## Analysis of intracranial lesions in patients with HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis

date: 2025-02-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundIntracranial imaging abnormalities are commonly observed in patients suffering from HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis, both before and during the treatment period. This study aims to analyze the prevalence, origins, radiological characteristics, treatments, and prognosis of intracranial lesions in patients with HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis, thereby providing references for future clinical decision-making.MethodsThe clinical data of patients diagnosed with HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis and admitted to the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Centre between 2013 and 2019 were collected. Logistic regression analysis was subsequently conducted to identify potential risk factors associated with the development of intracranial lesions in this patient group.ResultsOf 211 patients analyzed, 64.5% (136/211) had intracranial lesions during treatment and follow-up. Initial cranial imaging showed 60% had lesions pre-treatment. Throughout treatment, 32.7% (52/159) developed new or worsened lesions. Mortality rates at 2 weeks, 8 weeks, and 2 years for those with detected lesions were 3%, 7.6%, and 13.2%, respectively. Lesions were primarily caused by Cryptococcus (70.5%) and Mycobacterium (24.3%). Lacunar infarcts, especially in the basal ganglia, were the most common type. Patients aged 50 years or older, and those presenting with altered mental status upon admission, were found to be more likely to have intracranial lesions at baseline, with adjusted odds ratios of 5.364 (95% CI: 1.468-19.591, P=0.011) and 7.970 (95% CI: 2.241-28.337, P=0.001), respectively. Patients with lesion progression showed higher levels of IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-1Ra, IL-1β, GM-CSF, Eotaxin, and Basic FGF in cerebrospinal fluid after four weeks of treatment.ConclusionIntracranial lesions in HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis patients are mostly due to Cryptococcus and Mycobacterium infections. They often appear as lacunar infarcts, predominantly in the basal ganglia, and can worsen with treatment initiation, possibly due to higher baseline cytokine levels in cerebrospinal fluid.

## Exploring the associations of gut microbiota with inflammatory and the early hematoma expansion in intracerebral hemorrhage: from change to potential therapeutic objectives

date: 2025-02-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundAlthough a great deal of research has explored the possibility of a systemic inflammatory response and dysbiosis of the gut microbiota after an intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), the relationships between gut microbiota and blood inflammatory indicators as well as their role in the hematoma expansion following an early-stage mild-to-moderate ICH (emICH) remain unknown. This study analyzes these changes and associations in order to predict and prevent hematoma expansion after emICH.MethodsThe study included 100 participants, with 70 individuals diagnosed with emICH (30 with hematoma expansion and 40 without hematoma expansion, referred to as the HE and NE groups) and 30 healthy controls matched in terms of age and gender (HC). We used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to explore the gut microbial structure and its underlying associations with blood inflammatory parameters in the HE group.ResultsOur findings showed a significant decrease in the diversity and even distribution of microorganisms in the HE group when compared to the HC and NE groups. The composition of the gut microbiota experienced notable alterations in the emICH group, especially in HE. These changes included a rise in the number of gram-negative pro-inflammatory bacteria and a decline in the level of probiotics. Furthermore, we observed strong positive connections between bacteria enriched in the HE group and levels of systemic inflammation. Several microbial biomarkers (e.g. Escherichia_Shigella, Enterobacter, and Porphyromonas) were revealed in disparateiating HE from HC and NE. Analysis of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) exposed disturbances in essential physiological pathways, especially those related to inflammation (such as the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway), in the HE group.ConclusionsOur exploration indicated that individuals with emICH, especially those with HE, demonstrate notably different host-microbe interactions when compared to healthy individuals. We deduced that emICH could rapidly trigger the dysbiosis of intestinal flora, and the disturbed microbiota could, in turn, exacerbate inflammatory response and increase the risk of hematoma expansion. Our comprehensive research revealed the potential of intestinal flora as a potent diagnostic tool, emphasizing its significance as a preventive target for HE.

## Nineteen years retrospective analysis of epidemiology, antifungal resistance and a nomogram model for 30-day mortality in nosocomial candidemia patients

date: 2025-02-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundThe incidence of nosocomial candidemia has increased in recently years, however, the epidemiological data remain insufficient in China.MethodsA total of 234 candidemia patients were included from Xiamen University Zhong Shan hospital between January 2006 and October 2024. Incidence, species proportion, distribution, antifungal drug resistance of candidemia was analyzed. A nomogram model for 30-day morbidity of candidemia was determined using the least absolute shrinkage and logistic regression analysis.ResultsThe incidence of candidemia increased in recent years (2020: 0.025%, 2021: 0.029%, 2023:0.022%). The dominant species of candidemia were Candida albicans (n=99,42.31%), Candida parapsilosis (n=47,20.09%), Candida tropicalis (n=43,18.38%), Candida glabrata (n=31,13.25%). Departments with a higher detection of candidemia included intensive care unit (n=55), emergency department (n=24) and hepatobiliary surgery (n=22). Candida tropicalis performed the highest resistance to azole (fluconazole: 55.81%, voriconazole:55.00% and itraconazole:58.14%). The resistance of Candida albicans to fluconazole, voriconazole and itraconazole were 32.32%, 23.53% and 31.31%. The mortality rate of 30-day discharge for candidemia reached 52.99%. 205 cases of candidemia patients from January 2006 to December 2023 were included as the training set, while 29 cases of candidiasis patients from January to October 2004 were included as the validation set. Five independent factors included Candida albicans, decreased albumin, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, solid tumor and septic shock were adopted in a nomogram for 30-days mortality of candidemia. In the training set, the area under curve was 0.866 (95%CI: 0.817-0.916), the optimal cutoff value was 0.617, the sensitivity was 80% and the specificity was 80.4%. In the validation set, the area under curve was 0.808 (95%CI:0.737-0.970), the optimal cutoff value was 0.543. The sensitivity was 72.7% and the specificity was 83.3%.ConclusionThe incidence of nosocomial candidemia has risen in recent years. Candida albicans remains the primary species, with the highest incidence is intensive care unit. Candida tropicalis exhibits the highest resistance rate to azole drugs. A nomogram predicting 30-day mortality discharge for candidemia patients has been constructed, and the independent risk factors including Candida albicans, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, septic shock, solid tumors, and decreased albumin.
