## If you want to keep using KDE and GNOME, you’re going to have to move to Wayland

date: 2025-06-23, from: OS News

With the transition from X11 to Wayland in full swing, from popular distributions removing X11 sessions altogether and the two major desktop environments planning for the removal of X11 support as well, there&#8217;s a ton of questions people are dealing with. Both the KDE and GNOME project published detailed blog posts about the matter. First, KDE&#8217;s Nathan Graham makes it very clear that KDE Plasma&#8217;s X11 sessions continues to be maintained. This means KDE Plasma will continue to work on X11, major bugs in the session (e.g. can&#8217;t log in) will be fixed, and really bad regressions in the session may eventually be fixed. That being said, minor bugs will probably not be fixed unless someone pays for it, and new features in the X11 session will not happen at all, unless someone pays for it. KDE currently has no time frame for when X11 support will be dropped from KDE Plasma, and Graham doesn&#8217;t expect it to happen within the next two years. The KDE project maintains a list of known significant issues with KDE Plasma on Wayland, and KDE plans on addressing everything on that list before removing X11 support. Graham notes that in the end, dropping X11 support from KDE Plasma is mostly up to distributions, as it wouldn&#8217;t make any sense to drop it if distributions aren&#8217;t on board. At the moment, about 70-80% of KDE Plasma users are using Wayland, he notes. On the GNOME side of things, Jordan Petridis also detailed GNOME&#8217;s position on Wayland and X11. GNOME will be disabling the X11 session in GNOME 49, with a full removal of the X11 code in GNOME 50. This won&#8217;t break any X11 applications (on either GNOME or KDE), since even if they don&#8217;t have a Wayland backend, they&#8217;ll run just fine using XWayland, which is an X server running on top of Wayland. XWayland isn&#8217;t going anywhere any time soon. According to Petridis, the Wayland session is as functional as the X11 session, and &#8220;in plenty of cases a lot more capable and efficient&#8221;. He further adds that &#8220;there’s some niche workflows that are only possible on X11, but there isn’t any functionality regression&#8221;. Basically, if you&#8217;re using your spacebar as a heater, you might run into problems. As for accessibility, Wayland is actually doing pretty great. There has been a lot of concerned trolling and misinformation specifically around this topic sadly from people that don’t care about it and have been abusing the discourse as a straw man argument. Drowning all the people that rely on it and need to be heard. Thankfully Aaron of fireborn fame wrote recently a blogpost talking about all this in detail and clearing up misconceptions. ↫ Jordan Petridis Finally, Petridis summarises why the Linux desktop world is moving to Wayland: No, the Xorg Server is still very much maintained, however its development is halted. It still receives occasional bugfixes and there are timely security releases when needed. The common sentiment, shared among Xorg, Graphics, Kernel, Platform and Application developers is that any future development is a dead-end and shortcomings can’t be addressed without breaking X11. That’s why the majority of Xorg developers moved on to make a new, separate, thing: Wayland. ↫ Jordan Petridis This pill is so hard to swallow for some people that they go full bananas and start seeing red hats and Illuminati symbols everywhere, losing their minds and spiraling deep into ludicrous conspiracy theories. The truth of the matter is, however, blatantly banal: the people developing X.org realised long ago that meaningfully improving it would irrevocably break it, and as such they developed something new so they wouldn&#8217;t have to break X11. That&#8217;s it. X.org will continue to exist and live on in its maintained state, and desktops relying on it will continue to function. If you want to keep using GNOME and KDE, though, you&#8217;ll have to drop X11, because the kinds of features and improvements these desktops want to deliver are not possible without breaking X11. Would you want an X11 that&#8217;s broken for everyone, or an X11 that keeps working as-is, while those that want to move on do so somewhere else?

## Asterinas: a new Linux-compatible kernel project

Asterinas is a new Linux-ABI-compatible kernel project written in Rust, based on what the authors call a &#8220;framekernel architecture&#8221;. The project overlaps somewhat with the goals of the Rust for Linux project, but approaches the problem space from a different direction by trying to get the best from both monolithic and microkernel designs. ↫ Ronja Koistinen at LWN.net Ronja Koistinen has done an outstanding job diving into this new operating system kernel and approach to kernel architecture, including its intended focus and goals.

## The X Window System didn’t immediately have X terminals

date: 2025-06-23, from: OS News

For a while, X terminals were a reasonably popular way to give people comparatively inexpensive X desktops. These X terminals relied on X&#8217;s network transparency so that only the X server had to run on the X terminal itself, with all of your terminal windows and other programs running on a server somewhere and just displaying on the X terminal. For a long time, using a big server and a lab full of X terminals was significantly cheaper than setting up a lab full of actual workstations (until inexpensive and capable PCs showed up). Given that X started with network transparency and X terminals are so obvious, you might be surprised to find out that X didn&#8217;t start with them. ↫ Chris Siebenmann I did indeed assume X terminals were part of the ecosystem from day one, but it makes sense that it took a while, and that they didn&#8217;t enter the scene until X had established itself as the standard windowing system in the UNIX world. I&#8217;ve been trying to get my hands on specifically the last HP X terminal, but they&#8217;re hard to find and often very expensive. I&#8217;d love to get a taste of a proper networked X environment on real UNIX, in the way people actually used to use it professionally. As a sidenote, Siebenmann is doing such an excellent job with these stories about UNIX, X11, and related matters. He&#8217;s like the Raymond Chen of the UNIX world.

## postmarketOS v25.06 released with systemd

date: 2025-06-23, from: OS News

This is it, the one that adds systemd to postmarketOS! We have talked about the decision at length on this blog, make sure to read the initial announcement if this is the first time you are hearing about this. ↫ postmarketOS v25.06 release announcement While adding systemd to postmarketOS is certainly the tentpole feature of this release, it also updates the various user interfaces &#8211; GNOME&#8217;s and KDE&#8217;s mobile shells and applications &#8211; and moves to Alpine Linux 3.22 as its base. The mobile user interfaces for both Firefox and Thunderbird have been updated as well, there&#8217;s a ton of improvements and additions for individual devices, and a lot more. PostmarketOS, in case you are unaware, is a Linux distribution optimised for smartphones, focused on running mobile shells and applications. It&#8217;s not ready for prime-time quite yet, and device support will probably be the biggest hurdle for anyone wanting to try it out.

## YouTube’s new anti-adblock measures

date: 2025-06-22, from: OS News

Over the past few months, YouTube has been trying another round of anti-adblock measures. Currently the anti-adblock stuff is being A/B tested, and one of my accounts is in the experimental group. I wrote a filter that partially avoids one of the anti-adblock measures, fake buffering, on uBlock Origin (and Brave browser, since it uses the same filter rules). (It’s already in the default filter lists, you don’t need to manually add the filter.) One thing that people have ran into is “fake buffering”, where videos will take a while to load due to a lot of buffering, but only at the very start of the video (there’s no mid-video fake buffering). As I’ll explain, the fake buffering is 80% of the length of the ads you would’ve seen, so even with fake buffering you’re still saving time using an adblocker. ↫ iter.ca The battle between YouTube on one side, and users wanting a non-shitty experience without paying for YouTube Premium on the other, is unlikely to end any time soon. Your computer, your rules, so I&#8217;m on the side of the people wanting to block ads on YouTube &#8211; the same applies to OSNews if you don&#8217;t want to pay for our ad-free version &#8211; but I&#8217;m still intrigued to find out just how far Google is willing to go. I sometimes see YouTube with ads at other people&#8217;s homes. It&#8217;s a nightmare.
