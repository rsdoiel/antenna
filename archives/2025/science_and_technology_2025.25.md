## The one thing SME IT can do that the big guys can’t: Change the world

<h4>Not quite the answer to life, the universe and everything, but not far off</h4> <p><strong>Opinion</strong>  The smaller the org, the better the jobs. Not universally true, but a good rule of thumb. Small organizations have fewer layers of management, and each individual has much more influence. One voice in 50 is 100 times louder than one in 5,000. You get to say what you want to do and get to do it. Happiness. …</p>

## YouTube’s new anti-adblock measures

date: 2025-06-22, from: OS News

Over the past few months, YouTube has been trying another round of anti-adblock measures. Currently the anti-adblock stuff is being A/B tested, and one of my accounts is in the experimental group. I wrote a filter that partially avoids one of the anti-adblock measures, fake buffering, on uBlock Origin (and Brave browser, since it uses the same filter rules). (It’s already in the default filter lists, you don’t need to manually add the filter.) One thing that people have ran into is “fake buffering”, where videos will take a while to load due to a lot of buffering, but only at the very start of the video (there’s no mid-video fake buffering). As I’ll explain, the fake buffering is 80% of the length of the ads you would’ve seen, so even with fake buffering you’re still saving time using an adblocker. ↫ iter.ca The battle between YouTube on one side, and users wanting a non-shitty experience without paying for YouTube Premium on the other, is unlikely to end any time soon. Your computer, your rules, so I&#8217;m on the side of the people wanting to block ads on YouTube &#8211; the same applies to OSNews if you don&#8217;t want to pay for our ad-free version &#8211; but I&#8217;m still intrigued to find out just how far Google is willing to go. I sometimes see YouTube with ads at other people&#8217;s homes. It&#8217;s a nightmare.
