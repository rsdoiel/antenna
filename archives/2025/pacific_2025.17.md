## The Rise of Higher Education in the Northern Mariana Islands

date: 2025-04-28, updated: 2025-04-28, from: Marianas Variety

In Saipan, the groundwork for establishing higher education began with the contributions of dedicated individuals and organizations. Before the Peace Corps' involvement, the Micronesian school system was staffed by a total of 876 teachers, including 172 Americans and 704 Micronesians. Despite these numbers, the system for training Micronesian teachers produced only a small percentage of fully qualified educators according to U.S. standards. This inadequacy had a detrimental effect on the use of English as the language of instruction and the teaching of English as a second language in schools.

## UOG variety trial finds two banana types ideal for commercial production in Guam

MANGILAO (UOG) — A variety trial conducted over the past year by University of Guam Cooperative Extension &amp; Outreach tested five varieties of banana — “Fiji,” “Blue Java,” “Macao,” “Manila,” and “Saba” — from planting to harvest to see which have ideal characteristics for being grown commercially in Guam. The study found that “Fiji” and “Saba” would be ideal for expanded production in Guam due to their highly marketable qualities, favorable yields, and ability to be sustainably produced in Guam’s conditions without the use of pesticides.

## Introducing College Lane

date: 2025-04-27, updated: 2025-04-27, from: Marianas Variety

The Department of Public Works and Northern Marianas College on Friday, April 25, held a small ribbon-cutting ceremony for the road project that lines the west side of the NMC campus in Saipan. The project relocates the thoroughfare that was once located on NMC property to the designated right of way. For many years, the public road came through the College, so the new road alleviates traffic cutting through the college to help ensure student safety on campus. The project includes CUC’s upgrade of the sewer pipeline in this area. The project also sets the stage for NMC’s new masterplan which includes multiple new buildings, a campus quad, and other facilities. Formerly known as Finasisu Lane, College Lane is a collaboration among Northern Marianas College, the Saipan and Northern Islands Legislative Delegation, Commonwealth Economic Development Authority, Department of Public Works, Commonwealth Utilities Corp. and Yantze Corp.
