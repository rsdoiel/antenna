Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0745 AM CDT Sun Mar 30 2025

Valid 301300Z - 311200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS MUCH OF
THE LOWER/MID MISSISSIPPI VALLEY INTO THE OHIO VALLEY AND SOUTHERN
GREAT LAKES...

...SUMMARY...
Numerous severe thunderstorms are expected today and tonight across
a broad portion of the Southeast and lower/mid Mississippi Valley
into the Ohio Valley and southern Great Lakes. Multiple swaths of
widespread damaging winds appear likely. Large to very large hail
and several tornadoes will also occur with supercells. A few of
these tornadoes could be strong.

...Synopsis...
A broad area of severe potential remains apparent today and tonight,
with all severe hazards likely. The main mid-level shortwave trough
of interest will move quickly northeastward from the Ozarks/mid MO
Valley to the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes today, as larger-scale
upper troughing gradually becomes more established over the MS
Valley through the period. At the surface, the primary surface low
over eastern IA this morning is expected to develop northeastward
towards northern Lower MI by this evening, and eventually into
southern Ontario/Quebec late tonight. An attendant cold front will
sweep east-southeastward over much of the Midwest/OH Valley and
mid/lower MS Valley through the period, while a warm front lifts
northward in tandem with the surface low over portions of the Great
Lakes. A dryline will mix eastward this afternoon across parts of
north-central to south-central TX.

...Midwest/Ohio Valley to the Great Lakes...
Mainly elevated thunderstorms are ongoing this morning across parts
of northeast MO in associated with the northeastward-advancing
shortwave trough. This activity should generally remain sub-severe,
although isolated strong/gusty winds could occur with modest daytime
heating this morning. Otherwise, a corridor of weak to moderate
instability is expected to develop ahead of the cold front by early
afternoon. Robust convection appears likely to initiate by 18-19Z,
and it will spread quickly northeastward across much of the OH
Valley and southern Great Lakes regions this afternoon and evening.
A 50-70 kt southwesterly mid-level jet attendant to the shortwave
trough will provide ample deep-layer shear for organized convection.

Current expectations are for an initially more discrete mode, with
supercells posing a threat for large to very large hail (around
1.5-2.5 inch diameter) given the presence of steep mid-level lapse
rates and favorable deep-layer shear. A fairly quick transition
(within a few hours of initiation) to a more linear/cluster mode is
anticipated as the cold front surges eastward. Multiple swaths of
numerous to potentially widespread severe/damaging winds appear
likely as one or more clusters moves quickly east-northeastward over
the OH Valley and southern Lower MI. With a 35-45 kt
south-southwesterly low-level jet also present, strong low-level
shear will likely support a threat for tornadoes, both with initial
supercells and any lines/clusters that eventually form. Given the
strength of the low-level flow, some of the tornadoes could be
strong, especially with sustained supercells in the lower OH Valley
vicinity. The threat for damaging winds and tornadoes should
continue this evening into the overnight hours, until convection
outpaces the low-level moisture return and eventually weakens over
the upper OH Valley and central Appalachians.

...Central/East Texas into the Lower/Mid Mississippi
Valley/Mid-South and Southeast...
A band of mostly elevated convection developed earlier this morning
over portions of north-central/east TX, likely in association with
large-scale ascent preceding a westerly mid/upper-level jet nosing
into central TX. While the overall environment remains quite
favorable for organized severe convection, messy convective modes
have tended to keep the severe hail threat isolated so far. Still,
some risk for hail will continue through the morning. Strong
destabilization is anticipated today ahead of this convection and a
separate area of elevated thunderstorms over southern MO. Mid to
upper 60s surface dewpoints will continue to stream northward across
TX ahead of the dryline, and the lower/mid MS Valley and Southeast
ahead of the cold front. This rich low-level moisture, combined with
very steep (8-9 C/km) mid-level lapse rates and daytime heating, are
expected to foster around 2000-3000 MLCAPE by early to mid
afternoon.

Rapid and intense thunderstorm initiation will likely occur by
18-21Z from parts of north-central/east TX to the Mid-South/mid MS
Valley. Supercells are expected initially, with 40-50+ kt of
deep-layer shear supporting robust updraft organization and
rotation. A very favorable setup remains apparent for large to very
large hail, as strong instability and deep-layer shear combine with
steep mid-level lapse rates and low freezing levels. Some of this
very large hail could reach up to 2-3 inches in diameter. With the
primary shortwave trough ejecting to the northeast, low-level winds
are forecast to remain fairly subdued through the afternoon and
early evening, before gradually strengthening again tonight through
early Monday morning. A risk for several tornadoes should be focused
over parts of the Mid-South, a few of which could be strong given a
favorable supercell mode. Similar to farther north in the OH Valley,
a transition to more linear/cluster mode is expected this evening
and overnight as the cold front continues advancing southeastward. A
risk for line-embedded tornadoes should continue, and an increase in
the severe/damaging wind threat is likely through the end of the
period. Based on latest guidance trends, and to overlap with the Day
2 Convective Outlook, adjustments have been made to the
southern/eastern extent of the risk areas across the lower MS Valley
and Southeast.

...Florida Peninsula...
A weak mid-level perturbation will move eastward over FL today.
Modestly enhanced winds aloft, and a veering profile with height
through mid levels, should support sufficient deep-layer shear for
some thunderstorm organization. Any convection that develops in
tandem with daytime heating this afternoon and early evening could
pose an isolated threat for severe hail and damaging winds. Some
adjustments have been made to the Marginal Risk across the FL
Peninsula based on latest guidance trends.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook

0359 AM CDT Sun Mar 30 2025

Valid 021200Z - 071200Z

...SEVERE WEATHER OUTBREAK POSSIBLE ON D4/WED...

...DISCUSSION...
Medium-range models appear to be in good agreement with overall
evolution of the synoptic-scale pattern into the Day 7 (Saturday
April 5) time period, when divergence in solutions increases.

Earlier in the period however, model consistency lends fairly high
confidence that a widespread/potentially substantial outbreak of
severe weather will evolve Wednesday/Day 4, from Lower Michigan and
the Ohio Valley, southwestward across the Middle and Lower
Mississippi Valleys, and into eastern portions of Texas and
Oklahoma.  Convection will likely be ongoing or developing early in
the day, over western portions of the risk area -- from Wisconsin
southwestward to Oklahoma/North Texas.  As an upper low shifts
northeastward across the northern Plains toward the upper
Mississippi Valley through the day, and the cold front crosses
Iowa/Missouri/eastern Oklahoma, steep lapse rates atop a
moist/diurnally heating warm sector will support widespread
convective development.  

With ascent along the front somewhat modest as stronger large-scale
ascent focuses northward into the western Upper Great Lakes and into
Ontario, storm mode may tend toward isolated storms, as opposed to
more linear development.  This, combined with flow that is forecast
to weakly veer but dramatically strengthen with height, suggests a
primarily supercell storm mode.  In additional to very large hail
(particularly with southward extent), widespread damaging winds and
several tornadoes are expected, some possibly significant.  Risk is
expected to continue well into the evening and likely overnight,
shifting slowly eastward across the Midwest and mid/lower
Mississippi Valley through the end of the period.

Day 5/Thursday, trailing portions of the cold front should become
aligned east-northeast to west-southwest across the Ohio and mid
Mississippi Valleys and into the southern Plains, as the upper
system shifts quickly across eastern Canada.  While weak short-wave
ridging will evolve atop the surface frontal zone in the wake of the
departing system, daytime heating of a very moist boundary layer
along and south of the front combined with strong flow aloft will
support reinvigorated convection through the afternoon and evening
hours, along with attendant severe-weather risk.

Day 6/Friday, the surface front should remain quasi-stationary, but
short-wave ridging should increase as a cut-off low evolves across
the West.  As such, much of the Day 6 convection may occur to the
cool side of the surface front, in the zone of warm
advection/isentropic ascent.  While some severe risk will likely
evolve, mainly in the form of hail, uncertainty overall (given the
ridging aloft) precludes inclusion of a Day 6 risk area.  

By the weekend, deviation in model solutions increases, due to
uncertain evolution of the low/trough over the West.  As such, no
risk areas will be included.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0215 AM CDT Tue Mar 25 2025

Valid 261200Z - 271200Z

...Synopsis...
Large-scale ridging will continue to amplify over the western US as
a subtle southern stream shortwave trough slides underneath the
ridge. Weak ascent will overspread parts of the Southwest as modest
moisture returns to the west. This may support isolated dry
thunderstorms atop dry fuels in parts of the Southwest.

...Parts of NM...
As the weak upper-level trough moves over the Southwest, modest
ascent and easterly upslope flow is expected to promote isolated to
widely scattered showers and thunderstorms from central NM to
western TX. At the western extent of the moist plume, PWAT values
less than 0.75 inches will overlap with sufficiently steep low and
mid-level lapse rates to support high-based storms with poor
precipitation efficiency. Dry lightning strikes appear likely over
very receptive fuels given the high-based nature of any convection
that forms. An Isolated Dry Thunder area has been added across
western and central NM where best overlap of thunderstorm potential
and dry fuels should exist for several hours Wed.

...Appalachians...
Another day of dry conditions is expected across the southern
Appalachians Wed. High pressure will gradually shift eastward with
downslope flow likely across parts of western VA and the Carolinas.
While surface winds may not be overly strong (generally less than 15
mph), isolated gusts near 20 mph are possible. In addition,
afternoon RH should fall below 25%. Model guidance shows
considerable spread regarding the spatial and temporal coverage of
any elevated fire weather conditions that may develop. A few hours
of locally elevated fire-weather conditions are possible, but
uncertain.

Mesoscale Discussion 0260
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0756 AM CDT Mon Mar 24 2025

Areas affected...southeastern Louisiana

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 64...

Valid 241256Z - 241430Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 64
continues.

SUMMARY...A damaging wind threat will continue through the morning
across southeast Louisiana.

DISCUSSION...A line of storms continues to move east across
southeast Louisiana this morning with a recent 68 knot wind gust at
KBTR at 1228 UTC near the apex of this bow. The 12Z LIX RAOB showed
around 1250 J/kg MLCAPE with a weak near-surface stable layer and 48
knots of 0-6 km shear. Extensive cloudcover should limit much
heating this morning, but continued low-level moistening ahead of
the squall line should maintain some surface based instability and a
damaging wind threat through the morning. The northern extent of
this severe weather threat is likely delineated by a southward
moving line of storms/outflow boundary (currently near the MS/LA
border). An additional watch is not currently anticipated east of
watch 64 as any residual surface based instability will likely be
limited to the immediate coastline by later this morning.
