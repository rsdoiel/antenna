Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0740 AM CDT Fri Mar 28 2025

Valid 281300Z - 291200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
COASTAL TEXAS INTO LOUISIANA...AND PORTIONS OF NEBRASKA INTO THE
UPPER MIDWEST...

...SUMMARY...
A low probability tornado/wind threat is forecast through this
evening across parts of coastal Texas into Louisiana. Isolated
severe hail and wind is also possible this evening/tonight from
Nebraska into portions of the Upper Midwest.

...Coastal Texas into Louisiana...
A convective cluster advanced eastward and offshore from deep south
TX earlier this morning. In the wake of this activity, a remnant MCV
should continue northeastward along/near the TX Coast today. With
considerable convective overturning having already occurred, it
remains unclear how much destabilization will occur along/behind the
MCV across deep south TX through the afternoon. A better chance for
modest surface-based instability to develop should exist across
parts of the upper TX Coast into LA this afternoon. With modestly
enhanced low-level winds veering with height across this area in
association with the MCV, there may be sufficient 0-1 km SRH to
support a couple of tornadoes with any cells or clusters that can
develop this afternoon. An isolated damaging wind threat should also
exist with this activity as it spreads into parts of LA early this
evening, before eventually weakening with the loss of daytime
heating. Poor mid-level lapse rates should limit the overall
thermodynamic environment, and current expectations are for the
severe threat to remain fairly isolated/marginal.

...Nebraska into the Upper Midwest...
Upper ridging will be gradually suppressed today as a low-amplitude
shortwave trough moves eastward across the northern/central Plains
and Upper Midwest through the period. Modest low-level moisture is
forecast to continue streaming northward along/south of a sharpening
warm front across MN/WI, and east of a cold front that will develop
southward across parts of the northern/central Plains by this
evening. Isolated to scattered thunderstorms may develop by mid to
late evening along/near both fronts as low-level warm advection
strengthens, from central NE northeastward into southern MN and
central WI. Steep mid-level lapse rates will aid in the development
of moderate MUCAPE, while deep-layer shear appears marginally
supportive of organized convection. Any sustained thunderstorms
could produce isolated severe hail and damaging winds. This activity
will likely be elevated with eastward extent into the Upper Midwest
through the evening and overnight, with a continued hail threat.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook CORR 1
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK

Valid 311200Z - 051200Z

CORRECTED GRAPHIC

...DISCUSSION...
Widespread storms and at least some attendant severe risk will be
ongoing at the start of the Day 4 period (Monday March 31) -- with
the band of convection likely extending along the west slopes of the
Appalachians initially.  Diurnal destabilization along and east of
the mountains remains a question, particularly with northward extent
into the Northeast, and thus the northern periphery of the risk area
remains in question -- in what will likely be a very low CAPE/high
shear environment -- suggestive of damaging gusts being the primary
concern over northern portions of the area.  

Farther south, greater CAPE is expected, particularly from the
Carolinas into the central Gulf Coast states.  Here, an all-hazards
risk is forecast to continue from the Day 3 period into Day 4. 
Storms/severe risk will shift eastward with time, crossing the East
Coast states through the afternoon and evening, before clearing the
coast overnight.

Day 5/Tuesday looks to be a relative down day in terms of severe
potential, with moisture beginning to return northward into the
central U.S. ahead of the next system. 

Day 6/Wednesday, moisture will continue returning northward across
the central U.S., though substantial differences in timing/evolution
of the upper system exists between the (slower) ECMWF and (faster)
GFS.  However, the GEFS ensemble mean is slower than the operational
GFS, not quite as slow as but more in line with the ECMWF -- and the
Euro ensemble mean.  Given this, confidence is high enough to
proceed with introduction of a broad -- though areally uncertain --
15% area.  This system would appear to have the potential to produce
another fairly widespread/all-hazards severe event, but will likely
require a good bit of adjustment over the next few days.

Beyond Day 6, confidence in evolution of the large-scale features
diminishes further, due to the aforementioned differences between
operations runs of the global models.  As such, no areas will be
delineated beyond Day 6.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0215 AM CDT Tue Mar 25 2025

Valid 261200Z - 271200Z

...Synopsis...
Large-scale ridging will continue to amplify over the western US as
a subtle southern stream shortwave trough slides underneath the
ridge. Weak ascent will overspread parts of the Southwest as modest
moisture returns to the west. This may support isolated dry
thunderstorms atop dry fuels in parts of the Southwest.

...Parts of NM...
As the weak upper-level trough moves over the Southwest, modest
ascent and easterly upslope flow is expected to promote isolated to
widely scattered showers and thunderstorms from central NM to
western TX. At the western extent of the moist plume, PWAT values
less than 0.75 inches will overlap with sufficiently steep low and
mid-level lapse rates to support high-based storms with poor
precipitation efficiency. Dry lightning strikes appear likely over
very receptive fuels given the high-based nature of any convection
that forms. An Isolated Dry Thunder area has been added across
western and central NM where best overlap of thunderstorm potential
and dry fuels should exist for several hours Wed.

...Appalachians...
Another day of dry conditions is expected across the southern
Appalachians Wed. High pressure will gradually shift eastward with
downslope flow likely across parts of western VA and the Carolinas.
While surface winds may not be overly strong (generally less than 15
mph), isolated gusts near 20 mph are possible. In addition,
afternoon RH should fall below 25%. Model guidance shows
considerable spread regarding the spatial and temporal coverage of
any elevated fire weather conditions that may develop. A few hours
of locally elevated fire-weather conditions are possible, but
uncertain.

Mesoscale Discussion 0260
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0756 AM CDT Mon Mar 24 2025

Areas affected...southeastern Louisiana

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 64...

Valid 241256Z - 241430Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 64
continues.

SUMMARY...A damaging wind threat will continue through the morning
across southeast Louisiana.

DISCUSSION...A line of storms continues to move east across
southeast Louisiana this morning with a recent 68 knot wind gust at
KBTR at 1228 UTC near the apex of this bow. The 12Z LIX RAOB showed
around 1250 J/kg MLCAPE with a weak near-surface stable layer and 48
knots of 0-6 km shear. Extensive cloudcover should limit much
heating this morning, but continued low-level moistening ahead of
the squall line should maintain some surface based instability and a
damaging wind threat through the morning. The northern extent of
this severe weather threat is likely delineated by a southward
moving line of storms/outflow boundary (currently near the MS/LA
border). An additional watch is not currently anticipated east of
watch 64 as any residual surface based instability will likely be
limited to the immediate coastline by later this morning.
