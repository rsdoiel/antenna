Electric bicycle incentive programs
<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/08/29/gone-in-60-seconds-denvers-latest-e-bike-vouchers-scooped-up-in-a-minute/">have
grown considerably </a>over the last few years, and Washington State is
one of the most recent to lay the groundwork for yet another program
designed to reduce the cost of this alternative transportation for
lower-income commuters. But the state is also going about it in a unique
way, by using funding raised from its emissions taxes.
