Tesla shareholders have voted for the questions they want to ask Elon
Musk and Tesla’s management at the upcoming earning results this week.

questions.

Last week’s inauguration of President Trump stole the headlines, but it
wasn’t the only big election news — a supermajority of workers at
BlueOval SK voted to file a petition last week with the National Labor
Relations Board to unite with the UAW.

Political policies come and go, but total cost of ownership will always
trump politics when it comes to managing a commercial fleet. As if to
illustrate that point, Canada’s first-ever class 4 medium duty battery
electric dump truck was deployed this week!

With more models hitting the market and massive incentives,
<a href="https://electrek.co/guides/electric-vehicles/">electric
vehicles</a> are just as affordable, if not more, than gas-powered cars.
However, with Trump’s transition team reportedly planning to end the EV
tax credit, the savings may soon disappear. Check out the EVs you can
still lease for under $300 a month in January below.

So many of the fun electric go-karts I’ve found while window-shopping on
Alibaba have been of the
<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/04/06/this-dual-steering-wheel-electric-go-kart-looks-like-a-fun-little-divorce-on-wheels/">child-sized
variety</a>. To be fair, I’m not opposed to folding my body in ways it
shouldn’t in service of a good time, but it’d be nice to get the same
experience while maintaining full blood flow to the extremities.
</p>
<p>
That’s where today’s find comes in, as a full-size electric go-kart that
adults can enjoy, too! It’s both awesome and weird, but perhaps for
once, this week’s honoree of the
<a href="http://electrek.co/guides/alibaba">Awesomely Weird Alibaba
Electric Vehicle of the Week</a> is more of the former and less of the
latter!
