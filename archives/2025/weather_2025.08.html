Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0358 AM CST Fri Feb 28 2025

Valid 031200Z - 081200Z

...DISCUSSION...
Medium-range guidance suggests that an initially zonal, intense
mid/upper jet across the western into central mid-latitude Pacific
may undergo considerable amplification into and through this period.
It remains a bit unclear how emerging waves will impact the
downstream pattern by the middle to latter portion of next week. 

However, it still appears that one significant preceding short wave
trough, migrating inland of the Pacific coast by early Monday, will
progress into and across the southern Rockies, before accelerating
east-northeastward through mid week.  And guidance remains
suggestive that this will be accompanied by strong surface
cyclogenesis, perhaps most notably across portions of the east
central Great Plains toward the lower Great Lakes region late
Tuesday through Tuesday night.  This may include an evolving warm
sector with intensifying low-level and deep-layer shear (in the
presence of southerly to southwesterly flow strengthening to 50-100
kt in the 850 to 500 mb layer), coincident with an influx of
moistening and destabilizing boundary-layer air off the northwestern
Gulf.  

Spread typical at this extended time frame (day 5) lingers among the
various model output concerning the sub-synoptic, and even synoptic,
details across the southeastern Great Plains through Ohio Valley and
Southeast, which may considerably impact the severe weather risk
area and potential.  However, the medium-range guidance depicts an
environment at least conditionally supportive of an organized severe
weather event, including potential for a few strong tornadoes and
damaging straight line winds.

It is possible, but perhaps a bit more uncertain, that this could
continue across parts of the southern and middle Atlantic Seaboard
on Wednesday.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0618 PM CST Sun Feb 23 2025

Valid 240100Z - 241200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated thunderstorms remain possible this evening mainly over
parts of eastern Louisiana and across Mississippi.

...Synopsis and Discussion...
Scattered thunderstorms continue to be most prevalent over the
northern and central Gulf, near the offshore surface low. A few
lightning flashes were noted over parts of northern LA into MS, but
in general, this activity should continue to wane as winds veer with
the passing lead wave aloft.

Elsewhere, a few flashes with weak convection were noted earlier
over southwest OR beneath cool temperatures aloft and in association
with a now departing shortwave trough. A very low chance of thunder
may linger in this area within the residual midlevel moist plume
this evening.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0229 PM CST Sun Feb 23 2025

Valid 251200Z - 031200Z

Fire weather potential will remain limited across the country
through much of the upcoming work week, though some fire concerns
may emerge across the southern High Plains beginning D6/Friday and
into the following weekend. A broad northwesterly flow regime aloft
is expected to persist for much of the upcoming week amid
persistent, and unseasonably strong, ridging across the western
CONUS. This regime will continue to promote dry conditions from the
southern Great Basin into the Four Corners and southern/central
Plains. Additionally, a return to unseasonably warm temperatures is
anticipated, which will support gradual fuel drying and an expansion
of elevated (80+ percentile) ERC values out of far West Texas and
into the southern Plains/Southwest. The passage of weak upper
disturbances across the northern latitudes will promote widespread,
but light, rain/snow chances and an influx of cooler continental air
for northern portions of the country, but could augment regional
pressure gradient winds across the southern High Plains where fuels
should be most receptive. This potential appears most prominent
around D6/Friday when most solutions suggest southwest winds could
approach critical thresholds within a dry downslope flow regime,
though deterministic/ensemble spread remains high at this range. A
transition to a more progressive upper-air regime is anticipated
heading into early March, which could signal an increase in fire
weather potential for parts of the Southwest and Plains as more
robust surface cyclones become probable across the southern U.S.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0123 PM CST Sun Feb 23 2025

Valid 251200Z - 261200Z

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms are not expected across the CONUS on Tuesday.

...Synopsis...
After an upper-level trough moves of the eastern Florida coast,
generally quasi-zonal flow will prevail across the CONUS. Two
shortwaves, one in central/northern Rockies and the other in
Mid-Atlantic, will have little in terms of moisture to work with.
Thunderstorm potential with these features will be quite low. Very
isolated thunderstorm activity could linger into early Tuesday
morning in Florida, but the departing shortwave/surface low will not
synoptically favor coverage at or above 10%.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0117 PM CST Sun Feb 23 2025

Valid 232000Z - 241200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms should continue across portions of Louisiana and
immediate surrounding areas today. Additional isolated thunderstorms
may still occur in portions of Oregon/Washington. No severe weather
is expected.

...20Z Update...
The primary change made to the 20Z Day 1 Convective Outlook was to
trim western portions of the general thunder delineation over
Coastal TX. Low-level moisture advection and associated buoyancy is
translating east along the Gulf Coast in tandem with a mid-level
trough. As such, additional lightning flashes are most likely across
portions of LA into central/southern MS and adjacent waters. A few
lightning flashes still remain possible across portions of the
Pacific Northwest with the approach of a mid-level trough.

..Squitieri.. 02/23/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1012 AM CST Sun Feb 23 2025/

...TX/LA...
A prominent shortwave trough is tracking eastward across TX today,
providing lift and destabilization to parts of southeast TX and LA. 
Scattered thunderstorms have been occurring in this region through
the morning, but should slowly shift offshore by later this
afternoon as the upper system passes.  While small hail could occur
with the strongest onshore storms, no severe weather is anticipated.


...WA/OR...
Recent water vapor loop shows a strong shortwave trough approaching
the Pacific Northwest coast.  As this system approaches,
strengthening onshore flow and cold temperatures aloft will increase
the risk of at least isolated thunderstorms - mainly this evening.
