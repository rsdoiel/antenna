Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0702 AM CST Thu Feb 27 2025

Valid 271300Z - 281200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated to scattered thunderstorms are possible from the Mid and
Upper Ohio Valley to the Carolinas/southern Virginia.

...Synopsis...
Recent satellite imagery shows a pair of shortwave troughs moving
through the broadly cyclonic flow aloft extending from the
northern/central Plains and southern Canadian Prairies into the OH
Valley and Northeast. The lead wave in the pair is currently over
the Upper OH Valley, and should continue northeastward through the
Northeast States today. The trailing wave is currently moving
southeastward through the Upper Midwest, with the expectation that
it will pivot more eastward as it moves through the Upper Great
Lakes and OH Valley today before then continuing eastward through
the Mid-Atlantic States overnight.

Recent surface analysis placed a low over eastern Lake Erie, with an
extensive cold front extending southwestward from this low into the
TX Hill Country. This low is forecast to progress northeastward up
the St. Lawrence Valley just ahead of the lead shortwave, with the
attendant front moving eastward/southeastward. A weak, secondary
frontal boundary is expected to move through the OH Valley,
demarcated primarily by a shift to stronger, more northwesterly
winds. Isolated thunderstorms are possible along both of these
fronts, mostly during the late afternoon and early evening.

...Mid/Upper OH Valley...
Very cold mid-level temperatures are expected to spread across the
region as the shortwave trough mentioned in the synopsis progresses
through. These cold temperatures and associated steep mid-level
lapse rates will occur atop a well-mixed boundary layer, resulting
in 7 to 8 deg C/km lapse rates throughout the troposphere. These
lapse rates will help support modest buoyancy, despite surface
temperatures in the upper 40s/low 50s and dewpoints in the upper
30s. Isolated thunderstorm development is anticipated along the
surface boundary that is expected to move through the region, with
the greatest coverage in the OH/KY/WV border vicinity this evening.
Predominantly low-topped thunderstorms with transient updraft
structures are anticipated. Even so, gusty winds and small hail may
be noted with the more persistent and organized updrafts. Overall
severe coverage is expected to be below thresholds for outlooking
any areas.

...Carolinas in central GA...
Modest pre-frontal buoyancy is expected to develop amid increasing
mid-level moisture and diurnal heating, supporting the potential for
isolated thunderstorms as the front moves through. Small hail and a
damaging gust or two are possible within the strongest storms, but a
largely anafrontal and elevated storm structure should keep the
overall severe potential low.

0402 AM CST Thu Feb 27 2025

Valid 021200Z - 071200Z

...DISCUSSION...
...D6/Tue - East Texas into the Mid/Lower Mississippi Valley...
A compact mid-level low will translate east across the Southwest on
Sunday which will result in lee cyclogenesis in the southern/central
High Plains. As surface high pressure across the Midwest translates
east, favorable low-level trajectories and strengthening flow across
the Gulf and southern Plains will initiate significant moisture
return across Texas. The initial mid-level low will weaken as it
moves across the Plains and into the Mid-Mississippi Valley on
D5/Monday. However, lee cyclogenesis will likely strengthen Monday
afternoon as a larger scale trough approaches the southern Plains.
Shortwave ridging will likely keep the dryline capped on Monday with
continued moistening beneath the capping inversion as low-level
moisture advection continues. 

By 12Z Tuesday, moisture recovery across the western Gulf should be
complete with 70F dewpoints forecast near the Gulf Coast by both GFS
and ECMWF ensembles. Confidence in the upper-level pattern is
increasing as the ECMWF and EC Ensembles have been consistent with
an amplified mid-level pattern across the central and southern
Plains now for several consecutive runs. In addition, the GFS/GEFS
has trended toward the more amplified ECMWF solution. As the
confidence in the overall pattern increases, the confidence for a
significant severe weather threat has also increased and 30% severe
weather probabilities have been added from East Texas to central
Mississippi. While specifics will remain uncertain until the event
draws closer, the potential for multiple rounds of severe convection
including supercells, clusters, and likely an eventual squall line
will likely bring a threat for all severe weather hazards including
strong tornadoes. 

...D7/Wed - Carolinas into the Southeast...
The ECMWF/ECS, which has been several days ahead of other extended
guidance on with this upcoming pattern, has trended toward greater
moisture penetration into the Southeast US and east of the
Appalachians. Low to mid 60s dewpoints in the presence of a very
strong wind field will support a large area of severe weather threat
from the Southeast to the Carolinas and perhaps into parts of the
Mid-Atlantic. Storm mode and specific hazards will be impacted by
prior day convection and the overall evolution of the deepening
surface low and associated cold front, but a great enough threat
exists for 15% severe weather probabilities for D7/Wednesday.

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated thunderstorms remain possible this evening mainly over
parts of eastern Louisiana and across Mississippi.

...Synopsis and Discussion...
Scattered thunderstorms continue to be most prevalent over the
northern and central Gulf, near the offshore surface low. A few
lightning flashes were noted over parts of northern LA into MS, but
in general, this activity should continue to wane as winds veer with
the passing lead wave aloft.

Elsewhere, a few flashes with weak convection were noted earlier
over southwest OR beneath cool temperatures aloft and in association
with a now departing shortwave trough. A very low chance of thunder
may linger in this area within the residual midlevel moist plume
this evening.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0229 PM CST Sun Feb 23 2025

Valid 251200Z - 031200Z

Fire weather potential will remain limited across the country
through much of the upcoming work week, though some fire concerns
may emerge across the southern High Plains beginning D6/Friday and
into the following weekend. A broad northwesterly flow regime aloft
is expected to persist for much of the upcoming week amid
persistent, and unseasonably strong, ridging across the western
CONUS. This regime will continue to promote dry conditions from the
southern Great Basin into the Four Corners and southern/central
Plains. Additionally, a return to unseasonably warm temperatures is
anticipated, which will support gradual fuel drying and an expansion
of elevated (80+ percentile) ERC values out of far West Texas and
into the southern Plains/Southwest. The passage of weak upper
disturbances across the northern latitudes will promote widespread,
but light, rain/snow chances and an influx of cooler continental air
for northern portions of the country, but could augment regional
pressure gradient winds across the southern High Plains where fuels
should be most receptive. This potential appears most prominent
around D6/Friday when most solutions suggest southwest winds could
approach critical thresholds within a dry downslope flow regime,
though deterministic/ensemble spread remains high at this range. A
transition to a more progressive upper-air regime is anticipated
heading into early March, which could signal an increase in fire
weather potential for parts of the Southwest and Plains as more
robust surface cyclones become probable across the southern U.S.

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms are not expected across the CONUS on Tuesday.

...Synopsis...
After an upper-level trough moves of the eastern Florida coast,
generally quasi-zonal flow will prevail across the CONUS. Two
shortwaves, one in central/northern Rockies and the other in
Mid-Atlantic, will have little in terms of moisture to work with.
Thunderstorm potential with these features will be quite low. Very
isolated thunderstorm activity could linger into early Tuesday
morning in Florida, but the departing shortwave/surface low will not
synoptically favor coverage at or above 10%.

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms should continue across portions of Louisiana and
immediate surrounding areas today. Additional isolated thunderstorms
may still occur in portions of Oregon/Washington. No severe weather
is expected.

...20Z Update...
The primary change made to the 20Z Day 1 Convective Outlook was to
trim western portions of the general thunder delineation over
Coastal TX. Low-level moisture advection and associated buoyancy is
translating east along the Gulf Coast in tandem with a mid-level
trough. As such, additional lightning flashes are most likely across
portions of LA into central/southern MS and adjacent waters. A few
lightning flashes still remain possible across portions of the
Pacific Northwest with the approach of a mid-level trough.

..Squitieri.. 02/23/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1012 AM CST Sun Feb 23 2025/

...TX/LA...
A prominent shortwave trough is tracking eastward across TX today,
providing lift and destabilization to parts of southeast TX and LA. 
Scattered thunderstorms have been occurring in this region through
the morning, but should slowly shift offshore by later this
afternoon as the upper system passes.  While small hail could occur
with the strongest onshore storms, no severe weather is anticipated.


...WA/OR...
Recent water vapor loop shows a strong shortwave trough approaching
the Pacific Northwest coast.  As this system approaches,
strengthening onshore flow and cold temperatures aloft will increase
the risk of at least isolated thunderstorms - mainly this evening.

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
A few thunderstorms are possible across South Florida and coastal
Oregon/Washington on Monday. No severe thunderstorms are expected.

...Synopsis...
A strong upper-level shortwave trough will move into the Northwest
Monday afternoon/evening. A broad upper-level trough in the Gulf
will sharpen as it approaches South Florida Monday evening. A
nebulous surface low in the Gulf will accompany the upper trough.
Diffuse surface boundaries in the eastern Gulf and South Florida
will be the focus for thunderstorm activity.

...South Florida/Keys...
A cluster of thunderstorms appears likely to be ongoing early Monday
off the southwestern Florida coast and perhaps near the Keys. This
activity will likely be east of the surface cold front and driven by
weak low-level warm advection. Current forecast guidance suggests
the greatest buoyancy will remain primarily over the Keys. Given the
stronger southwesterly flow aloft, it is possible a stronger storm
or two could develop. However, deep-layer shear will be parallel to
this activity, mid-level height falls will be neutral until late in
the period, and low-level wind fields will be rather weak. The
overall potential for even marginally severe storms continues to be
low. As stronger forcing arrives late, additional activity is
possible along the surface front in western Florida. However, it is
not clear if storms would be surface based or if buoyancy would be
sufficient for a severe threat.

...Northwest...
Strong wind fields will be in place across the region as a surface
low deepens west of the Olympic Peninsula. A line of at least
shallow, forced convection will impact portions of coastal
Washington/Oregon. A few stronger convectively enhanced wind gusts
are possible among the already strong synoptic flow. These gusts are
most likely along the immediate coast. Given minimal buoyancy, it
appears coverage of these convective gusts will be too isolated to
warrant highlights.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1001 AM CST Sun Feb 23 2025

Valid 231700Z - 241200Z

An Elevated risk area has been introduced for portions of far West
Texas and central to southern New Mexico. Morning surface
observations show very dry conditions in place (dewpoints in the
single digits to low teens) with a very dry residual mixed layer
above a shallow nocturnal inversion sampled in the 12z EPZ sounding.
Winds increasing to around 15 mph should coincide with RH minimums
in the low to mid teens per recent ensemble guidance, which has
trended towards higher probabilities of sustained elevated fire
weather conditions over a region with slowly increasing ERCs (which
currently sit at around the 80-90th percentile). Forecast concerns
regarding portions of WY and NE remain on track as outlined in the
previous discussion below.

..Moore.. 02/23/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0142 AM CST Sun Feb 23 2025/

...Synopsis...
Warm and dry downslope winds are forecast in the lee of the
Sacramento and Sandia Manzano mountains of eastern New Mexico, with
winds up to 20 MPH and relative humidity values dropping below 15%.
Across portions of eastern Wyoming into the Nebraska Panhandle,
winds could reach as high as 25-30 MPH with relative humidity below
20%. However, current ERC fuels guidance across both regions
suggests there is little support for wildfire ignition and spread,
especially with some recent wetting rainfall across portions of
Wyoming and Nebraska in the last 5 days. Given the lack of
supportive fuels, no fire-weather highlights will be introduced at
this time.
