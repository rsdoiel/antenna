Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0632 AM CST Wed Feb 26 2025

Valid 261300Z - 271200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated thunderstorms are possible across the Midwest and Ohio
Valley this afternoon and evening. Severe storms are not expected.

...Synopsis...
Recent satellite imagery shows a pair of shortwave troughs within
the northern stream, one currently over the central Plains and the
other farther west over the northern Rockies. The central Plains
shortwave is expected to continue eastward throughout the day,
moving through the Mid MS Valley and much of the OH Valley. Another
shortwave trough will follow quickly in the wake of this wave,
moving through Upper MS Valley late tonight/early tomorrow.
Evolution of these two waves will help sharpen the cyclonic flow
aloft over much of the Upper Great Lakes region and vicinity. 

At the surface, a low attendant to the central Plains shortwave
trough was recently analyzed over central IA. A cold front extends
southwestward from this low across southeast KS and western OK to
another low over northwest TX. The central IA surface low is
forecast to track eastward just ahead of its parent shortwave,
likely ending the period in the northern Lake Erie vicinity. As this
low moves eastward, the attendant cold front will progress
eastward/southeastward across the Mid MS and OH Valleys. Isolated
thunderstorms are expected along this front as it moves eastward. 

A few isolated thunderstorms also possible across northeast TX and
the Arklatex late tonight into early tomorrow morning. Here, a few
elevated storms are possible behind the surface front, amid modest
low/mid-level moistening and convergence along the 850-mb front.  

...Mid-South into the Middle OH Valley...
Limited moisture return is anticipated ahead of the cold front
mentioned in the synopsis, but mid 50s dewpoints could be in place
from southeast MO into southern IL and southern IN prior to the
passage of the cold front. Cooling mid-level temperatures and
surface temperatures in the upper 60s will combine with this limited
low-level moisture to support modest buoyancy (i.e. MLCAPE less than
500 J/kg). Thunderstorm development is anticipated as the front
interacts with this modest buoyancy, beginning around 21Z across the
southeast MO vicinity. Isolated thunderstorms will remain possible
along the front as it moves across the OH Valley, with the
increasing large-scale ascent aiding the development of deep
convection into areas where surface dewpoints are lower and buoyancy
is scant. Deep-layer flow is strong enough to support some updraft
organization, but the limited buoyancy is expected to keep updraft
duration too short for much organization. As such, the
severe-weather potential is low.

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated thunderstorms remain possible this evening mainly over
parts of eastern Louisiana and across Mississippi.

...Synopsis and Discussion...
Scattered thunderstorms continue to be most prevalent over the
northern and central Gulf, near the offshore surface low. A few
lightning flashes were noted over parts of northern LA into MS, but
in general, this activity should continue to wane as winds veer with
the passing lead wave aloft.

Elsewhere, a few flashes with weak convection were noted earlier
over southwest OR beneath cool temperatures aloft and in association
with a now departing shortwave trough. A very low chance of thunder
may linger in this area within the residual midlevel moist plume
this evening.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0229 PM CST Sun Feb 23 2025

Valid 251200Z - 031200Z

Fire weather potential will remain limited across the country
through much of the upcoming work week, though some fire concerns
may emerge across the southern High Plains beginning D6/Friday and
into the following weekend. A broad northwesterly flow regime aloft
is expected to persist for much of the upcoming week amid
persistent, and unseasonably strong, ridging across the western
CONUS. This regime will continue to promote dry conditions from the
southern Great Basin into the Four Corners and southern/central
Plains. Additionally, a return to unseasonably warm temperatures is
anticipated, which will support gradual fuel drying and an expansion
of elevated (80+ percentile) ERC values out of far West Texas and
into the southern Plains/Southwest. The passage of weak upper
disturbances across the northern latitudes will promote widespread,
but light, rain/snow chances and an influx of cooler continental air
for northern portions of the country, but could augment regional
pressure gradient winds across the southern High Plains where fuels
should be most receptive. This potential appears most prominent
around D6/Friday when most solutions suggest southwest winds could
approach critical thresholds within a dry downslope flow regime,
though deterministic/ensemble spread remains high at this range. A
transition to a more progressive upper-air regime is anticipated
heading into early March, which could signal an increase in fire
weather potential for parts of the Southwest and Plains as more
robust surface cyclones become probable across the southern U.S.

Valid 251200Z - 261200Z

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms are not expected across the CONUS on Tuesday.

...Synopsis...
After an upper-level trough moves of the eastern Florida coast,
generally quasi-zonal flow will prevail across the CONUS. Two
shortwaves, one in central/northern Rockies and the other in
Mid-Atlantic, will have little in terms of moisture to work with.
Thunderstorm potential with these features will be quite low. Very
isolated thunderstorm activity could linger into early Tuesday
morning in Florida, but the departing shortwave/surface low will not
synoptically favor coverage at or above 10%.

0117 PM CST Sun Feb 23 2025

Valid 232000Z - 241200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms should continue across portions of Louisiana and
immediate surrounding areas today. Additional isolated thunderstorms
may still occur in portions of Oregon/Washington. No severe weather
is expected.

...20Z Update...
The primary change made to the 20Z Day 1 Convective Outlook was to
trim western portions of the general thunder delineation over
Coastal TX. Low-level moisture advection and associated buoyancy is
translating east along the Gulf Coast in tandem with a mid-level
trough. As such, additional lightning flashes are most likely across
portions of LA into central/southern MS and adjacent waters. A few
lightning flashes still remain possible across portions of the
Pacific Northwest with the approach of a mid-level trough.

..Squitieri.. 02/23/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1012 AM CST Sun Feb 23 2025/

...TX/LA...
A prominent shortwave trough is tracking eastward across TX today,
providing lift and destabilization to parts of southeast TX and LA. 
Scattered thunderstorms have been occurring in this region through
the morning, but should slowly shift offshore by later this
afternoon as the upper system passes.  While small hail could occur
with the strongest onshore storms, no severe weather is anticipated.


...WA/OR...
Recent water vapor loop shows a strong shortwave trough approaching
the Pacific Northwest coast.  As this system approaches,
strengthening onshore flow and cold temperatures aloft will increase
the risk of at least isolated thunderstorms - mainly this evening.

1125 AM CST Sun Feb 23 2025

Valid 241200Z - 251200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
A few thunderstorms are possible across South Florida and coastal
Oregon/Washington on Monday. No severe thunderstorms are expected.

...Synopsis...
A strong upper-level shortwave trough will move into the Northwest
Monday afternoon/evening. A broad upper-level trough in the Gulf
will sharpen as it approaches South Florida Monday evening. A
nebulous surface low in the Gulf will accompany the upper trough.
Diffuse surface boundaries in the eastern Gulf and South Florida
will be the focus for thunderstorm activity.

...South Florida/Keys...
A cluster of thunderstorms appears likely to be ongoing early Monday
off the southwestern Florida coast and perhaps near the Keys. This
activity will likely be east of the surface cold front and driven by
weak low-level warm advection. Current forecast guidance suggests
the greatest buoyancy will remain primarily over the Keys. Given the
stronger southwesterly flow aloft, it is possible a stronger storm
or two could develop. However, deep-layer shear will be parallel to
this activity, mid-level height falls will be neutral until late in
the period, and low-level wind fields will be rather weak. The
overall potential for even marginally severe storms continues to be
low. As stronger forcing arrives late, additional activity is
possible along the surface front in western Florida. However, it is
not clear if storms would be surface based or if buoyancy would be
sufficient for a severe threat.

...Northwest...
Strong wind fields will be in place across the region as a surface
low deepens west of the Olympic Peninsula. A line of at least
shallow, forced convection will impact portions of coastal
Washington/Oregon. A few stronger convectively enhanced wind gusts
are possible among the already strong synoptic flow. These gusts are
most likely along the immediate coast. Given minimal buoyancy, it
appears coverage of these convective gusts will be too isolated to
warrant highlights.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1001 AM CST Sun Feb 23 2025

Valid 231700Z - 241200Z

An Elevated risk area has been introduced for portions of far West
Texas and central to southern New Mexico. Morning surface
observations show very dry conditions in place (dewpoints in the
single digits to low teens) with a very dry residual mixed layer
above a shallow nocturnal inversion sampled in the 12z EPZ sounding.
Winds increasing to around 15 mph should coincide with RH minimums
in the low to mid teens per recent ensemble guidance, which has
trended towards higher probabilities of sustained elevated fire
weather conditions over a region with slowly increasing ERCs (which
currently sit at around the 80-90th percentile). Forecast concerns
regarding portions of WY and NE remain on track as outlined in the
previous discussion below.

..Moore.. 02/23/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0142 AM CST Sun Feb 23 2025/

...Synopsis...
Warm and dry downslope winds are forecast in the lee of the
Sacramento and Sandia Manzano mountains of eastern New Mexico, with
winds up to 20 MPH and relative humidity values dropping below 15%.
Across portions of eastern Wyoming into the Nebraska Panhandle,
winds could reach as high as 25-30 MPH with relative humidity below
20%. However, current ERC fuels guidance across both regions
suggests there is little support for wildfire ignition and spread,
especially with some recent wetting rainfall across portions of
Wyoming and Nebraska in the last 5 days. Given the lack of
supportive fuels, no fire-weather highlights will be introduced at
this time.
