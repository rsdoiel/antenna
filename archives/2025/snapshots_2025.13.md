## Quoting Andriy Burkov

date: 2025-04-06, updated: 2025-04-06, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<blockquote cite="https://twitter.com/burkov/status/1908961952141091196"><p>[...] The disappointing releases of both GPT-4.5 and Llama 4 have shown that if you don't train a model to reason with reinforcement learning, increasing its size no longer provides benefits.</p>
<p>Reinforcement learning is limited only to domains where a reward can be assigned to the generation result. Until recently, these domains were math, logic, and code. Recently, these domains have also included factual question answering, where, to find an answer, the model must learn to execute several searches. This is how these "deep search" models have likely been trained.</p>
<p>If your business idea isn't in these domains, now is the time to start building your business-specific dataset. The potential increase in generalist models' skills will no longer be a threat.</p></blockquote>

## Note on 6th April 2025

date: 2025-04-06, updated: 2025-04-06, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p>Some friends are traveling to Japan, and in bombarding them with unsolicited tips to try to convince them to visit <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huis_Ten_Bosch_(theme_park)">Huis Ten Bosch</a> - the Dutch theme park near Nagasaki - I was reminded of my all-time favorite piece of travel writing, by Richard Hendy: <strong><a href="https://spikejapan.wordpress.com/2011/01/23/huis-ten-bosch-only-miffy-can-save-us-now/">Huis ten Bosch: Only Miffy can save us now</a></strong> - also <a href="https://spikejapan.wordpress.com/2011/02/05/huis-ten-bosch-only-miffy-can-save-us-now-2/">part two</a> and <a href="https://spikejapan.wordpress.com/2011/02/19/huis-ten-bosch-only-miffy-can-save-us-now-3/">part three</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Monumental in its conception, extravagant in its execution, and epic in its failure, Huis ten Bosch is the greatest by far of all of the progeny of Japan‚Äôs Bubble era dreams.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is so much good stuff in these essays, including a delightful divergence to cover the psychic toad that ended up responsible for more than $10 billion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] late at night scores of black limousines would park up outside one of her restaurants, Egawa, disgorging bankers for s√©ances, inspired by esoteric mikkyo Buddhism, on the fourth floor, overseen by a giant ceramic toad standing a meter tall.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Richard's essays convinced us to visit Huis Ten Bosch in 2014 and it was a highlight of our trip to Japan.

## Initial impressions of Llama 4

date: 2025-04-05, updated: 2025-04-05, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p>Dropping a model release as significant as Llama 4 on a weekend is plain unfair! So far the best place to learn about the new model family is <a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/llama-4-multimodal-intelligence/">this post on the Meta AI blog</a>. They've released two new models today: Llama 4 Maverick is a 400B model (128 experts, 17B active parameters), text and image input with a 1 million token context length. Llama 4 Scout is 109B total parameters (16 experts, 17B active), also multi-modal and with a claimed 10 million token context length - an industry first.</p>

<p>They also describe Llama 4 Behemoth, a not-yet-released "288 billion active parameter model with 16 experts that is our most powerful yet and among the world‚Äôs smartest LLMs". Behemoth has 2 trillion parameters total and was used to train both Scout and Maverick.</p>
<p>No news yet on a Llama reasoning model beyond <a href="https://www.llama.com/llama4-reasoning-is-coming/">this coming soon page</a> with a looping video of an academic-looking llama.</p>

<p>Llama 4 Maverick is now sat in second place on <a href="https://lmarena.ai/?leaderboard">the LM Arena leaderboard</a>, just behind Gemini 2.5 Pro. <em><strong>Update</strong>: It turns out that's not the same model as the Maverick they released - I missed that their announcement says "Llama 4 Maverick offers a best-in-class performance to cost ratio with an experimental chat version scoring ELO of 1417 on LMArena."</em></p>

<p>You can try them out using the chat interface from OpenRouter (or through the OpenRouter API) for <a href="https://openrouter.ai/meta-llama/llama-4-scout">Llama 4 Scout</a> and <a href="https://openrouter.ai/meta-llama/llama-4-maverick">Llama 4 Maverick</a>. OpenRouter are proxying through to <a href="https://console.groq.com/docs/models">Groq</a>, <a href="https://fireworks.ai/models">Fireworks</a> and <a href="https://docs.together.ai/docs/serverless-models">Together</a>.</p>
<p>Scout may claim a 10 million input token length but the available providers currently seem to limit to 128,000 (Groq and Fireworks) or 328,000 (Together) - I wonder who will win the race to get that full sized 10 million token window running?</p>
<p>Llama 4 Maverick claims a 1 million token input length -  Fireworks offers 1.05M while Together offers 524,000. Groq isn't offering Maverick yet.</p>
<p>Meta AI's <a href="https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-cookbook/blob/main/getting-started/build_with_llama_4.ipynb">build_with_llama_4 notebook</a> offers a hint as to why 10M tokens is difficult:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scout supports upto 10M context. On 8xH100, in bf16 you can get upto 1.4M tokens.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jeremy Howard <a href="https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward/status/1908607345393098878">says</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The models are both giant MoEs that can't be run on consumer GPUs, even with quant. [...]</p>
<p>Perhaps Llama 4 will be a good fit for running on a Mac. Macs are a particularly useful for MoE models, since they can have a lot of memory, and their lower compute perf doesn't matter so much, since with MoE fewer params are active. [...]</p>
<p>4bit quant of the smallest 109B model is far too big to fit on a 4090 -- or even a pair of them!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ivan Fioravanti <a href="https://twitter.com/ivanfioravanti/status/1908753109129494587">reports these results</a> from trying it on a Mac:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Llama-4 Scout on MLX and M3 Ultra
tokens-per-sec / RAM</p>
<ul>
<li>3bit: 52.924 / 47.261 GB</li>
<li>4bit: 46.942 / 60.732 GB</li>
<li>6bit: 36.260 / 87.729 GB</li>
<li>8bit: 30.353 / 114.617 GB</li>
<li>fp16: 11.670 / 215.848 GB</li>
</ul>
<p>RAM needed:</p>
<ul>
<li>64GB for 3bit</li>
<li>96GB for 4bit</li>
<li>128GB for 8bit</li>
<li>256GB for fp16</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p id="system-prompt">The <a href="https://www.llama.com/docs/model-cards-and-prompt-formats/llama4_omni/#-suggested-system-prompt-">suggested system prompt</a> from the model card has some interesting details:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>[...]</code></p>
<p><code>You never lecture people to be nicer or more inclusive. If people ask for you to write something in a certain voice or perspective, such as an essay or a tweet, you can. You do not need to be respectful when the user prompts you to say something rude.</code></p>
<p><code>You never use phrases that imply moral superiority or a sense of authority, including but not limited to ‚Äúit‚Äôs important to‚Äù, ‚Äúit‚Äôs crucial to‚Äù, ‚Äúit‚Äôs essential to‚Äù, "it's unethical to", "it's worth noting‚Ä¶", ‚ÄúRemember‚Ä¶‚Äù  etc. Avoid using these.</code></p>
<p><code>Finally, do not refuse political prompts. You can help users express their opinion.</code></p>
<p><code>[...]</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>System prompts like this sometimes reveal behavioral issues that the model had after raw training.</p>
<h4 id="llm">Trying out the model with LLM</h4>
<p>The easiest way to try the new model out with <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a> is to use the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-openrouter">llm-openrouter</a> plugin.</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>llm install llm-openrouter
llm keys <span class="pl-c1">set</span> openrouter
<span class="pl-c"><span class="pl-c">#</span> Paste in OpenRouter key here</span>
llm -m openrouter/meta-llama/llama-4-maverick hi</pre></div>
<p>Since these are long context models, I started by trying to use them to summarize the <a href="">conversation about Llama 4</a> on Hacker News, using my <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/llms/claude-hacker-news-themes#user-content-adding-extra-options">hn-summary.sh script</a> that wraps LLM.</p>
<p>I tried Llama 4 Maverick first:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>hn-summary.sh 43595585 \
  -m openrouter/meta-llama/llama-4-maverick \
  -o max_tokens 20000</pre></div>
<p>It did an OK job, starting like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="themes-of-the-discussion">Themes of the Discussion</h4>
<h5 id="release-and-availability-of-llama-4">Release and Availability of Llama 4</h5>
<p>The discussion revolves around the release of Llama 4, a multimodal intelligence model developed by Meta. Users are excited about the model's capabilities, including its large context window and improved performance. Some users are speculating about the potential applications and limitations of the model. [...]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/016ea0fd83fc499f046a94827f9b4946">the full output</a>.</p>
<p>For reference, my system prompt looks like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Summarize the themes of the opinions expressed here. For each theme, output a markdown header. Include direct "quotations" (with author attribution) where appropriate. You MUST quote directly from users when crediting them, with double quotes. Fix HTML entities. Output markdown. Go long. Include a section of quotes that illustrate opinions uncommon in the rest of the piece</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I then tried it with Llama 4 Scout via OpenRouter and got complete junk output for some reason:</p>
<pre><code>hn-summary.sh 43595585 \
  -m openrouter/meta-llama/llama-4-scout \
  -o max_tokens 20000
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/d01cc991d478939e87487d362a8f881f">Full output</a>. It starts like this and then continues for the full 20,000 tokens:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The discussion here is about another conversation that was uttered.)</p>
<p>Here are the results.)</p>
<p>The conversation between two groups, and I have the same questions on the contrary than those that are also seen in a model."). The fact that I see a lot of interest here.)</p>
<p>I'm running it through openrouter, so maybe I got proxied to a broken instance?</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>The reason) The reason) The reason <em>(loops until it runs out of tokens)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This looks broken. I was using OpenRouter so it's possible I got routed to a broken instance.</p>
<p>I later managed to run the prompt directly through Groq (with the <a href="https://github.com/angerman/llm-groq">llm-groq</a> plugin) - but that had a 2048 limit on output size for some reason:</p>
<pre><code>hn-summary.sh 43595585 \
  -m groq/meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct \
  -o max_tokens 2048
</code></pre>
<p>Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/a205c5fc131a1d4e9cd6c432a07feedb">the full result</a>. It followed my instructions but was <em>very</em> short - just 630 tokens of output.</p>
<p>For comparison, here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/f21ecc7fb2aa13ff682d4ffa11ddcbfd">the same thing</a> run against Gemini 2.5 Pro. Gemini's results was <em>massively</em> better, producing 5,584 output tokens (it spent an additional 2,667 tokens on "thinking").</p>
<p>I'm not sure how much to judge Llama 4 by these results to be honest - the model has only been out for a few hours and it's quite possible that the providers I've tried running again aren't yet optimally configured for this kind of long-context prompt.</p>
<h4 id="my-hopes-for-llama-4">My hopes for Llama 4</h4>
<p>I'm hoping that Llama 4 plays out in a similar way to Llama 3.</p>
<p>The first Llama 3 models released were 8B and 70B, <a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3/">last April</a>.</p>
<p>Llama 3.1 followed <a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/">in July</a> at 8B, 70B, and 405B. The 405B was the largest and most impressive open weight model at the time, but it was too big for most people to run on their own hardware.</p>
<p>Llama 3.2 <a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/llama-3-2-connect-2024-vision-edge-mobile-devices/">in September</a> is where things got really interesting: 1B, 3B, 11B and 90B. The 1B and 3B models both work on my iPhone, and are surprisingly capable! The 11B and 90B models were the first Llamas to support vision, and the 11B <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Sep/25/llama-32/">ran on my Mac</a>.</p>
<p>Then Llama 3.3 landed in December with a 70B model that <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/9/llama-33-70b/">I wrote about as a GPT-4 class model that ran on my Mac</a>. It claimed performance similar to the earlier Llama 3.1 405B!</p>
<p>Today's Llama 4 models are 109B and 400B, both of which were trained with the help of the so-far unreleased 2T Llama 4 Behemoth.</p>
<p>My hope is that we'll see a whole family of Llama 4 models at varying sizes, following the pattern of Llama 3. I'm particularly excited to see if they produce an improved ~3B model that runs on my phone. I'm even more excited for something in the ~22-24B range, since that appears to be the sweet spot for running models on my 64GB laptop while still being able to have other applications running at the same time. Mistral Small 3.1 is a 24B model and is <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/17/mistral-small-31/">absolutely superb</a>.</p>

## GMKtec NucBox G9 Review: this tiny NAS supports four M.2 SSDs and dual 2.5 GbE LAN connections

<p>There&#8217;s a thin line between a mini PC and a network-attached storage (NAS) device. Effectively a NAS¬†is just a small computer that&#8217;s purpose-built to let you connect a decent amount of storage to a network so that it can be accessed by other devices on that network. But up until recently most of the NAS [&#8230;]</p>

## Aversion to History: A PKZIP/Wikipedia Story

date: 2025-04-05, from: PCjs Blog

<p>A couple of years ago, while sifting through lots of ZIP archives from old <a href="https://www.pcjs.org/blog/2023/04/06/">Shareware CD-ROMs</a>,
I found quite a few that couldn‚Äôt be unzipped, either because they were corrupted, encrypted, or used compression methods that were
no longer supported by modern ZIP utilities.  That took me on a journey of ZIP (and ARC) decompression, and I created some new PCjs
decompression tools in the process, including the ability to <a href="https://www.pcjs.org/blog/2023/04/06/#creating-disk-images-from-zip-files">create disk images directly from ZIP files</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, you can‚Äôt go down that rabbit hole without digging into the history of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_(file_format)">ZIP file format</a>,
or the person who developed it, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Katz">Phil Katz</a>, or the first program to create ZIP files: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKZIP">PKZIP</a>.
There‚Äôs a lot of history there, and many other rabbit holes you can go down, but this post is going to focus on one ‚Äúhole‚Äù in particular.</p>

<h3 id="pkzip-version-history">PKZIP Version History</h3>

<p>Specifically, I‚Äôm talking about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKZIP">PKZIP Wikipedia Page</a> and the history of its
version history.</p>

<p>I remembered visiting that Wikipedia page several years ago and seeing a fairly detailed history of PKZIP and all
its versions.  But when I visited the page earlier <em>this</em> year, the version history was gone.</p>

<p>At first, I thought perhaps I misremembered where I‚Äôd seen that version history, so I searched the web, and one of the top results
was ‚Äú<a href="https://entropymine.wordpress.com/2019/08/09/survey-of-pkzip-versions-for-ms-dos/">Survey of PKZIP versions for MS-DOS</a>‚Äù‚Äù from Jason Summer‚Äôs <a href="https://entropymine.wordpress.com/">Entropymine blog</a>,
which, coincidentally, mentioned the same Wikipedia page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúI wanted to know exactly what versions of the old PKZIP compression software were publicly released for MS-DOS,
and some basic characteristics about them, particularly what compression methods they used when compressing files.
Sure, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKZIP">Wikipedia</a> has a list, but it wasn‚Äôt quite what I wanted, and it omitted
at least one version I was pretty sure existed.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I wasn‚Äôt wrong.  In 2019, Wikipedia had a list, and I was pretty sure I‚Äôd seen the same list back in 2022.  But now it was gone.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs not hard to find the old list ‚Äì once you know it existed ‚Äì by browsing the page‚Äôs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=PKZIP&amp;action=history">history</a>
and choosing, for example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=PKZIP&amp;oldid=823135028">this page from January 2018</a>
(that revision caught my eye only because someone had added information about PKZIP versions 1.93a and 2.04c).</p>

<h3 id="the-great-deletion">The Great Deletion</h3>

<p>On December 3, 2022, Wikipedia user <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Pppery">Pppery</a> (someone who never before and never
again contributed anything substantive to the page) decided to delete the entire ‚ÄúVersion history‚Äù section, using the
citation <strong>WP:NOTCHANGELOG</strong>.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs what that citation refers to:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a></p>

  <p>To provide encyclopedic value, data should be put in context with explanations referenced to independent sources.
As explained in ¬ß Encyclopedic content above, merely being true, or even verifiable, does not automatically make
something suitable for inclusion in the encyclopedia. Wikipedia articles should not be:</p>

  <p>‚Ä¶</p>

  <p><strong>Exhaustive logs of software updates</strong>. Use reliable third-party (not self-published or official) sources in articles
dealing with software updates to describe the versions listed or discussed in the article. Common sense must be applied
regarding the level of detail to include. A list of every version/beta/patch is inappropriate. Consider a summary of
development instead.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That all sounds reasonable to me, and even if it didn‚Äôt, I‚Äôm not an authority on ‚Äúencyclopedic values‚Äù, so my opinion is
pretty irrelevant.  Besides, I agree that anyone creating new content should make an effort to abide by Wikipedia‚Äôs
guidelines.  However, guidelines evolve over time, so it‚Äôs not always clear whether a contributor simply ignored guidelines
or their content later fell victim to evolving standards.</p>

<p>And speaking of standards, there seems to be a ‚Äúdouble-standard‚Äù, because it‚Äôs not hard to find other Wikipedia pages
on other popular or significant software packages that have their own detailed version history, such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop">Adobe Photoshop</a>.
In fact, the version histories of DOS and Windows are <em>so</em> important that they have their own dedicated pages
(see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_DOS_operating_systems">Timeline of DOS operating systems</a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Microsoft_Windows_versions">List of Microsoft Windows versions</a>).</p>

<p>However, my real quibble is not with the guidelines or how loosely they‚Äôre followed.  What bothers me is the wholesale
act of <em>deleting</em> a large amount of information <em>after</em> it has already been created, without making any effort to first
summarize that information (as the guidelines specifically suggest) <em>or</em> even alerting the Wikipedia community that
there are issues with it.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm always seeing notices on Wikipedia pages about the need to improve content, from small ‚Äú[citation needed]‚Äù notations to
large banners, like this very notice on the PKZIP page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúThis article relies excessively on references to primary sources. Please improve this article by adding secondary or
tertiary sources.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those notices are great ways to engage people to help improve the content.  What is <em>not</em> a great way is simply deleting
the content.</p>

<h3 id="pkzip-version-history-2007-2022">PKZIP Version History (2007-2022)</h3>

<p>PKZIP version history was first added to Wikipedia in October 2007 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Jacob_Poon">Jacob Poon</a>
and regularly updated by him through 2009.  Here‚Äôs what it looked like right before it was deleted in late 2022.</p>

<ul>
  <li>PKZIP 0.8 (released on January 1, 1989) initial version</li>
  <li>PKZIP 0.9 (released on February 10, 1989) supported reducing algorithm (from SCRNCH by Graeme McRae)[1] with four compression settings and shrinking. In addition to PKZIP and PKUNZIP, it also included ZIP2EXE, a utility for creating a self-extracting archive which required an external self-extracting executable header created by MAKESFX from the PKZIP executable package.</li>
  <li>PKZIP 0.92 (released on March 6, 1989): In addition to bug fixes, PKZIP included an option to automatically choose the best compression method for each file. New tools included with PKZIP include PKZipFix.</li>
  <li>PKZIP 1.01 (released on July 21, 1989) added Implode compression, while reduced files can only be extracted from ZIP archive. Imploding was chosen based on the characteristics of the file being compressed.[2] New utility included Thomas Atkinson‚Äôs REZIP conversion utility (part of ZIP-KIT). PKZIP‚Äôs default compression behavior was changed from fastest (Shrink) to best (Implode). Supported platforms include OS/2, DOS.</li>
  <li>PKZIP 1.02 (released on October 1, 1989) includes new utility BIOSFIX.COM, which preserved the entire 80386 register set during any mode switches via INT 15H. OS/2 version added ZIP2EXE and 2 self-extracting archive headers.</li>
  <li>PKZIP 1.10 (released on March 15, 1990): New features included authenticity verification, ‚Äúmini‚Äù PKSFX self-extracting module, integrating self-extracting module into ZIP2EXE, ability to save &amp; restore volume labels. Imploding was up to 5X faster and compression ratio was improved over 1.02. EAX register was always saved on 80386 or above CPU. Removed tools included BIOSFIX, REZIP, MAKESFX.</li>
  <li>PKZIP 1.93a (released in October 1991): An alpha version that introduced a new compression method which Katz called ‚Äúdeflating‚Äù. It was supposed to be quickly followed by a final PKZIP 2 release, but there were numerous delays.</li>
  <li>PKZIP 2.04g (released in January 1993): By the time the release was ready, fake 2.x releases were circulating, some of them malware, so an untainted version number was chosen instead of 2.0. This new version dispensed with the miscellaneous compression methods of PKZIP 1.x and replaced them with the deflate algorithm (although several levels of deflation were provided by the program). The resulting file format has since become ubiquitous on Microsoft Windows and on the Internet ‚Äì almost all files with the .ZIP (or .zip) extension are in PKZIP 2.x format, and utilities to read and write these files are available on all common platforms. PKZIP 2.x also supported spanning archives to multiple disk, which simply split the files into multiple pieces, and using volume label on each drive to differentiate each other. A new Authenticity Verification (AV) signature format was used. Registered version included PKUNZJR, PK Safe ANSI, PKCFG utilities.</li>
  <li>PKZIP 2.06 was released in 1994. It was a version of PKZIP 2.04g licensed to IBM.[3]</li>
  <li>PKZIP 2.50 (released on April 15, 1998) was the first version released for Windows 3.1, 95, NT platforms. DOS version of PKZIP 2.50 was released on 1999-03-01, as its final MS-DOS product. PKZIP 2.50 supported long file names on all builds, and Deflate64 extraction. DCL Implode extraction was supported on non-DOS ports. A new command-line product was introduced in Windows 95, OS/2, UNIX platforms, called ‚ÄúPKZIP Command Line‚Äù (later expanded to ‚ÄúPKZIP Server‚Äù), which featured new command line syntax.</li>
  <li>PKZIP 2.6 was the last version to support Windows 3.1 and Windows NT for the Alpha and PowerPC platforms.</li>
  <li>PKZIP 2.70 added email MAPI (i.e. Send To) support. Registered version included creation of configurable self-extracted archives, added Authenticity Verification (AV) Information. Distribution Licensed versions included enhanced self-extractors. Professional distribution licensed version could create self-extracting patch files, and includes self-extractors for several new platforms.</li>
  <li>PKZIP 4.0 was an updated version of PKZIP 2.7. Version 3 was skipped as a result of PKZIP 3.0 Trojan.[4] It supported Deflate64 and DCL Implode compression, and the use of X.509 v3 certificate-based authentication.,[5] creation of Span or Split large .ZIP archives. Old PKZIP command line conversion tools were introduced.</li>
  <li>On August 21, 2001, PKWARE announced the availability of PKZIP 4.5.[6] PKZIP 4.5 included ZIP64 archives support, which allowed more than 65535 files per ZIP archives, and storing files larger than 4 gigabytes into .ZIP archive. A version called PKZIP Suite 4.5 also included PKZIP Command Line 4.5, PKZIP Explorer 1.5, PKZIP Attachments 1.1, and PKZIP Plug-In 1.0.</li>
  <li>PKZIP 5.0 was announced in 2002,[7] which introduced Strong Encryption Specification (SES) for the Professional version of the product, which initially included DES, 3DES, RC2, RC4 encryption formats, and the use of using X.509 v3 certificate-based encryption.</li>
  <li>PKZIP 6.0 (released in 2003) added support for bzip2 (based on Burrows‚ÄìWheeler transform) compression, with Professional Edition supporting 256-bit AES.[8]</li>
  <li>PKZIP 7.0 changed SES to use non-OAEP key wrapping for compatibility with smart cards and USB tokens. Support of creating AV authenticity verification archives was dropped. PKZIP could now create archives of the following types: ZIP, bzip2, GZIP, tar, UUEncoded, XXEncoded.</li>
  <li>PKZIP 8.0 was released on April 27, 2004.[9] In addition, PKWARE renamed its PKZip Professional to SecureZIP.[10] Creation of ZIP archives with encrypted headers was available.</li>
  <li>PKZIP 9.0 was the first version to unofficially support Windows Vista (as administrator).[11] Creation of RC2, DES-encrypted ZIP archives are dropped.</li>
  <li>PKZIP 10 Enterprise Edition and SecureZIP 10 were released on i5/OS. It offered the ability to create ZIP64 archives for the target platform.[12] Desktop PKZIP version was no longer developed beyond version 9.</li>
</ul>

<p>And yes, I‚Äôm well aware that instead of wasting my time on this ‚Äúrant‚Äù, I could create a Wikipedia account, become a contributor,
and fix the PKZIP page myself ‚Äì or at least try to.</p>

<p>And in fact, I did recently create an account on Wikipedia with that thought in mind, but that was just the first step in a long process.
After signing up, Wikipedia wanted me to spend a certain amount of time editing other articles first, learning the ropes, reading the
guidelines, etc.  Perhaps I could have immediately jumped to the PKZIP page and clicked ‚Äúundo‚Äù on the ‚ÄúVersion history‚Äù deletion,
but even if that had been allowed, that seemed a little too passive-aggressive.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs much easier for me to just write whatever I want on my own website ‚Äì adhering at all times to the strictest of guidelines, of course. ;-)</p>

<h2 id="my-own-limited-survey-of-pkzip-versions-1989-1993">My Own Limited Survey of PKZIP Versions (1989-1993)</h2>

<p>On a tangential note, here‚Äôs a summary of what I recently learned about PKZIP versions while working through the <a href="https://archive.org/details/ibm-wgam-wbiz-collection">ibm-wgam-wbiz-collection</a>,
which has now been ingested by <a href="https://discmaster.textfiles.com/">DiscMaster</a>.</p>

<p>A few versions were missing from Wikipedia‚Äôs list, and even a couple were missing from Jason Summers‚Äô list (1.00√ü and 2.01).</p>

<p>In all cases, I tried to find downloads that appeared to be close to, if not actual, distribution copies.
I have not tried to enumerate all the differences between the versions, although I have included the various <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WHATSNEW</code> documents
that shipped alongside each <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PKZIP.EXE</code> below.</p>

A:\&gt;TYPE WHATSNEW.102
Version 1.02 is a minor bug fix for version 1.01 of PKZIP,
PKUNZIP, and ZIP2EXE for the MS-DOS software; and PKSFX and
ZIP2EXE for the OS/2 software.  No new features have been added
to the software in this release.

Those who have registered version 1.0x and are due a free
upgrade will receive PKZIP/PKUNZIP/PKSFX(R) etc. version 1.1,
with manual, when it becomes avaliable.


MS-DOS
======

New files:  PKZIP.EXE, PKUNZIP.EXE, ZIP2EXE.EXE, BIOSFIX.COM
            REZIP.ZIP, MAKESFX.COM

All other files are the same as for version 1.01.

Description of changes
----------------------

  o An updated version of Thomas Atkinson's REZIP is included
    with this version, that properly handles paths stored
    within a .ZIP file.

  o Several people have reported problems with PKZIP/PKUNZIP
    1.01 on 80386 computers, especially with disk caching
    programs using EXTended memory, such as Super PC-Kwik.
    This is due to the fact that Super PC-Kwik will access
    '80286 extended memory' during the timer interrupt via
    the BIOS interrupt 15H.  However, this corrupts the 32-bit
    accumulator (EAX) in the 80386 CPU, and neither many BIOS's
    nor PC-Kwik bother to preserve the EAX register.  If you have
    an 80386 CPU and have had problems with PKZIP/PKUNZIP 1.01,
    try these work-arounds, in the following order:

    - Run BIOSFIX.COM supplied with version 1.02.  BIOSFIX
      is a small (288 bytes resident) TSR program that preserves
      the entire 80386 register set during any mode switches via
      INT 15H.  This has been tested with Super PC-Kwik, and
      should work with other programs that may be performing
      asynchronouos CPU mode switching.

    - Use an 80386 memory manager such as QEMM or 386^MAX which
      will control and preserve the 80386 machine state.  Also,
      use exPANded memory with your application instead of
      exTENded memory, if possible.

    - If you are using Super PC-Kwik, place /H- /D- on the
      SUPERPCK command line.

    - SET the environment variable PKNO386=xxxx where "xxxx"
      is any string you want.  If the string PKNO386 is present
      in the environment, then PKZIP/PKUNZIP 1.02 will not use
      80386 instructions or registers.  Note however that
      disabling the 80386 usage will make PKZIP run up to 20%
      slower and PKUNZIP up to 40% slower than if the 80386
      instructions are used.

  o Using the "-c" option with PKZIP 1.01 could, in very rare
    instances, cause random corruption of the .ZIP file.  This
    was due to an anomoly in the MSC _ffree() function when
    passed a canonical pointer.  This has been corrected in
    PKZIP 1.02.

  o There is bug in MS-DOS 3.3 and 4.x when SHARE is loaded and
    I/O redirection is used, that sometimes prevents a file or
    device, once redirected to, from ever being opened in a
    sharing mode.  This would cause PKUNZIP to display the message 
    "can't open: NUL" when using the "-t" test option.  PKUNZIP 1.02
    first tries to open NUL in share-deny-none mode, and if that
    fails, it will open the NUL device in compatibility mode,
    bypassing SHARE.

  o ZIP2EXE 1.01 could, on occasion, erroneously report that the
    .ZIP file it was converting contained Reduced files.  This has
    been corrected in this release.

  o When PKZIP 1.01 would be unable to open a file that it was
    trying to compress (it is locked by another program on a
    network, for example) PKZIP would display a message that
    the file could not be added.  However, when PKZIP terminated
    it would exit with an exit code of 0 in this circumstance.
    Several people have requested a way of determining this
    condition when run from a program or batch file, so PKZIP 1.02
    will exit with an errorlevel of 18 when it is unable to open
    one or more files that were specified.  It should be noted that
    this is a 'warning' condition only, and that otherwise PKZIP
    was able to construct the .ZIP file without any errors.


OS/2
====

New files:  PKSFX2.PRG, PKSFXF.PRG, ZIP2EXE.EXE

All other files are the same as for version 1.01.

Description of changes
----------------------

  o The same condition reported above for ZIP2EXE could also
    occur with the OS/2 version of ZIP2EXE.

  o The PKSFX2 and PKSFXF programs would fail if the self-
    extracting file contained more than approximately 50 files.
    This was due to an anomoly between memory allocation under
    MS-DOS vs OS/2, and has been corrected in this release.

Some Common Questions &amp; Answers
-------------------------------

o Where is my copy of PKSFX??  I ran PKZ102.EXE, but I don't have 
  the third program, PKSFX.
  
  - You have to run the program MAKESFX to create the file PKSFX.PRG.

o Why is the new version of PKZIP so much slower than my earlier version?

  - PKZIP version 0.90 or 0.92 defaulted to its fastest compression
    method, called Shrinking.  PKZIP 1.0 defaults to its best
    compressing, albeit slower method called Imploding.  Imploding
    typically compresses much better than Shrinking.  However, you can
    still tell PKZIP 1.02 to perform Shrinking if you want by specifying
    "-es" on the PKZIP command line, or by placing COMPRESS=SPEED in
    your PKZIP.CFG file.  See MANUAL.DOC for more information about
    specifying what compression method is to be used with PKZIP.

o Do I have to convert the .ZIP files I made with earlier version of PKZIP?

  - No, PKZIP and PKUNZIP 1.02 can read and extract .ZIP files created
    by any version of the software.  However, converting .ZIP files
    created by PKZIP 0.92 with the new software can result in additional
    compression.

A:\&gt;TYPE WHATSNEW.110

Several new features have been added to PKZIP/PKUNZIP/PKSFX
version 1.1.  Read the file ADDENDUM.DOC for a complete
description of these changes and enhancements.  Highlights
of PKZIP/PKUNZIP/PKSFX etc. version 1.1 include:

- PKZIP 1.1 Imploding is up to 5X faster, particularly on large
  spreadsheet and database type files where PKZIP 1.02 would run
  relatively slowly.  Most 'typical' types of files should
  implode 5% to 25% faster.  In addition, compression has been
  improved over version 1.02 as well.

- Authenticity Verification.

- A 2,934 byte "mini" PKSFX self-extracting module.

- ZIP2EXE no longer requires the external file PKSFX.PRG.

- The ability to save &amp; restore volume labels.

- Defensive use of the 32 bit accumulator EAX on 80386 or 80486
  computers. In many instances, such as when using MultiSoft's
  PC-KWIK cache or Novell non-dedicated NetWare software, if you
  needed to set the PKNO386 environment variable with
  PKZIP/PKUNZIP version 1.02, you probably don't need to set this
  anymore with PKZIP/PKUNZIP version 1.1.

  There appear to be many programs that use exTENded memory
  and/or '80286 protected mode' that have absolutely no regard to
  saving or restoring the EAX register when switching to and from
  protected mode on an 80386 or 80486 CPU.  There were no bugs in
  PKZIP/PKUNZIP 1.02 regarding usage of the 80386 instructions or
  registers.  However, PKZIP/PKUNZIP 1.02 did not expect that the
  EAX register would be wantonly corrupted from one instruction
  to the next.  PKZIP/PKUNZIP 1.1 do expect that other programs
  may randomly destroy the EAX register, and defends against
  this.  PKZIP/PKUNZIP 1.1 treat all references to EAX as a
  critical section, briefly disallowing programs from
  interrupting PKZIP/PKUNZIP when the EAX register is used.

  If it sounds ludicrous that a program would need to protect
  access to a CPU register like this, particularly the
  accumulator, that's because it is!  Considering that 80386
  computers have commonly been available for over two years now,
  it is unfortunate that many '80286 specific' programs don't
  have any consideration that they could be running on an 80386
  or 80486 CPU.  It takes approximately 30 bytes of code for a
  program to determine if it is running on an 80286 CPU versus an
  80386/80486 CPU, and two instructions (namely PUSH EAX and POP
  EAX) to save and restore the EAX register.  Any program that
  uses exTENded memory or 80286 protected mode has little excuse
  not to save and restore EAX when running on an 80386 or 80486
  CPU, especially if they are going to interrupt the currently
  executing program!  Programs that are negligent of this will
  only cause additional problems in the future as more software
  is developed to take advantage of the 80386 and 80486
  instruction sets and 32-bit registers.

                                 ALPHA 1.93

Due to the extensive changes in PKZIP including the incorporation of our
new data compression technology, this ALPHA version is being made
available for a wide-spread test.  PLEASE be aware that this is NOT
final software, and must be treated as such.  It is EXTREMELY LIKELY
that files created with this version of PKZIP will NOT be compatible
with future/final releases of the product.  Therefore, do NOT use this
program to archive any data which cannot be replaced easily.  BBS SysOps
SHOULD NOT convert their archives to this release of PKZIP.  Although it
is true that significant space savings can be realized on all BBS's by
converting to the new compression, PLEASE wait until the final version
is available to ensure compatibility with your users and other BBS's.

This generation of PKZIP offers the following significant improvements
over previous releases:

1)  ALL NEW COMPRESSION ALGORITHM.  This new process allows PKZIP to
    compress data TIGHTER and FASTER.  In fact, the new FAST method gets
    more compression than the maximum compression in PKZIP 1.10, yet is
    almost as fast as Shrinking!

2)  MULTI-VOLUME ARCHIVES.  PKZIP can now create and extract ZIP files
    which cross more than one disk.  This is not functional in this
    Alpha 1.93 version.

3)  EMS SUPPORT.  When sufficient EMS is available PKZIP now requires
    only 85K of conventional memory to run.  Without EMS PKZIP requires
    183K.  PKUNZIP requires approximately 75K if EMS is present and
    approximately 81K without EMS.

=================
NEW PKZIP OPTIONS
=================
Brackets [] are used in command option descriptions only to indicate the
position of optional or required switches and are NEVER typed as part of
a command.

****
Compression Type
-e[s/n/x]

Specifying this parameter allows you to select the compression type you
desire.  (s) specifies the FAST compression algorithm, (x) specifies the
EXTRA compression algorithm.  (n) specifies the NORMAL (default)
compression type and is provided to override the configuration file in
future revisions.

Examples:

        pkzip -es test.zip *.doc
        pkzip -ex test2.zip *.gif

****
Date Specifier
-t[mmyydd]    (files on or AFTER this date)
-T[mmyydd]    (files BEFORE this date)

With this option, you can specify a date so that only files with a date
that is equal to or more recent/older will be included in the PKZIP
operation.  These options MAY be combined, but take care not to have
them overlap or you will exclude all files!

Examples:

        pkzip -ex -m -T010191 oldstuff *.wk1

        This example would compress all files matching the file
        specification *.wk1 and created before January 1st, 1991, and
        place them into the ZIP file called 'oldstuff.zip'.  This
        example is also using the EXTRA compression option and MOVING
        the files (deleting them after they are compressed).

        pkzip -t110191 catalog catalog.*

        This example would compress all files matching the file
        specification catalog.* (i.e. all files names catalog,
        regardless of extension) and created on or after November
        1st, 1991, and copy them into a ZIP files called 'catalog.zip'.

****
Create Multi-Volume Archives
-&amp;

This feature is not functional in this ALPHA 1.93 version, but will be
in the final release of the product.

When this option is specified, and a ZIP file is being created on a
REMOVABLE DOS media device, PKZIP has permission to create a ZIP file
that is larger than that single media.  When a ZIP file reaches the
point where it would exceed the capacity of the storage device, the user
is prompted to insert another one.  In the case of standard floppy disks
(360K/720K/1.2M/1.44M) these disks may be formatted on-the-fly, that is,
if an un-formatted disk is inserted it will be formatted before PKZIP
continues to write the archive.

****
Open files in compatibility mode
-=

When this option is specified, PKZIP will open files for archiving in
compatibility mode, as opposed to 'sharing' mode.  On some systems this
will bypass any network sharing and allow PKZIP to read files opened by
other programs or applications.

****
Disable EMS usage
-+

If you experience strange behavior when testing PKZIP, try using this
option. When this option is on PKZIP will use only conventional memory.
Use of this switch may reveal problems or incompatibilities with your
EMS driver.  Please report these occurances.

===================
NEW PKUNZIP OPTIONS
===================
Brackets [] are used in command option descriptions only to indicate the
position of optional or required switches and are NEVER typed as part of
a command.

****
Command line options for PKUNZIP may now be combined!  This was possible
with previous versions of PKZIP but never before with PKUNZIP.  For
example in the past if you wanted to extract a ZIP file while restoring
directory paths AND overwrite any previously existing files by the same
name you needed to give the command with separate -d -o options, you may
now combine them as the single option -do.

Please note: As with PKZIP, you still MUST separate options which take
additional parameters themselves, such as -e (extract files in
designated order).  The -ed option is the extract files in order of file
date, thus if you had planned it to also restore directories it would
not be interpreted in that fashion.

****
Exclude Files
-xfilename
-x@exclude.lst

PKZIP allows you to create plain ASCII text files containing file names
that you wish to compress, or exclude from an operation.  Now with this
option you may specify a list of files to EXCLUDE from an unzip
operation, or a particular file.

Example:

        pkunzip testfile.zip -xmanual.txt

        This example would extract the files contained in the archive
        'testfile.zip' but not the file 'manual.txt'

        pkunzip -d a:project2.zip -x@nowant.lst

        This example would extract the files contained in the archive
        'project2.zip' (which incidentally is located on the a: drive
        and is having it's directory structure restored via the -d
        option and the a: being added to the file name).  The files
        contained in the list file 'nowant.lst' would NOT be extracted
        from this archive.

****
Disable EMS usage
-+

If you experience strange behavior when testing PKUNZIP, try this
option. When this option is on PKUNZIP will use only conventional
memory.  Use of this switch may reveal problems or incompatibilities
with your EMS driver.  Please report these occurances.

****
New Overwrite Option
(automatic)

Past versions of PKUNZIP, when encountering a file it was extracting
that already existed, would prompt you as to whether or not you wished
to overwrite the existing file.  This question could only be answered in
a yes or no manner.

Starting with this revision, PKUNZIP will now prompt you with:

File already exists overwrite (y/n/a/r)?

The four possible responses to this question are:

Y - Yes, overwrite the existing file with the version that is contained
    in the archive.

N - No, leave the existing file alone and skip to the next file.

A - All, overwrite the existing file, and do so for any others that are
    run across as well.  This is useful if you forget to specify -o when
    you give the original PKUNZIP command.

R - Rename it!  This will prompt you for a new name of the file and then
    extract the file in the archive to this new name.  This is very
    useful when extracting downloads from BBS systems, which frequently
    contain files such as 'readme.doc' or 'manual.doc' in many different
    files.

        PKZIP/PKUNZIP 2.04c implements a new compression algorithm
        called Deflating.  Deflating has varying levels of compression
        and speed available.  Both speed and compression are greatly
        improved over previous versions of PKZIP.

-Multi-Volume Archive Support/Formatting

        PKZIP/PKUNZIP 2.04c has the ability to "span" a .ZIP file across
        multiple diskettes if the final .ZIP file size would be greater
        than a single diskette.  PKZIP 2.04c also has the ability to
        format the destination diskettes on the fly.

-XMS/EMS Usage

        PKZIP/PKUNZIP 2.04c has the ability to use of EMS, UMB, and HMA
        memory, which will allow the ability to process more files or be
        able to run with less conventional memory.  PKZIP/PKUNZIP 2.04
        will run in as little as 85K of conventional memory if EMS or
        XMS memory is available.

-Novell Network Aware

        PKZIP 2.04c is Novell Netware "aware".  Updating or creating
        a .ZIP file on a network drive is much faster with the network
        support in PKZIP 2.04c.

-Auto CPU type detection.
        
        PKZIP/PKUNZIP 2.04c will detect what type of CPU it is being run
        on and will use instructions specifcally optimized for an 808x
        CPU, 80386 CPU, or 80486 CPU.

-DPMI support
        
        PKZIP/PKUNZIP 2.04c automatically detects if DPMI (DOS Protected
        Mode Interface) support is available and will execute code in
        32-bit protected mode for better speed.

-PKCFG program

        PKZIP 2.04c can be configured to best suit your needs through
        the use of the PKCFG program.  This is only available in the
        registered version of PKZIP.

-PKSFX Junior and PKUNZIP Junior

        These "Junior" programs use very little memory and are extremely
        small.  Although they are reduced in ability, their small size
        makes them very useful.

-Password Encryption

        Sensitive data files can be scrambled with password protection.
        The security of this feature has been significantly improved in
        PKZIP/PKUNZIP 2.04c.

-Authenticy Verification

        Users requiring authentication of archive files may request an
        Authenticy Verification code.  This allows users to create .ZIP
        files which PKUNZIP can detect tampering of.

If you use PKZIP on a regular basis you are strongly encouraged to register
it.  With a full registration of US $47.00 you will receive a comprehensive
printed manual, the latest version of PKZIP, PKUNZIP &amp; PKSFX software, and
when available, the next version of the software.  See the documentation for
commercial and distribution licensing info.  Send check or money order to:
                PKWARE, Inc.
                9025 N. Deerwood Drive
                Brown Deer, WI 53223

A:\&gt;TYPE V204E.NEW

The following changes have been made in version 2.04e of
PKZIP/PKUNZIP from version 2.04c.

1) DPMI.

     The DPMI support in PKZIP/PKUNZIP has been changed to work
     around bugs and anomolies with the following DPMI drivers or
     environments.  PKWARE would like to thank Quarterdeck Office
     Systems and Qualitas, Inc. for their technical assistance
     regarding DPMI.

    a) PC-KWIK

      According to PC-KWIK corporation's document, 'PC-KWIK
      Technical Issues "Summer '92"':

        PC-KWIK is unable to recognize memory requests from programs
        using VCPI or DPMI protocols ... For programs [that use VCPI
        or DPMI] it is necessary to reduce the size of the cache and
        disable lending.

      PC-KWIK has a lending feature that allows memory to loaned
      from the cache memory to applications.  However, PC-KWIK is
      not aware of any memory allocated or used by DPMI, and will
      loan this memory as well, possibly causing corruption of the
      DPMI driver and usually resulting in a system crash or reboot.

      This problem seems to present in most versions of SUPERPCK,
      through version 5.01.

      In other words, when using PC-KWIK with any program that uses DPMI,
      including PKZIP and PKUNZIP, you should either make sure that you
      have enough memory in your computer so that lending will not occur,
      reduce the size of your cache, or disable PC-KWIK's lending.

      Therefore, PKZIP/PKUNZIP detect for the presence of PC-KWIK
      and default DPMI to DISABLE when PC-KWIK is installed.  This
      can be overidden by specifying -)+ on the PKZIP or PKUNZIP
      command line, or by placing DPMI=ENABLE in your PKZIP.CFG for
      PKZIP or setting the environment variable PKUNZIP=-)+ for PKUNZIP.

  b) QDPMI 1.00

      If a program tries to use DPMI and EMS memory with QDPMI 1.00,
      QDPMI would become unstable or crash.  PKZIP/PKUNZIP now
      check for the presence of QDPMI 1.00 and if PKZIP/PKUNZIP
      are using EMS memory, they do not attempt to use DPMI at all.

  c) QDPMI 1.01

      When a program switches to protected mode, QDPMI does not
      'synchronize' the EMS page frame.  The result is that programs
      can not correctly read or write any data in the EMS page frame
      while in proteced mode.  PKZIP/PKUNZIP now check for the presence
      of QDPMI 1.01 and will use slower real-mode code for any
      manipulation of data in the EMS page frame rather than faster
      protected mode code.

  d) OS/2 2.0 DOS BOX

      The OS/2 2.0 DOS box does not allow programs to allocate the
      'DPMI private data area' in an UMB.  Doing so causes a system
      violation error.  PKZIP/PKUNZIP now check to see if they are
      running in the OS/2 2.0 DOS box and will not allocate the DPMI
      private data area in an UMB.  (This is actually kind of a shame,
      as the OS/2 DOS box (unlike the Windows DOS box) provides UMB
      memory to DOS applications.  It should be able to allow programs
      to store the DPMI data area in these UMB's.)

  e) Windows 3.0 DOS BOX

      The DPMI support in the Windows 3.0 DOS box does not always
      seem to work correctly.  Therefore, PKZIP/PKUNZIP detect if
      they are running in the Windows 3.0 DOS box and will not support
      DPMI in this environment.

  f) Windows 3.1 DOS BOX

      The way PKZIP/PKUNZIP allocates the DPMI save/restore state
      buffer has been changed to be more compatible with Windows 3.1.

2)  The Norton AntiVirus program FALSELY reported that PKZIPFIX and
    PKUNZIP contained the Maltese Ameoba virus.  The software DID
    NOT contain this virus.  All files in this release have been
    modified so as to not trigger any FALSE virus reports by the
    Norton AntiVirus program.

3)  QEMM versions 5.1x would corrupt the high word of the 32-bit
    registers on an 80386 or 80486 CPU.  PKZIP/PKUNZIP check for
    this condition, and will not use 32-bit instructions if QEMM
    version 5.1x is present.

4)  Apparently some peer-to-peer networks such as Novell Netware Lite
    and others do not support canonical or fully specified filename.
    PKZIP now uses noncanonical filenames when specifying temporary
    filenames on a network drive to avoid this problem.

5)  PKZIP would erroneously report "E28 Destination is same as temp
    directory" when creating a new .zip file on drive A:.  This has
    been fixed.

6)  The keywords on/enable and off/disable are now synonymous when
    used in the PKZIP configuration file.

7)  Using EMS= options in the PKZIP configuration file would enable
    or disable both EMS and XMS usage.  The XMS= option had no effect.
    This has been corrected.

8)  The Quick format option in PKZIP would zero out the existing FAT
    on the disk (by design).  However, if the disk had any bad
    sectors on it (in which case, it isn't a good idea to use that
    disk as a backup disk anyway...) they would now be marked as
    good.  By popular demand, PKZIP now reads the existing FAT and
    leaves any bad sectors marked as bad.  This however, makes the
    'Quick' format function about twice as slow as it was (although
    still much faster than an unconditional format).  In most cases
    however, unless there are several subdirectories on the diskette,
    the -&amp;w (wipe) option is faster than the -&amp;f (format) option when
    backing up to pre-formatted diskettes.

9)  Under some cirumstances, PKZIP could possibly store the last
    file in a multi-disk backup set incorrectly.  This has been
    corrected.

10) The volume label option in PKZIP would not work.  This has been
    fixed.

11) PKZIP/PKUNZIP now searches for a PKNOFASTCHAR variable in the
    DOS environment.  If this variable is present, PKZIP/PKUNZIP
    will use the slower DOS 1.x/2.x character output functions
    rather than the 'DOS Fast Character Output' function.  This is
    provided for compatability with some TSR's, BBS Doors and mail
    readers etc., that redirect or capture the output of programs and
    do not support the DOS Fast Character Output function.

12) PKZIP will now accept either MAXIMUM or MAXIMAL in the
    configuration file.

13) Some people have requested that the -&amp; backup option support the
    DOS verify function.  Specifying -&amp;v on the PKZIP command line
    or BACKUP=VERIFY in the PKZIP.CFG file will turn on the DOS
    verify flag when writing to the backup disk(s).  This makes
    PKZIP run slower, but ensures better integrity of each diskette.

14) Using the -m option with -rp in PKZIP will delete any empty
    subdirectories that have been saved in the .ZIP file after all
    the files have been moved into the .ZIP file.  Some people have
    requested a way to have PKZIP leave these empty subdirectories
    behind.  This can be accomplished by using -m- on the PKZIP
    command line.

15) It appears that some versions of NoGate's PAK program would
    place incorrect information in the .ZIP file directories that it
    created.  Specifically, the disk number information for where
    files, the central directory, and the central end directory
    started is inconsistent, causing PKUNZIP to think it was
    extracting a multi-disk .ZIP file when it really wasn't.
    PKUNZIP now checks for this condition, and ignores this
    erroneous information.

16) PKZIP now ignores any ZIPDATE= or -o or -k options when creating
    multi-disk .ZIP files, rather than displaying the help screens.

17) On some 80386 machines running PKZIP could leave allocated UMB's
    behind.  This has been corrected.

18) In some circumstances, running PKZIP with EMS memory and very low
    free conventional memory could cause corruption of the .ZIP file.
    This has been corrected.

19) When PKZIP prompts for an encryption password, it will now ask the
    user to enter the password twice for verification.

20) PKZIP/PKUNZIP would not work under DOS 2.x.  This is because
    DOS 2.x crashes on many int 2Fh installation check calls for
    EMS/XMS drivers etc.  These calls work properly under DOS 3.0
    or above.  Therefore, PKZIP/PKUNZIP detect for the presence
    of DOS 2.x, and will not support any of the advanced features
    including 32-bit instructions, EMS memory, XMS memory, DPMI
    support and Netware usage.

21) PKSFX could in some instances erroneously report failed AV's or
    garble any AVEXTRA text present.  This has been fixed.

22) Using PKZIP with the -o option or ZIPDATE=LATEST in the configuration
    file would set the date of the .ZIP file to the latest dated file
    or directory.  Directory dates are now ignored in this version.

A:\&gt;TYPE V204G.NEW

Please note that the only program that has functionally changed
from version 2.04e to 2.04g is PKZIP.EXE, PKUNZIP.EXE and PKCFG.EXE.
The other programs in this release have been changed to read version
2.04g for consistency.  However, no functional changes have been made
to them.


The following changes have been made in version 2.04g of PKZIP.EXE
from version 2.04e.

1)  PKZIP's Quick format in an over-zealous effort to leave bad
    sectors marked as bad, could in some instances leave unallocated
    sectors (orphaned clusters) on the diskette.  This has been fixed.


The following changes have been made in version 2.04g of PKZIP.EXE
from version 2.04c/2.04e.

1)  Using the BACKUP= option in the PKZIP.CFG file would automatically
    turn on the SPAN option and cause PKZIP to generate a E27 or E28
    error, or display the help screen when creating a .ZIP file
    on non-removable media.  This has been corrected.

2)  When Norton Utilities creates a volume label on a diskette, it 
    stores trailing nulls rather than trailing spaces after the volume 
    name, as DOS does (and expects).  A volume label created by NU can 
    not be changed by even the LABEL command in DOS.  PKZIP uses the 
    volume label when creating multi-disk .ZIP files, and could not 
    change any volume label created by NU.  PKZIP has been modified to 
    be able to deal with and change volume labels created by NU.  
    PKUNZIP -$ was also unable to restore volume labels over NU created 
    labels.  PKUNZIP has been modified to deal with NU volume labels as 
    well.


The following changes have been made in version 2.04e of
PKZIP/PKUNZIP from version 2.04c.

1) DPMI.

     The DPMI support in PKZIP/PKUNZIP has been changed to work
     around bugs and anomolies with the following DPMI drivers or
     environments.  PKWARE would like to thank Quarterdeck Office
     Systems and Qualitas, Inc. for their technical assistance
     regarding DPMI.

    a) PC-KWIK

      According to PC-KWIK corporation's document, 'PC-KWIK
      Technical Issues "Summer '92"':

        PC-KWIK is unable to recognize memory requests from programs
        using VCPI or DPMI protocols ... For programs [that use VCPI
        or DPMI] it is necessary to reduce the size of the cache and
        disable lending.

      PC-KWIK has a lending feature that allows memory to be loaned
      from the cache memory to applications.  However, PC-KWIK is
      not aware of any memory allocated or used by DPMI, and will
      loan this memory as well, possibly causing corruption of the
      DPMI driver and usually resulting in a system crash or reboot.

      PKWARE has tested several versions of SUPERPCK, through version
      5.01 and running PKZIP (as well as several commercial programs
      that use DPMI) consistently causes a system reboot or some kind
      of protected mode error such as a page fault.  PC-KWIK Corporation
      is aware of this problem, and is trying to correct it.

      In other words, when using PC-KWIK with any program that uses DPMI,
      including PKZIP and PKUNZIP, you should either make sure that you
      have enough memory in your computer so that lending will not occur,
      reduce the size of your cache, or disable PC-KWIK's lending.

      Therefore, PKZIP/PKUNZIP detect for the presence of PC-KWIK
      and default DPMI to DISABLE when PC-KWIK is installed.  This
      can be overidden by specifying -)+ on the PKZIP or PKUNZIP
      command line, or by placing DPMI=ENABLE in your PKZIP.CFG for
      PKZIP or setting the environment variable PKUNZIP=-)+ for PKUNZIP.

  b) QDPMI 1.00

      If a program tries to use DPMI and EMS memory with QDPMI 1.00,
      QDPMI would become unstable or crash.  PKZIP/PKUNZIP now
      check for the presence of QDPMI 1.00 and if PKZIP/PKUNZIP
      are using EMS memory, they do not attempt to use DPMI at all.

  c) QDPMI 1.01

      When a program switches to protected mode, QDPMI does not
      'synchronize' the EMS page frame.  The result is that programs
      can not correctly read or write any data in the EMS page frame
      while in proteced mode.  PKZIP/PKUNZIP now check for the presence
      of QDPMI 1.01 and will use slower real-mode code for any
      manipulation of data in the EMS page frame rather than faster
      protected mode code.

  d) OS/2 2.0 DOS BOX

      The OS/2 2.0 DOS box does not allow programs to allocate the
      'DPMI private data area' in an UMB.  Doing so causes a system
      violation error.  PKZIP/PKUNZIP now check to see if they are
      running in the OS/2 2.0 DOS box and will not allocate the DPMI
      private data area in an UMB.  (This is actually kind of a shame,
      as the OS/2 DOS box (unlike the Windows DOS box) provides UMB
      memory to DOS applications.  It should be able to allow programs
      to store the DPMI data area in these UMB's.)

  e) Windows 3.0 DOS BOX

      The DPMI support in the Windows 3.0 DOS box does not always
      seem to work correctly.  Therefore, PKZIP/PKUNZIP detect if
      they are running in the Windows 3.0 DOS box and will not support
      DPMI in this environment.

  f) Windows 3.1 DOS BOX

      The way PKZIP/PKUNZIP allocates the DPMI save/restore state
      buffer has been changed to be more compatible with Windows 3.1.

2)  The Norton AntiVirus program FALSELY reported that PKZIPFIX and
    PKUNZIP contained the Maltese Ameoba virus.  The software DID
    NOT contain this virus.  All files in this release have been
    modified so as to not trigger any FALSE virus reports by the
    Norton AntiVirus program.

3)  QEMM versions 5.1x would corrupt the high word of the 32-bit
    registers on an 80386 or 80486 CPU.  PKZIP/PKUNZIP check for
    this condition, and will not use 32-bit instructions if QEMM
    version 5.1x is present.

4)  Apparently some peer-to-peer networks such as Novell Netware Lite
    and others do not support canonical or fully specified filename.
    PKZIP now uses noncanonical filenames when specifying temporary
    filenames on a network drive to avoid this problem.

5)  PKZIP would erroneously report "E28 Destination is same as temp
    directory" when creating a new .zip file on drive A:.  This has
    been fixed.

6)  The keywords on/enable and off/disable are now synonymous when
    used in the PKZIP configuration file.

7)  Using EMS= options in the PKZIP configuration file would enable
    or disable both EMS and XMS usage.  The XMS= option had no effect.
    This has been corrected.

8)  The Quick format option in PKZIP would zero out the existing FAT
    on the disk (by design).  However, if the disk had any bad
    sectors on it (in which case, it isn't a good idea to use that
    disk as a backup disk anyway...) they would now be marked as
    good.  By popular demand, PKZIP now reads the existing FAT and
    leaves any bad sectors marked as bad.  This however, makes the
    'Quick' format function about twice as slow as it was (although
    still much faster than an unconditional format).  In most cases
    however, unless there are several subdirectories on the diskette,
    the -&amp;w (wipe) option is faster than the -&amp;f (format) option when
    backing up to pre-formatted diskettes.

9)  Under some cirumstances, PKZIP could possibly store the last
    file in a multi-disk backup set incorrectly.  This has been
    corrected.

10) The volume label option in PKZIP would not work.  This has been
    fixed.

11) PKZIP/PKUNZIP now searches for a PKNOFASTCHAR variable in the
    DOS environment.  If this variable is present, PKZIP/PKUNZIP
    will use the slower DOS 1.x/2.x character output functions
    rather than the 'DOS Fast Character Output' function.  This is
    provided for compatability with some TSR's, BBS Doors and mail
    readers etc., that redirect or capture the output of programs and
    do not support the DOS Fast Character Output function.

12) PKZIP will now accept either MAXIMUM or MAXIMAL in the
    configuration file.

13) Some people have requested that the -&amp; backup option support the
    DOS verify function.  Specifying -&amp;v on the PKZIP command line
    or BACKUP=VERIFY in the PKZIP.CFG file will turn on the DOS
    verify flag when writing to the backup disk(s).  This makes
    PKZIP run slower, but ensures better integrity of each diskette.

14) Using the -m option with -rp in PKZIP will delete any empty
    subdirectories that have been saved in the .ZIP file after all
    the files have been moved into the .ZIP file.  Some people have
    requested a way to have PKZIP leave these empty subdirectories
    behind.  This can be accomplished by using -m- on the PKZIP
    command line.

15) It appears that some versions of NoGate's PAK program would
    place incorrect information in the .ZIP file directories that it
    created.  Specifically, the disk number information for where
    files, the central directory, and the central end directory
    started is inconsistent, causing PKUNZIP to think it was
    extracting a multi-disk .ZIP file when it really wasn't.
    PKUNZIP now checks for this condition, and ignores this
    erroneous information.

16) PKZIP now ignores any ZIPDATE= or -o or -k options when creating
    multi-disk .ZIP files, rather than displaying the help screens.

17) On some 80386 machines running PKZIP could leave allocated UMB's
    behind.  This has been corrected.

18) In some circumstances, running PKZIP with EMS memory and very low
    free conventional memory could cause corruption of the .ZIP file.
    This has been corrected.

19) When PKZIP prompts for an encryption password, it will now ask the
    user to enter the password twice for verification.

20) PKZIP/PKUNZIP would not work under DOS 2.x.  This is because
    DOS 2.x crashes on many int 2Fh installation check calls for
    EMS/XMS drivers etc.  These calls work properly under DOS 3.0
    or above.  Therefore, PKZIP/PKUNZIP detect for the presence
    of DOS 2.x, and will not support any of the advanced features
    including 32-bit instructions, EMS memory, XMS memory, DPMI
    support and Netware usage.

21) PKSFX could in some instances erroneously report failed AV's or
    garble any AVEXTRA text present.  This has been fixed.

22) Using PKZIP with the -o option or ZIPDATE=LATEST in the configuration
    file would set the date of the .ZIP file to the latest dated file
    or directory.  Directory dates are now ignored in this version.

## My first year as a software engineering manager, pt. 1

date: 2025-04-05, from: Matthew Lincoln Blog

<p>Well it‚Äôs been over a year since taking on <a href="/2024/01/27/managing">managing the engineering team at JSTOR Labs</a> and I haven‚Äôt exactly been posting prolifically on here‚Ä¶
I think I am just better at knowing how much I don‚Äôt know now, compared to when I began this blog.
I also feel as though I haven‚Äôt had a lot original to say that hasn‚Äôt been said elsewhere, better.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs high time I get this out of my drafts branch, where it‚Äôs been stewing for almost 5 months now:
In no particular order, here‚Äôs some things that have been taking up my mind space since 2024:</p>

<h2 id="explicit-over-implicit">Explicit over implicit</h2>

<p>Software developers often talk about the benefits of being explicit vs. implicit.
This applies a lot in management work, too.</p>

<p>A small thing I pushed for early this year was making our professional development funding process as transparent as possible to the whole Labs team.
We‚Äôd always had a budget for folks for everything from buying books to paying for workshops and classes, and certifications, up to and including tuition towards a degree.
Whether you were an engineer, a designer, or a product owner, all you had to do was ask your manager.
<em>But you had to know to ask!</em>
And it was never spelled out what the range of options was, nor what decisionmaking amongst leadership was about how fund bigger ticket requests like a multi-week training across the many folks in our team - something we can gladly fund, but not for every single person each year.
So we made sure to write it down in a shared document: every single person gets a modest amount earmarked annually for educational materials, no questions asked.
For things exceeding that amount, we asked team members to let us know their requests by late January to get priority consideration.</p>

<p>A more difficult adjustment I am still working on making is dealing with the changed nature of my technical advice and suggestions in my new role.
I am trying to be more disciplined about being <em>explicit</em> when I am suggesting a task or story as something for one of our team to consider, and to be equally explicit when I am instructing the team to add a task to their sprint or move it forward in the priority list.
It‚Äôs important I be able to do both, and to communicate the difference.
For what it‚Äôs worth, the latter directives are quite rare!</p>

<h2 id="prioritize-lower-priority-but-high-importance-code">Prioritize lower priority but high importance code</h2>

<p>Because I now get pulled in a lot of different directions in any given day, I need to keep myself <em>off</em> the critical path for hour-to-hour commits that need to happen on our projects.
This means I avoid picking up too many application-feature tickets in our sprints.
The devs on those teams will <em>always</em> be able to work those out faster, and with much better context, than I will.</p>

<p>What I focus on instead is building out or refactoring parts of our codebases that tend to share patterns across our projects: runtime configuration; CICD improvements; logging; dependency upgrades; and the like.</p>

<p>A big part of this has been building out more monitoring - getting our applications to send us better data about how healthy they are, creating dashboards our devs can eyeball to look for behavior patterns,
as well as push alerts when our services start showing unusual behavior.
It has also meant gradually aligning our bouquet of different technical experiments into greater alignment with technologies and patterns the rest of ITHAKA‚Äôs technology organization is familiar with.</p>

<h2 id="developers-have-user-stories-too">Developers have user stories too</h2>

<p>The engineering teams on our projects are quite small.
Our very largest has only just grown to three software engineers; our smallest is supported currently by just one.
We build on the shoulders of ITHAKA‚Äôs software deployment platform that supports all of JSTOR, however.
Therefore we don‚Äôt have to invent our own Kubernetes support, routing, CDNs, autoscaling, logging, monitoring, or networking from scratch.
We get to lean on shared infrastructure teams, and we‚Äôve been learning how to work better with them this past year.</p>

<p>Specifically, we‚Äôve been intentionally working to frame all our asks to the core infrastructure and deployment teams in the form of <em>user stories</em>.
Developers are used to user stories, usually phrased like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a USER ROLE, I want to be able to DO SOME FUNCTION so that I can accomplish SOME OBJECTIVE</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By phrasing it so, teams can capture what kind of user is asking for this, and what the broader context of that feature will be in their workflow, without prescribing <em>how</em> developers will implement that feature.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs easy to forget this when we‚Äôre trying to ask our infrastructure teams for advice.</p>

<p>I might say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How do I create a ConfigMap instance on our Kubernetes cluster from a value that I‚Äôve written in to s3?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And our infra team, used to some very heterogeneous tech stacks at ITHAKA, would gamely start trying to work out how best enable that, no matter that it might be an unnecessarily complicated solution to my real underlying need.
Whereas, if I‚Äôd asked:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a developer on X service, I want my application to read a configuration value from a centrally-managed location on startup so that I can configure every instance to have the correct database host and password.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By not overspecifying an implementation, our infra teams could then come back with advice on the most well-supported golden path for that need, before accidentally adding in requirements we don‚Äôt actually have.</p>

<hr />

<p>In a follow up to this post, I‚Äôll discuss harder things that happened over this first year: sunsetting several of our projects.</p>

<p>This is priced at around the same level as Gemini 1.5 Pro ($1.25/$5 for input/output below 128,000 tokens, $2.50/$10 above 128,000 tokens), is cheaper than GPT-4o for shorter prompts ($2.50/$10) and is cheaper than Claude 3.7 Sonnet ($3/$15).</p>
<p>Gemini 2.5 Pro is a reasoning model, and invisible reasoning tokens are included in the output token count. I just tried prompting "hi" and it charged me 2 tokens for input and 623 for output, of which 613 were "thinking" tokens. That still adds up to just 0.6232 cents (less than a cent) using my <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/llm-prices">LLM pricing calculator</a> which I updated to support the new model just now.</p>
<p>I released <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-gemini/releases/tag/0.17">llm-gemini 0.17</a> this morning adding support for the new model:</p>
<pre><code>llm install -U llm-gemini
llm -m gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25 hi
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the model continues to be available for free under the previous <code>gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25</code> model ID:</p>
<pre><code>llm -m gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25 hi
</code></pre>
<p>The free tier is "used to improve our products", the paid tier is not.</p>
<p>Rate limits for the paid model <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/rate-limits#tier-1">vary by tier</a> - from 150/minute and 1,000/day for tier 1 (billing configured), 1,000/minute and 50,000/day for Tier 2 ($250 total spend) and 2,000/minute and unlimited/day for Tier 3 ($1,000 total spend). Meanwhile the free tier continues to limit you to 5 requests per minute and 25 per day.</p>
<p>Google are <a href="https://twitter.com/OfficialLoganK/status/1908179750536827183">retiring the Gemini 2.0 Pro preview</a> entirely in favour of 2.5.

## A Sneaky Phish Just Grabbed my Mailchimp Mailing List

date: 2025-04-04, updated: 2025-04-04, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/a-sneaky-phish-just-grabbed-my-mailchimp-mailing-list/">A Sneaky Phish Just Grabbed my Mailchimp Mailing List</a></strong></p>
In further evidence that phishing attacks can catch out the <em>most</em> sophisticated among us, security researcher (and operator of <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">';--have i been pwned?</a>) Troy Hunt reports on how he fell for an extremely well crafted phishing attack against his MailChimp account which then exported his full list of subscribers, including people who had unsubscribed (data which MailChimp stores and continues to make available).</p>
<p>This could happen to any of us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've received a gazillion similar phishes before that I've identified early, so what was different about this one? Tiredness, was a major factor. I wasn't alert enough, and I didn't properly think through what I was doing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Troy's account was protected by authenticator app 2FA, but the phishing site (on the realistic sounding <code>mailchimp-sso.com</code> domain) asked for that code too and instantly proxied it through to MailChimp - somewhat ironic as Troy had been promoting phishing-resistant passkeys on his trip to London, a technology that MailChimp doesn't offer yet.</p>
<p>There are a bunch of interesting details here. I appreciated this point about how short-lived authentication sessions can <em>reduce</em> account security by conditioning users to expect constant login requests:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I also realised another factor that pre-conditioned me to enter credentials into what I thought was Mailchimp is their very short-lived authentication sessions. Every time I go back to the site, I need to re-authenticate and whilst the blame still clearly lies with me, I'm used to logging back in on every visit. Keeping a trusted device auth'd for a longer period would likely have raised a flag on my return to the site if I wasn't still logged in.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It looks like MailChimp preserve the email addresses of unsubscribed users to prevent them from being re-subscribed by future list imports. Troy discusses this issue at length in further updates to the post.</p>
<p>Also interesting: this <a href="https://www.validin.com/blog/pulling_threads_on_phishing_campaign/">article by DNS forensics company Validin</a> which tracks down the responsible group using DNS records and other hints such as title tags and favicon hashes.

## First look at the modern attr()

date: 2025-04-03, updated: 2025-04-03, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://ishadeed.com/article/modern-attr/">First look at the modern attr()</a></strong></p>
Chrome 133 (released February 25th 2025) was the first browser to <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/release-notes/133?hl=en#css_advanced_attr_function">ship support</a> for the advanced CSS <code>attr()</code> function (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/attr">MDN</a>), which lets <code>attr()</code> be used to compose values using types other than strings.</p>
<p>Ahmad Shadeed explores potential applications of this in detail, trying it out for CSS grid columns, progress bars, background images, animation delays and more.</p>
<p>I like this example that uses the <code>rows="5"</code> attribute on a <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code> to calculate its <code>max-height</code> - here wrapped in a feature detection block:</p>
<pre><span class="pl-k">@supports</span> (<span class="pl-c1">x</span><span class="pl-kos">:</span> <span class="pl-en">attr</span>(x <span class="pl-en">type</span>(<span class="pl-c1">*</span>))) {
  <span class="pl-ent">textarea</span> {
    <span class="pl-c1">min-height</span><span class="pl-kos">:</span> <span class="pl-en">calc</span>(
      <span class="pl-en">attr</span>(rows <span class="pl-en">type</span>(&lt;number<span class="pl-c1">&gt;</span>)) <span class="pl-c1">*</span> <span class="pl-c1">50<span class="pl-smi">px</span></span>
    );
  }
}</pre>

<p>That <code>type(&lt;number&gt;)</code> is the new syntax.</p>
<p>Many of Ahmad's examples can be achieved today across all browsers using a slightly more verbose CSS custom property syntax.</p>
<p>Here are the tracking issues for CSS values support in <code>attr()</code> for <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=435426">Firefox</a> (opened 17 years ago) and <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=26609">WebKit</a> (16 years ago).

## Minimal CSS-only blurry image placeholders

date: 2025-04-03, updated: 2025-04-03, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://leanrada.com/notes/css-only-lqip/">Minimal CSS-only blurry image placeholders</a></strong></p>
Absolutely brilliant piece of CSS ingenuity by Lean Rada, who describes a way to implement blurry placeholder images using just CSS, with syntax like this:</p>
<pre><span class="pl-kos">&lt;</span><span class="pl-ent">img</span> <span class="pl-c1">src</span>="<span class="pl-s">‚Ä¶</span>" <span class="pl-c1">style</span>="<span class="pl-s">--lqip:192900</span>"<span class="pl-kos">&gt;</span></pre>

<p>That 192900 number encodes everything needed to construct the placeholder - it manages to embed a single base color and six brightness components (in a 3x2 grid) in 20 bits, then encodes those as an integer in the roughly 2 million available values between -999,999 and 999,999 - beyond which range Lean found some browsers would start to lose precision.</p>
<p>The implementation for decoding that value becomes a bunch of clever bit-fiddling CSS expressions to expand it into further CSS variables:</p>
<pre>[<span class="pl-c1">style</span><span class="pl-c1">*=</span><span class="pl-s">"--lqip:"</span>] {
  <span class="pl-s1">--lqip-ca</span><span class="pl-kos">:</span> <span class="pl-en">mod</span>(<span class="pl-en">round</span>(down<span class="pl-kos">,</span> <span class="pl-en">calc</span>((<span class="pl-en">var</span>(<span class="pl-s1">--lqip</span>) <span class="pl-c1">+</span> <span class="pl-en">pow</span>(<span class="pl-c1">2</span><span class="pl-kos">,</span> <span class="pl-c1">19</span>)) <span class="pl-c1">/</span> <span class="pl-en">pow</span>(<span class="pl-c1">2</span><span class="pl-kos">,</span> <span class="pl-c1">18</span>)))<span class="pl-kos">,</span> <span class="pl-c1">4</span>);
  <span class="pl-s1">--lqip-cb</span><span class="pl-kos">:</span> <span class="pl-en">mod</span>(<span class="pl-en">round</span>(down<span class="pl-kos">,</span> <span class="pl-en">calc</span>((<span class="pl-en">var</span>(<span class="pl-s1">--lqip</span>) <span class="pl-c1">+</span> <span class="pl-en">pow</span>(<span class="pl-c1">2</span><span class="pl-kos">,</span> <span class="pl-c1">19</span>)) <span class="pl-c1">/</span> <span class="pl-en">pow</span>(<span class="pl-c1">2</span><span class="pl-kos">,</span> <span class="pl-c1">16</span>)))<span class="pl-kos">,</span> <span class="pl-c1">4</span>);
  <span class="pl-c">/* more like that */</span>
}</pre>

<p>Which are expanded to even more variables with code like this:</p>
<pre><span class="pl-s1">--lqip-ca-clr</span><span class="pl-kos">:</span> <span class="pl-en">hsl</span>(<span class="pl-c1">0</span> <span class="pl-c1">0<span class="pl-smi">%</span></span> <span class="pl-en">calc</span>(<span class="pl-en">var</span>(<span class="pl-s1">--lqip-ca</span>) <span class="pl-c1">/</span> <span class="pl-c1">3</span> <span class="pl-c1">*</span> <span class="pl-c1">100<span class="pl-smi">%</span></span>));
<span class="pl-s1">--lqip-cb-clr</span><span class="pl-kos">:</span> <span class="pl-en">hsl</span>(<span class="pl-c1">0</span> <span class="pl-c1">0<span class="pl-smi">%</span></span> <span class="pl-en">calc</span>(<span class="pl-en">var</span>(<span class="pl-s1">--lqip-cb</span>) <span class="pl-c1">/</span> <span class="pl-c1">3</span> <span class="pl-c1">*</span> <span class="pl-c1">100<span class="pl-smi">%</span></span>));</pre>

<p>And finally rendered using a CSS gradient definition that starts like this:</p>
<pre>[<span class="pl-c1">style</span><span class="pl-c1">*=</span><span class="pl-s">"--lqip:"</span>] {
  <span class="pl-c1">background-image</span><span class="pl-kos">:</span>
    <span class="pl-en">radial-gradient</span>(<span class="pl-c1">50<span class="pl-smi">%</span></span> <span class="pl-c1">75<span class="pl-smi">%</span></span> at <span class="pl-c1">16.67<span class="pl-smi">%</span></span> <span class="pl-c1">25<span class="pl-smi">%</span></span><span class="pl-kos">,</span> <span class="pl-en">var</span>(<span class="pl-s1">--lqip-ca-clr</span>)<span class="pl-kos">,</span> transparent)<span class="pl-kos">,</span>
    <span class="pl-en">radial-gradient</span>(<span class="pl-c1">50<span class="pl-smi">%</span></span> <span class="pl-c1">75<span class="pl-smi">%</span></span> at <span class="pl-c1">50<span class="pl-smi">%</span></span> <span class="pl-c1">25<span class="pl-smi">%</span></span><span class="pl-kos">,</span> <span class="pl-en">var</span>(<span class="pl-s1">--lqip-cb-clr</span>)<span class="pl-kos">,</span> transparent)<span class="pl-kos">,</span>
    <span class="pl-c">/* ... */</span>
    <span class="pl-en">linear-gradient</span>(<span class="pl-c1">0<span class="pl-smi">deg</span></span><span class="pl-kos">,</span> <span class="pl-en">var</span>(<span class="pl-s1">--lqip-base-clr</span>)<span class="pl-kos">,</span> <span class="pl-en">var</span>(<span class="pl-s1">--lqip-base-clr</span>));

## Language evolves, so we must too. On generative art

date: 2025-04-03, from: Lean Rada's blog


<p>A year ago, I stood by the statement that <a href="https://leanrada.com/notes/ai-art-not-generative-art?ref=rss">AI Art is not Generative Art</a>, arguing that the term ‚Äògenerative art‚Äô is an art movement in itself that is separate from AI art.</p>

<p>Safe to say, it has been a losing battle.</p>

<p>Even the converse, <em>‚Äúgenerative art is not necessarily AI art‚Äù</em>, would be met by confusion from most people. ‚ÄòGenerative‚Äô has been equated to AI.</p>

<img src="https://leanrada.com/notes/language-evolves-generative-art/the-other-day.png?ref=rss" loading="lazy" width="718" height="118">

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/generative/comments/1hks3sg/has_the_word_generative_been_hijacked_by_ai/" target="_blank">r/generative - Has the word 'generative' been hijacked by AI?</a></p>

<p>I think it's time to move on to a different label. Words are for
communication, and if a word results in failure of communication, we
should either agree on a common definition (we can‚Äôt) or just use better
word.</p>

<h2>So, what are the other words for this art?</h2>
<box-note>If you haven‚Äôt read the mentioned <a href="https://leanrada.com/notes/ai-art-not-generative-art?ref=rss" target="_blank">prequel post</a>, you may not understand what ‚Äúart‚Äù I‚Äôm taliking about. There‚Äôs one example above, but <a href="https://leanrada.com/art?ref=rss" target="_blank">here‚Äôs more</a>.</box-note>
<p>Fortunately, there are already well-established terms to describe the
medium:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Procedural art
  </li><li>Algorithmic art
  </li><li>Creative coding
</li></ul>

<p>It‚Äôs just a matter of choosing one and leaving the now-loaded
‚Äògenerative‚Äô term behind.</p>

<p>By the process of elimination, I think ‚Äòprocedural art‚Äô is the best
term to use. Let me explain each of the other options.</p>

<h2>Why not Algorithmic</h2>

<p>‚ÄòAlgorithmic art‚Äô is a top candidate, for sure, and many others have <a href="https://monokai.com/articles/algorithmic-art-as-a-subset-of-generative-art" target="_blank">opted for it in the exodus from ‚Äògenerative‚Äô</a>. Algorithmic art and procedural art are pretty much synonymous, so why or why not?</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Unlike generative art, algorithmic art doesn‚Äôt
have the unfortunate connotation from sharing a word with ‚Äògenerative
AI‚Äô.</p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong> While ‚Äòalgorithmic art‚Äô doesn‚Äôt immediately
invoke visions of generative AI, the term ‚Äòalgortihm‚Äô under the broad definition
of a ‚Äòset of instructions‚Äô would still include machine learning
models.</p>

<p>In fact, the word ‚Äòalgorithm‚Äô has also entered commonplace usage via
<strong>‚Äòsocial media algorithms‚Äô</strong>, which are yet another application of machine
learning and statistics. In this sense, it is used interchangeably with
the recommender system used to construct personalised content feeds.
<em>‚ÄúThe algorithm‚Äù</em> is a black box, and the word <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/02/26/1020007/what-is-an-algorithm/" target="_blank">suggests a system beyond understanding</a>. This connotation is not in the spirit of procedural art, where the procedures are authored knowingly.</p>

<p>Another distinction is that while an algorithm is usually defined as a process that takes some <strong>input</strong> and processes it into an <strong>output</strong>, most procedural art programs don‚Äôt need inputs at all. They create things from scratch, from maths, from chaos. <small>OK, technically random seeds would be considerend input. But on a conceptual level, no inputs!</small></p>

<h2>Why not Creative Coding</h2>

<p>First of all, it‚Äôs such a vague phrase. Why not ‚Äòdynamic
programming‚Äô? üòâ</p>

<p>Anyway, that‚Äôs not the main point.</p>

<p>Procedural art has grown beyond <em>just coding</em>. I would even
say most procedural artists don't use code, but nodes and graphs. The
majority of these procedural art would be used in video games and movie
VFX.</p>

<p>Instead of coding, one would use <a href="https://pixieditor.net/blog/2024/07/12/devlog5#nodes" target="_blank">node-based programming</a> connecting
<strong>nodes</strong> that represent operations, building up a
<strong>graph</strong> to produce a complex image or even a
3D model.</p>

</figure>

<p>And it‚Äôs not just for industrial VFX purposes. It‚Äôs also used mainly
for multimedia, interactive, and installation art.</p>

</figure>

<p>So... yeah this genre of art, is not coding.</p>

<h2>OK, then why Procedural Art</h2>

<p>Because the ‚Äòprocedure‚Äô, the ‚Äòhow‚Äô is the core feature of procedural art.</p>

<p>In procedural art, we describe precisely <strong>how</strong> the
artwork is made. And it‚Äôs far from describing to a chatbot in plain
English. The how is well-defined and understood. Every shape, stroke,
their positions, colours, ranges, constraints, rules of interaction,
etc., are all described in some precise way. Sometimes we go down to individual
pixel level as in a shader. Sometimes at a more geometric level, like in
turtle or vector graphics. Sometimes on a mathematical level, like
fractals. Sometimes it‚Äôs even a simulation with emergent properties!</p>

<p>Procedural art is more about the <em>process</em>, watching things unfold and emerge, rather than the final output that algorithms are obsessed about.</p>

<p>Procedural art is about the interaction of rules in interesting ways, regardless of whether the rules were written in code, or connected as a graph, or wired in redstone dust.</p>

<p>Finally, <em>procedural art is not AI art</em>. [Insert same exact argument as <a href="https://leanrada.com/notes/ai-art-not-generative-art?ref=rss" target="_blank">AI Art is not Generative Art</a> but with a different name, here]. For funsies, here‚Äôs a quick guide: <em>In AI art, you describe <strong>what</strong> the artwork should be. In procedural art, you describe <strong>how</strong> the artwork could be.</em></p>

<h2>What now</h2>

<p>Language evolves because of general usage. See: <em>AI, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/cryptocurrency-are-not-crypto-bitcoin/" target="_blank">crypto</a>,
cyber, generative</em>. As a fellow user of language, I must evolve my languaging as well ‚Äî starting with this website.</p>

<p>I have updated the following pages to either disambiguate or even
completely replace mentions of ‚Äúgenerative art‚Äù:</p>

<ul>
  <li>/art/</li>
  <li>/wares/dimensions/</li>
</ul>

<p>For the record, I‚Äôm not rejecting the other perfectly acceptable terms like algorithmic art and creative coding. My art is still algorithmic, and it‚Äôs the result of creative coding. I‚Äôm just moving away from ‚Äògenerative‚Äô.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll settle on a universal term soon. Language evolves, after all.</p>

## Composite primary keys in Django

<p><strong><a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/topics/composite-primary-key/">Composite primary keys in Django</a></strong></p>
Django 5.2 is <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2025/apr/02/django-52-released/">out today</a> and a big new feature is composite primary keys, which can now be defined like this:</p>
<pre><span class="pl-k">class</span> <span class="pl-v">Release</span>(<span class="pl-s1">models</span>.<span class="pl-c1">Model</span>):
    <span class="pl-s1">pk</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-s1">models</span>.<span class="pl-c1">CompositePrimaryKey</span>(

    )
    <span class="pl-s1">version</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-s1">models</span>.<span class="pl-c1">IntegerField</span>()

<p>They don't yet work with the Django admin or as targets for foreign keys.</p>
<p>Other smaller new features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>All ORM models are now automatically imported into <code>./manage.py shell</code> - a feature borrowed from <code>./manage.py shell_plus</code> in <a href="https://django-extensions.readthedocs.io/">django-extensions</a></li>
<li>Feeds from the Django syndication framework can now specify <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/ref/contrib/syndication/#feed-stylesheets">XSLT stylesheets</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/ref/request-response/#django.http.HttpResponse.text">response.text</a> now returns the string representation of the body - I'm so happy about this, now I don't have to litter my Django tests with <code>response.content.decode("utf-8")</code> any more</li>
<li>a new <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/howto/custom-template-tags/#django.template.Library.simple_block_tag">simple_block_tag</a> helper making it much easier to create a custom Django template tag that further processes its own inner rendered content</li>
<li>A bunch more in the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/releases/5.2/">full release notes</a></li>
</ul>
<p>5.2 is also an LTS release, so it will receive security and data loss bug fixes up to April 2028.

## Copyright-Aware AI: Let‚Äôs Make It So

On April 22, 2022, I received an out-of-the-blue text from Sam Altman inquiring about the possibility of training GPT-4 on O‚ÄôReilly books. We had a call a few days later to discuss the possibility. As I recall our conversation, I told Sam I was intrigued, but with reservations. I explained to him that we could [&#8230;]

## Half Stack Data Science: Programming with AI, with Simon Willison

date: 2025-04-01, updated: 2025-04-01, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://halfstackdatascience.com/s4e2-programming-with-ai-with-simon-willison">Half Stack Data Science: Programming with AI, with Simon Willison</a></strong></p>
I participated in this wide-ranging 50 minute conversation with David Asboth and Shaun McGirr. Topics we covered included applications of LLMs to data journalism, the challenges of building an intuition for how best to use these tool given their "jagged frontier" of capabilities, how LLMs impact learning to program and how local models are starting to get genuinely useful now.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://overcast.fm/+AAnGvyyrHkg/27:47">27:47</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you're a new programmer, my optimistic version is that there has never been a better time to learn to program, because it shaves down the learning curve so much. When you're learning to program and you miss a semicolon and you bang your head against the computer for four hours [...] if you're unlucky you quit programming for good because it was so frustrating. [...]</p>
<p>I've always been a project-oriented learner; I can learn things by building something, and now the friction involved in building something has gone down so much [...] So I think especially if you're an autodidact, if you're somebody who likes teaching yourself things, these are a gift from heaven. You get a weird teaching assistant that knows loads of stuff and occasionally makes weird mistakes and believes in bizarre conspiracy theories, but you have 24 hour access to that assistant.</p>
<p>If you're somebody who prefers structured learning in classrooms, I think the benefits are going to take a lot longer to get to you because we don't know how to use these things in classrooms yet. [...]</p>
<p>If you want to strike out on your own, this is an amazing tool <em>if</em> you learn how to learn with it. So you've got to learn the limits of what it can do, and you've got to be disciplined enough to make sure you're not outsourcing the bits you need to learn to the machines.</p>

## What's wrong with AI-generated docs

<p>In what is tantamount to a <a href="https://tante.cc/2025/03/28/vulgar-display-of-power/">vulgar display of power</a>, social media has been flooded with AI-generated images that mimic the style of Hayao Miyazaki&rsquo;s anime. Something similar happens daily with tech writing, folks happily throwing context at LLMs and thinking they can vibe write outstanding docs out of them, perhaps even surpassing human writers. Well, it&rsquo;s time to draw a line. Don&rsquo;t let AI influencers <em>studioghiblify</em> your work as if it were a matter of processing text.</p>

## Pydantic Evals

date: 2025-04-01, updated: 2025-04-01, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://ai.pydantic.dev/evals/">Pydantic Evals</a></strong></p>
Brand new package from David Montague and the Pydantic AI team which directly tackles what I consider to be the single hardest problem in AI engineering: building evals to determine if your LLM-based system is working correctly and getting better over time.</p>
<p>The feature is described as "in beta" and comes with this very realistic warning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unlike unit tests, evals are an emerging art/science; anyone who claims to know for sure exactly how your evals should be defined can safely be ignored.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This code example from their documentation illustrates the relationship between the two key nouns - Cases and Datasets:</p>
<pre><span class="pl-k">from</span> <span class="pl-s1">pydantic_evals</span> <span class="pl-k">import</span> <span class="pl-v">Case</span>, <span class="pl-v">Dataset</span>

<span class="pl-s1">case1</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-en">Case</span>(
    <span class="pl-s1">name</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span><span class="pl-s">"simple_case"</span>,
    <span class="pl-s1">inputs</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span><span class="pl-s">"What is the capital of France?"</span>,
    <span class="pl-s1">expected_output</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span><span class="pl-s">"Paris"</span>,
    <span class="pl-s1">metadata</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span>{<span class="pl-s">"difficulty"</span>: <span class="pl-s">"easy"</span>},
)

<span class="pl-s1">dataset</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-en">Dataset</span>(<span class="pl-s1">cases</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span>[<span class="pl-s1">case1</span>])</pre>

<p>The library also supports custom evaluators, including LLM-as-a-judge:</p>
<pre><span class="pl-en">Case</span>(
    <span class="pl-s1">name</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span><span class="pl-s">"vegetarian_recipe"</span>,
    <span class="pl-s1">inputs</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span><span class="pl-en">CustomerOrder</span>(
        <span class="pl-s1">dish_name</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span><span class="pl-s">"Spaghetti Bolognese"</span>, <span class="pl-s1">dietary_restriction</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span><span class="pl-s">"vegetarian"</span>
    ),
    <span class="pl-s1">expected_output</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span><span class="pl-c1">None</span>,
    <span class="pl-s1">metadata</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span>{<span class="pl-s">"focus"</span>: <span class="pl-s">"vegetarian"</span>},
    <span class="pl-s1">evaluators</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span>(
        <span class="pl-en">LLMJudge</span>(
            <span class="pl-s1">rubric</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span><span class="pl-s">"Recipe should not contain meat or animal products"</span>,
        ),
    ),
)</pre>

<p>Cases and datasets can also be serialized to YAML.</p>
<p>My first impressions are that this looks like a solid implementation of a sensible design. I'm looking forward to trying it out against a real project.

## Why is everything so scalable?

date: 2025-04-01, from: Stavros Stuff

<div class="pull-quote">Everyone is a FAANG engineer</div><p>I&#8217;m entirely convinced that basically every developer alive today heard the adage &#8220;dress for the job you want, not the job you have&#8221; and figured that, since they always wear jeans and a t-shirt anyway, they might as well apply it to their systems&#8217; architecture.
This explains why the stack of every single company I&#8217;ve seen is invariably AWS/GCP with at least thirty microservices (how else will you keep the code tidy?), a distributed datastore

## LLMs Are Not Security Mitigations

LLMs are great code reviewers. They can even spot security mistakes that open us up to vulnerabilities.
But no, they‚Äôre not an adequate mitigation. You can‚Äôt use them to ensure security.

## debug-gym

date: 2025-03-31, updated: 2025-03-31, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://microsoft.github.io/debug-gym/">debug-gym</a></strong></p>
New paper and code from Microsoft Research that experiments with giving LLMs access to the Python debugger. They found that the best models could indeed improve their results by running pdb as a tool.</p>
<p>They saw the best results overall from Claude 3.7 Sonnet against <a href="https://www.swebench.com/lite.html">SWE-bench Lite</a>, where it scored 37.2% in rewrite mode without a debugger, 48.4% with their debugger tool and 52.1% with debug(5) - a mechanism where the pdb tool is made available only after the 5th rewrite attempt.</p>
<p>Their code is <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/debug-gym">available on GitHub</a>. I found this implementation of <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/debug-gym/blob/1.0.0/debug_gym/gym/tools/pdb.py">the pdb tool</a>, and tracked down the main system and user prompt in <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/debug-gym/blob/1.0.0/debug_gym/agents/debug_agent.py">agents/debug_agent.py</a>:</p>
<p>System prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Your goal is to debug a Python program to make sure it can pass a set of test functions. You have access to the pdb debugger tools, you can use them to investigate the code, set breakpoints, and print necessary values to identify the bugs. Once you have gained enough information, propose a rewriting patch to fix the bugs. Avoid rewriting the entire code, focus on the bugs only.</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>User prompt (which they call an "action prompt"):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Based on the instruction, the current code, the last execution output, and the history information, continue your debugging process using pdb commands or to propose a patch using rewrite command. Output a single command, nothing else. Do not repeat your previous commands unless they can provide more information. You must be concise and avoid overthinking.</code></p>

## Summary of changes for March 2025

date: 2025-03-31, from: Hundred Rabbits blog

<p>Hey everyone!</p><p>This is the list of all the changes we've done to our projects during the month of March.</p>

<img src="../media/content/videos/march_2025.jpg" alt="little ninj, a plus ninja, is examining at the contents of a first-aid kit" loading="lazy">

<h2>Summary Of Changes</h2>

<p>In the above illustration, little Ninj is going through a <a href="https://rabbitwaves.ca/site/first_aid_kit.html" target="_blank">first-aid kit</a>, looking through our supplies to see what needs to be topped off and what is out-of-date. Rek drew a list of suggestions on what to include in both a first-aid and a medical kit for the Rabbit Waves project, we plan to add more items soon(thanks to everyone on Mastodon who suggested additions! It'll be in the April update).</p>

<p>We will spend the first few days of April participating in <a href="https://itch.io/jam/flickjam-2025" target="_blank">Flickjam</a>, making small games in the style of <a href="https://www.flickgame.org/index.html" target="_blank">Flickgame</a>, a tool originally made by Increpare, in which the world is navigated by clicking on pixels of different colors to head in different directions. Devine ported <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/flick.html" target="_blank">Flickgame to Varvara</a>, and wrote a compiler for flick games to uxn roms.</p>

<p>This past month, Rek finished transcribing the entire 15 weeks of the <a href="../site/victoria_to_sitka_logbook.html">Victoria to Sitka logbook</a>! We have plans to turn it into a book, in the style of <a href="../site/busy_doing_nothing.html">Busy Doing Nothing</a>, with tons of extra content and illustrations.</p>

<p>March was a very good month for silly <a href="https://rabbits.srht.site/days/2025/03/31.html" target="_blank">calendar doodles</a>. Our paper calendar is always in view, it documents important events like releases, appointments, as well as food, memes, and other noteworthy things that happened on each day.</p>

<p><b>Book Club:</b> This month we are still reading <i>The Goldfinch</i> by Donna Tartt(it's a long book).</p>

## Minimal CSS-only blurry image placeholders

date: 2025-03-30, from: Lean Rada's blog


<p>Here‚Äôs a CSS technique that produces blurry image placeholders (LQIPs) without cluttering up your markup ‚Äî <em>Only a single custom property needed!</em></p>
<card-box>
  <code-block language="html">
    <pre><code>&lt;img src="‚Ä¶" style="--lqip:192900"&gt;</code></pre>
  </code-block>

  <p>The custom property above gives you this image:</p>

  <p>
  </p><div></div>
  <p></p>

  <label>
    Try changing the property‚Äôs value <strong>(WARNING: FLASHING)</strong>
    <input type="range" min="-999999" max="999999">
  </label>
  <script>
    {
      const card = document.currentScript.parentElement;
      const input = card.querySelector("input");
      const code = card.querySelector("code");
      const preview = card.querySelector("div");

      let currentValueStr = "192900";
      let targetCode = null

      input.addEventListener("input", event => {
        if (!targetCode) {
          targetCode = Array.from(code.querySelectorAll("span")).filter(el => el.textContent.includes(currentValueStr)).slice(-1)[0] ?? code;
        }

        const lqip = Number(event.currentTarget.value);
        // use this page's lqip to avoid breakage if I ever update the scheme
        preview.style.setProperty("--my-lqip", lqip);
        targetCode.innerHTML = targetCode.innerHTML.replace(currentValueStr, lqip);
        currentValueStr = String(lqip);
      });
    }
  </script>
</card-box>
<p>Granted, it‚Äôs a <em>very blurry</em> placeholder especially in contrast to other leading solutions. But the point is that it‚Äôs minimal and non-invasive! No need for wrapper elements or attributes with long strings of data, or JavaScript at all.</p>
<box-note>Note for RSS readers / ‚ÄòReader‚Äô mode clients: This post makes heavy use of CSS-based images. Your client may not support it.</box-note>

</card-box>
<h2>Survey of LQIP approaches</h2>

<p>There have been many different techniques to implement LQIPs (low quality image placeholders), such as a very low
  resolution WebP or JPEG (<a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2015/08/06/android/the-technology-behind-preview-photos/" target="_blank">beheaded JPEGs</a> even), optimised SVG shape placements (<a href="https://github.com/axe312ger/sqip" target="_blank">SQIP</a>), and directly applying a discrete cosine
  transform (<a href="https://blurha.sh/" target="_blank">BlurHash</a>). Don‚Äôt forget good old progressive JPEGs and interlaced
  PNGs!</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://leanrada.com/notes/css-only-lqip/solid-colour.png?ref=rss" alt="image gallery with solid colour placeholders" width="1368" height="832">
  <figcaption>Canva and Pinterest use solid colour placeholders.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>At the other end of the spectrum, we have low tech solutions such as a simple solid fill of the image‚Äôs average colour.</p>

<p>Pure inline CSS solutions have the advantage rendering immediately ‚Äî even a <code>background-image: url(‚Ä¶a data URL)</code> would be fine!</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://leanrada.com/notes/css-only-lqip/gradient-css.png?ref=rss" alt="image gallery with gradient placeholders" width="1368" height="832">
  <figcaption><a href="https://github.com/fraser-hemp/gradify" target="_blank">Gradify</a> generates linear-gradients
    that very roughly approximate the full image.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The big disadvantage of pure CSS approaches is that you typically litter your markup with lengthy inline styles or obnoxious data URLs. My handcoded site with no build step would be extra incompatible with this approach!</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!-- typical gradify css --&gt;
&lt;img width="200" height="150" style="
  background: linear-gradient(45deg, #f4a261, transparent),
    linear-gradient(-45deg, #e76f51, transparent),
    linear-gradient(90deg, #8ab17d, transparent),
    linear-gradient(0deg, #d62828, #023047);
"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong><a href="https://blurha.sh/">BlurHash</a></strong> is a solution that minimises markup by compressing image
  data into a
  <strong>short base-83 string</strong>, but decoding and rendering that data requires additional JS‚Ä¶
</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!-- a blurhash markup --&gt;
&lt;img width="200" height="150" src="‚Ä¶"
  data-blurhash="LEHV6nWB2yk8pyo0adR*.7kCMdnj"&gt;</code></pre>

<figure>
  <img src="https://leanrada.com/notes/css-only-lqip/blurhash.png?ref=rss" width="276" height="171">
  <figcaption>BlurHash example</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Is it possible to decode a blur hash in CSS instead?</p>

<h2>Decoding in pure CSS</h2>

<p>Unlike BlurHash, we can‚Äôt use a string encoding because there are very few if any string manipulation
  functions in CSS (2025), so strings are out.</p>

<p>In the end, I came up with my own hash / encoding, and the <b>integer</b> type was the best vessel for it.</p>

<p>The usual way to encode stuff in a single integer is by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_manipulation" target="_blank"><strong>bit packing</strong></a>, where you pack multiple numbers in an integer as bits. Amazingly, we can unpack them in pure CSS!</p>

<p>To unpack bits, all you need is bit shifting and bit masking. <strong>Bit shifting</strong> can be done by division and floor operations ‚Äî <code>calc(x / y)</code> and <code>round(down,n)</code> ‚Äî and <strong>bit masking</strong> via the modulo function <code>mod(a,b)</code>.</p>

<pre><code>* {
/* Example packed int: */
/* 0b11_00_001_101 */
--packed-int: 781;
--bits-9-10: mod(round(down, calc(var(--packed-int) / 256)), 4); /* 3 */
--bits-7-8: mod(round(down, calc(var(--packed-int) / 64)), 4); /* 0 */
--bits-4-6: mod(round(down, calc(var(--packed-int) / 8)), 8); /* 1 */
--bits-0-3: mod(var(--packed-int), 8); /* 5 */
}</code></pre>

<p>Of course, we could also use <code>pow(2,n)</code> instead of hardcoded powers of two.</p>

<p>So, a <strong>single CSS integer value</strong> was going to be the encoding of the ‚Äúhash‚Äù of my CSS-only blobhash
  (that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm calling it now). But how much information can we pack in a single CSS int?</p>

<h2>Side quest: Limits of CSS values</h2>

<p>The spec doesn‚Äôt say anything about the allowed range for int values, leaving the fate of my shenanigans to browser vendors.</p>

<p>From my experiments, apparently you can only use integers from <strong>-999,999 up to 999,999</strong> in custom
  properties before you lose precision. Just beyond that limit, we start getting values rounded to tens ‚Äî
  1,234,56<del>7</del> becomes 1,234,56<ins>0</ins>. Which is weird (precision is counted in decimal places!?), but I
  bet it‚Äôs due to historical, Internet Explorer-esque reasons.</p>

<p>Anyway, within the range of [-999999, 999999] there are <strong>1,999,999</strong> values. This meant that with a
  single integer hash, almost two million LQIP configurations could be described. To make calculation
  easier, I reduced it to the nearest power of two down which is 2<sup>20</sup>.</p>
<card-box>
  <code>2<sup>20</sup> = 1,048,576 &lt; 1,999,999 &lt; 2,097,152 = 2<sup>21</sup></code>
</card-box>
<p><strong>In short, I had 20 bits of information to encode the CSS-based LQIP hash.</strong></p>
<box-note><strong>Why is it called a ‚Äúhash‚Äù?</strong> Because it‚Äôs a mapping from an any-size data to a fixed-size
  value. In this case, there are an infinite number of images of arbitrary sizes, but only 1,999,999 possible hash
  values.</box-note>
<h2>The Scheme</h2>

<p>With only 20 bits, the LQIP image must be a very simplified version of the full image. I ended up with this scheme:
  a single base colour + 6 brightness components, to be overlaid on top of the base colour in a 3√ó2 grid. A
  rather extreme version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroma_subsampling" target="_blank">chroma
    subsampling</a>.</p>

<img src="https://leanrada.com/notes/css-only-lqip/scheme.png?ref=rss" alt="illustration of encoded components" width="600" height="500">

<p>This totals <strong>9 numbers</strong> to pack into the 20-bit integer:</p>

<p>The <strong>base colour</strong> is encoded in the <strong>lower 8 bits</strong> in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklab_color_space" target="_blank">Oklab colour space</a>. 2 bits for luminance, and 3 bits for each of the a and b coordinates. I‚Äôve found Oklab to give subjectively balanced results, but RGB should work just as well.</p>

<p>The <strong>6 greyscale components</strong> are encoded in the <strong>higher 12 bits</strong> ‚Äî 2 bits each.</p>

<p>An offline script was created to compress any given image into this integer format. The script was quite simple: Get the average
  or dominant colour ‚Äî there are a lot of libraries that can do that ‚Äî then resize the image down to
  3√ó2 pixels and get the greyscale values. <a href="https://github.com/Kalabasa/leanrada.com/blob/7b6739c7c30c66c771fcbc9e1dc8942e628c5024/main/scripts/update/lqip.mjs#L118-L159" target="_blank">Here‚Äôs my script.</a></p>
<box-note>I even tried a <a href="https://blog.4dcu.be/programming/2020/01/12/Genetic-Art-Algorithm.html" target="_blank">genetic algorithm</a> to optimise the LQIP bits, but the fitness function was hard to establish. Ultimately, I would‚Äôve needed an offline CSS renderer for this to work accurately. Maybe a future iteration could use some headless Chrome solution to automatically compare real renderings of the LQIP against the source image.</box-note>
<p>Once encoded, it‚Äôs set as the value of <code>--lqip</code> via the style attribute in the target element. It could then be decoded in CSS. Here‚Äôs the actual code I used for decoding:</p>

<pre><code>[style*="--lqip:"] {
--lqip-ca: mod(round(down, calc((var(--lqip) + pow(2, 19)) / pow(2, 18))), 4);
--lqip-cb: mod(round(down, calc((var(--lqip) + pow(2, 19)) / pow(2, 16))), 4);
--lqip-cc: mod(round(down, calc((var(--lqip) + pow(2, 19)) / pow(2, 14))), 4);
--lqip-cd: mod(round(down, calc((var(--lqip) + pow(2, 19)) / pow(2, 12))), 4);
--lqip-ce: mod(round(down, calc((var(--lqip) + pow(2, 19)) / pow(2, 10))), 4);
--lqip-cf: mod(round(down, calc((var(--lqip) + pow(2, 19)) / pow(2, 8))), 4);
--lqip-ll: mod(round(down, calc((var(--lqip) + pow(2, 19)) / pow(2, 6))), 4);
--lqip-aaa: mod(round(down, calc((var(--lqip) + pow(2, 19)) / pow(2, 3))), 8);
--lqip-bbb: mod(calc(var(--lqip) + pow(2, 19)), 8);</code></pre>

<p>Before rendering the decoded values, the raw number data values need to be converted to CSS colours. It‚Äôs fairly
  straightforward, just a bunch linear interpolations into colour constructor functions.</p>

<pre><code>/* continued */
--lqip-ca-clr: hsl(0 0% calc(var(--lqip-ca) / 3 * 100%));
--lqip-cb-clr: hsl(0 0% calc(var(--lqip-cb) / 3 * 100%));
--lqip-cc-clr: hsl(0 0% calc(var(--lqip-cc) / 3 * 100%));
--lqip-cd-clr: hsl(0 0% calc(var(--lqip-cd) / 3 * 100%));
--lqip-ce-clr: hsl(0 0% calc(var(--lqip-ce) / 3 * 100%));
--lqip-cf-clr: hsl(0 0% calc(var(--lqip-cf) / 3 * 100%));
--lqip-base-clr: oklab(
  calc(var(--lqip-ll) / 3 * 0.6 + 0.2)
  calc(var(--lqip-aaa) / 8 * 0.7 - 0.35)
  calc((var(--lqip-bbb) + 1) / 8 * 0.7 - 0.35)
);
}</code></pre>
<card-box>
  <strong>Time for another demo!</strong>
  <label>
    Try different values of <code>--lqip</code> to decode
    <input type="range" min="-999999" max="999999">
  </label>
  <p>
    <code></code>
  </p>
  <script>
    {
      const card = document.currentScript.parentElement;
      const input = card.querySelector("input");
      const preview = card.querySelector(".lqip-unpack").parentElement;

      let currentValueStr = "-721311";
      render(Number(currentValueStr));

      input.addEventListener("input", event => {
        const lqip = Number(event.currentTarget.value);
        render(lqip);
        currentValueStr = String(lqip);
      });

      function render(lqip) {
        preview.style.setProperty("--my-lqip", lqip);
      };
    }
  </script>
  

  You can see here how each component variable maps to the LQIP image. E.g. the <code>cb</code> value corresponds to
  the relative brightness of the top middle area. <em>Fun fact: The above preview content is implemented in pure
    CSS!</em>
</card-box>
<h2>Rendering it all</h2>

<p>Finally, rendering the LQIP. I used multiple <strong>radial gradients</strong> to render the greyscale components,
  and a flat base colour at the bottom.</p>

<pre><code>[style*="--lqip:"] {
background-image:
  radial-gradient(50% 75% at 16.67% 25%, var(--lqip-ca-clr), transparent),
  radial-gradient(50% 75% at 50% 25%, var(--lqip-cb-clr), transparent),
  radial-gradient(50% 75% at 83.33% 25%, var(--lqip-cc-clr), transparent),
  radial-gradient(50% 75% at 16.67% 75%, var(--lqip-cd-clr), transparent),
  radial-gradient(50% 75% at 50% 75%, var(--lqip-ce-clr), transparent),
  radial-gradient(50% 75% at 83.33% 75%, var(--lqip-cf-clr), transparent),
  linear-gradient(0deg, var(--lqip-base-clr), var(--lqip-base-clr));
}</code></pre>

<p>The above is a simplified version of the full renderer for illustrative purposes. <small>The real one has doubled layers, smooth gradient falloffs, and blend modes.</small></p>

<p>As you might expect, the radial gradients are arranged in a 3√ó2 grid. You can see it in this interactive deconstructor view!</p>
<card-box>
  <strong>LQIP deconstructor!</strong>
  <label>

    <input type="range" min="0" max="100" value="0">
    Change the <code>--lqip</code> value,
    <input type="range" min="-999999" max="999999">
  </label>
  <div></div>
  <script>
    {
      const card = document.currentScript.parentElement;
      const [revealInput, lqipInput] = card.querySelectorAll("input");
      const preview = card.querySelector(".lqip-reveal");

      let currentValueStr = "-747540";
      render(Number(currentValueStr));

      lqipInput.addEventListener("input", event => {
        const lqip = Number(event.currentTarget.value);
        render(lqip);
        currentValueStr = String(lqip);
      });

      revealInput.addEventListener("input", event => {
        preview.style.setProperty("--reveal", event.currentTarget.value / 100);
      });

      function render(lqip) {
        preview.style.setProperty("--my-lqip", lqip);
      };
    }
  </script>
  
</card-box>
<p>These radial gradients are the core of the CSS-based LQIP. The position and radius of the gradients are an important detail that would determine how well these can approximate real images. Besides that, another requirement is that these individual radial gradients must be seamless when combined together.</p>

<p>I implemented smooth gradient falloffs to make the final result look seamless. It took special care to make the gradients extra smooth, so let‚Äôs dive into it‚Ä¶</p>

<h2>Bilinear interpolation approximation with radial gradients</h2>

<p>Radial gradients use linear interpolation by default. Interpolation refers to how it maps the in-between colours from the start colour to the end colour. And linear interpolation, the most basic interpolation, well‚Ä¶</p>

<figure>
  <interpolation-example></interpolation-example>
  <figcaption>CSS radial-gradients with linear interpolation</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It doesn‚Äôt look good. It gives us these hard edges (highlighted above). You could almost see the elliptical edges of each radial gradient and their centers.</p>

<p>In real raster images, we‚Äôd use <a href="https://harmoniccode.blogspot.com/2011/04/bilinear-color-interpolation.html" target="_blank">bilinear interpolation</a> at the very least when scaling up low resolution images. <a href="https://blog.demofox.org/2015/08/15/resizing-images-with-bicubic-interpolation/" target="_blank">Bicubic interpolation is even better.</a></p>

<p>One way to simulate the smoothness of bilinear interpolation in an array of CSS radial-gradients is to use <strong>‚Äòquadratic easing‚Äô</strong> to control the gradation of opacity.</p>

<p>This means the opacity falloff of the gradient would be smoother around the center and the edges. Each gradient would get feathered edges, smoothening the overall composite image.</p>

<p>However, CSS gradients <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/1332" target="_blank">don‚Äôt support nonlinear interpolation of opacity yet as of writing</a> (not to be confused with colour space interpolation, which browsers do support!). The solution for now is to add more points in the gradient to get a smooth opacity curve based on the quadratic formula.</p>

<pre><code>radial-gradient(
  &lt;position&gt;,
  rgb(82 190 240 / 100%) 0%,
  rgb(82 190 204 / 98%) 10%,
  rgb(82 190 204 / 92%) 20%,
  rgb(82 190 204 / 82%) 30%,
  rgb(82 190 204 / 68%) 40%,
  rgb(82 190 204 / 32%) 60%,
  rgb(82 190 204 / 18%) 70%,
  rgb(82 190 204 / 8%) 80%,
  rgb(82 190 204 / 2%) 90%,
  transparent 100%
)</code></pre>

<figure>
  <img src="https://leanrada.com/notes/css-only-lqip/interpolation-graph.png?ref=rss" width="1024" height="768">
  <figcaption>The quadratic interpolation is based on two quadratic curves (parabolas), one for each half of the gradient ‚Äî one upward and another downward.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The quadratic easing blends adjacent radial gradients together, mimicking the smooth bilinear (or even bicubic) interpolation. It‚Äôs almost like a fake blur filter, thus achieving the ‚Äòblur‚Äô part of this BlurHash alternative.</p>

<h2>Appendix: Alternatives considered</h2>

<h3>Four colours instead of monochromatic preview</h3>

<p>Four 5-bit colours, where each <b>R</b> is 2 bits, <b>G</b> is 2 bits, and <b>B</b> is just a zero or one.</p>

<p>The four colours would map to the four corners of the image box, rendered as radial gradients</p>

<p>This was my first attempt, and I fiddled with this for a while, but mixing four colours properly require proper bilinear interpolation and probably a shader. Just layering gradients resulted in muddiness (just like mixing too many watercolour pigments), and there was no CSS blend mode that could fix it. So I abandoned it, and moved on to a monochromatic approach.</p>

<h3>Single solid colour</h3>

<p>This was what I used on this website before. It‚Äôs simple and effective. A clean-markup approach could still use the custom <code>--lqip</code> variable:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img src="‚Ä¶" style="--lqip:#9bc28e"&gt;

&lt;style&gt;
/* we save some bytes by ‚Äòaliasing‚Äô this property */
* { background-color: var(--lqip) }
&lt;/style&gt;</code></pre>

<h3>HTML attribute instead of CSS custom property</h3>

<p>We can use HTML attributes to control CSS soon! Here‚Äôs what the LQIP markup would look like in the future:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img src="‚Ä¶" lqip="192900"&gt;</code></pre>

<p>Waiting for <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/advanced-attr" target="_blank"><code>attr()</code> Level 5</a> for this one. It‚Äôs nicer and shorter, fewer weird punctuations in markup <small>(who came up with the double dash for CSS vars anyway?)</small>. The value can then be referenced in CSS with <code>attr(lqip type(&lt;number&gt;))</code> instead of <code>var(--lqip)</code>.</p>

<p>For extra safety, a <code>data-</code> prefix could be added to the attribute name.</p>

<p>Can‚Äôt wait for this to get widespread adoption. I also want it for my <a href="https://jordanbrennan.hashnode.dev/tac-a-new-css-methodology" target="_blank">TAC components</a>.</p>
