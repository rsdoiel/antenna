## First look at the modern attr()

date: 2025-04-03, updated: 2025-04-03, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://ishadeed.com/article/modern-attr/">First look at the modern attr()</a></strong></p>
Chrome 133 (released February 25th 2025) was the first browser to <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/release-notes/133?hl=en#css_advanced_attr_function">ship support</a> for the advanced CSS <code>attr()</code> function (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/attr">MDN</a>), which lets <code>attr()</code> be used to compose values using types other than strings.</p>
<p>Ahmad Shadeed explores potential applications of this in detail, trying it out for CSS grid columns, progress bars, background images, animation delays and more.</p>
<p>I like this example that uses the <code>rows="5"</code> attribute on a <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code> to calculate its <code>max-height</code> - here wrapped in a feature detection block:</p>
<pre><span class="pl-k">@supports</span> (<span class="pl-c1">x</span><span class="pl-kos">:</span> <span class="pl-en">attr</span>(x <span class="pl-en">type</span>(<span class="pl-c1">*</span>))) {
  <span class="pl-ent">textarea</span> {
    <span class="pl-c1">min-height</span><span class="pl-kos">:</span> <span class="pl-en">calc</span>(
      <span class="pl-en">attr</span>(rows <span class="pl-en">type</span>(&lt;number<span class="pl-c1">&gt;</span>)) <span class="pl-c1">*</span> <span class="pl-c1">50<span class="pl-smi">px</span></span>
    );
  }
}</pre>

<p>That <code>type(&lt;number&gt;)</code> is the new syntax.</p>
<p>Many of Ahmad's examples can be achieved today across all browsers using a slightly more verbose CSS custom property syntax.</p>
<p>Here are the tracking issues for CSS values support in <code>attr()</code> for <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=435426">Firefox</a> (opened 17 years ago) and <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=26609">WebKit</a> (16 years ago).

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/koaning/smartfunc">smartfunc</a></strong></p>
Vincent D. Warmerdam built this ingenious wrapper around my <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/python-api.html">LLM Python library</a> which lets you build LLM wrapper functions using a decorator and a docstring:</p>
<pre><span class="pl-k">from</span> <span class="pl-s1">smartfunc</span> <span class="pl-k">import</span> <span class="pl-s1">backend</span>

<span class="pl-en">@<span class="pl-en">backend</span>(<span class="pl-s">"gpt-4o"</span>)</span>
<span class="pl-k">def</span> <span class="pl-en">generate_summary</span>(<span class="pl-s1">text</span>: <span class="pl-smi">str</span>):
    <span class="pl-s">"""Generate a summary of the following text: {{ text }}"""</span>
    <span class="pl-k">pass</span>

<span class="pl-s1">summary</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-en">generate_summary</span>(<span class="pl-s1">long_text</span>)</pre>

<p>It works with <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/plugins/directory.html">LLM plugins</a> so the same pattern should work against Gemini, Claude and hundreds of others, including local models.</p>
<p>It integrates with more recent LLM features too, including <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/python-api.html#python-api-async">async support</a> and <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/28/llm-schemas/">schemas</a>, by introspecting the function signature:</p>
<pre><span class="pl-k">class</span> <span class="pl-v">Summary</span>(<span class="pl-v">BaseModel</span>):
    <span class="pl-s1">summary</span>: <span class="pl-smi">str</span>
    <span class="pl-s1">pros</span>: <span class="pl-s1">list</span>[<span class="pl-smi">str</span>]
    <span class="pl-s1">cons</span>: <span class="pl-s1">list</span>[<span class="pl-smi">str</span>]

<span class="pl-en">@<span class="pl-en">async_backend</span>(<span class="pl-s">"gpt-4o-mini"</span>)</span>
<span class="pl-k">async</span> <span class="pl-k">def</span> <span class="pl-en">generate_poke_desc</span>(<span class="pl-s1">text</span>: <span class="pl-smi">str</span>) <span class="pl-c1">-&gt;</span> <span class="pl-smi">Summary</span>:

<p>Vincent also recorded <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9jh46R0ryY">a 12 minute video</a> walking through the implementation and showing how it uses <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/">Pydantic</a>, Python's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html">inspect</a> module and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.get_type_hints">typing.get_type_hints()</a> function.

## Minimal CSS-only blurry image placeholders

date: 2025-04-03, updated: 2025-04-03, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://leanrada.com/notes/css-only-lqip/">Minimal CSS-only blurry image placeholders</a></strong></p>
Absolutely brilliant piece of CSS ingenuity by Lean Rada, who describes a way to implement blurry placeholder images using just CSS, with syntax like this:</p>
<pre><span class="pl-kos">&lt;</span><span class="pl-ent">img</span> <span class="pl-c1">src</span>="<span class="pl-s">…</span>" <span class="pl-c1">style</span>="<span class="pl-s">--lqip:192900</span>"<span class="pl-kos">&gt;</span></pre>

<p>That 192900 number encodes everything needed to construct the placeholder - it manages to embed a single base color and six brightness components (in a 3x2 grid) in 20 bits, then encodes those as an integer in the roughly 2 million available values between -999,999 and 999,999 - beyond which range Lean found some browsers would start to lose precision.</p>
<p>The implementation for decoding that value becomes a bunch of clever bit-fiddling CSS expressions to expand it into further CSS variables:</p>
<pre>[<span class="pl-c1">style</span><span class="pl-c1">*=</span><span class="pl-s">"--lqip:"</span>] {
  <span class="pl-s1">--lqip-ca</span><span class="pl-kos">:</span> <span class="pl-en">mod</span>(<span class="pl-en">round</span>(down<span class="pl-kos">,</span> <span class="pl-en">calc</span>((<span class="pl-en">var</span>(<span class="pl-s1">--lqip</span>) <span class="pl-c1">+</span> <span class="pl-en">pow</span>(<span class="pl-c1">2</span><span class="pl-kos">,</span> <span class="pl-c1">19</span>)) <span class="pl-c1">/</span> <span class="pl-en">pow</span>(<span class="pl-c1">2</span><span class="pl-kos">,</span> <span class="pl-c1">18</span>)))<span class="pl-kos">,</span> <span class="pl-c1">4</span>);
  <span class="pl-s1">--lqip-cb</span><span class="pl-kos">:</span> <span class="pl-en">mod</span>(<span class="pl-en">round</span>(down<span class="pl-kos">,</span> <span class="pl-en">calc</span>((<span class="pl-en">var</span>(<span class="pl-s1">--lqip</span>) <span class="pl-c1">+</span> <span class="pl-en">pow</span>(<span class="pl-c1">2</span><span class="pl-kos">,</span> <span class="pl-c1">19</span>)) <span class="pl-c1">/</span> <span class="pl-en">pow</span>(<span class="pl-c1">2</span><span class="pl-kos">,</span> <span class="pl-c1">16</span>)))<span class="pl-kos">,</span> <span class="pl-c1">4</span>);
  <span class="pl-c">/* more like that */</span>
}</pre>

<p>Which are expanded to even more variables with code like this:</p>
<pre><span class="pl-s1">--lqip-ca-clr</span><span class="pl-kos">:</span> <span class="pl-en">hsl</span>(<span class="pl-c1">0</span> <span class="pl-c1">0<span class="pl-smi">%</span></span> <span class="pl-en">calc</span>(<span class="pl-en">var</span>(<span class="pl-s1">--lqip-ca</span>) <span class="pl-c1">/</span> <span class="pl-c1">3</span> <span class="pl-c1">*</span> <span class="pl-c1">100<span class="pl-smi">%</span></span>));
<span class="pl-s1">--lqip-cb-clr</span><span class="pl-kos">:</span> <span class="pl-en">hsl</span>(<span class="pl-c1">0</span> <span class="pl-c1">0<span class="pl-smi">%</span></span> <span class="pl-en">calc</span>(<span class="pl-en">var</span>(<span class="pl-s1">--lqip-cb</span>) <span class="pl-c1">/</span> <span class="pl-c1">3</span> <span class="pl-c1">*</span> <span class="pl-c1">100<span class="pl-smi">%</span></span>));</pre>

<p>And finally rendered using a CSS gradient definition that starts like this:</p>
<pre>[<span class="pl-c1">style</span><span class="pl-c1">*=</span><span class="pl-s">"--lqip:"</span>] {
  <span class="pl-c1">background-image</span><span class="pl-kos">:</span>
    <span class="pl-en">radial-gradient</span>(<span class="pl-c1">50<span class="pl-smi">%</span></span> <span class="pl-c1">75<span class="pl-smi">%</span></span> at <span class="pl-c1">16.67<span class="pl-smi">%</span></span> <span class="pl-c1">25<span class="pl-smi">%</span></span><span class="pl-kos">,</span> <span class="pl-en">var</span>(<span class="pl-s1">--lqip-ca-clr</span>)<span class="pl-kos">,</span> transparent)<span class="pl-kos">,</span>
    <span class="pl-en">radial-gradient</span>(<span class="pl-c1">50<span class="pl-smi">%</span></span> <span class="pl-c1">75<span class="pl-smi">%</span></span> at <span class="pl-c1">50<span class="pl-smi">%</span></span> <span class="pl-c1">25<span class="pl-smi">%</span></span><span class="pl-kos">,</span> <span class="pl-en">var</span>(<span class="pl-s1">--lqip-cb-clr</span>)<span class="pl-kos">,</span> transparent)<span class="pl-kos">,</span>
    <span class="pl-c">/* ... */</span>
    <span class="pl-en">linear-gradient</span>(<span class="pl-c1">0<span class="pl-smi">deg</span></span><span class="pl-kos">,</span> <span class="pl-en">var</span>(<span class="pl-s1">--lqip-base-clr</span>)<span class="pl-kos">,</span> <span class="pl-en">var</span>(<span class="pl-s1">--lqip-base-clr</span>));

## Language evolves, so we must too. On generative art

date: 2025-04-03, from: Lean Rada's blog


<p>A year ago, I stood by the statement that <a href="https://leanrada.com/notes/ai-art-not-generative-art?ref=rss">AI Art is not Generative Art</a>, arguing that the term ‘generative art’ is an art movement in itself that is separate from AI art.</p>

<p>Safe to say, it has been a losing battle.</p>

<p>Even the converse, <em>“generative art is not necessarily AI art”</em>, would be met by confusion from most people. ‘Generative’ has been equated to AI.</p>

<img src="https://leanrada.com/notes/language-evolves-generative-art/the-other-day.png?ref=rss" loading="lazy" width="718" height="118">

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/generative/comments/1hks3sg/has_the_word_generative_been_hijacked_by_ai/" target="_blank">r/generative - Has the word 'generative' been hijacked by AI?</a></p>

<p>I think it's time to move on to a different label. Words are for
communication, and if a word results in failure of communication, we
should either agree on a common definition (we can’t) or just use better
word.</p>

<h2>So, what are the other words for this art?</h2>
<box-note>If you haven’t read the mentioned <a href="https://leanrada.com/notes/ai-art-not-generative-art?ref=rss" target="_blank">prequel post</a>, you may not understand what “art” I’m taliking about. There’s one example above, but <a href="https://leanrada.com/art?ref=rss" target="_blank">here’s more</a>.</box-note>
<p>Fortunately, there are already well-established terms to describe the
medium:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Procedural art
  </li><li>Algorithmic art
  </li><li>Creative coding
</li></ul>

<p>It’s just a matter of choosing one and leaving the now-loaded
‘generative’ term behind.</p>

<p>By the process of elimination, I think ‘procedural art’ is the best
term to use. Let me explain each of the other options.</p>

<h2>Why not Algorithmic</h2>

<p>‘Algorithmic art’ is a top candidate, for sure, and many others have <a href="https://monokai.com/articles/algorithmic-art-as-a-subset-of-generative-art" target="_blank">opted for it in the exodus from ‘generative’</a>. Algorithmic art and procedural art are pretty much synonymous, so why or why not?</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Unlike generative art, algorithmic art doesn’t
have the unfortunate connotation from sharing a word with ‘generative
AI’.</p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong> While ‘algorithmic art’ doesn’t immediately
invoke visions of generative AI, the term ‘algortihm’ under the broad definition
of a ‘set of instructions’ would still include machine learning
models.</p>

<p>In fact, the word ‘algorithm’ has also entered commonplace usage via
<strong>‘social media algorithms’</strong>, which are yet another application of machine
learning and statistics. In this sense, it is used interchangeably with
the recommender system used to construct personalised content feeds.
<em>“The algorithm”</em> is a black box, and the word <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/02/26/1020007/what-is-an-algorithm/" target="_blank">suggests a system beyond understanding</a>. This connotation is not in the spirit of procedural art, where the procedures are authored knowingly.</p>

<p>Another distinction is that while an algorithm is usually defined as a process that takes some <strong>input</strong> and processes it into an <strong>output</strong>, most procedural art programs don’t need inputs at all. They create things from scratch, from maths, from chaos. <small>OK, technically random seeds would be considerend input. But on a conceptual level, no inputs!</small></p>

<h2>Why not Creative Coding</h2>

<p>First of all, it’s such a vague phrase. Why not ‘dynamic
programming’? 😉</p>

<p>Anyway, that’s not the main point.</p>

<p>Procedural art has grown beyond <em>just coding</em>. I would even
say most procedural artists don't use code, but nodes and graphs. The
majority of these procedural art would be used in video games and movie
VFX.</p>

<p>Instead of coding, one would use <a href="https://pixieditor.net/blog/2024/07/12/devlog5#nodes" target="_blank">node-based programming</a> connecting
<strong>nodes</strong> that represent operations, building up a
<strong>graph</strong> to produce a complex image or even a
3D model.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://leanrada.com/notes/language-evolves-generative-art/nodes.jpg?ref=rss" alt="Node graph and its output" loading="lazy" width="1100" height="910">

</figure>

<p>And it’s not just for industrial VFX purposes. It’s also used mainly
for multimedia, interactive, and installation art.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://leanrada.com/notes/language-evolves-generative-art/sydney1_0.jpg?ref=rss" alt="Sydney Opera House with a projected image on it" loading="lazy" width="640" height="320">

(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKFxkqPdsoI" target="_blank">Picture from YouTube Symphony Orchestra</a>)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>So... yeah this genre of art, is not coding.</p>

<h2>OK, then why Procedural Art</h2>

<p>Because the ‘procedure’, the ‘how’ is the core feature of procedural art.</p>

<p>In procedural art, we describe precisely <strong>how</strong> the
artwork is made. And it’s far from describing to a chatbot in plain
English. The how is well-defined and understood. Every shape, stroke,
their positions, colours, ranges, constraints, rules of interaction,
etc., are all described in some precise way. Sometimes we go down to individual
pixel level as in a shader. Sometimes at a more geometric level, like in
turtle or vector graphics. Sometimes on a mathematical level, like
fractals. Sometimes it’s even a simulation with emergent properties!</p>

<p>Procedural art is more about the <em>process</em>, watching things unfold and emerge, rather than the final output that algorithms are obsessed about.</p>

<p>Procedural art is about the interaction of rules in interesting ways, regardless of whether the rules were written in code, or connected as a graph, or wired in redstone dust.</p>

<p>Finally, <em>procedural art is not AI art</em>. [Insert same exact argument as <a href="https://leanrada.com/notes/ai-art-not-generative-art?ref=rss" target="_blank">AI Art is not Generative Art</a> but with a different name, here]. For funsies, here’s a quick guide: <em>In AI art, you describe <strong>what</strong> the artwork should be. In procedural art, you describe <strong>how</strong> the artwork could be.</em></p>

<h2>What now</h2>

<p>Language evolves because of general usage. See: <em>AI, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/cryptocurrency-are-not-crypto-bitcoin/" target="_blank">crypto</a>,
cyber, generative</em>. As a fellow user of language, I must evolve my languaging as well — starting with this website.</p>

<p>I have updated the following pages to either disambiguate or even
completely replace mentions of “generative art”:</p>

<ul>
  <li>/art/</li>
  <li>/wares/dimensions/</li>
</ul>

<p>For the record, I’m not rejecting the other perfectly acceptable terms like algorithmic art and creative coding. My art is still algorithmic, and it’s the result of creative coding. I’m just moving away from ‘generative’.</p>

<p>I’m sure we’ll settle on a universal term soon. Language evolves, after all.</p>

## Earners vs Owners

date: 2025-04-02, from: Prof. Scott Galloway, No Mercy/No Malace blog

<p>It’s tax season in the U.S. At least 60 million Americans have taxes that are so simple, the IRS could do them automatically and just send them the bill.

## Composite primary keys in Django

date: 2025-04-02, updated: 2025-04-02, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/topics/composite-primary-key/">Composite primary keys in Django</a></strong></p>
Django 5.2 is <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2025/apr/02/django-52-released/">out today</a> and a big new feature is composite primary keys, which can now be defined like this:</p>
<pre><span class="pl-k">class</span> <span class="pl-v">Release</span>(<span class="pl-s1">models</span>.<span class="pl-c1">Model</span>):
    <span class="pl-s1">pk</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-s1">models</span>.<span class="pl-c1">CompositePrimaryKey</span>(
        <span class="pl-s">"version"</span>, <span class="pl-s">"name"</span>
    )
    <span class="pl-s1">version</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-s1">models</span>.<span class="pl-c1">IntegerField</span>()
    <span class="pl-s1">name</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-s1">models</span>.<span class="pl-c1">CharField</span>(<span class="pl-s1">max_length</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span><span class="pl-c1">20</span>)</pre>

<p>They don't yet work with the Django admin or as targets for foreign keys.</p>
<p>Other smaller new features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>All ORM models are now automatically imported into <code>./manage.py shell</code> - a feature borrowed from <code>./manage.py shell_plus</code> in <a href="https://django-extensions.readthedocs.io/">django-extensions</a></li>
<li>Feeds from the Django syndication framework can now specify <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/ref/contrib/syndication/#feed-stylesheets">XSLT stylesheets</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/ref/request-response/#django.http.HttpResponse.text">response.text</a> now returns the string representation of the body - I'm so happy about this, now I don't have to litter my Django tests with <code>response.content.decode("utf-8")</code> any more</li>
<li>a new <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/howto/custom-template-tags/#django.template.Library.simple_block_tag">simple_block_tag</a> helper making it much easier to create a custom Django template tag that further processes its own inner rendered content</li>
<li>A bunch more in the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/releases/5.2/">full release notes</a></li>
</ul>
<p>5.2 is also an LTS release, so it will receive security and data loss bug fixes up to April 2028.

## Half Stack Data Science: Programming with AI, with Simon Willison

date: 2025-04-01, updated: 2025-04-01, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://halfstackdatascience.com/s4e2-programming-with-ai-with-simon-willison">Half Stack Data Science: Programming with AI, with Simon Willison</a></strong></p>
I participated in this wide-ranging 50 minute conversation with David Asboth and Shaun McGirr. Topics we covered included applications of LLMs to data journalism, the challenges of building an intuition for how best to use these tool given their "jagged frontier" of capabilities, how LLMs impact learning to program and how local models are starting to get genuinely useful now.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://overcast.fm/+AAnGvyyrHkg/27:47">27:47</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you're a new programmer, my optimistic version is that there has never been a better time to learn to program, because it shaves down the learning curve so much. When you're learning to program and you miss a semicolon and you bang your head against the computer for four hours [...] if you're unlucky you quit programming for good because it was so frustrating. [...]</p>
<p>I've always been a project-oriented learner; I can learn things by building something, and now the friction involved in building something has gone down so much [...] So I think especially if you're an autodidact, if you're somebody who likes teaching yourself things, these are a gift from heaven. You get a weird teaching assistant that knows loads of stuff and occasionally makes weird mistakes and believes in bizarre conspiracy theories, but you have 24 hour access to that assistant.</p>
<p>If you're somebody who prefers structured learning in classrooms, I think the benefits are going to take a lot longer to get to you because we don't know how to use these things in classrooms yet. [...]</p>
<p>If you want to strike out on your own, this is an amazing tool <em>if</em> you learn how to learn with it. So you've got to learn the limits of what it can do, and you've got to be disciplined enough to make sure you're not outsourcing the bits you need to learn to the machines.</p>

## What's wrong with AI-generated docs

date: 2025-04-01, from: Blog by Fabrizio Ferri-Benedetti

<p>In what is tantamount to a <a href="https://tante.cc/2025/03/28/vulgar-display-of-power/">vulgar display of power</a>, social media has been flooded with AI-generated images that mimic the style of Hayao Miyazaki&rsquo;s anime. Something similar happens daily with tech writing, folks happily throwing context at LLMs and thinking they can vibe write outstanding docs out of them, perhaps even surpassing human writers. Well, it&rsquo;s time to draw a line. Don&rsquo;t let AI influencers <em>studioghiblify</em> your work as if it were a matter of processing text.</p>

## Pydantic Evals

date: 2025-04-01, updated: 2025-04-01, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://ai.pydantic.dev/evals/">Pydantic Evals</a></strong></p>
Brand new package from David Montague and the Pydantic AI team which directly tackles what I consider to be the single hardest problem in AI engineering: building evals to determine if your LLM-based system is working correctly and getting better over time.</p>
<p>The feature is described as "in beta" and comes with this very realistic warning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unlike unit tests, evals are an emerging art/science; anyone who claims to know for sure exactly how your evals should be defined can safely be ignored.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This code example from their documentation illustrates the relationship between the two key nouns - Cases and Datasets:</p>
<pre><span class="pl-k">from</span> <span class="pl-s1">pydantic_evals</span> <span class="pl-k">import</span> <span class="pl-v">Case</span>, <span class="pl-v">Dataset</span>

<span class="pl-s1">case1</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-en">Case</span>(
    <span class="pl-s1">name</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span><span class="pl-s">"simple_case"</span>,
    <span class="pl-s1">inputs</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span><span class="pl-s">"What is the capital of France?"</span>,
    <span class="pl-s1">expected_output</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span><span class="pl-s">"Paris"</span>,
    <span class="pl-s1">metadata</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span>{<span class="pl-s">"difficulty"</span>: <span class="pl-s">"easy"</span>},
)

<span class="pl-s1">dataset</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-en">Dataset</span>(<span class="pl-s1">cases</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span>[<span class="pl-s1">case1</span>])</pre>

<p>The library also supports custom evaluators, including LLM-as-a-judge:</p>
<pre><span class="pl-en">Case</span>(
    <span class="pl-s1">name</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span><span class="pl-s">"vegetarian_recipe"</span>,
    <span class="pl-s1">inputs</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span><span class="pl-en">CustomerOrder</span>(
        <span class="pl-s1">dish_name</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span><span class="pl-s">"Spaghetti Bolognese"</span>, <span class="pl-s1">dietary_restriction</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span><span class="pl-s">"vegetarian"</span>
    ),
    <span class="pl-s1">expected_output</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span><span class="pl-c1">None</span>,
    <span class="pl-s1">metadata</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span>{<span class="pl-s">"focus"</span>: <span class="pl-s">"vegetarian"</span>},
    <span class="pl-s1">evaluators</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span>(
        <span class="pl-en">LLMJudge</span>(
            <span class="pl-s1">rubric</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span><span class="pl-s">"Recipe should not contain meat or animal products"</span>,
        ),
    ),
)</pre>

<p>Cases and datasets can also be serialized to YAML.</p>
<p>My first impressions are that this looks like a solid implementation of a sensible design. I'm looking forward to trying it out against a real project.

## Why is everything so scalable?

<div class="pull-quote">Everyone is a FAANG engineer</div><p>I&#8217;m entirely convinced that basically every developer alive today heard the adage &#8220;dress for the job you want, not the job you have&#8221; and figured that, since they always wear jeans and a t-shirt anyway, they might as well apply it to their systems&#8217; architecture.

<p>They saw the best results overall from Claude 3.7 Sonnet against <a href="https://www.swebench.com/lite.html">SWE-bench Lite</a>, where it scored 37.2% in rewrite mode without a debugger, 48.4% with their debugger tool and 52.1% with debug(5) - a mechanism where the pdb tool is made available only after the 5th rewrite attempt.</p>
<p>Their code is <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/debug-gym">available on GitHub</a>. I found this implementation of <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/debug-gym/blob/1.0.0/debug_gym/gym/tools/pdb.py">the pdb tool</a>, and tracked down the main system and user prompt in <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/debug-gym/blob/1.0.0/debug_gym/agents/debug_agent.py">agents/debug_agent.py</a>:</p>
<p>System prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Your goal is to debug a Python program to make sure it can pass a set of test functions. You have access to the pdb debugger tools, you can use them to investigate the code, set breakpoints, and print necessary values to identify the bugs. Once you have gained enough information, propose a rewriting patch to fix the bugs. Avoid rewriting the entire code, focus on the bugs only.</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>User prompt (which they call an "action prompt"):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Based on the instruction, the current code, the last execution output, and the history information, continue your debugging process using pdb commands or to propose a patch using rewrite command. Output a single command, nothing else. Do not repeat your previous commands unless they can provide more information. You must be concise and avoid overthinking.</code></p>

## Summary of changes for March 2025

date: 2025-03-31, from: Hundred Rabbits blog

<p>Hey everyone!</p><p>This is the list of all the changes we've done to our projects during the month of March.</p>

<img src="../media/content/videos/march_2025.jpg" alt="little ninj, a plus ninja, is examining at the contents of a first-aid kit" loading="lazy">

<h2>Summary Of Changes</h2>

<p>In the above illustration, little Ninj is going through a <a href="https://rabbitwaves.ca/site/first_aid_kit.html" target="_blank">first-aid kit</a>, looking through our supplies to see what needs to be topped off and what is out-of-date. Rek drew a list of suggestions on what to include in both a first-aid and a medical kit for the Rabbit Waves project, we plan to add more items soon(thanks to everyone on Mastodon who suggested additions! It'll be in the April update).</p>

<p>We will spend the first few days of April participating in <a href="https://itch.io/jam/flickjam-2025" target="_blank">Flickjam</a>, making small games in the style of <a href="https://www.flickgame.org/index.html" target="_blank">Flickgame</a>, a tool originally made by Increpare, in which the world is navigated by clicking on pixels of different colors to head in different directions. Devine ported <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/flick.html" target="_blank">Flickgame to Varvara</a>, and wrote a compiler for flick games to uxn roms.</p>

<p>This past month, Rek finished transcribing the entire 15 weeks of the <a href="../site/victoria_to_sitka_logbook.html">Victoria to Sitka logbook</a>! We have plans to turn it into a book, in the style of <a href="../site/busy_doing_nothing.html">Busy Doing Nothing</a>, with tons of extra content and illustrations.</p>

<p>March was a very good month for silly <a href="https://rabbits.srht.site/days/2025/03/31.html" target="_blank">calendar doodles</a>. Our paper calendar is always in view, it documents important events like releases, appointments, as well as food, memes, and other noteworthy things that happened on each day.</p>

<p><b>Book Club:</b> This month we are still reading <i>The Goldfinch</i> by Donna Tartt(it's a long book).</p>

## Minimal CSS-only blurry image placeholders

date: 2025-03-30, from: Lean Rada's blog


<p>Here’s a CSS technique that produces blurry image placeholders (LQIPs) without cluttering up your markup — <em>Only a single custom property needed!</em></p>
<card-box>
  <code-block language="html">
    <pre><code>&lt;img src="…" style="--lqip:192900"&gt;</code></pre>
  </code-block>

  <p>The custom property above gives you this image:</p>

  <p>
  </p><div></div>
  <p></p>

  <label>
    Try changing the property’s value <strong>(WARNING: FLASHING)</strong>
    <input type="range" min="-999999" max="999999">
  </label>
  <script>
    {
      const card = document.currentScript.parentElement;
      const input = card.querySelector("input");
      const code = card.querySelector("code");
      const preview = card.querySelector("div");

      let currentValueStr = "192900";
      let targetCode = null

      input.addEventListener("input", event => {
        if (!targetCode) {
          targetCode = Array.from(code.querySelectorAll("span")).filter(el => el.textContent.includes(currentValueStr)).slice(-1)[0] ?? code;
        }

        const lqip = Number(event.currentTarget.value);
        // use this page's lqip to avoid breakage if I ever update the scheme
        preview.style.setProperty("--my-lqip", lqip);
        targetCode.innerHTML = targetCode.innerHTML.replace(currentValueStr, lqip);
        currentValueStr = String(lqip);
      });
    }
  </script>
</card-box>
<p>Granted, it’s a <em>very blurry</em> placeholder especially in contrast to other leading solutions. But the point is that it’s minimal and non-invasive! No need for wrapper elements or attributes with long strings of data, or JavaScript at all.</p>

<h2>Survey of LQIP approaches</h2>

<p>There have been many different techniques to implement LQIPs (low quality image placeholders), such as a very low
  resolution WebP or JPEG (<a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2015/08/06/android/the-technology-behind-preview-photos/" target="_blank">beheaded JPEGs</a> even), optimised SVG shape placements (<a href="https://github.com/axe312ger/sqip" target="_blank">SQIP</a>), and directly applying a discrete cosine
  transform (<a href="https://blurha.sh/" target="_blank">BlurHash</a>). Don’t forget good old progressive JPEGs and interlaced
  PNGs!</p>

  <figcaption>Canva and Pinterest use solid colour placeholders.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>At the other end of the spectrum, we have low tech solutions such as a simple solid fill of the image’s average colour.</p>

<p>Pure inline CSS solutions have the advantage rendering immediately — even a <code>background-image: url(…a data URL)</code> would be fine!</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://leanrada.com/notes/css-only-lqip/gradient-css.png?ref=rss" alt="image gallery with gradient placeholders" width="1368" height="832">
  <figcaption><a href="https://github.com/fraser-hemp/gradify" target="_blank">Gradify</a> generates linear-gradients
    that very roughly approximate the full image.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The big disadvantage of pure CSS approaches is that you typically litter your markup with lengthy inline styles or obnoxious data URLs. My handcoded site with no build step would be extra incompatible with this approach!</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!-- typical gradify css --&gt;
&lt;img width="200" height="150" style="
  background: linear-gradient(45deg, #f4a261, transparent),
    linear-gradient(-45deg, #e76f51, transparent),
    linear-gradient(90deg, #8ab17d, transparent),
    linear-gradient(0deg, #d62828, #023047);
"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong><a href="https://blurha.sh/">BlurHash</a></strong> is a solution that minimises markup by compressing image
  data into a
  <strong>short base-83 string</strong>, but decoding and rendering that data requires additional JS…
</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!-- a blurhash markup --&gt;
&lt;img width="200" height="150" src="…"
  data-blurhash="LEHV6nWB2yk8pyo0adR*.7kCMdnj"&gt;</code></pre>

  <img src="https://leanrada.com/notes/css-only-lqip/blurhash.png?ref=rss" width="276" height="171">
  <figcaption>BlurHash example</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Is it possible to decode a blur hash in CSS instead?</p>

<h2>Decoding in pure CSS</h2>

<p>Unlike BlurHash, we can’t use a string encoding because there are very few if any string manipulation
  functions in CSS (2025), so strings are out.</p>

<p>In the end, I came up with my own hash / encoding, and the <b>integer</b> type was the best vessel for it.</p>

<p>The usual way to encode stuff in a single integer is by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_manipulation" target="_blank"><strong>bit packing</strong></a>, where you pack multiple numbers in an integer as bits. Amazingly, we can unpack them in pure CSS!</p>

<p>To unpack bits, all you need is bit shifting and bit masking. <strong>Bit shifting</strong> can be done by division and floor operations — <code>calc(x / y)</code> and <code>round(down,n)</code> — and <strong>bit masking</strong> via the modulo function <code>mod(a,b)</code>.</p>

<pre><code>* {
/* Example packed int: */
/* 0b11_00_001_101 */
--packed-int: 781;
--bits-9-10: mod(round(down, calc(var(--packed-int) / 256)), 4); /* 3 */
--bits-7-8: mod(round(down, calc(var(--packed-int) / 64)), 4); /* 0 */
--bits-4-6: mod(round(down, calc(var(--packed-int) / 8)), 8); /* 1 */
--bits-0-3: mod(var(--packed-int), 8); /* 5 */
}</code></pre>

<p>Of course, we could also use <code>pow(2,n)</code> instead of hardcoded powers of two.</p>

<p>So, a <strong>single CSS integer value</strong> was going to be the encoding of the “hash” of my CSS-only blobhash
  (that’s what I’m calling it now). But how much information can we pack in a single CSS int?</p>

<h2>Side quest: Limits of CSS values</h2>

<p>The spec doesn’t say anything about the allowed range for int values, leaving the fate of my shenanigans to browser vendors.</p>

<p>From my experiments, apparently you can only use integers from <strong>-999,999 up to 999,999</strong> in custom
  properties before you lose precision. Just beyond that limit, we start getting values rounded to tens —
  1,234,56<del>7</del> becomes 1,234,56<ins>0</ins>. Which is weird (precision is counted in decimal places!?), but I
  bet it’s due to historical, Internet Explorer-esque reasons.</p>

<p>Anyway, within the range of [-999999, 999999] there are <strong>1,999,999</strong> values. This meant that with a
  single integer hash, almost two million LQIP configurations could be described. To make calculation
  easier, I reduced it to the nearest power of two down which is 2<sup>20</sup>.</p>
<card-box>
  <code>2<sup>20</sup> = 1,048,576 &lt; 1,999,999 &lt; 2,097,152 = 2<sup>21</sup></code>
</card-box>
<p><strong>In short, I had 20 bits of information to encode the CSS-based LQIP hash.</strong></p>
<box-note><strong>Why is it called a “hash”?</strong> Because it’s a mapping from an any-size data to a fixed-size
  value. In this case, there are an infinite number of images of arbitrary sizes, but only 1,999,999 possible hash
  values.</box-note>
<h2>The Scheme</h2>

<p>With only 20 bits, the LQIP image must be a very simplified version of the full image. I ended up with this scheme:
  a single base colour + 6 brightness components, to be overlaid on top of the base colour in a 3×2 grid. A
  rather extreme version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroma_subsampling" target="_blank">chroma
    subsampling</a>.</p>

<img src="https://leanrada.com/notes/css-only-lqip/scheme.png?ref=rss" alt="illustration of encoded components" width="600" height="500">

<p>This totals <strong>9 numbers</strong> to pack into the 20-bit integer:</p>

<p>The <strong>base colour</strong> is encoded in the <strong>lower 8 bits</strong> in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklab_color_space" target="_blank">Oklab colour space</a>. 2 bits for luminance, and 3 bits for each of the a and b coordinates. I’ve found Oklab to give subjectively balanced results, but RGB should work just as well.</p>

<p>The <strong>6 greyscale components</strong> are encoded in the <strong>higher 12 bits</strong> — 2 bits each.</p>

<p>An offline script was created to compress any given image into this integer format. The script was quite simple: Get the average
  or dominant colour — there are a lot of libraries that can do that — then resize the image down to
  3×2 pixels and get the greyscale values. <a href="https://github.com/Kalabasa/leanrada.com/blob/7b6739c7c30c66c771fcbc9e1dc8942e628c5024/main/scripts/update/lqip.mjs#L118-L159" target="_blank">Here’s my script.</a></p>
<box-note>I even tried a <a href="https://blog.4dcu.be/programming/2020/01/12/Genetic-Art-Algorithm.html" target="_blank">genetic algorithm</a> to optimise the LQIP bits, but the fitness function was hard to establish. Ultimately, I would’ve needed an offline CSS renderer for this to work accurately. Maybe a future iteration could use some headless Chrome solution to automatically compare real renderings of the LQIP against the source image.</box-note>
<p>Once encoded, it’s set as the value of <code>--lqip</code> via the style attribute in the target element. It could then be decoded in CSS. Here’s the actual code I used for decoding:</p>

<pre><code>[style*="--lqip:"] {
--lqip-ca: mod(round(down, calc((var(--lqip) + pow(2, 19)) / pow(2, 18))), 4);
--lqip-cb: mod(round(down, calc((var(--lqip) + pow(2, 19)) / pow(2, 16))), 4);
--lqip-cc: mod(round(down, calc((var(--lqip) + pow(2, 19)) / pow(2, 14))), 4);
--lqip-cd: mod(round(down, calc((var(--lqip) + pow(2, 19)) / pow(2, 12))), 4);
--lqip-ce: mod(round(down, calc((var(--lqip) + pow(2, 19)) / pow(2, 10))), 4);
--lqip-cf: mod(round(down, calc((var(--lqip) + pow(2, 19)) / pow(2, 8))), 4);
--lqip-ll: mod(round(down, calc((var(--lqip) + pow(2, 19)) / pow(2, 6))), 4);
--lqip-aaa: mod(round(down, calc((var(--lqip) + pow(2, 19)) / pow(2, 3))), 8);
--lqip-bbb: mod(calc(var(--lqip) + pow(2, 19)), 8);</code></pre>

<p>Before rendering the decoded values, the raw number data values need to be converted to CSS colours. It’s fairly
  straightforward, just a bunch linear interpolations into colour constructor functions.</p>

<pre><code>/* continued */
--lqip-ca-clr: hsl(0 0% calc(var(--lqip-ca) / 3 * 100%));
--lqip-cb-clr: hsl(0 0% calc(var(--lqip-cb) / 3 * 100%));
--lqip-cc-clr: hsl(0 0% calc(var(--lqip-cc) / 3 * 100%));
--lqip-cd-clr: hsl(0 0% calc(var(--lqip-cd) / 3 * 100%));
--lqip-ce-clr: hsl(0 0% calc(var(--lqip-ce) / 3 * 100%));
--lqip-cf-clr: hsl(0 0% calc(var(--lqip-cf) / 3 * 100%));
--lqip-base-clr: oklab(
  calc(var(--lqip-ll) / 3 * 0.6 + 0.2)
  calc(var(--lqip-aaa) / 8 * 0.7 - 0.35)
  calc((var(--lqip-bbb) + 1) / 8 * 0.7 - 0.35)
);
}</code></pre>
<card-box>
  <strong>Time for another demo!</strong>
  <label>
    Try different values of <code>--lqip</code> to decode
    <input type="range" min="-999999" max="999999">
  </label>
  <p>
    <code></code>
  </p>
  <script>
    {
      const card = document.currentScript.parentElement;
      const input = card.querySelector("input");
      const preview = card.querySelector(".lqip-unpack").parentElement;

      let currentValueStr = "-721311";
      render(Number(currentValueStr));

      input.addEventListener("input", event => {
        const lqip = Number(event.currentTarget.value);
        render(lqip);
        currentValueStr = String(lqip);
      });

      function render(lqip) {
        preview.style.setProperty("--my-lqip", lqip);
      };
    }
  </script>
  

  You can see here how each component variable maps to the LQIP image. E.g. the <code>cb</code> value corresponds to
  the relative brightness of the top middle area. <em>Fun fact: The above preview content is implemented in pure
    CSS!</em>
</card-box>
<h2>Rendering it all</h2>

<p>Finally, rendering the LQIP. I used multiple <strong>radial gradients</strong> to render the greyscale components,
  and a flat base colour at the bottom.</p>

<pre><code>[style*="--lqip:"] {
background-image:
  radial-gradient(50% 75% at 16.67% 25%, var(--lqip-ca-clr), transparent),
  radial-gradient(50% 75% at 50% 25%, var(--lqip-cb-clr), transparent),
  radial-gradient(50% 75% at 83.33% 25%, var(--lqip-cc-clr), transparent),
  radial-gradient(50% 75% at 16.67% 75%, var(--lqip-cd-clr), transparent),
  radial-gradient(50% 75% at 50% 75%, var(--lqip-ce-clr), transparent),
  radial-gradient(50% 75% at 83.33% 75%, var(--lqip-cf-clr), transparent),
  linear-gradient(0deg, var(--lqip-base-clr), var(--lqip-base-clr));
}</code></pre>

<p>The above is a simplified version of the full renderer for illustrative purposes. <small>The real one has doubled layers, smooth gradient falloffs, and blend modes.</small></p>

<p>As you might expect, the radial gradients are arranged in a 3×2 grid. You can see it in this interactive deconstructor view!</p>
<card-box>
  <strong>LQIP deconstructor!</strong>
  <label>
    Reveal the individual layers using this slider!
    <input type="range" min="0" max="100" value="0">
    Change the <code>--lqip</code> value,
    <input type="range" min="-999999" max="999999">
  </label>
  <div></div>
  <script>
    {
      const card = document.currentScript.parentElement;
      const [revealInput, lqipInput] = card.querySelectorAll("input");
      const preview = card.querySelector(".lqip-reveal");

      let currentValueStr = "-747540";
      render(Number(currentValueStr));

      lqipInput.addEventListener("input", event => {
        const lqip = Number(event.currentTarget.value);
        render(lqip);
        currentValueStr = String(lqip);
      });

      revealInput.addEventListener("input", event => {
        preview.style.setProperty("--reveal", event.currentTarget.value / 100);
      });

      function render(lqip) {
        preview.style.setProperty("--my-lqip", lqip);
      };
    }
  </script>
  
</card-box>
<p>These radial gradients are the core of the CSS-based LQIP. The position and radius of the gradients are an important detail that would determine how well these can approximate real images. Besides that, another requirement is that these individual radial gradients must be seamless when combined together.</p>

<p>I implemented smooth gradient falloffs to make the final result look seamless. It took special care to make the gradients extra smooth, so let’s dive into it…</p>

<h2>Bilinear interpolation approximation with radial gradients</h2>

<p>Radial gradients use linear interpolation by default. Interpolation refers to how it maps the in-between colours from the start colour to the end colour. And linear interpolation, the most basic interpolation, well…</p>

<figure>
  <interpolation-example></interpolation-example>
  <figcaption>CSS radial-gradients with linear interpolation</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It doesn’t look good. It gives us these hard edges (highlighted above). You could almost see the elliptical edges of each radial gradient and their centers.</p>

<p>In real raster images, we’d use <a href="https://harmoniccode.blogspot.com/2011/04/bilinear-color-interpolation.html" target="_blank">bilinear interpolation</a> at the very least when scaling up low resolution images. <a href="https://blog.demofox.org/2015/08/15/resizing-images-with-bicubic-interpolation/" target="_blank">Bicubic interpolation is even better.</a></p>

<p>One way to simulate the smoothness of bilinear interpolation in an array of CSS radial-gradients is to use <strong>‘quadratic easing’</strong> to control the gradation of opacity.</p>

<p>This means the opacity falloff of the gradient would be smoother around the center and the edges. Each gradient would get feathered edges, smoothening the overall composite image.</p>

<p>However, CSS gradients <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/1332" target="_blank">don’t support nonlinear interpolation of opacity yet as of writing</a> (not to be confused with colour space interpolation, which browsers do support!). The solution for now is to add more points in the gradient to get a smooth opacity curve based on the quadratic formula.</p>

<pre><code>radial-gradient(
  &lt;position&gt;,
  rgb(82 190 240 / 100%) 0%,
  rgb(82 190 204 / 98%) 10%,
  rgb(82 190 204 / 92%) 20%,
  rgb(82 190 204 / 82%) 30%,
  rgb(82 190 204 / 68%) 40%,
  rgb(82 190 204 / 32%) 60%,
  rgb(82 190 204 / 18%) 70%,
  rgb(82 190 204 / 8%) 80%,
  rgb(82 190 204 / 2%) 90%,
  transparent 100%
)</code></pre>

<figure>
  <img src="https://leanrada.com/notes/css-only-lqip/interpolation-graph.png?ref=rss" width="1024" height="768">
  <figcaption>The quadratic interpolation is based on two quadratic curves (parabolas), one for each half of the gradient — one upward and another downward.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The quadratic easing blends adjacent radial gradients together, mimicking the smooth bilinear (or even bicubic) interpolation. It’s almost like a fake blur filter, thus achieving the ‘blur’ part of this BlurHash alternative.</p>

<h2>Appendix: Alternatives considered</h2>

<h3>Four colours instead of monochromatic preview</h3>

<p>Four 5-bit colours, where each <b>R</b> is 2 bits, <b>G</b> is 2 bits, and <b>B</b> is just a zero or one.</p>

<p>The four colours would map to the four corners of the image box, rendered as radial gradients</p>

<p>This was my first attempt, and I fiddled with this for a while, but mixing four colours properly require proper bilinear interpolation and probably a shader. Just layering gradients resulted in muddiness (just like mixing too many watercolour pigments), and there was no CSS blend mode that could fix it. So I abandoned it, and moved on to a monochromatic approach.</p>

<h3>Single solid colour</h3>

<p>This was what I used on this website before. It’s simple and effective. A clean-markup approach could still use the custom <code>--lqip</code> variable:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img src="…" style="--lqip:#9bc28e"&gt;

&lt;style&gt;
/* we save some bytes by ‘aliasing’ this property */
* { background-color: var(--lqip) }
&lt;/style&gt;</code></pre>

<h3>HTML attribute instead of CSS custom property</h3>

<p>We can use HTML attributes to control CSS soon! Here’s what the LQIP markup would look like in the future:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img src="…" lqip="192900"&gt;</code></pre>

<p>Waiting for <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/advanced-attr" target="_blank"><code>attr()</code> Level 5</a> for this one. It’s nicer and shorter, fewer weird punctuations in markup <small>(who came up with the double dash for CSS vars anyway?)</small>. The value can then be referenced in CSS with <code>attr(lqip type(&lt;number&gt;))</code> instead of <code>var(--lqip)</code>.</p>

<p>For extra safety, a <code>data-</code> prefix could be added to the attribute name.</p>

<p>Can’t wait for this to get widespread adoption. I also want it for my <a href="https://jordanbrennan.hashnode.dev/tac-a-new-css-methodology" target="_blank">TAC components</a>.</p>
