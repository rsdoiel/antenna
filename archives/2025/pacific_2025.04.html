Europe is dotted with fascinating monuments and powerful memorials that&amp;#8217;ve been thoughtfully designed to bring those sobering lessons home. When we track the struggles of democracy on both sides of the Atlantic today, we can see that those intent on derailing democracy read from the same playbook.&lt;/p&gt;
