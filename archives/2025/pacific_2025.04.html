<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;HONOLULU &amp;#8212; It was a moment of triumph. At a rally in Honolulu in 2002, Tulsi Gabbard wore an orchid lei as she celebrated her victory as the youngest-ever member of the Hawaii state Legislature. She had dropped out of community college to run, and Gabbard, then 21, was embarking on what would become a dizzying political journey from anti-gay conservative to Democratic Party star to a celebrity in President Donald Trump&amp;#8217;s world.&lt;/p&gt;

Visiting Europe’s 20th century fascist sites</h2>

Europe is dotted with fascinating monuments and powerful memorials that&amp;#8217;ve been thoughtfully designed to bring those sobering lessons home. When we track the struggles of democracy on both sides of the Atlantic today, we can see that those intent on derailing democracy read from the same playbook.&lt;/p&gt;
