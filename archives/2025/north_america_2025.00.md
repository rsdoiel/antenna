## When EVs Become Vehicles for Terror

He had rented the truck in Houston using the peer-to-peer app Turo, which allows anyone to post their own vehicle for someone else to borrow.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/02/us/tesla-cybertruck-trump-hotel-wwk-hnk/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Las Vegas</u></a>, the bed of a Tesla Cybertruck — also rented from Turo — exploded outside of the Trump Hotel, killing the driver and injuring seven. The EV truck, which was loaded down with fireworks, gasoline, and camping fuel, was reportedly driven by an active-duty member of U.S. Army Special Operations.</p><p>It could turn out to be a coincidence that both horrendous incidents were carried out with electric vehicles. For now, though, it’s easy to wonder whether this was a deliberate choice — if the perpetrators of what might turn out to be acts of terrorism chose EVs on purpose to cause maximum damage, especially knowing that both trucks were rented specifically for these insidious ends.</p><p>One undeniable fact is that <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/electric-truck-lucid-rivian-cybertruck-tesla" target="_self"><u>EV pickups</u></a> such as the F-150 Lightning and Cybertruck are big, heavy, and powerful. The Ford has a curb weight exceeding 6,000 pounds, with the enormous battery needed to power it making the EV heavier than the gas-powered version of the best-selling truck. The Tesla also <a href="https://www.tesla.com/ownersmanual/cybertruck/en_us/GUID-12A976DD-EB60-431B-AFF1-5A37E95006DB.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>tips the scale</u></a> at more than 3 tons.</p><p>The ever-growing girth of the American car is already a known <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/06/26/1184034017/us-pedestrian-deaths-high-traffic-car" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>public safety hazard</u></a>. The big trucks and SUVs that dominate our roads are increasingly dangerous to pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles given their weight and a driver’s difficulty in monitoring their surroundings. </p><p>The electrification movement has complicated this issue even more, since putting a big battery in a big vehicle makes it even heavier. Plus, EVs are remarkably powerful. All of their torque is available from a standstill, as opposed to combustion vehicles, which need time to rev up. This is what allows EVs to accelerate so quickly from a stop. </p><p>To put it in stark terms, an electric pickup truck has <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/news/2023-ford-f150-lightning-ev-turo-rental/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>exactly the attributes</u></a> that would appeal to someone who wanted to launch a terrorist attack on a crowd of people.</p><p>The other much-discussed safety issue for EVs is whether their batteries are a hazard because of potential fire danger. As <em><em>InsideEVs</em></em> <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/736222/ev-myths-fires/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>notes</u></a>, EV blazes are statistically rarer than those involving ordinary gas vehicles — they just seem more common because they get more sensationalized news coverage — however they can also be more difficult to extinguish because of the energy released when a lithium-ion battery ignites. </p><p>This problem seems pertinent in light of the Cybertruck attack in Vegas, where the driver reportedly loaded down the truck with incendiary material in the apparent hope of creating an out-of-control blaze. For what it’s worth, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/745948/tesla-cybertruck-fire-trump-vegas/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said</u></a> the blast was caused by the incendiary material loaded into the Cybertruck and not anything to do with the vehicle itself, and argued the EV’s stainless steel frame helped contain the explosion.</p><p>Then there are the increasingly weird politics of EVs. It’s impossible not to look at a Tesla detonating outside Donald Trump’s casino and see <em><em>some</em></em> kind of statement about Musk’s support for the president-elect (and growing influence over the American government). Where once EVs were the car of choice for the climate-aware, now we have a big metal electric truck that communicates a right-wing worldview as it barrels around town.</p><p>“It’s a Tesla truck, and we know that Elon Musk is working with President-elect Trump, and it’s the Trump Tower,” Kevin McMahill, sheriff of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, told reporters. “So, there’s obviously things to be concerned about there, and that’s something we continue to look at.”</p><p>We’ve covered at length some of the things <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/arguments-against-evs-bad" target="_self"><u>EVs can do that gas cars can’t</u></a>. They can use the energy in their batteries to back up your home in case of power outage, or air-condition your dog while you run into the store. But as EVs become more prevalent around the country, it seems we now have to worry about whether their downsides will be used in the worst ways imaginable.</p>

## US appeals court blocks Biden administration effort to restore net neutrality rules

date: 2025-01-02, from: VOA News USA

Washington — A U.S. appeals court ruled on Thursday the Federal Communications Commission did not have legal authority to reinstate landmark net neutrality rules.


The decision is a blow to the outgoing Biden administration that had made restoring the open internet rules a priority. President Joe Biden signed a 2021 executive order encouraging the FCC to reinstate the rules.


A three-judge panel of the Cincinnati-based 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the FCC lacked authority to reinstate the rules initially implemented in 2015 by the agency under Democratic former President Barack Obama, but then repealed by the commission in 2017 under Republican former President Donald Trump.


Net-neutrality rules require internet service providers to treat internet data and users equally rather than restricting access, slowing speeds or blocking content for certain users. The rules also forbid special arrangements in which ISPs give improved network speeds or access to favored users.


The court cited the Supreme Court's June decision in a case known as Loper Bright to overturn a 1984 precedent that had given deference to government agencies in interpreting laws they administer, in the latest decision to curb the authority of federal agencies. "Applying Loper Bright means we can end the FCC’s vacillations," the court ruled.


The decision leaves in place state neutrality rules adopted by California and others but may end more than 20 years of efforts to give federal regulators sweeping oversight over the internet.


FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel called on Congress to act after the decision. "Consumers across the country have told us again and again that they want an internet that is fast, open, and fair. With this decision it is clear that Congress now needs to heed their call, take up the charge for net neutrality, and put open internet principles in federal law," Rosenworcel said in a statement.


The FCC voted in April along party lines to reassume regulatory oversight of broadband internet and reinstate open internet rules. Industry groups filed suit and successfully convinced the court to temporarily block the rules as they considered the case.


Incoming FCC Chair Brendan Carr voted against the reinstatement last year. He did not immediately comment on Thursday.


Former FCC Chair Ajit Pai said the court ruling should mean the end of efforts to reinstate the rules, and a focus shift to "what actually matters to American consumers - like improving Internet access and promoting online innovation."


The Trump administration is unlikely to appeal the decision but net-neutrality advocates could seek review by the Supreme Court.


The rules would have given the FCC new tools to crack down on Chinese telecom companies and the ability to monitor internet service outages.


A group representing companies including Amazon.com AMZN.O, Apple AAPL.O, Alphabet GOOGL.O and Meta Platforms META.O had backed the FCC net-neutrality rules, while USTelecom, an industry group whose members include AT&T T.N and Verizon VZ.N, last year called reinstating net neutrality "entirely counterproductive, unnecessary, and an anti-consumer regulatory distraction."

## Man who died in Las Vegas Cybertruck was shot in head before explosion, sheriff says

date: 2025-01-02, from: VOA News USA

LAS VEGAS, NEVADA — The person inside the Tesla Cybertruck blown up outside President-elect Donald Trump's Las Vegas hotel suffered a gunshot to the head before the explosion, Clark County Sheriff Kevin McMahill said Thursday. McMahill said a handgun was found at his feet. 


The man inside was identified as Matthew Livelsberger, an active-duty U.S. Army soldier and member of its elite Green Berets. He has served in the Army since 2006, rising through the ranks, and was on approved leave when he died, the Pentagon said. 


He was awarded two Bronze Stars, including one with a valor device for courage under fire, a combat infantry badge and an Army Commendation Medal with valor. 


The FBI said Thursday in a post on X that it was "conducting law enforcement activity" at a home in Colorado Springs related to Wednesday's explosion but provided no other details. 


The explosion of the truck, packed with firework mortars and camp fuel canisters, came hours after 42-year-old Shamsud-Din Jabbar rammed a truck into a crowd in New Orleans' famed French Quarter early on New Year's Day, killing at least 14 people before being shot to death by police.  


Both Livelsberger and Jabbar spent time at the base formerly known as Fort Bragg, a massive Army base in North Carolina that is home to multiple Army special operations units. However, one of the officials who spoke to the AP said there is no overlap in their assignments at the base, now called Fort Liberty. 


Chris Raia, FBI deputy assistant director, said Thursday that officials have found "no definitive link" between the New Orleans attack and the truck explosion in Las Vegas. 


Seven people nearby suffered minor injuries when the Tesla truck exploded. Video showed a tumble of charred firework mortars, canisters and other explosive devices crowded into the back of the pickup. The truck bed walls were still intact because the blast shot straight up rather than to the sides. 


Tesla CEO Elon Musk said Wednesday afternoon on X that "we have now confirmed that the explosion was caused by very large fireworks and/or a bomb carried in the bed of the rented Cybertruck and is unrelated to the vehicle itself." 


"All vehicle telemetry was positive at the time of the explosion," Musk wrote. 


Musk has recently become a member of Trump's inner circle. Neither Trump nor Musk was in Las Vegas early Wednesday. Both had attended Trump's New Year's Eve party at his South Florida estate. 


Authorities know who rented the truck with the Turo app in Colorado, the sheriff of Clark County, which includes Las Vegas, said Wednesday. He did not release the person's ID, however.

## Tesla Sales Are Low Key Falling Off

That represents a decline in annual sales from 2023 — Tesla’s first annual decline in more than 10 years, back when the company’s deliveries were counted in the hundreds or single-digit thousands — although the fourth quarter figure is a record for quarterly deliveries.</p><p>Analysts polled by Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-31/tesla-stock-surge-runs-up-against-a-potential-annual-sales-drop" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>expected 510,400 deliveries</u></a> for the fourth quarter, while Tesla had <a href="https://digitalassets.tesla.com/tesla-contents/image/upload/IR/TSLA-Q3-2024-Update.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>forecast around 515,000 deliveries</u></a> to meet its “slight growth” goals. The company had cited “sustained macroeconomic headwinds” weighing on the broader electric vehicle market in its most recent investor letter, and again referred to “ongoing macroeconomic conditions” to explain the miss on deliveries. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Tesla deliveries stood at 484,507, with 1,808,581 for the year as a whole.</p><p>Going forward, Tesla buyers in the United States are likely to lose out on up to $7,500 in federal subsidies as the incoming Trump administration puts its stamp on energy and environmental policy. Tesla’s chief executive, Elon Musk, has <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/musk-trump-tesla-tax-credits" target="_self"><u>supported ditching EV credits</u></a>.</p><p>The below-expectations deliveries dragged on the stock, which traded down more than 4.5% in early trading Thursday. Tesla shares have otherwise been on a tear, rising around 75% in the last six months before today, with especially torrid performance following the 2024 United States presidential election.</p><p>The Chinese car company BYD is in a virtual tie with Tesla for annual battery electric vehicle sales, <a href="https://www.bydglobal.com/sitesresources/common/tools/generic/web/viewer.html?file=%2Fsites%2FSatellite%2FBYD%20PDF%20Viewer%3Fblobcol%3Durldata%26blobheader%3Dapplication%252Fpdf%26blobkey%3Did%26blobtable%3DMungoBlobs%26blobwhere%3D1638928484684%26ssbinary%3Dtrue" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>with 1,764,992</u></a> delivered in 2024, the company announced Wednesday. While Tesla’s 2024 sales confirm that the U.S. company maintains a narrow lead over BYD, the Chinese automaker’s sales are growing at a rapid clip — electric sales increased by over 12% for the year, compared to the slight fall in Tesla sales from 2023 to 2024.</p><p>While Tesla’s car business appears to have stalled to some extent — though it was buoyed by the release of a new model, the Cybertruck, which is already <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-cybertruck-us-3rd-best-selling-ev-q3-2024-model-3-model-y/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the third best-selling electric vehicle in the United States</u></a> — the company’s energy storage business is another story. The company said that in the fourth quarter of last year it had deployed 11 gigawatt-hours of storage, and 31.4 gigawatt-hours in the year as a whole. If Tesla’s deployment rate in 2025 merely matched its fourth quarter rate, it would mean 40% annual growth.</p>

Both incidents involved electric pickups. In New Orleans, a man drove a Ford F-150 Lightning into a crowd in the French Quarter, killing 15 people and injuring dozens of others. In Vegas, a Tesla Cybertruck packed with explosives detonated outside the Trump International Hotel, killing the driver and injuring seven others. Both vehicles were rented through a budget app called Turo. Electric vehicles tend to be heavier than their internal combustion counterparts, mostly due to their battery packs. This can make them particularly deadly in collisions with smaller vehicles and, of course, pedestrians.

In a post on X, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said: “The evil knuckleheads picked the wrong vehicle for a terrorist attack.”</p><h3><span></span>2. Hydrogen tax credit guidance expected this week</h3><p>The Biden administration plans to release guidance for hydrogen production tax credits this week, likely on Friday, two sources <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/us-issue-hydrogen-credit-rule-this-week-with-path-nuclear-sources-say-2024-12-31/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8YOKPUxcLudIlpXCDcGtH--rNNHvYbSplaztXrQR2PDDzHX2n-_RQkMCtDsl7OyDqm2mA6" target="_blank">told</a> <em>Reuters</em>. The guidance will “provide a pathway” for tax credits for hydrogen producers that use nuclear power, the outlet reported. Back in October, Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/final-hydrogen-tax-credit-45v?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8YOKPUxcLudIlpXCDcGtH--rNNHvYbSplaztXrQR2PDDzHX2n-_RQkMCtDsl7OyDqm2mA6" rel="noopener" target="_self">told Heatmap</a> the rules would be out by the end of 2024. As Heatmap’s Robinson Meyer explained, the Treasury Department’s must decide how hydrogen producers who use electrolysis — sending electricity through water to split its molecules — should deal with the indirect carbon emissions associated with drawing power from the grid. “Finalizing rules that will help scale the clean hydrogen industry while implementing the environmental safeguards established in the law remains a top priority for Treasury,” spokesperson Michael Martinez told <em><em>Reuters</em></em>. “In that process, we are carefully considering the numerous comments we have received on the proposed regulations.” In his conversation with Heatmap, Adeyemo acknowledged that the final rules were unlikely to please everyone.</p><h3>3. A brief look back at 2024 extreme weather...</h3><p>Climate change meant that there were about 41 more “extreme heat” days in 2024, <a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/when-risks-become-reality-extreme-weather-in-2024/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8YOKPUxcLudIlpXCDcGtH--rNNHvYbSplaztXrQR2PDDzHX2n-_RQkMCtDsl7OyDqm2mA6" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to</a> the World Weather Attribution’s annual extreme weather report. Climate change contributed to at least 3,700 deaths, but “it’s likely the total number of people killed in extreme weather events intensified by climate change [in 2024] is in the tens, or hundreds of thousands,” the group said. While the El Niño weather pattern contributed to global trends, climate change played a bigger role in fueling extreme weather. “As the planet warms, the influence of climate change increasingly overrides other natural phenomena affecting the weather,” the report added.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

## The Middle East's Next Aftershocks

date: 2025-01-02, updated: 2025-01-02, from: RAND blog

In December 2023, a former Israeli intelligence official described the October 7 Hamas attack as an “earthquake,” leading to significant shifts in the Middle East. As Hamas and Hezbollah weakened, the Houthis and Iran emerged as new threats, complicating U.S. efforts to disengage from the region.

## Biden honoring 20 Americans with Presidential Citizens Medal

date: 2025-01-02, from: VOA News USA

U.S. President Joe Biden is set to award the nation’s second highest civilian honor to 20 people at a White House ceremony Thursday.


The recipients of the Presidential Citizens Medal include Congressman Bennie Thompson and former Congresswoman Elizabeth Cheney, who led a congressional investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob seeking to disrupt the certification of Biden’s 2020 election win over Donald Trump.


Trump, who won the 2024 election for a new term starting later this month, has said Thompson and Cheney should be jailed.


A White House statement about Thursday’s honorees said Cheney, a Republican, “raised her voice — and reached across the aisle — to defend our Nation and the ideals we stand for: Freedom. Dignity. And decency.”


The statement said Thompson was “at the forefront of defending the rule of law with unwavering integrity and a steadfast commitment to truth.”


Created in 1969, the Presidential Citizens Medal honors citizens “who have performed exemplary deeds of service for their country or their fellow citizens.”


“President Biden believes these Americans are bonded by their common decency and commitment to serving others,” the White House said. “The country is better because of their dedication and sacrifice.”


Also being honored Thursday are Mary Bonauto and Evan Wolfson, who worked to legalize same-sex marriage in the United States.


Frank Butler is another medal recipient, with the White House highlighting his effort to set standards for the use of tourniquets and saying he “transformed battlefield trauma care for the United States military and saved countless lives.”


Mitsuye Endo Tsutsumi is being honored for her successful legal challenge against the imprisonment of Japanese Americans during World War II.


Biden is honoring Eleanor Smeal for her work in leading women’s rights protests and fighting for equal pay for women.


Medals are being awarded to a former congresswoman, Carolyn McCarthy, and a group of former U.S. senators: Bill Bradley, Chris Dodd, Nancy Kassebaum and Ted Kaufman.


Other honorees include Diane Carlson Evans, founder of the Vietnam Women’s Memorial Foundation, war correspondent Joseph Galloway, civil rights advocate Louis Redding and photographer Bobby Sager.


Judge Collins Seitz, Fulbright University Vietnam founder Thomas Vallely, breast cancer research advocate Frances Visco and Savannah College of Art and Design founder Paula Wallace are also receiving the Presidential Citizens Medal.

## Inside the Mind of Energy Nominee Chris Wright

date: 2025-01-02, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTM4MzExOS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0NzM2MDk4N30.zEy-gw2UO2BBMb2EDp7jPzt_gC33NmYGmWSVo_3oE18/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	Donald Trump’s nominee for Secretary of Energy, Chris Wright, is a nerd — and he’ll tell you about it. “I’m Chris Wright, and my short bio is, I started out as a science geek, I transitioned to a tech nerd, and then I’ve been an energy entrepreneur my whole life,” he <a href="https://robertbryce.com/episode/chris-wright-ceo-and-chairman-of-liberty-energy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>told energy journalist Robert Bryce</u></a> on the <em>Power Hungry </em>podcast in 2020. “In addition to an energy nerd, I’ve been a climate nerd for quite some time,” he said in a <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/there-is-a-design-problem-in-climate-policy/id1605818635?i=1000629625806" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>talk hosted by Veriten</u></a>, the energy consulting firm in 2023.
</p><p>
	This is a far cry from Trump’s first Energy Secretary, the former Texas Governor Rick Perry, who famously failed to remember on the Republican primary debate stage the third of the three agencies he sought to eliminate (it was the Department of Energy) and who reportedly didn’t know that the Energy Department’s responsibilities — and budget — then lay heavily with maintaining the country’s nuclear stockpile.
</p><p>
	But Wright’s extensive energy experience — studying nuclear fusion at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and working early in his career on solar and geothermal engineering (his company, Liberty Energy, the fracking powerhouse he founded in 2011, has invested in the next-generation geothermal company Fervo, and Wright sits on the board of the nuclear company Oklo) — has not won him any plaudits from environmental groups or Democrats who focus on climate change. After Trump announced his nomination, the Sierra Club <a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/press-releases/2024/11/sierra-club-statement-nomination-oil-and-fracked-gas-ceo-chris-wright-energy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>called Wright</u></a> a “climate denier who has profited off of polluting our communities and endangering our health and future.” Illinois Rep. Sean Casten, one of the House’s most vocal proponents of climate action, <a href="https://x.com/RepCasten/status/1857938576014442989" target="_blank"><u>also called Wright</u></a> a “climate denier who prioritizes the wants of energy producers over the needs of American consumers.”</p><p>
	Few Republicans — and certainly few high-level Trump appointees — are as conversant in climate and energy data as Wright. That may make him an even more effective advocate for Trump’s “energy dominance” strategy, built around increased production of fossil fuels and, almost certainly, fewer subsidies for clean energy and electrification.
</p><p>
	Typically when a person gains some notoriety by coming out against immediate, large-scale climate action and restrictions on fossil fuel extraction, climate advocates try to link that person to the fossil fuel industry and its long history of deliberate and knowing climate denial. Wright’s associations, however, are perfectly straightforward: Liberty Energy fracks oil and gas in the United States and Canada on behalf of large oil companies. He thinks the company’s contribution to the good of the world consists of its producing more hydrocarbons — full stop.
</p><p>
	Wright calls this philosophy “<a href="https://x.com/ChrisAWright_/status/1828816296471044317" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>energy sobriety</u></a>,” fully conceding that climate change is real while also diminishing the urgency of mounting a response. In seemingly countless speeches, interviews, and legislative testimonies, as well as in Liberty Energy’s annual “Bettering Human Lives” report — its version of an environmental, social, and governance review — Wright is perfectly comfortable acknowledging climate change while also patiently assaulting many key pillars of climate policy as it’s practiced in the United States, Europe, and other countries in the developed world seeking to sharply reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
</p><p>
	While Wright’s written and spoken record adds up to tens of thousands of words and hours of talks, it can be distilled into a few core ideas: Energy consumption makes people better off; energy access, especially in the developing world, is a greater global challenge than climate change; and existing alternatives to hydrocarbons are not capable of replacing the status quo energy system, which still overwhelmingly relies on fossil fuels, with little prospect of a rapid transition.
</p><p>
	He cites a wide range of thinkers, including members of a group of scholars — including the Danish political scientist Bjorn Lomborg (whose book, <em><em>False Alarm</em></em>, is “fantastic,” Wright said in a Liberty talk), University of Colorado science policy scholar Roger Pielke, Jr. (“a real intellectual”), and the Canadian energy scholar and historian Vaclav Smil (“the greatest energy scholar of my lifetime by far”) — who share elements of this deflationary view of climate change.</p><p>
	Lomborg and Pielke have long been bêtes noires of the climate movement, mostly as the subjects of years of furious back and forth in every form of media for the past two-plus decades. (Though in Pielke’s case, <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/targeted-crusading-congressman-scientist-speaks-out-conflicts-climate-and-controversy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">there was also <u>an investigation in 2015</u></a> over alleged conflicts of interest led by House Democrat Raul Grijalva, who is retiring from Congress this year.) Lomborg has for decades argued that climate change ranks relatively low on global challenges <a href="https://copenhagenconsensus.com/copenhagen-consensus-iii/how-spend-75-billion-make-world-better-place" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>compared to, say, global public health</u></a>, while Pielke contends that many climate change policy advocates <a href="https://rogerpielkejr.substack.com/p/climate-fueled-extreme-weather" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>overstate what the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</u></a> actually says about the connection between climate change and extreme weather, a point that has made him the <a href="https://grist.org/article/deniers-like-pielke-keep-shouting-down-any-talk-of-a-climate-change-extreme/" target="_blank"><u>object of intense criticism</u></a> for going on 15 years.</p><p>
	Smil, meanwhile, is deeply skeptical of any effort to wean the world from fossil fuels considering their role in the production of steel, cement, plastics, and fertilizers — the materials that he describes as <a href="https://time.com/6175734/reliance-on-fossil-fuels/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>essential to the modern world</u></a>. Smil also counts among his fans Bill Gates (“<a href="https://www.instagram.com/thisisbillgates/p/CSKZT8upamb/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Vaclav Smil is my favorite author</u></a>”), who is also one of the biggest funders and promoters of climate action through his research and investment group Breakthrough Energy and funding for companies like TerraPower, which is currently building the country’s first next-generation nuclear facility in Wyoming.
</p><p>
	Pielke called both Wright and Doug Burgum, Trump’s nominee for Secretary of the Interior and the designated head of a planned National Energy Council “super competent. They know energy, and that’s a fantastic starting point,” he told me.
</p><p>
	“There is polarization of the climate debate, and the idea that fossil fuels are evil and the fossil industry are arch-villains — that’s part of the framing from the progressive left about how climate wars are to be thought,” Pielke said. “I’m not particularly wedded to that sort of Manichean evil vs. good framing of the debate.”
</p><p>
	But the differences are real. Wright strongly contests much of what is the mainstream of climate policy. While he acknowledges that increased concentrations of carbon dioxide cause higher temperature, he says it’s “actually sort of slow-moving in our lifetimes” and a “relatively modest phenomenon that’s just been wildly abused for political reasons,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmICJPvUx44&ab_channel=AmericanLegislativeExchangeCouncil%28ALEC%29" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>he said in a talk</u></a> to the conservative policy group American Legislative Exchange Council.
</p><p>
	While the Department of Energy has only limited authority over energy policy, <em><em>per se</em></em>, especially the permitting and public lands issues that typically concern fossil fuel companies, Wright does have some levers he can pull. He will likely act quickly to approve more export facilities for liquified natural gas, though the Energy Department’s recently released <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/lng-study" target="_self"><u>study of LNG’s long-term effects</u></a> — particularly on domestic energy prices — may complicate that somewhat. Beyond that, he will inherit a massive energy research portfolio through the national labs, putting him in charge of developing the energy technology that he says are currently insufficient to replace oil and gas.
</p><p>
	“I’ve worked on alternatives. I’d love it if fusion energy arrives,” Wright <a href="https://www.powerlineblog.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said in an interview</u></a> with the conservative website Power Line. “I love energy technology, and I think there’s good things going on, but it’s now become political.”
</p><p>
	He believes that reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 is “neither achievable nor humane,” he wrote in the foreword to the 2024 edition of “Bettering Human Lives.” He also disagrees with the idea of subsidizing the world’s predominant forms of alternative energy, solar and wind.
</p><p>
	“Wind and solar are never going to be dominant sources of energy in the world,” Wright told Bryce on the 2020 podcast. The “main impact” of subsidies for wind and solar, Wright said in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOAYH3p9f0s&t=13s&pp=ygUeY2hyaXMgd3JpZ2h0IHBvd2VyIGh1bmdyeSAyMDIz" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>another 2023 podcast episode</u></a> with Bryce, “is just to make our electricity grids less reliable and electricity prices more expensive, and to do nothing for the demand for oil and very little for the demand for natural gas.”</p><p>
	“Oil and gas make the world go round,” he added. “[People] want higher quality of lives. That’s what drives the demand for oil and gas.”
</p><p>
	Bryce, a persistent critic of green energy policies, told me in an email that he thinks Wright is “the right person for the DOE. He’s not apologetic about being an energy humanist. Regardless of what anyone thinks about climate change, it is obvious that we are going to need a lot more energy in the future, and the majority of that new supply will come from hydrocarbons.”
</p><p>
	While Wright’s arguments certainly have wide purchase among his peers in the energy industry executive corps, he nevertheless stands out from the rest for his willingness to express them. In contrast to the stance taken by large, multinational energy companies, which are willing at least to pay lip service to carbon reduction goals and have, at times, embraced branding and marketing strategies to make them seem like something other than oil and gas companies (e.g. ExxonMobil’s algae-based fuel initiative and BP’s notorious “Beyond Petroleum” campaign), Wright and his company see their contribution to a better world as their work extracting oil and gas.
</p><p>
	Other executives “don’t want to deal with the criticism that will come with taking a higher-profile stance,” Bryce told me. “They don’t have time or the inclination. It takes a lot of time, courage, and conviction to engage with the media, get on the speaking circuit, and do so in a thoughtful way.”
</p><p>
	Wright’s emphasis on the energy poverty faced by poor countries could potentially serve as a diplomatic bridge to the developing world, especially in Africa, where some observers think there’s space for the United States to <a href="https://www.africanistperspective.com/p/what-sorts-of-reforms-under-trump?r=1xc3o9&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>start funding natural gas development</u></a> through the International Development Finance Corporation. For Wright, expanding energy production — and specifically fossil fuel development — is crucial to providing cheap energy to the developing world. He mentions in almost every talk the <a href="https://press.un.org/en/2024/sgsm22225.doc.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>billions</u></a> of people who use wood, dung, or other biofuels on open fires to cook indoors, <a href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/cooking-smoke-kills-millions-every-year-heres-what-world-can-do-about" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>causing 3 million premature deaths</u></a> per year.</p><p>
	“The biggest problem today is a third of humanity doesn’t have hydrocarbons,” Wright told Bryce in 2023. In a 2023 speech to the American Conservation Coalition, a conservative environmental group, he described strictures against financing fossil fuel development as “not just ignorant or bad policy” but “immoral.” His solution: distributing propane stoves as widely as possible, in part <a href="https://www.betteringhumanlives.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>through his Bettering Human Lives Foundation</u></a>.</p><p>
Here might be the greatest challenge for advocates of climate action: Even if most of the world’s leaders have accepted the reality of anthropogenic climate change, much of the world, especially outside North America and Europe, is still eagerly increasing its use of fossil fuels. In the United States, coal plant shutdowns are being pushed out further and natural gas investment may soon pick up again to power new demand for electricity. Globally, coal use is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-12-18/we-re-burning-more-coal-than-ever-thanks-to-china" target="_blank"><u>set to grow over the next few years</u></a>. That’s thanks in large part to demand from China, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/total-ghg-emissions?tab=chart&country=OWID_WRL~CHN~USA~OWID_EU27" target="_blank"><u>the world’s largest emitter</u></a> and <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-chinas-emissions-have-now-caused-more-global-warming-than-eu/" target="_blank"><u>second-largest cumulative emitter</u></a> behind the United States, defying predictions that demand there was near peaking. The biggest new <a href="https://x.com/gbrew24/status/1869748918009188772" target="_blank"><u>source of oil demand is India</u></a>, a country with a per-capita gross domestic product less than 1/30th of the United States.</p><p>
	And so the greatest danger to aggressive action to lower global emissions may not be Chris Wright and his “sober” ideas at the helm of the Department of Energy. It may be that much of the world agrees with him.

## Asian shares mostly fall amid investors' worries about possible policy changes

date: 2025-01-02, from: VOA News USA

TOKYO — Asian shares mostly slipped Thursday, as the region's main stock market in Tokyo stayed closed for the New Year's holidays. 


Investors remained cautious amid worries about what incoming U.S. President Donald Trump might mean for policy changes, while the political uncertainty in South Korea added to a wait-and-see mood. 


Australia's S&P/ASx 200 rose 0.4% in early trading to 8,193.90. South Korea's Kospi declined nearly 0.1% to 2,397.54. Hong Kong's Hang Seng shed 1.3% to 19,807.19, while the Shanghai Composite lost 0.8% to 3,325.56. 


Wall Street trading was closed on Wednesday for the New Year's Day holiday. 


On Thursday, investors will get an updated snapshot of U.S. construction spending for November, while U.S. manufacturing numbers for December will be released Friday. 


Markets pause to mourn Carter


The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq will close their equity and options markets on January 9 in observance of a National Day of Mourning for former President Jimmy Carter, continuing a longtime Wall Street tradition of mourning the nation's leaders. The 39th U.S. president and global humanitarian died on Sunday at his home in Plains, Georgia. He was 100 years old. 


U.S. stock indexes closed mostly lower Tuesday as the market delivered a downbeat finish on the final day of another milestone-shattering year on Wall Street. 


The S&P 500 gave up an early gain to finish down 0.4%. The benchmark index, which set 57 record highs in 2024, racked up a 23.3% gain for the year. This was its second straight year with a gain of more than 20%. The last time the index had as big a back-to-back annual gain was 1998. 


The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.1%, and the Nasdaq composite lost 0.9%. 


Big Tech stocks led this year's rally, pushing the Nasdaq to a yearly gain of 28.6%. The Dow, which is far less heavily weighted with tech, rose 12.9% for the year. 


All told, the S&P 500 fell 25.31 points to 5,881.63 on Tuesday. The Dow lost 29.51 points to close at 42,544.22, and the Nasdaq slid 175.99 points to finish at 19,310.79. 


Growth helps drive US market


U.S. markets' stellar run was driven by a growing economy, solid consumer spending and a strong jobs market. 


Skyrocketing prices for companies in the artificial-intelligence business, such as Nvidia and Super Micro Computer, helped lift the market to new heights. 


After three interest rate cuts in 2024, the Fed has signaled a more cautious approach heading into 2025 with inflation remaining sticky as the country prepares for Trump to transition into the White House. Trump's threats to hike tariffs on imported goods have raised anxiety that inflation could be reignited as companies pass along the cost of tariffs. 


In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude rose 36 cents to $72.08 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, added 34 cents to $74.98 a barrel. 


In currency trading, the U.S. dollar inched down to 157.28 Japanese yen from 157.24 yen. The euro cost $1.0373, up from $1.0361.

## FBI says New Orleans terror attack suspect acted alone

date: 2025-01-02, from: VOA News USA

The FBI says it now believes the suspect in the New Year’s Day truck ramming attack in New Orleans that killed at least 14 people had acted alone and was inspired by the Islamic State terror group.


Officials had previously said they were looking into the possibility that the suspect had coordinated with others.


FBI officials briefed reporters Thursday on the latest in the probe into the “act of terrorism” in which the suspect, 42-year-old Shamsud-Din Jabbar, crashed a pickup truck into a crowd and opened fire in the city’s popular Bourbon Street.




Based on hundreds of interviews and reviews of the attacker’s calls, social media accounts and electronic devices, “We’re confident, at this point, that there are no accomplices,” Christopher Raia of the FBI’s counterterrorism division said Thursday in a news conference.


Jabbar, a U.S. citizen from Texas, was killed in a shootout with police. He served in the U.S. Army and later served in the Army Reserve until a few years ago.


U.S. President Joe Biden said the attack would not defeat New Orleans.


“So many people around the world love New Orleans because of its history, its culture and above all, its people,” Biden said Wednesday night. “I know while this person committed a terrible assault on the city, the spirit of our New Orleans will never, never, never be defeated. It always will shine forth.”





The attack occurred on Wednesday at 3:15 a.m.


On Tuesday evening, just hours before committing the attack, Jabbar posted five videos to his Facebook account, apparently addressed to his family and recorded while he was driving, in which he aligned himself with the Islamic State terror group. The FBI said an IS flag was also found in the vehicle after the attack.


“This was an act of terrorism. It was premeditated and an evil act,” the FBI’s Raia said.


Jabbar had originally planned to hurt his relatives and friends, but worried about how that would be interpreted by the media, Raia said.


“He was 100 percent inspired by ISIS,” he said.


Early morning attack 


The attack occurred at the intersection of Canal and Bourbon streets in the city's lively French Quarter. The historic tourist destination filled with bars and music is also known for its large New Year's Eve celebrations.   


After the vehicle crashed, the driver got out of the car and opened fire on responding officers, police said. Officers returned fire, killing the suspect, according to police. Two officers were wounded but are in stable condition, police said.   


“This is not just an act of terrorism. This is evil,” New Orleans Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick told reporters at a press conference earlier Wednesday. 


Investigators found weapons and a potential explosive device in the vehicle, the FBI said, along with the other potential explosive devices found in the French Quarter. The vehicle appeared to have been rented, the FBI said. 


“My heart goes out to the victims and their families who were simply trying to celebrate the holiday. There is no justification for violence of any kind, and we will not tolerate any attack on any of our nation's communities,” Biden said in a statement on the social media platform X.   




President-elect Donald Trump condemned the attack in a post on his social media platform Truth Social.   


“Our hearts are with all the innocent victims and their loved ones,” Trump said. "The Trump Administration will fully support the City of New Orleans as they investigate and recover from this act of pure evil!”


In the same post, Trump also falsely suggested that the suspect was an immigrant.   


In a Wednesday statement on X, Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry urged people to avoid the area and called the incident “a horrific act of violence."


Video taken by an onlooker at the scene of the attack shows at least two twisted bodies lying in the street, with one of them in what appears to be a pool of blood. A bystander is seen kneeling over one of the bodies.


“For those people who don’t believe in objective evil, all you have to do is look at what happened in our city early this morning,” U.S. Senator John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, said. “If this doesn’t trigger the gag reflex of every American, every fair-minded American, I’ll be very surprised.”


Crowds were also out partying in New Orleans because the city was set to host college football's Sugar Bowl game Wednesday night. Officials confirmed the game would be postponed until Thursday afternoon.  


Additionally, New Orleans is set to host the NFL’s Super Bowl on Feb. 9.   


Investigators say they have found no link between the New Orleans attack and the explosion of a Tesla truck that killed one person outside a Trump hotel in Las Vegas on Wednesday, the FBI’s Raia said. But he cautioned that investigators have not ruled out anything.


VOA national security correspondent Jeff Seldin contributed to this report. Some information in this report came from Reuters and The Associated Press.

## Islamic State group-inspired New Orleans attack revives familiar fears

date: 2025-01-02, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Even before the shock from the deadly New Year’s Day terror attack in New Orleans could subside, early indications from the investigation pointed to a scenario U.S. law enforcement and security officials have long feared – a plot at least inspired by the Islamic State terror group.


The FBI Wednesday confirmed reports the suspect had planted an IS flag in the pickup truck he used to plow into a crowd on Bourbon Street in the early hours of Wednesday morning before he was killed during a shootout with police.




Late Wednesday, U.S. President Joe Biden said the FBI found the suspect had taken other actions “mere hours before the attack” to make his loyalty known.


Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a 42-year-old U.S. citizen and former Army reservist, had "posted videos on social media indicating that it was inspired by ISIS," Biden said, using another name for the terror group.


"The situation is very fluid,” Biden added. "The law enforcement and intelligence community are continuing to look for any connections, associations or co-conspirators," he said.


However, that investigation included the execution of search warrants at various locations in New Orleans and other states, an operation by the FBI and other law enforcement officials at a traffic intersection in Houston and questions as to whether there could be any connection to an attempt to blow up a Tesla Cybertruck in front of the Trump Hotel in Las Vegas.




Regardless of additional conspirators or connections, details of the New Orleans attack itself correspond with tactics long espoused by IS propagandists.


“What we saw fits in with the common pattern we’ve seen from the Islamic State for a while,” said Aaron Zelin, a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, who specializes in jihadism. “They’ve been calling for car ramming attacks for years.”


“Every day they put out pushes for supporters, prospective recruits, anyone to do something on their behalf,” Zelin told VOA.


One of the first IS-linked attacks using a vehicle as a weapon took place in Nice, France, in 2016. A 31-year-old Tunisian-born Frenchman who was divorced and suffered from depression plowed into a Bastille Day celebration, killing more than 80 people.




Months later, a 24-year-old Tunisian man used a truck to drive into crowds at a Christmas market in Berlin, killing 13 people. He, too, posted a video pledging allegiance to IS before carrying out the attack.


IS additionally claimed a November 2017 truck ramming attack in New York that killed at least eight people, in which police officials said the attacker followed IS instructions on vehicle attacks “almost exactly to a T.”




Even as the IS terror group retreated from counterterrorism pressure in places like Syria and Afghanistan, its leaders never abandoned the quest to inspire attacks around the world.


"In Afghanistan ... ISIS-Khorasan, continues to harbor intent to conduct external operations and maintains English‑language media releases that aim to globalize the group’s local grievances among Western audiences," U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas warned in written congressional testimony in October 2023.


Even the most recent Homeland Security threat assessment, issued in September, cautioned that IS, with other terror groups such as al-Qaida, “maintain the enduring intent to conduct or inspire attacks in the Homeland,” rating the threat level as “high.”


The September assessment further warned that IS online media groups also sought to capitalize on the Israel-Hamas conflict in the Middle East “to inspire more violent action.”


FBI Director Christopher Wray has also said repeatedly that the bureau’s domestic terrorism caseload remains high, with about 1,000 IS-related investigations each year spanning all 50 U.S. states.




According to data compiled by Seamus Hughes, a senior researcher faculty member at the National Counterterrorism Innovation, Technology and Education Center, or NCITE, more than 250 individuals have been charged with IS-related activities since 2014.


Most of those cases, according to Hughes, have resulted in guilty pleas or convictions; Justice Department prosecutors have only lost one case that went to trial.


Meanwhile, the FBI has had success in disrupting IS-linked or inspired terror plots.


In October, for example, agents arrested a 27-year-old Afghan national in Oklahoma City, charging him and a juvenile co-conspirator with attempting to carry out a mass shooting on Election Day.


IS has so far yet to claim the New Orleans terror attack as its own, but the Washington Institute’s Aaron Zelin said the attack is already generating excitement among IS supporters on social media.


Some U.S. counterterrorism officials worry that excitement will play to the terror group’s advantage.


"From their view, it's less important that an attack kills large numbers of people than it simply garners a lot of media attention," Brett Holmgren, the acting director of the U.S. National Counterterrorism Center told a Washington audience in November.


Some counterterrorism officials and experts, however, say they worry the attacks could become deadlier.


The NCTC has warned IS has been benefiting from improved finances and even set up an external planning unit in Syria, with a focus on carrying out attacks against the U.S.


“All of last year that there was an uptick in the tempo of Islamic State plots and attacks,” Zelin told VOA. “We saw five attack plots in the United States last year, whereas in 2023 there were none.”


That activity may not be limited to America, with some analysts pointing to deadly IS attacks last year in Kerman, Iran, and Moscow. [[ 


“It falls in line to a broader trend that we've seen in the U.S., but also in other parts of the world where, you know, we saw more plots and attacks in Europe, Russia, Turkey, Iran, Central Asia,” Zelin said.

## Aspiring nurse, football star, father among dead in New Orleans attack

date: 2025-01-02, from: VOA News USA

NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA — An 18-year-old girl dreaming of becoming a nurse, a father of two and a former Princeton football star suffered fatal injuries when the driver of a white pickup truck sped down Bourbon Street, packed with holiday revelers early Wednesday morning.


Officials have not yet released the names of the 15 people killed in the New Orleans New Year's Day truck attack, but their families and friends have started sharing their stories. New Orleans Coroner Dr. Dwight McKenna said in a statement late Wednesday that the names of the dead would be released once autopsies were complete and next of kin were informed. About 30 people were injured.


Nikyra Dedeaux


Zion Parsons of Gulfport, Mississippi, had been celebrating New Year's Eve during his first night on Bourbon Street when a vehicle appeared and plowed into his friend, 18-year-old Nikyra Dedeaux, who he said had dreamed of becoming a nurse.


"A truck hit the corner and comes barreling through, throwing people like in a movie scene, throwing people into the air," Parsons, 18, told The Associated Press. "It hit her and flung her like at least 30 feet, and I was just lucky to be alive."


As the crowd scattered in the chaos, he ran through a gruesome aftermath of bleeding and maimed victims, hearing gunshots and explosive sounds.


"Bodies, bodies all up and down the street, everybody screaming and hollering," Parsons said. "People crying on the floor, like brain matter all over the ground. It was just insane, like the closest thing to a war zone that I've ever seen."


Dedeaux was a responsible daughter — shorter than all her siblings but the one who helped take care of everyone, Parsons said. Dedeaux had a job at a hospital and was set to start college and begin working toward her goal of becoming a registered nurse.


"She had her mind set — she didn't have everything figured out, but she had the plan laid down," Parsons said.




Reggie Hunter


Reggie Hunter, a 37-year-old father of two from Baton Rouge, had just left work and headed to celebrate New Year's with a cousin when the attack happened, another cousin, Shirell Jackson, told Nola.com.


Hunter was killed and his cousin was injured, Jackson said.


Tiger Bech


A former high school and college football player from Louisiana was among those who died in the attack at New Orleans' French Quarter, according to an education official.


Tiger Bech, 28, died late Wednesday morning at a New Orleans hospital, according to local media outlets citing Kim Broussard, the athletic director at St. Thomas More Catholic High School in Lafayette. Bech attended the high school, where he played wide receiver, quarterback, punt returner and defensive back, NOLA.com reported.


Bech's LinkedIn profile said he had played football at Princeton University before graduating in 2021. Most recently he was working as an investment trader at a New York brokerage firm.


Princeton football coach Bob Surace said Wednesday that he had been texting with Bech's father, sharing memories of the player, who was a kick returner and receiver from 2017 to 2019.


"He might be the first Tiger to ever play for us, and that nickname kind of described him as a competitor," Surace told ESPN. The school's teams are also called the Tigers. "He was somebody that somehow, like in the key moments, just excelled and was full of energy, full of life."


Bech had been working at Seaport Global, where company spokesperson Lisa Lieberman could not confirm his death. But she told The Associated Press that "he was extremely well regarded by everybody who knew him."

## 1 person dies, 7 hurt in Tesla truck fire outside Trump's Las Vegas hotel

date: 2025-01-01, from: VOA News USA

LAS VEGAS, NEVADA — One person died and seven others were injured Wednesday when a Tesla Cybertruck that appeared to be carrying fireworks caught fire and exploded outside President-elect Donald Trump's Las Vegas hotel, authorities said.


Las Vegas Metropolitan Police and Clark County Fire Department officials told a news conference that a person died inside the futuristic-looking truck, and they were working to get the body out. Seven people nearby had minor injuries and several were taken to a hospital.


The fire in the valet area of the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas was reported at 8:40 a.m., a county spokesperson said in a statement.


According to a law enforcement official, the truck was rented via the Turo app and appeared to have a load of fireworks. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.




A Turo spokesperson did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.


Tesla CEO Elon Musk said Wednesday afternoon on X that "we have now confirmed that the explosion was caused by very large fireworks and/or a bomb carried in the bed of the rented Cybertruck and is unrelated to the vehicle itself. All vehicle telemetry was positive at the time of the explosion."


"The whole Tesla senior team is investigating this matter right now," Musk said in an earlier post on the platform after attending a New Year's Eve party at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort. "We've never seen anything like this."


Law enforcement officials have not ruled out terrorism as a possible motive, a person familiar with the matter said. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss details of the investigation.


"I know you have a lot of questions," Jeremy Schwartz, acting special agent in charge for the FBI's Las Vegas office, told reporters. "We don't have a lot of answers."


President Joe Biden was briefed on the explosion. The truck explosion came hours after a driver rammed a truck into a crowd in New Orleans' famed French Quarter early on New Year's Day, killing at least 15 people before being shot to death by police.


In Las Vegas, witness Ana Bruce, visiting from Brazil, said she heard three explosions.


"The first one where we saw the fire, the second one, I guess, was the battery or something like that, and the third was the big one that smoked the entire area and was the moment when everyone was told to evacuate and stay away," Bruce said.


The 64-story hotel is just off the Las Vegas Strip and across the street from the Fashion Show Las Vegas shopping mall.


Eric Trump, a son of the president-elect and executive vice president of the Trump Organization, posted about the fire on the social media platform X. He praised the fire department and local law enforcement "for their swift response and professionalism."

## Power restored to nearly all of Puerto Rico after major blackout

date: 2025-01-01, from: VOA News USA

BAYAMON, PUERTO RICO — Power was restored to nearly all electrical customers across Puerto Rico on Wednesday after a sweeping blackout plunged the U.S. territory into darkness on New Year's Eve. 


By Wednesday afternoon, power was back up for 98% of Puerto Rico's 1.47 million utility customers, said Luma Energy, the private company supplying power to the archipelago. Lights returned to households as well as Puerto Rico's hospitals and water and sewage facilities after the massive outage that exposed the persistent electricity problems plaguing the island. 


Still, the company warned that customers could still see temporary outages in the coming days. It said full restoration across the island could take up to two days. 


"Given the fragile nature of the grid, we will need to manage available generation to customer demand, which will likely require rotating temporary outages," Juan Saca, president of Luma Energy, said in a statement. 




The lights went off in Puerto Rico at 5:30 a.m. Tuesday, darkening almost the entire archipelago as people prepared to ring in the New Year. Authorities are still investigating the cause of the outage, but Luma Energy said a preliminary review pointed to a failure in an underground electric line in the south of the territory. 


Governor-elect Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon, who is set to take office Thursday, warned that customers might experience interruptions in the coming days, with power plants not yet operating at maximum capacity. 


"These days, I urge you to be moderate with your energy consumption to help reduce load shifting, so that more people can have access to electricity and the system can start up without any major setbacks," Gonzalez-Colon said on the X social media platform.  


On the campaign trail, Gonzalez-Colon promised to appoint an "energy czar" to oversee the operation of the power grid, which has long been fragile and faulty due to years of neglect. 


The island's power lines were ravaged in September 2017 by Hurricane Maria, a Category 4 storm. 


Unreliable electricity remains frustratingly common, hindering daily life for Puerto Ricans. In June, over 340,000 customers were left without electricity as people reeled from soaring temperatures. In August, at the peak of Hurricane Ernesto, over half of all utility customers lost power. Tens of thousands of people remained without electricity a week after the storm. 


The New Year's Eve outage came as clients brace for a hike in electricity rates. Last month, Puerto Rico's Energy Bureau approved an increase of 2.2 cents per kilowatt hour for residential customers from January through March, causing electric bills for the average household to jump by nearly $20, the Energy Bureau said.

## Harry Chandler, Navy medic who survived Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor, dies at 103

date: 2025-01-01, from: VOA News USA

HONOLULU — Harry Chandler, a Navy medic who helped pull injured sailors from the oily waters of Pearl Harbor after the 1941 Japanese attack on the naval base, has died. He was 103. 


Chandler died Monday at a senior living center in Tequesta, Florida, according to Ron Mahaffee, the husband of his granddaughter Kelli Fahey. Chandler had congestive heart failure, but Mahaffee said doctors and nurses noted his advanced age when giving a cause of death. 


The third Pearl Harbor survivor to die in the past few weeks, Chandler was a hospital corpsman 3rd class on Dec. 7, 1941, when waves of Japanese fighter planes dropped bombs and fired machine guns on battleships in the harbor and plunged the U.S. into World War II. 


He told The Associated Press in 2023 that he saw the planes approach as he was raising the flag that morning at a mobile hospital in Aiea Heights, which is in the hills overlooking the base. 


“I thought they were planes coming in from the states until I saw the bombs dropping,” Chandler said. His first instinct was to take cover and ”get the hell out of here.” 


“I was afraid that they’d start strafing,” he said. 




His unit rode trucks down to attend to the injured. He said in a Pacific Historic Parks oral history interview that he boarded a boat to help pluck wounded sailors from the water. 


The harbor was covered in oil from exploding ships, so Chandler washed the sailors off after lifting them out. He said he was too focused on his work to be afraid. 


“It got so busy you weren't scared. Weren’t scared at all. We were busy. It was after you got scared,” Chandler said. 


He realized later that he could have been killed, “But you didn’t think about that while you were busy taking care of people.” 


The attack killed more than 2,300 U.S. servicemen. Nearly half, or 1,177, were sailors and Marines on board the USS Arizona, which sank nine minutes after it was bombed. 


Chandler's memories came flowing back when he visited Pearl Harbor for a 2023 ceremony commemorating the 82nd anniversary of the bombing. 


“I look out there, and I can still see what’s going on. I can still see what was happening,” Chandler told The Associated Press. 


Asked what he wanted Americans to know about Pearl Harbor, he said: “Be prepared.” 


“We should have known that was going to happen. The intelligence has to be better,” he said. 


After the war Chandler worked as a painter and wallpaper hanger and bought an upholstery business with his brother. He also joined the Navy reserves, retiring as a senior chief in 1981. 


Chandler was born in Holyoke, Massachusetts, and lived for most of his adult life in nearby South Hadley, Mahaffee said. In recent decades he split his time between Massachusetts and Florida. 


An avid golfer, he shot five hole-in-ones during his lifetime, his grandson-in-law added. 


Chandler had one biological daughter and adopted two daughters from his second marriage, to Anna Chandler, who died in 2004. He is survived by two daughters, nine grandchildren, 17 great-grandchildren and five great-great-grandchildren. 


Military historian J. Michael Wenger has estimated that there were some 87,000 military personnel on the island of Oahu on the day of the attack. With Chandler’s death, only 15 are still living, according to a tally maintained by Kathleen Farley, the California state chair of the Sons and Daughters of Pearl Harbor Survivors. 


Bob Fernandez, who served on the USS Curtiss, also died this month, at age 100, and Warren Upton, 105, who served on the USS Utah, died last week.

## Trump says he plans to attend Jimmy Carter's funeral

date: 2025-01-01, from: VOA News USA

PALM BEACH, FLORIDA — U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said Tuesday that he's planning to attend the funeral of former President Jimmy Carter.


Asked about it as he walked into a New Year's Eve party at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, Trump responded, "I'll be there.” Pressed on whether he'd spoken to members of Carter's family, Trump said he'd rather not say.


Funeral services honoring Carter, who died Sunday at 100, will be held in Georgia and Washington, beginning Jan. 4 and concluding Jan. 9.


Trump was a frequent and fierce critic of Carter on the campaign trail ahead of November's election, using the rising inflation rates of the 1970s to unfavorably compare President Joe Biden to Carter and his administration.


The president-elect was gracious about the former president, though, in posts on his social media site after Carter's death Sunday, writing that the nation “owed him a debt of gratitude.”


“While I strongly disagreed with him philosophically and politically, I also realized that he truly loved and respected our Country, and all it stands for,” Trump wrote of Carter. “He worked hard to make America a better place, and for that I give him my highest respect.”


Wearing a tuxedo as he entered the festivities, Trump took a few minutes of questions from reporters on various topics. He was asked about the possibility of a ceasefire in Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza but said only, “We’re going to see what happens."


Of hostages seized more than a year ago by Hamas, the president-elect said, “I’ll put it this way: They better let the hostages come back soon."


Trump also said he thought 2025 would be a “great year” and "we’re going to do fantastically well as a country.”


“There’s a whole light over the whole world, not just our country. They’re a lot of happy people,” Trump said of recent weeks.


Asked about his resolutions for the new year, Trump said, “I just want everybody to be happy, healthy and well.”


Trump later took the stage to briefly address the crowd ringing in the new year at Mar-a-Lago and promised “to do a great job as your president.”


Biden, for his part, spent New Year’s Eve celebrating the wedding of his niece Missy Owens in Greenville, Delaware, followed by the reception in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania. Biden and first lady Jill Biden cut short their traditional holiday trip to the U.S. Virgin Islands to attend the ceremony.

## FBI investigating deadly New Orleans truck attack as 'act of terrorism'

date: 2025-01-01, from: VOA News USA

A driver crashed a pickup truck into a crowd celebrating New Year's early Wednesday in New Orleans, Louisiana, and opened fire, killing 15 people and injuring at least 30. The FBI said it was investigating the attack as an act of terrorism and did not believe the driver acted alone.


Investigators found multiple explosive devices in the French Quarter, The Associated Press reported, citing a Louisiana State Police intelligence bulletin. Among the devices were two pipe bombs hidden inside coolers and wired to detonate remotely, the bulletin said.


U.S. President Joe Biden updated the nation on the investigation Wednesday night.


"The killer was an American citizen born in Texas. He served in the United States Army in active duty for many years. He also served in the Army Reserve until a few years ago," Biden said.




Hours before the attack, the suspect indicated in videos posted on social media that the attack was inspired by the Islamic State terror group.


"The law enforcement and intelligence community are continuing to look for any connections, associations or co-conspirators. We have nothing additional reported at this time. The investigation is continuing to be active, and no one should jump to conclusions," the president added.


"So many people around the world love New Orleans because of its history, its culture, and above all, its people," Biden said. "So I know while this person committed a terrible assault on the city, the spirit of our New Orleans will never, never, never be defeated. It always will shine forth."


Early morning attack 


The attack occurred at 3:15 a.m. on Wednesday at the intersection of Canal and Bourbon streets in the city's lively French Quarter. The historic tourist destination filled with bars and music is also known for its large New Year's Eve celebrations.


After the vehicle crashed, the driver got out of the car and opened fire on responding officers, police said. Officers returned fire, killing the suspect, according to police. Two officers were wounded but are in stable condition, police said.


"This is not just an act of terrorism. This is evil," New Orleans Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick told reporters at a press conference earlier Wednesday.




The FBI identified the suspect as Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a 42-year-old U.S. citizen from Texas.


"An ISIS flag was located in the vehicle, and the FBI is working to determine the subject's potential associations and affiliations with terrorist organizations," the FBI, which is leading the investigation, said in a statement.


The suspect served in the U.S. Army for years but had been out of the military for some time, officials said.


Investigators found weapons and a potential explosive device in the vehicle, the FBI said, along with the other potential explosive devices found in the French Quarter. The vehicle appeared to have been rented, the FBI said.


More than 300 officers were on duty during the incident, police said.


Biden said he has been continually briefed on the attack. He has also been briefed on a Cybertruck fire near the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas and has directed his team to offer any federal assistance needed, the White House said.


"My heart goes out to the victims and their families who were simply trying to celebrate the holiday. There is no justification for violence of any kind, and we will not tolerate any attack on any of our nation's communities," Biden said in a statement on the social media platform X.




The White House said it has been in touch with New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell to offer support.


"The FBI is already on the ground supporting local law enforcement in the investigation and the President will continue to be briefed throughout the day," the White House said in a statement.


The Justice Department said Attorney General Merrick Garland was also briefed on the attack.


President-elect Donald Trump condemned the attack in a post on his social media platform Truth Social.


"Our hearts are with all the innocent victims and their loved ones," Trump said. "The Trump Administration will fully support the City of New Orleans as they investigate and recover from this act of pure evil!"




Video taken by an onlooker at the scene of the attack shows at least two twisted bodies lying in the street, with one of them in what appears to be a pool of blood. A bystander is seen kneeling over one of the bodies.


Those injured in the attack were taken to five hospitals, according to NOLA Ready, the city's emergency preparedness department.


"As we search for a motive, remember there is no making sense of evil," New Orleans City Council member Oliver Thomas said.




In a statement on X, Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry urged people to stay away from the site of the attack, calling the incident "a horrific act of violence."


Crowds were also out partying in New Orleans because the city was set to host college football's Sugar Bowl game Wednesday night. Officials confirmed Wednesday afternoon that the game would be postponed until Thursday night.


Additionally, New Orleans is set to host the NFL's Super Bowl on February 9.


New Orleans has experienced violence surrounding celebrations in the past.


In November 2024, two people were killed and 10 others injured in two separate shootings along a New Orleans parade route and a celebration attended by thousands of people, according to local media.


Some information in this report came from Reuters and The Associated Press.

<strong>Jesse Jenkins: </strong> If you build a tariff wall around America and you say, <em><em>You must buy American-made panels or pay a huge tariff</em></em>, we could build a domestic solar manufacturing sector, but it would by no means be required to be globally competitive. And if you were to remove those protections, it would probably immediately collapse. […] If you want to, you have a competitive agenda, you need to be developing a particular type of industry that can be competitive. And I think that Michael’s question hints that maybe that’s not that important in the case of solar because it’s just not a very high-margin business. It’s kind of a bad business to be in. There’s consistent overcapacity and margins are thin, if not non-existent.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Robinson Meyer: </strong>Jenny Chase At BloombergNEF, who is the master of solar manufacturing, consistently describes it as one of the worst businesses in the world because these Chinese manufacturers — and now, more broadly, these Chinese and Southeast Asian manufacturers — are just constantly competing each other out of business.<br/>
<br/>
	I will say, I want to attach an asterisk to globally competitive, right? There’s like a B part to that, which is, do you think dominating in this industry is going to create know-how that allows you to dominate future technologies we don’t understand yet?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Jenkins:</strong> Yeah, are there general-purpose manufacturing techniques or core technology components here that you think are going to be useful in a variety of other sectors? I think that’s true.<br/>
<br/>
	I look at batteries, for example, as a critical general-purpose technology for the 21st century, right? Like, good batteries are going to be in everything, and so the ability to produce those and to continue to innovate and be at the frontier there, it’s important to national defense. It’s important to the transportation sector. It’s important to consumer products. You know, it’s just a critical platform technology, and a lot of the innovations in material science and electrochemistry and other things that you need to develop for batteries have other broader applications in decarbonizing industry and producing other products.<br/>
<br/>
	So I think that’s a good example of a case where, even if you’re a little behind the technology or frontier, there’s a lot of value to trying to catch up there for, for broader reasons.</blockquote><div class="horizontal-rule">

## US chief justice warns of 'dangerous' calls to disregard court rulings

date: 2025-01-01, from: VOA News USA

U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts on Tuesday warned about a rising number of threats to the judiciary's independence, including calls for violence against judges and suggestions by elected officials to disregard court rulings they disagree with.


Roberts in an annual year-end report on the judiciary released just weeks before Republican President-elect Donald Trump takes office did not directly address what polling suggests has been a decline in public confidence in the judicial system broadly.


But Roberts said he felt compelled to highlight several areas of "illegitimate activity" that went far beyond informed criticism and debate concerning judicial rulings, which he said, "threaten the independence of judges on which the rule of law depends."


Those areas of threats, he said, include a significant uptick in violent threats and online intimidation directed at judges, disinformation about court cases magnified by social media, and cyberthreats posed by foreign state actors.


In the past five years, the U.S. Marshals Service has investigated more than 1,000 serious threats against federal judges, Roberts wrote. In some extreme cases, judicial officers have been issued bulletproof vests, he said.


He cited the risks of hackers stealing confidential information and of hostile foreign state actors spreading disinformation online, including by using bots to distort judicial decisions and "foment discord within our democracy."


Roberts also highlighted what he said were instances in the past few years in which "elected officials from across the political spectrum have raised the specter of open disregard for federal court rulings."


"These dangerous suggestions, however sporadic, must be soundly rejected," Roberts wrote.


Roberts, a member of the court's 6-3 conservative majority, did not specify what cases he was referring to, nor did he reference recent Supreme Court rulings that have set off political firestorms.


Those include its 2022 decision rolling back abortion rights or its July ruling granting Trump substantial immunity for actions taken in office in the now-dismissed 2020 election subversion criminal case he faced.


The abortion ruling prompted protests outside of several justices' homes, and an armed man was charged in 2022 with attempting to assassinate conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh after being arrested near his home.


Roberts' report also did not discuss recent ethics controversies concerning gifts and travel received by members of the Supreme Court that have prompted investigations by Democratic lawmakers and calls for reforms.


Roberts acknowledged court rulings can "provoke strong and passionate reactions" and said criticism was not a threat, and that "public engagement with the work of the courts results in a better-informed polity and a more robust democracy."


But he said public officials "regrettably have engaged in recent attempts to intimidate judges — for example, suggesting political bias in the judge's adverse rulings without a credible basis for such allegations."


"Public officials certainly have a right to criticize the work of the judiciary, but they should be mindful that intemperance in their statements when it comes to judges may prompt dangerous reactions by others," he wrote.

## US Capitol riot fugitive seeks asylum in Canada

date: 2025-01-01, from: VOA News USA

OTTAWA, ONTARIO, CANADA — An American man who fled after being sentenced to prison for his role in the U.S. Capitol riot is now seeking political asylum in Canada, as he waits and hopes for a pardon when Donald Trump returns to the White House.


Antony Vo, 32, was sentenced to nine months behind bars and ordered to report to a federal prison on June 14, 2024, but instead he fled to Canada.


More than 1,500 people have been charged in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on Congress, which sought to disrupt certification of President Joe Biden's election victory.


Vo, from Indiana, was convicted at a jury trial in Washington of four counts of entering a restricted building and disorderly conduct related to his actions.


"I knew Canada has a history of being welcoming to refugees, from Vietnam War draft dodgers to the people who hid Edward Snowden in Hong Kong," he told AFP. "So I packed up my snowboarding gear and drove across the border."


In refugee claim documents, Vo said the riot was "a peaceful protest" that was "subverted as part of a domestic regime-change operation to politically assassinate Trump and his supporters."


He added that he was "persecuted, maltreated," and subjected to an "unfair trial" over his political beliefs, and if sent back to the United States would be jailed "under inhumane conditions."


The assault on the Capitol followed a fiery speech by then-president Trump to tens of thousands of his supporters near the White House, in which he repeated his false claims that he won the 2020 vote.


More than 140 police officers were injured during hours of clashes with rioters wielding flagpoles, baseball bats, hockey sticks and other makeshift weapons along with Tasers and canisters of bear spray.


Vo insisted that he saw no violence.


Images on social media showed Vo and his mother, Annie -- who fled Vietnam in 1991 and was granted asylum in the United States -- smiling inside the Capitol that day. She was arrested in March and is awaiting trial.


Vo said he hopes to stay in Canada "until the situation is safe for me to return" to the United States. "When Donald Trump takes office, I hope he pardons me and the rest of the January 6 protesters."


Trump has called the rioters patriots and political prisoners and told a CNN town hall that he was "inclined to pardon many of them."


Several Capitol riot defendants have seized upon Trump's election victory over Vice President Kamala Harris to ask that their trials or sentencing be put on hold.


Trump himself, who takes office again in January, was charged with conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election.


But the case never made it to trial and is now being wound down under the Justice Department's policy of not prosecuting a sitting president.


Vo said that he had also tried to seek asylum in Argentina, Mexico, El Salvador, Vietnam, Belarus, and Russia.


"I seriously explored getting paramotoring lessons and then paramotoring from Key West to Cuba to seek asylum there too," he said in his claim.


Vo said that in Canada, "people have really taken good care of me."

## US oil production rose to record high in October, data show

date: 2024-12-31, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — U.S. oil production rose 260,000 barrels per day month-over-month to a record 13.46 million bpd in October as demand surged to the highest levels since the pandemic, data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed on Tuesday.


U.S. oil output has grown rapidly this year as drilling operations became more efficient, even as concerns of oversupply have weighed heavily on prices for the commodity amid weaker-than-expected demand growth, especially in China, the top oil-importing nation.


Year-over-year, U.S. oil production rose 2.3% in October, while West Texas Intermediate crude futures prices CLc1 averaged 16% lower during the month, according to Reuters calculations.


Still, the pace of growth of U.S. oil output is moderating, analysts said. Annual oil production growth in the U.S. is tracking around 300,000 to 400,000 bpd in 2024, versus nearly a million bpd in 2023, said Alex Hodes, energy analyst at brokerage StoneX.


"There have been a few infrastructure constraints that have kept production somewhat muted, but I would expect that we will see a lot of the same in 2025," Hodes said.


Strong U.S. oil demand in October was the biggest surprise in the EIA's Petroleum Supply Monthly report, UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo said.


Total U.S. oil demand rose by about 700,000 bpd from September to 21.01 million bpd in October, the highest since August 2019, EIA data showed. Demand for distillate fuels, which include diesel and heating oil, rose to 4.06 million bpd in October, the highest in a year.

## 18 Climate Books to Read in 2025

date: 2024-12-31, from: Heatmap News

That’s <a href="https://heatmap.news/heatmap-turns-1" target="_self"><u>our philosophy here at Heatmap</u></a>, but just about everything around us illustrates it, too — from <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics" target="_self"><u>government policy</u></a> and <a href="https://heatmap.news/technology" target="_self"><u>tech</u></a> to <a href="https://heatmap.news/fast-x-evs-furious-electrification" target="_self"><u>movies</u></a> and <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/love-is-blind-taylor-krause" target="_self"><u>reality TV</u></a>.</p>
<p>And of course — or maybe, especially — books.</p>
<p>It’s been about 17 years since the term “cli-fi” (or “climate fiction”) was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/may/31/global-warning-rise-cli-fi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>first coined</u></a>, and in the meantime, books that touch on climate themes in both fiction and nonfiction have taken off like the <a href="https://keelingcurve.ucsd.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Keeling Curve</u></a>. In 2025, we’ll be reading novels that imagine life in San Francisco after years of deluge and investigative reports into subjects such as how companies have gotten away with dumping <a href="https://heatmap.news/lifestyle/raincoats-pfas-gore-tex-patagonia-rei" target="_self"><u>forever chemicals</u></a> into the environment for so long. There will be new natural histories to dive into — on the desert, forests, prairies, and even on the chemical compound CO2 — as well as new frames of thinking about climate change and how we approach its solutions.</p>
<p>Because so many 2025 books will touch on climate themes, I’ve set aside a section of honorable mentions at the end of this list that are also worth checking out. The division doesn’t indicate quality; I chose the primary 18 based on my subjective excitement and to showcase different genres, publishers, and authors. It might be in the appendix that you find a book on the topic <em><em>you’re</em></em> personally most excited about (Arctic exploration? Solar geoengineering? Florida-set family dramas?) for next year.</p>
<p>Finally, if you want to see <em><em>all</em></em> these books in one place or judge them by their (excellent) covers, you can browse our curated list on Bookshop <a href="https://bookshop.org/lists/heatmap-s-most-anticipated-climate-books-of-2025" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>.</p>
<h3><em>American Oasis: Finding the Future in the Cities of the Southwest</em>, by Kyle Paoletta (January 14)</h3><p>The U.S. government’s Fifth National Climate Assessment section on the Southwest reads like an apocalyptic horror story: “Heat-related mortality,” “increased wildfire risks,” and “longer and more severe droughts” all make it into the opening few paragraphs. The truth is that the hottest and driest region of the United States is home to 60 million people, many of whom will have to adapt to a more extreme future in the coming years. In New Mexico-born journalist Kyle Paoletta’s debut book, <em><em>American Oasis</em></em>, he traces the allure of places like Albuquerque, Phoenix, El Paso, and Las Vegas back to the <a href="https://library.fiveable.me/hs-new-mexico-history/unit-1/athabaskan-migration-early-apache-navajo-history/study-guide/1623CMuJcjMibm98" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Athapaskan migration from the sub-Arctic</u></a> around 1100 BCE and through the heydays of <em><em>Arizona Highways</em></em>, a magazine from the 1950s, while also charting what lies ahead for those who are drawn to making the desert, however impossibly, their home. <em><em>Preorder it </em></em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/95482/9780553387377" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>here</em></em></u></a><em><em>.</em></em></p>
<h3><em>Elegy, Southwest</em>, by Madeleine Watts (Feb. 18)</h3><p>Speaking of the American desert, on the fiction side of things this winter comes Madeleine Watts’ latest novel, <em><em>Elegy, Southwest</em></em>. Watts made a name for herself as a writer of cli-fi after the release of her 2021 novel, <em><em>The Inland Sea</em></em>, set against the backdrop of Australia’s fires and floods, and she returns this year with a road trip novel that follows Eloise, a doctoral student studying the Colorado River and climate change. As part of her research, Eloise flies to Las Vegas for a road trip through the Southwest with her husband, Lewis, to whom the novel is addressed. Along the way, Eloise begins to believe she’s pregnant, while Lewis struggles with the fresh grief of losing his mother. As Watts <a href="https://www.the-berliner.com/books/madeleine-watts-inland-sea-interview/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>told an interviewer</u></a> of her process for <em><em>The Inland Sea</em></em>, “I wanted to write … about what it’s like to live in the experience of a changing climate that is not always a tangible part of your day-to-day but that’s already there – it’s in the air all around you.” Expect a similar treatment this go-round.<em> </em><em><em>Preorder it </em></em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/95482/9781668051627" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>here</em></em></u></a><em><em>.</em></em></p>
<h3><em>Dream State</em>, by Eric Puchner (Feb. 18)</h3><p>Eric Puchner’s new novel, <em><em>Dream State</em></em>, is the story of two marriages set over 50 years. With the book opening in 2004, that naturally requires some speculation about the future — in this case, the future of “a rapidly warming Montana.” As <em><em>The Indypendent</em></em> writes <a href="https://indypendent.org/2024/11/a-group-of-friends-ages-together-in-novel-with-climate-crisis-motif/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>in an early review</u></a>, “The looming climate crisis — declining snowfall, depleted wildlife, raging seasonal wildfires, and abnormally warm temperatures — is writ large in the book, forming a blistering backdrop, highlighting newfound restrictions on what both residents and short-term visitors can now see and do in the area.” The novel has earned praise from Pulitzer Prize-winner Adam Johnson, who called it “a masterpiece,” as well as author Lynn Steger Strong, who has a climate book of her own on the list below.<em><strong> </strong></em><em><em>Preorder it </em></em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/95482/9780385550666" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>here</em></em></u></a><em><em>.</em></em></p>
<h3><em>The Unworthy</em>, by Agustina Bazterrica, translated by Sarah Moses (March 4)</h3><p>Four years ago, Argentinean author Agustina Bazterrica burst onto Americans’ radars with the English-language translation of her 2017 novel<em> </em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/95482/9781982150921" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>Tender Is the Flesh</em></em></u></a>, a book that imagines a future in which animals have become toxic to humans, leading us to resort to industrialized cannibalism. (Critics have described it, vividly, as “splatterpunk.”) This year, Bazterrica turns her attention from factory farming to the climate catastrophe, telling the story of a member of a “Sacred Sisterhood” cloistered in a mysterious convent who is prompted to reflect on her life outside its walls when a new acolyte arrives. Don’t expect Bazterrica to soften her critiques of capitalism here, though it’s not all doom and gloom; early readers have <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thebellekeys/p/DDAGgUoRsnr/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said</u></a> <em><em>The Unworthy</em></em> “ends on a light note of hope.”<em><strong> </strong></em><em><em>Preorder it </em></em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/95482/9781668051887" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>here</em></em></u></a><em><em>.</em></em></p>
<h3><em>Wild Dark Shore</em>, by Charlotte McConaghy (March 4)</h3><p>Charlotte McConaghy’s follow-up novel to her critically acclaimed 2020 debut, <em><em>Migrations</em></em>, is set on a fictional research island, Shearwater, located between Australia and Antarctica. Dominic Salt, the caretaker of the island’s <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/endangered-species-dna-us-fish-and-wildlife-service" target="_self"><u>seed vault</u></a>, has called the refuge home for the past eight years — ever since fleeing Australia’s accelerating natural disasters, hoping to find a safer place to raise his three children. But with rising sea levels now threatening the island, Dominic and his family have just seven weeks left before they plan to move on. Just before their departure, Dominic’s oldest daughter discovers a woman who has shipwrecked on shore, and the tension — and mystery — starts to grow. <em><em>Wild Dark Shore</em></em> has earned a starred review from <a href="https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/charlotte-mcconaghy/wild-dark-shore/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Kirkus</u></a>, which calls it a “terrific thriller.” <em><em>Preorder it </em></em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/95482/9781250827951" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>here</em></em></u></a><em><em>.</em></em></p>
<h3><em>Climate Injustice: Why We Need to Fight Global Inequality to Combat Climate Change</em>, by Friederike Otto (March 25)</h3><p>Climatologist, <a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/is-extreme-weather-climate-change" target="_self"><u>World Weather Attribution</u></a> co-founder, and 2024 Trailblazing Women in Climate laureate Friederike Otto <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/reuters-events/trailblazers/trailblazing-women-climate-2024-dr-friederike-otto-2024-03-07/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>does not mince words</u></a> about who is most impacted by extreme weather — and who needs to be involved in the solutions. “If we leave the issue of climate change to white men, it’ll continue to be treated as a physical problem with technological solutions,” she has said, adding, “The more diverse the people working on it, the closer we get to implementing these solutions and making progress on climate change.” Her new book, <em><em>Climate Injustice</em></em>, elaborates on her thesis further, using the stories of real people in the Global South to illustrate how exploitation, sexism, and colonialism have created a crisis with unequal impacts. <em><em>Preorder it </em></em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/95482/9781778401626" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>here</em></em></u></a><em><em>.</em></em></p>
<h3><em>How Can I Help?: Saving Nature with Your Yard</em>, by Douglas W. Tallamy (April 1)</h3><p>Everyone who works in the climate space is familiar with the question posed in the title of this book. Entomologist Douglas W. Tallamy is one of the leading proponents of the <a href="https://heatmap.news/is-native-gardening-becoming-pointless" target="_self"><u>native gardens movement</u></a>, and in <em><em>How Can I Help?</em></em>, he answers a query implied in his own earlier book, 2009’s <em><em>Bringing Nature Home</em></em>: that “unless we restore native plants to our suburban ecosystems, the future of biodiversity in the United States is dim.” <em><em>How Can I Help?</em></em> is structured to address some of the most common questions Tallamy encounters during his lectures about how individuals can become directors of their own miniature national parks at home. Despite the daunting challenge of biodiversity loss, Tallamy offers actionable ideas for helping the planet, with conservation beginning in your backyard.<em><strong> </strong></em><em><em>Preorder it </em></em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/95482/9781643264714" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>here</em></em></u></a><em><em>.</em></em></p>
<h3><em>Poisoning the Well: How Forever Chemicals Contaminated America</em>, by Sharon Udasin and Rachel Frazin (April 10)</h3><p>If I had to make one prediction for 2025, it’d be that we will <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/what-is-maha-health-wellness-movement-rfk-jr-policies.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>hear a lot more about</u></a> per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances — that is, the “forever chemicals” commonly known as PFAS. The chemicals are found in everything from our dental floss to <a href="https://heatmap.news/lifestyle/raincoats-pfas-gore-tex-patagonia-rei" target="_self"><u>our clothes</u></a>, but perhaps most disturbingly, they’re also found in our drinking water. In <em><em>Poisoning the Well</em></em>, <em><em>The Hill</em></em> staff writers Sharon Udasin and Rachel Frazin follow how PFAS got into our environment in the first place — a story of corporate greed and cover-ups that will be familiar to anyone aware of the fossil fuel playbook. <em><em>Preorder it </em></em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/95482/9781642833324" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>here</em></em></u></a><em><em>.</em></em></p>
<h3><em>What's Left: Three Paths Through the Planetary Crisis</em>, by Malcolm Harris (April 15)</h3><p>Journalist Malcolm Harris’ last book was an “encyclopedic,” 700-page history of the city of <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/95482/9780316592017" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Palo Alto</u></a>, which became a fixture of best-of-the-year lists after it came out last February. Hot on its heels is Harris’ follow-up, <em><em>What’s Left</em></em> (which slow readers will be relieved to hear is less of a time commitment, at 320 pages). Harris’ intention with his new work is to explore “our remaining options for saving the world,” all of which involve varying degrees of collective action but which escalate from “progressive” to “socialist” to “revolutionary.” It’s one that you can be sure will have people talking. <em><em>Preorder it </em></em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/95482/9780316577410" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>here</em></em></u></a><em><em>.</em></em></p>
<h3><em>Hope Dies Last: Visionary People Across the World, Fighting to Find Us a Future</em>, by Alan Weisman (April 22)</h3><p>Alan Weisman’s hugely successful 2007 book, <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/95482/9781250834003" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>The World Without Us</em></em></u></a>, speculated about humanity’s legacy if we suddenly disappeared.

Now, Weisman turns his attention to helping us stick around. “I am working on a book with kind of a vast topic, which is what are humanity’s best and most realistic hopes for getting through this very difficult century that we have,” he told <a href="https://www.tbsnews.net/features/panorama/hope-dies-last-tete-tete-alan-weisman-515394" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Bangladesh’s </u><u><em><em>Business Standard</em></em></u></a> in 2022, while visiting the country during the research stage of his new project, <em><em>Hope Dies Last</em></em>. Weisman’s book took him all over the world — including the Korean de-militarized zone, the Netherlands, and the Marshall Islands — as he looked to speak with people across disciplines and professions about how we can approach our future. Bill McKibben has described the result as “a nonfiction companion to Kim Stanley Robinson’s <em><em>Ministry for the Future</em></em>.”<em><strong> </strong></em><em><em>Preorder it </em></em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/95482/9781524746698" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>here</em></em></u></a><em><em>.</em></em></p>
<h3><em>Truth Demands: A Memoir of Murder, Oil Wars, and the Rise of Climate Justice</em>, by Abby Reyes (May 6)</h3><p>In 1999, 24-year-old environmentalist Terence Unity Freitas traveled to Colombia to support the Indigenous U’wa people in resisting Occidental Petroleum, which was interested in drilling to extract some 1.5 billion barrels of oil from beneath the cloud forest. During what was supposed to be a weeklong visit, Freitas was kidnapped by the Armed Revolutionary Forces of Colombia (better known as FARC) along with two other Americans; their bodies were later found, bound and shot, just over the border in Venezuela. Twenty years later, Abby Reyes — the author of this memoir and Freitas’ partner at the time of his death — was recognized as a victim in Colombia’s truth and reconciliation process, resurfacing old griefs, reflections, and questions. “I bring the reader along in my demand for truth before the tribunal while awakening our collective awareness of what the truth demands of all of us in this era of ecological collapse and social transformation,” Reyes <a href="https://mesarefuge.org/people/abby-reyes/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has said</u></a> of her book.<em> </em><em><em>Preorder it </em></em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/95482/9781623175214" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>here</em></em></u></a><em><em>.</em></em></p>
<h3><em>Awake in the Floating City</em>, by Susanna Kwan (May 13)</h3><p>In Susanna Kwan’s debut novel, <em><em>Awake in the Floating City</em></em>, San Francisco is almost entirely underwater. Years of Biblical rain mean most people have already evacuated, but Bo — who lost her mother to the waters — lingers long past when sensible people have fled. Then one day, she receives a note from her neighbor, Mia, a 130-year-old woman who doesn’t want to leave the city, either; together, the two become the last people left in San Francisco. “What post-apocalyptic vision dares be so gorgeous?” marvels the author Meng Jin in one of the book’s early blurbs.<em><em> Preorder it </em></em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/95482/9780593701409" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>here</em></em></u></a><em><em>.</em></em></p>
<h3><em>Take to the Trees: A Story of Hope, Science, and Self-Discovery in America’s Imperiled Forests</em>, by Marguerite Holloway (May 13)</h3><p>Identical twin sister arborists teach the Women’s Tree Climbing Workshop. While that sounds like the beginning of a fairy tale, it’s the delightfully real-life starting point of journalist Marguerite Holloway’s <em><em>Take to the Trees</em></em>. “I was there to be in trees and to better understand them,” she writes of her attendance at the climbing workshop. “Trees and forests are facing existential threats because of climate change, but it can be a struggle to grasp the extent of the danger.” While not all of us have the time, ability, or inclination to take to such “gut-lurching” heights to learn more, we can read <em><em>Take to the Trees</em></em>, which records Holloway’s experience overcoming her fears and learning to appreciate the threat to American forests. <em><em>Preorder it </em></em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/95482/9781324036449" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>here</em></em></u></a><em><em>.</em></em></p>
<h3><em>Sea of Grass: The Conquest, Ruin, and Redemption of Nature on the American Prairie</em>, by Dave Hage and Josephine Marcotty (May 27)</h3><p>Natural history is one of my favorite genres, and I’m especially excited for <em><em>Sea of Grass </em></em>by <em><em>Minnesota Star Tribute</em></em> journalists Dave Hage and Josephine Marcotty about one of the more neglected ecosystems of the genre: the American prairie. The grassland, which makes up a vast swath of the inner United States, is an incredible self-sustaining marvel — and nearly as biodiverse as a tropical rainforest. Yet many people today still either share European settlers’ disinterested view of the landscape or adopt a purely utilitarian one — which is why, after 200 years of plows, drainages, and nitrogen fertilizers, the effects have been “catastrophic.” Still, plenty of people who live on the prairie understand the importance of protecting such a special ecosystem, and Hage and Marcotty follow the effort to work <em><em>alongside</em></em> the land, not just against it. <em><em>Sea of Grass</em></em> earned a coveted blurb from McKibben, in which he calls the book “well worth the read.” <em><em>Preorder it </em></em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/95482/9780593447406" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>here</em></em></u></a><em><em>.</em></em></p>
<h3><em>Cloud Warriors: Deadly Storms, Climate Chaos—And the Pioneers Creating a Revolution in Weather Forecasting</em>, by Thomas E.

Satellites, radars, and computers helped us make a significant leap forward from <a href="https://heatmap.news/culture/old-farmers-almanac-climate-change" target="_self"><u>the days of farmer’s almanacs</u></a>, but advances in artificial intelligence, drones, and the proliferation of home weather stations have created previously unimaginable opportunities for accuracy.

<h3><em>Human Nature: Nine Ways to Feel about Our Changing Planet</em>, by Kate Marvel (June 17)</h3><p>Climate scientist <a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-s2e15-kate-marvel" target="_self"><u>and Shift Key guest</u></a> Kate Marvel structured her highly anticipated first book around nine different emotional lenses for looking at climate change. That might seem like an odd angle for a scientist, since researchers are specifically taught <em><em>not</em></em> to bring emotion into their work. Still, she contends that just as there is no one way to feel about climate change, there is no one emotion we can tap to guide our response to it, either. From hope to pride to love, Marvel urges readers to get deep into their feels in <em><em>Human Nature</em></em>, which also touches on “Greek mythology,” “witches,” “geophysical fluid dynamics,” and “romantic comedies” — though <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/drkatemarvel.bsky.social/post/3lbrz2fb52c2w" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>according to Marvel</u></a>, you won’t find “despair” in its pages.

His follow-up, <em><em>The Story of CO2 Is the Story of Everything</em></em>, will zero in on the collection of molecules that have allowed life to exist in the first place. Of course, the great irony of carbon dioxide is that while it has made our planet habitable, fluctuations in its presence in the atmosphere are also responsible for things like almost killing our ancestors all off in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permian%E2%80%93Triassic_extinction_event#:~:text=The%20scientific%20consensus%20is%20that,temperatures%2C%20and%20acidifying%20the%20oceans." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>an event known as the Great Dying</u></a> — and now, of course, we have put our thumb on that scale. By looking backward, often by many millions of years, Brennen gives us a glimpse of our future.

## New Zealand's Auckland is first major city to welcome 2025 with fireworks and light show

date: 2024-12-31, from: VOA News USA

WELLINGTON, NEW ZEALAND — Auckland has become the first major city to welcome 2025, with thousands of revelers counting down to the new year and cheering at colorful fireworks launched from New Zealand's tallest structure, Sky Tower, and a spectacular downtown light show. 


Thousands also thronged to downtown or climbed the city's ring of volcanic peaks for a fireworks vantage point, and a light display recognizing Auckland's Indigenous tribes. It follows a year marked by protests over Māori rights in the nation of 5 million. 


Countries in the South Pacific Ocean are the first to ring in the New Year, with midnight in New Zealand striking 18 hours before the ball drop in Times Square in New York. Other cities around the world are readying with celebrations highlighting local cultures and traditions, after a year roiled by ongoing conflict and political instability. 


In Australia, more than 1 million people are now expected at Sydney Harbor for the traditional fireworks. British pop star Robbie Williams will lead a singalong and Indigenous ceremonies and performances will acknowledge the land's first people. 


Much of Japan has shut down ahead of the nation's biggest holiday, as temples and homes underwent a thorough cleaning, including swatting floor mats called "tatami" with big sticks. 


The upcoming Year of the Snake in the Asian zodiac is heralded as one of rebirth — alluding to the reptile's shedding skin. Stores in Japan, which observes the zodiac cycle from Jan. 1, have been selling tiny figures of smiling snakes and other snake-themed products. Other places in Asia will start marking the Year of the Snake later, with the Lunar New Year. 


In South Korea, celebrations were cut back or canceled as the country observes a period of national mourning following the Sunday crash of a Jeju Air flight at Muan that killed 179 people. 


New Year celebrations in Jakarta will feature a dazzling fireworks display, including a drone show featuring 800 drones, followed by countdowns to midnight at the city's iconic Hotel Indonesia Roundabout. 


New Year's celebrations are likely to be subdued in Israel as its war with Hamas in Gaza grinds through a 15th month and scores of hostages remain in captivity. 


Rome's traditional New Year's Eve festivities have an additional draw: the start of Pope Francis' Holy Year, the once-every-quarter-century celebration projected to bring some 32 million pilgrims to the Eternal City in 2025. 


On Tuesday, Francis will celebrate a vespers at St. Peter's Basilica, followed by Mass on Wednesday, when he is expected to once again appeal for peace amid wars raging in Ukraine and the Middle East. 


Hours before Germany rings in the new year, Chancellor Olaf Scholz called on the country's 84 million residents to stick together despite the many global crises and wars, the country's ailing economy and a deadly Christmas market attack that shocked the nation. 


"We are a country of togetherness. And we can draw strength from this — especially in difficult times like these," Scholz said in his prerecorded speech. 


Paris will cap a momentous 2024 with its traditional festive countdown and fireworks extravaganza on the famed Champs-Elysées. 


The Summer Olympics and Paralympic Games hosted in the French capital from July to September transformed the city into a site of joy, fraternity and astonishing sporting achievements, and marked another major milestone in its recovery from deadly extremist attacks in 2015 by al-Qaida and the Islamic State group. 


London is due to ring in the New Year with a pyrotechnic display along the River Thames and a parade through the city center on Wednesday featuring 10,000 performers. The fireworks will explode against the backdrop of the London Eye, the massive Ferris wheel across the river from Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament. 


With a storm bringing bitter weather to other parts of the United Kingdom, however, festivities in Edinburgh, Scotland — including the Hogmanay Street party, garden concert and castle pyrotechnics show — were already canceled. 


Rio de Janeiro will throw Brazil's main New Year's Eve bash on Copacabana Beach, with 10 ferries offshore bearing 12 straight minutes of fireworks. Thousands of tourists in six cruise ships will witness the show up close. 


Rio's City Hall was closely guarding its plans for a display of lights and sounds. More than 2 million people are expected at the Copacabana, hoping to squeeze into concerts by superstar Brazilian artists such as pop singer Anitta and Grammy-award winner Caetano Veloso. 


In New York City, the organization managing Times Square has tested its famous ball drop, and inspected 2025 numerals, lights and thousands of crystals, as part of a tradition going back to 1907. This year's celebration will include musical performances by TLC, Jonas Brothers, Rita Ora, and Sophie Ellis-Bextor.

## Southerners in US clean up after tornadoes sweep region

date: 2024-12-31, from: VOA News USA

NEW CANEY, TEXAS — Cleanup was under way Monday after a strong storm system spawned hail, rain, high winds and tornadoes across the southern United States over the weekend, killing at least four people. 


As of Monday afternoon, more than 30 tornadoes had been confirmed as crews worked through about 50 reports of tornado damage spanning from Texas to South Carolina, said Mark Wiley, an emergency response specialist with the National Weather Service's Southern Region Headquarters. 


The storms came over a busy holiday travel weekend, causing some treacherous road conditions along with delays or cancellations at some of the busiest U.S. airports. 


The storms first hit Saturday around the Houston, Texas, area, where the National Weather Service by Monday had confirmed six tornadoes. 


"Some of the damage was pretty substantial, some cases leveling homes, some producing quite a bit of roof damage," said Brian Kyle, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service in Houston. 


About 50 homes in Montgomery County sustained major damage and 30 were destroyed, county official Jason Smith said. A couple hundred more homes sustained minor or cosmetic damage, he said. 


Cleanup crews labored over the weekend and were continuing to pick up debris Monday. 


'I could hear it roar'


Carlos Benitez, 41, was already working to rebuild his auto repair shop in the New Caney area. Benitez said he closed his eyes as the storm blew through and when he opened them, "everything's down." 


Sasha Zamora, 39, lives nearby, and was trying to put her baby to sleep when she realized how serious the storm was. "Immediately, the wind picked up so fast that things were hitting the window," she said, recounting how she rushed her children to the center of the house. Though her family and her property came through the storm OK, her neighbor's mobile home flipped over, Zamora said. 


Officials in Mississippi said two people were killed in storms there, including an 18-year-old who died after a tree fell on her home Saturday night in Natchez in Adams County. About 22,000 Mississippians remained without power Monday afternoon, according to the website PowerOutage.us. In Texas, a 48-year-old woman died in the Liverpool area south of Houston, said Madison Polston of the Brazoria County Sheriff's Office. She said the woman was found about 30 meters from her home. 


Dozens of homes and buildings were significantly damaged in Brazoria County, including an elementary school. 




In North Carolina, a 70-year-old man was killed Sunday in Statesville, just north of Charlotte, when a tree landed on the pickup truck he was driving. Highway Patrol Trooper DJ Maffucci said, "It was just a freak accident" and he believed Matthew Teeple, of Cleveland, North Carolina, was killed instantly. 


Maffucci said that the storms were responsible for a number of downed trees and "quite a few wrecks." 


In the Alabama city of Athens, northwest of Huntsville, the storm damaged the downtown area, said city spokeswoman Holly Hollman. Large HVAC units were hurled from the tops of building and the roof was ripped off a bookstore. A full-sized, stripped-down military helicopter was toppled from a pole where it was on display, she added. 


"I stepped out on my porch and I could hear it roar," she said of the storm. 


Although somewhat uncommon for the season, weather officials say even December can bring severe weather under the right circumstances, as warm temperatures from the Gulf of Mexico combine with a cold front. 


"You can still have the right ingredients that lead to these severe events even in the dead of winter in the Deep South," said Peter Mullinax, a meteorologist with the National Weather Services' Weather Prediction Center. 


Still, it's rare for a system to start in Texas and make its way all the way to the Atlantic Coast this time of year, Wiley said. 


Power outages in Pennsylvania


Meanwhile, in western Pennsylvania, high winds overnight Sunday caused power outages early Monday, most of them in Pittsburgh and other parts of Allegheny County. Wind speeds of more than 97 kilometers per hour were reported in Pennsylvania as high winds also blew across Ohio and northern West Virginia. 


AccuWeather meteorologist Alex DaSilva in State College, Pennsylvania, said a strengthening low-pressure system ushered in the winds that downed trees and utility poles Sunday evening and into the night. Some 60,000 Pennsylvania utility customers were without power Monday morning. That number had dropped to about 13,000 by Monday afternoon, according to PowerOutage.us.

## US repatriates Tunisian detainee from Guantanamo Bay

date: 2024-12-31, from: VOA News USA

The United States announced late Monday the repatriation of a Tunisian man who had been held at the U.S. military detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba since 2002. 


Ridah Bin Saleh al-Yazidi was one of the first to be held at the facility, which at one point housed hundreds of detainees following the September 11, 2001, al-Qaida terror attacks on the United States. 


Yazidi was captured by Pakistani authorities in late 2001. He was among a group of about 30 fighters who had crossed the border from Afghanistan's Tora Bora region, according to Pentagon files. 


The Pentagon assessment said most of the group was identified as al-Qaida operatives or bodyguards of al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden. 


Yazidi was never charged with a crime and cleared for transfer from Guantanamo in 2009, but there was no agreement in place for him to be sent to Tunisia or another country. 


The Pentagon said Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told Congress in January 2024 that officials had "completed the requirements for responsible transfer" in consultation with Tunisia. 


The repatriation leaves 26 detainees at Guantanamo, of whom 14 have been cleared for transfer.  


Some information for this story was provided by The Associated Press and Reuters

## Influential people who died in 2024

date: 2024-12-31, from: VOA News USA

It was a life that took him from peanut farming to the presidency. While former President Jimmy Carter 's time in the White House lasted only one term, the decades afterward were defined by humanitarian work that affected people all around the world.


Founding the Carter Center with his wife, Rosalynn, he became a global champion for democracy, human rights and public health. And he still took time to teach Sunday school at Maranatha Baptist Church in Georgia.


Carter was the nation's longest-lived president when he died Sunday at age 100.


But he was just one of many noteworthy people who died in 2024.


Alexey Navalny, who died in prison in February, was a fierce political foe of Russian President Vladimir Putin, crusading against corruption and staging protests against the Kremlin. He had been jailed since 2021 when he returned to Russia to face certain arrest after recovering in Germany from nerve agent poisoning he blamed on the Kremlin.




Other political figures who died this year include: Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi; former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney; former Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh; Vietnamese politician Nguyen Phu Trong; U.S. Representative Sheila Jackson Lee; former Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov; pundit Lou Dobbs; Greek politician Vasso Papandreou; former U.S. Senators Joe Lieberman, Jim Inhofe, Tim Johnson and Jim Sasser; Namibian President Hage Geingob; and former Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss.


The year also brought the deaths of several rights activists, including the Reverends Cecil L. "Chip" Murray and James Lawson Jr.; Dexter Scott King; Hydeia Broadbent; and David Mixner.


Business leaders who died this year include Indian industrialist Ratan Tata; Home Depot co-founder Bernard "Bernie" Marcus; financier Jacob Rothschild; and Daiso retail chain founder Hirotake Yano.


O.J. Simpson's "trial of the century" over the 1994 killings of his ex-wife and her friend exposed divisions over race and law enforcement and brought an intersection of sports, crime, entertainment and class that was hard to turn away from. His death in April ended a life that had become defined by scrutiny of the killings.


Other noteworthy sports figures who died include basketball players Jerry West and Dikembe Mutombo; baseball players Willie Mays and Fernando Valenzuela; and gymnastics coach Bela Karolyi.


The music industry lost a titan in producer Quincy Jones, who died in November. His many contributions included producing Michael Jackson's "Thriller" album and working with hundreds of other musicians over a long and storied career.


Other artists and entertainers who died this year include: actors James Earl Jones, Chita Rivera, Donald Sutherland, Gena Rowlands, Louis Gossett Jr., Shelley Duvall, Kris Kristofferson, Linda Lavin, Sandra Milo, Anouk Aimee, Carl Weathers, Joyce Randolph, Maggie Smith, Tony Todd, Shannen Doherty and Song Jae-lim; musicians Sergio Mendes, Toby Keith, Phil Lesh, Melanie, Dickey Betts, Françoise Hardy, Fatman Scoop, Duane Eddy and Frankie Beverly; filmmakers Roger Corman and Morgan Spurlock; authors Faith Ringgold, Nikki Giovanni and N. Scott Momaday; TV fitness guru Richard Simmons; sex therapist Dr. Ruth Westheimer; talk show host Phil Donahue; and poets Shuntaro Tanikawa, John Sinclair and Kazuko Shiraishi.


Here is a roll call of some noteworthy figures who died in 2024.

## Jimmy Carter made eradicating Guinea worm disease his mission

date: 2024-12-31, from: VOA News USA

JARWENG, SOUTH SUDAN — Nobel Prize-winning peacemaker Jimmy Carter spent nearly four decades waging war to eliminate an ancient parasite plaguing the world's poorest people.


Rarely fatal but searingly painful and debilitating, Guinea worm disease infects people who drink water tainted with larvae that grow inside the body into worms up to 3 feet long. The noodle-thin parasites then burrow their way out, breaking through the skin in burning blisters.


Carter made eradicating Guinea worm a top mission of The Carter Center, the nonprofit he and his wife, Rosalynn Carter, founded after leaving the White House. The former president rallied public health experts, billionaire donors, African heads of state and thousands of volunteer villagers to work toward eliminating a human disease for only the second time in history.


"It'd be the most exciting and gratifying accomplishment of my life," Carter told The Associated Press in 2016. Even after entering home hospice care in February 2023, aides said Carter kept asking for Guinea worm updates.


Carter died Sunday at age 100.


Thanks to the Carters' efforts, the worms that afflicted an estimated 3.5 million people in 20 African and Asian countries when the center launched its campaign in 1986 are on the brink of extinction. Only 14 human cases were reported across four African nations in 2023, according to The Carter Center.


The World Health Organization's target for eradication is 2030. Carter Center leaders hope to achieve it sooner.


That meant recently returning to Jarweng, in a remote area of South Sudan in northeastern Africa. The village of 500 people hadn't seen Guinea worm infections since 2014 until Nyingong Aguek and her two sons drank swampy water while traveling in 2022. A fourth person also got infected.


"Having the worm pulled out is more painful than giving birth," said Aguek, pointing to scars where four worms emerged from her left leg.


The center's staff and volunteers walked house to house distributing water filters and teaching people to inspect dogs, which can also carry the parasite.


"If someone's hurt, The Carter Center will help," said villager Mathew Manyiel, listening to a training session while checking his dog for symptoms.


An audacious plan


In the mid-1980s, global health agencies were otherwise occupied, and heads of state largely overlooked the illness afflicting millions of their citizens. Carter was still defining the center's mission when public health experts who had served in his administration approached him with a plan to eliminate the disease.


Only a few years had passed since the WHO declared in 1979 that smallpox was the first human disease to be eradicated worldwide. Guinea worm, the experts told Carter, could become the second.


"President Carter, with a political background, was able to do far more in global health than we could do alone," said Dr. William Foege, who led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control's smallpox eradication program and the CDC itself before becoming The Carter Center's first executive director.


Those who worked closely with Carter suspect Guinea worm's toll on poor African farmers resonated with the former president, who lived as a boy in a Georgia farmhouse without electricity or running water.


"Nobody was doing anything about it, and it was such a spectacularly awful disease," said Dr. Donald Hopkins, an architect of the campaign who led the center's health programs until 2015. "He could sympathize with all of these farmers being too crippled from Guinea worm disease to work."


Changing behaviors


There's no vaccine that prevents Guinea worm infections or medicine that gets rid of the parasites. Treatment has changed little since ancient Greece. Emerging worms are gently wound around a stick as they're slowly pulled through the skin. Removing an entire worm without breaking it can take weeks.


So instead of scientific breakthroughs, this campaign has relied on persuading millions of people to change basic behaviors.


Workers from the center and host governments trained volunteers to teach neighbors to filter water through cloth screens, removing tiny fleas that carry the larvae. Villagers learned to watch for and report new cases — often for rewards of $100 or more. Infected people and dogs had to be prevented from tainting water sources.


The goal was to break the worm's life cycle — and therefore eliminate the parasite itself — in each endemic community, eventually exterminating Guinea worm altogether.


The campaign became a model for confronting a broader range of neglected tropical diseases afflicting impoverished people with limited access to clean water, sanitation and health care. Expanding its public health mission, the center has supplied training, equipment and medicines that helped 22 countries eliminate at least one disease within their borders.


Mali became the latest in May 2023 when the WHO confirmed it had ended trachoma, a blinding eye infection. Haiti and the Dominican Republic are working to eliminate malaria and mosquito-borne lymphatic filariasis by 2030. Countries in Africa and the Americas are pursuing an end to river blindness by 2035.


A personal mission 


Having a former U.S. president lead the charge brought big advantages to a nonprofit that relied on private donors to fund its initiatives.


Carter's fundraising enabled the center to pour $500 million into fighting Guinea worm. He persuaded manufacturers to donate larvicide as well as nylon cloth and specially made drinking straws to filter water. His visits to afflicted villages often attracted news coverage, raising awareness globally.


"He went to so many of the localities where people were afflicted," said Dr. William Brieger, a professor of international health at Johns Hopkins University who spent 25 years in Africa. "The kind of attention that was drawn to him for getting on the ground and highlighting the plight of individual people who were suffering, I think that made an important difference."


Carter first saw the disease up close in 1988 while visiting a village in Ghana where nearly 350 people had worms poking through their skin. He approached a young woman who appeared to be cradling a baby in her arm.


"But there was no baby," Carter wrote in his 2014 book "A Call to Action." "Instead, she was holding her right breast, which was almost a foot long and had a worm emerging from the nipple."


Carter used his status to sway other leaders to play larger roles. Some heads of state got competitive, spurred by the center's charts and newsletters that showed which countries were making progress and which lagged behind.


Worms in a war zone 


In 1995, Carter intervened when a civil war in southern Sudan made it too dangerous for workers to reach hundreds of hotspots. The ceasefire he negotiated enabled the center and others to distribute 200,000 water filters and discover more endemic villages.


Carter's efforts not only stopped transmissions in much of what became South Sudan but also built trust across communities that resulted in a "significant peace dividend," said Makoy Samuel Yibi, the young nation's Guinea worm eradication director.


Pakistan in 1993 became the first endemic country to eliminate human cases. India soon followed. By 1997, the disease was no longer found in Asia. By 2003, cases reported worldwide were down to 32,000 — a 99% decline in less than two decades.


Some setbacks frustrated Carter. Visiting a hospital packed with suffering children and adults amid a 2007 resurgence in Ghana, Carter suggested publicly that the disease should perhaps be renamed "Ghana worm."


"Ghana was deeply embarrassed," Hopkins said.


Ghana ended transmission within three more years. Even more inspiring: Nigeria, which once had the most cases in the world, reached zero infections in 2009.


"That was a thunderclap," Hopkins said. "It was important throughout Africa, throughout the global campaign."


To the last worm 


Even after being diagnosed with brain cancer, Carter remained focused: "I'd like the last Guinea worm to die before I do," he told reporters in 2015.


Despite dwindling cases, total success has proven elusive.


Historic flooding and years of civil war have displaced millions of people who lack clean drinking water across central Africa. Of the 13 total cases reported in 2023, nine occurred in Chad, where infections in dogs have made the worms harder to eliminate.


"These are the most challenging places on planet Earth to operate in," said Adam Weiss, who has directed the campaign since 2018. "You need eyes and ears on the ground every single day."


The campaign still relies on about 30,000 volunteers spread among roughly 9,000 villages. Staying vigilant can be difficult now that cases are so rare, Weiss said.


"I would still like to think we will beat the timeline," Weiss said of the 2030 eradication goal. "The Carter Center is committed to this, obviously, no matter what."

## Judge denies sentencing delay for former US Senator Bob Menendez

date: 2024-12-31, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — Former U.S. Senator Bob Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey, will be sentenced on corruption charges as scheduled at the end of January, and his wife's trial will be moved from January to February, a judge said Monday. 


U.S. District Judge Sidney H. Stein in Manhattan rejected Menendez's request to delay his sentencing for his conviction on bribery and other charges until his wife finishes her trial on similar charges, possibly sometime in March. 


The Democrat's lawyers last week requested a new sentencing date on the grounds that the jury chosen to hear the case against his wife, Nadine Menendez, would be tainted if jurors heard about the outcome of the former senator's sentencing during the trial. 


Menendez, 70, was convicted in July of 16 corruption charges brought by prosecutors who asserted that he used his power in the Senate over a five-year stretch through 2022 to do favors that benefitted three New Jersey businessmen who paid him with gold bars, hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, and a Mercedes-Benz convertible. 


Two of the businessmen were convicted along with Menendez while a third pleaded guilty, cooperated with the government, and testified against him. 


Nadine Menendez has pleaded not guilty to the charges. Originally set to stand trial with her husband, her trial was put off after a breast cancer diagnosis led to surgery. Stein on Monday moved her January 21 trial to February 5. Her husband, as scheduled, will be sentenced on January 29.

## Times Square ball takes final test for New Year's Eve

date: 2024-12-31, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — The crystal-covered ball that descends down a pole in Times Square to ring in the new year was taken for a test run Monday, as New York City officials laid out their plans for the iconic New Year's Eve event. 


Officials flipped a switch to light up the dazzling geodesic sphere — weighing almost 6 tons (5.4 metric tons) and featuring 2,688 crystal triangles — which then successfully ran up and down a 139-foot (42-meter) pole atop the One Times Square skyscraper. 


Monday's rehearsal was just one of many pre-ball drop promotional events: On Sunday, fistfuls of confetti were flung toward crowds in the square in anticipation of the 3,000 pounds (1,360 kilograms) of brightly colored paper that will fill the air at midnight on New Year's Eve. Some of those pieces will include wishes written by people ahead of 2025. 


"This is the crossroads of the entire planet right here in New York City," New York City Mayor Eric Adams said earlier Monday as he and law enforcement leaders discussed their plans for security at the celebration. "People tune in at different locations and celebrate as we do the countdown for the New Year." 


Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said that although there were "no specific credible threats" to the Times Square celebrations, "the public can expect to see a tremendous amount of police resources deployed throughout the area and across the city." Plans range from "dedicated pickpocket teams" patrolling the square to sealing off all mailboxes and vending machines in the area. 


A New Year's Eve ball has dropped in Times Square for nearly 120 years, with the exception of 1942 and 1943 when nightly "dimouts" occurred during World War II to protect the city from attacks.

## California to require insurers to boost home coverage in wildfire-prone areas

date: 2024-12-31, from: VOA News USA

SACRAMENTO, California — Insurance companies that stopped providing home coverage to hundreds of thousands of Californians in recent years as wildfires became more destructive will have to again provide policies in fire-prone areas if they want to keep doing business in California under a state regulation announced Monday. 


The rule will require home insurers to offer coverage in high-risk areas, something the state has never done, Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara's office said in a statement. Insurers will have to start increasing their coverage by 5% every two years until they hit the equivalent of 85% of their market share. That means if an insurer writes 20 out of every 100 state policies, it would need to write 17 in a high-risk area, Lara's office said. 


Major insurers like State Farm and Allstate have stopped writing new policies in California because of fears of massive losses from wildfires and other natural disasters. 


In exchange for increasing coverage, the state will let insurance companies pass on the costs of reinsurance to California consumers. Insurance companies typically buy reinsurance to avoid huge payouts in case of natural disasters or catastrophic loss. California is the only state that doesn't already allow the cost of reinsurance to be borne by policyholders, according to Lara's office. 


Opponents of the rule say that could hike premiums by 40% and doesn't require new policies to be written at a fast enough pace. The state did not provide a cost analysis for potential impact on consumers. 


"This plan is of the insurance industry, by the insurance industry, and for the industry," Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog, said in a statement. 


The requirement is under review by the Office of Administrative Law before it takes effect within 30 days. 


"Californians deserve a reliable insurance market that doesn't retreat from communities most vulnerable to wildfires and climate change," Lara said in a statement. "This is a historic moment for California." 


Earlier rule


The new rule is part of Lara's effort to persuade insurers to continue doing business in the nation's most populous state. He unveiled another rule earlier this month to let insurers consider climate change when setting their prices. Insurance companies had said that because they couldn't consider climate change in their rates, many chose to either pause or restrict new business in the state. The new rule to include climate change in rates will take effect later this week. 


The ultimate goal of the new rules is to get homeowners out of the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements (FAIR) Plan, which often serves as the last resort when insurance companies stop providing coverage for those living in areas threatened by wildfires, Lara's office said. The plan could help a homeowner fulfill insurance requirements imposed by mortgage companies, but it is mainly designed as a temporary safety net with basic coverage until policyholders find a more permanent option. The number of people on California's FAIR plan more than doubled between 2020 and this year, reaching nearly 452,000 policies. 


Wildfires have always been part of life in California, where it rains for only a few months out of the year. But as the climate has gotten hotter and dryer, it has made those fires much larger and more intense. Of the top 20 most destructive wildfires in state history, 14 have occurred since 2015, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. 


The 2018 fire in Paradise, California, killed 85 people and destroyed about 11,000 homes, and some residents have struggled to find home insurance since. 


Steve Crowder, the town's mayor, lost his house and business. Since then, his family has rebuilt their home but struggled to find insurance. The Crowders were forced to enroll in FAIR Plan earlier this month. Despite paying roughly $5,000, the mayor said his home is insured for roughly $100,000 less than its value and the house's contents are only half-covered. 


"You couldn't rebuild what you got for what it's insured for," he said. 


His constituents face similar problems. With policies skyrocketing from roughly $1,200 annually before the Camp Fire to $5,000 now — or even up to $20,000 a year for large homes — some have abandoned attempts to find coverage. 


In the years after the Camp Fire, Crowder said the town has successfully brought back some insurers after enacting new ordinances with high standards to keep structures safe, such as rules regarding clearances, vegetation and fences. 


While the mayor welcomed the state's new rules, he said he and his constituents are skeptical things will improve. 


"Anything that will help get insurance in California, period, is helpful," he said, but added: "Let's wait and make sure it happens before we get excited."

## December border arrests remain down, ending Biden's term at lowest level

date: 2024-12-30, from: VOA News USA

SAN DIEGO — Arrests for illegally crossing the border from Mexico in December are little changed from a month earlier, a U.S. official said Monday, hovering near the lowest levels since July 2020 and indicating that an anticipated surge ahead of Donald Trump's inauguration as president hasn't happened. 


There were about 44,000 arrests during December as of Monday morning, suggesting the month will end close to the 46,612 arrests made in November, according to a senior U.S. Customs and Border Protection official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the count is preliminary and has not been made public. 


December will mark the sixth straight month that arrests for illegal crossings were less than the monthly average in 2019, the official said. It also signals that the final full month of President Joe Biden's presidency will be at or near the lowest during his four years in office. 


Asked to comment on the latest numbers, the Homeland Security Department released a statement by Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, that said "swift and effective implementation" of asylum restrictions in June resulted in another month below the 2019 average. 


"This sustained success is the result of strong border enforcement, extensive engagement with our foreign partners, and the delivery of safe and lawful pathways that continue to provide humanitarian relief under our laws," Mayorkas said. 


Arrests fell by about half from an all-time high of 250,000 in December 2023 after Mexican officials increased enforcement within their own borders and by about half again after Biden introduced severe asylum limits. 


Texas' Rio Grande Valley was the second-busiest corridor for illegal crossings in December, up from fifth in November, likely a reflection of tactical decisions by smuggling organizations and Mexican law enforcement, the official said. San Diego remained the busiest corridor for illegal crossings. El Paso, Texas, was third and Tucson, Arizona, was fourth. 


For the second straight month, those allowed to enter the country through official border crossings are expected to exceed arrests for illegal crossings, reflecting the Biden administration's approach to create and expand legal pathways while severely restricting asylum for those who cross the border illegally. Most legal entries are done through an online appointment system called CBP One, which grants 1,450 slots a day. 


Trump has focused on launching mass deportations after taking office Jan. 20 but he and his aides have also emphasized border measures, touting a possible return of a policy to make asylum-seekers wait in Mexico for court hearings in U.S. immigration courts. Trump said in September that he planned to end CBP One appointments.

## In Carter's hometown, a long-anticipated goodbye begins

date: 2024-12-30, from: VOA News USA

PLAINS, GEORGIA — In Jimmy Carter's tiny hometown of Plains, Georgia on Monday, the former U.S. president's death was only beginning to sink in, even if friends and neighbors have been bracing for it since he went into hospice care nearly two years ago.


Those in the rural hamlet — a half block of buildings nestled in the shadow of massive agricultural silos — said the centenarian's death was sad, but in the same breath they recounted fond memories of time spent with the former U.S. leader and global humanitarian.


Carter's commitment to Plains, where he was born 100 years ago and died Sunday at the modest home he had shared with his wife Rosalynn, is made clear by its residents — most knew him personally or have a family member who did.


“It'll always be Jimmy Carter's hometown,” Kelly Kight, who was born and raised in Plains, population approximately 600, told AFP as she placed commemorative bows near her flower shop on the main strip.




She said that more than an occasion for mourning, it was a day for remembrance of the Nobel Peace Prize laureate and his humanitarian work in particular.


Electric leaf blowers and tree trimmers provided a background chorus for the town, accustomed to gussying up quickly since it was first thrust into the national spotlight as Carter ran for president nearly 50 years ago and most recently when he began hospice care.


“When he entered hospice, it kind of became a waiting game for all of the hometown people here in the community,” said Kight, whose family owned a peanut warehouse across from the Carter's and whose father grew up alongside the Carter children.


Carter, who had an unlikely political ascent from peanut farmer to the Oval Office, is almost omnipresent in Plains — his boyhood home, high school and the former train depot which served as his 1976 presidential campaign headquarters are now museums under the National Park Service.




The town's main drag is festooned with an enormous banner heralding Carter as the 39th president, while a goofy peanut statue with Carter's trademark grin sits near his church, Maranatha Baptist. There, he welcomed visitors from around the world as he taught Sunday school into his 90s.


‘A very fine gentleman’ 


Carter's death has long been anticipated — he was last seen in public looking very frail at his wife's funeral in November 2023, after 77 years of marriage.


His funeral schedule will include a stop at his boyhood farm, before his remains are taken onward to Atlanta and Washington, then returned to his hometown for interment.




Kimberly Franklin, who also grew up in Plains, was leaving the Dollar General grocery store Monday, where she would sometimes encounter the Carters shopping like everyday people.


“I am very sad,” the residential nurse, 56, told AFP, adding that Carter was just “an awesome guy.”


Like most in Plains, she had a deeply personal memory of Carter, a profoundly religious Baptist who attended her baptism.




Several blocks away, Plains resident Johnny Jones sat in a rocking chair on his porch, across from the high school Carter attended and in clear view of downtown. He was waiting for the bustle to begin.


Jones watched as the town came to a standstill for Rosalynn Carter's funeral and as swarms of journalists descended on Plains when Jimmy Carter announced his hospice care. Jones recounted with a twinkle in his eye that the media waited two weeks for Carter to die, then turned around and left.


“I thought he was a very fine gentleman,” said Jones, an 85-year-old military retiree who liked Carter. “He did a lot for Plains.”

## US Treasury: Chinese hackers remotely accessed workstations, documents

date: 2024-12-30, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Chinese hackers remotely accessed several U.S. Treasury Department workstations and unclassified documents after compromising a third-party software service provider, the agency said Monday. 


The department did not provide details on how many workstations had been accessed or what sort of documents the hackers may have obtained, but it said in a letter to lawmakers revealing the breach that "at this time there is no evidence indicating the threat actor has continued access to Treasury information." 


"Treasury takes very seriously all threats against our systems, and the data it holds," the department said. "Over the last four years, Treasury has significantly bolstered its cyber defense, and we will continue to work with both private and public sector partners to protect our financial system from threat actors." 


The department said it learned of the problem on Dec. 8 when a third-party software service provider, BeyondTrust, flagged that hackers had stolen a key used by the vendor that helped it override the system and gain remote access to several employee workstations. 


The compromised service has since been taken offline, and there's no evidence that the hackers still have access to department information, Aditi Hardikar, an assistant Treasury secretary, said in the letter Monday to leaders of the Senate Banking Committee. 


The department said it was working with the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and that the hack had been attributed to Chinese culprits. It did not elaborate.

## US agency takes steps to protect Nevada mountains from energy development

date: 2024-12-30, from: VOA News USA

The Biden administration on Monday took steps to protect the Ruby Mountains in northeast Nevada from oil, gas and geothermal development for 20 years.


The Interior Department said it had approved an application by the U.S. Forest Service to withdraw 264,442 acres of federal lands in the Ruby Mountains from mineral and geothermal leasing.


The application's approval removes the lands from development for up to two years and kicks off a 90-day period for the public to comment on the proposed 20-year withdrawal.


The proposal comes three weeks before President-elect Donald Trump, who has vowed to step up domestic oil and gas production, succeeds President Joe Biden, a Democrat who has sought to conserve large amounts of public land.


The lands would remain open to mining claims, the Interior Department said.


"The Ruby Mountains are cherished by local communities for their scenic value, cultural heritage, numerous wildlife and benefit to the local economy through a thriving outdoor recreation industry," Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said in a statement. "Today, we are taking an important and sensible step to pause new oil and gas leasing to ensure that we have the science and public input necessary to inform proposed protections of the Ruby Mountains area for future generations."

## VOA Mandarin: Outlook for US-China relations in the New Year

date: 2024-12-30, from: VOA News USA

As former President Donald Trump is set to return to the White House, Reuters reported on Dec. 24 that China will issue a record 3 trillion yuan in government bonds next year in an effort to rescue its crisis-stricken economy and mitigate the impact of potential significant tariff hikes by Trump.  


This marks the latest sign of China’s concern that bilateral relations may quickly plunge to a new low during Trump's second term. For a long time, a basic assumption about U.S.-China relations has been that even when relations deteriorate, they won’t fall too far. Looking ahead to the new year, Trump is set to bring an unusually hard-line, hawkish team on China into the White House.

## Biden declares January 9 a day of mourning for Carter

date: 2024-12-30, from: VOA News USA

Washington — President Joe Biden has declared January 9 a national day of mourning for former President Jimmy Carter and announced Monday that all federal government offices would be closed that day as a show of respect for the 39th U.S. president, who died Sunday at age 100.


"I call on the American people to assemble on that day in their respective places of worship, there to pay homage to the memory of President James Earl Carter Jr.," Biden said in a formal declaration issued late Sunday. "I invite the people of the world who share our grief to join us in this solemn observance."




The solemn event January 9 in the nation's capital will draw all the living American presidents and a host of dignitaries. Biden also ordered the U.S. flag to be flown at half-staff for 30 days from the date of Carter's death at public buildings, military posts and U.S. government buildings overseas.


Events begin Saturday


Biden has bestowed upon Carter a state funeral, a three-stage multiday event coordinated by the U.S. military that includes observances in the capital and ceremonies in the home state of the deceased. Carter has repeatedly expressed his wish to be buried in his front yard in the small town of Plains, Georgia, beside his wife of 77 years, Rosalynn. She died in 2023. Carter was in hospice care for two years before his own death at 100 made him the longest-living former president in U.S. history.




Observances for this peanut-farmer-turned-president will stretch over several days and involve coordination by local, state and national law enforcement, the military and the countless elected officials and members of the public expected to pay their respects.


It begins Saturday, in Georgia. Members of Carter's Secret Service detail will accompany his hearse as it travels in a motorcade through Plains. The motorcade will pass his family's farm, where members of the National Park Service will ring the farm bell 39 times to symbolize his status as the 39th president. The motorcade will proceed to the state Capitol, in Atlanta, where it will be greeted by the governor, the city's mayor, members of the state Legislature and state troopers.




Carter's remains will then be taken to the Carter Presidential Center for an afternoon service. He will lie in repose through Tuesday, January 7.


On that day, the president's surviving family will accompany his remains as they travel on a special Air Force plane to Washington. In Washington, the former naval officer's remains will be taken by hearse motorcade to the U.S. Navy Memorial. A horse-drawn ceremonial procession will complete his trip from there to the U.S. Capitol, where military body bearers will carry him into the heart of the building, the rotunda. Members of Congress will hold an afternoon service, and his body will lie in state there, with a military guard of honor, until the morning of January 9.




The Washington National Cathedral will hold the national funeral service at 10 a.m. That structure has played host to several previous state funerals, including those of former Presidents Ronald Reagan, Gerald Ford and George H.W. Bush.


Carter's funeral is likely to be attended by all five living American presidents — a list that includes George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, former and future President Donald Trump, and Biden. Biden, at 82, is now the eldest statesman of that group.


Biden inadvertently revealed, in March last year at a national Democratic Party event, that Carter, also a Democrat, had asked him to deliver his eulogy.




In his statement late Sunday, Biden described Carter as "a man of character, courage and compassion, whose lifetime of service defined him as one of the most influential statesmen in our history."


He continued: "He embodied the very best of America: A humble servant of God and the people. A heroic champion of global peace and human rights, and an honorable leader whose moral clarity and hopeful vision lifted our nation and changed our world."


The end, with Rosalynn 


Carter's final voyage happens in Georgia, on the afternoon of January 9. His family will hold a private service at the Carters' home church, Maranatha Baptist Church.


And then the motorcade will wind its way back along those familiar roads, to Plains, and to the low-slung home the Carters built, where they raised their children, and where they settled after the White House. The U.S. Navy will perform a missing-man formation flyover right before Carter is lowered into his final resting place, next to Rosalynn.

## Jimmy Carter's passing met with mixed reactions in China, Taiwan

date: 2024-12-30, from: VOA News USA

Taipei, Taiwan — The passing of former United States President Jimmy Carter was met with mixed reactions in China and Taiwan. Chinese President Xi Jinping praised him for helping to establish diplomatic ties between Beijing and Washington while some in Taiwan remain critical of his decision to sever official ties with the island to this day.


In a message to U.S. President Joe Biden, Xi expressed his “deep condolences” and described Carter as “the driving force behind the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United States.” 


Former President Carter “made important contributions to the development of China-U.S. relations and the friendly exchanges and cooperation between the two countries,” China’s state-run broadcaster CCTV cited Xi as saying.


"China-U.S. ties are among the most import bilateral relationships in the world," Xi said, adding that Beijing is willing to work with Washington to advance bilateral relations. 


During Carter’s time in office between 1977 and 1981, the U.S. established formal diplomatic relations with China, advancing the groundwork laid by former U.S. President Richard Nixon and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in the 1970s. 


In 1979, his administration recognized the People’s Republic of China (PRC) as the sole legal government of China and acknowledged Beijing’s position that Taiwan is a part of China. He also agreed to sever official ties with Taiwan, charting a new course in what would later become one of the world’s most complicated and consequential relationships. 


Much like Xi, many Chinese commentators and internet users praised Carter’s contribution to normalizing U.S.-China relations. 


Hu Xijin, the former editor-in-chief of China’s state-run tabloid Global Times, said Carter helped to lay the foundation of the “friendly and cooperative relationship” between China and the U.S. by acknowledging China’s position on Taiwan.


While “his starting point is to safeguard the interests of the United States, during his term, China and the United States of America's common interests have been highlighted and highlighted,” he wrote in a statement on the Chinese social media platform Weibo. 


Other Chinese internet users also characterized Carter as being more friendly to China than other U.S. leaders. “Of all the living former U.S. presidents, he is one of the friendlier to China,” Chinese netizen “Sheng Yuan Ran Dong” from Heilongjiang province wrote on Weibo.


“He was a good pacifist. He opened the floodgates of history by establishing diplomatic relations between China and the U.S. His good qualities are truly worth highlighting,” Chinese internet user “Abu from the magic forest” from Jiangxi Province wrote on Weibo.


Lu Chao, the director of Liaoning University’s Institute of American and East Asian Studies, said Carter not only facilitated the establishment of U.S.-China relations, he also maintained very good relations with then-Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping. 


“Former President Carter made the right choice that was in line with the trend of global development, the fundamental interests of the United States, and the interests of China. It is still praised by Chinese and American people,” he told VOA. 


Mixed reactions in Taiwan  


While reactions from China to Carter’s passing were largely positive, perceptions about the former U.S. president’s complicated legacy in Taiwan were mixed. In a short post on social media platform X, Taiwan’s Presidential Office extended “sincere condolences” to Carter’s family and the American people.




Meanwhile, Taiwan’s main opposition party Kuomintang (KMT), said on X that while Carter will be remembered in Taiwan “for his decision to derecognize the Republic of China” — Taiwan’s official name — they “admire his advocacy worldwide for affordable housing, conflict resolution, refugees, and other causes.”




In contrast to the moderate official response, some Taiwanese internet users criticized the former U.S. president for allowing China to become a major threat to Taiwan. 


While “the U.S. is now Taiwan’s strong ally, [Carter and Kissinger] are the ones who made China so difficult to deal with. From the two of them to the Obama era, Washington’s pro-China approach allowed China to build economic growth for decades and that’s the reason why the Chinese Communist Party can keep bullying Taiwan,” Taiwanese internet user Pbtato Hsieh wrote in a Facebook post. 


After the Carter administration severed ties with Taiwan in 1979, the U.S. Congress passed the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA), later the same year, which allows Washington to maintain close unofficial ties with Taipei while requiring the U.S. to “provide Taiwan with arms of a defensive character” to “a sufficient self-defense capacity.”


The TRA also reaffirmed the United States commitment to preserving the human rights of the people of Taiwan. At the time the legislation was signed into law by then President Carter, Taiwan was under martial law and under the control of one single party, the KMT, which was led by Chiang Ching-kuo. Taiwan continued under martial law until 1989 and held its first direct presidential elections in 1996.


While Carter signed the TRA into law, some Taiwanese analysts say the former president shouldn’t be credited for providing the architecture that upholds the unofficial relations between Taiwan and the U.S. today. 


“It was because the government in Taiwan under Chiang Kai-shek and some grassroots Taiwanese American organizations maintained good relations with members of the U.S. Congress, so the Congress passed a piece of legislation that was more favorable toward Taiwan,” Chen Fang-yu, a political scientist at Soochow University in Taiwan, told VOA by phone. 


“The Taiwan Relations Act was not directly related to Carter,” he added. 


Despite his complicated legacy of handling Washington’s relations with Taiwan, other experts say Carter’s decision to sign the TRA into law still helped to build the “first blocks of today’s U.S.-Taiwan relationship.” 


“The de facto relationship that the U.S. and Taiwan have today began with him,” said Lev Nachman, a political scientist at National Taiwan University. 


“I don't think he was the one who sat down and wrote the TRA, but he most certainly is the one who saw through the process of creating this new relationship with Taiwan after the recognition switch,” he told VOA by phone.

## State funeral to be held for former President Jimmy Carter

date: 2024-12-30, from: VOA News USA

Atlanta, GA. — VOA Correspondent Kane Farabaugh conducted numerous interviews with Jimmy Carter on issues ranging from his time in the White House to his post-presidential career as a promoter of global health and democracy. Highlights of those interviews are contained in this report.


A state funeral will be held January 9 for former U.S. President Jimmy Carter who died Sunday at the age of 100.


U.S. President Joe Biden scheduled the state funeral for Carter to be held the same day as National Day of Mourning. Biden has also directed flags at public buildings to be displayed at half-staff for 30 days in honor of Carter.


Carter was a peanut farmer and a Georgia state governor before becoming president. When he took the oath of office as president of the United States on January 20, 1977, he promised a "government as good as its people."


He presided over four turbulent years. Rising inflation and growing unemployment marred the domestic priorities of his administration. He scored victories in foreign policy with a peace agreement between Egypt and Israel and the Panama Canal treaty. However, a hostage crisis in Iran dominated his final years in the White House and contributed to his defeat in the 1980 general election.




But Carter liked to say the end of his presidency in 1981 was the beginning of a new life, traveling the world "fighting disease, building hope, and waging peace."


"It has turned out to open up for me and my wife, Rosalynn, a new arena of excitement and unpredictability and adventure and challenge and gratification," he told VOA.


As the head of the Carter Center, the Carters traveled to more than 80 countries monitoring troubled elections, mediating disputes, and fighting diseases. This active post-White House life eventually led to the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002.


"I look upon the Carter Center work as an extension of what I tried to do as president. You know, we brought peace between Israel and Egypt. We opened up a humongous relationship with Latin America with the Panama Canal treaty," he said. "So what I have done since then has been kind of an extension. But I do not think there is any doubt that when I won the Nobel Peace Prize, for instance, it was because of the work of the Carter Center. So, I would be perfectly satisfied to have a legacy based on peace and human rights. I mean, who would not?"


U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres praised Carter’s “commitment to international peace and human rights.


“President Carter will be remembered for his solidarity with the vulnerable, his abiding grace, and his unrelenting faith in the common good and our common humanity,” Guterres said in a statement. “His legacy as a peacemaker, human rights champion and humanitarian will endure.”




The White House released a statement from President Biden and first lady Jill Biden on Sunday. It said, “Over six decades, we had the honor of calling Jimmy Carter a dear friend. But, what’s extraordinary about Jimmy Carter, though, is that millions of people throughout America and the world who never met him thought of him as a dear friend as well.”


President-elect Donald Trump posted on Truth Social: “The challenges Jimmy faced as President came at a pivotal time for our country and he did everything in his power to improve the lives of all Americans. For that, we all owe him a debt of gratitude.”




Carter's journey to the White House began in the small town of Plains, Georgia, where he was born October 1, 1924.


After serving as an officer in the U.S. Navy, where he helped develop the post-World War II nuclear submarine fleet, Carter returned to his hometown in 1953 to run the family peanut-farming business.


He entered politics in the 1960s, serving two terms as a Georgia legislator before becoming the state's 76th governor from 1971 to 1975.


In the 1976 presidential election, Carter, a Democrat, ran against Republican incumbent Gerald Ford, who assumed the presidency after Richard Nixon resigned in the wake of the Watergate scandal. Carter narrowly defeated Ford to become president.




The high point of Carter's presidency came in 1978. Carter brought Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin to the Camp David presidential retreat in rural Maryland to negotiate a peace treaty.


"When I became president, there had been four wars between Arabs and Israelis in the previous 25 years, with the Egyptians in the leadership supported by the Soviet Union," he said. "They were the only country that could really challenge Israel militarily. And we had success in getting a treaty between Israel and Egypt … not a word of which has ever been violated."




Carter also negotiated a treaty turning control of the Panama Canal over to the Panamanian government and normalized diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China.


But in 1979 the primary focus for Carter's administration turned to Iran, where a revolution led by religious clerics toppled the government of the U.S.-backed shah, who eventually fled to the United States, where he received treatment for cancer.


On November 4, 1979, militants angry with the U.S. for harboring the deposed shah stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, taking 66 Americans hostage; 13 were released weeks later.


Five months into the crisis, in April 1980, Carter authorized a complex military operation to free the remaining hostages. Dubbed Operation Eagle Claw, the plan called for several helicopters and military aircraft to stage at a site in the Iranian desert. Carter, who approved the plan, explained to VOA that the helicopters carrying members of the U.S. military's elite Delta Force were to fly from there to the U.S. embassy in Tehran, free the hostages and return to the waiting aircraft that would fly them out of Iran.


"The minimum number of helicopters required would be six very large helicopters. So I decided to send eight. One of the helicopters, in an inexplicable way, turned around and went back to the aircraft carrier. Another one went down in a sandstorm in the Iranian desert. The third one developed a hydraulic leak and ran into one of the C-130 airplanes," he said.


The aborted mission ended in failure. Eight U.S. military members and one Iranian civilian died as a result of the crash. Walter Mondale, Carter’s vice president, told VOA that day was the lowest point of their administration.


"When that rescue mission failed and lives were lost. I mean, that was just ... we were just morose that day and for some time after that," Mondale said. Secretary of State Cyrus Vance resigned in protest of the operation.


The failure of the mission damaged Carter's credibility with the American public. The incident occurred seven months before the 1980 presidential election and contributed to Carter's defeat to challenger Ronald Reagan.


"The exact anniversary of the hostages being taken was Election Day," Carter said. "Of course, the news media were completely obsessed with the anniversary of the hostages being taken and the fact that I had not been able to get them out. That was the number one issue that caused me to fail.”




The hostages were freed the day Reagan became president.


In 1981, Carter returned to Plains, unsure about the direction of his post-presidential life. His plans for a library and museum were initially modest.


"I envisioned it to be a tiny thing, where I would have an office and some nice buildings in Atlanta. And that anyone in the world that had an ongoing conflict or potential conflict could come to me and I would help them mediate the dispute and stop a war," he said.


The Carter Center, under his direction, monitored more then 80 troubled elections and mediated disputes ranging from a nuclear standoff with North Korea in 1994, to a peace agreement between Uganda and Sudan in 1999. The center is also a leader in promoting health and fighting disease in the poorest parts of the planet.


In one of many interviews with Voice of America, Carter reflected on his life in and out of the White House. He said the greatest part of his legacy wasn't his accomplishments as president or the Nobel Peace Prize, but the eradication of Guinea worm disease.


"There's only been one disease in the history of humankind, ever eradicated, and that was smallpox,” he said, “So Guinea worm is going to soon be the second disease in history, to be wiped off the face of the Earth."


Thanks to Carter’s efforts, only 13 cases of Guinea worm were recorded in 2022.


Carter led an active life until the age of 99, surviving brain cancer in 2015.


Declining health and the 2020 global coronavirus pandemic kept him confined to his hometown of Plains in his final years.


Jimmy Carter last appeared in public during funeral services for his wife, Rosalynn, in November 2023.




In one of his last public media appearances, Carter shared with VOA his hopes for the Carter Center’s future.


“I would like to see the United States in the future strive to be the number one champion in the world of peace and human rights and environmental quality, and I would say treating everyone equal,” he said. “If we could do that, we would have a real superpower in the country I love very much.”


Jimmy Carter lived the longest of any occupant of the White House, and his 77-year marriage to wife Rosalynn is the longest of any president and first lady.


Although his final resting place will be on the grounds of his home in Plains, Georgia, the work and the words of Carter live on in the pages of the dozens of books he authored throughout his life. It includes his memoirs, a fiction novel, controversial examinations of the Middle East, and a collection of his favorite poems.

## German government seeks to downplay Musk's backing of far-right party ahead of general election

date: 2024-12-30, from: VOA News USA

Berlin — The German government on Monday sought to downplay efforts by tech entrepreneur Elon Musk to get involved in the country's general election campaign by again endorsing the far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, party.


Musk caused uproar over the weekend after backing the AfD in an opinion piece in a major newspaper, leading to the resignation of the paper's opinion editor in protest.


"Freedom of expression also includes the greatest nonsense," government spokesperson Christiane Hoffmann said, adding that she wouldn't comment further on Musk's statements.


She did, however, say that "it is indeed the case that Elon Musk is trying to influence the federal election through his statement."


In that context, Hoffmann also pointed out that the AfD is being monitored by Germany's domestic intelligence service on suspicion of being right-wing extremist and that it has already been recognized as such in some individual German states.


Germany is to vote in an early election on Feb. 23 after Chancellor Olaf Scholz's three-party governing coalition collapsed last month in a dispute over how to revitalize the country's stagnant economy.


Musk's guest opinion piece for Welt am Sonntag published in German over the weekend, was the second time this month he had supported Alternative for Germany, or AfD.




"The Alternative for Germany (AfD) is the last spark of hope for this country," Musk wrote in his translated commentary.


He went on to say the far-right party "can lead the country into a future where economic prosperity, cultural integrity and technological innovation are not just wishes, but reality."


The Tesla Motors CEO also wrote that his investment in Germany gave him the right to comment on the country's condition.


The AfD is polling strongly, but its candidate for the top job, Alice Weidel, has no realistic chance of becoming chancellor because other parties refuse to work with the far-right party.




An ally of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, the technology billionaire challenged in his opinion piece the party's public image.


"The portrayal of the AfD as right-wing extremist is clearly false, considering that Alice Weidel, the party's leader, has a same-sex partner from Sri Lanka! Does that sound like Hitler to you? Please!"


Musk's commentary has led to a debate in German media over the boundaries of free speech, with the paper's own opinion editor announcing her resignation, pointedly on Musk's social media platform, X.


"I always enjoyed leading the opinion section of WELT and WAMS. Today an article by Elon Musk appeared in Welt am Sonntag. I handed in my resignation yesterday after it went to print," Eva Marie Kogel wrote.


The newspaper was attacked by politicians and other media for offering Musk, a foreigner, a platform.


Musk's opinion piece in the Welt am Sonntag was accompanied by a critical article by the future editor-in-chief of the Welt group, Jan Philipp Burgard, who wrote that while some of Musk's diagnoses of Germany's problems may be correct "his therapeutic approach, that only the AfD can save Germany, is fatally wrong."

## The Hottest Climate Debates of 2024

date: 2024-12-30, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTM2OTA4OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczNzUwNjU1Mn0.CSYtxU8u104ESeEzOCx5KVS4d1WVFBeCC65E_n-JXNQ/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">The end of 2024 marks the end of four of the busiest years the climate and clean energy community has seen to date. I think it's safe to say the energy transition is in full swing (despite certain opinions <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/chris-wright-energy#:~:text=There%20is%20no%20climate%20crisis%2C%20and%20we%E2%80%99re%20not%20in%20the%20midst%20of%20an%20energy%20transition" target="_self"><u>to the contrary</u></a>), even if it's not yet on a glide path to a future that would avoid devastating climate impacts. </p><p>But with progress comes a new kind of conflict: infighting. Which climate solutions are the <em><em>best</em></em> climate solutions? How can we implement them the <em><em>right way?</em></em> When should other priorities, like affordability and national security, come first, if they should at all? Are those trade-offs even real? Or are they fossil fuel propaganda?</p><p>In a <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/the-climate-coalition-is-threatening-to-split-apart" target="_self"><u>fantastic piece</u></a> for Heatmap last year, researcher Joshua Lappen drew attention to this increasingly combative undercurrent in the climate coalition, inflamed by the debate over whether a <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/permitting-bill-manchin-barrasso-westerman" target="_self"><u>compromise on permitting reform</u></a> would be better for the climate in the long run than no reform at all. That fight — along with the related question of whether conservationists are slowing climate action — continued into 2024. But it wasn’t the only thing climate advocates fought about. Here are four debates that dominated the discourse this year that I think will continue into 2025.</p><h3>1. Will expanding U.S. liquefied natural gas exports help fight climate change or make it worse?</h3><p>Biden ignited a firestorm of controversy in January when he <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/01/26/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-temporary-pause-on-pending-approvals-of-liquefied-natural-gas-exports/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>paused approvals</u></a> of new liquefied natural gas export terminals until the Department of Energy could re-evaluate LNG’s potential economic and environmental impacts. The move followed protests from environmental groups that had named these facilities their number one climate bogeyman, arguing that new terminals would, as <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-13/natural-gas-export-projects-hang-in-the-balance-as-biden-mulls-climate-test" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Bill McKibben put it</u></a>, “install our reliance on fossil fuels for decades to come.”</p><p>What followed was much back and forth about whether growing U.S. LNG exports would help or hurt efforts to stop climate change. To be sure, producing and burning natural gas releases planet-warming emissions. But past government and academic studies have found that exporting U.S. natural gas could result in lower global emissions overall by helping other countries replace dirtier fuels such as coal or natural gas from Russia, where the industry has much higher methane emissions. Environmentalists pushed back on that narrative, citing a <a href="https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2024/10/liquefied-natural-gas-carbon-footprint-worse-coal" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>study</u></a> by Robert Howarth, a Cornell scientist, which found that producing and transporting LNG could be worse for the climate than coal. Critics then <a href="https://thebreakthrough.org/issues/energy/a-major-paper-on-liquified-natural-gas-emissions-is-riddled-with-errors" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pounced on Howarth's study</u></a>, accusing him of using flawed assumptions about upstream methane emissions, LNG tanker size, and shipping route distances. </p><p>Ultimately, calculating the emissions impact of increased LNG exports requires making <em><em>a lot</em></em> of assumptions. How can we know, for example, whether creating a cheap supply of natural gas will displace coal or deter adoption of renewables? As Arvind Ravikumar, an expert in energy emissions modeling, <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/lng-exports-pause-biden-emissions" target="_self"><u>told my colleague Matthew Zeitlin</u></a>, “There’s no right answer. It depends on who buys, what time frame, which country, and how are they using LNG.”</p><p>A week before Christmas, the Biden administration finally put out its long-awaited study. It modeled a number of different scenarios, but found that approving additional LNG exports beyond what’s already in the pipeline would likely produce at least a small increase in emissions by 2050 in all of them. The report also found that demand from U.S. allies in Europe and elsewhere would be met by projects that have already been approved, making additional plants “neither sustainable nor advisable,” as Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm wrote. </p><p>The <a href="https://www.aga.org/news/news-releases/aga-condemns-last-minute-lng-report/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>natural gas industry</u></a> and its <a href="https://www.uschamber.com/energy/u-s-chamber-comprehensive-new-s-p-global-analysis-demonstrates-importance-of-lng-exports" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>supporters</u></a> were quick to question the results, and they’re about to have a much more sympathetic ear in the Trump administration. But the report gives activists a considerable weapon to use in future lawsuits if Trump tries to put LNG approvals on the fast track.</p><h3>2. Is the climate movement too obsessed with disinformation?</h3><p>I checked my phone after dinner one evening in August to find the members of climate X (formerly known as climate Twitter) suddenly at each other's throats over a <a href="https://jacobin.com/2024/08/climate-disinformation-green-transition-workers" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>provocative essay published in </u><u><em><em>Jacobin</em></em></u></a> titled “Obsessing Over Climate Disinformation Is a Wrong Turn.” Written by the environmental sociologist Holly Buck, the essay argues that too much focus on the oil and gas industry’s disinformation campaigns risks dismissing or overlooking legitimate concerns people have about the energy transition. “Fighting disinformation becomes a cheap hack for the hard work of listening to people and learning from them,” wrote Buck. “We have to put resources into a different sort of public engagement with climate change, one that sees publics as competent and nuanced rather than as susceptible marks for memes.”</p><p>The message struck a nerve. While many praised the essay, a number of prominent climate activists and journalists with large online followings attacked it, defending the urgency of combating disinformation and accusing Buck of setting up a false dichotomy between this work and public engagement. Aaron Regunberg, a former Rhode Island state representative and lawyer for the nonprofit Public Citizen, <a href="https://jacobin.com/2024/08/climate-crisis-disinformation-fossil-fuels" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>wrote a response in </u><u><em><em>Jacobin</em></em></u></a> charging Buck with “arguing with a straw man” and not understanding how insidious the oil industry’s disinformation strategies are. </p><p>Buck tried to clarify her view in a <a href="https://jacobin.com/2024/08/climate-disinformation-fossil-fuels-ngos" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>followup piece</u></a>, asserting that she was not denying that disinformation was a “serious obstacle to climate action,” but rather that the act of “fighting disinformation” won’t solve what she sees as underlying problems working against the energy transition: the absence of an engagement apparatus that helps regular people understand their options, and a media ecosystem that “profits from our hate and division.”</p><p>What’s clear moving forward is that with a <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-fact-check-intro" target="_self"><u>clean energy </u></a>opponent entering the White House and a mega-billionaire who, with X, literally owns a chunk of the media ecosystem standing by his side, both disinformation and the framework that supports it will stay in the spotlight.</p><h3>3. Will data centers stall the energy transition?</h3><p>After remaining basically flat for two decades, U.S. electricity demand is set to grow by an average of 3% per year over the next five years, according to the <a href="https://gridstrategiesllc.com/wp-content/uploads/National-Load-Growth-Report-2024.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>latest forecast</u></a> from the energy policy consulting firm Grid Strategies. Domestic manufacturing will drive some of the demand, it predicts, but the majority will come from the buildout of data centers, “supercharged” by the rise of artificial intelligence.</p><p>On one hand, many of the companies building data centers have ambitious clean energy goals. Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and others have signed landmark deals with advanced nuclear and geothermal power companies, helping to get first-of-a-kind deployments of these technologies financed. If those projects are successful, they could pave the way for cheaper, cleaner, 24/7 power for the rest of us. </p><p>But energy-hungry AI is already causing those tech giants to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/climate-google-environmental-report-greenhouse-gases-emissions-3ccf95b9125831d66e676e811ece8a18" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>fall behind on their targets</u></a> and driving major investments in fossil fuel infrastructure. My colleague Matthew Zeitlin has chronicled how electricity demand growth is making it harder to close <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/elgin-natural-gas-pjm" target="_self"><u>natural gas</u></a> and <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/coal-gas-plant-retirements" target="_self"><u>coal plants</u></a> . In the states that data centers are flocking to, such as Virginia, North Carolina, and Texas, utilities are revising their integrated resource plans to <a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/data-centers-want-clean-electricity-can-georgia-power-deliver-it" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>increase the amount of natural gas generation</u></a> they expect to deliver. Exxon and Chevron are gearing up to build natural gas generation “behind the meter,” i.e. serving data centers directly, so they can meet demand more quickly than if they had to hook up to the grid. The gas pipeline company Williams is also planning a <a href="https://www.williams.com/2024/08/20/powering-up-meeting-energy-demand-across-the-mid-atlantic-and-southeast/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Southeast expansion</u></a> to serve data center demand. Energy equipment manufacturer GE Vernova is <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/ge-vernova-natural-gas-ai" target="_self"><u>seeing orders for natural gas turbines skyrocket</u></a>. </p><p>There are layers to this debate. Should policymakers require hyperscalers to <a href="https://heatmap.news/ideas/ai-additionality-framework" target="_self"><u>bring online new sources of clean energy</u></a> to power their data centers, or will that <a href="https://heatmap.news/ideas/abundance-additionality-permitting-reform" target="_self"><u>prove counterproductive</u></a> and “dampen investment in new industries” — a trade-off familiar to anyone following the <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/green-hydrogen-tax-credit-treasury" target="_self"><u>back-and-forth over clean hydrogen</u></a>? And is it possible that all the fuss about data center demand is <a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-episode-10-ai-data-centers" target="_self"><u>overblown</u></a>? Is there even a <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/189460/ai-data-centers-coal-fossil-fuels-energy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>business case for AI that supports this buildout</u></a>?</p><p>The incoming Trump administration has <a href="https://x.com/leezeldin/status/1856305964527350149" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>promised</u></a> to “unleash U.S. energy dominance” and “make America the AI capital of the world,” so it’s likely this will continue to be one of the top questions for climate hawks for the foreseeable future. </p><h3>4. Are EVs tanking or taking off?</h3><p>The debate over the state of electric vehicle sales <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/are-ev-sales-really-slowing-data" target="_self"><u>didn’t start in 2024</u></a>, but headlines this year continued to sow confusion over whether or not EVs are catching on in the way climate advocates — and carmakers — hoped. </p><p>Each of the big three automakers, as well as most of the remaining companies serving North America, revised down their EV production plans this year, citing a waning market. In July, General Motors CEO Mary Barra said the company wasn’t going to hit its goal of producing a million EVs per year in North America by 2025. “We’re seeing a little bit of a slowdown here,” she <a href="https://x.com/SawyerMerritt/status/1812943267023274012" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said on CNBC</u></a>. “The market just isn’t developing. But we will get there.” Ford <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/ford-ev-suv-canceled" target="_self"><u>cancelled plans</u></a> to produce an electric three-row SUV, delayed its release of an electric medium-sized pickup truck until 2027, and paused production of the F-150 Lightning, and has decided to shift its near-term focus to <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/ford-maverick-hybrid-q1-sales" target="_self"><u>selling hybrids</u></a>. </p><p>Among non-U.S. automakers, Stellantis delayed the release of a new <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/744905/ram-1500-ramcharger-rev-delay/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>EV Ram pickup truck</u></a> and will put out a hybrid version instead. Volkswagen delayed the North America release of an electric sedan. Several luxury automakers, including Aston Martin and Bentley, delayed the release of their first EVs until 2027. Mercedes-Benz once strived to have EVs make up 50% of its sales in 2025 — now it’s trying to hit that mark in 2030. Tesla sales also slowed significantly in the first half of the year. CEO Elon Musk <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/738534/tesla-25000-car-robotaxi-musk/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>cancelled plans to build a new low-cost EV</u></a>.</p><p>But while sales numbers may not have met individual automakers’ expectations, overall sales continued to grow. “For every sign of an EV slowdown, another suggests an adolescent industry on the verge of its next growth spurt,” <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-28/the-slowdown-in-us-electric-vehicle-sales-looks-more-like-a-blip" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>Bloomberg</em></em></u></a> reported mid-way through the year. During the third quarter, GM saw record EV sales. Honda’s debut EV, the Prologue, jumped up the charts to become one of the top-selling offerings on the market. After looking at <a href="https://www.coxautoinc.com/market-insights/q3-2024-ev-sales/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>third quarter numbers</u></a>, Cox Automotive analysts opined that “a 10% [market] share is well within reach.”</p><p>We’ll have to see how Trump’s <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-kill-ev-tax-credit" target="_self"><u>plans to eliminate consumer subsidies for EVs</u></a> changes that outlook, but expect there to be plenty more fodder for debate.</p>

## Linda Lavin, Tony-winning Broadway actress who starred in sitcom 'Alice,' dies at 87

date: 2024-12-30, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — Linda Lavin, a Tony Award-winning stage actress who became a working class icon as a paper-hat wearing waitress on the TV sitcom "Alice," has died. She was 87. 


Lavin died in Los Angeles on Sunday of complications from recently discovered lung cancer, her representative, Bill Veloric, told The Associated Press in an email. 


A success on Broadway, Lavin tried her luck in Hollywood in the mid-1970s. She was chosen to star in a new CBS sitcom based on "Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore," the Martin Scorsese-directed film that won Ellen Burstyn an Oscar for playing the title waitress. 


The title was shortened to "Alice" and Lavin became a role model for working moms as Alice Hyatt, a widowed mother with a 12-year-old son working in a roadside diner outside Phoenix. The show, with Lavin singing the theme song "There's a New Girl in Town," ran from 1976 to 1985. 


The show turned "Kiss my grits" into a catchphrase and co-starred Polly Holliday as waitress Flo and Vic Tayback as the gruff owner and head chef of Mel's Diner. 


The series bounced around the CBS schedule during its first two seasons but became a hit leading into "All in the Family" on Sunday nights in October 1977. It was among primetime's top 10 series in four of the next five seasons. Variety magazine listed it among the all-time best workplace comedies. 


Lavin soon went on to win a Tony for best actress in a play for Neil Simon's "Broadway Bound" in 1987. 


She was working as recently as this month promoting a new Netflix series in which she appears, "No Good Deed," and filming a forthcoming Hulu series, "Mid-Century Modern," according to Deadline, which first reported her death. 


Lavin grew up in Portland, Maine, and moved to New York City after graduating from the College of William and Mary. She sang in nightclubs and in ensembles of shows. 


Iconic producer and director Hal Prince gave Lavin her first big break while directing the Broadway musical "It's a Bird ... It's a Plane ... It's Superman." She went on to earn a Tony nomination in Simon's "Last of the Red Hot Lovers" in 1969 before winning 18 years later for another Simon play, "Broadway Bound." 


In the mid 1970s, Lavin moved to Los Angeles. She had a recurring role on "Barney Miller" and in 1976 was chosen to star in a new CBS sitcom based on Ellen Burstyn's Oscar-winning waitress comedy-drama, "Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore." 


Back on Broadway, Lavin later starred Paul Rudnick's comedy "The New Century," had a concert show called "Songs & Confessions of a One-Time Waitress" and earned a Tony nomination in Donald Margulies' "Collected Stories." 


Michael Kuchwara of the AP gave Lavin a rave in "Collected Stories," writing that she "gives one of those complete, nuanced performances, capturing the woman's intellectual vigor, her wry sense of humor and her increasing physical frailty with astonishing fidelity. And Lavin's sense of timing is superb, whether delivering a joke or acerbically dissecting the work of her protegee." 


Lavin basked in a burst of renewed attention in her 70s, earning a Tony nomination for Nicky Silver's "The Lyons." She also starred in "Other Desert Cities" and a revival of "Follies" before they transferred to Broadway. 


The AP again raved about Lavin in "The Lyons," calling her "an absolute wonder to behold as Rita Lyons, a nag of a mother with a collection of firm beliefs and eye rolls, a matriarch who is both suffocating and keeping everyone at arm's length." 


She also appeared in the film "Wanderlust" with Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd, and released her first CD, "Possibilities." She played Jennifer Lopez's grandmother in "The Back-Up Plan." 


When asked for guidance from up-and-coming actresses, Lavin stressed one thing. "I say that what happened for me was that work brings work. As long as it wasn't morally reprehensible to me, I did it," she told the AP in 2011. 


She and Steve Bakunas, an artist, musician and her third husband, converted an old automotive garage into the 50-seat Red Barn Studio Theatre in Wilmington, North Carolina. 


It opened in 2007 and their productions include "Doubt" by John Patrick Shanley, "Glengarry Glen Ross" by David Mamet, "Rabbit Hole" by David Lindsay-Abaire and "The Tale of the Allergist's Wife" by Charles Busch, in which Lavin also starred on Broadway, earning a Tony nomination. 


She returned to TV in 2013 in "Sean Saves the World," starring "Will & Grace's" Sean Hayes, a show which lasted a season. Lavin also made appearances on "Mom" and "9JKL."

## Stock market today: Asian shares mixed after Wall Street slips, led by tech giants

date: 2024-12-30, from: VOA News USA

Asian shares were mixed on Monday after stocks fell broadly on Friday as Wall Street closed out a holiday-shortened week on a down note. 


U.S. futures were lower while oil prices were little changed. 


In Asia, South Korea's Kospi added 0.6% to 2,418.80. But shares of Jeju Air Co. lost 8.8% after one of the company's jets skidded off a runway, slammed into a concrete fence, and burst into flames Sunday in South Korea as its landing gear failed to deploy. 179 people died in the crash. 


Political turmoil continued as South Korean law enforcement officials requested a court warrant on Monday to detain impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol. They are investigating whether his martial law decree on December 3 amounted to rebellion. 


Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index lost 0.9% to 39,914.21 as the dollar gained against the Japanese yen, trading at 157.83 yen, up from 157.75 yen. The Tokyo market will wrap up trading for 2024 with a year-end ceremony as Japan begins its New Year holidays, the biggest festival of the year. 


The Hang Seng in Hong Kong shed 0.3% to 20,030.63 while the Shanghai Composite index was up 0.3% at 3,408.72. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 dipped 0.9% to 8,191.50. 


On Friday, the S&P 500 fell 1.1% to 5,970.84. Roughly 90% of stocks in the benchmark index lost ground, but it managed to hold onto a modest gain of 0.7% for the week. 




The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.8% to 42,992.21. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite fell 1.5%, to 19,722.03. 


The losses were made worse by sharp declines for the Big Tech stocks known as the "Magnificent 7," which can heavily influence the direction of the market because of their large size. 


A wide range of retailers also fell. Amazon fell 1.5% and Best Buy slipped 1.5%. The sector is being closely watched for clues on how it performed during the holiday shopping season. 


The S&P 500 gained nearly 3% over a 3-day stretch before breaking for the Christmas holiday. On Thursday, the index posted a small decline. 




Despite Friday's drop, the market is moving closer to another standout annual finish. The S&P 500 is on track for a gain of around 25% in 2024. That would mark a second consecutive yearly gain of more than 20%, the first time that has happened since 1997-1998. 


The gains have been driven partly by upbeat economic data showing that consumers continued spending and the labor market remained strong. Inflation, while still high, has also been steadily easing. 


A report on Friday showed that sales and inventory estimates for the wholesales trade industry fell 0.2% in November, following a slight gain in October. That weaker-than-expected report follows an update on the labor market Thursday that showed unemployment benefits held steady last week. 


The stream of upbeat economic data and easing inflation helped prompt a reversal in the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy this year. Expectations for interest rate cuts also helped drive market gains. The central bank recently delivered its third cut to interest rates in 2024. 


Even though inflation has come closer to the central bank's target of 2%, it remains stubbornly above that mark and worries about it heating up again have tempered the forecast for more interest rate cuts. 


Inflation concerns have added to uncertainties heading into 2025, which include the labor market's path ahead and shifting economic policies under incoming President Donald Trump. Worries have risen that Trump's preference for tariffs and other policies could lead to higher inflation, a bigger U.S. government debt, and difficulties for global trade. 


In other dealings early Monday, U.S. benchmark crude oil picked up 1 cent to $70.61 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, lost 1 cent to $73.78 per barrel. 


The euro fell to $1.0427 from $1.0433.

## Storm system spawns tornadoes across US, leading to 4 deaths

date: 2024-12-30, from: VOA News USA

Officials assessed the damage on Sunday after a strong storm system moved across the southern United States over the weekend, spawning tornadoes and killing at least four people. 


There were at least 45 reports of tornado damage across Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia, said Brian Hurley, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center. Crews will do damage surveys to confirm tornadoes. 


The storms during busy holiday travels caused some treacherous road conditions along with delays or cancellations at some of the busiest U.S. airports. As of Sunday afternoon, there were over 600 flight delays affecting Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in the southern state of Georgia, according to flight tracker FlightAware. 


"It's not unheard of, but it is fairly uncommon to have a severe weather outbreak of this magnitude this late in the year," said Frank Pereira, a meteorologist with the Weather Prediction Center. 


In the area of Houston, Texas, National Weather Service storm survey crews confirmed that at least five tornadoes hit north and south of the city on Saturday. 


At least one person died. The 48-year-old woman was found about 30 meters from her home in the Liverpool area south of Houston, said Madison Polston of the Brazoria County Sheriff's Office. She said the exact cause of death wasn't immediately known. 


Four other people in Brazoria County had injuries that weren't considered critical, said Polston, adding that at least 40 homes and buildings were significantly damaged. 


In Montgomery County, north of Houston, about 30 homes were destroyed and about 50 others sustained major damage, county official Jason Smith said. 


In the state of North Carolina, a 70-year-old man was killed Sunday in Statesville, just north of Charlotte, when a tree landed on the pickup truck he was driving. Highway Patrol Trooper DJ Maffucci said "it was just a freak accident" and he believed Matthew Teeple, of Cleveland, North Carolina, was killed instantly. 


"It's very sad, just terrible timing," Maffucci said, adding that the storms were responsible for a number of downed trees and "quite a few wrecks." 


Two people were killed in storms in Mississippi, officials said. An 18-year-old died after a tree fell on her home Saturday night in Natchez in Adams County, said Emergency Management spokesperson Neifa Hardy. Two other people in the home were injured. 


Another person died in Lowndes County and at least eight more were injured across the state, officials said. 


The National Weather Service said two tornadoes hit around Bude and the city of Brandon, ripping roofs from several buildings. 


Storm damage also was reported in the northern Alabama city of Athens, northwest of Huntsville. 


Holly Hollman, spokeswoman for the city, said most of the damage from the early Sunday morning storms occurred downtown. She said it hurled large HVAC units from the tops of building and ripped the roof off a bookstore. A full-sized, stripped-down military helicopter was toppled from a pole where it was on display, she added. 




"I stepped out on my porch and I could hear it roar," she said of the storm. "I think we are extremely lucky that we got hit late at night. If it had hit during the busy hours, I think we might have had some injuries and possibly some fatalities." 


As of Sunday afternoon, more than 40,000 people were still without power in Mississippi, according to electric utility tracking website PowerOutage.us. Texas, Alabama, North Carolina and Georgia each had about 10,000 customers without power, it said. 


The storms closed some roads in western North Carolina, a region broadly devastated by Hurricane Helene this fall. That included part of U.S. 441, also known as the Great Smoky Mountains Expressway, which closed north of Bryson City due to high winds. 


In Bumpus Cove, Tennessee, Justin Fromkin, president of Raising Hope Disaster Relief, worked Sunday to save what he could from the organization's supply tent — filled with clothes and food — after about 152 millimeters of rain fell. 


He's spent the past few months delivering aid to areas in western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee that are still reeling from Helene. The ground in some parts of the mountains is still unstable from Helene, Fromkin said, and Sunday's downpour adds to the problem.

## World leaders react to death of former US President Jimmy Carter

date: 2024-12-30, from: VOA News USA

World leaders and U.S. politicians reacted to news that former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who as president brokered peace between Israel and Egypt and later received the Nobel Peace Prize for his humanitarian work, has died at age 100.


US President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden


“Today, America and the world lost an extraordinary leader, statesman and humanitarian.



Over six decades, we had the honor of calling Jimmy Carter a dear friend. But what’s extraordinary about Jimmy Carter, though, is that millions of people throughout America and the world who never met him thought of him as a dear friend as well."


US Vice President Kamala Harris


“Throughout his life, President Carter was strengthened by the love and support of his partner of 77 years, First Lady Rosalynn Carter, whose life President Biden and I had the opportunity to celebrate in Georgia last year. After leaving office, President Carter continued his fight for peace, democracy, and human dignity through the Carter Center.


I had the privilege of knowing President Carter for years. I will always remember his kindness, wisdom, and profound grace. His life and legacy continue to inspire me — and will inspire generations to come. Our world is a better place because of President Carter.”


US President-elect Donald Trump


"The challenges Jimmy faced as president came at a pivotal time for our country and he did everything in his power to improve the lives of all Americans. For that, we all owe him a debt of gratitude.


Melania and I are thinking warmly of the Carter Family and their loved ones during this difficult time. We urge everyone to keep them in their hearts and prayers."


US Vice President-elect JD Vance


"Jimmy Carter dedicated his life to serving this country. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his loved ones. May he Rest in Peace."


Former US President Barack Obama


“Elected in the shadow of Watergate, Jimmy Carter promised voters that he would always tell the truth. And he did — advocating for the public good, consequences be damned. He believed some things were more important than reelection — things like integrity, respect, and compassion. Because Jimmy Carter believed, as deeply as he believed anything, that we are all created in God’s image. ...


Maranatha Baptist Church will be a little quieter on Sundays, but President Carter will never be far away — buried alongside Rosalynn next to a willow tree down the road, his memory calling all of us to heed our better angels. Michelle and I send our thoughts and prayers to the Carter family, and everyone who loved and learned from this remarkable man.”


Former US President George W. Bush


"Laura and I send our heartfelt condolences to Jack, Chip, Jeff, Amy, and the entire Carter family.


James Earl Carter, Jr., was a man of deeply held convictions. He was loyal to his family, his community, and his country. President Carter dignified the office. And his efforts to leave behind a better world didn’t end with the presidency. His work with Habitat for Humanity and the Carter Center set an example of service that will inspire Americans for generations."


Former US President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton


"From his commitment to civil rights as a state senator and governor of Georgia; to his efforts as President to protect our natural resources in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, make energy conservation a national priority, return the Panama Canal to Panama, and secure peace between Egypt and Israel at Camp David; to his post-Presidential efforts at the Carter Center supporting honest elections, advancing peace, combating disease, and promoting democracy; to his and Rosalynn’s devotion and hard work at Habitat for Humanity — he worked tirelessly for a better, fairer world."


Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi 


"In this moment of sorrow, I extend my heartfelt condolences to the family of former American President Jimmy Carter, as well as to the President and the people of the United States of America. 


His significant role in achieving the peace agreement between Egypt and Israel will remain etched in the annals of history, and his humanitarian work exemplifies a lofty standard of love, peace, and brotherhood. His enduring legacy ensures that he will be remembered as one of the world's most prominent leaders in service to humanity."   


US Secretary of State Antony Blinken 


"Throughout decades of public service, President Carter embodied integrity, compassion, and a commitment to advancing the freedom, security, and welfare of others. 


He channeled that spirit in his foreign policy, from negotiating the return of the Panama Canal to its host nation, to developing arms control agreements with the Soviet Union. And he brought it to his every exchange and conversation, from heads of state to ordinary citizens. 


President Carter also showed us what can be achieved through tireless and principled diplomacy, mediating a landmark deal with Israel and Egypt that helped forge peace between two nations that had spent decades at war. His efforts are an important reminder of what’s possible, especially amidst renewed conflict and suffering in the region." 


Britain's King Charles 


"It was with great sadness that I learned of the death of former President Carter. He was a committed public servant and devoted his life to promoting peace and human rights. 


His dedication and humility served as an inspiration to many, and I remember with great fondness his visit to the United Kingdom in 1977. 


My thoughts and prayers are with President Carter's family and the American people at this time."   


Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau 


"Jimmy Carter’s legacy is one of compassion, kindness, empathy, and hard work. He served others both at home and around the world his entire life — and he loved doing it. He was always thoughtful and generous with his advice to me. My deepest condolences to the Carter family, his many loved ones, and the American people who are mourning a former President and a lifelong humanitarian. May his selfless service continue to inspire us all for years to come." 


Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino 


"I offer my condolences to the family and to the people and Government of the United States on the death of former President Jimmy Carter. His stint in the White House was marked by difficult times, and were crucial for Panama in negotiating and signing the Torrijos-Carter Treaties in 1977, which transferred the (Panama) Canal into Panamanian hands and made our country truly sovereign. May his soul rest in peace.”   


Venezuelan Government of President Nicolas Maduro 


"The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela regrets the death of former President of the United States of America, Jimmy Carter, and extends its most sincere condolences to his family and friends. 


Former President Carter was a man of proven commitment to peace and dialog. His contributions to global politics and his dedication to peace have left an indelible mark on the world." 


French President Emmanuel Macron


"Throughout his life, Jimmy Carter has been a steadfast advocate for the rights of the most vulnerable and has tirelessly fought for peace. France sends its heartfelt thoughts to his family and to the American people."


Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese 


"President Carter rose from humble beginnings to leave a remarkable legacy. Beyond being elected to the Presidency or being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, Jimmy Carter's legacy is best measured in lives changed, saved and uplifted.” 


Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy 


“We express our heartfelt condolences to the American people and to the family of former U.S. President Jimmy Carter on his passing. He was a leader who served during a time when Ukraine was not yet independent, yet his heart stood firmly with us in our ongoing fight for freedom. 


He devoted his life to promoting peace in the world and defending human rights. Today, let us remember: peace matters, and the world must remain united in standing against those who threaten these values." 


Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel 


"Condolences to the people and the government of the U.S., and especially the family of President James Carter. Our people remember with gratitude his efforts to better relations, his visits to #Cuba and his speaking out in favor of the release of the Five." 


US Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer


"Today, we mourn the loss of one of our most humble and devoted public servants, President Jimmy Carter.


President Carter personified the true meaning of leadership through service, through compassion, and through integrity.


From his legacy as president, to his dedication to improving human rights across the globe, and his tireless efforts alongside his wife Rosalynn, in building a better world through Habitat for Humanity, he inspired millions with his unwavering commitment to justice and equality."


British Prime Minister Keir Starmer


"I was very sorry to hear of President Carter's passing and I would like to pay tribute to his decades of selfless public service.


His presidency will be remembered for the historic Camp David Accords between Israel and Egypt, and it was that lifelong dedication to peace that saw him receive the Nobel Peace prize.


Motivated by his strong faith and values, President Carter redefined the post-presidency with a remarkable commitment to social justice and human rights at home and abroad."


US Senator Mitch McConnell


“Elaine and I join the Senate and the nation in mourning the passing of our 39th president, Jimmy Carter.


“President Carter served during times of tension and uncertainty, both at home and abroad. But his calm spirit and deep faith seemed unshakeable. Jimmy Carter served as our commander-in-chief for four years, but he served as the beloved, unassuming Sunday school teacher at Maranatha Baptist Church in Plains, Georgia for forty. And his humble devotion leaves us little doubt which of those two important roles he prized the most."


US House Speaker Mike Johnson


“Today, the thoughts of Americans and the prayers of Congress are lifted up on behalf of the Carter family. President Carter’s story was one of humble beginnings, and his life is a testament to the boundless opportunities available in this great nation. Because of his work in brokering the Camp David Accords and his advocacy with Habitat for Humanity, the world is a more peaceful place, and more Americans have a place to call home. No one can deny that President Carter led an extraordinary life of service to his country. May he rest in peace.”


US Representative Mike Turner


“I am deeply saddened to learn about the death of President Jimmy Carter. President Carter was a man of integrity who was guided by his faith. I join all Americans in saluting President Carter for his lifetime of service, first as a naval officer, then as a senator in the Georgia State Senate, then as Governor of Georgia, and, finally, as President of the United States. I would like to extend my heartfelt condolences to the Carter family.”


US Senator Mark Warner


"President Carter will be remembered by what he built and left behind for us – a model of service late into life, a tireless devotion to family and philanthropy, and a more peaceful world to call home."


US Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin


“Jimmy Carter proved that excellence in public service can extend beyond the White House. His life was an inspiration to those of us who aspire to lead a life of service."

## Key moments in the life of Jimmy Carter

date: 2024-12-29, from: VOA News USA

Jimmy Carter's 1977-1981 presidency included successes like the Camp David peace accords, but also enough controversy for U.S. voters to see him as weak — and send him packing after only one term.


Carter's legacy, however, was largely built on his post-presidency, the longest in U.S. history.


Here are a few key moments in the life of Carter, who died Sunday at the age of 100.


The Panama Canal


During his first year in office, Carter went back on a campaign promise and decided to hand back management of the Panama Canal — which had been in U.S. military control since its construction at the start of the 20th century.


"Fairness, and not force, should lie at the heart of our dealings with the nations of the world," he said at the signing of the canal treaties with Panamanian leader Omar Torrijos on September 7, 1977.


Carter was ridiculed for the move, which gave Panama control over the canal linking the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans at the end of 1999.


History, however, has looked upon the deal as a deft bit of diplomacy.  


Giving Panama a meatier role in the canal's management in the run-up to the transfer allowed for stability and broke with America's image as an overbearing imperialist power in Latin America.


Morality in politics


Upon his arrival in the Oval Office, Carter looked to distance himself from the realpolitik practiced by his predecessors — a vestige of the Cold War — and placed human rights at the heart of his agenda.


"Our principal goal is to help shape a world which is more responsive to the desire of people everywhere for economic well-being, social justice, political self-determination and basic human rights," he said in a 1978 speech at the U.S. Naval Academy.


In concrete terms, Carter notably signed the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 1977. It was eventually ratified by the United States in 1992 after being blocked for years by the Senate.


Camp David Accords  


In September 1978, Carter invited Israeli Premier Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat to Camp David, the presidential retreat outside Washington.


After 13 days of secret negotiations under Carter's mediation, two accords were signed that ultimately led to a peace treaty the following year.  


The diplomatic triumph was cited when Carter was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.


Crisis of confidence


In the summer of 1979, the economy rocked by inflation and his approval rating in free fall, Carter addressed the American people in a nationwide televised speech on July 15.


In that half-hour, he responded to his critics on his lack of leadership, instead laying the blame on a national "crisis of confidence."


"The erosion of our confidence in the future is threatening to destroy the social and the political fabric of America," he said.


The speech was poorly received and would come back to haunt him. Five cabinet members resigned that week.


Iran hostage crisis


The hostage crisis — more than 50 Americans were held for 444 days at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran from November 1979 to January 1981 — was the death knell for Carter's presidency.


A failed military rescue mission in April 1980 all but extinguished his chances of reelection later that year.


Operation Eagle Claw was thwarted by sandstorms and mechanical problems — eventually, the mission was aborted. In the subsequent withdrawal, two American aircraft collided, killing eight servicemen.


In the following days, then secretary of state Cyrus Vance resigned, and the mission's failure symbolized Carter's inability to resolve the crisis.


The hostages were eventually freed on the same day that Republican Ronald Reagan took office, after thumping Carter at the polls in November 1980.


The Carter Center


Carter remained extremely active into his 90s despite his retirement from political life.


In 1982, he founded the Carter Center, which has focused on conflict resolution, promoting democracy and human rights, and fighting disease.


Carter — often viewed as America's most successful former president — traveled extensively, supervising elections from Haiti to East Timor, and tackling thorny global problems as a mediator.


The Elders


Carter was also a member of The Elders, a group of former world leaders founded by Nelson Mandela in 2007 to promote peace and human rights.


Fellow Nobel peace laureates South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu (who died in 2021), former Liberian President Ellen Sirleaf Johnson and the late U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan also belonged to the group.

## Former US President Jimmy Carter dies at 100

date: 2024-12-29, from: VOA News USA

Atlanta, Georgia  — VOA Correspondent Kane Farabaugh conducted numerous interviews with Jimmy Carter on issues ranging from his time in the White House to his post-presidential career as a promoter of global health and democracy. Highlights of those interviews are contained in this report.


Former President Jimmy Carter, a peanut farmer and Georgia state governor before becoming president, has died at the age of 100.


When Carter took the oath of office as president of the United States on January 20, 1977, he promised a "government as good as its people."


He presided over four turbulent years. Rising inflation and growing unemployment marred the domestic priorities of his administration. He scored victories in foreign policy with a peace agreement between Egypt and Israel and the Panama Canal treaty. However, a hostage crisis in Iran dominated his final years in the White House and contributed to his defeat in the 1980 general election.


But Carter liked to say the end of his presidency in 1981 was the beginning of a new life, traveling the world "fighting disease, building hope, and waging peace."




"It has turned out to open up for me and my wife, Rosalynn, a new arena of excitement and unpredictability and adventure and challenge and gratification," he told VOA.


As the head of the Carter Center, the Carters traveled to more than 80 countries monitoring troubled elections, mediating disputes, and fighting diseases. This active post-White House life eventually led to the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002.


"I look upon the Carter Center work as an extension of what I tried to do as president. You know, we brought peace between Israel and Egypt. We opened up a humongous relationship with Latin America with the Panama Canal treaty," he said. "So what I have done since then has been kind of an extension. But I do not think there is any doubt that when I won the Nobel Peace Prize, for instance, it was because of the work of the Carter Center. So, I would be perfectly satisfied to have a legacy based on peace and human rights. I mean, who would not?"


United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres praised Carter’s “commitment to international peace and human rights.


“President Carter will be remembered for his solidarity with the vulnerable, his abiding grace, and his unrelenting faith in the common good and our common humanity,” Guterres said in a statement. “His legacy as a peacemaker, human rights champion and humanitarian will endure.”


The White House released a statement from President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden on Sunday: “Over six decades, we had the honor of calling Jimmy Carter a dear friend. But, what’s extraordinary about Jimmy Carter, though, is that millions of people throughout America and the world who never met him thought of him as a dear friend as well.”


Biden also declared January 9, 2025, as a National Day of Mourning in honor of Carter and directed flags at public buildings to be displayed at half-staff for 30 days.


President-elect Donald Trump posted on Truth Social: “The challenges Jimmy faced as President came at a pivotal time for our country and he did everything in his power to improve the lives of all Americans. For that, we all owe him a debt of gratitude.”




Carter's journey to the White House began in the small town of Plains, Georgia, where he was born October 1, 1924.


After serving as an officer in the U.S. Navy, where he helped develop the post-World War II nuclear submarine fleet, Carter returned to his hometown in 1953 to run the family peanut-farming business.


He entered politics in the 1960s, serving two terms as a Georgia legislator before becoming the state's 76th governor from 1971 to 1975.


In the 1976 presidential election, Carter, a Democrat, ran against Republican incumbent Gerald Ford, who assumed the presidency after Richard Nixon resigned in the wake of the Watergate scandal. Carter narrowly defeated Ford to become president.


The high point of Carter's presidency came in 1978. Carter brought Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin to the Camp David presidential retreat in rural Maryland to negotiate a peace treaty.


"When I became president, there had been four wars between Arabs and Israelis in the previous 25 years, with the Egyptians in the leadership supported by the Soviet Union," he said. "They were the only country that could really challenge Israel militarily. And we had success in getting a treaty between Israel and Egypt … not a word of which has ever been violated."


Carter also negotiated a treaty turning control of the Panama Canal over to the Panamanian government and normalized diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China.




But in 1979 the primary focus for Carter's administration turned to Iran, where a revolution led by religious clerics toppled the government of the U.S. backed shah, who eventually fled to the United States, where he received treatment for cancer.


On November 4, 1979, militants angry with the U.S. for harboring the deposed shah stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, taking 66 Americans hostage. Thirteen were released weeks later but what was referred to by the U.S. as the hostage crisis extended through the rest of Carter's presidency.


Five months into the crisis, in April 1980, Carter authorized a complex military operation to free the remaining hostages. Dubbed Operation Eagle Claw, the plan called for several helicopters and military aircraft to stage at a site in the Iranian desert. Carter, who approved the plan, explained to VOA that the helicopters carrying members of the U.S. military's elite Delta Force, were to fly from there to the U.S. embassy in Tehran, free the hostages and return to the waiting aircraft that would fly them out of Iran.


"The minimum number of helicopters required would be six very large helicopters. So I decided to send eight. One of the helicopters, in an inexplicable way, turned around and went back to the aircraft carrier. Another one went down in a sandstorm in the Iranian desert. The third one developed a hydraulic leak and ran into one of the C-130 airplanes," he said.




The aborted mission ended in failure. Eight U.S. military members and one Iranian civilian died as a result of the crash. Walter Mondale, Carter’s vice president, told VOA that day was the lowest point of their administration.


"When that rescue mission failed and lives were lost. I mean, that was just ... we were just morose that day and for some time after that," Mondale said. Secretary of State Cyrus Vance resigned in protest of the operation.


The failure of the mission damaged Carter's credibility with the American public. The incident occurred seven months before the 1980 presidential election and contributed to Carter's defeat to challenger Ronald Reagan.


"The exact anniversary of the hostages being taken was Election Day," Carter said. "Of course, the news media were completely obsessed with the anniversary of the hostages being taken and the fact that I had not been able to get them out. That was the number one issue that caused me to fail."




The hostages were freed the day Reagan became president.


In 1981, Carter returned to Plains, unsure about the direction of his post-presidential life. His plans for a library and museum were initially modest.


"I envisioned it to be a tiny thing, where I would have an office and some nice buildings in Atlanta. And that anyone in the world that had an ongoing conflict or potential conflict could come to me and I would help them mediate the dispute and stop a war," he said.


The Carter Center, under his direction, monitored more then 80 troubled elections and mediated disputes ranging from a nuclear standoff with North Korea in 1994, to a peace agreement between Uganda and Sudan in 1999. The center is also a leader in promoting health and fighting disease in the poorest parts of the planet.


In one of many interviews with Voice of America, Carter reflected on his life in and out of the White House. He said the greatest part of his legacy wasn't his accomplishments as president or the Nobel Peace Prize, but the eradication of Guinea worm disease.


"There's only been one disease in the history of humankind, ever eradicated, and that was smallpox,” he said, “So Guinea worm is going to soon be the second disease in history, to be wiped off the face of the earth."


Thanks to Carter’s efforts, there were only 13 cases of Guinea worm recorded in 2022.


Carter led an active life until the age of 99, surviving brain cancer in 2015.


Declining health and the 2020 global coronavirus pandemic kept him confined to his hometown of Plains in his final years.


Jimmy Carter last appeared in public during funeral services for his wife, Rosalynn, in November 2023.




In one of his last public media appearances, Carter shared with VOA his hopes for the Carter Center’s future.


“I would like to see the United States in the future strive to be the number one champion in the world of peace and human rights and environmental quality, and I would say treating everyone equal,” he said. “If we could do that, we would have a real superpower in the country I love very much.”


Jimmy Carter lived the longest of any occupant of the White House, and his 76-year marriage to wife Rosalynn is the longest of any president and first lady.


Though his final resting place will be on the grounds of his home in Plains, Georgia, the work and the words of Carter live on in the pages of the dozens of books he authored throughout his life. It includes his memoirs, a fiction novel, controversial examinations of the Middle East, and a collection of his favorite poems.

## 'Sonic 3' and 'Mufasa' battle for No. 1 at holiday box office

date: 2024-12-29, from: VOA News USA

Two family films dominated the holiday box office this week, with “Sonic the Hedgehog 3” winning the three-day weekend over “Mufasa” by a blue hair.


Paramount's Sonic movie earned $38 million, while “Mufasa” brought in $37.1 million from theaters in the U.S. and Canada, according to studio estimates Sunday. On a normal weekend counting Friday, Saturday and Sunday ticket purchases, the winner would be somewhat clear. But when the Christmas holiday falls on a Wednesday as it did this year, the studios look at two sets of numbers: The five-day earnings and the three-day weekend earnings. With the five-day tally, The Walt Disney Co.'s “Mufasa” had the edge, bringing in $63.8 million.


It all adds up to a rather robust theatrical landscape, helped by the continued success of “Wicked” and “Moana 2,” which are on their sixth and fifth weekends, respectively.


The vampire horror “Nosferatu” also debuted triumphantly. Robert Eggers’ modern reimagining of a 1922 silent film starring Nicholas Hoult and Lily-Rose Depp rose to the top of a starry batch of Christmas Day newcomers, which included the Bob Dylan biopic “A Complete Unknown,” with Timothée Chalamet; the erotic drama “Babygirl” with Nicole Kidman; and “The Fire Inside,” about boxer Claressa Shields.


“Nosferatu” landed in third place with $21.2 million from the weekend and $40.3 million from its first five days. Not accounting for inflation, it had the best Christmas Day opening ever for a genre film, with $11.6 million (besting “The Faculty's” $4.4 million in 1998). Focus Features released the R-rated film in 2,992 theaters. 


It was a gamble to open “Nosferatu” on Christmas, when family films or all-ages blockbusters tend to be prioritized. But it paid off, attracting the coveted 18 to 34-year-old demographic to theaters.


“It was a risky move, but we knew that we had such a great film,” said Lisa Bunnell, who leads distribution for Focus Features. “A lot of people thought we were insane. But I think the more that people thought we were crazy, the more we all felt like it was the right thing to do.”


The response to the unconventional counterprogramming was gratifying. The sarcophagus-inspired popcorn buckets are even reselling for over $100.


“People keep talking about ‘how do we get people back into the movies?’ I think the only way you can get people to go back is to shake it up,” Bunnell said. “You don’t just spoon feed them the same things over and over again.”


The Bob Dylan movie, directed by James Mangold, also got off to a bright start with $11.6 million over the weekend and $23.2 million since Christmas. The 5-day total is a record for Searchlight Pictures since Disney acquired the company in early 2019. It's been well received by both critics (96% on Rotten Tomatoes) and audiences (A on CinemaScore) and will likely get more of a boost from the awards race.


“Babygirl,” an A24 release from filmmaker Halina Reijn, played on 2115 screens, earning $4.4 million over the weekend and $7.2 million since Christmas. The film stars Kidman as a married, buttoned-up CEO who begins an affair with a young intern at the company, played by Harris Dickinson. Kidman won the best acting prize for her performance at the Venice Film Festival.


“The Fire Inside,” from Amazon MGM Studios, meanwhile got a bit lost in the mix despite strong reviews. It has earned a total of $4.3 million, with $2 million coming from weekend shows where it played in 2006 theaters.


Thanksgiving releases continued to perform well through the Christmas timeframe. Fourth place went to “Wicked,” which earned another $19.5 million, bringing its domestic total to $424.2 million. On Tuesday, the lavish movie musical will also be available to rent or purchase at home. It’s a move that has drawn some critics who believe making it available at home after only 40 days in theaters will cannibalize profits.


“Moana 2” rounded out the top five films this weekend with $18.2 million. The Disney movie has made $882.5 million globally and is closing in on $400 million domestically.

Christmas Day itself was massive for the industry, with $61 million in ticket sales. Thursday was nearly as big, with $50 million.


“Every day was like Saturday at the box office because of the way the holidays lined up," said Paul Dergarabedian, Comscore's senior media analyst.


Comscore is projecting that the year will net out with about $8.75 billion in domestic box office receipts. That's down about 3.3% from last year, which cracked $9 billion, and the pre-pandemic normal of $11 billion.


Final domestic figures will be released Monday. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore, are:


1. “Sonic the Hedgehog 3,” $38 million.

2. “Mufasa: The Lion King,” $37.1 million.

3. “Nosferatu,” $21.2 million.

4. “Wicked,” $19.5 million.

5. “Moana 2,” $18.2 million.

6. “A Complete Unknown,” $11.6 million.

7. “Babygirl,” $4.4 million.

8. “Gladiator II,” $4.2 million.

9. “Homestead,” $3.2 million.

10. “The Fire Inside,” $2 million.

## Will New Year's Eve be loud or quiet? What are the top 2025 resolutions?

date: 2024-12-29, from: VOA News USA

New york — If you're planning on ringing in the new year quietly at home, you're not alone.


A majority of U.S adults intend to celebrate New Year’s Eve at home, according to a new poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.


“As I’ve gotten older over the last few years, it’s like if I don’t make it to midnight, it’s not a big deal, you know?” says Carla Woods, 70, from Vinton, Iowa.


Nearly 2 in 10 will be celebrating at a friend or family member’s home, and just 5% plan to go out to celebrate at a bar, restaurant or organized event, the poll found.


But many U.S. adults will celebrate the new year in a different way — by making a resolution. More than half say they'll make at least one resolution for 2025.


There's some optimism about the year ahead, although more than half aren't expecting a positive change. About 4 in 10 say 2025 will be a better year for them personally. About one-third don’t expect much of a difference between 2024 and 2025, and about one-quarter think 2025 will be a worse year than 2024.


Relaxed New Year's Eve plans for many


Kourtney Kershaw, a 32-year-old bartender in Chicago, often fields questions from customers and friends about upcoming events for New Year's Eve. She said this year is trending toward low-key.


“A majority of who I’ve spoken to in my age range, they want to go out, but they don’t know what they’re going to do because they haven’t found anything or things are just really expensive,” she said. “Party packages or an entry fee are like a turnoff, especially with the climate of the world and how much things cost.”


As expected, younger people are more interested in ringing in the new year at a bar or organized event — about 1 in 10 U.S. adults under 30 say they plan to do that. But about 3 in 10 older adults — 60 and above — say they won’t celebrate the beginning of 2025 at all.


Anthony Tremblay, 35, from Pittsburgh, doesn't usually go out to toast the arrival of the new year, but this year he's got something special cooked up: He and his wife will be traveling through Ireland.


“I don’t do anything too crazy for New Year’s, usually. So this is definitely a change,” he said. “I wanted to do something unique this year, so I did.”


Woods will be working New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day. She answers calls on The Iowa Warmline, a confidential, noncrisis listening line for people struggling with mental health or substance use issues.


“Holidays are really hard for people, so I don’t mind working,” she said. “I’m passionate about it because I have mental health issues in the family and so being able to help people is rewarding to me.”


Younger Americans are more likely to make a resolution


Every New Year's also triggers the eternal debate about resolutions. A majority of U.S. adults say they intend to make a New Year’s resolution of some type, but millennials and Gen Z are especially likely to be on board — about two-thirds expect to do so, compared to about half of older adults. Women are also more likely than men to say they will set a goal for 2025.


Tremblay hopes to lose some weight and focus more on self-care — more sleep, meditation and breathing exercises. “It’s probably a good year to focus on mental health,” he said.


Many others agree. About 3 in 10 adults choose resolutions involving exercise or eating healthier. About one-quarter said they'll make a resolution involving losing weight and a similar number said they'll resolve to make changes about priorities of money or mental health.


Woods' resolutions are to stay social and active. As a mental health counselor, she knows those are key to a happy 2025 and beyond: “Probably one of my biggest resolutions is trying to make sure I stay social, try to get out at least once a week — get out and either have coffee or do something with a friend. That’s not only for the physical but also for the mental health part.”


Kershaw, the bartender, says weight loss and better health are the top resolutions she hears people make. “Mental health is the new one, but I think it’s high up there as well as with regular health,” she said.


She prefers more goal-oriented resolutions and, this time, it's to do more traveling and see more of the world: “I don’t know if that’s really a resolution, but that’s a goal that I’m setting.”


And how will she welcome the arrival of 2025? Usually, she takes the night off and stays home watching movies with plenty of snacks, but this year Kershaw has a different plan, maybe one of the most Chicago things you can do.


This die-hard sports fan will be at Wrigley Field on Tuesday watching the Chicago Blackhawks take on the St. Louis Blues. “Hockey’s my favorite sport. So I will be watching hockey and bringing in the new year,” she said.

## Tornadoes in Texas, Mississippi kill 2 and injure 6 as severe weather system moves east

date: 2024-12-29, from: VOA News USA

Houston, Texas — A strong storm system threatened to whip up tornadoes in parts of the U.S. Southeast on Sunday, a day after severe weather claimed at least two lives as twisters touched down in Texas and Mississippi. 


The National Weather Service's severe storm tracker indicated the system was moving east through Alabama into Georgia shortly before 4 a.m. The agency issued severe thunder storm warnings with the possibility of tornadoes in western Georgia, the northwestern tip of Florida and elsewhere. 


On Saturday, one person died in the Liverpool area, located south of Houston, Texas. Four people suffered injuries that were not considered critical, according to Madison Polston of the Brazoria County Sheriff's Office. 


There were "multiple touchdown points" in the county between Liverpool, Hillcrest Village and Alvin. Officials knew of around 10 damaged homes but were working to determine the extent of the damage, Polston said. 


In Mississippi, one person died in Adams County and two people were injured in Franklin County, according to the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency. 


The National Weather Service said two tornadoes hit around Bude and the city of Brandon, ripping roofs from several buildings. 


It appeared at least six tornadoes touched down in the Houston area, though more may be discovered when crews go out to survey the damage. There was damage in the area from both tornadoes and straight-line winds, according to Josh Lichter, meteorologist with the National Weather Service. 


North of Houston, mobile homes were damaged or destroyed in Katy and Porter Heights, where the doors of a fire station were blown in, the weather service said. 


Storm damage has been reported in the northern Alabama town of Athens, just northwest of Huntsville. A National Weather Service survey team was expected to begin assessing damage Sunday morning, said meteorologist Chelly Amin. 


Also Sunday, the National Weather Service issued severe thunderstorm warnings across portions of the Deep South as the line of storms barreled east through Alabama, Georgia and into South Carolina. Wind gusts of 60 mph (97 kph) were expected in the Spartanburg, South Carolina, area. Damage to trees and powerlines was expected in a number of counties, while a tornada watch was in effect for some parts of the state. 


At 9 a.m. Sunday ET, nearly 65,000 customers were without power in Mississippi, down from 93,000 around 1 a.m., according to electric utility tracking website PowerOutage.us. Some 54,000 customers were without power in Georgia; 36,000, Alabama; 20,000, Louisiana; and 13,000, Texas.

## North Korea's Kim vows toughest anti-US policy before Trump takes office

date: 2024-12-29, from: VOA News USA

SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said he will implement the "toughest" anti-U.S. policy, less than a month before Donald Trump takes office as U.S. president, the country's state media reported Sunday.


Trump's return to the White House raises prospects for high-profile diplomacy with North Korea. During his first term, Trump met Kim three times for talks on the North's nuclear program. Many experts however say a quick resumption of Kim-Trump summitry is unlikely as Trump would first focus on conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. North Korea's support for Russia's war against Ukraine also poses a challenge to efforts to revive diplomacy, experts say.


During a five-day plenary meeting of the ruling Workers' Party that ended Friday, Kim called the U.S. "the most reactionary state that regards anti-communism as its invariable state policy." Kim said that the U.S.-South Korea-Japan security partnership is expanding into "a nuclear military bloc for aggression."


"This reality clearly shows to which direction we should advance and what we should do and how," Kim said, according to the official Korean Central News Agency.


It said Kim's speech "clarified the strategy for the toughest anti-U.S. counteraction to be launched aggressively" by North Korea for its long-term national interests and security.


KCNA didn't elaborate on the anti-U.S. strategy. But it said Kim set forth tasks to bolster military capability through defense technology advancements and stressed the need to improve the mental toughness of North Korean soldiers.


The previous meetings between Trump and Kim had not only put an end to their exchanges of fiery rhetoric and threats of destruction, but they developed personal connections. Trump once famously said he and Kim "fell in love." But their talks eventually collapsed in 2019, as they wrangled over U.S.-led sanctions on the North.


North Korea has since sharply increased the pace of its weapons testing activities to build more reliable nuclear missiles targeting the U.S. and its allies. The U.S. and South Korea have responded by expanding their military bilateral drills and also trilateral ones involving Japan, drawing strong rebukes from the North, which views such U.S.-led exercises as invasion rehearsals.


Further complicating efforts to get North Korea to rid itself of nuclear weapons is its deepening military cooperation with Russia.


According to U.S., Ukrainian and South Korean assessments, North Korea has sent more than 10,000 troops and conventional weapons systems to support Moscow's war against Ukraine. There are concerns that Russia could give North Korea advanced weapons technology in return, including help to build more powerful nuclear missiles.


Russia and China, locked in separate disputes with the U.S., have repeatedly blocked U.S.-led pushes to levy more U.N. sanctions on North Korea despite its repeated missile tests in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions.


Last month, Kim said that his past negotiations with the United States only confirmed Washington's "unchangeable" hostility toward his country and described his nuclear buildup as the only way to counter external threats.

## AI technology helps level playing field for students with disabilities

date: 2024-12-29, from: VOA News USA

For Makenzie Gilkison, spelling is such a struggle that a word like rhinoceros might come out as "rineanswsaurs" or sarcastic as "srkastik." 


The 14-year-old from suburban Indianapolis can sound out words, but her dyslexia makes the process so draining that she often struggles with comprehension.


"I just assumed I was stupid," she recalled of her early grade school years. 


But assistive technology powered by artificial intelligence has helped her keep up with classmates. Last year, Makenzie was named to the National Junior Honor Society. She credits a customized AI-powered chatbot, a word prediction program and other tools that can read for her. 


"I would have just probably given up if I didn't have them," she said. 


New tech; countless possibilities


Artificial intelligence holds the promise of helping countless  students with a range of visual, speech, language and hearing impairments to execute tasks that come easily to others. Schools everywhere have been wrestling with how and where to incorporate AI, but many are fast-tracking applications for students with disabilities. 


Getting the latest technology into the hands of students with disabilities is a priority for the U.S. Education Department, which has told schools they must consider whether students need tools like text-to-speech and alternative communication devices. New rules from the Department of Justice also will require schools and other government entities to make apps and online content accessible to those with disabilities. 


There is concern about how to ensure students using it — including those with disabilities — are still learning. 


Students can use artificial intelligence to summarize jumbled thoughts into an outline, summarize complicated passages, or even translate Shakespeare into common English. And computer-generated voices that can read passages for visually impaired and dyslexic students are becoming less robotic and more natural. 


"I'm seeing that a lot of students are kind of exploring on their own, almost feeling like they've found a cheat code in a video game," said Alexis Reid, an educational therapist in the Boston area who works with students with learning disabilities. But in her view, it is far from cheating: "We're meeting students where they are." 


Programs fortify classroom lessons 


Ben Snyder, a 14-year-old freshman from Larchmont, New York, who was recently diagnosed with a learning disability, has been increasingly using AI to help with homework. 


"Sometimes in math, my teachers will explain a problem to me, but it just makes absolutely no sense," he said. "So if I plug that problem into AI, it'll give me multiple different ways of explaining how to do that." 


He likes a program called Question AI. Earlier in the day, he asked the program to help him write an outline for a book report — a task he completed in 15 minutes that otherwise would have taken him an hour and a half because of his struggles with writing and organization. But he does think using AI to write the whole report crosses a line. 


"That's just cheating," Ben said. 


Schools weigh pros, cons 


Schools have been trying to balance the technology's benefits against the risk that it will do too much. If a special education plan sets reading growth as a goal, the student needs to improve that skill. AI can't do it for them, said Mary Lawson, general counsel at the Council of the Great City Schools. 


But the technology can help level the playing field for students with disabilities, said Paul Sanft, director of a Minnesota-based center where families can try out different assistive technology tools and borrow devices. 


"There are definitely going to be people who use some of these tools in nefarious ways. That's always going to happen," Sanft said. "But I don't think that's the biggest concern with people with disabilities, who are just trying to do something that they couldn't do before." 


Another risk is that AI will track students into less rigorous courses of study. And, because it is so good at identifying patterns, AI might be able to figure out a student has a disability. Having that disclosed by AI and not the student or their family could create ethical dilemmas, said Luis Perez, the disability and digital inclusion lead at CAST, formerly the Center for Applied Specialized Technology. 


Schools are using the technology to help students who struggle academically, even if they do not qualify for special education services. In Iowa, a new law requires students deemed not proficient — about a quarter of them — to get an individualized reading plan. As part of that effort, the state's education department spent $3 million on an AI-driven personalized tutoring program. When students struggle, a digital avatar intervenes. 


Educators anticipate more tools 


The U.S. National Science Foundation is funding AI research and development. One firm is developing tools to help children with speech and language difficulties. Called the National AI Institute for Exceptional Education, it is headquartered at the University of Buffalo, which did pioneering work on handwriting recognition that helped the U.S. Postal Service save hundreds of millions of dollars by automating processing. 


"We are able to solve the postal application with very high accuracy. When it comes to children's handwriting, we fail very badly," said Venu Govindaraju, the director of the institute. He sees it as an area that needs more work, along with speech-to-text technology, which isn't as good at understanding children's voices, particularly if there is a speech impediment. 


Sorting through the sheer number of programs developed by education technology companies can be a time-consuming challenge for schools. Richard Culatta, CEO of the International Society for Technology in Education, said the nonprofit launched an effort this fall to make it easier for districts to vet what they are buying and ensure it is accessible. 


Mother sees potential


Makenzie wishes some of the tools were easier to use. Sometimes a feature will inexplicably be turned off, and she will be without it for a week while the tech team investigates. The challenges can be so cumbersome that some students resist the technology entirely. 


But Makenzie's mother, Nadine Gilkison, who works as a technology integration supervisor at Franklin Township Community School Corporation in Indiana, said she sees more promise than downside. 


In September, her district rolled out chatbots to help special education students in high school. She said teachers, who sometimes struggled to provide students the help they needed, became emotional when they heard about the program. Until now, students were reliant on someone to help them, unable to move ahead on their own. 


"Now we don't need to wait anymore," she said.

## What is the Native American Church and why is peyote sacred to members?

date: 2024-12-29, from: VOA News USA

The Native American Church is considered the most widespread religious movement among the Indigenous people of North America. It holds sacred the peyote cactus, which grows naturally only in some parts of southern Texas and northern Mexico. Peyote has been used spiritually in ceremonies, and as a medicine by Native American people for millennia.


It contains several psychoactive compounds, primarily mescaline, which is a hallucinogen. Different tribes of peyote people have their own name for the cactus. While it is still a controlled substance, U.S. laws passed in 1978 and 1994 allow Native Americans to use, harvest and transport peyote. However, these laws only allow federally recognized Native American tribes to use the substance and don't apply to the broader group of Indigenous people in the United States.




The Native American Church developed into a distinct way of life around 1885 among the Kiowa and Comanche of Oklahoma. After 1891, it began to spread as far north as Canada. Now, more than 50 tribes and 400,000 people practice it. In general, the peyotist doctrine espouses belief in one supreme God who deals with humans through various spirits that then carry prayers to God. In many tribes, the peyote plant itself is a deity, personified as Peyote Spirit.


Why was the Native American Church incorporated? 


The Native American Church is not one unified entity like, say, the Catholic Church. It contains a diversity of tribes, beliefs and practices. Peyote is what unifies them. After peyote was banned by U.S. government agents in 1888 and later by 15 states, Native American tribes began incorporating as individual Native American Churches in 1918.


In order to preserve the peyote ceremony, the federal and state governments encouraged Native American people to organize as a church, said Darrell Red Cloud, the great-great grandson of Chief Red Cloud of the Lakota Nation and vice president of the Native American Church of North America.


In the following decades, the religion grew significantly, with several churches bringing Jesus Christ's name and image into the church so their congregations and worship would be accepted, said Steve Moore, who is non-Native and was formerly a staff attorney at the Native American Rights Fund.


"Local religious leaders in communities would see the image of Jesus, a Bible or cross on the wall of the meeting house or tipi and they would hear references to Jesus in the prayers or songs," he said. "That probably helped persuade the authorities that the Native people were in the process of transformation to Christianity."


This persecution of peyote people continued even after the formation of the Native American Church, said Frank Dayish Jr. a former Navajo Nation vice president and chairperson for the Council of the Peyote Way of Life Coalition.


In the 1960s, there were laws prohibiting peyote in the Navajo Nation, he said. Dayish remembers a time during that period when police confiscated peyote from his church, poured gasoline on the plants and set them on fire.


"I remember my dad and other relatives went over and saved the green peyote that didn't burn," he said, adding that it took decades of lobbying until an amendment to the American Indian Religious Freedom Act in 1994 permitted members of federally recognized Native American tribes to use peyote for religious purposes.


How is peyote used in the Native American Church? 


Peyote is the central part of a ceremony that takes place in a tipi around a crescent-shaped earthen altar mound and a sacred fire. The ceremony typically lasts all night and includes prayer, singing, the sacramental eating of peyote, water rites and spiritual contemplation.




Morgan Tosee, a member of the Comanche Nation who leads ceremonies within the Comanche Native American Church, said peyote is utilized in the context of prayer — not smoked — as many tend to imagine.


"When we use it, we either eat it dry or grind it up," he said. "Sometimes, we make tea out of it. But, we don't drink it like regular tea. You pray with it and take little sips, like you would take medicine."


Tosee echoes the belief that pervades the church: "If you take care of the peyote, it will take care of you."


"And if you believe in it, it will heal you," he said, adding that he has seen the medicine work, healing people with various ailments.


People treat the trip to harvest peyote as a pilgrimage, said Red Cloud. Typically, prayers and ceremonies take place before the pilgrimage to seek blessings for a good journey. Once they get to the peyote gardens, they would touch the ground and thank the Creator before harvesting the medicine. The partaking of peyote is also accompanied by prayer and ceremony. The mescaline in the peyote plant is viewed as God's spirit, Red Cloud said.


"Once we eat it, the sacredness of the medicine is inside of us and it opens the spiritual eye," he said. "From there, we start to see where the medicine is growing. It shows itself to us. Once we complete the harvest, we bring it back home and have another ceremony to the medicine and give thanks to the Creator."

## Virginia zoo welcomes newborn pygmy hippopotamus as year ends

date: 2024-12-29, from: VOA News USA

richmond, virginia — A female pygmy hippopotamus delivered a healthy calf at the Metro Richmond Zoo earlier this month, officials said — the third baby hippo born at the zoo within the past five years. 


The mother, Iris, gave birth to the female calf on December 9 following a seven-month gestation, zoo officials said. The newborn, who has yet to be named, is the third calf for Iris and the father, Corwin.


One of the calves born previously was also a December baby, the zoo said.


"Most people don't get a hippopotamus for Christmas at all, so we feel lucky to have received two over the years," zoo officials said in a news release Tuesday. 


Five days after her birth, the baby had a neonatal exam and weighed 6.8 kilograms. Officials said that fully grown pygmy hippos can weigh up to 270 kilograms. 


According to the Richmond-area zoo, pygmy hippos are an endangered West African species, and only 2,500 mature hippos remain in the wild. Officials said pygmy hippos are distinctive from regular hippos because they do not live in groups and are usually solitary or in pairs. 


"For this reason, once Iris' two previous calves grew up, they were moved to other zoological facilities to live with future mates and continue contributing to the conservation of their species," the news release said.

## Elaborate holiday light displays are making spirits bright in a big way

date: 2024-12-29, from: VOA News USA

CONCORD, New Hampshire — Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow might be enough to brighten some homes this holiday season. But others are adorned with thousands of blinking lights synched to blasting music, drawing crowds and bolstering both holiday and community spirit. 


In a cul-de-sac in Mesa, Arizona, 14 homeowners have been going all out on holiday lights for the last 30 years in a tradition that hasn't been diminished by real estate turnover. 


Those buying homes in the neighborhood often find the attics full of decor left behind as a gift from the previous owners, and despite cultural and religious differences, residents come together to create a festival of lights, Stephanie Castillo Price said. 




"Everybody has been able to take their interpretation of the holidays and put it into a full circle," she said. "There's not somebody that's going to walk down the street and not feel included." 


In Santa Clarita, California, residents of Wakefield Court decided to coordinate their holiday light displays as a way to bring some joy to their community after an earthquake. Now in its 30th year, the Wakefield Winter Wonderland includes inflatable figures and wooden cutouts of a variety of characters, from Mickey Mouse to Homer Simpson. 


Bryan Cobb admits he initially was against buying a home in the neighborhood when he and his wife first viewed it. 


"She started crying and said, 'But this is the Christmas street! I want to live there!' " he said. "She got her way. We live here, we love it. All the neighbors bond together." 


In Edmond, Oklahoma, those looking to the western sky will easily spot the Miranda family's elaborate holiday light display featuring images and music from the movie "Wicked." Spotlights reminiscent of movie studio lights shoot up from the roof, while a singing witch's face takes shape across a towering tree. 


"It just seemed like the perfect fit with a light show because you can really do the drama with the lights," said Elisabeth Miranda, who handles the programming while her husband, Mark, tackles installation. "It takes a very long time to set up. Every single bulb has a spot, a place, a number, so that when we program it, it does exactly what it needs to do at the right time." 




The family started putting up holiday lights in 2015 and saw a surge in traffic after being featured on ABC's "The Great Christmas Light Fight." While most neighbors have been supportive, a few complaints prompted the couple to take a few years off before returning with a better plan to limit viewing hours and control traffic. 


This year, they are collecting donations for the Oklahoma Fraternal Order of Police. 


"They give so much back to our community, so that's our little way of saying thank you to them for everything they do for us," Miranda said. 


Charity also is a component in Las Vegas, where Laura Walters and Lenny Standish are closing in on a four-year goal of collecting 10,000 pairs of socks and underwear for organizations that help homeless people. 


Their display started during the COVID-19 pandemic with a single Christmas tree for community members to add ornaments. This year, they have three snow machines in addition to the lights and music. 


"People are looking for joy," Walters said. "Our world is a tough place. So to be able to just come and feel just an incredible amount of love and happiness — it's peaceful. We've never had one problem here at all. Everyone's been highly respectful of our home and full of gratitude." 


Richard Taylor of Kennesaw, Georgia, estimates that more than 40,000 people visit his display of 1.2 million lights each year. 


"We bring joy to a lot of people," he said. "They walk around and they forget all their problems, and they just enjoy themselves."

## Abortions more common in US, as women turn to pills, travel

date: 2024-12-29, from: VOA News USA

Abortion has become more common despite bans or deep restrictions in most Republican-controlled states, and the legal and political fights over its future are not over yet.


It's now been two and a half years since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and opened the door for states to implement bans.


The policies and their impact have been in flux ever since the ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization.


Here's a look at data on where things stand:


Abortions are more common than before Dobbs 


Overturning Roe and enforcing abortion bans has changed how woman obtain abortions in the United States.


One thing it hasn't done is put a dent in the number of abortions being obtained.


There have been slightly more monthly abortions across the country recently than there were in the months leading up to the June 2022 ruling, even as the number in states with bans dropped to near zero.


"Abortion bans don’t actually prevent abortions from happening," said Ushma Upadhyay, a public health social scientist at the University of California San Francisco.


For women in some states, there are major obstacles to getting abortions — and advocates say that low-income, minority and immigrant women are least likely to be able to get them when they want.


For those living in states with bans, the ways to access abortion are through travel or abortion pills.


Pills become bigger part of equation — and legal questions 


As the bans happened, abortion pills became a bigger part of the equation.


They were involved in about half the abortions before Dobbs. More recently, it’s been closer to two-thirds of them, according to research by the Guttmacher Institute.


The uptick of that kind of abortion, usually involving a combination of two drugs, was underway before the ruling.




But now, it's become more common for pill prescriptions to be made by telehealth. By the summer of 2024, about 1 in 10 abortions were via pills prescribed via telehealth to patients in states where abortion is banned.


As a result, the pills are now at the center of battles over abortion access.


This month, Texas sued a New York doctor for prescribing pills to a Texas woman via telemedicine. There's also an effort by Idaho, Kansas and Missouri to roll back their federal approvals and treat them as "controlled dangerous substances," and a push for the federal government to start enforcing a 19th-century federal law to ban mailing them.




Travel for abortion has increased 


Clinics have closed or halted abortions in states with bans.


A network of efforts to get women seeking abortions to places where they're legal has strengthened and travel for abortion is now common.


The Guttmacher Institute found that more than twice as many Texas residents obtained abortions in 2023 in New Mexico as New Mexico residents did. And as many Texans received them in Kansas as Kansans.


Abortion funds, which benefitted from "rage giving" in 2022, helped pay the costs for many abortion-seekers. But some funds have had to cap how much they can give.


The ban that took effect in Florida this year has been a game-changer


Florida, the nation’s third most-populous state, began on May 1 enforcing a ban on abortions after the first six weeks of pregnancy.


That immediately changed the state from one that was a refuge for other Southerners seeking abortions to an exporter of people looking for them.


There were about 30% fewer abortions there in May compared with the average for the first three months of the year. And in June, there were 35% fewer.


While the ban is not unique, the impact is especially large. The average driving time from Florida to a facility in North Carolina where abortion is available for the first 12 weeks of pregnancy is more than nine hours, according to data maintained by Caitlin Myers, a Middlebury College economics professor.


Clinics have opened or expanded in some places 


The bans have meant clinics closed or stopped offering abortions in some states.


But some states where abortion remains legal until viability – generally considered to be sometime past 21 weeks of pregnancy — have seen clinics open and expand.


Illinois, Kansas and New Mexico are among the states with new clinics.


There were 799 publicly identifiable abortion providers in the U.S. in May 2022, the month before the Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade. And by this November, it was 792, according to a tally by Myers, who is collecting data on abortion providers.


Myers said some hospitals that always provided some abortions have begun advertising it. So, they’re now in the count of clinics – even though they might provide few of them.


Lack of access to abortions during emergencies threatens patients' lives 


How hospitals handle pregnancy complications, especially those that threaten the lives of the women, has emerged as a major issue since Roe was overturned.


President Joe Biden's administration said hospitals must offer abortions when they're needed to prevent organ loss, hemorrhage or deadly infections, even in states with bans. Texas is challenging the administration’s policy and the U.S. Supreme Court this year declined to take it up after the Biden administration sued Idaho.


More than 100 pregnant women seeking help in emergency rooms were turned away or left unstable since 2022, The Associated Press found in an analysis of federal hospital investigative records.


Among the complaints were a woman who miscarried in the lobby restroom of Texas emergency room after staff refused to see her and a woman who gave birth in a car after a North Carolina hospital couldn't offer an ultrasound. The baby later died.


"It is increasingly less safe to be pregnant and seeking emergency care in an emergency department," Dara Kass, an emergency medicine doctor and former U.S. Health and Human Services official told the AP earlier this year.

## North Korea launches 'toughest' US strategy during key party meeting

date: 2024-12-29, from: VOA News USA

SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un held a key policy-setting meeting of the country's ruling party last week ahead of the new year, state media KCNA reported on Sunday. 


The meeting of party and government officials decided that North Korea would launch the "toughest" strategy to counteract the United States for its security and national interests, the report said, without elaborating. 


The alliance between South Korea, the U.S. and Japan has expanded to a "nuclear military bloc" and South Korea has become an "anti-communist outpost" for the U.S., the KCNA report added. 


"This reality clearly shows to which direction we should advance and what we should do and how," it said. 


The December 23-27 meeting also reviewed the handling of floods earlier this year, including the plan that brought those affected to Pyongyang, the capital, according to the report. 


The reclusive state also vowed to promote relations with "friendly" countries during the meeting. 


Kim also called for progress in defense, science and technology to bolster the country's war deterrence.  


Such meetings often last a few days and have been used in recent years to make key policy announcements. 


In a reshuffle, Pyongyang named Pak Thae Song, a party secretary, as a new premier to replace Kim Tok Hun. 


Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui was named a member of the powerful Politburo of the party's Central Committee. 


The 11th plenary session of the eighth central committee of the Workers' Party of Korea wraps up a year in which Russian President Vladimir Putin held a summit with Kim and signed a deal that included a mutual defense pledge. 


Washington and Seoul have criticized the two countries' military cooperation, including what they say is a dispatch of North Korean troops to fight for Russia in its war against Ukraine.

## Storms delay, cancel thousands of flights across US

date: 2024-12-29, from: VOA News USA

Severe weather disrupted holiday travel on Saturday across the United States with deadly tornadoes in the Southeast and heavy snow and wind on the West Coast delaying or canceling thousands of flights across the country. 


More than 7,000 flights in the U.S. were delayed on Saturday, according to the tracking site FlightAware, and more than 200 were canceled. 


About a third of the flights were delayed at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in Atlanta, Georgia, according to FlightAware, and nearly half of the flights originating from Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport in Texas and George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston, Texas, were delayed. 


At least 10 tornadoes touched down in the U.S. states of Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi on Saturday, leaving one person dead near Houston, the National Weather Service and local law enforcement said. 


"Those numbers will probably go up," said forecaster Aaron Gleason, with the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center. 


The one death and four injuries were reported Saturday in Brazoria County, Texas, about 45 miles south of Houston, according to the Brazoria County Sheriff's Office. 


Officials say that many homes and schools were severely damaged or destroyed. Images on social media show scattered ruins of homes and snapped trees and utility poles strewn across streets and lawns. 


Out west, high winds, with gusts up to 241 kilometers per hour in the high elevations of the Tahoe Basin in California and 80 kph at lower elevations hit the area this weekend and with heavy rainfall expected from San Francisco to Portland, Oregon, forecasters said. 


Forecasters said to expect between 10 and 15 centimeters of rain before New Year's Eve and up to 3 meters of snow in Lake Tahoe, located on the border of California and Nevada. 


“Damaging winds could blow down trees and power lines,” the Weather Service warned. “Widespread power outages are possible.”
