## A Senior Prank of Cosmic Proportions: Kip Thorne’s 85th Birthday Bash

date: 2025-06-03, from: California Tech (Caltech Student Newspaper)

Contrary to a certain rumor, this year’s Senior Prank did <em>not</em> involve placing a Cybertruck on the roof of Beckman Auditorium. Instead, we celebrated Nobel Laureate Prof. Kip Thorne’s 85th birthday following the transformation of Beckman into the wedding cake it’s often called. Festivities included a music-synchronized light show and Kip-themed treats: Kipcorn (popcorn),  Kippy candy (cotton candy), atomic fireballs, starburst, cosmic freeze berry star clusters, star lollipops,  Kipper snacks (sardines), and Milky Ways. It was truly an out-of-this-world party that bent the fabric of spacetime!

## Artificial Intelligence: Our Modern Promethean Fire

date: 2025-06-03, from: California Tech (Caltech Student Newspaper)

It is well known that A.I. companies have red-teaming, RLHF, and guardrail teams specialized in protecting against hate speech, bomb-making, or any crazy idea that pops into a person&rsquo;s destructive mind. However, even with protection, the A.I. can be &ldquo;tricked&rdquo; and bypass the blockade, creating monstrosities. If there are psychopathic humans capable of manipulating and convincing crowds, just imagine a tool built with data from the entire internet.

## Caltech Wildlife: Juvenile Panel Interviews

date: 2025-06-03, from: California Tech (Caltech Student Newspaper)

As Commencement draws near, your nerdy wildlife columnist decided to explore a timely topic: what does &ldquo;graduation&rdquo; mean in the animal world? How do young creatures transition out of their juvenile phase—and what counts as &ldquo;adulthood&rdquo;?

## Finding Faith and Family Far From Home: My Journey with ASK Ministries

date: 2025-06-03, from: California Tech (Caltech Student Newspaper)

When I first set foot in California, leaving behind the sun-kissed hills of Italy, my heart was heavy with anticipation and anxiety. As someone raised in a profoundly Catholic family, faith was not just a tradition—it was the very fabric of my upbringing. Church bells, Sunday Mass, and a close-knit parish community were constants in my life. The thought of crossing the Atlantic for my studies filled me with excitement and a silent worry: Would I find a place where my faith could thrive? Would I see a community that shared my values, or would I feel lost in the vastness of a new culture?

## Giving the Planet a Break with Dr. Daniel Lewis

date: 2025-06-03, from: California Tech (Caltech Student Newspaper)

“My mom used to drag us out in the middle of the night to go watch the volcano when it would erupt. At like 3 am, she’d drag us out, get in our VW Van, and travel up the hill to the volcano,” Lecturer in History Dr. Daniel Lewis explains of his childhood in Hawai‘i. “Right now, it’s erupting in these thousand-foot plumes. Now would be the time to go—it’s mind-blowing.” His time in Hawai‘i left him with a deep appreciation of nature and countless unique stories.

## Hic et Nunc: Presence Under Pressure at Caltech

date: 2025-06-03, from: California Tech (Caltech Student Newspaper)

Amid deadlines, data, and delayed dreams, it’s easy to overlook the fact that life doesn’t wait for us to solve every problem. At Caltech, where ambition surrounds us and the future feels constant, the present can easily fade into the background. Yet beneath the weight of equations, lab reports, and sleepless nights lies a truth waiting to be unearthed: <em>hic et nunc</em>—“here and now.” This simple, ancient Latin phrase serves as a profound reminder that our only true existence is in the present.

## How Benson Boone Saved My College Life

date: 2025-06-03, from: California Tech (Caltech Student Newspaper)

When I first set foot on Caltech’s campus, I felt like a contestant on a reality show called <em>Survivor: Genius Island</em>. I was fresh off the plane from Milan, armed with a suitcase full of dreams, a double major in biology and chemistry (because why not suffer twice as much?), and a secret hope to someday heal cancer. I planned to take the world by storm—or, at the very least, survive my first quarter without accidentally setting something on fire in the lab.

## I Have Failed

date: 2025-06-03, from: California Tech (Caltech Student Newspaper)

I had my mouth pressed into the sand. I was breathing hard—desperate, shallow, uneven. I could feel the grains entering my nose, throat, and lungs. Somewhere nearby, I heard the rapid thudding of hooves, the panicked exhale of a frightened horse. For a moment, I couldn’t remember where I was. I couldn’t piece it together. The memories didn’t come in order; they arrived like broken glass, sharp and disjointed. My helmet. My shoulder. The ground. Pain. Sharp pain. A blinding throb in my knee.

## Is That All There Is? — A Letter From the Editor

date: 2025-06-03, from: California Tech (Caltech Student Newspaper)

I am obsessed with David Lynch. Maybe unhealthily so. Few directors feel as fluent in the art of the somnambulistic; I know of no other director who could so deftly craft phantasmagorical operas of the manifold dream-nightmare that is the human experience.

## Music in a Temple of Science

date: 2025-06-03, from: California Tech (Caltech Student Newspaper)

The Mount Wilson Solar Observatory was founded in 1904 by George Hale, who was also a trustee of Throop Polytechnic Institute (which later became Caltech). The first telescope built on-site was the Snow Solar Telescope in 1904, followed closely by the 60-foot Solar Tower and the 60-inch telescope, both of which were completed in 1908. Hale hosted many famous individuals during this time, including Andrew Carnegie in 1910 and Harlow Shapley in 1914. Carnegie was the main financial supporter of the observatory from its inception in 1904, and Shapley was an astronomer who discovered our position in the Milky Way galaxy using the 60-inch telescope.

## Path Optimization on Campus

date: 2025-06-03, from: California Tech (Caltech Student Newspaper)

I can’t be sure, but if I had to take a gamble, I would guess most of you—like me—are always trying to optimize our paths around campus. There are multiple reasons this could be true: (almost) late for class and want to minimize how much you miss? Want to make it to Tom Mannion’s OH before the rest of campus wipes out all the Flamin’ Hot Cheetos? Want to get to bed when a coyote is chasing you down? Want to get the latest sighting of Ted Danson on campus? Want to make that last 2:58 p.m. dash to Browne on the weekend before all you have is Red Door?  Want to beat the 10:30 a.m. line explosion at Red Door? Or the weekend 3 p.m. line explosion? Or the 10 p.m. line explosion, or… You get the idea.

## Reminiscences of Caltech Rugby

date: 2025-06-03, from: California Tech (Caltech Student Newspaper)

I read the article in <em>The California Tech</em> about the Caltech Rugby Club with great interest because I organised a rugby team at Caltech about 60 years ago (between 1965 and 1967). Most of the team were foreign graduate students from rugby-playing countries, but a few Americans joined us. We had mixed success but managed a few wins, notably against UCLA. The games against USC and Eagle Rock were particularly scary, as their teams consisted of very large American Football players looking for blood and violence in the off-season. We won a few games we didn’t deserve to because of the athletic ability of Mick Mortell from Ireland—he could kick penalties from 50 meters and more.

## Robots and Remembrance: Transcending Memory With Dementia Doula

date: 2025-06-03, from: California Tech (Caltech Student Newspaper)

On May 3rd, Frautschi Hall, 7 p.m., as part of MACH 33: The Caltech Festival of New Science-Driven Plays, was the latest version of Tom Lavagnino’s <em>Dementia Doula</em>. Like the festival’s other show, entitled <em>The Null Test</em> (which explores the legal hijinks of a self-driving car company), this was a staged reading: the cast, directed by Susan Dalian, performing from scripts on music stands. Originally presented under the name <em>Crisis Goalie</em> at the 2024 Utah Shakespeare Festival, then directed by Britannia Howe, this pared-down staging celebrates the script on its own terms, privileging nuanced acting over elaborate production.

## Silk Installation at the Huntington Reflects on a World ‘Without Us’

date: 2025-06-03, from: California Tech (Caltech Student Newspaper)

Looking down from a plane, Wang Mansheng felt uneasy about how much of the Earth is now covered by roads and buildings. Reflecting on this environmental change, he stated, “Pure nature is now unattainable except through my imagination or brush.” His new works at the Huntington put that imagined nature on display.

## Stars, Solutions, and Service: A SASS Lunch with Dr. Lorraine Lundquist

date: 2025-06-03, from: California Tech (Caltech Student Newspaper)

At first glance, Dr. Loraine Lundquist might strike you as a scientist with her head in the stars. After all, she holds a Ph.D. in physics from UC Berkeley and once helped launch a satellite to study the Sun&rsquo;s magnetic field. But spend an hour with her, and that’s precisely what we did during the recent SASS Lunch hosted by the Caltech Y—and you’ll quickly realize that her gaze is firmly grounded on Earth, with a heart set on building a more just and sustainable future right here in Los Angeles.
