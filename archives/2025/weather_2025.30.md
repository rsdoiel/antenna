Mesoscale Discussion 1821

0721 AM CDT Mon Jul 28 2025

Areas affected...parts of western/central ND

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 281221Z - 281415Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...A persistent supercell or two may yield a confined swath
of large hail and strong gusts into late morning. Monitoring for
possible Severe Thunderstorm Watch issuance.

DISCUSSION...A couple elevated supercells are ongoing across
southwest/west-central ND, along and just north of I-94. Despite a
lack of reported severe thus far, strong westerly speed shear above
3 km (now sampled by the BIS VWP and 12Z observed sounding) has
sustained persistent organizational structures as these cells spread
across the MT/ND border. This elevated activity is likely to persist
into midday along the buoyancy gradient across western ND. Large
hail and strong gusts should be the primary hazards. Severe wind may
increase if flanking convection can form along the outflow into a
destabilizing airmass over SD. But ongoing low clouds/fog in the
swath of richest low-level moisture casts uncertainty on whether
that scenario may occur soon or later today.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0725 AM CDT Mon Jul 28 2025

Valid 281300Z - 291200Z

...THERE IS A MODERATE RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON
AND TONIGHT OVER PORTIONS OF EASTERN SOUTH DAKOTA AND SOUTHWESTERN
MINNESOTA....

...SUMMARY...
Numerous severe thunderstorms capable of widespread damaging winds
are likely across portions of the northern Plains, with several
gusts expected to exceed 75 mph. A few line-embedded tornadoes and
instances of severe hail may also occur. Widely scattered storms may
produce severe wind and hail over portions of Montana.

...Northern Plains...
A convectively active afternoon and evening is expected across parts
of the Dakotas/MN/IA/WI, where numerous intense thunderstorms are
expected.  An overnight MCS has temporarily stabilized/modified the
air mass across much of MN/IA.  A consensus of model guidance
appears to have handled this scenario well, and depicts rapid return
of low-level moisture and heating across this region by
mid-afternoon.  Meanwhile upstream in eastern MT and western ND/SD,
a subtle shortwave trough will top the ridge and spread large scale
forcing into the region, leading to scattered thunderstorm
development.  Very steep mid-level lapse rates are in place across
ND/SD, where easterly low-level winds and evapo-transpiration will
help surface dewpoints to rise to near 70F.  Forecast soundings show
extreme instability will develop (MLCAPE values over 6000 J/kg)
aiding in rapid intensification of supercells across central SD. 
Large hail, damaging winds, and a few tornadoes may occur with this
early activity.  

The most likely scenario for evening convective activity continues
to be for an organized and fast-moving linear MCS to develop and
race eastward across eastern SD into parts of MN/IA.  One or more
corridors of widespread/significant wind damage are expected,
possibly achieving derecho criteria.  Have extended the ENH/SLGT
risk areas a little farther east into parts of MN/IA/WI, where a few
overnight CAM solutions suggest the bowing complex persists before
weakening late tonight.

...Central MT...
Easterly low-level winds across MT will advect moisture westward
into the mountains, where scattered thunderstorm development is
expected by late afternoon.  These storms will spread into central
MT during the evening, with sufficient CAPE and vertical shear for a
risk of large hail and damaging wind gusts.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0349 AM CDT Mon Jul 28 2025

Valid 311200Z - 051200Z

...DISCUSSION...
By late next week, the upper-level trough in the Northeast will be
moving into the Canadian Maritimes. In its wake, high pressure at
the surface will build into the Upper Midwest/Ohio Valley. This will
push the surface front farther south each day through the weekend.
In the West, cyclonic flow will tend to weaken over time. The
surface front will be pushed up against the Rockies. Model guidance
shows progressively lower amounts of buoyancy south of the front in
the Southeast, likely due to repeated days of convection. This
activity will also become farther removed from stronger shear. Winds
with some upslope component with weak/modest westerlies aloft could
allow for some severe risk near the Rockies and adjacent High
Plains, but the overall weak shear and potential for sequential
convective days leading to a poor quality airmass suggest the threat
is like to remain marginal. Predictability of organized severe
weather remains low.

## Tropical Storm Iona Forecast Discussion Number 5

date: 2025-07-28, from: Central Pacific Basin Tropical Cyclones

<pre>741 
WTPA41 PHFO 280840
TCDCP1
 
Tropical Storm Iona Discussion Number   5
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 PM HST Sun Jul 27 2025
 
The satellite presentation of Iona has improved this evening, with a
well-defined curved banding structure and excellent upper-level
outflow evident in all quadrants. A recent 28/0650Z Metop-C ASCAT
pass showed a few wind barbs near 40 knots. The latest subjective
Dvorak current intensity estimates came in at 3.0/45 knots from
PHFO, 3.0/45 knots from SAB, and 2.5/35 knots from JTWC. Objective
intensity estimates ranged from 42 to 49 knots. Taking a blend of
these data, the initial intensity for this advisory has been raised
to 45 knots, which may still be slightly conservative.
 
Tropical Storm Iona is moving westward at 270 degrees/10 knots. This
general motion is expected to continue over the next several days as
the cyclone moves along the southern periphery of a subtropical
ridge to the north. A gradual increase in forward speed is also
expected, due to a strengthening low- to mid-level ridge north of
the system. The track forecast remains closely aligned with a blend
of the FSSE, HCCA, and GFEX consensus guidance and is nearly
unchanged from the previous advisory. Confidence remains high that
Iona will stay well south of the Hawaiian Islands.
 
The environment appears conducive for further intensification over
the next day or so, as Iona remains over warm waters near 28C, with
adequate mid-level moisture and very light vertical wind shear. In
fact, the latest GFS and ECMWF SHIPS guidance indicates more than a
30 percent chance of a 25-knot increase in intensity over the next
24 hours. Given the current structure and favorable conditions, the
intensity forecast explicitly calls for rapid intensification during
the next 24 hours, with Iona expected to become a hurricane late
Monday or Monday night. Iona should reach peak intensity Monday
night or Tuesday, with steady weakening anticipated beginning
Tuesday night, as the system moves over slightly cooler waters,
begins to experience increasing westerly vertical wind shear, and
starts to entrain drier mid-level air. The cyclone is expected to
become a post-tropical remnant low by Day 5 and could potentially
weaken into a trough by that time. The intensity forecast has been
raised from the previous advisory to reflect the latest trends in
the guidance, and is best aligned with the FSSE and IVCN consensus
solutions.

## Tropical Depression One-C Forecast Discussion Number 3

WTPA41 PHFO 272035

Tropical Depression One-C Discussion Number   3
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 AM HST Sun Jul 27 2025
 
The system continues to become better organized this morning, with 
deep convection in curved banding generally to the west of the 
center. Recent imagery shows that convection has been developing the 
last few hours near the low-level center, with some increased 
curvature. Subjective Dvorak satellite intensity estimates from HFO 
and SAB were T/2.0 this cycle. A scatterometer pass is expected 
shortly which should give a better idea of the surface winds. Using 
the Dvorak estimates, the intensity is held at 30 kt.
 
The system is moving westward at about 270/10 kt. A westward motion 
is expected the next several days as the cyclone moves on the south 
side of a mid-level ridge. There continues to be some spread in the 
along track guidance, although there is high confidence on the 
system remaining well south of the Hawaiian islands. The NHC track 
forecast is similar to the previous, and lies closest to the HCCA 
corrected consensus aids.
 
Environmental conditions appear favorable for some gradual 
strengthening the next couple of days. The hurricane regional models 
remain at the higher end of the guidance envelope, and the latest 
NHC forecast is near the previous. Beyond 48 h, a gradual weakening 
trend should begin as the system moves over slightly cooler sea 
surface temperatures, a drier airmass, and vertical wind shear is 
expected to increase. The gradual weakening trend will cause the 
system to become a remnant low by day 5, potentially even opening 
into a trough.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0300 PM CDT Sun Jul 27 2025

Valid 272000Z - 281200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS
SOUTHERN/CENTRAL MINNESOTA AND FAR EASTERN SOUTH DAKOTA...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
MID-ATLANTIC STATES...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are expected this afternoon and evening across
parts of the Upper Midwest to western Great Lakes. Other severe
storms are also possible in parts of the northern Plains, central
Appalachians, and Mid-Atlantic.

...20Z Update...
Both the Slight and Enhanced risks were expanded slightly
west-southwestward in eastern SD with this update. Here, the latest
guidance has come into relatively good agreement, depicting
convective development ahead of a gradually evolving surface low
into this evening. Very steep deep-layer lapse rates/extreme
surface-based buoyancy and 40-50 kt of effective shear will promote
supercells/organized clusters capable of producing large hail and
severe wind gusts. 

Farther east, the Marginal risk was expanded southward across
southeastern NC into northern SC. Strong heating/destabilization
will promote damaging wind gusts with any small thunderstorm
clusters that evolve.

..Weinman.. 07/27/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1200 PM CDT Sun Jul 27 2025/

...Upper Midwest/western Great Lakes including MN/eastern SD...
A convectively enhanced mid-level shortwave trough over
northern/eastern North Dakota will continue generally eastward
toward northern Minnesota, with a modest flattening of the
downstream upper-level ridge into tonight. A modest deepening of the
surface low will occur across eastern South Dakota toward the
southwest Minnesota border vicinity, with intense thunderstorm
development later today generally expected to focus along the
southeastward-advancing front, although differential heating and a
convectively aided cluster/possible MCV across northeast South
Dakota at midday may also be factors. 

Given the strong buoyancy near/south of the front, and very steep
lapse rates/elevated mixed layer impinging from the west-southwest,
modestly strong wind profiles will be sufficient for intense
supercell development with initial storms, including large hail
potential (higher magnitudes possible especially eastern South
Dakotas and southwest Minnesota) and some tornado risk. Multiple
southeastward-moving clusters should evolve this evening with an
increasing likelihood of damaging wind across southern Minnesota
into western/northern Wisconsin. Portions of the region have been
upgraded to an Enhanced Risk. 

...Mid-Atlantic/Central Appalachians...
Scattered afternoon thunderstorms will continue to increase
regionally. Similar to previous days, mid-level lapse rates will be
weak and considerable mid-level moisture will keep the overall
potential somewhat limited/isolated. However, the strongest cells
will be capable of occasional gusty/damaging winds, with a somewhat
higher probability of wind damage seemingly existing across eastern
Virginia where buoyancy will be greater.

...Montana...
Strong heating will occur this afternoon across much of
central/eastern Montana, where deep boundary-layer mixing will lead
to inverted-v profiles. Scattered thunderstorms are forecast to
develop along a corridor from southwest into central Montana by late
afternoon. These high-based storms may pose a risk of a few
severe-caliber wind gusts.

SUMMARY...Scattered thunderstorm activity will promote a few
instances of strong to severe wind this afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Scattered thunderstorm activity has increased in
coverage across portions of eastern North Carolina this afternoon.
The air mass in this region is very hot and unstable, but deep layer
shear for a more organized severe threat remains weak. Given the
deep moisture and strong instability, a few wet downbursts may
produce some instances of strong to severe wind. Overall, this
threat will remain too isolated for watch issuance.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0218 PM CDT Sun Jul 27 2025

Valid 291200Z - 301200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM MONTANA
INTO THE CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS EASTWARD TO PARTS OF THE
MID-MISSISSIPPI VALLEY...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are possible from southern Montana into the
central High Plains as well as parts of the Mid-Missouri and
Mid-Mississippi Valleys on Tuesday.

...Central Plains to Mid-MS Valley vicinity...

Another day of severe storms/MCS potential will exist on Tuesday.
However, uncertainty remains high given several rounds of severe
storms expected over the coming days prior to Tuesday/Day 3.
However, the severe risk appears to be shunted a bit south compared
to prior days, with southern SD/NE into IA and southern WI/northern
IL the more likely corridor for severe potential on Tuesday. 

Convection may be ongoing across parts of WI/IL Tuesday morning. Any
outflow associated with this system could become a focus for
redevelopment during the afternoon. Further west, a surface low will
be located over southern NE/KS with a cold front somewhere in the
vicinity of northeast CO/western NE Tuesday morning. The surface
low/front and where the cold front possibly intersects the outflow
boundary further east also will be a focus for severe thunderstorm
development. Stronger westerly flow aloft will likely remain
somewhat displaced from the corridor of favorable
thermodynamics/low-level moisture and surface boundaries.
Nevertheless, storms producing large hail and damaging/severe gusts
appear likely somewhere within the broad region from the central
Plains to the Mid-MS/Lake Michigan vicinity.  Given uncertainty,
will maintain the Marginal risk (level 1 of 5), but a corridor of
greater potential will likely emerge in the coming day or two. 

...MT into the Central High Plains...

Abundant boundary layer moisture will persist even in the wake of
the surface front from MT into eastern WY, western SD/NE and
northeast CO. The low-level upslope flow regime will support
thunderstorm development near higher terrain initially. This
activity should intensify as it moves off higher terrain into a
corridor of moderate to strong instability by late afternoon/early
evening. Effective shear will be strongest across MT/northeast
WY/western SD (around 40 kt), weakening with southward extent into
northeast CO (around 20-25 kt). Steep lapse rates and
elongated/straight hodographs suggest isolated large hail will be
possible. Meanwhile, steep low-level lapse rates/mixing to near 700
mb should support isolated strong/severe gusts as well. 

...Lower MI/IN/OH vicinity...

A decaying MCS and associated MCV may be located over WI/IL Tuesday
morning. This feature could develop east/southeast with time and
become a focus for thunderstorm develop during the afternoon or
evening within the very moist and strongly unstable airmass across
the region. However, forecast guidance is not consistent with this
scenario, possibly due to nebulous large-scale ascent. Given
uncertainty/conditional nature of this potential risk, will hold off
on expanding severe probabilities further east, but a risk area may
be needed in later outlooks depending on trends.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0213 PM CDT Sun Jul 27 2025

Valid 281200Z - 291200Z

...19z Update...
A mix of wet/dry storms remains likely across parts of the northern
Great Basin, Cascades and into eastern OR/western ID Monday. While
some wetting rainfall is likely, and could occur over areas that
have seen recent accumulations, dry inverted V structures should
allow for isolated dry strikes to occur within areas of receptive
fuels. CAM guidance has trended more aggressive with storms along
the slops of the Cascades. Have adjusted the IsoDryT area slightly
west to better cover the threat for isolated dry storms.

..Lyons.. 07/27/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0132 AM CDT Sun Jul 27 2025/

...Synopsis...
A similar weather pattern is in store for the U.S. tomorrow
(Monday), with a mid-level trough expected to meander along the West
Coast as upper ridging prevails over the remainder of the CONUS.
Locally dry and breezy conditions are expected across portions of
the Four Corners into the central Rockies, though the lack of a
stronger surface wind field precludes Elevated highlights at this
time. Mid-level moisture ahead of the upper trough will support a
mix of wet and dry thunderstorms Sunday afternoon and evening over
far northern parts of the Great Basin into the Pacific Northwest.
Given dry fuels in place, isolated dry thunderstorm highlights have
been introduced.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1232 PM CDT Sun Jul 27 2025

Valid 281200Z - 291200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM CENTRAL
MONTANA INTO WESTERN WISCONSIN...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are possible from the northern Rockies into the
Dakotas and Upper Midwest Monday afternoon and evening. Large hail
and damaging/severe wind gusts are expected. Isolated intense gusts
to 85 mph may occur from eastern South Dakota into southern
Minnesota.

...Eastern SD into WI...

A favorable pattern for a damaging wind event is evident on Monday
from central/eastern SD into southern MN, far northern IA and
portions of WI. A 10 percent significant wind area has been
delineated and the Slight risk (level 2 of 5) has been expanded
eastward. However, some uncertainties remain (related to Day
1/Sunday convective evolution), precluding a categorical increase to
Enhanced risk (level 3 of 5) at this time.

Enhanced westerly flow is forecast across the northern Plains
vicinity as a series of shortwave perturbations float through the
top of the upper ridge from the northern Rockies into the Upper
Midwest. At 500 mb, 40-60 kt westerly flow will be common. At the
surface, a very moist (mid/upper 70s dewpoints) airmass will be in
place. A plume of steep midlevel lapse rates are also evident if
model forecasts. This combination of a very moist/warm boundary
layer beneath steep lapse rates will support a corridor of strong to
extreme instability (3000-5000+ J/kg MLCAPE) from eastern SD into
southern MN/northern IA and southwest WI.

A surface low is forecast over southern SD/northern NE. A cold front
will develop south/southeast across the Dakotas and Upper Midwest. A
modified outflow boundary from Day 1/Sunday convection also will
likely be in place across parts of MN/IA/WI, though where this
boundary will be is uncertain at this time. The surface low will be
a focus for initial robust thunderstorm development in SD during the
afternoon. With time, upscale growth is likely to occur as a modest
low-level jet develops during the evening. Convection will likely
develop east/southeast along the instability gradient defined by
prior outflow and the southward sagging cold front. Initial
thunderstorms could produce large hail and damaging gusts, with a
transition toward damaging/severe wind swaths if/when upscale growth
occurs. The main uncertainty precluding higher probabilities is
related to how Day 1/Sunday convection will impact the boundary
layer and where related outflow and airmass recovery will occur.
Higher probabilities may be necessary in subsequent outlooks.

...Montana into the western Dakotas...

Isolated to scattered thunderstorms are expected to develop within
the post-frontal upslope regime where boundary layer moisture in the
mid 50s to mid 60s will persist behind the surface boundary. Strong
heating and steep midlevel lapse rates will support 1000-3000 J/kg
MLCAPE values (from west to east) amid elongated/straight
hodographs. Large hail and isolated strong/severe wind gusts will be
possible with this activity.

1158 AM CDT Sun Jul 27 2025

Valid 271700Z - 281200Z

...17z Update...
Morning guidance shows stronger surface winds and continued
dry/breezy conditions are likely over parts of southern UT and far
eastern NV this afternoon. With gusts of 15-20 mph and RH below 20%,
several hours of elevated fire-weather conditions are expected. Have
updated the western edge of the Elevated area for the most recent
guidance. Otherwise, minimal changes were made for the latest
guidance. See the prior outlook for more info.

..Lyons.. 07/27/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0118 AM CDT Sun Jul 27 2025/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will linger along the West Coast as upper ridging
builds over the remainder of the CONUS today. Weak mid-level
perturbations pivoting around the trough will traverse the Great
Basin into the northern Rockies, providing enough upper support for
both dry and breezy conditions across the central Rockies, and
thunderstorm activity over parts of the Northern Great Basin into
the Pacific Northwest.

Across the central Rockies, sustained southwesterly surface winds
may exceed 15 mph for several hours, amid 15 percent RH and dry
fuels, warranting Elevated highlights. Across the northern Great
Basin into the Pacific Northwest, the lifting of mid-level moisture
will encourage high-based thunderstorm development by afternoon.
Forecast soundings depict inverted-v profiles, suggesting that a
combination of wet and dry thunderstorms are possible. With dry
fuels in place, isolated dry thunderstorm highlights have been

## Tropical Depression One-C Forecast Discussion Number 1

date: 2025-07-27, from: Central Pacific Basin Tropical Cyclones

<pre>000
WTPA41 PHFO 270831
TCDCP1
 
Tropical Depression One-C Discussion Number   1
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 PM HST Sat Jul 26 2025

Deep convection has persisted over the area of low pressure well 
southeast of the Hawaiian Islands for the last 12 hours or so, with 
the latest satellite images showing improved organization and a 
better defined banding structure.  The latest subjective Dvorak 
current intensity estimates came in at 2.0/30 knots from PHFO, 
1.5/25 knots from SAB, and 1.0/25 knots from JTWC.  A recent 
27/0620Z Metop-B ASCAT pass showed a well-defined low-level 
circulation with a large swath of 25-knot winds and a few embedded 
25- to 30-knot wind barbs.  Given the improved structure and 
organization of the system, advisories are being initiated on the 
first tropical cyclone of the season in the central Pacific, 
Tropical Depression One-C.  The initial intensity will be set at 30 
knots.

Tropical Depression One-C is moving toward the west, or 270 degrees, 
at 10 knots.  This general westward motion is expected to continue 
over the next couple of days as the system moves along the southern 
periphery of a subtropical ridge to the north.  Beyond 48 hours, the 
forward speed is expected to increase considerably in response to a 
low- to mid-level ridge strengthening to the north of cyclone.  The 
track forecast closely follows a blend of the TVCE and HCCA 
consensus guidance.

The environment will remain conducive for intensification over the 
next couple of days, as One-C remains over warm waters between 28 
and 29C, with adequate mid-level moisture and light to moderate 
easterly shear.  As a result, the intensity forecast calls for 
steady strengthening during this time, with One-C becoming Tropical 
Storm Iona on Sunday.  Beyond 60 hours, the cyclone will begin to 
experience increasing westerly vertical wind shear while also 
entraining drier mid-level air.  This is expected to lead to steady 
weakening, with the system becoming a tropical depression again 
around day 5.  The intensity forecast is best aligned with the HCCA 
intensity consensus guidance.
