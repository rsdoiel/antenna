America</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-04, updated: 2025-06-04, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>(AP) — The history of Chinese immigrants in America has always been
about much more than one particular ethnic group. As Michael Luo’s
“Strangers in the Land: Exclusion, Belonging and the Epic Story of the
Chinese in America” demonstrates, understanding America’s efforts to
keep Chinese laborers out, and the violence enacted against those who
stayed in, is essential to understanding the evolution of America’s
immigration system as we know it today.</p>

record-breaking Memorial Day weekend. Theaters in the U.S. and Canada
had several new films to offer this weekend as well, including Sony’s
family friendly “Karate Kid: Legends” and the A24 horror movie “Bring
Her Back.” According to studio estimates Sunday, it added up to a robust
$149 million post-holiday weekend that’s up over 120% from the same
timeframe last year.</p>
