## PRIME: #Period

date: 2025-03-15, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)

Social media led Annie Wong into an unexpected world of crimson-tinged activism.

## Second Take: Regardless of gender, Oscars should respect nominated acts’ sexual autonomy

date: 2025-03-15, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)

Editor&#8217;s note: This article includes a mention of rape that may be disturbing to some readers.
