id="o2-dependent-incapacitation-of-the-salmonella-pathogenicity-island-1-repressor-hile">O2-dependent
incapacitation of the Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 repressor
HilE</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>For successful colonization, pathogenic bacteria need to adapt their
metabolism and virulence functions to challenging environments within
their mammalian hosts that are frequently characterized by low oxygen
(O2) tensions. Upon oral ingestion, the human pathogen Salmonella
enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) is exposed to changing O2
and pH levels. Low concentrations of O2, which can enhance the virulence
of enteroinvasive pathogens, facilitate the expression of the type three
secretion system (T3SS-1) encoded by the Salmonella pathogenicity island
1 (SPI-1) that is critical for enteroinvasion and pathogenicity of S.
Typhimurium. To study the impact of key environmental cues of the
intestine when Salmonella encounter enterocytes, we established an in
vitro growth model, which allows shifting the concentration of O2 from
0.5% to 11% and the pH from 5.9 to 7.4 in the presence of acetate and
the alternative electron acceptor nitrate. Compared to normoxia, hypoxia
elevated the expression of SPI-1 genes encoding T3SS-1 translocators and
effectors, which resulted in higher invasion and effector translocation
in epithelial cells. While hypoxia and pH shift only marginally altered
the gene expression of SPI-1 regulators, including the SPI-1 repressor
hilE, hypoxia and pH shift completely incapacitated HilE in a
post-translational manner, ultimately promoting SPI-1 activity. From
these findings, we conclude that O2-dependent HilE function allows for
ultrasensitive adaptation of SPI-1 activity in environments with varying
O2 availability such as the intestinal tract.</p>

application of targeted next-generation sequencing in pneumonia
diagnosis among cancer patients</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundCancer patients are highly susceptible to infections due to
their immunocompromised state from both the malignancy and intensive
treatments. Accurate and timely identification of causative pathogens is
crucial for effective management and treatment. Targeted next-generation
sequencing (tNGS) has become an important tool in clinical infectious
disease diagnosis because of its broad microbial detection range and
acceptable cost. However, there is currently a lack of systematic
research to evaluate the diagnostic value of this method in cancer
patients.MethodsTo evaluate the diagnostic value of tNGS for cancer
patients with pneumonia, a retrospective analysis was conducted on 148
patients with suspected pneumonia who were treated at the Henan Cancer
Hospital. The tNGS results were compared with conventional
microbiological tests (CMT) and clinical diagnoses based on symptoms and
imaging studies to assess the diagnostic performance of tNGS in cancer
patients with pneumonia.ResultsAmong these 148 patients, 130 were
ultimately diagnosed with pneumonia. tNGS demonstrated significantly
higher sensitivity (84.62% vs. 56.92%) and diagnostic accuracy (85.81%
vs. 62.16%) compared to the CMT method. The tNGS method identified more
pathogens than CMT method (87.50% vs 57.14%), regardless of whether they
were bacteria, fungi, or viruses, primarily due to its broader pathogen
detection range and higher sensitivity compared to the CMT method. tNGS
had significantly higher diagnostic accuracy for Pneumocystis jirovecii
and Legionella pneumophila than the CMT method, but for most pathogens,
tNGS showed higher sensitivity but with a correspondingly lower
specificity compared to CMT.ConclusiontNGS demonstrates higher
sensitivity and a broader pathogen detection spectrum compared to CMT,
making it a valuable diagnostic tool for managing pneumonia in cancer
patients.</p>

obesity affect the diagnostic value of various biomarkers for
periprosthetic joint infections? A single center retrospective
study</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to examine the impact of obesity
on the diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infections (PJI) by assessing
the levels and diagnostic efficacy of biomarkers.MethodsA total of 254
patients were divided into obese group (n=59) and non-obese group
(n=195) according to BMI. Each group was further divided into the PJI
group and the AF group. Data on CRP, ESR, fibrinogen, D-dimer,
CRP-albumin ratio (CAR), CRP-lymphocyte ratio (CLR), and CRP-monocyte
ratio (CMR) were collected from all patients. ROC curve was performed to
evaluate the diagnostic values of these biomarkers.ResultsThe levels of
biomarkers were significantly higher in PJI patients compared to the AF
patients in both the obese and non-obese groups (P &lt; 0.001), but the
levels of biomarkers were similar between the obese and non-obese
groups. In the obese group, CRP exhibited the highest diagnostic value
(AUC=0.982). In the non-obese group, CAR demonstrated the highest
diagnostic value (AUC =0.935). Subgroup analysis showed no significant
differences in biomarker levels (P &gt; 0.05).ConclusionsObesity did not
affect biomarker levels in patients with PJI. But for obese patients,
the diagnostic thresholds for CRP and ESR are higher, and clinical
diagnosis should be careful to avoid false positives. CRP and CAR were
identified as the most effective biomarkers for diagnosing PJI in the
obese and non-obese groups, respectively.</p>

profiles of molecular types, antibiotic resistance, antibiotic
resistance genes, and virulence genes of Staphylococcus aureus isolates
from caprine mastitis in China</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Staphylococcus aureus is a significant pathogen in dairy animals,
particularly when it infects the mammary gland; however, its prevalence
among dairy goats in China remains poorly understood. This study aimed
to investigate the distribution and characteristics of S. aureus
isolates in dairy goats across China. A total of 515 milk samples were
collected from goats diagnosed with mastitis in 14 provinces. These
samples underwent bacterial isolation and identification, capsular
polysaccharides typing, spa typing, antimicrobial susceptibility
testing, and assessment of antimicrobial resistance and virulence gene.
The findings revealed the isolation of 61 S. aureus strains. The highest
prevalence rate was recorded in 2018, at 20.4% (11 out of 54 samples),
while the lowest prevalence rate was noted in 2023, at 5.2% (3 out of 58
samples). Among the five regions studied, southern China exhibited the
highest prevalence rate of 17.5% (10 out of 57 samples), whereas
northeastern China showed the lowest rate at 8.2% (8 out of 97 samples).
Capsular polysaccharide type 5 emerged as the most prevalent, accounting
for 52.5%, and spa type t521 was identified most frequently, at 19.7%.
Notably, 52 isolates (85.2%) demonstrated multidrug resistance,
displaying resistance to three or more antibiotics. The resistance rates
of S. aureus isolates were significantly high to penicillin (95.1%),
followed by enrofloxacin (82.0%), kanamycin (78.7%), and levofloxacin
(77.0%). Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole exhibited the lowest resistance
rate at 11.5%. Resistance rates varied across the five different
regions. Additionally, eight genes associated with resistance to six
classes of antimicrobials were detected, with the blaZ gene (93.4%)
being the most prevalent at 93.4%. Furthermore, nine
virulence-associated genes were identified, with clfA being the most
common virulence gene, present in all isolates. In conclusion, most S.
aureus isolates were multiresistant with diverse resistance patterns.
Those diverse antimicrobial resistance profiles associated with
corresponding resistance genes (p &lt; 0.05) were reported for the first
time in S. aureus from caprine mastitis. Sulfonamides could be
prioritized preferentially for the treatment of S. aureus mastitis.</p>

Qingyi Huoxue granule ameliorates severe acute pancreatitis by
modulating gut microbiota and repairing the intestinal mucosal
barrier</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundDuring severe acute pancreatitis (SAP), damage to the
intestinal mucosal barrier and translocation of intestinal pathogenic
bacteria are key mechanisms that accelerate the disease progression of
SAP. Chaihuang Qingyi Huoxue Granule (CH) is a herbal formula used in
the clinical treatment of SAP. This study aims to investigate the role
of CH in regulating gut microbiota and intestinal mucosal barrier in SAP
rats.MethodsSodium taurocholate (3.5%) was retrogradely perfused into
the biliopancreatic duct to establish the model of SAP in rats. CH (4.4
g/kg) was administered by gavage. Serum amylase, lipase, and endotoxin
levels were measured. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining was used to
observe morphological changes in the pancreas and colon. The expression
of zona occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin in the colon was examined by
immunohistochemistry (IHC) and western blot. 16S rDNA gene sequencing
was used to analyze the gut microbiota of the rats. The content of
short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in the intestinal contents of the rats
was determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).ResultsCH
reduced serum amylase, lipase, and endotoxin levels in SAP rats,
alleviated pathological damage in the pancreas and colon, and restored
the expression of ZO-1 and occludin. Moreover, CH alleviated gut
microbiota dysbiosis in SAP rats, with restored gut microbiota diversity
and structure. At the phylum level, the relative abundance of Firmicutes
and Bacteroidetes increased, while that of Proteobacteria decreased. At
the genus level, the abundance of Ruminococcus 1, Parabacteroides,
Prevotellaceae UCG-001, Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 group, and Lactobacillus
increased, while that of Escherichia-Shigella, Enterococcus, and
Enterobacter decreased. In addition, CH increased the levels of SCFAs in
the intestinal contents of SAP rats.ConclusionCH ameliorates SAP by
maintaining the homeostasis and diversity of the gut microbiota,
increasing the levels of SCFAs, and repairing the intestinal mucosal
barrier.</p>

model for predicting bacteremia species based on host immune
response</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionClinicians encounter significant challenges in quickly
and accurately identifying the bacterial species responsible for patient
bacteremia and in selecting appropriate antibiotics for timely
treatment. This study introduces a novel approach that combines immune
response data from routine blood counts with assessments of immune cell
activation, specifically through quantitative measurements of Rho family
GTPase activity. The combined data were used to develop a
machine-learning model capable of distinguishing specific classes of
bacteria and their associations.MethodsWe aimed to determine whether
different classes of bacteria elicit distinct patterns of host immune
responses, as indicated by quantitative differences in leukocyte
populations from routine complete blood counts with differential.
Concurrently, we conducted quantitative measurements of activated Rac1
(Rac1•GTP) levels using a novel ‘G-Trap assay’ we developed. With the
G-Trap, we measured Rac1•GTP in peripheral blood monocytes (PBMC) and
polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells from blood samples collected from 28
culture-positive patients and over 80 non-infected patients used as
controls.ResultsOur findings indicated that 18 of the 28 patients with
bacteremia showed an increase of ≥ 3-fold in Rac1•GTP levels compared to
the controls. The remaining ten patients with bacteremia exhibited
either neutrophilia or pancytopenia and displayed normal to below-normal
Rac1 GTPase activity, which is consistent with bacteria-induced
immunosuppression. To analyze the data, we employed partial least
squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), a supervised method that
optimizes group separation and aids in building a novel machine-learning
model for pathogen identification.DiscussionThe results demonstrated
that PLS-DA effectively differentiates between specific pathogen groups,
and external validation confirmed the predictive model’s utility. Given
that bacterial culture confirmation may take several days, our study
underscores the potential of combining routine assays with a
machine-learning model as a valuable clinical decision-support tool.
This approach could enable prompt and accurate treatment on the same day
that patients present to the clinic.</p>

DosR regulon of Mycobacterium avium and adaptation to hypoxia</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Like other tuberculous and nontuberculous mycobacterial pathogens of
human lung such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and M. abscessus, M. avium
is likely exposed to a variety of stressors during infection, including
hypoxic conditions inside activated macrophages and in the avascular
necrotic regions of granulomas. How M. avium survives hypoxic stress to
establish a chronic infection is currently not well understood. Using
RNA-sequencing, we here show that M. avium grown under progressive
microaerophilic conditions activates more than 4-fold a subset of 16
genes, the expression of 13 of which is dependent on the two-component
system regulator DosRS. A subset of M. avium DosR regulon genes was
confirmed to also be activated upon exposure to nitric oxide. Although a
second sensor kinase besides DosS has been proposed to function with the
transcriptional regulator DosR in M. avium, we show that this other
kinase cannot compensate for a deficiency in DosS. Loss of dosRS
expression in M. avium led to a significant reduction in viability under
hypoxia that was more marked at acidic than at neutral pH. Unlike the
situation in M. abscessus, however, loss of DosRS did not significantly
impact the ability of M. avium to establish a drug tolerant state in
vitro or form biofilms under host relevant conditions. Collectively,
these results are suggestive of a lesser impact of DosRS on the ability
of M. avium to develop antibiotic tolerance compared to other
nontuberculous mycobacteria. The M. avium dosRS mutant further showed no
signs of virulence attenuation in murine macrophages and in chronically
infected immunocompetent BALB/c mice.</p>

of microphysiological systems to unravel the mechanisms of
schistosomiasis egg extravasation</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Despite decades of control efforts, the prevalence of schistosomiasis
remains high in many endemic regions, posing significant challenges to
global health. One of the key factors contributing to the persistence of
the disease is the complex life cycle of the Schistosoma parasite, the
causative agent, which involves multiple stages of development and
intricate interactions with its mammalian hosts and snails. Among the
various stages of the parasite lifecycle, the deposition of eggs and
their migration through host tissues is significant, as they initiate
the onset of the disease pathology by inducing inflammatory reactions
and tissue damage. However, our understanding of the mechanisms
underlying Schistosoma egg extravasation remains limited, hindering
efforts to develop effective interventions. Microphysiological systems,
particularly organ-on-a-chip systems, offer a promising approach to
study this phenomenon in a controlled experimental setting because they
allow the replication of physiological microenvironments in vitro. This
review provides an overview of schistosomiasis, introduces the concept
of organ-on-a-chip technology, and discusses its potential applications
in the field of schistosomiasis research.</p>

of metabolic parameters, antioxidant capacity, and gut microbiota in
response to substitution of ferrous sulfate with iron hydroxy methionine
analog chelate in weaned piglets</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionPrevious studies have suggested that dietary organic iron
offers health advantages compared to its inorganic counterpart. However,
the effects of iron hydroxy methionine analog chelate (Fe-HMA)
supplementation in weaned piglets have not been fully explored.
Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of replacing
ferrous sulfate with Fe-HMA as the iron source on serum biochemistry,
antioxidant capacity, and gut microbiota in weaned piglets.MethodsOne
hundred and twenty weaned piglets were randomly allocated to two
treatment groups. Each group contained four replicates, with 15 pigs per
replicate. Piglets were fed either 100 mg Fe/kg in the form of ferrous
sulfate (Fe-sulfate group) or 50 mg Fe/kg in the form of Fe-HMA (Fe-HMA
group) as the iron source for 28 days.Results and discussionResults
showed that supplementing Fe-HMA as an iron source significantly
increased the levels of triglycerides and glucose in portal venous
serum, albumin in both serum and portal venous serum and decreased serum
low-density lipoprotein level in weaned piglets. Additionally, Fe-HMA
supplementation significantly reduced serum and liver malondialdehyde
levels, while increasing catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase
(GSH-Px), total superoxide dismutase, and manganese superoxide dismutase
levels in serum, as well as GSH-Px and CAT levels in the liver.
Moreover, Fe-HMA regulated the intestinal microbiota composition,
notably increasing the relative abundance of Proteobacteria and
decreasing microbes involved in aromatic_compound_degradation. In
conclusion, dietary replacing inorganic iron with Fe-HMA improved
metabolic parameters and antioxidant capacity, and regulated gut
microbiota composition in weaned piglets.</p>

<p>date: 2025-02-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Female health and the microbiota of the reproductive tract are
closely associated. The research scope on reproductive tract microbiota
extends from the vaginal to the upper reproductive tract and from
infectious diseases to various benign and malignant gynecological and
obstetrical diseases. The primary focus of this paper was to evaluate
the most recent findings about the role of reproductive tract microbiota
in gynecological diseases, including endometrial polyps, uterine
fibroids, endometriosis, adenomyosis, endometrial hyperplasia, and
endometrial carcinoma. Different stages of gynecological diseases have
diverse microbiota in the female reproductive tract, and some specific
bacteria may help the disease progress. For example, Fusobacterium may
exacerbate endometriosis, while treatments that target microbiota, such
as antibiotics, probiotics, and flora transplantation, showed some
efficacy in the experiment. These findings indicate the wonderful
prospect of this field. Additionally, we have discussed how microbiome
research can improve our understanding of the interactions between
reproductive tract microorganisms and hosts, aid in the screening and
diagnosis of gynecological diseases, and direct the development of
preventive and therapeutic strategies aimed at maintaining and restoring
a healthy reproductive tract microbiota when combined with other
technologies like transcriptome and proteome, in vitro cultured cells,
and animal models.</p>

insights into BMI-related intratumoral microbiota in gastric cancer</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionBody mass index (BMI) is considered an important factor
in tumor prognosis, but its role in gastric cancer (GC) remains
controversial. There is a lack of studies exploring the effect of BMI on
gastric cancer from the perspective of intratumoral microbiota. This
study aimed to compare and analyze the differences in and functions of
intratumoral microbiota among GC patients with varying BMIs, aiming to
ascertain whether specific microbial features are associated with
prognosis in low-BMI (LBMI) gastric cancer patients.MethodsA
retrospective analysis of the clinicopathological features and prognosis
of 5567 patients with different BMIs was performed between January 2010
and December 2019. Tumor tissues from 189 GC patients were collected for
16S rRNA sequencing, 64 samples were selected for transcriptome
sequencing, and 57 samples were selected for untargeted metabolomic
analysis.ResultsClinical cohort analysis revealed that GC patients with
a low BMI presented poorer clinical and pathological characteristics
than those with a non-low-BMI (NLBMI). LBMI was identified as a
significant independent risk factor for adverse prognosis, potentially
exerting immunosuppressive effects on postoperative adjuvant
chemotherapy. 16S rRNA sequencing revealed no significant differences in
the alpha and beta diversity of the intratumoral microbiota between the
two groups of GC patients. However, LEfSe analysis revealed 32
differential intratumoral microbiota between the LBMI and NLBMI groups.
Notably, the genus Abiotrophia was significantly enriched in the LBMI
group. Further in-depth analysis indicated that the genus Abiotrophia
was inversely associated with eosinophils, P2RY12, and SCN4B genes, and
positively linked with LGR6 in LBMI gastric cancer patients. Metabolomic
assessments revealed that LBMI was positively associated with purine
metabolites, specifically guanine and inosine diphosphate
(IDP).DiscussionIn conclusion, LBMI is an independent risk factor for
poor prognosis in gastric cancer patients and may have an inhibitory
effect on postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. Intratumor flora of
gastric cancer patients with different BMI levels differed, with
different immune cell infiltration and metabolic characteristics. The
genus Abiotrophia may promote gastric cancer development and progression
by regulating eosinophils and the purine metabolism pathway, which
provides a new idea for the precise treatment of gastric cancer.</p>

baumannii bloodstream infections: a study of sequence types, capsular
types, and drug resistance in China</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundBloodstream infections (BSIs) caused by Acinetobacter
baumannii have been associated with high mortality. To improve the
outcomes of patients, this study explored the clinical characteristics
and outcomes of patients with BSIs, as well as the phenotypic and
genomic characteristics of these isolates.MethodsA retrospective cohort
study was conducted involving A. baumannii BSIs cases from 2020 to 2023
in a tertiary hospital. The clinical characteristics of all A. baumannii
isolates were evaluated. Virulence phenotypes of all isolates were
evaluated using the growth curve, biofilm-forming assay, antiserum
complement killing, and G.mellonella killing assay. Furthermore,
whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was utilized to analyze genomic
characteristics.ResultsThe 30-day mortality rate of 67 patients with
BSIs was 55.22%. Patients in the death group had significantly lower
platelet counts and higher CRP levels than those in the survival group.
Additionally, higher rates of antibiotic use (≥2 classes) and greater
carbapenem exposure were observed. Among the isolates, CRAb accounted
for 80.6%, ST2 accounted for 76.12%, and KL2/3/7/77/160 accounted for
65.67%. The predominant KL type was KL3, found in 19.4% of the isolates.
All ST2 and KL2/3/7/77/160 isolates were CRAb. Among the isolates, 90.7%
of the CRAb isolates coharbored blaOXA-23 and blaOXA-66, while one
coharbored blaNDM-1 and blaOXA-23. Compared with non-ST2 and non
KL2/3/7/77/160 infections, ST2 and KL2/3/7/77/160 infections had higher
mortality rates (66.0% vs. 23.5%, P=0.002; 65.90% vs. 34.78%, P=0.015).
Patients with ST2 and KL2/3/7/77/160 infections underwent more invasive
procedures, received two or more antibiotics and carbapenem therapy
before isolation, and had lower serum albumin levels. These isolates
exhibited significantly higher resistance to antimicrobial agents. No
significant differences in virulence phenotypes were observed between
the two groups, except for biofilm formation between the ST2 and non-ST2
groups (P=0.002). However, these isolates harbored more virulence genes
related to iron uptake and biofilm formation.ConclusionThe mortality
rate associated with BSIs caused by A. baumannii is high. It is of great
significance for clinicians to pay attention to the risk factors of the
clinical characteristics of patients and to identify the ST and KL types
of the strains causing the infection at an early stage.</p>

virulence of the microsporidian parasite in honey bees competing
habitat</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>In natural ecosystems, parasites often infect multiple host species,
particularly when hosts share habitats, facilitating host-to-host
transmission and altering traditional host-parasite coevolution
dynamics. This study examines the microsporidian parasite Nosema ceranae
in Eastern honey bees (Apis cerana) and Western honey bees (Apis
mellifera), assessing its virulence and proliferation dynamics. Using
inoculation experiments, we measured bee mortality and parasite spore
loads to infer virulence and proliferation. Additionally, time-series
transcriptome analysis of both bees and parasites provide insights into
host-pathogen interactions. The results reveal that N. ceranae produces
more spores with lower mortality in A. mellifera but causes higher
mortality with lower spore production in A. cerana. The parasite also
suppresses host gene expression, with stronger suppression observed in
A. cerana. These findings suggest that N. ceranae is adapted for low
virulence and high proliferation in A. mellifera but exhibits high
virulence and limited proliferation in A. cerana. This study highlights
the evolution of distinct trade-offs between virulence and proliferation
in a multi-host system, offering valuable insights into parasite-host
dynamics and their ecological implications.</p>

structure in healthy and pregnant women and importance of vaginal
dysbiosis in spontaneous abortion</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The vaginal microbiome of healthy women is dominated by Lactobacillus
spp. A variety of illnesses, such as vaginosis, sexually transmitted
infections (STIs), failed implantation, premature birth (PTB), and
preterm pre-labor membrane rupture, are brought on by an unbalanced
microbiota. Pregnancy is associated with a decrease in the metabolic
capacity of the vaginal resident microbiome, which is consistent with a
change to a less complex Lactobacillus-dominated microbiome. Age, race,
sexual intercourse, smoking, IUD, contraception, lifestyle, and diet all
affect the makeup of the vaginal microbiome. Moreover, physiological
events including menarche, the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, menopause,
and other hormonal changes have an impact on the vaginal microbiome. The
vaginal microbiome is significantly disrupted by the menstrual cycle,
with significant changes toward a more varied microbiota occurring
around menstruation. Several major factors maintain or disrupt the
vaginal microbiome including ethnic group, menstruation cycle, and
pregnancy which are discussed in this section. In the index pregnancy,
the vaginal microbiota of women who had already given birth, or had just
experienced an induced or spontaneous abortion, was qualitatively and
quantitatively different from that of women who were having their first
child. Early pregnancy vaginal microbiome depletion is a risk factor for
early pregnancy miscarriage. Although, early pregnancy miscarriage is
not always caused by a high bacterial diversity and quantity of
lactobacilli. Lactobacillus protects against pathogens through the
production of antibacterial compounds such as lactic acid and
bacteriocins.</p>

reveals comparable patterns in the transmission intensities of
Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax in Langkat district, North
Sumatera Province, Indonesia</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThe incidence of malaria in Indonesia has declined
significantly over the last few decades. Thus, a demand for more
sensitive techniques to describe low levels of transmission in the
country is important. This study was conducted to evaluate antibody
response to Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax in an area
nearing elimination in North Sumatera Province, Indonesia.MethodsA
cross-sectional survey was conducted in Langkat district, North Sumatera
Province, in June 2019. Basic demographic data and filter paper blood
spots were collected from 339 participants. Antibody responses to two
P. falciparum (PfAMA-1 and PfMSP-119) and two P. vivax (PvAMA-1 and
PvMSP-119) antigens were measured using indirect enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Seroconversion rates (SCR) were estimated
by fitting a simple reversible catalytic model to seroprevalence data
for each antibody. Multiple logistic regression was used to investigate
factors associated with exposure.ResultsThe overall malaria
seroprevalence was 10.6% for PfAMA-1, 13% for PfMSP-119, 18.6% for
PvAMA-1, and 7.4% for PvMSP-119. Seropositive individuals for P.
falciparum (PfAMA-1/PfMSP-119) and P. vivax (PvAMA-1/PvMSP-119) were
similar at 20.7%, with no significant differences observed between age
groups (p &gt; 0.05). Based on the reversible catalytic model, the
calculated SCRs indicated a higher level of P. falciparum transmission
than P. vivax using all tested antigens. In the adjusted model, only
spending nights in the forest was associated with P. vivax
seropositivity (odd ratio: 3.93, p &lt; 0.001).ConclusionThe analysis of
community-based serological data helps describe the similar levels of P.
falciparum and P. vivax transmission in the Langkat district. The use of
a serological approach enhances the detection of past exposure, aiding
in the identification of epidemiological risk factors and malaria
surveillance in low transmission settings in Indonesia.</p>

memory to COVID-19 vaccines in immunocompromised and immunocompetent
children</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundMost children in Argentina received only the initial
COVID-19 vaccine series, with presumed hybrid immunity after multiple
Omicron waves. However, the durability of immune memory, particularly in
immunocompromised (IC) children, remains poorly studied.MethodsA cohort
of IC (n=45) and healthy children (HC, n=79) was assessed between 13 to
17 months after receiving two or three doses of BBIBP-CorV and/or
BNT162b2. Plasma anti-spike IgG, neutralizing activity and
antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells against Wuhan and Omicron BA.5
variants were assessed.ResultsMost children remained seropositive after
two vaccine doses, but compared with HC, IC exhibited lower neutralizing
titers against both Wuhan and Omicron BA.5, particularly those
vaccinated with BBIBP-CorV. Even after three vaccine doses, IC showed
weaker neutralizing antibody response, CD8+ T cell responses and lower
IFN-γ production compared with HC. Integrated analysis of neutralizing
antibodies, memory CD4+, and CD8+ T cells revealed a weak immune memory
among IC with an important compromise in memory CD8+ T cell
responses.ConclusionsImmunity can last up to 17 months, but reduced
effectiveness against new variants highlights the need for updated
COVID-19 vaccines, especially for IC children. Additional efforts are
essential to enhance vaccination coverage and protect this vulnerable
population.</p>

adhesin genotype characteristics of Mycoplasma pneumoniae in China from
2017 to 2019</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionMycoplasma pneumoniae is one of the important pathogens
of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and P1 adhesin serves as a
pathogenic protein and an immune protein involved in the pathogenesis of
mycoplasma pneumoniae. The aim of this study was to investigate the P1
adhesin genotype in Mycoplasma pneumoniae and its association with
disease severity in patients with CAP from 2017 to 2019.MethodsM.
pneumoniae was identified in patient samples by real-time quantitative
polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The P1 genotypes of samples were
determined using a culture-independent P1 typing method.ResultsIn total,
1,907 clinical samples were collected from 13 tertiary hospitals in
Beijing, Shenyang, and Baotou, including 1488 samples from children and
419 from adults. Of these, 820 samples (43.00%), including 777 from
children and 43 from adults, were positive for M. pneumoniae. 797
samples were successfully typed using the culture-independent P1 typing
method (P1-1, 605; P1- 2, 192). The M. pneumoniae detection rate and
P1-1 detection rate differed significantly between children and adults
(both p &lt; 0.01), with P1-1 remaining the dominant genotype. The
proportion of P1-2 samples increased in children from 16.75% in 2017 to
28.76% in 2019.DiscussionNo relationship between the P1 genotype and
disease severity was identified. Monitoring the genotype changes of P1
adhesin in local populations may positively impact the epidemiological
prevention and control of M. pneumoniae infections.</p>

mutation accumulation in DNA repair-deficient Listeria monocytogenes:
implications for cgMLST cluster thresholds in outbreak analysis</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundListeria (L.) monocytogenes is primarily transmitted via
contaminated food and can cause listeriosis, an infection often
associated with sepsis and meningitis in at-risk individuals. Accurate
outbreak detection relies on whole genome sequencing (WGS) and core
genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST), which use allele thresholds
to identify related strains.MethodsThis study investigated mutation
rates in L. monocytogenes, focusing on isolates with DNA repair
deficiencies. Serial subcultivations were performed, comparing a
repair-deficient isolate with a wild-type control. Genetic variability
was assessed using WGS and cgMLST.ResultsMutation rates were
significantly higher in repair-deficient isolates, exceeding typical
cgMLST thresholds currently used in Listeria outbreak investigations,
leading to a misclassification of related isolates as unrelated. An
additional analysis of the Austrian Listeria database revealed that such
deficiencies are rare among isolates.ConclusionsThe standard 7-allele
cgMLST threshold effectively identifies related strains in most cases,
but may require adjustments for hypermutator strains. Incorporating DNA
repair data could improve the accuracy of outbreak investigations,
ensuring reliable public health responses.</p>
