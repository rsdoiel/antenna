the clinical outcomes and molecular characteristics of Acinetobacter
baumannii bloodstream infections: a study of sequence types, capsular
types, and drug resistance in China</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundBloodstream infections (BSIs) caused by Acinetobacter
baumannii have been associated with high mortality. To improve the
outcomes of patients, this study explored the clinical characteristics
and outcomes of patients with BSIs, as well as the phenotypic and
genomic characteristics of these isolates.MethodsA retrospective cohort
study was conducted involving A. baumannii BSIs cases from 2020 to 2023
in a tertiary hospital. The clinical characteristics of all A. baumannii
isolates were evaluated. Virulence phenotypes of all isolates were
evaluated using the growth curve, biofilm-forming assay, antiserum
complement killing, and G.mellonella killing assay. Furthermore,
whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was utilized to analyze genomic
characteristics.ResultsThe 30-day mortality rate of 67 patients with
BSIs was 55.22%. Patients in the death group had significantly lower
platelet counts and higher CRP levels than those in the survival group.
Additionally, higher rates of antibiotic use (≥2 classes) and greater
carbapenem exposure were observed. Among the isolates, CRAb accounted
for 80.6%, ST2 accounted for 76.12%, and KL2/3/7/77/160 accounted for
65.67%. The predominant KL type was KL3, found in 19.4% of the isolates.
All ST2 and KL2/3/7/77/160 isolates were CRAb. Among the isolates, 90.7%
of the CRAb isolates coharbored blaOXA-23 and blaOXA-66, while one
coharbored blaNDM-1 and blaOXA-23. Compared with non-ST2 and non
KL2/3/7/77/160 infections, ST2 and KL2/3/7/77/160 infections had higher
mortality rates (66.0% vs. 23.5%, P=0.002; 65.90% vs. 34.78%, P=0.015).
Patients with ST2 and KL2/3/7/77/160 infections underwent more invasive
procedures, received two or more antibiotics and carbapenem therapy
before isolation, and had lower serum albumin levels. These isolates
exhibited significantly higher resistance to antimicrobial agents. No
significant differences in virulence phenotypes were observed between
the two groups, except for biofilm formation between the ST2 and non-ST2
groups (P=0.002). However, these isolates harbored more virulence genes
related to iron uptake and biofilm formation.ConclusionThe mortality
rate associated with BSIs caused by A. baumannii is high. It is of great
significance for clinicians to pay attention to the risk factors of the
clinical characteristics of patients and to identify the ST and KL types
of the strains causing the infection at an early stage.</p>

virulence of the microsporidian parasite in honey bees competing
habitat</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>In natural ecosystems, parasites often infect multiple host species,
particularly when hosts share habitats, facilitating host-to-host
transmission and altering traditional host-parasite coevolution
dynamics. This study examines the microsporidian parasite Nosema ceranae
in Eastern honey bees (Apis cerana) and Western honey bees (Apis
mellifera), assessing its virulence and proliferation dynamics. Using
inoculation experiments, we measured bee mortality and parasite spore
loads to infer virulence and proliferation. Additionally, time-series
transcriptome analysis of both bees and parasites provide insights into
host-pathogen interactions. The results reveal that N. ceranae produces
more spores with lower mortality in A. mellifera but causes higher
mortality with lower spore production in A. cerana. The parasite also
suppresses host gene expression, with stronger suppression observed in
A. cerana. These findings suggest that N. ceranae is adapted for low
virulence and high proliferation in A. mellifera but exhibits high
virulence and limited proliferation in A. cerana. This study highlights
the evolution of distinct trade-offs between virulence and proliferation
in a multi-host system, offering valuable insights into parasite-host
dynamics and their ecological implications.</p>

structure in healthy and pregnant women and importance of vaginal
dysbiosis in spontaneous abortion</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The vaginal microbiome of healthy women is dominated by Lactobacillus
spp. A variety of illnesses, such as vaginosis, sexually transmitted
infections (STIs), failed implantation, premature birth (PTB), and
preterm pre-labor membrane rupture, are brought on by an unbalanced
microbiota. Pregnancy is associated with a decrease in the metabolic
capacity of the vaginal resident microbiome, which is consistent with a
change to a less complex Lactobacillus-dominated microbiome. Age, race,
sexual intercourse, smoking, IUD, contraception, lifestyle, and diet all
affect the makeup of the vaginal microbiome. Moreover, physiological
events including menarche, the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, menopause,
and other hormonal changes have an impact on the vaginal microbiome. The
vaginal microbiome is significantly disrupted by the menstrual cycle,
with significant changes toward a more varied microbiota occurring
around menstruation. Several major factors maintain or disrupt the
vaginal microbiome including ethnic group, menstruation cycle, and
pregnancy which are discussed in this section. In the index pregnancy,
the vaginal microbiota of women who had already given birth, or had just
experienced an induced or spontaneous abortion, was qualitatively and
quantitatively different from that of women who were having their first
child. Early pregnancy vaginal microbiome depletion is a risk factor for
early pregnancy miscarriage. Although, early pregnancy miscarriage is
not always caused by a high bacterial diversity and quantity of
lactobacilli. Lactobacillus protects against pathogens through the
production of antibacterial compounds such as lactic acid and
bacteriocins.</p>

reveals comparable patterns in the transmission intensities of
Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax in Langkat district, North
Sumatera Province, Indonesia</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThe incidence of malaria in Indonesia has declined
significantly over the last few decades. Thus, a demand for more
sensitive techniques to describe low levels of transmission in the
country is important. This study was conducted to evaluate antibody
response to Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax in an area
nearing elimination in North Sumatera Province, Indonesia.MethodsA
cross-sectional survey was conducted in Langkat district, North Sumatera
Province, in June 2019. Basic demographic data and filter paper blood
spots were collected from 339 participants. Antibody responses to two
P. falciparum (PfAMA-1 and PfMSP-119) and two P. vivax (PvAMA-1 and
PvMSP-119) antigens were measured using indirect enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Seroconversion rates (SCR) were estimated
by fitting a simple reversible catalytic model to seroprevalence data
for each antibody. Multiple logistic regression was used to investigate
factors associated with exposure.ResultsThe overall malaria
seroprevalence was 10.6% for PfAMA-1, 13% for PfMSP-119, 18.6% for
PvAMA-1, and 7.4% for PvMSP-119. Seropositive individuals for P.
falciparum (PfAMA-1/PfMSP-119) and P. vivax (PvAMA-1/PvMSP-119) were
similar at 20.7%, with no significant differences observed between age
groups (p &gt; 0.05). Based on the reversible catalytic model, the
calculated SCRs indicated a higher level of P. falciparum transmission
than P. vivax using all tested antigens. In the adjusted model, only
spending nights in the forest was associated with P. vivax
seropositivity (odd ratio: 3.93, p &lt; 0.001).ConclusionThe analysis of
community-based serological data helps describe the similar levels of P.
falciparum and P. vivax transmission in the Langkat district. The use of
a serological approach enhances the detection of past exposure, aiding
in the identification of epidemiological risk factors and malaria
surveillance in low transmission settings in Indonesia.</p>

memory to COVID-19 vaccines in immunocompromised and immunocompetent
children</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundMost children in Argentina received only the initial
COVID-19 vaccine series, with presumed hybrid immunity after multiple
Omicron waves. However, the durability of immune memory, particularly in
immunocompromised (IC) children, remains poorly studied.MethodsA cohort
of IC (n=45) and healthy children (HC, n=79) was assessed between 13 to
17 months after receiving two or three doses of BBIBP-CorV and/or
BNT162b2. Plasma anti-spike IgG, neutralizing activity and
antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells against Wuhan and Omicron BA.5
variants were assessed.ResultsMost children remained seropositive after
two vaccine doses, but compared with HC, IC exhibited lower neutralizing
titers against both Wuhan and Omicron BA.5, particularly those
vaccinated with BBIBP-CorV. Even after three vaccine doses, IC showed
weaker neutralizing antibody response, CD8+ T cell responses and lower
IFN-γ production compared with HC. Integrated analysis of neutralizing
antibodies, memory CD4+, and CD8+ T cells revealed a weak immune memory
among IC with an important compromise in memory CD8+ T cell
responses.ConclusionsImmunity can last up to 17 months, but reduced
effectiveness against new variants highlights the need for updated
COVID-19 vaccines, especially for IC children. Additional efforts are
essential to enhance vaccination coverage and protect this vulnerable
population.</p>

adhesin genotype characteristics of Mycoplasma pneumoniae in China from
2017 to 2019</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionMycoplasma pneumoniae is one of the important pathogens
of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and P1 adhesin serves as a
pathogenic protein and an immune protein involved in the pathogenesis of
mycoplasma pneumoniae. The aim of this study was to investigate the P1
adhesin genotype in Mycoplasma pneumoniae and its association with
disease severity in patients with CAP from 2017 to 2019.MethodsM.
pneumoniae was identified in patient samples by real-time quantitative
polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The P1 genotypes of samples were
determined using a culture-independent P1 typing method.ResultsIn total,
1,907 clinical samples were collected from 13 tertiary hospitals in
Beijing, Shenyang, and Baotou, including 1488 samples from children and
419 from adults. Of these, 820 samples (43.00%), including 777 from
children and 43 from adults, were positive for M. pneumoniae. 797
samples were successfully typed using the culture-independent P1 typing
method (P1-1, 605; P1- 2, 192). The M. pneumoniae detection rate and
P1-1 detection rate differed significantly between children and adults
(both p &lt; 0.01), with P1-1 remaining the dominant genotype. The
proportion of P1-2 samples increased in children from 16.75% in 2017 to
28.76% in 2019.DiscussionNo relationship between the P1 genotype and
disease severity was identified. Monitoring the genotype changes of P1
adhesin in local populations may positively impact the epidemiological
prevention and control of M. pneumoniae infections.</p>

mutation accumulation in DNA repair-deficient Listeria monocytogenes:
implications for cgMLST cluster thresholds in outbreak analysis</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundListeria (L.) monocytogenes is primarily transmitted via
contaminated food and can cause listeriosis, an infection often
associated with sepsis and meningitis in at-risk individuals. Accurate
outbreak detection relies on whole genome sequencing (WGS) and core
genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST), which use allele thresholds
to identify related strains.MethodsThis study investigated mutation
rates in L. monocytogenes, focusing on isolates with DNA repair
deficiencies. Serial subcultivations were performed, comparing a
repair-deficient isolate with a wild-type control. Genetic variability
was assessed using WGS and cgMLST.ResultsMutation rates were
significantly higher in repair-deficient isolates, exceeding typical
cgMLST thresholds currently used in Listeria outbreak investigations,
leading to a misclassification of related isolates as unrelated. An
additional analysis of the Austrian Listeria database revealed that such
deficiencies are rare among isolates.ConclusionsThe standard 7-allele
cgMLST threshold effectively identifies related strains in most cases,
but may require adjustments for hypermutator strains. Incorporating DNA
repair data could improve the accuracy of outbreak investigations,
ensuring reliable public health responses.</p>
