Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0738 AM CDT Mon Mar 31 2025

Valid 311300Z - 011200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE SOUTHEAST INTO THE CAROLINAS...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are expected to overspread much of the
Southeast into the Carolinas today, accompanied by swaths of
damaging to severe wind gusts and perhaps a few tornadoes.

...Synopsis...
A mid-level shortwave trough over the Great Lakes and southern
Ontario will race quickly northeastward into Quebec today, while
another low-amplitude perturbation moves from the Ozarks to the
eastern CONUS by this evening. The primary surface low will develop
northward into Quebec in tandem with the lead shortwave trough,
while a trailing cold front continues east-southeastward over much
of the Atlantic States and Southeast. Ahead of the front, a corridor
of low-level moisture will support the potential for surface-based
thunderstorms for much of the day.

...Southeast to the Carolinas...
Robust convection is ongoing this morning from southern LA to the
northern AL vicinity, along or ahead of the cold front. Although
there is some lingering/modest inhibition, weak to moderate
instability will likely be present ahead of the lines/clusters to
support a threat for mainly scattered severe/damaging winds across
the central Gulf Coast states this morning into the early afternoon.
While boundary-layer flow has veered and is fairly modest across
this area, there is sufficient low-level shear for some updraft
rotation. This may foster occasional line-embedded circulations and
a threat for a couple of tornadoes.

Mid-level lapse rates are forecast to be less steep with eastward
extent across GA into the Carolinas. Still, filtered diurnal heating
of the moist low-level airmass should foster at least weak
destabilization by early afternoon. Most guidance shows
re-invigoration of the convective line across the western Carolinas
by midday, with a potentially separate cluster persisting eastward
across GA as well. Even though MLCAPE is not forecast to be as
strong as locations farther west, it should still be sufficient in
tandem with strengthening low/mid-level southwesterly flow to
support scattered severe/damaging winds. The tornado potential is a
bit less clear, given generally veered/uni-directional low-level
flow limiting hodograph curvature. Even so, some threat for a few
embedded QLCS tornadoes may exist. 

...Mid-Atlantic to the Northeast...
Instability is expected to weaken with northward extent ahead of the
cold front across the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. Still, scattered
thunderstorms should develop this afternoon and spread
east-northeastward towards the coast through the evening. With
enhanced low/mid-level flow present in association with the lead
shortwave trough, some of this convection may pose a threat for
damaging winds and perhaps a tornado or two, before it eventually
moves offshore.

## SPC Mar 31, 2025 Day 4-8 Severe Weather Outlook

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0359 AM CDT Mon Mar 31 2025

Valid 031200Z - 081200Z

...DISCUSSION...
Active and progressive mid-level flow will persist across the CONUS
as a large upper trough moves from the Great Lakes into eastern
Canada. Several additional troughs, embedded within strong
west/southwesterly flow aloft, will move over the lower 48 through
the next week. Deep moisture and strong mid-level flow overlapping
will favor severe potential across the southern Plains, Mid MS/OH
Valleys and the Eastern CONUS through the extended forecast period.

...D4/Thursday...
As the primary upper trough departs to the northeast, the cold front
will stall across the OH/MS Valleys and into the southern Plains. A
secondary trough embedded within the southwesterly flow will emerge
over the southern Rockies and lift over the southern/central Plains.
A surface low, with trailing dryline and the stationary front, will
focus convective development through the afternoon and evening. The
broad warm sector, ample moisture, and steep mid-level lapse rates
will support moderate to strong instability, overlapping with robust
deep-layer shear. Severe thunderstorms appear likely from Northeast
TX, through AR/LA and into the Mid MS/OH Valleys.

Additionally, some severe risk may develop over parts of the Mid
Atlantic as the cold front slowly approaches from the northwest.
Relatively strong flow aloft may overlap with an increasingly moist
airmass, supporting some potential for storms with a wind/hail risk.
However, weak shortwave ridging, and multiple preceding days of
thunderstorm potential casts considerable uncertainty on the
potential for storms and the positioning of the front/quality of the
low-level airmass.

...D5/Friday...
The upper-level pattern begins to change D5/Friday as an upper low
is forecast to emerge across parts of the Southern Plains and
northern Mexico. Deep meridional flow will overspread parts of TX,
OK and AR while the front begins to sag south across the MS and OH
Valleys. Some supercell risk may develop across the Red River
vicinity and across the mid MS Valley near the stalled front.
However, the surface picture remains very complicated due to
multiple preceding days of convective potential.

...D6/Saturday and beyond...
Confidence in the upper-level evolution diminishes D6/Saturday and
through the weekend, as the projected upper low begins moving
eastward. Increasing high pressure over the northern US may begin to
suppress the northward extent of the deeper surface moisture. While
some severe risk may exist given relatively strong mid-level flow
near the stalled front from the ArkLaTex eastward into the
Southeast, model solutions vary greatly on the affected area and
associated hazards. Confidence is too low to initiate severe
probabilities.
