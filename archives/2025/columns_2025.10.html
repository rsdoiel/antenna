<p>BTW it’s worth
<a href="http://scripting.com/2025/02/24/153052.html">calling
attention</a> to a bit I linked to yesterday. <i>Cross-posting to
Bluesky and Mastodon is not on the roadmap for WordLand.</i> They are
too limited in the features they support for writers. This is a big
point, not a casual thing. I am trying to create a network that’s like
stereo to mono. We’re not going to try to scale down writing in WordLand
so it fits into the tight little featureless well-silo’d boxes in order
to peer with those systems. Instead, I want to force them to give
writers a decent surface to write on. Somehow we lost our minds and
decided deliberately to limit communication to grunts and snorts, and it
should not be a surprise that when our civilization migrated to them, it
became unable to understand complex ideas. I guarantee you Carl Sagan,
if he were alive, would have seen this. Or maybe not? I don’t know. But
it’s a bizarre situation that I’ve decided to try to fix.</p>

<p>The word is starting to spread about
<a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a>. And the product is
holding up pretty well. There are some issues in Safari with the toolbar
that pops up over selection. I see people pasting in URLs that makes me
think it’s not working for them. Don Park started using it. I did my
first project with Don in the late 80s. The project was very successful.
His respect means a lot to me. The positioning – it makes WordPress as
easy to write for as Twitter, is great to hear as users write about it.
That was one of the major design goals. What people are missing, and
it’s right in front of their eyes, they can use writing features that
somehow never made it to the twitter-like systems, the ones listed on
the <a href="https://textcasting.org/">textcasting memorandum</a> (or
manifesto, whichever you prefer). I’m glad people are seeing this as an
enhancement to WordPress, not an attempt to create a new community. I
want <i>all</i> WordPress writers to use this product. Every one of
them. I want people to feel that it’s an essential part of WordPress,
for writers. The writer’s web. Remember that, you’ll be hearing a lot
about that. And I want to be sure we fix all the bugs, and add all the
features they believe are missing, as long as the features pertain to
writing. Everything else is well-covered by the main product. There’s
also an API that comes with WordLand, I’ll be talking more about that
later. Makes it easier to write WordPress apps in JavaScript that run in
the browser.</p>

<p>Lately, political writers have called attention to the tendency of
billionaire Elon Musk to refer to his political opponents as “NPCs.”
This term comes from the gaming world and refers to a nonplayer
character, a character that follows a scripted path and cannot think or
act on its own, and is there only to populate the world of the game for
the actual players.</p>

<h2 id="tag-youre-it">Tag, you’re it</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-09, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
I’m a bit behind in my RSS feeds and I didn’t realize
<a href="https://www.susanjeanrobertson.com/writing/tag-youre-it/">Susan
tagged me</a> to answer a series of questions about my blog. I’ve read
dozens of these and to be honest was feeling a little left out, so
thanks Susan for including me! (Susan’s one of my favorite bloggers and
crafters, be sure to like and subscribe.)
</p>
<h2>
Why did you start blogging in the first place?
</h2>
<p>
I published a zine in high school with my best friend Mike. Our zine
Wimpkiller was a creative outlet for all the composition notebooks we
filled up over a bottomless cups of coffee at IHOP. We’d print out
stories on Mike’s computer, chop ’em up, glue ’em together, and then
scam copies after midnight with the help of the friendly late-shift
worker at Kinko’s. I enjoyed that thrill of self-publishing then as much
as I do now. It felt like the garage band of writing. You may not be
good or ever get famous, but you can brute force some art into the
world.
</p>
<p>
In college blogs became a trend. I created a blog as I graduated from
college to chronicle my entry into the corporate world and ended up
chronicling my move and life in Japan. It served as a form of catharsis
and outward processing as well as keeping my friends and family up to
date on my adventures. That blog died after I came back from Japan and
had to get a job and start a career.
</p>
<p>
Meeting Jeffery Zeldman at SXSW was the inspiration for this edition of
the blog, if you can believe it. A brief encounter but my key takeaway
on how I could become more like my web development heroes was to write
more. They write, and writing begets books, and books begets conference
talks. It seemed like a template I could follow and I started
self-publishing again. Over time, I wrote enough to where I got to write
on <a href="https://alistapart.com/">Jeffrey’s blog</a> and speak at his
conference a handful of times. I guess the plan worked out.
</p>
<h2>
What platform are you using to manage your blog and why did you choose
it?
</h2>
<p>
I started on WordPress but
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2012/11/brander-newer/">I moved my blog
to Jekyll in 2012</a>. I chose Jekyll because I was into Ruby at the
time and fighting with WordPress for good performance was exhausting me.
I wanted a simpler authoring and development experience. The simplicity
of building with markdown files on <code>localhost</code> still
resonates with me.
</p>
<h2>
Have you blogged on other platforms before?
</h2>
<p>
I’ve used Blogger, MovableType, WordPress, and Jekyll. There’s also an
ill-fated Eleventy branch on my site that never made it to production.
I’m sure Jekyll will implode and I’ll need to find something else, but
switching platforms would be a distraction for me at this point without
some obvious benefit or process improvement.
</p>
<h2>
How do you write your posts? For example, in a local editing tool, or in
a panel/dashboard that’s part of your blog?
</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2021/09/my-notion-blogging-kanban/">I
write my posts in a giant Notion kanban</a>. It’s overkill but it’s my
overkill. The organization capabilities and “markdown-like” aspects of
Notion made it a good fit over a folder-o’-files. Before publishing, my
posts go through a series of
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2021/10/pre-publish-blogging-rituals/">pre-publishing
rituals</a>. With those processes combined I maintain a level of quality
and throughput that I’m happy with.
</p>
<h2>
When do you feel most inspired to write?
</h2>
<p>
I find time to write after the kids go to bed. If there’s time during
the workday, I may spend a lunch break jotting some thoughts too. My
blogging is very work-dependent to the extent that sometimes
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2020/09/boredom-begets-boredom/">when
I’m productive at work, I’m most productive at blogging</a>. But often,
I’m too tired or focusing on other tasks to craft a well-reasoned blog
post.
</p>
<h2>
Do you publish immediately after writing, or do you let it simmer a bit
as a draft?
</h2>
<p>
Most of my drafts simmer for weeks if not months or years. From time to
time I’ll do a one day turnaround on a post and that’s rewarding, but
it’s inconsistent. At the time of writing I have 22 active drafts where
”active” means I’ve updated them at least once in the last six months.
If I increase the scope to one year, there’s 41 drafts in my kanban.
</p>
<h2>
What are you generally interested in writing about?
</h2>
<p>
I’m a generalist at heart and enjoy writing about technology generally.
If you look at my archive it’s pretty rare that two consecutive posts
will be thematically similar. I write about specific technologies like
CSS but also about game development or the capital-W Web. And of course
prototypes, which I’m convinced are the not-so-secret sauce for building
great technologies.
</p>
<p>
One direction I’m slipping towards in my mind is futurism and
speculative fiction
(e.g. <a href="https://daverupert.com/stories/">sci-fi</a>). Writing
about current technology limits you to existing capitalist and corporate
structures. Imagining the future
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2017/10/a-good-science-fiction-story/">and
the potential fallout</a> allows you to think without the confines of
“Good because make money” which so much of our discourse is today.
</p>
<h2>
Who are you writing for?
</h2>
<p>
Woof. Good question. 90% of the time I’m writing to get ideas out of my
head. Transfiguring ideas into text works wonders for me. I also tend to
write for an abstract audience, people who are curious about the web and
technology yet crave more from it; a person who considers themselves a
technologist, but also factors in morality and other
<a href="http://localhost:4000/2024/04/thoughts-on-cosmotechnics/">cosmotechnics</a>.
</p>
<h2>
What’s your favorite post on your blog?
</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/08/quick-thoughts-on-chips/">Quick
Thoughts on Chips</a> (2023) is up there but I feel like
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2013/04/responsive-deliverables/">Responsive
Deliverables</a> (2013) aka, the “tiny bootstraps” post, is a level of
quality, thoughtfulness, and timelessness that I don’t achieve often.
I’d like more “timeless” pieces like that, but I don’t exactly know how
or if it’s worth trying to bottle that magic.
</p>
<h2>
Any future plans for your blog? Maybe a redesign, a move to another
platform, or adding a new feature?
</h2>
<p>
I’m pretty comfortable with my site, but I have a couple changes in
mind:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c13gpBrnGEw&amp;t=225s">Use
named grid lines</a>
</li>
<li>
Blowout my tag pages with custom art direction
</li>
<li>
Make my mobile layout perfect
</li>
<li>
Write more <a href="https://daverupert.com/stories/">shitty sci-fi</a>
</li>
<li>
Switch from Notion to Obsidian
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Some of those will happen over the course of a year, some in the dark of
night, some never.
</p>
<h2>
Tag ’em.
</h2>
<p>
What a responsibility to add people to this chain letter! Susan told me
if I don’t forward this to 10 people, my grandparents will die! That
seems extreme but okay. I’ll tag the following people who I think
haven’t written one yet:
</p>
<ul>
<li>

pass the mic back to Jeffrey.
</li>
<li>

blogger that inspired me in my early days
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://melanie-richards.com/">Melanie Richards</a> - a
multi-talented person and another one of my favorite crafters.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://livelaugh.blog/">Jenn Schiffer</a> - talented artist
and consistently way funnier than everyone else in the room.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://ericwbailey.website/">Eric Bailey</a> - one of my
favorite web thinkers and also has
<a href="https://buttondown.com/ericwbailey">the most interesting
newsletter</a> out there.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://blakewatson.com/">Blake Watson</a> - deliverer of
home-cooked applications
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://joshcollinsworth.com/">Josh Collinsworth</a> -

2025-03-09 The looming Discord IPO
</h1>
<p>
So… Discord might be going there. I like their offering. I even pay them
about $10/month. What they offer works well. People get their own little
communities to administer, with the tools to administer them well, with
the self-written automations and bots to handle communities from a
handful of people to many thousands. Read
<a class="account" href="https://infosec.exchange/@isotopp" title="@isotopp@infosec.exchange"><span

on Discord</a>.
</p>
<p>
But the monetization drive is strong. And once the shareholders are in
place, pressure for monetization will ramp up even more, I’m sure. How
long until it all goes down? Five years?
</p>
<p>
What are your backup plans?
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://campaignwiki.org/wiki/Chat">My backup plan</a> is an
IRC backend (<a href="https://ngircd.barton.de/">ngircd</a> uses about
5M of memory) and two instances of a web front-end called
<a href="https://thelounge.chat/">The Lounge</a>. One of them is free
for all and connects to my chat server; the other needs registration and
offers file uploads and always-on connectivity (it acts as a “bouncer”).
The two of them take about 150M of memory. Each registered account gets
a little SQLite file with the logs. No other resources required.
</p>
<p>
You can connect to the IRC backend directly using your favourite IRC
client, of course. Emacs comes with two of them. Just saying. 😄
</p>
<p>
For iOS, there’s <a href="https://colloquy.app/">Colloquy</a>.
</p>
<p>
For Android,
<a class="account" href="https://tabletop.social/@wandererbill" title="@wandererbill@tabletop.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="wandererbill">@wandererbill</span></a>
suggests <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/io.mrarm.irc/">Revolution
IRC</a>.
</p>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://tabletop.social/@phf" title="@phf@tabletop.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="phf">@phf</span></a> suggested
<a href="https://snikket.org/service/quickstart/">Snikket</a> instead.
Installation requires a Docker image.
</p>
<p>
I dislike Docker, not because of what it is but because of what it
implies. A virtual machine inside your virtual machine means that it
doesn’t auto-update. Upgrading will be tricky. It also means individual
deployment requires multiple services such that it ended up being easier
for them to supply a Docker image instead of supplying good
instructions. I always take that to mean that the setup is brittle and
underdocumented. Perhaps I’m wrong but it that’s the suspicion I have.
</p>
<p>
Generally speaking, I dislike Docker images for my virtual server server
(6G memory, 75g storage, 2 cores) because multiple services packaged in
a dockerfile usually mean lots of resources required. Frugal computing
means that I am loath to accommodate that. I prefer not to upgrade my
virtual machine.

had Discord-like roles and role management for the server owner to hand
out, so perhaps it’s quite a suitable replacement. Revolt can be
self-hosted via Docker or self-building. At least there is a lot of info
out there.

wanted to give Matrix another spin. There are two server
implementations, Synapse and Dendrite.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
At an absolute minimum, Dendrite will expect 1GB RAM. For a comfortable
day-to-day deployment which can participate in federated rooms for a
number of local users, be prepared to assign 2-4 CPU cores and 8GB RAM —
more if your user count increases. –

<a href="https://jitsi.org/">Jitsi</a>. I tried to self-host it a few
years ago. It worked well! But it also took a lot of resource. During
the video call, the virtual machine’s

sometimes use the installation at the

<p>
So, where does that leave is? I don’t know. People don’t seem to like
The Lounge with IRC backend and I seem to be unwilling to upgrade my
hosting commitments.

<p>
<a class="account" href="https://hackers.town/@mc" title="@mc@hackers.town"><span
class="citation" data-cites="mc">@mc</span></a> recently recommended a
different IRC server called <a href="https://ergo.chat/about">Ergo</a>
and a different web front-end called
<a href="https://codeberg.org/emersion/gamja">Gamja</a> but it’s unclear
to me what significant advantages either would offer.

wrote in with some interesting feedback. The Zulip part is interesting
because I only used it for tiny bit, talking to the maintainers of
Antora. Here’s what they have to say:
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
Zulip is great for UI, slightly aggravating to run. It absolutely wants
a dedicated server. It has a dice roller as one of the sample bots, and
the API is extensive.
</li>
<li>
IRC is extremely easy to setup and relatively easy to write bots for.
Interfaces vary from bare bones to not-bad; The Lounge is up on the
not-bad end, and also easy to host.
</li>
<li>
Matrix may be the future of federated chat systems, but if you don’t
need federation, the complexity and ongoing maintenance are not worth
it.
</li>
<li>
Jitsi has integrated chat but is video-conferencing-centric; the text
chat is actually Prosody (an XMPP/Jabber) server under the hood. Video
processing takes up a lot of CPU and bouncing it around takes a lot of
bandwidth; otherwise, it’s pretty nice.
</li>
<li>
I haven’t tried running Revolt but I looked at the docs and I am really
not favorably inclined. They have some questionable technology choices
and insist on a Docker-first install that in my experience is a likely
sign that there are too many moving parts for anyone to be able to
diagnose what’s going wrong.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
My suggestions would be:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
IRC is still a solid choice
</li>
<li>
Prosody without the Jitsi video conferencing is pretty nice, albeit a
little complex to configure initially.
</li>
<li>
If I felt like spending the money for a medium-large VM at a hosting
service dedicated to gaming, Zulip would be nice.
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
I didn’t know about the hosting of Zulip but the rest tracks my
experience. IRC is the simplest option.

very last message in the DG is</a>, now, 25 years later, basically the
design of the network I’m building – with WordLand as the frontend and
WordPress as the backend. The issue is the same. When people post only
to get attention, forget about anything useful getting done there. It’s
strictly a broadcast system. So the investment Masto and Bluesky make in
discourse is imho wasted complexity. What we want is linking, not
replies. If they were the web, they would be designed very differently.
Anyway, in 2000, I asked people to put their ideas on their own sites,
send me a link, and maybe I’ll post it on my site. That right there is
the plan for the new network. Facilitating that, it’s as easy as posting
on a twitter-like system (the early users
<a href="https://doc.searls.com/2025/03/07/first-drafting/">confirm</a>
that!), but the post goes into <i>your</i> space ie your blog, and a
link goes to the person you’re responding to, and it’s up to them
whether or not they want to amplify it, using their own criteria, in
their space, to their subscribers. It’s why twitter failed to be a keg
of revolutionary ideas, instead one of warring factions in a prison. Not
able to leave, but not able to do anything either.</p>

<h2 id="fucking-republicans-and-medicare">Fucking Republicans and
Medicare</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-09, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I am hereby changing the name of “Republicans” to “Fucking Republicans”
because that’s what they do and what we’re going to do to them. Today’s
issue is Medicare, which hits home to me, a person who planned for
health care and depends on Medicare.
</p>
<p>
I need my Medicare. It’s my health insurance. Health insurance always
been a problem for me, with pre-existing conditions, and at one point a
lapsed corporate plan.
</p>
<p>
I finally got on solid ground or so I thought when I turned 65 a few
years ago. Now I find out that the Repubs are going to cancel or reduce
my insurance, and I don’t imagine that a person my age, with my
pre-existing conditions (we all have them once at this age) I could get
insurance.
</p>
<p>
So please tell me Republicans, how this is meant to work? I am not
stupid and I know Medicare is not out of money. Am I going to be paying
out of pocket for my health care? Are there any doctors or hospitals who
even do this any longer?
</p>
<p>
Repubs, if my Medicare goes down, you are going down too.
</p>
<p>

<h2 id="krugmans-paywall">Krugman’s paywall</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-09, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I’m not a paid subscriber to anything on Substack. But I do read a few
of their newsletters when they come out, including
<a href="https://paulkrugman.substack.com/">Paul Krugman’s</a>. Almost
always must-read stuff.
</p>
<p>
But he also writes on the “other side of the paywall.” When he announced
it, he said he doesn’t need the money, so I wondered why he does it. I
kept reading anyway.
</p>
<p>
But he does something incredibly annoying and as clueless imho as the
things he calls out in his writing — I only find out an article is on
the other side of the paywall after I’ve read the first few paragraphs.
I am a fan and I would send the money directly if he asked for it, but
not via Substack.
</p>
<p>
Here’s an
<a href="https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/the-clean-little-secret-of-social">example</a>
of such a post.
</p>
<p>
So because I don’t pay I have to lose that time every time you do this?
Have some respect for us who read you. I’m as old as he is, and I like
to use my time well. So please either get rid of the stinking paywall,
or warn us up front.
</p>
<p>
And also consider getting off
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=substack">Substack</a>.
It’s not a good look.
