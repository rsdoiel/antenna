Guitars)</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-27, from: Luthier on Luthier with Michael Bashkin</p>
<p>
For episode 98 of the podcast, I am joined by renowned classical guitar
maker Gary Southwell. Based on the banks of the River Rede in
Northumberland, England, Southwell has been building instruments since
1983.
</p>
<p>
Gary and I talk about the unique characteristics of Bog Oak, the history
and influence of 19th-century Viennese guitars, his interactions with
Julian Bream, and some reflections on 50 years of guitar making.
