<p>date: 2025-06-22, updated: 2025-06-20, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Three days is all I had until Jan, Jan, Jan, and Jan burned to a
crisp.  I awoke and went to the elevator where Jan Miner passed by
muttering something about the “fucked-up world we live it.” Agreed. I

<p>Every June, the video game industry gets together in Los Angeles to

<p>There are five official Die Hard movies. Given star Bruce Willis’

<p>It has been six years since Ring Fit Adventure, the Nintendo Switch
fitness game that asked players to defeat monsters (and a sexy dragon)

measure your movements and translate them into fitness attacks on

<p>Wizard of Legend 2 is about as good as roguelikes get. It’s a shame
then that I’ve spent more time trying to play Wizard of Legend 2 than
I’ve spent actually playing Wizard of Legend 2. The original Wizard of

<p>28 Years Later might be the third entry in the horror series, but the
moody film feels like it could be a standalone work – right up until its
final moments. The post-apocalyptic coming-of-age story from director
Danny Boyle (Slumdog Millionaire) and writer Alex Garland (Civil War)

<p>First place is one of the most dangerous places to be during a Mario

<p>Since time immemorial, the axiom’s been that you buy a Nintendo
console to play Nintendo games. Third-party games made by other
publishers are worthwhile, but typically those are the sorts of
experiences you can find on other platforms as well. For Nintendo’s
latest hardware, the Switch 2, things are trending in a similar
