                    <p>A longstanding tradition has it that Popes change  their names  from their baptismal name, though it hasn’t always been the case, especially in the first centuries of Christianity. Popes have often chosen the names of their immediate or distant predecessors out of respect, admiration, or recognition to mark continuity, but also  different names to mark innovation.  </p>

## Cardinal Fernández Artime: From Pope Francis, the call to awaken the world

date: 2025-05-04, from: Vatican News


                    <p>During the eighth Mass of the Novemdiales in memory of Pope Francis, the Cardinal and former Pro-Prefect of the Dicastery for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life invites the faithful to turn the apostles' enthusiasm, sparked by the appearance of the Risen Christ, into a "life program." Their "wonder," in contrast to "bewilderment" and "discouragement," becomes a model for those today who are in "great need of encountering the Lord."</p>
