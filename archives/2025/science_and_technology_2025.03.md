## When a sole maintainer steps down, Linux drivers become orphans

date: 2025-01-25, from: OS News

The Linux kernel has become such an integral, core part of pretty much all aspects of the technology world, and corporate contributions to the kernel make up such a huge chunk of the kernel&#8217;s ongoing development, it&#8217;s easy to forget that some parts of the kernel are still maintained by some lone person in Jacksonville, Nebraska, or whatever. Sadly, we were reminded of this today when the sole maintainer of a few DRM (no, not the bad kind) announced he can no longer maintain the gud, mi0283qt, panel-mipi-dbi, and repaper drivers. Remove myself as maintainer for gud, mi0283qt, panel-mipi-dbi and repaper. My fatigue illness has finally closed the door on doing development of even moderate complexity so it&#8217;s sad to let this go. ↫ Noralf Trønnes There must be quite a few obscure parts of the Linux kernel that are of no interest to the corporate world, and thus remain maintained by individuals in their free time, out of some personal need or perhaps a sense of duty. If one such person gives up their role as maintainer, for whatever reason, you better hope it&#8217;s not something your workflow relies, because if no new maintainer is found, you will eventually run into trouble. I hope Trønnes gets better soon, and if not, that someone else can take over from him to maintain these drivers. The gud driver seems like a really neat tool for homebrew projects, and it&#8217;d be sad to see it languish as the years go by.

## Android 16 Beta 1 has started rolling out for Pixel devices

date: 2025-01-25, from: OS News

Basically, this seems to mean applications will no longer be allowed to limit themselves to phone size when running on devices with larger screens, like tablets. Other tidbits in this first beta include predictive back support for 3-button navigation, support for the Advanced Professional Video codec from Samsung, among other things. It&#8217;s still quite early in the release process, so more is sure to come, and some things might not make it to the final release at all.

In addition, optical-domain clocks can also enable a wide range of next-generation commercial applications that require increased connectivity, high bandwidth, low latency and beyond-GPS timing precision.</p><p>The recent discovery of a nuclear clock transition in an isotope of thorium (<sup>229</sup>Th) could portend a paradigm shift in high precision optical-domain clocks.&nbsp;</p><p>Owing to the natural isolation of the nucleus from external disturbances, clocks based on nuclear transitions can enable extraordinary levels of timing precision within a compact, portable package.&nbsp;</p><p>The SUNSPOT program aims to develop a key enabling technology for the realization of a thorium-based nuclear clock — a coherent laser source in the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) region of the electromagnetic spectrum.&nbsp;</p><p>It is anticipated that this laser source will enable accurate spectroscopic studies of the thorium clock transition and the technological development of high-performance nuclear clocks.</p></div>

Today, U.S. adversaries launder billions of U.S. dollars yearly. Half of North Korea’s nuclear program is backed by laundered funds, according to statements by the White House<a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a>, while a federal indictment alleges that money launderers tied to Chinese underground banking are a primary source of financial services for Mexico’s Sinaloa cartel<a href="#2"><sup>2</sup></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite recent anti-money laundering efforts, the United States still faces challenges in countering money laundering effectively for several reasons. According to congressional research, money laundering schemes often evade detection and disruption, as anti-money laundering (AML) efforts today rely on manual analysis of large amounts of data and are limited by finite resources and human cognitive processing speed<a href="#3"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p><p>To address these challenges, DARPA is seeking research proposals for its <a href="https://drupal.darpa.mil/research/programs/a3ml-anticipatory-adaptive"><strong>Anticipatory and Adaptive Anti-Money Laundering (A3ML) </strong>program</a>.</p><p>“Money laundering finances our adversaries’ weapons programs, global terrorism, and the illicit drug trade, all of which threaten U.S. national security,” said <a href="https://drupal.darpa.mil/about/people/david-rushing-dewhurst">Dr. David Rushing Dewhurst, A3ML program manager</a>, “The way we address these threats today is largely through manual data collection and analysis methods that threaten privacy. We are looking for new technological ideas that preserve privacy while setting a course to end to our adversaries’ financial warfare.” A3ML aims to develop rapid graph-search algorithms to sift through financial transactions graphs for suspicious patterns and learn new patterns to anticipate future activities. Dewhurst says the program’s success hinges on algorithms’ ability to learn a precise representation of how bad actors move money around the world without sharing sensitive data.</p><p>“The demand for enhanced information sharing between law enforcement and financial institutions’ anti-money laundering organizations is significant,” explained Dewhurst. “However, developing technology that enables this exchange while safeguarding Americans’ privacy remains a challenge. DARPA’s unique convening power will harness the nation’s best minds to shift anti-money laundering analysis from a largely manual process to one that rapidly provides human analysts with the data and analysis they need at their fingertips, all while increasing financial privacy.”</p><p>To accomplish A3ML goals, performers will develop techniques to represent patterns of illicit financial behavior in a concise, machine-readable format that’s also easily understood by human analysts. Resulting algorithms would be able to search financial databases for matches to those patterns of behavior, alerting to the likely presence of money laundering without directly sharing sensitive financial data.</p><p>DARPA will sponsor Proposers Day on Feb. 20, 2025 in Arlington, VA.

## Snowdrop OS: a homebrew operating system from scratch, in x86 assembly language

date: 2025-01-23, from: OS News

Snowdrop OS was born of my childhood curiosity around what happens when a PC is turned on, the mysteries of bootable disks, and the hidden aspects of operating systems. It is a 16-bit real mode operating system for the IBM PC architecture. I designed and developed this homebrew OS from scratch, using only x86 assembly language. I have created and included a number of utilities, including a file manager, text editor, graphical applications, BASIC interpreter, x86 assembler and debugger. I also ported one of my DOS games to it. After all, what kind of an operating system doesn&#8217;t have games? ↫ Snowdrop OS&#8217; website It seems like every talented programmer will, at some point, think to themselves: I should write my own operating system. Most of these efforts strand pretty quickly &#8211; and that&#8217;s fine! &#8211; but Sebastian Mihai&#8217;s effort did not, and it has grown into a very capable operating system, especially given the constraints stemming from the chosen architecture &#8211; 16bit realmode x86 &#8211; and programming language &#8211; x86 assembly. Snowdrop OS is an incredibly impressive labour of love, and comes with a unique extra I haven&#8217;t seen before: a daily development log covering over 600 days of development. No, this won&#8217;t take over the world, but I love that is exists. More of this, please.

## NixBSD: an unofficial NixOS fork with a FreeBSD kernel

date: 2025-01-23, from: OS News

NixBSD is an attempt to make a reproducible and declarable BSD, based on NixOS. Although theoretically much of this work could be copied to build other BSDs, all work thus far has been focused on building a FreeBSD distribution. ↫ NixBSD GitHub page Look, it&#8217;s my job to make sure I use and am familiar with as many operating systems and related tools as possible. As much as you guys support OSNews on Patreon or Ko-Fi, it&#8217;s going to take a lot of you to push me to dive into Nix and NixOS, because every time I hear anything about it, people seem entirely in over their heads and spending way, way too much time trying to properly use it. I have a wife and two little children, and as much as Nix intrigues and fascinates, I&#8217;m not going to lose my sanity to it. Anyway, combining NixOS with FreeBSD seems like a fun project and a great idea, and also kind of an inevitability &#8211; any cool technology eventually makes its way to BSD in one way or another, after all. The project is in flux, and they&#8217;re not at the stage where you can just download an ISO and get going, but if you&#8217;re already knee-deep in Nix and want a new challenge, this might be right up your alley. Me, I&#8217;m not learning a programing language just to manage my packages. Or should I? For the memes?

## 9front “THIS TIME DEFINITELY” released

The operating system I&#8217;m not cool enough to run has pushed out a new release: 9front “THIS TIME DEFINITELY” is now available. 9front is a fork of plan9, created after plan9 languished at Bell Labs. This release enables gefs, the new file system, in the installer, &#8220;ip/ipconfig now support dhcpv6 dynamic allocations and handles prefix expirations&#8221;, and it comes with some smaller changes, too, of course. Despite every piece of evidence to the contrary, I am simply not cool enough to run 9front. Maybe one day they&#8217;ll notice me, and I get invited to the cool table where the Puffs eat lunch. Who doesn&#8217;t want to ring a bell in the headmaster&#8217;s office at midnight?

## Right to root access

date: 2025-01-21, from: OS News

I believe consumers, as a right, should be able to install software of their choosing to any computing device that is owned outright. This should apply regardless of the computer’s form factor. In addition to traditional computing devices like PCs and laptops, this right should apply to devices like mobile phones, “smart home” appliances, and even industrial equipment like tractors. In 2025, we’re ultra-connected via a network of devices we do not have full control over. Much of this has to do with how companies lock their devices’ bootloaders, prevent root access, and prohibit installation of software that is not explicitly sanctioned through approval in their own distribution channels. We should really work on changing that. ↫ Medhir Bhargava Obviously, this is preaching to the choir here on OSNews. I agree with Bhargava 100%. It should be illegal for any manufacturer of computing devices &#8211; with a possible exception for, say, things like medical implants, certain aspects of car control units, and so on &#8211; to lock down and/or restrict owners&#8217; ability to install whatever software they want, run whatever code they want, and install whatever operating system they want on the devices that they own. Computers are interwoven into the very fabric of every aspect of our society, and having them under the sole control of the biggest megacorporations in the world is utterly dystopian, and wildly dangerous. Personally, I would take it a step further: any and all code that runs on products sold must be open. Not necessarily open source, but at the very least open, so that it can be inspected when malice is suspected. This way, society can make sure that the tech billionaire oligarchs giving nazi salutes aren&#8217;t in full, black-box control over our devices. Secrecy as a means of corporate control is incredibly dangerous, and forcing all code to be open is the perfect way to combat this. Copyright is more than enough intellectual property protection for code. The odds of this happening are, of course, slim, especially with the aforementioned tech billionaire oligarchs giving nazi salutes effectively running the most powerful military in human history. Reason is in short supply these days, and I doubt that&#8217;s going to change any time soon.

## How UNIX spell ran in 64kB RAM

date: 2025-01-20, from: OS News

How do you fit a 250kB dictionary in 64kB of RAM and still perform fast lookups? For reference, even with modern compression techniques like gzip -9, you can&#8217;t compress this file below 85kB. In the 1970s, Douglas McIlroy faced this exact challenge while implementing the spell checker for Unix at AT&#38;T. The constraints of the PDP-11 computer meant the entire dictionary needed to fit in just 64kB of RAM. A seemingly impossible task. ↫ Abhinav Upadhyay They still managed to do it, but had to employ some incredibly clever tricks to make it work, and make it work fast. Such skillful engineers interested in optimising and eeking the most possible performance out of underpowered hardware still exist today, but they&#8217;re not in any position to make lasting changes at any of the companies defining our technology today. Why spend money on skilled engineers, when you can just throw cheap hardware at the problem? I wonder just how many resources the spellchecking feature in Word or LibreOffice Writer takes up.

## Introduction to GrapheneOS

date: 2025-01-20, from: OS News

GrapheneOS (written GOS from now on) is an Android based operating system that focuses security. It is only compatible with Google Pixel devices for multiple reasons: availability of hardware security components, long term support (series 8 and 9 are supported at least 7 years after release) and the hardware has a good quality / price ratio. The goal of GOS is to provide users a lot more control about what their smartphone is doing. A main profile is used by default (the owner profile), but users are encouraged to do all their activities in a separate profile (or multiples profiles). This may remind you about Qubes OS workflow, although it does not translate entirely here. Profiles can not communicate between each others, encryption is done per profile, and some permissions can be assigned per profile (installing apps, running applications in background when a profile is not used, using the SIM&#8230;). This is really effective for privacy or security reasons (or both), you can have a different VPN per profile if you want, or use a different Google Play login, different applications sets, whatever! The best feature here in my opinion is the ability to completely stop a profile so you are sure it does not run anything in the background once you exit it. ↫ Solène Rapenne I switched to GrapheneOS on my Pixel 8 Pro as part of my process to cleanse myself of as much Big Tech as possible, and I&#8217;ve been incredibly happy with it. The additional security and privacy control GrapheneOS brings is amazing, and the fact it opted for a sandboxed Google Play Services basically means there&#8217;s no compatibility issues, unlike when using microG, where compatibility problems are a fact of life. GrapheneOS&#8217; security and other updates are on par or even faster than the stock Google Pixel&#8217;s Android, and the overall user experience is virtually identical to stock Android. The only downside is the reliance on Pixel devices &#8211; it&#8217;s an understandable choice, but does mean giving money to Google if you don&#8217;t already own a Pixel. A workaround, if you will, is to buy a used or refurbished Pixel, but that may not always be an option either. For me personally, I&#8217;ll be sticking with my Pixel 8 Pro for a long time, but if it were to break, I&#8217;d most likely go the used Pixel route to avoid enriching Google. For pretty much anyone reading OSNews, GrapheneOS would be a great choice, and if you already have a Pixel, I strongly urge you consider switching.
