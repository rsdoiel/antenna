## Lucy Wang’s Hanami Dango

date: 2025-04-15, from: Taste of Home

The Sakura Matsuri, also known as the Cherry Blossom Festival, celebrates the spring season! These squishy treats make adorable drink garnishes and are a great kids' activity (they're basically nontoxic play dough and a lot less messy). If you want to prep them in advance, make the balls but don’t boil them just yet! Sprinkle a little glutinous rice flour on them and freeze them in an airtight container. Boil them right before you plan to serve them. —Lucy Wang, Los Angeles, California

## LUCKY AND UNLUCKY FOODS IN IRISH FOLKLORE: WHAT FOODS WERE CONSIDERED OMENS OF GOOD OR BAD FORTUNE.

date: 2025-04-14, from: Irish Food Hub

<p>The Roots of Food Superstitions in Irish Folklore In the rich and layered tradition of Irish folklore, food has always carried meanings far beyond nourishment. In ancient Ireland, the line between daily life and the spiritual world was often blurred, and meals were believed to be closely tied to omens, blessings, and curses. Long before the era of supermarkets and processed goods, what people ate—and when, how, and with whom—was steeped in ritual and significance. The Irish, like many Celtic peoples, lived in harmony with the rhythms of the earth, the seasons, and the spirits they believed dwelled in nature. Certain foods were believed to bring protection or luck, while others were avoided for fear of inviting misfortune. These beliefs were passed down orally through generations, embedded in seasonal festivals like Samhain and Imbolc, and often tied to the cycles of planting, harvesting, and family life. For instance, breaking bread with a stranger was seen as an act of good faith and protection against bad luck, while spilling salt at the table was considered a serious omen—unless quickly countered by tossing a pinch over your left shoulder. These customs weren’t simply quaint habits; they were a way of safeguarding the household and inviting prosperity through everyday rituals. As we explore the specific foods believed to bring fortune or folly in Irish folklore, we’ll also gain a window into the cultural values, fears, and hopes of generations past. From the significance of dairy to the omens hidden in fruit and bread, each bite tells a deeper story. Blessed Bites – Foods That Invited Good Fortune In Irish folklore, certain foods weren’t just nourishment—they were seen as blessings in disguise. These lucky foods were woven into seasonal rituals, family customs, and even courting practices, believed to bring protection, prosperity, and health to those who consumed them with respect and intention. One of the most revered lucky foods in Irish tradition was butter. In rural Ireland, butter wasn’t just a staple; it was a symbol of abundance and the fruits of the family’s hard work. People would smear a bit of butter on the doorstep or bury a small lump near the hearth at Beltane (May Day) to attract good luck and a fertile season. It was also believed that offering butter to traveling faeries or passing beggars ensured continued blessings from both the natural and spiritual worlds. Oats and oatcakes were also considered lucky, especially when eaten at the start of a journey or a new venture. Farmers and travelers might carry oatcakes for protection, and eating them before leaving home was thought to bring safe travels and favorable outcomes. Oats symbolized steadiness, warmth, and sustenance—everything needed to weather life’s uncertainties. Eggs, too, were seen as fortunate, particularly when given as gifts. They represented new life and rebirth, and gifting eggs to neighbors—especially around Easter—was a way to strengthen community bonds and share blessings. In addition to specific foods, sharing a meal was itself an act that drew luck. Offering food to guests, travelers, or even the poor was considered a sacred gesture. The Irish proverb “It is in the shelter of each other that the people live” was embodied in this tradition. Feeding others was not only an act of kindness but also a way to ensure that good fortune continued to flow through the household. Even apple tarts held symbolic meaning—when baked with a small coin or charm inside (a precursor to today’s barmbrack custom at Halloween), the finder was said to be blessed with wealth, love, or luck, depending on the object discovered. These customs weren’t arbitrary—they reflected a deep belief in the spiritual energy of the home and the idea that food, when respected and shared, was a conduit for good fortune. Cursed Crumbs – Foods Believed to Bring Bad Luck Just as some foods were revered for their power to bring luck, others were cautiously avoided or treated with suspicion in Irish folklore. These &#8220;unlucky&#8221; foods were believed to attract misfortune, illness, or even supernatural wrath if mishandled or consumed at the wrong time or in the wrong way. One of the most widely feared practices was baking bread on a Sunday. While bread itself was a sacred and sustaining staple, making it on the Lord’s Day was thought to invite bad luck or even divine disapproval. Some believed the bread would fail to rise or turn out poorly, while others feared it would bring disharmony into the home. Sunday was a day of rest, and violating that sanctity with labor like baking was considered both disrespectful and ominous. Spilled salt was another bad omen, mirroring a superstition found across many cultures. In Irish homes, spilling salt was thought to invite quarrels or misfortune, particularly if it occurred during a meal. The traditional remedy was to throw a pinch of the spilled salt over your left shoulder to blind the devil waiting behind you—an action meant to ward off the evil energy attracted by carelessness. Leaving milk out overnight was also seen as risky. In some parts of Ireland, it was believed that faeries might take the milk—or worse, sour it—if it was not properly covered or protected. The milk of the household cow was a vital resource, and great care was taken to keep it &#8220;clean&#8221; of supernatural interference. Some households placed a sprig of rowan or a bit of iron nearby to ward off bad luck or faerie mischief. Even eggs, while lucky in some contexts, could carry bad luck if misused. Breaking an egg and finding a double yolk was seen as an omen—sometimes of pregnancy or prosperity, but in darker traditions, it could foreshadow a death in the family, particularly if it happened unexpectedly or repeatedly. Perhaps the most dramatic superstition surrounded throwing food away. In times when food was scarce and precious, wasting it wasn’t just impractical—it was considered spiritually dangerous. To discard bread, for example, without saying a blessing or apology could offend divine forces or household spirits. There was</p>

## STAMPY (STAMPIES)

date: 2025-04-14, from: Irish Food Hub

<p>Description: Stampy is a humble, survival-era Irish dish made from mashed turnips or potatoes, lightly salted, and eaten cold. It was commonly prepared in leaner times and served as a filling, no-fuss meal. Though simple, it reflects the resilience and ingenuity of Irish rural cooking. Prep Time: 10 minutesCook Time: 25 minutesServings: 4 Ingredients: 4 medium floury potatoes or 2 medium turnips (or a mix) 1–2 tsp salt (to taste) Optional: a knob of butter or a drizzle of cream (modern twist) Instructions: 1.Peel &#38; Boil:Peel the potatoes or turnips. Chop into chunks and boil in lightly salted water until soft (about 20–25 minutes). 2.Drain &#38; Mash:Drain thoroughly. Mash until smooth. You can add a pinch more salt at this stage or a little butter if desired, though traditional versions used none. 3.Cool &#38; Set:Spread the mash into a shallow dish and allow it to cool completely. It will firm up slightly as it cools. 4.Serve Cold:Cut into rough slices or scoop into portions. Traditionally eaten plain, though sometimes with buttermilk or bread. Garnish with chopped parsley if desired. This dish was often made in the evening and eaten cold the next day, straight from the dish or with a bit of sour milk.</p>
