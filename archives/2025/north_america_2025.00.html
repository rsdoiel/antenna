Orleans attack, Vegas explosion highlight extremist violence by active
military and veterans</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>While much remains unknown about the man who carried out an attack in
New Orleans on New Year’s and another who died in an explosion in Las
Vegas the same day, the violence highlights the increased role of people
with military experience in ideologically driven attacks, especially
those that seek mass casualties.</p>
<p>In New Orleans, Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a veteran of the U.S. Army, was
killed by police after a deadly rampage in a pickup truck that left 14
others dead and injured dozens more. It’s being investigated as an act
of terrorism inspired by the Islamic State group.</p>
<p>In Las Vegas, officials say Matthew Livelsberger, an active duty
member of the U.S. Army Special Forces, shot himself in the head in a
Tesla Cybertruck packed with firework mortars and camp fuel canisters,
shortly before it exploded outside the entrance of the Trump
International Hotel, injuring seven people. On Friday, investigators
said Livelsberger wrote that the explosion was meant to serve as a
“wakeup call” and that the country was “terminally ill and headed toward
collapse.”</p>
<p>Service members and veterans who radicalize make up a tiny fraction
of a percentage point of the millions who have honorably served their
country. But an Associated Press investigation published last year found
that radicalization among both veterans and active duty service members
was on the rise and that hundreds of people with military backgrounds
had been arrested for extremist crimes since 2017. The AP found that
extremist plots they were involved in during that period had killed or
injured nearly 100 people.</p>
<p>The AP also found multiple issues with the Pentagon’s efforts to
address extremism in the ranks, including that there is still no
force-wide system to track it, and that a cornerstone report on the
issue contained old data, misleading analyses and ignored evidence of
the problem.</p>
<p>Since 2017, both veterans and active duty service members radicalized
at a faster rate than people without military backgrounds, according to
data from terrorism researchers at the National Consortium for the Study
of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism, or START, at the University of
Maryland. Less than 1% of the adult population is currently serving in
the U.S. military, but active duty military members make up a
disproportionate 3.2% of the extremist cases START researchers found
between 2017 and 2022.</p>
<p>While the number of people with military backgrounds involved in
violent extremist plots remains small, the participation of active
military and veterans gave extremist plots more potential for mass
injury or death, according to data collected and analyzed by the AP and
START.</p>
<p>More than 480 people with a military background were accused of
ideologically driven extremist crimes from 2017 through 2023, including
the more than 230 arrested in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021,
insurrection — 18% of those arrested for the attack as of late last
year, according to START. The data tracked individuals with military
backgrounds, most of whom were veterans, involved in plans to kill,
injure or inflict damage for political, social, economic or religious
goals.</p>
<p>The AP’s analysis found that plots involving people with military
backgrounds were more likely to involve mass casualties, weapons
training or firearms than plots that didn’t include someone with a
military background. This held true whether or not the plots were
carried out.</p>
<p>The jihadist ideology of the Islamic State group apparently connected
to the New Orleans attack would make it an outlier in the motivations of
previous attacks involving people with military backgrounds. Only around
9% of such extremists with military backgrounds subscribed to jihadist
ideologies, START researchers found. More than 80% identified with
far-right, anti-government or white supremacist ideologies, with the
rest split among far-left or other motivations.</p>
<p>Still, there have been a number of significant attacks motivated by
the Islamic State and jihadist ideology in which the attackers had U.S.
military backgrounds. In 2017, a U.S. Army National Guard veteran who’d
served in Iraq killed five people in a mass shooting at the Fort
Lauderdale airport in Florida after radicalizing via jihadist message
boards and vowing support for the Islamic State. In 2009, an Army
psychiatrist and officer opened fire at Fort Hood, Texas, and killed 13
people, wounding dozens more. The shooter had been in contact with a
known al-Qaida operative prior to the shooting.</p>
<p>In the shadow of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol — led in part by
veterans — law enforcement officials said the threat from domestic
violent extremists was one of the most persistent and pressing terror
threats to the United States. The Pentagon has said it is “committed to
understanding the root causes of extremism and ensuring such behavior is
promptly and appropriately addressed and reported to the proper
authorities.”</p>
<p>Kristofer Goldsmith, an Army veteran and CEO of Task Force Butler
Institute, which trains veterans to research and counter extremism, said
the problem of violent extremism in the military cuts across ideological
lines. Still, he said, while the Biden administration tried to put in
place efforts to address it, Republicans in Congress opposed them for
political reasons.</p>
<p>“They threw, you know, every roadblock that they could in saying that
all veterans are being called extremists by the Biden administration,”
Goldsmith said. “And now we’re in a situation where we’re four years
behind where we could have been.”</p>
<p>During their long military careers, both Jabbar and Livelsberger
served time at the U.S. Army base formerly known as Fort Bragg in North
Carolina, one of the nation’s largest military bases. One of the
officials who spoke to the AP said there is no overlap in their
assignments at the base, now called Fort Liberty.</p>
<p>Goldsmith said he is concerned that the incoming Trump administration
will focus on the New Orleans attack and ISIS and ignore that most
deadly attacks in the United States in recent history have come from the
far right, particularly if Trump’s nominee for defense secretary, Pete
Hegseth, is confirmed.</p>
<p>Hegseth has justified the medieval Crusades that pitted Christians
against Muslims, criticized the Pentagon’s efforts to address extremism
in the ranks and ahead of Joe Biden’s inauguration in the weeks after
the Jan. 6 attack was himself flagged by a fellow National Guard member
as a possible “insider threat.”</p>

<h2 id="fraud-allegations-rock-south-korean-adoptees-and-families">Fraud
allegations rock South Korean adoptees and families</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Her greatest fear, dormant for decades, came rushing back in an
instant: had she adopted and raised a kidnapped child?</p>
<p>Peg Reif’s daughter, adopted from South Korea in the 1980s, had sent
her a link to a documentary detailing how the system that made their
family was rife with fraud: documents falsified, babies switched,
children snatched off the street and sent abroad.</p>
<p>Reif wept.</p>
<p>She was among more than 120 who contacted The Associated Press this
fall, after a series of stories and a documentary made with Frontline
exposed how Korea created a baby pipeline, designed to ship children
abroad as quickly as possible to meet Western demand. The reporting
shook adoption communities around the world with details about how
agencies competed for babies — pressuring mothers, bribing hospitals,
fabricating documents. Most who wrote were adoptees, but some were
adoptive parents like Reif, horrified to learn they had supported this
system.</p>
<p>“I can’t stand the thought that somebody lost their child,” Reif
said. “I can’t stop thinking about it. I don’t know how to make it
right. I don’t know if I can.”</p>
<p>Forty years ago, she was struggling with infertility. She and her
husband pinned their dreams for a family on adopting a baby from Mexico,
paid an agency thousands of dollars and waited for months. Then the
agency’s directors were arrested, and they learned that those Mexican
babies had been taken from their families against their will. Reif was
heartbroken but recalls even now looking at her husband and saying,
“Thank God we don’t have a child who was stolen.”</p>
<p>But now she isn’t sure of that. Because then they adopted two Korean
children, and brought them to their home in rural Wisconsin, first a son
and then a daughter. The two were not biological siblings, but both
arrived with strangely similar stories in their files: their young
unmarried mothers worked in factories with fathers who disappeared after
they got pregnant.</p>
<p>Back then, Reif still believed the common narrative about foreign
adoption: it saved children who might otherwise live the rest of their
lives in an orphanage, die or be damned to poverty.</p>
<p>“I don’t believe that anymore,” Reif said. “I don’t know what to
believe.”</p>
<p>Cameron Lee Small, a therapist in Minneapolis whose practice caters
to adoptees and their families, said many are feeling an intense sense
of betrayal. Individual adoptees had long shared stories of falsified
identities. But the revelations this year pointed to systemwide
practices that routinely changed babies’ origin stories to process
adoptions quickly, including listing them as “abandoned” even when they
had known parents.</p>
<p>Small, who was also adopted from Korea in the 1980s, summarized what
he’s been hearing from adoptees: “I’m kind of back to nothing. What do I
believe now? Who can I believe?”</p>
<p>Reif’s daughter, Jenn Hamilton, spent her life thinking she was
unwanted, often quipping, “That’s what happens when you’re found in a
dumpster as a baby.”</p>
<p>It has taken a toll on her all her life: She’s been happily married
for nine years, she said, but she has this insatiable insecurity: “I
constantly find myself asking my husband, ‘Are you mad at me? Did I do
something wrong?’ Do you want to leave me?’”</p>
<p>She has no idea anymore if abandonment was ever really her story,
with revelations of abuses so systemic that even the Korean government
likened it to “trafficking.”</p>
<p>“You can’t make that many mistakes. It has to be intentional. It was
this huge tree of deception,” she said. “I feel disgusted.”</p>
<p>Holt International, the U.S.-based agency that pioneered adoptions
from Korea, did not respond to repeated requests for comment for this
story.</p>
<p>Reform is sweeping across Europe — countries have launched
investigations, halted foreign adoptions and apologized to adoptees for
failing to protect them. But the United States, which has taken in the
most adopted children by far, has not done a review of its own history
or culpability.</p>
<p>The U.S. State Department told AP this summer that it would work with
its historian to piece together its history, and detailed initial
findings that some documents might have been falsified. But it said
there was no evidence that U.S. officials were aware of it. The State
Department has since said that it has “been unable to identify any
records that could provide insight into the U.S. government role in
adoptions from South Korea in the 1970s and 1980s.”</p>
<p>Korea’s National Police Agency confirmed an increase in adoptees
registering their DNA for family searches — both at domestic police
stations and diplomatic offices across North America and Europe — in the
weeks following the release of the AP stories and documentary in
September. More than 120 adoptees registered their DNA in October and
November, compared to an average of fewer than 30 a month from January
to August.</p>
<p>Korea’s government has maintained that adoptions were a necessary
tool to care for needy children, including babies of unwed mothers or
other children deemed as abandoned. However, Korea’s Ministry of Health
and Welfare acknowledged to AP that the adoption boom in the 1970s and
80s was possibly fueled by a desire to reduce welfare costs.</p>
<p>Korea’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission has been investigating
government accountability over foreign adoption problems since 2022,
prompted by complaints filed by hundreds of adoptees, and is expected to
release an interim report in February. The Commission has posted the AP
stories on its website.</p>
<p>A law passed in 2023 mandates that all adoption records be
transferred from private agencies to a government department called the
National Center for the Rights of the Child by July, to centralize the
handling of family search requests. The center has confirmed that
private agencies hold about 170,000 adoption files, but director Chung
Ick-Joong doubts it will acquire a space to store and manage all these
records in time, due to financial constraints and other challenges. The
agency expects family search requests to increase dramatically –
“possibly by tenfold,” according to Chung — yet has funding to add only
five staff members to its team of six searchers.</p>
<p>Chung acknowledged that flaws in adoption laws had persisted for
decades, and Korea only required adoptions to go through courts and
birth records to be preserved after 2012.</p>
<p>“It’s difficult to determine who was responsible for the inaccuracies
in records before then,” he said. “The adoption agency might have been
at fault, the biological parents may have lied, or something might have
gone wrong at the orphanage … no one truly knows what the truth is.”</p>
<p>Korean adoption agencies have mostly declined AP’s requests for
comment in recent months, often citing privacy concerns.</p>
<p>Advocates insist that most adoptive families thrive, with both the
parents and children happily living their lives without questioning the
industry as Reif and Hamilton have.</p>
<p>Hamilton grew up in a rural, almost exclusively white community in
Wisconsin, and back then all she wanted was to be accepted. But having
children of her own changed that. When her first child was born, she
looked at him, and it took her breath away.</p>
<p>“It can’t explain it, like this is the first person I know in my life
that I’m biologically related to,” she said.</p>
<p>She wanted to learn her own history, so her children could know
theirs. She wrote a letter to her adoption agency, which within weeks
connected her with a woman they said was her mother. It was emotional,
shocking.</p>
<p>But soon she felt like she had more questions than answers. The
woman’s name didn’t match the one listed on paperwork, and the name she
gave for the father was also different. Birthdates didn’t match, the
birthplace didn’t either. They had not met in a factory, she said, they
had been pen pals.</p>
<p>Hamilton asked the woman to take a DNA test, but she said she didn’t
know how to access one. Hamilton came to believe this woman was not her
birth mother.</p>
<p>The AP’s reporting found numerous cases where agencies connected
adoptees with supposed birth families, only for them to later discover
after emotional meetings that they weren’t related at all.</p>
<p>Hamilton has been trying to untangle the DNA results on her father’s
side, contacting people distantly related, cousins once removed, half
great aunts.</p>
<p>“It becomes an obsession,” Hamilton said. “It’s like a puzzle that
you start, and you have to find the missing pieces.”</p>
<p>Lynelle Long, the founder of InterCountry Adoptee Voices, the largest
organization of adoptees in the world, said governments at the very
least need to legally mandate that agencies provide adoptees with their
full and redacted documents, without the payment now often required.</p>
<p>Long said parents like Reif have an important role, because in
Western countries, laws always favored the desires of adoptive parents —
designed to make adoptions quicker and easier. Many clung to the
narrative that they saved needy orphans who should be grateful, she
said, especially in the U.S., where the reckoning rocking Europe has not
taken hold.</p>
<p>“We really need adoptive parents in the United States, if they have
any inkling of guilt or shame or loss, to step up, take responsibility
and demand that legislation be put in place to criminalize these
practices and prevent it from ever happening again,” Long said.</p>
<p>Hamilton is close to her parents; she just renovated the basement to
accommodate their visits. She’s sad for herself, she said, but she’s
sadder for her mother, who is desperate to learn if her children
actually had parents somewhere, searching for them.</p>
<p>“And I’m like, ’Why, so you can send us back?” Hamilton said. “I
don’t want to be a victim.”</p>
<p>She said she’s glad she was adopted, and does not long for that
different, alternative life in Korea.</p>
<p>Reif loves her children profoundly, she said. But she doesn’t think
she would adopt from abroad again, if she’d known then what she knows
now.</p>
<p>“I’d rather be childless than think I have somebody else’s child that
didn’t want to give them up,” she said. “I think of somebody taking my
child. Those poor families, I just can’t imagine it.”</p>

<h2 id="our-county-ignored-africa-jimmy-carter-said.-he-didnt">‘Our
county ignored Africa,’ Jimmy Carter said. He didn’t</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NAIROBI, KENYA — Jimmy Carter was the first U.S. president to make a
state visit to sub-Saharan Africa. He once called helping with
Zimbabwe’s transition from white rule to independence “our greatest
single success.” And when he died at 100, his foundation’s work in rural
Africa had nearly fulfilled his quest to eliminate a disease that
afflicted millions, for the first time since the eradication of
smallpox.</p>
<p>The African continent, a booming region with a population rivaling
China’s that is set to double by 2050, is where Carter’s legacy remains
most evident. Until his presidency, U.S. leaders had shown little
interest in Africa, even as independence movements swept the region in
the 1960s and ’70s.</p>
<p>“I think the day of the so-called ugly American is over,” Carter said
during his warm 1978 reception in Nigeria, Africa’s most populous
country. He said the official state visit swept aside “past aloofness by
the United States,” and he joked that he and Nigerian President Olesegun
Obasanjo would go into peanut farming together.</p>
<p>Cold War tensions drew Carter’s attention to the continent as the
U.S. and Soviet Union competed for influence. But Carter also drew on
the missionary traditions of his Baptist faith and the racial injustice
he witnessed in his homeland in the U.S. South.</p>
<p>“For too long our country ignored Africa,” Carter told the Democratic
National Committee in his first year as president.</p>
<p>African leaders soon received invitations to the White House,
intrigued by the abrupt interest from the world’s most powerful nation
and what it could mean for them.</p>
<p>“There is an air of freshness which is invigorating,” visiting
Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda said.</p>
<p>Carter observed after his first Africa trip, “There is a common theme
that runs through the advice to me of leaders of African nations: ‘We
want to manage our own affairs. We want to be friends with both of the
great superpowers and also with the nations of Europe. We don’t want to
choose up sides.’”</p>
<p>The theme echoes today as China also jostles with Russia and the U.S.
for influence, and access to Africa’s raw materials. But neither
superpower has had an emissary like Carter, who made human rights
central to U.S. foreign policy and made 43 more trips to the continent
after his presidency, promoting Carter Center projects that sought to
empower Africans to determine their own futures.</p>
<p>As president, Carter focused on civil and political rights. He later
broadened his efforts to include social and economic rights as the key
to public health.</p>
<p>“They are the rights of the human by virtue of their humanity. And
Carter is the single person in the world that has done the most for
advancing this idea,” said Abdullahi Ahmed An-Naim, a Sudanese legal
scholar.</p>
<p>Even as a candidate, Carter mused about what he might accomplish,
telling Playboy magazine, “it might be that now I should drop my
campaign for president and start a crusade for black-majority rule in
South Africa or Rhodesia [now Zimbabwe]. It might be that later on,
we’ll discover there were opportunities in our lives to do wonderful
things and we didn’t take advantage of them.”</p>
<p>Carter welcomed Zimbabwe’s independence just four years later,
hosting new Prime Minister Robert Mugabe at the White House and quoting
the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.: “Injustice anywhere is a threat to
justice everywhere.”</p>
<p>“Carter told me that he spent more time on Rhodesia than he did on
the entire Middle East. And when you go into the archives and look at
the administration, there is indeed more on southern Africa than the
Middle East,” historian and author Nancy Mitchell said.</p>
<p>Relations with Mugabe’s government soon soured amid deadly repression
and by 1986 Carter led a walkout of diplomats in the capital. In 2008,
Carter was barred from Zimbabwe, a first in his travels. He called the
country “a basket case, an embarrassment to the region.”</p>
<p>“Whatever the Zimbabwean leadership may think of him now,
Zimbabweans, at least those who were around in the 1970s and ’80s, will
always regard him as an icon and a tenacious promoter of democracy,”
said Eldred Masunungure, a Harare-based political analyst.</p>
<p>Carter also criticized South Africa’s government for its treatment of
Black citizens under apartheid, at a time when South Africa was “trying
to ingratiate itself with influential economies around the world,”
current President Cyril Ramaphosa said on X after Carter’s death.</p>
<p>The think tank Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter founded in 1982 played a key
role in monitoring African elections and brokering ceasefires between
warring forces, but fighting disease was the third pillar of The Carter
Center’s work.</p>
<p>“The first time I came here to Cape Town, I almost got in a fight
with the president of South Africa, Thabo Mbeki, because he was refusing
to let AIDS be treated,” Carter told a local newspaper. “That’s the
closest I’ve come to getting into a fist fight with a head of
state.”</p>
<p>Carter often said he was determined to outlive the last guinea worm
infecting the human race. Once affecting millions of people, the
parasitic disease has nearly been eliminated, with just 14 cases
documented in 2023 in a handful of African countries.</p>
<p>Carter’s quest included arranging a four-month “guinea worm
cease-fire” in Sudan in 1995 so that The Carter Center could reach
almost 2,000 endemic villages.</p>
<p>“He taught us a lot about having faith,” said Makoy Samuel Yibi, who
leads the guinea worm eradication program for South Sudan’s health
ministry and grew up with people who believed the disease was simply
their fate. “Even the poor people call these people poor, you see. To
have the leader of the free world pay attention and try to uplift them
is a touching virtue.”</p>
<p>Such dedication impressed health officials in Africa over the
years.</p>
<p>“President Carter worked for all humankind irrespective of race,
religion, or status,” Ethiopia’s former health minister, Lia Tadesse,
said in a statement shared with the AP. Ethiopia, the continent’s second
most populous country with over 110 million people, had zero guinea worm
cases in 2023.</p>

id="italys-meloni-boosts-ties-with-trump-in-surprise-florida-visit">Italy’s
Meloni boosts ties with Trump in surprise Florida visit</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WEST PALM BEACH, FLORIDA — Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni made
a surprise trip to Florida to meet with Donald Trump late on Saturday,
as the key European leader sought to buttress ties with the
president-elect before his inauguration on January 20. </p>
<p>Members of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort welcomed Meloni with applause
after an introduction by the president-elect, according to videos shared
on social media by reporters and others. </p>
<p>“This is very exciting. I’m here with a fantastic woman, the prime
minister of Italy,” Trump told the Mar-a-Lago crowd, according to a
media pool report. “She’s really taken Europe by storm.” </p>
<p>Meloni is seen as a potentially strong partner for Trump given her
conservative credentials and the stability of the right-wing coalition
she has led in Italy since late 2022. </p>
<p>She has also forged a close relationship with billionaire tech CEO
Elon Musk, a close Trump ally who spent more than a quarter of a billion
dollars to help him win the election. </p>
<p>Tommaso Foti, Italy’s EU and regional affairs minister, said on
Sunday that the meeting, which had not been announced in advance, showed
that Italy could act as “a diplomatic bridge between two worlds: the
European Union and the USA.” </p>
<p>Meloni’s trip comes days before she is to meet U.S. President Joe
Biden during a visit to Rome from Thursday to Jan. 12. Trump defeated
Biden in the November election and is preparing to return to the White
House. </p>
<p>While no details of their meeting have been disclosed, Meloni had
planned to talk with Trump about Russia’s war in Ukraine, trade issues,
the Middle East and the plight of an Italian journalist detained in
Tehran, according to Italian media reports. </p>
<p>Trump and Meloni watched a screening of a documentary questioning the
criminal investigations and legal scrutiny faced by John Eastman, a
former Trump lawyer who was central to Trump’s unsuccessful efforts to
overturn his 2020 election loss. </p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges facing Meloni is the arrest of Italian
journalist Cecilia Sala in Iran on Dec. 19. </p>
<p>Sala was detained three days after Mohammad Abedini, an Iranian
businessman, was arrested at Milan’s Malpensa airport on a U.S. warrant
for allegedly supplying drone parts that Washington says were used in a
2023 attack that killed three U.S. service members in Jordan. Iran has
denied involvement in the attack. </p>
<p>Meloni became the latest in the handful of foreign leaders who have
visited Trump in Florida since the Nov. 5 election. He has met with
Argentinian President Javier Milei, Prime Minister Viktor Orban of
Hungary, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.</p>

id="jimmy-carters-state-funeral-has-started.-heres-what-to-know">Jimmy
Carter’s state funeral has started. Here’s what to know</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ATLANTA, GEORGIA — Six days of funeral observances for former
President Jimmy Carter began Saturday in Georgia, where he died on
Dec. 29 at the age of 100.</p>
<p>The first events reflected Carter’s climb up the political ladder,
from the tiny town of Plains, Georgia, to decades on the global stage as
a humanitarian and advocate for democracy.</p>
<p>Here is what to know about the initial ceremonies and what happens
next:</p>
<p>The start honors Carter’s deep roots in rural south Georgia</p>
<p>The proceedings began at 10:15 a.m. local time Saturday with the
Carter family arriving at Phoebe Sumter Medical Center in Americus.</p>
<p>Former Secret Service agents who protected Carter served as
pallbearers, walking alongside the hearse as it exited the campus on its
way to Plains.</p>
<p>James Earl Carter Jr. lived more than 80 of his 100 years in and
around the town, which still has fewer than 700 people, not much more
than when he was born on Oct. 1, 1924. Some other modern presidents —
Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton — also grew up in
small-town settings but Carter stands out for returning and remaining in
his birthplace for his long post-presidency.</p>
<p>The motorcade moved through downtown Plains, which spans just a few
blocks, passing near the girlhood home of former first lady Rosalynn
Smith Carter, who died in November 2023 at the age of 96, and near where
the couple operated the family peanut warehouses. The route also
included the old train depot that served as Jimmy Carter’s 1976
presidential campaign headquarters and the gas station once run by
Carter’s younger brother, Billy.</p>
<p>The motorcade passed by the Methodist church where the Carters
married in 1946, and the home where they lived and died. The former
president will be buried there alongside Rosalynn.</p>
<p>The Carters built the one-story house, now surrounded by Secret
Service fencing, before his first state Senate campaign in 1962 and
lived out their lives there with the exception of four years in the
Governor’s Mansion and four more in the White House.</p>
<p>A stop at Carter’s boyhood home — a blend of privilege, hard work</p>
<p>After going through Plains, the procession stopped in front of
Carter’s family farm and boyhood home in Archery, just outside the town,
after passing the cemetery where the former president’s parents, James
Earl Carter Sr. and Lillian Carter, are buried.</p>
<p>The farm now is part of the Jimmy Carter National Historical Park.
The National Park Service rang the old farm bell 39 times to honor the
39th president.</p>
<p>Carter was the first president born in a hospital. But the home had
no electricity or running water when he was born, and he worked his
father’s land during the Great Depression. Still, the Carters had
relative privilege and status. Earl employed Black tenant farming
families. The elder Carter also owned a store in Plains and was a local
civic and political leader. Lillian was a nurse and she delivered
Rosalynn. The property still includes a tennis court Earl had built for
the family.</p>
<p>It was Earl’s death in 1953 that set Jimmy on course toward the Oval
Office. The younger Carters had left Plains after he graduated from the
U.S. Naval Academy. But Jimmy abandoned a promising career as a
submarine officer and early participant in the Pentagon’s nuclear
program to take over the family’s peanut business after his father’s
death. Within a decade, he was elected to the Georgia state Senate.</p>
<p>Lying in repose in Atlanta, where Carter was a politician and global
figure</p>
<p>From Archery, the motorcade headed north to Atlanta. The military-run
motorcade stopped outside the Georgia Capitol, where Carter served as a
state senator from 1963-67 and governor from 1971-75. Georgia Gov. Brian
Kemp and Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens led a moment of silence. While
former governors are honored with state-run funerals, presidents — even
if they served as governors — are memorialized with national rites run
by the federal government.</p>
<p>The motorcade then proceeded to the Carter Presidential Center, which
includes Carter’s presidential library and The Carter Center,
established by the former president and first lady in 1982. Carter’s
son, James Earl “Chip” Carter III, and his grandson, Jason Carter, spoke
to an assembly that included many Carter Center employees whose work
concentrating on international diplomacy and mediation, election
monitoring, and fighting disease in the developing world continues to
set a standard for what former presidents can accomplish.</p>
<p>Jimmy Carter, who delivered the center’s annual reports until 2019,
won the 2002 Nobel Peace Prize in part for this post-presidential
work.</p>
<p>Carter was scheduled to lie in repose from 7 p.m. Saturday to 6 a.m.
Tuesday, with the public able to pay respects around the clock.</p>
<p>What’s next: A return to Washington</p>
<p>Carter’s remains will travel next to Washington, where he will lie in
state in the Capitol Rotunda until his funeral at 10 a.m. Thursday at
the Washington National Cathedral. All the living presidents have been
invited, and Joe Biden, a Carter ally, will deliver a eulogy. Biden also
signed a bill to name a U.S. Postal Service facility in Plains after
Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter.</p>
<p>The Carter family then will return to bury its patriarch in Plains
after a private hometown funeral at 3:45 p.m. at Maranatha Baptist
Church, where Carter, a devout evangelical, taught Sunday School for
decades.</p>
<p>Carter will be buried afterward in a private graveside service, in a
plot visible from the front porch of his home.</p>

<h2 id="feds-kugler-daly-say-job-not-done-on-inflation">Fed’s Kugler,
Daly say job not done on inflation</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Two Federal Reserve policymakers said Saturday they feel the U.S.
central bank’s job on taming inflation is not yet done, but also
signaled they do not want to risk damaging the labor market as they try
to finish that job. </p>
<p>The remarks, from Governor Adriana Kugler and San Francisco Fed
President Mary Daly, highlight the delicate balancing act facing U.S.
central bankers this year as they look to slow their pace of rate
cutting. The Fed lowered short-term rates by a full percentage point
last year, to a current range of 4.25%-4.50%. </p>
<p>Inflation by the Fed’s preferred measure is well down from its
mid-2022 peak of around 7%, registering 2.4% in November. Still, that’s
above the Fed’s 2% goal, and in December policymakers projected slower
progress toward that goal than they had earlier anticipated. </p>
<p>“We are fully aware that we are not there yet — no one is popping
champagne anywhere,” Kugler said at the annual American Economic
Association conference in San Francisco, California. “And at the same
time … we want the unemployment rate to stay where it is” and not
increase rapidly. </p>
<p>In November, unemployment was 4.2%, consistent in both her and
colleague Daly’s view with maximum employment, the Fed’s second goal
alongside its price stability goal. </p>
<p>“At this point, I would not want to see further slowing in the labor
market — maybe gradually moving around in bumps and chunks on a given
month, but certainly not additional slowing in the labor market,” said
Daly, who was speaking on the same panel. </p>
<p>The policymakers were not asked, nor did they volunteer their views,
about the potential impact of incoming President-elect Donald Trump’s
economic policies, including tariffs and tax cuts, which some have
speculated could fuel growth and reignite inflation.</p>

Biden gets priciest gift from foreign leader in 2023 — a $20,000
diamond</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden and his family were given tens of
thousands of dollars in gifts from foreign leaders in 2023, according to
an annual accounting published by the State Department on Thursday, with
first lady Jill Biden receiving the single most expensive present: a
$20,000 diamond from India’s leader.</p>
<p>The 7.5-carat diamond from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was
easily the most costly gift presented to any member of the first family
in 2023, although she also received a brooch valued at $14,063 from the
Ukrainian ambassador to the United States and a bracelet, brooch and
photograph album worth $4,510 from the president and first lady of
Egypt.</p>
<p>The U.S. president himself received a number of expensive presents,
including a commemorative photo album valued at $7,100 from South
Korea’s recently impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol , a $3,495 statue of
Mongolian warriors from the Mongolian prime minister, a $3,300 silver
bowl from the sultan of Brunei, a $3,160 sterling silver tray from the
president of Israel, and a collage worth $2,400 from Ukrainian President
Volodymyr Zelenskyy.</p>
<p>Federal law requires executive branch officials to declare gifts they
receive from foreign leaders and counterparts that have an estimated
value of more than $480. Many of the gifts that meet that threshold are
relatively modest, and the more expensive ones are typically — but not
always — transferred to the National Archives or put on official
displays.</p>
<p>The $20,000 diamond was retained for official use in the White House
East Wing, according to a State Department document, while the other
gifts to the president and first lady were sent to the archives.</p>
<p>Vanessa Valdivia, a spokesperson for Jill Biden, said the diamond
will be turned over to the archives after they leave office. She did not
say what it was being used for.</p>
<p>Ukraine’s ambassador, Oksana Markarova, said Friday on Facebook that
a Ukrainian designer fashioned the brooch from the remains of a Russian
rocket and that the piece was made from inexpensive materials, so its
“true value … lies in its symbolism.” The embassy’s spokesperson, Halyna
Yusypiuk, said U.S. officials provided the assessed value.</p>
<p>Recipients have the option to purchase the gift from the U.S.
government at its market value, although that is rare, particularly with
high-end items.</p>
<p>According to the State Department’s Office of Protocol, which
compiles the list that will be published in Friday’s edition of the
Federal Register, several employees of the CIA reported receiving lavish
gifts of watches, perfume and jewelry, nearly all of which were
destroyed. Of the gifts destroyed, they were worth more than $132,000
combined.</p>
<p>CIA Director William Burns received a $18,000 astrograph, which is a
telescope and astrological camera, from a foreign source whose identity
is classified. That is being transferred to the General Services
Administration. But Burns reported receiving and destroying an $11,000
Omega watch, while numerous others did the same with luxury
timepieces.</p>
<p>Below the rank of director, the CIA employees who reported gifts are
not identified, but one of them logged an Omega Seamaster Aqua Terra
watch, a ladies Omega Constellation watch, a diamond necklace, earring
bracelet set, and a ring that were valued together at $65,100.</p>
<p>All of those were destroyed, according to the report, as was a
$30,000 women’s jewelry set from the Libyan jeweler Al Grew consisting
of a necklace, bracelet, ring and earrings received by another CIA
employee.</p>
<p>Another CIA employee reported receiving a men’s Yacht Master II Rolex
Oyster Perpetual watch worth $18,700, another reported getting a lady’s
Rolex Oyster Datejust watch valued at $12,500, and one other got a
$7,450 Rolex Air King watch. All three of the watches were destroyed,
according to the list.</p>
<p>Another employee reported receiving a collection of pricey Amouage
Perfume worth $10,670, the destruction of which is pending, the report
says.</p>

finds more records found linking Credit Suisse, Nazi accounts</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — An investigation by a U.S. Senate panel has found that
troubled investment bank Credit Suisse concealed information during
previous inquiries into Nazi-controlled bank accounts during World War
II.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of documents discovered during an ongoing
examination have provided new proof of the existence of account holders
linked to the Nazis, the Senate Budget Committee said in a statement
released Saturday.</p>
<p>The bank did not reveal the existence of these accounts during
previous investigations, notably in the 1990s, the committee said.</p>
<p>Credit Suisse, now a subsidiary of investment bank UBS, agreed in
1998 to take part in a $1.25 billion settlement of lawsuits brought by
Holocaust survivors, but it has been accused of not being completely
open about its past dealings with Nazis.</p>
<p>The Senate committee said Saturday that one set of newly discovered
files, including 3,600 physical documents and 40,000 microfilms, was
found to have a “high relevance rate” of Nazi connections.</p>
<p>It said the revelations stem from an interim report by former
prosecutor Neil Barofsky, who was fired as an “independent ombudsperson”
by the bank in 2022 after being pressed to limit his investigative
work.</p>
<p>Barofsky was reinstated in the role in 2023 “as a result of the
committee’s investigation,” and after UBS’s takeover of Credit
Suisse.</p>
<p>In a letter to the panel released Saturday, Barofsky noted the
“extraordinary level of cooperation that Credit Suisse, under the
leadership of UBS, has provided” since he rejoined the company.</p>
<p>But he said Credit Suisse had yet to share all the information it
held.</p>
<p>The Barofsky team has discovered, among other things, accounts
controlled by high-ranking SS officers, The Wall Street Journal
reported.</p>
<p>In his letter, Barofsky highlighted “especially noteworthy”
discoveries from a Credit Suisse research department.</p>
<p>“Numerous client files in the sample are marked with a stamp stating
‘Amerikanische schwarze Liste’ — meaning ‘American Black List’ — a list
maintained by the Allies of individuals and companies that were directly
financed by, or were known to regularly trade with, Axis powers,” he
wrote.</p>
<p>“One file bearing this stamp relates to an entity that was involved
in selling looted Jewish assets,” he added.</p>
<p>Contacted by AFP, UBS said it was committed to providing a complete
record of the former Nazi-linked accounts in Credit Suisse’s predecessor
banks.</p>
<p>It said it would provide Barofsky with all necessary assistance in
his work to shed light “on this tragic period.”</p>
<p>The Senate panel’s investigation is continuing.</p>

id="tesla-data-helped-police-after-truck-explosion-experts-have-privacy-concerns">Tesla
data helped police after truck explosion; experts have privacy
concerns</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Your car is spying on you. </p>
<p>That is one takeaway from the fast, detailed data that Tesla
collected on the driver of one of its Cybertrucks that exploded in Las
Vegas, Nevada, earlier this week. Privacy data experts say the deep dive
by Elon Musk’s company was impressive but also shines a spotlight on a
difficult question as vehicles become less like cars and more like
computers on wheels. </p>
<p>“You might want law enforcement to have the data to crack down on
criminals but can anyone have access to it?” said Jodi Daniels, CEO of
privacy consulting firm Red Clover Advisors.  </p>
<p>Many of the latest cars not only know where you’ve been and where you
are going, but also often have access to your contacts, your call logs,
your texts and other sensitive information thanks to cell phone
syncing. </p>
<p>The data collected by Musk’s electric car company after the
Cybertruck packed with fireworks burst into flames in front of the Trump
International Hotel Wednesday proved valuable to police in helping track
the driver’s movements. </p>
<p>Within hours of the New Year’s Day explosion that burned the driver
beyond recognition and injured seven, Tesla was able to track Matthew
Livelsberger’s movements in detail from Denver to Las Vegas — and
confirm that the problem was explosives in the truck, not the truck
itself. Tesla used data collected from charging stations and from
onboard software. </p>
<p>“I have to thank Elon Musk, specifically,” said Las Vegas
Metropolitan Police Department Sheriff Kevin McMahill to reporters.
 </p>
<p>Some privacy experts were less enthusiastic. </p>
<p>“It reveals the kind of sweeping surveillance going on,” said David
Choffnes, executive director of the Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute
at Northeastern University in Boston. “When something bad happens, it’s
helpful, but it’s a double-edged sword. Companies that collect this data
can abuse it.” </p>
<p>General Motors, for instance, was sued in August by the Texas
attorney general for allegedly selling data from 1.8 million drivers to
insurance companies without their consent. </p>
<p>Cars equipped with cameras to enable self-driving features have added
a new security risk. Tesla itself came under fire after Reuters reported
how employees from 2019 through 2022 shared drivers’ sensitive videos
and recordings with each other, including videos of road rage incidents
and, in one case, nudity. </p>
<p>Tesla did not respond to emailed questions about its privacy policy.
On its website, Tesla says it follows strict rules for keeping names and
information private. </p>
<p>“No one but you would have knowledge of your activities, location, or
a history of where you’ve been,” according to a statement. “Your
information is kept private and secure.” </p>
<p>Auto analyst Sam Abuelsamid at Telemetry Insight, said he doesn’t
think Tesla is “especially worse” than other auto companies in handling
customer data, but he is still concerned. </p>
<p>“This is one of the biggest ethical issues we have around modern
vehicles. They’re connected,” he said. “Consumers need to have control
over their data.” </p>
<p>Tensions were high when the Cybertruck parked at the front doors of
Trump’s hotel began smoking, then burst into flames. Just hours earlier,
a driver in another vehicle using the same peer-to-peer car rental
service, Turo, had killed 15 people after slamming into a crowd in New
Orleans, Louisiana, in what law enforcement is calling a terrorist
attack. </p>
<p>Shortly before 1 p.m., the Las Vegas police announced they were
investigating a second incident. </p>
<p>“The whole Tesla senior team is investigating this matter right now,”
Musk wrote on X. “Will post more information as soon as we learn
anything.” </p>
<p>Over the next few hours, Tesla was able to piece together
Livelsberger’s journey over five days and four states by tracking, among
other things, his recharging stops in various locations, including
Monument, Colorado, Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Flagstaff, Arizona.</p>

<h2 id="drivers-skid-crash-as-winter-storm-grips-central-us">Drivers
skid, crash as winter storm grips central US</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MISSION, KANSAS — Road conditions were deteriorating Saturday in the
central U.S. as a winter storm brought a mix of snow, ice and plunging
temperatures, with forecasts calling for the dreaded combo to spread
eastward in the coming days.</p>
<p>“Winter returned,” said Bob Oravec, lead forecaster at the National
Weather Service in College Park, Maryland.</p>
<p>The polar vortex of ultra-cold air usually stays penned up around the
North Pole, spinning like a top. But sometimes it escapes or stretches
down to the U.S., Europe or Asia — and that’s when large numbers of
people experience intense doses of cold.</p>
<p>Studies show a fast-warming Arctic gets some of the blame for the
increase in polar vortex stretching or wandering.</p>
<p>Snow and ice in forecast</p>
<p>By Saturday evening, widespread heavy snow was likely between central
Kansas and Indiana, especially along and north of Interstate 70, where
there was a high chance of at least 20 centimeters of snow. Part of the
interstate was closed in central Kansas by the afternoon.</p>
<p>The storm was forecast to move then into the Ohio Valley, with severe
travel disruptions expected. It will reach the Mid-Atlantic states
Sunday into Monday, with a hard freeze expected as far south as
Florida.</p>
<p>Severe thunderstorms, with the possibility of tornadoes and hail,
were also possible ahead of the storm system’s cold front as it crosses
the Lower Mississippi Valley, the National Weather Service warned.</p>
<p>Car wrecks</p>
<p>A fire truck, several tractor-trailers and passenger vehicles
overturned west of Salina, Kansas. Rigs also jackknifed and went into
ditches, state Highway Patrol Trooper Ben Gardner said.</p>
<p>He posted a video showing his boots sliding across the highway
blacktop like an ice-skating rink.</p>
<p>“We are in it now,” Gardner said as he drove to the scene of an
accident. Online, he begged for prayers and warned that some roadways
were nearly impassable.</p>
<p>Freezing rain in Wichita, Kansas, sent authorities to multiple
crashes in the morning, and police urged drivers to stay home if
possible and watch out for emergency vehicles.</p>
<p>Governors in neighboring Missouri and nearby Arkansas declared states
of emergency. Whiteout conditions threatened to make driving dangerous
to impossible and heighten the risk of becoming stranded, forecasters
warned.</p>
<p>Getting ready</p>
<p>Stores in Wichita were filled with shoppers stocking up on groceries
in advance of the storm, and warming centers opened in churches and
libraries.</p>
<p>Several businesses closed across the Kansas City area, and the school
district in suburban Independence, Missouri, said it might need to
cancel classes for one or more days.</p>
<p>“Get where you’re going now &amp; stay put. If you must travel,
consider packing a bag &amp; staying where you’re headed,” the Missouri
Department of Transportation said in a message on the social platform
X.</p>
<p>The agency warned Friday that a shortage of workers could hamper the
ability to clear roads.</p>
<p>In Columbus, Ohio, crews treated major roadways with anti-icing
liquids.</p>
<p>“It will be a major headache,” said Tom Kines, a senior meteorologist
with AccuWeather. “The storm not only has the snow threat to it but the
ice threat.”</p>
<p>Power outages could be significant particularly south of the Kansas
City area, Kines said.</p>
<p>Temperatures dip</p>
<p>Starting Monday, the eastern two-thirds of the country will
experience dangerous, bone-chilling cold and wind chills, forecasters
said. Temperatures could be 7 to 14 degrees Celsius below normal as the
polar vortex stretches down from the high Arctic.</p>
<p>In Chicago on Saturday, temperatures hovered near minus 7-10 Celsius
and around minus 18 C in Minneapolis, while dropping to minus 25 C at
International Falls, Minnesota, on the Canadian border.</p>
<p>Disruptions extend southward</p>
<p>Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin declared a state of emergency Friday
evening ahead of the storm and noted it could impact people’s ability to
vote in the state’s special elections Tuesday. In a statement on X, he
encouraged residents to vote Saturday before the bad weather
arrives.</p>
<p>A similar declaration was issued in Maryland, where officials in the
historic state capital near Chesapeake Bay asked residents to remove
vehicles from emergency snow routes. Annapolis also announced plans to
open several garages on Sunday for free parking.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service predicted about 20 to 30 centimeters of
snow for the Annapolis area, with temperatures remaining below freezing
throughout the weekend.</p>
<p>In Baltimore, an extreme weather alert was issued instructing
agencies to provide shelter and assistance for those in need. City
officials said wind chills were expected to dip to minus 10.56 degrees
Celsius overnight Saturday and remain in the teens through Tuesday.</p>

<h2 id="blinken-heads-to-south-korea-japan-france">Blinken heads to
South Korea, Japan, France</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Antony Blinken will embark on what is
expected to be his final overseas trip in office this weekend, traveling
to South Korea, Japan and France. </p>
<p>The State Department announced Friday that Blinken would visit Seoul,
South Korean, Tokyo and Paris beginning Sunday. </p>
<p>In South Korea, which is in the midst of political turmoil following
the impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol, and Japan, Blinken intends
to highlight the expansion of U.S. cooperation with both nations as part
of the Biden administration’s Indo-Pacific strategy. </p>
<p>That strategy is primarily intended to blunt Chinese ambitions in the
region but also to deter the nuclear threat from North Korea. Political
developments in South Korea, however, after Yoon declared martial law
and was later impeached, have raised questions about the stability of
Washington-Seoul relations. </p>
<p>The U.S. has taken a cautious approach to the uncertainty, insisting
that the U.S.-South Korea alliance remains intact and iron-clad. Blinken
will speak with South Korean officials about how “to build on our
critical cooperation on challenges around the world based on our shared
values,” the State Department said in a statement. </p>
<p>In Tokyo, Blinken will “review the tremendous progress the U.S.-Japan
alliance has made over the past few years,” the statement said. That
includes a major arms sales approval announced on Friday under which the
U.S. will deliver some $3.64 billion in medium-range missiles, related
equipment and training to Japan. </p>
<p>China has repeatedly complained about the potential sale, saying it
will affect stability and security in the region, allegations that both
Japan and the U.S. reject. </p>
<p>Blinken will wrap up his trip in Paris in meetings with French
officials to discuss developments in the Middle East and European
security, particularly in Ukraine.</p>

id="exiled-venezuelan-opposition-leader-to-visit-us-speak-with-biden">Exiled
Venezuelan opposition leader to visit US, speak with Biden</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BUENOS AIRES, ARGENTINA — Venezuelan opposition politician Edmundo
Gonzalez Urrutia, who fled the country after a tumultuous election and
subsequent police crackdown, said Saturday he plans to speak with U.S.
President Joe Biden. </p>
<p>Speaking in Argentina, where he met with President Javier Milei,
Gonzalez added that he was traveling to the United States on Sunday,
though it was unclear when the conversation with Biden would take
place. </p>
<p>“We are planning a conversation with President Biden, and we are
waiting for definitions regarding the new authorities,” Gonzalez said in
the Argentine capital, Buenos Aires, referring to incoming
President-elect Donald Trump, who is set to take over on January
20. </p>
<p>Gonzalez’s meeting with Milei came at the start of a regional tour
aimed at building international support for the man Venezuela’s
opposition considers the rightful president-elect. </p>
<p>The 75-year-old appeared alongside Milei on a balcony of the Casa
Rosada, the Argentine president’s official workplace, as hundreds of
Venezuelans gathered below on the Plaza de Mayo chanted “Venezuela, you
are not alone!” </p>
<p>The appearance came just days before Gonzalez’s rival, Nicolas
Maduro, is set to be sworn in for a third presidential term in
Caracas. </p>
<p>The United States, the European Union and dozens of other countries
say Venezuelan election officials manipulated the vote results, which
they have yet to publish in detail, of the July 28 elections.  </p>
<p>Some countries instead have recognized Gonzalez as the  winner. </p>
<p>Gonzalez arrived in Buenos Aires quietly from Madrid, where he has
lived in exile since fleeing Venezuela in September. Authorities in
Caracas have offered a reward of $100,000 for information leading to his
capture. </p>
<p>Street protests erupted after the election and degenerated into
clashes with police, with 28 people dead, 200 injured and more than
2,400 arrested. </p>
<p>Gonzalez’s schedule calls for him to visit Uruguay late Saturday,
Panama on Wednesday and the Dominican Republic the day after. </p>
<p>He has said he will be in Caracas on January 10 to be sworn in as
president. It remains unclear how the Maduro government will
respond. </p>
<p>Gonzalez’s visit to Argentina came amid heightened bilateral tensions
following the arrest in Venezuela of an Argentine policeman on what
Buenos Aires says are trumped up charges of terrorism. </p>
<p>The relationship was already strained following an exchange of
insults and, ultimately, Argentina’s refusal to recognize Maduro’s
victory claim. </p>
<p>The Argentine Embassy in Caracas has also been sheltering six
opposition figures accused of “terrorism,” a matter Gonzalez had said he
would take up with Milei.</p>

honors Clinton, Bono, Goodall, others for contributions</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — In the East Room of the White House on a particularly
frigid Saturday afternoon, President Joe Biden bestowed the Presidential
Medal of Freedom to 19 of the most famous names in politics, sports,
entertainment, civil rights, LGBTQ+ advocacy and science. </p>
<p>Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton aroused a standing ovation
from the crowd as she received her medal. Clinton was accompanied to the
event by her husband former President Bill Clinton, daughter Chelsea
Clinton and grandchildren. Democratic philanthropist George Soros and
actor-director Denzel Washington were also awarded the nation’s highest
civilian honor in a White House ceremony. </p>
<p>“For the final time as president I have the honor [of] bestowing the
Medal of Freedom, our nation’s highest civilian honor, on a group of
extraordinary, truly extraordinary people, who gave their sacred effort,
their sacred effort, to shape the culture and the cause of America,”
Biden said in his opening remarks. </p>
<p>“Let me just say to each of you, thank you, thank you, thank you for
all you’ve done to help this country,” Biden said Saturday. </p>
<p>4 medals awarded posthumously</p>
<p>Four medals were awarded posthumously. They went to George W. Romney,
who served as both a Michigan governor and secretary of housing and
urban development; former Attorney General and Senator Robert F.
Kennedy; Ash Carter, a former secretary of defense; and Fannie Lou
Hamer, who founded the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party and laid the
groundwork for the 1965 Voting Rights Act. </p>
<p>Kennedy is father to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald
Trump’s nominee for health and human services secretary. Biden said,
“Bobby is one of my true political heroes. I love and I miss him
dearly.” </p>
<p>Romney is the father of former Utah Republican Senator Mitt Romney,
one of Trump’s strongest conservative critics. </p>
<p>Recipients made ‘exemplary contributions’</p>
<p>Biden has days left in the presidential office and has spent the last
few days issuing awards and medals to valiant military veterans,
courageous law enforcement officials and exceptional Americans. </p>
<p>The White House said the Medal of Freedom recipients have made
“exemplary contributions to the prosperity, values, or security of the
United States, world peace, or other significant societal, public or
private endeavors.” </p>
<p>Major philanthropists receiving the award include Spanish American
chef Jose Andres, whose World Central Kitchen charity has become one of
the world’s most recognized food relief organizations, and Bono, the
front man for rock band U2 and a social justice activist. </p>
<p>Soros’ son Alex Soros accepted the medal on his father’s behalf. In
an emailed statement, Soros said: “As an immigrant who found freedom and
prosperity in America, I am deeply moved by this honor.” </p>
<p>Sports and entertainment stars recognized include professional soccer
player Lionel Messi, who did not attend the event; retired Los Angeles
Lakers basketball legend and businessman Earvin “Magic” Johnson; actor
Michael J. Fox, who is an outspoken advocate for Parkinson’s disease
research and development; and William Sanford Nye, known to generations
of students as “Bill Nye the Science Guy.” </p>
<p>Other awardees include conservationist Jane Goodall; longtime
Vogue magazine editor-in-chief Anna Wintour; American fashion designer
Ralph Lauren; American Film Institute founder George Stevens Jr.;
entrepreneur and LGBTQ+ activist Tim Gill; and David Rubenstein,
co-founder of The Carlyle Group global investment firm. </p>
<p>Lauren is the first fashion designer to receive the honor. </p>
<p>Last year, Biden bestowed the Presidential Medal of Freedom on 19
people, including the late Medgar Evers, House Speaker Emerita Nancy
Pelosi, Representative James Clyburn of South Carolina and actor
Michelle Yeoh. </p>
<p>The Presidential Medal of Freedom was awarded 654 times between 1963
and 2024, according to the Congressional Research Service. Notable Medal
of Freedom recipients from the past include Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.,
Maya Angelou and Mother Teresa.</p>

William saddened by death of former nanny’s stepson in New Orleans
attack</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LONDON — Prince William expressed his shock and sadness Saturday at
the news of the death of his former nanny’s stepson in the New Year’s
truck attack in New Orleans that killed 14 people.</p>
<p>London’s Metropolitan Police confirmed Saturday that they are
supporting the family of 31-year-old Edward Pettifer, including helping
them through the process of returning his body to the United Kingdom.
Pettifer, who is from west London, is the final victim to be
identified.</p>
<p>In a statement on social media, the Prince of Wales said he and his
wife, Catherine, were “shocked and saddened by the tragic death of Ed
Pettifer. Our thoughts and prayers remain with the Pettifer family and
all those innocent people who have been tragically impacted by this
horrific attack.”</p>
<p>Pettifer was the stepson of Tiggy Legge-Bourke, who was the nanny for
William and his brother, Prince Harry, between 1993 and 1999, which
included the time after the death of their mother, Princess Diana, in
1997. Legge-Bourke, who is also known as Alexandra Pettifer, was
regularly photographed with Diana.</p>
<p>British media also reported that King Charles III is said to be
deeply saddened by the news and that he has sent his condolences to
Pettifer’s family.</p>
<p>In a statement, Pettifer’s family said they were “devastated at the
tragic news of Ed’s death” and described him as “a wonderful son,
brother, grandson, nephew and a friend to so many.”</p>
<p>“We will all miss him terribly. Our thoughts are with the other
families who have lost their family members due to this terrible
attack,” the family added.</p>
<p>Authorities say 14 people were killed and about 30 were injured in
the attack early Wednesday by Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a former U.S. Army
soldier who posted several videos on his Facebook account hours before
the attack previewing the violence he would unleash and proclaiming his
support for the Islamic State militant group. The coroner’s office
listed the cause of death for all 14 victims as “blunt force
injuries.”</p>
<p>Jabbar, 42, was fatally shot in a firefight with police at the scene
of the deadly crash on Bourbon Street, famous worldwide for its festive
vibes in New Orleans’ historic French Quarter.</p>

notifies Congress of planned $8 billion weapons sale to Israel</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. State Department has informed Congress of a
planned $8 billion weapons sale to Israel, U.S. officials say, as the
American ally presses forward with its war against Hamas in Gaza.</p>
<p>Some of the arms in the package could be sent from current U.S.
stocks, but the majority would take a year or several years to deliver,
according to two U.S. officials Saturday who spoke on condition of
anonymity because the notification to Congress hasn’t been formally
sent.</p>
<p>The sale includes medium-range air-to-air missiles to help Israel
defend against airborne threats, 155 mm projectile artillery shells for
long-range targeting, Hellfire AGM-114 missiles, 500-pound bombs and
more.</p>
<p>The weapons package would add to a record of at least $17.9 billion
in military aid that the U.S. has provided Israel since the Hamas terror
attack on Oct. 7, 2023, launched the war.</p>
<p>The United States, Britain and other Western nations designate Hamas
as a terror group.</p>
<p>The Biden administration has faced criticism over the mounting number
of deaths of Palestinian civilians. There have been demonstrations on
college campuses and unsuccessful efforts in Congress by Senator Bernie
Sanders and some Democrats to block sales of offensive weapons to
Israel.</p>
<p>The United States paused a shipment of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel in
May over concerns about civilian casualties if the bombs were to be used
during an assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah. The Biden
administration has demanded that Israel increase humanitarian aid into
the enclave. But in November, citing some limited progress, it declined
to limit arms transfers as it threatened to do if the situation did not
improve.</p>
<p>In recent days, Israel has been conducting airstrikes in Gaza that
have killed dozens of people, adding to the tens of thousands of deaths
since the war began more than a year ago.</p>
<p>The Israeli army said Friday that it had struck dozens of Hamas
gathering points and command centers throughout Gaza. Israel’s military
says it targets only militants and blames Hamas for civilian deaths
because its fighters operate in dense residential areas.</p>
<p>The war has caused widespread destruction and displaced about 90% of
Gaza’s population of 2.3 million, many of them multiple times. Winter
has now arrived, and hundreds of thousands are sheltering in tents near
the sea.</p>
<p>The informal notice to Congress isn’t the final notification before a
sale. Now the leaders of the House Foreign Affairs Committee or the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee can review the package.</p>
<p>News of the weapons sale was first reported by Axios.</p>

id="new-orleans-attacker-had-suspected-bomb-materials-at-home-officials-say">New
Orleans attacker had suspected bomb materials at home, officials
say</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA — The man who rammed a pickup truck into a
crowd of New Year’s revelers in New Orleans had suspected bomb-making
materials at his home and reserved the vehicle used in the deadly attack
more than six weeks earlier, law enforcement officials told The
Associated Press on Friday.</p>
<p>Federal authorities searching the home of Shamsud-Din Jabbar in
Houston found a workbench in the garage and hazardous materials believed
to have been used to make explosive devices, according to law
enforcement officials familiar with the search. The officials were not
authorized to speak about the ongoing inquiry and spoke to the AP on the
condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>The FBI investigation also revealed that Jabbar purchased a cooler in
Vidor, Texas, hours before the attack and gun oil from a store in
Sulphur, Louisiana, the officials said. Authorities also determined
Jabbar booked his rental of the pickup truck on Nov. 14, suggesting he
may have been plotting the attack for more than six weeks.</p>
<p>Authorities say 14 people were killed and some 30 were injured in the
attack early Wednesday by Jabbar, a former Army soldier who posted
several videos on his Facebook hours before the attack previewing the
violence he would unleash and proclaiming his support for the Islamic
State militant group. The coroner’s office listed the cause of death for
all 14 victims as “blunt force injuries.”</p>
<p>Jabbar, 42, was fatally shot in a firefight with police at the scene
of the deadly crash on Bourbon Street, famous worldwide for its festive
vibes in New Orleans’ historic French Quarter.</p>
<p>Authorities found crude bombs that had been planted in the
neighborhood in an apparent attempt to cause more carnage. Two
improvised explosive devices left in coolers several blocks apart were
rendered safe at the scene, officials said. Other devices were
determined to be nonfunctional.</p>
<p>Investigators recovered from Jabbar’s rental truck a transmitter
intended to trigger the two bombs, the FBI said in a statement Friday.
It also said authorities found bomb-making materials at the New Orleans
home Jabbar rented prior to the attack. Jabbar tried to burn the house
down by setting a small fire in a hallway and placing accelerants to
help spread it, the FBI said. The flames burned out before firefighters
arrived.</p>
<p>Authorities on Friday were still investigating Jabbar’s motives and
how he carried out the attack. They say he exited the crashed truck
wearing a ballistic vest and helmet and fired at police, wounding at
least two officers before he was fatally shot by officers returning
fire.</p>
<p>New Orleans police declined to say Friday how many shots were fired
by Jabbar and police or whether any bystanders may have been hit, citing
the active investigation.</p>
<p>Stella Cziment, who heads the city’s civilian-run Office of the
Independent Police Monitor, said investigators are working to account
for “every single bullet that was fired” and whether any of them struck
bystanders.</p>
<p>Bourbon Street was solemn Friday. A day after the crime scene
reopened to the public, locals and tourists stopped to pay respects to
victims of the attack as the sound of bucket drums echoed. People shed
tears while gathering at a growing memorial. Some left flowers and
candles while others dropped to their knees to say a quick prayer.</p>
<p>“New Orleans is about having a good time, you know, just trying to
live your best life,” said Tony Lightfoot, who works in Baton Rouge and
was visiting New Orleans with his son. He said the attacker “just
decided to disrupt all of that.”</p>
<p>Thirteen people remained hospitalized. Eight people were in intensive
care at University Medical Center New Orleans, spokesperson Carolina
Giepert said.</p>
<p>The White House said President Joe Biden would travel to New Orleans
on Monday to “grieve with the families and community members impacted by
the tragic attack.”</p>
<p>Police used multiple vehicles and barricades on Friday to block
traffic at Bourbon and Canal streets as crowds of pedestrians swelled.
Other law enforcement agencies helped city officers provide extra
security, said Reese Harper, a spokesperson for the New Orleans Police
Department.</p>
<p>The first parade of the Carnival season leading up to Mardi Gras was
scheduled to take place Monday. New Orleans will also host the Super
Bowl on Feb. 9.</p>
<p>“This enhanced safety effort will continue daily, not just during
large events,” Harper said in a statement.</p>
<p>In a previous effort to protect the French Quarter, the city had
installed steel columns known as bollards to restrict vehicle access to
Bourbon Street. The posts retracted to allow for deliveries to bars and
restaurants, until — gummed up by Mardi Gras beads, beer and other
detritus — they stopped working reliably.</p>
<p>So, when New Year’s Eve arrived, the bollards were gone. They were
being replaced ahead of the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, New Orleans City Council President Helena Moreno took
steps toward launching an investigation of the attack. In a memo to
another council member obtained by AP, Moreno said she was initiating
the creation of a local and state legislative committee “dedicated to
reviewing the incident and its implications.”</p>
<p>“This committee will play a crucial role in assessing our current
policies, enhancing security measures, and ensuring that we are
adequately prepared to respond to any future threats,” Moreno wrote.</p>
<p>The FBI concluded Jabbar was not aided by anyone else in the attack,
which killed an 18-year-old aspiring nurse, a single mother, a father of
two and a former Princeton University football star, among others.</p>
<p>Thirteen of the 14 victims have been identified by the New Orleans
coroner’s office, with the youngest listed as 18 and the oldest 63. Most
of the victims were in their 20s. One victim was a British citizen.</p>
<p>It was the deadliest IS-inspired assault on U.S. soil in years,
laying bare what federal officials have warned is a resurgent
international terrorism threat.</p>

<h2 id="how-congress-will-certify-trumps-electoral-college-victory">How
Congress will certify Trump’s electoral college victory</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. congressional joint session to count electoral
votes on Monday is expected to be much less eventful than the
certification four years ago that was interrupted by a violent mob of
supporters of then-President Donald Trump who tried to stop the count
and overturn the results of an election he lost to Democrat Joe
Biden.</p>
<p>This time, Trump is returning to office after winning the 2024
election that began with Biden as his party’s nominee and ended with
Vice President Kamala Harris atop the ticket. She will preside over the
certification of her own loss, fulfilling the constitutional role in the
same way that Trump’s vice president, Mike Pence, did after the violence
subsided on Jan. 6, 2021.</p>
<p>Usually a routine affair, the congressional joint session on Jan. 6
every four years is the final step in reaffirming a presidential
election after the Electoral College officially elects the winner in
December. The meeting is required by the Constitution and includes
several distinct steps.</p>
<p>What happens when Congress meets?</p>
<p>Under federal law, Congress must meet on Jan. 6 to open sealed
certificates from each state that contain a record of their electoral
votes. The votes are brought into the chamber in special mahogany boxes
that are used for the occasion.</p>
<p>Bipartisan representatives of both chambers read the results out loud
and do an official count. The vice president, as president of the
Senate, presides over the session and declares the winner.</p>
<p>The Constitution requires Congress to meet and count the electoral
votes. If there is a tie, then the House decides the presidency, with
each congressional delegation having one vote. That hasn’t happened
since the 1800s and won’t happen this time because Trump’s electoral win
over Harris was decisive, 312-226.</p>
<p>How has it changed since the last time?</p>
<p>Congress tightened the rules for the certification after the violence
of 2021 and Trump’s attempts to usurp the process.</p>
<p>In particular, the revised Electoral Count Act passed in 2022 more
explicitly defines the role of the vice president after Trump
aggressively pushed Pence to object to the Republican’s defeat — an
action that would have gone far beyond Pence’s ceremonial role. Pence
rebuffed Trump and ultimately gaveled down his own defeat. Harris will
do the same.</p>
<p>The updated law clarifies that the vice president does not have the
power to determine the results on Jan. 6.</p>
<p>Harris and Pence were not the first vice presidents to be put in the
uncomfortable position of presiding over their own defeats. In 2001,
Vice President Al Gore presided over the counting of the 2000
presidential election that he narrowly lost to Republican George W.
Bush. Gore had to gavel several Democrats’ objections out of order.</p>
<p>In 2017, Biden as vice president presided over the count that
declared Trump the winner. Biden also shot down objections from House
Democrats that did not have any Senate support.</p>
<p>How does the session unfold?</p>
<p>The presiding officer opens and presents the certificates of the
electoral votes in alphabetical order of the states.</p>
<p>The appointed “tellers” from the House and Senate, members of both
parties, then read each certificate out loud and record and count the
votes. At the end, the presiding officer announces who has won the most
votes for president and vice president.</p>
<p>What if there’s an objection?</p>
<p>After a teller reads the certificate from any state, a lawmaker can
stand up and object to that state’s vote on any grounds. But the
presiding officer will not hear the objection unless it is in writing
and signed by one-fifth of each chamber.</p>
<p>That threshold is significantly higher than what came before.
Previously, a successful objection only required support from one member
of the Senate and one member of the House. Lawmakers raised the
threshold in the 2022 law to make objections more difficult.</p>
<p>If any objection reaches the threshold — something not expected this
time — the joint session suspends, and the House and Senate go into
separate sessions to consider it. For the objection to be sustained,
both chambers must uphold it by a simple majority vote. If they do not
agree, the original electoral votes are counted with no changes.</p>
<p>In 2021, both the House and Senate rejected challenges to the
electoral votes in Arizona and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Before 2021, the last time that such an objection was considered was
2005, when Representative Stephanie Tubbs Jones of Ohio and Senator
Barbara Boxer of California, both Democrats, objected to Ohio’s
electoral votes, claiming there were voting irregularities. The House
and Senate debated the objection and easily rejected it. It was only the
second time such a vote had occurred.</p>
<p>What happens next?</p>
<p>After Congress certifies the vote, the president is inaugurated on
the west front of the Capitol on Jan. 20.</p>
<p>The joint session is the last official chance for objections, beyond
any challenges in court. Harris has conceded and never disputed Trump’s
win.</p>

id="memorials-for-jimmy-carter-start-in-us-state-of-georgia">Memorials
for Jimmy Carter start in US state of Georgia</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ATLANTA, GEORGIA — Six days of funeral observances for former U.S.
President Jimmy Carter began Saturday morning in the state of Georgia,
where he died on December 29 at the age of 100.</p>
<p>The first events reflect Carter’s climb up the political ladder, from
the tiny town of Plains, Georgia, to decades on the global stage as a
humanitarian and advocate for democracy.</p>
<p>Here is what to know about the initial ceremonies and what happens
next:</p>
<p>Honors start in rural Georgia</p>
<p>The proceedings began at 10:15 a.m. local time Saturday with the
Carter family arriving at Phoebe Sumter Medical Center in Americus.</p>
<p>Former Secret Service agents who protected Carter served as
pallbearers, walking alongside the hearse as it exited the campus on its
way to Plains.</p>
<p>James Earl Carter Jr. lived more than 80 of his 100 years in and
around the town, which still has fewer than 700 people, not much more
than when he was born on October 1, 1924. Some other modern presidents —
Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton — also grew up in
small-town settings, but Carter stands out for returning and remaining
in his birthplace for his long post-presidency.</p>
<p>The motorcade moved through downtown Plains, which spans just a few
blocks, passing near the girlhood home of first lady Rosalynn Smith
Carter, who died in November 2023 at the age of 96, and near where the
couple operated the family peanut warehouses. The route also included
the old train depot that served as Jimmy Carter’s 1976 presidential
campaign headquarters and the gas station once run by Carter’s younger
brother Billy.</p>
<p>The motorcade passed by the Methodist church where the Carters
married in 1946, and the home where they lived and died. The former
president will be buried there alongside Rosalynn.</p>
<p>The Carters built the one-story house, now surrounded by Secret
Service fencing, before his first state Senate campaign in 1962 and
lived out their lives there with the exception of four years in the
Governor’s Mansion and four more in the White House.</p>
<p>A stop at Carter’s boyhood home</p>
<p>After going through Plains, the procession stopped in front of
Carter’s family farm and boyhood home in Archery, just outside the town,
after passing the cemetery where the former president’s parents, James
Earl Carter Sr. and Lillian Carter, are buried.</p>
<p>The farm now is part of the Jimmy Carter National Historical Park.
The National Park Service rang the old farm bell 39 times to honor the
39th president.</p>
<p>Carter was the first president born in a hospital. But the home had
no electricity or running water when he was born, and he worked on his
father’s land during the Great Depression.</p>
<p>Still, the Carters had relative privilege and status. Earl employed
Black tenant farming families. The elder Carter also owned a store in
Plains and was a local civic and political leader. Lillian was a nurse,
and she delivered Rosalynn. The property still includes a tennis court
Earl had built for the family.</p>
<p>It was Earl’s death in 1953 that set Jimmy on course toward the Oval
Office. The younger Carters had left Plains after he graduated from the
U.S. Naval Academy. But Jimmy abandoned a promising career as a
submarine officer and early participant in the Pentagon’s nuclear
program to take over the family’s peanut business after his father’s
death. Within a decade, he was elected to the Georgia state Senate.</p>
<p>Lying in repose in Atlanta</p>
<p>From Archery, the motorcade headed north to Atlanta. The military-run
motorcade stopped outside the Georgia Capitol, where Carter served as a
state senator from 1963 to 1967 and governor from 1971 to 1975. Georgia
Governor Brian Kemp and Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens led a moment of
silence. While former governors are honored with state-run funerals,
presidents — even if they served as governors — are memorialized with
national rites run by the federal government. </p>
<p>The motorcade then proceeded to the Carter Presidential Center, which
includes Carter’s presidential library and The Carter Center,
established by the former president and first lady in 1982. Carter’s
son, James Earl “Chip” Carter III, and his grandson, Jason Carter, spoke
to an assembly that included many Carter Center employees. Their work on
international diplomacy and mediation, election monitoring, and fighting
disease in the developing world continues to set a standard for what
former presidents can accomplish. </p>
<p>Jimmy Carter, who delivered the center’s annual reports until 2019,

soldier told ex-girlfriend of pain, exhaustion after Afghanistan</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The highly decorated Special Forces soldier who died by
suicide in a Cybertruck explosion on New Year’s Day confided to a former
girlfriend who had served as an Army nurse that he faced significant
pain and exhaustion that she says were key symptoms of traumatic brain
injury.</p>
<p>Green Beret Matthew Livelsberger, 37, was a five-time recipient of
the Bronze Star, including one with a V device for valor under fire. He
had an exemplary military record that spanned the globe and a baby born
last year. But he struggled with the mental and physical toll of his
service, which required him to kill and caused him to witness the deaths
of fellow soldiers.</p>
<p>Livelsberger mostly bore that burden in private but recently sought
treatment for depression from the Army, according to a U.S. official who
spoke on condition of anonymity to provide details that have not been
made public.</p>
<p>He also found a confidant in the former nurse, who he began dating in
2018.</p>
<p>Alicia Arritt, 39, and Livelsberger met through a dating app while
both were in Colorado Springs. Arritt had served at Landstul Regional
Medical Center in Germany, the largest U.S. military medical facility in
Europe, where many of the worst combat injuries from Iraq and
Afghanistan were initially treated before being flown to the United
States.</p>
<p>There she saw and treated traumatic brain injuries, or TBIs, which
troops suffered from incoming fire and roadside bombs. Serious but hard
to diagnose, such injuries can have lingering effects that might take
years to surface.</p>
<p>“I saw a lot of bad injuries. But the personality changes can happen
later,” Arritt said.</p>
<p>In texts and images he shared with Arritt, Livelsberger raised the
curtain a bit on what he was facing.</p>
<p>“Just some concussions,” he said in a text about a deployment to
Helmand Province in Afghanistan. He sent her a photo of a graphic tattoo
he got on his arm of two skulls pierced by bullets to mark lives he took
in Afghanistan. He talked about exhaustion and pain, not being able to
sleep and reliving the violence of his deployment.</p>
<p>“My life has been a personal hell for the last year,” he told Arritt
during the early days of their dating, according to text messages she
provided to The Associated Press. “It’s refreshing to have such a nice
person come along.”</p>
<p>On Friday, Las Vegas law enforcement officers released excerpts of
messages Livelsberger left behind showing the way Livelsberger killed
himself was intentional, meant both as a “wakeup call” but also to
“cleanse the demons” he was facing from losing fellow soldiers and
taking lives.</p>
<p>Livelsberger’s death in front of the Trump Hotel using a truck
produced by Elon Musk’s Tesla company has raised questions as to whether
this was an act of political violence.</p>
<p>Officials said Friday that Livelsberger apparently harbored no ill
will toward President-elect Donald Trump, and Arritt said she and
Livelsberger were Tesla fans.</p>
<p>“I had a Tesla, too, that I rescued from a junkyard in 2019, and we
used to work on it together, bond over it,” Arritt said.</p>
<p>The pair stopped talking regularly after they broke up in 2021, and
she had not heard from him in more than two years when he texted out of
the blue on Dec. 28, and again on Dec. 31. The upbeat messages included
a video of him driving the Cybertruck and another one of its dancing
headlights; the vehicle can sync up its lighting and music.</p>
<p>But she also said Livelsberger felt things “very deeply, and I could
see him using symbolism” of both the truck and the hotel.</p>
<p>“He wasn’t impulsive,” Arritt said. “I don’t see him doing this
impulsively, so my suspicion would be that he was probably thinking it
out.”</p>
<p>Arritt served on active duty from 2003 to 2007 and then was in the
Army Reserve until 2011. With Livelsberger, she saw symptoms of TBI as
early as 2018.</p>
<p>“He would go through periods of withdrawal, and he struggled with
depression and memory loss,” Arritt said. “I don’t know what drove him
to do this, but I think the military didn’t get him help when he needed
it.”</p>
<p>But Livelsberger was also sweet and kind, she recalled: “He had a
really deep well of inner strength and character, and he just had a lot
of integrity.”</p>
<p>Pentagon Deputy Press Secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters Friday
that it has turned over all Livelsberger’s medical records to local law
enforcement and encouraged troops facing mental health challenges to
seek care through one of the military’s support networks.</p>
<p>“If you need help, if you feel that you need to seek any type of
mental health treatment, or just to talk to someone — to seek the
services that are available, either on base or off,” Singh said.</p>
<p>When Livelsberger struggled during the time they were dating, Arritt
prodded him to get help. But he would not, saying it could cost him his
ability to deploy if he was found medically unfit.</p>
<p>“There was a lot of stigma in his unit; they were, you know, big,
strong, Special Forces guys there. There was no weakness allowed, and
mental health is weakness is what they saw,” she said.</p>
<p>Livelsberger seeking treatment for depression was first reported by
CNN.</p>

id="us-state-of-tennessee-refuses-to-release-its-new-execution-manual">US
state of Tennessee refuses to release its new execution manual</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE — Just days after Tennessee announced it had a
new manual for executing death row inmates, the state’s top prison
officials said they aren’t going to release the document to the
public.</p>
<p>The Tennessee Department of Correction had told The Associated Press
to file a public records request to obtain a copy of the latest
execution manual, known as a protocol. However, the agency this week
denied the AP’s request, saying it needs to keep the entire document
secret to protect the identities of the executioner and other people
involved.</p>
<p>The decision to maintain secrecy differs from how the state has
handled similar requests in the past, but mirrors efforts across the
U.S. to suppress public access surrounding executions, especially after
anti-death penalty activists used records to expose problems.</p>
<p>Here’s what to know:</p>
<p>What is an execution protocol?</p>
<p>The protocol is typically a detailed set of procedures describing how
the state executes death row inmates. Tennessee had been operating under
a 2018 protocol that included directions on selecting execution team
staff and the training they should undergo. It explained how lethal
injection drugs should be procured, stored and administered. It gave
instructions on the inmate’s housing, diet and visitation in the days
leading up to execution. It provided directions on how to choose media
witnesses.</p>
<p>For lethal injection, the 2018 protocol required a series of three
drugs administered in sequence.</p>
<p>The new version unveiled last week requires only a single dose of
pentobarbital. But that is all that is known about the revised
protocol.</p>
<p>What reason does Tennessee give for not releasing the new
protocol?</p>
<p>In an email sent Monday, Tennessee correction spokesperson Kayla
Hackney told the AP the “protocol is not a public record” and cited a
Tennessee statute that makes the identities of the people carrying out
executions confidential.</p>
<p>However, that same statute says the existence of confidential
information in a record is not a reason to deny access to it, noting
that the confidential information should be redacted.</p>
<p>What has Tennessee done in the past?</p>
<p>In 2018, Tennessee’s correction agency provided a redacted copy of
the protocol to an AP reporter over email.</p>
<p>In 2007, a previous version of the protocol was treated as a public
record and provided to the AP after former Gov. Phil Bredesen, a
Democrat, announced a surprise halt to executions. A reporter’s review
of that 100-page “Manual of Execution” found a jumble of conflicting
instructions that mixed new lethal-injection instructions with those for
electrocution.</p>
<p>Why did Tennessee update its protocol?</p>
<p>Executions have been on hold in Tennessee since 2022, when the state
admitted it had not been following the 2018 protocol. Among other
things, the Correction Department was not consistently testing the
execution drugs for potency and purity.</p>
<p>An independent review of the state’s lethal injection practice later
found that none of the drugs prepared for the seven inmates executed
since 2018 had been fully tested. Later, the state Attorney General’s
Office conceded in court that two of the people most responsible for
overseeing Tennessee’s lethal injection drugs “incorrectly testified”
under oath that officials were testing the chemicals as required.</p>
<p>So what’s with all the secrecy?</p>
<p>Executions in the U.S. have remained at historic lows for years, but
the small group of states still carrying out the death penalty have only
increased the secrecy surrounding the procedures, particularly over how
and where the state secures the drugs used for lethal injections.</p>
<p>Many states argue that secrecy is critical to protect the safety of
those involved in the execution process. Yet in a 2018 report, the
Washington-D.C.-based nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center found
that this argument often led to these states refusing to provide
information about the qualifications of their execution teams and some
courts have criticized such arguments for lack of evidence that more
public disclosure would result in threats against prison officials.</p>
<p>Kelley Henry, chief of the federal public defender’s habeas unit that
represents many of Tennessee’s death row inmates, described the state’s
refusal to release the new protocol, given that background, as
“mystifying.”</p>
<p>“The secrecy, which cloaked the former execution protocol, created a
culture of incompetence and lack of accountability,” she said in an
email.</p>

id="deadly-accident-has-hawaii-officials-pleading-for-end-to-amateur-fireworks-shows">Deadly
accident has Hawaii officials pleading for end to amateur fireworks
shows</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>honolulu — In recent years, occasions large and small — parties,
Super Bowls, mixed martial arts fights, even Thanksgiving — have
provided a reason for residents across Hawaii to set off illegal
fireworks. </p>
<p>The increasingly sophisticated displays, loved by some and loathed by
others, are so prevalent that some people consider them part of the
state’s culture. They have rattled neighborhoods of tightly packed
houses, started fires, terrorized pets and knocked a light fixture off
the ceiling of an Associated Press reporter’s home, where it narrowly
missed a child and shattered on the floor. </p>
<p>Each New Year’s Day, Honolulu officials publish a list of fireworks
casualties from the night before, typically a litany of burns, shrapnel
wounds or amputations. Sometimes there are deaths. </p>
<p>But none of the damage has matched Tuesday night’s tragedy, when a
lit bundle of mortar-style aerials tipped over and shot into crates of
unlit fireworks, causing a rapid-fire series of blasts that killed three
women and injured more than 20 people, including children. </p>
<p>On Friday, the Honolulu medical examiner’s department identified two
of the women as Nelie Ibarra, 58, and Jennifer Van, 23. The cause and
manner of death for both were listed as pending. The identity of the
third was not yet confirmed, the department said in a news release. </p>
<p>Another person was killed in an unrelated fireworks explosion on
Oahu. </p>
<p>Authorities and residents alike are now wondering whether the toll
will dissuade people from putting on such shows in the future, or
whether it will prompt more effective efforts by police to crack
down. </p>
<p>“This incident is a painful reminder of the danger posed by illegal
fireworks,” Honolulu Mayor Rick Blangiardi told a news conference. “They
put lives at risk, they drain our first responders and they disrupt our
neighborhoods.” </p>
<p>Efforts to crack down on contraband fireworks have had limited
effect. In 2023, lawmakers created an illegal fireworks task force.
Based on the ease with which it seized fireworks, including three
shipping containers in its first few months in operation, the state
Department of Law Enforcement concluded illegal fireworks are likely
smuggled into Hawaii on a daily basis. </p>
<p>The task force has seized 227,000 pounds (about 103,000 kilograms) of
fireworks in all, according to Governor Josh Green. </p>
<p>And yet, the Honolulu Fire Department reported Thursday that there
were 30 fireworks-related blazes between Tuesday and Wednesday, a 30%
increase from last New Year’s celebrations. </p>
<p>Representative Gregg Takayama, who sponsored legislation passed last
year to tighten fireworks controls, said he remembers setting them off
when he was younger and agrees it’s a tradition for many. But the ones
he played with, including Roman candles, pale in comparison to those on
the black market today. </p>
<p>“The kind of aerial fireworks that are being used now are really
explosive bombs,” he said. “And so the danger is magnified.” </p>
<p>Charmaine Doran, the vice chair of the neighborhood board in Pearl
City, northwest of Honolulu, called the notion that fireworks are part
of Hawaii culture a misconception: “They have been outlawed for all of
my life … and I’m pretty old.” </p>
<p>In her neighborhood, the fireworks ramp up after Halloween, exploding
in the middle of the night until New Year’s. Doran said she can tell if
there is a big mixed martial arts fight on TV because the booms begin
earlier in the day. </p>
<p>Enforcement is complicated because people are reluctant to report
their neighbors on a small island where “we’re related to everybody,
everybody knows everybody,” Doran said. </p>
<p>People fear retribution, she added: “If I dial 911, they’re going to
egg my house.” </p>
<p>That was the theme of some testimony to the Legislature last January.
Beverly Takushi, a Pearl City resident, described once being threatened
by a neighbor when she told his brother to stop launching illegal
fireworks in a show that lasted from 5:30 p.m. on New Year’s Eve until
after midnight. </p>
<p>“It was the first time I was threatened not only by the danger of the
aerial fireworks to my family and property, but also for my safety from
this neighbor who accused me of not respecting his culture,” Takushi
said. “He has since apologized, but this is the reason why no one wants
to get involved and report their neighbors setting off bombs and
aerials.” </p>
<p>Many historians believe fireworks were invented in China more than
2,000 years ago and their use came to signify joy and prosperity, as
well as warding off evil. In Hawaii they are celebrated not just by
residents of Chinese descent but all across the state’s diverse
communities. </p>
<p>Takushi echoed Takayama’s point about the big difference between
today’s large, professional-grade fireworks and the smaller ones of
yesteryear. </p>
<p>“A string of firecrackers at midnight to ward off bad spirits is
cultural, not loud explosives that sound like you are in the middle of a
war,” Takushi said. </p>
<p>Richard Oshiro, secretary of the neighborhood board for Waipahu,
known as one of Oahu’s hot spots for aerial displays, said he hopes this
week’s deaths will spur a change of mentality about playing with
explosives. </p>
<p>He said he tries to report them whenever he can, even though he knows
there is not much police can do if “they can’t catch people in the
act.” </p>
<p>Possession of over 50 pounds (about 23 kilograms) of aerial or other
illegal fireworks in Hawaii is a felony punishable by up to five years
in prison and a $10,000 fine. Takayama noted the law now allows
photographs and videos of fireworks to be submitted as evidence in
court, but said prosecutions still face hurdles. </p>
<p>“We already have laws on the books. We need to find better ways to
enforce them,” he said. “I mean, we constantly hear about people who
report on their neighbors using illegal aerials, but nothing is done
about it.” </p>
<p>The best way to control fireworks is to stop them at Hawaii’s ports,
Takayama said. Law enforcement has intelligence about which shipments
contain illegal fireworks, and U.S. authorities have the power to open
suspicious cargo. The task force has made seizures but needs to do more,
he said. </p>
<p>“We need to find ways to restrict the amount of fireworks that are
coming in, because once they arrive and once they’re in the community,
it’s very difficult to track them down,” Takayama said.</p>

<h2 id="ghanas-citizenship-offer-attracts-some-black-americans">Ghana’s
citizenship offer attracts some Black Americans</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ACCRA, GHANA — Flipping through a family album, Keachia Bowers paused
on a photo of her as a baby on her father’s lap as he held the 1978
album “Africa Stand Alone” by the Jamaican reggae band Culture.</p>
<p>“When I was 10 years old, I was supposed to come to Ghana with him,”
she said. A day earlier, she had marked 10 years since her father’s
death. Though he was a Pan-Africanist who dreamed of visiting Ghana, he
never made it here.</p>
<p>Bowers and her husband, Damon Smith, however, are among the 524
diaspora members, mostly Black Americans, who were granted Ghanaian
citizenship in a ceremony in November.</p>
<p>Bowers and Smith moved to Ghana from Florida in 2023 after visiting
the region several times between them since the ’90s. They now run a
tour business that caters to Black people who want to visit Ghana or
elsewhere in West Africa, or like them have come to consider a permanent
move.</p>
<p>The November group was the largest one granted citizenship since
Ghana launched the “Year of the Return” program, aimed at attracting the
Black diaspora, in 2019. It marked 400 years since the first African
slaves arrived in Virginia in 1619.</p>
<p>Ghana’s Tourism Authority and the Office of Diaspora Affairs have
extended the program into “Beyond the Return,” which fosters the
relationship with diasporans. Hundreds have been granted citizenship,
including people from Canada, the U.K. and Jamaica.</p>
<p>Bowers said moving to Ghana gave her family a certain feeling of ease
they didn’t have in the U.S.</p>
<p>“When we see Trayvon Martin, Sandra Bland, all these stories of
people being murdered just in their home, living in their home and being
murdered at the hands of police brutality, hearing about it creates
trauma,” she said.</p>
<p>She also worried about her son Tsadik, 14.</p>
<p>Tsadik towers over loved ones in the way that lanky teenage boys
often do. He is shy but opens up around his younger sister Tselah, 11,
and the family’s dog, Apollo.</p>
<p>“In America, being a Black male with locs who’s very tall for his
age, he is treated like a threat,” Bowers said.</p>
<p>Americans face few obstacles to living in Ghana, with most people
paying an annual residency fee. But Bowers said getting citizenship
signified more than simply living in Ghana.</p>
<p>“I didn’t need (citizenship) to tell me that I’m African. Anywhere
that I go in the world and someone looks at me, I’m melanated,” she
said.</p>
<p>“But my ancestors who wanted to return and come back home, those
ancestors who never made it back,” she said, “that passport, for me, is
for them.”</p>
<p>Between 10 to 15 million people were forcibly taken from Africa to
the Americas during the trans-Atlantic slave trade, the majority from
West and Central Africa.</p>
<p>Ghana, then a British colony known as the Gold Coast, was a main
point of departure.</p>
<p>As memorials to the slave trade become tourist destinations across
West Africa, painful reminders of its brutality are easily accessible.
From Ghana to Senegal to Benin, one can visit variations of the “Door of
No Return,” haunting doorways that open to the Atlantic Ocean where
slaves left Africa, and their families, for the last time.</p>
<p>The joy that people feel in finding connections that were broken long
ago is palpable. Videos of the recent citizenship ceremony show men and
women of all ages waving Ghanaian flags and cheering.</p>
<p>Deijha Gordon, 33, was one of them.</p>
<p>“I first visited Ghana in 2015. From then on, I knew this is a place
that I wanted to be and a place where I wanted to show other diasporans,
African-Americans, that we have a place where we belong,” she said.</p>
<p>She moved from Brooklyn to Ghana in 2019 and opened a food truck,
Deijha Vu’s Jerk Hut, selling Jamaican food.</p>
<p>Between bagging to-go orders and speaking to a Black American tourist
couple, she explained how she built the business from scratch.</p>
<p>Gordon was giddy while recalling the moment she got citizenship.</p>
<p>“It just feels good to have a connection to an African country as an
African-American, as a Black American. Because back in America we don’t
have anything to trace our roots to but Africa. To have that connection
here, I feel like I’ve done something right,” she said.</p>
<p>Like Bowers, Gordon has had a stream of people reaching out and
asking about the citizenship process.</p>
<p>The path is not clearly defined. Citizenship must come from a
concession from Ghana’s presidency, a process made legal under the 2000
Citizenship Act. It’s granted to those residing in Ghana who have told
the Office of Diaspora Affairs that they are interested in
citizenship.</p>
<p>Ghana’s government in part describes the program as a benefit to the
economy and focuses on investment opportunities for those wishing to
relocate.</p>
<p>Festus Owooson with the local nonprofit Migration Advocacy Center
said that though the government emphasizes the economic angle, the real
benefits of citizenship are intangible.</p>
<p>“I don’t think (recipients) were crying because they have landed a
gold mine, or they’ve found oil or some kind of business opportunity.
But it’s something so relieving, which you cannot put value or a price
on,” he said.</p>
<p>President Nana Akufo-Addo’s administration, which launched the “Year
of the Return,” is on its way out. Ghana’s main opposition party won the
presidential election on Dec. 7.</p>
<p>But Owooson said Black Americans and other diaspora citizens are
likely to continue receiving citizenship by presidential concession.</p>
<p>Citizenship also can pass to the next generation. The children of
Bowers and Smith received it automatically after their parents’
ceremony.</p>
<p>Bowers’ father, like her husband and children, was a follower of the
Rastafari faith. “Part of the Rastafarian tradition is to repatriate. We
see repatriation as the ultimate experience that you can have on this
earth,” she said.</p>
<p>She believes that her father is proud of her. “I really feel like
he’s smiling, where he is. He wanted to experience this for himself, so
he’s experiencing it through me.”</p>

id="danish-swedish-farmdog-joins-american-kennel-clubs-lineup">Danish-Swedish
farmdog joins American Kennel Club’s lineup</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Say hello to the latest dog in the American Kennel Club’s
lineup of recognized breeds. Or you might say “hej.”</p>
<p>The Danish-Swedish farmdog — yep, that’s the official name — joined
the pack Thursday. The designation makes the breed eligible to compete
for many best in show trophies, and it likely augurs more widespread
interest in the small, sprightly dogs. The prospect both gladdens and
concerns their biggest fans.</p>
<p>“We’re excited about it. We’re looking forward to it,” said Carey
Segebart, one of the people who worked to get Danish-Swedish farmdogs
recognized by the AKC. She proudly plans to debut one of her own at a
dog show this month near her Iowa home.</p>
<p>Still, she thinks increased exposure is “a double-edged sword” for
the fleet, versatile pups.</p>
<p>“We don’t want the breed to just explode too quickly,” she said.</p>
<p>Called the farmdog or DSF for short, the breed goes back centuries in
parts of what are now Denmark, southern Sweden and some other European
countries, according to the Danish-Swedish Farmdog Club of America.</p>
<p>“They’re interesting, fun little dogs,” said Segebart, who has owned
them since 2011 and is the club’s incoming president. “They’re
essentially up for anything. They succeed at most everything.”</p>
<p>In their original homelands, the dogs’ main job was rodent patrol,
but they also would herd a bit, act as watchdogs and play with farmers’
children. Some even performed in circuses, according to the club.</p>
<p>After Denmark and Sweden became more urban and suburban in the 20th
century, farmdog fanciers set out to secure the breed’s place in both
nations (where “hej” translates to the English “hello”). Kennel clubs
there began registering farmdogs in 1987.</p>
<p>In the U.S., many of the just about 350 farmdogs nationwide compete
in agility, obedience or other canine sports that are open to all dogs,
including mixed breeds.</p>
<p>But until now, farmdogs couldn’t enter the traditional breed-by-breed
judging that leads to best in show prizes at events including the
prominent Westminster Kennel Club dog show in New York. The entry
deadline has passed for February’s Westminster show, so farmdogs will
have to wait for 2026 there, but they may well appear later this year at
two other major, televised shows, the National Dog Show and AKC National
Championship.</p>
<p>The Danish-Swedish farmdog is the AKC’s 202nd breed and “a wonderful
addition to a family that is able to provide it with the exercise and
mental stimulation that it needs,” said the club’s Gina DiNardo.</p>
<p>Too popular for its own good?</p>
<p>The AKC is the United States’ oldest purebred dog registry and
essentially a league for many dog competitions. Registration is
voluntary, and requirements for breed recognition include at least 300
pedigreed dogs spread through at least 20 states. Some breeds are in
other kennel clubs or none at all.</p>
<p>Danish-Swedish farmdog fanciers deliberated for several years before
pursuing AKC recognition and the attention that’s likely to come with
it, Segebart said. The number of farmdog puppy-seekers has grown
substantially over the last decade; each of the few breeders receives
multiple inquiries a week, and the typical wait for a puppy is a year or
more, she said.</p>
<p>Farmdog folk fear that their appealing, relatively easy-care breed
could quickly become too popular for its own good. They’re not the first
to worry: Much fur has flown in dogdom over the rise of the French
bulldog, which the AKC now ranks as the most popular breed in the
country.</p>
<p>Some animal rights activists echo those concerns to argue against dog
breeding in general. They say purebred popularity trends divert people
from adopting shelter animals, fuel puppy mills and prize dogs’
appearance over their health.</p>
<p>The AKC says it promotes responsibly “breeding for type and function”
to produce dogs with at least somewhat predictable traits, whether as
basic as size or as specialized as bomb-sniffing skills. The club says
it has given over $35 million since 1995 to its canine health research
charity.</p>

funeral service, flyover and 39 bells for Carter sendoff</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PLAINS, GEORGIA — Mourners are to begin paying their respects to
Jimmy Carter on Saturday, kicking off a carefully choreographed six-day
farewell for America’s longest-lived president.</p>
<p>Flags have been flying at half-staff across the country since Carter
died on Dec. 29 at the age of 100 in his hometown of Plains,
Georgia.</p>
<p>Carter’s state funeral officially begins on Saturday with Secret
Service agents from his current and former protective detail carrying
his casket to a hearse for a tour through Plains.</p>
<p>The motorcade bearing his remains is to pause at Carter’s boyhood
family peanut farm while a farm bell rings 39 times in honor of
America’s 39th president.</p>
<p>His body will then be taken to Atlanta for a brief stop at the
Georgia Capitol, where Carter served as a state senator before becoming
governor, and a moment of silence.</p>
<p>From there, Carter will be escorted to the Carter Presidential Center
where he will lie in repose from 7 p.m. on Saturday (0000 GMT Sunday) to
6 a.m. (1100 GMT) on Tuesday to allow the public to pay their
respects.</p>
<p>Carter’s remains will be flown on Tuesday morning from a military
base in Georgia to Joint Base Andrews outside Washington on a U.S. Air
Force plane dubbed Special Air Mission 39.</p>
<p>A motorcade will then transport the body of the former
commander-in-chief to the U.S. Navy Memorial.</p>
<p>Carter, who attended the U.S. Naval Academy, graduating in 1946, and
served on submarines, will be transferred from a hearse to a horse-drawn
caisson for a funeral procession to the U.S. Capitol.</p>
<p>Military pall bearers will carry his flag-draped casket to the
rotunda of the Capitol where his body will lie in state until 7 a.m.
(1200 GMT) on Thursday, surrounded by a guard of honor of service
members.</p>
<p>Carter will be the 13th former U.S. president to lie in state in the
Capitol. Abraham Lincoln, assassinated in 1865, was the first.</p>
<p>A national funeral service is to be held on Thursday at the National
Cathedral, an Episcopal church in the nation’s capital that also hosted
state funerals for former presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower, Ronald
Reagan, Gerald Ford and George H.W. Bush.</p>
<p>All four living former presidents — Bill Clinton, George W. Bush,
Barack Obama and Donald Trump — are expected to attend.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden is to deliver the eulogy for his fellow Democrat,
who served in the White House from 1977-81.</p>
<p>Biden has declared Thursday to be a national day of mourning, and
federal government offices are to be closed for the day.</p>
<p>He has also ordered flags to be flown at half-staff for 30 days as is
customary, which means that will be the case during Trump’s Jan. 20
inauguration.</p>
<p>That drew the ire of the president-elect, who took to Truth Social to
say “no American can be happy” about having flags at half-staff when he
takes office.</p>
<p>Following the cathedral service, Carter’s remains will be flown
aboard Special Air Mission 39 back to Georgia for a private funeral
service at the Baptist church in Plains where Carter taught Sunday
school.</p>
<p>A final motorcade through his hometown will ferry Carter’s body to a
burial plot at his residence.</p>
<p>U.S. Navy jets will conduct a flyover in his honor before he is laid
to rest alongside his wife of 77 years, Rosalynn, who died in 2023 at
the age of 96.</p>

<h2 id="us-new-car-sales-hit-5-year-high-in-2024-helped-by-hybrids">US
new car sales hit 5-year high in 2024, helped by hybrids</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>DETROIT — U.S. new car sales in 2024 continued to rise from their
pandemic lows, bolstered by replenished inventories, higher incentives
and surging demand for hybrid vehicles, automakers reported on
Friday.</p>
<p>Sales of new vehicles finished at 15.9 million last year, according
to Wards Intelligence, up 2.2% from the prior year, and the highest
since 2019. Automakers are projecting strong sales will continue into
2025, although President-elect Donald Trump’s proposed automotive
policies, such as removing tax credits for EVs, present a wild card.</p>
<p>“We’re carrying significant momentum into 2025,” Rory Harvey, GM’s
head of global markets, said in a release. The Detroit automaker
defended its 2023 crown as the biggest U.S. carmaker by sales, selling
2.7 million vehicles last year, the company said on Friday, up 4.3% from
2023.</p>
<p>Most automakers recorded solid sales results last year, as they
adjusted to slowing demand for EVs and relied on their core business of
gasoline-powered trucks and SUVs. Others capitalized on soaring consumer
interest in hybrid vehicles.</p>
<p>Sales of traditional hybrids increased 36.7% in 2024 compared with
the previous year, Wards reported.</p>
<p>‘Hybrids, we’re sold out’</p>
<p>Toyota notched a 3.7% sales gain year-over-year in the U.S., boosted
by steady increases of reliable smaller vehicles such as the Camry and
RAV4 SUV, as well as significant gains for hybrid vehicles. Reuters
reported last year that the automaker is potentially converting all of
its lineup into hybrid-only models.</p>
<p>“For hybrids, we’re sold out — customers want them. We can’t get
enough of them,” said David Christ, head of sales and marketing for
Toyota in North America. “Battery electric vehicles, even with the huge
incentives we’re spending and the federal government’s incentives, are
just not as in demand.”</p>
<p>Ford Motor also benefited from an increase in hybrid sales, which
helped the automaker’s total vehicle sales rise 4.2% in 2024. The
Dearborn, Michigan, company’s total hybrid sales roughly doubled that of
its EVs, with 187,426 hybrids sold and 97,865 EVs.</p>
<p>Automakers have axed or changed lofty EV plans laid out when demand
seemed much stronger than it turned out to be, but they are still aiming
to attract new EV buyers.</p>
<p>Ford said on Friday that to support EV sales, which were up 34.8% for
the automaker in 2024, it would extend a program where EV buyers receive
free chargers and installation at home through the end of March.</p>
<p>U.S. sales of electric vehicles are expected to approach 1.3 million,
or about 8% of all new vehicles purchased, Cox Automotive said. Buyers’
willingness to go electric crept up slightly from 2023, when U.S.
drivers bought 1.2 million EVs, making up 7.6% of all sales, Cox
said.</p>
<p>The Trump administration’s plans would likely affect auto sales in
2025 and beyond if the incoming president makes good on plans to roll
back President Joe Biden’s EV policies, including a $7,500 consumer tax
credit on some EVs, as well as increase tariffs on imports from Mexico
and Canada.</p>
<p>“If you take true demand for the car and you eliminate the $7,500
benefit … it’s really going to change who wants them and how they buy
them. So we’re preparing for that,” Toyota’s Christ said.</p>

<h2 id="us-announces-306-million-in-new-bird-flu-funding">US announces
$306 million in new bird flu funding</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden’s outgoing administration
announced Friday that it will allocate $306 million to bolster the
nation’s bird flu response before President-elect Donald Trump takes
office.</p>
<p>The new funding will support national, state and local preparedness
and monitoring programs, as well as research into potential medical
countermeasures against the H5N1 virus.</p>
<p>“While the risk to humans remains low, we are always preparing for
any possible scenario that could arise,” Health Secretary Xavier Becerra
said in a statement.</p>
<p>“Preparedness is the key to keeping Americans healthy and our country
safe.”</p>
<p>The United States has reported 66 human cases of bird flu since the
start of 2024, though experts believe the true number could be higher,
with cases potentially going undetected among cattle and poultry
workers.</p>
<p>While the virus has not been found to spread from person to person,
the amount of bird flu circulating among animals and humans has alarmed
scientists, because it might combine with seasonal influenza and mutate
into a more transmissible form — potentially triggering a deadly
pandemic.</p>
<p>The funding announcement comes amid concern over how the incoming
Trump administration will handle the threat.</p>
<p>The president-elect told Time magazine recently he would abolish the
Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy established under
Biden — though it is not clear if he has the authority to do so, since
it was created by Congress.</p>
<p>His pick for health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is a vocal
vaccine skeptic who has pledged to shake up the nation’s health agencies
and promotes raw milk, thought to be a vector for bird flu.</p>
<p>Biden’s administration has also faced criticism for what some
consider a subpar bird flu response.</p>
<p>The Center for Strategic and International Studies, a
Washington-based think tank, published a report last month citing an
array of problems including “lagging data, incomplete surveillance,
sluggish coordination, considerable mistrust, and insufficient planning
and stockpiling of vaccines and therapies.”</p>
<p>Given these shortcomings, infectious disease epidemiologist Meg
Schaeffer of the SAS Institute told AFP: “In my opinion, avian influenza
is going to become either a pandemic or a virus…  that will become a
very widespread and significant health issue for us in the next one to
two years.”</p>
<p>She urged raw milk consumers in particular to “take a pause on that
consumption.”</p>
<p>Adding to concerns, a virus sample from a critically ill patient in
Louisiana has shown signs of mutating to better adapt to human airways,
although there is no evidence it has spread beyond that individual,
health authorities said last week.</p>
<p>Researchers are also closely monitoring the growing number of bird
flu infections in cats, which could expose humans through close
contact.</p>

<h2 id="bidens-top-aide-to-make-china-focused-visit-to-india">Biden’s
top aide to make China-focused visit to India</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — President Joe Biden’s national security adviser, Jake
Sullivan, will make his final visit to India next week to emphasize
Washington’s partnership with New Delhi, the White House announced
Friday.</p>
<p>The visit will cap the Biden administration’s efforts to maximize
ties with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government, in its strategic
focus to counter China’s influence in the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>Strengthening ties with India has been a “real foreign policy
priority and area of legacy achievement for the Biden administration,” a
senior administration official said on condition of anonymity in a
briefing to reporters Friday.</p>
<p>Sullivan will visit New Delhi January 5-6 to discuss a range of
issues, including civil nuclear partnership, China’s overcapacity on
semiconductor and biopharma supply chains, strategic technology
cooperation and other shared security priorities, a second
administration official said.</p>
<p>Sullivan’s visit comes as tension is brewing between India and China
over Beijing’s plan to build what it calls the “world’s largest” hydro
dam on the Yarlung Zangbo River on the eastern rim of the Tibetan
plateau, which could affect millions downstream in India and
Bangladesh.</p>
<p>Sullivan is expected to discuss the dam along with other regional
issues of concern, said the first administration official in response to
VOA’s question. “What matters to us is that when it comes to water
resources that have to be managed across countries, that those are being
handled fairly and in an equitable way,” the official said.</p>
<p>Technology initiative</p>
<p>A key focus of the visit is the U.S.-India initiative on Critical and
Emerging Technology (iCET) – an effort that Biden and Modi announced in
May 2022 to bolster their strategic technology partnership and
defense-industrial cooperation between their governments, businesses and
academic institutions across various domains, from AI to quantum
computing, and from semiconductors to space.</p>
<p>Sullivan’s visit will take place just two weeks before
President-elect Donald Trump assumes office January 20. Many expect iCET
to continue under his administration.</p>
<p>“There is broad bipartisan support for some of the goals of iCET,”
said the second administration official in response to VOA’s question.
They include “strengthening the resilience of technology supply chains,
working with allies and partners to position ourselves to offset PRC
[People Republic of China’s] advancements in certain technologies, and
efforts to dominate some of the supply chains.”</p>
<p>The U.S. strategic partnership with New Delhi is “based upon a bet
that India’s economic, technological and military rise is critical to
pushing back and containing China’s dominance in these fields,” said
Aparna Pande, director of the Initiative on the Future of India and
South Asia at the Hudson Institute.</p>
<p>Irritants have not derailed bilateral ties. Those include India’s
democratic backsliding, and the case of a former Indian government
employee charged in New York last year with murder-for-hire over his
role in directing a foiled plot to assassinate a Sikh separatist and
Modi critic.</p>
<p>Most of Biden’s policies on India will likely continue, Pande told
VOA, as Trump’s desire to “push back or contain China’s rise – economic,
technological and military – will help ensure that India is seen as a
partner in this endeavor.”</p>
<p>During his first administration, Trump had a warm relationship with
Modi. Trump attended a 2019 “Howdy Modi” rally in Texas, and Modi
reciprocated by hosting a “Namaste Trump” rally in Ahmedabad in
2020.</p>

id="soldier-who-died-in-las-vegas-blast-meant-it-to-be-wake-up-call-for-us">Soldier
who died in Las Vegas blast meant it to be ‘wake-up call’ for US</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>An Army soldier who died in an explosion of a Tesla Cybertruck at the
Trump hotel in Las Vegas left a note saying it was a stunt to serve as a
“wake-up call” for the country’s ills, investigators said Friday. </p>
<p>Matthew Livelsberger, 37, a Green Beret from Colorado Springs,
Colorado, also wrote in the note that he needed to “cleanse my mind” of
the lives lost of people he knew and “the burden of the lives I
took.” </p>
<p>Livelsberger apparently harbored no ill will toward President-elect
Donald Trump, Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department officials
said. </p>
<p>“Although this incident is more public and more sensational than
usual, it ultimately appears to be a tragic case of suicide involving a
heavily decorated combat veteran who was struggling with PTSD and other
issues,” Spencer Evans, FBI special agent in charge, said at a news
conference. </p>
<p>The explosion caused minor injuries to seven people but virtually no
damage to the hotel. Authorities said Friday that Livelsberger acted
alone.</p>
<p>‘Not a terrorist attack’ </p>
<p>“This was not a terrorist attack, it was a wake-up call. Americans
only pay attention to spectacles and violence. What better way to get my
point across than a stunt with fireworks and explosives,” Livelsberger
wrote in a letter found by authorities who released only excerpts of
it. </p>
<p>Investigators identified the Tesla driver — who was burned beyond
recognition — as Livelsberger by a tattoo and by comparing DNA from
relatives. The cause of death was a self-inflicted gunshot to the head,
according to coroner’s officials. </p>
<p>Pentagon officials have declined to say whether Livelsberger may have
been suffering from mental health issues but say they have turned over
his medical records to police. </p>
<p>Authorities excerpted the messages from two letters Livelsberger
wrote using a cellphone note application, said Assistant Sheriff Dori
Koren of the Las Vegas police. </p>
<p>The letters covered a range of topics including political grievances,
domestic issues and societal issues, Koren said. </p>
<p>Tesla engineers, meanwhile, helped extract data from the Cybertruck
for investigators, including Livelsberger’s path between charging
stations from Colorado through New Mexico and Arizona and on to Las
Vegas, Koren said. </p>
<p>“We still have a large volume of data to go through,” Koren said.
“There’s thousands if not millions of videos and photos and documents
and web history and all of those things that need to be analyzed.” </p>
<p>The new details came as investigators sought to determine
Livelsberger’s motive, including whether he sought to make a political
point with the Tesla and the hotel bearing the president-elect’s
name. </p>
<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has recently become a member of Trump’s inner
circle. Neither Trump nor Musk was in Las Vegas early Wednesday, the day
of the explosion. Both had attended Trump’s New Year’s Eve party at his
South Florida estate. </p>
<p>Musk spent an estimated $250 million during the presidential campaign
to support Trump, who has named Musk, the world’s richest man, to
co-lead a new effort to find ways to cut the government’s size and
spending. </p>
<p>Truck absorbed blast</p>
<p>Investigators suspect Livelsberger may have been planning a more
damaging attack, but the steel-sided vehicle absorbed much of the force
from the crudely built explosive. </p>
<p>Investigators said previously that Livelsberger shot himself inside
the Tesla Cybertruck packed with fireworks just before it exploded
outside Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas on New Year’s Day. </p>
<p>“It’s not lost on us that it’s in front of the Trump building, that
it’s a Tesla vehicle, but we don’t have information at this point that
definitively tells us or suggests it was because of this particular
ideology,” the FBI’s Evans said Thursday. </p>
<p>A law enforcement official said investigators learned through
interviews that he might have had a fight with his wife about
relationship issues shortly before he rented the Tesla in Colorado on
Saturday and bought the guns. The official spoke on the condition of
anonymity because of a lack of authorization to discuss the
investigation. </p>
<p>Livelsberger served in the Green Berets, highly trained special
forces who work to counter terrorism abroad and train partners. He had
served in the Army since 2006, rising through the ranks with a long
career of overseas assignments, deploying twice to Afghanistan and
serving in Ukraine, Tajikistan, Georgia and Congo, the Army said. He had
recently returned from an overseas assignment in Germany and was on
approved leave when he died, according to a U.S. official. </p>
<p>He was awarded five Bronze Stars, including one with a valor device
for courage under fire, a combat infantry badge and an Army Commendation
Medal with valor. </p>
<p>The explosion of the truck came hours after Shamsud-Din Bahar Jabbar,
42, rammed a truck into a crowd in New Orleans’ famed French Quarter
early on New Year’s Day, killing at least 14 people before being shot to
death by police.</p>

id="biden-awards-medal-of-honor-and-medal-of-valor-to-military-heroes-first-responders">Biden
awards Medal of Honor and Medal of Valor to military heroes, first
responders</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — On Feb. 15, 1951, Army Private Bruno R. Orig was
returning from a mission when he found his fellow soldiers under attack
in what’s now known as the Battle of Chipyong-ni.</p>
<p>The infantryman provided first aid to his comrades wounded in the
Korean War attack and began helping move those men to safety. He then
took over a machine gun post and allowed a friendly platoon to pull back
without a casualty. When the ground was recaptured later that day, Orig
was found dead beside the machine gun, surrounded by enemy combatants he
had killed.</p>
<p>Orig was among the Medal of Honor recipients recognized Friday by
President Joe Biden in one of his last opportunities to officially
acknowledge acts of selflessness and personal bravery in times of war.
Biden bestowed the medal posthumously to six men and one living
recipient at a White House ceremony. In a separate Oval Office ceremony
closed to the news media, he awarded the Medal of Valor to eight first
responders who put their own lives at risk to save others.</p>
<p>These are heroes of different ranks, different positions and even
different generations.” Biden said at the Medal of Honor ceremony,
Friday evening. “They are heroes who all went above and beyond the call
of duty.”</p>
<p>Acknowledging his last days as president, Biden said, “These are my
finals days as commander in chief. It was the greatest honor of my life
to be entrusted” to lead America, he said “and the finest military in
the history of the world.”</p>
<p>During the Korean War, Private First Class Wataru Nakamura destroyed
an enemy machine gun nest and recaptured several bunkers. He exhausted
his ammunition but resumed his attack after being rearmed, and he was
ultimately killed by an enemy grenade and buried in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Army Corporal Fred B. McGee was recognized for his gallantry and
intrepidity near Tang-Wan-Ni, Korea, on June 16, 1952, when he assumed
command of his squad, neutralized an enemy machine gun and then sent his
squad back while he helped rescue the wounded.</p>
<p>The Ohio native died in 2020, according to news reports.</p>
<p>Army Private First Class Charles R. Johnson, from Millbrook, New
York, was killed on June 12, 1953, after holding off Chinese forces
during the Korean War. His actions saved the lives of as many as 10
soldiers.</p>
<p>After multiple raids on an entrenched enemy in the area of Sagimak
during the Korean War, Army First Lieutenant Richard E. Cavazos stayed
behind alone to evacuate five battle casualties to safety.</p>
<p>Cavazos served more than three decades in the service, eventually
attaining the rank of four-star general. The Texan died in 2018 at age
88. Fort Hood was renamed in honor of him on May 9, 2023.</p>
<p>After an armed helicopter crashed during the Vietnam War on June 5,
1966, Army Captain Hugh R. Nelson Jr. from Rocky Mount, North Carolina,
pulled two specialists from the aircraft, shielding one of them from
enemy gunfire at the loss of his own life.</p>
<p>While fighting in Vietnam on May 7, 1970, then-Army Private First
Class Kenneth J. David drew enemy fire away from injured comrades and
onto himself, becoming wounded by a satchel charge.</p>
<p>But David kept fighting and pulled fire away from landing Medevac
helicopters, and was evacuated after the last helicopter landed. The
Ohioan is still living.</p>
<p>On Friday, Biden also awarded eight people the Medal of Valor, which
goes to those who have shown exceptional courage in attempting to save
human lives.</p>
<p>The recipients included the law enforcement officials who responded
to a shooter who killed six people on March 27, 2023, at The Covenant
School in Nashville, Tennessee.</p>
<p>The Nashville Police Department’s Sergeant Jeffrey Mathes, Officer
Rex Engelbert and detectives Michael Collazo, Ryan Cagle and Zachary
Plese rushed to the scene and faced gunfire from the shooter. They
cleared out classrooms and ultimately took down the shooter.</p>
<p>Biden also recognized Sergeant Tu Tran of the Lincoln, Nebraska,
Police Department. On Feb. 22, 2023, Tran swam 9 meters (30 feet) into a
frigid pond to rescue a woman from a submerging vehicle.</p>
<p>Lieutenant John Vanderstar, a New York City firefighter, received the
Medal of Valor for rescuing a mother and child from a burning apartment
on Oct. 23, 2022. Separately, New York City firefighter Brendan Gaffney
was honored for braving an apartment building fire to save an
unconscious child and a pregnant woman.</p>

storms to hit much of US with snow, ice, biting cold</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A strong snow and ice storm followed by brutally cold conditions will
soon smack the eastern two-thirds of the United States as frigid air
escapes the Arctic, plunging as far south as Florida, meteorologists
said.</p>
<p>Starting Saturday, millions of people are going to be hit by moderate
to heavy snow from Kansas City to Washington — including a high chance
of at least 8 inches of snow between central Kansas and Indiana — the
National Weather Service warned Friday.</p>
<p>Dangerous ice particularly lethal to power lines — “so heavy like
paste, it’s hard to move,” said private meteorologist Ryan Maue — is
likely to set in just south of that in southern Kansas, Missouri,
Illinois, Indiana and much of Kentucky and West Virginia.</p>
<p>“It’s going to be a mess, a potential disaster,” Maue said. “This is
something we haven’t seen in quite a while.”</p>
<p>National Weather Service meteorologist Alex Lamers said Friday that
the potential for blizzard conditions was increasing, particularly in
Kansas and neighboring portions of the Central Plains, and that wind
gusts might reach 50 mph at times.</p>
<p>As the storm moves away Monday, hundreds of millions of people in the
eastern two-thirds of the nation will be plunged into dangerous,
bone-chilling air and wind chills all week, government and private
forecasters said. Temperatures could be 12 to 25 degrees Fahrenheit (7
to 14 degrees Celsius) colder than normal as the dreaded polar vortex
stretches down from the high Arctic, bringing chilly weather, they
said.</p>
<p>“This could lead to the coldest January for the U.S. since 2011,” Dan
DePodwin, director of forecast operations for AccuWeather, said Friday.
“It’s not just one day of this. It’s going to be three to five, in some
cases a week or more of temperatures that are well below historical
average.”</p>
<p>Look out, Ohio Valley</p>
<p>The biggest drop below normal is likely to be centered over the Ohio
Valley, but significant unusual cold will extend southward all the way
to the Gulf Coast, said Danny Barandiaran, a meteorologist at the
National Weather Service’s Climate Prediction Center.</p>
<p>Forecasts have moderated a bit from last week, when some computer
models envisioned the worst cold spell in decades. Now it’s unlikely
many cold records will break, but it will still have a big impact on the
country, Barandiaran said.</p>
<p>There should even be a hard freeze in Florida, while areas near the
Canadian border will be around zero, Barandiaran said.</p>
<p>“It’s not going to thaw out for a while,” Maue said.</p>
<p>Jennifer Francis, a climate scientist at the Woodwell Climate
Research Institute, said the initial blasting winds from the north might
shock people after a fairly warm last couple of years.</p>
<p>“The wind chills are going to be brutal,” she said. “There’ll be a
lot of whining, but it is winter. … Just because the globe is warming
doesn’t mean these cold snaps are going away.”</p>
<p>This nasty weather may be triggered in part by a fast-warming Arctic,
serving as a not-so-gentle reminder that climate change gooses weather
extremes, even winter ones, said Francis and Judah Cohen, seasonal
forecast director at the private firm Atmospheric and Environmental
Research.</p>
<p>The polar vortex - ultra-cold air spinning like a top 15 to 30 miles
high - usually stays penned up above the North Pole. But sometimes it
escapes or stretches down to the United States, Europe or Asia. And
that’s when large numbers of people get intense doses of cold.</p>
<p>Cohen and colleagues have published several studies showing an
increase in the polar vortex stretching or wandering. Cohen, Francis and
others last month published a study that attributed these cold outbreaks
partly to changes from an Arctic that’s warming four times faster than
the rest of the globe.</p>
<p>The change in temperature and loss of Arctic sea ice make the jet
stream — the river of air that moves storm fronts — wavier, allowing
plunges of cold air to come south and extreme weather to stay put,
Francis said.</p>
<p>What’s about to hit “is a really good example of these kinds of
cases,” Francis said.</p>

<h2 id="ukraine-defense-contact-group-to-hold-one-last-meeting">Ukraine
Defense Contact Group to hold one last meeting</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin will attend his final meeting
of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group at Ramstein Air Base in Germany
next week, the Defense Department said Friday. </p>
<p>The group of more than 50 nations, also known as the Ramstein group,
includes members of NATO as well as most of the European Union. It was
formed by Austin in April 2022, after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine two
months earlier, and is designed to coordinate military support for
Ukraine’s defense.</p>
<p>The meeting, originally scheduled for October, was postponed when
U.S. President Joe Biden — who had been scheduled to chair a
leaders-level meeting for the group — canceled his trip to deal with the
aftermath of Hurricane Milton, according to Politico. The last full
meeting of the group was held in September.</p>
<p>The meeting will come just over a week before President-elect Donald
Trump is sworn into office. The futures of the Ramstein group and any
U.S. support to Ukraine are in question, as Trump has been critical of
the level of U.S. aid to the country. He also has expressed an interest
in ending the fighting swiftly.</p>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Thursday that Trump
could be important in the outcome of the yearslong war between Ukraine
and Russia.</p>
<p>“Trump can be decisive. For us, this is the most important thing,”
Zelenskyy said in an interview with Ukrainian television.</p>
<p>“His qualities are indeed there,” Zelenskyy said about Trump. “He can
be decisive in this war. He is capable of stopping [Russian President
Vladimir] Putin, or, to put it more fairly, help us stop Putin.”</p>
<p>Trump has previously said he would be able to stop the war in Ukraine
in one day, but he has never detailed how he would accomplish that.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Agence France-Presse reported, citing local officials,
that a Russian drone attack in the suburbs of the capital, Kyiv, early
Friday killed one person and wounded four.</p>
<p>AFP said Russian forces have escalated their aerial strikes across
Ukraine through the first weeks of winter, including a New Year’s Day
drone attack targeting central Kyiv that killed two.</p>
<p>In a statement posted to Facebook and other social media accounts,
acting Kyiv regional Governor Mykola Kalashnyk reported a truck driver
had been killed when he was hit by debris from a Russian drone that had
been shot down.</p>
<p>Also Friday, Ukraine’s General Staff of the Armed Forces reported
that Russian troops were continuing to push forward in Donetsk Oblast,
advancing near the key town of Pokrovsk. Ukraine’s General Staff
recorded 138 clashes on the battlefield from Thursday to Friday.</p>

Reuters and Agence France-Presse.</p>

id="seasonal-illnesses-in-full-force-in-most-us-states-cdc-says">Seasonal
illnesses in full force in most US states, CDC says</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The holidays came with a side of flu for many Americans, with 40
states reporting high or very high levels of illness last week,
according to the latest government health data. </p>
<p>“A lot of flu out there,” said Carrie Reed of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention. </p>
<p>Of course, there are a number of bugs that cause fever, cough, sore
throat and other flulike symptoms. One is COVID-19. Another is RSV, or
respiratory syncytial virus, which is a common cause of coldlike
symptoms but can be dangerous for infants and the elderly. </p>
<p>Reed said that the most recent CDC hospitalization data and other
indicators show that the flu virus is trending higher than the other
germs. Several seasonal flu strains are driving cases, with no dominant
one, she added. </p>
<p>Pediatric hospitals have been busy since November with RSV, but
“influenza has now joined the party,” said Dr. Jason Newland, an
infectious-diseases specialist at Nationwide Children’s Hospital in
Columbus, Ohio. </p>
<p>“Now we’re really starting to roll,” he added. “Our hospitals are
busy.” </p>
<p>Where flu illnesses are the highest </p>
<p>One indicator of flu activity is the percentage of doctor’s office
visits driven by flulike symptoms. That level last week was about equal
to the peak of last winter’s respiratory virus season — which occurred
at the same time of year. Reed noted that most people avoid medical
appointments over the holidays if they can help it, so the data in late
December might be skewed by people who came down with sudden
illnesses. </p>
<p>Last week’s flu activity was particularly intense in the South,
Southwest and West. The states reporting lesser amounts of suffering
were mostly in the northern Great Plains and in New England. </p>
<p>So far this season, the CDC estimates, there have been at least 5.3
million flu illnesses, 63,000 hospitalizations and 2,700 deaths,
including at least 11 children. </p>
<p>It’s not clear if this winter respiratory virus season will be any
worse than others. So far it seems relatively typical, at least for
kids, Newland said. </p>
<p>How to protect yourself </p>
<p>U.S. health officials recommend that everyone 6 months and older get
an annual flu vaccination, and they say it’s not too late to get a
shot. </p>
<p>You should also avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth because
germs can spread that way, health officials say. You should also wash
your hands with soap and water, clean frequently touched surfaces and
avoid close contact with people who are sick.</p>
<p>The CDC also has been keeping its eye on a rise of illnesses from
norovirus, a nasty stomach bug, with 91 outbreaks reported early in
December. </p>
<p>Investigators also have been closely watching another kind of
influenza virus, the Type A H5N1 version of bird flu. The CDC says 66
human U.S. cases of that were reported last year, but none of them in
the last week. </p>
<p>The cases are “fairly sporadic,” and the overall risk to the public
remains low, Reed said. Almost all have been traced to direct contact
with infected animals, with no proof of spread between people.</p>

id="judge-sets-trumps-sentencing-in-hush-money-case-for-jan.-10">Judge
sets Trump’s sentencing in hush money case for Jan. 10</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — In an extraordinary turn, a judge Friday set
President-elect Donald Trump’s sentencing in his hush money case for
Jan. 10 — just 10 days before he’s due to return to the White House —
but indicated he wouldn’t be jailed. </p>
<p>The development nevertheless leaves Trump on course to be the first
president to take office convicted of felony crimes. </p>
<p>Judge Juan M. Merchan, who presided over Trump’s trial, signaled in a
written decision that he’d sentence the former and future president to
what’s known as a conditional discharge, in which a case is closed
without jail time, a fine or probation. </p>
<p>Merchan rejected Trump’s push to dismiss the verdict and throw out
the case on presidential immunity grounds and because of his impending
return to the White House. The judge said he found “no legal impediment
to sentencing” Trump and that it was “incumbent” on him to sentence
Trump prior to his swearing in on Jan. 20. </p>
<p>“Only by bringing finality to this matter” will the interests of
justice be served, Merchan wrote. </p>
<p>Trump was convicted in May of 34 counts of falsifying business
records. They involved an alleged scheme to hide a hush money payment to
porn actor Stormy Daniels in the last weeks of Trump’s first campaign in
2016. The payout was made to keep her from publicizing claims she’d had
sex with the married Trump years earlier. He says that her story is
false and that he did nothing wrong. </p>
<p>After Trump’s Nov. 5 election, Merchan halted proceedings and
indefinitely postponed the sentencing so the defense and prosecution
could weigh in on the future of the case. </p>
<p>Trump’s lawyers urged Merchan to toss it. They said it would
otherwise pose unconstitutional “disruptions” to the incoming
president’s ability to run the country. </p>
<p>Prosecutors acknowledged there should be some accommodation for his
upcoming presidency, but they insisted the conviction should stand. </p>
<p>They suggested various options, such as freezing the case during his
term or guaranteeing him a no-jail sentence. They also proposed closing
the case while formally noting both his conviction and his undecided
appeal — a novel idea drawn from what some state courts do when criminal
defendants die while appealing their cases. </p>
<p>Merchan ruled that Trump’s current status as president-elect does not
afford him the same kind of immunity granted to a sitting president and
does not require that the verdict be set aside, and the case dismissed —
a notion the judge described as “drastic” and “rare.” </p>
<p>Doing that “would undermine the Rule of Law in immeasurable ways,”
Merchan wrote. He opined that it wouldn’t address the Supreme Court’s
concerns about presidential immunity, either. </p>
<p>Trump takes office Jan. 20 as the first former president to be
convicted of a crime and the first convicted criminal to be elected to
the office. </p>
<p>His conviction left the 78-year-old facing the possibility of
punishment ranging from a fine or probation to up to four years in
prison. </p>
<p>The case centered on how Trump accounted for reimbursing his personal
attorney for the Daniels’ payment. </p>
<p>The lawyer, Michael Cohen, fronted the money. He later recouped it
through a series of payments that Trump’s company logged as legal
expenses. Trump, by then in the White House, signed most of the checks
himself. </p>
<p>Prosecutors said the designation was meant to cloak the true purpose
of the payments and help cover up a broader effort to keep voters from
hearing unflattering claims about the Republican during his first
campaign. </p>
<p>Trump said that Cohen was legitimately paid for legal services, and
that Daniels’ story was suppressed to avoid embarrassing Trump’s family,
not to influence the electorate. </p>
<p>Trump was a private citizen — campaigning for president, but neither
elected nor sworn in — when Cohen paid Daniels in October 2016. He was
president when Cohen was reimbursed, and Cohen testified that they
discussed the repayment arrangement in the Oval Office. </p>
<p>Trump, a Republican, has decried the verdict as the “rigged,
disgraceful” result of a “witch hunt” pursued by Manhattan District
Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat. </p>
<p>Before Trump’s November election, his lawyers sought to reverse his
conviction for a different reason: a U.S. Supreme Court decision in July
that gave presidents broad immunity from criminal prosecution. That
request was still pending when the election raised new issues. </p>
<p>While urging Merchan to nix the conviction, Trump also sought to move
the case to federal court, where he could also assert immunity. A
federal judge repeatedly said no, but Trump appealed. </p>
<p>The hush money case was the only one of Trump’s four criminal
indictments to go to trial.</p>
<p>Since the election, special counsel Jack Smith has ended his two
federal cases. One pertained to Trump’s efforts to overturn his 2020
election loss; the other alleged he hoarded classified documents at his
Mar-a-Lago estate. </p>
<p>A separate, state-level election interference case in Georgia is
largely on hold.</p>

capital in ‘heightened threat environment’ after New Year’s Day
attacks</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Law enforcement and security agencies in and around
Washington are bringing in reinforcements as they prepare to secure
three high-profile events in the nation’s capital, following the New
Year’s Day terror attack in New Orleans and the Cybertruck bombing in
front of the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>The first event will occur Monday, when Congress meets to certify
results of the presidential election four years to the day since the
Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.</p>
<p>The second will be the state funeral for the late President Jimmy
Carter, starting with a ceremony and procession on Tuesday before
wrapping up on Thursday.</p>
<p>The last high-profile event will come Jan. 20, when President-elect
Donald Trump is inaugurated.</p>
<p>“That has never happened before. We have three [National Special
Security Events] over a 15-day period,” Matt McCool, U.S. Secret Service
Washington Field Office special agent in charge, told reporters
Friday.</p>
<p>“But what I will tell you is we’re flexible. We’re adaptable. We’ve
been working on these events for, in some cases, years,” he said. “So,
we’re going to be prepared.”</p>
<p>Despite concerns stemming from the New Orleans attack and the Las
Vegas bombing, security officials are confident so far that the
Washington events will proceed safely.</p>
<p>“We are not tracking any credible or specific threats associated with
these events,” said David Sundberg, assistant director in charge at the
FBI’s Washington Field Office.</p>
<p>The law enforcement and security agencies, however, are not taking
any chances, acknowledging that the city and the region are operating in
a heightened threat environment.</p>
<p>The Secret Service said Friday that it was bringing in agents from
across the country to boost staffing levels, which were already the
highest they have been in three years.</p>
<p>Washington’s Metropolitan Police Department said it has added to its
ranks almost 4,000 officers from departments across the country.</p>
<p>The capital’s National Guard Bureau confirmed it also has approved
requests for additional support, including the provision of 500
guardsmen for the Jan. 6 election certification and liaison officers for
the state funeral.</p>
<p>An additional request for 7,800 National Guard soldiers and airmen to
assist with security for the Trump inauguration is pending.</p>
<p>Increased security measures, including barriers and fencing, are
already up in parts of Washington and around the Capitol, but more are
coming.</p>
<p>“A multitude of seen and unseen security measures will operate in
tandem to ensure a comprehensive and seamless security plan comes to
fruition,” McCool said, adding that the measures will include the use of
aerial drones.</p>
<p>“The Secret Service will use drones as part of our comprehensive
security plan,” McCool said. “Do not be alarmed if you see these assets
during the upcoming events or training in the days ahead.”</p>
<p>The Metropolitan Police Department said its increased security
measures would go into effect starting Sunday, with the deployment of
specialized officers around the city to respond to any emergencies.</p>
<p>The U.S. Capitol Police, whose 2,400 officers and civilian employees
are responsible for protecting the Capitol and members of Congress, also
said they were more prepared to handle contingencies than they were four
years ago, when rioters upset with the outcome of the 2020 presidential
election stormed the Capitol, forcing lawmakers to flee and injuring
police officers.</p>
<p>About 1,560 people have been charged with federal crimes in the riot.
So far, about 979 have pleaded guilty, while another 210 have been
convicted.</p>
<p>“Our nation’s capital is prepared to ensure that the legislative
process will proceed without disruption, and our government will have a
peaceful transfer of power,” said Capitol Police Chief J. Thomas Manger,
noting that the force has implemented more than 100 recommendations made
following the 2021 riot.</p>
<p>Officials in Washington are also bracing for potential protests,
saying several planned demonstrations have already gotten required
permits.</p>
<p>“We are committed to upholding the right to peacefully assemble and
protest here in our city,” said Metropolitan Police Chief Pamela
Smith.</p>
<p>“We welcome visitors to come and experience what this incredible city
has to offer, but those who are intentional on unlawful activity should
know that there will be consequences,” Smith said. “However, as I’ve
stated before, when we have special events, and I want to be very clear,
that we will not tolerate any violence, rioting, destruction of
property, or any behavior that threatens the safety and security of our
city.”</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
In one of the Biden administration’s final acts to advance
decarbonization, and after more than
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/green-hydrogen-tax-credit-treasury" target="_self"><u>two
years of deliberation</u></a> and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/final-hydrogen-tax-credit-45v" target="_self"><u>heated
debate</u></a>, the Treasury Department issued the final requirements
governing eligibility for the clean hydrogen tax credit on Friday.
</p>
<p>
At up to $3 per kilogram of clean hydrogen produced, this was the most
generous subsidy in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, and it came with
significant risks if the Treasury did not get the rules right. Hydrogen
could be an important tool to help decarbonize the economy. But without
adequate guardrails, the tax credit could turn it into a shovel that
digs the U.S. deeper into a warming hole by paying out billions of
dollars to projects that increase emissions rather than reducing them.
</p>
<p>
In the final guidelines, the Biden administration recognized the
severity of this risk. It maintained key safeguards from the rules
proposed in 2023, while also making a number of changes, exceptions, and
other “flexibilities” — in the preferred parlance of the Treasury
Department — that sacrifice rigorous emissions accounting in favor of
making the program easier to administer and take advantage of.
</p>
<p>
For example, it kept a set of requirements for hydrogen made from water
and electricity known as the
“<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/hydrogen-tax-credit-rules" target="_self"><u>three
pillars</u></a>.” Broadly, they compel producers to match every hour of
their operation with simultaneous clean energy generation, buy this
energy from newly built sources, and ensure those sources are in the
same general region as the hydrogen plant. Hydrogen production is
extremely energy-intensive, and the pillars were designed to ensure that
it doesn’t end up causing coal and natural gas plants to run more. But
the final rules are less strict than the proposal. For example, the
hourly matching requirement doesn’t apply until 2030, and existing
nuclear plants count as new zero-emissions energy if they are considered
to be at risk of retirement.
</p>
<p>
Finding a balance between limiting emissions and ensuring that the tax
credit unlocks development of this entirely new industry was a
monumental challenge. The Treasury Department received more than 30,000
comments on the proposed rule, compared to about 2,000 for the clean
electricity tax credit, and just 89 for the electric vehicle tax credit.
Senior administration officials told me this may have been the most
complicated of all of the provisions in the IRA. In October, the
department
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/final-hydrogen-tax-credit-45v" target="_self"><u>assured
me</u></a> that the rules would be finished by the end of the year.
</p>
<p>
Energy experts, environmental groups, and industry are still digesting
the rule, and I’ll be looking out for future analyses of the
department’s attempt at compromise. But initial reactions have been
cautiously optimistic.
</p>
<p>
On the environmental side, Dan Esposito from the research nonprofit
Energy Innovation told me his first impression was that the final rule
was “a clear win for the climate” and illustrated “overwhelming,
irrefutable evidence” in favor of the three pillars approach, though he
did have concerns about a few specific elements that I’ll get to in a
moment. Likewise, Conrad Schneider, the U.S. senior director at the
Clean Air Task Force, told me that with the exception of a few caveats,
“we want to give this final rule a thumbs up.”
</p>
<p>
Princeton University researcher Jesse Jenkins, a co-host of Heatmap’s
Shift Key podcast and a vocal advocate for the three pillars approach,
told me by email that, “Overall, Treasury’s final rules represent a
reasonable compromise between competing priorities and will provide
much-needed certainty and a solid foundation for the growth of a
domestic clean hydrogen industry.”
</p>
<p>
On the industry side, the Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Energy Association put
out a somewhat cryptic statement. CEO Frank Wolak applauded the
administration for making “significant improvements” but warned that the
rules were “still extremely complex” and contain several open-ended
parts that will be subject to interpretation by the incoming Trump-Vance
administration.
</p>
<p>
“This issuance of Final Rules closes a long chapter, and now the
industry can look forward to conversations with the new Congress and new
Administration regarding how federal tax and energy policy can most
effectively advance the development of hydrogen in the U.S.,” Wolak
said.
</p>
<p>
Constellation Energy, the country’s biggest supplier of nuclear power,
was among the most vocal critics of the proposed rule and had threatened
to sue the government if it did not create a pathway for hydrogen plants
that are powered by existing nuclear plants to claim the credit. In
response to the final rule, CEO and President Joe Dominguez said he was
“pleased” that the Treasury changed course on this and that the final
rule was “an important step in the right direction.”
</p>
<p>
The California governor’s office, which had criticized the proposed
rule, was also swayed. “The final rules create the certainty needed for
developers to invest in and build clean, renewable hydrogen production
projects in states like California,” Dee Dee Myers, the director of the
Governor’s Office of Business and Economic Development, said in a
statement. The state has
<a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2024/07/17/california-launches-world-leading-hydrogen-hub/" target="_blank"><u>plans</u></a>
to build a $12.6 billion hub for producing and using clean hydrogen.
</p>
<p>
Part of the reason the Treasury needed to find a Goldilocks compromise
that pleased as many stakeholders as possible was to protect the rule
from future lawsuits and lobbying. But not everyone got what they
wanted. For example, the energy developer NextEra, pushed the
administration to get rid of the hourly matching provision, which though
delayed remained essentially untouched. NextEra did not respond to a
request for comment.
</p>
<p>
Companies that fall on the wrong side of the final rules may still
decide to challenge them in court. The next Congress could also make
revisions to the underlying tax code, or the incoming Trump
administration could change the rules to perhaps make them
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/trump-may-end-bidens-green-hydrogen-dream/" target="_blank"><u>more
favorable to hydrogen made from fossil fuels</u></a>. But all of this
would take time — a rule change, for example, would trigger a whole new
notice and comment process. Though the one thing I’ve heard over and
over is that the industry wants certainty, which the final rule
provides, it’s not yet clear whether that will outweigh any remaining
gripes.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, it’s off to the races for the nascent clean hydrogen
industry. Between having clarity on the tax credit, the Department of
Energy’s $7 billion hydrogen hubs grant program, and
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/bipartisan-infrastructure-law-clean-hydrogen-electrolysis-manufacturing-and-0#:~:text=On%20March%2013%2C%202024%2C%20the,in%20the%20growing%20hydrogen%20industry." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>additional
federal grants</u></a> to drive down the cost of clean hydrogen,
companies now have numerous incentives to start building the hydrogen
economy that has received much hype but has yet to
<a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/spotlight/hydrogen-hubs-problems" target="_self"><u>prove
its viability</u></a>. The biggest question now is whether producers
will

<h3>
What exactly happened to the “three pillars”?
</h3>
<p>
On “deliverability,” or the requirement to procure clean energy from the
same region, the rules are largely unchanged, although they do allow for
some flexibility on regional boundaries.
</p>
<p>
As I explained above, the Treasury Department also kept the hourly
matching requirement, but delayed it by two years until 2030 to give the
market more time to set up
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/hydrogen-rule-biden-clean-energy" target="_self"><u>systems
to achieve it</u></a> — a change Schneider said was “really
disappointing” due to the potential emissions consequences. Until then,
companies only have to match their operations with clean energy on an
annual basis, which is a common practice today. The new deadline is
strict, and those that start operations before 2030 will not be
grandfathered in — that is, they’ll have to switch to hourly matching
once that extended clock runs out. In spite of that, the final rules
also ensure that producers won’t be penalized if they are not able to
procure clean energy for <em><em>every single hour</em></em> their plant
operates, an update several groups applauded.
</p>
<p>
On the requirement to procure clean power from newly built sources, also
known as “incrementality,” the department made much bigger changes. It
kept an overarching definition that “incremental” generators are those
built within three years of the hydrogen plant coming into service, but
added three major exceptions:
</p>
<p>
<strong>1.</strong> If the hydrogen facility buys power from an existing
nuclear plant that’s at risk of retirement.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2.</strong> If the hydrogen facility is in a state that has both
a robust clean electricity standard and a broad, binding, greenhouse gas
cap, such as a cap and trade system. Currently, only California and
Washington pass this test.
</p>
<p>
<span></span><strong>3.</strong> If the hydrogen facility buys power
from an existing natural gas or coal plant that has added new carbon
capture and storage capacity within three years of the hydrogen project
coming into service.
</p>
<h3>
What does this mean for nuclear plants?
</h3>
<p>
The hydrogen tax credit is so lucrative that environmental groups and
energy analysts were concerned it would drive companies like
Constellation to start selling all their nuclear power to hydrogen
plants instead of to regular energy consumers, which could drive up
prices and induce more fossil fuel emissions.
</p>
<p>
The final rules try to limit this possibility by only allowing existing
reactors that are at risk of retirement to qualify. But the definition
of “at risk of retirement” is loose. It includes “merchant” nuclear
power plants — those that sell at least half their power on the
wholesale electricity market rather than to regulated utilities — as
well as plants that have just a single reactor, which the rules note
have lower or more uncertain revenue and higher operational costs.
Looking at the Nuclear Energy Institute’s
<a href="https://nei.org/about-nei" target="_blank"><u>list of
plants</u></a>, merchant plants make up roughly 40% of the total. All of
Constellation Energy’s plants are merchant plants.
</p>
<p>
There are additional tests — the plant has to have had average annual
gross receipts of less than 4.375 cents per kilowatt hour for at least
two calendar years between 2017 and 2021. It also has to obtain a
minimum 10-year power purchase agreement with the hydrogen company.
Beyond that, the reactors that meet this definition are limited to
selling no more than 200 megawatts to hydrogen companies, which is
roughly 20% for the average reactor.
</p>
<p>
Esposito, who has closely analyzed the potential emissions consequences
of using existing nuclear plants to power hydrogen production, was not
convinced by the safeguards. “I don’t love the power price look back,”
he told me, “because that’s not especially indicative of the future —
particularly this high load growth future that we’re quickly approaching
with data centers and everything. It’s very possible power prices could
go up from that, and then all of a sudden, the nuclear plants would have
been fine without hydrogen.”
</p>
<p>
As for the 200 megawatt cap, Esposito said it was better than nothing,
but he feels “it’s kind of an implicit admission that it’s not really,
truly clean” to produce hydrogen with the energy from these nuclear
plants.
</p>
<p>
Schneider, on the other hand, said the safeguards for nuclear-powered
hydrogen projects were adequate. While a lot of plants are theoretically
eligible, not all of their electricity will be eligible, he said.
</p>
<h3>
Are there concerns about the state policy exemption?
</h3>
<p>
The rules assert that in states that meet the two criteria of a clean
electricity standard and a binding cap on emissions, “any increased
electricity load is highly unlikely to cause induced grid emissions.”
</p>
<p>
But in a
<a href="https://energyinnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/Energy-Innovation-45V-Exemptions-Need-Strong-Guardrails.pdf" target="_blank"><u>paper</u></a>
published in February, Energy Innovation explored the potential
consequences of this exemption in California. It found that hydrogen
projects could have ripple effects on the cap and trade market, pushing
up the state’s carbon price and triggering the release of extra carbon
emission allowances. “In other words, the California program is more of
a ‘soft’ cap than a binding one — the emissions budget ‘expands or
contracts in response to price bounds set by the legislature and
[California Air Resources Board],’” the report says.
</p>
<p>
Esposito thinks the exemption is a risk, but that it requires further
analysis and he’s not sounding the alarm just yet. He said it could come
down to other factors, including how economical hydrogen production in
California ends up being.
</p>
<h3>
What about hydrogen made from methane?
</h3>
<p>
Producers are also eligible for the tax credit if they make hydrogen the
conventional way, by “reforming” natural gas, but capture the emissions
released in the process. For this pathway, the Treasury had to clarify
several accounting questions.
</p>
<p>
First, there’s the question of how producers should account for methane
leaked into the atmosphere upstream of the hydrogen plant, such as from
wells and pipelines. The proposal had suggested using a national average
of 0.9%. But researchers found this would
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/blue-hydrogen-permian-marcellus" target="_self"><u>wildly
underestimate</u></a> the true warming impact of hydrogen produced from
natural gas. It could also underestimate emissions from natural gas
producers that have taken steps to reduce methane leakage. “We branded
that as one size fits none,” Schneider told me.
</p>
<p>
The final rules create a path for producers to use more accurate,
project-specific methane emissions rates in the future once the
Department of Energy updates a lifecycle emissions tool that companies
have to use called the “GREET” model. The Environmental Protection
Agency recently passed new methane emissions laws that will enable it to
collect better data on leakage, which will help the DOE update the
model.
</p>
<p>
Schneider said that’s a step in the right direction, though it will
depend on how quickly the GREET model is updated. His bigger concern is
if the Trump administration weakens or eliminates the EPA’s methane
emissions regulations.
</p>
<h3>
Can producers just buy renewable natural gas certificates?
</h3>
<p>
The Treasury also opened up the potential for companies to produce
hydrogen from alternative, cleaner sources of methane, like gas captured
from wastewater, animal manure, and coal mines. (The original rule
included a pathway for using gas captured from landfills.) In reality,
hydrogen plants taking this approach are unlikely to use gas directly
from these sources, but rather procure certificates that say they have
“booked” this cleaner gas and can “claim” the environmental benefits.
</p>
<p>
Leading up to the final rule, some climate advocates were
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/hydrogen-tax-credit-final-methane-offsets" target="_self"><u>concerned</u></a>
that this system would give a boost to methane-based hydrogen production
over electricity-based production, as it’s cheaper to buy renewable
natural gas certificates than it is to split water molecules. Existing
markets for these credits also often overestimate their benefits — for
example, California’s low carbon fuel system gives biogas captured from
dairy farms a negative carbon intensity score, even though these
projects don’t literally remove carbon from the atmosphere.
</p>
<p>
The Treasury tried to improve its emissions estimates for each of these
alternative methane sources to make them more accurate, but negative
carbon intensity scores are still possible.
</p>
<p>
The department did make one significant change here, however. It
specified that companies can’t just buy a little bit of cleaner methane
and then average it with regular fossil-based methane — each must be
considered separately for determining tax credit eligibility. Jenkins,
of Princeton, told me that without this rule, huge amounts of hydrogen
made from regular natural gas could qualify.
</p>
<p>
Producers also won’t be able to take this “book and claim” approach
until markets adapt to the Treasury’s reporting requirements, which
isn’t expected until at least 2027.

that represents a decline in annual sales from 2023 — Tesla’s first
annual decline in more than 10 years, back when the company’s deliveries
were counted in the hundreds or single-digit thousands — although the
fourth quarter figure is a record for quarterly deliveries. Tesla had

around 515,000 deliveries to meet its “slight growth” goals. The company
had cited “sustained macroeconomic headwinds” weighing on the broader
electric vehicle market in its most recent investor letter, and again
referred to “ongoing macroeconomic conditions” to explain the miss on
deliveries. While Tesla’s car business appears to have stalled to some
extent, the energy storage business is another story. The company said
that in the fourth quarter of last year it had deployed 11
gigawatt-hours of storage, and 31.4 gigawatt-hours in the year as a
whole. If Tesla’s deployment rate in 2025 merely matched its fourth
quarter rate, it would mean 40% annual growth.

<li>Report: Biden to permanently ban some offshore drilling</li>

<p>
President Biden is expected to issue an executive order permanently
banning new offshore oil and gas drilling in large sections of U.S.

citing unnamed sources. As soon as Monday, Biden will invoke the Outer
Continental Shelf Lands Act, a 72-year-old law that gives the president
authority to ban drilling, but doesn’t include any wording to allow
presidents to revoke a ban. That means President-elect Donald Trump will
not be able to easily reverse the move. Environmental groups applauded
the report. “Restricting offshore drilling is a big win for the climate,
marine wildlife, coastal communities, and economies, and would be yet
another chapter in President Biden’s historic climate legacy,”

Nippon Steel’s bid to purchase US Steel</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday followed through on
his pledge to block Nippon Steel’s $14.9 billion bid for U.S. Steel,
citing concerns the deal could hurt national security.</p>
<p>The move, long expected, cuts off a critical lifeline of capital for
the beleaguered American icon, which has said it would have to idle key
mills without the nearly $3 billion in promised investment from the
Japanese firm.</p>
<p>It also represents the final chapter in a high-profile national
security review, led by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the
United States, CFIUS, which vets investment for national security risks
and had until December 23 to approve, extend the timeline or recommend
Biden block the deal.</p>
<p>The proposed tie-up has faced high-level opposition within the United
States since it was announced a year ago, with both Biden and his
incoming successor Donald Trump taking aim at it as they sought to woo
union voters in the swing state of Pennsylvania, where U.S. Steel is
headquartered. Trump and Biden both asserted the company should remain
American-owned.</p>
<p>The merger appeared to be on the fast-track to be blocked after the
companies received an August 31 letter from CFIUS, seen by Reuters,
arguing the deal could hurt the supply of steel needed for critical
transportation, construction and agriculture projects.</p>
<p>But Nippon Steel countered that its investments, made by a company
from an allied nation, would in fact shore up U.S. Steel’s output, and
it won a 90-day review extension. That extension gave CFIUS until after
the November election to make a decision, fueling hope among supporters
that a calmer political climate could help the deal’s approval.</p>
<p>But hopes were shattered in December when CFIUS set the stage for
Biden to block it in a 29-page letter by raising allegedly unresolved
national security risks, Reuters exclusively reported.</p>

Meat Could Be Cooked Under Trump</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-03, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
The first Trump administration helped advance the dream of cultivated
meat grown from animal cells. The second Trump administration might try
to kill the dream.
</p>
<p>
Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who could control the fate of cultivated meat in
America as President-elect Trump’s nominee for health secretary, has
suggested that it’s an
<a href="https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1594049450179284993" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>unsafe</u></a>
and unnatural corporate science experiment designed to
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/rfkjr/posts/lab-grown-meat-offers-private-corporations-the-opportunity-to-place-intellectual/3055760984750630/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>enrich
techno-billionaires</u></a>. Vice President-elect JD Vance has called
cultivated meat
“<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-in/news/india/republican-nominee-jd-vance-says-indian-food-better-calls-lab-meat-disgusting/ar-AA1tqlx6" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>disgusting</u></a>,”
Donald Trump, Jr. has
<a href="https://x.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1658864512093528065" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>proposed
banning it</u></a>, and Governor Ron DeSantis, Trump’s rumored backup
choice for Pentagon secretary, has
<a href="https://heatmap.news/lifestyle/lab-grown-meat-florida-desantis" target="_self"><u>already
banned it</u></a> in Florida.
</p>
<p>
The timing is brutal for a potentially climate-friendly new
industry<strong> </strong>that had hoped to start competing with
conventional meat in 2025. Cultivated meat executives are trying<strong>
</strong>to project optimism about the next four years, pointing out
that President Trump’s aides created a constructive regulatory framework
for their products during his first term. Republicans who support
innovation, competition, and economic nationalism, they argue, ought to
support high-tech manufacturing startups in the U.S. Trump ally Elon
Musk’s own startup, SpaceX, has flown cultivated meat into space, while
his brother Kimbal, an investor in the cultivated meat venture Upside
Foods, once cooked its slaughter-free chicken on stage at a CNN event.
</p>
<p>
Still, the industry is clearly nervous. Trumpworld is divided on food
issues between “Make America Healthy Again” techno-skeptics like Kennedy
and conventional Republicans aligned with traditional livestock
industries, but there’s opposition to cultivated meat on both sides of
that divide. Cultivated meat executives met with their regulators from
the Food and Drug Administration and U.S. Department of Agriculture last
month at Tufts University,<strong> </strong>and while several attendees
told me the discussion focused on how to get safe cultivated products to
market, everyone in the room knew that road<strong> </strong>might get
blocked on January 20.
</p>
<p>
San Francisco-based Mission Barns is waiting for FDA approval to blend
its cultivated pork fat into plant-based meatballs and bacon; it already
has
<a href="https://missionbarns.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>photos
on its website</u></a> of the boxes it intends to sell in supermarkets.
But its leaders are keenly aware that Kennedy may soon oversee the FDA —
and that he’s expressed the same kind of doubts about “lab-grown meat”
that he’s expressed about food dyes, genetically modified grain, and
heavily processed foods in general.
</p>
<p>
“The election really shouldn’t affect our safety review. We know these
folks care about protecting the American economy and ensuring American
self-sufficiency,” Bianca Lê, the head of external affairs for Mission
Barns, told me. “Obviously, though, anything can happen.”
</p>
<p>
One source close to Kennedy told me he probably wouldn’t propose banning
what he calls “lab-grown meat,” but he’s likely to create regulatory
hurdles that could keep startups like Mission Barns in perpetual limbo.
When I asked if that meant making applicants for FDA approval jump
through a million hoops, the Kennedy ally replied: “Maybe half a
million.”
</p>
<p>
Growing meat from animal cells without killing animals was just a
science-fiction fantasy until 2013, when the Dutch scientist Mark Post
unveiled a burger patty he grew in his lab from bovine cells. That
single burger cost $330,000 to produce, but investors poured more than
$3 billion into hundreds of cultivated meat and seafood ventures over
the next decade. Since then, they’ve brought down their costs per
pound<strong> </strong>by about 99.99%.
</p>
<p>
Culturing cells into meat is still not as cheap as growing meat inside
animals, but the startups are only making tiny quantities, and they’re
confident they can approach price parity with animal products once they
can scale up their production. The Israeli firm Believer Meats is
building America’s first commercial-scale cultivated meat plant in North
Carolina, and several other startups are planning to build U.S.
factories once they receive regulatory approval.
</p>
<p>
But that’s been a slow process.
</p>
<p>
Trump’s<strong> </strong>first-term FDA head, Scott Gottlieb, and
Agriculture Secretary, Sonny Perdue, worked with cultivated meat
startups as well as conventional meat interests to create a joint
regulatory process that almost everyone liked. In 2023, the Biden
administration gave the Bay Area startups Upside (with investors
including Cargill and Tyson as well as Kimbal Musk and Bill Gates) and
Good Meat (the cultivated spin-off of the plant-based egg company Eat
Just)<strong> </strong>the go-ahead to sell cultivated chicken filets.
</p>
<p>
But both companies envisioned the filets as proof-of-concept marketing
plays to demonstrate that slaughter-free animal meat was real, not
mass-market products they could take to commercial scale. Both sold
their chicken to a limited number of diners in just one restaurant, and
both ended the promotions this year.
</p>
<p>
So cultivated meat is currently unavailable in America. It’s illegal in
Florida and Alabama, which both enacted bans in May. That leaves more
than two dozen companies, including Upside and Good Meat, waiting for
FDA approval for less expensive products they can take to market. Upside
hopes<strong> </strong>to sell a product mixing cultivated chicken
shreds with plant proteins at a price point competitive with organic
chicken. Startups like Blue Nalu, which is cultivating bluefin tuna toro
in San Diego, and Wildtype, which is cultivating salmon nigiri in San
Francisco, believe they’ll be able to compete with high-end
seafood<strong> </strong>as soon as they can get the federal go-ahead
and build commercial factories.
</p>
<p>
The industry’s party line is that its products are safe, it’s been
cooperative with regulators, and it has no reason to expect political
meddling by the new political appointees.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t see the Trump administration doing bold nanny-state policy that
interferes with consumer freedom,” Suzi Gerber, a nutrition scientist
who leads the Association for Meat, Poultry and Seafood Innovation, an
industry trade group, told me. “I think they’re going to end up on the
side of American businesses and innovators, supporting the American
dream.”
</p>
<p>
Globally, the strongest arguments for cultivated meat have usually
emphasized the downsides of animal agriculture. Livestock operations use
about a third of the land on Earth, driving much of the world’s
deforestation, and cattle are a leading source of planet-warming
methane. Cultivated meat would avoid those problems — as well as
concerns about the mistreatment of animals and slaughterhouse workers,
the overuse of antibiotics, and the fouling of rivers and lakes with
manure.
</p>
<p>
But Trump doesn’t seem concerned about any of those problems, and even
tech icon Musk, who
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/elon-musk-climate-enemy" target="_self"><u>used
to talk a lot</u></a> about climate change when his main focus was
Tesla’s electric cars, falsely claimed on Joe Rogan’s podcast that the
idea that animal agriculture contributes to global warming is “hot
bullshit.” So the alternative protein sector, like the clean energy
sector, is learning to
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/how-to-speak-republican" target="_self"><u>speak
the MAGA language</u></a> of economic nationalism, arguing that if the
U.S. regulatory process bogs down, nations like Singapore, Israel, and
China will dominate the future of literal factory farming.
</p>
<p>
“The first Trump administration was very clear that it wanted this kind
of innovation to stay in this country,” Upside founder and CEO Uma
Valeti told me. “This isn’t about getting rid of animal meat. It’s about
creating the next great American industry.”
</p>
<p>
The second Trump administration seems more likely to pick on any
industry associated with the kind of climate concerns aired by
Democrats. It doesn’t help that cultivated meat is also considered a
threat by cattlemen and other livestock interests who reliably support
Republicans. And then, of course, there’s RFK.
</p>
<p>
“I can’t remember ever seeing this level of uncertainty,” Eric Schulze,
a molecular biologist and former FDA regulator who consults for several
cultivated meat startups, told me. “The new team will have to decide if
it supports typical Republican values of free enterprise and
entrepreneurship, or if they want to create an over-regulatory
environment that would be a first for the FDA under conservative
leadership. The honest answer is we don’t know.”
</p>
<p>
The Biden administration isn’t rushing to approve applications before
leaving office, and there’s not much the companies can do except wait.
After the frenzy of interest and venture funding around cultivated meat
several years ago, some once-promising startups have shut down,
including New Age Eats and Sci-Fi Foods.
</p>
<p>
Wildtype raised more than $120 million during the initial burst, and
it’s got a nice story to tell about producing nutritious salmon without
pesticides, antibiotics, or microplastics in the U.S., instead of
depleting wild salmon stocks or relying on environmentally damaging fish
farms overseas. CEO Justin Kolbeck is confident that once it reaches
commercial scale, growing fish filets from cells in a brewery will be
more efficient and cheaper than feeding fish that have to swim, poop,
and grow guts, tails, and bones that people don’t eat. But he’s got 85
employees, and he’s burning through his cash.
</p>
<p>
“How long can we wait? Not forever, that’s for sure,” Kolbeck told me.
“But we try not to get too spun up about stuff we can’t control.
Startups have a million ways to die, and regulatory delays are just one
of them.”

face challenges despite control of Congress, White House</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The 119th U.S. Congress will come into session Friday.
After a contentious government funding battle last month, though,
Republican Party control of both houses of Congress and presidency faces
challenges.</p>
<p>The Senate enters the new session as Republicans take the majority
from Democrats and Senator Mitch McConnell steps away from party
leadership for the first time in 18 years. Republican Senator John Thune
has already been selected to lead the Senate as majority leader.</p>
<p>Republicans will hold a 53-47 seat majority, well below the 60 votes
needed to advance most legislation.</p>
<p>In the House, where Republicans hold a narrow 219-215 majority, the
focus will be on votes for speaker. Current Speaker Mike Johnson’s
position is in jeopardy after his deal last month with Democrats to keep
the government funded and open.</p>
<p>It would take only as few as two Republicans to vote against Johnson
to put his speakership in jeopardy.  Democrats are expected to nominate
Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries for the speakership but are likely to
fall short by a few votes.</p>
<p>President-elect Donald Trump posted his support for Johnson on social
media Monday, saying the speaker was “a good, hard-working, religious
man.”</p>
<p>But Republican representatives Chip Roy and Thomas Massie have
already stated their doubts about his leadership and Trump ally and
adviser Steve Bannon has called on Republicans to remove Johnson from
leadership.</p>
<p>“Mr. Johnson caught a lot of fire from his GOP colleagues. And he has
an extraordinarily limited margin for his majority, just a handful of
people,” Kevin Kosar, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute,
told VOA via Zoom.</p>
<p>Two years ago, at the start of another Congress, Republican Kevin
McCarthy faced similar challenges to his bid for the speakership. He was
finally elected on the 15th round of voting.</p>
<p>If Johnson, or another Republican, is unable to garner enough votes
for the speakership the chamber could be without a leader in time for
the official certification of Trump’s electoral victory on Jan. 6.
Whoever does lead the House will, at least temporarily, hold an even
tighter majority after Trump takes office on Jan. 20, as he has picked
two House Republicans to join his administration.</p>
<p>Traditionally, the first 100 days of a new presidency and Congress
are a time for an ambitious legislative agenda.</p>
<p>“He’s going to hit tariffs very hard. He’s going to focus on the
border, and executive orders related to immigration and immigrants,
particularly from Mexico and Muslim countries. And then he’s going to
work on any compromises he can to get through the legislative agenda on
things affecting the economy, groceries, as he likes to call it,” Casey
Burgat, a professor at The George Washington University in Washington,
told VOA via Zoom.</p>

Orleans takes first steps forward after terrorist attack</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW ORLEANS — Less than 48 hours after Wednesday morning’s attack on
their city’s iconic French Quarter neighborhood, New Orleanians are
trying to find a way forward.</p>
<p>It’s something they have had to do countless times in the Crescent
City’s 307-year history. In the past two decades alone, residents and
businesses have come back from a series of disasters including a
record-breaking oil spill, the public health catastrophe of being one of
the nation’s first coronavirus hotspots and, of course, Hurricanes Ida
and Katrina.</p>
<p>This latest disaster — labeled a terrorist attack by the FBI — hit
the city at 3:15 a.m. on New Year’s Day when 42-year-old U.S. citizen
Shamsud-Din Jabbar plowed a white pickup truck through three blocks of
Bourbon Street, killing 14 and seriously injuring many more.</p>
<p>As the city mourns, local restaurateur Ralph Brennan believes his
fellow residents will react in their unique New Orleans way: with
defiance in the face of a challenge and love for their shared home.</p>
<p>“We’ve been through this before with COVID and Katrina,” he said. One
of Brennan’s restaurants, Red Fish Grill, was at ground zero of
Wednesday’s attack. It was allowed to reopen with the rest of Bourbon
Street on Thursday afternoon.</p>
<p>“Every time there is a disaster,” Brennan continued, “it is our goal
to come back as quickly as possible. We want to show the world that New
Orleans is safe, and that this tragedy is just a blip in the history of
one of the most special cities on the planet.”</p>
<p>Processing grief</p>
<p>Go to the corner of Canal and Bourbon streets and the first thing
you’ll notice are reporters, police officers, traffic barriers and
caution tape. Look closer, and you’ll see a city cautiously determining
how to proceed. A jazz trumpeter plays the national anthem nearby.
Employees from a neighborhood restaurant hand out free meals to first
responders. Visitors pass by on their way to the Sugar Bowl, postponed
to Thursday because of the attack.</p>
<p>But it’s not just downtown. In every corner of New Orleans, residents
are wrestling with trauma.</p>
<p>Tom Ramsey is a former chef in the city who now supports
mass-catering efforts following disasters and along the U.S.-Mexico
border. He woke up on Wednesday morning to dozens of missed calls and
text messages asking if he was OK.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know what they were talking about until I checked the news
and saw what happened,” Ramsey said.</p>
<p>His first reaction was to contact everyone he knew was in the French
Quarter that night. Anything, he said, not to let the news sink in.</p>
<p>“Then, eventually, everyone was accounted for,” Ramsey said. “I
looked at my wife, I put my face in my hands, and I cried — the kind of
crying where my chest was heaving, and I was making sounds. I hadn’t
felt the kind of grief I felt for New Orleans in that moment since I was
in New York on 9/11.”</p>
<p>Ongoing trauma</p>
<p>Mental health experts like Erin Stevens, executive director of Ellie
Mental Health Louisiana in New Orleans, said she is worried that
residents with so much past trauma may have difficulty dealing with this
event.</p>
<p>“When you have already experienced significant trauma, it can cause
you to feel new and future stressors more intensely,” she said. I’m
especially worried about people who are isolated — who don’t have a
support system.”</p>
<p>However, Stevens says if handled correctly, past trauma can equip you
to handle future stressors more effectively, because resilience is
something that is built.</p>
<p>Some New Orleanians seem to have taken lessons from past challenges.
For example, several mental health professionals have decided to help
their community by offering free mental health services. And Allison
Bullach, a local photographer, is offering free headshots to anyone who
gives blood to support the attack’s victims.</p>
<p>“I think we just want to find our way to help,” Bullach told VOA,
“and I had read that donating blood for victims was a major need.”</p>
<p>“I’m only one person,” she continued, “but if I can find a way to
encourage three or four or five more people to help, then I should do
it.”</p>
<p>The show must go on?</p>
<p>The past year has been a massive one for New Orleans tourism. In
addition to a successful Mardi Gras and Jazz Fest, 2024 visitor numbers
were bolstered thanks to a three-day stop by Taylor Swift’s Eras
Tour.</p>
<p>Early 2025 looked to be equally promising. The Sugar Bowl, Super Bowl
LIX, and Carnival season culminating in Mardi Gras are all big news for
a local economy so heavily reliant on tourism.</p>
<p>As a result, the timing of the attack is a worry for Crescent City
businesses.</p>
<p>“Of course, it hurts to have to close during one of our busiest times
of the year,” said Brennan, owner of Red Fish Grill. “We understand why
it was necessary, but it doesn’t mean it doesn’t hurt.”</p>
<p>“But where I got really worried,” he added, “is how this impacts
tourism moving forward for Carnival season and the Super Bowl. New
Orleans businesses depend on tourism from these big events.”</p>
<p>For some businesses, however, every day matters. Coming off a
challenging December, that is definitely the case for Tara Francolini,
owner of Francolini’s, a popular sandwich shop.</p>
<p>“More than anything, I want to give our staff a day to grieve for
their city,” she told VOA. “But the losses we suffered in December were
tremendous, and we need … steady business so we can do basic things like
pay our bills and our employees. I’m worried that staying open
diminishes the atrocities that the families of the victims are feeling,
and it all makes me feel like an awful human being.”</p>
<p>Resilience, a loaded word</p>
<p>On Wednesday night, less than 24 hours after the attack, Louisiana
Governor Jeff Landry ate dinner in the French Quarter, steps from
Bourbon Street. He posted a photo from outside the restaurant, a message
to would-be visitors that this “resilient city,” as he and so many
others call it, was safe and “open for business.”</p>
<p>The word “resilient” seems to be attached to the city any time there
is a disaster. Many residents identify with it, proof that they can
bounce back from anything.</p>
<p>Increasingly, however, some say the term is allowing leaders off the
hook for their failings. One such critic is Andrew Stephens, owner of
Sports Drink, a coffee shop in New Orleans’ Irish Channel
neighborhood.</p>
<p>“They call us resilient after they shirk their responsibilities to
the public,” Stephens said, “It’s pandering. I don’t want us to be
resilient. I want us to be safe.”</p>

courts won’t refer US Supreme Court justice Thomas to attorney general
over ethics</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The federal courts will not refer allegations that
Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas may have violated ethics laws to
the Justice Department, the judiciary’s policymaking body said
Thursday.</p>
<p>Thomas has agreed to follow updated requirements on reporting trips
and gifts, including clearer guidelines on hospitality from friends, the
U.S. Judicial Conference wrote to Democratic senators who had called for
an investigation into undisclosed acceptance of luxury trips.</p>
<p>Thomas has previously said he wasn’t required to disclose the many
trips he and his wife took that were paid for by wealthy benefactors
like Republican megadonor Harlan Crow because they are close personal
friends. The court didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment
Thursday.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court adopted its first code of ethics in 2023 in the
face of sustained criticism, though the new code still lacks a means of
enforcement.</p>
<p>It’s unclear whether the law allows the U.S. Judicial Conference to
make a criminal referral regarding a Supreme Court justice, U.S.
District Judge Robert Conrad wrote. He serves as secretary for the
conference, which sets policy for the federal court system and is led by
Chief Justice John Roberts.</p>
<p>A referral in this case isn’t necessary, Conrad said, because two
Democratic senators called on Attorney General Merrick Garland to
appoint a special counsel over the summer. No such appointment has been
publicly made.</p>
<p>The group Fix the Court said the financial disclosure law is clear
and should apply to justices. “The Conference’s letters further
underscore the need for Congress to create a new and transparent
mechanism to investigate the justices for ethics violations since the
Conference is unwilling to act upon the one method we had presumed
existed to do that,” Executive Director Gabe Roth said in a
statement.</p>
<p>Conrad also sent a similar response to a separate complaint from a
conservative legal group, the Center for Renewing America, in regard to
Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson’s reports on the source of her husband’s
consulting income. Jackson has since amended her disclosures and agreed
to updated reporting requirements, Conrad wrote.</p>

says Trump could be decisive in stopping war in Ukraine</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Thursday that U.S.
President-elect Donald Trump could be “decisive” in the outcome of the
yearslong war between Ukraine and Russia.</p>
<p>“Trump can be decisive. For us, this is the most important thing,”
Zelenskyy said in an interview with Ukrainian television.</p>
<p>Zelenskyy said Trump had told him he would be one of the first to
visit Washington after the presidential inauguration later this
month.</p>
<p>“His qualities are indeed there,” Zelenskyy said about Trump. “He can
be decisive in this war. He is capable of stopping [Russian President
Vladimir] Putin, or, to put it more fairly, help us stop Putin.”</p>
<p>Trump has previously said he would be able to stop the war in Ukraine
in one day, but he has never detailed how he would accomplish that.</p>
<p>Zelenskyy’s comments came as the Ukrainian military said it had
carried out a high-precision strike Thursday on a Russian command post
in Maryino, in Russia’s Kursk region.</p>
<p>“These strikes disrupt the ability of the Russian Federation to
conduct terrorism against innocent Ukrainian civilians,” the Ukrainian
military said in a statement on Telegram.</p>
<p>Russia’s military said air defense units had downed four Ukrainian
missiles in the region. The regional governor said the strikes had
damaged a high-rise apartment building and other buildings in a nearby
village.</p>
<p>Another post from the Ukrainian military showed a video of what the
military said was damage to a Russian base in Ivanivskoye, next to
Maryino.</p>
<p>A school, pharmacy and apartment building were among the structures
damaged in the strike, Kursk regional Governor Alexander Khinshtein
said.</p>
<p>VOA could not immediately verify the reports.</p>
<p>Ukraine launched an incursion into Russia five months ago. Ukrainian
forces remain in the Kursk region, but the Russian military says much of
the lost territory has been regained.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Russia said it had attacked energy facilities in Ukraine
that support Kyiv’s military-industrial complex.</p>
<p>The Russian Defense Ministry said that over the past 24 hours, it had
used its air force, drones, missiles and artillery to target energy
facilities, military airfields and Ukrainian military personnel across
multiple locations.</p>
<p>VOA could not independently verify that report.</p>
<p>Russian forces have been advancing quickly on the eastern front of
Ukraine.</p>
<p>“They are putting pressure on our boys, who are exhausted, and that
is a fact. We will do everything to at least stabilize the front in
January,” Zelenskyy said in his Thursday interview.</p>
<p>Ukraine’s military said Thursday that it had shot down 47 drones
Russian forces launched overnight at areas in central and eastern
Ukraine.</p>
<p>Russia used a total of 72 drones in its attacks, the military
said.</p>
<p>Ukrainian air defenses shot down drones over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv,
Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kirovohrad, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Poltava,
Odessa and Sumy regions.</p>
<p>Officials in those areas did not immediately report any major
damage.</p>
<p>Russia’s Defense Ministry said Thursday that its forces had destroyed
13 Ukrainian drones, mostly along the Russia-Ukraine border. Intercepts
took place in Bryansk, Belgorod, Kursk, Kaluga and Voronezh, it
said.</p>
<p>The governors of Bryansk and Kaluga said there were no reports of
casualties or damage in their regions.</p>
<p>Thursday’s attacks came a day after Russian forces killed at least
two people in Kyiv.</p>
<p>Some information for this report came from Reuters.</p>

<h2 id="carter-leaves-complex-legacy-on-korean-peninsula">Carter leaves
complex legacy on Korean Peninsula</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter has a complex legacy
on the Korean Peninsula, former U.S. officials say, including the vital
role he played in defusing a crisis between the United States and North
Korea in 1994.</p>
<p>Thomas Hubbard, former U.S. ambassador to South Korea from 2001 to
2004, told VOA Korean by phone Wednesday that Carter’s interventions in
North Korea significantly lowered tensions, despite somewhat negative
reactions from President Bill Clinton’s administration.</p>
<p>“His initial involvement in the early 1990s when he went to North
Korea, met with Kim Il Sung, he opened an opportunity that lowered the
chances of war and led to the Agreed Framework,” said Hubbard, referring
to Carter’s meeting in June 1994 with late North Korean founder Kim Il
Sung.</p>
<p>Hubbard was a principal negotiator of the Agreed Framework signed by
the U.S. and North Korea in Geneva in October 1994, aimed at ending
North Korea’s nuclear weapons program.</p>
<p>VOA Korean sought comment from the Permanent Mission of North Korea
to the United Nations, but did not receive a response.</p>
<p>Carter, who was the 39th U.S. president and served from 1977 to 1981,
visited Pyongyang as North Korea’s declaration of withdrawal from the
International Atomic Energy Agency created the first major crisis over
North Korea’s nuclear weapons program.</p>
<p>He crossed the inter-Korean border in the demilitarized zone (DMZ)
from the South Korean side with his wife, Rosalynn, and held talks for
two days in Pyongyang with the North Korean leader.</p>
<p>Carter was the first former U.S. president to visit the isolated
country and to meet North Korea’s head of state.</p>
<p>Controversial mission</p>
<p>At the time, North Korea threatened to expel IAEA inspectors,
demonstrating its intent to develop nuclear weapons, and the United
States pushed for U.N. sanctions on North Korea. It was speculated that
Clinton was planning a preemptive attack on North Korea.</p>
<p>After the talks between Carter and Kim, North Korea agreed to freeze
its nuclear program in exchange for a resumption of dialogue with the
U.S. The breakthrough led to the first nuclear deal between the U.S. and
North Korea in 40 years, although the agreement fell through in
2003.</p>
<p>Daniel Russel, former assistant secretary of state for East Asian and
Pacific affairs, said in an email to VOA Korean on Monday, “It is not
hyperbole to say that it felt like the brink of war. We were right at
the edge of the cliff.”</p>
<p>As a young diplomat, Russel and then-U.S. Ambassador to South Korea
James Laney helped prepare Carter for his trip across the DMZ.</p>
<p>North Korea warned that sanctions would be treated as “an act of war”
and started the process to withdraw from the Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, Russel said.</p>
<p>“The immediate crisis was averted. We had been really close to a war,
and Jimmy Carter saved us from that,” he said.</p>
<p>Gary Samore, former White House coordinator for arms control and
weapons of mass destruction during the Obama administration, said
Carter’s mission was “ultimately successful, but the Clinton
administration was unhappy because Carter didn’t try to get any
constraint on North Korea’s nuclear program as part of a resolution of
that immediate conflict.”</p>
<p>Hubbard offered a similar view.</p>
<p>“What made it controversial, I think, is that Carter accepted some
positions that went beyond the Clinton administration’s positions with
North Korea, and then he announced them publicly on CNN before even
informing us,” Hubbard said. “That was quite a shock.”</p>
<p>CNN, which closely followed Carter’s visit to Pyongyang, first
reported that Carter told the North Koreans the U.S. had stopped
pursuing international sanctions against North Korea, which Clinton soon
flatly denied.</p>
<p>Carter visited North Korea twice more in 2010 and 2011 on private
humanitarian missions. While his visit in 2010 secured the release of
American teacher Aijalon Mahli Gomes, who had been imprisoned in North
Korea for seven months, he failed to meet with Kim Jong Il, who
succeeded his father, Kim Il Sung, on either trip.</p>
<p>While his post-presidential efforts on the Korean Peninsula are more
widely known, Carter’s presidency had another moment of controversy, as
his push for the withdrawal of U.S. ground troops from South Korea shook
the U.S.-South Korea alliance.</p>
<p>Push for human rights</p>
<p>When he assumed the presidency, Carter was determined not to overlook
the human rights abuses of U.S. allies. He found it problematic that the
United States would support a country under a repressive government. To
him, South Korea was such a country then.</p>
<p>“One of the big things Carter campaigned on was human rights,” Samore
said. “At the time, South Korea was ruled by a military government, and
he wanted to reduce relations with countries that were not
democracies.”</p>
<p>The former president, who pledged to withdraw U.S. troops from South
Korea during his presidential campaign, had a war of words with
then-South Korean President Park Chung-hee over the issue during his
1979 visit to South Korea, according to diplomatic documents from both
countries.</p>
<p>According to a declassified document from the White House, Park
criticized the planned withdrawal of U.S. Forces Korea, arguing the idea
itself had emboldened North Korea. To this, Carter suggested that South
Korea should increase defense spending.</p>
<p>Joseph DeTrani, former special envoy for the Six-Party Talks with
North Korea from 2003 to 2006, told VOA Korean on Monday by phone that
one of the factors behind Carter’s decision was the burgeoning U.S.
relationship with China, which fought against the U.S. during the
1950-53 Korean War in support of North Korea.</p>
<p>“We were normalizing relations with the People’s Republic of China.
There was a sense that war was not going to break out on the Korean
Peninsula,” said DeTrani, who also served as director of East Asia
operations at the Central Intelligence Agency.</p>
<p>“Those people who follow developments on the Korean Peninsula felt
that was not the right decision,” he said.</p>
<p>U.S. troop withdrawal from the East Asian ally was ultimately not
realized, largely over opposition from the U.S. Congress and the
military.</p>
<p>“President Carter was interested in waging peace everywhere, wherever
there is conflict. He didn’t believe there was the necessary need for
Americans to station so many troops in so many places,” Yawei Liu,
senior adviser on China at the Carter Center, told VOA Korean by phone
on Monday.</p>
<p>Carter died Sunday at his home in Georgia at age 100. The official
state funeral for Carter will be held January 9 in Washington.</p>
<p>South Korea’s foreign ministry expressed condolences at Carter’s
passing.</p>
<p>“He was particularly interested in promoting peace on the Korean
Peninsula and actively worked on it,” it said in a statement released
Monday.</p>

<h2 id="china-targets-us-defense-companies-with-new-sanctions">China
targets US defense companies with new sanctions</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>In the latest escalation of trade tensions between the world’s two
largest economies, China on Thursday announced export control measures
targeting 28 U.S. companies and added 10 U.S. companies to a list of
entities barred from doing business in China.</p>
<p>The larger group of companies is made up primarily of firms active in
defense contracting and includes Lockheed Martin and five of its
subsidiaries; General Dynamics and three of its subsidiaries; three
subsidiaries of Raytheon; one subsidiary of Boeing; and more than a
dozen other companies.</p>
<p>Chinese companies are immediately barred from selling “dual-use”
items — goods that may have a military purpose in addition to civilian
applications — to any of the named companies.</p>
<p>In an announcement, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce said the
sanctions were put in place “in order to safeguard national security …
interests and fulfill international obligations such as
non-proliferation.”</p>
<p>Negligible impact</p>
<p>Experts pointed out that because U.S. defense contractors don’t
typically do business with the country’s major adversaries, the new
restrictions would likely have little impact on the companies named by
China.</p>
<p>“Short answer is, this won’t have much, if any effect, on those
companies: They didn’t do business with China anyway,” Raymond Kuo, a
director and senior political scientist with the RAND Corporation, told
VOA. He said that move would also have no noticeable impact on the
broader U.S. economy.</p>
<p>However, he added, the sanctions do illustrate that China is
determined to respond when the U.S. applies sanctions in the other
direction, as the Biden administration has done several times in recent
months.</p>
<p>“It does show that the Chinese are willing to go kind of tit for tat
with the United States,” Kuo said. “If we increase our levels of trade
sanctions — and [President-elect Donald] Trump has threatened 60%
tariffs across the board — that they can hit back in a whole variety of
ways.”</p>
<p>‘Unreliable’ entities</p>
<p>In a second announcement, the Ministry of Commerce added 10 of the
companies from the first announcement, all subsidiaries of Lockheed
Martin, General Dynamics and Raytheon, to its list of “unreliable
entities,” a designation that entails a much stricter set of
sanctions.</p>
<p>The companies are prohibited from importing or exporting goods to and
from China and from making new investments there. In addition,
executives of the companies are barred from traveling to China, and any
work or residency permits they currently have are revoked.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Commerce said that all of the companies designated as
unreliable have sold arms to Taiwan, the democratically self-governing
island that China claims as its own territory. It said the new
restrictions were meant to “safeguard national sovereignty, security and
development interests.”</p>
<p>The additions to the unreliable entities list come just a week after
Beijing, on December 27, announced an earlier round of sanctions
targeting U.S. firms and their executives for selling arms to Taiwan.
The companies named included subsidiaries of Raytheon and Boeing.</p>
<p>In a statement emailed to VOA, Liu Pengyu, the spokesperson for the
Chinese Embassy in Washington, said it was determined that the 28
companies facing export controls “endanger China’s national
security.”</p>
<p>He also said, “The Chinese government will continue to unswervingly
promote high-level opening up, firmly safeguard the legitimate rights
and interests of various business entities, and promote the development
of compliant trade.”</p>
<p>Follows other sanctions</p>
<p>Thursday’s announcement follows other recent actions by Beijing
cracking down on trade with the U.S., often in response to U.S.
sanctions on Chinese businesses.</p>
<p>In early December, the Biden administration announced a ban on the
sale to Chinese firms of cutting-edge equipment used to make the world’s
most advanced semiconductors as well as high-bandwidth memory products
needed to maximize those chips’ efficiency. At the same time, the U.S.
added 140 Chinese companies to a list of entities that U.S. firms and
individuals are restricted from doing business with.</p>
<p>In response, China imposed new restrictions on the sale of “rare
earth” minerals to the United States. China dominates the world market
for minerals such as gallium, germanium and antimony, which are key
components in various high-tech products from smartphones to missile
guidance systems.</p>
<p>Little more than a month earlier, the Biden administration had
finalized a new set of rules on outbound U.S. investments in China.</p>
<p>The rule codified a set of restrictions barring U.S. individuals and
firms from investing in certain kinds of business ventures in China.
Among the areas affected are the manufacture of advanced semiconductors
and microelectronics, technology used in quantum computing, and
artificial intelligence systems.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
Law enforcement is still
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/02/us/tesla-cybertruck-explosion-las-vegas.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>investigating</u></a>
whether any connection exists between the deadly New Year’s attacks in
Las Vegas and New Orleans, but among the eerie similarities is one
curious factor in common: electric vehicles.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/new-orleans-truck-attack-suspect-01-02-25-hnk/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>In
New Orleans</u></a>, officials say a suspect now identified as
42-year-old veteran Shamsud-Din Jabbar drove into a crowd on Bourbon
Street in a Ford F-150 Lightning, the electric version of the popular
pickup truck, killing at least 14 and injuring many more. He had rented
the truck in Houston using the peer-to-peer app Turo, which allows
anyone to post their own vehicle for someone else to borrow.
</p>
<p>
In
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/02/us/tesla-cybertruck-trump-hotel-wwk-hnk/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Las
Vegas</u></a>, the bed of a Tesla Cybertruck — also rented from Turo —
exploded outside of the Trump Hotel, killing the driver and injuring
seven. The EV truck, which was loaded down with fireworks, gasoline, and
camping fuel, was reportedly driven by an active-duty member of U.S.
Army Special Operations.
</p>
<p>
It could turn out to be a coincidence that both horrendous incidents
were carried out with electric vehicles. For now, though, it’s easy to
wonder whether this was a deliberate choice — if the perpetrators of
what might turn out to be acts of terrorism chose EVs on purpose to
cause maximum damage, especially knowing that both trucks were rented
specifically for these insidious ends.
</p>
<p>
One undeniable fact is that
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/electric-truck-lucid-rivian-cybertruck-tesla" target="_self"><u>EV
pickups</u></a> such as the F-150 Lightning and Cybertruck are big,
heavy, and powerful. The Ford has a curb weight exceeding 6,000 pounds,
with the enormous battery needed to power it making the EV heavier than
the gas-powered version of the best-selling truck. The Tesla also
<a href="https://www.tesla.com/ownersmanual/cybertruck/en_us/GUID-12A976DD-EB60-431B-AFF1-5A37E95006DB.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>tips
the scale</u></a> at more than 3 tons.
</p>
<p>
The ever-growing girth of the American car is already a known
<a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/06/26/1184034017/us-pedestrian-deaths-high-traffic-car" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>public
safety hazard</u></a>. The big trucks and SUVs that dominate our roads
are increasingly dangerous to pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles
given their weight and a driver’s difficulty in monitoring their
surroundings.
</p>
<p>
The electrification movement has complicated this issue even more, since
putting a big battery in a big vehicle makes it even heavier. Plus, EVs
are remarkably powerful. All of their torque is available from a
standstill, as opposed to combustion vehicles, which need time to rev
up. This is what allows EVs to accelerate so quickly from a stop.
</p>
<p>
To put it in stark terms, an electric pickup truck has
<a href="https://www.dailydot.com/news/2023-ford-f150-lightning-ev-turo-rental/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>exactly
the attributes</u></a> that would appeal to someone who wanted to launch
a terrorist attack on a crowd of people.
</p>
<p>
The other much-discussed safety issue for EVs is whether their batteries
are a hazard because of potential fire danger. As
<em><em>InsideEVs</em></em>
<a href="https://insideevs.com/news/736222/ev-myths-fires/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>notes</u></a>,
EV blazes are statistically rarer than those involving ordinary gas
vehicles — they just seem more common because they get more
sensationalized news coverage — however they can also be more difficult
to extinguish because of the energy released when a lithium-ion battery
ignites.
</p>
<p>
This problem seems pertinent in light of the Cybertruck attack in Vegas,
where the driver reportedly loaded down the truck with incendiary
material in the apparent hope of creating an out-of-control blaze. For
what it’s worth, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has
<a href="https://insideevs.com/news/745948/tesla-cybertruck-fire-trump-vegas/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said</u></a>
the blast was caused by the incendiary material loaded into the
Cybertruck and not anything to do with the vehicle itself, and argued
the EV’s stainless steel frame helped contain the explosion.
</p>
<p>
Then there are the increasingly weird politics of EVs. It’s impossible
not to look at a Tesla detonating outside Donald Trump’s casino and see
<em><em>some</em></em> kind of statement about Musk’s support for the
president-elect (and growing influence over the American government).
Where once EVs were the car of choice for the climate-aware, now we have
a big metal electric truck that communicates a right-wing worldview as
it barrels around town.
</p>
<p>
“It’s a Tesla truck, and we know that Elon Musk is working with
President-elect Trump, and it’s the Trump Tower,” Kevin McMahill,
sheriff of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, told reporters.
“So, there’s obviously things to be concerned about there, and that’s
something we continue to look at.”
</p>
<p>
We’ve covered at length some of the things
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/arguments-against-evs-bad" target="_self"><u>EVs
can do that gas cars can’t</u></a>. They can use the energy in their
batteries to back up your home in case of power outage, or air-condition
your dog while you run into the store. But as EVs become more prevalent
around the country, it seems we now have to worry about whether their
downsides will be used in the worst ways imaginable.

id="us-appeals-court-blocks-biden-administration-effort-to-restore-net-neutrality-rules">US
appeals court blocks Biden administration effort to restore net
neutrality rules</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — A U.S. appeals court ruled on Thursday the Federal
Communications Commission did not have legal authority to reinstate
landmark net neutrality rules.</p>
<p>The decision is a blow to the outgoing Biden administration that had
made restoring the open internet rules a priority. President Joe Biden
signed a 2021 executive order encouraging the FCC to reinstate the
rules.</p>
<p>A three-judge panel of the Cincinnati-based 6th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals said the FCC lacked authority to reinstate the rules initially
implemented in 2015 by the agency under Democratic former President
Barack Obama, but then repealed by the commission in 2017 under
Republican former President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Net-neutrality rules require internet service providers to treat
internet data and users equally rather than restricting access, slowing
speeds or blocking content for certain users. The rules also forbid
special arrangements in which ISPs give improved network speeds or
access to favored users.</p>
<p>The court cited the Supreme Court’s June decision in a case known as
Loper Bright to overturn a 1984 precedent that had given deference to
government agencies in interpreting laws they administer, in the latest
decision to curb the authority of federal agencies. “Applying Loper
Bright means we can end the FCC’s vacillations,” the court ruled.</p>
<p>The decision leaves in place state neutrality rules adopted by
California and others but may end more than 20 years of efforts to give
federal regulators sweeping oversight over the internet.</p>
<p>FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel called on Congress to act after the
decision. “Consumers across the country have told us again and again
that they want an internet that is fast, open, and fair. With this
decision it is clear that Congress now needs to heed their call, take up
the charge for net neutrality, and put open internet principles in
federal law,” Rosenworcel said in a statement.</p>
<p>The FCC voted in April along party lines to reassume regulatory
oversight of broadband internet and reinstate open internet rules.
Industry groups filed suit and successfully convinced the court to
temporarily block the rules as they considered the case.</p>
<p>Incoming FCC Chair Brendan Carr voted against the reinstatement last
year. He did not immediately comment on Thursday.</p>
<p>Former FCC Chair Ajit Pai said the court ruling should mean the end
of efforts to reinstate the rules, and a focus shift to “what actually
matters to American consumers - like improving Internet access and
promoting online innovation.”</p>
<p>The Trump administration is unlikely to appeal the decision but
net-neutrality advocates could seek review by the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>The rules would have given the FCC new tools to crack down on Chinese
telecom companies and the ability to monitor internet service
outages.</p>
<p>A group representing companies including Amazon.com AMZN.O, Apple
AAPL.O, Alphabet GOOGL.O and Meta Platforms META.O had backed the FCC
net-neutrality rules, while USTelecom, an industry group whose members
include AT&amp;T T.N and Verizon VZ.N, last year called reinstating net
neutrality “entirely counterproductive, unnecessary, and an
anti-consumer regulatory distraction.”</p>

id="soldier-shot-himself-before-cybertruck-exploded-outside-trump-las-vegas-hotel-officials-say">Soldier
shot himself before Cybertruck exploded outside Trump Las Vegas hotel,
officials say</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LAS VEGAS, NEVADA — The highly decorated Army soldier inside a Tesla
Cybertruck packed with fireworks that exploded outside Trump
International Hotel in Las Vegas shot himself in the head just before
detonation, authorities said Thursday. </p>
<p>The explosion caused minor injuries to seven people but virtually no
damage to the hotel.  </p>
<p>Clark County Sheriff Kevin McMahill said Matthew Livelsberger, a
37-year-old Green Beret, likely planned a more damaging attack but the
steel-sided vehicle absorbed much of the force from the crudely built
explosive. </p>
<p>Damage from the blast was mostly limited to the interior of the
truck. The explosion “vented out and up” and didn’t hit the Trump hotel
doors just a few feet away, the sheriff said.</p>
<p>“The level of sophistication is not what we would expect from an
individual with this type of military experience,” said Kenny Cooper, a
special agent in charge for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and
Explosives.</p>
<p>Authorities were still working to determine a motive. </p>
<p>“It’s not lost on us that it’s in front of the Trump building, that
it’s a Tesla vehicle, but we don’t have information at this point that
definitively tells us or suggests it was because of this particular
ideology,” said Spencer Evans, the Las Vegas FBI’s special agent in
charge. </p>
<p>Livelsberger had recently returned from an overseas assignment in
Germany and was on approved leave when he died, according to a U.S.
official. </p>
<p>A law enforcement official said investigators learned through
interviews that he might have gotten into a fight with his wife about
relationship issues shortly before he rented the Tesla and bought the
guns. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because of a lack
of authorization to discuss the investigation. </p>
<p>Among other charred items found inside the truck were a second
firearm, a number of fireworks, a passport, a military ID, credit cards,
an iPhone and a smartwatch, McMahill said. Authorities said both guns
were purchased legally.</p>
<p>The body of Livelsberger, of Colorado Springs, was burned beyond
recognition, but investigators identified him Thursday. The cause of
death was suicide by gunshot, according to the Clark County
coroner. </p>
<p>Livelsberger served in the Green Berets, highly trained special
forces who work to counter terrorism abroad and train partners. He had
served in the Army since 2006, rising through the ranks with a long
career of overseas assignments, deploying twice to Afghanistan and
serving in Ukraine, Tajikistan, Georgia and Congo, the Army said.</p>
<p>He was awarded five Bronze Stars, including one with valor for
courage under fire, a combat infantry badge and an Army Commendation
Medal with valor.</p>
<p>McMahill said Livelsberger rented the Tesla electric vehicle in
Denver on Saturday, and the sheriff displayed a map showing that it was
charged in the Colorado town of Monument near Colorado Springs on
Monday. On New Year’s Eve, it was charged in Trinidad, Colorado, and
three towns in New Mexico along the Interstate 40 corridor.</p>
<p>Then on Wednesday, the day of the explosion, it was charged in three
Arizona towns before video showed it on the Las Vegas Strip about 7:30
a.m.</p>
<p>McMahill said investigators obtained charging station photos showing
Livelsberger “was the individual that was driving this vehicle” and was
alone.</p>
<p>“We’re not aware of any other subjects involved in this particular
case,” the sheriff said.</p>
<p>Authorities searched a townhouse in Colorado Springs on Thursday as
part of the investigation. Neighbors said the man who lived there had a
wife and a baby and did not give any sign of posing a danger to
anyone.</p>
<p>The explosion of the truck, packed with firework mortars and camp
fuel canisters, came hours after Shamsud-Din Jabbar, 42, rammed a truck
into a crowd in New Orleans’ French Quarter early on New Year’s Day,
killing at least 14 people before being shot to death by police. That
crash was being investigated as a terrorist attack.</p>
<p>The FBI said Thursday that they thought Jabbar acted alone, reversing
its position from a day earlier that he likely worked with others.</p>
<p>Both Livelsberger and Jabbar spent time at the base formerly known as
Fort Bragg, a massive Army base in North Carolina that is home to
multiple Army special operations units. However, one of the officials
who spoke to the AP said there was no overlap in their assignments at
the base, now called Fort Liberty.</p>
<p>Chris Raia, FBI deputy assistant director, said Thursday that
officials have found no definitive link between the New Orleans attack
and the truck explosion in Las Vegas.</p>

Tesla reported today that it had
<a href="https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-fourth-quarter-2024-production-deliveries-and-deployments" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>delivered
495,570 cars</u></a> in the last three months of the year, and 1,789,226
in 2024 as a whole. That represents a decline in annual sales from 2023
— Tesla’s first annual decline in more than 10 years, back when the
company’s deliveries were counted in the hundreds or single-digit
thousands — although the fourth quarter figure is a record for quarterly
deliveries.
</p>
<p>
Analysts polled by Bloomberg
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-31/tesla-stock-surge-runs-up-against-a-potential-annual-sales-drop" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>expected
510,400 deliveries</u></a> for the fourth quarter, while Tesla had
<a href="https://digitalassets.tesla.com/tesla-contents/image/upload/IR/TSLA-Q3-2024-Update.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>forecast
around 515,000 deliveries</u></a> to meet its “slight growth” goals. The
company had cited “sustained macroeconomic headwinds” weighing on the
broader electric vehicle market in its most recent investor letter, and
again referred to “ongoing macroeconomic conditions” to explain the miss
on deliveries. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Tesla deliveries stood at
484,507, with 1,808,581 for the year as a whole.
</p>
<p>
Going forward, Tesla buyers in the United States are likely to lose out
on up to $7,500 in federal subsidies as the incoming Trump
administration puts its stamp on energy and environmental policy.
Tesla’s chief executive, Elon Musk, has
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/musk-trump-tesla-tax-credits" target="_self"><u>supported
ditching EV credits</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
The below-expectations deliveries dragged on the stock, which traded
down more than 4.5% in early trading Thursday. Tesla shares have
otherwise been on a tear, rising around 75% in the last six months
before today, with especially torrid performance following the 2024
United States presidential election.
</p>
<p>
The Chinese car company BYD is in a virtual tie with Tesla for annual
battery electric vehicle sales,
<a href="https://www.bydglobal.com/sitesresources/common/tools/generic/web/viewer.html?file=%2Fsites%2FSatellite%2FBYD%20PDF%20Viewer%3Fblobcol%3Durldata%26blobheader%3Dapplication%252Fpdf%26blobkey%3Did%26blobtable%3DMungoBlobs%26blobwhere%3D1638928484684%26ssbinary%3Dtrue" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>with
1,764,992</u></a> delivered in 2024, the company announced Wednesday.
While Tesla’s 2024 sales confirm that the U.S. company maintains a
narrow lead over BYD, the Chinese automaker’s sales are growing at a
rapid clip — electric sales increased by over 12% for the year, compared
to the slight fall in Tesla sales from 2023 to 2024.
</p>
<p>
While Tesla’s car business appears to have stalled to some extent —
though it was buoyed by the release of a new model, the Cybertruck,
which is already
<a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-cybertruck-us-3rd-best-selling-ev-q3-2024-model-3-model-y/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
third best-selling electric vehicle in the United States</u></a> — the
company’s energy storage business is another story. The company said
that in the fourth quarter of last year it had deployed 11
gigawatt-hours of storage, and 31.4 gigawatt-hours in the year as a
whole. If Tesla’s deployment rate in 2025 merely matched its fourth
quarter rate, it would mean 40% annual growth.

whether yesterday’s deadly truck attacks in New Orleans and Las Vegas
may be linked. Both incidents involved electric pickups. In New Orleans,
a man drove a Ford F-150 Lightning into a crowd in the French Quarter,
killing 15 people and injuring dozens of others. In Vegas, a Tesla
Cybertruck packed with explosives detonated outside the Trump
International Hotel, killing the driver and injuring seven others. Both
vehicles were rented through a budget app called Turo. Electric vehicles
tend to be heavier than their internal combustion counterparts, mostly
due to their battery packs. This can make them particularly deadly in
collisions with smaller vehicles and, of course, pedestrians. Ford’s

Heatmap</a> the rules would be out by the end of 2024. As Heatmap’s
Robinson Meyer explained, the Treasury Department’s must decide how
hydrogen producers who use electrolysis — sending electricity through
water to split its molecules — should deal with the indirect carbon
emissions associated with drawing power from the grid. “Finalizing rules
that will help scale the clean hydrogen industry while implementing the
environmental safeguards established in the law remains a top priority
for Treasury,” spokesperson Michael Martinez told
<em><em>Reuters</em></em>. “In that process, we are carefully
considering the numerous comments we have received on the proposed
regulations.” In his conversation with Heatmap, Adeyemo acknowledged
that the final rules were unlikely to please everyone.

Climate change meant that there were about 41 more “extreme heat” days

to</a> the World Weather Attribution’s annual extreme weather report.
Climate change contributed to at least 3,700 deaths, but “it’s likely
the total number of people killed in extreme weather events intensified
by climate change [in 2024] is in the tens, or hundreds of thousands,”
the group said. While the El Niño weather pattern contributed to global
trends, climate change played a bigger role in fueling extreme weather.
“As the planet warms, the influence of climate change increasingly
overrides other natural phenomena affecting the weather,” the report
added.

honoring 20 Americans with Presidential Citizens Medal</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden awarded the nation’s second-highest civilian
honor to 20 people at a White House ceremony Thursday evening.</p>
<p>“For the final time as president, I have the privilege of bestowing
the Presidential Citizens Medal, one of our nation’s highest honors, on
an extraordinary — and I mean an extraordinary — group of Americans,”
Biden said in his remarks at the ceremony.</p>
<p>“Together, you embody — and I mean this from the bottom of my heart —
an essential truth: We’re a great nation. We’re a great nation because
we’re good people,” Biden later added.</p>
<p>The medal recipients include Representative Bennie Thompson and
former Representative Elizabeth Cheney, who led a congressional
investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob
seeking to disrupt the certification of Biden’s 2020 election win over
Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Trump, who won the 2024 election for a new term starting later this
month, has said Thompson and Cheney should be jailed.</p>
<p>Applause appeared to be particularly lengthy and loud for Cheney, who
was recognized “for putting the American people over party.”</p>
<p>A White House statement about Thursday’s honorees said Cheney, a
Republican, “raised her voice — and reached across the aisle — to defend
our Nation and the ideals we stand for: Freedom. Dignity. And
decency.”</p>
<p>The statement said Thompson was “at the forefront of defending the
rule of law with unwavering integrity and a steadfast commitment to
truth.”</p>
<p>Created in 1969, the Presidential Citizens Medal honors citizens “who
have performed exemplary deeds of service for their country or their
fellow citizens.”</p>
<p>“President Biden believes these Americans are bonded by their common
decency and commitment to serving others,” the White House said. “The
country is better because of their dedication and sacrifice.”</p>
<p>“Over 50 years, presidents of both parties have awarded this medal to
Americans who’ve met that high calling,” Biden said at the ceremony.</p>
<p>Also honored Thursday were Mary Bonauto and Evan Wolfson, who worked
to legalize same-sex marriage in the United States.</p>
<p>Frank Butler is another medal recipient, with the White House
highlighting his effort to set standards for the use of tourniquets and
saying he “transformed battlefield trauma care for the United States
military and saved countless lives.”</p>
<p>Mitsuye Endo Tsutsumi was posthumously honored for her successful
legal challenge against the imprisonment of Japanese Americans during
World War II.</p>
<p>Others who were honored posthumously include war correspondent Joseph
Galloway, civil rights advocate Louis Redding and judge Collins
Seitz.</p>
<p>Biden honored Eleanor Smeal for her work in leading women’s rights
protests and fighting for equal pay for women.</p>
<p>Medals were also awarded to a former Representative Carolyn McCarthy
and a group of former U.S. senators: Bill Bradley, Chris Dodd, Nancy
Kassebaum and Ted Kaufman.</p>
<p>Other honorees include Diane Carlson Evans, founder of the Vietnam
Women’s Memorial Foundation, and photographer Bobby Sager.</p>
<p>Fulbright University Vietnam founder Thomas Vallely, breast cancer
research advocate Frances Visco and Savannah College of Art and Design
founder Paula Wallace also received the medal.</p>
<p>In his remarks, Biden also paid respect to former President Jimmy
Carter, who died earlier this week at the age of 100.</p>
<p>“May we all strive to measure up to his highest standard of active
citizenship,” Biden said.</p>
<p>VOA reporter Liam Scott contributed to this report. Some information

of Energy Nominee Chris Wright</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-02, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTM4MzExOS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0NzM2MDk4N30.zEy-gw2UO2BBMb2EDp7jPzt_gC33NmYGmWSVo_3oE18/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Donald Trump’s nominee for Secretary of Energy, Chris Wright, is a nerd
— and he’ll tell you about it. “I’m Chris Wright, and my short bio is, I
started out as a science geek, I transitioned to a tech nerd, and then
I’ve been an energy entrepreneur my whole life,” he
<a href="https://robertbryce.com/episode/chris-wright-ceo-and-chairman-of-liberty-energy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>told
energy journalist Robert Bryce</u></a> on the <em>Power Hungry
</em>podcast in 2020. “In addition to an energy nerd, I’ve been a
climate nerd for quite some time,” he said in a
<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/there-is-a-design-problem-in-climate-policy/id1605818635?i=1000629625806" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>talk
hosted by Veriten</u></a>, the energy consulting firm in 2023.
</p>
<p>
This is a far cry from Trump’s first Energy Secretary, the former Texas
Governor Rick Perry, who famously failed to remember on the Republican
primary debate stage the third of the three agencies he sought to
eliminate (it was the Department of Energy) and who reportedly didn’t
know that the Energy Department’s responsibilities — and budget — then
lay heavily with maintaining the country’s nuclear stockpile.
</p>
<p>
But Wright’s extensive energy experience — studying nuclear fusion at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and working early in his
career on solar and geothermal engineering (his company, Liberty Energy,
the fracking powerhouse he founded in 2011, has invested in the
next-generation geothermal company Fervo, and Wright sits on the board
of the nuclear company Oklo) — has not won him any plaudits from
environmental groups or Democrats who focus on climate change. After
Trump announced his nomination, the Sierra Club
<a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/press-releases/2024/11/sierra-club-statement-nomination-oil-and-fracked-gas-ceo-chris-wright-energy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>called
Wright</u></a> a “climate denier who has profited off of polluting our
communities and endangering our health and future.” Illinois Rep. Sean
Casten, one of the House’s most vocal proponents of climate action,
<a href="https://x.com/RepCasten/status/1857938576014442989" target="_blank"><u>also
called Wright</u></a> a “climate denier who prioritizes the wants of
energy producers over the needs of American consumers.”
</p>
<p>
Few Republicans — and certainly few high-level Trump appointees — are as
conversant in climate and energy data as Wright. That may make him an
even more effective advocate for Trump’s “energy dominance” strategy,
built around increased production of fossil fuels and, almost certainly,
fewer subsidies for clean energy and electrification.
</p>
<p>
Typically when a person gains some notoriety by coming out against
immediate, large-scale climate action and restrictions on fossil fuel
extraction, climate advocates try to link that person to the fossil fuel
industry and its long history of deliberate and knowing climate denial.
Wright’s associations, however, are perfectly straightforward: Liberty
Energy fracks oil and gas in the United States and Canada on behalf of
large oil companies. He thinks the company’s contribution to the good of
the world consists of its producing more hydrocarbons — full stop.
</p>
<p>
Wright calls this philosophy
“<a href="https://x.com/ChrisAWright_/status/1828816296471044317" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>energy
sobriety</u></a>,” fully conceding that climate change is real while
also diminishing the urgency of mounting a response. In seemingly
countless speeches, interviews, and legislative testimonies, as well as
in Liberty Energy’s annual “Bettering Human Lives” report — its version
of an environmental, social, and governance review — Wright is perfectly
comfortable acknowledging climate change while also patiently assaulting
many key pillars of climate policy as it’s practiced in the United
States, Europe, and other countries in the developed world seeking to
sharply reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
</p>
<p>
While Wright’s written and spoken record adds up to tens of thousands of
words and hours of talks, it can be distilled into a few core ideas:
Energy consumption makes people better off; energy access, especially in
the developing world, is a greater global challenge than climate change;
and existing alternatives to hydrocarbons are not capable of replacing
the status quo energy system, which still overwhelmingly relies on
fossil fuels, with little prospect of a rapid transition.
</p>
<p>
He cites a wide range of thinkers, including members of a group of
scholars — including the Danish political scientist Bjorn Lomborg (whose
book, <em><em>False Alarm</em></em>, is “fantastic,” Wright said in a
Liberty talk), University of Colorado science policy scholar Roger
Pielke, Jr. (“a real intellectual”), and the Canadian energy scholar and
historian Vaclav Smil (“the greatest energy scholar of my lifetime by
far”) — who share elements of this deflationary view of climate change.
</p>
<p>
Lomborg and Pielke have long been bêtes noires of the climate movement,
mostly as the subjects of years of furious back and forth in every form
of media for the past two-plus decades. (Though in Pielke’s case,
<a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/targeted-crusading-congressman-scientist-speaks-out-conflicts-climate-and-controversy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">there
was also <u>an investigation in 2015</u></a> over alleged conflicts of
interest led by House Democrat Raul Grijalva, who is retiring from
Congress this year.) Lomborg has for decades argued that climate change
ranks relatively low on global challenges
<a href="https://copenhagenconsensus.com/copenhagen-consensus-iii/how-spend-75-billion-make-world-better-place" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>compared
to, say, global public health</u></a>, while Pielke contends that many
climate change policy advocates
<a href="https://rogerpielkejr.substack.com/p/climate-fueled-extreme-weather" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>overstate
what the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</u></a> actually says
about the connection between climate change and extreme weather, a point
that has made him the
<a href="https://grist.org/article/deniers-like-pielke-keep-shouting-down-any-talk-of-a-climate-change-extreme/" target="_blank"><u>object
of intense criticism</u></a> for going on 15 years.
</p>
<p>
Smil, meanwhile, is deeply skeptical of any effort to wean the world
from fossil fuels considering their role in the production of steel,
cement, plastics, and fertilizers — the materials that he describes as
<a href="https://time.com/6175734/reliance-on-fossil-fuels/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>essential
to the modern world</u></a>. Smil also counts among his fans Bill Gates
(“<a href="https://www.instagram.com/thisisbillgates/p/CSKZT8upamb/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Vaclav
Smil is my favorite author</u></a>”), who is also one of the biggest
funders and promoters of climate action through his research and
investment group Breakthrough Energy and funding for companies like
TerraPower, which is currently building the country’s first
next-generation nuclear facility in Wyoming.
</p>
<p>
Pielke called both Wright and Doug Burgum, Trump’s nominee for Secretary
of the Interior and the designated head of a planned National Energy
Council “super competent. They know energy, and that’s a fantastic
starting point,” he told me.
</p>
<p>
“There is polarization of the climate debate, and the idea that fossil
fuels are evil and the fossil industry are arch-villains — that’s part
of the framing from the progressive left about how climate wars are to
be fought,” Pielke said. “I’m not particularly wedded to that sort of
Manichean evil vs. good framing of the debate.”
</p>
<p>
But the differences are real. Wright strongly contests much of what is
the mainstream of climate policy. While he acknowledges that increased
concentrations of carbon dioxide cause higher temperature, he says it’s
“actually sort of slow-moving in our lifetimes” and a “relatively modest
phenomenon that’s just been wildly abused for political reasons,”
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmICJPvUx44&ab_channel=AmericanLegislativeExchangeCouncil%28ALEC%29" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>he
said in a talk</u></a> to the conservative policy group American
Legislative Exchange Council.
</p>
<p>
While the Department of Energy has only limited authority over energy
policy, <em><em>per se</em></em>, especially the permitting and public
lands issues that typically concern fossil fuel companies, Wright does
have some levers he can pull. He will likely act quickly to approve more
export facilities for liquified natural gas, though the Energy
Department’s recently released
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/lng-study" target="_self"><u>study
of LNG’s long-term effects</u></a> — particularly on domestic energy
prices — may complicate that somewhat. Beyond that, he will inherit a
massive energy research portfolio through the national labs, putting him
in charge of developing the energy technology that he says are currently
insufficient to replace oil and gas.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve worked on alternatives. I’d love it if fusion energy arrives,”
Wright
<a href="https://www.powerlineblog.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said
in an interview</u></a> with the conservative website Power Line. “I
love energy technology, and I think there’s good things going on, but
it’s now become political.”
</p>
<p>
He believes that reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 is
“neither achievable nor humane,” he wrote in the foreword to the 2024
edition of “Bettering Human Lives.” He also disagrees with the idea of
subsidizing the world’s predominant forms of alternative energy, solar
and wind.
</p>
<p>
“Wind and solar are never going to be dominant sources of energy in the
world,” Wright told Bryce on the 2020 podcast. The “main impact” of
subsidies for wind and solar, Wright said in
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOAYH3p9f0s&t=13s&pp=ygUeY2hyaXMgd3JpZ2h0IHBvd2VyIGh1bmdyeSAyMDIz" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>another
2023 podcast episode</u></a> with Bryce, “is just to make our
electricity grids less reliable and electricity prices more expensive,
and to do nothing for the demand for oil and very little for the demand
for natural gas.”
</p>
<p>
“Oil and gas make the world go round,” he added. “[People] want higher
quality of lives. That’s what drives the demand for oil and gas.”
</p>
<p>
Bryce, a persistent critic of green energy policies, told me in an email
that he thinks Wright is “the right person for the DOE. He’s not
apologetic about being an energy humanist. Regardless of what anyone
thinks about climate change, it is obvious that we are going to need a
lot more energy in the future, and the majority of that new supply will
come from hydrocarbons.”
</p>
<p>
While Wright’s arguments certainly have wide purchase among his peers in
the energy industry executive corps, he nevertheless stands out from the
rest for his willingness to express them. In contrast to the stance
taken by large, multinational energy companies, which are willing at
least to pay lip service to carbon reduction goals and have, at times,
embraced branding and marketing strategies to make them seem like
something other than oil and gas companies (e.g. ExxonMobil’s
algae-based fuel initiative and BP’s notorious “Beyond Petroleum”
campaign), Wright and his company see their contribution to a better
world as their work extracting oil and gas.
</p>
<p>
Other executives “don’t want to deal with the criticism that will come
with taking a higher-profile stance,” Bryce told me. “They don’t have
time or the inclination. It takes a lot of time, courage, and conviction
to engage with the media, get on the speaking circuit, and do so in a
thoughtful way.”
</p>
<p>
Wright’s emphasis on the energy poverty faced by poor countries could
potentially serve as a diplomatic bridge to the developing world,
especially in Africa, where some observers think there’s space for the
United States to
<a href="https://www.africanistperspective.com/p/what-sorts-of-reforms-under-trump?r=1xc3o9&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>start
funding natural gas development</u></a> through the International
Development Finance Corporation. For Wright, expanding energy production
— and specifically fossil fuel development — is crucial to providing
cheap energy to the developing world. He mentions in almost every talk
the
<a href="https://press.un.org/en/2024/sgsm22225.doc.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>billions</u></a>
of people who use wood, dung, or other biofuels on open fires to cook
indoors,
<a href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/cooking-smoke-kills-millions-every-year-heres-what-world-can-do-about" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>causing
3 million premature deaths</u></a> per year.
</p>
<p>
“The biggest problem today is a third of humanity doesn’t have
hydrocarbons,” Wright told Bryce in 2023. In a 2023 speech to the
American Conservation Coalition, a conservative environmental group, he
described strictures against financing fossil fuel development as “not
just ignorant or bad policy” but “immoral.” His solution: distributing
propane stoves as widely as possible, in part
<a href="https://www.betteringhumanlives.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>through
his Bettering Human Lives Foundation</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Here might be the greatest challenge for advocates of climate action:
Even if most of the world’s leaders have accepted the reality of
anthropogenic climate change, much of the world, especially outside
North America and Europe, is still eagerly increasing its use of fossil
fuels. In the United States, coal plant shutdowns are being pushed out
further and natural gas investment may soon pick up again to power new
demand for electricity. Globally, coal use is
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-12-18/we-re-burning-more-coal-than-ever-thanks-to-china" target="_blank"><u>set
to grow over the next few years</u></a>. That’s thanks in large part to
demand from China,
<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/total-ghg-emissions?tab=chart&country=OWID_WRL~CHN~USA~OWID_EU27" target="_blank"><u>the
world’s largest emitter</u></a> and
<a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-chinas-emissions-have-now-caused-more-global-warming-than-eu/" target="_blank"><u>second-largest
cumulative emitter</u></a> behind the United States, defying predictions
that demand there was near peaking. The biggest new
<a href="https://x.com/gbrew24/status/1869748918009188772" target="_blank"><u>source
of oil demand is India</u></a>, a country with a per-capita gross
domestic product less than 1/30th of the United States.
</p>
<p>
And so the greatest danger to aggressive action to lower global
emissions may not be Chris Wright and his “sober” ideas at the helm of
the Department of Energy. It may be that much of the world agrees with
him.

<h2 id="fbi-says-new-orleans-terror-attack-suspect-acted-alone">FBI says
New Orleans terror attack suspect acted alone</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The FBI says it believes the suspect in the New Year’s Day truck
ramming attack in New Orleans that killed at least 14 people had acted
alone and was inspired by the Islamic State terror group.</p>
<p>Officials had previously said they were looking into the possibility
that the suspect had coordinated with others.</p>
<p>FBI officials briefed reporters Thursday on the latest in the probe
into the “act of terrorism” in which the suspect, 42-year-old
Shamsud-Din Jabbar, crashed a pickup truck into a crowd and opened fire
in the city’s popular Bourbon Street.</p>
<p>Based on hundreds of interviews and reviews of the attacker’s calls,
social media accounts and electronic devices, “We’re confident, at this
point, that there are no accomplices,” Christopher Raia of the FBI’s
counterterrorism division said Thursday in a news conference.</p>
<p>Jabbar, a U.S. citizen from Texas, was killed in a shootout with
police. He served in the U.S. Army and later served in the Army Reserve
until a few years ago.</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden said the attack would not defeat New
Orleans.</p>
<p>“New Orleans is a city of tremendous spirit. You can’t keep it down,”
Biden said in remarks Thursday afternoon. “People of New Orleans are
sending an unmistakable message. They will not let this attack or the
attacker’s deluded ideology overcome us.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Officials reopened Bourbon Street on Thursday afternoon. The attack
occurred on Wednesday at 3:15 a.m.</p>
<p>On Tuesday evening, just hours before committing the attack, Jabbar
posted five videos to his Facebook account, apparently addressed to his
family and recorded while he was driving, in which he aligned himself
with the Islamic State terror group. The FBI said an IS flag was also
found in the vehicle after the attack.</p>
<p>“This was an act of terrorism. It was premeditated and an evil act,”
Raia said.</p>
<p>Jabbar had originally planned to hurt his relatives and friends, but
worried about how that would be interpreted by the media, Raia said.</p>
<p>“He was 100 percent inspired by ISIS,” he said.</p>
<p>Biden said the United States would continue to target the Islamic
State.</p>
<p>“We’re going to relentlessly pursue ISIS and other terrorist
organizations where they are, and they’ll find no safe harbor here,”
Biden said in his Thursday afternoon remarks.</p>
<p>Early morning attack</p>
<p>The attack occurred at the intersection of Canal and Bourbon streets
in the city’s lively French Quarter. The historic tourist destination
filled with bars and music is also known for its large New Year’s Eve
celebrations.</p>
<p>After the vehicle crashed, the driver got out of the car and opened
fire on responding officers, police said. Officers returned fire,
killing the suspect, according to police. Two officers were wounded but
are in stable condition, police said.</p>
<p>“This is not just an act of terrorism. This is evil,” New Orleans
Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick told reporters at a press
conference earlier Wednesday.</p>
<p>President-elect Donald Trump condemned the attack in a post on his
social media platform Truth Social.</p>
<p>“Our hearts are with all the innocent victims and their loved ones.
The Trump Administration will fully support the City of New Orleans as
they investigate and recover from this act of pure evil!” he said.</p>
<p>In the same post, Trump also falsely suggested that the suspect was
an immigrant.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Video taken by an onlooker at the scene of the attack shows at least
two twisted bodies lying in the street, with one of them in what appears
to be a pool of blood. A bystander is seen kneeling over one of the
bodies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“For those people who don’t believe in objective evil, all you have
to do is look at what happened in our city early this morning,” U.S.
Senator John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, said. “If this doesn’t
trigger the gag reflex of every American, every fair-minded American,
I’ll be very surprised.”</p>
<p>Investigators say they have found no link between the New Orleans
attack and the explosion of a Tesla Cybertruck outside a Trump hotel in
Las Vegas on Wednesday, Raia said. But he cautioned that investigators
have not ruled out anything.</p>
<p>In that incident, the man who was driving the car shot himself in the
head immediately before the vehicle was engulfed by fire, the
authorities said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Speaking Thursday afternoon, Biden said investigators were continuing
to look into whether there was any connection between the New Orleans
attack and Las Vegas explosion.</p>
<p>“As of now, I’ve just been briefed, they have not found any evidence
of such a connection,” Biden said, adding that he directed his team to
accelerate investigations into both incidents.</p>
<p>“I’ll continue to provide updates on New Orleans and Las Vegas as the
facts develop,” Biden said.</p>

Scott contributed to this report. Some information in this report came

id="islamic-state-group-inspired-new-orleans-attack-revives-familiar-fears">Islamic
State group-inspired New Orleans attack revives familiar fears</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Even before the shock from the deadly New Year’s Day
terror attack in New Orleans could subside, early indications from the
investigation pointed to a scenario U.S. law enforcement and security
officials have long feared – a plot at least inspired by the Islamic
State terror group.</p>
<p>The FBI Wednesday confirmed reports the suspect had planted an IS
flag in the pickup truck he used to plow into a crowd on Bourbon Street
in the early hours of Wednesday morning before he was killed during a
shootout with police.</p>
<p>Late Wednesday, U.S. President Joe Biden said the FBI found the
suspect had taken other actions “mere hours before the attack” to make
his loyalty known.</p>
<p>Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a 42-year-old U.S. citizen and former Army
reservist, had “posted videos on social media indicating that it was
inspired by ISIS,” Biden said, using another name for the terror
group.</p>
<p>“The situation is very fluid,” Biden added. “The law enforcement and
intelligence community are continuing to look for any connections,
associations or co-conspirators,” he said.</p>
<p>However, that investigation included the execution of search warrants
at various locations in New Orleans and other states, an operation by
the FBI and other law enforcement officials at a traffic intersection in
Houston and questions as to whether there could be any connection to an
attempt to blow up a Tesla Cybertruck in front of the Trump Hotel in Las
Vegas.</p>
<p>Regardless of additional conspirators or connections, details of the
New Orleans attack itself correspond with tactics long espoused by IS
propagandists.</p>
<p>“What we saw fits in with the common pattern we’ve seen from the
Islamic State for a while,” said Aaron Zelin, a fellow at the Washington
Institute for Near East Policy, who specializes in jihadism. “They’ve
been calling for car ramming attacks for years.”</p>
<p>“Every day they put out pushes for supporters, prospective recruits,
anyone to do something on their behalf,” Zelin told VOA.</p>
<p>One of the first IS-linked attacks using a vehicle as a weapon took
place in Nice, France, in 2016. A 31-year-old Tunisian-born Frenchman
who was divorced and suffered from depression plowed into a Bastille Day
celebration, killing more than 80 people.</p>
<p>Months later, a 24-year-old Tunisian man used a truck to drive into
crowds at a Christmas market in Berlin, killing 13 people. He, too,
posted a video pledging allegiance to IS before carrying out the
attack.</p>
<p>IS additionally claimed a November 2017 truck ramming attack in New
York that killed at least eight people, in which police officials said
the attacker followed IS instructions on vehicle attacks “almost exactly
to a T.”</p>
<p>Even as the IS terror group retreated from counterterrorism pressure
in places like Syria and Afghanistan, its leaders never abandoned the
quest to inspire attacks around the world.</p>
<p>“In Afghanistan … ISIS-Khorasan, continues to harbor intent to
conduct external operations and maintains English‑language media
releases that aim to globalize the group’s local grievances among
Western audiences,” U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas
warned in written congressional testimony in October 2023.</p>
<p>Even the most recent Homeland Security threat assessment, issued in
September, cautioned that IS, with other terror groups such as al-Qaida,
“maintain the enduring intent to conduct or inspire attacks in the
Homeland,” rating the threat level as “high.”</p>
<p>The September assessment further warned that IS online media groups
also sought to capitalize on the Israel-Hamas conflict in the Middle
East “to inspire more violent action.”</p>
<p>FBI Director Christopher Wray has also said repeatedly that the
bureau’s domestic terrorism caseload remains high, with about 1,000
IS-related investigations each year spanning all 50 U.S. states.</p>
<p>According to data compiled by Seamus Hughes, a senior researcher
faculty member at the National Counterterrorism Innovation, Technology
and Education Center, or NCITE, more than 250 individuals have been
charged with IS-related activities since 2014.</p>
<p>Most of those cases, according to Hughes, have resulted in guilty
pleas or convictions; Justice Department prosecutors have only lost one
case that went to trial.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the FBI has had success in disrupting IS-linked or
inspired terror plots.</p>
<p>In October, for example, agents arrested a 27-year-old Afghan
national in Oklahoma City, charging him and a juvenile co-conspirator
with attempting to carry out a mass shooting on Election Day.</p>
<p>IS has so far yet to claim the New Orleans terror attack as its own,
but the Washington Institute’s Aaron Zelin said the attack is already
generating excitement among IS supporters on social media.</p>
<p>Some U.S. counterterrorism officials worry that excitement will play
to the terror group’s advantage.</p>
<p>“From their view, it’s less important that an attack kills large
numbers of people than it simply garners a lot of media attention,”
Brett Holmgren, the acting director of the U.S. National
Counterterrorism Center told a Washington audience in November.</p>
<p>Some counterterrorism officials and experts, however, say they worry
the attacks could become deadlier.</p>
<p>The NCTC has warned IS has been benefiting from improved finances and
even set up an external planning unit in Syria, with a focus on carrying
out attacks against the U.S.</p>
<p>“All of last year that there was an uptick in the tempo of Islamic
State plots and attacks,” Zelin told VOA. “We saw five attack plots in
the United States last year, whereas in 2023 there were none.”</p>
<p>That activity may not be limited to America, with some analysts
pointing to deadly IS attacks last year in Kerman, Iran, and Moscow.
[[</p>
<p>“It falls in line to a broader trend that we’ve seen in the U.S., but
also in other parts of the world where, you know, we saw more plots and
attacks in Europe, Russia, Turkey, Iran, Central Asia,” Zelin said.</p>

nurse, football star, father among dead in New Orleans attack</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA — An 18-year-old girl dreaming of becoming a
nurse, a father of two and a former Princeton football star suffered
fatal injuries when the driver of a white pickup truck sped down Bourbon
Street, packed with holiday revelers early Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>Officials have not yet released the names of the 15 people killed in
the New Orleans New Year’s Day truck attack, but their families and
friends have started sharing their stories. New Orleans Coroner
Dr. Dwight McKenna said in a statement late Wednesday that the names of
the dead would be released once autopsies were complete and next of kin
were informed. About 30 people were injured.</p>
<p>Nikyra Dedeaux</p>
<p>Zion Parsons of Gulfport, Mississippi, had been celebrating New
Year’s Eve during his first night on Bourbon Street when a vehicle
appeared and plowed into his friend, 18-year-old Nikyra Dedeaux, who he
said had dreamed of becoming a nurse.</p>
<p>“A truck hit the corner and comes barreling through, throwing people
like in a movie scene, throwing people into the air,” Parsons, 18, told
The Associated Press. “It hit her and flung her like at least 30 feet,
and I was just lucky to be alive.”</p>
<p>As the crowd scattered in the chaos, he ran through a gruesome
aftermath of bleeding and maimed victims, hearing gunshots and explosive
sounds.</p>
<p>“Bodies, bodies all up and down the street, everybody screaming and
hollering,” Parsons said. “People crying on the floor, like brain matter
all over the ground. It was just insane, like the closest thing to a war
zone that I’ve ever seen.”</p>
<p>Dedeaux was a responsible daughter — shorter than all her siblings
but the one who helped take care of everyone, Parsons said. Dedeaux had
a job at a hospital and was set to start college and begin working
toward her goal of becoming a registered nurse.</p>
<p>“She had her mind set — she didn’t have everything figured out, but
she had the plan laid down,” Parsons said.</p>
<p>Reggie Hunter</p>
<p>Reggie Hunter, a 37-year-old father of two from Baton Rouge, had just
left work and headed to celebrate New Year’s with a cousin when the
attack happened, another cousin, Shirell Jackson, told Nola.com.</p>
<p>Hunter was killed and his cousin was injured, Jackson said.</p>
<p>Tiger Bech</p>
<p>A former high school and college football player from Louisiana was
among those who died in the attack at New Orleans’ French Quarter,
according to an education official.</p>
<p>Tiger Bech, 28, died late Wednesday morning at a New Orleans
hospital, according to local media outlets citing Kim Broussard, the
athletic director at St. Thomas More Catholic High School in Lafayette.
Bech attended the high school, where he played wide receiver,
quarterback, punt returner and defensive back, NOLA.com reported.</p>
<p>Bech’s LinkedIn profile said he had played football at Princeton
University before graduating in 2021. Most recently he was working as an
investment trader at a New York brokerage firm.</p>
<p>Princeton football coach Bob Surace said Wednesday that he had been
texting with Bech’s father, sharing memories of the player, who was a
kick returner and receiver from 2017 to 2019.</p>
<p>“He might be the first Tiger to ever play for us, and that nickname
kind of described him as a competitor,” Surace told ESPN. The school’s
teams are also called the Tigers. “He was somebody that somehow, like in
the key moments, just excelled and was full of energy, full of
life.”</p>
<p>Bech had been working at Seaport Global, where company spokesperson
Lisa Lieberman could not confirm his death. But she told The Associated
Press that “he was extremely well regarded by everybody who knew
him.”</p>

person dies, 7 hurt in Tesla truck fire outside Trump’s Las Vegas
hotel</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LAS VEGAS, NEVADA — One person died and seven others were injured
Wednesday when a Tesla Cybertruck that appeared to be carrying fireworks
caught fire and exploded outside President-elect Donald Trump’s Las
Vegas hotel, authorities said.</p>
<p>Las Vegas Metropolitan Police and Clark County Fire Department
officials told a news conference that a person died inside the
futuristic-looking truck, and they were working to get the body out.
Seven people nearby had minor injuries and several were taken to a
hospital.</p>
<p>The fire in the valet area of the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas
was reported at 8:40 a.m., a county spokesperson said in a
statement.</p>
<p>According to a law enforcement official, the truck was rented via the
Turo app and appeared to have a load of fireworks. The official spoke on
condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak
publicly.</p>
<p>A Turo spokesperson did not immediately respond to an emailed request
for comment.</p>
<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk said Wednesday afternoon on X that “we have now
confirmed that the explosion was caused by very large fireworks and/or a
bomb carried in the bed of the rented Cybertruck and is unrelated to the
vehicle itself. All vehicle telemetry was positive at the time of the
explosion.”</p>
<p>“The whole Tesla senior team is investigating this matter right now,”
Musk said in an earlier post on the platform after attending a New
Year’s Eve party at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort. “We’ve never seen
anything like this.”</p>
<p>Law enforcement officials have not ruled out terrorism as a possible
motive, a person familiar with the matter said. The person spoke on
condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly
discuss details of the investigation.</p>
<p>“I know you have a lot of questions,” Jeremy Schwartz, acting special
agent in charge for the FBI’s Las Vegas office, told reporters. “We
don’t have a lot of answers.”</p>
<p>President Joe Biden was briefed on the explosion. The truck explosion
came hours after a driver rammed a truck into a crowd in New Orleans’
famed French Quarter early on New Year’s Day, killing at least 15 people
before being shot to death by police.</p>
<p>In Las Vegas, witness Ana Bruce, visiting from Brazil, said she heard
three explosions.</p>
<p>“The first one where we saw the fire, the second one, I guess, was
the battery or something like that, and the third was the big one that
smoked the entire area and was the moment when everyone was told to
evacuate and stay away,” Bruce said.</p>
<p>The 64-story hotel is just off the Las Vegas Strip and across the
street from the Fashion Show Las Vegas shopping mall.</p>
<p>Eric Trump, a son of the president-elect and executive vice president
of the Trump Organization, posted about the fire on the social media
platform X. He praised the fire department and local law enforcement
“for their swift response and professionalism.”</p>

id="power-restored-to-nearly-all-of-puerto-rico-after-major-blackout">Power
restored to nearly all of Puerto Rico after major blackout</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BAYAMON, PUERTO RICO — Power was restored to nearly all electrical
customers across Puerto Rico on Wednesday after a sweeping blackout
plunged the U.S. territory into darkness on New Year’s Eve. </p>
<p>By Wednesday afternoon, power was back up for 98% of Puerto Rico’s
1.47 million utility customers, said Luma Energy, the private company
supplying power to the archipelago. Lights returned to households as
well as Puerto Rico’s hospitals and water and sewage facilities after
the massive outage that exposed the persistent electricity problems
plaguing the island. </p>
<p>Still, the company warned that customers could still see temporary
outages in the coming days. It said full restoration across the island
could take up to two days. </p>
<p>“Given the fragile nature of the grid, we will need to manage
available generation to customer demand, which will likely require
rotating temporary outages,” Juan Saca, president of Luma Energy, said
in a statement. </p>
<p>The lights went off in Puerto Rico at 5:30 a.m. Tuesday, darkening
almost the entire archipelago as people prepared to ring in the New
Year. Authorities are still investigating the cause of the outage, but
Luma Energy said a preliminary review pointed to a failure in an
underground electric line in the south of the territory. </p>
<p>Governor-elect Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon, who is set to take office
Thursday, warned that customers might experience interruptions in the
coming days, with power plants not yet operating at maximum
capacity. </p>
<p>“These days, I urge you to be moderate with your energy consumption
to help reduce load shifting, so that more people can have access to
electricity and the system can start up without any major setbacks,”
Gonzalez-Colon said on the X social media platform.  </p>
<p>On the campaign trail, Gonzalez-Colon promised to appoint an “energy
czar” to oversee the operation of the power grid, which has long been
fragile and faulty due to years of neglect. </p>
<p>The island’s power lines were ravaged in September 2017 by Hurricane
Maria, a Category 4 storm. </p>
<p>Unreliable electricity remains frustratingly common, hindering daily
life for Puerto Ricans. In June, over 340,000 customers were left
without electricity as people reeled from soaring temperatures. In
August, at the peak of Hurricane Ernesto, over half of all utility
customers lost power. Tens of thousands of people remained without
electricity a week after the storm. </p>
<p>The New Year’s Eve outage came as clients brace for a hike in
electricity rates. Last month, Puerto Rico’s Energy Bureau approved an
increase of 2.2 cents per kilowatt hour for residential customers from
January through March, causing electric bills for the average household
to jump by nearly $20, the Energy Bureau said.</p>

id="harry-chandler-navy-medic-who-survived-japans-attack-on-pearl-harbor-dies-at-103">Harry
Chandler, Navy medic who survived Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor, dies
at 103</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>HONOLULU — Harry Chandler, a Navy medic who helped pull injured
sailors from the oily waters of Pearl Harbor after the 1941 Japanese
attack on the naval base, has died. He was 103. </p>
<p>Chandler died Monday at a senior living center in Tequesta, Florida,
according to Ron Mahaffee, the husband of his granddaughter Kelli Fahey.
Chandler had congestive heart failure, but Mahaffee said doctors and
nurses noted his advanced age when giving a cause of death. </p>
<p>The third Pearl Harbor survivor to die in the past few weeks,
Chandler was a hospital corpsman 3rd class on Dec. 7, 1941, when waves
of Japanese fighter planes dropped bombs and fired machine guns on
battleships in the harbor and plunged the U.S. into World War II. </p>
<p>He told The Associated Press in 2023 that he saw the planes approach
as he was raising the flag that morning at a mobile hospital in Aiea
Heights, which is in the hills overlooking the base. </p>
<p>“I thought they were planes coming in from the states until I saw the
bombs dropping,” Chandler said. His first instinct was to take cover and
”get the hell out of here.” </p>
<p>“I was afraid that they’d start strafing,” he said. </p>
<p>His unit rode trucks down to attend to the injured. He said in a
Pacific Historic Parks oral history interview that he boarded a boat to
help pluck wounded sailors from the water. </p>
<p>The harbor was covered in oil from exploding ships, so Chandler
washed the sailors off after lifting them out. He said he was too
focused on his work to be afraid. </p>
<p>“It got so busy you weren’t scared. Weren’t scared at all. We were
busy. It was after you got scared,” Chandler said. </p>
<p>He realized later that he could have been killed, “But you didn’t
think about that while you were busy taking care of people.” </p>
<p>The attack killed more than 2,300 U.S. servicemen. Nearly half, or
1,177, were sailors and Marines on board the USS Arizona, which sank
nine minutes after it was bombed. </p>
<p>Chandler’s memories came flowing back when he visited Pearl Harbor
for a 2023 ceremony commemorating the 82nd anniversary of the
bombing. </p>
<p>“I look out there, and I can still see what’s going on. I can still
see what was happening,” Chandler told The Associated Press. </p>
<p>Asked what he wanted Americans to know about Pearl Harbor, he said:
“Be prepared.” </p>
<p>“We should have known that was going to happen. The intelligence has
to be better,” he said. </p>
<p>After the war Chandler worked as a painter and wallpaper hanger and
bought an upholstery business with his brother. He also joined the Navy
reserves, retiring as a senior chief in 1981. </p>
<p>Chandler was born in Holyoke, Massachusetts, and lived for most of
his adult life in nearby South Hadley, Mahaffee said. In recent decades
he split his time between Massachusetts and Florida. </p>
<p>An avid golfer, he shot five hole-in-ones during his lifetime, his
grandson-in-law added. </p>
<p>Chandler had one biological daughter and adopted two daughters from
his second marriage, to Anna Chandler, who died in 2004. He is survived
by two daughters, nine grandchildren, 17 great-grandchildren and five
great-great-grandchildren. </p>
<p>Military historian J. Michael Wenger has estimated that there were
some 87,000 military personnel on the island of Oahu on the day of the
attack. With Chandler’s death, only 15 are still living, according to a
tally maintained by Kathleen Farley, the California state chair of the
Sons and Daughters of Pearl Harbor Survivors. </p>
<p>Bob Fernandez, who served on the USS Curtiss, also died this month,
at age 100, and Warren Upton, 105, who served on the USS Utah, died last
week.</p>

<h2 id="trump-says-he-plans-to-attend-jimmy-carters-funeral">Trump says
he plans to attend Jimmy Carter’s funeral</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PALM BEACH, FLORIDA — U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said Tuesday
that he’s planning to attend the funeral of former President Jimmy
Carter.</p>
<p>Asked about it as he walked into a New Year’s Eve party at his
Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, Trump responded, “I’ll be there.” Pressed on
whether he’d spoken to members of Carter’s family, Trump said he’d
rather not say.</p>
<p>Funeral services honoring Carter, who died Sunday at 100, will be
held in Georgia and Washington, beginning Jan. 4 and concluding
Jan. 9.</p>
<p>Trump was a frequent and fierce critic of Carter on the campaign
trail ahead of November’s election, using the rising inflation rates of
the 1970s to unfavorably compare President Joe Biden to Carter and his
administration.</p>
<p>The president-elect was gracious about the former president, though,
in posts on his social media site after Carter’s death Sunday, writing
that the nation “owed him a debt of gratitude.”</p>
<p>“While I strongly disagreed with him philosophically and politically,
I also realized that he truly loved and respected our Country, and all
it stands for,” Trump wrote of Carter. “He worked hard to make America a
better place, and for that I give him my highest respect.”</p>
<p>Wearing a tuxedo as he entered the festivities, Trump took a few
minutes of questions from reporters on various topics. He was asked
about the possibility of a ceasefire in Israel’s war with Hamas in Gaza
but said only, “We’re going to see what happens.”</p>
<p>Of hostages seized more than a year ago by Hamas, the president-elect
said, “I’ll put it this way: They better let the hostages come back
soon.”</p>
<p>Trump also said he thought 2025 would be a “great year” and “we’re
going to do fantastically well as a country.”</p>
<p>“There’s a whole light over the whole world, not just our country.
They’re a lot of happy people,” Trump said of recent weeks.</p>
<p>Asked about his resolutions for the new year, Trump said, “I just
want everybody to be happy, healthy and well.”</p>
<p>Trump later took the stage to briefly address the crowd ringing in
the new year at Mar-a-Lago and promised “to do a great job as your
president.”</p>
<p>Biden, for his part, spent New Year’s Eve celebrating the wedding of
his niece Missy Owens in Greenville, Delaware, followed by the reception
in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania. Biden and first lady Jill Biden cut
short their traditional holiday trip to the U.S. Virgin Islands to
attend the ceremony.</p>

id="fbi-investigating-deadly-new-orleans-truck-attack-as-act-of-terrorism">FBI
investigating deadly New Orleans truck attack as ‘act of terrorism’</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A driver crashed a pickup truck into a crowd celebrating New Year’s
early Wednesday in New Orleans, Louisiana, and opened fire, killing 15
people and injuring at least 30. The FBI said it was investigating the
attack as an act of terrorism and did not believe the driver acted
alone.</p>
<p>Investigators found multiple explosive devices in the French Quarter,
The Associated Press reported, citing a Louisiana State Police
intelligence bulletin. Among the devices were two pipe bombs hidden
inside coolers and wired to detonate remotely, the bulletin said.</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden updated the nation on the investigation
Wednesday night.</p>
<p>“The killer was an American citizen born in Texas. He served in the
United States Army in active duty for many years. He also served in the
Army Reserve until a few years ago,” Biden said.</p>
<p>Hours before the attack, the suspect indicated in videos posted on
social media that the attack was inspired by the Islamic State terror
group.</p>
<p>“The law enforcement and intelligence community are continuing to
look for any connections, associations or co-conspirators. We have
nothing additional reported at this time. The investigation is
continuing to be active, and no one should jump to conclusions,” the
president added.</p>
<p>“So many people around the world love New Orleans because of its
history, its culture, and above all, its people,” Biden said. “So I know
while this person committed a terrible assault on the city, the spirit
of our New Orleans will never, never, never be defeated. It always will
shine forth.”</p>
<p>Early morning attack</p>
<p>The attack occurred at 3:15 a.m. on Wednesday at the intersection of
Canal and Bourbon streets in the city’s lively French Quarter. The
historic tourist destination filled with bars and music is also known
for its large New Year’s Eve celebrations.</p>
<p>After the vehicle crashed, the driver got out of the car and opened
fire on responding officers, police said. Officers returned fire,
killing the suspect, according to police. Two officers were wounded but
are in stable condition, police said.</p>
<p>“This is not just an act of terrorism. This is evil,” New Orleans
Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick told reporters at a press
conference earlier Wednesday.</p>
<p>The FBI identified the suspect as Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a 42-year-old
U.S. citizen from Texas.</p>
<p>“An ISIS flag was located in the vehicle, and the FBI is working to
determine the subject’s potential associations and affiliations with
terrorist organizations,” the FBI, which is leading the investigation,
said in a statement.</p>
<p>The suspect served in the U.S. Army for years but had been out of the
military for some time, officials said.</p>
<p>Investigators found weapons and a potential explosive device in the
vehicle, the FBI said, along with the other potential explosive devices
found in the French Quarter. The vehicle appeared to have been rented,
the FBI said.</p>
<p>More than 300 officers were on duty during the incident, police
said.</p>
<p>Biden said he has been continually briefed on the attack. He has also
been briefed on a Cybertruck fire near the Trump International Hotel Las
Vegas and has directed his team to offer any federal assistance needed,
the White House said.</p>
<p>“My heart goes out to the victims and their families who were simply
trying to celebrate the holiday. There is no justification for violence
of any kind, and we will not tolerate any attack on any of our nation’s
communities,” Biden said in a statement on the social media platform
X.</p>
<p>The White House said it has been in touch with New Orleans Mayor
LaToya Cantrell to offer support.</p>
<p>“The FBI is already on the ground supporting local law enforcement in
the investigation and the President will continue to be briefed
throughout the day,” the White House said in a statement.</p>
<p>The Justice Department said Attorney General Merrick Garland was also
briefed on the attack.</p>
<p>President-elect Donald Trump condemned the attack in a post on his
social media platform Truth Social.</p>
<p>“Our hearts are with all the innocent victims and their loved ones,”
Trump said. “The Trump Administration will fully support the City of New
Orleans as they investigate and recover from this act of pure evil!”</p>
<p>Video taken by an onlooker at the scene of the attack shows at least
two twisted bodies lying in the street, with one of them in what appears
to be a pool of blood. A bystander is seen kneeling over one of the
bodies.</p>
<p>Those injured in the attack were taken to five hospitals, according
to NOLA Ready, the city’s emergency preparedness department.</p>
<p>“As we search for a motive, remember there is no making sense of
evil,” New Orleans City Council member Oliver Thomas said.</p>
<p>In a statement on X, Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry urged people to
stay away from the site of the attack, calling the incident “a horrific
act of violence.”</p>
<p>Crowds were also out partying in New Orleans because the city was set
to host college football’s Sugar Bowl game Wednesday night. Officials
confirmed Wednesday afternoon that the game would be postponed until
Thursday night.</p>
<p>Additionally, New Orleans is set to host the NFL’s Super Bowl on
February 9.</p>
<p>New Orleans has experienced violence surrounding celebrations in the
past.</p>
<p>In November 2024, two people were killed and 10 others injured in two
separate shootings along a New Orleans parade route and a celebration
attended by thousands of people, according to local media.</p>
<p>Some information in this report came from Reuters and The Associated
Press.</p>

Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Jesse Jenkins: </strong> If you build a tariff wall around
America and you say, <em><em>You must buy American-made panels or pay a
huge tariff</em></em>, we could build a domestic solar manufacturing
sector, but it would by no means be required to be globally competitive.
And if you were to remove those protections, it would probably
immediately collapse. […] If you want to, you have a competitive agenda,
you need to be developing a particular type of industry that can be
competitive. And I think that Michael’s question hints that maybe that’s
not that important in the case of solar because it’s just not a very
high-margin business. It’s kind of a bad business to be in. There’s
consistent overcapacity and margins are thin, if not non-existent.<br/>
<br/> <strong>Robinson Meyer: </strong>Jenny Chase At BloombergNEF, who
is the master of solar manufacturing, consistently describes it as one
of the worst businesses in the world because these Chinese manufacturers
— and now, more broadly, these Chinese and Southeast Asian manufacturers
— are just constantly competing each other out of business.<br/> <br/> I
will say, I want to attach an asterisk to globally competitive, right?
There’s like a B part to that, which is, do you think dominating in this
industry is going to create know-how that allows you to dominate future
technologies we don’t understand yet?<br/> <br/>
<strong>Jenkins:</strong> Yeah, are there general-purpose manufacturing
techniques or core technology components here that you think are going
to be useful in a variety of other sectors? I think that’s true.<br/>
<br/> I look at batteries, for example, as a critical general-purpose
technology for the 21st century, right? Like, good batteries are going
to be in everything, and so the ability to produce those and to continue
to innovate and be at the frontier there, it’s important to national
defense. It’s important to the transportation sector. It’s important to
consumer products. You know, it’s just a critical platform technology,
and a lot of the innovations in material science and electrochemistry
and other things that you need to develop for batteries have other
broader applications in decarbonizing industry and producing other
products.<br/> <br/> So I think that’s a good example of a case where,
even if you’re a little behind the technology or frontier, there’s a lot
of value to trying to catch up there for, for broader reasons.

id="us-chief-justice-warns-of-dangerous-calls-to-disregard-court-rulings">US
chief justice warns of ‘dangerous’ calls to disregard court rulings</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts on Tuesday warned about
a rising number of threats to the judiciary’s independence, including
calls for violence against judges and suggestions by elected officials
to disregard court rulings they disagree with.</p>
<p>Roberts in an annual year-end report on the judiciary released just
weeks before Republican President-elect Donald Trump takes office did
not directly address what polling suggests has been a decline in public
confidence in the judicial system broadly.</p>
<p>But Roberts said he felt compelled to highlight several areas of
“illegitimate activity” that went far beyond informed criticism and
debate concerning judicial rulings, which he said, “threaten the
independence of judges on which the rule of law depends.”</p>
<p>Those areas of threats, he said, include a significant uptick in
violent threats and online intimidation directed at judges,
disinformation about court cases magnified by social media, and
cyberthreats posed by foreign state actors.</p>
<p>In the past five years, the U.S. Marshals Service has investigated
more than 1,000 serious threats against federal judges, Roberts wrote.
In some extreme cases, judicial officers have been issued bulletproof
vests, he said.</p>
<p>He cited the risks of hackers stealing confidential information and
of hostile foreign state actors spreading disinformation online,
including by using bots to distort judicial decisions and “foment
discord within our democracy.”</p>
<p>Roberts also highlighted what he said were instances in the past few
years in which “elected officials from across the political spectrum
have raised the specter of open disregard for federal court
rulings.”</p>
<p>“These dangerous suggestions, however sporadic, must be soundly
rejected,” Roberts wrote.</p>
<p>Roberts, a member of the court’s 6-3 conservative majority, did not
specify what cases he was referring to, nor did he reference recent
Supreme Court rulings that have set off political firestorms.</p>
<p>Those include its 2022 decision rolling back abortion rights or its
July ruling granting Trump substantial immunity for actions taken in
office in the now-dismissed 2020 election subversion criminal case he
faced.</p>
<p>The abortion ruling prompted protests outside of several justices’
homes, and an armed man was charged in 2022 with attempting to
assassinate conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh after being arrested
near his home.</p>
<p>Roberts’ report also did not discuss recent ethics controversies
concerning gifts and travel received by members of the Supreme Court
that have prompted investigations by Democratic lawmakers and calls for
reforms.</p>
<p>Roberts acknowledged court rulings can “provoke strong and passionate
reactions” and said criticism was not a threat, and that “public
engagement with the work of the courts results in a better-informed
polity and a more robust democracy.”</p>
<p>But he said public officials “regrettably have engaged in recent
attempts to intimidate judges — for example, suggesting political bias
in the judge’s adverse rulings without a credible basis for such
allegations.”</p>
<p>“Public officials certainly have a right to criticize the work of the
judiciary, but they should be mindful that intemperance in their
statements when it comes to judges may prompt dangerous reactions by
others,” he wrote.</p>

<h2 id="us-capitol-riot-fugitive-seeks-asylum-in-canada">US Capitol riot
fugitive seeks asylum in Canada</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>OTTAWA, ONTARIO, CANADA — An American man who fled after being
sentenced to prison for his role in the U.S. Capitol riot is now seeking
political asylum in Canada, as he waits and hopes for a pardon when
Donald Trump returns to the White House.</p>
<p>Antony Vo, 32, was sentenced to nine months behind bars and ordered
to report to a federal prison on June 14, 2024, but instead he fled to
Canada.</p>
<p>More than 1,500 people have been charged in connection with the
Jan. 6, 2021, assault on Congress, which sought to disrupt certification
of President Joe Biden’s election victory.</p>
<p>Vo, from Indiana, was convicted at a jury trial in Washington of four
counts of entering a restricted building and disorderly conduct related
to his actions.</p>
<p>“I knew Canada has a history of being welcoming to refugees, from
Vietnam War draft dodgers to the people who hid Edward Snowden in Hong
Kong,” he told AFP. “So I packed up my snowboarding gear and drove
across the border.”</p>
<p>In refugee claim documents, Vo said the riot was “a peaceful protest”
that was “subverted as part of a domestic regime-change operation to
politically assassinate Trump and his supporters.”</p>
<p>He added that he was “persecuted, maltreated,” and subjected to an
“unfair trial” over his political beliefs, and if sent back to the
United States would be jailed “under inhumane conditions.”</p>
<p>The assault on the Capitol followed a fiery speech by then-president
Trump to tens of thousands of his supporters near the White House, in
which he repeated his false claims that he won the 2020 vote.</p>
<p>More than 140 police officers were injured during hours of clashes
with rioters wielding flagpoles, baseball bats, hockey sticks and other
makeshift weapons along with Tasers and canisters of bear spray.</p>
<p>Vo insisted that he saw no violence.</p>
<p>Images on social media showed Vo and his mother, Annie – who fled
Vietnam in 1991 and was granted asylum in the United States – smiling
inside the Capitol that day. She was arrested in March and is awaiting
trial.</p>
<p>Vo said he hopes to stay in Canada “until the situation is safe for
me to return” to the United States. “When Donald Trump takes office, I
hope he pardons me and the rest of the January 6 protesters.”</p>
<p>Trump has called the rioters patriots and political prisoners and
told a CNN town hall that he was “inclined to pardon many of them.”</p>
<p>Several Capitol riot defendants have seized upon Trump’s election
victory over Vice President Kamala Harris to ask that their trials or
sentencing be put on hold.</p>
<p>Trump himself, who takes office again in January, was charged with
conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election.</p>
<p>But the case never made it to trial and is now being wound down under
the Justice Department’s policy of not prosecuting a sitting
president.</p>
<p>Vo said that he had also tried to seek asylum in Argentina, Mexico,
El Salvador, Vietnam, Belarus, and Russia.</p>
<p>“I seriously explored getting paramotoring lessons and then
paramotoring from Key West to Cuba to seek asylum there too,” he said in
his claim.</p>
<p>Vo said that in Canada, “people have really taken good care of
me.”</p>

oil production rose to record high in October, data show</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — U.S. oil production rose 260,000 barrels per day
month-over-month to a record 13.46 million bpd in October as demand
surged to the highest levels since the pandemic, data from the U.S.
Energy Information Administration showed on Tuesday.</p>
<p>U.S. oil output has grown rapidly this year as drilling operations
became more efficient, even as concerns of oversupply have weighed
heavily on prices for the commodity amid weaker-than-expected demand
growth, especially in China, the top oil-importing nation.</p>
<p>Year-over-year, U.S. oil production rose 2.3% in October, while West
Texas Intermediate crude futures prices CLc1 averaged 16% lower during
the month, according to Reuters calculations.</p>
<p>Still, the pace of growth of U.S. oil output is moderating, analysts
said. Annual oil production growth in the U.S. is tracking around
300,000 to 400,000 bpd in 2024, versus nearly a million bpd in 2023,
said Alex Hodes, energy analyst at brokerage StoneX.</p>
<p>“There have been a few infrastructure constraints that have kept
production somewhat muted, but I would expect that we will see a lot of
the same in 2025,” Hodes said.</p>
<p>Strong U.S. oil demand in October was the biggest surprise in the
EIA’s Petroleum Supply Monthly report, UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo
said.</p>
<p>Total U.S. oil demand rose by about 700,000 bpd from September to
21.01 million bpd in October, the highest since August 2019, EIA data
showed. Demand for distillate fuels, which include diesel and heating
oil, rose to 4.06 million bpd in October, the highest in a year.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
We’re now a quarter of the way through the 21st century, and it’s
indisputable that climate is one of the most important stories of our
time. That’s
<a href="https://heatmap.news/heatmap-turns-1" target="_self"><u>our
philosophy here at Heatmap</u></a>, but just about everything around us
illustrates it, too — from
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics" target="_self"><u>government
policy</u></a> and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology" target="_self"><u>tech</u></a>
to
<a href="https://heatmap.news/fast-x-evs-furious-electrification" target="_self"><u>movies</u></a>
and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/love-is-blind-taylor-krause" target="_self"><u>reality
TV</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
And of course — or maybe, especially — books.
</p>
<p>
It’s been about 17 years since the term “cli-fi” (or “climate fiction”)
was
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/may/31/global-warning-rise-cli-fi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>first
coined</u></a>, and in the meantime, books that touch on climate themes
in both fiction and nonfiction have taken off like the
<a href="https://keelingcurve.ucsd.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Keeling
Curve</u></a>. In 2025, we’ll be reading novels that imagine life in San
Francisco after years of deluge and investigative reports into subjects
such as how companies have gotten away with dumping
<a href="https://heatmap.news/lifestyle/raincoats-pfas-gore-tex-patagonia-rei" target="_self"><u>forever
chemicals</u></a> into the environment for so long. There will be new
natural histories to dive into — on the desert, forests, prairies, and
even on the chemical compound CO2 — as well as new frames of thinking
about climate change and how we approach its solutions.
</p>
<p>
Because so many 2025 books will touch on climate themes, I’ve set aside
a section of honorable mentions at the end of this list that are also
worth checking out. The division doesn’t indicate quality; I chose the
primary 18 based on my subjective excitement and to showcase different
genres, publishers, and authors. It might be in the appendix that you
find a book on the topic <em><em>you’re</em></em> personally most
excited about (Arctic exploration? Solar geoengineering? Florida-set
family dramas?) for next year.

place or judge them by their (excellent) covers, you can browse our

<h3>
<em>American Oasis: Finding the Future in the Cities of the
Southwest</em>, by Kyle Paoletta (January 14)
</h3>
<p>
The U.S. government’s Fifth National Climate Assessment section on the
Southwest reads like an apocalyptic horror story: “Heat-related
mortality,” “increased wildfire risks,” and “longer and more severe
droughts” all make it into the opening few paragraphs. The truth is that
the hottest and driest region of the United States is home to 60 million
people, many of whom will have to adapt to a more extreme future in the
coming years. In New Mexico-born journalist Kyle Paoletta’s debut book,
<em><em>American Oasis</em></em>, he traces the allure of places like
Albuquerque, Phoenix, El Paso, and Las Vegas back to the
<a href="https://library.fiveable.me/hs-new-mexico-history/unit-1/athabaskan-migration-early-apache-navajo-history/study-guide/1623CMuJcjMibm98" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Athapaskan
migration from the sub-Arctic</u></a> around 1100 BCE and through the
heydays of <em><em>Arizona Highways</em></em>, a magazine from the
1950s, while also charting what lies ahead for those who are drawn to
making the desert, however impossibly, their home. <em><em>Preorder it

<em>Elegy, Southwest</em>, by Madeleine Watts (Feb. 18)
</h3>
<p>
Speaking of the American desert, on the fiction side of things this
winter comes Madeleine Watts’ latest novel, <em><em>Elegy,
Southwest</em></em>. Watts made a name for herself as a writer of cli-fi
after the release of her 2021 novel, <em><em>The Inland Sea</em></em>,
set against the backdrop of Australia’s fires and floods, and she
returns this year with a road trip novel that follows Eloise, a doctoral
student studying the Colorado River and climate change. As part of her
research, Eloise flies to Las Vegas for a road trip through the
Southwest with her husband, Lewis, to whom the novel is addressed. Along
the way, Eloise begins to believe she’s pregnant, while Lewis struggles
with the fresh grief of losing his mother. As Watts
<a href="https://www.the-berliner.com/books/madeleine-watts-inland-sea-interview/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>told
an interviewer</u></a> of her process for <em><em>The Inland
Sea</em></em>, “I wanted to write … about what it’s like to live in the
experience of a changing climate that is not always a tangible part of
your day-to-day but that’s already there – it’s in the air all around
you.” Expect a similar treatment this go-round.<em>

<h3>
<em>Dream State</em>, by Eric Puchner (Feb. 18)
</h3>
<p>
Eric Puchner’s new novel, <em><em>Dream State</em></em>, is the story of
two marriages set over 50 years. With the book opening in 2004, that
naturally requires some speculation about the future — in this case, the
future of “a rapidly warming Montana.” As <em><em>The
Indypendent</em></em> writes
<a href="https://indypendent.org/2024/11/a-group-of-friends-ages-together-in-novel-with-climate-crisis-motif/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>in
an early review</u></a>, “The looming climate crisis — declining
snowfall, depleted wildlife, raging seasonal wildfires, and abnormally
warm temperatures — is writ large in the book, forming a blistering
backdrop, highlighting newfound restrictions on what both residents and
short-term visitors can now see and do in the area.” The novel has
earned praise from Pulitzer Prize-winner Adam Johnson, who called it “a
masterpiece,” as well as author Lynn Steger Strong, who has a climate
book of her own on the list below.<em><strong>

<em>The Unworthy</em>, by Agustina Bazterrica, translated by Sarah Moses
(March 4)
</h3>
<p>
Four years ago, Argentinean author Agustina Bazterrica burst onto
Americans’ radars with the English-language translation of her 2017
novel<em>
</em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/95482/9781982150921" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>Tender
Is the Flesh</em></em></u></a>, a book that imagines a future in which
animals have become toxic to humans, leading us to resort to
industrialized cannibalism. (Critics have described it, vividly, as
“splatterpunk.”) This year, Bazterrica turns her attention from factory
farming to the climate catastrophe, telling the story of a member of a
“Sacred Sisterhood” cloistered in a mysterious convent who is prompted
to reflect on her life outside its walls when a new acolyte arrives.
Don’t expect Bazterrica to soften her critiques of capitalism here,
though it’s not all doom and gloom; early readers have
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/thebellekeys/p/DDAGgUoRsnr/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said</u></a>

<h3>
<em>Wild Dark Shore</em>, by Charlotte McConaghy (March 4)
</h3>
<p>
Charlotte McConaghy’s follow-up novel to her critically acclaimed 2020
debut, <em><em>Migrations</em></em>, is set on a fictional research
island, Shearwater, located between Australia and Antarctica. Dominic
Salt, the caretaker of the island’s
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/endangered-species-dna-us-fish-and-wildlife-service" target="_self"><u>seed
vault</u></a>, has called the refuge home for the past eight years —
ever since fleeing Australia’s accelerating natural disasters, hoping to
find a safer place to raise his three children. But with rising sea
levels now threatening the island, Dominic and his family have just
seven weeks left before they plan to move on. Just before their
departure, Dominic’s oldest daughter discovers a woman who has
shipwrecked on shore, and the tension — and mystery — starts to grow.
<em><em>Wild Dark Shore</em></em> has earned a starred review from
<a href="https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/charlotte-mcconaghy/wild-dark-shore/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Kirkus</u></a>,
which calls it a “terrific thriller.” <em><em>Preorder it

<em>Climate Injustice: Why We Need to Fight Global Inequality to Combat
Climate Change</em>, by Friederike Otto (March 25)
</h3>
<p>
Climatologist,

Climate laureate Friederike Otto

not mince words</u></a> about who is most impacted by extreme weather —
and who needs to be involved in the solutions. “If we leave the issue of
climate change to white men, it’ll continue to be treated as a physical
problem with technological solutions,” she has said, adding, “The more
diverse the people working on it, the closer we get to implementing
these solutions and making progress on climate change.” Her new book,
<em><em>Climate Injustice</em></em>, elaborates on her thesis further,
using the stories of real people in the Global South to illustrate how
exploitation, sexism, and colonialism have created a crisis with unequal
impacts. <em><em>Preorder it

<em>How Can I Help?: Saving Nature with Your Yard</em>, by Douglas W.
Tallamy (April 1)
</h3>
<p>
Everyone who works in the climate space is familiar with the question
posed in the title of this book. Entomologist Douglas W. Tallamy is one
of the leading proponents of the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/is-native-gardening-becoming-pointless" target="_self"><u>native
gardens movement</u></a>, and in <em><em>How Can I Help?</em></em>, he
answers a query implied in his own earlier book, 2009’s <em><em>Bringing
Nature Home</em></em>: that “unless we restore native plants to our
suburban ecosystems, the future of biodiversity in the United States is
dim.” <em><em>How Can I Help?</em></em> is structured to address some of
the most common questions Tallamy encounters during his lectures about
how individuals can become directors of their own miniature national
parks at home. Despite the daunting challenge of biodiversity loss,
Tallamy offers actionable ideas for helping the planet, with
conservation beginning in your backyard.<em><strong>

<em>Poisoning the Well: How Forever Chemicals Contaminated America</em>,
by Sharon Udasin and Rachel Frazin (April 10)
</h3>
<p>
If I had to make one prediction for 2025, it’d be that we will
<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/what-is-maha-health-wellness-movement-rfk-jr-policies.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>hear
a lot more about</u></a> per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances — that is,
the “forever chemicals” commonly known as PFAS. The chemicals are found
in everything from our dental floss to
<a href="https://heatmap.news/lifestyle/raincoats-pfas-gore-tex-patagonia-rei" target="_self"><u>our
clothes</u></a>, but perhaps most disturbingly, they’re also found in
our drinking water. In <em><em>Poisoning the Well</em></em>, <em><em>The
Hill</em></em> staff writers Sharon Udasin and Rachel Frazin follow how
PFAS got into our environment in the first place — a story of corporate
greed and cover-ups that will be familiar to anyone aware of the fossil
fuel playbook. <em><em>Preorder it

<em>What’s Left: Three Paths Through the Planetary Crisis</em>, by
Malcolm Harris (April 15)
</h3>
<p>
Journalist Malcolm Harris’ last book was an “encyclopedic,” 700-page
history of the city of
<a href="https://bookshop.org/a/95482/9780316592017" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Palo
Alto</u></a>, which became a fixture of best-of-the-year lists after it
came out last February. Hot on its heels is Harris’ follow-up,
<em><em>What’s Left</em></em> (which slow readers will be relieved to
hear is less of a time commitment, at 320 pages). Harris’ intention with
his new work is to explore “our remaining options for saving the world,”
all of which involve varying degrees of collective action but which
escalate from “progressive” to “socialist” to “revolutionary.” It’s one
that you can be sure will have people talking. <em><em>Preorder it

<em>Hope Dies Last: Visionary People Across the World, Fighting to Find
Us a Future</em>, by Alan Weisman (April 22)
</h3>
<p>
Alan Weisman’s hugely successful 2007 book,
<a href="https://bookshop.org/a/95482/9781250834003" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>The
World Without Us</em></em></u></a>, speculated about humanity’s legacy
if we suddenly disappeared. (<em><em>Slate</em></em> named it in 2019 as
<a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/11/50-best-nonfiction-books.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>one
of the 50 best</u></a> nonfiction books in the past quarter-century.)
Now, Weisman turns his attention to helping us stick around. “I am
working on a book with kind of a vast topic, which is what are
humanity’s best and most realistic hopes for getting through this very
difficult century that we have,” he told
<a href="https://www.tbsnews.net/features/panorama/hope-dies-last-tete-tete-alan-weisman-515394" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Bangladesh’s
</u><u><em><em>Business Standard</em></em></u></a> in 2022, while
visiting the country during the research stage of his new project,
<em><em>Hope Dies Last</em></em>. Weisman’s book took him all over the
world — including the Korean de-militarized zone, the Netherlands, and
the Marshall Islands — as he looked to speak with people across
disciplines and professions about how we can approach our future. Bill
McKibben has described the result as “a nonfiction companion to Kim

<em>Truth Demands: A Memoir of Murder, Oil Wars, and the Rise of Climate
Justice</em>, by Abby Reyes (May 6)
</h3>
<p>
In 1999, 24-year-old environmentalist Terence Unity Freitas traveled to
Colombia to support the Indigenous U’wa people in resisting Occidental
Petroleum, which was interested in drilling to extract some 1.5 billion
barrels of oil from beneath the cloud forest. During what was supposed
to be a weeklong visit, Freitas was kidnapped by the Armed Revolutionary
Forces of Colombia (better known as FARC) along with two other
Americans; their bodies were later found, bound and shot, just over the
border in Venezuela. Twenty years later, Abby Reyes — the author of this
memoir and Freitas’ partner at the time of his death — was recognized as
a victim in Colombia’s truth and reconciliation process, resurfacing old
griefs, reflections, and questions. “I bring the reader along in my
demand for truth before the tribunal while awakening our collective
awareness of what the truth demands of all of us in this era of
ecological collapse and social transformation,” Reyes

<em>Awake in the Floating City</em>, by Susanna Kwan (May 13)
</h3>
<p>
In Susanna Kwan’s debut novel, <em><em>Awake in the Floating
City</em></em>, San Francisco is almost entirely underwater. Years of
Biblical rain mean most people have already evacuated, but Bo — who lost
her mother to the waters — lingers long past when sensible people have
fled. Then one day, she receives a note from her neighbor, Mia, a
130-year-old woman who doesn’t want to leave the city, either; together,
the two become the last people left in San Francisco. “What
post-apocalyptic vision dares be so gorgeous?” marvels the author Meng
Jin in one of the book’s early blurbs.<em><em> Preorder it

<em>Take to the Trees: A Story of Hope, Science, and Self-Discovery in
America’s Imperiled Forests</em>, by Marguerite Holloway (May 13)
</h3>
<p>
Identical twin sister arborists teach the Women’s Tree Climbing
Workshop. While that sounds like the beginning of a fairy tale, it’s the
delightfully real-life starting point of journalist Marguerite
Holloway’s <em><em>Take to the Trees</em></em>. “I was there to be in
trees and to better understand them,” she writes of her attendance at
the climbing workshop. “Trees and forests are facing existential threats
because of climate change, but it can be a struggle to grasp the extent
of the danger.” While not all of us have the time, ability, or
inclination to take to such “gut-lurching” heights to learn more, we can
read <em><em>Take to the Trees</em></em>, which records Holloway’s
experience overcoming her fears and learning to appreciate the threat to
American forests. <em><em>Preorder it

<em>Sea of Grass: The Conquest, Ruin, and Redemption of Nature on the
American Prairie</em>, by Dave Hage and Josephine Marcotty (May 27)
</h3>
<p>
Natural history is one of my favorite genres, and I’m especially excited
for <em><em>Sea of Grass </em></em>by <em><em>Minnesota Star
Tribute</em></em> journalists Dave Hage and Josephine Marcotty about one
of the more neglected ecosystems of the genre: the American prairie. The
grassland, which makes up a vast swath of the inner United States, is an
incredible self-sustaining marvel — and nearly as biodiverse as a
tropical rainforest. Yet many people today still either share European
settlers’ disinterested view of the landscape or adopt a purely
utilitarian one — which is why, after 200 years of plows, drainages, and
nitrogen fertilizers, the effects have been “catastrophic.” Still,
plenty of people who live on the prairie understand the importance of
protecting such a special ecosystem, and Hage and Marcotty follow the
effort to work <em><em>alongside</em></em> the land, not just against
it. <em><em>Sea of Grass</em></em> earned a coveted blurb from McKibben,
in which he calls the book “well worth the read.” <em><em>Preorder it

We’ve been attempting to predict the weather for as long as humans have

leap forward from
<a href="https://heatmap.news/culture/old-farmers-almanac-climate-change" target="_self"><u>the

<em>Human Nature: Nine Ways to Feel about Our Changing Planet</em>, by

</h3>
<p>
Climate scientist
<a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-s2e15-kate-marvel" target="_self"><u>and
Shift Key guest</u></a> Kate Marvel structured her highly anticipated
first book around nine different emotional lenses for looking at climate
change. That might seem like an odd angle for a scientist, since
researchers are specifically taught <em><em>not</em></em> to bring
emotion into their work. Still, she contends that just as there is no
one way to feel about climate change, there is no one emotion we can tap
to guide our response to it, either. From hope to pride to love, Marvel
urges readers to get deep into their feels in <em><em>Human
Nature</em></em>, which also touches on “Greek mythology,” “witches,”
“geophysical fluid dynamics,” and “romantic comedies” — though
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/drkatemarvel.bsky.social/post/3lbrz2fb52c2w" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>according

<em>We Are Eating the Earth: The Race to Fix Our Food System and Save

Addressing climate change will require us to address how we eat, which
accounts for a third of our carbon emissions. How to ameliorate that is

mass extinctions. His follow-up, <em><em>The Story of CO2 Is the Story

that have allowed life to exist in the first place. Of course, the great
irony of carbon dioxide is that while it has made our planet habitable,
fluctuations in its presence in the atmosphere are also responsible for
things like almost killing our ancestors all off in

Zealand’s Auckland is first major city to welcome 2025 with fireworks
and light show</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WELLINGTON, NEW ZEALAND — Auckland has become the first major city to
welcome 2025, with thousands of revelers counting down to the new year
and cheering at colorful fireworks launched from New Zealand’s tallest
structure, Sky Tower, and a spectacular downtown light show. </p>
<p>Thousands also thronged to downtown or climbed the city’s ring of
volcanic peaks for a fireworks vantage point, and a light display
recognizing Auckland’s Indigenous tribes. It follows a year marked by
protests over Māori rights in the nation of 5 million. </p>
<p>Countries in the South Pacific Ocean are the first to ring in the New
Year, with midnight in New Zealand striking 18 hours before the ball
drop in Times Square in New York. Other cities around the world are
readying with celebrations highlighting local cultures and traditions,
after a year roiled by ongoing conflict and political instability. </p>
<p>In Australia, more than 1 million people are now expected at Sydney
Harbor for the traditional fireworks. British pop star Robbie Williams
will lead a singalong and Indigenous ceremonies and performances will
acknowledge the land’s first people. </p>
<p>Much of Japan has shut down ahead of the nation’s biggest holiday, as
temples and homes underwent a thorough cleaning, including swatting
floor mats called “tatami” with big sticks. </p>
<p>The upcoming Year of the Snake in the Asian zodiac is heralded as one
of rebirth — alluding to the reptile’s shedding skin. Stores in Japan,
which observes the zodiac cycle from Jan. 1, have been selling tiny
figures of smiling snakes and other snake-themed products. Other places
in Asia will start marking the Year of the Snake later, with the Lunar
New Year. </p>
<p>In South Korea, celebrations were cut back or canceled as the country
observes a period of national mourning following the Sunday crash of a
Jeju Air flight at Muan that killed 179 people. </p>
<p>New Year celebrations in Jakarta will feature a dazzling fireworks
display, including a drone show featuring 800 drones, followed by
countdowns to midnight at the city’s iconic Hotel Indonesia
Roundabout. </p>
<p>New Year’s celebrations are likely to be subdued in Israel as its war
with Hamas in Gaza grinds through a 15th month and scores of hostages
remain in captivity. </p>
<p>Rome’s traditional New Year’s Eve festivities have an additional
draw: the start of Pope Francis’ Holy Year, the
once-every-quarter-century celebration projected to bring some 32
million pilgrims to the Eternal City in 2025. </p>
<p>On Tuesday, Francis will celebrate a vespers at St. Peter’s Basilica,
followed by Mass on Wednesday, when he is expected to once again appeal
for peace amid wars raging in Ukraine and the Middle East. </p>
<p>Hours before Germany rings in the new year, Chancellor Olaf Scholz
called on the country’s 84 million residents to stick together despite
the many global crises and wars, the country’s ailing economy and a
deadly Christmas market attack that shocked the nation. </p>
<p>“We are a country of togetherness. And we can draw strength from this
— especially in difficult times like these,” Scholz said in his
prerecorded speech. </p>
<p>Paris will cap a momentous 2024 with its traditional festive
countdown and fireworks extravaganza on the famed Champs-Elysées. </p>
<p>The Summer Olympics and Paralympic Games hosted in the French capital
from July to September transformed the city into a site of joy,
fraternity and astonishing sporting achievements, and marked another
major milestone in its recovery from deadly extremist attacks in 2015 by
al-Qaida and the Islamic State group. </p>
<p>London is due to ring in the New Year with a pyrotechnic display
along the River Thames and a parade through the city center on Wednesday
featuring 10,000 performers. The fireworks will explode against the
backdrop of the London Eye, the massive Ferris wheel across the river
from Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament. </p>
<p>With a storm bringing bitter weather to other parts of the United
Kingdom, however, festivities in Edinburgh, Scotland — including the
Hogmanay Street party, garden concert and castle pyrotechnics show —
were already canceled. </p>
<p>Rio de Janeiro will throw Brazil’s main New Year’s Eve bash on
Copacabana Beach, with 10 ferries offshore bearing 12 straight minutes
of fireworks. Thousands of tourists in six cruise ships will witness the
show up close. </p>
<p>Rio’s City Hall was closely guarding its plans for a display of
lights and sounds. More than 2 million people are expected at the
Copacabana, hoping to squeeze into concerts by superstar Brazilian
artists such as pop singer Anitta and Grammy-award winner Caetano
Veloso. </p>
<p>In New York City, the organization managing Times Square has tested
its famous ball drop, and inspected 2025 numerals, lights and thousands
of crystals, as part of a tradition going back to 1907. This year’s
celebration will include musical performances by TLC, Jonas Brothers,
Rita Ora, and Sophie Ellis-Bextor. </p>
<p>The party, covering multiple blocks around the city’s main tourism
and theater hub, is expected to draw large crowds despite rain and
chilly weather. </p>
<p>Celebrations will echo around the globe as the New Year arrives in
different time zones, with American Samoa among the last to welcome 2025
a full 24 hours after New Zealand.</p>

id="southerners-in-us-clean-up-after-tornadoes-sweep-region">Southerners
in US clean up after tornadoes sweep region</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW CANEY, TEXAS — Cleanup was under way Monday after a strong storm
system spawned hail, rain, high winds and tornadoes across the southern
United States over the weekend, killing at least four people. </p>
<p>As of Monday afternoon, more than 30 tornadoes had been confirmed as
crews worked through about 50 reports of tornado damage spanning from
Texas to South Carolina, said Mark Wiley, an emergency response
specialist with the National Weather Service’s Southern Region
Headquarters. </p>
<p>The storms came over a busy holiday travel weekend, causing some
treacherous road conditions along with delays or cancellations at some
of the busiest U.S. airports. </p>
<p>The storms first hit Saturday around the Houston, Texas, area, where
the National Weather Service by Monday had confirmed six tornadoes. </p>
<p>“Some of the damage was pretty substantial, some cases leveling
homes, some producing quite a bit of roof damage,” said Brian Kyle, lead
forecaster with the National Weather Service in Houston. </p>
<p>About 50 homes in Montgomery County sustained major damage and 30
were destroyed, county official Jason Smith said. A couple hundred more
homes sustained minor or cosmetic damage, he said. </p>
<p>Cleanup crews labored over the weekend and were continuing to pick up
debris Monday. </p>
<p>‘I could hear it roar’</p>
<p>Carlos Benitez, 41, was already working to rebuild his auto repair
shop in the New Caney area. Benitez said he closed his eyes as the storm
blew through and when he opened them, “everything’s down.” </p>
<p>Sasha Zamora, 39, lives nearby, and was trying to put her baby to
sleep when she realized how serious the storm was. “Immediately, the
wind picked up so fast that things were hitting the window,” she said,
recounting how she rushed her children to the center of the house.
Though her family and her property came through the storm OK, her
neighbor’s mobile home flipped over, Zamora said. </p>
<p>Officials in Mississippi said two people were killed in storms there,
including an 18-year-old who died after a tree fell on her home Saturday
night in Natchez in Adams County. About 22,000 Mississippians remained
without power Monday afternoon, according to the website PowerOutage.us.
In Texas, a 48-year-old woman died in the Liverpool area south of
Houston, said Madison Polston of the Brazoria County Sheriff’s Office.
She said the woman was found about 30 meters from her home. </p>
<p>Dozens of homes and buildings were significantly damaged in Brazoria
County, including an elementary school. </p>
<p>In North Carolina, a 70-year-old man was killed Sunday in
Statesville, just north of Charlotte, when a tree landed on the pickup
truck he was driving. Highway Patrol Trooper DJ Maffucci said, “It was
just a freak accident” and he believed Matthew Teeple, of Cleveland,
North Carolina, was killed instantly. </p>
<p>Maffucci said that the storms were responsible for a number of downed
trees and “quite a few wrecks.” </p>
<p>In the Alabama city of Athens, northwest of Huntsville, the storm
damaged the downtown area, said city spokeswoman Holly Hollman. Large
HVAC units were hurled from the tops of building and the roof was ripped
off a bookstore. A full-sized, stripped-down military helicopter was
toppled from a pole where it was on display, she added. </p>
<p>“I stepped out on my porch and I could hear it roar,” she said of the
storm. </p>
<p>Although somewhat uncommon for the season, weather officials say even
December can bring severe weather under the right circumstances, as warm
temperatures from the Gulf of Mexico combine with a cold front. </p>
<p>“You can still have the right ingredients that lead to these severe
events even in the dead of winter in the Deep South,” said Peter
Mullinax, a meteorologist with the National Weather Services’ Weather
Prediction Center. </p>
<p>Still, it’s rare for a system to start in Texas and make its way all
the way to the Atlantic Coast this time of year, Wiley said. </p>
<p>Power outages in Pennsylvania</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in western Pennsylvania, high winds overnight Sunday
caused power outages early Monday, most of them in Pittsburgh and other
parts of Allegheny County. Wind speeds of more than 97 kilometers per
hour were reported in Pennsylvania as high winds also blew across Ohio
and northern West Virginia. </p>
<p>AccuWeather meteorologist Alex DaSilva in State College,
Pennsylvania, said a strengthening low-pressure system ushered in the
winds that downed trees and utility poles Sunday evening and into the
night. Some 60,000 Pennsylvania utility customers were without power
Monday morning. That number had dropped to about 13,000 by Monday
afternoon, according to PowerOutage.us.</p>

<h2 id="us-repatriates-tunisian-detainee-from-guantanamo-bay">US
repatriates Tunisian detainee from Guantanamo Bay</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The United States announced late Monday the repatriation of a
Tunisian man who had been held at the U.S. military detention facility
at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba since 2002. </p>
<p>Ridah Bin Saleh al-Yazidi was one of the first to be held at the
facility, which at one point housed hundreds of detainees following the
September 11, 2001, al-Qaida terror attacks on the United States. </p>
<p>Yazidi was captured by Pakistani authorities in late 2001. He was
among a group of about 30 fighters who had crossed the border from
Afghanistan’s Tora Bora region, according to Pentagon files. </p>
<p>The Pentagon assessment said most of the group was identified as
al-Qaida operatives or bodyguards of al-Qaida leader Osama bin
Laden. </p>
<p>Yazidi was never charged with a crime and cleared for transfer from
Guantanamo in 2009, but there was no agreement in place for him to be
sent to Tunisia or another country. </p>
<p>The Pentagon said Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told Congress in
January 2024 that officials had “completed the requirements for
responsible transfer” in consultation with Tunisia. </p>
<p>The repatriation leaves 26 detainees at Guantanamo, of whom 14 have
been cleared for transfer.  </p>

and Reuters</p>

<h2 id="influential-people-who-died-in-2024">Influential people who died
in 2024</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>It was a life that took him from peanut farming to the presidency.
While former President Jimmy Carter ’s time in the White House lasted
only one term, the decades afterward were defined by humanitarian work
that affected people all around the world.</p>
<p>Founding the Carter Center with his wife, Rosalynn, he became a
global champion for democracy, human rights and public health. And he
still took time to teach Sunday school at Maranatha Baptist Church in
Georgia.</p>
<p>Carter was the nation’s longest-lived president when he died Sunday
at age 100.</p>
<p>But he was just one of many noteworthy people who died in 2024.</p>
<p>Alexey Navalny, who died in prison in February, was a fierce
political foe of Russian President Vladimir Putin, crusading against
corruption and staging protests against the Kremlin. He had been jailed
since 2021 when he returned to Russia to face certain arrest after
recovering in Germany from nerve agent poisoning he blamed on the
Kremlin.</p>
<p>Other political figures who died this year include: Iranian President
Ebrahim Raisi; former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney; former
Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh; Vietnamese politician Nguyen Phu
Trong; U.S. Representative Sheila Jackson Lee; former Soviet Prime
Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov; pundit Lou Dobbs; Greek politician Vasso
Papandreou; former U.S. Senators Joe Lieberman, Jim Inhofe, Tim Johnson
and Jim Sasser; Namibian President Hage Geingob; and former Lebanese
Prime Minister Salim Hoss.</p>
<p>The year also brought the deaths of several rights activists,
including the Reverends Cecil L. “Chip” Murray and James Lawson Jr.;
Dexter Scott King; Hydeia Broadbent; and David Mixner.</p>
<p>Business leaders who died this year include Indian industrialist
Ratan Tata; Home Depot co-founder Bernard “Bernie” Marcus; financier
Jacob Rothschild; and Daiso retail chain founder Hirotake Yano.</p>
<p>O.J. Simpson’s “trial of the century” over the 1994 killings of his
ex-wife and her friend exposed divisions over race and law enforcement
and brought an intersection of sports, crime, entertainment and class
that was hard to turn away from. His death in April ended a life that
had become defined by scrutiny of the killings.</p>
<p>Other noteworthy sports figures who died include basketball players
Jerry West and Dikembe Mutombo; baseball players Willie Mays and
Fernando Valenzuela; and gymnastics coach Bela Karolyi.</p>
<p>The music industry lost a titan in producer Quincy Jones, who died in
November. His many contributions included producing Michael Jackson’s
“Thriller” album and working with hundreds of other musicians over a
long and storied career.</p>
<p>Other artists and entertainers who died this year include: actors
James Earl Jones, Chita Rivera, Donald Sutherland, Gena Rowlands, Louis
Gossett Jr., Shelley Duvall, Kris Kristofferson, Linda Lavin, Sandra
Milo, Anouk Aimee, Carl Weathers, Joyce Randolph, Maggie Smith, Tony
Todd, Shannen Doherty and Song Jae-lim; musicians Sergio Mendes, Toby
Keith, Phil Lesh, Melanie, Dickey Betts, Françoise Hardy, Fatman Scoop,
Duane Eddy and Frankie Beverly; filmmakers Roger Corman and Morgan
Spurlock; authors Faith Ringgold, Nikki Giovanni and N. Scott Momaday;
TV fitness guru Richard Simmons; sex therapist Dr. Ruth Westheimer; talk
show host Phil Donahue; and poets Shuntaro Tanikawa, John Sinclair and
Kazuko Shiraishi.</p>

id="jimmy-carter-made-eradicating-guinea-worm-disease-his-mission">Jimmy
Carter made eradicating Guinea worm disease his mission</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>JARWENG, SOUTH SUDAN — Nobel Prize-winning peacemaker Jimmy Carter
spent nearly four decades waging war to eliminate an ancient parasite
plaguing the world’s poorest people.</p>
<p>Rarely fatal but searingly painful and debilitating, Guinea worm
disease infects people who drink water tainted with larvae that grow
inside the body into worms up to 3 feet long. The noodle-thin parasites
then burrow their way out, breaking through the skin in burning
blisters.</p>
<p>Carter made eradicating Guinea worm a top mission of The Carter
Center, the nonprofit he and his wife, Rosalynn Carter, founded after
leaving the White House. The former president rallied public health
experts, billionaire donors, African heads of state and thousands of
volunteer villagers to work toward eliminating a human disease for only
the second time in history.</p>
<p>“It’d be the most exciting and gratifying accomplishment of my life,”
Carter told The Associated Press in 2016. Even after entering home
hospice care in February 2023, aides said Carter kept asking for Guinea
worm updates.</p>
<p>Carter died Sunday at age 100.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Carters’ efforts, the worms that afflicted an estimated
3.5 million people in 20 African and Asian countries when the center
launched its campaign in 1986 are on the brink of extinction. Only 14
human cases were reported across four African nations in 2023, according
to The Carter Center.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization’s target for eradication is 2030.
Carter Center leaders hope to achieve it sooner.</p>
<p>That meant recently returning to Jarweng, in a remote area of South
Sudan in northeastern Africa. The village of 500 people hadn’t seen
Guinea worm infections since 2014 until Nyingong Aguek and her two sons
drank swampy water while traveling in 2022. A fourth person also got
infected.</p>
<p>“Having the worm pulled out is more painful than giving birth,” said
Aguek, pointing to scars where four worms emerged from her left leg.</p>
<p>The center’s staff and volunteers walked house to house distributing
water filters and teaching people to inspect dogs, which can also carry
the parasite.</p>
<p>“If someone’s hurt, The Carter Center will help,” said villager
Mathew Manyiel, listening to a training session while checking his dog
for symptoms.</p>
<p>An audacious plan</p>
<p>In the mid-1980s, global health agencies were otherwise occupied, and
heads of state largely overlooked the illness afflicting millions of
their citizens. Carter was still defining the center’s mission when
public health experts who had served in his administration approached
him with a plan to eliminate the disease.</p>
<p>Only a few years had passed since the WHO declared in 1979 that
smallpox was the first human disease to be eradicated worldwide. Guinea
worm, the experts told Carter, could become the second.</p>
<p>“President Carter, with a political background, was able to do far
more in global health than we could do alone,” said Dr. William Foege,
who led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control’s smallpox eradication
program and the CDC itself before becoming The Carter Center’s first
executive director.</p>
<p>Those who worked closely with Carter suspect Guinea worm’s toll on
poor African farmers resonated with the former president, who lived as a
boy in a Georgia farmhouse without electricity or running water.</p>
<p>“Nobody was doing anything about it, and it was such a spectacularly
awful disease,” said Dr. Donald Hopkins, an architect of the campaign
who led the center’s health programs until 2015. “He could sympathize
with all of these farmers being too crippled from Guinea worm disease to
work.”</p>
<p>Changing behaviors</p>
<p>There’s no vaccine that prevents Guinea worm infections or medicine
that gets rid of the parasites. Treatment has changed little since
ancient Greece. Emerging worms are gently wound around a stick as
they’re slowly pulled through the skin. Removing an entire worm without
breaking it can take weeks.</p>
<p>So instead of scientific breakthroughs, this campaign has relied on
persuading millions of people to change basic behaviors.</p>
<p>Workers from the center and host governments trained volunteers to
teach neighbors to filter water through cloth screens, removing tiny
fleas that carry the larvae. Villagers learned to watch for and report
new cases — often for rewards of $100 or more. Infected people and dogs
had to be prevented from tainting water sources.</p>
<p>The goal was to break the worm’s life cycle — and therefore eliminate
the parasite itself — in each endemic community, eventually
exterminating Guinea worm altogether.</p>
<p>The campaign became a model for confronting a broader range of
neglected tropical diseases afflicting impoverished people with limited
access to clean water, sanitation and health care. Expanding its public
health mission, the center has supplied training, equipment and
medicines that helped 22 countries eliminate at least one disease within
their borders.</p>
<p>Mali became the latest in May 2023 when the WHO confirmed it had
ended trachoma, a blinding eye infection. Haiti and the Dominican
Republic are working to eliminate malaria and mosquito-borne lymphatic
filariasis by 2030. Countries in Africa and the Americas are pursuing an
end to river blindness by 2035.</p>
<p>A personal mission</p>
<p>Having a former U.S. president lead the charge brought big advantages
to a nonprofit that relied on private donors to fund its
initiatives.</p>
<p>Carter’s fundraising enabled the center to pour $500 million into
fighting Guinea worm. He persuaded manufacturers to donate larvicide as
well as nylon cloth and specially made drinking straws to filter water.
His visits to afflicted villages often attracted news coverage, raising
awareness globally.</p>
<p>“He went to so many of the localities where people were afflicted,”
said Dr. William Brieger, a professor of international health at Johns
Hopkins University who spent 25 years in Africa. “The kind of attention
that was drawn to him for getting on the ground and highlighting the
plight of individual people who were suffering, I think that made an
important difference.”</p>
<p>Carter first saw the disease up close in 1988 while visiting a
village in Ghana where nearly 350 people had worms poking through their
skin. He approached a young woman who appeared to be cradling a baby in
her arm.</p>
<p>“But there was no baby,” Carter wrote in his 2014 book “A Call to
Action.” “Instead, she was holding her right breast, which was almost a
foot long and had a worm emerging from the nipple.”</p>
<p>Carter used his status to sway other leaders to play larger roles.
Some heads of state got competitive, spurred by the center’s charts and
newsletters that showed which countries were making progress and which
lagged behind.</p>
<p>Worms in a war zone</p>
<p>In 1995, Carter intervened when a civil war in southern Sudan made it
too dangerous for workers to reach hundreds of hotspots. The ceasefire
he negotiated enabled the center and others to distribute 200,000 water
filters and discover more endemic villages.</p>
<p>Carter’s efforts not only stopped transmissions in much of what
became South Sudan but also built trust across communities that resulted
in a “significant peace dividend,” said Makoy Samuel Yibi, the young
nation’s Guinea worm eradication director.</p>
<p>Pakistan in 1993 became the first endemic country to eliminate human
cases. India soon followed. By 1997, the disease was no longer found in
Asia. By 2003, cases reported worldwide were down to 32,000 — a 99%
decline in less than two decades.</p>
<p>Some setbacks frustrated Carter. Visiting a hospital packed with
suffering children and adults amid a 2007 resurgence in Ghana, Carter
suggested publicly that the disease should perhaps be renamed “Ghana
worm.”</p>
<p>“Ghana was deeply embarrassed,” Hopkins said.</p>
<p>Ghana ended transmission within three more years. Even more
inspiring: Nigeria, which once had the most cases in the world, reached
zero infections in 2009.</p>
<p>“That was a thunderclap,” Hopkins said. “It was important throughout
Africa, throughout the global campaign.”</p>
<p>To the last worm</p>
<p>Even after being diagnosed with brain cancer, Carter remained
focused: “I’d like the last Guinea worm to die before I do,” he told
reporters in 2015.</p>
<p>Despite dwindling cases, total success has proven elusive.</p>
<p>Historic flooding and years of civil war have displaced millions of
people who lack clean drinking water across central Africa. Of the 13
total cases reported in 2023, nine occurred in Chad, where infections in
dogs have made the worms harder to eliminate.</p>
<p>“These are the most challenging places on planet Earth to operate
in,” said Adam Weiss, who has directed the campaign since 2018. “You
need eyes and ears on the ground every single day.”</p>
<p>The campaign still relies on about 30,000 volunteers spread among
roughly 9,000 villages. Staying vigilant can be difficult now that cases
are so rare, Weiss said.</p>
<p>“I would still like to think we will beat the timeline,” Weiss said
of the 2030 eradication goal. “The Carter Center is committed to this,
obviously, no matter what.”</p>

denies sentencing delay for former US Senator Bob Menendez</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Former U.S. Senator Bob Menendez, a Democrat from New
Jersey, will be sentenced on corruption charges as scheduled at the end
of January, and his wife’s trial will be moved from January to February,
a judge said Monday. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Sidney H. Stein in Manhattan rejected Menendez’s
request to delay his sentencing for his conviction on bribery and other
charges until his wife finishes her trial on similar charges, possibly
sometime in March. </p>
<p>The Democrat’s lawyers last week requested a new sentencing date on
the grounds that the jury chosen to hear the case against his wife,
Nadine Menendez, would be tainted if jurors heard about the outcome of
the former senator’s sentencing during the trial. </p>
<p>Menendez, 70, was convicted in July of 16 corruption charges brought
by prosecutors who asserted that he used his power in the Senate over a
five-year stretch through 2022 to do favors that benefitted three New
Jersey businessmen who paid him with gold bars, hundreds of thousands of
dollars in cash, and a Mercedes-Benz convertible. </p>
<p>Two of the businessmen were convicted along with Menendez while a
third pleaded guilty, cooperated with the government, and testified
against him. </p>
<p>Nadine Menendez has pleaded not guilty to the charges. Originally set
to stand trial with her husband, her trial was put off after a breast
cancer diagnosis led to surgery. Stein on Monday moved her January 21
trial to February 5. Her husband, as scheduled, will be sentenced on
January 29.</p>

Square ball takes final test for New Year’s Eve</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — The crystal-covered ball that descends down a pole in
Times Square to ring in the new year was taken for a test run Monday, as
New York City officials laid out their plans for the iconic New Year’s
Eve event. </p>
<p>Officials flipped a switch to light up the dazzling geodesic sphere —
weighing almost 6 tons (5.4 metric tons) and featuring 2,688 crystal
triangles — which then successfully ran up and down a 139-foot
(42-meter) pole atop the One Times Square skyscraper. </p>
<p>Monday’s rehearsal was just one of many pre-ball drop promotional
events: On Sunday, fistfuls of confetti were flung toward crowds in the
square in anticipation of the 3,000 pounds (1,360 kilograms) of brightly
colored paper that will fill the air at midnight on New Year’s Eve. Some
of those pieces will include wishes written by people ahead of
2025. </p>
<p>“This is the crossroads of the entire planet right here in New York
City,” New York City Mayor Eric Adams said earlier Monday as he and law
enforcement leaders discussed their plans for security at the
celebration. “People tune in at different locations and celebrate as we
do the countdown for the New Year.” </p>
<p>Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said that although there were “no
specific credible threats” to the Times Square celebrations, “the public
can expect to see a tremendous amount of police resources deployed
throughout the area and across the city.” Plans range from “dedicated
pickpocket teams” patrolling the square to sealing off all mailboxes and
vending machines in the area. </p>
<p>A New Year’s Eve ball has dropped in Times Square for nearly 120
years, with the exception of 1942 and 1943 when nightly “dimouts”
occurred during World War II to protect the city from attacks.</p>

<h2
id="california-to-require-insurers-to-boost-home-coverage-in-wildfire-prone-areas">California
to require insurers to boost home coverage in wildfire-prone areas</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SACRAMENTO, California — Insurance companies that stopped providing
home coverage to hundreds of thousands of Californians in recent years
as wildfires became more destructive will have to again provide policies
in fire-prone areas if they want to keep doing business in California
under a state regulation announced Monday. </p>
<p>The rule will require home insurers to offer coverage in high-risk
areas, something the state has never done, Insurance Commissioner
Ricardo Lara’s office said in a statement. Insurers will have to start
increasing their coverage by 5% every two years until they hit the
equivalent of 85% of their market share. That means if an insurer writes
20 out of every 100 state policies, it would need to write 17 in a
high-risk area, Lara’s office said. </p>
<p>Major insurers like State Farm and Allstate have stopped writing new
policies in California because of fears of massive losses from wildfires
and other natural disasters. </p>
<p>In exchange for increasing coverage, the state will let insurance
companies pass on the costs of reinsurance to California consumers.
Insurance companies typically buy reinsurance to avoid huge payouts in
case of natural disasters or catastrophic loss. California is the only
state that doesn’t already allow the cost of reinsurance to be borne by
policyholders, according to Lara’s office. </p>
<p>Opponents of the rule say that could hike premiums by 40% and doesn’t
require new policies to be written at a fast enough pace. The state did
not provide a cost analysis for potential impact on consumers. </p>
<p>“This plan is of the insurance industry, by the insurance industry,
and for the industry,” Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog, said
in a statement. </p>
<p>The requirement is under review by the Office of Administrative Law
before it takes effect within 30 days. </p>
<p>“Californians deserve a reliable insurance market that doesn’t
retreat from communities most vulnerable to wildfires and climate
change,” Lara said in a statement. “This is a historic moment for
California.” </p>
<p>Earlier rule</p>
<p>The new rule is part of Lara’s effort to persuade insurers to
continue doing business in the nation’s most populous state. He unveiled
another rule earlier this month to let insurers consider climate change
when setting their prices. Insurance companies had said that because
they couldn’t consider climate change in their rates, many chose to
either pause or restrict new business in the state. The new rule to
include climate change in rates will take effect later this week. </p>
<p>The ultimate goal of the new rules is to get homeowners out of the
California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements (FAIR) Plan, which
often serves as the last resort when insurance companies stop providing
coverage for those living in areas threatened by wildfires, Lara’s
office said. The plan could help a homeowner fulfill insurance
requirements imposed by mortgage companies, but it is mainly designed as
a temporary safety net with basic coverage until policyholders find a
more permanent option. The number of people on California’s FAIR plan
more than doubled between 2020 and this year, reaching nearly 452,000
policies. </p>
<p>Wildfires have always been part of life in California, where it rains
for only a few months out of the year. But as the climate has gotten
hotter and dryer, it has made those fires much larger and more intense.
Of the top 20 most destructive wildfires in state history, 14 have
occurred since 2015, according to the California Department of Forestry
and Fire Protection. </p>
<p>The 2018 fire in Paradise, California, killed 85 people and destroyed
about 11,000 homes, and some residents have struggled to find home
insurance since. </p>
<p>Steve Crowder, the town’s mayor, lost his house and business. Since
then, his family has rebuilt their home but struggled to find insurance.
The Crowders were forced to enroll in FAIR Plan earlier this month.
Despite paying roughly $5,000, the mayor said his home is insured for
roughly $100,000 less than its value and the house’s contents are only
half-covered. </p>
<p>“You couldn’t rebuild what you got for what it’s insured for,” he
said. </p>
<p>His constituents face similar problems. With policies skyrocketing
from roughly $1,200 annually before the Camp Fire to $5,000 now — or
even up to $20,000 a year for large homes — some have abandoned attempts
to find coverage. </p>
<p>In the years after the Camp Fire, Crowder said the town has
successfully brought back some insurers after enacting new ordinances
with high standards to keep structures safe, such as rules regarding
clearances, vegetation and fences. </p>
<p>While the mayor welcomed the state’s new rules, he said he and his
constituents are skeptical things will improve. </p>
<p>“Anything that will help get insurance in California, period, is
helpful,” he said, but added: “Let’s wait and make sure it happens
before we get excited.”</p>

id="december-border-arrests-remain-down-ending-bidens-term-at-lowest-level">December
border arrests remain down, ending Biden’s term at lowest level</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SAN DIEGO — Arrests for illegally crossing the border from Mexico in
December are little changed from a month earlier, a U.S. official said
Monday, hovering near the lowest levels since July 2020 and indicating
that an anticipated surge ahead of Donald Trump’s inauguration as
president hasn’t happened. </p>
<p>There were about 44,000 arrests during December as of Monday morning,
suggesting the month will end close to the 46,612 arrests made in
November, according to a senior U.S. Customs and Border Protection
official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the count is
preliminary and has not been made public. </p>
<p>December will mark the sixth straight month that arrests for illegal
crossings were less than the monthly average in 2019, the official said.
It also signals that the final full month of President Joe Biden’s
presidency will be at or near the lowest during his four years in
office. </p>
<p>Asked to comment on the latest numbers, the Homeland Security
Department released a statement by Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, that
said “swift and effective implementation” of asylum restrictions in June
resulted in another month below the 2019 average. </p>
<p>“This sustained success is the result of strong border enforcement,
extensive engagement with our foreign partners, and the delivery of safe
and lawful pathways that continue to provide humanitarian relief under
our laws,” Mayorkas said. </p>
<p>Arrests fell by about half from an all-time high of 250,000 in
December 2023 after Mexican officials increased enforcement within their
own borders and by about half again after Biden introduced severe asylum
limits. </p>
<p>Texas’ Rio Grande Valley was the second-busiest corridor for illegal
crossings in December, up from fifth in November, likely a reflection of
tactical decisions by smuggling organizations and Mexican law
enforcement, the official said. San Diego remained the busiest corridor
for illegal crossings. El Paso, Texas, was third and Tucson, Arizona,
was fourth. </p>
<p>For the second straight month, those allowed to enter the country
through official border crossings are expected to exceed arrests for
illegal crossings, reflecting the Biden administration’s approach to
create and expand legal pathways while severely restricting asylum for
those who cross the border illegally. Most legal entries are done
through an online appointment system called CBP One, which grants 1,450
slots a day. </p>
<p>Trump has focused on launching mass deportations after taking office
Jan. 20 but he and his aides have also emphasized border measures,
touting a possible return of a policy to make asylum-seekers wait in
Mexico for court hearings in U.S. immigration courts. Trump said in
September that he planned to end CBP One appointments.</p>

<h2 id="in-carters-hometown-a-long-anticipated-goodbye-begins">In
Carter’s hometown, a long-anticipated goodbye begins</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PLAINS, GEORGIA — In Jimmy Carter’s tiny hometown of Plains, Georgia
on Monday, the former U.S. president’s death was only beginning to sink
in, even if friends and neighbors have been bracing for it since he went
into hospice care nearly two years ago.</p>
<p>Those in the rural hamlet — a half block of buildings nestled in the
shadow of massive agricultural silos — said the centenarian’s death was
sad, but in the same breath they recounted fond memories of time spent
with the former U.S. leader and global humanitarian.</p>
<p>Carter’s commitment to Plains, where he was born 100 years ago and
died Sunday at the modest home he had shared with his wife Rosalynn, is
made clear by its residents — most knew him personally or have a family
member who did.</p>
<p>“It’ll always be Jimmy Carter’s hometown,” Kelly Kight, who was born
and raised in Plains, population approximately 600, told AFP as she
placed commemorative bows near her flower shop on the main strip.</p>
<p>She said that more than an occasion for mourning, it was a day for
remembrance of the Nobel Peace Prize laureate and his humanitarian work
in particular.</p>
<p>Electric leaf blowers and tree trimmers provided a background chorus
for the town, accustomed to gussying up quickly since it was first
thrust into the national spotlight as Carter ran for president nearly 50
years ago and most recently when he began hospice care.</p>
<p>“When he entered hospice, it kind of became a waiting game for all of
the hometown people here in the community,” said Kight, whose family
owned a peanut warehouse across from the Carter’s and whose father grew
up alongside the Carter children.</p>
<p>Carter, who had an unlikely political ascent from peanut farmer to
the Oval Office, is almost omnipresent in Plains — his boyhood home,
high school and the former train depot which served as his 1976
presidential campaign headquarters are now museums under the National
Park Service.</p>
<p>The town’s main drag is festooned with an enormous banner heralding
Carter as the 39th president, while a goofy peanut statue with Carter’s
trademark grin sits near his church, Maranatha Baptist. There, he
welcomed visitors from around the world as he taught Sunday school into
his 90s.</p>
<p>‘A very fine gentleman’</p>
<p>Carter’s death has long been anticipated — he was last seen in public
looking very frail at his wife’s funeral in November 2023, after 77
years of marriage.</p>
<p>His funeral schedule will include a stop at his boyhood farm, before
his remains are taken onward to Atlanta and Washington, then returned to
his hometown for interment.</p>
<p>Kimberly Franklin, who also grew up in Plains, was leaving the Dollar
General grocery store Monday, where she would sometimes encounter the
Carters shopping like everyday people.</p>
<p>“I am very sad,” the residential nurse, 56, told AFP, adding that
Carter was just “an awesome guy.”</p>
<p>Like most in Plains, she had a deeply personal memory of Carter, a
profoundly religious Baptist who attended her baptism.</p>
<p>Several blocks away, Plains resident Johnny Jones sat in a rocking
chair on his porch, across from the high school Carter attended and in
clear view of downtown. He was waiting for the bustle to begin.</p>
<p>Jones watched as the town came to a standstill for Rosalynn Carter’s
funeral and as swarms of journalists descended on Plains when Jimmy
Carter announced his hospice care. Jones recounted with a twinkle in his
eye that the media waited two weeks for Carter to die, then turned
around and left.</p>
<p>“I thought he was a very fine gentleman,” said Jones, an 85-year-old
military retiree who liked Carter. “He did a lot for Plains.”</p>

Treasury: Chinese hackers remotely accessed workstations, documents</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Chinese hackers remotely accessed several U.S. Treasury
Department workstations and unclassified documents after compromising a
third-party software service provider, the agency said Monday. </p>
<p>The department did not provide details on how many workstations had
been accessed or what sort of documents the hackers may have obtained,
but it said in a letter to lawmakers revealing the breach that “at this
time there is no evidence indicating the threat actor has continued
access to Treasury information.” </p>
<p>“Treasury takes very seriously all threats against our systems, and
the data it holds,” the department said. “Over the last four years,
Treasury has significantly bolstered its cyber defense, and we will
continue to work with both private and public sector partners to protect
our financial system from threat actors.” </p>
<p>The department said it learned of the problem on Dec. 8 when a
third-party software service provider, BeyondTrust, flagged that hackers
had stolen a key used by the vendor that helped it override the system
and gain remote access to several employee workstations. </p>
<p>The compromised service has since been taken offline, and there’s no
evidence that the hackers still have access to department information,
Aditi Hardikar, an assistant Treasury secretary, said in the letter
Monday to leaders of the Senate Banking Committee. </p>
<p>The department said it was working with the FBI and the Cybersecurity
and Infrastructure Security Agency, and that the hack had been
attributed to Chinese culprits. It did not elaborate.</p>

agency takes steps to protect Nevada mountains from energy
development</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The Biden administration on Monday took steps to protect the Ruby
Mountains in northeast Nevada from oil, gas and geothermal development
for 20 years.</p>
<p>The Interior Department said it had approved an application by the
U.S. Forest Service to withdraw 264,442 acres of federal lands in the
Ruby Mountains from mineral and geothermal leasing.</p>
<p>The application’s approval removes the lands from development for up
to two years and kicks off a 90-day period for the public to comment on
the proposed 20-year withdrawal.</p>
<p>The proposal comes three weeks before President-elect Donald Trump,
who has vowed to step up domestic oil and gas production, succeeds
President Joe Biden, a Democrat who has sought to conserve large amounts
of public land.</p>
<p>The lands would remain open to mining claims, the Interior Department
said.</p>
<p>“The Ruby Mountains are cherished by local communities for their
scenic value, cultural heritage, numerous wildlife and benefit to the
local economy through a thriving outdoor recreation industry,” Interior
Secretary Deb Haaland said in a statement. “Today, we are taking an
important and sensible step to pause new oil and gas leasing to ensure
that we have the science and public input necessary to inform proposed
protections of the Ruby Mountains area for future generations.”</p>

Mandarin: Outlook for US-China relations in the New Year</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>As former President Donald Trump is set to return to the White House,
Reuters reported on Dec. 24 that China will issue a record 3 trillion
yuan in government bonds next year in an effort to rescue its
crisis-stricken economy and mitigate the impact of potential significant
tariff hikes by Trump.  </p>
<p>This marks the latest sign of China’s concern that bilateral
relations may quickly plunge to a new low during Trump’s second term.
For a long time, a basic assumption about U.S.-China relations has been
that even when relations deteriorate, they won’t fall too far. Looking
ahead to the new year, Trump is set to bring an unusually hard-line,
hawkish team on China into the White House.   </p>

<h2 id="biden-declares-january-9-a-day-of-mourning-for-carter">Biden
declares January 9 a day of mourning for Carter</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — President Joe Biden has declared January 9 a national
day of mourning for former President Jimmy Carter and announced Monday
that all federal government offices would be closed that day as a show
of respect for the 39th U.S. president, who died Sunday at age 100.</p>
<p>“I call on the American people to assemble on that day in their
respective places of worship, there to pay homage to the memory of
President James Earl Carter Jr.,” Biden said in a formal declaration
issued late Sunday. “I invite the people of the world who share our
grief to join us in this solemn observance.”</p>
<p>The solemn event January 9 in the nation’s capital will draw all the
living American presidents and a host of dignitaries. Biden also ordered
the U.S. flag to be flown at half-staff for 30 days from the date of
Carter’s death at public buildings, military posts and U.S. government
buildings overseas.</p>
<p>Events begin Saturday</p>
<p>Biden has bestowed upon Carter a state funeral, a three-stage
multiday event coordinated by the U.S. military that includes
observances in the capital and ceremonies in the home state of the
deceased. Carter has repeatedly expressed his wish to be buried in his
front yard in the small town of Plains, Georgia, beside his wife of 77
years, Rosalynn. She died in 2023. Carter was in hospice care for two
years before his own death at 100 made him the longest-living former
president in U.S. history.</p>
<p>Observances for this peanut-farmer-turned-president will stretch over
several days and involve coordination by local, state and national law
enforcement, the military and the countless elected officials and
members of the public expected to pay their respects.</p>
<p>It begins Saturday, in Georgia. Members of Carter’s Secret Service
detail will accompany his hearse as it travels in a motorcade through
Plains. The motorcade will pass his family’s farm, where members of the
National Park Service will ring the farm bell 39 times to symbolize his
status as the 39th president. The motorcade will proceed to the state
Capitol, in Atlanta, where it will be greeted by the governor, the
city’s mayor, members of the state Legislature and state troopers.</p>
<p>Carter’s remains will then be taken to the Carter Presidential Center
for an afternoon service. He will lie in repose through Tuesday, January
7.</p>
<p>On that day, the president’s surviving family will accompany his
remains as they travel on a special Air Force plane to Washington. In
Washington, the former naval officer’s remains will be taken by hearse
motorcade to the U.S. Navy Memorial. A horse-drawn ceremonial procession
will complete his trip from there to the U.S. Capitol, where military
body bearers will carry him into the heart of the building, the rotunda.
Members of Congress will hold an afternoon service, and his body will
lie in state there, with a military guard of honor, until the morning of
January 9.</p>
<p>The Washington National Cathedral will hold the national funeral
service at 10 a.m. That structure has played host to several previous
state funerals, including those of former Presidents Ronald Reagan,
Gerald Ford and George H.W. Bush.</p>
<p>Carter’s funeral is likely to be attended by all five living American
presidents — a list that includes George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, Barack
Obama, former and future President Donald Trump, and Biden. Biden, at
82, is now the eldest statesman of that group.</p>
<p>Biden inadvertently revealed, in March last year at a national
Democratic Party event, that Carter, also a Democrat, had asked him to
deliver his eulogy.</p>
<p>In his statement late Sunday, Biden described Carter as “a man of
character, courage and compassion, whose lifetime of service defined him
as one of the most influential statesmen in our history.”</p>
<p>He continued: “He embodied the very best of America: A humble servant
of God and the people. A heroic champion of global peace and human
rights, and an honorable leader whose moral clarity and hopeful vision
lifted our nation and changed our world.”</p>
<p>The end, with Rosalynn</p>
<p>Carter’s final voyage happens in Georgia, on the afternoon of January
9. His family will hold a private service at the Carters’ home church,
Maranatha Baptist Church.</p>
<p>And then the motorcade will wind its way back along those familiar
roads, to Plains, and to the low-slung home the Carters built, where
they raised their children, and where they settled after the White
House. The U.S. Navy will perform a missing-man formation flyover right
before Carter is lowered into his final resting place, next to
Rosalynn.</p>

id="jimmy-carters-passing-met-with-mixed-reactions-in-china-taiwan">Jimmy
Carter’s passing met with mixed reactions in China, Taiwan</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Taipei, Taiwan — The passing of former United States President Jimmy
Carter was met with mixed reactions in China and Taiwan. Chinese
President Xi Jinping praised him for helping to establish diplomatic
ties between Beijing and Washington while some in Taiwan remain critical
of his decision to sever official ties with the island to this day.</p>
<p>In a message to U.S. President Joe Biden, Xi expressed his “deep
condolences” and described Carter as “the driving force behind the
establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United
States.” </p>
<p>Former President Carter “made important contributions to the
development of China-U.S. relations and the friendly exchanges and
cooperation between the two countries,” China’s state-run broadcaster
CCTV cited Xi as saying.</p>
<p>“China-U.S. ties are among the most import bilateral relationships in
the world,” Xi said, adding that Beijing is willing to work with
Washington to advance bilateral relations. </p>
<p>During Carter’s time in office between 1977 and 1981, the U.S.
established formal diplomatic relations with China, advancing the
groundwork laid by former U.S. President Richard Nixon and Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger in the 1970s. </p>
<p>In 1979, his administration recognized the People’s Republic of China
(PRC) as the sole legal government of China and acknowledged Beijing’s
position that Taiwan is a part of China. He also agreed to sever
official ties with Taiwan, charting a new course in what would later
become one of the world’s most complicated and consequential
relationships. </p>
<p>Much like Xi, many Chinese commentators and internet users praised
Carter’s contribution to normalizing U.S.-China relations. </p>
<p>Hu Xijin, the former editor-in-chief of China’s state-run tabloid
Global Times, said Carter helped to lay the foundation of the “friendly
and cooperative relationship” between China and the U.S. by
acknowledging China’s position on Taiwan.</p>
<p>While “his starting point is to safeguard the interests of the United
States, during his term, China and the United States of America’s common
interests have been highlighted and highlighted,” he wrote in a
statement on the Chinese social media platform Weibo. </p>
<p>Other Chinese internet users also characterized Carter as being more
friendly to China than other U.S. leaders. “Of all the living former
U.S. presidents, he is one of the friendlier to China,” Chinese netizen
“Sheng Yuan Ran Dong” from Heilongjiang province wrote on Weibo.</p>
<p>“He was a good pacifist. He opened the floodgates of history by
establishing diplomatic relations between China and the U.S. His good
qualities are truly worth highlighting,” Chinese internet user “Abu from
the magic forest” from Jiangxi Province wrote on Weibo.</p>
<p>Lu Chao, the director of Liaoning University’s Institute of American
and East Asian Studies, said Carter not only facilitated the
establishment of U.S.-China relations, he also maintained very good
relations with then-Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping. </p>
<p>“Former President Carter made the right choice that was in line with
the trend of global development, the fundamental interests of the United
States, and the interests of China. It is still praised by Chinese and
American people,” he told VOA. </p>
<p>Mixed reactions in Taiwan </p>
<p>While reactions from China to Carter’s passing were largely positive,
perceptions about the former U.S. president’s complicated legacy in
Taiwan were mixed. In a short post on social media platform X, Taiwan’s
Presidential Office extended “sincere condolences” to Carter’s family
and the American people.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Taiwan’s main opposition party Kuomintang (KMT), said on X
that while Carter will be remembered in Taiwan “for his decision to
derecognize the Republic of China” — Taiwan’s official name — they
“admire his advocacy worldwide for affordable housing, conflict
resolution, refugees, and other causes.”</p>
<p>In contrast to the moderate official response, some Taiwanese
internet users criticized the former U.S. president for allowing China
to become a major threat to Taiwan. </p>
<p>While “the U.S. is now Taiwan’s strong ally, [Carter and Kissinger]
are the ones who made China so difficult to deal with. From the two of
them to the Obama era, Washington’s pro-China approach allowed China to
build economic growth for decades and that’s the reason why the Chinese
Communist Party can keep bullying Taiwan,” Taiwanese internet user
Pbtato Hsieh wrote in a Facebook post. </p>
<p>After the Carter administration severed ties with Taiwan in 1979, the
U.S. Congress passed the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA), later the same
year, which allows Washington to maintain close unofficial ties with
Taipei while requiring the U.S. to “provide Taiwan with arms of a
defensive character” to “a sufficient self-defense capacity.”</p>
<p>The TRA also reaffirmed the United States commitment to preserving
the human rights of the people of Taiwan. At the time the legislation
was signed into law by then President Carter, Taiwan was under martial
law and under the control of one single party, the KMT, which was led by
Chiang Ching-kuo. Taiwan continued under martial law until 1989 and held
its first direct presidential elections in 1996.</p>
<p>While Carter signed the TRA into law, some Taiwanese analysts say the
former president shouldn’t be credited for providing the architecture
that upholds the unofficial relations between Taiwan and the U.S.
today. </p>
<p>“It was because the government in Taiwan under Chiang Kai-shek and
some grassroots Taiwanese American organizations maintained good
relations with members of the U.S. Congress, so the Congress passed a
piece of legislation that was more favorable toward Taiwan,” Chen
Fang-yu, a political scientist at Soochow University in Taiwan, told VOA
by phone. </p>
<p>“The Taiwan Relations Act was not directly related to Carter,” he
added. </p>
<p>Despite his complicated legacy of handling Washington’s relations
with Taiwan, other experts say Carter’s decision to sign the TRA into
law still helped to build the “first blocks of today’s U.S.-Taiwan
relationship.” </p>
<p>“The de facto relationship that the U.S. and Taiwan have today began
with him,” said Lev Nachman, a political scientist at National Taiwan
University. </p>
<p>“I don’t think he was the one who sat down and wrote the TRA, but he
most certainly is the one who saw through the process of creating this
new relationship with Taiwan after the recognition switch,” he told VOA
by phone. </p>

funeral to be held for former President Jimmy Carter</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Atlanta, GA. — VOA Correspondent Kane Farabaugh conducted numerous
interviews with Jimmy Carter on issues ranging from his time in the
White House to his post-presidential career as a promoter of global
health and democracy. Highlights of those interviews are contained in
this report.</p>
<p>A state funeral will be held January 9 for former U.S. President
Jimmy Carter who died Sunday at the age of 100.</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden scheduled the state funeral for Carter to be
held the same day as National Day of Mourning. Biden has also directed
flags at public buildings to be displayed at half-staff for 30 days in
honor of Carter.</p>
<p>Carter was a peanut farmer and a Georgia state governor before
becoming president. When he took the oath of office as president of the
United States on January 20, 1977, he promised a “government as good as
its people.”</p>
<p>He presided over four turbulent years. Rising inflation and growing
unemployment marred the domestic priorities of his administration. He
scored victories in foreign policy with a peace agreement between Egypt
and Israel and the Panama Canal treaty. However, a hostage crisis in
Iran dominated his final years in the White House and contributed to his
defeat in the 1980 general election.</p>
<p>But Carter liked to say the end of his presidency in 1981 was the
beginning of a new life, traveling the world “fighting disease, building
hope, and waging peace.”</p>
<p>“It has turned out to open up for me and my wife, Rosalynn, a new
arena of excitement and unpredictability and adventure and challenge and
gratification,” he told VOA.</p>
<p>As the head of the Carter Center, the Carters traveled to more than
80 countries monitoring troubled elections, mediating disputes, and
fighting diseases. This active post-White House life eventually led to
the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002.</p>
<p>“I look upon the Carter Center work as an extension of what I tried
to do as president. You know, we brought peace between Israel and Egypt.
We opened up a humongous relationship with Latin America with the Panama
Canal treaty,” he said. “So what I have done since then has been kind of
an extension. But I do not think there is any doubt that when I won the
Nobel Peace Prize, for instance, it was because of the work of the
Carter Center. So, I would be perfectly satisfied to have a legacy based
on peace and human rights. I mean, who would not?”</p>
<p>U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres praised Carter’s “commitment
to international peace and human rights.</p>
<p>“President Carter will be remembered for his solidarity with the
vulnerable, his abiding grace, and his unrelenting faith in the common
good and our common humanity,” Guterres said in a statement. “His legacy
as a peacemaker, human rights champion and humanitarian will
endure.”</p>
<p>The White House released a statement from President Biden and first
lady Jill Biden on Sunday. It said, “Over six decades, we had the honor
of calling Jimmy Carter a dear friend. But, what’s extraordinary about
Jimmy Carter, though, is that millions of people throughout America and
the world who never met him thought of him as a dear friend as
well.”</p>
<p>President-elect Donald Trump posted on Truth Social: “The challenges
Jimmy faced as President came at a pivotal time for our country and he
did everything in his power to improve the lives of all Americans. For
that, we all owe him a debt of gratitude.”</p>
<p>Carter’s journey to the White House began in the small town of
Plains, Georgia, where he was born October 1, 1924.</p>
<p>After serving as an officer in the U.S. Navy, where he helped develop
the post-World War II nuclear submarine fleet, Carter returned to his
hometown in 1953 to run the family peanut-farming business.</p>
<p>He entered politics in the 1960s, serving two terms as a Georgia
legislator before becoming the state’s 76th governor from 1971 to
1975.</p>
<p>In the 1976 presidential election, Carter, a Democrat, ran against
Republican incumbent Gerald Ford, who assumed the presidency after
Richard Nixon resigned in the wake of the Watergate scandal. Carter
narrowly defeated Ford to become president.</p>
<p>The high point of Carter’s presidency came in 1978. Carter brought
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin
to the Camp David presidential retreat in rural Maryland to negotiate a
peace treaty.</p>
<p>“When I became president, there had been four wars between Arabs and
Israelis in the previous 25 years, with the Egyptians in the leadership
supported by the Soviet Union,” he said. “They were the only country
that could really challenge Israel militarily. And we had success in
getting a treaty between Israel and Egypt … not a word of which has ever
been violated.”</p>
<p>Carter also negotiated a treaty turning control of the Panama Canal
over to the Panamanian government and normalized diplomatic relations
with the People’s Republic of China.</p>
<p>But in 1979 the primary focus for Carter’s administration turned to
Iran, where a revolution led by religious clerics toppled the government
of the U.S.-backed shah, who eventually fled to the United States, where
he received treatment for cancer.</p>
<p>On November 4, 1979, militants angry with the U.S. for harboring the
deposed shah stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, taking 66 Americans
hostage; 13 were released weeks later.</p>
<p>Five months into the crisis, in April 1980, Carter authorized a
complex military operation to free the remaining hostages. Dubbed
Operation Eagle Claw, the plan called for several helicopters and
military aircraft to stage at a site in the Iranian desert. Carter, who
approved the plan, explained to VOA that the helicopters carrying
members of the U.S. military’s elite Delta Force were to fly from there
to the U.S. embassy in Tehran, free the hostages and return to the
waiting aircraft that would fly them out of Iran.</p>
<p>“The minimum number of helicopters required would be six very large
helicopters. So I decided to send eight. One of the helicopters, in an
inexplicable way, turned around and went back to the aircraft carrier.
Another one went down in a sandstorm in the Iranian desert. The third
one developed a hydraulic leak and ran into one of the C-130 airplanes,”
he said.</p>
<p>The aborted mission ended in failure. Eight U.S. military members and
one Iranian civilian died as a result of the crash. Walter Mondale,
Carter’s vice president, told VOA that day was the lowest point of their
administration.</p>
<p>“When that rescue mission failed and lives were lost. I mean, that
was just … we were just morose that day and for some time after that,”
Mondale said. Secretary of State Cyrus Vance resigned in protest of the
operation.</p>
<p>The failure of the mission damaged Carter’s credibility with the
American public. The incident occurred seven months before the 1980
presidential election and contributed to Carter’s defeat to challenger
Ronald Reagan.</p>
<p>“The exact anniversary of the hostages being taken was Election Day,”
Carter said. “Of course, the news media were completely obsessed with
the anniversary of the hostages being taken and the fact that I had not
been able to get them out. That was the number one issue that caused me
to fail.”</p>
<p>The hostages were freed the day Reagan became president.</p>
<p>In 1981, Carter returned to Plains, unsure about the direction of his
post-presidential life. His plans for a library and museum were
initially modest.</p>
<p>“I envisioned it to be a tiny thing, where I would have an office and
some nice buildings in Atlanta. And that anyone in the world that had an
ongoing conflict or potential conflict could come to me and I would help
them mediate the dispute and stop a war,” he said.</p>
<p>The Carter Center, under his direction, monitored more then 80
troubled elections and mediated disputes ranging from a nuclear standoff
with North Korea in 1994, to a peace agreement between Uganda and Sudan
in 1999. The center is also a leader in promoting health and fighting
disease in the poorest parts of the planet.</p>
<p>In one of many interviews with Voice of America, Carter reflected on
his life in and out of the White House. He said the greatest part of his
legacy wasn’t his accomplishments as president or the Nobel Peace Prize,
but the eradication of Guinea worm disease.</p>
<p>“There’s only been one disease in the history of humankind, ever
eradicated, and that was smallpox,” he said, “So Guinea worm is going to
soon be the second disease in history, to be wiped off the face of the
Earth.”</p>
<p>Thanks to Carter’s efforts, only 13 cases of Guinea worm were
recorded in 2022.</p>
<p>Carter led an active life until the age of 99, surviving brain cancer
in 2015.</p>
<p>Declining health and the 2020 global coronavirus pandemic kept him
confined to his hometown of Plains in his final years.</p>
<p>Jimmy Carter last appeared in public during funeral services for his
wife, Rosalynn, in November 2023.</p>
<p>In one of his last public media appearances, Carter shared with VOA
his hopes for the Carter Center’s future.</p>
<p>“I would like to see the United States in the future strive to be the
number one champion in the world of peace and human rights and
environmental quality, and I would say treating everyone equal,” he
said. “If we could do that, we would have a real superpower in the
country I love very much.”</p>
<p>Jimmy Carter lived the longest of any occupant of the White House,
and his 77-year marriage to wife Rosalynn is the longest of any
president and first lady.</p>
<p>Although his final resting place will be on the grounds of his home
in Plains, Georgia, the work and the words of Carter live on in the
pages of the dozens of books he authored throughout his life. It
includes his memoirs, a fiction novel, controversial examinations of the
Middle East, and a collection of his favorite poems.</p>

id="german-government-seeks-to-downplay-musks-backing-of-far-right-party-ahead-of-general-election">German
government seeks to downplay Musk’s backing of far-right party ahead of
general election</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Berlin — The German government on Monday sought to downplay efforts
by tech entrepreneur Elon Musk to get involved in the country’s general
election campaign by again endorsing the far-right Alternative for
Germany, or AfD, party.</p>
<p>Musk caused uproar over the weekend after backing the AfD in an
opinion piece in a major newspaper, leading to the resignation of the
paper’s opinion editor in protest.</p>
<p>“Freedom of expression also includes the greatest nonsense,”
government spokesperson Christiane Hoffmann said, adding that she
wouldn’t comment further on Musk’s statements.</p>
<p>She did, however, say that “it is indeed the case that Elon Musk is
trying to influence the federal election through his statement.”</p>
<p>In that context, Hoffmann also pointed out that the AfD is being
monitored by Germany’s domestic intelligence service on suspicion of
being right-wing extremist and that it has already been recognized as
such in some individual German states.</p>
<p>Germany is to vote in an early election on Feb. 23 after Chancellor
Olaf Scholz’s three-party governing coalition collapsed last month in a
dispute over how to revitalize the country’s stagnant economy.</p>
<p>Musk’s guest opinion piece for Welt am Sonntag published in German
over the weekend, was the second time this month he had supported
Alternative for Germany, or AfD.</p>
<p>“The Alternative for Germany (AfD) is the last spark of hope for this
country,” Musk wrote in his translated commentary.</p>
<p>He went on to say the far-right party “can lead the country into a
future where economic prosperity, cultural integrity and technological
innovation are not just wishes, but reality.”</p>
<p>The Tesla Motors CEO also wrote that his investment in Germany gave
him the right to comment on the country’s condition.</p>
<p>The AfD is polling strongly, but its candidate for the top job, Alice
Weidel, has no realistic chance of becoming chancellor because other
parties refuse to work with the far-right party.</p>
<p>An ally of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, the technology
billionaire challenged in his opinion piece the party’s public
image.</p>
<p>“The portrayal of the AfD as right-wing extremist is clearly false,
considering that Alice Weidel, the party’s leader, has a same-sex
partner from Sri Lanka! Does that sound like Hitler to you? Please!”</p>
<p>Musk’s commentary has led to a debate in German media over the
boundaries of free speech, with the paper’s own opinion editor
announcing her resignation, pointedly on Musk’s social media platform,
X.</p>
<p>“I always enjoyed leading the opinion section of WELT and WAMS. Today
an article by Elon Musk appeared in Welt am Sonntag. I handed in my
resignation yesterday after it went to print,” Eva Marie Kogel
wrote.</p>
<p>The newspaper was attacked by politicians and other media for
offering Musk, a foreigner, a platform.</p>
<p>Musk’s opinion piece in the Welt am Sonntag was accompanied by a
critical article by the future editor-in-chief of the Welt group, Jan
Philipp Burgard, who wrote that while some of Musk’s diagnoses of
Germany’s problems may be correct “his therapeutic approach, that only
the AfD can save Germany, is fatally wrong.”</p>

<h2 id="the-hottest-climate-debates-of-2024">The Hottest Climate Debates
of 2024</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-30, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTM2OTA4OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczNzUwNjU1Mn0.CSYtxU8u104ESeEzOCx5KVS4d1WVFBeCC65E_n-JXNQ/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
The end of 2024 marks the end of four of the busiest years the climate
and clean energy community has seen to date. I think it’s safe to say
the energy transition is in full swing (despite certain opinions
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/chris-wright-energy#:~:text=There%20is%20no%20climate%20crisis%2C%20and%20we%E2%80%99re%20not%20in%20the%20midst%20of%20an%20energy%20transition" target="_self"><u>to
the contrary</u></a>), even if it’s not yet on a glide path to a future
that would avoid devastating climate impacts.
</p>
<p>
But with progress comes a new kind of conflict: infighting. Which
climate solutions are the <em><em>best</em></em> climate solutions? How
can we implement them the <em><em>right way?</em></em> When should other
priorities, like affordability and national security, come first, if
they should at all? Are those trade-offs even real? Or are they fossil
fuel propaganda?
</p>
<p>
In a
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/the-climate-coalition-is-threatening-to-split-apart" target="_self"><u>fantastic
piece</u></a> for Heatmap last year, researcher Joshua Lappen drew
attention to this increasingly combative undercurrent in the climate
coalition, inflamed by the debate over whether a
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/permitting-bill-manchin-barrasso-westerman" target="_self"><u>compromise
on permitting reform</u></a> would be better for the climate in the long
run than no reform at all. That fight — along with the related question
of whether conservationists are slowing climate action — continued into
2024. But it wasn’t the only thing climate advocates fought about. Here
are four debates that dominated the discourse this year that I think
will continue into 2025.
</p>
<h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Will expanding U.S. liquefied natural gas exports help fight climate
change or make it worse?
</h3>
<p>
Biden ignited a firestorm of controversy in January when he
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/01/26/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-temporary-pause-on-pending-approvals-of-liquefied-natural-gas-exports/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>paused
approvals</u></a> of new liquefied natural gas export terminals until
the Department of Energy could re-evaluate LNG’s potential economic and
environmental impacts. The move followed protests from environmental
groups that had named these facilities their number one climate
bogeyman, arguing that new terminals would, as
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-13/natural-gas-export-projects-hang-in-the-balance-as-biden-mulls-climate-test" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Bill
McKibben put it</u></a>, “install our reliance on fossil fuels for
decades to come.”
</p>
<p>
What followed was much back and forth about whether growing U.S. LNG
exports would help or hurt efforts to stop climate change. To be sure,
producing and burning natural gas releases planet-warming emissions. But
past government and academic studies have found that exporting U.S.
natural gas could result in lower global emissions overall by helping
other countries replace dirtier fuels such as coal or natural gas from
Russia, where the industry has much higher methane emissions.
Environmentalists pushed back on that narrative, citing a
<a href="https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2024/10/liquefied-natural-gas-carbon-footprint-worse-coal" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>study</u></a>
by Robert Howarth, a Cornell scientist, which found that producing and
transporting LNG could be worse for the climate than coal. Critics then
<a href="https://thebreakthrough.org/issues/energy/a-major-paper-on-liquified-natural-gas-emissions-is-riddled-with-errors" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pounced
on Howarth’s study</u></a>, accusing him of using flawed assumptions
about upstream methane emissions, LNG tanker size, and shipping route
distances.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, calculating the emissions impact of increased LNG exports
requires making <em><em>a lot</em></em> of assumptions. How can we know,
for example, whether creating a cheap supply of natural gas will
displace coal or deter adoption of renewables? As Arvind Ravikumar, an
expert in energy emissions modeling,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/lng-exports-pause-biden-emissions" target="_self"><u>told
my colleague Matthew Zeitlin</u></a>, “There’s no right answer. It
depends on who buys, what time frame, which country, and how are they
using LNG.”
</p>
<p>
A week before Christmas, the Biden administration finally put out its
long-awaited study. It modeled a number of different scenarios, but
found that approving additional LNG exports beyond what’s already in the
pipeline would likely produce at least a small increase in emissions by
2050 in all of them. The report also found that demand from U.S. allies
in Europe and elsewhere would be met by projects that have already been
approved, making additional plants “neither sustainable nor advisable,”
as Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm wrote.
</p>
<p>
The
<a href="https://www.aga.org/news/news-releases/aga-condemns-last-minute-lng-report/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>natural
gas industry</u></a> and its
<a href="https://www.uschamber.com/energy/u-s-chamber-comprehensive-new-s-p-global-analysis-demonstrates-importance-of-lng-exports" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>supporters</u></a>
were quick to question the results, and they’re about to have a much
more sympathetic ear in the Trump administration. But the report gives
activists a considerable weapon to use in future lawsuits if Trump tries
to put LNG approvals on the fast track.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Is the climate movement too obsessed with disinformation?
</h3>
<p>
I checked my phone after dinner one evening in August to find the
members of climate X (formerly known as climate Twitter) suddenly at
each other’s throats over a
<a href="https://jacobin.com/2024/08/climate-disinformation-green-transition-workers" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>provocative
essay published in </u><u><em><em>Jacobin</em></em></u></a> titled
“Obsessing Over Climate Disinformation Is a Wrong Turn.” Written by the
environmental sociologist Holly Buck, the essay argues that too much
focus on the oil and gas industry’s disinformation campaigns risks
dismissing or overlooking legitimate concerns people have about the
energy transition. “Fighting disinformation becomes a cheap hack for the
hard work of listening to people and learning from them,” wrote Buck.
“We have to put resources into a different sort of public engagement
with climate change, one that sees publics as competent and nuanced
rather than as susceptible marks for memes.”
</p>
<p>
The message struck a nerve. While many praised the essay, a number of
prominent climate activists and journalists with large online followings
attacked it, defending the urgency of combating disinformation and
accusing Buck of setting up a false dichotomy between this work and
public engagement. Aaron Regunberg, a former Rhode Island state
representative and lawyer for the nonprofit Public Citizen,
<a href="https://jacobin.com/2024/08/climate-crisis-disinformation-fossil-fuels" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>wrote
a response in </u><u><em><em>Jacobin</em></em></u></a> charging Buck
with “arguing with a straw man” and not understanding how insidious the
oil industry’s disinformation strategies are.
</p>

Buck tried to clarify her view in a
<a href="https://jacobin.com/2024/08/climate-disinformation-fossil-fuels-ngos" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>followup
piece</u></a>, asserting that she was not denying that disinformation
was a “serious obstacle to climate action,” but rather that the act of
“fighting disinformation” won’t solve what she sees as underlying
problems working against the energy transition: the absence of an
engagement apparatus that helps regular people understand their options,
and a media ecosystem that “profits from our hate and division.”
</p>
<p>
What’s clear moving forward is that with a

energy </u></a>opponent entering the White House and a mega-billionaire
who, with X, literally owns a chunk of the media ecosystem standing by
his side, both disinformation and the framework that supports it will
stay in the spotlight.

<li>Will data centers stall the energy transition?
</h3>
<p>
After remaining basically flat for two decades, U.S. electricity demand
is set to grow by an average of 3% per year over the next five years,
according to the
<a href="https://gridstrategiesllc.com/wp-content/uploads/National-Load-Growth-Report-2024.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>latest
forecast</u></a> from the energy policy consulting firm Grid Strategies.
Domestic manufacturing will drive some of the demand, it predicts, but
the majority will come from the buildout of data centers, “supercharged”
by the rise of artificial intelligence.
</p>
<p>
On one hand, many of the companies building data centers have ambitious
clean energy goals. Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and others have signed
landmark deals with advanced nuclear and geothermal power companies,
helping to get first-of-a-kind deployments of these technologies
financed. If those projects are successful, they could pave the way for
cheaper, cleaner, 24/7 power for the rest of us.
</p>
<p>
But energy-hungry AI is already causing those tech giants to

behind on their targets</u></a> and driving major investments in fossil
fuel infrastructure. My colleague Matthew Zeitlin has chronicled how
electricity demand growth is making it harder to close
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/elgin-natural-gas-pjm" target="_self"><u>natural
gas</u></a> and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/coal-gas-plant-retirements" target="_self"><u>coal
plants</u></a> . In the states that data centers are flocking to, such
as Virginia, North Carolina, and Texas, utilities are revising their
integrated resource plans to
<a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/data-centers-want-clean-electricity-can-georgia-power-deliver-it" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>increase
the amount of natural gas generation</u></a> they expect to deliver.
Exxon and Chevron are gearing up to build natural gas generation “behind
the meter,” i.e. serving data centers directly, so they can meet demand
more quickly than if they had to hook up to the grid. The gas pipeline
company Williams is also planning a

manufacturer GE Vernova is
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/ge-vernova-natural-gas-ai" target="_self"><u>seeing
orders for natural gas turbines skyrocket</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
There are layers to this debate. Should policymakers require
hyperscalers to
<a href="https://heatmap.news/ideas/ai-additionality-framework" target="_self"><u>bring
online new sources of clean energy</u></a> to power their data centers,
or will that
<a href="https://heatmap.news/ideas/abundance-additionality-permitting-reform" target="_self"><u>prove
counterproductive</u></a> and “dampen investment in new industries” — a
trade-off familiar to anyone following the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/green-hydrogen-tax-credit-treasury" target="_self"><u>back-and-forth
over clean hydrogen</u></a>? And is it possible that all the fuss about
data center demand is
<a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-episode-10-ai-data-centers" target="_self"><u>overblown</u></a>?
Is there even a
<a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/189460/ai-data-centers-coal-fossil-fuels-energy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>business
case for AI that supports this buildout</u></a>?
</p>
<p>
The incoming Trump administration has
<a href="https://x.com/leezeldin/status/1856305964527350149" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>promised</u></a>
to “unleash U.S. energy dominance” and “make America the AI capital of
the world,” so it’s likely this will continue to be one of the top
questions for climate hawks for the foreseeable future.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Are EVs tanking or taking off?
</h3>
<p>
The debate over the state of electric vehicle sales
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/are-ev-sales-really-slowing-data" target="_self"><u>didn’t
start in 2024</u></a>, but headlines this year continued to sow
confusion over whether or not EVs are catching on in the way climate
advocates — and carmakers — hoped.
</p>
<p>
Each of the big three automakers, as well as most of the remaining
companies serving North America, revised down their EV production plans
this year, citing a waning market. In July, General Motors CEO Mary
Barra said the company wasn’t going to hit its goal of producing a
million EVs per year in North America by 2025. “We’re seeing a little
bit of a slowdown here,” she
<a href="https://x.com/SawyerMerritt/status/1812943267023274012" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said
on CNBC</u></a>. “The market just isn’t developing. But we will get
there.” Ford
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/ford-ev-suv-canceled" target="_self"><u>cancelled
plans</u></a> to produce an electric three-row SUV, delayed its release
of an electric medium-sized pickup truck until 2027, and paused
production of the F-150 Lightning, and has decided to shift its
near-term focus to
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/ford-maverick-hybrid-q1-sales" target="_self"><u>selling
hybrids</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Among non-U.S. automakers, Stellantis delayed the release of a new
<a href="https://insideevs.com/news/744905/ram-1500-ramcharger-rev-delay/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>EV
Ram pickup truck</u></a> and will put out a hybrid version instead.
Volkswagen delayed the North America release of an electric sedan.
Several luxury automakers, including Aston Martin and Bentley, delayed
the release of their first EVs until 2027. Mercedes-Benz once strived to
have EVs make up 50% of its sales in 2025 — now it’s trying to hit that
mark in 2030. Tesla sales also slowed significantly in the first half of
the year. CEO Elon Musk
<a href="https://insideevs.com/news/738534/tesla-25000-car-robotaxi-musk/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>cancelled
plans to build a new low-cost EV</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
But while sales numbers may not have met individual automakers’
expectations, overall sales continued to grow. “For every sign of an EV
slowdown, another suggests an adolescent industry on the verge of its
next growth spurt,”
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-28/the-slowdown-in-us-electric-vehicle-sales-looks-more-like-a-blip" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>Bloomberg</em></em></u></a>
reported mid-way through the year. During the third quarter, GM saw
record EV sales. Honda’s debut EV, the Prologue, jumped up the charts to
become one of the top-selling offerings on the market. After looking at
<a href="https://www.coxautoinc.com/market-insights/q3-2024-ev-sales/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>third
quarter numbers</u></a>, Cox Automotive analysts opined that “a 10%
[market] share is well within reach.”
</p>
<p>
We’ll have to see how Trump’s
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-kill-ev-tax-credit" target="_self"><u>plans
to eliminate consumer subsidies for EVs</u></a> changes that outlook,
but expect there to be plenty more fodder for debate.

Lavin, Tony-winning Broadway actress who starred in sitcom ‘Alice,’ dies
at 87</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Linda Lavin, a Tony Award-winning stage actress who became
a working class icon as a paper-hat wearing waitress on the TV sitcom
“Alice,” has died. She was 87. </p>
<p>Lavin died in Los Angeles on Sunday of complications from recently
discovered lung cancer, her representative, Bill Veloric, told The
Associated Press in an email. </p>
<p>A success on Broadway, Lavin tried her luck in Hollywood in the
mid-1970s. She was chosen to star in a new CBS sitcom based on “Alice
Doesn’t Live Here Anymore,” the Martin Scorsese-directed film that won
Ellen Burstyn an Oscar for playing the title waitress. </p>
<p>The title was shortened to “Alice” and Lavin became a role model for
working moms as Alice Hyatt, a widowed mother with a 12-year-old son
working in a roadside diner outside Phoenix. The show, with Lavin
singing the theme song “There’s a New Girl in Town,” ran from 1976 to
1985. </p>
<p>The show turned “Kiss my grits” into a catchphrase and co-starred
Polly Holliday as waitress Flo and Vic Tayback as the gruff owner and
head chef of Mel’s Diner. </p>
<p>The series bounced around the CBS schedule during its first two
seasons but became a hit leading into “All in the Family” on Sunday
nights in October 1977. It was among primetime’s top 10 series in four
of the next five seasons. Variety magazine listed it among the all-time
best workplace comedies. </p>
<p>Lavin soon went on to win a Tony for best actress in a play for Neil
Simon’s “Broadway Bound” in 1987. </p>
<p>She was working as recently as this month promoting a new Netflix
series in which she appears, “No Good Deed,” and filming a forthcoming
Hulu series, “Mid-Century Modern,” according to Deadline, which first
reported her death. </p>
<p>Lavin grew up in Portland, Maine, and moved to New York City after
graduating from the College of William and Mary. She sang in nightclubs
and in ensembles of shows. </p>
<p>Iconic producer and director Hal Prince gave Lavin her first big
break while directing the Broadway musical “It’s a Bird … It’s a Plane …
It’s Superman.” She went on to earn a Tony nomination in Simon’s “Last
of the Red Hot Lovers” in 1969 before winning 18 years later for another
Simon play, “Broadway Bound.” </p>
<p>In the mid 1970s, Lavin moved to Los Angeles. She had a recurring
role on “Barney Miller” and in 1976 was chosen to star in a new CBS
sitcom based on Ellen Burstyn’s Oscar-winning waitress comedy-drama,
“Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore.” </p>
<p>Back on Broadway, Lavin later starred Paul Rudnick’s comedy “The New
Century,” had a concert show called “Songs &amp; Confessions of a
One-Time Waitress” and earned a Tony nomination in Donald Margulies’
“Collected Stories.” </p>
<p>Michael Kuchwara of the AP gave Lavin a rave in “Collected Stories,”
writing that she “gives one of those complete, nuanced performances,
capturing the woman’s intellectual vigor, her wry sense of humor and her
increasing physical frailty with astonishing fidelity. And Lavin’s sense
of timing is superb, whether delivering a joke or acerbically dissecting
the work of her protegee.” </p>
<p>Lavin basked in a burst of renewed attention in her 70s, earning a
Tony nomination for Nicky Silver’s “The Lyons.” She also starred in
“Other Desert Cities” and a revival of “Follies” before they transferred
to Broadway. </p>
<p>The AP again raved about Lavin in “The Lyons,” calling her “an
absolute wonder to behold as Rita Lyons, a nag of a mother with a
collection of firm beliefs and eye rolls, a matriarch who is both
suffocating and keeping everyone at arm’s length.” </p>
<p>She also appeared in the film “Wanderlust” with Jennifer Aniston and
Paul Rudd, and released her first CD, “Possibilities.” She played
Jennifer Lopez’s grandmother in “The Back-Up Plan.” </p>
<p>When asked for guidance from up-and-coming actresses, Lavin stressed
one thing. “I say that what happened for me was that work brings work.
As long as it wasn’t morally reprehensible to me, I did it,” she told
the AP in 2011. </p>
<p>She and Steve Bakunas, an artist, musician and her third husband,
converted an old automotive garage into the 50-seat Red Barn Studio
Theatre in Wilmington, North Carolina. </p>
<p>It opened in 2007 and their productions include “Doubt” by John
Patrick Shanley, “Glengarry Glen Ross” by David Mamet, “Rabbit Hole” by
David Lindsay-Abaire and “The Tale of the Allergist’s Wife” by Charles
Busch, in which Lavin also starred on Broadway, earning a Tony
nomination. </p>
<p>She returned to TV in 2013 in “Sean Saves the World,” starring “Will
&amp; Grace’s” Sean Hayes, a show which lasted a season. Lavin also made
appearances on “Mom” and “9JKL.”</p>

market today: Asian shares mixed after Wall Street slips, led by tech
giants</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Asian shares were mixed on Monday after stocks fell broadly on Friday
as Wall Street closed out a holiday-shortened week on a down note. </p>
<p>U.S. futures were lower while oil prices were little changed. </p>
<p>In Asia, South Korea’s Kospi added 0.6% to 2,418.80. But shares of
Jeju Air Co. lost 8.8% after one of the company’s jets skidded off a
runway, slammed into a concrete fence, and burst into flames Sunday in
South Korea as its landing gear failed to deploy. 179 people died in the
crash. </p>
<p>Political turmoil continued as South Korean law enforcement officials
requested a court warrant on Monday to detain impeached President Yoon
Suk Yeol. They are investigating whether his martial law decree on
December 3 amounted to rebellion. </p>
<p>Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 index lost 0.9% to 39,914.21 as the dollar gained
against the Japanese yen, trading at 157.83 yen, up from 157.75 yen. The
Tokyo market will wrap up trading for 2024 with a year-end ceremony as
Japan begins its New Year holidays, the biggest festival of the
year. </p>
<p>The Hang Seng in Hong Kong shed 0.3% to 20,030.63 while the Shanghai
Composite index was up 0.3% at 3,408.72. Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX 200
dipped 0.9% to 8,191.50. </p>
<p>On Friday, the S&amp;P 500 fell 1.1% to 5,970.84. Roughly 90% of
stocks in the benchmark index lost ground, but it managed to hold onto a
modest gain of 0.7% for the week. </p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.8% to 42,992.21. The
tech-heavy Nasdaq composite fell 1.5%, to 19,722.03. </p>
<p>The losses were made worse by sharp declines for the Big Tech stocks
known as the “Magnificent 7,” which can heavily influence the direction
of the market because of their large size. </p>
<p>A wide range of retailers also fell. Amazon fell 1.5% and Best Buy
slipped 1.5%. The sector is being closely watched for clues on how it
performed during the holiday shopping season. </p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 gained nearly 3% over a 3-day stretch before breaking
for the Christmas holiday. On Thursday, the index posted a small
decline. </p>
<p>Despite Friday’s drop, the market is moving closer to another
standout annual finish. The S&amp;P 500 is on track for a gain of around
25% in 2024. That would mark a second consecutive yearly gain of more
than 20%, the first time that has happened since 1997-1998. </p>
<p>The gains have been driven partly by upbeat economic data showing
that consumers continued spending and the labor market remained strong.
Inflation, while still high, has also been steadily easing. </p>
<p>A report on Friday showed that sales and inventory estimates for the
wholesales trade industry fell 0.2% in November, following a slight gain
in October. That weaker-than-expected report follows an update on the
labor market Thursday that showed unemployment benefits held steady last
week. </p>
<p>The stream of upbeat economic data and easing inflation helped prompt
a reversal in the Federal Reserve’s interest rate policy this year.
Expectations for interest rate cuts also helped drive market gains. The
central bank recently delivered its third cut to interest rates in
2024. </p>
<p>Even though inflation has come closer to the central bank’s target of
2%, it remains stubbornly above that mark and worries about it heating
up again have tempered the forecast for more interest rate cuts. </p>
<p>Inflation concerns have added to uncertainties heading into 2025,
which include the labor market’s path ahead and shifting economic
policies under incoming President Donald Trump. Worries have risen that
Trump’s preference for tariffs and other policies could lead to higher
inflation, a bigger U.S. government debt, and difficulties for global
trade. </p>
<p>In other dealings early Monday, U.S. benchmark crude oil picked up 1
cent to $70.61 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, lost
1 cent to $73.78 per barrel. </p>
<p>The euro fell to $1.0427 from $1.0433.</p>

id="storm-system-spawns-tornadoes-across-us-leading-to-4-deaths">Storm
system spawns tornadoes across US, leading to 4 deaths</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Officials assessed the damage on Sunday after a strong storm system
moved across the southern United States over the weekend, spawning
tornadoes and killing at least four people. </p>
<p>There were at least 45 reports of tornado damage across Texas,
Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia, said Brian Hurley, a
meteorologist with the National Weather Service’s Weather Prediction
Center. Crews will do damage surveys to confirm tornadoes. </p>
<p>The storms during busy holiday travels caused some treacherous road
conditions along with delays or cancellations at some of the busiest
U.S. airports. As of Sunday afternoon, there were over 600 flight delays
affecting Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in the
southern state of Georgia, according to flight tracker FlightAware. </p>
<p>“It’s not unheard of, but it is fairly uncommon to have a severe
weather outbreak of this magnitude this late in the year,” said Frank
Pereira, a meteorologist with the Weather Prediction Center. </p>
<p>In the area of Houston, Texas, National Weather Service storm survey
crews confirmed that at least five tornadoes hit north and south of the
city on Saturday. </p>
<p>At least one person died. The 48-year-old woman was found about 30
meters from her home in the Liverpool area south of Houston, said
Madison Polston of the Brazoria County Sheriff’s Office. She said the
exact cause of death wasn’t immediately known. </p>
<p>Four other people in Brazoria County had injuries that weren’t
considered critical, said Polston, adding that at least 40 homes and
buildings were significantly damaged. </p>
<p>In Montgomery County, north of Houston, about 30 homes were destroyed
and about 50 others sustained major damage, county official Jason Smith
said. </p>
<p>In the state of North Carolina, a 70-year-old man was killed Sunday
in Statesville, just north of Charlotte, when a tree landed on the
pickup truck he was driving. Highway Patrol Trooper DJ Maffucci said “it
was just a freak accident” and he believed Matthew Teeple, of Cleveland,
North Carolina, was killed instantly. </p>
<p>“It’s very sad, just terrible timing,” Maffucci said, adding that the
storms were responsible for a number of downed trees and “quite a few
wrecks.” </p>
<p>Two people were killed in storms in Mississippi, officials said. An
18-year-old died after a tree fell on her home Saturday night in Natchez
in Adams County, said Emergency Management spokesperson Neifa Hardy. Two
other people in the home were injured. </p>
<p>Another person died in Lowndes County and at least eight more were
injured across the state, officials said. </p>
<p>The National Weather Service said two tornadoes hit around Bude and
the city of Brandon, ripping roofs from several buildings. </p>
<p>Storm damage also was reported in the northern Alabama city of
Athens, northwest of Huntsville. </p>
<p>Holly Hollman, spokeswoman for the city, said most of the damage from
the early Sunday morning storms occurred downtown. She said it hurled
large HVAC units from the tops of building and ripped the roof off a
bookstore. A full-sized, stripped-down military helicopter was toppled
from a pole where it was on display, she added. </p>
<p>“I stepped out on my porch and I could hear it roar,” she said of the
storm. “I think we are extremely lucky that we got hit late at night. If
it had hit during the busy hours, I think we might have had some
injuries and possibly some fatalities.” </p>
<p>As of Sunday afternoon, more than 40,000 people were still without
power in Mississippi, according to electric utility tracking website
PowerOutage.us. Texas, Alabama, North Carolina and Georgia each had
about 10,000 customers without power, it said. </p>
<p>The storms closed some roads in western North Carolina, a region
broadly devastated by Hurricane Helene this fall. That included part of
U.S. 441, also known as the Great Smoky Mountains Expressway, which
closed north of Bryson City due to high winds. </p>
<p>In Bumpus Cove, Tennessee, Justin Fromkin, president of Raising Hope
Disaster Relief, worked Sunday to save what he could from the
organization’s supply tent — filled with clothes and food — after about
152 millimeters of rain fell. </p>
<p>He’s spent the past few months delivering aid to areas in western
North Carolina and eastern Tennessee that are still reeling from Helene.
The ground in some parts of the mountains is still unstable from Helene,
Fromkin said, and Sunday’s downpour adds to the problem.</p>

leaders react to death of former US President Jimmy Carter</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>World leaders and U.S. politicians reacted to news that former U.S.
President Jimmy Carter, who as president brokered peace between Israel
and Egypt and later received the Nobel Peace Prize for his humanitarian
work, has died at age 100.</p>
<p>US President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden</p>
<p>“Today, America and the world lost an extraordinary leader, statesman
and humanitarian.</p>
<p>Over six decades, we had the honor of calling Jimmy Carter a dear
friend. But what’s extraordinary about Jimmy Carter, though, is that
millions of people throughout America and the world who never met him
thought of him as a dear friend as well.”</p>
<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris</p>
<p>“Throughout his life, President Carter was strengthened by the love
and support of his partner of 77 years, First Lady Rosalynn Carter,
whose life President Biden and I had the opportunity to celebrate in
Georgia last year. After leaving office, President Carter continued his
fight for peace, democracy, and human dignity through the Carter
Center.</p>
<p>I had the privilege of knowing President Carter for years. I will
always remember his kindness, wisdom, and profound grace. His life and
legacy continue to inspire me — and will inspire generations to come.
Our world is a better place because of President Carter.”</p>
<p>US President-elect Donald Trump</p>
<p>“The challenges Jimmy faced as president came at a pivotal time for
our country and he did everything in his power to improve the lives of
all Americans. For that, we all owe him a debt of gratitude.</p>
<p>Melania and I are thinking warmly of the Carter Family and their
loved ones during this difficult time. We urge everyone to keep them in
their hearts and prayers.”</p>
<p>US Vice President-elect JD Vance</p>
<p>“Jimmy Carter dedicated his life to serving this country. Our
thoughts and prayers go out to his loved ones. May he Rest in
Peace.”</p>
<p>Former US President Barack Obama</p>
<p>“Elected in the shadow of Watergate, Jimmy Carter promised voters
that he would always tell the truth. And he did — advocating for the
public good, consequences be damned. He believed some things were more
important than reelection — things like integrity, respect, and
compassion. Because Jimmy Carter believed, as deeply as he believed
anything, that we are all created in God’s image. …</p>
<p>Maranatha Baptist Church will be a little quieter on Sundays, but
President Carter will never be far away — buried alongside Rosalynn next
to a willow tree down the road, his memory calling all of us to heed our
better angels. Michelle and I send our thoughts and prayers to the
Carter family, and everyone who loved and learned from this remarkable
man.”</p>
<p>Former US President George W. Bush</p>
<p>“Laura and I send our heartfelt condolences to Jack, Chip, Jeff, Amy,
and the entire Carter family.</p>
<p>James Earl Carter, Jr., was a man of deeply held convictions. He was
loyal to his family, his community, and his country. President Carter
dignified the office. And his efforts to leave behind a better world
didn’t end with the presidency. His work with Habitat for Humanity and
the Carter Center set an example of service that will inspire Americans
for generations.”</p>
<p>Former US President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton</p>
<p>“From his commitment to civil rights as a state senator and governor
of Georgia; to his efforts as President to protect our natural resources
in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, make energy conservation a
national priority, return the Panama Canal to Panama, and secure peace
between Egypt and Israel at Camp David; to his post-Presidential efforts
at the Carter Center supporting honest elections, advancing peace,
combating disease, and promoting democracy; to his and Rosalynn’s
devotion and hard work at Habitat for Humanity — he worked tirelessly
for a better, fairer world.”</p>
<p>Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi </p>
<p>“In this moment of sorrow, I extend my heartfelt condolences to the
family of former American President Jimmy Carter, as well as to the
President and the people of the United States of America. </p>
<p>His significant role in achieving the peace agreement between Egypt
and Israel will remain etched in the annals of history, and his
humanitarian work exemplifies a lofty standard of love, peace, and
brotherhood. His enduring legacy ensures that he will be remembered as
one of the world’s most prominent leaders in service to
humanity.”   </p>
<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken </p>
<p>“Throughout decades of public service, President Carter embodied
integrity, compassion, and a commitment to advancing the freedom,
security, and welfare of others. </p>
<p>He channeled that spirit in his foreign policy, from negotiating the
return of the Panama Canal to its host nation, to developing arms
control agreements with the Soviet Union. And he brought it to his every
exchange and conversation, from heads of state to ordinary
citizens. </p>
<p>President Carter also showed us what can be achieved through tireless
and principled diplomacy, mediating a landmark deal with Israel and
Egypt that helped forge peace between two nations that had spent decades
at war. His efforts are an important reminder of what’s possible,
especially amidst renewed conflict and suffering in the region.” </p>
<p>Britain’s King Charles </p>
<p>“It was with great sadness that I learned of the death of former
President Carter. He was a committed public servant and devoted his life
to promoting peace and human rights. </p>
<p>His dedication and humility served as an inspiration to many, and I
remember with great fondness his visit to the United Kingdom in
1977. </p>
<p>My thoughts and prayers are with President Carter’s family and the
American people at this time.”   </p>
<p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau </p>
<p>“Jimmy Carter’s legacy is one of compassion, kindness, empathy, and
hard work. He served others both at home and around the world his entire
life — and he loved doing it. He was always thoughtful and generous with
his advice to me. My deepest condolences to the Carter family, his many
loved ones, and the American people who are mourning a former President
and a lifelong humanitarian. May his selfless service continue to
inspire us all for years to come.” </p>
<p>Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino </p>
<p>“I offer my condolences to the family and to the people and
Government of the United States on the death of former President Jimmy
Carter. His stint in the White House was marked by difficult times, and
were crucial for Panama in negotiating and signing the Torrijos-Carter
Treaties in 1977, which transferred the (Panama) Canal into Panamanian
hands and made our country truly sovereign. May his soul rest in
peace.”   </p>
<p>Venezuelan Government of President Nicolas Maduro </p>
<p>“The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela regrets the death of former
President of the United States of America, Jimmy Carter, and extends its
most sincere condolences to his family and friends. </p>
<p>Former President Carter was a man of proven commitment to peace and
dialog. His contributions to global politics and his dedication to peace
have left an indelible mark on the world.” </p>
<p>French President Emmanuel Macron</p>
<p>“Throughout his life, Jimmy Carter has been a steadfast advocate for
the rights of the most vulnerable and has tirelessly fought for peace.
France sends its heartfelt thoughts to his family and to the American
people.”</p>
<p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese </p>
<p>“President Carter rose from humble beginnings to leave a remarkable
legacy. Beyond being elected to the Presidency or being awarded the
Nobel Peace Prize, Jimmy Carter’s legacy is best measured in lives
changed, saved and uplifted.” </p>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy </p>
<p>“We express our heartfelt condolences to the American people and to
the family of former U.S. President Jimmy Carter on his passing. He was
a leader who served during a time when Ukraine was not yet independent,
yet his heart stood firmly with us in our ongoing fight for
freedom. </p>
<p>He devoted his life to promoting peace in the world and defending
human rights. Today, let us remember: peace matters, and the world must
remain united in standing against those who threaten these values.” </p>
<p>Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel </p>
<p>“Condolences to the people and the government of the U.S., and
especially the family of President James Carter. Our people remember
with gratitude his efforts to better relations, his visits to #Cuba and
his speaking out in favor of the release of the Five.” </p>
<p>US Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer</p>
<p>“Today, we mourn the loss of one of our most humble and devoted
public servants, President Jimmy Carter.</p>
<p>President Carter personified the true meaning of leadership through
service, through compassion, and through integrity.</p>
<p>From his legacy as president, to his dedication to improving human
rights across the globe, and his tireless efforts alongside his wife
Rosalynn, in building a better world through Habitat for Humanity, he
inspired millions with his unwavering commitment to justice and
equality.”</p>
<p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer</p>
<p>“I was very sorry to hear of President Carter’s passing and I would
like to pay tribute to his decades of selfless public service.</p>
<p>His presidency will be remembered for the historic Camp David Accords
between Israel and Egypt, and it was that lifelong dedication to peace
that saw him receive the Nobel Peace prize.</p>
<p>Motivated by his strong faith and values, President Carter redefined
the post-presidency with a remarkable commitment to social justice and
human rights at home and abroad.”</p>
<p>US Senator Mitch McConnell</p>
<p>“Elaine and I join the Senate and the nation in mourning the passing
of our 39th president, Jimmy Carter.</p>
<p>“President Carter served during times of tension and uncertainty,
both at home and abroad. But his calm spirit and deep faith seemed
unshakeable. Jimmy Carter served as our commander-in-chief for four
years, but he served as the beloved, unassuming Sunday school teacher at
Maranatha Baptist Church in Plains, Georgia for forty. And his humble
devotion leaves us little doubt which of those two important roles he
prized the most.”</p>
<p>US House Speaker Mike Johnson</p>
<p>“Today, the thoughts of Americans and the prayers of Congress are
lifted up on behalf of the Carter family. President Carter’s story was
one of humble beginnings, and his life is a testament to the boundless
opportunities available in this great nation. Because of his work in
brokering the Camp David Accords and his advocacy with Habitat for
Humanity, the world is a more peaceful place, and more Americans have a
place to call home. No one can deny that President Carter led an
extraordinary life of service to his country. May he rest in peace.”</p>
<p>US Representative Mike Turner</p>
<p>“I am deeply saddened to learn about the death of President Jimmy
Carter. President Carter was a man of integrity who was guided by his
faith. I join all Americans in saluting President Carter for his
lifetime of service, first as a naval officer, then as a senator in the
Georgia State Senate, then as Governor of Georgia, and, finally, as
President of the United States. I would like to extend my heartfelt
condolences to the Carter family.”</p>
<p>US Senator Mark Warner</p>
<p>“President Carter will be remembered by what he built and left behind
for us – a model of service late into life, a tireless devotion to
family and philanthropy, and a more peaceful world to call home.”</p>
<p>US Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin</p>
<p>“Jimmy Carter proved that excellence in public service can extend
beyond the White House. His life was an inspiration to those of us who
aspire to lead a life of service.”</p>

<h2 id="key-moments-in-the-life-of-jimmy-carter">Key moments in the life
of Jimmy Carter</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Jimmy Carter’s 1977-1981 presidency included successes like the Camp
David peace accords, but also enough controversy for U.S. voters to see
him as weak — and send him packing after only one term.</p>
<p>Carter’s legacy, however, was largely built on his post-presidency,
the longest in U.S. history.</p>
<p>Here are a few key moments in the life of Carter, who died Sunday at
the age of 100.</p>
<p>The Panama Canal</p>
<p>During his first year in office, Carter went back on a campaign
promise and decided to hand back management of the Panama Canal — which
had been in U.S. military control since its construction at the start of
the 20th century.</p>
<p>“Fairness, and not force, should lie at the heart of our dealings
with the nations of the world,” he said at the signing of the canal
treaties with Panamanian leader Omar Torrijos on September 7, 1977.</p>
<p>Carter was ridiculed for the move, which gave Panama control over the
canal linking the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans at the end of 1999.</p>
<p>History, however, has looked upon the deal as a deft bit of
diplomacy.  </p>
<p>Giving Panama a meatier role in the canal’s management in the run-up
to the transfer allowed for stability and broke with America’s image as
an overbearing imperialist power in Latin America.</p>
<p>Morality in politics</p>
<p>Upon his arrival in the Oval Office, Carter looked to distance
himself from the realpolitik practiced by his predecessors — a vestige
of the Cold War — and placed human rights at the heart of his
agenda.</p>
<p>“Our principal goal is to help shape a world which is more responsive
to the desire of people everywhere for economic well-being, social
justice, political self-determination and basic human rights,” he said
in a 1978 speech at the U.S. Naval Academy.</p>
<p>In concrete terms, Carter notably signed the International Covenant
on Civil and Political Rights in 1977. It was eventually ratified by the
United States in 1992 after being blocked for years by the Senate.</p>
<p>Camp David Accords  </p>
<p>In September 1978, Carter invited Israeli Premier Menachem Begin and
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat to Camp David, the presidential retreat
outside Washington.</p>
<p>After 13 days of secret negotiations under Carter’s mediation, two
accords were signed that ultimately led to a peace treaty the following
year.  </p>
<p>The diplomatic triumph was cited when Carter was awarded the Nobel
Peace Prize.</p>
<p>Crisis of confidence</p>
<p>In the summer of 1979, the economy rocked by inflation and his
approval rating in free fall, Carter addressed the American people in a
nationwide televised speech on July 15.</p>
<p>In that half-hour, he responded to his critics on his lack of
leadership, instead laying the blame on a national “crisis of
confidence.”</p>
<p>“The erosion of our confidence in the future is threatening to
destroy the social and the political fabric of America,” he said.</p>
<p>The speech was poorly received and would come back to haunt him. Five
cabinet members resigned that week.</p>
<p>Iran hostage crisis</p>
<p>The hostage crisis — more than 50 Americans were held for 444 days at
the U.S. Embassy in Tehran from November 1979 to January 1981 — was the
death knell for Carter’s presidency.</p>
<p>A failed military rescue mission in April 1980 all but extinguished
his chances of reelection later that year.</p>
<p>Operation Eagle Claw was thwarted by sandstorms and mechanical
problems — eventually, the mission was aborted. In the subsequent
withdrawal, two American aircraft collided, killing eight
servicemen.</p>
<p>In the following days, then secretary of state Cyrus Vance resigned,
and the mission’s failure symbolized Carter’s inability to resolve the
crisis.</p>
<p>The hostages were eventually freed on the same day that Republican
Ronald Reagan took office, after thumping Carter at the polls in
November 1980.</p>
<p>The Carter Center</p>
<p>Carter remained extremely active into his 90s despite his retirement
from political life.</p>
<p>In 1982, he founded the Carter Center, which has focused on conflict
resolution, promoting democracy and human rights, and fighting
disease.</p>
<p>Carter — often viewed as America’s most successful former president —
traveled extensively, supervising elections from Haiti to East Timor,
and tackling thorny global problems as a mediator.</p>
<p>The Elders</p>
<p>Carter was also a member of The Elders, a group of former world
leaders founded by Nelson Mandela in 2007 to promote peace and human
rights.</p>
<p>Fellow Nobel peace laureates South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu
(who died in 2021), former Liberian President Ellen Sirleaf Johnson and
the late U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan also belonged to the
group.</p>

<p>Former President Jimmy Carter, a peanut farmer and Georgia state

leaving the White House, Carter has logged millions of miles and visited

<h2 id="former-us-president-jimmy-carter-dies-at-100">Former US
President Jimmy Carter dies at 100</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Atlanta, Georgia  — VOA Correspondent Kane Farabaugh conducted
numerous interviews with Jimmy Carter on issues ranging from his time in
the White House to his post-presidential career as a promoter of global
health and democracy. Highlights of those interviews are contained in
this report.</p>
<p>Former President Jimmy Carter, a peanut farmer and Georgia state
governor before becoming president, has died at the age of 100.</p>
<p>When Carter took the oath of office as president of the United States
on January 20, 1977, he promised a “government as good as its
people.”</p>
<p>He presided over four turbulent years. Rising inflation and growing
unemployment marred the domestic priorities of his administration. He
scored victories in foreign policy with a peace agreement between Egypt
and Israel and the Panama Canal treaty. However, a hostage crisis in
Iran dominated his final years in the White House and contributed to his
defeat in the 1980 general election.</p>
<p>But Carter liked to say the end of his presidency in 1981 was the
beginning of a new life, traveling the world “fighting disease, building
hope, and waging peace.”</p>
<p>“It has turned out to open up for me and my wife, Rosalynn, a new
arena of excitement and unpredictability and adventure and challenge and
gratification,” he told VOA.</p>
<p>As the head of the Carter Center, the Carters traveled to more than
80 countries monitoring troubled elections, mediating disputes, and
fighting diseases. This active post-White House life eventually led to
the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002.</p>
<p>“I look upon the Carter Center work as an extension of what I tried
to do as president. You know, we brought peace between Israel and Egypt.
We opened up a humongous relationship with Latin America with the Panama
Canal treaty,” he said. “So what I have done since then has been kind of
an extension. But I do not think there is any doubt that when I won the
Nobel Peace Prize, for instance, it was because of the work of the
Carter Center. So, I would be perfectly satisfied to have a legacy based
on peace and human rights. I mean, who would not?”</p>
<p>United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres praised Carter’s
“commitment to international peace and human rights.</p>
<p>“President Carter will be remembered for his solidarity with the
vulnerable, his abiding grace, and his unrelenting faith in the common
good and our common humanity,” Guterres said in a statement. “His legacy
as a peacemaker, human rights champion and humanitarian will
endure.”</p>
<p>The White House released a statement from President Joe Biden and
first lady Jill Biden on Sunday: “Over six decades, we had the honor of
calling Jimmy Carter a dear friend. But, what’s extraordinary about
Jimmy Carter, though, is that millions of people throughout America and
the world who never met him thought of him as a dear friend as
well.”</p>
<p>Biden also declared January 9, 2025, as a National Day of Mourning in
honor of Carter and directed flags at public buildings to be displayed
at half-staff for 30 days.</p>
<p>President-elect Donald Trump posted on Truth Social: “The challenges
Jimmy faced as President came at a pivotal time for our country and he
did everything in his power to improve the lives of all Americans. For
that, we all owe him a debt of gratitude.”</p>
<p>Carter’s journey to the White House began in the small town of
Plains, Georgia, where he was born October 1, 1924.</p>
<p>After serving as an officer in the U.S. Navy, where he helped develop
the post-World War II nuclear submarine fleet, Carter returned to his
hometown in 1953 to run the family peanut-farming business.</p>
<p>He entered politics in the 1960s, serving two terms as a Georgia
legislator before becoming the state’s 76th governor from 1971 to
1975.</p>
<p>In the 1976 presidential election, Carter, a Democrat, ran against
Republican incumbent Gerald Ford, who assumed the presidency after
Richard Nixon resigned in the wake of the Watergate scandal. Carter
narrowly defeated Ford to become president.</p>
<p>The high point of Carter’s presidency came in 1978. Carter brought
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin
to the Camp David presidential retreat in rural Maryland to negotiate a
peace treaty.</p>
<p>“When I became president, there had been four wars between Arabs and
Israelis in the previous 25 years, with the Egyptians in the leadership
supported by the Soviet Union,” he said. “They were the only country
that could really challenge Israel militarily. And we had success in
getting a treaty between Israel and Egypt … not a word of which has ever
been violated.”</p>
<p>Carter also negotiated a treaty turning control of the Panama Canal
over to the Panamanian government and normalized diplomatic relations
with the People’s Republic of China.</p>
<p>But in 1979 the primary focus for Carter’s administration turned to
Iran, where a revolution led by religious clerics toppled the government
of the U.S. backed shah, who eventually fled to the United States, where
he received treatment for cancer.</p>
<p>On November 4, 1979, militants angry with the U.S. for harboring the
deposed shah stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, taking 66 Americans
hostage. Thirteen were released weeks later but what was referred to by
the U.S. as the hostage crisis extended through the rest of Carter’s
presidency.</p>
<p>Five months into the crisis, in April 1980, Carter authorized a
complex military operation to free the remaining hostages. Dubbed
Operation Eagle Claw, the plan called for several helicopters and
military aircraft to stage at a site in the Iranian desert. Carter, who
approved the plan, explained to VOA that the helicopters carrying
members of the U.S. military’s elite Delta Force, were to fly from there
to the U.S. embassy in Tehran, free the hostages and return to the
waiting aircraft that would fly them out of Iran.</p>
<p>“The minimum number of helicopters required would be six very large
helicopters. So I decided to send eight. One of the helicopters, in an
inexplicable way, turned around and went back to the aircraft carrier.
Another one went down in a sandstorm in the Iranian desert. The third
one developed a hydraulic leak and ran into one of the C-130 airplanes,”
he said.</p>
<p>The aborted mission ended in failure. Eight U.S. military members and
one Iranian civilian died as a result of the crash. Walter Mondale,
Carter’s vice president, told VOA that day was the lowest point of their
administration.</p>
<p>“When that rescue mission failed and lives were lost. I mean, that
was just … we were just morose that day and for some time after that,”
Mondale said. Secretary of State Cyrus Vance resigned in protest of the
operation.</p>
<p>The failure of the mission damaged Carter’s credibility with the
American public. The incident occurred seven months before the 1980
presidential election and contributed to Carter’s defeat to challenger
Ronald Reagan.</p>
<p>“The exact anniversary of the hostages being taken was Election Day,”
Carter said. “Of course, the news media were completely obsessed with
the anniversary of the hostages being taken and the fact that I had not
been able to get them out. That was the number one issue that caused me
to fail.”</p>
<p>The hostages were freed the day Reagan became president.</p>
<p>In 1981, Carter returned to Plains, unsure about the direction of his
post-presidential life. His plans for a library and museum were
initially modest.</p>
<p>“I envisioned it to be a tiny thing, where I would have an office and
some nice buildings in Atlanta. And that anyone in the world that had an
ongoing conflict or potential conflict could come to me and I would help
them mediate the dispute and stop a war,” he said.</p>
<p>The Carter Center, under his direction, monitored more then 80
troubled elections and mediated disputes ranging from a nuclear standoff
with North Korea in 1994, to a peace agreement between Uganda and Sudan
in 1999. The center is also a leader in promoting health and fighting
disease in the poorest parts of the planet.</p>
<p>In one of many interviews with Voice of America, Carter reflected on
his life in and out of the White House. He said the greatest part of his
legacy wasn’t his accomplishments as president or the Nobel Peace Prize,
but the eradication of Guinea worm disease.</p>
<p>“There’s only been one disease in the history of humankind, ever
eradicated, and that was smallpox,” he said, “So Guinea worm is going to
soon be the second disease in history, to be wiped off the face of the
earth.”</p>
<p>Thanks to Carter’s efforts, there were only 13 cases of Guinea worm
recorded in 2022.</p>
<p>Carter led an active life until the age of 99, surviving brain cancer
in 2015.</p>
<p>Declining health and the 2020 global coronavirus pandemic kept him
confined to his hometown of Plains in his final years.</p>
<p>Jimmy Carter last appeared in public during funeral services for his
wife, Rosalynn, in November 2023.</p>
<p>In one of his last public media appearances, Carter shared with VOA
his hopes for the Carter Center’s future.</p>
<p>“I would like to see the United States in the future strive to be the
number one champion in the world of peace and human rights and
environmental quality, and I would say treating everyone equal,” he
said. “If we could do that, we would have a real superpower in the
country I love very much.”</p>
<p>Jimmy Carter lived the longest of any occupant of the White House,
and his 76-year marriage to wife Rosalynn is the longest of any
president and first lady.</p>
<p>Though his final resting place will be on the grounds of his home in
Plains, Georgia, the work and the words of Carter live on in the pages
of the dozens of books he authored throughout his life. It includes his
memoirs, a fiction novel, controversial examinations of the Middle East,
and a collection of his favorite poems.</p>

and ‘Mufasa’ battle for No. 1 at holiday box office</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Two family films dominated the holiday box office this week, with
“Sonic the Hedgehog 3” winning the three-day weekend over “Mufasa” by a
blue hair.</p>
<p>Paramount’s Sonic movie earned $38 million, while “Mufasa” brought in
$37.1 million from theaters in the U.S. and Canada, according to studio
estimates Sunday. On a normal weekend counting Friday, Saturday and
Sunday ticket purchases, the winner would be somewhat clear. But when
the Christmas holiday falls on a Wednesday as it did this year, the
studios look at two sets of numbers: The five-day earnings and the
three-day weekend earnings. With the five-day tally, The Walt Disney
Co.’s “Mufasa” had the edge, bringing in $63.8 million.</p>
<p>It all adds up to a rather robust theatrical landscape, helped by the
continued success of “Wicked” and “Moana 2,” which are on their sixth
and fifth weekends, respectively.</p>
<p>The vampire horror “Nosferatu” also debuted triumphantly. Robert
Eggers’ modern reimagining of a 1922 silent film starring Nicholas Hoult
and Lily-Rose Depp rose to the top of a starry batch of Christmas Day
newcomers, which included the Bob Dylan biopic “A Complete Unknown,”
with Timothée Chalamet; the erotic drama “Babygirl” with Nicole Kidman;
and “The Fire Inside,” about boxer Claressa Shields.</p>
<p>“Nosferatu” landed in third place with $21.2 million from the weekend
and $40.3 million from its first five days. Not accounting for
inflation, it had the best Christmas Day opening ever for a genre film,
with $11.6 million (besting “The Faculty’s” $4.4 million in 1998). Focus
Features released the R-rated film in 2,992 theaters. </p>
<p>It was a gamble to open “Nosferatu” on Christmas, when family films
or all-ages blockbusters tend to be prioritized. But it paid off,
attracting the coveted 18 to 34-year-old demographic to theaters.</p>
<p>“It was a risky move, but we knew that we had such a great film,”
said Lisa Bunnell, who leads distribution for Focus Features. “A lot of
people thought we were insane. But I think the more that people thought
we were crazy, the more we all felt like it was the right thing to
do.”</p>
<p>The response to the unconventional counterprogramming was gratifying.
The sarcophagus-inspired popcorn buckets are even reselling for over
$100.</p>
<p>“People keep talking about ‘how do we get people back into the
movies?’ I think the only way you can get people to go back is to shake
it up,” Bunnell said. “You don’t just spoon feed them the same things
over and over again.”</p>
<p>The Bob Dylan movie, directed by James Mangold, also got off to a
bright start with $11.6 million over the weekend and $23.2 million since
Christmas. The 5-day total is a record for Searchlight Pictures since
Disney acquired the company in early 2019. It’s been well received by
both critics (96% on Rotten Tomatoes) and audiences (A on CinemaScore)
and will likely get more of a boost from the awards race.</p>
<p>“Babygirl,” an A24 release from filmmaker Halina Reijn, played on
2115 screens, earning $4.4 million over the weekend and $7.2 million
since Christmas. The film stars Kidman as a married, buttoned-up CEO who
begins an affair with a young intern at the company, played by Harris
Dickinson. Kidman won the best acting prize for her performance at the
Venice Film Festival.</p>
<p>“The Fire Inside,” from Amazon MGM Studios, meanwhile got a bit lost
in the mix despite strong reviews. It has earned a total of $4.3
million, with $2 million coming from weekend shows where it played in
2006 theaters.</p>
<p>Thanksgiving releases continued to perform well through the Christmas
timeframe. Fourth place went to “Wicked,” which earned another $19.5
million, bringing its domestic total to $424.2 million. On Tuesday, the
lavish movie musical will also be available to rent or purchase at home.
It’s a move that has drawn some critics who believe making it available
at home after only 40 days in theaters will cannibalize profits.</p>
<p>“Moana 2” rounded out the top five films this weekend with $18.2
million. The Disney movie has made $882.5 million globally and is
closing in on $400 million domestically.</p>
<p>Christmas Day itself was massive for the industry, with $61 million
in ticket sales. Thursday was nearly as big, with $50 million.</p>
<p>“Every day was like Saturday at the box office because of the way the
holidays lined up,” said Paul Dergarabedian, Comscore’s senior media
analyst.</p>
<p>Comscore is projecting that the year will net out with about $8.75
billion in domestic box office receipts. That’s down about 3.3% from
last year, which cracked $9 billion, and the pre-pandemic normal of $11
billion.</p>
<p>Final domestic figures will be released Monday. Estimated ticket
sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according
to Comscore, are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>“Sonic the Hedgehog 3,” $38 million.</p></li>
<li><p>“Mufasa: The Lion King,” $37.1 million.</p></li>
<li><p>“Nosferatu,” $21.2 million.</p></li>

id="will-new-years-eve-be-loud-or-quiet-what-are-the-top-2025-resolutions">Will
New Year’s Eve be loud or quiet? What are the top 2025 resolutions?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New york — If you’re planning on ringing in the new year quietly at
home, you’re not alone.</p>
<p>A majority of U.S adults intend to celebrate New Year’s Eve at home,
according to a new poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public
Affairs Research.</p>
<p>“As I’ve gotten older over the last few years, it’s like if I don’t
make it to midnight, it’s not a big deal, you know?” says Carla Woods,
70, from Vinton, Iowa.</p>
<p>Nearly 2 in 10 will be celebrating at a friend or family member’s
home, and just 5% plan to go out to celebrate at a bar, restaurant or
organized event, the poll found.</p>
<p>But many U.S. adults will celebrate the new year in a different way —
by making a resolution. More than half say they’ll make at least one
resolution for 2025.</p>
<p>There’s some optimism about the year ahead, although more than half
aren’t expecting a positive change. About 4 in 10 say 2025 will be a
better year for them personally. About one-third don’t expect much of a
difference between 2024 and 2025, and about one-quarter think 2025 will
be a worse year than 2024.</p>
<p>Relaxed New Year’s Eve plans for many</p>
<p>Kourtney Kershaw, a 32-year-old bartender in Chicago, often fields
questions from customers and friends about upcoming events for New
Year’s Eve. She said this year is trending toward low-key.</p>
<p>“A majority of who I’ve spoken to in my age range, they want to go
out, but they don’t know what they’re going to do because they haven’t
found anything or things are just really expensive,” she said. “Party
packages or an entry fee are like a turnoff, especially with the climate
of the world and how much things cost.”</p>
<p>As expected, younger people are more interested in ringing in the new
year at a bar or organized event — about 1 in 10 U.S. adults under 30
say they plan to do that. But about 3 in 10 older adults — 60 and above
— say they won’t celebrate the beginning of 2025 at all.</p>
<p>Anthony Tremblay, 35, from Pittsburgh, doesn’t usually go out to
toast the arrival of the new year, but this year he’s got something
special cooked up: He and his wife will be traveling through
Ireland.</p>
<p>“I don’t do anything too crazy for New Year’s, usually. So this is
definitely a change,” he said. “I wanted to do something unique this
year, so I did.”</p>
<p>Woods will be working New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day. She answers
calls on The Iowa Warmline, a confidential, noncrisis listening line for
people struggling with mental health or substance use issues.</p>
<p>“Holidays are really hard for people, so I don’t mind working,” she
said. “I’m passionate about it because I have mental health issues in
the family and so being able to help people is rewarding to me.”</p>
<p>Younger Americans are more likely to make a resolution</p>
<p>Every New Year’s also triggers the eternal debate about resolutions.
A majority of U.S. adults say they intend to make a New Year’s
resolution of some type, but millennials and Gen Z are especially likely
to be on board — about two-thirds expect to do so, compared to about
half of older adults. Women are also more likely than men to say they
will set a goal for 2025.</p>
<p>Tremblay hopes to lose some weight and focus more on self-care — more
sleep, meditation and breathing exercises. “It’s probably a good year to
focus on mental health,” he said.</p>
<p>Many others agree. About 3 in 10 adults choose resolutions involving
exercise or eating healthier. About one-quarter said they’ll make a
resolution involving losing weight and a similar number said they’ll
resolve to make changes about priorities of money or mental health.</p>
<p>Woods’ resolutions are to stay social and active. As a mental health
counselor, she knows those are key to a happy 2025 and beyond: “Probably
one of my biggest resolutions is trying to make sure I stay social, try
to get out at least once a week — get out and either have coffee or do
something with a friend. That’s not only for the physical but also for
the mental health part.”</p>
<p>Kershaw, the bartender, says weight loss and better health are the
top resolutions she hears people make. “Mental health is the new one,
but I think it’s high up there as well as with regular health,” she
said.</p>
<p>She prefers more goal-oriented resolutions and, this time, it’s to do
more traveling and see more of the world: “I don’t know if that’s really
a resolution, but that’s a goal that I’m setting.”</p>
<p>And how will she welcome the arrival of 2025? Usually, she takes the
night off and stays home watching movies with plenty of snacks, but this
year Kershaw has a different plan, maybe one of the most Chicago things
you can do.</p>
<p>This die-hard sports fan will be at Wrigley Field on Tuesday watching
the Chicago Blackhawks take on the St. Louis Blues. “Hockey’s my
favorite sport. So I will be watching hockey and bringing in the new
year,” she said.</p>

in Texas, Mississippi kill 2 and injure 6 as severe weather system moves
east</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Houston, Texas — A strong storm system threatened to whip up
tornadoes in parts of the U.S. Southeast on Sunday, a day after severe
weather claimed at least two lives as twisters touched down in Texas and
Mississippi. </p>
<p>The National Weather Service’s severe storm tracker indicated the
system was moving east through Alabama into Georgia shortly before 4
a.m. The agency issued severe thunder storm warnings with the
possibility of tornadoes in western Georgia, the northwestern tip of
Florida and elsewhere. </p>
<p>On Saturday, one person died in the Liverpool area, located south of
Houston, Texas. Four people suffered injuries that were not considered
critical, according to Madison Polston of the Brazoria County Sheriff’s
Office. </p>
<p>There were “multiple touchdown points” in the county between
Liverpool, Hillcrest Village and Alvin. Officials knew of around 10
damaged homes but were working to determine the extent of the damage,
Polston said. </p>
<p>In Mississippi, one person died in Adams County and two people were
injured in Franklin County, according to the Mississippi Emergency
Management Agency. </p>
<p>The National Weather Service said two tornadoes hit around Bude and
the city of Brandon, ripping roofs from several buildings. </p>
<p>It appeared at least six tornadoes touched down in the Houston area,
though more may be discovered when crews go out to survey the damage.
There was damage in the area from both tornadoes and straight-line
winds, according to Josh Lichter, meteorologist with the National
Weather Service. </p>
<p>North of Houston, mobile homes were damaged or destroyed in Katy and
Porter Heights, where the doors of a fire station were blown in, the
weather service said. </p>
<p>Storm damage has been reported in the northern Alabama town of
Athens, just northwest of Huntsville. A National Weather Service survey
team was expected to begin assessing damage Sunday morning, said
meteorologist Chelly Amin. </p>
<p>Also Sunday, the National Weather Service issued severe thunderstorm
warnings across portions of the Deep South as the line of storms
barreled east through Alabama, Georgia and into South Carolina. Wind
gusts of 60 mph (97 kph) were expected in the Spartanburg, South
Carolina, area. Damage to trees and powerlines was expected in a number
of counties, while a tornada watch was in effect for some parts of the
state. </p>
<p>At 9 a.m. Sunday ET, nearly 65,000 customers were without power in
Mississippi, down from 93,000 around 1 a.m., according to electric
utility tracking website PowerOutage.us. Some 54,000 customers were
without power in Georgia; 36,000, Alabama; 20,000, Louisiana; and
13,000, Texas.</p>

id="north-koreas-kim-vows-toughest-anti-us-policy-before-trump-takes-office">North
Korea’s Kim vows toughest anti-US policy before Trump takes office</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said he will
implement the “toughest” anti-U.S. policy, less than a month before
Donald Trump takes office as U.S. president, the country’s state media
reported Sunday.</p>
<p>Trump’s return to the White House raises prospects for high-profile
diplomacy with North Korea. During his first term, Trump met Kim three
times for talks on the North’s nuclear program. Many experts however say
a quick resumption of Kim-Trump summitry is unlikely as Trump would
first focus on conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. North Korea’s
support for Russia’s war against Ukraine also poses a challenge to
efforts to revive diplomacy, experts say.</p>
<p>During a five-day plenary meeting of the ruling Workers’ Party that
ended Friday, Kim called the U.S. “the most reactionary state that
regards anti-communism as its invariable state policy.” Kim said that
the U.S.-South Korea-Japan security partnership is expanding into “a
nuclear military bloc for aggression.”</p>
<p>“This reality clearly shows to which direction we should advance and
what we should do and how,” Kim said, according to the official Korean
Central News Agency.</p>
<p>It said Kim’s speech “clarified the strategy for the toughest
anti-U.S. counteraction to be launched aggressively” by North Korea for
its long-term national interests and security.</p>
<p>KCNA didn’t elaborate on the anti-U.S. strategy. But it said Kim set
forth tasks to bolster military capability through defense technology
advancements and stressed the need to improve the mental toughness of
North Korean soldiers.</p>
<p>The previous meetings between Trump and Kim had not only put an end
to their exchanges of fiery rhetoric and threats of destruction, but
they developed personal connections. Trump once famously said he and Kim
“fell in love.” But their talks eventually collapsed in 2019, as they
wrangled over U.S.-led sanctions on the North.</p>
<p>North Korea has since sharply increased the pace of its weapons
testing activities to build more reliable nuclear missiles targeting the
U.S. and its allies. The U.S. and South Korea have responded by
expanding their military bilateral drills and also trilateral ones
involving Japan, drawing strong rebukes from the North, which views such
U.S.-led exercises as invasion rehearsals.</p>
<p>Further complicating efforts to get North Korea to rid itself of
nuclear weapons is its deepening military cooperation with Russia.</p>
<p>According to U.S., Ukrainian and South Korean assessments, North
Korea has sent more than 10,000 troops and conventional weapons systems
to support Moscow’s war against Ukraine. There are concerns that Russia
could give North Korea advanced weapons technology in return, including
help to build more powerful nuclear missiles.</p>
<p>Russia and China, locked in separate disputes with the U.S., have
repeatedly blocked U.S.-led pushes to levy more U.N. sanctions on North
Korea despite its repeated missile tests in defiance of U.N. Security
Council resolutions.</p>
<p>Last month, Kim said that his past negotiations with the United
States only confirmed Washington’s “unchangeable” hostility toward his
country and described his nuclear buildup as the only way to counter
external threats.</p>

id="ai-technology-helps-level-playing-field-for-students-with-disabilities">AI
technology helps level playing field for students with disabilities</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>For Makenzie Gilkison, spelling is such a struggle that a word like
rhinoceros might come out as “rineanswsaurs” or sarcastic as
“srkastik.” </p>
<p>The 14-year-old from suburban Indianapolis can sound out words, but
her dyslexia makes the process so draining that she often struggles with
comprehension.</p>
<p>“I just assumed I was stupid,” she recalled of her early grade school
years. </p>
<p>But assistive technology powered by artificial intelligence has
helped her keep up with classmates. Last year, Makenzie was named to the
National Junior Honor Society. She credits a customized AI-powered
chatbot, a word prediction program and other tools that can read for
her. </p>
<p>“I would have just probably given up if I didn’t have them,” she
said. </p>
<p>New tech; countless possibilities</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence holds the promise of helping countless 
students with a range of visual, speech, language and hearing
impairments to execute tasks that come easily to others. Schools
everywhere have been wrestling with how and where to incorporate AI, but
many are fast-tracking applications for students with disabilities. </p>
<p>Getting the latest technology into the hands of students with
disabilities is a priority for the U.S. Education Department, which has
told schools they must consider whether students need tools like
text-to-speech and alternative communication devices. New rules from the
Department of Justice also will require schools and other government
entities to make apps and online content accessible to those with
disabilities. </p>
<p>There is concern about how to ensure students using it — including
those with disabilities — are still learning. </p>
<p>Students can use artificial intelligence to summarize jumbled
thoughts into an outline, summarize complicated passages, or even
translate Shakespeare into common English. And computer-generated voices
that can read passages for visually impaired and dyslexic students are
becoming less robotic and more natural. </p>
<p>“I’m seeing that a lot of students are kind of exploring on their
own, almost feeling like they’ve found a cheat code in a video game,”
said Alexis Reid, an educational therapist in the Boston area who works
with students with learning disabilities. But in her view, it is far
from cheating: “We’re meeting students where they are.” </p>
<p>Programs fortify classroom lessons </p>
<p>Ben Snyder, a 14-year-old freshman from Larchmont, New York, who was
recently diagnosed with a learning disability, has been increasingly
using AI to help with homework. </p>
<p>“Sometimes in math, my teachers will explain a problem to me, but it
just makes absolutely no sense,” he said. “So if I plug that problem
into AI, it’ll give me multiple different ways of explaining how to do
that.” </p>
<p>He likes a program called Question AI. Earlier in the day, he asked
the program to help him write an outline for a book report — a task he
completed in 15 minutes that otherwise would have taken him an hour and
a half because of his struggles with writing and organization. But he
does think using AI to write the whole report crosses a line. </p>
<p>“That’s just cheating,” Ben said. </p>
<p>Schools weigh pros, cons </p>
<p>Schools have been trying to balance the technology’s benefits against
the risk that it will do too much. If a special education plan sets
reading growth as a goal, the student needs to improve that skill. AI
can’t do it for them, said Mary Lawson, general counsel at the Council
of the Great City Schools. </p>
<p>But the technology can help level the playing field for students with
disabilities, said Paul Sanft, director of a Minnesota-based center
where families can try out different assistive technology tools and
borrow devices. </p>
<p>“There are definitely going to be people who use some of these tools
in nefarious ways. That’s always going to happen,” Sanft said. “But I
don’t think that’s the biggest concern with people with disabilities,
who are just trying to do something that they couldn’t do before.” </p>
<p>Another risk is that AI will track students into less rigorous
courses of study. And, because it is so good at identifying patterns, AI
might be able to figure out a student has a disability. Having that
disclosed by AI and not the student or their family could create ethical
dilemmas, said Luis Perez, the disability and digital inclusion lead at
CAST, formerly the Center for Applied Specialized Technology. </p>
<p>Schools are using the technology to help students who struggle
academically, even if they do not qualify for special education
services. In Iowa, a new law requires students deemed not proficient —
about a quarter of them — to get an individualized reading plan. As part
of that effort, the state’s education department spent $3 million on an
AI-driven personalized tutoring program. When students struggle, a
digital avatar intervenes. </p>
<p>Educators anticipate more tools </p>
<p>The U.S. National Science Foundation is funding AI research and
development. One firm is developing tools to help children with speech
and language difficulties. Called the National AI Institute for
Exceptional Education, it is headquartered at the University of Buffalo,
which did pioneering work on handwriting recognition that helped the
U.S. Postal Service save hundreds of millions of dollars by automating
processing. </p>
<p>“We are able to solve the postal application with very high accuracy.
When it comes to children’s handwriting, we fail very badly,” said Venu
Govindaraju, the director of the institute. He sees it as an area that
needs more work, along with speech-to-text technology, which isn’t as
good at understanding children’s voices, particularly if there is a
speech impediment. </p>
<p>Sorting through the sheer number of programs developed by education
technology companies can be a time-consuming challenge for schools.
Richard Culatta, CEO of the International Society for Technology in
Education, said the nonprofit launched an effort this fall to make it
easier for districts to vet what they are buying and ensure it is
accessible. </p>
<p>Mother sees potential</p>
<p>Makenzie wishes some of the tools were easier to use. Sometimes a
feature will inexplicably be turned off, and she will be without it for
a week while the tech team investigates. The challenges can be so
cumbersome that some students resist the technology entirely. </p>
<p>But Makenzie’s mother, Nadine Gilkison, who works as a technology
integration supervisor at Franklin Township Community School Corporation
in Indiana, said she sees more promise than downside. </p>
<p>In September, her district rolled out chatbots to help special
education students in high school. She said teachers, who sometimes
struggled to provide students the help they needed, became emotional
when they heard about the program. Until now, students were reliant on
someone to help them, unable to move ahead on their own. </p>
<p>“Now we don’t need to wait anymore,” she said.</p>

id="what-is-the-native-american-church-and-why-is-peyote-sacred-to-members">What
is the Native American Church and why is peyote sacred to members?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The Native American Church is considered the most widespread
religious movement among the Indigenous people of North America. It
holds sacred the peyote cactus, which grows naturally only in some parts
of southern Texas and northern Mexico. Peyote has been used spiritually
in ceremonies, and as a medicine by Native American people for
millennia.</p>
<p>It contains several psychoactive compounds, primarily mescaline,
which is a hallucinogen. Different tribes of peyote people have their
own name for the cactus. While it is still a controlled substance, U.S.
laws passed in 1978 and 1994 allow Native Americans to use, harvest and
transport peyote. However, these laws only allow federally recognized
Native American tribes to use the substance and don’t apply to the
broader group of Indigenous people in the United States.</p>
<p>The Native American Church developed into a distinct way of life
around 1885 among the Kiowa and Comanche of Oklahoma. After 1891, it
began to spread as far north as Canada. Now, more than 50 tribes and
400,000 people practice it. In general, the peyotist doctrine espouses
belief in one supreme God who deals with humans through various spirits
that then carry prayers to God. In many tribes, the peyote plant itself
is a deity, personified as Peyote Spirit.</p>
<p>Why was the Native American Church incorporated?</p>
<p>The Native American Church is not one unified entity like, say, the
Catholic Church. It contains a diversity of tribes, beliefs and
practices. Peyote is what unifies them. After peyote was banned by U.S.
government agents in 1888 and later by 15 states, Native American tribes
began incorporating as individual Native American Churches in 1918.</p>
<p>In order to preserve the peyote ceremony, the federal and state
governments encouraged Native American people to organize as a church,
said Darrell Red Cloud, the great-great grandson of Chief Red Cloud of
the Lakota Nation and vice president of the Native American Church of
North America.</p>
<p>In the following decades, the religion grew significantly, with
several churches bringing Jesus Christ’s name and image into the church
so their congregations and worship would be accepted, said Steve Moore,
who is non-Native and was formerly a staff attorney at the Native
American Rights Fund.</p>
<p>“Local religious leaders in communities would see the image of Jesus,
a Bible or cross on the wall of the meeting house or tipi and they would
hear references to Jesus in the prayers or songs,” he said. “That
probably helped persuade the authorities that the Native people were in
the process of transformation to Christianity.”</p>
<p>This persecution of peyote people continued even after the formation
of the Native American Church, said Frank Dayish Jr. a former Navajo
Nation vice president and chairperson for the Council of the Peyote Way
of Life Coalition.</p>
<p>In the 1960s, there were laws prohibiting peyote in the Navajo
Nation, he said. Dayish remembers a time during that period when police
confiscated peyote from his church, poured gasoline on the plants and
set them on fire.</p>
<p>“I remember my dad and other relatives went over and saved the green
peyote that didn’t burn,” he said, adding that it took decades of
lobbying until an amendment to the American Indian Religious Freedom Act
in 1994 permitted members of federally recognized Native American tribes
to use peyote for religious purposes.</p>
<p>How is peyote used in the Native American Church?</p>
<p>Peyote is the central part of a ceremony that takes place in a tipi
around a crescent-shaped earthen altar mound and a sacred fire. The
ceremony typically lasts all night and includes prayer, singing, the
sacramental eating of peyote, water rites and spiritual
contemplation.</p>
<p>Morgan Tosee, a member of the Comanche Nation who leads ceremonies
within the Comanche Native American Church, said peyote is utilized in
the context of prayer — not smoked — as many tend to imagine.</p>
<p>“When we use it, we either eat it dry or grind it up,” he said.
“Sometimes, we make tea out of it. But, we don’t drink it like regular
tea. You pray with it and take little sips, like you would take
medicine.”</p>
<p>Tosee echoes the belief that pervades the church: “If you take care
of the peyote, it will take care of you.”</p>
<p>“And if you believe in it, it will heal you,” he said, adding that he
has seen the medicine work, healing people with various ailments.</p>
<p>People treat the trip to harvest peyote as a pilgrimage, said Red
Cloud. Typically, prayers and ceremonies take place before the
pilgrimage to seek blessings for a good journey. Once they get to the
peyote gardens, they would touch the ground and thank the Creator before
harvesting the medicine. The partaking of peyote is also accompanied by
prayer and ceremony. The mescaline in the peyote plant is viewed as
God’s spirit, Red Cloud said.</p>
<p>“Once we eat it, the sacredness of the medicine is inside of us and
it opens the spiritual eye,” he said. “From there, we start to see where
the medicine is growing. It shows itself to us. Once we complete the
harvest, we bring it back home and have another ceremony to the medicine
and give thanks to the Creator.”</p>

zoo welcomes newborn pygmy hippopotamus as year ends</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>richmond, virginia — A female pygmy hippopotamus delivered a healthy
calf at the Metro Richmond Zoo earlier this month, officials said — the
third baby hippo born at the zoo within the past five years. </p>
<p>The mother, Iris, gave birth to the female calf on December 9
following a seven-month gestation, zoo officials said. The newborn, who
has yet to be named, is the third calf for Iris and the father,
Corwin.</p>
<p>One of the calves born previously was also a December baby, the zoo
said.</p>
<p>“Most people don’t get a hippopotamus for Christmas at all, so we
feel lucky to have received two over the years,” zoo officials said in a
news release Tuesday. </p>
<p>Five days after her birth, the baby had a neonatal exam and weighed
6.8 kilograms. Officials said that fully grown pygmy hippos can weigh up
to 270 kilograms. </p>
<p>According to the Richmond-area zoo, pygmy hippos are an endangered
West African species, and only 2,500 mature hippos remain in the wild.
Officials said pygmy hippos are distinctive from regular hippos because
they do not live in groups and are usually solitary or in pairs. </p>
<p>“For this reason, once Iris’ two previous calves grew up, they were
moved to other zoological facilities to live with future mates and
continue contributing to the conservation of their species,” the news
release said.</p>

id="elaborate-holiday-light-displays-are-making-spirits-bright-in-a-big-way">Elaborate
holiday light displays are making spirits bright in a big way</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CONCORD, New Hampshire — Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow might be
enough to brighten some homes this holiday season. But others are
adorned with thousands of blinking lights synched to blasting music,
drawing crowds and bolstering both holiday and community spirit. </p>
<p>In a cul-de-sac in Mesa, Arizona, 14 homeowners have been going all
out on holiday lights for the last 30 years in a tradition that hasn’t
been diminished by real estate turnover. </p>
<p>Those buying homes in the neighborhood often find the attics full of
decor left behind as a gift from the previous owners, and despite
cultural and religious differences, residents come together to create a
festival of lights, Stephanie Castillo Price said. </p>
<p>“Everybody has been able to take their interpretation of the holidays
and put it into a full circle,” she said. “There’s not somebody that’s
going to walk down the street and not feel included.” </p>
<p>In Santa Clarita, California, residents of Wakefield Court decided to
coordinate their holiday light displays as a way to bring some joy to
their community after an earthquake. Now in its 30th year, the Wakefield
Winter Wonderland includes inflatable figures and wooden cutouts of a
variety of characters, from Mickey Mouse to Homer Simpson. </p>
<p>Bryan Cobb admits he initially was against buying a home in the
neighborhood when he and his wife first viewed it. </p>
<p>“She started crying and said, ‘But this is the Christmas street! I
want to live there!’” he said. “She got her way. We live here, we love
it. All the neighbors bond together.” </p>
<p>In Edmond, Oklahoma, those looking to the western sky will easily
spot the Miranda family’s elaborate holiday light display featuring
images and music from the movie “Wicked.” Spotlights reminiscent of
movie studio lights shoot up from the roof, while a singing witch’s face
takes shape across a towering tree. </p>
<p>“It just seemed like the perfect fit with a light show because you
can really do the drama with the lights,” said Elisabeth Miranda, who
handles the programming while her husband, Mark, tackles installation.
“It takes a very long time to set up. Every single bulb has a spot, a
place, a number, so that when we program it, it does exactly what it
needs to do at the right time.” </p>
<p>The family started putting up holiday lights in 2015 and saw a surge
in traffic after being featured on ABC’s “The Great Christmas Light
Fight.” While most neighbors have been supportive, a few complaints
prompted the couple to take a few years off before returning with a
better plan to limit viewing hours and control traffic. </p>
<p>This year, they are collecting donations for the Oklahoma Fraternal
Order of Police. </p>
<p>“They give so much back to our community, so that’s our little way of
saying thank you to them for everything they do for us,” Miranda
said. </p>
<p>Charity also is a component in Las Vegas, where Laura Walters and
Lenny Standish are closing in on a four-year goal of collecting 10,000
pairs of socks and underwear for organizations that help homeless
people. </p>
<p>Their display started during the COVID-19 pandemic with a single
Christmas tree for community members to add ornaments. This year, they
have three snow machines in addition to the lights and music. </p>
<p>“People are looking for joy,” Walters said. “Our world is a tough
place. So to be able to just come and feel just an incredible amount of
love and happiness — it’s peaceful. We’ve never had one problem here at
all. Everyone’s been highly respectful of our home and full of
gratitude.” </p>
<p>Richard Taylor of Kennesaw, Georgia, estimates that more than 40,000
people visit his display of 1.2 million lights each year. </p>
<p>“We bring joy to a lot of people,” he said. “They walk around and
they forget all their problems, and they just enjoy themselves.”</p>

id="abortions-more-common-in-us-as-women-turn-to-pills-travel">Abortions
more common in US, as women turn to pills, travel</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Abortion has become more common despite bans or deep restrictions in
most Republican-controlled states, and the legal and political fights
over its future are not over yet.</p>
<p>It’s now been two and a half years since the U.S. Supreme Court
overturned Roe v. Wade and opened the door for states to implement
bans.</p>
<p>The policies and their impact have been in flux ever since the ruling
in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization.</p>
<p>Here’s a look at data on where things stand:</p>
<p>Abortions are more common than before Dobbs</p>
<p>Overturning Roe and enforcing abortion bans has changed how woman
obtain abortions in the United States.</p>
<p>One thing it hasn’t done is put a dent in the number of abortions
being obtained.</p>
<p>There have been slightly more monthly abortions across the country
recently than there were in the months leading up to the June 2022
ruling, even as the number in states with bans dropped to near zero.</p>
<p>“Abortion bans don’t actually prevent abortions from happening,” said
Ushma Upadhyay, a public health social scientist at the University of
California San Francisco.</p>
<p>For women in some states, there are major obstacles to getting
abortions — and advocates say that low-income, minority and immigrant
women are least likely to be able to get them when they want.</p>
<p>For those living in states with bans, the ways to access abortion are
through travel or abortion pills.</p>
<p>Pills become bigger part of equation — and legal questions</p>
<p>As the bans happened, abortion pills became a bigger part of the
equation.</p>
<p>They were involved in about half the abortions before Dobbs. More
recently, it’s been closer to two-thirds of them, according to research
by the Guttmacher Institute.</p>
<p>The uptick of that kind of abortion, usually involving a combination
of two drugs, was underway before the ruling.</p>
<p>But now, it’s become more common for pill prescriptions to be made by
telehealth. By the summer of 2024, about 1 in 10 abortions were via
pills prescribed via telehealth to patients in states where abortion is
banned.</p>
<p>As a result, the pills are now at the center of battles over abortion
access.</p>
<p>This month, Texas sued a New York doctor for prescribing pills to a
Texas woman via telemedicine. There’s also an effort by Idaho, Kansas
and Missouri to roll back their federal approvals and treat them as
“controlled dangerous substances,” and a push for the federal government
to start enforcing a 19th-century federal law to ban mailing them.</p>
<p>Travel for abortion has increased</p>
<p>Clinics have closed or halted abortions in states with bans.</p>
<p>A network of efforts to get women seeking abortions to places where
they’re legal has strengthened and travel for abortion is now
common.</p>
<p>The Guttmacher Institute found that more than twice as many Texas
residents obtained abortions in 2023 in New Mexico as New Mexico
residents did. And as many Texans received them in Kansas as
Kansans.</p>
<p>Abortion funds, which benefitted from “rage giving” in 2022, helped
pay the costs for many abortion-seekers. But some funds have had to cap
how much they can give.</p>
<p>The ban that took effect in Florida this year has been a
game-changer</p>
<p>Florida, the nation’s third most-populous state, began on May 1
enforcing a ban on abortions after the first six weeks of pregnancy.</p>
<p>That immediately changed the state from one that was a refuge for
other Southerners seeking abortions to an exporter of people looking for
them.</p>
<p>There were about 30% fewer abortions there in May compared with the
average for the first three months of the year. And in June, there were
35% fewer.</p>
<p>While the ban is not unique, the impact is especially large. The
average driving time from Florida to a facility in North Carolina where
abortion is available for the first 12 weeks of pregnancy is more than
nine hours, according to data maintained by Caitlin Myers, a Middlebury
College economics professor.</p>
<p>Clinics have opened or expanded in some places</p>
<p>The bans have meant clinics closed or stopped offering abortions in
some states.</p>
<p>But some states where abortion remains legal until viability –
generally considered to be sometime past 21 weeks of pregnancy — have
seen clinics open and expand.</p>
<p>Illinois, Kansas and New Mexico are among the states with new
clinics.</p>
<p>There were 799 publicly identifiable abortion providers in the U.S.
in May 2022, the month before the Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade.
And by this November, it was 792, according to a tally by Myers, who is
collecting data on abortion providers.</p>
<p>Myers said some hospitals that always provided some abortions have
begun advertising it. So, they’re now in the count of clinics – even
though they might provide few of them.</p>
<p>Lack of access to abortions during emergencies threatens patients’
lives</p>
<p>How hospitals handle pregnancy complications, especially those that
threaten the lives of the women, has emerged as a major issue since Roe
was overturned.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden’s administration said hospitals must offer
abortions when they’re needed to prevent organ loss, hemorrhage or
deadly infections, even in states with bans. Texas is challenging the
administration’s policy and the U.S. Supreme Court this year declined to
take it up after the Biden administration sued Idaho.</p>
<p>More than 100 pregnant women seeking help in emergency rooms were
turned away or left unstable since 2022, The Associated Press found in
an analysis of federal hospital investigative records.</p>
<p>Among the complaints were a woman who miscarried in the lobby
restroom of Texas emergency room after staff refused to see her and a
woman who gave birth in a car after a North Carolina hospital couldn’t
offer an ultrasound. The baby later died.</p>
<p>“It is increasingly less safe to be pregnant and seeking emergency
care in an emergency department,” Dara Kass, an emergency medicine
doctor and former U.S. Health and Human Services official told the AP
earlier this year.</p>

Korea launches ‘toughest’ US strategy during key party meeting</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un held a key
policy-setting meeting of the country’s ruling party last week ahead of
the new year, state media KCNA reported on Sunday. </p>
<p>The meeting of party and government officials decided that North
Korea would launch the “toughest” strategy to counteract the United
States for its security and national interests, the report said, without
elaborating. </p>
<p>The alliance between South Korea, the U.S. and Japan has expanded to
a “nuclear military bloc” and South Korea has become an “anti-communist
outpost” for the U.S., the KCNA report added. </p>
<p>“This reality clearly shows to which direction we should advance and
what we should do and how,” it said. </p>
<p>The December 23-27 meeting also reviewed the handling of floods
earlier this year, including the plan that brought those affected to
Pyongyang, the capital, according to the report. </p>
<p>The reclusive state also vowed to promote relations with “friendly”
countries during the meeting. </p>
<p>Kim also called for progress in defense, science and technology to
bolster the country’s war deterrence.  </p>
<p>Such meetings often last a few days and have been used in recent
years to make key policy announcements. </p>
<p>In a reshuffle, Pyongyang named Pak Thae Song, a party secretary, as
a new premier to replace Kim Tok Hun. </p>
<p>Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui was named a member of the powerful
Politburo of the party’s Central Committee. </p>
<p>The 11th plenary session of the eighth central committee of the
Workers’ Party of Korea wraps up a year in which Russian President
Vladimir Putin held a summit with Kim and signed a deal that included a
mutual defense pledge. </p>
<p>Washington and Seoul have criticized the two countries’ military
cooperation, including what they say is a dispatch of North Korean
troops to fight for Russia in its war against Ukraine.</p>

<h2 id="storms-delay-cancel-thousands-of-flights-across-us">Storms
delay, cancel thousands of flights across US</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Severe weather disrupted holiday travel on Saturday across the United
States with deadly tornadoes in the Southeast and heavy snow and wind on
the West Coast delaying or canceling thousands of flights across the
country. </p>
<p>More than 7,000 flights in the U.S. were delayed on Saturday,
according to the tracking site FlightAware, and more than 200 were
canceled. </p>
<p>About a third of the flights were delayed at Hartsfield-Jackson
International Airport in Atlanta, Georgia, according to FlightAware, and
nearly half of the flights originating from Dallas/Fort Worth
International Airport in Texas and George Bush Intercontinental Airport
in Houston, Texas, were delayed. </p>
<p>At least 10 tornadoes touched down in the U.S. states of Texas,
Louisiana and Mississippi on Saturday, leaving one person dead near
Houston, the National Weather Service and local law enforcement
said. </p>
<p>“Those numbers will probably go up,” said forecaster Aaron Gleason,
with the National Weather Service’s Storm Prediction Center. </p>
<p>The one death and four injuries were reported Saturday in Brazoria
County, Texas, about 45 miles south of Houston, according to the
Brazoria County Sheriff’s Office. </p>
<p>Officials say that many homes and schools were severely damaged or
destroyed. Images on social media show scattered ruins of homes and
snapped trees and utility poles strewn across streets and lawns. </p>
<p>Out west, high winds, with gusts up to 241 kilometers per hour in the
high elevations of the Tahoe Basin in California and 80 kph at lower
elevations hit the area this weekend and with heavy rainfall expected
from San Francisco to Portland, Oregon, forecasters said. </p>
<p>Forecasters said to expect between 10 and 15 centimeters of rain
before New Year’s Eve and up to 3 meters of snow in Lake Tahoe, located
on the border of California and Nevada. </p>
<p>“Damaging winds could blow down trees and power lines,” the Weather
Service warned. “Widespread power outages are possible.”</p>
