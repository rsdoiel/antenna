<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_(TV_series)">The Great</a> on Hulu gives an idea of what a king or queen would be like.

## Another Supply Chain Vulnerability

date: 2025-07-21, updated: 2025-07-19, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>ProPublica is <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/microsoft-digital-escorts-pentagon-defense-department-china-hackers">reporting</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Microsoft is using engineers in China to help maintain the Defense Department&#8217;s computer systems&#8212;with minimal supervision by U.S. personnel&#8212;leaving some of the nation&#8217;s most sensitive data vulnerable to hacking from its leading cyber adversary, a ProPublica investigation has found.</p>
<p>The arrangement, which was critical to Microsoft winning the federal government&#8217;s cloud computing business a decade ago, relies on U.S. citizens with security clearances to oversee the work and serve as a barrier against espionage and sabotage...</p></blockquote>

## Exit Stage Colbert

date: 2025-07-21, from: Om Malik blog

I have a dark cloud over my head about the news that CBS&#160;canceled&#160;Stephen Colbert for “financial reasons,” an explanation no one is buying.Well, unless those financial reasons were the regulatory approval of the Skydance-Paramount deal.&#160; The Wall Street Journal does&#160;its&#160;best&#160;to make a case that&#160;TV is dying.&#160;No&#160;shit, Sherlock!&#160;And that is why Late Night TV is a &#8230;

## Et. Tu FT?

date: 2025-07-21, from: Om Malik blog

A month ago, I&#160;reported&#160;that Apple was in the final stages of acquiring the rights for F1 streaming&#160;following&#160;the success of its movie about the sport. Almost a month later, the Financial Times reported the news. As a matter of&#160;principle,&#160;I am not linking to the&#160;report. As is the case with establishment media, they almost never credit independents, &#8230;

I just got turned on to Paul Ford&#39;s What is Code, from 2015, but still current today. Shoulda been a book, like Neal Stephenson&#39;s In the Beginning Was the Command Line. You can still find the text online, such as here.

## Logarithmical: Zipf’s Law and the mathematics of emoji

date: 2025-07-20, from: Shady Characters blog

<p>Back in the mists of time, <a href="https://shadycharacters.co.uk/2015/10/zipfs-law/">I wrote about a peculiar property of words</a> called Zipf’s Law. The idea is quite simple: the frequency at which different words occur in any large body of work, ordered from the most common to the least common, follows a predictable pattern. This is true across languages, and even in some texts, such as that in the Voynich Manuscript, that we haven’t yet deciphered.<a class="bibcite" id="bibcite_10.1080/0161-110191889932" href="#bibshow_10.1080/0161-110191889932" title="

## 07.19.2025: The Weekend Edition

date: 2025-07-20, from: Om Malik blog

There are certain sweet-smelling, sugarcoated lies current in the world which all politic men have apparently tacitly conspired together to support and perpetuate. One of these is that there is such a thing in the world as independence: independence of thought, independence of opinion, independence of action. — Mark Twain There are two books on &#8230;
