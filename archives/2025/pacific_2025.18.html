its potential, governments need to narrow “digital gaps,” including gaps
in infrastructure, access, and skills, according to a new report by the

midnight on a national public holiday. For a government that rarely
rushes to comment on foreign elections, the timing alone was notable.

<p>date: 2025-05-08, from: Pacific Island Times</p>
<p>   Perhaps to the detriment of the U.S.—or simply
short-sightedness—the Compact of Free Association does not address
deep-sea mining or seabed governance. Worse still, the U.S. has yet to
ratify UNCLOS, the international treaty that governs the world’s oceans.
As a result, the U.S. has no formal seat at the table of
the International Seabed Authority, which oversees deep-sea mining in
international waters. </p>

While the Old World magic in many parts of the city has been plowed under by modern affluence, today&amp;#8217;s Istanbul is every bit as rich and rewarding as it was back then.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>date: 2025-05-03, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON &amp;#8212; President Donald Trump on Friday proposed slashing $163 billion in federal spending next fiscal year, a drastic retrenchment in the role and reach of government that, if enacted, would eliminate a vast set of climate, education, health and housing programs, including some that benefit the poor. Issuing his first budget proposal since returning to office, Trump sketched out a dim view of Washington. His blueprint depicted many core government functions as woke, weaponized, wasteful or radical, as the president looked to justify his request that Congress chop domestic spending to its lowest level in the modern era.&lt;/p&gt;
