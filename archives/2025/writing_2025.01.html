<p>Last week, Dwarkesh Patel put words to an uneasy feeling that
resonated with me: I think we’re at what late February 2020 was for
Covid, but for AI. If you can remember back to February 2020, both the
media and the general public were still in normal-times mode, discussing
Trump’s impeachment, the Democratic primaries and […] The post

In a world where grief often takes center stage, <em>Shrinking</em>
dares to ask: Can healing be funny? Feel-good comedies have long
dominated streaming platforms. From <em>Ted Lasso</em> to <em>Abbott
Elementary</em>, these shows highlight the human condition while
offering viewers comfort and hope. Apple TV’s <em>Shrinking</em>
broadens the horizons of this genre, delivering a dramedy that blends
humor with raw, emotional truths.

“If everything’s being played on the surface, it’s very hard to make
that character come to life.<br>You want hinterland, you want subtext.
You want the things that are buried, the things that we don’t know about
them, the things that maybe they don’t know about themselves. And
always, the story is about this excavation of what’s underneath the
surface. One way or the other, that’s kind of what story <em>is.</em>
It’s about bringing things to the surface,” says <em>Conclave</em>
screenwriter Peter Straughan, about the importance of giving your
characters secrets. <br><br>In this episode, we speak to Peter Straughan
about his powerful film <em>Conclave</em>, starring Ralph Fiennes,
Stanley Tucci and John Lithgow. Based on the book by Robert Harris, the
movie follows five very different modern Catholic Cardinals as they go
through the process of electing a new Pope. Straughan talks about why he
loves a flawed hero, getting to tour the Vatican, what surprised him the
most, and whether or not he thinks the real Pope will watch this
movie. <br><br>Having also written the TV show <em>Wolf Hall</em> about
Tudor England, Straughan also talks about the surprising connection
between King Henry VIII and the modern Catholic Church. <br><br>“Both
the world of the Tudors and the world of <em>Conclave</em> give us a way
of looking at human behavior and the pursuit of power from a sort of
angle that makes it particularly clear and fresh, without the clutter of
the normal secular world of elections, that really anchors it in the
human individual. So, Tudor England was maybe the last time where the
sexual desires of one man was going to dominate the political landscape
of an entire country. Maybe not the last time. Maybe this still happens
in the world. But it becomes really pared down to basics, so you see
very clearly what’s going on. And I think it feels the same with
<em>Conclave</em>, it’s about the personalities and the morals of these
few individuals,” says Straughan. <br><br>Just a warning, there are
spoilers about the ending of <em>Conclave</em> in this episode, but we
give you plenty of warning before they are discussed. <br><br>To hear
more about Straughan’s writing process, listen to the podcast.

There’s <strong>Rakesfall </strong>by Vajra Chandrasekera, which I
called “a full-frontal deconstruction of narrative and genre”; there’s
Rita Bullwinkel’s magnificent <strong>Headshot</strong>, a story
structured around the intense, chaotic and bal­letic bouts of a junior
girl’s boxing tournament; and there are the 1,281 F-bombs that punctuate
