<p>When you go to <a href="https://ifdb.org/personal">My Activity</a>
you can find <a href="https://ifdb.org/playlist">a list of all of your
played games</a> (games where you’ve checked the “I’ve played it”
checkbox). If you submitted a vote for how long it takes to finish the
game, we’ll now include your play time there, as well.</p>

<p>You can now sort game results by their estimated play time–from
shortest to longest, or longest to shortest. When you sort this way,
each game’s estimated play time will display as part of the results.
(IFDB’s <a href="https://ifdb.org/api/search">search API</a> and
<a href="https://ifdb.org/api/viewgame">viewgame API</a> will also
include estimated play times, where available.)</p>

<p>date: 2025-01-06, from: IF Database News</p>
<p>Now, games can have multiple “Play Online” links, if we have multiple
external links that can be played online. (The big blue “Play Online”
button will link to the first “Play Online” link on the list.) We’ve
also updated IFDB’s <a href="https://ifdb.org/api/viewgame">viewgame
API</a> to match. The API now includes a
<code>primaryPlayOnlineUrl</code> as well as separate
<code>playOnlineUrl</code> links on each external link.</p>

It has been another excellent year for uncon­ventional narratives.
There’s <strong>Rakesfall </strong>by Vajra Chandrasekera, which I
called “a full-frontal deconstruction of narrative and genre”; there’s
Rita Bullwinkel’s magnificent <strong>Headshot</strong>, a story
structured around the intense, chaotic and bal­letic bouts of a junior
girl’s boxing tournament; and there are the 1,281 F-bombs that punctuate

<p>
Wizard’s Tower Press has an­nounced the new Wiz Duo novella series,
edited by Roz Clarke and Joanne Hall, to launch in early 2025. Each
volume “will contain two novella-length stories from different writers.”
The first two books include stories by David Gullen and Ben Wright, and
Juliet Kemp and E.M. Faulds. Their novellas were first acquired by the
now-defunct Grimbold Books. Publisher Cheryl Morgan said:

The graphic novel <strong>Dream Machine </strong>is the brainchild of
versatile Indian artist Appu­pen (known for <strong>Legends of
Halahala</strong>, <strong>The Snake and the Lotus</strong>, and other
inventive myth-building comics) and Laurent Daudet, a French physicist
and AI researcher. Educational and engaging, the book delves into the
wide-reaching ramifications
