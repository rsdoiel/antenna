<p>date: 2025-03-26, updated: 2025-03-25, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Cloudflare has a
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/cloudflare-turns-ai-against-itself-with-endless-maze-of-irrelevant-facts/">new
feature</a>—available to free users as well—that uses AI to generate
random pages to feed to AI web crawlers:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Instead of simply blocking bots, Cloudflare’s new system lures them into
a “maze” of realistic-looking but irrelevant pages, wasting the
crawler’s computing resources. The approach is a notable shift from the
standard block-and-defend strategy used by most website protection
services. Cloudflare says blocking bots sometimes backfires because it
alerts the crawler’s operators that they’ve been detected.
</p>
<p>
“When we detect unauthorized crawling, rather than blocking the request,
we will link to a series of AI-generated pages that are convincing
enough to entice a crawler to traverse them,” writes Cloudflare. “But
while real looking, this content is not actually the content of the site
we are protecting, so the crawler wastes time and resources.”…

2025-03-20 Something about the bot defence is working
</h1>
<p>
At midnight, there was a surge in activity. CPU usage went up.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-03-20-bot-defence-1.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Load went up, too. But it stayed within reasonable bounds – less than 4
instead of the more than 80 I have seen in the past.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-03-20-bot-defence-2.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
And the number of IP addresses blocked by <code>fail2ban</code> went
from 40 to 50.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-03-20-bot-defence-3.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
I’m usually sceptical of this because the big attacks are from a far
wider variety of IP numbers. In this case, however, maybe there was some
probing that resulted in blocks? I don’t know. Lucky, I guess?
</p>
<p>
In any case, the site is still up. Yay for small wins.
</p>
<p>
Also, I cannot overstate how good it feel to have some
<a href="https://munin-monitoring.org/">Munin</a> graphs available.
</p>
<p>
<code>alex-bots</code> is a setup I desribed in
<a href="2025-02-19-bots-again">2025-02-19 Bots again, cursed</a>.
Basically a request to one of my Oddmuse wikis containing the parameter
<code>rcidonly</code> is an expensive endpoint: “all changes for this
single page” or “a feed for this single page”. This is something a human
would rarely access and yet it somehow the URLs landed in some dataset
for AI training, I suspect. So what I do is I’m redirecting any request
containing “rcidonly” in the query string to <code>/nobots</code>,
warning humans not to click on these links.
</p>
<p>
In addition to that, the filter
<code>/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/alex-bots.conf</code> contains this:
</p>
<pre><code>[Definition]
failregex = ^(www\.emacswiki\.org|communitywiki\.org|campaignwiki\.org):[0-9]+ &lt;HOST&gt; .*rcidonly=
</code></pre>
<p>
And I added a section using this filter to my jail
<code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/alex.conf</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>[alex-bots]
enabled = true
port    = http,https
logpath = %(apache_access_log)s
findtime = 3600
maxretry = 2
</code></pre>
<p>
So if an IP number visits three URLs containing “rcidonly” in an hour,
they get banned for ten minutes.
</p>
<p>
The <code>recidive</code> filter (a standard filter you just need to
activate) then makes sure that any IP number that got blocked three
times gets blocked for a week.

<strong>2025-03-20</strong>. Ever since Drew DeVault published his blog
post, more people seem to notice what’s going on: AI ingestion is
killing web sites and web services.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
If you think these crawlers respect <code>robots.txt</code> then you are
several assumptions of good faith removed from reality. These bots crawl
everything they can find, <code>robots.txt</code> be damned, including
expensive endpoints like git blame, every page of every git log, and
every commit in every repo, and they do so using random User-Agents that
overlap with end-users and come from tens of thousands of IP addresses –
mostly residential, in unrelated subnets, each one making no more than
one HTTP request over any time period we tried to measure – actively and
maliciously adapting and blending in with end-user traffic and avoiding
attempts to characterize their behavior or block their traffic. –

Then, yesterday morning, KDE GitLab infrastructure was overwhelmed by
another AI crawler, with IPs from an Alibaba range; this caused GitLab
to be temporarily inaccessible by KDE developers. I then discovered
that, one week ago, an Anime girl started appearing on the GNOME GitLab
instance, as the page was loaded. It turns out that it’s the default
loading page for Anubis, a proof-of-work challenger that blocks AI
scrapers that are causing outages. –

</p>
<p>
What do SourceHut, GNOME’s GitLab, and KDE’s GitLab have in common,
other than all three of them being forges? Well, it turns out all three
of them have been dealing with immense amounts of traffic from “AI”
scrapers, who are effectively performing DDoS attacks with such ferocity
it’s bringing down the infrastructures of these major open source
projects. Being open source, and thus publicly accessible, means these
scrapers have unlimited access, unlike with proprietary projects. …
Everything about this “AI” bubble is gross, and I can’t wait for this
bubble to pop so a semblance of sanity can return to the technology
world. Until the next hype train rolls into the station, of course. –

<strong>2025-03-22</strong>. Ordinary sysadmins get hit as well. Here’s
Sean Conner of the The Boston Diaries: He reports on
<a href="https://boston.conman.org/2025/03/21">Friday, March 21,
2025</a> that his logs show a total of 468439 requests for February
2025. The top hitter was 4.231.104.62 with 43242 requests (9%). This was
from MICROSOFT-CORP-MSN-AS-BLOCK, US. But the ASN has more networks, of
course. Adding them all up give 78889 (17%).
</p>
<p>
He links to the <a href="https://www.team-cymru.com/ip-asn-mapping">IP
to ASN Mapping Service</a> by Team Cymru. I started switching my
<a href="/admin/network-lookup">network-lookup</a> script to using it
because it also supports IPv6. Something that I haven’t done is find the
ASN and then block all the blocks belonging to the ASN. That’s where I
want to be, actually.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2025-03-26</strong>. More media are picking it up, but with a
strange focus on “open source”.

may seem controversial, but the Repubs do have a point re
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity,_equity,_and_inclusion">DEI</a>.
We really do have a problem honoring the achievements of white men. I
know because I get the bullshit when people have tried to honor me for
my achievements. When I was offered a keynote spot a the
<a href="https://isoj.org/symposia/2019/">ISOJ conference in 2019</a>,
to honor my (then) 25 years of blogging, I told the show runner,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosental_Alves">Rosental
Alves</a>, that his audience wouldn’t like me. He is gentle generous
person, so I believe he was genuinely puzzled. I decided to go, because
a future of journalism conference that thinks the advent of blogs was
something for journalists and journalism students to acknowledge was
something I wanted to see. But in the Q&amp;A period, it all came out.
Bluntly and rudely. My contributions mean nothing because I am a white
man and in their minds I couldn’t have failed. Do they really believe
that? Swimming upstream isn’t easy for anyone. The experience at that
conference was pretty good proof of that. Behind my back in Silicon
Valley, while I was writing about the failures along with the victories,
when professional journalists and magazine publishers almost
unconditionally worshipped the tech gods, I assume because they respect
money more than anything, I wrote about the great victories of tech, but
a lot of them didn’t come from billionaires and VCs. I don’t study the
creativity of bankers, I care about tools for creative <i>people.</i> I
tried to write the truth, didn’t always succeed and sometimes I had to
retract. But I did pretty much what journalism preaches. Stayed true to
what I believe. The “white men bad” thing was an excuse for people to
say I was weak or stupid, or whatever they think. So we get the backlash
now. Some of the energy that MAGA gets is honest frustration of people
who are victims of DEI, despite the hype from “the woke” which is a term
I despise, what’s wrong with being awake, what’s the alternative, being
asleep? dead? – these righteous assholes, on both sides of this thing,
really do treat people as objects, and that hurts, and that kind of pain
is hard to forget.</p>

<strong>Key Findings:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Introducing Paragon Solutions.</strong> Paragon Solutions was
founded in Israel in 2019 and sells spyware called Graphite. The company
differentiates itself by claiming it has safeguards to prevent the kinds
of spyware abuses that NSO Group and other vendors are notorious for.
<li>
<strong>Infrastructure Analysis of Paragon Spyware.</strong> Based on a
tip from a collaborator, we mapped out server infrastructure that we
attribute to Paragon’s Graphite spyware tool. We identified a subset of
suspected Paragon deployments, including in Australia, Canada, Cyprus,
Denmark, Israel, and Singapore. …

know how they have
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/smartgrowth/national-walkability-index-user-guide-and-methodology">walkability</a>
scores for different places? I live in a place now with a score of zero,
you can’t do anything without a car. I moved from a place with a
<a href="https://www.walkscore.com/score/301-w-57th-st-new-york-ny-10019">score</a>
of 99. I’d like to have social networks get a score like that, for how
much they feed energy into the open web, vs how much they take out.
Something that attracts you from the open web, uses it to build its
network, but doesn’t reciprocate, gets a low score. Like Twitter or
Facebook, they’d have a lot of nerve saying they were of the web, and
thankfully they don’t. But Bluesky? They would like you to believe they
are of the web, that they are feeding the web, when they are not. They
would get Twitter’s score, divided by two for the dishonesty. Substack?
They don’t make the claim so they’re bad for the web but not the worst.
Mastodon? They’re trying. But they could make a concerted effort to
check the boxes on <a href="https://textcasting.org/">textcasting</a>,
and implement support across their entire network. Give writers a chance
to really work on the platform. Give Bluesky some competition which they
desperately need (by my estimation, probably not theirs).</p>

<p>A thought for everyone struggling to see a good future in all the
michegas. My advice – please – do your protesting, resisting, DEIing,
organizing, learning, and look for silver linings (they are there) and
most important keep doing things that feed your soul. Treat yourself
with love even if the world isn’t. So in that spirit for those of us who
love cats – a

<p>I want natural language text macros in ChatGPT. I would devise a
macro that turned random text I wrote online into a properly formatted
blog post. for example when i write fast i almost never stop to
capitalize things that should be capitalized. or i might abbreviate the
name of a product so i expect it to fill it in, as a professional copy
editor would. I hope we’re heading there. And if they have this, put it
behind a simple api so i can wire it into my favorite writing tool. We
could even work on a set of standards, a higher level Markdown if you
will, that goes deeper than formatting. That would be something for an
experienced copy editor to do imho.</p>

Countries are Demanding Backdoors to Encrypted Apps</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-24, updated: 2025-03-24, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Last month, I
<a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/02/uk-is-ordering-apple-to-break-its-own-encryption.html">wrote
about</a> the UK forcing Apple to break its Advanced Data Protection
encryption in iCloud. More recently, both
<a href="https://therecord.media/sweden-seeks-backdoor-access-to-messaging-apps">Sweden</a>
and <a href="https://www.laquadrature.net/en/warondrugslaw/">France</a>
are contemplating mandating backdoors. Both initiatives are attempting
to
<a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2019/12/scaring_people_.html">scare
people</a> into supporting backdoors, which are—of course—are
<a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2015/07/back_doors_wont.html">terrible
idea</a>.
