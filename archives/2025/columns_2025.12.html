may seem controversial, but the Repubs do have a point re
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity,_equity,_and_inclusion">DEI</a>.
We really do have a problem honoring the achievements of white men. I
know because I get the bullshit when people have tried to honor me for
my achievements. When I was offered a keynote spot a the
<a href="https://isoj.org/symposia/2019/">ISOJ conference in 2019</a>,
to honor my (then) 25 years of blogging, I told the show runner,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosental_Alves">Rosental
Alves</a>, that his audience wouldn‚Äôt like me. He is gentle generous
person, so I believe he was genuinely puzzled. I decided to go, because
a future of journalism conference that thinks the advent of blogs was
something for journalists and journalism students to acknowledge was
something I wanted to see. But in the Q&amp;A period, it all came out.
Bluntly and rudely. My contributions mean nothing because I am a white
man and in their minds I couldn‚Äôt have failed. Do they really believe
that? Swimming upstream isn‚Äôt easy for anyone. The experience at that
conference was pretty good proof of that. Behind my back in Silicon
Valley, while I was writing about the failures along with the victories,
when professional journalists and magazine publishers almost
unconditionally worshipped the tech gods, I assume because they respect
money more than anything, I wrote about the great victories of tech, but
a lot of them didn‚Äôt come from billionaires and VCs. I don‚Äôt study the
creativity of bankers, I care about tools for creative <i>people.</i> I
tried to write the truth, didn‚Äôt always succeed and sometimes I had to
retract. But I did pretty much what journalism preaches. Stayed true to
what I believe. The ‚Äúwhite men bad‚Äù thing was an excuse for people to
say I was weak or stupid, or whatever they think. So we get the backlash
now. Some of the energy that MAGA gets is honest frustration of people
who are victims of DEI, despite the hype from ‚Äúthe woke‚Äù which is a term
I despise, what‚Äôs wrong with being awake, what‚Äôs the alternative, being
asleep? dead? ‚Äì these righteous assholes, on both sides of this thing,
really do treat people as objects, and that hurts, and that kind of pain
is hard to forget.</p>

<p>
<strong>Key Findings:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Introducing Paragon Solutions.</strong> Paragon Solutions was
founded in Israel in 2019 and sells spyware called Graphite. The company
differentiates itself by claiming it has safeguards to prevent the kinds
of spyware abuses that NSO Group and other vendors are notorious for.
<li>
<strong>Infrastructure Analysis of Paragon Spyware.</strong> Based on a
tip from a collaborator, we mapped out server infrastructure that we
attribute to Paragon‚Äôs Graphite spyware tool. We identified a subset of
suspected Paragon deployments, including in Australia, Canada, Cyprus,
Denmark, Israel, and Singapore. ‚Ä¶

<a href="https://www.epa.gov/smartgrowth/national-walkability-index-user-guide-and-methodology">walkability</a>
scores for different places? I live in a place now with a score of zero,
you can‚Äôt do anything without a car. I moved from a place with a
<a href="https://www.walkscore.com/score/301-w-57th-st-new-york-ny-10019">score</a>
of 99. I‚Äôd like to have social networks get a score like that, for how
much they feed energy into the open web, vs how much they take out.
Something that attracts you from the open web, uses it to build its
network, but doesn‚Äôt reciprocate, gets a low score. Like Twitter or
Facebook, they‚Äôd have a lot of nerve saying they were of the web, and
thankfully they don‚Äôt. But Bluesky? They would like you to believe they
are of the web, that they are feeding the web, when they are not. They
would get Twitter‚Äôs score, divided by two for the dishonesty. Substack?
They don‚Äôt make the claim so they‚Äôre bad for the web but not the worst.
Mastodon? They‚Äôre trying. But they could make a concerted effort to
check the boxes on <a href="https://textcasting.org/">textcasting</a>,
and implement support across their entire network. Give writers a chance
to really work on the platform. Give Bluesky some competition which they
desperately need (by my estimation, probably not theirs).</p>

<p>I want natural language text macros in ChatGPT. I would devise a
macro that turned random text I wrote online into a properly formatted
blog post. for example when i write fast i almost never stop to
capitalize things that should be capitalized. or i might abbreviate the
name of a product so i expect it to fill it in, as a professional copy
editor would. I hope we‚Äôre heading there. And if they have this, put it
behind a simple api so i can wire it into my favorite writing tool. We
could even work on a set of standards, a higher level Markdown if you
will, that goes deeper than formatting. That would be something for an
experienced copy editor to do imho.</p>

their assistants, that [‚Ä¶]</p>

<p>Perhaps in response to the growing outcry over last weekend‚Äôs
rendition of Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador under a legal
justification a federal judge has found questionable, President Donald
Trump last night told reporters that he didn‚Äôt sign the proclamation
that set that legal process in motion.</p>

<p>Enshittification as a matter of taste by Dave Rupert To me,
enshittification means that a person who lacks taste was put in a
position of power. Scale above all else is the philosophy that both
buries us in endless genAI slop and locks customers in to enshittified
platforms‚Ä¶ and taste is in tension with scale. [‚Ä¶]</p>
