## Death of a Unicorn’s director went all-in on unicorn lore: ‘They’re symbolic of our own corruption’

Death of a Unicorn, a monster flick in which two enraged, predatory unicorns chomp and stomp through a mansion’s worth of exploitative, rich assholes, seems as far as possible from the classic vibe of unicorns as fragile, rare, gently magical creatures. It’s equally as far from the more contemporary My Little Pony-clutching Horse Girl vibe [&#8230;]
