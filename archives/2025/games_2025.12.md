## The 5 best cleaning games

date: 2025-03-27, updated: 2025-03-26, from: Polygon Website

Spring is here, and that means it’s time for spring cleaning! No, I’m not referring to my actual home, which I guess I’m also going to clean at some point, but we aren’t going to discuss that today.

date: 2025-03-26, updated: 2025-03-26, from: Polygon Website

Superhero universes are famed for their revolving-door approach to character death: You can hardly name a major comics character who’s never had some sort of death-and-resurrection arc. But even compared to the genre-standard number rate of deaths and returns, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki — who’s apparently set to appear in 2026’s Avengers: Doomsday, according to Marvel’s [&#8230;]

The most powerful graphics card you can buy right now is actually pretty worthless if you don’t have the right PC gaming setup.

## A24’s Death of a Unicorn finally gets the ‘Jurassic Park horror’ riff right

date: 2025-03-26, updated: 2025-03-25, from: Polygon Website

Jurassic Park is a horror franchise. Though it’s best remembered for its sense of awe and groundbreaking visual effects, Steven Spielberg’s Oscar-winning 1993 movie is also a scary gorefest, with brutal kills and plenty of dino jump scares. This is an element of that original winning formula that the reboot trilogy lacked: the horror influences [&#8230;]
