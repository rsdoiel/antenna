<h2 id="macssl-a-port-of-mbed-tls-for-the-classic-mac-os-789">MacSSL: a
port of Mbed-TLS for the classic Mac OS 7/8/9</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-11, from: OS News</p>
<p>Yesterday we had SDL2 for the classic Mac OS, today we have modern
SSL/TLS for the classic Mac OS. This is a C89/C90 port of MbedTLS for
Mac System 7/8/9. It works, and compiles under Metrowerks Codewarrior
Pro 4. This is a basic app that performs a GET request on whatever is in
api.h, and prints the result out to the text box (with a lot of debug
information, of course). The idea of this project was to build an ‘app’
of sorts for 640by480, my ‘instagram clone for vintage digital cameras’.
The idea would be to login, post images, view images, and read comments.
I would need HTTPS for that, so here we are: a port of MbedTLS for the
classic mac. ↫ MacSSL GitHub page It’s remarkable what tenacity can
achieve.</p>

released</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>I’ve long lost the ability to keep track of whatever’s happening in
the Amiga community, and personally I tend to just focus on tracking
MorphOS and AROS as best I can. The remnants of the real AmigaOS, and
especially who owns, maintains, and develops which version, are mired in
legal battles and ownership limbo, and since I can think of about a
trillion things I’d rather do than keep track of the interpersonal drama
by reading various Amiga forums, I honestly didn’t even realise there’s
been a development in the Hyperion Entertainment situation. Hyperion
Entertainment is the Belgian company who has been developing both
AmigaOS 4 and 3.1/3.2 for a while now, but the company’s largest
shareholder, Ben Hermans BV, went bankrupt, causing its shares to be
annulled as prescribed under Belgian law. This happened well over a
decade ago, but only earlier this year, in January, was the situation
resolved for Hyperion: a new director, Timothy De Groote, was appointed
by the remaining shareholders, who also instructed Hyperion to continue
development of Amiga OS. In addition, a few days ago, Hyperion released
Update 3 for AmigaOS 3.2, adding a bunch of fixes and improvements to
AmigaOS 3.2.2. It brings various updates to ReAction classes, a new
custom menu for TextEditor users can customise with macros, a new
KickStart 3.2.3 ROM, and many more smaller updates and fixes. The update
is free for existing users. AmigaOS 3.2 is available for classic
Amigas.</p>

<p>Well, this you certainly don’t see every day. This is a “rough draft”
of SDL2 for MacOS 9, using CodeWarrior Pro 6 and 7. Enough was done to
get it building in CW, and the start of a “macosclassic” video driver
was created. It DOES seem to basically work, but much still needs to be
done. Event handling is just enough to handling Command-Q, there is no
audio, etc etc etc. ↫ A cast of thousands The hardest part was a video
driver for the classic Mac OS, which had to be created mostly from
scratch using the QNX driver as a “skeleton” because it happened to be
the smallest one. It works on both m68k and PowerPC as well as on
SheepShaver and Basilisk II, and there’s already a few screenshots of it
up and running at the link, too. Amazing work, and it opens the door for
a whole bunch of especially games to be made available on classic Mac
OS.</p>

updated in 7 years, IIS is still a default part of Windows,
apparently</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>This month’s security updates for Windows 11 create a new empty
folder on drive C. It is called “inetpub,” and it does not contain any
extra folders or files. Its properties window shows 0 bytes in size and
that it was created by the system itself. Neowin checked a bunch of
Windows 11 PCs with the April 2025 security updates installed, and all
of them had inetpub on drive C. ↫ Taras Buria at Neowin So this folder,
inetpub, is most likely coming from Microsoft’s Internet Information
Services, the company’s web server. IIS is part of Windows, but inactive
by default, and it seems some buggy update script somewhere forgot to
remove the folder or created it by accident. Regardless, it seems you
can remove it without any issue, so if you see it on your Windows’ root
drive, just delete it any be on your merry way. Still though, something
about this seems odd, right? Internet Information Services as a core
product hasn’t been updated since 2018 when version 10 came out, which
doesn’t necessarily mean specific Windows updates might not have changed
it since then, but it doesn’t exactly inspire confidence. The Internet
Information Services’ website also hasn’t been updated in ages, and is
broken in places, further adding to the feeling IIS seems to be mostly
abandoned, only kept going as part of Windows updates because it’s,
well, part of Windows. I’m not trying to insinuate there’s anything
nefarious or dangerous going on with this silly folder glitch or
anything; I was just surprised to see such an outdated, seemingly
abandoned web server suite still being a default part of Windows
today.</p>

right. However, being a DOS clone doesn’t mean there isn’t room for

up DOS, and that’s exactly where FreeDOS focuses its attention. FreeDOS
1.4 comes about three years after 1.3. This version includes an updated
FreeCOM, Install program, and HTML Help system. This also includes
improvements to many of the utilities including FDISK, JEMM, 7Zip,
FORMAT, FASM, MORE, RUNTIME, and more! ↫ FreeDOS website If you’re using

<h2 id="whats-up-with-linux-support-for-qualcomm-x-elite-chips">What’s
up with Linux support for Qualcomm X Elite chips?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>Remember when Qualcomm promised Linux would be a first-tier platform
alongside Windows for its Snapdragon X Elite, almost a year ago now?
Well, the Snapdragon X laptop have been out in the market for a while
running Windows, but Linux support is still a complete crapshoot,
despite the lofty promises by Qualcomm. Tuxedo, a European Linux OEM who
promised to ship a Snapdragon X laptop running Linux, has posted an
update on its progress, and it’s not looking good. While Tuxedo did
reach a major milestone last week by sending the laptop’s device tree to
the LKML, that’s where the good news ends. The next step is to support
additional components of the ARM notebook within the device tree. This
includes all USB functionalities, including USB4, external monitor
connectivity via HDMI, and audio features, such as the headset jack.
Additionally, driver testing is on the agenda. Unfortunately, a planned
collaboration with Qualcomm, the manufacturer of the Snapdragon X Elite,
did not materialize. However, we are in contact with the ARM specialists
at Linaro and have sent test devices to them. We hope to receive
valuable feedback from their developers and the community in the near
future. ↫ Tuxedo’s website This seems to indicate that Qualcomm isn’t as
interested in Linux support after all, which may be because the
Snapdragon X machines haven’t exactly taken over the laptop market as
Microsoft and Qualcomm had hoped. The market for these things is
probably not large enough for Qualcomm to justify investing in Linux
support, especially when Windows on ARM is apparently not up to snuff
yet either. In case you are unaware of why device trees are such a big
thing in ARM land, it’s because ARM devices do not have a nice ACPI
table for operating systems to read system information from. Whereas x86
devices have their hardware components laid out in a nice ACPI table in
UEFI, ARM devices do not, meaning that the Linux kernel needs to know
specifically which device you’re using so it can load the correct device
tree. On x86, this isn’t necessary, as the Linux kernel can just read
the ACPI table, which works 99% of the time to get it to boot, even if
specific components might not be supported (yet). On ARM, without a
device tree, the Linux kernel doesn’t know what to do. That’s one of the
major reasons why it’s so hard for ARM to take off in the same way x86
once did. It’s just not designed to be infinitely intercompatible and
interoperable as we’ve come to expect from the x86 world, and I don’t
think anybody has any vested interest in changing that. I had hoped
Microsoft might throw its weight around here, but it seems that’s not
happening either. The ARM desktop/laptop revolution seems mostly
confined to Apple for now.</p>

<h2 id="the-insanity-of-being-a-software-engineer">The insanity of being
a software engineer</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>Software gets more complicated. All of this complexity is there for a
reason. But what happened to specializing? When a house is being built,
tons of people are involved: architects, civil engineers, plumbers,
electricians, bricklayers, interior designers, roofers, surveyors,
pavers, you name it. You don’t expect a single person, or even a whole
single company, to be able to do all of those. ↫ Vitor M. de Sousa
Pereira I’ve always found that software development gets a ton of
special treatment and leeway in quality expectations, and this has
allowed the kind of stuff the linked article is writing about to become
the norm. Corporations can demand so much from developers and
programmers to the point where expecting quality is wholly unreasonable,
because there’s basically no consequences for delivering a shit product.
Bugs, crashes, security issues, lack of documentation, horrid
localisation – it’s all par for the course in software, yet we would not
tolerate any of that in almost any other type of product. While I’m sure
some of this can be attributed to developers themselves, most of it
seems to stem from incompetent managers imposing impossible deadlines
downwards and setting unrealistic expectations upwards – you know, kick
down, lick up – creating a perfect storm of incompetence. We all know
it, we all experience it every day, and we all hate it – but we’ve just
accepted it. As consumers, as developers, as regulatory bodies. It’s too
late to fix this now. Software development will forever exist as a sort
of no man’s land of quality expectations, free from regulations,
warranties, and consumer protections, and imposing them now after the
fact is never going to be accepted by the industry and won’t ever make
it through any lawmaking process of any country, and we all suffer from
it, both as users of software and as makers of it.</p>

<h2 id="apples-darwin-os-and-xnu-kernel-deep-dive">Apple’s Darwin OS and
XNU kernel deep dive</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>Apple’s Darwin operating system is the Unix-like core underpinning
macOS, iOS, and all of Apple’s modern OS platforms. At its heart lies
the XNU kernel – an acronym humorously standing for “X is Not Unix.” XNU
is a unique hybrid kernel that combines a Mach microkernel core with
components of BSD Unix. This design inherits the rich legacy of Mach
(originating from 1980s microkernel research) and the robust stability
and POSIX compliance of BSD. The result is a kernel architecture that
balances modularity and performance by blending microkernel
message-passing techniques with a monolithic Unix kernel structure.
We’ll go through a chronological exploration of Darwin and XNU’s
evolution – from Mach and BSD origins to the modern kernel features in
macOS on Apple Silicon and iOS on iPhones. We’ll follow this with a deep
dive into the architectural milestones, analyze XNU’s internal design
(Mach-BSD interaction, IPC, scheduling, memory management,
virtualization), and examine how the kernel and key user-space
components have adapted to new devices and requirements over time. ↫
Tanuj Ravi Rao Despite its popularity and open source kernel, it’s quite
rare to see detailed deep-dives into the underpinnings of macOS. It
always surprised me that nobody took whatever Apple threw across the
fence every macOS release and ran with it – much further than “run
existing open source desktops but worse” we never got when it comes to
Darwin distributions (although this might change) – so perhaps having
more approachable articles like these out and about get people
interested.</p>

<p>date: 2025-04-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>This is a very small blog post about my first reverse engineering
project, in which I don’t really reverse engineer anything yet, but I am
just getting started! A family member asked me to add additional book
data to the LeapStart he bought for his son, this is the starting point
here. ↫ leloubil’s blog We’ve all seen toy, child-focused computers like
these, and I always find them deeply fascinating. I’m not buying them
for my own kids – they’ll get their start on a “real” computer I’ll set
up for them to explore and break – but I see their value, and they’re
probably a better choice than giving a kid a tablet or whatever (which
my wife and I are opposed to for our kids). What fascinates me about
them is, of course, what software, and more specifically, what operating
system they run. It turns out this one most likely runs on something
called µC/OS-II, one of the many relatively obscure embedded operating
systems you never hear about. µC/OS is a full-featured embedded
operating system originally developed by Micriµm. In addition to the two
highly popular kernels, µC/OS features support for TCP/IP, USB-Device,
USB-Host, and Modbus, as well as a robust File System. ↫ µC/OS GitHub
page The documentation provides a lot more detail about its
capabilities, so if you’re interested in learning more, that’s your
starting point.</p>
