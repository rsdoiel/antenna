## 'FreePascal from Square One' free book

date: 2025-05-16, from: FreeDOS News

<div class="markdown_content"><p>Tech author Jeff Duntemann has released his book about FreePascal programming, for free, for anyone to use. Jeff writes on his blog: "<em>FreePascal from Square One</em> really is a free ebook. It’s a distillation of the four editions of my Pascal tutorial, <em>Complete Turbo Pascal</em>, which first appeared in 1985 and culminated in <em>Borland Pascal 7 From Square One</em> in 1993. I sold a lot of those books and made plenty of money, so I’m now giving it away, in hopes of drawing more people into the Pascal universe. ... If you want the book, it’s right here. You’re welcome to share it around, post it on your site, or give it to anyone who might be find it useful." We include FreePascal in the FreeDOS distribution, so this book is a great way to get started with Pascal programming on DOS. There's a link to download the book in PDF format <a class="" href="https://www.contrapositivediary.com/?p=5399" rel="nofollow">in Jeff's announcement</a>.</p></div>
