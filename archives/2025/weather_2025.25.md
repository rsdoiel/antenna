Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0721 AM CDT Mon Jun 23 2025

Valid 231300Z - 241200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE CENTRAL
PLAINS INTO THE UPPER MS VALLEY AND UPPER GREAT LAKES...

...SUMMARY...
Storms with isolated severe wind gusts and hail will be possible
today from the southern and central Plains northeastward into the
Great Lakes.

...Central Plains into the Upper MS Valley and Upper Great Lakes...
Early-morning satellite imagery shows a shortwave trough progressing
through ND and southern SK/MB. Surface analysis places the low
associated with this shortwave over far northwestern ON, with an
attendant cold front arcing from this low through the MN arrowhead
and back through south-central MN, northwest IA,
eastern/south-central NE to another low in northwest KS. Showers and
thunderstorms are ongoing along this frontal zone from northeast NE
into southern MN. 

Expectation is for the shortwave trough to continue northeastward
through far northwest ON throughout the day, with the primary
surface low also tracking northeastward just ahead of its parent
shortwave. Gradual eastward/southeastward progress of the cold front
is anticipated, although its forward progression will slow with
time, particularly from the Mid MO Valley southwestward into the
southern High Plains. A warm and moist airmass exists ahead of this
front, with temperatures expected to reach the mid 80s to low 90s
amid dewpoints in the upper 60s to low 70s. These conditions will
result in strong buoyancy and little to no convective inhibition
along much of the front by 21Z. 

Large-scale forcing for ascent will be negligible, but persist
low-level convergence should be enough to initiate deep convection,
with numerous to widespread thunderstorms anticipated. The stronger
deep-layer vertical shear will lag behind the front across much of
the region, but steep low-level lapse rates and ample moisture
should still result in sporadic damaging gusts. There will be better
overlap between the shear and buoyancy from WI into MI, and there is
some chance for one or more forward-propagating line segments in
this area. Some isolated hail is possible within the more robust
early-stage storms. Storm mergers could also result in updrafts
briefly becoming strong enough to produce hail.

...Southern and Central High Plains...
Numerous thunderstorms are expected to develop during the afternoon
amid persistent low-level convergence within the warm, moist, and
weakly sheared airmass over the region. The lack of stronger shear
will result in largely outflow-dominant storm structures. Given the
high cloud bases and steep low-level lapse rates, damaging gusts are
possible with the stronger storms.  

...Northern ME...  
A convectively augmented vorticity maximum currently over
northeastern ON is forecast progress eastward through southern QC
and into the Canadian Maritimes during the period. Showers and
thunderstorms will accompany this vorticity max, with a few stronger
storms potentially glancing northern ME this evening. Moderately low
to mid-level westerly flow will support the threat for some damaging
gusts as these storms move through the region.

...Southeast...
Scattered to numerous diurnally driven thunderstorm are expected
across the region today. Shear will be weak, with a multicellular
pulse mode anticipated. Given the ample moisture and likelihood of
storm interactions, a few strong, water-loaded downbursts are
possible. Limited coverage precludes the need for any severe
probabilities.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0359 AM CDT Mon Jun 23 2025

Valid 261200Z - 011200Z

...DISCUSSION...
...D4/Thursday: Parts of the Midwest/Great Lakes...
An area of interest for severe-storm potential on Thursday resides
from eastern IA/southeast MN into northern IL/southern WI. A
mid/upper-level shortwave trough is generally forecast to move
across parts of the Midwest into the Great Lakes during the
afternoon, potentially accompanied by a frontal wave. While
deep-layer flow will generally remain rather modest, rich low-level
moisture and strong heating will support moderate to strong buoyancy
along/south of the front. Strong to potentially severe storms may
develop as the approaching shortwave trough impinges upon the
favorable buoyancy.  Uncertainty regarding frontal position and the
sufficiency of deep-layer shear precludes higher confidence at this
time. 

...D5/Friday: Northern Plains...
An area of interest for Friday resides across parts of the northern
Great Plains. A mid/upper-level shortwave trough is forecast to move
across the northern Rockies toward the northern High Plains, though
considerable spread remains regarding the timing of this relatively
low-amplitude shortwave and attendant cold front. The front may
impinge upon strong instability across parts of the Dakotas, with
scattered storm and eventual MCS development possible. Deep-layer
shear may remain relatively modest, but the magnitude of instability
will likely support some organized severe threat. 

...D6/Saturday: Northern Plains/Upper Midwest...
Some continuation of severe-storm potential is possible into
Saturday, potentially shifting eastward into the Upper Midwest.
Spread in guidance becomes quite large at this range regarding
placement of the warm sector Saturday afternoon, but strong
instability and at least modest deep-layer shear could support
severe storms along/east of the cold front.

## SPC Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0111 AM CDT Mon Jun 23 2025

Valid 241200Z - 251200Z

...Synopsis...
Another day of elevated fire weather conditions is expected for
parts of the intermountain West on Tuesday. An upper trough
currently settling into the southern Great Basin/lower CO River
Valley is expected to stall and slowly de-amplify over the next 48
hours. This will maintain a belt of modest mid-level flow over parts
of the eastern Great Basin/western Four Corners region. Although
pressure gradient winds will generally be in the mid/upper teens,
diurnal heating and deep mixing of a dry air mass will promote
frequent gusts between 20-35 mph across the region - especially from
northern AZ into eastern UT and southern WY under a belt of somewhat
stronger 700-500 mb flow. Afternoon RH minimums in the low to mid
teens are expected, and coupled with dry fuels, will help support
another day of elevated fire weather conditions (though transient
periods of critical conditions are anticipated where stronger gusts
can occur).

...Dry Thunderstorms...
Isolated thunderstorms appear possible Tuesday afternoon across
portions of northeastern Nevada under the upper-level low. Cold
temperatures aloft combined with modest mid-level moisture and
strong low-level heating will support thermodynamic profiles
adequate for weak convection, but perhaps limited precipitation.
Given dry fuels across the region, some dry-thunderstorm risk is
expected. The primary limiting factor to a more substantial
dry-thunderstorm concern is slow storm motions (less than 10 knots),
which should increase the probability of wetting rainfall under the
convective cores.

Mesoscale Discussion 1406
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0259 PM CDT Sun Jun 22 2025

Areas affected...southwest to northeast NE and southeast SD

Concerning...Severe potential...Severe Thunderstorm Watch likely 

Valid 221959Z - 222200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Severe wind/hail threats will increase as a corridor of
scattered thunderstorms form ahead of a dryline, along a slow-moving
to quasi-stationary front. A Severe Thunderstorm Watch issuance is
expected.

DISCUSSION...Cumulus development is underway along the slow-moving
to quasi-stationary front that arcs across southeast SD into
southwest NE, ahead of a dryline that has mixed across northwest KS
and far southwest NE. Initial storm development should occur ahead
of the dryline/front intersection into central NE where MLCIN is
minimized, with additional storms rippling north-northeast along the
front by early evening. Nearly unidirectional south-southwesterlies
and uniform speeds with height will curtail overall effective bulk
shear. But this should help enhance growth into multicell clusters
favorable for producing sporadic severe gusts. Severe hail potential
may largely be confined to initial storm formation.

Mesoscale Discussion 1405
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0250 PM CDT Sun Jun 22 2025

Areas affected...portions of eastern New Mexico into western Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 221950Z - 222115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...The risk for a few instances of severe wind/hail will
increase through the afternoon. The severe threat should be isolated
enough to preclude a WW issuance.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms have recently shown an uptick in
intensity across portions of central NM into the TX Trans Pecos,
with a cell in Lincoln County, NM showing 40 dBZ echoes at 50 kft.
MLCINH is eroding due to strong diurnal heating, which is promoting
robust boundary-layer mixing, with 0-3 km lapse rates already
approaching the 9-10 C/km range in spots (per 19Z mesoanalysis).
Additional storms should continue to develop and intensify this
afternoon given persistent diurnal heating, with MLCAPE likely
exceeding 1000 J/kg. Vertical shear will be weak, and given marginal
MLCAPE, most storms should be pulse cellular or weakly
multicellular. Given steep low-level lapse rates, rapid evaporative
cooling with stronger storm cores may result in severe gusts and
perhaps a brief instance of hail. Since the severe threat should be
isolated, a WW issuance is not expected.

0234 PM CDT Sun Jun 22 2025

Areas affected...northwest MN and eastern ND

Concerning...Severe potential...Tornado Watch likely 

Valid 221934Z - 222130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...The tornado threat with a few supercells will increase
during the late afternoon to early evening as surface-based storms
develop across the Red River Valley through northwest Minnesota. A
tornado watch issuance is expected.

DISCUSSION...Airmass recovery is occurring across the Red River
Valley and northwest Minnesota in the wake of earlier elevated
thunderstorms. While another round of elevated thunderstorms has
formed well west into the post-frontal airmass across central ND,
this lobe of large-scale ascent will overspread the downstream
surface front and trough in the next couple hours. 19Z mesoanalysis
suggests that MLCIN has weakened. Surface-based thunderstorm
development by 21-22Z is likely. 

Weak easterly components to the low-level flow between the surface
front and trough will support favorable hodograph curvature as flow
veers to the south and south-southwest aloft. In conjunction with
optimal temperature-dew point spreads, a corridor of supercell
tornado potential is anticipated. Otherwise, large hail and isolated
severe gusts will be possible as storms likely become confined
closer to the international border this evening.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 453
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
400 PM CDT Sun Jun 22 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Central Nebraska
  Southeast South Dakota

* Effective this Sunday afternoon and evening from 400 PM until
  1100 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
    inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Severe thunderstorms are expected to develop rapidly and
move northeast across the watch area through this evening with a
risk for damaging wind gusts and large hail.  The potential for
corridors of more concentrated wind damage may increase towards this
evening.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 60
statute miles east and west of a line from 45 miles northeast of
Mitchell SD to 60 miles south southeast of North Platte NE. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU3).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 451...WW 452...

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 550. Mean storm motion vector

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0300 PM CDT Sun Jun 22 2025

Valid 222000Z - 231200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE MIDWEST
TO PORTIONS OF THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN PLAINS....

...SUMMARY...
Isolated to scattered thunderstorms are expected today across the
northern Plains and Upper Mississippi Valley, some of which could
produce large hail, damaging wind gusts and tornadoes. Storms
associated with severe gusts and hail may also develop across parts
of the southern and central Plains, and Northeast.

...20z Update Central/Northern Plains...
Current surface and satellite observations show strong heating
occurring from far eastern WY, into the NE panhandle within a
post-frontal upslope flow regime. As ascent from the primary trough
across the northern Rockies moves overhead, storm initiation appears
likely this afternoon. Weak destabilization, with moderate
deep-layer shear suggests a few supercells are likely with hail and
damaging winds the primary risk. A brief tornado is also possible
with the stronger surface-based supercells given strong low-level
veering. The MRGL and SLGT boundaries have been adjusted westward to
better align with expected storm initiation along the terrain and
stalled front. See MCD#1403 for additional short-term info.

To the north across eastern SD/ND and MN, the severe risk continues
largely as expected. Strong heating ahead of a surface low and warm
front will support scattered storm development this afternoon and
evening. Deep-layer shear will support supercells and clusters
capable of all severe hazards. Storms will continue eastward this
evening and overnight across northern MN with damaging gusts and
hail likely.

...Northeast...
In the wake of an earlier MCS, strong heating remains evident along
a remnant outflow boundary from eastern PA into southwestern NY
state. However, mid-level height rises and subsidence are evident in
visible/WV imagery and will continue to suppress convective
development over much of the region. An isolated storm or two
remains possible along the boundary through late this afternoon, but
more widespread convective coverage is unlikely. Should storms form,
a strong/severe wind gusts will be possible, in addition to sporadic
hail, given seasonably large buoyancy and steep mid-level lapse
rates. With decreased confidence in storm development/coverage, have
opted to remove the SLGT risk and continue with 5% wind/hail
probabilities.

..Lyons.. 06/22/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1136 AM CDT Sun Jun 22 2025/

...Northern/Central Plains into the Upper Midwest...
A warm front extends northeast from a surface low over northern SD
across northern MN and east across the northern Great Lakes.  This
warm front should lift north through the day, while a cold front
extends southwest of the surface low into northeast CO.
Thunderstorms over eastern ND/northwest MN have produced near severe
gusts as they continue to move northeast towards the international
border.

Redevelopment of thunderstorms is anticipated towards late afternoon
or early evening across eastern ND/western MN southward into eastern
SD as a weak mid-level perturbation lifts northeast across the area,
contributing large-scale ascent and weakening the capping inversion.
These storms will move east/northeast within a strongly unstable air
mass and include a mix of supercell and cluster modes with a risk
for large to very large hail initially, and transition into an
increasing wind threat with time. Tornado potential appears to be
greatest over northern MN, where low-level SRH will be maximized.

The potential for elevated, post-frontal thunderstorm development
across the NE Panhandle will exist later this afternoon/evening,
with storms moving east and posing a risk initially for severe hail.
The severe wind potential will increase with eastward extent as
storms congeal and tap greater surface instability farther east.  

...Central/Southern High Plains...
Low-level moisture advection and related airmass destabilization
coupled with low-level convergence along the lee trough is expected
to result in thunderstorm development from eastern CO/western KS
through eastern NM and into far west TX. Vertical shear will be
modest, likely resulting in predominantly outflow-dominant storm
structures and the potential for damaging wind gusts. Some isolated
hail is also possible with the strongest/more persistent updrafts.

...Northeast...
Overall storm intensity along the western flank of outflow from the
long-lived MCS remains sub severe, and have narrowed the Marginal
and Slight Risk areas to along and immediately southwest of the
convective line. Substantial diurnal heating of a very moist air
mass, and 30-40 kts of effective shear, may support some severe
potential as storms move generally southward along the eastern
periphery of the mid-level ridge. Isolated to widely scattered
strong/severe wind gusts will be possible, in addition to isolated
hail reports given seasonably steep mid-level lapse rates.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0221 PM CDT Sun Jun 22 2025

Valid 241200Z - 251200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER EASTERN
WYOMING AND VICINITY...

...SUMMARY...
Severe storms are possible Tuesday from eastern Wyoming into
southwest South Dakota, the Nebraska Panhandle, and northeast
Colorado. Isolated strong to severe storms will also be possible
from parts of the central Plains and Midwest into the Northeast.

...Synopsis...
The upper ridge over the East will flatten on Tuesday as a strong
upper trough moves across Ontario and Quebec, with the strongest
height falls occurring overnight. To the west, shortwave ridging
will occur over the northern Plains during the day, as a weakening
and low-amplitude wave moves from UT into WY through 00Z. This
system will continue into the northern Plains overnight, providing
cooling aloft.

At the surface, high pressure will extend from the upper Great Lakes
into the Southeast, with southerly winds persisting over the Plains.
A boundary from Lower MI into NE will surge north as a warm front
late in the day and overnight, with backed/easterly winds along this
front allowing for near 60 F dewpoints as far west as eastern WY.

Late in the day, a cold front associated with the Quebec upper
trough will push south across NY, PA, and New England, providing a
focus for storms as the antecedent air mass will be unstable.

...Northern to central High Plains...
Morning thunderstorms may be ongoing from parts of NE and KS
northeastward into Lower MI, but probably not severe at that time.
As heating occurs, re-development is possible, both along the
developing warm front or with any MCVs or residual outflow
boundaries. The weak shear environment coupled with moderate
instability will primarily yield sporadic clusters of strong to
locally damaging wind gusts.

Farther west into eastern WY and northeast CO, supercell potential
will exist late in the day and during the evening, as moist easterly
flow eventually becomes uncapped generally east of a Casper to
Cheyenne to Denver line. Aided by steep lapse rates/heating over the
higher terrain, and the approaching upper trough, widely scattered
cells are anticipated, with large hail the most likely threat. A
brief tornado cannot be ruled out. While capping will be an issue
after dark, the lifting warm front may support additional storms
into western SD/NE.

...Northeast Late Afternoon/Evening...
Forecast soundings across the area depict relatively warm profiles
aloft, though still unstable with 1500-2000 J/kg MUCAPE. Given this,
widely scattered thunderstorms are expected from Lake Huron eastward
into parts of New England late in the day. As these storms should be
timed near peak heating, localized strong downbursts will be
possible.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1215 PM CDT Sun Jun 22 2025

Valid 231200Z - 241200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE CENTRAL
PLAINS NORTHEASTWARD TOWARD THE UPPER GREAT LAKES...

...SUMMARY...
Strong to potentially severe storms are possible Monday from parts
of the Great Lakes into the central Plains.

...Synopsis...
A prominent upper high will be centered over the Appalachians,
providing hot conditions over much of the eastern CONUS. Early in
the day, a shortwave trough will exit the far northern Plains,
ejecting across Ontario. Meanwhile, a shortwave trough will move
from parts of CA into the Great Basin, within a broader upper
trough.

At the surface, High pressure will exist over much of the East
beneath the upper ridge, though weak troughing will occur during the
day over the Mid Atlantic. Another area of high pressure behind the
northern Plains wave will push east into the upper MS Valley, with a
cold front roughly from central WI into western KS by 00Z. A very
moist air mass will exist east of this cold front, and, over much of
the East. Strong to severe storms are most likely along the Plains
front, although scattered storms will also be likely over the TN
Valley and Mid South, though with less severe potential. Finally,
isolated storms may occur over parts of the Appalachians beneath the
upper High.

...Central Plains into the upper Great Lakes...
Strong heating will occur ahead of the cold front, where dewpoints
will range from the upper 60s F to lower 70s F. This region will
also be within a plume of midlevel moisture spreading northward west
of the upper ridge. As such, the high PW air mass along with surface
convergence near the front should easily support afternoon storms,
most likely from WI southwestward to perhaps the OK/TX Panhandles by
00Z.

Deep-layer shear and mean winds in general will not be very strong
along the frontal zone, but perhaps a bit stronger over northern
areas as the upper wave glances the area. The end result should be
an elongated area of afternoon storms. Some of these storms may
briefly contain marginal hail due to moderate instability and modest
midlevel lapse rates, but storms will likely merge quickly over most
of the area with strong to locally damaging gusts.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1149 AM CDT Sun Jun 22 2025

Valid 221700Z - 231200Z

Minor adjustments were made to expand the Elevated in southern New
Mexico in alignment with latest trends. Otherwise, the forecast
remains on track. See previous discussion below for more
information.

..Thornton.. 06/22/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0125 AM CDT Sun Jun 22 2025/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns are expected to persist across portions of the
Intermountain West where very dry/windy conditions have been
prevalent over the past several days. 

...Four Corners/Central Rockies...
Early-morning surface observations reveal a cold front draped from
southern WY southwestward to the CA coast. This front is forecast to
stall as the attendant upper low over the western CONUS begins to
de-amplify and multiple embedded perturbations lift into the
northern Plains. This pattern will maintain moderate southwesterly
flow across the Four Corners and central Rockies where another
afternoon of RH minimums in the single digits to low teens is
expected ahead of the front. Although sustained winds will be
somewhat weaker compared to previous days, 15-20 mph winds are
expected and will support widespread elevated to locally critical
fire weather conditions. Gusts upwards of 25-35 mph are expected,
especially across eastern UT into northwest CO and southern WY under
a belt of stronger mid-level flow. 

...Central High Plains...
Dry and windy conditions are expected across eastern CO into
adjacent portions of NE and KS behind a sharpening dryline this
afternoon. Sustained winds between 20-25 mph are expected by late
afternoon as RH values fall into the teens. Despite reasonably high
confidence in the emergence of critical fire weather conditions,
green grasses should modulate a more substantial fire weather
threat.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE UPPER
MIDWEST TO THE CENTRAL/SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS AND OVER PORTIONS OF THE
NORTHEAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated to scattered thunderstorms are expected to develop today
across the northern Plains and Upper Mississippi Valley, some of
which could produce large hail, damaging wind gusts and tornadoes.
Storms associated with severe gusts and hail may also develop across
parts of the Northeast, and in the southern and central Plains.

...Northern/Central Plains into the Upper Midwest...
A warm front extends northeast from a surface low over northern SD
across northern MN and east across the northern Great Lakes.  This
warm front should lift north through the day, while a cold front
extends southwest of the surface low into northeast CO.
Thunderstorms over eastern ND/northwest MN have produced near severe
gusts as they continue to move northeast towards the international
border.

Areas affected...Parts of eastern ND...northeast SD...western MN

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 221224Z - 221400Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Strong to locally severe storms are possible this morning.

DISCUSSION...Elevated convection is ongoing this morning from
east-central ND into northeast SD. This convection is being aided by
a low-amplitude midlevel shortwave trough moving quickly
northeastward toward northern MN. Midlevel lapse rates are quite
steep (as observed on the 12Z MPX sounding), and recent objective
mesoanalyses depict a corridor of very strong MUCAPE (3000-4000
J/kg) from eastern ND into northwest MN, near and north of a surface
boundary that will move north as a warm front with time today.
Ongoing convection could intensify as it moves into this corridor.
Deep-layer shear is also stronger with northern extent, and could
help to increase storm organization with time this morning.

Large hail and localized severe gusts may accompany these storms as
they move northeastward. The large buoyancy and steep lapse rates
will support a conditional threat of very large hail if any elevated
supercells can become established. Coverage of the severe threat
this morning is uncertain, making the need for short-term watch
issuance unclear. A more extensive severe threat is still expected
across parts of this region later today.
