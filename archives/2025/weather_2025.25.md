Mesoscale Discussion 1476
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0350 PM CDT Fri Jun 27 2025

Areas affected...Far eastern KY into WV...western/southern VA...NC

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 272050Z - 272245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated damaging winds are possible into early evening.

DISCUSSION...Storms have increased in coverage and intensity over
the last hour across parts of NC, and also from eastern KY into WV.
Deep-layer shear is weak across the region, but buoyancy is strong,
with MLCAPE of 2000-3000 J/kg along the western/southern periphery
of an extensive cloud shield over the Mid Atlantic. 

Relatively large PW and steep low-level lapse rates will support a
risk of localized downbursts with the strongest storms. Some outflow
consolidation is possible with time, if a sufficient concentration
of storms can develop. This could lead to a somewhat greater chance
for damaging wind, though this scenario remains uncertain.

Mesoscale Discussion 1475
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0336 PM CDT Fri Jun 27 2025

Areas affected...western/central ND

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 272036Z - 272230Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Initial thunderstorms may develop over the next couple
hours, with greater storm coverage by early evening. Very large to
giant hail will be possible with the most intense supercell or two,
along with tornado and severe wind threats. Watch issuance is
expected with moderate uncertainty on timing.

DISCUSSION...A focused corridor of supercell development is
anticipated this evening, perhaps as early as 22-23Z along a weak
surface trough/front in western ND. More probable storm development
is anticipated towards sunset, within the exit region of a
strengthening low-level jet over SD/NE. The initially subtle/weak
forcing for ascent lends some uncertainty to sustained storm
timing/location. But once storms are sustained, weak low-level winds
veering to moderate mid-level and stronger upper-level westerlies
will yield a favorable hodograph for splitting supercell structures.
In conjunction with very steep mid-level lapse rates with southern
extent (as sampled by the 18Z UNR sounding) and ample buoyancy, this
type of pattern should favor a risk for baseball to softball-size
hail in a supercell or two before storms congeal into an MCS
tonight. This seems most probable across central ND this evening.

Mesoscale Discussion 1474
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0303 PM CDT Fri Jun 27 2025

Areas affected...Southern/eastern Lower MI into northeast IN and
northwest OH

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 466...

Valid 272003Z - 272130Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 466
continues.

SUMMARY...Damaging winds remain possible through late afternoon.

DISCUSSION...A line of storms has developed this afternoon from
southern lower MI into northern IN. Weak midlevel lapse rates and
modest deep-layer shear have limited storm organization, with the
strongest measured gusts thus far in the 40-45 kt range. However,
moderate southwesterly flow above the surface (as noted in regional
VWPs) has resulted in relatively fast moving outflows and storm
motions, and may continue to support a threat for damaging strong to
locally severe gusts through the remainder of the afternoon. 

The ongoing small cluster east of Lansing may pose the greatest
short-term threat, given its favorable north-south orientation and
somewhat stronger deep-layer flow/shear with northern extent. Some
intensification and/or redevelopment remains possible farther south
within a moderately unstable environment into far southern Lower MI,
northeast IN, and northwest OH.

Mesoscale Discussion 1473
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0245 PM CDT Fri Jun 27 2025

Areas affected...western NE into southern SD

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 271945Z - 272145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Increasing, outflow-dominated convection should yield a
threat for severe gusts along with isolated severe hail. Severe
thunderstorm watch issuance is possible.

DISCUSSION...High-based convection is increasing along the dryline
across the NE Panhandle into far northeast CO. This activity is
likely to persist as storm-scale convective outflows are generated
within an initially weak deep-layer shear environment. As outflows
impinge on progressively greater buoyancy into central NE and
south-central SD, a threat for severe gusts may persist over the
next several hours. Development ahead of dryline-forced convection
is not anticipated in the near-term owing to persistent
warm/moist-sector MLCIN, and this may curtail a greater hail threat.

Mesoscale Discussion 1472

0225 PM CDT Fri Jun 27 2025

Areas affected...central to eastern MT

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 271925Z - 272130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Sporadic severe gusts and small hail will be possible with
high-based thunderstorms moving east from central to eastern Montana
into early evening. Lack of greater organization/intensity should
preclude severe-storm watch issuance.

DISCUSSION...A minor perturbation embedded within a moderate
westerly mid-level flow regime has aided in gradually increasing
convection across central MT. Much of central/eastern MT has only
scant to meager buoyancy per 18Z TFX sounding and 19Z mesoanalysis,
with mid 50s or greater surface dew points confined to the far
eastern portion of the state. Still, typical inverted-v
thermodynamic profiles in conjunction with moderate mid-level
westerlies should aid in easterly progressive storms with a threat
for isolated severe gusts.

Areas affected...Parts of central/eastern KY...middle and eastern
TN...northern AL...extreme northwest GA

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 271913Z - 272115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Localized damaging wind is possible this afternoon.

DISCUSSION...One cluster of storms is ongoing across parts of middle
TN into northern AL, with another across central KY. Deep-layer
shear is quite weak across the region, but some outflow
consolidation has been noted with both clusters. Additional storm
development will be possible along and to the immediate cool side of
these outflows with time. 

Seasonably cool temperatures aloft atop a very warm and moist
boundary layer are resulting in MLCAPE of 3000-4000 J/kg in areas
not already influenced by convective outflow. This very favorable
buoyancy could lead to additional vigorous updrafts, which in turn
could pose a threat of localized downbursts and small to near-severe
hail through the remainder of the afternoon.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0300 PM CDT Fri Jun 27 2025

Valid 272000Z - 281200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
CENTRAL NORTH DAKOTA...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM NORTHERN
INDIANA INTO SOUTHEAST LOWER MICHIGAN...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered thunderstorms are expected late this afternoon/evening
across the Dakotas and Nebraska, where very large hail, severe
outflow winds, and a few tornadoes will be possible.  Occasional
wind damage will be possible this afternoon from northern Indiana
into southeast Lower Michigan.

...20Z Update...
The primary change with this update was the addition of an Enhanced
risk over parts of central ND -- driven by 30-percent hail
probabilities. Based on the latest high-resolution guidance and
observations, confidence has increased that several semi-discrete
supercells capable of producing very large hail will evolve along
the northern periphery of strong to extreme surface-based buoyancy
and very favorable deep-layer shear into tonight. Elsewhere, only
minor changes were made to the outlook. For information on the
severe risk in Lower MI and northern IN, reference Severe
Thunderstorm Watch 466.

..Weinman.. 06/27/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1114 AM CDT Fri Jun 27 2025/

...Dakotas/NE/MN...
Water vapor imagery shows a fast-moving shortwave trough moving
across MT.  As this feature overspreads the northern Plains this
afternoon/evening, scattered thunderstorm development is expected
from western ND into central/western SD.  Storms will track
southeastward in a moist and very unstable air mass, where steep
mid-level lapse rates and sufficient vertical shear will support the
development of supercells.  Very large hail and a few tornadoes are
possible with this early activity.  Congealing outflows after dark
may result in one or more bowing segments capable of severe wind
gusts.  Have expanded the SLGT a little farther east into MN to
account for various morning CAM solutions.

...Lower MI...
Visible satellite imagery shows clear skies from northern IN into
southeast Lower MI, with dewpoints in the 70s and afternoon CAPE
values expected in the 2000-3000 J/kg range.  A weak shortwave
trough will pass to the north of this area, providing weak lift and
aiding in thunderstorm development by mid afternoon.  Steep
low-level lapse rates will promote a risk of damaging wind gusts in
the stronger cells.

...East TN/north GA...
Another active day of scattered thunderstorms is expected, with
hot/humid conditions aiding in the risk of locally damaging wind
gusts and some hail in the stronger cells.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0247 PM CDT Fri Jun 27 2025

Valid 281200Z - 291200Z

...Southwest Wyoming...
A surface low in South Dakota, elevated mid-level flow and a
well-mixed boundary layer will promote sustained west winds of
around 15 mph across southwest Wyoming Saturday. These winds
combined with relative humidity of 15-20 percent amid dry fuels will
bring an elevated fire weather threat to much of the Wyoming Basin.

...Snake River Plain...
A passing mid-level trough and attendant wind maxima atop a dry and
well-mixed boundary layer will support elevated surface winds across
the central/eastern portions of the Snake River Plain. Westerly
winds of 15-20 mph and relative humidity in the 15-20 percent range
will support elevated fire weather conditions Saturday afternoon
where dry fuels exist.

..Williams.. 06/27/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0136 AM CDT Fri Jun 27 2025/

...Synopsis...
Low-amplitude mid-level troughing over the Northern Rockies will
begin to shift eastward Saturday as high pressure over the southern
US continues to build. A belt of stronger mid-level flow will remain
in place over parts of the Intermountain West, supporting dry
downslope flow ahead of a weak cold front over the Northwest.

...ID into southwest WY...
Gusty surface winds through central ID and southwest WY could
support a few hours of elevated fire-weather potential Saturday. In
the wake of the departing upper trough, continued mid-level zonal
flow will linger over central ID. Confidence is highest that 15-20
mph surface winds will occur across portions of the central and
eastern Snake River Plain Saturday afternoon. Coincident with RH
below 20%, elevated fire-weather conditions are probable amid fuels
that continue to dry.

Farther east into WY, less confidence exists in sustained surface
winds greater than 15 mph occurring on a widespread basis through
the day. However, a very warm and dry air mass will remain in place.
This could support some localized fire-weather concerns, especially
where terrain-augmented winds may occasionally gust to 15-20 mph.

## SPC Jun 27, 2025 1930 UTC Day 3 Severe Thunderstorm Outlook

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0230 PM CDT Fri Jun 27 2025

Valid 291200Z - 301200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS SUNDAY ACROSS
PARTS OF THE UPPER MIDWEST...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong to severe storms appear possible Sunday from the
central Great Plains into the upper Great Lakes region, with at
least some potential for the evolution of a large, organized severe
storm cluster across parts of the mid into lower Missouri Valley and
central Great Plains late Sunday through Sunday night.

...Discussion...
Stronger westerlies will remain confined to the northern
mid-latitudes, but models indicate further amplification of flow
across the northeastern Pacific into interior North America through
this period.  This is forecast to include building mid/upper ridging
across British Columbia through the western Canadian Prairies and
northern U.S. Rockies, and digging downstream troughing across the
international border toward the Upper Midwest.  As mid-level flow
transitions from westerly to northwesterly across the northern
Rockies toward the middle/lower Missouri Valley, an initially
prominent plume of warm elevated mixed-layer air advecting to the
east of the Rockies is likely to become increasingly suppressed
southward/southwestward into and through the central Great Plains by
early Monday.  Although the main surface cold front may only reach
the Upper Midwest into high plains to the south of the Black Hills,
this may be preceded by a notable wind shift, reinforced by
considerable convective outflow through much of the central Great
Plains into middle Mississippi Valley.

...Central Great Plains into middle/lower Missouri Valley...
There is a notable signal within the model output that a large
reservoir of moderate to strong potential instability, beneath the
plume of warm elevated mixed-layer air, may provide support for one
or two significant upscale growing clusters of thunderstorms Sunday
through Sunday night.  There remains sizable spread among the
various output concerning where, ranging from near/east of the mid
into lower Missouri Valley to portions of western Nebraska into
Kansas.  Much may depend on the evolution of a possible evolving
cluster of storms, and its outflow, across southern South
Dakota/northern Nebraska Saturday night, and the extent of the
suppression of the elevated mixed-layer by early Sunday, which
remain unclear.

Stronger instability may tend to become displaced to the south of
the stronger westerlies, but modest shear due to veering winds with
height, coupled the thermodynamic profiles, characterized by
unsaturated lower/mid-levels, with steep lapse rates and large CAPE,
seem likely to become supportive of organized convection with strong
cold pools capable of producing swaths of strong to severe surface
gusts.

Severe probabilities will probably need to be upgraded once
lingering uncertainties become better resolved.

...Upper Midwest...
If early period convection does not impact subsequent
destabilization near/ahead of the southeastward advancing frontal
zone, it still appears possible that deep-layer shear and forcing
for ascent downstream of the digging short wave trough could support
scattered strong to severe storm development in a corridor across
southwestern through northeastern Wisconsin and portions of adjacent
states.

Day 2 Convective Outlook CORR 1
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1248 PM CDT Fri Jun 27 2025

Valid 281200Z - 291200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS SATURDAY INTO
SATURDAY NIGHT ACROSS CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN MINNESOTA...WEST CENTRAL
WISCONSIN...MUCH OF SOUTH DAKOTA AND ADJACENT PORTIONS OF NORTHERN
NEBRASKA...

CORRECTED FOR NDFD THUNDER GRID

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong to severe thunderstorms, perhaps including one or
two organizing clusters, will pose a risk for severe hail, wind and
perhaps a couple of tornadoes across parts of the middle Missouri
Valley into Upper Midwest Saturday afternoon into Saturday night.

...Discussion...
Models indicate that the stronger westerlies will remain confined to
the northern mid-latitudes.  There may be some amplification in the
flow across the northeastern Pacific into British Columbia and the
Pacific Northwest by the end of the period.  However, a zonal regime
is likely to generally persist near the Canadian/U.S. border, along
the northern periphery of modest mid-level ridging encompassing the
subtropics through much of the southern mid-latitudes of the U.S.  

One embedded short wave trough is still forecast to progress east of
the lower Great Lakes vicinity, through the St. Lawrence Valley and
northern New England, Saturday through Saturday night.  Models
indicate that this will be accompanied by an initially modest, but
weakening, surface cyclone, with a trailing intrusion of cooler,
drier boundary-layer air spreading southeast of the lower Great
Lakes region toward northern Mid Atlantic coastal areas, while
relatively cool/dry air associated with a prior intrusion is slow to
lose influence across northern New England.

Upstream, low-amplitude larger-scale mid-level troughing is forecast
to progress eastward along the central Canadian/U.S. border
vicinity, with at least a couple of embedded shorter-wavelength
perturbations.  One notable convectively generated or augmented
perturbation may be overspreading portions of north central
Minnesota into northern Wisconsin at the outset of the period, near
the southern leading edge of this regime.  The convectively
reinforced trailing flank of the Great Lakes cold front may be slow
to modify/retreat eastward across the Upper Midwest, as another
upstream cold front advances south of the international border.

...Upper Midwest into northern Great Plains...
There appears a better consensus within model output that a
low-level baroclinic zone, generated or reinforced by convective
outflow, may be initially stalled across the west central through
southeastern Minnesota vicinity, in the wake of a dissipating
cluster of storms.  Thereafter, it may slowly retreat
northeastward/eastward through the day, while also becoming a focus
for strengthening differential heating.  

There remains at least some spread among the latest model output
concerning the warmth of temperatures around 700 mb, near the
northern/northeastern periphery of a plume of elevated mixed-layer
air, which may continue to increase mid-level inhibition across
South Dakota through southern Minnesota, before gradually becoming
suppressed southward by late Saturday night.  However, a belt of
convectively augmented (30-50 Kt) southwesterly to westerly flow in
the 850-500 mb layer is forecast to slowly overspread the low-level
baroclinic zone through and beyond peak diurnal destabilization.

Supported by surface dew points around or above 70 F, moderate to
large mixed-layer CAPE appears likely to develop, coincident with a
corridor of strong shear, including sizable clockwise curved
low-level hodographs along the boundary.  If forcing for ascent and
heating, beneath broadly difluent mid/upper flow overspreading the
Upper Midwest, is able to overcome inhibition, supercells posing a
risk for severe hail and a couple of tornadoes appear possible
across parts of central Minnesota, before perhaps growing upscale
into an organizing cluster while propagating into west central
Wisconsin by late Saturday evening.

Upstream, potential convective developments remain more unclear. 
However, there appears a general signal within the model output that
convection, emerging from the more deeply mixed environment across
the high plains, could intensify while acquiring more moist and
potentially unstable updraft inflow, along/north of a remnant
outflow boundary or front across southern South Dakota or far
northern Nebraska Saturday evening.  Generally becoming focused
along the periphery of the increasingly suppressed, more strongly
capping elevated mixed-layer air, thermodynamic profiles
characterized by steep lapse rates and large CAPE may become
supportive of an organizing convective system, aided by forcing for
ascent associated with warm advection.

...Northern Mid Atlantic into Champlain Valley vicinity...
There remain mixed signals within the model output, including
convection allowing guidance, concerning the extent of the
convective potential within deepening pre-frontal surface troughing
across the region by Saturday afternoon.  The more substantive
destabilization may remain focused across the northern Mid Atlantic,
to the south of the better deep-layer shear.  However, it still
appears that the environment will probably become conducive to at
least widely scattered vigorous storms accompanied by a risk for
potentially damaging wind gusts.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1140 AM CDT Fri Jun 27 2025

Valid 271700Z - 281200Z

No marked changes for the Day 1 outlook update as previous forecast
(see below) remains on track. Current satellite and upper-air
observations indicate broad westerly flow across the Northwest and
north-central CONUS as a low-amplitude mid-level trough enters the
Pacific Northwest. A deepening lee trough around the Black
Hills/Badlands region along with increased westerly mid-level flow
will support breezy west winds across much of southwest WY this
afternoon amid dry fuels and low relative humidity. Similarly,
accelerating valley westerly winds in the Snake River Plain are
expected today as the mid-level trough and associated wind maxima
move through the Northern Rockies supporting elevated fire weather
conditions amid dry fuels and low relative humidity.

..Williams.. 06/27/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0134 AM CDT Fri Jun 27 2025/

...Synopsis...
Sub-tropical high pressure is forecast to intensify across much of
the southern US as flow aloft lifts to the north. Across the
northern edge of the building high, a low-amplitude midlevel trough
with embedded speed maxima will move eastward from the northern
Rockies to the northern High Plains through tonight.  At the
surface, lee cyclogenesis is expected this afternoon in the vicinity
of northeast WY, with a weak lee trough extending south across the
High Plains. Increasing westerly flow aloft and warm temperatures
suggest increased fire-weather concerns are likely.

...Southwest WY and central ID...
Moderate westerly flow at the base of the upper trough will begin to
overspread ID and southwest WY early today as lee troughing develops
to the east. Dry downslope winds are expected across southwest WY
with surface winds to near 20 mph. Deep mixing will also promote
frequent gusts to 25-30 mph, as RH values fall into the teens this
afternoon. Several hours of elevated conditions appear likely,
coincident with dry fuels and ongoing drought.

Farther west, slightly weaker surface flow should develop through
the eastern Snake River Plain and central ID. Deep mixing and the
approach of the upper trough will promote surface gusts of 15-20
mph, along with relative humidity below 20%. This could support a
few hours of elevated fire-weather conditions amid drying fuels.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON
FROM NORTHERN IN INTO SOUTHEAST LOWER MI...AND THIS
AFTERNOON/TONIGHT ACROSS THE NORTHERN PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered thunderstorms are expected late this afternoon/evening
across the Dakotas and Nebraska, where very large hail, severe
outflow winds, and a few tornadoes will be possible.  Occasional
wind damage will be possible this afternoon from northern Indiana
into southeast Lower Michigan.

...Dakotas/NE/MN...
Water vapor imagery shows a fast-moving shortwave trough moving
across MT.  As this feature overspreads the northern Plains this
afternoon/evening, scattered thunderstorm development is expected
from western ND into central/western SD.  Storms will track
southeastward in a moist and very unstable air mass, where steep
mid-level lapse rates and sufficient vertical shear will support the
development of supercells.  Very large hail and a few tornadoes are
possible with this early activity.  Congealing outflows after dark
may result in one or more bowing segments capable of severe wind
gusts.  Have expanded the SLGT a little farther east into MN to
account for various morning CAM solutions.

...Lower MI...
Visible satellite imagery shows clear skies from northern IN into
southeast Lower MI, with dewpoints in the 70s and afternoon CAPE
values expected in the 2000-3000 J/kg range.  A weak shortwave
trough will pass to the north of this area, providing weak lift and
aiding in thunderstorm development by mid afternoon.  Steep
low-level lapse rates will promote a risk of damaging wind gusts in
the stronger cells.

...East TN/north GA...
Another active day of scattered thunderstorms is expected, with
hot/humid conditions aiding in the risk of locally damaging wind
gusts and some hail in the stronger cells.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS LATE THIS
AFTERNOON INTO EARLY TONIGHT ACROSS THE NORTHERN PLAINS...AND THIS
AFTERNOON/EVENING ACROSS SOUTHEAST LOWER MICHIGAN...

...SUMMARY...
At least widely scattered thunderstorms are expected late this
afternoon/evening across the Dakotas and Nebraska, where very large
hail and severe outflow winds will be possible.  There will also be
a window of opportunity for tornadoes this evening across the
central Dakotas.  Occasional wind damage will be possible this
afternoon/evening across southeast Lower Michigan.

...Northern Plains late this afternoon into early tonight...
Water-vapor imagery this morning shows a mid-level disturbance
moving east across the northern Rockies.  This upper feature and an
associated belt of stronger flow will move eastward into the
northern Great Plains tonight.  In the low levels, southerly flow
will contribute to moisture return northward into the Dakotas as a
low develops near the SD/WY border.  Steep midlevel lapse rates of
8.5-9.5 C/km, and daytime heating will result in MLCAPE exceeding
4000 J/kg within the moisture plume where boundary-layer moisture is
highest.  

A cap will likely inhibit storm development through the mid
afternoon before heating and the resultant erosion of convective
inhibition favors initially isolated storm development.  Forecast
soundings show very steep low to mid-tropospheric lapse rates, large
to extreme buoyancy, and effective shear supporting organized
storms.  The initial activity will likely be supercellular with an
attendant risk for large to giant hail with the stronger supercells.
A period of opportunity for an isolated tornado risk may realize
during the early evening, coincident with a slight intensification
of low-level shear, while maintaining a favorable storm mode. A
couple of clusters are forecast to evolve during the evening with
significant gusts (75-90 mph) possible in the more intense clusters.
A lingering risk for mainly wind and perhaps hail will gradually
wane towards the late evening and early overnight as this activity
gradually shifts east.

...Southeast Lower MI this afternoon/evening...
Not much change to the previous forecast scenario.  A midlevel
shortwave trough and associated weak wave cyclone now over the Upper
MS Valley will continue eastward over the Upper Great Lakes through
this evening, while a trailing cold front crosses Lower MI.  Daytime
heating and lower 70s deg F dewpoints will yield moderate buoyancy
by the early afternoon.  Low-level ascent along the front will
support a broken band of storms by mid afternoon, and the storms
will spread eastward before weakening by late evening.  Though
midlevel lapse rates and deep-layer vertical shear will not be
strong, ~35 kt midlevel flow and steep low-level lapse rates suggest
the potential for scattered 55-70 mph gusts capable of wind damage
with the stronger storms and linear clusters. 

...Appalachians into the Southeast this afternoon/evening...
Another afternoon/evening of widely scattered thunderstorms and
isolated downburst potential is expected across a broad area from
the Appalachians into the Southeast/FL.  Local sea breeze
circulations, terrain circulations and residual outflow/differential
heating zones will help focus thunderstorm development. The more
intense storms and small-scale clusters will likely yield a risk for
45-65 mph gusts and pockets of wind damage.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0355 AM CDT Fri Jun 27 2025

Valid 301200Z - 051200Z

...DISCUSSION...
A mid-level trough will amplify across the Great Lakes at the
beginning of the period D4/Monday and shift into the Northeast by
Tuesday. A surface cold front will shift east across the Great Lakes
on Monday and to the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic on Tuesday. Moderate
instability may develop across a large area east of the Appalachians
on Day 5/Tuesday. The strongest shear is forecast from Pennsylvania
northward, beneath the strongest mid-level flow. However, the
greatest instability should remain mostly south of this better flow.
Therefore, a favorable corridor may develop for some strong to
severe storms near the Mid-Atlantic/Carolinas where instability and
modest shear overlap, but this remains too uncertain for severe
weather probabilities at this time. 

Beyond Day 5, mid-level ridging will shift east across the central
CONUS. At the surface, high pressure will build across much of the
eastern CONUS. The combination of weak mid-level flow beneath the
mid-level ridge and surface high pressure should limit severe
weather potential for Day 6 and beyond. Strong instability is
forecast to return to the northern Plains, but given the lack of
mid-level flow, any storms will likely only be marginally severe at
best. Some stronger mid-level flow may return to the northern Plains
by next weekend as the ridge starts to break down, which may be the
next chance for more organized severe storms in the latter portion
of the extended period.

Mesoscale Discussion 1459
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0331 PM CDT Thu Jun 26 2025

Areas affected...Parts of central/eastern IA

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 465...

Valid 262031Z - 262200Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 465
continues.

SUMMARY...The threat for damaging wind and possibly a tornado will
continue through late afternoon.

DISCUSSION...A convective line has evolved across central into
northern IA this afternoon, with other smaller clusters gradually
becoming better organized into southwest IA. Deep-layer shear is
rather weak, and weakens with southward extent, but unidirectional
25-35 kt southwest flow in the 1-3 km AGL layer (as noted in the
KDMX VWP) could support some organized damaging-wind potential. 

There has been some tendency for outflow to advance ahead of the
convective line, but any small bowing segments that become oriented
more orthogonal to the southwesterly low/midlevel flow (such as the
one across Butler/Grundy Counties, IA) could be more likely to
produce localized swaths of wind damage through late afternoon.
Modestly favorable effective SRH could also support a brief tornado
threat.

Mesoscale Discussion 1458
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0243 PM CDT Thu Jun 26 2025

Areas affected...Parts of extreme northeast IA...southeast
MN...southwest WI

Concerning...Tornado Watch 463...

Valid 261943Z - 262115Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 463 continues.

SUMMARY...Both an eastward-moving convective line and developing
cells ahead of the line could pose a tornado threat this afternoon.
Localized damaging wind is also possible.

DISCUSSION...A broken line of storms has developed from southeast MN
into north-central IA, with additional cells gradually developing
east of the line into parts of southwest WI. MLCAPE has increased
into the 1000-1500 J/kg along and immediately north of the warm
front, with a more stable environment farther north, where clouds
have persisted and temperatures are in the 60s F. 

The broken line moving across far southeast MN earlier produced a
reported tornado in Freeborn County, and this portion of the line
will continue to pose a tornado threat as it traverses the warm
frontal zone, where low-level shear/SRH is locally enhanced (as
noted in the KARX VWP). The developing cells east of the line could
also begin to pose a tornado threat, especially if one or more of
these cells can mature and take on more of a front-parallel motion,
leading to increased residence time in the frontal zone. Cell
mergers into the primary line could also result in locally increased
tornado potential. 

Aside from the tornado potential, locally damaging wind will
continue to be possible with the primary convective line as it moves
eastward this afternoon.

0211 PM CDT Thu Jun 26 2025

Areas affected...portions of far northern Texas...western
Oklahoma...into far southern Kansas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 261911Z - 262115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Storms with potential for strong to severe wind possible
this afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorm development is ongoing across far western
Oklahoma this afternoon where daytime heating has allowed MLCIN to
erode. Temperatures are now in the mid 80s to mid 90s with dew
points in the upper 60s to 70s. MLCAPE around 1000-2000 J/kg is
noted in surface objective analysis. Though the background flow is
generally weak, steep lapse rates around 8-8.5 C/km and moist
profiles will support a few strong storms capable of strong to
severe winds through the afternoon. Given the lack of shear for a
more widespread and organized threat, a watch is unlikely to be
needed.

Mesoscale Discussion 1439
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0340 PM CDT Wed Jun 25 2025

Areas affected...Parts of the Carolinas into northeast GA

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 459...

Valid 252040Z - 252215Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 459
continues.

SUMMARY...The damaging wind threat may gradually increase into the
early evening. Isolated hail also remains possible.

DISCUSSION...Extensive convection is ongoing late this afternoon
across parts of eastern NC, with additional storms in western NC,
and developing cumulus into parts of SC and east-central/northeast
GA. Additional storm development is possible into early evening,
within a very unstable (MLCAPE of 3000-4000 J/kg) environment.
Generally weak deep-layer shear continue to hamper storm
organization, but the strong instability and steep midlevel lapse
rates will continue to support vigorous updrafts. 

Outflow is gradually expanding across eastern NC, and there may be
some tendency for a loosely organized storm cluster to propagate
south/southwestward with time, as outflow impinges upon a hot and
very moist environment. A similar evolution could take place with
ongoing storms across western NC. This could lead to more
concentrated areas of damaging wind with time. The strongest
updrafts will also continue to be capable of producing isolated
hail.

Mesoscale Discussion 1438
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0258 PM CDT Wed Jun 25 2025

Areas affected...FL Panhandle into south GA and far southeast AL

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 251958Z - 252200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Additional storm development is possible through late
afternoon, with a continued threat of damaging wind and isolated
hail.

DISCUSSION...Widely scattered storms are ongoing this afternoon
across the FL Panhandle into southwest GA, with additional cumulus
development noted northeast of the ongoing convection. Relatively
steep lapse rates and cool temperatures aloft are supporting strong
to extreme buoyancy, with MLCAPE generally in the 3000-4000 J/kg
range. Deep-layer flow is rather weak, though modest midlevel
northeasterlies on the periphery of an upper ridge will support
20-25 kt of effective shear through the afternoon, which may support
modest storm organization given the very favorable instability. 

Potential will continue this afternoon for southwestward moving
clusters capable of damaging downburst/outflow winds and isolated
hail. There is some potential for loosely organized outflow-driven
clusters to develop, which could produce more concentrated areas of
wind damage, though this scenario remains somewhat uncertain. 

Uncertainty regarding severe coverage renders the need for
short-term watch issuance uncertain, but trends will be monitored
for an uptick in coverage through the remainder of the afternoon.

Mesoscale Discussion 1437
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0216 PM CDT Wed Jun 25 2025

Areas affected...central and northeastern Nebraska...parts of
southeastern South Dakota and northwestern Iowa

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 251916Z - 252115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...A corridor of increasing thunderstorm development,
including gradually organizing clusters with increasing potential
for strong to severe surface gusts, through 4-6 PM CDT.

DISCUSSION...In the wake of one low-amplitude short-wavelength
perturbation migrating through the Upper Midwest toward adjacent
Great Lakes vicinity, a similar strength perturbation is gradually
migrating north-northeastward through the central high plains,
around the northwestern periphery of the prominent mid-level ridge
centered over the Tennessee Valley.  Downstream of this feature,
forcing for ascent has maintained an arcing band of precipitation
across Nebraska, which is preceded by a seasonably high moisture
content boundary-layer that is destabilizing beneath relatively warm
and dry layers aloft associated with the ridging.

Within the strengthening zone of differential surface heating to the
east of the precipitation band, mixed-layer CAPE is beginning to
increase in excess of 2000 J/kg, beneath a modest belt of
southwesterly mid-level flow which includes speeds of 30-40 kt in
the 700-500 mb layer.  Although mid/upper-level lapse rates are
weak, as low-level lapse rates continue to steepen and inhibition
erodes further, a corridor of increasing thunderstorm development
appears probable across Nebraska, from the Lexington NE toward Sioux
City IA vicinity, through 21-23Z.  As this occurs, heavy
precipitation loading and evaporative cooling in downdrafts may
gradually contribute to downward momentum transfer accompanied by
increasing potential for a few strong to severe severe gusts, in
slowly organizing clusters.

Mesoscale Discussion 1429
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0349 PM CDT Tue Jun 24 2025

Areas affected...portions of extreme northwest Pennsylvania into
extreme western New York

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 242049Z - 242315Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...A couple of damaging gusts cannot be ruled out over the
next several hours. A Severe Thunderstorm Watch is not expected.

DISCUSSION...A few thunderstorms have initiated and intensified off
of surface boundaries and confluence zones over the past couple of
hours. Deep-layer flow and shear, as well as buoyancy, are modest at
best across the region (e.g. 1000 J/kg MLCAPE amid less than 20 kts
of effective bulk shear). As such, a couple of brief downbursts may
cause sparse tree damage in the near-term. Relatively more robust
storms are currently tracking across extreme southeast Ontario.
These storms may cross Lake Erie a few hours for now, perhaps with a
slightly greater damaging gust threat. Nonetheless, the severe
threat should remain localized, precluding the need for a Severe
Thunderstorm Watch.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0247 PM CDT Tue Jun 24 2025

Valid 261200Z - 021200Z

...Synopsis...
An weak upper-level trough will move across the Pacific Northwest 
Day 3/Thursday into the Great Lakes by Day 7/Monday. An amplifying
ridge across the Intermountain West early next week will promote
lighter surface winds but well above normal temperatures for much of
the Western U.S. Weak troughing will remain off the West Coast, with
potential for locally breezy conditions and mix of wet/dry
thunderstorms.

...Day 3-6/Thursday-Sunday...
Generally weak upper flow with the western trough will promote
lighter, mainly terrain driven winds across much of the
Intermountain West and Southwest late this week, into early next
week. A few hours of Elevated to locally Critical conditions will be
possible across portions of the Columbia Basin into the Snake River
Plain in Idaho on D3/Thursday and D4/Friday.

...Day 7/Monday - Day 8/Tuesday...
A weak trough will push the western ridge eastward across the Divide
and Rockies early next week. There is some potential for increasing 
winds but also moisture for thunderstorms across the Pacific
Northwest. For now, confidence in moisture and position of the
trough remains too low to include probabilities.

Mesoscale Discussion 1420
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0336 PM CDT Mon Jun 23 2025

Areas affected...parts of southern/eastern Wisconsin

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 455...

Valid 232036Z - 232230Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 455
continues.

SUMMARY...Another small, organized cluster of storms posing a risk
for damaging wind gusts may evolve east of La Crosse toward the
Oshkosh vicinity through 5-7 PM CDT, along outflow trailing the lead
cluster now spreading south through southeast of Green Bay.

DISCUSSION...One small, organized convective cluster, with an
embedded meso-beta scale cyclonic circulation, has already evolved
and produced a narrow corridor of severe and/or damaging gusts near
and east of the Wisconsin Rapids area.  This may continue near/south
and southeast of the Green Bay vicinity, before diminishing while
spreading into Lake Michigan within the next hour or so.

Meanwhile, thunderstorm activity now forming upstream may undergo a
similar evolution along the trailing outflow from the lead cluster, 
east of La Crosse toward the Oshkosh vicinity during the next couple
of hours. Inhibition has become increasingly negligible in the
presence of peak heating, with latest mesoanalysis indicating CAPE
on the order of 2000-3000 J/kg, in the presence of at least modest
shear beneath 40+ kt westerly 500 mb flow.

Mesoscale Discussion 1418
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0308 PM CDT Mon Jun 23 2025

Areas affected...parts of northwestern Maine

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 232008Z - 232245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Widely scattered strong to severe storms, including a
supercell or two, may cross the St. Lawrence Valley and at least
approach parts of northwestern Maine prior to 8 PM EDT, accompanied
by the risk for large hail and potential for a tornado.  Although it
still appears unlikely that a severe weather watch will be needed,
trends will continue to be monitored for this possibility.

DISCUSSION...Near/just ahead of a mid-level perturbation associated
with a now dissipated thunderstorm cluster, isolated supercell
development appears underway across parts of southeastern Quebec,
roughly 100 miles or so to the northwest of Quebec City.  Activity
appears to be forming just to the south of a warm frontal zone,
where surface dew points are near 70 F, and low-level hodographs
have become sizable beneath 30 kt west-southwesterly flow around 850
mb.

This is occurring beneath 40-50 kt west-northwesterly 500 mb flow,
around the northeastern periphery of the prominent mid-level high
centered near the southern Appalachians, contributing to a
southeastward propagation toward the St. Lawrence Valley, near
Quebec City.  Additional thunderstorm development appears possible
over the next few hours in closer proximity to the frontal zone to
the north.  

East of the St. Lawrence Valley, into northern New England, warming
and moistening of the boundary layer is ongoing along and south of
the northward developing warm frontal zone.  Forecast soundings from
the Rapid Refresh suggest that this may include surface dew points
increasing to near or above 70 F, in the presence of enlarging,
clockwise-curved low-level hodographs, across parts of northwestern
Maine prior to 00Z.  Although the onset of nightfall contributes to
some uncertainty concerning the extent of boundary-layer
destabilization, there appears at least some potential for the
maintenance of supercells posing a risk for severe hail, and
potential for a tornado or two.

Mesoscale Discussion 1417
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0234 PM CDT Mon Jun 23 2025

Areas affected...portions of central Kansas into far southeast
Nebraska and southwestern Iowa

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 231934Z - 232200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Some increase in severe potential may occur if more robust
thunderstorm development can take place along the cold front. Strong
to potentially severe wind gusts would be the main hazard.
Convective trends are being monitored for the need of a Severe
Thunderstorm Watch issuance.

DISCUSSION...A line of thunderstorms has developed across eastern NE
in a post-cold-frontal regime. Within the last hour, convection has
tried to deepen along the KS/NE border, closer to the cold front,
and where greater buoyancy resides. Deep-layer shear is modest at
best (e.g. 30 kts), and is lagging the cold front. While vertical
wind shear is limited, 7-8 C/km boundary-layer lapse rates atop 70+
F surface dewpoints is contributing to 3000 J/kg MLCAPE in a weakly
capped environment. While storms should be mainly pulse-cellular or
multicellular, any cold-pool mergers that occur with the more
intense storms may support strong to severe gusts. Convective trends
are being monitored for further increases in coverage or intensity
that would warrant a Severe Thunderstorm Watch issuance.

Mesoscale Discussion 1406
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0259 PM CDT Sun Jun 22 2025

Areas affected...southwest to northeast NE and southeast SD

Concerning...Severe potential...Severe Thunderstorm Watch likely 

Valid 221959Z - 222200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Severe wind/hail threats will increase as a corridor of
scattered thunderstorms form ahead of a dryline, along a slow-moving
to quasi-stationary front. A Severe Thunderstorm Watch issuance is
expected.

DISCUSSION...Cumulus development is underway along the slow-moving
to quasi-stationary front that arcs across southeast SD into
southwest NE, ahead of a dryline that has mixed across northwest KS
and far southwest NE. Initial storm development should occur ahead
of the dryline/front intersection into central NE where MLCIN is
minimized, with additional storms rippling north-northeast along the
front by early evening. Nearly unidirectional south-southwesterlies
and uniform speeds with height will curtail overall effective bulk
shear. But this should help enhance growth into multicell clusters
favorable for producing sporadic severe gusts. Severe hail potential
may largely be confined to initial storm formation.

Mesoscale Discussion 1405
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0250 PM CDT Sun Jun 22 2025

Areas affected...portions of eastern New Mexico into western Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 221950Z - 222115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...The risk for a few instances of severe wind/hail will
increase through the afternoon. The severe threat should be isolated
enough to preclude a WW issuance.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms have recently shown an uptick in
intensity across portions of central NM into the TX Trans Pecos,
with a cell in Lincoln County, NM showing 40 dBZ echoes at 50 kft.
MLCINH is eroding due to strong diurnal heating, which is promoting
robust boundary-layer mixing, with 0-3 km lapse rates already
approaching the 9-10 C/km range in spots (per 19Z mesoanalysis).
Additional storms should continue to develop and intensify this
afternoon given persistent diurnal heating, with MLCAPE likely
exceeding 1000 J/kg. Vertical shear will be weak, and given marginal
MLCAPE, most storms should be pulse cellular or weakly
multicellular. Given steep low-level lapse rates, rapid evaporative
cooling with stronger storm cores may result in severe gusts and
perhaps a brief instance of hail. Since the severe threat should be
isolated, a WW issuance is not expected.

0234 PM CDT Sun Jun 22 2025

Areas affected...northwest MN and eastern ND

Concerning...Severe potential...Tornado Watch likely 

Valid 221934Z - 222130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...The tornado threat with a few supercells will increase
during the late afternoon to early evening as surface-based storms
develop across the Red River Valley through northwest Minnesota. A
tornado watch issuance is expected.

DISCUSSION...Airmass recovery is occurring across the Red River
Valley and northwest Minnesota in the wake of earlier elevated
thunderstorms. While another round of elevated thunderstorms has
formed well west into the post-frontal airmass across central ND,
this lobe of large-scale ascent will overspread the downstream
surface front and trough in the next couple hours. 19Z mesoanalysis
suggests that MLCIN has weakened. Surface-based thunderstorm
development by 21-22Z is likely. 

Weak easterly components to the low-level flow between the surface
front and trough will support favorable hodograph curvature as flow
veers to the south and south-southwest aloft. In conjunction with
optimal temperature-dew point spreads, a corridor of supercell
tornado potential is anticipated. Otherwise, large hail and isolated
severe gusts will be possible as storms likely become confined
closer to the international border this evening.

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  West-central and Northern Minnesota
  Eastern North Dakota

* Effective this Sunday afternoon and evening from 255 PM until
  1000 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A few tornadoes and a couple intense tornadoes possible
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2.5
    inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Severe thunderstorms are expected to develop and move
northeast across the watch area this afternoon and evening.  A few
tornadoes will be possible, including the potential for a couple
strong tornadoes.  Large hail and damaging thunderstorm wind gusts
will also accompany the most intense storms.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 70 statute miles
east and west of a line from 35 miles west northwest of
International Falls MN to 55 miles south southwest of Fargo ND. For
a complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU1).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 2.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind

Mesoscale Discussion 1400
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0724 AM CDT Sun Jun 22 2025

Areas affected...Parts of eastern ND...northeast SD...western MN

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 221224Z - 221400Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Strong to locally severe storms are possible this morning.

DISCUSSION...Elevated convection is ongoing this morning from
east-central ND into northeast SD. This convection is being aided by
a low-amplitude midlevel shortwave trough moving quickly
northeastward toward northern MN. Midlevel lapse rates are quite
steep (as observed on the 12Z MPX sounding), and recent objective
mesoanalyses depict a corridor of very strong MUCAPE (3000-4000
J/kg) from eastern ND into northwest MN, near and north of a surface
boundary that will move north as a warm front with time today.
Ongoing convection could intensify as it moves into this corridor.
Deep-layer shear is also stronger with northern extent, and could
help to increase storm organization with time this morning.

Large hail and localized severe gusts may accompany these storms as
they move northeastward. The large buoyancy and steep lapse rates
will support a conditional threat of very large hail if any elevated
supercells can become established. Coverage of the severe threat
this morning is uncertain, making the need for short-term watch
issuance unclear. A more extensive severe threat is still expected
across parts of this region later today.
