## THE HIDDEN GEMS OF IRISH FOOD: LESSER-KNOWN REGIONAL DISHES WORTH TRYING

date: 2025-06-16, from: Irish Food Hub

<p>Table of Contents 1. Why Regional Irish Food Deserves the Spotlight 2. Waterford Blaa – A Floury Bun with a Protected Name 3. Drisheen, Dulse &#38; Dillisk – Coastal Flavours from Cork to Down 4. Boxty and Cavan Bacon – Ulster’s Humble Staples 5. Connemara Lamb and the Taste of the West Why Regional Irish Food Deserves the Spotlight Irish food is globally known for comforting classics like Irish stew, soda bread, and colcannon. But beyond these staples lies a rich world of local delicacies tied to county, soil, sea, and centuries-old traditions. These lesser-known dishes tell stories of survival, celebration, and place. From salted seaweed to sheep raised on rugged hillsides, Irish regional food is deeply rooted in heritage—and absolutely worth discovering. As Ireland’s food scene continues to evolve, chefs and home cooks alike are rediscovering these regional specialties. Some are being protected by EU status, while others live on in rural kitchens and farmers’ markets. If you want to eat like a true local, these are the dishes to seek out. Waterford Blaa – A Floury Bun with a Protected Name Where to Find It: Waterford and surrounding areas What It Is: A soft white bread roll, dusted heavily with flour and protected under EU PGI (Protected Geographical Indication) status. The Waterford blaa might sound like a simple bread roll, but to the locals, it’s a cherished part of daily life. Its origins are believed to date back to the 17th century with the arrival of the Huguenots, who introduced French-style white flour baking. The name “blaa” may come from the French word “blanc,” meaning white. Soft and slightly chewy, the blaa is typically served with butter, rashers, or sausage for breakfast—but also makes a perfect sandwich base any time of day. Only bakeries in Waterford can produce the true version, making it a food worth traveling for. Try it with: Dry-cured bacon and Irish cheddar for a classic Waterford sandwich. View Our Blaa Recipe Drisheen, Dulse &#38; Dillisk – Coastal Flavours from Cork to Down Where to Find It: Cork, Derry, Down, and coastal towns along the Atlantic Drisheen: A traditional blood sausage made with sheep’s blood, oatmeal, and herbs, primarily eaten in Cork. It&#8217;s often served with tripe in a dish known locally as &#8220;packet and tripe.&#8221; Dulse/Dillisk: Edible seaweed harvested along Ireland’s rocky coastlines. Chewy, salty, and rich in minerals, dulse is often eaten dried as a snack or chopped into seafood dishes. These dishes are strong reminders of Ireland’s resourceful coastal communities. Where meat was scarce, seaweed and offal-based recipes like drisheen provided vital nutrition. Today, they offer a connection to a more sustainable and ancient way of eating. Modern Twist: Seaweed now features in artisan butters, soda breads, and even chocolate across Ireland’s gourmet food scene. View Our Drisheen Recipe Related Article: The health benefits of irish sea vegetables: from kelp to dulse and nori Boxty and Cavan Bacon – Ulster’s Humble Staples Where to Find It: Counties Cavan, Leitrim, Fermanagh, and across Ulster Boxty: A traditional potato pancake made with a mix of grated raw and mashed potatoes. It’s a staple in Northern and Western counties, especially around Leitrim and Cavan. Cavan Bacon: Cured bacon or gammon from County Cavan, often paired with cabbage, parsley sauce, or even soda bread stuffing. Boxty’s versatility allows it to be pan-fried, boiled, or baked. It was once considered a poor man’s food, designed to stretch ingredients during lean times, but now it’s featured on many restaurant menus with upscale accompaniments like smoked salmon, wild mushrooms, or poached eggs. Tip: Look for local cafés in Leitrim or Sligo offering boxty brunches for a true regional experience. View Our Boxty Recipe Connemara Lamb and the Taste of the West Where to Find It: Connemara, County Galway, and surrounding western regions What It Is: Free-range lamb raised on the heather-covered hills and salty grasses of the Connemara region, known for its distinctive flavor and tenderness. Connemara lamb is a true example of &#8220;terroir&#8221;—the idea that the environment shapes the taste of food. These sheep graze freely across the rugged west coast landscape, and the result is meat that’s earthy, slightly gamey, and deeply flavorful. It’s a seasonal delight, often celebrated in local food festivals. This lamb is often simply roasted or slow-cooked with rosemary and garlic, letting the natural flavor shine. Many foodies travel to Galway just for a taste during peak season. Pair it with: Creamy mashed potatoes and wild garlic butter for an unforgettable Irish dinner. Conclusion: Celebrating Ireland&#8217;s Culinary Diversity These lesser-known regional foods aren’t just delicious—they’re stories, landscapes, and legacies on a plate. While Guinness and Irish stew remain icons, it’s dishes like the Waterford blaa, boxty, and Connemara lamb that truly showcase the diversity of Ireland’s culinary culture. Whether you&#8217;re exploring a farmers&#8217; market or a countryside café, keep an eye out for these hidden gems—they may just surprise your tastebuds and connect you more deeply to the soul of Ireland.</p>

## CARRAGEEN MOSS JELLY

date: 2025-06-16, from: Irish Food Hub

<p>Carrageen Moss Jelly – A Traditional Irish Seaweed Dessert Preparation Time: 15 minutes (plus soaking time) Cooking Time: 30 minutes Serves: 4 Carrageen Moss Jelly is a unique and wholesome dessert made from dried Irish moss (a type of red seaweed) that has long been prized in Ireland for its health-giving properties. Traditionally used to soothe coughs and colds, this natural gelatin alternative creates a light, nourishing jelly often flavored with lemon or vanilla. It&#8217;s a taste of coastal heritage in every spoonful. Ingredients 15g dried carrageen moss (also called Irish moss) 600ml (2½ cups) water 1 cinnamon stick (optional) 1 lemon – zest and juice 1–2 tbsp honey or sugar (to taste) 250ml (1 cup) milk (or almond/oat milk for dairy-free option) 1 tsp vanilla extract (optional) Instructions Rinse the dried carrageen moss under cold water to remove any sand or impurities. Soak in cold water for about 15 minutes until it expands and softens. Drain and place in a saucepan with 600ml of fresh water, the cinnamon stick, and lemon zest. Bring to a gentle boil, then simmer for 25–30 minutes, stirring occasionally. The liquid will thicken as the moss releases its natural gel. Strain the mixture through a sieve or muslin cloth into a bowl, pressing down to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard the solids. Add honey or sugar, lemon juice, milk, and vanilla to the warm liquid. Stir well until combined. Pour into serving glasses or molds. Let cool, then chill in the fridge for at least 2–3 hours until set. Serving Suggestions Serve chilled, plain or topped with a dollop of whipped cream, fruit compote, or a drizzle of heather honey. A refreshing and soothing dessert with a rich Irish coastal history. Health Note Carrageen moss has been used in traditional Irish remedies for generations to help with colds, congestion, and digestion. While not a substitute for medical advice, it remains a time-honored comfort during flu season.</p>

## DUBLIN CODDLE SOUP

date: 2025-06-16, from: Irish Food Hub

<p>Dublin Coddle Soup – A Hearty Twist on an Irish Classic Preparation Time: 15 minutes Cooking Time: 45 minutes Serves: 4–6 Dublin Coddle Soup is a comforting and brothy version of the traditional Irish coddle – a dish beloved in the capital for generations. Featuring tender sausages, smoky bacon, soft potatoes, and sweet onions all simmered in a rich stock, this one-pot wonder captures the rustic soul of Irish home cooking. Perfect for chilly days, casual family dinners, or a taste of Dublin heritage in a bowl. Ingredients 4 pork sausages (or Irish-style bangers) 150g thick-cut bacon or rashers, chopped 1 large onion, sliced 2 cloves garlic, minced 3 medium potatoes, peeled and diced 2 carrots, sliced (optional) 1 bay leaf 1 tsp dried thyme 1 tbsp chopped fresh parsley (plus extra for garnish) 1 litre (4 cups) chicken or vegetable stock Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste 1 tbsp butter or oil for sautéing Instructions In a large pot, heat the butter or oil over medium heat. Brown the sausages on all sides, then remove and slice into thick chunks. Add the bacon to the same pot and cook until lightly crisp. Add the onions and garlic, sautéing until soft and fragrant. Return the sausages to the pot along with potatoes, carrots, thyme, and bay leaf. Stir to combine. Pour in the stock and bring to a gentle boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 30–35 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender and the flavors have melded. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Remove the bay leaf before serving. Serving Suggestions Ladle into warm bowls and garnish with chopped parsley. Serve with slices of buttered soda bread or crusty brown bread to soak up the flavorful broth. A pint of Irish stout makes the perfect pairing. Tip For a thicker consistency, lightly mash some of the potatoes in the pot before serving. You can also stir in a splash of cream for added richness.</p>
