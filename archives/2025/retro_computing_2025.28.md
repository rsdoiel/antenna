date: 2025-07-14, from: FreeDOS News

<div class="markdown_content"><p>If you need to transfer data between DOS and another system, here's another option: NetMount enables DOS systems to access shared directories from remote machines as if they were local drives. It operates over the UDP protocol. It has two parts: <code>netmount</code> that runs on the DOS client, and <code>netmount-server</code> that runs on Linux, Mac, or Windows. The source code is available at <a class="" href="https://github.com/jrohel/NetMount" rel="nofollow">NetMount on GitHub</a> and is available under the GNU GPL.
