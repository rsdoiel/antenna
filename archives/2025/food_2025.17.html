<h2 id="hetal-vasavadas-earl-grey-and-lemon-economy-cake">Hetal
Vasavada’s Earl Grey and Lemon Economy Cake</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-02, from: Taste of Home</p>
<p>This easy cake is inspired by my absolute favorite vintage cookbook,
<i title="" data-original-title="">The Settlement Cookbook</i>. The
original Economy Cake recipe was designed to be budget-friendly, using
just one egg and a few pantry staples. I’ve given it my own spin with
Earl Grey tea and fresh lemon zest. There’s something magical about how
Earl Grey adds a gentle floral-citrus flavor (almost like Froot Loops!)
that transforms it into something I could serve at a party. You could
make the cake even <i title="" data-original-title="">more</i>
economical by swapping the egg for 1/4 cup of mayo or sour cream. —Hetal
Vasavada, San Francisco, California</p>

<h2 id="lucy-wangs-ice-cream-cake-pops">Lucy Wang’s Ice Cream Cake
Pops</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-02, from: Taste of Home</p>
<p>Are you still bringing store-bought cupcakes to birthdays and baby
showers? Try this recipe instead, because I guarantee you it’s so much
cuter. Yes, it’s a cake pop, but it looks like an ice cream cone. You
can do tons of variations, like Oreo cake with chocolate coating,
confetti with strawberry, or red velvet with white chocolate. You can
also do half-and-half color combos for a snow cone look. —Lucy Wang, Los
Angeles, California</p>

<h2 id="lucy-wangs-zongzi">Lucy Wang’s Zongzi</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-30, from: Taste of Home</p>
<p>This traditional Chinese dish ties back to a true story of a beloved
poet named Qu Yuan who was wrongfully accused of treason. People
commemorate him each year on the fifth day of the fifth month on the
Lunar calendar (usually toward the end of May or June), with dragon boat
festivities and these bamboo leaves stuffed with sticky rice and pork
belly. Cook a ton of these in advance and keep them in a zip-top bag in
the freezer. Thaw them in the fridge overnight and microwave for two
minutes in the leaves, or boil them for 10 to 15 minutes directly from
the freezer. You can get the leaves on Amazon. Everything else can be
found at a local Asian market like HMart. —Lucy Wang, Los Angeles,
California</p>

<p>date: 2025-04-28, from: Taste of Home</p>
<p>Summer was made for pasta salad, and this creamy, colorful dish is my
go-to. My mom whipped it up in the ’90s when every pasta salad was
smothered with Italian dressing. That version wasn’t my mom’s speed, so
she took a risk and switched it up with mayo. She nervously brought it
to a pool party, and to her surprise, it was an instant hit. Soon, it
became a highly requested dish. Now my own kids ask for it too. —Elise

ASIAN-IRISH FOOD CONNECTION: HOW CHINESE AND INDIAN CUISINE BECAME IRISH
STAPLES</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-28, from: Irish Food Hub</p>
<p>
A New Flavor Arrives – Immigration and Ireland’s Expanding Palate
Ireland, long known for its hearty traditional dishes like stews, soda
bread, and roasts, began to experience a quiet culinary revolution in
the latter half of the 20th century. As waves of immigrants from China,
India, and other parts of Asia arrived — many seeking new opportunities
in a modernizing Ireland — they brought with them rich food traditions
that would soon intertwine with Irish tastes in unexpected ways. In the
1970s and 80s, small Chinese takeaways started appearing in towns across
the country. These weren’t the sprawling restaurants of major cities,
but modest, family-run operations offering a handful of familiar dishes
like sweet and sour chicken, fried rice, and chow mein. At the same
time, Indian cuisine was beginning to find its footing, introducing bold
spices, curries, and savory breads to a population mostly accustomed to
salt, pepper, and parsley. The Irish public, curious and increasingly
cosmopolitan, embraced these new flavors — but with a twist. Asian
recipes were adapted to suit local tastes: milder spices, simpler
ingredients, generous portions. Dishes evolved into a fusion that was
neither fully traditional Chinese or Indian, nor fully Irish — something
entirely new was taking shape. In this beginning phase, food wasn’t just
about nourishment — it was about connection. It was about adventure on a
plate, in a country that was just starting to open up to the wider
world. These early interactions laid the groundwork for some of
Ireland’s most beloved late-night staples, like curry chips and spice
bags, which would soon become part of the national identity. Curry Chips
– The Birth of a Beloved Irish Dish If there’s one dish that perfectly
symbolizes the Asian-Irish food fusion, it’s the humble yet mighty curry
chips. Found everywhere from chip shops in rural villages to bustling
city center takeaways, curry chips are simple: thick-cut, golden Irish
chips (fries) drenched in a mild, savory curry sauce. But behind that
simplicity is a story of cultural blending that captured Ireland’s heart
— and taste buds. In the late 20th century, as Chinese takeaways spread
across Ireland, many shop owners adapted their menus to local
expectations. Knowing that Irish customers loved their traditional
chips, enterprising chefs began offering a new option: chips served with
a rich, comforting curry sauce — one that wasn’t too spicy, but just
exotic enough to feel exciting. The curry sauce itself was a fusion
invention, often based on a Cantonese-style curry popular in Hong Kong,
modified further to fit Irish palates. It was thick, slightly sweet,
with just a little heat — a flavor that complemented the crispy, fluffy
texture of freshly fried chips perfectly. What made curry chips so
iconic wasn’t just the taste — it was the experience. Hot, steamy chips
in a paper carton, soaked in warm curry, eaten on a cold Irish night
after a pub crawl or a GAA match. It became a ritual, a comfort food
that bridged traditional Irish eating habits with the vibrant flavors of
Asia. By the 1990s, curry chips weren’t just a novelty; they were an
expectation. And today, they’re a beloved classic, proudly Irish in
spirit yet deeply rooted in the country’s immigrant story. The Spice Bag
– Ireland’s New National Obsession If curry chips were the first great
Asian-Irish fusion hit, the spice bag was the sensation that
followed.Appearing sometime around the early 2010s, particularly in
Dublin and other major cities, the spice bag quickly skyrocketed from
local secret to nationwide craze — and it remains one of Ireland’s most
beloved takeaway orders today. At its core, a spice bag is beautifully
chaotic: crispy chips, deep-fried chicken pieces (often shredded or in
bite-sized chunks), tossed together with sautéed peppers, onions, and a
house-made spice mix. The flavor is salty, spicy, slightly sweet, and
completely addictive. Each takeaway has its own version, but the basic
experience is the same: a warm paper bag stuffed with pure comfort. The
spice bag’s creation was no accident. Irish Chinese takeaways, already
well-experienced in blending traditional Asian flavors with Irish
preferences, saw an opportunity to combine familiar ingredients into
something entirely new. Influences from Cantonese cooking (salt and
pepper seasoning, fried chicken) blended with the Irish love of hearty,
fried food and generous portions. Social media played a major role in
the spice bag’s explosion. Suddenly, people were posting about their
late-night spice bag cravings, sharing “best spice bag in town”
recommendations, and even inspiring spice bag–themed merchandise. It
became more than food — it became a cultural moment. Unlike traditional
dishes, the spice bag is entirely Irish in origin, despite its
Asian-inspired flavors. It’s a symbol of modern Ireland: diverse,
inventive, and proudly blending different worlds into something uniquely
its own. At its core, a spice bag is beautifully chaotic: crispy chips,
deep-fried chicken pieces, tossed together with sautéed peppers, onions,
and a house-made spice mix. A New Flavor Profile – How Asian Spices and
Techniques Influenced Irish Cooking While curry chips and spice bags
captured a particular moment, the impact of Asian cuisine on Ireland has
gone much deeper — changing not just takeaway menus, but also everyday
home cooking, grocery shopping habits, and even restaurant culture. By
the late 1990s, ingredients that once seemed exotic — like garam masala,
soy sauce, ginger, turmeric, and five-spice powder — began appearing on
the shelves of ordinary supermarkets across Ireland. This wasn’t just
about takeaway food anymore; it was about how Irish people cooked at
home.Home cooks started experimenting, blending Asian spices into stews,
roasting meats with hints of soy and ginger, or even creating
Irish-Asian hybrids like curried shepherd’s pie. Restaurants also
evolved. It became increasingly common to find gastropubs offering
dishes like Thai green curry with Irish chicken, beef and black bean
stew with soda bread, or masala-infused seafood chowder. Chefs across
Ireland recognized that diners wanted more adventurous flavors, but
still craved comfort — and so fusion cuisine thrived. Even traditional
celebrations, like Christmas, began to feature
