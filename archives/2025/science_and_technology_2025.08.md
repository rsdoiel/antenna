## The DOS 3.3 SYS.COM bug hunt!

date: 2025-02-24, from: OS News

Last year somebody reported a problem with the DOS 3.3 SYS.COM command when used with NetDrive. They started with a valid FAT12 image, ran SYS.COM to make it bootable, and then they were not able to mount the image using NetDrive again. Running SYS.COM against the image had broken something. Besides copying the operating system&#8217;s hidden files to the target drive letter, SYS.COM also copies some boot code into the first sector of the disk. In general it does not make sense to run it against a NetDrive image because you already had to boot DOS to mount the image, but it should not hurt anything. So I decided to have a look at what was going on. ↫ Michael Brutman A good old classic bug hunt in some retro DOS code from roughly 1987. This one&#8217;s a bit more technical and in-depth than these things usually are, and quite a bit of it goes over my head, but I&#8217;m sure since most of you are much smarter than I am, you&#8217;ll do a better job understanding what&#8217;s going on.

## Illumos on SPARC: possible, but problematic

date: 2025-02-23, from: OS News

While SPARC may no longer be supported by the main Illumos project, it still works and is still viable. This page brings together a variety of information regarding Illumos on SPARC, not necessarily limited to Tribblix. ↫ Tribblix website It seems running Tribblix &#8211; and other Illumos-based distributions &#8211; on SPARC is still possible, but there are some serious limitations anyone who has tried to use even slightly older operating systems will be fairly familiar with. For instance, since there&#8217;s no Rust for Illumos on SPARC, Firefox and other applications that use it are not available, and Tribblix in particular no longer builds Pale Moon (or LibreOffice). Rust is available on Solaris 11, though, so it may be possible to bring it to Illumos. In a similar vein, Go also isn&#8217;t available for SPARC either. As far as hardware support goes, it&#8217;s a bit of a mixed bag, as systems that should work do, in fact, not, and even systems that do work run into a very familiar problem: graphics card support is a big issue. This is a problem plaguing X.org on any outdated or sidelined architecture, and it seems Illumos is also affected. Obviously, this greatly reduces the usefulness of Illumos on workstations, but is less of an issue on servers. You&#8217;ll run into the same problem when trying to run NetBSD, OpenBSD, or Linux in, say, PA-RISC hardware. Of course, the problem is both a lack of people interested in and capable of contributing to keeping stuff running on older architectures, further spurred on by a dwindling supply of hardware available at reasonable prices. Sad, but there isn&#8217;t much that can be done about it.
