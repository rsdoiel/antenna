id="the-eus-age-verification-application-requires-a-google-or-apple-account-and-google-approved-android-device-or-iphone">The
EU’s age-verification application requires a Google or Apple account and
Google-approved Android device or iPhone</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>The European Union is in the process of testing an age-verification
application, which people can use to verify their age in a
privacy-preserving manner (in theory, of course). There’s countless
important discussions to be had about whether or not age verification,
privacy-preserving or not, is even something we should want, but that’s
a topic for another time and for people smarter than I. For now, several
member states are currently testing the application on a voluntary
basis, and the application itself is open source, with the code hosted
on GitHub. Aside from the obvious concerns about just how private such
an application can even be, and concerns about whether or not we should
even want something like this, there’s another major problem: the
application intends to make use of and require application and device
verification by using the proprietary tools for such functionality from
Google and Apple, built into Android and iOS, respectively. Listed as
future “features”: App and device verification based on Google Play
Integrity API and Apple App Attestation ↫ The application’s GitHub page
This is a massive problem. For reasons that should be obvious to anyone
with at least six functioning neurons, the European Union, as well as
countless other countries, are trying to reduce their dependency on US
technology companies. As such, it’s indefensible to then require anyone
who needs to use age verification in the European Union to use an
application that will only work on Google-approved Android devices and
even then, only when installed from the Google Play Store, with the only
alternative being, of all things, Apple’s iOS. This means that the EU
will require anyone who needs age verification to have either a Google
or an Apple account, and can only use Google-approved Android or iOS.
This application would not work on, say, GrapheneOS or any other
non-Google-approved Android ROM – in fact, even if you were to compile
the application yourself, you wouldn’t be able to actually use it
because it wouldn’t be installed from the Google Play Store. Of course,
any mobile operating other than Android or iOS need not apply either.
The danger of tying age verification to Google and Apple did not go by
unnoticed, and a GitHub issue raised the issue a few weeks ago. I would
like to strongly urge to abandon this plan. Requiring a dependency on
American tech giants for age verification further deepens the EU’s
dependency on America and the USA’s control over the internet.
Especially in the current political climate I hope I do not have to
explain how undesirable and dangerous that is. ↫ TheLastProject in the
GitHub issue The comment thread attached to the issue is long, but
during the two weeks since the issue was raised, nobody from the
application’s team has answered or even acknowledged people’s concerns,
which doesn’t exactly inspire confidence in this being taken seriously.
I just hope that with this entire project being in the early testing
phases, at least someone manages to realise tying this to Google and
Apple is one of the dumbest ideas in a long, long time.</p>

<h2 id="samsung-removes-bootloader-unlocking-with-one-ui-8">Samsung
removes bootloader unlocking with One UI 8</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>Have a Samsung phone (outside of the United States), and want to
unlock the bootloader? Well, soon you won’t be able to do so anymore, as
Samsung seems to be removing this option from their phones – including
already sold models being upgraded to One UI 8. Bootloader unlocking is
a popular way to breathe new life into older devices, by loading
unofficial software onto a device, like custom ROMs, gaining root
access, custom kernels, etc. This option will be taken away from users
with One UI 8. This means not only is the OEM Unlock not visible in
Settings anymore, but the bootloader doesn’t even contain any of the
code required to unlock itself. This means a workaround to brute force
it open is not possible at all, unless Samsung updates the bootloader to
add this logic back in. ↫ Josh Skinner at SammyGuru And so, the ongoing
process of locking down Android to a point where it becomes nigh-on
indistinguishable from iOS’ locked-down, anti-user nature continues
unabated. Samsung is the default choice for Android users in a lot of
places around the world, and seeing them, too move ever closer to fully
locking down their phones is terrible news for consumers. We should be
striving for less restrictive computing, not more. Combined with
persistent rumours that Google is looking into effectively taking
Android closed source, leaving only a stub AOSP behind, the future of
Android as an least somewhat “open” platform looks quite grim
indeed.</p>
