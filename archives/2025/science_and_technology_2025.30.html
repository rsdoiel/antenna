<h2 id="openbsd-gets-cde">OpenBSD gets CDE</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>Adjusted for the inevitable progress of time, the Common Desktop
Environment or CDE is the best desktop environment of all time, and no,
I will not be taking question at this time. OpenBSD wasn’t yet graced by
CDE’s presence, but this is currently changing as the first commit for
porting CDE to OpenBSD has appeared. It’s still rough around the edges
and very slightly tested. I wouldn’t use is as a daily driver, it’s old
unsecure code but it’s fun if you want to bring back memories. ↫ Antoine
at the openbsd-ports mailing list On top of that, this being the initial
commit also means there’s probably bugs and other issues lurking in the
code, so caution is definitely advised.</p>

id="microsoft-finally-standardises-cpu-usage-reporting-in-task-manager">Microsoft
finally standardises CPU usage reporting in Task Manager</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>Microsoft is finally changing the way Task Manager reports CPU
utilisation to make it consistent across the different tabs. So
apparently this has been gradually rolling out to the 34 different
Windows 11 beta dev preview testing alpha release candidate service pack
4 channels since early this year, but then stopped the roll-out to fix
some issues. These issues seem fixed now, as the roll-out restarted this
week. It”s an important change that I think y’all will care about. From
the original announcement of the change back in February: We are
beginning to roll out a change to the way Task Manager calculates CPU
utilization for the Processes, Performance, and Users pages. Task
Manager will now use the standard metrics to display CPU workload
consistently across all pages and aligning with industry standards and
third-party tools. For backward compatibility, a new optional column
called CPU Utility is available (hidden by default) on the Details tab
showing the previous CPU value used on the Processes page. ↫ Amanda
Langowski and Brandon LeBlanc at the Windows Blogs Before this change,
Task Manager’s Processes tab didn’t take the number of processor cores
into account when calculating PCU usage, so you could see a process at
100% CPU usage even if it was only using one core. These new changes
standardise CPU usage reporting across all tabs, taking the number of
CPU cores into account properly. Rejoice.</p>

<h2 id="why-risc-v-linux-needs-everyone-upstream">Why RISC-V Linux needs
everyone upstream</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>RISC-V has been supported in the upstream Linux kernel since 2017.
But without a common hardware baseline, ensuring compatibility across
builds and distros hasn’t been easy. The ecosystem was in need of a
compelling, clearly defined hardware target – something both software
and hardware teams could rally around to produce silicon capable of
running stable, enterprise-grade software. This target arrived in
October 2024 with the ratification of the application-class RVA23
Profile – RISC-V-speak for a baseline configuration, similar to
microarchitecture feature levels in x86. The culmination of years of
progress, RVA23 brings together the work done to shape the ISA and
standardize key extensions such as vector, bit manipulation and
hypervisor. ↫ James De Vile at RISC-V International’s blog Such a
standard, stable baseline is incredibly welcome, and RISC-V working to
have everything part of the upstream Linux kernel is crucial. Having to
deal with out-of-tree patches and drivers and specific builds for
specific boards is a nightmare – look at Linux on ARM – and hinders
adoption of RISC-V.</p>

id="the-eus-age-verification-application-requires-a-google-or-apple-account-and-google-approved-android-device-or-iphone">The
EU’s age-verification application requires a Google or Apple account and
Google-approved Android device or iPhone</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>The European Union is in the process of testing an age-verification
application, which people can use to verify their age in a
privacy-preserving manner (in theory, of course). There’s countless
important discussions to be had about whether or not age verification,
privacy-preserving or not, is even something we should want, but that’s
a topic for another time and for people smarter than I. For now, several
member states are currently testing the application on a voluntary
basis, and the application itself is open source, with the code hosted
on GitHub. Aside from the obvious concerns about just how private such
an application can even be, and concerns about whether or not we should
even want something like this, there’s another major problem: the
application intends to make use of and require application and device
verification by using the proprietary tools for such functionality from
Google and Apple, built into Android and iOS, respectively. Listed as
future “features”: App and device verification based on Google Play
Integrity API and Apple App Attestation ↫ The application’s GitHub page
This is a massive problem. For reasons that should be obvious to anyone
with at least six functioning neurons, the European Union, as well as
countless other countries, are trying to reduce their dependency on US
technology companies. As such, it’s indefensible to then require anyone
who needs to use age verification in the European Union to use an
application that will only work on Google-approved Android devices and
even then, only when installed from the Google Play Store, with the only
alternative being, of all things, Apple’s iOS. This means that the EU
will require anyone who needs age verification to have either a Google
or an Apple account, and can only use Google-approved Android or iOS.
This application would not work on, say, GrapheneOS or any other
non-Google-approved Android ROM – in fact, even if you were to compile
the application yourself, you wouldn’t be able to actually use it
because it wouldn’t be installed from the Google Play Store. Of course,
any mobile operating other than Android or iOS need not apply either.
The danger of tying age verification to Google and Apple did not go by
unnoticed, and a GitHub issue raised the issue a few weeks ago. I would
like to strongly urge to abandon this plan. Requiring a dependency on
American tech giants for age verification further deepens the EU’s
dependency on America and the USA’s control over the internet.
Especially in the current political climate I hope I do not have to
explain how undesirable and dangerous that is. ↫ TheLastProject in the
GitHub issue The comment thread attached to the issue is long, but
during the two weeks since the issue was raised, nobody from the
application’s team has answered or even acknowledged people’s concerns,
which doesn’t exactly inspire confidence in this being taken seriously.
I just hope that with this entire project being in the early testing
phases, at least someone manages to realise tying this to Google and
Apple is one of the dumbest ideas in a long, long time.</p>

<h2 id="samsung-removes-bootloader-unlocking-with-one-ui-8">Samsung
removes bootloader unlocking with One UI 8</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>Have a Samsung phone (outside of the United States), and want to
unlock the bootloader? Well, soon you won’t be able to do so anymore, as
Samsung seems to be removing this option from their phones – including
already sold models being upgraded to One UI 8. Bootloader unlocking is
a popular way to breathe new life into older devices, by loading
unofficial software onto a device, like custom ROMs, gaining root
access, custom kernels, etc. This option will be taken away from users
with One UI 8. This means not only is the OEM Unlock not visible in
Settings anymore, but the bootloader doesn’t even contain any of the
code required to unlock itself. This means a workaround to brute force
it open is not possible at all, unless Samsung updates the bootloader to
add this logic back in. ↫ Josh Skinner at SammyGuru And so, the ongoing
process of locking down Android to a point where it becomes nigh-on
indistinguishable from iOS’ locked-down, anti-user nature continues
unabated. Samsung is the default choice for Android users in a lot of
places around the world, and seeing them, too move ever closer to fully
locking down their phones is terrible news for consumers. We should be
striving for less restrictive computing, not more. Combined with
persistent rumours that Google is looking into effectively taking
Android closed source, leaving only a stub AOSP behind, the future of
Android as an least somewhat “open” platform looks quite grim
indeed.</p>
