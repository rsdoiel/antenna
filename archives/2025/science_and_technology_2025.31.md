## Perplexity is using stealth, undeclared crawlers to evade website no-crawl directives

date: 2025-08-04, from: OS News

We are observing stealth crawling behavior from Perplexity, an AI-powered answer engine. Although Perplexity initially crawls from their declared user agent, when they are presented with a network block, they appear to obscure their crawling identity in an attempt to circumvent the website’s preferences. We see continued evidence that Perplexity is repeatedly modifying their user agent and changing their source&#160;ASNs&#160;to hide their crawling activity, as well as ignoring — or sometimes failing to even fetch —&#160;robots.txt&#160;files. The Internet as we have known it for the past three decades is&#160;rapidly changing, but one thing remains constant: it is built on trust. There are clear preferences that crawlers should be transparent, serve a clear purpose, perform a specific activity, and, most importantly, follow website directives and preferences. Based on Perplexity’s observed behavior, which is incompatible with those preferences, we have de-listed them as a verified bot and added heuristics to our managed rules that block this stealth crawling. ↫ The CloudFlare Blog Never forget they destroyed Aaron Swartz&#8217;s life &#8211; literally &#8211; for downloading a few JSTOR articles.

## Orbitiny Desktop 1.0 Pilot 4 released

date: 2025-08-03, from: OS News

It&#8217;s not every day you stumble upon an X11 desktop environment you&#8217;ve never hard of, but today&#8217;s one of those days. The Orbitiny Desktop Environment is a one-person project, consisting of an entirely custom desktop environment written in Qt. Version 1.0 Pilot 4 was just released. Built from the ground up using Qt and coded in C++, Orbitiny Desktop is a new, 100% portable, innovative and traditional but modern looking desktop environment for Linux. Innovative because it has features not seen in any other desktop environment before while keeping traditional aspects of computing alive (desktop icons, menus etc). Portable because you can run it on any distro and on any live CD and that&#8217;s because everything gets saved inside the directory that gets created when the archive is extracted (this can be changed so that the settings go to $HOME/.config/orbitiny). ↫ Orbitiny Desktop Environment Gitea page It&#8217;s got all the usual amenities like a desktop, panels, and so on, and a custom file manager. It&#8217;s also replete with a ton of small features that you don&#8217;t see very often, like full mouse gesture support on the desktop and a device manager that can enable/disable devices without blacklisting kernel modules. When you cut or copy a file, its icon will get a little emblem to indicate it&#8217;s on the clipboard, you can append and prepend files using simple drag-and-drop operations, you can set individual desktop directories for each virtual desktop, and much more. Now, it&#8217;s technically not a full desktop environment, because it doesn&#8217;t have things like a session manager, power manager, various hardware configuration panels, and so on, but it can be run on top of existing desktop environments. While it has basic Wayland support, not all components work there, so X11 is the main focus for now. Considering it&#8217;s a one-person project, you can&#8217;t expect a bug or issue-free experience, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s any less damn impressive. I honestly feel like there&#8217;s something valuable and interesting here, and I&#8217;d love for more people to get involved to see where this can go. There&#8217;s clearly a ton of love and dedication here, and the various unique features clearly set it apart from everything else. If you have the skills, consider helping out.

## Introduction to Qubes OS when you do not know what it is

date: 2025-08-03, from: OS News

Solène Rapenne, who writes a lot about and contributes to operating systems like OpenBSD and Qubes OS, has published a primer about what, exactly, Qubes OS is. I like to call Qubes OS a meta operating system, because it is not a Linux / BSD / Windows based OS: its core is Xen (some kind of virtualization enabled kernel). Not only it&#8217;s Xen based, but by design it is meant to run virtual machines, hence the name &#8220;meta operating system&#8221; which is an OS meant to run many OSes make sense to me. ↫ Solène Rapenne Rapenne explains the various ways in which isolated virtual machines are used in Qubes OS, and it&#8217;s easy to see just how secure Qubes OS&#8217; way of doing things is. At the same time, it seems quite cumbersome to me as a regular user, and I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m up for dealing with all of that. If you do security research, handle private or classified data, are a whistleblower or an investigative journalist, thoug, Qubes seems like a natural choice. Interesting to note is that Rapenne used to use OpenBSD for her security work, but moved to Qubes OS because its virtual machine infrastructure is far more robust, and hardware support is better, as well.

## A real PowerBook: the Macintosh Application Environment on a PA-RISC laptop

date: 2025-08-03, from: OS News

In October 1997 you could have bought a PowerBook 3400c running up to a 240MHz PowerPC 603e for $6500 , which was briefly billed as the world&#8217;s fastest laptop, or you could have bought this monster new to the market, the RDI PrecisionBook running up to a 160MHz (later 180MHz) PA-7300LC starting at $12,000 . Both provided onboard Ethernet, SCSI and CardBus PCMCIA slots. On the other hand, while the 3400c had an internal media bay for either a floppy or CD-ROM, both external options on the PrecisionBook, the PrecisionBook gave you a 1024&#215;768 LCD (versus 800&#215;600 on the 3400c), a bigger keyboard, at least two 2.5&#8243; hard disk bays and up to 512MB of RAM (versus 144MB) — and HP-UX. And, through the magic of Apple&#8217;s official Macintosh Application Environment, you could do anything on it an HP PA-RISC workstation could do and run 68K Mac software on it at the same time. Look at the photograph and see: on our 160MHz unit we&#8217;ve got HP-UX 11.00 CDE running simultaneously with a full Macintosh System 7.5.3 desktop. Yes, only a real Power Mac could run PowerPC software back then, but 68K software was still plentiful and functional. Might this have been a viable option to have your expensive cake and eat it too? We&#8217;ll find out and run some real apps on it (including&#160;that&#160;game we must all try running), analyze its performance and technical underpinnings, and uncover an unusual artifact of its history hidden in the executable. ↫ Cameron Kaiser at Old Vintage Computing Research I actually have Apple&#8217;s Macintosh Application Environment installed and running on my PA-RISC machines, and it&#8217;s incredible just how well-made and complete it really is. You get a full Mac desktop and its applications, excellent integration with the host, file sharing between host and client, and so much more. Running it on newer versions of HP-UX than it was originally intended for does lead to the odd issue here and there, but due to HP-UX&#8217; excellent backwards compatibility, it all just works. It has created this odd situation that my 2004 HP c8000 machine, with two of the fastest dual-core PA-RISC processors ever made, will most likely be the fastest machine I&#8217;ll ever officially run classic Mac OS on. Sure, you can use other emulators not created and blessed by Apple and run classic Mac OS on much faster hardware, but if you want to stick to official, supported methods of running the classic Mac OS, it doesn&#8217;t get much faster than this.

## “AWS deleted my 10-year account and all data without warning”

date: 2025-08-03, from: OS News

AWS: Not even once. This prominent Ruby developer lost his entire test environment &#8211; which, ironically, was pivotal to AWS&#8217; own infrastructure &#8211; because of a rogue team within AWS itself that apparently answers to no one and worked hard to cover up a dumb mistake. On July 23, 2025, AWS deleted my 10-year-old account and every byte of data I had stored with them. No warning. No grace period. No recovery options. Just complete digital annihilation. This is the story of a catastrophic internal mistake at AWS MENA, a 20-day support nightmare where I couldn’t get a straight answer to “Does my data still exist?”, and what it reveals about trusting cloud providers with your data. ↫ Abdelkader Boudih Nightmare scenario doesn&#8217;t even begin to describe what happened here.
