Mesoscale Discussion 0854
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0656 AM CDT Sun May 18 2025

Areas affected...central Arkansas and northern Mississippi

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 284...

Valid 181156Z - 181400Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 284
continues.

SUMMARY...Long-lived cluster of thunderstorms, with a history of
producing wind damage, continues to move through central Arkansas.
The overall environment should continue to support a severe threat
ahead of this MCS through at least mid morning.

DISCUSSION...Long-lived linear MCS, with a history of producing wind
damage, continues to move east-southeast through much of Arkansas
this morning. This MCS is moving along a west-northwest to
east-southeast CAPE gradient stretching from northeast Oklahoma into
southern Georgia and is following a similar path as to an earlier
MCS from last evening into earlier this morning. 

The overall large-scale environment will continue to support
maintenance of this MCS as the MCS has access to MUCAPE greater than
2000 J/kg and effective shear around 50 knots. The organization of
the MCS, the overall favorable environment,and knowledge that the
earlier MCS traversed a similar environment and is continuing
through Alabama supports the severe threat through the morning. A
downstream watch may become necessary for portions of far eastern
Arkansas and northern Mississippi as the MCS approaches the edge of
Severe Thunderstorm Watch #284.

Mesoscale Discussion 0853
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0640 AM CDT Sun May 18 2025

Areas affected...Central Alabama and far west-central Georgia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 181140Z - 181245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...A thunderstorm cluster moving across central Alabama will
pose a threat for isolated large hail and wind damage in the near
term. Longer term evolution of this cluster is less certain, but the
area will continue to be monitored for potential watch issuance.

DISCUSSION...Long-lived cluster of thunderstorms continues to move
across central Alabama this morning along the instability gradient.
The strongest of these thunderstorms (located across eastern
Tuscaloosa County) appears to have increased in intensity over the
last hour and has even developed a rear-inflow jet (RIJ) --
suggested by radar reflectivity structure and an increase in
rear-to-front wind speeds. This will pose a damaging wind threat in
the short term.

Additionally, overall reflectivity structure of the thunderstorm
complex suggests the development of a mesoscale convective vortex.
Should this be the case, an increase in updraft intensity would be
expected in the near term owing to increasing convergence and
stronger deep-layer shear. MUCAPE is around 1000 J/kg and deep-layer
shear around 50 knots across the thunderstorm cluster now, but drops
off to around 1000 J/kg and 30-40 knots as the cluster approaches
western Georgia.

As the thunderstorms move east, the lack of clarity of the MCV
evolution and a slightly less favorable environment results in
uncertainty as to whether a severe thunderstorm watch will be needed
downstream. Conditions will continue to be monitored for potential
watch issuance.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 284
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
440 AM CDT Sun May 18 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  West-Central into Central and Eastern Arkansas

* Effective this Sunday morning from 440 AM until 1100 AM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1 inch in diameter possible

SUMMARY...A bowing squall line will likely continue

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0345 AM CDT Sun May 18 2025

Valid 211200Z - 261200Z

...DISCUSSION...
A few strong to isolated severe storms are possible in the eastern
Carolinas on Wednesday as a mid-level trough shifts east across the
eastern CONUS. It is unclear whether there will be substantial time
for destabilization before the surface low/front moves into the
Atlantic Ocean. Therefore, no probabilities are necessary for
Wednesday/D4 at this time.

Once this front moves offshore, a more benign period of severe
storms appears likely. The cold front will move south near the Gulf
Coast and into Florida with mostly sub 60s dewpoints across the
Eastern CONUS in its wake. Farther west the front is expected to
stall across Texas with low-level flow expected to advect moisture
westward to the High Plains on Thursday/D5.

Sufficient moisture should be in place by D7/Saturday across the
Plains. Therefore, some greater severe weather potential will likely
return by next weekend. However, uncertainty currently remains high
regarding the amplitude of the mid-level ridging and the location of
surface boundaries. Therefore, no probabilities have been introduced
at this time.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0112 AM CDT Sun May 18 2025

Valid 191200Z - 201200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHERN NEW MEXICO INTO FAR
WESTERN TEXAS...

...Synopsis...
As a mid-level trough moves out of the Great Basin and into the
southern Great Plains on Monday, dry down-slope winds behind a
dryline in southern New Mexico into far western Texas will result in
Critical fire-weather conditions. Additionally, some persistent
northerly flow over central California will result in Elevated
fire-weather conditions across portions of the San Joaquin valley. 

...Southern New Mexico into Far Western Texas...
Westerly down-slope winds in New Mexico beneath a progressive
mid-level trough, along with deep boundary-layer mixing and a
deepening surface cyclone, will result in widespread Critical
fire-weather conditions across southern New Mexico Monday afternoon.
Winds in excess of 25 MPH with relative humidity at or below 10%
will overspread a region of fuels that are at or above the 90th
annual ERC percentiles, and will result in conditions that support
rapid wildfire ignition and spread. Some locally Extremely Critical
conditions may occur, with winds in excess of 30 MPH, across
portions of southern New Mexico. However, they appear too localized
for highlights at this time. 

...Central California...
Ensemble guidance suggests that deep boundary-layer mixing beneath
persistent mid-level northerly flow will result in Elevated
fire-weather conditions. While fuels are on the more marginal side,
15+ MPH winds and relative humidity at or below 15% will support at
least Elevated highlights.

0336 PM CDT Sat May 17 2025

Areas affected...Upstate New York into Vermont and far western
Massachusetts

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 277...

Valid 172036Z - 172230Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 277
continues.

SUMMARY...Scattered strong to severe storms persist from Upstate New
York into Vermont. Strong gusts, marginal hail, and a brief tornado
remain possible.

DISCUSSION...Storms appear to be producing strong outflow/gusts as
well as hail up to severe limits over northern NY and VT. The area
has destabilized as lapse rates continue to steepen aloft, now with
around 1000 J/kg MLCAPE. However, satellite imagery shows the
effects of midlevel subsidence father south into PA, with
flat/"pancake" cumulus presentation.

Objective analysis does indicate relatively large 0-1 SRH over
VT/MA/NH, with values of 100-150 m2/s2. In addition, early day
clouds have moved out, allowing heating. As such, this general zone
could support a brief tornado as storms approach from the west later
this afternoon.

Areas affected...Southern Arkansas into northeast Louisiana

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 172012Z - 172215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...An isolated thunderstorm or two may pose a large
hail/damaging wind threat through late afternoon. Watch issuance is
not expected.

DISCUSSION...GOES 1-minute imagery shows building cumulus along a
northward advancing warm front across north/northeastern LA.
Multiple weak attempts at convective initiation have been noted over
the past 20 minutes, but it remains unclear if sustained deep
convection will become established. Locally enhanced convergence
associated with the outflow of a decaying supercell to the southeast
may promote adequate ascent for a storm or two within the next
couple of hours. If a storm can become established, the convective
environment (characterized by 2500-3000 J/kg MLCAPE and 50 knots of
effective shear) would support supercellular storm modes (this was
demonstrated by a prior cell that produced 2.5 inch hail near
Jackson, MS). Storm propagation to the southeast along the warm
front/outflow boundary is likely with the potential for severe hail
(possibly as large as 2.5 inches) and damaging gusts. Given the
localized nature of this threat, watch issuance is not anticipated.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0254 PM CDT Sat May 17 2025

Valid 172000Z - 181200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON
AND EVENING OVER NORTHEAST TEXAS...SOUTHEAST OKLAHOMA...SOUTHWEST
ARKANSAS...AND NORTHWEST LOUISIANA.......

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS PORTIONS OF
UPSTATE NEW YORK AND WESTERN NEW ENGLAND...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms producing large to very large hail, damaging
gusts and a couple of tornadoes are expected across the southern
Plains. Additional severe storms are possible across the Northeast.

...20z Update...
Adjustments were made to the 20z to remove the Marginal risk across
portions of Georgia into South Carolina and across the northeast
behind morning convection. 

The Slight Risk and Moderate Risk were nudged further south in far
southern Texas to account for potential for storms to come out of
Mexico this evening with potential for large hail and severe winds. 


Otherwise, the risk areas across the main region of the
southern/central Plains were not changed. Thunderstorm development
has begun across the dryline from southern/central Texas to the Red
River in Oklahoma. See MCD#840 and MCD#838 for more information on
the short term risks in these areas.

..Thornton/Hart.. 05/17/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1117 AM CDT Sat May 17 2025/

...Central TX/Southern OK into the ArkLaTex Region...
Morning water vapor loop shows a well-defined shortwave trough over
southern AZ tracking northeastward.  Ahead of this system, southerly
low-level winds and steep lapse rates aloft have established a very
moist and extremely unstable air mass from southern OK into central
TX.  Dewpoints in the low/mid 70s and ample daytime heating will
yield afternoon MLCAPE values over 4000 J/kg.  As the upper system
and associated mid-level jet max approach the dryline, thunderstorms
are expected to rapidly develop by mid-afternoon.  Splitting
supercells capable of very large hail will be the main initial
concern, along with damaging winds and a tornado or two.  Most model
solutions suggest upscale growth of these storms into a bowing MCS
by evening, tracking eastward across the ArklaTex region.  Have
extended the ENH a little farther east to accommodate this scenario,
with damaging winds and large hail being the main concerns.  This
cluster of storms may persist overnight, tracking into
central/northern MS.

...Northwest OK...
The plume of dense cirrus ahead of the AZ shortwave trough will move
east of northwest OK by late afternoon, allowing strong heating and
destabilization.  This combined with southeasterly low level winds
near a retreating warm front will provide a corridor of strong
instability and favorable low-level shear for supercell development.
 The coverage of storms in this area is uncertain and varied between
the morning CAM solutions.  However, the storms that form will pose
a risk of very large hail, damaging winds, and a tornado or two.  It
is also unclear how far east this threat may persist, with some
concern for an MCS tracking into northeast OK overnight.

...NY/New England...
A progressive shortwave trough and associated mid-level jet is
tracking eastward across the Great Lakes region today.  Cooling
temperatures aloft and strong daytime heating will lead to pockets
of moderate CAPE and steep low/mid level lapse rates.  Storms are
beginning to form across NY and will move into a progressively more
favorable air mass for strong/severe convection (including a few
supercells) by mid-afternoon.  Locally damaging winds are the main
concern, but the strongest cells could also produce hail and perhaps
a tornado or two.  Refer to MCD #837 for further details.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0224 PM CDT Sat May 17 2025

Valid 191200Z - 201200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PORTIONS OF
THE CENTRAL PLAINS INTO MISSOURI...

...SUMMARY...
Severe storms with all severe weather hazards remain likely from
portions of the Midwest to the southern Plains on Monday.

...Synopsis...
The embedded mid-level impulse (responsible for Day 2 severe) will
approach the Great Lakes region as the primary upper trough ejects
into the Plains states on Monday. Some surface low strengthening is
expected along or just north of the KS/OK border by afternoon,
supporting a sharpening dryline along the I-35 corridor, with a warm
front draped from eastern NE to the OH River. Scattered to
potentially widespread thunderstorm development is likely by mid
afternoon along the warm front and ahead of the dryline. With strong
vertical wind shear and instability in place over the Plains to the
Midwest, severe storms with all convective hazards are likely.
Strong thunderstorms may also develop further east along the warm
front over the TN Valley as well.

...Portions of the central Plains into the Midwest...
Scattered showers and thunderstorms may be ongoing at the start of
the period (12Z Monday morning). However, gradual clearing of this
precipitation and associated cloud cover should support
destabilization along and south of a warm front during the
afternoon. Boundary layer heating, along with increasing deep-layer
ascent from the approaching upper trough, will encourage the
development of several thunderstorms along the warm front during the
afternoon, from far eastern NE to the MO/IL border. On the warm side
of the front, 70+ F surface dewpoints beneath steep mid-level lapse
rates will boost MLCAPE to over 3000 J/kg amid 50 kts of effective
bulk shear. NAM forecast soundings depict enlarged hodographs as
well. Supercells may develop along the warm front, accompanied by
large hail. Storms that can remain surface based, along or just
south of the warm front, will have the best chance to produce
tornadoes.

...Portions of the central into southern Plains...
Modest to considerable cloud cover, perhaps accompanied by showers,
may overspread parts of the central and southern Plains Monday
morning. Nonetheless, enough clearing should take place ahead of a
sharpening dryline by afternoon to support considerable
destabilization given steep mid-level lapse rates from an EML. The
dryline should be positioned just west of I-35 by mid-afternoon,
with surface dewpoints ahead of the dryline exceeding upper 60s to
70 F, supporting well over 3000 J/kg MLCAPE on a widespread basis.
Strong southwesterly mid-level flow overspreading southeasterly
surface flow ahead of the low will result in over 50 kts of
effective bulk shear. By mid afternoon, at least scattered supercell
development is expected all along the dryline, from southeast NE to
central OK, with more isolated supercell coverage likely over
northern into central TX. Given ample buoyancy and deep-layer shear,
large hail is expected, with very large hail over 2 inches in
diameter likely with the more dominant supercell structures. By late
afternoon into early evening, the strengthening of the low-level jet
over central and eastern KS/OK will support substantial low-level
veering of the vertical wind profile, with notable low-level
hodograph size/curvature in forecast soundings. As such, the more
dominant, right-moving supercells will have the potential to produce
tornadoes, and at least a few strong tornadoes are possible.

...Portions of the TN Valley...
Multiple rounds of thunderstorms are possible along a residual
baroclinic boundary across the TN Valley, both during the morning
hours, and later in the evening. While not quite as unstable as
points farther to the west, modest mid-level lapse rates amid
elongated hodographs should support multicells, supercells, and
short line segments. The stronger storms may be capable of isolated
instances of large hail, gusty winds, and perhaps a brief tornado.

Valid 181200Z - 191200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PORTIONS OF
CENTRAL KS INTO NORTHERN OK...AND FAR NORTHEAST COLORADO INTO
WESTERN NEBRASKA...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms capable of all severe hazards are still
expected on Sunday across portions of the central and southern
Plains, as well as parts of the central High Plains.

...Synopsis...
A negatively tilted mid-level trough will traverse the central
Rockies and eject into the Plains states, encouraging rapid surface
low development along the CO/KS tomorrow (Sunday). Ahead of the
surface low and sharpening dryline, rapid north-northwestward
advection of relatively rich low-level moisture beneath a pronounced
EML will result in strong buoyancy across much of the central and
southern Plains. Furthermore, a low-level jet will overspread the
Plains states, beneath strong southwesterly 500 mb flow associated
with the ejecting upper trough, resulting in strong vertical speed
and directional shear coinciding with the aforementioned unstable
environment. Multiple clusters of strong to severe thunderstorms are
expected to develop near, and to the north of the surface low, ahead
of the dryline, and along an effective warm front across the central
Plains, with all convective hazards possible. Lastly, isolated
strong storms are possible along a diffuse baroclinic boundary
across the Southeast tomorrow afternoon.

...Portions of the central High Plains...
A narrow corridor of mid to upper 50s F surface dewpoints may advect
to the north of the surface low by afternoon, ahead of an arching
dryline, where scattered thunderstorms should develop. 8-9 C/km
mid-level lapse rates will overspread this moisture ahead of the
dryline, supporting well over 1000 J/kg MLCAPE amid 50+ kts of
effective bulk shear. Forecast soundings show very long hodographs,
with a subset of these forecast soundings also depicting
enlarged/curved low-level hodographs. Supercells are expected to be
the dominant mode, with large hail the main threat. At least a few
instances of 2+ inch diameter hail and severe gusts may also occur,
along with a few tornadoes. If a mature, discrete supercell can
materialize and achieve substantial residence time within the narrow
warm sector, the storm may become cyclic tornadic in nature.
However, confidence in this scenario is not overly high at this
time.

...Kansas into central Texas...
At least scattered thunderstorms are expected to develop along the
leading edge of greater moisture return along the KS/OK border by
early afternoon. With strong shear/instability already in place,
supercells are likely, accompanied by a large hail threat. Questions
remain how far north the better moisture will return into KS given
possible stabilizing impacts of these storms. However, by mid to
late afternoon, some eastward advancement of the dryline should
encourage a second round of supercell development along the KS/OK
border. Ahead of these storms and south of the effective warm front,
surface dewpoints should exceed 70 F in spots, beneath 8 C/km
mid-level lapse rates, boosting MLCAPE to over 3000 J/kg on a
widespread basis. Substantial veering/strengthening of the vertical
wind fields with height will also result in enlarged, curved
hodographs and over 300 m2/s2 effective SRH sometime between 21-00Z.
Any supercells that can mature and sustain themselves in this
environment will have the potential to produce very large hail
(perhaps exceeding 3 inches in diameter) and tornadoes (some
possibly EF2+). 

Storm coverage is expected to be less across central OK into central
TX owing to less low-level convergence along the dryline. However,
3000+ J/kg MLCAPE amid 300+ m2/s2 effective SRH will support
supercells capable of producing very large hail and tornadoes should
storms develop farther south along the dryline.

...Portions of the Southeast...
Scattered strong storms should develop along the baroclinic boundary
across the Southeast by afternoon peak heating tomorrow (Sunday).
Rich low-level moisture beneath modest mid-level lapse rates will
support over 2000 J/kg SBCAPE, with strong flow aloft also
contributing to elongated, mainly straight hodographs. Stronger
storms that develop in this environment will be capable of large
hail and gusty winds.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1157 AM CDT Sat May 17 2025

Valid 171700Z - 181200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHERN NEW MEXICO...

Increasing mid-level flow ahead of a deepening trough entering the
western U.S. is expected across the Four Corners region today. The
accelerating flow aloft atop a dry boundary layer, at least modest
daytime mixing and emerging dry fuels will support a period of
elevated fire weather conditions across portions of southeast Utah
and far southwest Colorado. Stronger southwest surface winds in
conjunction with single digit relative humidity, still supports
Critical highlights across southern New Mexico. Residence time of
heightened fire weather threat across West Texas due to eastward
mixing/propagation of dry line should be limited to just a couple
hours this afternoon east of the Cap Rock. In addition, Southern
High Plains green up should be in full swing so trimmed far eastern
extent of Elevated Highlights into West Texas for today.

..Williams.. 05/17/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0104 AM CDT Sat May 17 2025/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level shortwave trough and associated speed maximum is
forecast to progress from Baja into the desert southwest during the
morning and afternoon. Deep boundary-layer mixing and lee
cyclogenesis over the southern High Plains will result in critical
conditions over much of southern New Mexico into portions of far
West Texas and far southeastern Arizona. 

...Southern New Mexico...
As the boundary-layer mixes and the surface cyclone over the
southern High Plains deepens, sustained surface winds of 20-25 MPH
coupled with 5-10% relative humidity and receptive fuels are
anticipated. Critical meteorological conditions are also expected in
portions of eastern New Mexico and West Texas, as well as parts of
Arizona along the Mogollon Rim. However, current fuels guidance
indicates fuels are at or below their typical seasonal values,
warranting only Elevated highlights at this time.

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms producing large to very large hail, damaging

...Central TX/Southern OK into the ArkLaTex Region...
Morning water vapor loop shows a well-defined shortwave trough over
southern AZ tracking northeastward.  Ahead of this system, southerly
low-level winds and steep lapse rates aloft have established a very
moist and extremely unstable air mass from southern OK into central
TX.  Dewpoints in the low/mid 70s and ample daytime heating will
yield afternoon MLCAPE values over 4000 J/kg.  As the upper system
and associated mid-level jet max approach the dryline, thunderstorms
are expected to rapidly develop by mid-afternoon.  Splitting
supercells capable of very large hail will be the main initial

...Northwest OK...
The plume of dense cirrus ahead of the AZ shortwave trough will move
east of northwest OK by late afternoon, allowing strong heating and
destabilization.  This combined with southeasterly low level winds
near a retreating warm front will provide a corridor of strong
instability and favorable low-level shear for supercell development.
 The coverage of storms in this area is uncertain and varied between
the morning CAM solutions.  However, the storms that form will pose
a risk of very large hail, damaging winds, and a tornado or two.  It
is also unclear how far east this threat may persist, with some

...NY/New England...
A progressive shortwave trough and associated mid-level jet is
tracking eastward across the Great Lakes region today.  Cooling
temperatures aloft and strong daytime heating will lead to pockets
of moderate CAPE and steep low/mid level lapse rates.  Storms are
beginning to form across NY and will move into a progressively more
favorable air mass for strong/severe convection (including a few
supercells) by mid-afternoon.  Locally damaging winds are the main
concern, but the strongest cells could also produce hail and perhaps
a tornado or two.  Refer to MCD #837 for further details.

Mesoscale Discussion 0836
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0636 AM CDT Sat May 17 2025

Areas affected...Upstate New York and northern Vermont

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 171136Z - 171400Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms will continue moving northeast this morning.
Additional thunderstorms will develop later this morning and
afternoon and a watch may eventually be needed.

DISCUSSION...As a strong mid-level low slowly moves east across the
Great Lakes today, multiple rounds of thunderstorms are anticipated
across upstate New York, Vermont, and New Hampshire. These storms
will be aided by increasing large-scale forcing from a number of
sources: increasing upper-level divergence, lobes of positive
vorticity advection, and the left exit region of a mid-level jet. 

As diurnal heating increases this morning, cold mid-level
temperatures will overspread the region. This, coupled with surface
dewpoints ranging from the mid 50Fs to mid 60Fs will result in a
largely unstable, uncapped environment, primed for thunderstorm
development in association with one of the myriad of large-scale
forcing mechanisms. 

One such mechanism is already producing thunderstorms across far
eastern portions of Lake Ontario. These thunderstorms should
continue to rapidly move northeast into northern Vermont this
morning. These thunderstorms will be capable of producing gusty
winds and small hail. 

The likelihood for a watch in the short-term is relatively low.
However, as instability increases, and more widespread forcing for
ascent moves into the area, a watch or watches may be needed across
portions of the area by midday into early afternoon.

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS NORTH
TEXAS AND SOUTHERN OKLAHOMA...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PORTIONS OF
UPSTATE NEW YORK AND WESTERN NEW ENGLAND...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms producing large to very large hail, damaging
gusts and a couple of tornadoes are expected across the southern
Plains. Additional severe storms are possible across the Northeast.

...Southern Plains Region...
Water vapor imagery depicts a pronounced southern stream upper-level
trough over the Baja Peninsula this morning, with evidence of a lead
impulse approaching southwest TX. This leading impulse will
contribute to ascent in the vicinity of a sharpening dryline across
Western North Texas/Oklahoma by early afternoon. To the east of the
dryline, extreme instability (MLCAPE in excess of 4000 J/kg) is
expected to develop given the moist low-level air mass and
relatively cool mid-level thermal profiles. With negligible CINH by
early/mid afternoon, thunderstorms are expected to develop along the
dryline and move east/northeast into North Texas and southern
Oklahoma. Supercells will be the dominant mode initially, with a
risk for very large hail (in excess of 3.5 inches), and damaging
gusts. Although low-level shear is not especially strong, some
tornado risk will exist given the magnitude of instability and
potential for storm-scale interactions. Eventual upscale growth into
a severe MCS is expected as storms continue to move across North
TX/southern OK this evening. Severe wind probabilities have been
increased across the Enhanced Risk area for the expectation of a
more concentrated corridor of damaging wind potential.

Across central/northwest OK, a narrowing plume of instability will
be present east of the dryline and south of an east-west oriented
frontal boundary.  Within this moist sector, strong to extreme
instability and around 50 kts of deep-layer shear will support at
least isolated supercell storm development this afternoon over
central OK. Very large hail (3 inches or greater) will be possible,
in addition to damaging gusts. Tornado risk will be dependent on
storm interactions. Thunderstorm development over northwest OK is
more uncertain, however should a storm develop a supercell mode will
be favored with all hazards possible. 

...Northeast...
Strong mid-level height falls will spread across much of the
northeastern U.S. today in response to the approaching Great Lakes
upper low. Large-scale ascent will increase with as the left-exit
region of the 500mb jet translates across PA. Scattered
thunderstorms, including supercells, are expected to develop
along/ahead of the synoptic cold front across upstate NY, with
subsequent movement expected into western New England. Multiple
rounds of thunderstorms are likely, with severe hail and winds as
the primary risks. A tornado or two cannot be ruled out with any
stronger and semi-discrete supercell. Please refer to Mesoscale
Discussion 836 for additional details on short-term expectations.

...Northern Utah Vicinity...
A Marginal Risk has been introduced across northern UT and vicinity
given expected higher concentration of storms within a deeply-mixed
boundary layer. Strong/severe gusts will be the primary severe risk.

...Lower Mississippi Valley/Southeast...
Thunderstorms continue from central MS into the western Carolinas at
13z, with occasional pulses of strong/severe cells. Isolated
stronger storms will remain possible as diurnal
heating/destabilization takes place in the presence of ample shear
for organized storms. However, with the line of convection oriented
generally parallel to the shear vector, any severe risk should be
isolated. Strong gusts will be the primary hazard.

Mesoscale Discussion 0820
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0314 PM CDT Fri May 16 2025

Areas affected...western/central PA to northern VA

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 263...

Valid 162014Z - 162215Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 263
continues.

SUMMARY...A mix of damaging winds and severe hail remains possible
through early evening from western to central Pennsylvania southward
into northern Virginia. A corridor of greater damaging wind
potential is apparent in central Maryland, the District of Columbia,
and far northern Virginia.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorm coverage has steadily increased ahead of a
minor MCV, and separately along a wavy outflow boundary. Measured
strong to severe wind gusts have occurred along the outflow
associated with the MCV. Very strong mid-level winds persist in the
wake of this MCV, as sampled by recent RLX VWP data. With surface
temperatures in the mid to upper 80s ahead of this outflow, yielding
peak MLCAPE of 2000-2500 J/kg, damaging wind swaths are most
probable into central MD to far northern VA. Farther north,
convection has largely struggled, outside of a slow-moving supercell
along the separate outflow boundary in south-central PA. Mixed
severe hail and damaging wind will remain possible here, amid weak
low-level shear/SRH.

Mesoscale Discussion 0819
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0310 PM CDT Fri May 16 2025

Areas affected...much of northeast Texas into much of southern
Arkansas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 162010Z - 162215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered severe storms appear likely later this
afternoon, with large hail and locally damaging gusts the most
likely threats.

DISCUSSION...The primary surface front currently extends from near
Ft. Smith AR southwestward into parts of North Texas, with very
strong instability in place. A special 19Z FWD sounding shows MLCAPE
of 3250 J/kg, along with 0-6 km shear around 55 kt. 

Weak convergence along the front and continued heating should result
in sporadic storm development along this boundary, and the
environment will supercells producing very large hail. Visible
imagery shows towering CU along portions of the front, and
initiation appears likely in the next couple hours.

Mesoscale Discussion 0818
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0230 PM CDT Fri May 16 2025

Areas affected...northeast WI into central Upper MI

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 161930Z - 162130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated severe gusts with small to marginally severe hail
will be possible into early evening with high-based thunderstorms
advancing north-northeast from northeast Wisconsin into central
Upper Michigan.

DISCUSSION...Scattered high-based thunderstorms have developed
downstream of the vertically stacked cyclone over northern MN.
Despite surface dew points only in the 40s to low 50s, storm
development has been sustained where temperatures warmed into the
low to mid 80s. This has yielded a deep inverted-v thermodynamic
profile. Shear within the buoyancy layer appears weak, but the steep
lapse rates through the troposphere will foster small to marginally
severe hail cores. This should enhance downdrafts and could support
strong to severe microbursts as convection spreads northeast through
the rest of the afternoon.

Mesoscale Discussion 0817
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0208 PM CDT Fri May 16 2025

Areas affected...northern Arkansas...eastern Missouri...southern
Illinois...far western Kentucky

Concerning...Tornado Watch 262...

Valid 161908Z - 162115Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 262 continues.

SUMMARY...A threat of very large hail and occasional tornadoes
persists across the watch area, and will eventually spread east into
southern Illinois and western Kentucky. Another watch will likely be
needed soon.

DISCUSSION...A rash of supercells is moving rapidly from
south-central into eastern MO, with isolated cells extending into
northern AR. These storms are ahead of a cold front/dryline where
low-level winds are veering to westerly. Meanwhile, the warm front
is now close to St. Louis, with southerly winds bringing 68+
dewpoints northward into the area.

The combination of cool midlevel temperatures and the ample boundary
layer moisture is resulting in MLCAPE values approaching 4000 J/kg.
This, in combination with effective deep-layer shear over 60 kt, is
providing an extremely favorable environment for very large hail of
3-4" diameter. 

In addition, 0-1 SRH remains in the 150-200 m2/s2 range, which is
sufficient for a tornado risk. In the near term, the greatest
tornado risk is over southeast MO, and will eventually shift into
far southern IL and western KY.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 263
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
220 PM EDT Fri May 16 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  District Of Columbia
  Western and Central Maryland
  Southwest and South-Central Pennsylvania
  Northern Virginia
  Far Northern West Virginia Panhandle
  Coastal Waters

* Effective this Friday afternoon and evening from 220 PM until
  1000 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm coverage is expected to increase across the
region this afternoon. Environmental conditions support strong to
severe storms capable of damaging gust and large hail.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 60
statute miles north and south of a line from 30 miles west northwest
of Wheeling WV to 10 miles east southeast of Baltimore MD. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU3).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 262
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1155 AM CDT Fri May 16 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Northern Arkansas
  Southwestern Illinois
  Central and Eastern Missouri
  Far Eastern Oklahoma

* Effective this Friday morning and evening from 1155 AM until
  700 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A few tornadoes likely with a couple intense tornadoes possible
  Widespread large hail and scattered very large hail events to 4
    inches in diameter likely
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely

SUMMARY...The airmass across the region continues to destabilize
amid strong low-level moisture advection and daytime heating. Robust
thunderstorm development is anticipated over the next few hours as
an approaching cold front interacts with this strong buoyant
airmass. Strong vertical shear is also in place, supporting
supercells as the primary storm mode. All severe hazards are
possible with these supercells, including very large hail up to 4"
in diameter and strong tornadoes.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 80 statute miles
east and west of a line from 70 miles south of Harrison AR to 35
miles north northwest of Saint Louis MO. For a complete depiction of
the watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS
WOU2).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0309 PM CDT Fri May 16 2025

Valid 181200Z - 241200Z

Critical fire weather conditions are expected to linger over the
weekend and into early next week across parts of the southern High
Plains. Long-range guidance continues to depict the amplification of
an upper trough over the Southwest this weekend before ejecting into
the Plains early next week. As this occurs, dry southwesterly flow
should overspread much of the Southwest/southern High Plains, which
will promote multiple days of fire weather concerns. After the
ejection of this wave, ensemble guidance suggests low-amplitude
long-wave ridging will become established over the central CONUS.
This should promote muted surface pressure gradient winds along with
isolated rain chances for most regions with the exception of the
Great Basin and Southwest. 

...D3/Sunday and D4/Monday - Southern High Plains...
Southwesterly flow over the southern/central Rockies will promote
lee troughing along the southern High Plains through early next
week. To the west of a sharpening dryline, west/southwesterly
downslope flow will promote multiple days of dry/windy conditions
with afternoon RH values expected to fall into the single digits to
low teens with 15-25 mph winds. Widespread elevated to critical fire
weather conditions are expected both afternoons as mid-level
impulses propagate into the Plains and result in an eastward surge
of the dryline. The fire weather threat should be greatest across
south-central NM into far West TX where ERCs are currently between
the 80th to 95th percentile. With northward and eastward extent,
ongoing spring green up should modulate the potential for fire
spread. 

...D3/Sunday and D4/Monday - Sacramento Valley...
Dry northerly winds are expected through the Sacramento Valley both
D3/Sun and D4/Mon. Latest deterministic and ensemble guidance
suggests winds between 15-20 mph are likely with RH values falling
into the 20-30% range. Elevated fire weather conditions are
possible, and some fire threat may materialize given ERCs increasing
to near the 80th percentile. However, confidence in
sustained/widespread critical conditions remains too limited for
highlights at this time.

Mesoscale Discussion 0807
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0740 AM CDT Fri May 16 2025

Areas affected...northeast AR into central KY

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 259...

Valid 161240Z - 161445Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 259
continues.

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm cluster may continue to pose a risk for hail
and sporadic strong gusts this morning. Local watch extension may be
needed for portions of Severe Thunderstorm Watch 259.

DISCUSSION...Strong to severe thunderstorms continue from northeast
AR into central KY this morning. While previously a new watch was
considered, given some weakening in the clusters across central KY,
local watch extensions may be more appropriate as uncertainty in
downstream evolution has increased. Nevertheless, a favorable
environment will persist, supporting a continued large hail risk in
the short term. If further upscale growth occurs with ongoing
clusters, a risk for damaging gust potential could increase later
this morning or toward midday downstream from WW 259. Local watch
extensions for 1-2 hours may be need if current trends persist for
another 30-60 minutes.

Mesoscale Discussion 0806
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0635 AM CDT Fri May 16 2025

Areas affected...northeast AR/southeast MO into parts of KY/TN...WV
and western VA

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 259...

Valid 161135Z - 161330Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 259
continues.

SUMMARY...Severe thunderstorms posing a risk for large to very large
hail will persist across Severe Thunderstorm Watch 259. This
activity may maintain severity downstream into eastern Kentucky and
portions of West Virginia and western Virginia. A new watch may be
needed to replace WW 259 and to expand downstream.

DISCUSSION...Scattered severe thunderstorm clusters are ongoing this
morning from northeast AR into central KY. This activity is
occurring in a warm advection regime and on the fringes of an 850 mb
southwesterly low-level jet. While some inhibition is present in the
low-levels given the nocturnally cooled boundary layer, MUCAPE from
1000-2000 J/kg is in place amid a moist airmass. Elongated/straight
supercell profiles and cool temperatures aloft also are present.
Thus, a large hail threat will accompany any more discrete
convection. 

Recent radar trends suggest clustering may be underway near the MO
Bootheel and into western KY. If this continues, convection could
develop into a small MCS and move across KY toward WV/VA, posing a
risk for strong/severe wind gusts as well as the downstream airmass
destabilizes and inhibition erodes later this morning as diurnal
heating ensues. 

An isolated cell also is approaching the edge of WW 259 across
central KY and a downstream watch and/or larger watch replacement
may be needed soon.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 259
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
225 AM CDT Fri May 16 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  North-central and Northeast Arkansas
  Southern Illinois
  Southwest Indiana
  Western Kentucky
  Southeast Missouri
  Northwest Tennessee

* Effective this Friday morning from 225 AM until 900 AM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
    inches in diameter likely
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Scattered severe thunderstorms are expected to develop and
move rapidly northeast across the watch area early this morning.
Large hail and damaging thunderstorm gusts will be the primary
severe weather hazard, although a tornado or two will also be
possible.Scattered severe thunderstorms are expected to develop and

move rapidly northeast across the watch area early this morning.
Large hail and damaging thunderstorm gusts will be the primary
severe weather hazard, although a tornado or two will also be
possible.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 60
statute miles north and south of a line from 30 miles south
southwest of Flippin AR to 20 miles north northeast of Bowling Green

KY. For a complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch
outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU9).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to

2 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 550. Mean storm motion vector
24045.

Areas affected...Parts of central and northern Illinois

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 152022Z - 152215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Large to very large hail and severe winds will be possible
with supercells that can develop later this afternoon. Watch timing
is uncertain but is possible later this afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Cumulus are developing along an eastward moving dryline
near the Mississippi River. Ahead of this boundary, a strongly
unstable airmass is in place (low 90s F temperatures and mid 60s to
low 70s F dewpoints). With the strongest mid-level ascent to the
northwest of the region, timing of storm initiation as well as storm
coverage are uncertain. However, given the lack of MLCIN, a isolated
to widely scattered development appears possible later this
afternoon. 45-55 kts of effective shear will support supercells. The
primary hazards will be large to very large hail and severe winds.
The tornado threat is expected to be less than farther north given
the slightly veered low-level winds and more sizable
temperature/dewpoint spreads at the surface.

Areas affected...portions of central Arkansas into western
Tennessee...far southeast Missouri...far southwestern Kentucky

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 252...

Valid 152007Z - 152130Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 252
continues.

SUMMARY...Ongoing storms may still reach severe limits, with
damaging gusts and large hail the main concerns. These storms may
persist downstream of Severe Thunderstorm Watch 252, so a local
extension of the ongoing watch, or the issuance of a new downstream
Severe Thunderstorm Watch, may be needed.

DISCUSSION...Strong thunderstorms (still possibly elevated) continue
across AR amid a pronounced EML atop rich low-level moisture and
strong deep-layer shear. As such, any storm cores that can intensify
will continue to pose at least a severe hail threat. Severe gusts
are also possible if ongoing storms can become surface based by
either rooting into the boundary layer, or establishing a strong
cold pool, which could lift surface-based parcels to the LFC along
the cold pool leading edge. It remains uncertain if these storms
have peaked in intensity or if greater severe potential exists
downstream. As such, an eastward extension of the ongoing Severe
Thunderstorm Watch, or the issuance of a new watch, may be needed
pending favorable convective trends.

Areas affected...Portions of northwest Wisconsin

Concerning...Tornado Watch 251...

Valid 152000Z - 152130Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 251 continues.

SUMMARY...Tornado potential, including a strong tornado, will shift
into portions of northwest Wisconsin over the next 1-2 hours.

DISCUSSION...A broken line of supercells continues north and east.
These storms will move across the River and into northwest Wisconsin
shortly. Temperatures have risen into low 80s F with dewpoints
remaining near 64 F. Given the storm mode, low-level thermodynamics,
and backed surface winds, this area will be the primary focus for
tornado potential over the next 1-2 hours. Storms have remained in
close proximity to one another, but still sufficiently discrete that
overall inflow quality remains favorable for low-level mesocyclone
intensification. With objective mesoanalysis showing STP of 2-3, a
strong tornado remains possible.

Mesoscale Discussion 0791
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0214 PM CDT Thu May 15 2025

Areas affected...Parts of southern Wisconsin into northern Illinois

Concerning...Severe potential...Tornado Watch likely 

Valid 151914Z - 152115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...A tornado watch will likely be needed this afternoon.
Supercells capable of all severe hazards are expected within the
next few hours.

DISCUSSION...Cumulus continue to deepen both along a dryline and an
area of confluence within the Mississippi Valley. Whether storms
develop within the confluence or when the dryline reaches the
Mississippi River remains a question. 40-50 kts of effective shear
across these surface convergence zones will favor supercells as
storms develop. Large to very large hail will be a concern as well
as severe wind gusts. The 18Z DVN sounding sampled very steep
mid-level lapse rates and a long hodograph. Tornado potential will
also be present. Surface temperature/dewpoint spreads are near 20 F,
but low-level shear and a supercellular mode will favor low-level
rotation. The time frame of greater tornado potential will likely be
22-00Z when the low-level jet increases in southern Wisconsin.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 251
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1245 PM CDT Thu May 15 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Central Minnesota
  West-Central Wisconsin

* Effective this Thursday afternoon and evening from 1245 PM
  until 800 PM CDT.

Mesoscale Discussion 0785
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0723 AM CDT Thu May 15 2025

Areas affected...Southeast SD...southern MN...extreme northeast
NE/northwest IA

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 151223Z - 151400Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A threat for strong to isolated severe storms may continue
through the morning.

DISCUSSION...A long-lived storm cluster is ongoing this morning
across south-central MN. This system has persisted longer than most
guidance would suggest, and is likely being aided by persistent
moisture transport associated with a strong low-level jet. While
this system remains relatively disorganized with outflow tending to
outpace the deeper convection, localized strong wind gusts and hail
will be possible, especially where new updrafts develop and briefly
intensify behind the outflow. 

To the southwest, renewed storm development is underway across
southeast SD and far northeast NE, immediately in advance of a
compact but vigorous midlevel shortwave trough moving across
north-central NE/south-central SD. Rather strong low-level
southeasterly flow will maintain moisture transport into the region
through the morning ahead of a cold front, and development of
somewhat more organized convection will be possible with time. In
the short term, convection will tend to be somewhat elevated, but
could become rooted closer to the surface later this morning,
especially with southeast extent. Some hail and strong-gust
potential could evolve if convection is able to deepen and intensify
within this regime.  

With the threat expected to remain rather isolated over the next 1-2
hours, short-term watch issuance is considered unlikely. Trends will
continue to be monitored for intensification with time this morning.

Mesoscale Discussion 0778
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0307 PM CDT Wed May 14 2025

Areas affected...Southwest into central Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 142007Z - 142200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Large/very-large hail and severe winds will be the primary
threats as storms develop and mature this afternoon and evening.
Supercells on the southern end of the activity may have slightly
higher associated tornado threat. A watch is likely late this
afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Dewpoints have held in the low 60s F in central
Nebraska this afternoon. Cumulus towers and recent lightning have
been observed in Cherry County in the last hour along a surface
boundary. Water vapor imagery shows ascent increasing in Colorado as
a shortwave trough continues to pivot northeastward. This ascent
should reach western/southwestern Nebraska later this afternoon. In
the near term, additional storms appear probable as
heating/convergence continue along the boundary. The eastern
boundary is the most likely zone for initiation, though additional
storms could form on the weaker boundary to the west. With
deep-layer shear having a more westerly component this far south,
which should be maintained/modestly increase as the trough ejects
this evening, a mixed mode of linear segments and supercells can be
expected. Supercells will be favored with southern extent.

Modestly steep mid-level lapse rates and increasing shear by the
evening will support organized storms capable of large/very-large
hail (particularly supercells) and severe winds. While the low-level
jet response this evening is not expected to be overly strong, a
supercell along the southern flank of the activity may have slightly
higher tornado potential.

A watch is likely by late afternoon. Timing of watch issuance is
somewhat uncertain given greater storm coverage may wait until
greater mid-level ascent arrives by 22-00Z.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 247
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
350 PM CDT Wed May 14 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Western and Central Nebraska
  South-Central and Central South Dakota

* Effective this Wednesday afternoon and evening from 350 PM
  until 1100 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 75
    mph possible
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 3
    inches in diameter possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms should continue to gradually increase in
coverage and intensity this afternoon and evening. Supercells should
pose a threat for large to very large hail potentially up to 2-3
inches in diameter, especially across parts of western into central
Nebraska. Otherwise, scattered severe wind gusts may occur with any
clusters that eventually form. A tornado or two also appears
possible, mainly this evening.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 45
statute miles east and west of a line from 35 miles north of Pierre
SD to 25 miles east southeast of Imperial NE. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU7).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
3 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 65 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
20030.

Mesoscale Discussion 0774
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0746 AM CDT Tue May 13 2025

Areas affected...Parts of eastern NC into southeast VA

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 131246Z - 131445Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A localized brief-tornado and wind-damage threat may
persist through the morning.

DISCUSSION...Extensive convection is ongoing this morning across
eastern NC into southeast VA. Weak instability (MLCAPE generally 500
J/kg or less) is limiting updraft intensity, with lightning
primarily confined to somewhat deeper convection near the NC coast.
However, to the east of the slow-moving midlevel cyclone centered
over western TN/KY, rather strong low-level flow continues to be
noted on the KMHX and KAKQ VWPs, supporting effective SRH of 150-200
m2/s2. Small cells with occasional rotation have persisted from
northeast NC into far southeast VA, and some localized threat for a
brief tornado and wind damage could persist through the morning with
these smaller cells. 

Farther south, an extensive convective cluster is ongoing off the NC
coast, with some evidence of an MCV south of Morehead City. This
cluster could spread northward toward the immediate coast and Outer
Banks with time, with embedded cells potentially posing a threat of
strong gusts and a brief tornado, especially where surface dewpoints
remain near 70 F this morning.

Mesoscale Discussion 0765
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0139 PM CDT Sun May 11 2025

Areas affected...eastern Idaho into western Wyoming and southwest
Montana

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 111839Z - 112115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Storms should gradually increase in coverage and intensity
from eastern Idaho into southwest Montana, with both hail and gust
potential.

DISCUSSION...A line of convection continue to increase in intensity
over the upper Snake River Plain, with both strong heating and
low-level warm advection ahead of it. Continued steepening of
deep-layer lapse rates as the upper trough moves in the from the
west and more heating should support further strengthening of this
convection. Strong deep-layer shear will favor hail production with
these storms over eastern ID. A brief/weak tornado cannot be ruled
out with the stronger cells this afternoon, as low-level stretching
is maximized.

Farther north toward the Bitterroots, stronger cooling aloft is
occurring, and areas of heating persist ahead of this activity as
well. Long hodographs and cold midlevel temperatures will favor hail
with these storms through the day.

Mesoscale Discussion 0767
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0221 PM CDT Sun May 11 2025

Areas affected...central Florida northward toward southeast Georgia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 111921Z - 112145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Storms are forecast to increase in coverage throughout the
afternoon from the central Florida Peninsula into northeast Florida
and southeast Georgia.

DISCUSSION...Storms are currently increasing east of Tampa to west
of Okeechobee where strong heating has led to strong instability.
The southerly flow regime should support a north/northeast movement
to this development, affecting the remainder of central into
northeastern Florida. Breaks in the clouds in those downstream areas
are developing, and this should further increase instability.
Although temperatures aloft are not as cool as previous days, MUCAPE
over 2000 J/kg and deep-layer shear of 35-40 kt will support
cellular storm mode with sporadic hail > 1.00" expected. Locally
strong to damaging gusts cannot be ruled out as well, especially
with any merging outflows.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 245
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
110 PM MDT Sun May 11 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Eastern Idaho
  Northern Utah
  Western Wyoming

* Effective this Sunday afternoon and evening from 110 PM until
  800 PM MDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 80
    mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm intensity and coverage is expected to
increase this afternoon across eastern ID, northern UT, and western
WY. Environmental conditions support the potential for strong to
severe storms capable of strong gusts. Isolated large hail is also
possible, particularly in areas of higher terrain.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 80
statute miles east and west of a line from 65 miles north northeast
of Idaho Falls ID to 40 miles southwest of Salt Lake City UT. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU5).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 70 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
23035.

Mesoscale Discussion 0766
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0149 PM CDT Sun May 11 2025

Areas affected...Portions of southeast Georgia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 111849Z - 112045Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A locally greater risk for damaging winds and perhaps a
tornado is evident in southeast Georgia near a local warm front
feature.

DISCUSSION...A small corridor in southeast Georgia has heated into
the low 80s F. A few weak discrete cells exist near the
Georgia/South Carolina state line. One cell has recently intensified
and shown signs of low-level rotation. The localized warm front
feature will promote at least marginal potential for a brief tornado
with southeasterly winds near the boundary. Nearby KCLX radar
accordingly shows modest 0-1 km SRH. Over the next hour or two this
environment will support a locally greater risk for damaging winds
and perhaps a tornado. The discrete cells will have the greatest
potential, but stronger updrafts within the linear segment farther
southwest could also acquire low-level rotation as well.

Mesoscale Discussion 0764
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0130 PM CDT Sun May 11 2025

Areas affected...Salt Lake Vicinity

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 111830Z - 112030Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Severe wind gusts will be possible this afternoon with
high-based showers and embedded thunderstorms.

DISCUSSION...With temperatures rising into the low/mid 80s F in the
vicinity of Salt Lake, high-based showers and isolated thunderstorms
have deepened over the last hour. A few of these storms have
produced 58-63 mph measured gusts in Tooele/Salt Lake Counties.
While low-level wind fields are not overly strong, the 9.2 C/km
700-500 mb lapse rate observed in this mornings 12Z SLC sounding,
coupled with steep low-level lapse rates and high surface dewpoint
depressions, will continue to support strong diabatically driven
downdrafts. Severe wind gusts will remain possible through the
afternoon in association with this weak, disorganized convection.
