Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0750 AM CDT Tue May 13 2025

Valid 131300Z - 141200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS
OF THE MID-ATLANTIC...NORTHERN GREAT PLAINS...AND DEEP SOUTH...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms are possible: 1) today in vicinity of
Virginia-North Carolina-West Virginia, 2) during the late afternoon
to mid-evening over a portion of the Deep South, and 3) this evening
into early morning Wednesday in parts of the northern Great Plains.

...NC/VA/WV vicinity...
The upper-level low centered near the mid-Mississippi Valley will
continue to lift east/northeast through tonight, as a notable
shortwave trough rotates northeast across the Mid-Atlantic region.
Generally weak surface-based instability (MLCAPE at or below 1000
J/kg) will exist across the coastal plain as a belt of stronger 850
mb flow lifts northeast across eastern sections of NC/VA. This will
contribute to enlarged low-level hodograph structures and support
the continued potential for transient areas of rotation and a few
short-lived tornadoes associated with stronger convective elements. 
See recently issued Mesoscale Discussion 774 for details on
short-term convective trends.

Farther west into WV/western VA and NC, subtle large-scale forcing
for ascent with the approaching upper low will contribute to
thunderstorm development. Although deep-layer shear will tend to
relax with westward extent, slightly more favorable mid-level lapse
rates and 1000-locally 1500 J/kg MLCAPE will result in the potential
for isolated strong/severe gusts and hail.  

...AL/MS/TN vicinity...
Some hi-res guidance continues to suggest a supercell or two may
develop to the west of the departing mid-level trough, where a
corridor of differential boundary-layer heating may support a
favored zone for late afternoon through mid-evening storm
development. Some veering of the wind profile should yield modest
hodograph curvature. This, coupled with moderate mid-level
west-northwesterly flow, will favor a conditional supercell threat.

...Northern Great Plains...
An upstream upper-level trough over the western U.S. will move
steadily east, resulting in strengthening southerly mid-level flow
across the northern Plains. A Pacific cold front will make modest
eastward progress today before becoming quasi-stationary across the
western/central Dakotas, however the stronger mid-level flow will
remain generally displaced to the west. Weak elevated buoyancy and
sufficient deep-layer shear may still result in scattered storms,
including supercells, with potential for severe hail. Some risk for
strong/severe gusts may also exist with storms closer to the surface
front.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0746 AM CDT Tue May 13 2025

Areas affected...Parts of eastern NC into southeast VA

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 131246Z - 131445Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A localized brief-tornado and wind-damage threat may
persist through the morning.

DISCUSSION...Extensive convection is ongoing this morning across
eastern NC into southeast VA. Weak instability (MLCAPE generally 500
J/kg or less) is limiting updraft intensity, with lightning
primarily confined to somewhat deeper convection near the NC coast.
However, to the east of the slow-moving midlevel cyclone centered
over western TN/KY, rather strong low-level flow continues to be
noted on the KMHX and KAKQ VWPs, supporting effective SRH of 150-200
m2/s2. Small cells with occasional rotation have persisted from
northeast NC into far southeast VA, and some localized threat for a
brief tornado and wind damage could persist through the morning with
these smaller cells. 

Farther south, an extensive convective cluster is ongoing off the NC
coast, with some evidence of an MCV south of Morehead City. This
cluster could spread northward toward the immediate coast and Outer
Banks with time, with embedded cells potentially posing a threat of
strong gusts and a brief tornado, especially where surface dewpoints
remain near 70 F this morning.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0358 AM CDT Tue May 13 2025

Valid 161200Z - 211200Z

...DISCUSSION...
An active period of severe weather is anticipated through early next
week as a pair of upper-level troughs traverse the U.S. and will be
favorably timed to allow moisture recovery into central/southern
portions of the CONUS. The upper trough currently over the Pacific
Northwest is forecast to migrate into the Great Lakes region by this
weekend. In the wake of this feature, a second long-wave trough will
begin to deepen across the West before migrating into the Plains by
early/mid next week with attendant chances for strong/severe
thunderstorms. 

...D4/Friday...
A stalled boundary will likely be draped from the Ozarks into the OH
Valley at the beginning of the forecast period. A weak,
low-amplitude mid-level perturbation emanating out of the central
Plains will promote secondary surface low development across the
southern Plains that will maintain southerly low-level flow. As
such, some northward migration of the boundary as an effective warm
front appears probable. Thunderstorm development along the boundary
is anticipated by late afternoon, and 40-50 knot mid-level flow
oriented along the frontal zone should promote initially
discrete/semi-discrete cells with the potential for upscale growth
into one or more organized clusters. Some disagreement in exactly
where the corridor of highest severe threat will become established
persists and is associated with the coverage and intensity of
ongoing convection Friday morning. Recent GFS/GEFS runs hint that
more isolated convection early Friday will allow for more aggressive
northward advancement of the front, while ECMWF solutions hint at
slower northward progression  of the boundary. The 15% risk area has
been expanded to best encompass the overlap between these two
dichotomous solutions.

...D6/Sunday to D8/Tuesday...
A deepening upper level trough over the western states will promote
several days of lee troughing/cyclogenesis across the southern to
central High Plains beginning this weekend. This will allow for more
seasonal moisture return into the Plains with most ensemble members
showing dewpoints climbing into the low to mid 60s by D6/Sunday
afternoon across TX, OK, and southern KS. Deterministic solutions
continue to vary regarding the exact timing and evolution of the
upper-level wave (and any embedded impulses), but the general
consensus is that severe thunderstorms will be possible as
upper-level disturbances overspread the Plains and promote eastward
mixing of the dryline into an increasingly buoyant warm sector.
Confidence on any particular day remains too limited for risk
probabilities, but the overall synoptic regime and convective QPF
signals in ensemble guidance suggest that the potential for multiple
rounds of severe thunderstorms is increasing for the
southern/central Plains beginning D6/Sunday through D8/Tuesday.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHWEST....

...Synopsis...
The upper trough over the western US will continue to intensify as
it emerges over the Rockies and onto the Plains Wednesday. Strong
mid-level flow will strengthen a lee cyclone with a trailing cold
front and dryline across the Great Plains. Dry westerly flow is
likely over the Southwest where critical fire-weather conditions are
expected. A more conditional threat for locally elevated
fire-weather conditions exist over the Plains and Midwest ahead of
the cold front.

...Southwest...
As the main upper trough begins to move eastward over the Plains,
the fire weather threat will persist for portions of Southwest. 
Moderate mid-level flow at the base of the upper-trough will support
westerly downslope winds to 20-25 mph across southern New Mexico and
eastern AZ Wednesday afternoon and evening. Amidst a very dry
surface pattern with little recent rainfall and abnormally warm
temperatures, RH values below 15% are likely. With sufficient fuels
in place, and expanding in coverage from recent drying, widespread
critical fire-weather conditions are likely Wednesday.

...Central plains and upper Midwest...
As the upper trough moves eastward, a lee trough/dryline will
gradually sharpen across the central CONUS. To the west, dry
downslope flow is possible over parts of the central/northern Plains
into the Upper Midwest. With RH minimums below 30% and wind gusting
to 20 mph, some elevated fire-weather threat may be possible across
parts of CO/KS and NE into the Dakotas. However, the strongest
meteorological conditions are not expected to overlap with areas of
supportive fuels given rainfall over the past week. Increasing
surface moisture and some precipitation potential with the advancing
cold front may further limit any appreciable overlap. This will
favor a more localized threat with only isolated elevated
fire-weather conditions expected.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS EASTERN
MONTANA AND NORTHWEST NORTH DAKOTA...PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHEAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms are possible across parts of the
Southeast today, where a tornado or two, localized damaging winds,
and hail could occur. Isolated severe wind gusts are also possible
in northeast Montana to northwest North Dakota around early evening.

...20Z Update...
Minor adjustments were made in the Southeast based on observed
convective trends. Greater buoyancy has developed in southeast to
east-central Georgia. This zone could have locally higher potential
for strong to severe storms. However, mid-level dry air is evident
on water vapor imagery. Updrafts may tend to struggle to intensify
due to dry air entrainment. Elsewhere, the forecast remains
unchanged.

..Wendt.. 05/12/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1130 AM CDT Mon May 12 2025/

...Southeast...
Vertically stacked cyclone persists over the Mid-South this morning.
Expectation is for this system to become more progressive today,
ejecting into western TN by early tomorrow morning. A moist airmass
remains in place downstream of this cyclone across the Southeast,
and numerous showers and thunderstorms are currently ongoing within
the warm conveyor of this system from FL into GA and the Carolina.
Moderate southwesterly/southerly will persist within this warm
sector, and effective shear should be sufficient for multicell
clusters and transient updraft rotation. However, only modest
destabilization is anticipated across much of the region, limiting
the overall severe potential. Expectation is for occasionally strong
storms in areas of sufficient destabilization, with damaging
downbursts and hail as the primary risk. A corridor of greater
severe potential could be developing across southern GA and northern
FL where some heating is occurring.

...Northeast Montana/northwest North Dakota...
Deep shortwave trough will continue to push eastward across the
Pacific Northwest today, with associated southwesterly flow aloft
extending from northern CA into the northern High Plains. Deeply
mixed thermodynamic profiles are expected across the region as the
airmass destabilizes this afternoon. Isolated thunderstorms are most
probable from mid-afternoon into evening with development
near/behind an eastward-advancing front. Convective coverage off the
higher terrain of southern Montana should be less than in recent
days. However, the potential will still exist for a few dry
microbursts producing localized severe-caliber wind gusts as the
storms move off the terrain into more of eastern MT.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER CENTRAL AND
EASTERN PARTS OF THE DAKOTAS AND NEBRASKA...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong to severe thunderstorms are possible mainly over
parts of the Dakotas and Nebraska Wednesday afternoon and evening.

...Synopsis...
On Wednesday, a potent shortwave trough will move from the Four
Corners region into the central Plains, with a 70+ kt midlevel speed
max over KS by 12Z Thursday. The primary upper low will deepen over
eastern MT, with most of the cooling aloft north of a line from
northern NM into eastern NE. Ahead of this system, heights will rise
over the MS Valley and Southeast, while the lingering upper trough
over the East dissipates further.

At the surface, a trough will stretch roughly from the central
Dakotas into KS at 00Z, with a surface low taking shape and
deepening overnight into eastern NE and IA. Modest moisture return
will occur ahead of the surface trough, with 50s to near 60 F
dewpoints to the Dakotas portion of the boundary. A more robust
plume of moisture with mid 60s F dewpoints is likely from the lower
MO to middle MS Valleys.

Overnight, winds around 850 mb will strengthen as the low develops,
but will also veer from southwest through northwest, resulting in
advection of drier air.

...Northern and central Plains...
Northern portions of the upper trough will emerge into the northern
Plains in meridional fashion through early evening, with the primary
speed max well to the south until early Thursday. Gradual cooling
aloft will overspread the surface trough and wind shift, where
strong heating will occur. The result will be moderate instability,
with scattered storms erupting within the north-south zone from the
Dakotas into NE. 

Coincident with the storm development, a cold frontal surge will
occur over the northern High Plains, which should help push this
activity perhaps into western MN and IA by 12Z Thursday. Shear
profiles will not be particularly strong initially, but may become
increasingly favorable overnight to support corridors of severe wind
and hail.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE NORTHERN PLAINS AND UPPER
MIDWEST...

...Northern Plains and Midwest...
An approaching upper-level trough and advancing cold front will
support shower and thunderstorm development across northeastern
Montana late this afternoon into the evening hours. Forward  motion
of precipitation cores will limit rainfall to likely less than one
tenth of an inch. However, a cooler air mass and higher humidity
will infiltrate into eastern Montana tonight, with additional
widespread rainfall expected Tuesday across the area. Before
convection commences late this afternoon, a well-mixed boundary
layer and dry downslope flow ahead of the upper-trough should
support a few hours of elevated fire weather conditions across the
area, necessitating and westward expansion of Elevated highlights.

...Southwest...
Latest fuels guidance indicates increased fire spread potential
across portions of eastern Arizona and western New Mexico. With a
broad area of stronger winds and dry conditions across the region,
expanded Elevated highlights northward to encompass drier fuels
along the Arizona and New Mexico border.

..Williams.. 05/12/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0152 AM CDT Mon May 12 2025/

...Synopsis...
As the blocking within the upper-air pattern begins to breakdown a
trough will deepens over the western US. Strong mid-level flow will
gradually move into the Plains, as upper ridging moves eastward.
Strong lee troughing/cyclogenesis will support gusty south/westerly
winds over the High Plains. Fire-weather conditions are expected
across the Northern Great Plains and Southwest this afternoon and
evening.

...Northern Plains and Midwest...
Another day of strong southerly winds are likely across the northern
Plains and Midwest as ascent from the western US trough overspreads
the region. A lee cyclone will support southerly gusts of 20-30 mph
over a A broad area amid fuels with ERC values above the 97th
percentile. While afternoon RH minimums may not be as low as prior
days, record-setting temperatures in the lower to upper 90s are
again expected across the region supporting dry surface conditions
with RH below 30%. This will support widespread critical
fire-weather concerns given the state of drought and recent fire
activity.

...Southwest...
As the western US trough begins to eject, strong westerly flow aloft
will overspread parts of the Southwest from southern AZ into NM.
Downslope winds of 15-25 mph along with low RH below 15% will
support several hours of elevated to locally critical fire-weather
conditions within dry fuels, that have supported recent fire
activity.

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe storms are not forecast on Tuesday.

...Synopsis and Discussion...
On Tuesday, an upper low will proceed northward across the TN and OH
Valleys, beneath the larger-scale upper ridge extending from the
Northeast into eastern Canada. As this occurs, winds aloft will
generally weaken from FL into the Mid Atlantic, but cool
temperatures aloft will maintain thunderstorm chances over much of
the East. Severe chances will be limited by poor lapse rates aloft
in most areas.

To the west, a deep upper trough will move eastward across the Great
Basin, with a intense midlevel speed max moving from southern CA
toward the Four Corners area. Moderate southwest flow aloft will
exist over the central and northern Rockies, with increasing
west/northwest flow aloft from NM into TX north of a Mexican upper
ridge. Beneath the upper trough, cold air aloft will favor daytime
thunderstorms from the Sierra into the northern Rockies, and into
the evening across the western Dakotas.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1130 AM CDT Mon May 12 2025

Valid 121630Z - 131200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS EASTERN
MONTANA AND NORTHWEST NORTH DAKOTA...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms are possible across parts of the
Southeast today, where a tornado or two, localized damaging winds,
and hail could occur. Isolated severe wind gusts are also possible
in northeast Montana to northwest North Dakota around early evening.

...Southeast...
Vertically stacked cyclone persists over the Mid-South this morning.
Expectation is for this system to become more progressive today,
ejecting into western TN by early tomorrow morning. A moist airmass
remains in place downstream of this cyclone across the Southeast,
and numerous showers and thunderstorms are currently ongoing within
the warm conveyor of this system from FL into GA and the Carolina.
Moderate southwesterly/southerly will persist within this warm
sector, and effective shear should be sufficient for multicell
clusters and transient updraft rotation. However, only modest
destabilization is anticipated across much of the region, limiting
the overall severe potential. Expectation is for occasionally strong
storms in areas of sufficient destabilization, with damaging
downbursts and hail as the primary risk. A corridor of greater
severe potential could be developing across southern GA and northern
FL where some heating is occurring.

...Northeast Montana/northwest North Dakota...
Deep shortwave trough will continue to push eastward across the
Pacific Northwest today, with associated southwesterly flow aloft
extending from northern CA into the northern High Plains. Deeply
mixed thermodynamic profiles are expected across the region as the
airmass destabilizes this afternoon. Isolated thunderstorms are most
probable from mid-afternoon into evening with development
near/behind an eastward-advancing front. Convective coverage off the
higher terrain of southern Montana should be less than in recent
days. However, the potential will still exist for a few dry
microbursts producing localized severe-caliber wind gusts as the
storms move off the terrain into more of eastern MT.

Mesoscale Discussion 0765
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0139 PM CDT Sun May 11 2025

Areas affected...eastern Idaho into western Wyoming and southwest
Montana

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 111839Z - 112115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Storms should gradually increase in coverage and intensity
from eastern Idaho into southwest Montana, with both hail and gust
potential.

DISCUSSION...A line of convection continue to increase in intensity
over the upper Snake River Plain, with both strong heating and
low-level warm advection ahead of it. Continued steepening of
deep-layer lapse rates as the upper trough moves in the from the
west and more heating should support further strengthening of this
convection. Strong deep-layer shear will favor hail production with
these storms over eastern ID. A brief/weak tornado cannot be ruled
out with the stronger cells this afternoon, as low-level stretching
is maximized.

Farther north toward the Bitterroots, stronger cooling aloft is
occurring, and areas of heating persist ahead of this activity as
well. Long hodographs and cold midlevel temperatures will favor hail
with these storms through the day.

Mesoscale Discussion 0767
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0221 PM CDT Sun May 11 2025

Areas affected...central Florida northward toward southeast Georgia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 111921Z - 112145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Storms are forecast to increase in coverage throughout the
afternoon from the central Florida Peninsula into northeast Florida
and southeast Georgia.

DISCUSSION...Storms are currently increasing east of Tampa to west
of Okeechobee where strong heating has led to strong instability.
The southerly flow regime should support a north/northeast movement
to this development, affecting the remainder of central into
northeastern Florida. Breaks in the clouds in those downstream areas
are developing, and this should further increase instability.
Although temperatures aloft are not as cool as previous days, MUCAPE
over 2000 J/kg and deep-layer shear of 35-40 kt will support
cellular storm mode with sporadic hail > 1.00" expected. Locally
strong to damaging gusts cannot be ruled out as well, especially
with any merging outflows.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 245
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
110 PM MDT Sun May 11 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Eastern Idaho
  Northern Utah
  Western Wyoming

* Effective this Sunday afternoon and evening from 110 PM until
  800 PM MDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 80
    mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm intensity and coverage is expected to
increase this afternoon across eastern ID, northern UT, and western
WY. Environmental conditions support the potential for strong to
severe storms capable of strong gusts. Isolated large hail is also
possible, particularly in areas of higher terrain.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 80
statute miles east and west of a line from 65 miles north northeast
of Idaho Falls ID to 40 miles southwest of Salt Lake City UT. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU5).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 70 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
23035.

Mesoscale Discussion 0766
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0149 PM CDT Sun May 11 2025

Areas affected...Portions of southeast Georgia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 111849Z - 112045Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A locally greater risk for damaging winds and perhaps a
tornado is evident in southeast Georgia near a local warm front
feature.

DISCUSSION...A small corridor in southeast Georgia has heated into
the low 80s F. A few weak discrete cells exist near the
Georgia/South Carolina state line. One cell has recently intensified
and shown signs of low-level rotation. The localized warm front
feature will promote at least marginal potential for a brief tornado
with southeasterly winds near the boundary. Nearby KCLX radar
accordingly shows modest 0-1 km SRH. Over the next hour or two this
environment will support a locally greater risk for damaging winds
and perhaps a tornado. The discrete cells will have the greatest
potential, but stronger updrafts within the linear segment farther
southwest could also acquire low-level rotation as well.

Mesoscale Discussion 0764
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0130 PM CDT Sun May 11 2025

Areas affected...Salt Lake Vicinity

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 111830Z - 112030Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Severe wind gusts will be possible this afternoon with
high-based showers and embedded thunderstorms.

DISCUSSION...With temperatures rising into the low/mid 80s F in the
vicinity of Salt Lake, high-based showers and isolated thunderstorms
have deepened over the last hour. A few of these storms have
produced 58-63 mph measured gusts in Tooele/Salt Lake Counties.
While low-level wind fields are not overly strong, the 9.2 C/km
700-500 mb lapse rate observed in this mornings 12Z SLC sounding,
coupled with steep low-level lapse rates and high surface dewpoint
depressions, will continue to support strong diabatically driven
downdrafts. Severe wind gusts will remain possible through the
afternoon in association with this weak, disorganized convection.
