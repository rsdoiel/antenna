Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0259 PM CDT Mon May 12 2025

Valid 122000Z - 131200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS EASTERN
MONTANA AND NORTHWEST NORTH DAKOTA...PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHEAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms are possible across parts of the
Southeast today, where a tornado or two, localized damaging winds,
and hail could occur. Isolated severe wind gusts are also possible
in northeast Montana to northwest North Dakota around early evening.

...20Z Update...
Minor adjustments were made in the Southeast based on observed
convective trends. Greater buoyancy has developed in southeast to
east-central Georgia. This zone could have locally higher potential
for strong to severe storms. However, mid-level dry air is evident
on water vapor imagery. Updrafts may tend to struggle to intensify
due to dry air entrainment. Elsewhere, the forecast remains
unchanged.

..Wendt.. 05/12/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1130 AM CDT Mon May 12 2025/

...Southeast...
Vertically stacked cyclone persists over the Mid-South this morning.
Expectation is for this system to become more progressive today,
ejecting into western TN by early tomorrow morning. A moist airmass
remains in place downstream of this cyclone across the Southeast,
and numerous showers and thunderstorms are currently ongoing within
the warm conveyor of this system from FL into GA and the Carolina.
Moderate southwesterly/southerly will persist within this warm
sector, and effective shear should be sufficient for multicell
clusters and transient updraft rotation. However, only modest
destabilization is anticipated across much of the region, limiting
the overall severe potential. Expectation is for occasionally strong
storms in areas of sufficient destabilization, with damaging
downbursts and hail as the primary risk. A corridor of greater
severe potential could be developing across southern GA and northern
FL where some heating is occurring.

...Northeast Montana/northwest North Dakota...
Deep shortwave trough will continue to push eastward across the
Pacific Northwest today, with associated southwesterly flow aloft
extending from northern CA into the northern High Plains. Deeply
mixed thermodynamic profiles are expected across the region as the
airmass destabilizes this afternoon. Isolated thunderstorms are most
probable from mid-afternoon into evening with development
near/behind an eastward-advancing front. Convective coverage off the
higher terrain of southern Montana should be less than in recent
days. However, the potential will still exist for a few dry
microbursts producing localized severe-caliber wind gusts as the
storms move off the terrain into more of eastern MT.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0259 PM CDT Mon May 12 2025

Valid 131200Z - 141200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EASTERN NORTH DAKOTA AND WESTERN
MINNESOTA...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF THE DESERT SOUTHWEST...

...Northern Plains and Upper-Midwest...
Hot, dry and breezy conditions ahead of a surface trough and cold
front will continue for Tuesday across portions of the Northern
Plains. Fuels continue to dry after several days of well above
normal temperatures with ERC values in the 90-97th percentile across
the area. Critical highlights were added to much of the  Red River
Valley of the North for this persistent fire weather threat.

...Southwest...
An approaching upper-level trough and accelerating mid-level flow
over a deep, dry boundary layer is still expected to bring gusty
west-southwest winds to much of the Southwest. Fuels continue to
dry/cure farther north into eastern Arizona and western New Mexico,
heightening fire spread potential. Slight adjustments to Elevated
and Critical highlights were needed to account for additional
available fuels.

..Williams.. 05/12/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0154 AM CDT Mon May 12 2025/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough across the western U.S. will translate
eastward across the Rockies with strong mid-level flow overspreading
much of the Southwest. Lee troughing will encourage strong westerly
winds and dry downslope conditions across the Southwest and High
Plains. With little recent rainfall and above normal temperatures
overlapping the increased surface winds, elevated fire-weather
conditions are likely.

...Southwest...
The upper trough and attendant mid-level jet are forecast to
intensify and aid in the development of  stronger winds within a
well-mixed boundary layer across much of the Southwest. Westerly
downslope flow of 20-30 mph amid RH values below 15% will support
widespread dry and windy conditions across southeastern AZ into
southern NM Tuesday. Several days of above-normal temperatures and
poor humidity recoveries suggest additional drying of already
receptive fuels is likely. Widespread elevated to critical fire
weather conditions are likely across parts of the Southwest Tuesday
afternoon and evening.

...Red River of the North...
As the upper trough intensifies to the west, an elongated area of
low pressure will deepen near the international border. Strong
southerly winds are likely for another day east of the surface
trough/low. Persistent above-normal temperatures should maintain low
RH below 30% and dry fuels. With southerly gusts to 20 mph, several
hours of elevated fire-weather conditions appear likely across the
eastern Dakotas and western MN.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0211 PM CDT Mon May 12 2025

Valid 141200Z - 151200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER CENTRAL AND
EASTERN PARTS OF THE DAKOTAS AND NEBRASKA...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong to severe thunderstorms are possible mainly over
parts of the Dakotas and Nebraska Wednesday afternoon and evening.

...Synopsis...
On Wednesday, a potent shortwave trough will move from the Four
Corners region into the central Plains, with a 70+ kt midlevel speed
max over KS by 12Z Thursday. The primary upper low will deepen over
eastern MT, with most of the cooling aloft north of a line from
northern NM into eastern NE. Ahead of this system, heights will rise
over the MS Valley and Southeast, while the lingering upper trough
over the East dissipates further.

At the surface, a trough will stretch roughly from the central
Dakotas into KS at 00Z, with a surface low taking shape and
deepening overnight into eastern NE and IA. Modest moisture return
will occur ahead of the surface trough, with 50s to near 60 F
dewpoints to the Dakotas portion of the boundary. A more robust
plume of moisture with mid 60s F dewpoints is likely from the lower
MO to middle MS Valleys.

Overnight, winds around 850 mb will strengthen as the low develops,
but will also veer from southwest through northwest, resulting in
advection of drier air.

...Northern and central Plains...
Northern portions of the upper trough will emerge into the northern
Plains in meridional fashion through early evening, with the primary
speed max well to the south until early Thursday. Gradual cooling
aloft will overspread the surface trough and wind shift, where
strong heating will occur. The result will be moderate instability,
with scattered storms erupting within the north-south zone from the
Dakotas into NE. 

Coincident with the storm development, a cold frontal surge will
occur over the northern High Plains, which should help push this
activity perhaps into western MN and IA by 12Z Thursday. Shear
profiles will not be particularly strong initially, but may become
increasingly favorable overnight to support corridors of severe wind
and hail.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1156 AM CDT Mon May 12 2025

Valid 121700Z - 131200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE NORTHERN PLAINS AND UPPER
MIDWEST...

...Northern Plains and Midwest...
An approaching upper-level trough and advancing cold front will
support shower and thunderstorm development across northeastern
Montana late this afternoon into the evening hours. Forward  motion
of precipitation cores will limit rainfall to likely less than one
tenth of an inch. However, a cooler air mass and higher humidity
will infiltrate into eastern Montana tonight, with additional
widespread rainfall expected Tuesday across the area. Before
convection commences late this afternoon, a well-mixed boundary
layer and dry downslope flow ahead of the upper-trough should
support a few hours of elevated fire weather conditions across the
area, necessitating and westward expansion of Elevated highlights.

...Southwest...
Latest fuels guidance indicates increased fire spread potential
across portions of eastern Arizona and western New Mexico. With a
broad area of stronger winds and dry conditions across the region,
expanded Elevated highlights northward to encompass drier fuels
along the Arizona and New Mexico border.

..Williams.. 05/12/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0152 AM CDT Mon May 12 2025/

...Synopsis...
As the blocking within the upper-air pattern begins to breakdown a
trough will deepens over the western US. Strong mid-level flow will
gradually move into the Plains, as upper ridging moves eastward.
Strong lee troughing/cyclogenesis will support gusty south/westerly
winds over the High Plains. Fire-weather conditions are expected
across the Northern Great Plains and Southwest this afternoon and
evening.

...Northern Plains and Midwest...
Another day of strong southerly winds are likely across the northern
Plains and Midwest as ascent from the western US trough overspreads
the region. A lee cyclone will support southerly gusts of 20-30 mph
over a A broad area amid fuels with ERC values above the 97th
percentile. While afternoon RH minimums may not be as low as prior
days, record-setting temperatures in the lower to upper 90s are
again expected across the region supporting dry surface conditions
with RH below 30%. This will support widespread critical
fire-weather concerns given the state of drought and recent fire
activity.

...Southwest...
As the western US trough begins to eject, strong westerly flow aloft
will overspread parts of the Southwest from southern AZ into NM.
Downslope winds of 15-25 mph along with low RH below 15% will
support several hours of elevated to locally critical fire-weather
conditions within dry fuels, that have supported recent fire
activity.

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe storms are not forecast on Tuesday.

...Synopsis and Discussion...
On Tuesday, an upper low will proceed northward across the TN and OH
Valleys, beneath the larger-scale upper ridge extending from the
Northeast into eastern Canada. As this occurs, winds aloft will
generally weaken from FL into the Mid Atlantic, but cool
temperatures aloft will maintain thunderstorm chances over much of
the East. Severe chances will be limited by poor lapse rates aloft
in most areas.

To the west, a deep upper trough will move eastward across the Great
Basin, with a intense midlevel speed max moving from southern CA
toward the Four Corners area. Moderate southwest flow aloft will
exist over the central and northern Rockies, with increasing
west/northwest flow aloft from NM into TX north of a Mexican upper
ridge. Beneath the upper trough, cold air aloft will favor daytime
thunderstorms from the Sierra into the northern Rockies, and into
the evening across the western Dakotas.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS EASTERN
MONTANA AND NORTHWEST NORTH DAKOTA...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms are possible across parts of the
Southeast today, where a tornado or two, localized damaging winds,
and hail could occur. Isolated severe wind gusts are also possible
in northeast Montana to northwest North Dakota around early evening.

...Southeast...
Vertically stacked cyclone persists over the Mid-South this morning.
Expectation is for this system to become more progressive today,
ejecting into western TN by early tomorrow morning. A moist airmass
remains in place downstream of this cyclone across the Southeast,
and numerous showers and thunderstorms are currently ongoing within
the warm conveyor of this system from FL into GA and the Carolina.
Moderate southwesterly/southerly will persist within this warm
sector, and effective shear should be sufficient for multicell
clusters and transient updraft rotation. However, only modest
destabilization is anticipated across much of the region, limiting
the overall severe potential. Expectation is for occasionally strong
storms in areas of sufficient destabilization, with damaging
downbursts and hail as the primary risk. A corridor of greater
severe potential could be developing across southern GA and northern
FL where some heating is occurring.

...Northeast Montana/northwest North Dakota...
Deep shortwave trough will continue to push eastward across the
Pacific Northwest today, with associated southwesterly flow aloft
extending from northern CA into the northern High Plains. Deeply
mixed thermodynamic profiles are expected across the region as the
airmass destabilizes this afternoon. Isolated thunderstorms are most
probable from mid-afternoon into evening with development
near/behind an eastward-advancing front. Convective coverage off the
higher terrain of southern Montana should be less than in recent
days. However, the potential will still exist for a few dry
microbursts producing localized severe-caliber wind gusts as the
storms move off the terrain into more of eastern MT.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS EASTERN
MONTANA AND NORTHWEST NORTH DAKOTA...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms are possible across parts of the
Southeast today, where a tornado or two, localized damaging winds,
and hail could occur. Isolated severe wind gusts are also possible
in northeast Montana to northwest North Dakota around early evening.

...Southeast States...
The persistent vertically stacked mid/upper low that has been nearly
stationary over the Sabine Valley/Lower Mississippi River Valley
will finally accelerate northeastward towards western Tennessee
through tonight. A jetlet of cyclonically curved mid-level
southerlies over the northeast Gulf and Florida Panhandle will
dampen somewhat as it becomes centered on north Florida to southeast
Georgia vicinity this afternoon. More probable diurnal thunderstorm
development is anticipated from the left-exit region of this jetlet
westward towards the cold-core of the stacked low. 

Deep-layer vertical shear will relax with westward extent, yielding
more of a pulse strong-storm environment from Middle Tennessee to
western Alabama and Mississippi. Despite the meridional deep-layer
wind profile, effective shear should be sufficient for multicell
clusters and transient updraft rotation centered on eastern Alabama
and Georgia into north Florida. Pockets of modest buoyancy should
support a mix of small to marginally severe hail and strong gusts
capable of isolated damaging winds. Along the eastern periphery of
this activity, a tornado or two is possible where there remains some
overlap with the western belt of enhanced low-level flow, including
South Carolina into both western and near-coastal North Carolina.

Farther south, a more nebulous convective scenario is anticipated
amid extensive ongoing convection across the Florida Peninsula and
Keys. Guidance differs markedly with the degree of destabilization,
as adequate boundary-layer heating will be required amid poor
mid-level lapse rates near 5 C/km. But some guidance suggests
south-central/southern Florida has the best chance at recovery by
afternoon, although low-level winds will tend to be veering with a
likely diminishing trend of low-level SRH.

...Northeast Montana/northwest North Dakota...
Another day of rather deeply mixed thermodynamic profiles is
expected across the region. Isolated thunderstorms are most probable
from mid-afternoon into evening with development near/behind an
eastward-advancing front. Overall convective coverage off the higher
terrain of southern Montana should be substantially less than in
recent days, amid deep-layer southwesterly wind profiles. The
potential will exist for a few dry microbursts producing localized
severe-caliber wind gusts.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0359 AM CDT Mon May 12 2025

Valid 151200Z - 201200Z

...DISCUSSION...
An active period of severe weather is anticipated through early next
week based on recent trends in long-range guidance. A transition to
a progressive upper-level regime is expected over the next seven
days as a series of upper waves traverse the CONUS with favorable
wavelengths for air mass/moisture recovery into central portions of
the CONUS. Although both the GFS and ECMWF (and their respective
ensemble families) show similar synoptic evolutions through the
extended period, predictability in any severe threat currently
appears greatest on D4/Thursday and D5/Friday.

...D4/Thursday...
The upper-level trough currently over the Pacific Northwest is
forecast to eject into the upper MS River Valley through the day
Thursday with an attendant surface low deepening across the upper MS
Valley. A Pacific front is forecast to push east into an expanding
warm sector that should span from the MS River into the upper Great
Lakes and OH River Valley. Strong mid-level flow orthogonal to the
front should generally promote discrete/semi-discrete convection by
late afternoon on the eastern fringe of a stout EML. The consistent
signal for QPF within the warm sector coincident with 50-60 knot
mid-level flow and the intensifying nature of the synoptic low
suggests that a widespread severe weather event is possible and may
expand further east than depicted in previous forecasts. Despite
these trends, regional discrepancies among guidance limit confidence
in where the more robust severe corridors will become established.
Notable factors limiting confidence are the potential for strong
capping across much of the OH Valley and a faster progression of the
surface low/front in recent GFS/GEFS solutions (which typically
exhibit a fast bias at this range). 

...D5/Friday...
The Pacific front/outflow associated with D4/Thursday's convection
is expected to stall across the lower OH Valley/mid-MS Valley before
gradually returning north as an effective warm front on Friday.
Ensemble guidance shows a reasonably strong signal for dewpoints in
the mid/upper 60s (potentially into the low 70s) along and south of
this boundary by peak heating. A mid-level impulse propagating over
the region should maintain elongated hodographs and provide
sufficient lift for thunderstorm development along the boundary.
This synoptic regime suggests that one or more organized
clusters/linear segments may propagate along the boundary and into
parts of the mid-MS Valley, lower OH Valley, and potentially into
the TN Valley. Given the thermodynamic and kinematic environment
forecast by ensemble guidance, such a cluster/line will likely pose
a severe threat. A 15% risk area has been introduced where the QPF
signal associated with this regime has been most consistent over
recent model runs, but further forecast refinements are expected.

Mesoscale Discussion 0765
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0139 PM CDT Sun May 11 2025

Areas affected...eastern Idaho into western Wyoming and southwest
Montana

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 111839Z - 112115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Storms should gradually increase in coverage and intensity
from eastern Idaho into southwest Montana, with both hail and gust
potential.

DISCUSSION...A line of convection continue to increase in intensity
over the upper Snake River Plain, with both strong heating and
low-level warm advection ahead of it. Continued steepening of
deep-layer lapse rates as the upper trough moves in the from the
west and more heating should support further strengthening of this
convection. Strong deep-layer shear will favor hail production with
these storms over eastern ID. A brief/weak tornado cannot be ruled
out with the stronger cells this afternoon, as low-level stretching
is maximized.

Farther north toward the Bitterroots, stronger cooling aloft is
occurring, and areas of heating persist ahead of this activity as
well. Long hodographs and cold midlevel temperatures will favor hail
with these storms through the day.

Mesoscale Discussion 0767
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0221 PM CDT Sun May 11 2025

Areas affected...central Florida northward toward southeast Georgia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 111921Z - 112145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Storms are forecast to increase in coverage throughout the
afternoon from the central Florida Peninsula into northeast Florida
and southeast Georgia.

DISCUSSION...Storms are currently increasing east of Tampa to west
of Okeechobee where strong heating has led to strong instability.
The southerly flow regime should support a north/northeast movement
to this development, affecting the remainder of central into
northeastern Florida. Breaks in the clouds in those downstream areas
are developing, and this should further increase instability.
Although temperatures aloft are not as cool as previous days, MUCAPE
over 2000 J/kg and deep-layer shear of 35-40 kt will support
cellular storm mode with sporadic hail > 1.00" expected. Locally
strong to damaging gusts cannot be ruled out as well, especially
with any merging outflows.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 245
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
110 PM MDT Sun May 11 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Eastern Idaho
  Northern Utah
  Western Wyoming

* Effective this Sunday afternoon and evening from 110 PM until
  800 PM MDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 80
    mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm intensity and coverage is expected to
increase this afternoon across eastern ID, northern UT, and western
WY. Environmental conditions support the potential for strong to
severe storms capable of strong gusts. Isolated large hail is also
possible, particularly in areas of higher terrain.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 80
statute miles east and west of a line from 65 miles north northeast
of Idaho Falls ID to 40 miles southwest of Salt Lake City UT. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU5).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 70 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
23035.

Mesoscale Discussion 0766
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0149 PM CDT Sun May 11 2025

Areas affected...Portions of southeast Georgia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 111849Z - 112045Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A locally greater risk for damaging winds and perhaps a
tornado is evident in southeast Georgia near a local warm front
feature.

DISCUSSION...A small corridor in southeast Georgia has heated into
the low 80s F. A few weak discrete cells exist near the
Georgia/South Carolina state line. One cell has recently intensified
and shown signs of low-level rotation. The localized warm front
feature will promote at least marginal potential for a brief tornado
with southeasterly winds near the boundary. Nearby KCLX radar
accordingly shows modest 0-1 km SRH. Over the next hour or two this
environment will support a locally greater risk for damaging winds
and perhaps a tornado. The discrete cells will have the greatest
potential, but stronger updrafts within the linear segment farther
southwest could also acquire low-level rotation as well.

Mesoscale Discussion 0764
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0130 PM CDT Sun May 11 2025

Areas affected...Salt Lake Vicinity

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 111830Z - 112030Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Severe wind gusts will be possible this afternoon with
high-based showers and embedded thunderstorms.

DISCUSSION...With temperatures rising into the low/mid 80s F in the
vicinity of Salt Lake, high-based showers and isolated thunderstorms
have deepened over the last hour. A few of these storms have
produced 58-63 mph measured gusts in Tooele/Salt Lake Counties.
While low-level wind fields are not overly strong, the 9.2 C/km
700-500 mb lapse rate observed in this mornings 12Z SLC sounding,
coupled with steep low-level lapse rates and high surface dewpoint
depressions, will continue to support strong diabatically driven
downdrafts. Severe wind gusts will remain possible through the
afternoon in association with this weak, disorganized convection.
