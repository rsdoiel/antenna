Mesoscale Discussion 0807
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0740 AM CDT Fri May 16 2025

Areas affected...northeast AR into central KY

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 259...

Valid 161240Z - 161445Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 259
continues.

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm cluster may continue to pose a risk for hail
and sporadic strong gusts this morning. Local watch extension may be
needed for portions of Severe Thunderstorm Watch 259.

DISCUSSION...Strong to severe thunderstorms continue from northeast
AR into central KY this morning. While previously a new watch was
considered, given some weakening in the clusters across central KY,
local watch extensions may be more appropriate as uncertainty in
downstream evolution has increased. Nevertheless, a favorable
environment will persist, supporting a continued large hail risk in
the short term. If further upscale growth occurs with ongoing
clusters, a risk for damaging gust potential could increase later
this morning or toward midday downstream from WW 259. Local watch
extensions for 1-2 hours may be need if current trends persist for
another 30-60 minutes.

Mesoscale Discussion 0806
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0635 AM CDT Fri May 16 2025

Areas affected...northeast AR/southeast MO into parts of KY/TN...WV
and western VA

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 259...

Valid 161135Z - 161330Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 259
continues.

SUMMARY...Severe thunderstorms posing a risk for large to very large
hail will persist across Severe Thunderstorm Watch 259. This
activity may maintain severity downstream into eastern Kentucky and
portions of West Virginia and western Virginia. A new watch may be
needed to replace WW 259 and to expand downstream.

DISCUSSION...Scattered severe thunderstorm clusters are ongoing this
morning from northeast AR into central KY. This activity is
occurring in a warm advection regime and on the fringes of an 850 mb
southwesterly low-level jet. While some inhibition is present in the
low-levels given the nocturnally cooled boundary layer, MUCAPE from
1000-2000 J/kg is in place amid a moist airmass. Elongated/straight
supercell profiles and cool temperatures aloft also are present.
Thus, a large hail threat will accompany any more discrete
convection. 

Recent radar trends suggest clustering may be underway near the MO
Bootheel and into western KY. If this continues, convection could
develop into a small MCS and move across KY toward WV/VA, posing a
risk for strong/severe wind gusts as well as the downstream airmass
destabilizes and inhibition erodes later this morning as diurnal
heating ensues. 

An isolated cell also is approaching the edge of WW 259 across
central KY and a downstream watch and/or larger watch replacement
may be needed soon.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0746 AM CDT Fri May 16 2025

Valid 161300Z - 171200Z

...THERE IS A MODERATE RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PORTIONS OF
EAST-CENTRAL AND SOUTHEAST MISSOURI...WESTERN AND CENTRAL
KENTUCKY...SOUTHERN ILLINOIS AND INDIANA...SOUTHWEST
OHIO...NORTHWEST TENNESSEE...AND NORTHEAST ARKANSAS...

...SUMMARY...
A regional outbreak of severe thunderstorms is likely this afternoon
into tonight across parts of the mid Mississippi, Ohio and Tennessee
Valleys. This will include intense supercells associated with
tornadoes, large hail and wind damage. Several strong tornadoes are
expected, and a long-track high-end tornado will be possible. From
the evening into the overnight, a bowing line segment is expected to
form with potential for tornadoes and damaging winds, some possibly
greater than 75 mph.

...Mid Mississippi and Ohio Valley/Tennessee Valley Region...
As an upper-level low near the MN/ND border shifts east today, a 
mid-level jet streak will move from the Plains into the
mid-Mississippi Valley. A surface cold front will move east across
the Great Lakes, Midwest and OH/TN Valley region this afternoon and
tonight. An expansive warm/moist sector will destabilize during the
day, setting the stage for a regional severe weather outbreak this
afternoon and tonight.

Scattered severe thunderstorms, with a history of large hail, were
ongoing at 13z from northeast AR into eastern KY. Clusters of severe
storms, including supercells, will continue moving northeast within
this corridor through at least early afternoon. The eventual
longevity of these storms remains uncertain, however downstream
diurnal destabilization could allow storms with a severe hail/wind
threat to move into WV/western VA this afternoon.

In the wake of these morning storms, destabilization will occur as a
warm front lifts north, with strong instability (MLCAPE in excess of
2500 J/kg) developing from portions of eastern MO east into the
OH/TN Valley region, and south in advance of the front into eastern
TX.  The presence of strong mid-level flow will contribute to
deep-layer shear averaging 50 kts or higher across a large area.

Vigorous redevelopment of severe storms is expected by early
afternoon across southern/eastern MO as height falls overspread the
area. More isolated development is expected southward along the cold
front towards 00Z. Initial storm development will strongly favor
supercell storm mode with all severe hazards possible, including the
potential for strong tornadoes across the Moderate/Enhanced Risk
areas where low-level shear will be strongest. Large to very large
hail will also be possible with mature supercells this afternoon
through early evening. As storms continue moving east across the
OH/TN Valley region, eventual upscale growth into multiple bowing
segments is expected. The tornado threat will continue, especially
with QLCS circulations, and significant severe gusts will also be
possible.  

...Ark-La-Tex/Lower Mississippi Valley...
Warm mid-level temperatures will tend to delay thunderstorm
initiation along the southward-trailing cold front into northeast TX
until later in the day, however at least isolated development is
expected towards 22z-00z. MLCAPE in excess of 3000 J/kg and 45-55
kts of deep-layer shear oriented favorably relative to the front
suggests a supercell mode with large to very large hail, along with
damaging gusts. Although weaker low-level shear will be present in
this area, some potential for a tornado will exist with any mature
supercell. With time, storms may increase in coverage and begin to
cluster in an environment favorable for a continued severe wind/hail
threat.

...Portions of the Mid-Atlantic/northern DelMarVa Peninsula...
As the southern portion of the long-lived MCS over PA/NY continues
moving east/southeast today, the potential will exist for
re-development of organized storms, including supercells, over
portions of southeast PA/southern NJ and the northern DelMarVa
peninsula. With moderate west/northwest flow in place to the east of
the upper level ridge, RAP/HRRR forecast soundings depict sufficient
deep shear and moderate instability for a severe hail and wind risk.
Some consideration was given for higher severe probabilities in this
area, however uncertainty remains on the location of a corridor of
greater risk.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0400 AM CDT Fri May 16 2025

Valid 191200Z - 241200Z

...DISCUSSION...
...D4/Monday - Central/Southern Plains into the Midwest...
A very moist and unstable environment will be present east of a
dryline across Kansas and Oklahoma on Monday morning. A surface low
across Kansas/Nebraska will weaken through the day and reconcentrate
farther south as a negatively tilted mid-level shortwave trough
moves into the central/southern Plains. The evolution of the upper
pattern will have some impact on the location and severity of the
severe weather threat on Monday. Despite these uncertainties, height
falls across a sharp dryline with a strongly unstable and uncapped
warm sector and supercell wind profiles should support severe storms
along and east of I-35 in Oklahoma and into southeast Kansas. All
severe weather hazards will be possible from any supercells which
mature on Monday.

Storms will be possible farther north across eastern Kansas and
western Missouri, but storm intensity is less clear given weaker
instability and messier storm mode along the warm frontal zone. In
addition, some elevated hail will be possible north of the warm
front into southeast Nebraska and Iowa.  

...D5/Tuesday...
Thunderstorms will likely be ongoing at the beginning of the period
across the Midwest and perhaps as far south as eastern Oklahoma and
western Arkansas. These storms and their associated cloud cover will
have significant impact on destabilization across a broad warm
sector on Tuesday. A deepening mid-level low will develop across the
Plains and start to advance east on Tuesday. A strong mid-level jet
streak along the southern periphery of this upper low will
overspread the warm sector providing ample shear for storm
organization. Storm intensity remains uncertain on Tuesday due to
antecedent precipitation/cloud cover and differences in model
guidance. However, a broad region of strong to severe storms appears
possible from East Texas to northern Missouri and central Illinois
on Tuesday. 

...Day 6-8...
A few strong to severe storms are possible on Day 6/Wednesday across
the Carolinas before the cold front moves offshore. Storm
coverage/intensity remains unclear at this time given the prior 2
days of storms and uncertainties in the upper-level pattern from
global guidance. Therefore, no probabilities are warranted at this
time. Beyond Day 6, severe weather concerns lessen as quality
moisture is mostly shunted offshore across the CONUS as a cold front
surges into the Gulf/Atlantic.

Mesoscale Discussion 0794
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0322 PM CDT Thu May 15 2025

Areas affected...Parts of central and northern Illinois

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 152022Z - 152215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Large to very large hail and severe winds will be possible
with supercells that can develop later this afternoon. Watch timing
is uncertain but is possible later this afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Cumulus are developing along an eastward moving dryline
near the Mississippi River. Ahead of this boundary, a strongly
unstable airmass is in place (low 90s F temperatures and mid 60s to
low 70s F dewpoints). With the strongest mid-level ascent to the
northwest of the region, timing of storm initiation as well as storm
coverage are uncertain. However, given the lack of MLCIN, a isolated
to widely scattered development appears possible later this
afternoon. 45-55 kts of effective shear will support supercells. The
primary hazards will be large to very large hail and severe winds.
The tornado threat is expected to be less than farther north given
the slightly veered low-level winds and more sizable
temperature/dewpoint spreads at the surface.

Mesoscale Discussion 0793
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0307 PM CDT Thu May 15 2025

Areas affected...portions of central Arkansas into western
Tennessee...far southeast Missouri...far southwestern Kentucky

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 252...

Valid 152007Z - 152130Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 252
continues.

SUMMARY...Ongoing storms may still reach severe limits, with
damaging gusts and large hail the main concerns. These storms may
persist downstream of Severe Thunderstorm Watch 252, so a local
extension of the ongoing watch, or the issuance of a new downstream
Severe Thunderstorm Watch, may be needed.

DISCUSSION...Strong thunderstorms (still possibly elevated) continue
across AR amid a pronounced EML atop rich low-level moisture and
strong deep-layer shear. As such, any storm cores that can intensify
will continue to pose at least a severe hail threat. Severe gusts
are also possible if ongoing storms can become surface based by
either rooting into the boundary layer, or establishing a strong
cold pool, which could lift surface-based parcels to the LFC along
the cold pool leading edge. It remains uncertain if these storms
have peaked in intensity or if greater severe potential exists
downstream. As such, an eastward extension of the ongoing Severe
Thunderstorm Watch, or the issuance of a new watch, may be needed
pending favorable convective trends.

0300 PM CDT Thu May 15 2025

Areas affected...Portions of northwest Wisconsin

Concerning...Tornado Watch 251...

Valid 152000Z - 152130Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 251 continues.

SUMMARY...Tornado potential, including a strong tornado, will shift
into portions of northwest Wisconsin over the next 1-2 hours.

DISCUSSION...A broken line of supercells continues north and east.
These storms will move across the River and into northwest Wisconsin
shortly. Temperatures have risen into low 80s F with dewpoints
remaining near 64 F. Given the storm mode, low-level thermodynamics,
and backed surface winds, this area will be the primary focus for
tornado potential over the next 1-2 hours. Storms have remained in
close proximity to one another, but still sufficiently discrete that
overall inflow quality remains favorable for low-level mesocyclone
intensification. With objective mesoanalysis showing STP of 2-3, a
strong tornado remains possible.

Mesoscale Discussion 0791
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0214 PM CDT Thu May 15 2025

Areas affected...Parts of southern Wisconsin into northern Illinois

Concerning...Severe potential...Tornado Watch likely 

Valid 151914Z - 152115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...A tornado watch will likely be needed this afternoon.
Supercells capable of all severe hazards are expected within the
next few hours.

DISCUSSION...Cumulus continue to deepen both along a dryline and an
area of confluence within the Mississippi Valley. Whether storms
develop within the confluence or when the dryline reaches the
Mississippi River remains a question. 40-50 kts of effective shear
across these surface convergence zones will favor supercells as
storms develop. Large to very large hail will be a concern as well
as severe wind gusts. The 18Z DVN sounding sampled very steep
mid-level lapse rates and a long hodograph. Tornado potential will
also be present. Surface temperature/dewpoint spreads are near 20 F,
but low-level shear and a supercellular mode will favor low-level
rotation. The time frame of greater tornado potential will likely be
22-00Z when the low-level jet increases in southern Wisconsin.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0249 PM CDT Thu May 15 2025

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

A dry, post-frontal air mass will push through portions of the
Midwest this evening, priming northern Illinois for substantially
lower relative humidity for Friday. As a surface low moves into the
Great Lakes region along with accelerating mid-level winds, strong
surface winds of 20-25 mph from the south and southwest will develop
by late morning. The stronger winds combined with relative humidity
falling into the 20-25 percent range will support elevated fire
weather conditions across northern Illinois for Friday morning/early
afternoon. Fire weather threat remains conditional for the Chicago
area as line of showers and thunderstorms and subsequent rainfall
expected this afternoon/evening could limit fire spread potential
for Friday.

..Williams.. 05/15/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0104 AM CDT Thu May 15 2025/

...Synopsis...
Fire-weather potential across the CONUS is relatively low Friday. In
the wake of the departing upper trough, shortwave ridging is
expected over the southern Plains and Southwest. This will
temporarily slow stronger mid-level flow as a Pacific front shifts
eastward. With only modest flow aloft and at the surface, strong
winds are not expected over the driest fuels of the Southwest.
However, warm temperatures and low RH below 20% will remain likely.
This could support some localized fire-weather risk where westerly
winds could gust to 15 mph closer to the terrain. Otherwise,
increasing surface moisture and recent rainfall will largely
preclude fire-weather concerns Friday outside of localized dry and
breezy conditions over parts of the Midwest. However, this is not
expected to be widespread.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0227 PM CDT Thu May 15 2025

Valid 152000Z - 161200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS
EAST-CENTRAL MINNESOTA....MUCH OF WISCONSIN...SOUTHERN AND WESTERN 
LOWER MICHIGAN...NORTHEAST ILLINOIS...NORTHERN INDIANA AND NORTHWEST
OHIO...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS PORTIONS OF 
VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST NORTH CAROLINA...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are expected across parts of the upper
Mississippi River Valley and Great Lakes this afternoon and evening.
Tornadoes, some of which could be strong, and very large hail and
damaging winds will be possible. Severe thunderstorms are also
expected through the lower Ohio River Valley, Ozarks and in parts of
the Mid-Atlantic.

...20z Update...
Only minor changes were made to trim probabilities behind ongoing
convective activity with this update.

The Enhanced Risk across the Midwest remains unchanged. Thunderstorm
activity has been ongoing in this region, with reports of a couple
of tornadoes in western Minnesota. Expect thunderstorm activity to
continue to strengthen in this area. See MCD#791 for more
information on the short term threats. 

See previous discussion for more information concerning the broader
Slight Risk across the Mid to upper Mississippi Valley and in the
Central Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic below.

..Thornton/Mosier.. 05/15/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1128 AM CDT Thu May 15 2025/

...Mid to Upper Mississippi Valley/Great Lakes/Ohio Valley...
Recent satellite imagery shows an upper low over SD, with a
negatively tilted shortwave trough moving into the Mid MO Valley.
Surface analysis places an occluded surface low associated with this
system over southeast ND, with an occluded front extending
southeastward to a triple point over far southeast SD. A cold front
extends south-southeastward from this front across far western IA
and into far northeast MO before arcing more southwestward across
far western MO and more southwestward across western OK. A warm
front extends easterward from this triple point across southern MN
and then more southeastward across southwest WI and northern IL.
These boundaries, including the occluded front, will all act in
tandem with increasing large-scale forcing for ascent to force
thunderstorm development this afternoon and evening.

The ongoing storms from eastern SD into central MN are confirmation
of the buoyancy sampled in the 12Z MPX sounding. Expectation is for
instability to build across the region as heating and low-level
moisture advection occur amid steep mid-level lapse rates. Airmass
destabilization and thunderstorm development is anticipated first
from the eastern Dakotas into MN, the occluded front as it shifts
northward as both the primary surface low and triple point low shift
northwestward. Additional development is then anticipated farther
southeast along the warm front across WI. Storms that develop in the
vicinity of the occluded front will likely have elevated structures,
with large hail as the primary risk. Some isolated very large hail
(i.e. greater than 2" in diameter) is possible. Farther southeast,
the corridor along the warm front appears very favorable for
supercells capable of all severe hazards, including very large hail,
strong wind gusts, and tornadoes. A locally higher tornado potential
may exist from  central into southeastern WI from 18Z-22Z. Deeper
mixing is anticipated farther south into northern IL, but the
overall environment will still support robust, organized updrafts.
There may be some trend initially for these storms to quickly become
outflow dominant, but strengthening mid-level flow across the region
after 21Z should aid in maintaining a more organized mode. Upscale
growth into a organized MCS appears probable after 00Z, with the
potential for significant-severe gusts as this line moves eastward
in southern Lower MI. The threat for damaging gusts and isolated
hail will persist throughout the night across Lower MI and the
middle/upper OH Valley.

...Ozarks into the TN Valley...
Additional thunderstorm development is anticipated this afternoon
across AR as a cold front pushes eastward across the region.
Moderate to strong flow aloft should allow for storms to move off
this boundary quickly into a strongly buoyant airmass downstream.
Warm air aloft could limit overall storm longevity during the
afternoon/early evening, but the warm/dry mid-levels are conducive
for producing strong outflows capable of damaging gusts. Whether or
not organization will occur along these outflows is uncertain, but a
conditional risk for continued damaging gusts exists into TN. 

Additional thunderstorms are possible during the evening and
overnight in the wake of the front. Persistent steep mid-level lapse
rates and strong shear will support large hail with some of these
storms.

...Central Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic...  
Large-scale height rises are expected across the region, but
diurnal heating and orographic effects will aid in thunderstorm
development across the higher terrain this afternoon. Northwesterly
flow aloft will favor a southeastward storm motion within an
environment of moderate/locally strong instability. 35-45 kts of
northwesterly deep shear is anticipated, supporting supercell
structures and clusters, posing a risk for large hail and damaging
winds. The overall hodograph structure and resulting storm motion
appears favorable for some very large hail over 2" in diameter as
well.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0220 PM CDT Thu May 15 2025

Valid 171200Z - 181200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS OF
THE SOUTHERN PLAINS INTO ARKANSAS...AND OVER PARTS OF THE
MID-ATLANTIC AND NORTHEAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are possible Saturday across parts of the Mid
Atlantic and Northeast, and across parts of the southeastern Great
Plains to Lower Mississippi Valley.

...Synopsis...

An upper cyclone and attendant shortwave trough over the upper Great
Lakes to the TN Valley will shift east on Saturday, becoming
positioned from NY to offshore the Mid-Atlantic coast by Sunday
morning. Meanwhile, an upper trough will dig across the western U.S.
while upper ridging develops over much of the Plains. A belt of
strong westerly flow associated with the eastern upper trough will
overspread much of eastern U.S., while a sub-tropical jet streak
moves across the southern Plain into the Lower MS Valley. 

At the surface, a cold front will surge east across the Ohio Valley
through early afternoon, and the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast during
the evening/overnight. The southwest extent of this surface boundary
will extend from the Lower OH Valley into central OK Saturday
morning. The boundary may sag southward across portions of the TN
Valley, while the Plains portion of the boundary lifts northward
into KS and southern MO during the evening/overnight. Meanwhile, a
surface dryline will extend south/southwest from near  western OK to
the TX Big Bend vicinity.

...Southern Plains to Lower MS Valley...

The building upper ridge over the Plains will likely suppress
convection across portions of the region as an EML will be difficult
to overcome without stronger large-scale ascent/height falls.
However, low-level convergence along the dryline amid persistent
low-level warm advection and forecast shortwave perturbations
migrating through the upper ridge from the southern Rockies into the
Red River vicinity may aid in isolated to widely scattered storm
development during the afternoon. 

A very moist airmass will be in place (upper 60s/low 70s F
dewpoints) beneath 7.5-8.5 C/km midlevel lapse rates. This will
result in strong instability across the warm sector (MLCAPE greater
than 2500 J/kg). Furthermore, supercell wind profiles are apparent
in forecast soundings, with curved low-level hodographs become
elongated/straight above 2-3 km. Any discrete cells that develop
will pose a risk for large to very large hail. If sufficient storm
coverage occurs, some clustering could result in upscale developing
into an MCS moving across the ArkLaTex vicinity and into the Lower
MS Valley during the evening/nighttime hours. If this occurs, a risk
for damaging gusts will increase.

...Southeast...

Convection may be ongoing/weakening across portions of
MS/AL/GA/SC/NC Saturday morning. It is unclear how this activity may
evolve, but an outflow boundary will likely extend across portions
of MS/AL/GA. Given a very  moist and unstable airmass by afternoon
some redevelopment of thunderstorms is possible. Forcing for ascent
will be nebulous across the Deep South, so coverage may remain
sparse. Nevertheless, any storm that develops could produce strong
gusts or hail.

...NC/VA into the Northeast...

Convection may be ongoing across portions of NC/VA Saturday morning
but likely will be weakening as outflow is expected to be surging
across the Piedmont. It is unclear if redevelopment may occur ahead
of the surface cold front during the afternoon/evening. While a very
moist and unstable airmass will reside across the region,
large-scale ascent will remain weak and focused further north toward
the Northeast. If storms can develop, a risk for large hail and
damaging gusts will be possible. 

Additional storms are expected to develop with northward extent into
the Northeast beneath the upper low and ahead of the surface cold
front. While boundary layer moisture will be more modest with
northward extent, cool temperatures aloft will foster modest
destabilization. Isolated to widely scattered storms will pose a
risk for hail and gusty winds through early evening.

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...THERE IS A MODERATE RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
SOUTHEAST MISSOURI...SOUTHERN ILLINOIS/INDIANA...AND CENTRAL AND
WESTERN KENTUCKY...

...SUMMARY...
A regional outbreak of severe thunderstorms is likely across parts
of the middle Mississippi and Ohio Valleys Friday afternoon into
Friday night.  This may include a few intense supercells posing a
risk for large hail and tornadoes.  During the evening into the
overnight hours, this will include an upscale growing and organizing
bowing line of storms posing a risk for strong, damaging winds and a
continuing risk for tornadoes.

...A regional outbreak of severe storms is expected on Friday across
portions of the Mid-South to the Ohio Valley...

...Synopsis...

An upper cyclone over the Upper Midwest and attendant shortwave
trough will develop east/northeast across much of the Midwest and TN
Valley. A swath of strong mid/upper southwesterly flow will
accompany this system. Forecast guidance shows a 70-90 kt 500 mb jet
spreading across the Mid-MS to OH Valley, while 850-700 mb increases
to 40-60 kt by midday. This will result in supercell wind profiles,
support widespread organized convection. Favorable deep-layer shear
will extend downstream into the central Appalachians and
Mid-Atlantic vicinity as well.

At the surface, low pressure will shift east from northern MN into
the Upper Great Lakes. A warm from southern MO into the OH Valley
Friday morning is forecast to lift northward through the afternoon,
allowing rich boundary layer moisture (mid/upper 60s F dewpoints) to
overspread much of the Lower OH Valley, with a large warm sector in
place across a broad region from east TX to the Great Lakes and
eastward toward the Mid-Atlantic coast. Corridors of moderate to
strong destabilization during the day and into the nighttime hours
will support several areas of severe storms from east Texas into
much of the Midwest and the Mid-Atlantic, some of which could be
significant.

...Mid-MS Valley into the OH/TN Valley Vicinity...

Forecast guidance depicts potential for remnant convection from Day
1/Thu ongoing across KY or TN Friday morning. Current expectation is
that this activity will dissipate or weaken as it shifts east toward
the central Appalachians. Strong warm advection should allow for
rapid airmass recovery in the way of any morning thunderstorm
activity.

By midday, a very moist (mid 60s to low 70s F dewpoints) airmass
will be in place beneath steep midlevel lapse rates, fostering
MLCAPE around 2500-3500 J/kg from southeast MO northward to around
the I-70 corridor and east toward the IN/KY. One or more clusters of
convection is expected to develop by early afternoon within the
strong warm advection regime and as large-scale ascent increases
with the approach of the upper trough and an eastward-advancing cold
front extending from eastern IA/western MO into central OK/TX around
midday.

Supercell wind profiles with enlarged low-level hodographs becoming
elongated above 2-3 km within a volatile thermodynamic environment
suggests convection will rapidly intensify. Any convection that
remains discrete will pose a risk for very large hail (up to 3.5
inches), tornadoes (a few may be strong), and damaging gusts. With
time, consolidation of thunderstorm clusters is expected and an
organized bow is forecast to move across the OH/TN Valley region.
Intense, damaging gusts greater than 70 kt will be possible once
this occurs.

Additional convection is expected to develop during the evening
ahead of the advancing cold front from northern AR into western
TN/KY. If this activity can remain discrete, supercells will pose an
all-hazards severe risk. Eventually, this activity should become
linear, but will still have an attendant wind/tornado risk, with a
gradual weakening trend during the overnight hours expected across
MS/AL/GA.

...Central Appalachians to Mid-Atlantic...

Thunderstorms may be ongoing Friday morning across parts of PA and
spread east/southeast through early afternoon as a lead upper
shortwave impulse moves across the Northeast. Moistening and heating
ahead of this activity will support moderate to strong
destabilization, especially from the Chesapeake Bay vicinity
southward across the VA/NC Piedmont. The initial round of
thunderstorms may pose a risk for locally strong gusts and hail
before moving offshore the NJ/DE/MD coast during the early
afternoon.

During the evening/overnight hours, a mature bowing MCS is expected
to move over the WV/VA/NC mountains and spread east across the
region, posing a risk for swaths of strong to damaging wind gusts.
Forecast guidance varies in timing and exact evolution of this
system across the region, but portions of the area may need higher
probabilities in subsequent outlooks.

...WI/MI...

Thunderstorms are expected to develop ahead of the surface low and
cold front during the afternoon and evening. Cold temperatures aloft
will support steep midlevel lapse rates and weak to moderate
instability despite more modest boundary layer moisture. Favorable
shear will support organized convection capable of isolated damaging
gusts and hail.

...ArkLaTex vicinity...

A more conditional risk of significant severe thunderstorms will
exist across northeast TX into southern AR/northwest LA. A very
moist and strongly unstable airmass will be in place, and forecast
guidance suggests capping should erode along/ahead of the surface
dryline. Low-level convergence along the surface boundary is not
expected to be strong, and large-scale ascent will be nebulous, with
neutral height tendencies expected. Nevertheless, at least a few
storms are expected to develop during/just after peak heating.
Supercell wind profiles, with long/straight hodographs are apparent
in forecast soundings. Furthermore, thermodynamic profiles will be
very favorable for large hail, while steepening low-level lapse
rates will support strong outflow winds. Isolated significant hail
(to 2.5 inches) is possible in addition to sporadic damaging gusts.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1137 AM CDT Thu May 15 2025

Valid 151700Z - 161200Z

Cooler temperatures and lighter boundary layer winds will mitigate
fire weather concerns across southeastern Arizona today,
necessitating a slight pullback in Elevated highlights. Stronger
mid-level winds and efficient mixing will continue to support an
elevated fire weather threat across southern New Mexico into far
west Texas. Downslope/leeward enhancement of surface winds should 
also occur across the High Plains of northeastern New Mexico.

..Williams.. 05/15/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0104 AM CDT Thu May 15 2025/

...Synopsis...
An upper trough will quickly move eastward over the central US with
accompanying strong mid-level flow. A deepening lee cyclone will
intensify further as it move into the Upper Midwest tonight. As the
low deepens, a Pacific cold front and tailing dryline will move
quickly through the Rockies, into the Plains and Midwest States.
Cooler temperatures, gusty westerly winds and some precipitation are
possible along and behind the front through tonight. Elevated
fire-weather conditions are possible over parts of the southern
Plains and Southwest.

...Southwest...
Persistent westerly flow will continue across the Southwest today
and tonight as a weak pacific front moves over the Rockies. This
will support another day of dry and windy conditions across parts of
eastern AZ and southern NM. Despite somewhat cooler temperatures
behind the front, downsloping  and deep vertical mixing will support
RH below 20% and winds of 15-20% amidst dry fuels. Widespread
elevated to locally critical conditions are expected. Some
fire-weather risk may also extend into West TX behind an eastward
mixing dryline. However, winds here may be somewhat weaker despite
very warm surface temperatures and lower humidity. Locally elevated
conditions are possible within drying fuels.

...Central plains and Midwest...
Gusty westerly winds are possible behind the advancing cold front
from parts of the central Plains into western IA and MO this
afternoon. While gusts may reach 20-25 mph, RH values are not
expected to be critical with cooler temperatures. Additionally,
recent wetting rainfall may temporarily limit available fuels. This
suggests any fire-weather concerns will be localized and short
lived.

Severe thunderstorms are expected across parts of the upper
Mississippi River Valley and Great Lakes this afternoon and evening.
Tornadoes, some of which could be strong, and very large hail and
damaging winds will be possible. Severe thunderstorms are also
expected through the lower Ohio River Valley, Ozarks and in parts of
the Mid-Atlantic.

...Mid to Upper Mississippi Valley/Great Lakes/Ohio Valley...
Recent satellite imagery shows an upper low over SD, with a
negatively tilted shortwave trough moving into the Mid MO Valley.
Surface analysis places an occluded surface low associated with this
system over southeast ND, with an occluded front extending
southeastward to a triple point over far southeast SD. A cold front
extends south-southeastward from this front across far western IA
and into far northeast MO before arcing more southwestward across
far western MO and more southwestward across western OK. A warm
front extends easterward from this triple point across southern MN
and then more southeastward across southwest WI and northern IL.
These boundaries, including the occluded front, will all act in
tandem with increasing large-scale forcing for ascent to force
thunderstorm development this afternoon and evening.

The ongoing storms from eastern SD into central MN are confirmation
of the buoyancy sampled in the 12Z MPX sounding. Expectation is for
instability to build across the region as heating and low-level
moisture advection occur amid steep mid-level lapse rates. Airmass
destabilization and thunderstorm development is anticipated first
from the eastern Dakotas into MN, the occluded front as it shifts
northward as both the primary surface low and triple point low shift
northwestward. Additional development is then anticipated farther
southeast along the warm front across WI. Storms that develop in the
vicinity of the occluded front will likely have elevated structures,
with large hail as the primary risk. Some isolated very large hail
(i.e. greater than 2" in diameter) is possible. Farther southeast,
the corridor along the warm front appears very favorable for
supercells capable of all severe hazards, including very large hail,
strong wind gusts, and tornadoes. A locally higher tornado potential
may exist from  central into southeastern WI from 18Z-22Z. Deeper
mixing is anticipated farther south into northern IL, but the
overall environment will still support robust, organized updrafts.
There may be some trend initially for these storms to quickly become
outflow dominant, but strengthening mid-level flow across the region
after 21Z should aid in maintaining a more organized mode. Upscale
growth into a organized MCS appears probable after 00Z, with the
potential for significant-severe gusts as this line moves eastward
in southern Lower MI. The threat for damaging gusts and isolated
hail will persist throughout the night across Lower MI and the
middle/upper OH Valley.

...Ozarks into the TN Valley...
Additional thunderstorm development is anticipated this afternoon
across AR as a cold front pushes eastward across the region.
Moderate to strong flow aloft should allow for storms to move off
this boundary quickly into a strongly buoyant airmass downstream.
Warm air aloft could limit overall storm longevity during the
afternoon/early evening, but the warm/dry mid-levels are conducive
for producing strong outflows capable of damaging gusts. Whether or
not organization will occur along these outflows is uncertain, but a
conditional risk for continued damaging gusts exists into TN. 

Additional thunderstorms are possible during the evening and
overnight in the wake of the front. Persistent steep mid-level lapse
rates and strong shear will support large hail with some of these
storms.

...Central Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic...  
Large-scale height rises are expected across the region, but
diurnal heating and orographic effects will aid in thunderstorm
development across the higher terrain this afternoon. Northwesterly
flow aloft will favor a southeastward storm motion within an
environment of moderate/locally strong instability. 35-45 kts of
northwesterly deep shear is anticipated, supporting supercell
structures and clusters, posing a risk for large hail and damaging
winds. The overall hodograph structure and resulting storm motion
appears favorable for some very large hail over 2" in diameter as
well.

Mesoscale Discussion 0785
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0723 AM CDT Thu May 15 2025

Areas affected...Southeast SD...southern MN...extreme northeast
NE/northwest IA

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 151223Z - 151400Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A threat for strong to isolated severe storms may continue
through the morning.

DISCUSSION...A long-lived storm cluster is ongoing this morning
across south-central MN. This system has persisted longer than most
guidance would suggest, and is likely being aided by persistent
moisture transport associated with a strong low-level jet. While
this system remains relatively disorganized with outflow tending to
outpace the deeper convection, localized strong wind gusts and hail
will be possible, especially where new updrafts develop and briefly
intensify behind the outflow. 

To the southwest, renewed storm development is underway across
southeast SD and far northeast NE, immediately in advance of a
compact but vigorous midlevel shortwave trough moving across
north-central NE/south-central SD. Rather strong low-level
southeasterly flow will maintain moisture transport into the region
through the morning ahead of a cold front, and development of
somewhat more organized convection will be possible with time. In
the short term, convection will tend to be somewhat elevated, but
could become rooted closer to the surface later this morning,
especially with southeast extent. Some hail and strong-gust
potential could evolve if convection is able to deepen and intensify
within this regime.  

With the threat expected to remain rather isolated over the next 1-2
hours, short-term watch issuance is considered unlikely. Trends will
continue to be monitored for intensification with time this morning.

Mesoscale Discussion 0778
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0307 PM CDT Wed May 14 2025

Areas affected...Southwest into central Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 142007Z - 142200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Large/very-large hail and severe winds will be the primary
threats as storms develop and mature this afternoon and evening.
Supercells on the southern end of the activity may have slightly
higher associated tornado threat. A watch is likely late this
afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Dewpoints have held in the low 60s F in central
Nebraska this afternoon. Cumulus towers and recent lightning have
been observed in Cherry County in the last hour along a surface
boundary. Water vapor imagery shows ascent increasing in Colorado as
a shortwave trough continues to pivot northeastward. This ascent
should reach western/southwestern Nebraska later this afternoon. In
the near term, additional storms appear probable as
heating/convergence continue along the boundary. The eastern
boundary is the most likely zone for initiation, though additional
storms could form on the weaker boundary to the west. With
deep-layer shear having a more westerly component this far south,
which should be maintained/modestly increase as the trough ejects
this evening, a mixed mode of linear segments and supercells can be
expected. Supercells will be favored with southern extent.

Modestly steep mid-level lapse rates and increasing shear by the
evening will support organized storms capable of large/very-large
hail (particularly supercells) and severe winds. While the low-level
jet response this evening is not expected to be overly strong, a
supercell along the southern flank of the activity may have slightly
higher tornado potential.

A watch is likely by late afternoon. Timing of watch issuance is
somewhat uncertain given greater storm coverage may wait until
greater mid-level ascent arrives by 22-00Z.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 247
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
350 PM CDT Wed May 14 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Western and Central Nebraska
  South-Central and Central South Dakota

* Effective this Wednesday afternoon and evening from 350 PM
  until 1100 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 75
    mph possible
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 3
    inches in diameter possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms should continue to gradually increase in
coverage and intensity this afternoon and evening. Supercells should
pose a threat for large to very large hail potentially up to 2-3
inches in diameter, especially across parts of western into central
Nebraska. Otherwise, scattered severe wind gusts may occur with any
clusters that eventually form. A tornado or two also appears
possible, mainly this evening.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 45
statute miles east and west of a line from 35 miles north of Pierre
SD to 25 miles east southeast of Imperial NE. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU7).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
3 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 65 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
20030.

Mesoscale Discussion 0774
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0746 AM CDT Tue May 13 2025

Areas affected...Parts of eastern NC into southeast VA

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 131246Z - 131445Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A localized brief-tornado and wind-damage threat may
persist through the morning.

DISCUSSION...Extensive convection is ongoing this morning across
eastern NC into southeast VA. Weak instability (MLCAPE generally 500
J/kg or less) is limiting updraft intensity, with lightning
primarily confined to somewhat deeper convection near the NC coast.
However, to the east of the slow-moving midlevel cyclone centered
over western TN/KY, rather strong low-level flow continues to be
noted on the KMHX and KAKQ VWPs, supporting effective SRH of 150-200
m2/s2. Small cells with occasional rotation have persisted from
northeast NC into far southeast VA, and some localized threat for a
brief tornado and wind damage could persist through the morning with
these smaller cells. 

Farther south, an extensive convective cluster is ongoing off the NC
coast, with some evidence of an MCV south of Morehead City. This
cluster could spread northward toward the immediate coast and Outer
Banks with time, with embedded cells potentially posing a threat of
strong gusts and a brief tornado, especially where surface dewpoints
remain near 70 F this morning.

Mesoscale Discussion 0765
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0139 PM CDT Sun May 11 2025

Areas affected...eastern Idaho into western Wyoming and southwest
Montana

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 111839Z - 112115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Storms should gradually increase in coverage and intensity
from eastern Idaho into southwest Montana, with both hail and gust
potential.

DISCUSSION...A line of convection continue to increase in intensity
over the upper Snake River Plain, with both strong heating and
low-level warm advection ahead of it. Continued steepening of
deep-layer lapse rates as the upper trough moves in the from the
west and more heating should support further strengthening of this
convection. Strong deep-layer shear will favor hail production with
these storms over eastern ID. A brief/weak tornado cannot be ruled
out with the stronger cells this afternoon, as low-level stretching
is maximized.

Farther north toward the Bitterroots, stronger cooling aloft is
occurring, and areas of heating persist ahead of this activity as
well. Long hodographs and cold midlevel temperatures will favor hail
with these storms through the day.

Mesoscale Discussion 0767
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0221 PM CDT Sun May 11 2025

Areas affected...central Florida northward toward southeast Georgia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 111921Z - 112145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Storms are forecast to increase in coverage throughout the
afternoon from the central Florida Peninsula into northeast Florida
and southeast Georgia.

DISCUSSION...Storms are currently increasing east of Tampa to west
of Okeechobee where strong heating has led to strong instability.
The southerly flow regime should support a north/northeast movement
to this development, affecting the remainder of central into
northeastern Florida. Breaks in the clouds in those downstream areas
are developing, and this should further increase instability.
Although temperatures aloft are not as cool as previous days, MUCAPE
over 2000 J/kg and deep-layer shear of 35-40 kt will support
cellular storm mode with sporadic hail > 1.00" expected. Locally
strong to damaging gusts cannot be ruled out as well, especially
with any merging outflows.

  Eastern Idaho
  Northern Utah
  Western Wyoming

* Effective this Sunday afternoon and evening from 110 PM until
  800 PM MDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 80
    mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm intensity and coverage is expected to
increase this afternoon across eastern ID, northern UT, and western
WY. Environmental conditions support the potential for strong to
severe storms capable of strong gusts. Isolated large hail is also
possible, particularly in areas of higher terrain.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 80
statute miles east and west of a line from 65 miles north northeast
of Idaho Falls ID to 40 miles southwest of Salt Lake City UT. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU5).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.

0149 PM CDT Sun May 11 2025

Areas affected...Portions of southeast Georgia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 111849Z - 112045Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A locally greater risk for damaging winds and perhaps a
tornado is evident in southeast Georgia near a local warm front
feature.

DISCUSSION...A small corridor in southeast Georgia has heated into
the low 80s F. A few weak discrete cells exist near the
Georgia/South Carolina state line. One cell has recently intensified
and shown signs of low-level rotation. The localized warm front
feature will promote at least marginal potential for a brief tornado
with southeasterly winds near the boundary. Nearby KCLX radar
accordingly shows modest 0-1 km SRH. Over the next hour or two this
environment will support a locally greater risk for damaging winds
and perhaps a tornado. The discrete cells will have the greatest
potential, but stronger updrafts within the linear segment farther
southwest could also acquire low-level rotation as well.

Mesoscale Discussion 0764
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0130 PM CDT Sun May 11 2025

Areas affected...Salt Lake Vicinity

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 111830Z - 112030Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Severe wind gusts will be possible this afternoon with
high-based showers and embedded thunderstorms.

DISCUSSION...With temperatures rising into the low/mid 80s F in the
vicinity of Salt Lake, high-based showers and isolated thunderstorms
have deepened over the last hour. A few of these storms have
produced 58-63 mph measured gusts in Tooele/Salt Lake Counties.
While low-level wind fields are not overly strong, the 9.2 C/km
700-500 mb lapse rate observed in this mornings 12Z SLC sounding,
coupled with steep low-level lapse rates and high surface dewpoint
depressions, will continue to support strong diabatically driven
downdrafts. Severe wind gusts will remain possible through the
afternoon in association with this weak, disorganized convection.
