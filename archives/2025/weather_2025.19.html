Mesoscale Discussion 0778
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0307 PM CDT Wed May 14 2025

Areas affected...Southwest into central Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 142007Z - 142200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Large/very-large hail and severe winds will be the primary
threats as storms develop and mature this afternoon and evening.
Supercells on the southern end of the activity may have slightly
higher associated tornado threat. A watch is likely late this
afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Dewpoints have held in the low 60s F in central
Nebraska this afternoon. Cumulus towers and recent lightning have
been observed in Cherry County in the last hour along a surface
boundary. Water vapor imagery shows ascent increasing in Colorado as
a shortwave trough continues to pivot northeastward. This ascent
should reach western/southwestern Nebraska later this afternoon. In
the near term, additional storms appear probable as
heating/convergence continue along the boundary. The eastern
boundary is the most likely zone for initiation, though additional
storms could form on the weaker boundary to the west. With
deep-layer shear having a more westerly component this far south,
which should be maintained/modestly increase as the trough ejects
this evening, a mixed mode of linear segments and supercells can be
expected. Supercells will be favored with southern extent.

Modestly steep mid-level lapse rates and increasing shear by the
evening will support organized storms capable of large/very-large
hail (particularly supercells) and severe winds. While the low-level
jet response this evening is not expected to be overly strong, a
supercell along the southern flank of the activity may have slightly
higher tornado potential.

A watch is likely by late afternoon. Timing of watch issuance is
somewhat uncertain given greater storm coverage may wait until
greater mid-level ascent arrives by 22-00Z.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 247
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
350 PM CDT Wed May 14 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Western and Central Nebraska
  South-Central and Central South Dakota

* Effective this Wednesday afternoon and evening from 350 PM
  until 1100 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 75
    mph possible
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 3
    inches in diameter possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms should continue to gradually increase in
coverage and intensity this afternoon and evening. Supercells should
pose a threat for large to very large hail potentially up to 2-3
inches in diameter, especially across parts of western into central
Nebraska. Otherwise, scattered severe wind gusts may occur with any
clusters that eventually form. A tornado or two also appears
possible, mainly this evening.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 45
statute miles east and west of a line from 35 miles north of Pierre
SD to 25 miles east southeast of Imperial NE. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU7).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
3 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 65 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
20030.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0253 PM CDT Wed May 14 2025

Valid 151200Z - 161200Z

Elevated highlights were extended into northeast New Mexico,
accounting for expected enhanced downslope west winds within a
cooler, but still very dry air mass where relative humidity could
fall to around 10 percent Thursday afternoon. Otherwise, forecast
(see below) remains on track.

..Williams.. 05/14/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0157 AM CDT Wed May 14 2025/

...Synopsis...
The upper trough over the western US will eject quickly eastward
spreading strong mid-level flow atop the central Plains. A powerful
lee cyclone will intensify further as it move into the Upper
Midwest. A cold front and tailing dryline may support precipitation
across parts of the Plains and Midwest States. Otherwise, dry and
breezy conditions behind these features will favor some fire-weather
risk.

...Southwest...
Persistent westerly flow will continue across the Southwest
Thursday. This will support another day of dry and windy conditions
across parts of eastern AZ and southern NM. RH below 20% and winds
of 15-20% amidst dry fuels will support widespread elevated to
locally critical conditions. Some fire-weather risk may also extend
into West TX behind an eastward mixing dryline. However, winds here
may be somewhat weaker despite very warm surface temperatures and
lower humidity. Locally elevated conditions are possible within
drying fuels.

...Central Plains...
As the strong surface low continues to deepen and shift eastward
over the northern Plains and Midwest, a cold front will approach the
central Plains Thursday/Thursday night. This could support some dry
and breezy conditions behind the front within receptive fuels.
Westerly gusts of 15-20 mph and RH below 25% could support elevated
fire-weather conditions. However, some potential for rainfall in the
preceding days may temporarily limit fuels. The relatively confined
area and uncertainties on precipitation will preclude any highlights
for now.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0244 PM CDT Wed May 14 2025

Valid 142000Z - 151200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS PARTS OF THE
NORTHERN/CENTRAL PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong to severe thunderstorms should occur over parts of
the Dakotas and Nebraska this afternoon and evening, and far western
Iowa and southwest Minnesota overnight. Very large hail, severe wind
gusts, and a couple of tornadoes all appear possible.

...20z Update...
No changes are needed to the D1 Convective Outlook.

Severe storms are expected across the northern/central Plains this
afternoon and evening as an upper low moves eastward with a surface
cold front. Latest data from 18z RAOBs across Nebraska shows weak
mid-level capping still in place across the area near North Platte,
which much stronger MLCIN further east near Omaha. Ongoing elevated
post frontal convection will continue before further convective
development occurs later this afternoon and evening. These storms
will have potential for very large hail, damaging wind, and a couple
of tornadoes. See MCD#777 for more information on this threat in the
near term.

See previous discussion for more information below.

..Thornton/Gleason.. 05/14/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1128 AM CDT Wed May 14 2025/

...Northern/Central Plains...
An upper trough over the western states will pivot eastward today
while gradually acquiring a negative tilt over the northern/central
Plains by late tonight. At the surface, a front extending over the
Dakotas should stall in a nearly north-south orientation later
today. Shallow low-level moisture will continue to stream northward
this afternoon ahead of the primary surface low, which is forecast
to consolidate over western KS/southwest NE by early evening. A
dryline will extend southward from this low over much of the
central/southern Plains, but strong capping should generally limit
convective development with southward extent through much of the
day.

Daytime heating of the modestly moist low-level airmass, combined
with somewhat steepened mid-level lapse rates, will encourage around
1500-3000 J/kg of MLCAPE by mid afternoon. Stronger instability will
likely exist with southward extent into NE, where slightly greater
low-level moisture should be present. Mainly unidirectional/
southerly wind profiles along/near the front this afternoon suggest
that initial convective development will be messy, with numerous
updraft and outflow interactions. Still, the strongest of these
initial cores should pose some risk for hail and wind gusts.

Initially high-based convection is also forecast to develop across
the central High Plains (northeast CO vicinity) by late
afternoon/early evening, and spread northeastward across NE. A
greater threat for sustained supercells remains apparent with
southward extent across NE this evening, where stronger deep-layer
shear somewhat more orthogonal to the surface boundaries should be
present. Isolated very large hail (up to 2-3 inches in diameter)
will be possible with any discrete cells, while severe wind gusts
should become an increasing concern as convection grows upscale into
a bowing cluster through the evening and early overnight hours.
There should also be a narrow spatial/temporal window for a couple
of tornadoes this evening across parts of NE as a low-level jet
modestly strengthens and 0-1 km SRH increases.

...Southeast and Southern Mid-Atlantic into the Ohio Valley...
A weak mid/upper trough will drift eastward today from the
Appalachians towards the Carolinas and Mid-Atlantic. While mid-level
winds and related effective bulk shear are expected to remain rather
weak, some clustering/modest organization may occur with convection
that will further develop this afternoon across NC into parts of
southern VA. Occasional damaging winds should be the main threat
with this activity as low-level lapse rates gradually steepen with
continued diurnal heating. But, some hail may also occur. See
Mesoscale Discussion 776 for more details on the short-term severe
threat across this area.

Across parts of the OH Valley, mainly elevated thunderstorms are
forecast to develop this evening/overnight in a low-level warm
advection regime. Sufficient MUCAPE and deep-layer shear is forecast
to support an isolated threat for mainly large hail with this
activity.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0232 PM CDT Wed May 14 2025

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS SOUTHEAST
MISSOURI...SOUTHERN ILLINOIS/INDIANA...SOUTHWEST OHIO...AND PORTIONS
OF WESTERN TO NORTHERN KENTUCKY...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are expected across the Middle Mississippi and
Ohio Valley region Friday afternoon and evening. All-severe hazards
are possible with this activity. More isolated severe thunderstorms
will extend southwestward into northeast Texas, and northeast into
the Mid-Atlantic.

...Mid-South/Ohio Valley vicinity...

An upper trough over the southern High Plains will pivot quickly
east/northeast across the Midwest on Friday. As this occurs, strong
mid/upper southwesterly flow will overspread the region, with a 500
mb jet around 70-90 kt forecast. At the surface, A very moist
airmass will be in place from southern MO into southern IL and
northeast into OH. Increasing southerly low-level flow ahead of a
surface cold front will allow a warm front, roughly along the I-70
corridor at mid-morning, to lift north toward the northern IL/IN/OH
through the afternoon. Cooling aloft will result in steep midlevel
lapse rates atop the mid/upper 60s F dewpoint surface warm sector,
resulting in strong destabilization. 

A low-level jet around 45-65 kt is forecast to overspread the region
from peak heating into the evening, coincident with increasing
large-scale ascent. Both the eastward-advancing cold front/dryline
across MO, and the warm front vicinity will be a focus for
convective initiation. One or more bowing clusters is possible, in
addition to more discrete supercells. Given vertically veering
supercells wind profiles, significant severe storms appear possible
-- with a risk for all hazards accompanying this activity, including
very large hail, tornadoes, and intense wind gusts. The southward
extent of highest severe potential is a bit uncertain given
orientation of surface boundaries and potential overnight convection
in the Day 2/Thursday time period impacting parts of the KY
vicinity.

Eventually, a northeast to southwest line of storms will likely
congeal during the late evening/nighttime hours and sag southward
across KY into the TN Valley, with a gradually lessening severe risk
with southward extent during the overnight hours.

...TX into OK/AR...

With southwest extent, severe potential is a bit more
uncertain/conditional. Some minor height rises may occur across TX
and the into AR during the late afternoon/evening. Large-scale
ascent will be weaker and any capping may be more difficult to
overcome. Nevertheless, a very moist and unstable airmass will be in
place amid supercell wind profiles. If storms can develop, very
large hail and strong gusts will be possible. 

...Mid-Atlantic Vicinity...

Convection may be ongoing in a warm advection regime Friday morning
as a weak shortwave impulse moves across the region through
afternoon. Moderate mid/upper flow will support effective shear
magnitudes around 25-35 kt, and be sufficient for some organized
convection. Pockets of stronger heating downstream from morning
activity will allow for weak to moderate destabilization. Isolated
strong to severe storms producing hail and gusty winds will be
possible.

1236 PM CDT Wed May 14 2025

Valid 151200Z - 161200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM
EAST-CENTRAL MINNESOTA INTO MUCH OF WISCONSIN...NORTHEAST
ILLINOIS...SOUTHWEST LOWER MICHIGAN...AND NORTHERN INDIANA...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are expected across parts of the upper
Mississippi River Valley and Great Lakes region Thursday afternoon
and evening. The primary risk with this activity is large to very
large hail, tornadoes (a couple may be strong), and scattered wind
damage. 

More isolated severe thunderstorms are expected through the lower
Ohio River Valley, Ozarks Plateau, and parts of the Mid-Atlantic.

...Synopsis...

An upper cyclone centered over the Dakotas, and attendant
negative-tilt shortwave trough will deepen and spread northeast
across the Upper Midwest on Thursday. A belt of enhanced mid/upper
southwesterly flow will overspread the region, with a secondary jet
streak oriented from the southern Plains to the Ohio Valley. 

At the surface, low pressure is forecast over eastern SD during the
morning. The deepening surface low will lift north/northeast into
northern MN through much of the forecast period. As this occurs, a
warm front arcing southeast from the low to the Ohio Valley will
lift northward during the afternoon and into the evening. This will
allow a moist warm sector to lift northward across the Upper MS
Valley and Great Lakes vicinity. Extending south from the surface
low, a dryline will be in place from the Mid-MO valley into eastern
OK and central TX. This feature will develop east/northeast across
MN/WI/IA/MO/IL through the evening. 

Severe thunderstorm activity is expected near the triple point, and
along the warm front and dryline (where a capping inversion is able
to be overcome). 

...Upper Midwest/Great Lakes vicinity...

Convection will likely be ongoing Thursday morning near the surface
low and beneath the upper low. Cold temperatures aloft will support
steepened midlevel lapse rates within modest boundary layer moisture
across the eastern Dakotas. Hail will be possible with this
activity. Supercell wind profiles are also expected into late
morning, and additional low-topped convection may develop from late
morning into early afternoon, posing a risk of hail, gusty winds and
a tornado or two across the eastern Dakotas.

By afternoon, mid-60s F dewpoints are expected within a somewhat
narrow warm sector from central MN southeast into WI and northern
IL. As large-scale ascent increases, thunderstorms are expected to
develop in an arc from east-central MN into southeast WI on the nose
of a 40-50 kt low-level jet and midlevel dry slot. Vertically
veering winds will produce supercell wind profiles. Low-level
hodographs will become enlarged, in part due to the increasing
low-level jet, but also within the warm front zone. Additionally,
steep midlevel lapse rates and MLCAPE greater than 2500 J/kg are
possible. This should support robust updrafts and rapidly increasing
storm intensity once initiation occurs. Large to very large hail (up
to 3 inch diameter) and tornadoes (a couple may be strong) appear
possible within the moisture-rich, favorably sheared warm sector.
Given strong 850-700 mb flow and steepening low-level lapse rates
where strong heating occurs, severe gust potential is also expected.
Current thinking is that given the orthogonal nature of low-level
flow to the surface boundaries, supercell storm mode may be favored,
with perhaps a trend toward bowing segment during the evening. A
gust to 80 mph cannot be ruled out, but given uncertainty in storm
mode transitioning to or favoring linear segments have held off on
adding a sig-wind delineation. 

The bands of severe storms should develop northeast with time into
the evening, with a gradual weakening trend expected across Upper
and Lower MI.

...Northern IL/IN into OH/PA vicinity...

Storm coverage is more uncertain with southward extent due to
increasing capping in the 850-700 mb layer, and weaker large-scale
ascent. Nevertheless, isolated to widely scattered storms are
expected to develop during the afternoon in a strongly unstable and
moderately sheared environment. Supercells producing large hail, a
couple of tornadoes and damaging gusts will be possible into the
evening hours across IL/IN. Additional activity is expected to
develop in the low-level warm advection regime during the
evening/overnight hours across portions of OH/western PA. This
activity may remain elevated, but would still pose a risk for hail,
or perhaps isolated gusty winds if clustering occurs.

...Ozarks to Mid-South/Ohio Valley...
Further south from southeast MO/southern IL into KY, modest height
falls are forecast during the evening/overnight hours. This may be
sufficient to either overcome capping, or to allow elevated
convection to develop. Severe storms capable of damaging gusts,large
hail and a tornado or two appear possible, though this risk is a bit
more uncertain/conditional and coverage may be low.

...Mid-Atlantic...

A moist, weakly capped air mass is expected to remain in place
across the Mid-Atlantic through Thursday afternoon. While lapse
rates will be modest after several days of convective overturning,
temperatures warming into the upper 70s/low 80s will promote
sufficient buoyancy for thunderstorm development. Upper ridging
moving into the region will likely limit thunderstorm coverage, but
convection developing along the Blue Ridge Mountains will mature in
an environment with increasing deep-layer shear. A few organized
cells appear possible with an attendant severe hail/wind threat.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EASTERN ARIZONA...SOUTHERN/CENTRAL
NEW MEXICO AND FAR WEST TEXAS...

Despite cooler temperatures behind a cold front moving through New
Mexico, a very dry post frontal air mass along with strong southwest
winds will support Critical fire weather conditions across portions
of central and southern New Mexico into far West Texas through
today. Latest model guidance consensus shows a corridor of sustained
southwest winds of 25-35 mph from southwest New Mexico with
downslope wind enhancement extending into leeward sides of the
Sandia-Manzano and Sacramento Mountains. These winds combined with
drying fuels and relative humidity dropping into the 10-15 percent
range this afternoon supported a slight northeastward extension of
Critical highlights into east-central New Mexico.

..Williams.. 05/14/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0156 AM CDT Wed May 14 2025/

...Synopsis...
A broad upper trough over the western US is forecast to deepen as it
moves eastward over the central US. A lee low and dryline will
strengthen over the Plains, supporting dry and breezy conditions
over much of the western and central CONUS. While strong southerly
winds are also possible ahead of the deepening surface low,
returning surface moisture and precipitation chances are also
expected, complicating some fire-weather potential. Critical
fire-weather conditions appear most likely over parts of the
Southwest.

...Southwest...
Moderate mid-level flow at the base of the ejecting upper-trough
will support westerly downslope winds of 20-25 mph across parts of
the Southwest this afternoon and evening. A very dry surface pattern
is expected to continue with above normal temperatures and little
recent rainfall. This should support widespread RH below 15%. With
sufficient fuels in place, and additional drying expected, several
hours of critical fire-weather conditions are likely over
southeastern AZ into southern NM and west TX.

...Central and Northern Plains...
A strong lee low with a trailing dryline will gradually deepen as
the upper trough begins to move over the Plains. Dry downslope flow
is possible over parts of the central/northern Plains into the Upper
Midwest behind the strengthening dryline. With RH minimums below 30%
and wind gusting to 20 mph, some elevated fire-weather threat may be
possible across parts of CO/KS and NE into the Dakotas and western
MN. However, the strongest meteorological conditions are not
expected to overlap with areas of supportive fuels given past
rainfall and additional rain through the period. Increasing surface
moisture may also limit any appreciable overlap. This will favor a
more localized threat with only isolated elevated fire-weather
conditions expected.

1128 AM CDT Wed May 14 2025

Valid 141630Z - 151200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE NORTHERN/CENTRAL PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong to severe thunderstorms should occur over parts of
the Dakotas and Nebraska this afternoon and evening, and far western
Iowa and southwest Minnesota overnight. Very large hail, severe wind
gusts, and a couple of tornadoes all appear possible.

...Northern/Central Plains...
An upper trough over the western states will pivot eastward today
while gradually acquiring a negative tilt over the northern/central
Plains by late tonight. At the surface, a front extending over the
Dakotas should stall in a nearly north-south orientation later
today. Shallow low-level moisture will continue to stream northward
this afternoon ahead of the primary surface low, which is forecast
to consolidate over western KS/southwest NE by early evening. A
dryline will extend southward from this low over much of the
central/southern Plains, but strong capping should generally limit
convective development with southward extent through much of the
day.

Daytime heating of the modestly moist low-level airmass, combined
with somewhat steepened mid-level lapse rates, will encourage around
1500-3000 J/kg of MLCAPE by mid afternoon. Stronger instability will
likely exist with southward extent into NE, where slightly greater
low-level moisture should be present. Mainly unidirectional/
southerly wind profiles along/near the front this afternoon suggest
that initial convective development will be messy, with numerous
updraft and outflow interactions. Still, the strongest of these
initial cores should pose some risk for hail and wind gusts.

Initially high-based convection is also forecast to develop across
the central High Plains (northeast CO vicinity) by late
afternoon/early evening, and spread northeastward across NE. A
greater threat for sustained supercells remains apparent with
southward extent across NE this evening, where stronger deep-layer
shear somewhat more orthogonal to the surface boundaries should be
present. Isolated very large hail (up to 2-3 inches in diameter)
will be possible with any discrete cells, while severe wind gusts
should become an increasing concern as convection grows upscale into
a bowing cluster through the evening and early overnight hours.
There should also be a narrow spatial/temporal window for a couple
of tornadoes this evening across parts of NE as a low-level jet
modestly strengthens and 0-1 km SRH increases.

...Southeast and Southern Mid-Atlantic into the Ohio Valley...
A weak mid/upper trough will drift eastward today from the
Appalachians towards the Carolinas and Mid-Atlantic. While mid-level
winds and related effective bulk shear are expected to remain rather
weak, some clustering/modest organization may occur with convection
that will further develop this afternoon across NC into parts of
southern VA. Occasional damaging winds should be the main threat
with this activity as low-level lapse rates gradually steepen with
continued diurnal heating. But, some hail may also occur. See
Mesoscale Discussion 776 for more details on the short-term severe
threat across this area.

Across parts of the OH Valley, mainly elevated thunderstorms are
forecast to develop this evening/overnight in a low-level warm
advection regime. Sufficient MUCAPE and deep-layer shear is forecast
to support an isolated threat for mainly large hail with this
activity.

Valid 141300Z - 151200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PORTIONS OF
THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong to severe thunderstorms are possible mainly over
parts of the Dakotas and Nebraska this afternoon and evening, and
far western Iowa and southwest Minnesota overnight. A few strong to
severe storms may occur from parts of the southern Appalachians to
the Carolinas and Mid-Atlantic this afternoon.

...Northern/Central Plains...
Surface low pressure will deepen in the vicinity of the CO/KS/NE
border today in response to the approach of an upper-level trough,
as an associated surface cold front moves slowly east across the
central/northern Plains. Low-level moisture advection and steep
mid-level lapse rates (in excess of 8 deg C/km) will result in
MLCAPE of 2500-3000 J/kg across central NE, with weaker instability
northward across the central Dakotas. Thunderstorm development is
expected by late afternoon near the front across the Dakotas and
central/northern NE, with severe hail and wind the primary risks.
Damaging winds will become more likely as one or two clusters
ultimately evolve over central/northern NE and move towards
southeast SD/southwest MN and far northwest IA during the late
evening and overnight.

Across southwest/central NE, more discrete supercell structures will
be possible with storms developing closer to the surface low/dryline
intersection, with large to very large hail possible. A 5 percent
tornado probability has been introduced across portions of central
NE, where a short-duration window may exist for a couple of
tornadoes this evening with any semi-discrete storm or small cluster
in the presence of increasing low-level shear. Expected upscale
growth should limit the time frame for supercell tornado potential. 


...Southern Appalachians into the Carolinas and Mid-Atlantic...
Weak to moderate instability will develop from the southern 
Appalachians to the Carolinas Wednesday. As a mid-level shortwave
trough overspreads the region, scattered thunderstorms are expected
to develop. Sufficient shear of 25 to 30 knots will support some
storm organization including potential for transient supercell
structures. Modestly steep mid-level lapse rates should support the
potential for large hail and perhaps isolated damaging wind gusts.

...DISCUSSION...
An active period of severe weather remains likely through the
weekend and into early next week for portions of the central CONUS.
A weakening upper trough is forecast to migrate across the Northeast
late this weekend as a second upper wave begins to amplify over the
western states. This upper regime will favor surface pressure falls
across the High Plains that will promote south/southeasterly return
flow into the southern/central Plains through early next week.
Severe thunderstorm chances will increase as preceding upper
disturbances and the primary upper wave eject into the Plains over
the warm sector. While severe weather chances are anticipated most
days through the extended period, confidence in more focused,
synoptically-driven corridors is currently greatest on D5/Sunday and
D6/Monday across the southern Plains.

...D5/Sunday to D6/Monday...
Increasing southwesterly flow aloft over the southern/central
Rockies will promote lee cyclogenesis across the central High Plains
beginning D4/Saturday through D7/Monday. This will foster moisture
return into northern TX, OK, and southern KS as a warm front lifts
north. Long-range ensemble guidance suggests dewpoints ranging from
the mid 60s to low 70s are likely by Sunday afternoon across the
southern High Plains to the east of a sharpening dryline. Recent
GFS/GEFS solutions have come into better alignment with ECMWF/EPS
runs that depict a leading impulse within the subtropical jet
overspreading the southern High Plains late Sunday afternoon.
Enhanced westerly low- to mid-level flow coupled with ascent
associated with the upper feature should promote eastward mixing of
the dryline with attendant chances for thunderstorm development
within a buoyant and strongly sheared environment. 

The ejection of the primary trough axis on D6/Monday should result
in more widespread 50+ knot mid-level flow overspreading much of
OK/KS. The eastward migration of the surface low and trailing
dryline through the day should provide adequate forcing for ascent
for thunderstorm development within a buoyant and strongly sheared
environment, which should promote an organized, and potentially more
widespread, severe threat. 

More specific mesoscale details for both days remain unclear at this
range, but the general alignment of global deterministic/ensemble
guidance regarding the overall synoptic regime and convective
environment, combined with a consistent QPF signal on both days,
suggests predictability is high enough to introduce risk
probabilities.

...D4/Saturday...
A residual cold front associated with a weakening surface low over
the northern CONUS is expected to be draped from the southern
Appalachians southwestward into the mid-MS Valley/Ozark Plateau
region. Sufficient buoyancy and strong zonal flow aloft will likely
support organized convection along the frontal zone. While some
severe threat is anticipated, mid-level ridging and lingering
convection at the start of the day limit confidence/predictability
in where the better mesoscale corridors for severe convection will
become established. 

...D7/Tuesday...
Some severe threat is expected to persist into Tuesday as a surface
low and attendant trough/dryline migrate east towards the Midwest.
Ensemble guidance hints at strong/severe thunderstorm potential
across parts of AR, MO, and the lower OH Valley, but spread among
deterministic solutions and the potential for lingering convection
from D6/Monday limits confidence at this range.

0746 AM CDT Tue May 13 2025

Areas affected...Parts of eastern NC into southeast VA

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 131246Z - 131445Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A localized brief-tornado and wind-damage threat may
persist through the morning.

DISCUSSION...Extensive convection is ongoing this morning across
eastern NC into southeast VA. Weak instability (MLCAPE generally 500
J/kg or less) is limiting updraft intensity, with lightning
primarily confined to somewhat deeper convection near the NC coast.
However, to the east of the slow-moving midlevel cyclone centered
over western TN/KY, rather strong low-level flow continues to be
noted on the KMHX and KAKQ VWPs, supporting effective SRH of 150-200
m2/s2. Small cells with occasional rotation have persisted from
northeast NC into far southeast VA, and some localized threat for a
brief tornado and wind damage could persist through the morning with
these smaller cells. 

Farther south, an extensive convective cluster is ongoing off the NC
coast, with some evidence of an MCV south of Morehead City. This
cluster could spread northward toward the immediate coast and Outer
Banks with time, with embedded cells potentially posing a threat of
strong gusts and a brief tornado, especially where surface dewpoints
remain near 70 F this morning.

Areas affected...eastern Idaho into western Wyoming and southwest
Montana

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 111839Z - 112115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Storms should gradually increase in coverage and intensity
from eastern Idaho into southwest Montana, with both hail and gust
potential.

DISCUSSION...A line of convection continue to increase in intensity
over the upper Snake River Plain, with both strong heating and
low-level warm advection ahead of it. Continued steepening of
deep-layer lapse rates as the upper trough moves in the from the
west and more heating should support further strengthening of this
convection. Strong deep-layer shear will favor hail production with
these storms over eastern ID. A brief/weak tornado cannot be ruled
out with the stronger cells this afternoon, as low-level stretching
is maximized.

Farther north toward the Bitterroots, stronger cooling aloft is
occurring, and areas of heating persist ahead of this activity as
well. Long hodographs and cold midlevel temperatures will favor hail
with these storms through the day.

Areas affected...central Florida northward toward southeast Georgia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 111921Z - 112145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Storms are forecast to increase in coverage throughout the
afternoon from the central Florida Peninsula into northeast Florida
and southeast Georgia.

DISCUSSION...Storms are currently increasing east of Tampa to west
of Okeechobee where strong heating has led to strong instability.
The southerly flow regime should support a north/northeast movement
to this development, affecting the remainder of central into
northeastern Florida. Breaks in the clouds in those downstream areas
are developing, and this should further increase instability.
Although temperatures aloft are not as cool as previous days, MUCAPE
over 2000 J/kg and deep-layer shear of 35-40 kt will support
cellular storm mode with sporadic hail > 1.00" expected. Locally
strong to damaging gusts cannot be ruled out as well, especially
with any merging outflows.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 245
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
110 PM MDT Sun May 11 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Eastern Idaho
  Northern Utah
  Western Wyoming

* Effective this Sunday afternoon and evening from 110 PM until
  800 PM MDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 80
    mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm intensity and coverage is expected to
increase this afternoon across eastern ID, northern UT, and western
WY. Environmental conditions support the potential for strong to
severe storms capable of strong gusts. Isolated large hail is also
possible, particularly in areas of higher terrain.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 80
statute miles east and west of a line from 65 miles north northeast
of Idaho Falls ID to 40 miles southwest of Salt Lake City UT. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU5).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 70 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
23035.

Mesoscale Discussion 0766
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0149 PM CDT Sun May 11 2025

Areas affected...Portions of southeast Georgia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 111849Z - 112045Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A locally greater risk for damaging winds and perhaps a
tornado is evident in southeast Georgia near a local warm front
feature.

DISCUSSION...A small corridor in southeast Georgia has heated into
the low 80s F. A few weak discrete cells exist near the
Georgia/South Carolina state line. One cell has recently intensified
and shown signs of low-level rotation. The localized warm front
feature will promote at least marginal potential for a brief tornado
with southeasterly winds near the boundary. Nearby KCLX radar
accordingly shows modest 0-1 km SRH. Over the next hour or two this
environment will support a locally greater risk for damaging winds
and perhaps a tornado. The discrete cells will have the greatest
potential, but stronger updrafts within the linear segment farther
southwest could also acquire low-level rotation as well.

Mesoscale Discussion 0764
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0130 PM CDT Sun May 11 2025

Areas affected...Salt Lake Vicinity

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 111830Z - 112030Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Severe wind gusts will be possible this afternoon with
high-based showers and embedded thunderstorms.

DISCUSSION...With temperatures rising into the low/mid 80s F in the
vicinity of Salt Lake, high-based showers and isolated thunderstorms
have deepened over the last hour. A few of these storms have
produced 58-63 mph measured gusts in Tooele/Salt Lake Counties.
While low-level wind fields are not overly strong, the 9.2 C/km
700-500 mb lapse rate observed in this mornings 12Z SLC sounding,
coupled with steep low-level lapse rates and high surface dewpoint
depressions, will continue to support strong diabatically driven
downdrafts. Severe wind gusts will remain possible through the
afternoon in association with this weak, disorganized convection.
