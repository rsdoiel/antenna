Mesoscale Discussion 0794
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0322 PM CDT Thu May 15 2025

Areas affected...Parts of central and northern Illinois

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 152022Z - 152215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Large to very large hail and severe winds will be possible
with supercells that can develop later this afternoon. Watch timing
is uncertain but is possible later this afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Cumulus are developing along an eastward moving dryline
near the Mississippi River. Ahead of this boundary, a strongly
unstable airmass is in place (low 90s F temperatures and mid 60s to
low 70s F dewpoints). With the strongest mid-level ascent to the
northwest of the region, timing of storm initiation as well as storm
coverage are uncertain. However, given the lack of MLCIN, a isolated
to widely scattered development appears possible later this
afternoon. 45-55 kts of effective shear will support supercells. The
primary hazards will be large to very large hail and severe winds.
The tornado threat is expected to be less than farther north given
the slightly veered low-level winds and more sizable
temperature/dewpoint spreads at the surface.

Mesoscale Discussion 0793
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0307 PM CDT Thu May 15 2025

Areas affected...portions of central Arkansas into western
Tennessee...far southeast Missouri...far southwestern Kentucky

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 252...

Valid 152007Z - 152130Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 252
continues.

SUMMARY...Ongoing storms may still reach severe limits, with
damaging gusts and large hail the main concerns. These storms may
persist downstream of Severe Thunderstorm Watch 252, so a local
extension of the ongoing watch, or the issuance of a new downstream
Severe Thunderstorm Watch, may be needed.

DISCUSSION...Strong thunderstorms (still possibly elevated) continue
across AR amid a pronounced EML atop rich low-level moisture and
strong deep-layer shear. As such, any storm cores that can intensify
will continue to pose at least a severe hail threat. Severe gusts
are also possible if ongoing storms can become surface based by
either rooting into the boundary layer, or establishing a strong
cold pool, which could lift surface-based parcels to the LFC along
the cold pool leading edge. It remains uncertain if these storms
have peaked in intensity or if greater severe potential exists
downstream. As such, an eastward extension of the ongoing Severe
Thunderstorm Watch, or the issuance of a new watch, may be needed
pending favorable convective trends.

Mesoscale Discussion 0792
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0300 PM CDT Thu May 15 2025

Areas affected...Portions of northwest Wisconsin

Concerning...Tornado Watch 251...

Valid 152000Z - 152130Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 251 continues.

SUMMARY...Tornado potential, including a strong tornado, will shift
into portions of northwest Wisconsin over the next 1-2 hours.

DISCUSSION...A broken line of supercells continues north and east.
These storms will move across the River and into northwest Wisconsin
shortly. Temperatures have risen into low 80s F with dewpoints
remaining near 64 F. Given the storm mode, low-level thermodynamics,
and backed surface winds, this area will be the primary focus for
tornado potential over the next 1-2 hours. Storms have remained in
close proximity to one another, but still sufficiently discrete that
overall inflow quality remains favorable for low-level mesocyclone
intensification. With objective mesoanalysis showing STP of 2-3, a
strong tornado remains possible.

Mesoscale Discussion 0791
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0214 PM CDT Thu May 15 2025

Areas affected...Parts of southern Wisconsin into northern Illinois

Concerning...Severe potential...Tornado Watch likely 

Valid 151914Z - 152115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...A tornado watch will likely be needed this afternoon.
Supercells capable of all severe hazards are expected within the
next few hours.

DISCUSSION...Cumulus continue to deepen both along a dryline and an
area of confluence within the Mississippi Valley. Whether storms
develop within the confluence or when the dryline reaches the
Mississippi River remains a question. 40-50 kts of effective shear
across these surface convergence zones will favor supercells as
storms develop. Large to very large hail will be a concern as well
as severe wind gusts. The 18Z DVN sounding sampled very steep
mid-level lapse rates and a long hodograph. Tornado potential will
also be present. Surface temperature/dewpoint spreads are near 20 F,
but low-level shear and a supercellular mode will favor low-level
rotation. The time frame of greater tornado potential will likely be
22-00Z when the low-level jet increases in southern Wisconsin.

  700 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail likely with isolated very large hail events
    to 2.5 inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely

SUMMARY...Line of storms moving through north-central Arkansas
continues to organize as it moves quickly eastward. The downstream
airmass is warm and buoyant, suggesting the potential for this
cluster to continue over the next few hours. Strong gusts and large
to very large hail are possible with this cluster, as well any other
storms that develop across the region.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 75
statute miles east and west of a line from 15 miles east northeast
of Poplar Bluff MO to 55 miles east southeast of Russellville AR.
For a complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch
outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU2).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0249 PM CDT Thu May 15 2025

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

A dry, post-frontal air mass will push through portions of the
Midwest this evening, priming northern Illinois for substantially
lower relative humidity for Friday. As a surface low moves into the
Great Lakes region along with accelerating mid-level winds, strong
surface winds of 20-25 mph from the south and southwest will develop
by late morning. The stronger winds combined with relative humidity
falling into the 20-25 percent range will support elevated fire
weather conditions across northern Illinois for Friday morning/early
afternoon. Fire weather threat remains conditional for the Chicago
area as line of showers and thunderstorms and subsequent rainfall
expected this afternoon/evening could limit fire spread potential
for Friday.

..Williams.. 05/15/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0104 AM CDT Thu May 15 2025/

...Synopsis...
Fire-weather potential across the CONUS is relatively low Friday. In
the wake of the departing upper trough, shortwave ridging is
expected over the southern Plains and Southwest. This will
temporarily slow stronger mid-level flow as a Pacific front shifts
eastward. With only modest flow aloft and at the surface, strong
winds are not expected over the driest fuels of the Southwest.
However, warm temperatures and low RH below 20% will remain likely.
This could support some localized fire-weather risk where westerly
winds could gust to 15 mph closer to the terrain. Otherwise,
increasing surface moisture and recent rainfall will largely
preclude fire-weather concerns Friday outside of localized dry and
breezy conditions over parts of the Midwest. However, this is not
expected to be widespread.

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are expected across parts of the upper
Mississippi River Valley and Great Lakes this afternoon and evening.
Tornadoes, some of which could be strong, and very large hail and
damaging winds will be possible. Severe thunderstorms are also
expected through the lower Ohio River Valley, Ozarks and in parts of
the Mid-Atlantic.

...20z Update...
Only minor changes were made to trim probabilities behind ongoing
convective activity with this update.

The Enhanced Risk across the Midwest remains unchanged. Thunderstorm
activity has been ongoing in this region, with reports of a couple
of tornadoes in western Minnesota. Expect thunderstorm activity to
continue to strengthen in this area. See MCD#791 for more
information on the short term threats. 

See previous discussion for more information concerning the broader
Slight Risk across the Mid to upper Mississippi Valley and in the
Central Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic below.

..Thornton/Mosier.. 05/15/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1128 AM CDT Thu May 15 2025/

...Mid to Upper Mississippi Valley/Great Lakes/Ohio Valley...
Recent satellite imagery shows an upper low over SD, with a
negatively tilted shortwave trough moving into the Mid MO Valley.
Surface analysis places an occluded surface low associated with this
system over southeast ND, with an occluded front extending
southeastward to a triple point over far southeast SD. A cold front
extends south-southeastward from this front across far western IA
and into far northeast MO before arcing more southwestward across
far western MO and more southwestward across western OK. A warm
front extends easterward from this triple point across southern MN
and then more southeastward across southwest WI and northern IL.
These boundaries, including the occluded front, will all act in
tandem with increasing large-scale forcing for ascent to force
thunderstorm development this afternoon and evening.

The ongoing storms from eastern SD into central MN are confirmation
of the buoyancy sampled in the 12Z MPX sounding. Expectation is for
instability to build across the region as heating and low-level
moisture advection occur amid steep mid-level lapse rates. Airmass
destabilization and thunderstorm development is anticipated first
from the eastern Dakotas into MN, the occluded front as it shifts
northward as both the primary surface low and triple point low shift
northwestward. Additional development is then anticipated farther
southeast along the warm front across WI. Storms that develop in the
vicinity of the occluded front will likely have elevated structures,
with large hail as the primary risk. Some isolated very large hail
(i.e. greater than 2" in diameter) is possible. Farther southeast,
the corridor along the warm front appears very favorable for
supercells capable of all severe hazards, including very large hail,
strong wind gusts, and tornadoes. A locally higher tornado potential
may exist from  central into southeastern WI from 18Z-22Z. Deeper
mixing is anticipated farther south into northern IL, but the
overall environment will still support robust, organized updrafts.
There may be some trend initially for these storms to quickly become
outflow dominant, but strengthening mid-level flow across the region
after 21Z should aid in maintaining a more organized mode. Upscale
growth into a organized MCS appears probable after 00Z, with the
potential for significant-severe gusts as this line moves eastward
in southern Lower MI. The threat for damaging gusts and isolated
hail will persist throughout the night across Lower MI and the
middle/upper OH Valley.

...Ozarks into the TN Valley...
Additional thunderstorm development is anticipated this afternoon
across AR as a cold front pushes eastward across the region.
Moderate to strong flow aloft should allow for storms to move off
this boundary quickly into a strongly buoyant airmass downstream.
Warm air aloft could limit overall storm longevity during the
afternoon/early evening, but the warm/dry mid-levels are conducive
for producing strong outflows capable of damaging gusts. Whether or
not organization will occur along these outflows is uncertain, but a
conditional risk for continued damaging gusts exists into TN. 

Additional thunderstorms are possible during the evening and
overnight in the wake of the front. Persistent steep mid-level lapse
rates and strong shear will support large hail with some of these
storms.

...Central Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic...  
Large-scale height rises are expected across the region, but
diurnal heating and orographic effects will aid in thunderstorm
development across the higher terrain this afternoon. Northwesterly
flow aloft will favor a southeastward storm motion within an
environment of moderate/locally strong instability. 35-45 kts of
northwesterly deep shear is anticipated, supporting supercell
structures and clusters, posing a risk for large hail and damaging
winds. The overall hodograph structure and resulting storm motion
appears favorable for some very large hail over 2" in diameter as
well.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0220 PM CDT Thu May 15 2025

Valid 171200Z - 181200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS OF
THE SOUTHERN PLAINS INTO ARKANSAS...AND OVER PARTS OF THE
MID-ATLANTIC AND NORTHEAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are possible Saturday across parts of the Mid
Atlantic and Northeast, and across parts of the southeastern Great
Plains to Lower Mississippi Valley.

...Synopsis...

An upper cyclone and attendant shortwave trough over the upper Great
Lakes to the TN Valley will shift east on Saturday, becoming
positioned from NY to offshore the Mid-Atlantic coast by Sunday
morning. Meanwhile, an upper trough will dig across the western U.S.
while upper ridging develops over much of the Plains. A belt of
strong westerly flow associated with the eastern upper trough will
overspread much of eastern U.S., while a sub-tropical jet streak
moves across the southern Plain into the Lower MS Valley. 

At the surface, a cold front will surge east across the Ohio Valley
through early afternoon, and the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast during
the evening/overnight. The southwest extent of this surface boundary
will extend from the Lower OH Valley into central OK Saturday
morning. The boundary may sag southward across portions of the TN
Valley, while the Plains portion of the boundary lifts northward
into KS and southern MO during the evening/overnight. Meanwhile, a
surface dryline will extend south/southwest from near  western OK to
the TX Big Bend vicinity.

...Southern Plains to Lower MS Valley...

The building upper ridge over the Plains will likely suppress
convection across portions of the region as an EML will be difficult
to overcome without stronger large-scale ascent/height falls.
However, low-level convergence along the dryline amid persistent
low-level warm advection and forecast shortwave perturbations
migrating through the upper ridge from the southern Rockies into the
Red River vicinity may aid in isolated to widely scattered storm
development during the afternoon. 

A very moist airmass will be in place (upper 60s/low 70s F
dewpoints) beneath 7.5-8.5 C/km midlevel lapse rates. This will
result in strong instability across the warm sector (MLCAPE greater
than 2500 J/kg). Furthermore, supercell wind profiles are apparent
in forecast soundings, with curved low-level hodographs become
elongated/straight above 2-3 km. Any discrete cells that develop
will pose a risk for large to very large hail. If sufficient storm
coverage occurs, some clustering could result in upscale developing
into an MCS moving across the ArkLaTex vicinity and into the Lower
MS Valley during the evening/nighttime hours. If this occurs, a risk
for damaging gusts will increase.

...Southeast...

Convection may be ongoing/weakening across portions of
MS/AL/GA/SC/NC Saturday morning. It is unclear how this activity may
evolve, but an outflow boundary will likely extend across portions
of MS/AL/GA. Given a very  moist and unstable airmass by afternoon
some redevelopment of thunderstorms is possible. Forcing for ascent
will be nebulous across the Deep South, so coverage may remain
sparse. Nevertheless, any storm that develops could produce strong
gusts or hail.

...NC/VA into the Northeast...

Convection may be ongoing across portions of NC/VA Saturday morning
but likely will be weakening as outflow is expected to be surging
across the Piedmont. It is unclear if redevelopment may occur ahead
of the surface cold front during the afternoon/evening. While a very
moist and unstable airmass will reside across the region,
large-scale ascent will remain weak and focused further north toward
the Northeast. If storms can develop, a risk for large hail and
damaging gusts will be possible. 

Additional storms are expected to develop with northward extent into
the Northeast beneath the upper low and ahead of the surface cold
front. While boundary layer moisture will be more modest with
northward extent, cool temperatures aloft will foster modest
destabilization. Isolated to widely scattered storms will pose a
risk for hail and gusty winds through early evening.

...THERE IS A MODERATE RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
SOUTHEAST MISSOURI...SOUTHERN ILLINOIS/INDIANA...AND CENTRAL AND
WESTERN KENTUCKY...

...SUMMARY...
A regional outbreak of severe thunderstorms is likely across parts
of the middle Mississippi and Ohio Valleys Friday afternoon into
Friday night.  This may include a few intense supercells posing a
risk for large hail and tornadoes.  During the evening into the
overnight hours, this will include an upscale growing and organizing
bowing line of storms posing a risk for strong, damaging winds and a
continuing risk for tornadoes.

...A regional outbreak of severe storms is expected on Friday across
portions of the Mid-South to the Ohio Valley...

...Synopsis...

An upper cyclone over the Upper Midwest and attendant shortwave
trough will develop east/northeast across much of the Midwest and TN
Valley. A swath of strong mid/upper southwesterly flow will
accompany this system. Forecast guidance shows a 70-90 kt 500 mb jet
spreading across the Mid-MS to OH Valley, while 850-700 mb increases
to 40-60 kt by midday. This will result in supercell wind profiles,
support widespread organized convection. Favorable deep-layer shear
will extend downstream into the central Appalachians and
Mid-Atlantic vicinity as well.

At the surface, low pressure will shift east from northern MN into
the Upper Great Lakes. A warm from southern MO into the OH Valley
Friday morning is forecast to lift northward through the afternoon,
allowing rich boundary layer moisture (mid/upper 60s F dewpoints) to
overspread much of the Lower OH Valley, with a large warm sector in
place across a broad region from east TX to the Great Lakes and
eastward toward the Mid-Atlantic coast. Corridors of moderate to
strong destabilization during the day and into the nighttime hours
will support several areas of severe storms from east Texas into
much of the Midwest and the Mid-Atlantic, some of which could be
significant.

...Mid-MS Valley into the OH/TN Valley Vicinity...

Forecast guidance depicts potential for remnant convection from Day
1/Thu ongoing across KY or TN Friday morning. Current expectation is
that this activity will dissipate or weaken as it shifts east toward
the central Appalachians. Strong warm advection should allow for
rapid airmass recovery in the way of any morning thunderstorm
activity.

By midday, a very moist (mid 60s to low 70s F dewpoints) airmass
will be in place beneath steep midlevel lapse rates, fostering
MLCAPE around 2500-3500 J/kg from southeast MO northward to around
the I-70 corridor and east toward the IN/KY. One or more clusters of
convection is expected to develop by early afternoon within the
strong warm advection regime and as large-scale ascent increases
with the approach of the upper trough and an eastward-advancing cold
front extending from eastern IA/western MO into central OK/TX around
midday.

Supercell wind profiles with enlarged low-level hodographs becoming
elongated above 2-3 km within a volatile thermodynamic environment
suggests convection will rapidly intensify. Any convection that
remains discrete will pose a risk for very large hail (up to 3.5
inches), tornadoes (a few may be strong), and damaging gusts. With
time, consolidation of thunderstorm clusters is expected and an
organized bow is forecast to move across the OH/TN Valley region.
Intense, damaging gusts greater than 70 kt will be possible once
this occurs.

Additional convection is expected to develop during the evening
ahead of the advancing cold front from northern AR into western
TN/KY. If this activity can remain discrete, supercells will pose an
all-hazards severe risk. Eventually, this activity should become
linear, but will still have an attendant wind/tornado risk, with a
gradual weakening trend during the overnight hours expected across
MS/AL/GA.

...Central Appalachians to Mid-Atlantic...

Thunderstorms may be ongoing Friday morning across parts of PA and
spread east/southeast through early afternoon as a lead upper
shortwave impulse moves across the Northeast. Moistening and heating
ahead of this activity will support moderate to strong
destabilization, especially from the Chesapeake Bay vicinity
southward across the VA/NC Piedmont. The initial round of
thunderstorms may pose a risk for locally strong gusts and hail
before moving offshore the NJ/DE/MD coast during the early
afternoon.

During the evening/overnight hours, a mature bowing MCS is expected
to move over the WV/VA/NC mountains and spread east across the
region, posing a risk for swaths of strong to damaging wind gusts.
Forecast guidance varies in timing and exact evolution of this
system across the region, but portions of the area may need higher
probabilities in subsequent outlooks.

...WI/MI...

Thunderstorms are expected to develop ahead of the surface low and
cold front during the afternoon and evening. Cold temperatures aloft
will support steep midlevel lapse rates and weak to moderate
instability despite more modest boundary layer moisture. Favorable
shear will support organized convection capable of isolated damaging
gusts and hail.

...ArkLaTex vicinity...

A more conditional risk of significant severe thunderstorms will
exist across northeast TX into southern AR/northwest LA. A very
moist and strongly unstable airmass will be in place, and forecast
guidance suggests capping should erode along/ahead of the surface
dryline. Low-level convergence along the surface boundary is not
expected to be strong, and large-scale ascent will be nebulous, with
neutral height tendencies expected. Nevertheless, at least a few
storms are expected to develop during/just after peak heating.
Supercell wind profiles, with long/straight hodographs are apparent
in forecast soundings. Furthermore, thermodynamic profiles will be
very favorable for large hail, while steepening low-level lapse
rates will support strong outflow winds. Isolated significant hail
(to 2.5 inches) is possible in addition to sporadic damaging gusts.

consisting of the tropical cyclone &lt;br /&gt;public advisory, the
forecast/advisory, the cyclone discussion, and &lt;br /&gt;a wind speed
probability product, is issued every six hours for all &lt;br
/&gt;ongoing tropical cyclones. In addition, a special advisory package
&lt;br /&gt;may be issued at any time to advise of significant
unexpected &lt;br /&gt;changes or to modify watches or warnings.&lt;br
/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NHC has the option to issue advisories, watches, and

storm or hurricane conditions to &lt;br /&gt;land areas within 72 hours.
For these land-threatening "potential &lt;br /&gt;tropical cyclones",
NHC will issue the full suite of advisory and &lt;br /&gt;watch/warning

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1137 AM CDT Thu May 15 2025

Valid 151700Z - 161200Z

Cooler temperatures and lighter boundary layer winds will mitigate
fire weather concerns across southeastern Arizona today,
necessitating a slight pullback in Elevated highlights. Stronger
mid-level winds and efficient mixing will continue to support an
elevated fire weather threat across southern New Mexico into far
west Texas. Downslope/leeward enhancement of surface winds should 
also occur across the High Plains of northeastern New Mexico.

..Williams.. 05/15/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0104 AM CDT Thu May 15 2025/

...Synopsis...
An upper trough will quickly move eastward over the central US with
accompanying strong mid-level flow. A deepening lee cyclone will
intensify further as it move into the Upper Midwest tonight. As the
low deepens, a Pacific cold front and tailing dryline will move
quickly through the Rockies, into the Plains and Midwest States.
Cooler temperatures, gusty westerly winds and some precipitation are
possible along and behind the front through tonight. Elevated
fire-weather conditions are possible over parts of the southern
Plains and Southwest.

...Southwest...
Persistent westerly flow will continue across the Southwest today
and tonight as a weak pacific front moves over the Rockies. This
will support another day of dry and windy conditions across parts of
eastern AZ and southern NM. Despite somewhat cooler temperatures
behind the front, downsloping  and deep vertical mixing will support
RH below 20% and winds of 15-20% amidst dry fuels. Widespread
elevated to locally critical conditions are expected. Some
fire-weather risk may also extend into West TX behind an eastward
mixing dryline. However, winds here may be somewhat weaker despite
very warm surface temperatures and lower humidity. Locally elevated
conditions are possible within drying fuels.

...Central plains and Midwest...
Gusty westerly winds are possible behind the advancing cold front
from parts of the central Plains into western IA and MO this
afternoon. While gusts may reach 20-25 mph, RH values are not
expected to be critical with cooler temperatures. Additionally,
recent wetting rainfall may temporarily limit available fuels. This
suggests any fire-weather concerns will be localized and short
lived.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1128 AM CDT Thu May 15 2025

Valid 151630Z - 161200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS
EAST-CENTRAL MINNESOTA...MUCH OF WISCONSIN...SOUTHERN AND WESTERN
LOWER MICHIGAN...NORTHEAST ILLINOIS...NORTHERN INDIANA AND NORTHWEST
OHIO...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PORTIONS OF
VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST NORTH CAROLINA...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are expected across parts of the upper
Mississippi River Valley and Great Lakes this afternoon and evening.
Tornadoes, some of which could be strong, and very large hail and
damaging winds will be possible. Severe thunderstorms are also
expected through the lower Ohio River Valley, Ozarks and in parts of
the Mid-Atlantic.

...Mid to Upper Mississippi Valley/Great Lakes/Ohio Valley...
Recent satellite imagery shows an upper low over SD, with a
negatively tilted shortwave trough moving into the Mid MO Valley.
Surface analysis places an occluded surface low associated with this
system over southeast ND, with an occluded front extending
southeastward to a triple point over far southeast SD. A cold front
extends south-southeastward from this front across far western IA
and into far northeast MO before arcing more southwestward across
far western MO and more southwestward across western OK. A warm
front extends easterward from this triple point across southern MN
and then more southeastward across southwest WI and northern IL.
These boundaries, including the occluded front, will all act in
tandem with increasing large-scale forcing for ascent to force
thunderstorm development this afternoon and evening.

The ongoing storms from eastern SD into central MN are confirmation
of the buoyancy sampled in the 12Z MPX sounding. Expectation is for
instability to build across the region as heating and low-level
moisture advection occur amid steep mid-level lapse rates. Airmass
destabilization and thunderstorm development is anticipated first
from the eastern Dakotas into MN, the occluded front as it shifts
northward as both the primary surface low and triple point low shift
northwestward. Additional development is then anticipated farther
southeast along the warm front across WI. Storms that develop in the
vicinity of the occluded front will likely have elevated structures,
with large hail as the primary risk. Some isolated very large hail
(i.e. greater than 2" in diameter) is possible. Farther southeast,
the corridor along the warm front appears very favorable for
supercells capable of all severe hazards, including very large hail,
strong wind gusts, and tornadoes. A locally higher tornado potential
may exist from  central into southeastern WI from 18Z-22Z. Deeper
mixing is anticipated farther south into northern IL, but the
overall environment will still support robust, organized updrafts.
There may be some trend initially for these storms to quickly become
outflow dominant, but strengthening mid-level flow across the region
after 21Z should aid in maintaining a more organized mode. Upscale
growth into a organized MCS appears probable after 00Z, with the
potential for significant-severe gusts as this line moves eastward
in southern Lower MI. The threat for damaging gusts and isolated
hail will persist throughout the night across Lower MI and the
middle/upper OH Valley.

...Ozarks into the TN Valley...
Additional thunderstorm development is anticipated this afternoon
across AR as a cold front pushes eastward across the region.
Moderate to strong flow aloft should allow for storms to move off
this boundary quickly into a strongly buoyant airmass downstream.
Warm air aloft could limit overall storm longevity during the
afternoon/early evening, but the warm/dry mid-levels are conducive
for producing strong outflows capable of damaging gusts. Whether or
not organization will occur along these outflows is uncertain, but a
conditional risk for continued damaging gusts exists into TN. 

Additional thunderstorms are possible during the evening and
overnight in the wake of the front. Persistent steep mid-level lapse
rates and strong shear will support large hail with some of these
storms.

...Central Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic...  
Large-scale height rises are expected across the region, but
diurnal heating and orographic effects will aid in thunderstorm
development across the higher terrain this afternoon. Northwesterly
flow aloft will favor a southeastward storm motion within an
environment of moderate/locally strong instability. 35-45 kts of
northwesterly deep shear is anticipated, supporting supercell
structures and clusters, posing a risk for large hail and damaging
winds. The overall hodograph structure and resulting storm motion
appears favorable for some very large hail over 2" in diameter as
well.

Mesoscale Discussion 0785
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0723 AM CDT Thu May 15 2025

Areas affected...Southeast SD...southern MN...extreme northeast
NE/northwest IA

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 151223Z - 151400Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A threat for strong to isolated severe storms may continue
through the morning.

DISCUSSION...A long-lived storm cluster is ongoing this morning
across south-central MN. This system has persisted longer than most
guidance would suggest, and is likely being aided by persistent
moisture transport associated with a strong low-level jet. While
this system remains relatively disorganized with outflow tending to
outpace the deeper convection, localized strong wind gusts and hail
will be possible, especially where new updrafts develop and briefly
intensify behind the outflow. 

To the southwest, renewed storm development is underway across
southeast SD and far northeast NE, immediately in advance of a
compact but vigorous midlevel shortwave trough moving across
north-central NE/south-central SD. Rather strong low-level
southeasterly flow will maintain moisture transport into the region
through the morning ahead of a cold front, and development of
somewhat more organized convection will be possible with time. In
the short term, convection will tend to be somewhat elevated, but
could become rooted closer to the surface later this morning,
especially with southeast extent. Some hail and strong-gust
potential could evolve if convection is able to deepen and intensify
within this regime.  

With the threat expected to remain rather isolated over the next 1-2
hours, short-term watch issuance is considered unlikely. Trends will
continue to be monitored for intensification with time this morning.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0358 AM CDT Thu May 15 2025

Valid 181200Z - 231200Z

...DISCUSSION...
Medium-range guidance indicates that the persistent, prominent
mid/upper ridging across the mid-latitude and subtropical eastern
Pacific will become suppressed late this coming weekend into early
next week, before breaking down through the remainder of this
period.  As it does, amplified downstream troughing is forecast to
emerge from the Intermountain West.  Sunday, this may commence
gradually, with one significant lead short wave perturbation
pivoting north-northeast of the southern Rockies, accompanied by
cyclogenesis across eastern Colorado, as an upstream perturbation
continues to dig toward the Four Corners region.  It appears that
this trailing perturbation will then pivot across the southern
Rockies through the central/southern Great Plains by late Monday,
perhaps accompanied by renewed cyclogenesis across the Texas
Panhandle into central Great Plains.  

Both days, the dryline and warm front may provide focus for
organized severe convective development, including supercells, in
the presence of strong deep-layer shear and thermodynamic profiles
characterized by steep lapse rates and sizable CAPE.  It appears
that a substantive risk for strong to severe thunderstorms will
persist into at least Tuesday, within a broadening warm sector as
the cyclone and associated mid-level troughing shift a bit more
rapidly eastward across the middle Mississippi Valley.

Convective potential becomes more unclear Wednesday into Thursday as
the cyclone likely weakens and synoptic developments become more
uncertain across the East.

Mesoscale Discussion 0778
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0307 PM CDT Wed May 14 2025

Areas affected...Southwest into central Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 142007Z - 142200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Large/very-large hail and severe winds will be the primary
threats as storms develop and mature this afternoon and evening.
Supercells on the southern end of the activity may have slightly
higher associated tornado threat. A watch is likely late this
afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Dewpoints have held in the low 60s F in central
Nebraska this afternoon. Cumulus towers and recent lightning have
been observed in Cherry County in the last hour along a surface
boundary. Water vapor imagery shows ascent increasing in Colorado as
a shortwave trough continues to pivot northeastward. This ascent
should reach western/southwestern Nebraska later this afternoon. In
the near term, additional storms appear probable as
heating/convergence continue along the boundary. The eastern
boundary is the most likely zone for initiation, though additional
storms could form on the weaker boundary to the west. With
deep-layer shear having a more westerly component this far south,
which should be maintained/modestly increase as the trough ejects
this evening, a mixed mode of linear segments and supercells can be
expected. Supercells will be favored with southern extent.

Modestly steep mid-level lapse rates and increasing shear by the
evening will support organized storms capable of large/very-large
hail (particularly supercells) and severe winds. While the low-level
jet response this evening is not expected to be overly strong, a
supercell along the southern flank of the activity may have slightly
higher tornado potential.

A watch is likely by late afternoon. Timing of watch issuance is
somewhat uncertain given greater storm coverage may wait until
greater mid-level ascent arrives by 22-00Z.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 247
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
350 PM CDT Wed May 14 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Western and Central Nebraska
  South-Central and Central South Dakota

* Effective this Wednesday afternoon and evening from 350 PM
  until 1100 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 75
    mph possible
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 3
    inches in diameter possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms should continue to gradually increase in
coverage and intensity this afternoon and evening. Supercells should
pose a threat for large to very large hail potentially up to 2-3
inches in diameter, especially across parts of western into central
Nebraska. Otherwise, scattered severe wind gusts may occur with any
clusters that eventually form. A tornado or two also appears
possible, mainly this evening.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 45
statute miles east and west of a line from 35 miles north of Pierre
SD to 25 miles east southeast of Imperial NE. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU7).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
3 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 65 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
20030.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0749 AM CDT Wed May 14 2025

Valid 141300Z - 151200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PORTIONS OF
THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong to severe thunderstorms are possible mainly over
parts of the Dakotas and Nebraska this afternoon and evening, and
far western Iowa and southwest Minnesota overnight. A few strong to
severe storms may occur from parts of the southern Appalachians to
the Carolinas and Mid-Atlantic this afternoon.

...Northern/Central Plains...
Surface low pressure will deepen in the vicinity of the CO/KS/NE
border today in response to the approach of an upper-level trough,
as an associated surface cold front moves slowly east across the
central/northern Plains. Low-level moisture advection and steep
mid-level lapse rates (in excess of 8 deg C/km) will result in
MLCAPE of 2500-3000 J/kg across central NE, with weaker instability
northward across the central Dakotas. Thunderstorm development is
expected by late afternoon near the front across the Dakotas and
central/northern NE, with severe hail and wind the primary risks.
Damaging winds will become more likely as one or two clusters
ultimately evolve over central/northern NE and move towards
southeast SD/southwest MN and far northwest IA during the late
evening and overnight.

Across southwest/central NE, more discrete supercell structures will
be possible with storms developing closer to the surface low/dryline
intersection, with large to very large hail possible. A 5 percent
tornado probability has been introduced across portions of central
NE, where a short-duration window may exist for a couple of
tornadoes this evening with any semi-discrete storm or small cluster
in the presence of increasing low-level shear. Expected upscale
growth should limit the time frame for supercell tornado potential. 


...Southern Appalachians into the Carolinas and Mid-Atlantic...
Weak to moderate instability will develop from the southern 
Appalachians to the Carolinas Wednesday. As a mid-level shortwave
trough overspreads the region, scattered thunderstorms are expected
to develop. Sufficient shear of 25 to 30 knots will support some
storm organization including potential for transient supercell
structures. Modestly steep mid-level lapse rates should support the
potential for large hail and perhaps isolated damaging wind gusts.

Mesoscale Discussion 0774
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0746 AM CDT Tue May 13 2025

Areas affected...Parts of eastern NC into southeast VA

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 131246Z - 131445Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A localized brief-tornado and wind-damage threat may
persist through the morning.

DISCUSSION...Extensive convection is ongoing this morning across
eastern NC into southeast VA. Weak instability (MLCAPE generally 500
J/kg or less) is limiting updraft intensity, with lightning
primarily confined to somewhat deeper convection near the NC coast.
However, to the east of the slow-moving midlevel cyclone centered
over western TN/KY, rather strong low-level flow continues to be
noted on the KMHX and KAKQ VWPs, supporting effective SRH of 150-200
m2/s2. Small cells with occasional rotation have persisted from
northeast NC into far southeast VA, and some localized threat for a
brief tornado and wind damage could persist through the morning with
these smaller cells. 

Farther south, an extensive convective cluster is ongoing off the NC
coast, with some evidence of an MCV south of Morehead City. This
cluster could spread northward toward the immediate coast and Outer
Banks with time, with embedded cells potentially posing a threat of
strong gusts and a brief tornado, especially where surface dewpoints
remain near 70 F this morning.

0139 PM CDT Sun May 11 2025

Areas affected...eastern Idaho into western Wyoming and southwest
Montana

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 111839Z - 112115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Storms should gradually increase in coverage and intensity
from eastern Idaho into southwest Montana, with both hail and gust
potential.

DISCUSSION...A line of convection continue to increase in intensity
over the upper Snake River Plain, with both strong heating and
low-level warm advection ahead of it. Continued steepening of
deep-layer lapse rates as the upper trough moves in the from the
west and more heating should support further strengthening of this
convection. Strong deep-layer shear will favor hail production with
these storms over eastern ID. A brief/weak tornado cannot be ruled
out with the stronger cells this afternoon, as low-level stretching
is maximized.

Farther north toward the Bitterroots, stronger cooling aloft is
occurring, and areas of heating persist ahead of this activity as
well. Long hodographs and cold midlevel temperatures will favor hail
with these storms through the day.

Mesoscale Discussion 0767

0221 PM CDT Sun May 11 2025

Areas affected...central Florida northward toward southeast Georgia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 111921Z - 112145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Storms are forecast to increase in coverage throughout the
afternoon from the central Florida Peninsula into northeast Florida
and southeast Georgia.

DISCUSSION...Storms are currently increasing east of Tampa to west
of Okeechobee where strong heating has led to strong instability.
The southerly flow regime should support a north/northeast movement
to this development, affecting the remainder of central into
northeastern Florida. Breaks in the clouds in those downstream areas
are developing, and this should further increase instability.
Although temperatures aloft are not as cool as previous days, MUCAPE
over 2000 J/kg and deep-layer shear of 35-40 kt will support
cellular storm mode with sporadic hail > 1.00" expected. Locally
strong to damaging gusts cannot be ruled out as well, especially
with any merging outflows.

* Effective this Sunday afternoon and evening from 110 PM until
  800 PM MDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 80
    mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm intensity and coverage is expected to
increase this afternoon across eastern ID, northern UT, and western
WY. Environmental conditions support the potential for strong to
severe storms capable of strong gusts. Isolated large hail is also
possible, particularly in areas of higher terrain.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 80
statute miles east and west of a line from 65 miles north northeast
of Idaho Falls ID to 40 miles southwest of Salt Lake City UT. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU5).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

Areas affected...Portions of southeast Georgia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 111849Z - 112045Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A locally greater risk for damaging winds and perhaps a
tornado is evident in southeast Georgia near a local warm front
feature.

DISCUSSION...A small corridor in southeast Georgia has heated into
the low 80s F. A few weak discrete cells exist near the
Georgia/South Carolina state line. One cell has recently intensified
and shown signs of low-level rotation. The localized warm front
feature will promote at least marginal potential for a brief tornado
with southeasterly winds near the boundary. Nearby KCLX radar
accordingly shows modest 0-1 km SRH. Over the next hour or two this
environment will support a locally greater risk for damaging winds
and perhaps a tornado. The discrete cells will have the greatest
potential, but stronger updrafts within the linear segment farther
southwest could also acquire low-level rotation as well.

0130 PM CDT Sun May 11 2025

Areas affected...Salt Lake Vicinity

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 111830Z - 112030Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Severe wind gusts will be possible this afternoon with
high-based showers and embedded thunderstorms.

DISCUSSION...With temperatures rising into the low/mid 80s F in the
vicinity of Salt Lake, high-based showers and isolated thunderstorms
have deepened over the last hour. A few of these storms have
produced 58-63 mph measured gusts in Tooele/Salt Lake Counties.
While low-level wind fields are not overly strong, the 9.2 C/km
700-500 mb lapse rate observed in this mornings 12Z SLC sounding,
coupled with steep low-level lapse rates and high surface dewpoint
depressions, will continue to support strong diabatically driven
downdrafts. Severe wind gusts will remain possible through the
afternoon in association with this weak, disorganized convection.
