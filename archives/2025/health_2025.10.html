microbiota changes among NMIBC patients during BCG therapy: comparing
BCG responders and non-responders</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The gold standard for treating high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder
cancer involves the transurethral removal of cancerous tissue followed
by BCG immunotherapy. So far, there is no reliable biomarker for
predicting BCG efficacy and identifying patients who will or will not
respond to BCG treatment. Emerging evidence suggests that urinary
microbiota may play a crucial role in BCG efficacy. This study aimed to
explore (i) changes in urinary microbiota during the six induction
cycles of BCG and (ii) its potential predictive role in determining the
outcome of BCG treatment. To this end, catheterized urine samples were
collected before each of the six BCG doses and bacterial composition was
analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Patient inclusion criteria were
male gender, no previous history of urothelial cancer, no other
malignancies, no active infection, and no antibiotic usage for at least
20 days before the first BCG dose. We observed a significant decrease in
biodiversity, measured by the Shannon Index, during the first week of
therapy in 10 out of 12 patients (p=0.021). Additionally, differences in
microbiota composition before the start of BCG therapy were noted
between responders and non-responders to BCG therapy. Non-responders
exhibited a 12 times higher abundance of genus Aureispira (p&lt;0.001),
and, at the species level, a 27-fold lower abundance of Negativicoccus
succinivorans (p&lt;0.001). Throughout the treatment, the abundance of
the genus Aureispira decreased, showing an eightfold reduction by the
end of therapy among non-responders (p&lt;0.001). Our findings suggest
that urinary microbiota plays an active role before and during the
course of BCG therapy. However, this is a preliminary study, and further
research involving larger patient cohorts is needed.</p>

gut microbiome features characterize Fasciola hepatica infection and
predict triclabendazole treatment outcomes in Peruvian patients</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundFasciola hepatica, a globally distributed helminth, causes
fasciolosis, a disease with significant health and economic impacts.
Variability in triclabendazole (TCBZ) efficacy and emerging resistance
are remaining challenges. Evidence suggests that the gut microbiome
influences host-helminth interactions and is associated with
anthelmintic effects, but its association with human F. hepatica
infection and TCBZ efficacy is not well understood.MethodsIn this study,
we investigated the relationship between Fasciola hepatica infection and
the gut microbiome through metagenomic shotgun sequencing of 30 infected
and 60 age- and sex-matched uninfected individuals from Peru.
Additionally, we performed a longitudinal analysis to evaluate
microbiome dynamics in relation to TCBZ treatment response.Results and
discussionInfection was associated with specific microbial taxonomic and
functional features, including higher abundance of Negativibacillus
sp900547015, Blautia A sp000285855, and Prevotella sp002299635 species,
and enrichment of microbial pathways linked to survival under stress and
depletion of pathways for microbial growth. Unexpectedly, we identified
that responders to TCBZ treatment (who cleared infection) harbored many
microbiome features significantly different relative to non-responders,
both before and after treatment. Specifically, the microbiomes of
responders had a higher abundance Firmicutes A and Bacteroides species
as well as phospholipid synthesis and glucuronidation pathways, while
non-responders had higher abundance of Actinobacteria species including
several from the Parolsenella and Bifidobacterium genera, and
Bifidobacterium shunt and amino acid biosynthesis
pathways.ConclusionsOur findings underscore the impact of helminth
infection on gut microbiome and suggest a potential role of gut
microbiota in modulating TCBZ efficacy, offering novel insights into F.
hepatica-microbiome interactions and paving the way for
microbiome-informed treatment approaches.</p>

id="gut-microbiome-is-associated-with-radiotherapy-response-in-lung-cancer-patients-with-brain-metastases">Gut
microbiome is associated with radiotherapy response in lung cancer
patients with brain metastases</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>PurposeTo investigate the gut microbiome of lung cancer patients with
brain metastases undergoing radiotherapy, identify key microorganisms
associated with radiotherapy response, and evaluate their potential as
biomarkers.Methods and materialsThis study enrolled 55 newly diagnosed
lung cancer patients with brain metastases. Fecal samples were collected
before radiotherapy and analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing to assess the
gut microbiome’s composition and function. Patients were categorized
into response (n=28) and non-response (n=27) groups based on treatment
efficacy, and α-diversity, β-diversity, and functional pathways were
compared between them. Linear Discriminant Analysis Effect Size was used
to identify microbial features associated with treatment efficacy.
Logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the predictive
capacity of clinical and microbial factors for treatment
outcomes.ResultsNo significant difference in α-diversity was observed
between the groups (P &gt; 0.05), but β-diversity differed significantly
(P = 0.036). Twelve characteristic microorganisms were identified in the
response group, including g_ Oscillibacter and g_ Blautia, and nine in
the non-response group, such as f_ Desulfovibrionaceae and g_ Megamonas.
Metabolic pathways associated with treatment response included ketone
body metabolism and pathways related to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
Multivariate analysis identified g_Flavonifractor (odds ratio [OR] =
6.680, P = 0.004), g_Negativibacillus (OR = 3.862, P = 0.014),
C-reactive protein (OR = 1.054, P = 0.017), and systemic inflammation
response index (OR = 1.367, P = 0.043) as independent predictors of
radiotherapy response. The nomogram and microbiome models achieved area
under the curve (AUC) values of 0.935 and 0.866, respectively,
demonstrating excellent predictive performance. Decision curve analysis
further confirmed these models provided significant net benefits across
risk thresholds.ConclusionsThe composition and functional
characteristics of the gut microbiome in lung cancer patients with brain
metastases prior to radiotherapy are associated with therapeutic
response and possess potential as predictive biomarkers. Further studies
are warranted to validate these findings.</p>
