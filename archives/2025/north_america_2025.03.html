seeks return of US military equipment from Afghan Taliban</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Ayaz Gul  — President-elect Donald Trump says that future financial
assistance to Afghanistan will be contingent upon the return of U.S.
military equipment by the Taliban leaders currently in power. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Trump’s remarks at a Sunday rally in Washington on the eve of his
January 20 inauguration have heightened uncertainty regarding his
administration’s stance on the crisis-hit South Asian nation. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“They [Biden administration] gave billions of billions of dollars to
the Taliban. They gave our military equipment, a big chunk of it, to the
enemy,” Trump said. He referred to the tumultuous and hasty withdrawal
of U.S. troops from Afghanistan in August 2021, ordered by President Joe
Biden. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“If we’re going to pay billions of dollars a year, tell them we’re
not going to give them the money unless they give back our military
equipment. … So, we will give them a couple of bucks; we want the
military equipment back,” Trump stated without elaborating. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>A report issued by the U.S. Department of Defense in 2022 revealed
that approximately $7 billion worth of military equipment was left
behind in Afghanistan following the completion of the military
withdrawal. The equipment in question, which included aircraft,
air-to-ground munitions, military vehicles, weapons, communications
equipment, and other materials, was subsequently seized by the Taliban.
 </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The de facto Afghan rulers have since repeatedly displayed the U.S.
military gear in their so-called victory day celebrations over the past
three years. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The foreign troop exit stemmed from the February 2020 Doha Agreement
that the first Trump administration negotiated with the then-insurgent
Taliban. Biden completed and defended the military withdrawal, saying
the choice he had was either to follow through on that agreement or be
prepared to go back to fighting the Taliban. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Following the withdrawal, the Biden administration largely isolated
the Taliban and imposed new sanctions on the group. Washington, however,
has continued to be the largest donor to Afghanistan, a country that the
United Nations says is suffering through one of the severest
humanitarian crises in the world. U.S. officials have also engaged in
diplomatic efforts with the Taliban to negotiate the release of certain
U.S. detainees and assisted in relocating Afghan allies who had helped
American forces. </p>
<p>US gives cash for humanitarian aid </p>
<p>The billions of dollars that Trump repeatedly has referred to are
likely the cash shipments being channeled through the U.N. and
non-governmental organizations to support humanitarian programs in
Afghanistan. Washington remains the primary donor and has spent
approximately $3 billion in humanitarian aid since the U.S.
withdrawal.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thomas Ruttig from the independent Afghanistan Analysts Network
warned of challenges for the Taliban under the Trump administration. He
noted that some members of Congress and incoming administration
officials took part in the 20-year U.S. mission in Afghanistan and have
been highly critical of the Taliban. </p>
<p>Despite this, he stated that countering regional terrorism is a
significant concern in Washington, and it could potentially encourage
the Trump administration to seek cooperation with the Taliban to combat
terrorist organizations, including the Afghanistan-based affiliate of
the Islamic State terrorist organization known as IS-Khorasan.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ruttig said that Tim Burchett, Republican vice chair of the U.S.
Congress’s Foreign Affairs Committee, recently introduced a bill, the
“No Tax Dollars for Terrorists Act,” to ensure that U.S. tax money does
not end up in the hands of the Taliban.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan denies that cash shipments
for humanitarian programs are financing the Taliban. The mission says
the current setup – in which cash is physically brought to Afghanistan
and placed in designated U.N. accounts in a private bank – is in place
because of a ban on international banking transfers and ongoing
liquidity issues.</p>
<p>“All these funds are then distributed directly to the United Nations
entities, as well as to a small number of approved and vetted
humanitarian partners in Afghanistan,” according to the mission. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Taliban leaders have rejected Trump’s assertions that their
government received U.S. financial aid, stating that they do not expect
or seek any assistance from Washington. “Instead, it (U.S.) has
confiscated and frozen billions of dollars that rightfully belong to the
people of Afghanistan,” said a Taliban statement in response to Trump’s
remarks earlier this month. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ruttig warns that punitive measures and sanctions to pressure the
Taliban into submission might also provoke them to stop cooperation with
international stakeholders. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Today, the US-Taliban Doha Agreement is still considered valid and
obliges the Taliban to restrict ISKP and other groups from using their
shelter in Afghanistan to commit terrorist acts in the West. This could
be jeopardized by new quasi-sanctions on them,” he said in written
comments.  </p>
<p>Taliban hopes for better relations </p>
<p>Masuda Sultan, an Afghan American advocate for women’s rights, is
doubtful the new Trump administration will substantially change its
stance on the Taliban. Instead, she expects the U.S. will cut aid
contributions to U.N.-funded programs like the World Food Program that
have supported the country’s most vulnerable. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>At the same time, Taliban leaders appear publicly optimistic about a
favorable shift in U.S. policy under the Trump presidency, attributing
this to their Doha pact with his previous Trump administration. Kabul
promptly welcomed Trump’s election victory just one day after he was
declared the winner of the United States presidential vote. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Taliban foreign ministry issued a formal statement expressing its
hope that “the incoming U.S. administration will adopt a pragmatic
approach to ensure tangible advancement in bilateral relations, allowing
both nations to open a new chapter of relations grounded in mutual
engagement.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Earlier this month, Taliban Deputy Foreign Minister Sher Mohammad
Abbas Stanikzai commended Trump as a “decisive” and “courageous” leader.
Stanikzai suggested that Trump reconsider Biden’s policy and adopt a new
approach. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“We want to build good relations with the international community and
the Western countries,” Stanikzai said in televised remarks in local
language. “An enemy doesn’t remain an enemy forever, and a friend
doesn’t remain a friend forever either,” he added.</p>

They don’t think Trump will repeal most of the climate provisions in the

They’re bullish about geothermal, hot rocks, and batteries. Fervo, Form

They view high-quality heat pumps as being pretty far from mass

On average, they see global temperatures rising by 2.8 degrees Celsius

id="biden-pardons-fauci-and-milley-in-effort-to-guard-against-potential-revenge-by-trump">Biden
pardons Fauci and Milley in effort to guard against potential ‘revenge’
by Trump</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — President Joe Biden has pardoned Dr. Anthony Fauci,
retired Gen. Mark Milley and members of the House committee that
investigated the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, using the extraordinary
powers of his office in his final hours to guard against potential
“revenge” by the incoming Trump administration.</p>
<p>The decision by Biden comes after Donald Trump warned of an enemies
list filled with those who have crossed him politically or sought to
hold him accountable for his attempt to overturn his 2020 election loss
and his role in the storming of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Trump
has selected Cabinet nominees who backed his election lies and who have
pledged to punish those involved in efforts to investigate him.</p>
<p>“The issuance of these pardons should not be mistaken as an
acknowledgment that any individual engaged in any wrongdoing, nor should
acceptance be misconstrued as an admission of guilt for any offense,”
Biden said in a statement. “Our nation owes these public servants a debt
of gratitude for their tireless commitment to our country.”</p>
<p>It’s customary for a president to grant clemency at the end of his
term, but those acts of mercy are usually offered to everyday Americans
who have been convicted of crimes. But Biden has used the power in the
broadest and most untested way possible: to pardon those who have not
even been investigated yet. And with the acceptance comes a tacit
admission of guilt or wrongdoing, even though those who have been
pardoned have not been formally accused of any crimes.</p>
<p>“These are exceptional circumstances, and I cannot in good conscience
do nothing,” Biden said, adding that “Even when individuals have done
nothing wrong — and in fact have done the right thing — and will
ultimately be exonerated, the mere fact of being investigated or
prosecuted can irreparably damage reputations and finances.”</p>
<p>Fauci was director of the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health for nearly 40
years and was Biden’s chief medical adviser until his retirement in
2022. He helped coordinate the nation’s response to the COVID-19
pandemic and raised the ire of Trump during that time. He has become a
target of intense hatred and vitriol from people on the right, who blame
him for mask mandates and other policies they believe infringed on their
rights, even as tens of thousands of Americans were dying.</p>
<p>Mark Milley is the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and
called Trump a fascist and detailed Trump’s conduct around the deadly
Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection.</p>
<p>Biden is also extending pardons to members and staff of the Jan. 6
committee, including former Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, both
Republicans, as well as the U.S. Capitol and D.C. Metropolitan police
officers who testified before the committee.</p>
<p>Biden, an institutionalist, has promised a smooth transition to the
next administration, inviting Trump to the White House and saying that
the nation will be OK, even as he warned during his farewell address of
a growing oligarchy. He has spent years warning that Trump’s ascension
to the presidency again would be a threat to democracy. His decision to
break with political norms with the preemptive pardons was brought on by
those concerns.</p>
<p>Biden has set the presidential record for most individual pardons and
commutations issued; he announced on Friday he would commuting the
sentences of almost 2,500 people convicted of nonviolent drug offenses.
He previously announced he was commuting the sentences of 37 of the 40
people on federal death row, converting their punishments to life
imprisonment just weeks before Trump, an outspoken proponent of
expanding capital punishment, takes office. In his first term, Trump
presided over an unprecedented spate of executions, 13, in a protracted
timeline during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

restores US services after Trump promise to delay ban</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — TikTok restored services to users in the United States
on Sunday after briefly blocking access due to a U.S. law banning the
social media platform based on national security concerns. </p>
<p>The situation played out amid the change in U.S. administrations as
President-elect Donald Trump said he would seek to “extend the period of
time before the law’s prohibitions take effect.” </p>
<p>He also proposed, in a post on his Truth Social platform, for the
United States to take a 50% ownership stake in TikTok. </p>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday upheld legislation passed by
Congress that called for banning TikTok unless its China-based parent
company sold it by Sunday. </p>
<p>The Biden administration had said it would not seek to enforce the
ban in its final days in office, leaving the issue to Trump after he
took office on Monday. </p>
<p>TikTok credited Trump as it announced the restoration of its
services, saying Sunday on X that he provided “the necessary clarity and
assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties
providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7
million small businesses to thrive.” </p>
<p>Trump’s actions marked a reversal from his first term in office when
he sought to ban TikTok in connection with concerns that the service was
sharing the personal information of U.S. users with the Chinese
government. </p>
<p>At a briefing Monday in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesperson Mao Ning said China believes companies should “decide
independently” about their operations and agreements. </p>
<p>“TikTok has operated in the U.S. for many years and is deeply loved
by American users,” she said. “We hope that the U.S. can earnestly
listen to the voice of reason and provide an open, fair, just and
non-discriminatory business environment for firms operating there.” </p>

rights leaders, King family issue call to action as inauguration falls
on MLK Day</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — When President-elect Donald Trump is sworn in as
president of the United States inside the Capitol’s rotunda, he will do
so facing a bust of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. on the federal
holiday commemorating King’s legacy.</p>
<p>It’s a disquieting contrast for some civil rights advocates who wish
to fulfill the late reverend’s dream of non-violent social
revolution.</p>
<p>Events honoring King and advocating for his vision of a just society
will occur across the nation as many in the U.S. observe the peaceful
transfer of power in the capital. The concurrent events have been met
with mixed feelings by civil rights leaders, who broadly reviled Trump’s
rhetoric and stances on race and civil rights during his third
presidential campaign.</p>
<p>But many leaders, including King’s own family, see the juxtaposition
as a poignant contrast and a chance to refocus the work of advancing
civil rights in a new political era.</p>
<p>“I’m glad it occurred on that day because it gives the United States
of America and the world the contrast in pictures. Is this the way you
want to go — or is this the way you want to go?” said the Rev. Bernice
King, the late King’s youngest daughter and CEO of the King Center.</p>
<p>“It’s not a day that he can be the star, which he loves to be,”
King’s daughter said of Trump. “He has to contend with that legacy on
that day, regardless of how he manages it and handles it in his
presentation. I hope those around him are advising him well to honor the
day appropriately in his speech.”</p>
<p>This is the third time in the nearly 40 years since the federal King
holiday became law that it coincides with a presidential inauguration.
Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama also were sworn in for their
second terms on the holiday. Both praised King in their remarks; it is
yet to be seen if and how Trump — who falsely claimed his first
inauguration had larger crowds than King’s March on Washington — will
acknowledge the day.</p>
<p>“Will he sound a message of unity and a presidency for all, or will
he continue to focus on his base and some of the divisive policies he’s
championed, like an anti-DEI stance, rounding up immigrants and cutting
important parts of the social safety net through this DOGE (Department
of Government Efficiency) process?” asked Marc Morial, president of the
National Urban League civil rights group.</p>
<p>Morial added that Trump’s inauguration landing on MLK Day represented
“a contradiction of values.”</p>
<p>Many civil rights leaders will spend the day commemorating King’s
legacy after a week of public and private organizing, giving speeches
and strategizing how to respond to the incoming administration’s
agenda.</p>
<p>“It’s the best of times and the worst of times,” said Derrick
Johnson, president of the NAACP, an organization whose members mentored,
collaborated and clashed with King throughout the Civil Rights
Movement.</p>
<p>“Our mission doesn’t change. Our job is to make democracy work for
all, to make sure that equal protection is ensured under the law,”
Johnson said. He added that the group “doesn’t want to assume” the Trump
administration can’t be a partner on advancing civil rights or racial
justice.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Johnson and other civil rights leaders met with
Congressional Black Caucus members on Capitol Hill to discuss how to
work with and to oppose the Trump administration. That same day, the
National Action Network, a civil rights group founded by the Rev. Al
Sharpton, hosted a breakfast at which Vice President Kamala Harris urged
attendees to stay motivated.</p>
<p>“Ours is a journey,” she said. “Whatever the outcome of any
particular moment, we can never be defeated. Our spirit can never be
defeated, because when that happens, we won’t win.”</p>
<p>Martin Luther King III, the late King’s eldest son, prayed with
Harris on stage. King had campaigned for Harris in the fall and called
her an advocate who “speaks to our better angels” and “embodies
Dr. King’s legacy.”</p>
<p>Many racial justice advocates are set to organize demonstrations,
vigils and community service events to mark the holiday and prepare for
what they consider an adversarial administration.</p>
<p>Some groups are reflecting on parallels and differences with how King
organized in the face of explicitly white supremacist state and local
governments and geopolitical tumult.</p>
<p>“The hostility is similar, particularly in that there is a mobilized,
active and aggressive extremist-right hell bent on unraveling rights and
any sense of shared purpose, shared problems or shared solutions,” said
Maya Wiley, CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.
What differs, Wiley said, is the understanding “there has to be
opportunity for everyone.”</p>
<p>King himself worried the legal protections he dedicated his life to
realizing would not be followed by greater anti-discrimination efforts
or social programs. He proposed it would take white Americans embracing
a deeper kinship with Black Americans and engaging in economic and
social solidarity to see change.</p>
<p>A year before his 1968 assassination, King wrote in his final book
that giving a Black person their “due” often required “special
treatment.”</p>
<p>“I am aware of the fact that this has been a troublesome concept for
many liberals, since it conflicts with their traditional ideal of equal
opportunity and equal treatment of people according to their individual
merits,” King wrote in the 1967 book, “Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos
or Community.” “But this is a day which demands new thinking and the
reevaluation of old concepts.”</p>
<p>King’s advocacy for “new concepts” found an heir in the enactment of
affirmative action policies in workplaces and schools. Many advocates of
diversity, equity and inclusion policies see such programs as realizing
his vision, though that argument has come under withering scrutiny from
conservative activists.</p>
<p>Trump’s views on race have been criticized for decades. The federal
government sued Trump for allegedly discriminating against Black
apartment seekers in the 1970s. He was instrumental in promoting the
“birther” conspiracy theory that Obama was not born in the U.S. And his
campaign rhetoric about immigrants and urban communities since 2015 up
to November’s election has been derided as prejudiced.</p>
<p>As president, Trump enacted some criminal justice reform laws that
civil rights advocates praised but then proposed harsh crackdowns on
2020 racial reckoning protests.</p>
<p>In April, Trump did not dispute the notion that “anti-white racism”
now represents a greater problem in the U.S. than systemic racism
against Black Americans.</p>
<p>“I think there is a definite anti-white feeling in this country and
that can’t be allowed either,” Trump said during an interview with Time
magazine.</p>
<p>Janiyah Thomas, a spokesperson for the Trump transition, said Trump’s
inauguration would be “monumental, turning a new leaf and ushering in
the golden age of America” and said Americans should remember “wise
words” from King: “We must learn to live together as brothers or perish
together as fools.”</p>
<p>At the end of his life, King reflected on the early backlash to civil
rights, especially with integrated housing developments, interracial
marriage and necessary economic and social programs. He expressed
frustration with then-President Lyndon B. Johnson for prolonging the
Vietnam War rather than making a greater investment in anti-poverty
efforts.</p>
<p>“This is where the civil rights movement stands today. We will err
and falter as we climb the unfamiliar slopes of steep mountains, but
there is no alternative, well-trod, level path,” King wrote. “There will
be agonizing setbacks along with creative advances. Our consolation is
that no one can know the true taste of victory if he has never swallowed
defeat.”</p>

<h2 id="donald-trump-set-to-assume-us-presidency-again">Donald Trump set
to assume US presidency again</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Donald Trump returns to the U.S. presidency Monday with an
inauguration ceremony in Washington that will make him the first
president to serve non-consecutive terms since the 1890s.</p>
<p>Millions of Americans are expected to watch on television as the
78-year-old Trump takes the oath of office for a new four-year term in
the White House while President Joe Biden, 82, leaves the presidency
after a single term.  </p>
<p>The inauguration ceremony will be a scaled-down event due to frigid
weather, with about 600 people witnessing the change of power inside the
Capitol instead of the typical outdoor event where 250,000 people had
secured tickets.</p>
<p>The traditional inaugural parade along Pennsylvania Avenue from the
Capitol to the White House has also been canceled because of the
weather, with bands, marching units, drill teams and the like now
parading past Trump, his wife, Melania Trump and other officials in his
new administration at the nearby 20,000-seat Capital One Arena. Lavish
black-tie balls are still planned for Monday evening. </p>
<p>Trump pledged late Sunday to “act with historic speed and strength
and fix every single crisis facing our country,” as he spoke to
supporters in Washington.</p>
<p>“Tomorrow at noon, the curtain closes on four long years of American
decline, and we begin a brand new day of American strength and
prosperity,” Trump said.</p>
<p>He has pledged to sign a flurry of executive orders upon entering
office, including those undoing Biden administration policies. Prominent
among his pledges during the election campaign was carrying out mass
deportations of people who are in the country illegally.</p>
<p>Trump has also vowed to quickly impose heightened tariffs on key
trading partners, including Canada, China and Mexico.  </p>
<p>The incoming president says he plans to pardon many of the 1,500
supporters of his who stormed the Capitol building on Jan. 6, 2021, to
try to block Congress from certifying that Biden won the 2020 election.
Trump has called those arrested and convicted “patriots” and “hostages”
wrongly prosecuted. </p>
<p>Charges that Trump, a Republican, tried to illegally overturn his
2020 election loss to Biden were dropped when he defeated his Democratic
opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, in the 2024 election because of
a long-standing Justice Department policy against prosecuting sitting
presidents.   </p>
<p>Trump will become the first felon to serve as U.S. president, after
his conviction last year on 34 criminal charges linked to falsifying
business records to hide a $130,000 hush money payment to porn film star
Stormy Daniels, although a judge declined to penalize him in any
way. </p>
<p>Trump vowed for months to end Russia’s war on Ukraine before he takes
office, but in recent days his aides have said the goal now is to try to
reach a truce in the fighting in the first 100 days of his
administration, which would be around the end of April. </p>
<p>He also wants more oil drilling in the U.S. even though in 2023, U.S.
energy production exceeded consumption by a record amount, according to
the U.S. Energy Information Administration. </p>
<p>Two transgender issues have also drawn Trump’s attention.  </p>
<p>Trump has repeatedly referred to transgender women as men, telling
his supporters that he will ensure transgender women cannot compete in
women’s sports. </p>
<p>“I will keep men out of women’s sports, 100%, immediately, first
day,” Trump told one political rally during the campaign. He also
frequently has assailed gender-affirming care, which can include hormone
therapy. “On day one, I will revoke Joe Biden’s cruel policies on
so-called ‘gender affirming care.’”</p>

Korea braces for Trump’s policies with biggest-ever export finance
support</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korea pledged on Monday a record amount of
financing support for exporters to mitigate any negative impact from
changes in U.S. trade policies as Donald Trump was poised to be sworn in
for his second presidency.</p>
<p>The government plans to provide 360 trillion won, or $247.74 billion,
worth of policy financing to exporting companies through state-run banks
and institutions this year, according to a statement released by the
finance ministry.</p>
<p>“There are concerns that external uncertainty will be heightened
under the incoming U.S. administration and adversely affect exports,”
the ministry said.</p>
<p>The ministry said it would also boost insurance support to guard
against foreign exchange volatility to $966 million this year, from $827
million last year, and spending on government projects, such as trade
fairs and delegations, to $2 billion from $1.45 billion.</p>
<p>Sectors particularly under threat of new U.S. policies are
semiconductors and rechargeable batteries, the ministry said, whereas
defense, nuclear energy and shipbuilding sectors are seen as more
promising because of room for cooperation with the United States.</p>
<p>U.S. President-elect Trump, who takes office later on Monday, has
pledged to impose stiff tariffs on major trading partners, such as
Mexico, Canada and China, which are also expected to affect South Korean
companies running factories in those countries.</p>
<p>Economists say there are worries that the Trump administration will
introduce trade policies against South Korea too, after Asia’s
fourth-largest economy earned a record-high surplus of $55.7 billion in
trade with the U.S. in 2024, up 25.4% from 2023.</p>
<p>The Korea International Trade Association, South Korea’s biggest
group of exporting companies, projects export growth to slow to 1.8%
this year. Last year, South Korea’s exports rose 8.1% to a record high
of $683.7 billion, as sales to the U.S. rose 10.4%.</p>

<h2 id="the-state-of-the-economy-what-is-donald-trump-inheriting">The
state of the economy: What is Donald Trump inheriting?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Voters prioritized the economy in the 2024 election, sending Donald
Trump back to the White House. But what economic legacy is Joe Biden
passing on to the new administration? </p>
<p>“It’s the economy, stupid.” Coined by political strategist James
Carville, these famous words have become synonymous with U.S. election
success since 1992. </p>
<p>Despite the growing influence of issues like immigration, climate
change and foreign policy, many voters still prioritize economic factors
when casting their ballots. </p>
<p>President-elect Donald Trump claimed he made “the greatest economy in
U.S. history” during his first term and vows to do so again in 2025. But
a lot depends on what a president inherits from his predecessors. </p>
<p>Low unemployment rates and a soaring stock market built under former
President Barack Obama’s administration following the 2008 financial
crisis gave Trump a strong foundation the first time around. </p>
<p>So, what economic legacy will Trump inherit from Biden? </p>
<p>Simply put, high employment rates, strong GDP growth and low
inflation often characterize a healthy economy. </p>
<p>The country was still recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic when
Biden was sworn in, but the last four years have proven resilient. </p>
<p>Biden’s administration created almost 16 million new jobs in America
— a key sign of positive economic growth. </p>
<p>That good news was overshadowed for many Americans by inflation,
which reached a 40-year high in 2022, with prices increasing by 9.1%.
That impacted people’s purchasing power and made everyday items feel
expensive. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Annual inflation has now eased to around 3% but is still higher than
the Federal Reserve’s 2% target, and prices for many items remain
significantly higher than at the end of Trump’s first term.</p>
<p>While real wages have since increased in America, workers may still
feel the strain of stubbornly high grocery prices.</p>
<p>This was a global issue linked to supply chain challenges and
Russia’s war with Ukraine, and ordinary people paid the price. But
massive deficit spending under Biden to head off the threat of a major
recession also contributed.</p>
<p>Biden has preferred to emphasize the promising picture of the jobs
market he’s passing on, noting that the United States recorded its
lowest unemployment rate in more than half a century during his
term. </p>
<p>About 2.7 million jobs were lost during Trump’s first term, partially
due to the COVID-19 pandemic. So, he’ll face pressure to turn that
legacy around. But Trump has already suggested mass layoffs across
federal departments during his second term, which could increase
unemployment rates if implemented. </p>
<p>Another broad signal of a healthy economy is the increased value of
goods and services, or GDP, which shows whether an economy is
growing. </p>
<p>The United States has long had the largest GDP in the world,
surpassing nations such as India and China. </p>
<p>GDP rose 7.6% during Trump’s first administration and increased by
11.8% under Biden, suggesting a strong post-pandemic recovery. </p>
<p>Generally speaking, Biden’s economic legacy is one of high
employment, recovering GDP and declining inflation.</p>
<p>But no president ever inherits a clean slate. The federal debt stands
at $36.1 trillion, and public opinion about the economy is, at best,
lukewarm. </p>
<p>Some financial experts predict inflation may continue declining in
2025, but a broader context of geopolitical tensions, trade wars and
climate change may also shape America’s financial future. </p>
<p>Trump’s task will be to sustain economic momentum while navigating
the complexities of a rapidly evolving world.</p>

id="how-tiktok-grew-from-a-fun-app-for-teens-into-a-potential-national-security-threat">How
TikTok grew from a fun app for teens into a potential national security
threat</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SAN FRANCISCO — If it feels like TikTok has been around forever,
that’s probably because it has, at least if you’re measuring via
internet time. What’s now in question is whether it will be around much
longer and, if so, in what form?</p>
<p>Starting in 2017, when the Chinese social video app merged with its
competitor Musical.ly, TikTok has grown from a niche teen app into a
global trendsetter. While, of course, also emerging as a potential
national security threat, according to U.S. officials.</p>
<p>On April 24, President Joe Biden signed legislation requiring TikTok
parent ByteDance to sell to a U.S. owner within a year or to shut down.
TikTok and its China-based parent company, ByteDance, filed a lawsuit
against the U.S., claiming the security concerns were overblown and the
law should be struck down because it violates the First Amendment.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court on Friday unanimously upheld the federal law
banning TikTok, and the popular short form video service went dark in
the U.S. — just hours before the ban was set to begin.</p>
<p>Here’s how TikTok came to this juncture:</p>
<p>March 2012</p>
<p>ByteDance is founded in China by entrepreneur Zhang Yimin. Its first
hit product is Toutiao, a personalized news aggregator for Chinese
users.</p>
<p>July 2014</p>
<p>Startup Musical.ly, later known for an eponymous app used to post
short lipsyncing music videos, is founded in China by entrepreneur Alex
Zhu.</p>
<p>July 2015</p>
<p>Musical.ly hits #1 in the Apple App Store, following a design change
that made the company’s logo visible when users shared their videos.</p>
<p>2016</p>
<p>ByteDance launches Douyin, a video sharing app for Chinese users. Its
popularity inspires the company to spin off a version for foreign
audiences called TikTok.</p>
<p>November 2017</p>
<p>ByteDance acquires Musical.ly for $1 billion. Nine months later,
ByteDance merges it with TikTok.</p>
<p>Powered by an algorithm that encourages binge-watching, users begin
to share a wide variety of video on the app, including dance moves,
kitchen food preparation and various “challenges” to perform, record and
post acts that range from serious to satirical.</p>
<p>February 2019</p>
<p>Rapper Lil Nas X releases the country-trap song “Old Town Road” on
TikTok, where it goes viral and pushes the song to a record 17 weeks in
the #1 spot on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The phenomenon kicks off a
wave of TikTok videos from musical artists who suddenly see TikTok as a
critical way to reach fans.</p>
<p>TikTok settles federal charges of violating U.S. child-privacy laws
and agrees to pay a $5.7 million fine.</p>
<p>September 2019</p>
<p>The Washington Post reports that while images of Hong Kong democracy
protests and police crackdowns are common on most social media sites,
they are strangely absent on TikTok. The same story notes that TikTok
posts with the #trump2020 tag received more than 70 million views.</p>
<p>The company insists that TikTok content moderation, conducted in the
U.S., is not responsible and says the app is a place for entertainment,
not politics.</p>
<p>The Guardian reports on internal documents that reportedly detail how
TikTok instructs its moderators to delete or limit the reach of videos
touching on topics sensitive to China such as the 1989 Tiananmen Square
protests and subsequent massacre, Tibetan independence or the sanctioned
religious group Falun Gong.</p>
<p>October 2019</p>
<p>U.S. politicians begin to raise alarms about TikTok’s influence,
calling for a federal investigations of its Musical.ly acquisition and a
national security probe into TikTok and other Chinese-owned apps. That
investigation begins in November, according to news reports.</p>
<p>December 2019</p>
<p>The Pentagon recommends that all U.S. military personnel delete
TikTok from all phones, personal and government-issued. Some services
ban the app on military-owned phones. In January, the Pentagon bans the
app from all military phones.</p>
<p>TikTok becomes the second-most downloaded app in the world, according
to data from analytics firm SensorTower.</p>
<p>May 2020</p>
<p>Privacy groups file a complaint alleging TikTok is still violating
U.S. child-protection laws and flouting a 2019 settlement agreement. The
company “takes the issue of safely seriously” and continues to improve
safeguards, it says.</p>
<p>TikTok hires former Disney executive Kevin Mayer as its chief
executive officer in an apparent attempt to improve its U.S. relations.
Mayer resigns three months later.</p>
<p>July 2020</p>
<p>India bans TikTok and dozens of other Chinese apps in response to a
border clash with China.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump says he is considering banning TikTok as
retaliation for China’s alleged mishandling of the COVID-19
pandemic.</p>
<p>August 2020</p>
<p>Trump issues a sweeping but vague executive order banning American
companies from any “transaction” with ByteDance and its subsidiaries,
including TikTok. Several days later, he issues a second order demanding
that ByteDance divest itself of TikTok’s U.S. operations within 90
days.</p>
<p>Microsoft confirms it is exploring acquisition of TikTok. The deal
never materializes; neither does a similar overture from Oracle and

<p>TikTok users in the United States were prevented from watching videos
on the popular social media platform just hours before a federal ban was
set to take effect.</p>
<p>“A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S.,” a message in the
app said. “Unfortunately, that means you can’t use TikTok for now.”</p>
<p>The company’s app was also removed from prominent app stores,
including the ones operated by Apple and Google, while its website told
users that the short-form video platform was no longer available.</p>
<p>Jan. 19, 2025</p>
<p>Shortly after the app went dark for U.S. users, Trump said he would
issue an executive order upon taking office to grant TikTok an extension
so that it could remain online.</p>
<p>A few hours later, TikTok restored service to users in the United
States, saying that Trump had provided “the necessary clarity and
assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties
providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans.”</p>

<h2 id="washington-braces-for-trump-inauguration">Washington braces for
Trump Inauguration</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Metal fences, concrete barriers and security checkpoints
still line many the walkways and cross streets of the National Mall –
extending from the U.S. Capitol down past some of Washington’s most
noted landmarks – as the nation prepares to swear in its 47th
president.</p>
<p>But while the 0.6-square-kilometer (146-acre) swath of land is often
the highlight of many a tourist visit, it is no longer the focus of
security efforts for when President-elect Donald Trump takes the oath of
office for a second time.</p>
<p>Frigid temperatures forecast for much of Monday led Trump to move the
festivities inside – the inauguration to the U.S. Capitol Rotunda and
the traditional inaugural parade to the nearby Capital One Arena.</p>
<p>The changes, first announced Friday, presented a last-minute hitch
for security and law enforcement officials, who had been planning for
the inauguration for the past year.</p>
<p>And it has left them, and the approximately 25,000 law enforcement
and military personnel charged with security, with multiple
challenges.</p>
<p>“We will shift those assets,” said the U.S. Secret Service’s Matt
McCool, briefing reporters Sunday.</p>
<p>“We have not cut anything from what our original plan was,” he said.
“I’m very confident, with our partners here, we will be ready.”</p>
<p>The numbers could make the situation especially trying.</p>
<p>Organizers had expected about 250,000 ticketed guests to descend on
the U.S. Capitol and the National Mall to watch the inauguration.</p>
<p>Only a select few will be allowed into the Capitol Rotunda, which
accommodates just 600 people. And the Capital One Area seats just
20,000.</p>
<p>If even just a fraction of the 250,000 people who had planned on
attending the inauguration try to get to the arena, there could be a
crunch.</p>
<p>Washington Metropolitan Police Chief Pamela Smith said Sunday her
force, bolstered by and about 4,000 police officers from across the
U.S., will be ready.</p>
<p>“Nothing has really changed,” Smith told reporters. “The police
officers that were committed and dedicated to coming here, we’ll be
flexible in how we’ll adjust [their] movement. … So, we will still have
police officers in places and spaces around our city as we initially
planned.”</p>
<p>Some of those officers, Smith said, will still be assigned to the
original parade route in anticipation that some people will try to get a
glimpse of the presidential motorcade as it goes by.</p>
<p>U.S. Capitol Police said they also anticipate having officers on the
periphery of the West Front of the Capitol – now closed off with the
inauguration moved indoors – ready to direct ticketed guests who will no
longer be able to attend.</p>
<p>In addition, the inaugural security contingent, which includes the
U.S. Secret Service, the FBI, U.S. Capitol Police, Washington
Metropolitan Police, and some 7,800 members of the U.S. Army and Air
National Guard, will all be coordinated from a command center linked
into an expanded network of cameras keeping watch on the city.</p>
<p>And though security measures in some areas, including along parts of
the National Mall, have been relaxed, officials said there will be
plenty of reminders for anyone coming to Washington that this is no
ordinary time.</p>
<p>“They will see tactical teams,” McCool said, during an earlier
briefing with reporters last week. “They’ll see, officers and agents on
rooftops, they’ll see checkpoints. They’ll see road closures and
barriers in concrete.”</p>
<p>Even before the inauguration was moved inside, officials had been
preparing for what they described as “a higher threat environment,”
cautioning the security plans for this inauguration were already more
robust than in the past.</p>
<p>“The biggest threat, I think, for all of us remains the lone actor,”
said Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger. “That threat … remains the biggest
justification for us being on this heightened stage state of alert.”</p>
<p>Those concerns were heightened following the New Year’s Day terror
attack and truck ramming in New Orleans and the Las Vegas Cybertruck
explosion outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas,
Nevada.</p>
<p>Earlier this month Capitol Police arrested two men suspected of
trying to disrupt the state funeral for former U.S. President Jimmy
Carter, one who tried to bring knives and a machete into the Capitol and
another who set their car on fire.</p>
<p>Research, including a recent survey by the University of Chicago
Project on Security and Threats, adds to the concerns.</p>
<p>“Over 5% of the American public supports the use of force to prevent
Donald Trump from becoming president,” Robert Pape, the project’s
director, told VOA.</p>
<p>“That equates to 14,000,000 American adults,” he said. “That’s an
unfortunately disturbing number.”</p>
<p>Already, Trump was also the target of two attempted
assassinations.</p>
<p>There is also an ongoing threat from Iran. Despite repeated Iranian
denials, U.S. security and law enforcement officials have accused Tehran
of trying to kill Trump, unveiling one plot set to be carried out last
year, in the days after the U.S. presidential election.</p>
<p>For now, though, U.S. officials see no signs of impending
trouble.</p>
<p>“The FBI is not currently tracking any credible or specific threats
to the inaugural ceremony or the Capitol complex,” the bureau’s
Washington Field Office told VOA. “We will continue to work closely with
our partners to share information and identify and disrupt any threats
that may emerge.”</p>
<p>Another source for concern is the tens of thousands of protesters,
though so far, there have been no major incidents.</p>
<p>Saturday’s People’s March, which was permitted to have as many as
50,000 protesters, sparked only brief tensions with Trump
supporters.</p>
<p>Another group, called We Fight Back, has permits for protests
involving about 10,000 people in across several locations on Monday.</p>
<p>“Please note that [we] will ensure your right to peacefully protest
and assemble,” said the Metropolitan Police Department’s Smith.</p>
<p>“However, I want to reiterate, as I always have, that violence,
destruction and unlawful behavior will not be tolerated,” she said.
“Offenders will face swift and decisive consequences … anyone who thinks
that they can come into this city to destroy property, we will be
prepared to deal with them.”</p>

id="american-journalist-austin-tices-mother-in-damascus-hopes-to-find-missing-son">American
journalist Austin Tice’s mother, in Damascus, hopes to find missing
son</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Damascus, Syria — The mother of American journalist Austin Tice, who
was taken captive during a reporting trip to Syria in August 2012,
arrived in Damascus to step up the search for her son and said she hopes
she can take him home with her.  </p>
<p>Tice, who worked as a freelance reporter for The Washington Post and
McClatchy, was one of the first U.S. journalists to make it into Syria
after the outbreak of the civil war.</p>
<p>His mother, Debra Tice, drove into the Syrian capital from Lebanon
with Nizar Zakka, the head of Hostage Aid Worldwide, an organization
which is searching for Austin and believes he is still in Syria.</p>
<p>“It’d be lovely to put my arms around Austin while I’m here. It’d be
the best,” Debra Tice told Reuters in the Syrian capital Saturday, which
she last visited in 2015 to meet with Syrian authorities about her son,
before they stopped granting her visas.</p>
<p>The overthrow of Bashar al-Assad’s regime in December by Syrian
rebels has allowed her to visit again from her home in Texas.</p>
<p>“I feel very strongly that Austin’s here, and I think he knows I’m
here… I’m here,” she said.</p>
<p>Debra Tice and Zakka are hoping to meet with Syria’s new authorities,
including the head of its new administration Ahmed al-Sharaa, to push
for information about Austin. They are also optimistic that U.S.
President-elect Donald Trump, who will be inaugurated Monday, will take
up the cause.</p>
<p>“I am hoping to get some answers. And of course, you know, we have
[the] inauguration on Monday, and I think that should be a huge change,”
she said.</p>
<p>“I know that President Trump is quite a negotiator, so I have a lot
of confidence there. But now we have an unknown on this (Syrian) side.
It’s difficult to know, if those that are coming in even have the
information about him,” she said.</p>
<p>Her son, now 43, was taken captive in August 2012, while traveling
through the Damascus suburb of Daraya.</p>
<p>Reuters reported earlier that in 2013 Tice, a former Marine, managed
to slip out of his cell and was seen moving between houses in the
streets of Damascus’ upscale Mazzeh neighborhood. The New York Times
first reported that brief escape and recapture.</p>
<p>He was recaptured soon after his escape, likely by forces who
answered directly to Assad, current and former U.S. officials said.</p>
<p>Debra Tice came to Syria in 2012 and 2015 to meet with Syrian
authorities, who never confirmed that Tice was in their custody, both
she and Zakka said.</p>
<p>She criticized outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration,
saying they did not negotiate hard enough for her son’s release, even in
recent months.</p>
<p>“We certainly felt like President Biden was very well positioned to
do everything possible to bring Austin home, right? I mean, this was the
end of his career. This would be a wonderful thing for him to do. So, we
had an expectation. He pardoned his own son, right? So, where’s my
son?”</p>
<p>Debra Tice said her “mind was just spinning” as she drove across the
Lebanese border into Syria and teared up as she spoke about the tens of
thousands whose loved ones were held in Assad’s notorious prison system
and whose fate remains unknown.</p>
<p>“I have a lot in common with a lot of Syrian mothers and families,
and just thinking about how this is affecting them — do they have the
same hope that I do, that they’re going to open a door, that they’re
going to see their loved one?”</p>

id="trumps-inauguration-will-be-first-attended-by-foreign-leaders">Trump’s
inauguration will be first attended by foreign leaders</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>For the first time in U.S. history, a president-elect will welcome
foreign leaders for one of the most American political traditions — the
peaceful transfer of power.</p>
<p>President-elect Donald Trump invited Chinese President Xi Jinping and
conservative world leaders such as Argentine President Javier Milei and
Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni to the inauguration. Xi sent his vice
president as his representative.</p>
<p>No heads of state have previously made an official visit to the U.S.
for the inauguration. Some of them, such as Milei and Paraguay’s
President Santiago Peña, were special guests Saturday night at the
Hispanic Inaugural Ball, where several of Trump’s nominees for key
Cabinet positions made appearances. That included U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio,
chosen to lead the State Department, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., tapped
to head the Health and Human Services Department.</p>
<p>Here is a look at the foreign leaders who are coming to Washington
for the 60th inauguration:</p>
<p>China</p>
<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping was the first foreign leader whose
invitation to the inauguration became public in December. Xi will not
attend but is sending Vice President Han Zheng.</p>
<p>The announcement to dispatch Han was made Friday by the country’s
foreign ministry, and it comes as the rivalry between the U.S. and China
may escalate under Trump. Several of Trump’s Cabinet picks are known
China hawks, including Rubio, who has called China “the most potent,
dangerous and near-peer adversary this nation has ever confronted.”</p>
<p>Trump has vowed to impose tariffs and other measures on China. But
the two leaders spoke on the phone Friday and discussed trade, fentanyl
and TikTok. Trump said the call was a “very good one.”</p>
<p>Argentina</p>
<p>Milei was the first foreign leader to meet with Trump after the
Nov. 5 election, traveling from Buenos Aires to the president-elect’s
Mar-a-Lago club.</p>
<p>Milei is scheduled to attend one of the official inaugural balls that
Trump will attend on Inauguration Day, as well as the swearing-in
ceremony. The self-described “anarcho-capitalist,” who has carried out
an audacious economic agenda in the South American nation, got a hug
from Vivek Ramaswamy, a Trump insider, on stage at Hispanic ball before
delivering remarks.</p>
<p>Ramaswamy called him “an inspiration.” Milei also receives praise
frequently from billionaire Elon Musk for implementing a series of
austerity measures that laid off tens of thousands of government
workers, froze public infrastructure projects and imposed wage and
pension freezes below inflation.</p>
<p>Musk and Ramaswamy will lead a non-governmental effort to cut federal
government spending, regulations and personnel.</p>
<p>Milei hopes good relations with the U.S. could help Argentina reach a
new deal with the International Monetary Fund.</p>
<p>Italy</p>
<p>Meloni is another leader who has recently visited Mar-a-Lago. Her
weekly agenda says she will attend the swearing-in ceremony.</p>
<p>Meloni kept unexpectedly good relations with Democratic President Joe
Biden but is likely to form a more natural alliance with Trump. She is
considered a key interlocutor between Europe and the U.S.</p>
<p>Georgia</p>
<p>Pro-Western former Georgia President Salome Zourabichvili will attend
the ceremony as a guest of Republican U.S. Rep. Joe Wilson. Georgia has
been wracked by protests following a parliamentary election that
opposition groups alleged was rigged.</p>
<p>She has maintained she is still the legitimate leader of the former
Soviet republic after Mikheil Kavelashvili was inaugurated as president
late last month from a party that critics have accused of becoming
increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow. Kavelashvili’s
ruling party has denied those accusations.</p>
<p>Zourabichvili told Fox News that Georgia could be “the big success
for America or the big problem for America” in the region because
“Russia is always trying to dominate.”</p>
<p>France</p>
<p>French President Emmanuel Macron, who met with Trump last month in
Paris during the Notre Dame Cathedral reopening, won’t be at Trump’s
inauguration. But far-right figures from the country have said they are
traveling for the inauguration.</p>
<p>Eric Zemmour, a talk show pundit turned conservative politician, and
his partner, Sarah Knafo, a member of the European Parliament, said they
will attend. Zemmour was convicted multiple times of inciting racist or
religious hatred.</p>
<p>Prominent far-right politician Marion Maréchal said in a statement
that she would go as well. She is a member of the European Parliament
and niece of the leading conservative figure in France eyeing the 2027
presidential election.</p>
<p>Who else?</p>
<p>The offices of Ecuadorean President Daniel Noboa and Paraguayan
President Santiago Pena have said they were invited to the inauguration
and planned to attend.</p>
<p>Pena, a conservative economist turned politician, praised Trump’s
agenda and said at the Hispanic ball that he hoped for deeper ties
between U.S. and Latin America.</p>
<p>Taiwan sent legislative speaker Han Kuo-yu and seven others to
Washington for Trump’s inauguration, but Taiwan’s foreign ministry said
its delegates would not attend the ceremony now that it has been moved
indoors because of cold weather.</p>
<p>Taiwan’s official Central News Agency, citing Taiwan’s foreign
ministry, also reported that the delegates would meet American
politicians and think tank scholars to cement Taiwan-U.S. relations.
It’s unclear if they will meet Trump.</p>
<p>Trump has criticized Taiwan for pulling some of the semiconductor
industry from the U.S., but U.S.-Taiwan relations also significantly
improved during his first term.</p>
<p>On a phone call Friday between Trump and Xi, the Chinese president
urged the incoming U.S. leader to approach the Taiwan issue “with
prudence” because it is about China’s sovereignty and territorial
integrity. Beijing claims the self-governed island as Chinese territory
and vows to annex it by force if necessary.</p>

id="trump-promises-brand-new-day-harsh-immigration-limits-at-pre-inauguration-victory-rally">Trump
promises ‘brand new day,’ harsh immigration limits at pre-inauguration
victory rally</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Donald Trump told thousands of roaring supporters he
would impose severe limits on immigration on his first day in office,
vowing to swiftly fulfill the central promise of his presidential
campaign on Sunday at a rally inside a packed Washington arena a day
before he returns to power.</p>
<p>“By the time the sun sets tomorrow, the invasion of our country will
have come to a halt,” he said to cheers at a “Make America Great Again
Victory Rally” at the Capital One Arena.</p>
<p>Trump repeated his campaign pledge to launch the largest deportation
effort in U.S. history, which would remove millions of immigrants. An
operation of that scale, however, would likely take years and be hugely
costly.</p>
<p>The rally resembled the free-wheeling campaign speeches that have
been a Trump staple since his first White House run in 2016.</p>
<p>“This is the greatest political movement in American history, and 75
days ago, we achieved the most epic political victory our country has
ever seen,” he said. “Starting tomorrow, I will act with historic speed
of strength and fix every single crisis facing our country.”</p>
<p>The event marked his first major address in Washington since his
speech on Jan. 6, 2021, that preceded the storming of the U.S. Capitol
by an angry mob of his supporters. Trump has said he will pardon many of
the more than 1,500 people convicted or charged in connection with the
attack.</p>
<p>Trump said he would “get radical woke ideologies the hell out of our
military” and order the military to construct a missile defense shield
over the U.S., though he has yet to offer details on how to carry it
out.</p>
<p>He also promised to reverse the “over-classification” of government
documents, a seeming reference to his federal indictment for retaining
classified papers after leaving office. That case, along with a separate
federal indictment for plotting to overturn the 2020 election, was
dropped by the Justice Department after Trump won in November.</p>
<p>The indoor hockey and basketball venue will also host some of
Monday’s inauguration festivities after forecasts of bitter cold
prompted officials to move the planned outdoor events inside.</p>
<p>He also pledged to release classified documents relating to the
assassinations of President John F. Kennedy, his brother Robert Kennedy
and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.</p>
<p>Earlier on Sunday, Trump had breakfast with Republican U.S. senators
at Blair House, the guest quarters across from the White House. John
Cornyn, Susan Collins, Ted Cruz, Rick Scott and Tim Scott were among the
attendees seen leaving the event.</p>
<p>He later placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at
Arlington National Cemetery outside Washington. Trump saluted the tomb
as a military bugler played “Taps.”</p>
<p>Ahead of the event, Trump’s fans, many dressed in the campaign’s
trademark red jackets and MAGA hats, waited in a cold, driving rain
along several downtown Washington blocks, some chanting “USA! USA!”</p>
<p>Val Tordjman, 58, had traveled across the country from Denver with
tickets to watch the inauguration. When he heard the ceremony was being
moved inside, notably cutting the size of the in-person audience, he
said, “I felt like crying.”</p>
<p>Tordjman said he planned to spend the night on the street next to the
arena, despite temperatures forecast to plunge to around 19 degrees
Fahrenheit (-7 degrees Celsius). He said he had yet to see Trump in
person.</p>
<p>“This is a once in a lifetime opportunity,” he said.</p>
<p>Large swaths of the streets around the U.S. Capitol and White House
have been blocked off by steel fences since last week, and police were
visible throughout the city.</p>
<p>TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew planned to attend the rally, hours after the
company announced it was restoring its service thanks to Trump’s promise
to delay a U.S. ban that took effect on Sunday. Chew is also expected to
join other tech executives at Trump’s inauguration on Monday, including
the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, a close Trump confidant who made a
brief appearance on stage with Trump.</p>
<p>Trump took credit for bringing TikTok back online and said the U.S.
would do a “joint venture” to save the app alongside bidders to buy the
company.</p>
<p>The inauguration is scheduled for noon ET (1700 GMT) on Monday, when
Trump will take the presidential oath of office inside the rotunda of
the Capitol building, after the cold weather prompted organizers to move
the ceremony indoors. Approximately 25,000 law enforcement personnel
will be on hand to provide security.</p>

marine sanctuary protects waters from oil drilling</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>After President Joe Biden announced a ban on oil and gas drilling off
most of the U.S. coastline in early January, President-elect Donald
Trump quickly vowed to reverse it after he takes office on January 20.
But there is one section of the California coast that has gained more
permanent protection from drilling - a new national marine sanctuary.

Los Angeles firefighters brace for ‘last’ dangerous winds</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Los Angeles — Exhausted Los Angeles firefighters braced Sunday for
the return of yet more dangerously strong gusts, as California’s
governor slammed “hurricane-force winds of misinformation” surrounding
blazes that have killed 27 people.  </p>
<p>The two largest fires, which have obliterated almost 16,000 hectares
(40,000 acres) and razed entire neighborhoods of the second biggest U.S.
city, were for the first time both more than half contained, officials
announced.</p>
<p>But the National Weather Service warned that powerful winds and low
humidity would again bring “dangerous high-end red flag fire weather
conditions” from Monday, with gusts up to 130 kilometers (80 miles) per
hour potentially returning.</p>
<p>“This is the last… we hope, of the extreme” wind events, said
Governor Gavin Newsom.</p>
<p>It will be “the fourth major wind event just in the last three months
— we only had two in the prior four years,” he told MSNBC’s “Inside with
Jen Psaki” show.</p>
<p>Officials were accused of being unprepared for the outbreak of fires
this month. Now, 135 fire engines and their crews are prepositioned to
tackle new outbreaks, along with helicopters and bulldozers, said
Newsom.</p>
<p>Firefighters, who since Jan. 7 have been battling flames, digging
trenches and uprooting vegetation to create perimeters around fires
non-stop, said the largest conflagration, the Palisades Fire, was 52%
contained.</p>
<p>That fire has killed at least 10 people.</p>
<p>Evacuation orders were lifted this weekend for dozens of
neighborhoods in upscale western Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Farther east, the Eaton Fire, which killed at least 17 in the
Altadena suburbs, is 81% contained.</p>
<p>More residents were able to return to their homes there too. Others
reunited with missing pets they had feared were dead.</p>
<p>Serena Null told AFP of her joy at finding her cat, Domino, after
having to leave him behind as flames devoured her family home in
Altadena.</p>
<p>The pair were reunited at NGO Pasadena Humane, where Domino —
suffering singed paws, a burnt nose and a high level of stress — was
taken after being rescued.</p>
<p>“I just was so relieved and just so happy that he was here,” a
tearful Null told AFP.   </p>
<p>No ‘magical spigot’  </p>
<p>As Los Angeles learns the true scale of the devastation, political
bickering has intensified.</p>
<p>Donald Trump, set to be sworn in Monday as U.S. president, has
sharply criticized California officials.</p>
<p>He falsely claimed that Newsom had blocked the diversion of “excess
rain and snow melt from the North.” Los Angeles’s water supplies are
mainly fed via aqueducts and canals originating from entirely separate
river basins farther east.</p>
<p>“What’s not helpful or beneficial… is these wild-eyed fantasies… that
somehow there’s a magical spigot in northern California that just can be
turned on, all of a sudden there will be rain or water flowing
everywhere,” said Newsom.</p>
<p>Citing conversations with firefighters on the ground during 100
mile-per-hour windstorms that first sparked the fires, Newsom added:
“There’s not a municipal system in the world that’s designed to address
a fire of that acuity.”  </p>
<p>The governor blamed Elon Musk — the Tesla and SpaceX owner poised to
play a key role advising the incoming administration — “and others” for
“hurricane-force winds of mis- and dis-information that can divide a
country on a myriad of issues.”</p>
<p>President-elect Trump said he hopes to visit the region soon,
“probably at the end of the week.”</p>
<p>Emergency officials Sunday continued to survey the damage, going
house-to-house with dogs in search of human remains, and ramping up the
daunting task of clearing endless tons of debris.</p>
<p>The region has experienced its driest start of the year since 1850,
according to Newsom. Well into its typical rainy season, Los Angeles has
had almost no rain since May.</p>
<p>Although rain is still not expected imminently, Newsom warned of the
need to prepare “for potential flooding in the next week or two,” as
rain, when it comes, pours down hillsides denuded by the fires.</p>
<p>“I prepositioned 2,500 National Guard. We’re going to start some
sandbagging operations,” he said.</p>
<p>“We’re dealing with extremes that we have never dealt with in the
past” due to the changing climate, said the governor.</p>

<h2 id="keke-palmers-one-of-them-days-mufasa-race-for-no.-1">Keke
Palmer’s ‘One of Them Days,’ ‘Mufasa’ race for No. 1</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Keke Palmer buddy comedy “One of Them Days” opened
in first place on the North American box office charts on a particularly
slow Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend. </p>
<p>The R-rated Sony release earned $11.6 million from 2,675 theaters,
according to studio estimates Sunday, beating Disney’s “Mufasa: The Lion
King” by a hair. By the end of Monday’s holiday, “Mufasa” will have the
edge, however. </p>
<p>“One of Them Days” cost only $14 million to produce, which it is
expected to earn by Monday. The very well-reviewed buddy comedy stars
Palmer and SZA as friends and roommates scrambling to get money for rent
before their landlord evicts them. Notably it’s the first Black
female-led theatrical comedy since “Girls Trip” came out in 2017 and it
currently carries a stellar 96% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. </p>
<p>But the marketplace was also quite weak overall. The total box office
for Friday, Saturday and Sunday will add up to less than $80 million,
according to data from Comscore, making it one of the worst Martin
Luther King Jr. holiday weekends since 1997. </p>
<p>“For an individual film like ‘One of Them Days’ this was a great
weekend,” said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for
Comscore. “You can still find success stories within what is overall a
low grossing weekend for movie theaters.” </p>
<p>The Walt Disney Co.’s “Mufasa” was close by in second place with
$11.5 million from the weekend, its fifth playing in theaters. Globally,
the Barry Jenkins-directed prequel has made $588 million. It even beat a
brand-new offering, the Blumhouse horror “Wolf Man,” which debuted in
third place with $10.6 million from 3,354 North American theaters. </p>
<p>Writer-director Leigh Whannell’s monster tale starring Christopher
Abbott and Julia Garner did not enter theaters with great reviews. It
currently carries a 53% on Rotten Tomatoes. Reviews don’t generally
affect the success of horror movies in their first weekend, but
audiences also gave it a lackluster C- CinemaScore in exit polls. The
Blumhouse production and Universal Pictures release cost a reported $25
million to make and is expected to reach $12 million by the close of
Monday’s holiday. </p>
<p>“Sonic the Hedgehog 3” was in fourth place with $8.6 million and “Den
of Thieves 2” rounded out the top five with $6.6 million. </p>
<p>In specialty releases, Brady Corbert’s 215-minute post-war epic “The
Brutalist” expanded to 388 screens where it made nearly $2 million over
the weekend. A24 reported that it sold out various 70mm and IMAX
showings. The studio also re-released its Colman Domingo drama “Sing
Sing” in theaters and prisons, where over 1 million incarcerated people
in 46 states were able to view the film. </p>
<p>The Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend has seen major successes
in the past. Dergarabedian noted “Bad Boys for Life,” which had a
three-day opening of $62.5 million in 2020, and “American Sniper,” which
earned $89.3 in its first weekend in wide release in 2016. </p>
<p>“This is a year that’s going to get a big boost starting with
‘Captain America: Brave New World’ and ‘Paddington in Peru’ in
February,” Dergarabedian said. </p>
<p>Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian
theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released
Monday. </p>

<h2 id="donald-trump-set-to-assume-us-presidency-again-1">Donald Trump
set to assume US presidency again</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A hallmark of the nearly 250-year American democracy is the
quadrennial peaceful transfer of presidential power, and it is set to
unfold again on Monday, with Donald Trump, the 45th president until he
lost his 2020 reelection bid, set to be inaugurated as the country’s
47th leader after winning last November’s election.</p>
<p>Millions of Americans are expected to watch on television as the
78-year-old Trump takes the oath of office for a new four-year term in
the White House while President Joe Biden, 82, leaves the presidency
after a single term.</p>
<p>But only about 600 people will see Trump sworn in live, with the
ceremony moved into the U.S. Capitol Rotunda at Trump’s behest. An
arrival Sunday night of an Arctic blast of frigid air into Washington
could push the temperature to -6 Celsius at noon on Monday, when the
traditional outdoor swearing-in ceremony would normally be held on the
steps of the Capitol overlooking the National Mall.</p>
<p>It is expected to be the coldest Inauguration Day in Washington in 40
years, when Ronald Reagan’s second inauguration was also moved inside in
1985.</p>
<p>About 250,000 tickets to Trump’s planned outdoor ceremony on the
Capitol steps had been handed out to his supporters and dignitaries but
inaugural officials said they now can simply keep the ducats as
commemorative souvenirs.</p>
<p>The traditional inaugural parade along Pennsylvania Avenue from the
Capitol to the White House has also been canceled because of the
weather, with bands, marching units, drill teams and the like now
parading past Trump, his wife, Melania Trump and other officials in his
new administration at the nearby 20,000-seat Capital One Arena, with
thousands of other celebrants literally left out in the cold. Lavish
black-tie balls are still planned for Monday evening.</p>
<p>Trump’s ascendancy to power again comes with some historical
footnotes: He will become the first felon to serve as U.S. president,
after his conviction last year on 34 criminal charges linked to
falsifying business records to hide a $130,000 hush money payment to
porn film star Stormy Daniels, although a judge declined to penalize him
in any way.</p>
<p>Charges that Trump, a Republican, tried to illegally overturn his
2020 election loss to Biden were dropped when he defeated his Democratic
opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, in the 2024 election because of
a long-standing Justice Department policy against prosecuting sitting
presidents.</p>
<p>Trump will also become the second U.S. president to serve a second
nonconsecutive term, after Grover Cleveland in the 1890s.</p>
<p>Beyond the pomp and circumstances of U.S. inaugurals, both Trump’s
supportive Republican colleagues and opposition Democrats will be
closely watching to see what policy changes he quickly announces with
executive orders to undo Biden edicts or simply to push forward with
planks from his winning campaign against Harris.</p>
<p>Trump’s Day 1 promises are wide-ranging, but whether he signs orders
affecting all of them or spreads out some of them to the coming days is
not certain.</p>
<p>Perhaps his most persistent claim from the campaign trail is that he
plans to deport more than 11 million undocumented migrants living in the
United States, starting with migrants who have been convicted of crimes
and then others who have been ordered to return to their home countries
after losing asylum bids to stay in the U.S.</p>
<p>But an apparent Trump plan to begin the immigration crackdown on
Tuesday in Chicago leaked to U.S. media outlets, leaving Trump’s
handpicked “border czar,” Tom Homan, to say that that the timing of the
deportation plan is now being reconsidered.</p>
<p>“We’re looking at this leak and will make a decision based on this
leak,” Homan told The Washington Post. “It’s unfortunate because anyone
leaking law enforcement operations puts officers at greater risk.”</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Homan said the Immigration and Customs Enforcement
agency “will start arresting public safety threats and national security
threats on day one. We’ll be arresting people across the country,
uninhibited by any prior (Biden) administration guidelines. Why Chicago
was mentioned specifically, I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“This is nationwide thing,” he said. “We’re not sweeping
neighborhoods. We have a targeted enforcement plan.”</p>
<p>Trump has also vowed to close the southwestern U.S. border with
Mexico and force would-be asylum-seekers to remain in Mexico while their
claims to stay in the U.S. are adjudicated.</p>
<p>All of his get-tough-on-migrant plans are sure to draw legal
challenges from advocates supporting those seeking a new life in the
U.S., possibly leaving Trump’s actions in limbo for extended periods,
weeks, maybe months.</p>
<p>Related to immigration, Trump says he wants to end birthright
citizenship for anyone born in the United States, although it is part of
the U.S. Constitution, so it is not clear how he plans to try to do that
unilaterally.</p>
<p>Trump has also vowed to quickly impose heightened tariffs on key
trading partners, including Canada, China and Mexico.</p>
<p>The incoming president says he plans to pardon many of the 1,500
supporters of his who stormed the Capitol building on Jan. 6, 2021, to
try to block Congress from certifying that Biden won the 2020 election.
Trump has called those arrested and convicted “patriots” and “hostages”
wrongly prosecuted.</p>
<p>It is not clear whether Trump will pardon only those convicted of
relatively minor offenses or include those convicted of attacking the
140 law enforcement officials who were injured in the mayhem four years
ago.</p>
<p>Trump vowed for months to end Russia’s war on Ukraine before he takes
office, but in recent days his aides have said the goal now is to try to
reach a truce in the fighting in the first 100 days of his
administration, which would be around the end of April.</p>
<p>Trump also wants more oil drilling in the U.S. even though in 2023,
U.S. energy production exceeded consumption by a record amount,
according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.</p>
<p>Two transgender issues have also drawn Trump’s attention.</p>
<p>Trump has repeatedly referred to transgender women as men, telling
his supporters that he will ensure transgender women cannot compete in
women’s sports.</p>
<p>“I will keep men out of women’s sports, 100%, immediately, first
day,” Trump told one political rally during the campaign. He also
frequently has assailed gender-affirming care, which can include hormone
therapy. “On day one, I will revoke Joe Biden’s cruel policies on
so-called ‘gender affirming care.’”</p>

<h2
id="heavy-snow-frigid-arctic-blast-put-70-million-across-us-under-winter-storm-warnings">Heavy
snow, frigid Arctic blast put 70 million across US under winter storm
warnings</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Boston — Tens of millions of residents along the East Coast are
bracing for several centimeters of snow Sunday followed by dangerously
cold temperatures that will take hold in much of the country from the
Northern Plains to the tip of Maine.</p>
<p>Winter storm warnings issued by the National Weather Service have
already gone into effect for parts of the Mid-Atlantic through Monday
morning, with the forecast projecting up to 15 centimeters of snow.
Warnings will begin in New England on Sunday afternoon, with parts of
Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Maine and Connecticut seeing as much as 25
centimeters of snow.</p>
<p>Marc Chenard, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in
College Park, Maryland, projected that as many as 70 million residents
will be under some kind of winter storm hazards warning in the coming
days including in New England and the Mid-Atlantic. Large cities like
Philadelphia, New York and Boston could see several centimeters of snow
this evening with the highest totals being outside of major cities.</p>
<p>“There will certainly be some more hazardous road conditions anywhere
from D.C. up the whole I-95 corridor and then inland from there later
today and tonight,” Chenard said. “Then it gets quite cold behind that.
By Monday morning, any roads that haven’t been treated or cleared will
still likely be some hazardous travel conditions.”</p>
<p>Return of the Arctic blast</p>
<p>But the snow is just the start of a chaotic week of weather.</p>
<p>Much of the eastern half of the United States will be enduring some
of the coldest temperatures this winter, if not for several years.</p>
<p>An area from the Rockies into the Northern Plains will see colder
than normal temperatures starting Sunday into the coming week, with
temperatures dropping to minus 34 degrees C to minus 48 C on Sunday and
Monday. Wind chills of minus 40 C were already being clocked in parts of
North Dakota and Minnesota. Sub-zero wind chills are forecast to reach
as far south as Oklahoma and the Tennessee Valley.</p>
<p>The cold weather forecast for Monday for Washington, D.C., prompted
President-elect Donald Trump’s inaugural ceremony to be moved inside the
U.S. Capitol Rotunda.</p>
<p>“It’s going to be a cold day in Washington, D.C. on Monday. That’s
for sure,” Chenard said, noting temperatures will be in the 20s with
wind gust upwards of 48 kph.</p>
<p>As happened earlier this month, this latest cold snap comes from a
disruption in the polar vortex, the ring of cold air usually trapped
about the North Pole.</p>
<p>The cold air will moderate as it moves southward and eastward, but
the central and eastern U.S. will still be cold with highs in the teens
and 20s on Monday into Tuesday, Chenard said. The Mid-Atlantic and
Northeast also will have highs in the teens and 20s, lows in the single
digits and below minus 18 C and wind chills below zero.</p>
<p>Unusual wintry mix</p>
<p>The colder temperatures will reach down into the South early this
week, where as many as 30 million people starting Monday could see a
wintry mix of snow, sleet and freezing rain. The unusual conditions are
expected to stretch from Texas into northern Florida and the Carolinas.
Impacts are expected to start in Texas on Monday night and spread across
the Gulf Coast and Southeast on Tuesday into Wednesday.</p>
<p>A combination of frigid air with a low pressure system over the Gulf
is behind the storm, which could bring heavy snow just south of the
Interstate 20 corridor across northern Louisiana and into Mississippi
and a mix of snow, sleet, and freezing rain near the Interstate 10
corridor from Houston to Mobile, Alabama.</p>
<p>Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry on Saturday issued a state of emergency in
advance of the wintry weather. He encouraged Louisianans to be prepared
and to monitor the weather forecast.</p>

<h2 id="implementing-gaza-ceasefire-will-be-up-to-trump">Implementing
Gaza ceasefire will be up to Trump</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WHITE HOUSE — A ceasefire in Gaza began Sunday after Israel’s Cabinet
approved a deal, with 24 ministers voting in favor and eight ministers
rejecting the agreement. The deal was scheduled to be implemented
beginning Sunday. But on Saturday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said it would not start unless Hamas provided a list of the
three hostages set for release Sunday.</p>
<p>Hamas ultimately provided the names and Israel said the ceasefire
would begin at 11:15 a.m.</p>
<p>The deal to end the fighting between Israel and Hamas was achieved
after more than a year of negotiations, with mediation from the United
States, Qatar and Egypt. U.S. President Joe Biden first endorsed the
deal in May. The warring parties agreed to it on Wednesday, and it was
subsequently approved by the Israeli Cabinet early Saturday in
Israel.</p>
<p>Starting midday on Monday when President-elect Donald Trump is
inaugurated, it will be up to his administration to see that the deal is
enforced.</p>
<p>The agreement has three phases, each of which will last six weeks.
The terms of phases two and three are still being negotiated, but under
phase one the cessation of hostilities is expected to continue if six
weeks pass before the next phase is finalized.</p>
<p>Phase one includes withdrawal of Israeli forces from densely
populated areas and more aid for Gaza, as well as the release of some
Palestinians detained in Israeli prisons and some hostages held by
Hamas, including Americans. The U.S. and other Western countries have
designated Hamas as a terrorist group.</p>
<p>The release of American hostages is a “fundamental component” of
Trump’s interest in ending the war swiftly, according to Ahmed Fouad
Alkhatib, resident senior fellow with the Scowcroft Middle East Security
Initiative at the Atlantic Council’s Middle East Programs.</p>
<p>Whether Trump will sustain pressure for the deal to proceed to phase
two, when all of the hostages are set to be released, and to phase
three, when reconstruction of Gaza will begin, remains to be seen,
Alkhatib told VOA.</p>
<p>Alkhatib expressed concern that after the first phase Trump will be
“so disinterested” in Gaza that the agreement will amount to “little
more than a freezing of the conflict.” This would be disastrous for
Palestinians in Gaza and the goal of Palestinian statehood, he
added.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said late Friday that he
had received “unequivocal guarantees” from Biden and Trump that if
negotiations on phase two fail, Israel “will return to intense fighting
with the backing of the United States.”</p>
<p>Hamas militants killed about 1,200 people and captured about 250
hostages in their Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel that sparked the
current war. Israel says Hamas is still holding 101 hostages, including
35 the military says are dead.</p>
<p>Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 46,000
Palestinians, according to the territory’s Health Ministry, which does
not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count.</p>
<p>Two-state solution</p>
<p>The Biden administration’s goal has been Palestinian statehood under
the two-state solution. This could pave the way to bringing Saudi Arabia
into the Abraham Accords — the 2020 deal brokered under the first Trump
administration that normalized diplomatic relations between Israel and
its Arab neighbors, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain.</p>
<p>Biden had sought to expand the accords to include Saudi Arabia, which
maintains it will not consider normalizing relations until Israel
commits to a “credible path” to a Palestinian state. Washington and
Riyadh had been exploring the expansion through a package that would
include, among other offers, American security guarantees for the
Saudis. Those efforts stalled after the Oct. 7 Hamas onslaught.</p>
<p>Now Trump appears to be aiming to use the momentum of the Gaza
ceasefire to add Saudi Arabia into the accords.</p>
<p>“We will continue promoting PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH throughout the
region, as we build upon the momentum of this ceasefire to further
expand the Historic Abraham Accords,” Trump posted on social media
Wednesday following the announcement that a ceasefire deal has been
reached.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia has never formally recognized Israel since its creation
in 1948. As a de facto leader of the Arab and Islamic world, Riyadh’s
recognition would represent a breakthrough for the Jewish state.</p>
<p>Trump’s main objective now is to ensure that whatever happens in Gaza
does not prevent him from securing that deal, while Israel’s goal is to
ensure whatever happens in Gaza doesn’t prevent cooperation with the
U.S. over Iran, said Jonathan Rynhold, head of the department of
political studies at Bar Ilan University.</p>
<p>“So, I’m not sure that it makes sense to think beyond the first phase
at this point,” Rynhold told VOA.</p>
<p>Trump and Israel will “work out their positions on Gaza precisely
against the shadow of those two things,” he added.</p>
<p>Trump’s role in securing the deal</p>
<p>In the same social media post Wednesday, Trump took credit for his
role in securing the ceasefire.</p>
<p>“This EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result
of our Historic Victory in November, as it signaled to the entire World
that my Administration would seek Peace and negotiate deals to ensure
the safety of all Americans, and our Allies,” Trump wrote.</p>
<p>For months the Biden administration has progressively included
Trump’s team in peace talks, beginning with an Oval Office meeting a
week after Trump won the election. At that Nov. 13 meeting, Biden
proposed that they work together to push the deal through.</p>
<p>“We’ve sent a signal to the incoming team that we’re prepared to work
with them on this issue,” national security adviser Jake Sullivan told
reporters that day.</p>
<p>Shortly after, Sullivan and Biden’s top Middle East adviser, Brett
McGurk, began coordinating with their successors on the Trump team, Mike
Waltz and Steve Witkoff, said a senior administration official who spoke
with reporters on background Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Biden official said that in the final days leading up to the
ceasefire, Witkoff worked in tandem with McGurk in an “almost
unprecedented,” cross-administration partnership that was “highly
constructive, very fruitful.” But he declined to elaborate on Witkoff’s
and Trump’s role in securing the deal, other than saying that the
presidential transition provided a “natural” deadline for a diplomatic
breakthrough.</p>
<p>Pressure on Israel</p>
<p>Critics have accused Biden of failing to use U.S. military support as
leverage over Netanyahu to reach a deal or moderate Israel’s campaign,
which has taken tens of thousands of Palestinian lives.</p>
<p>Publicly, Biden officials have largely echoed Israel in faulting
Hamas for the failure of the talks. But some Israeli security officials
and many observers also blame Netanyahu for blocking progress, including
by repeatedly introducing fresh demands in negotiations.</p>
<p>With Trump’s victory, Netanyahu’s calculations may have changed, said
Laura Blumenfeld, senior fellow at the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced
International Studies.</p>
<p>“Trump injected a kind of fear factor into this process that was
missing before,” she told VOA. “He can’t triangulate anymore the way he
would play Biden off of the Republican Congress. There’s nowhere for
Netanyahu to run, nowhere to hide, and so he took this deal he couldn’t
refuse.”</p>
<p>Trump’s pressure may have also created space for Netanyahu to resist
ultimatums from far-right allies who had threatened to leave his
governing coalition if a ceasefire deal is made, which would mean an end
to the prime minister’s term.</p>
<p>Eight Israeli far-right politicians, including National Security
Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, rejected
the deal, but it is still unclear whether they will leave the
coalition.</p>
<p>“Netanyahu finally called their bluff,” Blumenfeld said. “Or maybe
actually, Trump called Netanyahu’s bluff, because he was using these
right-wing Cabinet members all along as an excuse not to make the
concessions that he didn’t want to make.”</p>

id="biden-posthumously-pardons-black-nationalist-marcus-garvey">Biden
posthumously pardons Black nationalist Marcus Garvey</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — President Joe Biden on Sunday posthumously pardoned
Black nationalist Marcus Garvey, who influenced Malcolm X and other
civil rights leaders and was convicted of mail fraud in the 1920s. Also
receiving pardons were a top Virginia lawmaker and advocates for
immigrant rights, criminal justice reform and gun violence
prevention. </p>
<p>Congressional leaders had pushed for Biden to pardon Garvey, with
supporters arguing that Garvey’s conviction was politically motivated
and an effort to silence the increasingly popular leader who spoke of
racial pride. After Garvey was convicted, he was deported to Jamaica,
where he was born. He died in 1940. </p>
<p>The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. said of Garvey: “He was the first
man, on a mass scale and level” to give millions of Black people “a
sense of dignity and destiny.” </p>
<p>It’s not clear whether Biden, who leaves office Monday, will pardon
people who have been criticized or threatened by President-elect Donald
Trump. </p>
<p>Issuing preemptive pardons — for actual or imagined offenses by
Trump’s critics that could be investigated or prosecuted by the incoming
administration — would stretch the powers of the presidency in untested
ways. </p>
<p>Biden has set the presidential record for most individual pardons and
commutations issued. He announced on Friday that he was commuting the
sentences of almost 2,500 people convicted of nonviolent drug offenses.
He also gave a broad pardon for his son Hunter, who was prosecuted for
gun and tax crimes. </p>
<p>The president has announced he was commuting the sentences of 37 of
the 40 people on federal death row, converting their punishments to life
imprisonment just as Trump, an outspoken proponent of expanding capital
punishment, takes office. In his first term, Trump presided over an
unprecedented number of executions, 13, in a protracted timeline during
the coronavirus pandemic. </p>
<p>A pardon relieves a person of guilt and punishment. A commutation
reduces or eliminates the punishment but doesn’t exonerate the
wrongdoing. </p>
<p>Among those pardoned on Sunday were: </p>
<p>— Don Scott, who is the speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates in
a chamber narrowly controlled by Democrats. He was convicted of a drug
offense in 1994 and served eight years in prison. He was elected to the
Virginia legislature in 2019, and later became the first Black
speaker. </p>
<p>“I am deeply humbled to share that I have received a Presidential
Pardon from President Joe Biden for a mistake I made in 1994 — one that
changed the course of my life and taught me the true power of
redemption,” Scott said in a statement. </p>
<p>—Immigrant rights activist Ravi Ragbir, who was convicted of a
nonviolent offence in 2001 and was sentenced to two years in prison and
was facing deportation to Trinidad and Tobago. </p>
<p>—Kemba Smith Pradia, who was convicted of a drug offense in 1994 and
sentenced to 24 years behind bars. She has since become a prison reform
activist. President Bill Clinton commuted her sentence in 2000. </p>
<p>—Darryl Chambers of Wilmington, Delaware, a gun violence prevention
advocate who was convicted of a drug offense and sentenced to 17 years
in prison. He studies and writes about gun violence prevention. </p>
<p>Biden commuted the sentences of two people: </p>
<p>—Michelle West, who was serving life in prison for her role in a drug
conspiracy case in the early 1990s. West has a daughter who has written
publicly about the struggle of growing up with a mother behind
bars. </p>
<p>—Robin Peoples, who was convicted of robbing banks in northwest
Indiana in the late 1990s and was sentenced to 111 years in prison. The
White House said in a statement that Peoples would have faced
significantly lower sentences today under current laws.</p>

Treasury Department imposes sanctions on Chinese company over Salt
Typhoon hack</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Treasury Department on Friday imposed sanctions
on alleged hacker Yin Kecheng and cybersecurity company Sichuan Juxinhe
Network Technology Co., accusing both of being involved in a series of
hacks against American telecom companies.</p>
<p>The intrusions, known under the name Salt Typhoon, have allegedly
exposed a huge swath of Americans’ call logs to Chinese spies and
rattled the U.S. intelligence community. In some cases, hackers are
alleged to have intercepted conversations, including between prominent
U.S. politicians and government officials. Some lawmakers have described
them as the worst telecom hacks in U.S. history.</p>
<p>In a statement, the Treasury described Sichuan Juxinhe Network
Technology Co. as a hacking company with strong ties to China’s Ministry
of State Security, an intelligence agency. It said that Yin Kecheng was
based in Shanghai, had worked as a hacker for more than a decade, and
also had ties to the MSS. It further alleged he was tied to the recent
breach at the U.S. Treasury.</p>
<p>Reuters was not immediately able to reach Yin Kecheng or Sichuan
Juxinhe. China’s embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a
request for comment.</p>
<p>Beijing routinely denies responsibility for cyberespionage
campaigns.</p>

id="new-documentary-questions-who-took-famous-napalm-attack-photo">New
documentary questions who took famous napalm attack photo</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>It is one of the 20th century’s most memorable images: a naked girl,
screaming, running from a napalm bombing during the Vietnam War. More
than a half-century later, a new documentary is calling into question
who took it — and the retired Associated Press photographer long
credited for the photo insists it was his, while his longtime employer
says it has no evidence of anyone else being behind the camera. </p>
<p>The film about the Pulitzer Prize-winning picture, “The Stringer,” is
scheduled to debut next week at the Sundance Film Festival. Both
photographer Nick Ut and his longtime employer are contesting it
vigorously, and Ut’s lawyer is seeking to block the premiere,
threatening a defamation lawsuit. The AP, which conducted its own
investigation over six months, concluded it has “no reason to believe
anyone other than Ut took the photo.” </p>
<p>The picture of Kim Phuc running down a road in the village of Trang
Bang, crying and naked because she had taken off clothes burning from
napalm, instantly became symbolic of the horrors of the Vietnam
War. </p>
<p>Taken on June 8, 1972, the photo is credited to Ut, then a
21-year-old staffer in AP’s Saigon bureau. He was awarded the Pulitzer a
year later. Now 73, he moved to California after the war and worked for
the AP for 40 years until retiring in 2017. </p>
<p>The film’s allegations open an unexpected new chapter for an image
that, within hours of it being taken, was beamed around the planet and
became one of the most indelible photographs of both the Vietnam War and
the turbulent century that produced it. Whatever the truth, the film’s
investigations apparently relate only to the identity of the
photographer and not the image’s overall authenticity. </p>
<p>The dispute puts the filmmakers, who call the episode “a scandal
behind the making of one of the most-recognized photographs of the 20th
century,” at odds with Ut, whose work that day defined his career. It
also puts them at cross purposes with the AP, a global news organization
for whom accuracy is a foundational part of the business model. </p>
<p>How did the questioning of the photo begin? </p>
<p>It’s difficult, so many years later, to overestimate the wallop that
this particular image packed. Ron Burnett, an expert on images and
former president of the Emily Carr University of Art and Design, called
it “earth-shattering.” </p>
<p>“It changed the way photos have always been thought about and broke
the rules for how much violence you can show to the public,” Burnett
said. </p>
<p>The photo sat unchallenged for much of its 53-year existence. All
these years later, a counter-narrative has emerged that it was instead
taken by another person, someone who worked for NBC News at the time and
also lives now in California. The person allegedly had delivered his
film to the AP’s office as a “stringer,” a non-staff member who provides
material to a news organization. </p>
<p>The husband-and-wife team of Gary Knight, founder of the VII
Foundation, and producer Fiona Turner are behind the film. On his
website, Knight described “The Stringer” as “a story that many in our
profession did not want told, and some of them continue to go to great
lengths to make sure isn’t told.” </p>
<p>“The film grapples with questions of authorship, racial injustice and
journalistic ethics while shining a light on the fundamental yet often
unrecognized contributions of local freelancers who provide the
information we need to understand how events worldwide impact us all,”
Knight wrote. </p>
<p>Knight did not return a message seeking comment from the AP on
Thursday. A representative from Sundance also did not return a message
about a cease-and-desist letter from Ut’s lawyer, James Hornstein,
trying to stop the film’s airing. Hornstein would not make Ut available
for an interview, saying he anticipated future litigation. </p>
<p>Knight and Turner met with AP in London last June about the
allegations. According to the AP, filmmakers requested the news
organization sign a non-disclosure agreement before they provided their
evidence. AP declined. </p>
<p>That hampered the AP’s own investigation, along with the passage of
time. Horst Faas, chief of photos for AP in Saigon in 1972, and Yuichi
“Jackson” Ishizaki, who developed Ut’s film, are both dead. Many of the
Saigon bureau’s records were lost when communists took over the city,
including any dealings with “the stringer.” Negatives of photos used
back then are preserved in AP’s corporate archives in New York, but they
provided no insight for the investigation. </p>
<p>Still, the AP decided to release its own findings before seeing “The
Stringer” and the details of the claim that it is making. “AP stands
prepared to review any evidence and take whatever remedial action might
be needed if their thesis is proved true,” the news organization
said. </p>
<p>Some who were there are sure about what happened </p>
<p>The AP said it spoke to seven surviving people who were in Trang Bang
or AP’s Saigon bureau that day, and all maintain they have no reason to
doubt their own conclusions that Ut had taken the photo. </p>
<p>One was Fox Butterfield, a renowned longtime New York Times reporter,
who also said that he was contacted by Turner for the documentary. “I
told them what my memory was and they didn’t like it, but they just went
ahead anyway,” Butterfield told AP. </p>
<p>Another was photographer David Burnett, who said he witnessed Ut and
Alexander Shimkin, a freelance photographer working primarily for
Newsweek, taking photos as Kim Phuc and other children emerged from
smoke following an attack. Shimkin was killed in Vietnam a month later,
according to the investigation. </p>
<p>A key source for the story in “The Stringer” is Carl Robinson, then a
photo editor for the AP in Saigon, who was initially overruled in his
judgment not to use the picture. AP reached out to Robinson as part of
its probe, but he said he had signed an NDA with Knight and the VII
Foundation. Knight followed up, saying Robinson would only speak off the
record, which the AP concluded would have prevented the news
organization from setting the record straight. </p>
<p>Robinson did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment on
Thursday. </p>
<p>On duty that day in Saigon, Robinson had concluded that Ut’s picture
could not be used because it would have violated standards prohibiting
nudity. But Faas overruled him, and senior AP editors in New York
decided to run the picture for what it conveyed about war. </p>
<p>The AP questioned Robinson’s long silence in contradicting Ut’s photo
credit, and showed a photo from its archives of Robinson with champagne
toasting Ut’s Pulitzer Prize. In a 2005 interview with corporate
archives, Robinson said he thought AP “created a monster” when it
distributed the photo because much of the world’s sympathies were
focused on one victim, instead of war victims more broadly. </p>
<p>Former AP correspondent Peter Arnett, who believes Ut made the image,
said Robinson wrote to him after Faas’ death in 2012 to make the
allegation that Ut had not taken it; he said he did not want to do it
while Faas was still alive. According to the AP investigation, Arnett
said Robinson told him that Ut had “gone all Hollywood” and he didn’t
like it. </p>
<p>Hornstein characterized Robinson, who was dismissed by AP in 1978, as
“a guy with a 50-year vendetta against the AP.” He also questioned the
long silence by the man supposedly identified in the documentary as the
person who really took the photo. </p>
<p>The lawyer also produced a statement from Kim Phuc, who said that
while she has no memory of that day, her uncle has repeatedly told her
that Ut took the picture and that she had no reason to doubt him. Ut
also took her to the nearest hospital after the photo was taken, she
wrote.</p>

<h2 id="banning-cellphones-in-schools-gains-popularity-in-us">Banning
cellphones in schools gains popularity in US</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>little rock, arkansas — Arkansas’ Republican Governor Sarah Huckabee
Sanders and California’s Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom have little in
common ideologically, but the two have both been vocal supporters of an
idea that’s been rapidly gaining bipartisan ground in the states:
Students’ use of cellphones needs to be banned during the school
day. </p>
<p>At least eight states have enacted such bans over the past two years,
and proposals are being considered in several more states this
year. </p>
<p>Here is a look at the push by states for such bans. </p>
<p>Why are states banning cellphones at schools? </p>
<p>The push for cellphone bans has been driven by concerns about the
impact screen time has on children’s mental health and complaints from
teachers that cellphones have become a constant distraction in the
classroom. </p>
<p>Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy, who has called on Congress to
require warning labels on social media platforms about their effects on
young people’s lives, has said schools need to provide phone-free
times. </p>
<p>Nationally, 77% of U.S. schools say they prohibit cellphones at
school for non-academic use, according to the National Center for
Education Statistics. But that number is misleading. It does not mean
students are following those bans or all those schools are enforcing
them. </p>
<p>Kim Whitman, co-founder of the Phone Free Schools Movement, said the
issue is catching on because parents and teachers in both red and blue
states are struggling with the consequences of kids on mobile
devices. </p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter if you live in a big city or a rural town, urban
or suburban, all children are struggling and need that seven-hour break
from the pressures of phones and social media during the school day,”
she said. </p>
<p>What states are enacting bans? </p>
<p>At least eight states — California, Florida, Indiana, Louisiana,
Minnesota, Ohio, South Carolina and Virginia — have enacted measures
banning or restricting students’ use of cellphones in schools. </p>
<p>The policies range widely. Florida was the first state to crack down
on phones in school, passing a 2023 law that requires all public schools
to ban cellphone use during class time and block access to social media
on district Wi-Fi. </p>
<p>A 2024 California law requires the state’s nearly 1,000 school
districts to create their own cellphone policies by July 2026. </p>
<p>Several other states haven’t banned phones, but have encouraged
school districts to enact such restrictions or have provided funding to
store phones during the day. </p>
<p>Sanders announced a pilot program last year providing grants to
schools that adopt phone-free policies, and more than 100 school
districts signed on. Sanders said she now wants to require all districts
to ban cellphones during the school day, but the proposal will leave it
to the districts on how to craft the policy. </p>
<p>“Teachers know [cellphones are] a huge distraction, but much bigger
than that is that it is impacting the mental health of so many of our
students,” Sanders told reporters on Thursday. </p>
<p>Other governors recently calling for bans include Kelly Ayotte of New
Hampshire, who was sworn in this month, Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds and
Nebraska Governor Jim Pillen. New York Governor Kathy Hochul has
suggested she’ll seek a statewide policy, but has not offered
specifics. </p>
<p>What is the opposition to the bans? </p>
<p>The cellphone bans have faced opposition from some parents who say
they need to be able to contact their children directly in case of
emergency. </p>
<p>Some parents have pointed to recent school shootings where having
access to cellphones was the only way some students were able to
communicate with loved ones for what they thought might be the last
time. </p>
<p>But supporters of the bans have noted that students’ phones could
pose additional dangers during an emergency by distracting students or
by revealing their location during an active-shooter situation. </p>
<p>Parents opposed to the ban have also said they want their children to
have access to their phones for other needs, such as coordinating
transportation. </p>
<p>Keri Rodrigues, president of the National Parents Union, said she
agrees about the dangers of social media for children but that the bans
sought by states are too broad. Banning the devices during the school
day is not going to solve underlying issues like bullying or the dangers
of social media, she said. </p>
<p>“We have not done our job as grown-ups to try to teach our kids the
skills they need to actually navigate this technology,” she said. “We’ve
just kicked the can down the road and thrown them into the deep end of
the pool when they’re by themselves after school.”</p>

<h2 id="tiktok-goes-dark-for-us-users-company-pins-hope-on-trump">TikTok
goes dark for US users; company pins hope on Trump</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — TikTok stopped working in the United States late on
Saturday and disappeared from Apple and Google app stores ahead of a law
that takes effect Sunday requiring the shutdown of the app used by 170
million Americans.</p>
<p>President-elect Donald Trump said earlier in the day he would “most
likely” give TikTok a 90-day reprieve from the ban after he takes office
on Monday, a promise TikTok cited in a notice posted to users on the
app.</p>
<p>TikTok, which is owned by China’s ByteDance, told users attempting to
use the app around 10:45 p.m. ET (0345 GMT): “A law banning TikTok has
been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can’t use TikTok
for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he
will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes
office. Please stay tuned.”</p>
<p>Other apps owned by ByteDance, including video editing app Capcut and
lifestyle social app Lemon8, were also offline and unavailable in U.S.
app stores as of late Saturday.</p>
<p>“The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done,
because it’s appropriate,” Trump told NBC. “If I decide to do that, I’ll
probably announce it on Monday.”</p>
<p>It was not clear if any U.S. users could still access the app, but it
was no longer working for many users and people seeking to access it
through a web application were met with the same message that TikTok was
no longer working.</p>
<p>TikTok, which has captivated nearly half of all Americans, powered
small businesses and shaped online culture, warned on Friday it would go
dark in the U.S. on Sunday unless President Joe Biden’s administration
provides assurances to companies such as Apple and Google that they will
not face enforcement actions when a ban takes effect.</p>
<p>Under a law passed last year and upheld on Friday by a unanimous
Supreme Court, the platform has until Sunday to cut ties with its
China-based parent or shut down its U.S. operation to resolve concerns
it poses a threat to national security.</p>
<p>The White House reiterated on Saturday that it was up to the incoming
administration to take action.</p>
<p>“We see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in
the next few days before the Trump administration takes office on
Monday,” press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.</p>
<p>TikTok did not respond to a request for comment on the new White
House statement.</p>
<p>The Chinese Embassy in Washington on Friday accused the U.S. of using
unfair state power to suppress TikTok. “China will take all necessary
measures to resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,” a
spokesperson said.  </p>
<p>Users move to alternatives</p>
<p>Uncertainty over the app’s future had sent users – mostly younger
people – scrambling to alternatives including China-based RedNote.
Rivals Meta and Snap had also seen their share prices rise this month
ahead of the ban, as investors bet on an influx of users and advertising
dollars.</p>
<p>“This is my new home now,” wrote one user in a RedNote post, tagged
with the words “tiktokrefugee” and “sad.”</p>
<p>Minutes after TikTok’s U.S. shutdown, other users took to X, formerly
called Twitter.</p>
<p>“I didn’t really think that they would cut off TikTok. Now I’m sad
and I miss the friends I made there. Hoping it all comes back in just a
few days,” wrote <span class="citation"
data-cites="RavenclawJedi">@RavenclawJedi</span>.</p>
<p>NordVPN, a popular virtual private network, or VPN, allowing users to
access the internet from servers around the world, said it was
“experiencing temporary technical difficulties.”</p>
<p>Web searches for “VPN” spiked in the minutes after U.S. users lost
access to TikTok, according to Google Trends.</p>
<p>Users on Instagram fretted about whether they would still receive
merchandise they had bought on TikTok Shop, the video platform’s
e-commerce arm.</p>
<p>Marketing firms reliant on TikTok have rushed to prepare contingency
plans this week in what one executive described as a “hair on fire”
moment after months of conventional wisdom saying that a solution would
materialize to keep the app running.</p>
<p>There have been signs TikTok could make a comeback under Trump, who
has said he wants to pursue a “political resolution” of the issue and
last month urged the Supreme Court to pause implementation of the
ban.</p>
<p>TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew plans to attend the U.S. presidential
inauguration and attend a rally with Trump on Sunday, a source told
Reuters.</p>
<p>Suitors including former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt have
expressed interest in the fast-growing business that analysts estimate
could be worth as much as $50 billion. Media reports say Beijing has
also held talks about selling TikTok’s U.S. operations to billionaire
and Trump ally Elon Musk, though the company has denied that.</p>
<p>U.S. search engine startup Perplexity AI submitted a bid on Saturday
to ByteDance for Perplexity to merge with TikTok U.S., a source familiar
with the company’s plans told Reuters. Perplexity would merge with
TikTok U.S. and create a new entity by combining the merged company with
other partners, the person added.</p>
<p>Privately held ByteDance is about 60% owned by institutional
investors such as BlackRock and General Atlantic, while its founders and
employees own 20% each. It has more than 7,000 employees in the U.S.</p>

Trump returns to White House, his family circle looks different</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>When Donald Trump returns to the White House on Monday, his family
circle will look a little different than it did when he first arrived
eight years ago.</p>
<p>His youngest son, Barron, was in fifth grade back then. He’s now a
college freshman who towers over his 1.8-meter-plus dad. Granddaughter
Kai, who was 9 in 2017, is now an aspiring social media influencer and
impressive golfer. Grandson Joseph, who posed in Trump’s lap with a Lego
model of the White House last time, is 11 now.</p>
<p>After working in his first administration, the most prominent
relatives in Trump’s political sphere, daughter Ivanka and her husband,
Jared, are now in Florida.</p>
<p>Family members can provide presidents with a ready source of moral
and sounding-board support, companionship and even relief from the
world’s problems.</p>
<p>The president-elect has five children — three of whom are married —
from his marriages to Ivana Trump, Marla Maples and current wife Melania
Trump. He has 10 grandchildren, with an 11th on the way.</p>
<p>A look at Trump’s family circle, then and now:</p>
<p>Melania Trump, Trump’s wife</p>
<p>THEN: She spent the opening months of Trump’s term at the family’s
Manhattan penthouse so that 11-year-old Barron wouldn’t have to switch
schools in the middle of the year. After moving to the White House, she
traveled around the United States and to other countries, alone and with
Trump, partly to promote her “Be Best” children’s initiative while
fiercely guarding her privacy.</p>
<p>NOW: She avoided active campaigning during Trump’s 2024 run, limiting
her public appearances to key moments, such as the campaign’s launch,
the Republican National Convention and election night. She released a
self-titled memoir late last year and will be the subject of a
documentary distributed by Amazon Prime Video that is expected to be
released this year. While some doubt that Trump’s 54-year-old wife will
spend much time at the White House, she said on Fox News’ Fox &amp;
Friends that she has already packed and picked out the furniture she
wants to take to the executive mansion.</p>
<p>Donald Trump Jr., Trump’s eldest son</p>
<p>THEN: Trump’s eldest son, now 46, campaigned for his father in 2016
and 2020.</p>
<p>NOW: Trump Jr.’s influence has grown to the point that he lobbied his
father to choose close friend JD Vance for vice president. He also
pushed for former Democratic Representative Tulsi Gabbard and Robert F.
Kennedy Jr., the president-elect’s picks for director of national
intelligence and health and human services, respectively. Trump
Jr. helps run the family real estate business and is an honorary
chairman of Trump’s transition. He has a podcast and has said his role
is to prevent “bad actors” from getting into the administration. He
recently flew on his father’s airplane to Greenland; the president-elect
has expressed a desire to take control of the mineral-rich Danish
territory.</p>
<p>Trump Jr. has five children — or “smurfs,” as he sometimes refers to
them — with his former wife, Vanessa Trump. They are Kai Madison, 17;
Donald John III, 15; Tristan Milos, 13; Spencer Frederick, 12; and Chloe
Sophia Trump, 10.</p>
<p>Ivanka Trump, Trump’s eldest daughter</p>
<p>THEN: Ivanka, 43, campaigned for her father in 2016 and moved her
family from New York City to Washington to work in his White House as a
senior adviser. She was on the campaign trail in 2020, too, but she and
her family moved to Florida and retreated from the spotlight after his
loss.</p>
<p>NOW: As Trump geared up for the 2024 run, Ivanka announced that she
loved and supported him but was getting out of politics to focus on her
husband and their three kids. She did, however, join her father and
other family members on election night and when he rang the bell at the
New York Stock Exchange in early December after Time magazine named him
Person of the Year.</p>
<p>Ivanka and her husband have three children: Arabella Rose, 13; Joseph
Frederick, 11; and Theodore James Kushner, 8.</p>
<p>Eric Trump, Trump’s second son</p>
<p>THEN: The 40-year-old helped run the family business and participated
in his father’s campaigns.</p>
<p>NOW: Eric is also an honorary chair of the transition and a close
adviser to his father. But he continues to focus more on running the
family business. In September, he and his brother started a crypto
platform called World Liberty Financial, and their father helped launch
it in an interview on the X social media platform.</p>
<p>Eric and his wife, Lara, have two children: Eric Luke, 7, and
Carolina Dorothy Trump, 5.</p>
<p>Tiffany Trump, Trump’s youngest daughter</p>
<p>THEN: Trump’s daughter with second wife Marla Maples was 23 and a
recent University of Pennsylvania graduate who kept a low profile when
Trump was first elected.</p>
<p>NOW: She was more present in the 2024 campaign but still largely
avoids the spotlight. Tiffany, 31, and her husband, Michael Boulos, are
expecting their first child this year. Boulos is a businessman who
traveled with Trump in the final stretch of the campaign. His father is
Massad Boulos, a Lebanese American businessman who helped Trump with the
influential Arab American community in the swing state of Michigan.
Trump has named Massad Boulos to be a senior adviser on Arab and Middle
Eastern affairs.</p>
<p>Barron Trump, Trump’s youngest son</p>
<p>THEN: At the start of Trump’s first term, Barron and his mother
stayed at the family’s Trump Tower penthouse in Manhattan so he could
finish his school year. When they got to Washington, his soccer net
appeared in what’s known as the first lady’s garden.</p>
<p>NOW: Barron, 18, is a freshman New York University business student.
His parents and Trump campaign officials credit him for recommending
podcasts popular with young men that the president-elect appeared on
during the campaign. Barron will have a bedroom in the White House,
Melania Trump said on Fox &amp; Friends.</p>
<p>“I’m very proud of him, about his knowledge, even about politics and
giving an advice to his father,” his mother said on the program. “He
brought in so many young people. He knows his generation.”</p>
<p>Lara Trump, Trump’s daughter-in-law</p>
<p>THEN: Trump’s daughter-in-law, 42, campaigned for him during all his
runs. After Trump lost to Democrat Joe Biden in 2020, she considered
running for a U.S. Senate seat from her home state of North Carolina but
ultimately decided against it. She became a Fox News commentator.</p>
<p>NOW: As Trump revved up his 2024 campaign, he installed his
daughter-in-law as co-chair of the Republican National Committee, where
she was a TV-ready advocate overseeing fundraising, voter outreach and
the party’s “election integrity” initiative. She stepped down from the
RNC after the election and removed her name from consideration as a
possible successor to Florida Senator Marco Rubio, Trump’s choice for
secretary of state.</p>
<p>Lara Trump is passionate about fitness and has her own line of
activewear.</p>
<p>Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law</p>
<p>THEN: Kushner, 44, was also a key figure in Trump’s 2016 campaign. He
joined his wife in the White House as a senior adviser, a role that
included working on U.S. policy toward Israel and the broader Middle
East.</p>
<p>NOW: Kushner has stepped out of the political spotlight — but his
father could soon step in. Trump announced after the election that he
intends to nominate Charles Kushner, a real estate developer, to be U.S.
ambassador to France. The elder Kushner was pardoned by Trump in
December 2020 after he pleaded guilty years earlier to tax evasion and
making illegal campaign contributions.</p>
<p>Kai Trump, one of Trump’s granddaughters</p>
<p>THEN: Kai was in elementary school when her grandfather became
president.</p>
<p>NOW: Donald Trump Jr.’s 17-year-old granddaughter is an aspiring
social media influencer. Her behind-the-scenes video from election night
garnered 3.7 million views on YouTube. Other posts related to her
grandfather have been watched millions more times on TikTok. Kai
delivered her first public speech at the Republican convention and is an
avid golfer who sometimes plays with her grandfather.</p>
<p>Arabella Kushner, one of Trump’s granddaughters</p>
<p>THEN: Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner’s daughter was 6 when her
grandfather showed China’s Xi Jinping a video of her, in a traditional
Chinese dress, belting out Chinese-language songs.</p>
<p>“It’s very good, right? She’s very smart,” Trump said. Xi responded
that Arabella was her grandfather’s “little angel” and a “messenger of
China-U.S. relations.”</p>
<p>NOW: Arabella is 13 and enjoys singing, playing the piano, horseback
riding and Brazilian jiu-jitsu, according to a social media post from
her mother.</p>

id="rubio-vows-to-oppose-thai-uyghur-deportations-as-us-secretary-of-state">Rubio
vows to oppose Thai Uyghur deportations as US secretary of state</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, President-elect Donald Trump’s
pick for secretary of state, is pledging to press Thailand to prevent
the deportation of 48 Uyghurs held there since 2014 after fleeing
alleged persecution in Xinjiang, in northwest China.   </p>
<p>“Thailand is a very strong U.S. partner, a strong historical ally,”
Rubio said during his Senate confirmation hearing Wednesday. “That is an
area where I think diplomacy could really achieve results because of how
important that relationship is and how close it is.”  </p>
<p>Describing the Uyghurs’ plight in China as “one of the most
horrifying things that has ever happened,” he said, “These are people
who are basically being rounded up because of their ethnicity and
religion, and they are being put into camps … stripped of their
identity… and into forced labor — literally, slave labor.”  </p>
<p>Human rights advocates say returning the Uyghurs to China risks
torture, long imprisonment, or disappearance.  </p>
<p>Rubio, a leading critic of Beijing, co-sponsored the 2021 Uyghur
Forced Labor Prevention Act, which bans imports from Xinjiang unless
free of forced labor. His stance for human rights in China has subjected
him to Chinese sanctions since 2020.  </p>
<p>China refutes accusations of genocide</p>
<p>Both the Biden and previous Trump administrations have classified
China’s actions in Xinjiang as genocide, while a 2022 United Nations
report said Beijing’s policies may constitute crimes against humanity.
China rejects these accusations, framing its actions as anti-terrorism
measures.  </p>
<p>The Chinese Embassy in Bangkok claimed on Wednesday that Uyghur
detainees in Thailand had terrorist ties.  </p>
<p>“A small number of individuals, enticed by external forces, fled
abroad and even joined the ‘East Turkestan Islamic Movement,’ [ETIM] a
terrorist organization recognized by the United Nations, becoming
terrorists themselves,” the embassy stated. </p>
<p>Although ETIM was listed as a terror group in 2002, the U.S. delisted
it in 2020, citing no “clear and convincing evidence of ETIM’s
existence,” according to Congressional Research Service. </p>
<p>Julie Millsap, government relations manager at the Washington-based
group No Business With Genocide, dismissed China’s claims.  </p>
<p>There has been “no evidence presented to link these men to
terrorism,” Millsap told VOA. “The PRC cannot claim concurrently that it
has a population of happy, dancing Uyghurs while labeling asylum seekers
as extremists.”  </p>
<p>Arslan Hidayat, team lead of the Save Uyghur campaign by U.S.-based
Justice for All, said Uyghur detainees in Thailand recently faced a
troubling development. </p>
<p>“Last week, I learned from the detainees that Thai immigration
officers attempted to photograph 43 Uyghur detainees and have them sign
documents similar to those used in 2015, when more than 100 Uyghurs were
forcibly repatriated to China,” Hidayat told VOA Friday. </p>
<p>“Fearing a repeat of that mass deportation, the detainees refused and
launched a hunger strike, which continues to this day,” he said. </p>
<p>‘Degrading treatment or even torture’</p>
<p>In addition to the 43 Uyghurs in Thailand’s IDC, five are imprisoned
after a failed escape attempt. A U.N. report cited “degrading treatment
or even torture” and five deaths, including two children, urging Thai
authorities against deportation without due process and individual
protection assessments. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Human Rights Watch on Friday urged Thailand to release detained
Uyghurs and grant them safe passage to a third country.</p>
<p>“Successive Thai governments have kept the Uyghurs in inhumane
detention, while under pressure from the Chinese government to send them
to China,” said Elaine Pearson, Asia director at Human Rights Watch,
calling on Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra’s government to
end this cycle. </p>
<p>VOA contacted the Thai Embassy in Washington and the Thai Foreign
Affairs Ministry for comment on the Uyghurs’ status and the reports of
potential repatriation but received no response. </p>
<p>Babar Baloch, global spokesperson for the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees, told VOA the agency is closely monitoring the
situation and has sought assurances from Thai authorities. </p>
<p>“We continue to remind the authorities of their obligations on
non-refoulement and to advocate for alternatives to detention,” he said
Friday. </p>
<p>Zumretay Arkin, vice president of the Munich-based World Uyghur
Congress, cited ongoing discussions between China and Thailand about
deportations in the context of the 50th anniversary of their diplomatic
relations. </p>
<p>“We remain concerned about their fate and continue to increase public
pressure,” Arkin told VOA, adding that her group had called on partner
organizations to organize global protests outside Thai diplomatic
missions. </p>
<p>Family torn apart </p>
<p>Rahile, a 32-year-old Uyghur mother of three living in Turkey, has
been separated from her husband, detained in Bangkok for nearly a
decade. She asked that his name not be used, fearing reprisal from Thai
authorities.   </p>
<p>“We had just built our home [in Xinjiang] and were living a normal
life when everything turned into a nightmare 12 years ago,” she told VOA
from Kayseri, Turkey, requesting her last name be withheld to protect
relatives in southern Xinjiang. </p>
<p>Their ordeal began in 2013 when a Uyghur working for the Chinese
government warned her husband that his name was on a detention list as
authorities targeted Uyghur men under vague suspicions of alleged
separatism and extremism. </p>
<p>“My husband learned of an escape route and asked if I would follow or
stay behind,” Rahile said. “People around us were disappearing. He had
no choice but to leave.” </p>
<p>The couple fled without passports, relying on smugglers to cross into
Southeast Asia. Intercepted in Thailand in 2014, Rahile and her two
young sons spent 18 months in detention before Turkey resettled more
than 170 women and children. Her husband remained with more than 150
Uyghur migrants in Thailand. </p>
<p>Weeks later, over 100 Uyghurs were forcibly deported to China. “They
were never heard from again,” she said. “I was relieved my husband was
still in Thailand. I hoped we’d reunite soon.” </p>
<p>A decade later, her youngest son, born in Thai detention, has never
met his father. </p>
<p>“The space was so cramped my children could sleep, but I had to
stand,” she said. “Now, my husband has endured that pain for 11
years.” </p>
<p>In Turkey, Rahile juggles jobs to support her family after initial
aid from the local community. </p>
<p>“My children ask why their father isn’t here,” she said. “I have no
answer for them.”</p>

<h2 id="trump-arrives-in-washington-for-inaugural-celebrations">Trump
arrives in Washington for inaugural celebrations</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Donald Trump returned to Washington Saturday evening to
celebrate with family, supporters and political allies ahead of his
second inauguration, a triumphant return for the Republican four years
after he departed the city under the shadow of an attack by his
supporters on the Capitol.</p>
<p>Trump marked his return to power with a celebration at his Trump
National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia, about 48 kilometers outside
Washington.</p>
<p>He addressed the crowd, giving shoutouts to Virginia Gov. Glenn
Youngkin, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, and declaring his Mideast envoy
Steve Witkoff a “great negotiator.” Witkoff this past week helped
negotiate a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas that’s scheduled to
take effect on Sunday.</p>
<p>Soon after his remarks, Trump stepped out onto a clubhouse balcony
while guests gathered on the patio below him for a fireworks display and
performance by tenor Christopher Macchio.</p>
<p>Trump returned to Washington as organizers of Monday’s Inauguration
Day ceremony were scrambling to move inside most of the outdoor events,
including the swearing-in of president and vice president that
traditionally takes place on the steps of the U.S. Capitol, due to
forecast frigid temperatures.</p>
<p>It will be the first time since President Ronald Reagan took the oath
of office in 1985 for his second term that the ceremony will be moved
inside the U.S. Capitol.</p>
<p>Trump made his way from West Palm Beach, Florida, with his wife,
Melania Trump, and their son, Barron, aboard a U.S. military C-32
aircraft on a flight dubbed Special Air Mission 47 — a nod to Trump
becoming the 47th president on Monday.</p>
<p>It’s a courtesy that’s traditionally been extended by the outgoing
administration to the incoming one. Trump did not make a government
plane available to President Joe Biden ahead of his inauguration in
2021, and instead the Democrat flew to Washington on a privately
chartered aircraft.</p>
<p>As his motorcade neared his golf club for Saturday’s celebration, he
was greeted by dozens of well-wishers who gathered along the roadside
and chanted “Trump” and “USA, USA!”</p>
<p>With a blast of Arctic air expected to leave the nation’s capital
facing frigid temperatures on Inauguration Day, Trump opted to move
inside most of Monday’s outdoor events, including the swearing-in
ceremony.</p>
<p>“I think we made the right decision. We’ll be very comfortable now,”
Trump told NBC News in a phone interview Saturday.</p>
<p>On Pennsylvania Avenue leading to the White House, crews were
breaking down metal bleachers that would have been used for outdoor
inauguration viewing stands.</p>
<p>Even before Trump got to town, groups of protesters began taking to
the street in the morning as a light sleet fell.</p>
<p>Melody Hamoud, a Washington resident, wore a pink hat that she had on
at a 2017 march to protest Trump’s first inauguration.</p>
<p>“I just didn’t want to sit home and fret in front of the TV,” she
said. “I wanted to feel like our movement still has energy and be around
others who felt the same.”</p>
<p>Timothy Wallis, 58, flew in for the inauguration from Pocatello,
Idaho, with friends. The group had tickets to watch the ceremony outside
but haven’t been able to get tickets to any of the indoor events.</p>
<p>“We found out on the plane,” he said about the change of plans.</p>
<p>Wallis said he was disappointed about the switch and a little bemused
since he’s used to cold at home. </p>
<p>“We left snow to come here,” he said. “I brought my gloves!”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Trump said Saturday he is preparing to roll out a series
of executive orders and other actions in the first days of his new
administration.</p>
<p>He confirmed he’ll “most likely” grant an extension that might allow
TikTok to keep operating in the U.S. beyond Sunday, when a law that
prohibits mobile app stores and internet hosting services from
distributing TikTok to U.S. users takes effect.</p>
<p>And Trump in the NBC News interview confirmed that his administration
would begin its effort “very early, very quickly” on following through
on a campaign promise of mass deportations of migrants living in the
U.S. without legal permission.</p>
<p>Federal immigration officers are expected to initially target more
than 300 people in the Chicago area with histories of egregious, violent
crimes after Trump takes office Monday, according to an official
familiar with the planning who spoke on condition of anonymity because
plans have not been made public.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s got to happen, and if it doesn’t happen, we’re not going
to have a country any longer,” said Trump, who declined to say where the
deportation operations would begin.</p>
<p>Trump, a Republican, left office in 2021 as a political pariah after
his refusal to accept his loss to Democrat Joe Biden led a mob to
overrun the Capitol. He then broke tradition by skipping Biden’s
inauguration.</p>
<p>Biden will adhere to one of the most potent symbols of the democratic
handover, welcoming Trump to the White House and joining him on the ride
to the Capitol before Trump takes the oath of office.</p>
<p>The first time Trump was sworn into office eight years ago, the
former reality TV star billionaire came in as an outsider disrupting
Washington’s norms, delivering a dark inaugural address as his
swearing-in drew large protests and some clashes in the street.</p>
<p>This time, Trump told NBC, the theme of his inauguration speech would
be “unity and strength, and also the word ‘fairness.’”</p>
<p>As he takes power, the protests were far less noticeable, eclipsed by
the ceremonies and celebrations around Trump’s taking power. As one more
marker of Trump’s remarkable comeback, the events surrounding his
inauguration will be more celebrity-studded than the last time, along
with a noticeable turnout by a cadre of tech-world billionaires.</p>
<p>While Trump held court at his Virginia golf club on Saturday evening,
Vice President-elect JD Vance attended a reception for Cabinet members
and hosted a dinner in Washington.</p>
<p>On Sunday, the eve of his inauguration, Trump is scheduled to
participate in a wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery
before heading to a rally at Capital One Arena in Washington. The rally
will be followed by a private dinner.</p>
<p>On Inauguration Day, Trump will start with the traditional prayer
service at St. John’s Episcopal Church before heading to the White House
for a customary tea with the outgoing president and first lady.</p>
<p>Trump then heads to the Capitol, where his ceremony has been moved
indoors as temperatures are set to plummet and make it the coldest
Inauguration Day in 40 years. It’s not quite clear how the ceremony will
be adapted to the Capitol Rotunda, which holds only 600 people. More
than 250,000 guests were ticketed to view the inauguration from around
the Capitol grounds.</p>
<p>The planned traditional parade down Pennsylvania Avenue has morphed
into an indoor event because of the cold, with Trump again planning to
speak to his gathered supporters before he heads to the White House for
a signing ceremony in the Oval Office. A trio of glitzy balls will
follow in the evening, punctuated by musical performances.</p>
