wait to return to northern Gaza, Trump urges Jordan, Egypt to take
Palestinians</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Cairo — Tens of thousands of Palestinians waited, blocked on the
road, to return to their homes in northern Gaza on Sunday, voicing
frustration after Israel accused Hamas of breaching a ceasefire
agreement and refused to open crossing points. </p>
<p>A day after a second exchange of Israeli hostages held in Gaza for
Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, the holdup underlined the risks
hanging over the truce between the militant group and Israel, longtime
adversaries in a series of Gaza wars. </p>
<p>In central areas of Gaza, columns of people were waiting along the
main roads leading north, some in vehicles and some on foot, witnesses
said. </p>
<p>“A sea of people is waiting for a signal to move back to Gaza City
and the north, people are fed up and they want to go home,” said Tamer
Al-Burai, a displaced person from Gaza City. “This is the deal that was
signed, isn’t it?” </p>
<p>“Many of those people have no idea whether their houses back home are
still standing. But they want to go regardless, they want to put up the
tents next to the rubble of their houses, they want to feel home,” he
told Reuters via a chat app. </p>
<p>On Sunday, witnesses said many people had slept overnight on the
Salahuddin Road, the main thoroughfare running north to south and on the
coastal road leading north, waiting to go past the Israeli military
positions in the Netzarim corridor running across the center of the Gaza
Strip. </p>
<p>Vehicles, trucks and rickshaws were overloaded with mattresses, food,
and with the tents that used to shelter them for over a year in the
central and southern areas of the enclave, and volunteers were
distributing water and food. </p>
<p>Under the agreement worked out with Egyptian and Qatari mediators and
backed by the United States, Israel was meant to allow Palestinians
displaced from the homes in the north to return to their homes. </p>
<p>But Israel said that Hamas’ failure to hand over a list detailing
which of the hostages scheduled for release is alive or to hand over
Arbel Yehud, an Israeli woman taken hostage during the Hamas attack on
Israel on October 7, 2023 meant it had violated the agreement. </p>
<p>As a result, checkpoints in the central Gaza Strip would not be
opened to allow crossings into the northern Gaza Strip, it said in a
statement. Hamas issued a statement accusing Israel of stalling and
holding it responsible for the delay. </p>
<p>‘Demolition site’ </p>
<p>On Saturday, U.S. President Donald Trump instructed the U.S. military
to release 2,000-pound bombs that his predecessor, Joe Biden, had
ordered to be withheld from delivery to Israel over concern about their
impact on the civilian population of Gaza. </p>
<p>He also called on Egypt and Jordan to take on more Palestinians from
Gaza either temporarily or permanently, saying “we should just clear out
the whole thing.” </p>
<p>“It’s literally a demolition site, almost everything is demolished
and people are dying there,” he told reporters after a call with
Jordan’s King Abdullah. </p>
<p>An official of Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that runs Gaza,
reacted with suspicion to the remarks, echoing longstanding Palestinian
fears about being driven permanently from their homes. </p>
<p>Palestinians “will not accept any offers or solutions, even if [such
offers] appear to have good intentions under the guise of
reconstruction, as announced in the proposals of U.S. President Trump,”
Basem Naim, a member of the Hamas political bureau, told Reuters. </p>
<p>Al-Awda Hospital officials said four people were wounded by Israeli
fire, from soldiers apparently trying to prevent people coming too
close. </p>
<p>The Israeli military issued warnings to Palestinians not to approach
its positions in Gaza and said soldiers had fired warning shots on
several occasions but said “as of now, we are unaware of any harm caused
to the suspects as a result of the shooting.”</p>

id="trump-discussing-tiktok-purchase-with-multiple-people-decision-in-30-days">Trump
discussing TikTok purchase with multiple people; decision in 30
days</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE — U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday
he was in talks with multiple people over buying TikTok and would likely
have a decision on the popular app’s future in the next 30 days.</p>
<p>“I have spoken to many people about TikTok and there is great
interest in TikTok,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One during a
flight to Florida.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, Reuters reported two people with knowledge of the
discussions said Trump’s administration is working on a plan to save
TikTok that involves tapping software company Oracle and a group of
outside investors to effectively take control of the app’s
operations.</p>
<p>Under the deal being negotiated by the White House, TikTok’s
China-based owner, ByteDance, would retain a stake in the company, but
data collection and software updates would be overseen by Oracle, which
already provides the foundation of TikTok’s Web infrastructure, one of
the sources told Reuters.</p>
<p>However, in his comments to reporters on the flight, Trump said he
had not spoken to Oracle’s Larry Ellison about buying the app.</p>
<p>Asked if he was putting together a deal with Oracle and other
investors to save TikTok, Trump said: “No, not with Oracle. Numerous
people are talking to me, very substantial people, about buying it and I
will make that decision probably over the next 30 days. Congress has
given 90 days. If we can save TikTok, I think it would be a good
thing.”</p>
<p>The sources did say the terms of any potential deal with Oracle were
fluid and likely to change. One source said the full scope of the
discussions was not yet set and could include the U.S. operations as
well as other regions.</p>
<p>National Public Radio on Saturday reported the deal talks for
TikTok’s global operations, citing two people with knowledge of the
negotiations. Oracle had no immediate comment.</p>
<p>The deal being negotiated anticipates participation from ByteDance’s
current U.S. investors, according to the sources. Jeff Yass’s
Susquehanna International Group, General Atlantic, Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts and Sequoia Capital are among ByteDance’s U.S. backers.</p>
<p>Representatives for TikTok, ByteDance investors General Atlantic,
KKR, Sequoia and Susquehanna could not immediately be reached for
comment.</p>
<p>Others vying to acquire TikTok, including the investor group led by
billionaire Frank McCourt and another involving Jimmy Donaldson, better
known as the YouTube star Mr. Beast, are not part of the Oracle
negotiation, one of the sources said.</p>
<p>Oracle responsible</p>
<p>Under the terms of the deal, Oracle would be responsible for
addressing national security issues. TikTok initially struck a deal with
Oracle in 2022 to store U.S. users’ information to alleviate
Washington’s worries about Chinese government interference.</p>
<p>TikTok’s management would remain in place, to operate the short video
app, according to one of the sources.</p>
<p>The app, which is used by 170 million Americans, was taken offline
temporarily for users shortly before a law that said it must be sold by
ByteDance on national security grounds, or be banned, took effect on
Jan. 19.</p>
<p>Trump, after taking office a day later, signed an executive order
seeking to delay by 75 days the enforcement of the law that was put in
place after U.S. officials warned that under ByteDance, there was a risk
of Americans’ data being misused.</p>
<p>Officials from Oracle and the White House held a meeting on Friday
about a potential deal, and another meeting has been scheduled for next
week, NPR reported.</p>
<p>Oracle was interested in a TikTok stake “in the tens of billions,”
but the rest of the deal is in flux, the NPR report cited the source as
saying.</p>
<p>Trump has said he “would like the United States to have a 50%
ownership position in a joint venture” in TikTok.</p>
<p>NPR cited another source as saying that appeasing Congress is seen as
a key hurdle by the White House.</p>
<p>Free speech advocates have opposed TikTok’s ban under a law passed by
the U.S. Congress and signed by former President Joe Biden.</p>
<p>The company has said U.S. officials have misstated its ties to China,
arguing its content recommendation engine and user data are stored in
the United States on cloud servers operated by Oracle while content
moderation decisions that affect American users are also made in the
U.S.</p>

id="rubio-threatens-bounties-on-taliban-leaders-over-detained-americans">Rubio
threatens bounties on Taliban leaders over detained Americans</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Saturday
threatened bounties on the heads of Afghanistan’s Taliban leaders,
sharply escalating the tone as he said more Americans may be detained in
the country than previously thought.</p>
<p>The threat comes days after the Afghan Taliban government and the
United States swapped prisoners in one of the final acts of former U.S.
President Joe Biden.</p>
<p>The new top U.S. diplomat issued the harsh warning via social media,
in a rhetorical style strikingly similar to his boss, President Donald
Trump.</p>
<p>“Just hearing the Taliban is holding more American hostages than has
been reported,” Rubio wrote on X.</p>
<p>“If this is true, we will have to immediately place a VERY BIG bounty
on their top leaders, maybe even bigger than the one we had on bin
Laden,” he said, referring to the al-Qaida leader killed by U.S. forces
in 2011.</p>
<p>Rubio did not describe who the other Americans may be, but there have
long been accounts of missing Americans whose cases were not formally
taken up by the U.S. government as wrongful detentions.</p>
<p>In the deal with the Biden administration, the Taliban freed the
best-known American detained in Afghanistan, Ryan Corbett, who had been
living with his family in the country and was seized in August 2022.</p>
<p>Also freed was William McKenty, an American about whom little
information has been released.</p>
<p>The United States in turn freed Khan Mohammed, who was serving a life
sentence in a California prison.</p>
<p>Mohammed was convicted of trafficking heroin and opium into the
United States and was accused of seeking rockets to kill U.S. troops in
Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The United States offered a bounty of $25 million for information
leading to the capture or killing of Osama bin Laden shortly after the
September 11, 2001, terror attacks, with Congress later authorizing the
secretary of state to offer up to $50 million.</p>
<p>No one is believed to have collected the bounty for bin Laden, who
was killed in a U.S. raid in Pakistan.</p>
<p>Harder line on Taliban?</p>
<p>Trump is known for brandishing threats in his speeches and on social
media. But he is also a critic of U.S. military interventions overseas
and in his second inaugural address Monday said he aspired to be a
“peacemaker.”</p>
<p>In his first term, the Trump administration broke a then-taboo and
negotiated directly with the Taliban – with Trump even proposing a
summit with the then-insurgents at the Camp David presidential retreat –
as he brokered a deal to pull U.S. troops and end America’s longest
war.</p>
<p>Biden carried out the agreement, with the Western-backed government
swiftly collapsing and the Taliban retaking power in August 2021 just
after U.S. troops left.</p>
<p>The scenes of chaos in Kabul brought strong criticism of Biden,
especially when 13 American troops and scores of Afghans died in a
suicide bombing at the city’s airport.</p>
<p>The Biden administration had low-level contacts with Taliban
government representatives but made little headway.</p>
<p>Some members of Trump’s Republican Party criticized even the limited
U.S. engagements with the Taliban government and especially the
humanitarian assistance authorized by the Biden administration, which
insisted the money was for urgent needs in the impoverished country and
never routed through the Taliban.</p>
<p>Rubio on Friday froze nearly all U.S. aid around the world.</p>
<p>No country has officially recognized the Taliban government, which
has imposed severe restrictions on women and girls under its
ultra-conservative interpretation of Islam.</p>
<p>The International Criminal Court’s chief prosecutor on Thursday said
he was seeking arrest warrants for senior Taliban leaders over the
persecution of women.</p>

id="rain-in-california-will-aid-firefighters-create-risk-of-toxic-runoff">Rain
in California will aid firefighters, create risk of toxic runoff</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — Rain began falling in parched Southern California on
Saturday in a boon for firefighters who were mopping up multiple
wildfires. But heavy downpours on charred hillsides could bring the
threat of new troubles like toxic ash runoff. </p>
<p>Los Angeles County crews spent much of the week removing vegetation,
shoring up slopes and reinforcing roads in devastated areas of the
Palisades and Eaton fires. The two fires reduced entire neighborhoods to
rubble and ash after breaking out during powerful winds on January
7. </p>
<p>Most of the region was expected to get about 2.5 centimeters of
precipitation over several days, but “the threat is high enough to
prepare for the worst-case scenario” of localized cloudbursts causing
mud and debris to flow down hills, the National Weather Service said on
social media. </p>
<p>“So the problem would be if one of those showers happens to park
itself over a burn area,” weather service meteorologist Carol Smith
said. “That could be enough to create debris flows.” </p>
<p>The rain started along the Central Coast before moving into Ventura
and LA counties in the evening. It was forecast to increase throughout
the weekend and possibly last into early Tuesday, Smith said. Flood
watches were issued for some burn areas, and snow was likely in the
mountains. </p>
<p>Leaders take steps to speed cleanup</p>
<p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass issued an executive order this week to
expedite cleanup efforts and mitigate the environmental impacts of
fire-related pollutants. Los Angeles County supervisors also approved an
emergency motion to install flood-control infrastructure and expedite
and remove sediment in fire-impacted areas. </p>
<p>Fire crews filled sandbags for communities while county workers
installed barriers and cleared drainage pipes and basins. </p>
<p>Officials cautioned that ash in recent burn zones was a toxic mix of
incinerated cars, electronics, batteries, building materials, paints,
furniture and other household items. It contains pesticides, asbestos,
plastics and lead. Residents were urged to wear protective gear while
cleaning up. </p>
<p>Concerns about post-fire debris flows have been especially high since
2018, when the town of Montecito up the coast from LA was ravaged by
mudslides after a downpour hit mountain slopes burned bare by a huge
blaze. Twenty-three people died, and hundreds of homes were
damaged. </p>
<p>Several fires continue burning</p>
<p>While the impending wet weather ended weeks of dangerous gusts and
dry conditions, several wildfires were still burning across Southern
California. Those included the Palisades and Eaton fires, which killed
at least 28 people and destroyed more than 14,000 structures.
Containment of the Palisades Fire reached 81%, and the Eaton Fire was at
95% containment. </p>
<p>In northern Los Angeles County, firefighters made significant
progress against the Hughes Fire, which prompted evacuations for tens of
thousands of people when it erupted Wednesday in mountains near Lake
Castaic. </p>
<p>And in San Diego County, there was still little containment of the
Border 2 Fire churning through a remote area of the Otay Mountain
Wilderness near the U.S.-Mexico border. </p>
<p>The rain was expected to snap a near-record streak of dry weather for
Southern California. Much of the region has received less than 5% of the
average rainfall for this point in the water year, which began October
1, the Los Angeles Times reported. </p>
<p>Most of Southern California is now either in “extreme drought” or
“severe drought,” according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.</p>

id="cia-covid-likely-originated-in-a-lab-but-agency-has-low-confidence-in-report">CIA:
COVID likely originated in a lab, but agency has ‘low confidence’ in
report</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The CIA now believes the virus responsible for the
COVID-19 pandemic most likely originated from a laboratory, according to
an assessment released Saturday that points the finger at China even
while acknowledging that the spy agency has “low confidence” in its own
conclusion.</p>
<p>The finding is not the result of any new intelligence, and the report
was completed at the behest of the Biden administration and former CIA
Director William Burns. It was declassified and released Saturday on the
orders of President Donald Trump’s pick to lead the agency, John
Ratcliffe, who was sworn in Thursday as director.</p>
<p>The nuanced finding suggests the agency believes the totality of
evidence makes a lab origin more likely than a natural origin. But the
agency’s assessment assigns a low degree of confidence to this
conclusion, suggesting the evidence is deficient, inconclusive or
contradictory.</p>
<p>Earlier reports on the origins of COVID-19 have split over whether
the coronavirus emerged from a Chinese lab, potentially by mistake, or
whether it arose naturally. The new assessment is not likely to settle
the debate. In fact, intelligence officials say it may never be
resolved, due to a lack of cooperation from Chinese authorities.</p>
<p>The CIA “continues to assess that both research-related and natural
origin scenarios of the COVID-19 pandemic remain plausible,” the agency
wrote in a statement about its new assessment.</p>
<p>Instead of new evidence, the conclusion was based on fresh analyses
of intelligence about the spread of the virus, its scientific properties
and the work and conditions of China’s virology labs.</p>
<p>Lawmakers have pressured America’s spy agencies for more information
about the origins of the virus, which led to lockdowns, economic
upheaval and millions of deaths. It’s a question with significant
domestic and geopolitical implications as the world continues to grapple
with the pandemic’s legacy.</p>
<p>Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, chairman of the Senate
Intelligence Committee, said Saturday he was “pleased the CIA concluded
in the final days of the Biden administration that the lab-leak theory
is the most plausible explanation,” and he commended Ratcliffe for
declassifying the assessment.</p>
<p>“Now, the most important thing is to make China pay for unleashing a
plague on the world,” Cotton said in a statement.</p>
<p>China’s embassy in Washington did not immediately return messages
seeking comment. Chinese authorities have in the past dismissed
speculation about COVID’s origins as unhelpful and motivated by
politics.</p>
<p>While the origin of the virus remains unknown, scientists think the
most likely hypothesis is that it circulated in bats, like many
coronaviruses, before infecting another species, probably racoon dogs,
civet cats or bamboo rats. In turn, the infection spread to humans
handling or butchering those animals at a market in Wuhan, where the
first human cases appeared in late November 2019.</p>
<p>Some official investigations, however, have raised the question of
whether the virus escaped from a lab in Wuhan. Two years ago, a report
by the Energy Department concluded a lab leak was the most likely
origin, though that report also expressed low confidence in the
finding.</p>
<p>The same year then-FBI Director Christopher Wray said his agency
believed the virus “most likely” spread after escaping from a lab.</p>
<p>Ratcliffe, who served as director of national intelligence during
Trump’s first term, has said he favors the lab leak scenario, too.</p>
<p>“The lab leak is the only theory supported by science, intelligence,
and common sense,” Ratcliffe said in 2023.</p>
<p>The CIA said it will continue to evaluate any new information that
could change its assessment.</p>

id="haitian-leader-trump-administrations-deportation-plans-will-be-catastrophic">Haitian
leader: Trump administration’s deportation plans will be
‘catastrophic’</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ROME — The president of Haiti’s transitional presidential council
said the Trump administration’s decisions to freeze aid programs, deport
migrants and block refugees will be “catastrophic” for Haiti.</p>
<p>Leslie Voltaire made the comment in an interview with The Associated
Press in Rome on Saturday following a meeting with Pope Francis at the
Vatican. He visited the pope to ask for help for Haiti.</p>
<p>“I’m knocking on the doors of people who love Haiti. The pope loves
Haiti, and he is eager to help,” Haiti’s interim president said.</p>
<p>The pontiff and Voltaire discussed the dire situation in Haiti where
gangs have killed civilians and operate across the Caribbean nation with
impunity. Half of Haiti’s 11.4 million people are already hungry,
according to Voltaire, and losing humanitarian assistance will make the
situation dramatically worse.</p>
<p>“Trump said that Haiti is a ‘shithole,’ so I don’t think he will care
about Haiti,” Voltaire said, noting that thousands of people are already
being repatriated from the Dominican Republic every week and gangs are
terrorizing the populace. With the new U.S. policies, “the situation
will be catastrophic.”</p>
<p>During his first administration, President Donald Trump used blunt
language to question why the U.S. would accept immigrants from Haiti and
other countries in Africa. At the time, the White House did not deny his
remark but issued a statement saying Trump supports immigration policies
that welcome “those who can contribute to our society.”</p>
<p>Voltaire said there are roughly 1.5 million Haitians in the United
States and roughly 150,000 who were accepted under a program called the
“Temporary Protection System.”</p>
<p>“Trump says that he will expel all of them,” Voltaire said, adding
that Haiti, which is already struggling with hunger and internally
displaced people, cannot handle the influx.</p>
<p>In a report released this month, the U.N. migration agency said
internal displacement within Haiti has tripled over the last year and
now surpasses 1 million people. The situation has been largely caused by
gang violence in the Caribbean country. The new figure provided by the
International Organization for Migration represents a record for
Haiti.</p>
<p>IOM said that “relentless gang violence” in Haitian capital of
Port-au-Prince has fueled a near-doubling of displacement in the city
and a collapse of health care and other services and worsening food
insecurity. About 200,000 people have been forcibly returned to Haiti
over the last year mostly from the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>Voltaire and his transitional government have been tasked with
leading the country to general elections, an elusive goal but he is
convinced they can make it happen by next November despite powerful
gangs that rule 85% of the capital and are gaining ground in surrounding
areas.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Voltaire is positive that — if Haiti’s multinational
police force is boosted with several thousand additional officers — they
can go ahead with elections this year.</p>
<p>Kenya is leading the multinational police force with a total
deployment of more than 600, below the 1,000 officers the country’s
president pledged. An additional 150 Guatemalans and an advance team of
eight Salvadorean troops have also arrived, but the force remains far
below its anticipated strength of 2,500 officers. Voltaire said Benin
has pledged an additional 2,000 soldiers.</p>
<p>“We have to do a referendum on a new constitution and also the
election at the end of November. I say that we can do the elections
because we have like eight departments, like 80% of the country. We can
do the election.”</p>
<p>The power of gangs in Haiti has grown since the 2021 assassination of
President Jovenel Moïse. Some gangs have even indicated they want to be
part of the political process. Voltaire excluded that possibility, “I
don’t think they should be around the table.”</p>
<p>More than 5,600 people were reported killed across Haiti last year,
according to the United Nations. The number of killings increased by
more than 20% compared with all of 2023, according to the U.N. Human
Rights Office.</p>

<h2 id="us-migrant-deportation-flights-arrive-in-latin-america">US
migrant deportation flights arrive in Latin America</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>GUATEMALA CITY, GUATEMALA — U.S. military planes carrying dozens of
expelled migrants arrived in Guatemala, authorities said Friday, as
President Donald Trump moved to crack down on illegal immigration. </p>
<p>A total of 265 Guatemalans arrived on three flights — two operated by
the military, and one a charter, the Central American country’s
migration institute said, updating earlier figures. </p>
<p>Washington also sent four deportation flights to Mexico on Thursday,
the White House press secretary said on X, despite multiple U.S. media
reports that authorities there had turned at least one plane back. </p>
<p>The Mexican government has not confirmed either the arrival of
flights or any agreement to receive a specific number of planes with
deportees. </p>
<p>But Mexico’s foreign ministry said Friday it was ready to work with
Washington over the deportation of its citizens, saying the country
would “always accept the arrival of Mexicans to our territory with open
arms.” </p>
<p>The flights came as the White House said it had arrested more than
1,000 people in two days with hundreds deported by military aircraft,
saying that “the largest massive deportation operation in history is
well underway.” </p>
<p>Some 538 illegal immigrant “criminals” were arrested Thursday, it
said, followed by another 593 on Friday.  </p>
<p>By comparison, under Trump’s predecessor Joe Biden deportation
flights were carried out regularly, with a total of 270,000 deportations
in 2024 — a 10-year record — and 113,400 arrests, making an average of
310 per day. </p>
<p>‘Bad, hard criminals’ </p>
<p>The Guatemalan government did not confirm whether any of the migrants
arrested this week were among the deportees that arrived Friday. </p>
<p>“These are flights that took place after Trump took office,” an
official in the Guatemalan vice president’s office told AFP. </p>
<p>A Pentagon source told AFP that “overnight, two DOD (Department of
Defense) aircraft conducted repatriation flights from the U.S. to
Guatemala.” </p>
<p>Early Friday the White House posted an image on X of men in shackles
being marched into a military aircraft, with the caption: “Deportation
flights have begun.” </p>
<p>Trump told reporters that the flights were to get “the bad, hard
criminals out.” </p>
<p>“Murderers, people that have been as bad as you get. As bad as
anybody you’ve seen,” he said. </p>
<p>Friday’s deportees were taken to a reception center at an air force
base in Guatemala’s capital, away from the media. </p>
<p>Crackdown a campaign promise</p>
<p>Trump promised a crackdown on illegal immigration during the election
campaign and began his second term with a flurry of executive actions
aimed at overhauling entry to the United States.  </p>
<p>On his first day in office, he signed orders declaring a “national
emergency” at the southern border and announced the deployment of more
troops to the area while vowing to deport “criminal aliens.” </p>
<p>His administration said it would also reinstate a “Remain in Mexico”
policy under which people who apply to enter the United States from
Mexico must remain there until their application has been decided. </p>
<p>The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said Friday on X
that program had been reinstated, and that Mexico had deployed some
30,000 National Guard troops to its border. </p>
<p>The Mexican foreign ministry did not confirm either claim in its
statement. </p>
<p>The White House has also halted an asylum program for people fleeing
authoritarian regimes in Central and South America, leaving thousands of
people stranded on the Mexican side of the border.</p>

id="trump-restores-us-participation-in-two-anti-abortion-pacts">Trump
restores US participation in two anti-abortion pacts</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump used his executive authority
Friday to restore U.S. participation in two international anti-abortion
pacts, including one that cuts off U.S. family planning funds for
foreign organizations if they provide or promote abortions.</p>
<p>Trump reinstated the Mexico City Policy, which opponents call the
“global gag rule” because they say it silences pro-choice advocates.
Established by former President Ronald Reagan in 1984, it has been
rescinded by each Democratic president since then and reinstated when a
Republican returns to the White House.</p>
<p>Abortion is a divisive issue in U.S. politics and was a major issue
in the 2024 campaign won by Trump. In 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled
to eliminate a nationwide right to abortion, leaving abortion laws to
each of the 50 states.</p>
<p>Trump said in his memorandum Friday he was directing Secretary of
State Marco Rubio to implement the Mexico City Policy “to ensure that
U.S. taxpayer dollars do not fund organizations or programs that support
or participate in the management of a program of coercive abortion or
involuntary sterilization.”</p>
<p>Democrats and abortion rights advocates contend the rule disrupts
other forms of health care access and blocks nongovernmental
organizations abroad from receiving U.S. funds, even if they use their
own money on abortion care.</p>
<p>Janeen Madan Keller, a policy fellow at the Center for Global
Development, said research showed that the order has led to an increase
in unwanted pregnancies and abortions, counter to its intended
impact.</p>
<p>“Broadly speaking these decisions are going to really set the United
States back in advancing gender equality,” Madan Keller said, in part by
limiting the ability of women and girls to complete school and enter the
workforce.</p>
<p>Rubio also announced Friday the United States was rejoining the
Geneva Consensus Declaration, which critics say aims to limit abortion
access for millions of women and girls around the world.</p>
<p>The declaration was co-sponsored by the United States, Brazil,
Uganda, Egypt, Hungary and Indonesia in 2020, when Trump was in office
during his first term. It now has more than 35 signatories.</p>
<p>The previous Trump administration said the declaration sought better
health care for women and the preservation of human life, while also
strengthening family as the foundational unit of society and protecting
each nation’s sovereignty.</p>
<p>The State Department said Friday that one of the four objectives of
the pact was to “protect life at all stages.”</p>
<p>Trump also issued an executive order related to the Hyde Amendment,
which prohibits the use of federal funds to pay for abortion coverage in
the United States, and rescinded two of predecessor Joe Biden’s
executive orders intending to preserve reproductive health services
after the Supreme Court overturned the Roe v. Wade ruling on
abortion.</p>
<p>“While this EO (executive order) has no immediate impact, it is an
indication of the Trump administration doubling down on denying abortion
access to people with low incomes,” the women’s health care provider
Planned Parenthood said in a statement.</p>

visits Las Vegas casino to promote his plan to not tax tips</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LAS VEGAS, NEVADA — President Donald Trump capped a frenzied first
week back in office with a stop in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Saturday to
talk about cutting taxes on tips, a 2024 campaign promise he made in the
gambling and hospitality hub. </p>
<p>Trump took the stage before cheering supporters at the Circa Resort
and Casino in front of a large banner reading “No Tax on Tips” and said
economic confidence was soaring in the United States. </p>
<p>“America’s decline is over,” he said at the start of his remarks,
echoing themes from his inauguration remarks earlier in the week. </p>
<p>Since taking office Monday, the new Republican president reversed a
myriad of policies put in place by Democratic predecessor Joe Biden and
moved to fulfill his vow of remaking and shrinking the federal
bureaucracy. </p>
<p>In visits Friday to disaster areas in North Carolina and California,
Trump pledged federal aid to help those states recover from hurricane
and wildfires after floating an idea to shutter the Federal Emergency
Management Agency. </p>
<p>In Las Vegas, Trump’s event was designed to highlight a less
controversial pledge to end taxation of income from tips and overtime, a
proposal he first made in June as he courted service workers in the
presidential swing state of Nevada. The tip-heavy hospitality industry
comprises more than a fifth of jobs. </p>
<p>“Can you remember that little statement about tips?” Trump said
during one of several inauguration day speeches Monday. “Anybody
remember that little statement? I think we won Nevada because of that
statement.” </p>
<p>Michael McDonald, Nevada Republican Party chairman, said the idea is
attractive to people in the state who are facing high prices for
essential goods like food and gas. </p>
<p>“He cares about the no tax on tips, no tax on Social Security. That
was something that we brought to the community, and everybody loved it
because we’re all hurting,” McDonald told local television after
welcoming Trump on Friday night. </p>
<p>Trump promised to pursue an aggressive agenda of tax cuts if
re-elected, which may face some hurdles even in a U.S. Congress
controlled by his fellow Republicans. </p>
<p>The proposals Trump made on the campaign trail — from extending his
2017 tax cuts to abolishing tax on tips, overtime and Social Security
benefits — could add $7.5 trillion to the nation’s debt over the next
decade, according to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal
Budget. </p>
<p>Trump is pushing a plan to explicitly use revenue from higher tariffs
on imported goods to help pay for extending trillions of dollars in tax
cuts, an unprecedented shift likely to face opposition from Republican
budget hawks concerned about the reliability and durability of tariff
revenue. </p>
<p>Days before he returned to office, some of his Republican allies in
Congress warned that Trump’s aggressive tax-cut agenda could fall victim
to signs of worry in the bond market. </p>
<p>At a closed-door meeting on Capitol Hill, Republicans in the House of
Representatives aired concerns that the estimated $4 trillion cost over
the next 10 years of extending the 2017 Trump tax cuts could undermine
the U.S. government’s ability to service its $36 trillion in debt, which
is growing at a pace of $2 trillion a year.</p>

<h2 id="trump-fires-independent-inspectors-general-at-us-agencies">Trump
fires independent inspectors general at US agencies</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Trump administration has fired about 17 independent
inspectors general at government agencies, a sweeping action to remove
oversight of his new administration that some members of Congress are
suggesting violated federal oversight laws.</p>
<p>The dismissals began Friday night and were effective immediately,
according to two people familiar with the actions. They spoke on
condition of anonymity to provide details that have not been made
public. Neither confirmed the exact number of firings, but an email sent
by one of the fired inspectors general said “roughly 17” inspectors
general had been removed.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump confirmed the move in a conversation with
reporters aboard Air Force One on Saturday, claiming, “it’s a very
common thing to do.” He said he would “put good people in there that
will be very good.”</p>
<p>Congress was not given the legally required 30-day notices about the
removals — something that even a top Republican is decrying.</p>
<p>“There may be good reason the IGs were fired. We need to know that if
so,” Sen. Chuck Grassley, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said
in a statement. “I’d like further explanation from President Trump.
Regardless, the 30-day detailed notice of removal that the law demands
was not provided to Congress,” said Grassley, R-Iowa.</p>
<p>The role of the modern-day inspector general dates to post-Watergate
Washington, when Congress installed offices inside agencies as an
independent check against mismanagement and abuse of power. Though
inspectors general are presidential appointees, some serve presidents of
both parties. All are expected to be nonpartisan.</p>
<p>Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., acknowledged that the firings violated
statutes but shrugged it off: “Just tell them you need to follow the law
next time,” he said.</p>
<p>Democrats and watchdog groups, however, used the dismissals to raise
alarm that Trump was making it easier to take advantage of the
government.</p>
<p>“Inspectors general are the cops on the beat preventing bad things
from happening,” Max Stier, president and CEO of the nonpartisan
Partnership for Public Service, said in a statement. “Their work saves
the taxpayer tens of billions of dollars every year.”</p>
<p>The White House did not comment on Saturday. Trump was in Las Vegas
for a speech focused on his campaign promise to end federal taxation on
tips.</p>
<p>But the moves were consistent with the president’s first week back in
the White House, which has featured a series of steps to remake the
federal government. Trump has done everything from using executive
orders to impose hiring freezes and crack down on diversity, equity and
inclusion initiatives, to suggesting that he wants to shutter the
Federal Emergency Management Agency and leave disaster recovery up to
individual states affected by major emergencies.</p>
<p>“Yesterday, in the dark of night, President Trump fired at least 12
independent inspector generals at important federal agencies across the
administration,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said
Saturday on the chamber’s floor. “This is a chilling purge, and it’s a
preview of the lawless approach Donald Trump and his administration are
taking far too often as he’s becoming president.”</p>
<p>Schumer said the dismissals are “possibly in violation of federal
law” and help demonstrate that the move “is a glaring sign that it’s a
golden age for abuse in government and even corruption.”</p>
<p>The Washington Post, which first reported the firings, said that many
were appointees from Trump’s first term. Among those inspectors general
reportedly removed included those for the departments of Agriculture,
Commerce, Defense and Education.</p>
<p>In a lengthy statement Saturday, Hannibal Ware, the chairman of the
Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, an
independent entity that represents the interests of government
watchdogs, noted that inspectors general conduct their “oversight in a
strictly non-partisan manner. They are appointed, by law, without regard
to their political affiliation and, during their tenures, they work
effectively across Administrations and with Congress, without regard to
political party.”</p>
<p>He suggested that the firings violated the legal requirements that
presidents notify Congress 30 days before firing an inspector general
and provide a detailed rationale for the decision.</p>
<p>“IGs are not immune from removal. However, the law must be followed
to protect independent government oversight for America,” the statement
said.</p>
<p>Spared in this round of dismissals, however, was Michael Horowitz,
the longtime Justice Department inspector general who has issued reports
on assorted politically explosive criminal investigations over the past
decade.</p>
<p>In December 2019, for instance, Horowitz released a report faulting
the FBI for surveillance warrant applications in the investigation into
ties between Russia and Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. But the
report also found that the investigation had been opened for a
legitimate purpose and did not find evidence that partisan bias had
guided investigative decisions.</p>
<p>“Michael Horowitz we’re keeping,” Trump said Saturday, calling his
2019 findings “such an accurate, well-done report.”</p>
<p>Horowitz’s status aside, the move against the watchdogs drew
criticism from congressional Democrats.</p>
<p>Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., said inspectors general are “critical to
rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse throughout the federal government.”
The mass firings were “alarming,” she said.</p>
<p>Rep. Gerald Connolly of Virginia, a Democrat who is the ranking
member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, called
it a “coup to overthrow legally protected independent inspectors
general.”</p>
<p>He also suggested that the move — coming on just the fourth full day
of Trump’s second term — could potentially free up a series of positions
that can subsequently be filled with loyalists who are strongly
sympathetic to the Trump administration.</p>
<p>“Replacing independent inspectors general with political hacks will
harm every American who relies on Social Security, veterans’ benefits,
and a fair hearing at IRS on refunds and audits,” Connolly said.</p>
<p>Still, Trump has aggressively challenged the authority of independent
agency watchdog groups in the past.</p>
<p>In 2020, he replaced multiple key inspectors general, including those
leading the Defense Department and intelligence community, as well as
the inspector general tapped to chair a special oversight board for the
$2.2 trillion economic relief package on the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts called Trump’s
actions “a purge of independent watchdogs in the middle of the
night.”</p>
<p>“Inspectors general are charged with rooting out government waste,
fraud, abuse, and preventing misconduct,” Warren posted on X. “President
Trump is dismantling checks on his power and paving the way for
widespread corruption.”</p>

Tech wants data centers plugged into power plants; utilities balk</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>HARRISBURG, PENNSYLVANIA — Looking for a quick fix for their
fast-growing electricity diets, tech giants are increasingly looking to
strike deals with power plant owners to plug in directly, avoiding a
potentially longer and more expensive process of hooking into a fraying
electric grid that serves everyone else. </p>
<p>It’s raising questions over whether diverting power to higher-paying
customers will leave enough for others and whether it’s fair to excuse
big power users from paying for the grid. Federal regulators are trying
to figure out what to do about it, and quickly. </p>
<p>Front and center is the data center that Amazon’s cloud computing
subsidiary, Amazon Web Services, is building next to the Susquehanna
nuclear plant in eastern Pennsylvania. </p>
<p>The arrangement between the plant’s owners and AWS — called a “behind
the meter” connection — is the first to come before the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission. For now, FERC has rejected a deal that could
eventually send 960 megawatts — about 40% of the plant’s capacity — to
the data center. That’s enough to power more than 500,000 homes. </p>
<p>That leaves the deal and others that likely would follow in limbo.
It’s not clear when FERC, which blocked the deal on procedural grounds,
will take up the matter again or how the change in presidential
administrations might affect things. </p>
<p>“The companies, they’re very frustrated because they have a business
opportunity now that’s really big,” said Bill Green, the director of the
MIT Energy Initiative. “And if they’re delayed five years in the queue,
for example — I don’t know if it would be five years, but years anyway —
they might completely miss the business opportunity.” </p>
<p>Driving demand for energy-hungry data centers </p>
<p>The rapid growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence has
fueled demand for data centers that need power to run servers, storage
systems, networking equipment and cooling systems. </p>
<p>That’s spurred proposals to bring nuclear power plants out of
retirement, develop small modular nuclear reactors, and build
utility-scale renewable installations or new natural gas plants. In
December, California-based Oklo announced an agreement to provide 12
gigawatts to data center developer Switch from small nuclear reactors
powered by nuclear waste. </p>
<p>Federal officials say fast development of data centers is vital to
the economy and national security, including to keep pace with China in
the artificial intelligence race. </p>
<p>For AWS, the deal with Susquehanna satisfies its need for reliable
power that meets its internal requirements for sources that don’t emit
planet-warming greenhouse gases, such as coal, oil or gas-fueled
plants. </p>
<p>Big Tech also wants to stand up their centers fast. But tech’s
voracious appetite for energy comes at a time when the power supply is
already strained by efforts to shift away from planet-warming fossil
fuels. </p>
<p>They can build data centers in a couple years, said Aaron Tinjum of
the Data Center Coalition. But in some areas, getting connected to the
congested electricity grid can take four years, and sometimes much more,
he said. </p>
<p>Plugging directly into a power plant would take years off their
development timelines. </p>
<p>What’s in it for power providers </p>
<p>In theory, the AWS deal would let Susquehanna sell power for more
than they get by selling into the grid. Talen Energy, Susquehanna’s
majority owner, projected the deal would bring as much as $140 million
in electricity sales in 2028, though it didn’t disclose exactly how much
AWS will pay for the power. </p>
<p>The profit potential is one that other nuclear plant operators are
embracing after years of financial distress and frustration with how
they are paid in the broader electricity markets. Many say they’ve been
forced to compete in some markets flooded with cheap natural gas and
state-subsidized solar and wind energy. </p>
<p>Power plant owners also say the arrangement benefits the wider
public, by bypassing the costly buildout of long power lines and leaving
more transmission capacity on the grid for everyone else. </p>
<p>FERC’s big decision </p>
<p>A favorable ruling from FERC could open the door to many more huge
data centers and other massive power users like hydrogen plants and
bitcoin miners, analysts say. </p>
<p>FERC’s 2-1 rejection in November was procedural. Recent comments by
commissioners suggest they weren’t ready to decide how to regulate such
a novel matter without more study. </p>
<p>In the meantime, the agency is hearing arguments for and against the
Susquehanna-AWS deal. </p>
<p>Monitoring Analytics, the market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid,
wrote in a filing to FERC that the impact would be “extreme” if the
Susquehanna-AWS model were extended to all nuclear power plants in the
territory. </p>
<p>Energy prices would increase significantly and there’s no explanation
for how rising demand for power will be met even before big power plants
drop out of the supply mix, it said. </p>
<p>Separately, two electric utility owners — which make money in
deregulated states from building out the grid and delivering power —
have protested that the Susquehanna-AWS arrangement amounts to
freeloading off a grid that ordinary customers pay to build and
maintain. Chicago-based Exelon and Columbus, Ohio-based American
Electric Power say the Susquehanna-AWS arrangement would allow AWS to
avoid $140 million a year that it would otherwise owe. </p>
<p>Susquehanna’s owners say the data center won’t be on the grid and
question why it should have to pay to maintain it. But critics contend
that the power plant itself is benefiting from taxpayer subsidies and
ratepayer-subsidized services — and shouldn’t be able to strike deals
with private customers that could increase costs for others. </p>
<p>FERC’s decision will have “massive repercussions for the entire
country” because it will set a precedent for how FERC and grid operators
will handle the waiting avalanche of similar requests from data center
companies and nuclear plants, said Jackson Morris of the Natural
Resources Defense Council. </p>
<p>Stacey Burbure, a vice president for American Electric Power, told
FERC at a hearing in November that it needs to move quickly. </p>
<p>“The timing of this issue is before us,” she said, “and if we take
our typical five years to get this perfect, it will be too late.”</p>

<h2 id="us-senate-confirms-noem-as-homeland-security-secretary">US
Senate confirms Noem as homeland security secretary</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Senate confirmed Kristi Noem as homeland security
secretary Saturday, putting the South Dakota governor in charge of a
sprawling agency that is essential to national security and President
Donald Trump’s plans to clamp down on illegal immigration. </p>
<p>Republicans kept the Senate working Saturday to install the latest
member of Trump’s national security team. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth
was confirmed in a dramatic tie-breaking vote Friday night, joining
Secretary of State Marco Rubio and CIA Director John Ratcliffe. The
Senate will next vote Monday evening on Scott Bessent’s confirmation as
treasury secretary. </p>
<p>Noem, a Trump ally who is in her second term as governor, received
some support from Democrats on the Senate Homeland Security and
Governmental Affairs Committee when it voted 13-2 to advance her
nomination earlier in the week. Republicans, who already hold the votes
necessary to confirm her, have also expressed confidence in her
determination to lead border security and immigration enforcement. </p>
<p>“Fixing this crisis and restoring respect for the rule of law is one
of President Trump and Republicans’ top priorities,” Senate Majority
Leader John Thune, Republican from South Dakota, said Friday. “And it’s
going to require a decisive and committed leader at the Department of
Homeland Security. I believe Kristi has everything it takes to undertake
this task.” </p>
<p>Democrats are split on how to handle border enforcement and
immigration under Trump, with some warming to his hard-line stand. </p>
<p>Still, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said he
would vote against Noem. He pointed to “bipartisan solutions to fix the
mess at our border,” adding that Noem “seems headed in the wrong
direction.” </p>
<p>The homeland security secretary oversees U.S. Customs and Border
Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Citizenship and
Immigration Services. Beyond those agencies, the department is also
responsible for securing airline transportation, protecting dignitaries,
responding to natural disasters and more. </p>
<p>Trump is planning major changes to how the department functions,
including involving the military in immigration enforcement and
reshaping the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Those plans could
immediately put Noem in the spotlight after the new president visited
recent disaster sites in North Carolina and California on Friday. </p>
<p>During her Senate hearing, Noem was repeatedly asked by Democratic
senators whether she would administer disaster aid to states even if
Trump asked her not to. </p>
<p>Noem avoided saying she would defy the president, but she told
lawmakers, “I will deliver the programs according to the law and that it
will be done with no political bias.” </p>
<p>Six people cycled through as homeland security secretary during
Trump’s first four years in office. </p>
<p>Noem, who held her state’s lone U.S. House seat for eight years
before becoming governor in 2019, has risen in the GOP by tacking
closely with Trump. At one point, she was even considered to be his
running mate. </p>
<p>Her political stock took a momentary dip, however, when she released
a book last year containing an account of her killing her hunting dog,
as well as a false claim that she once met with North Korean leader Kim
Jong Un. </p>
<p>If confirmed, she would be tasked with delivering on Trump’s favorite
issue, border security. The president’s goals of deporting millions of
people who entered the country illegally could put Noem, with her
experience governing a rural state and growing up on a farm, in a
difficult position. In South Dakota, many migrants, some in the country
without permanent legal status, power the labor-heavy jobs that produce
food and housing. </p>
<p>She has so far pledged to faithfully execute the president’s orders
and copied his talk of an “invasion” at the U.S. border with
Mexico. </p>
<p>Noem joined other Republican governors who sent National Guard troops
to Texas to assist Operation Lone Star, which sought to discourage
migrants. Her decision was especially criticized because she accepted a
$1 million donation from a Tennessee billionaire to cover some of the
deployment cost. </p>
<p>Noem said she opted to send National Guard troops “because of this
invasion,” adding that “it is a war zone down there.”</p>

proposes ‘getting rid of FEMA’ while touring disaster areas</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — U.S. President Donald Trump surveyed disaster zones in
California and North Carolina on Friday and said he was considering
“getting rid of” the Federal Emergency Management Agency, offering the
latest sign of how he is weighing sweeping changes to the nation’s
central organization for responding to disasters.</p>
<p>In fire-ravaged California, the state’s Democratic leaders pressed
Trump for federal assistance that he’s threatened to hold up, some
setting aside their past differences to shower him with praise. Trump,
in turn, pressured local officials to waive permitting requirements so
people can immediately rebuild, pledging that federal permits would be
granted promptly.</p>
<p>Instead of having federal financial assistance flow through FEMA, the
Republican president said Washington could provide money directly to the
states. He made the comments while visiting North Carolina, which is
still recovering months after Hurricane Helene, on the first trip of his
second term.</p>
<p>“FEMA has been a very big disappointment,” the Republican president
said. “It’s very bureaucratic. And it’s very slow.”</p>
<p>Trump was greeted in California by Governor Gavin Newsom, a Trump
critic whom the president frequently disparages. The duo chatted amiably
and gestured toward cooperation despite their history.</p>
<p>“We’re going to need your support. We’re going to need your help,”
Newsom told Trump. “You were there for us during COVID. I don’t forget
that, and I have all the expectations we’ll be able to work together to
get a speedy recovery.”</p>
<p>Newsom has praised Trump before when looking for help from the
federal government. In the early months of the coronavirus pandemic, he
called Trump “thoughtful” and “collaborative.”</p>
<p>Trump flew over several devastated neighborhoods in Marine One, the
presidential helicopter, before landing in Pacific Palisades, a hard-hit
community that’s home to some of Southern California’s rich and famous.
Accompanied by first lady Melania Trump, he walked a street where all
the houses have burned, chatting with residents and police officers.</p>
<p>It takes seeing the damage firsthand to grasp its enormity, Trump
said after. The fires, which continue to burn, could end up being the
costliest natural disasters in U.S. history.</p>
<p>“It is devastation. It really is an incineration,” Trump said.</p>
<p>Trump’s brief but friendly interaction with Newsom belied the
confrontational stance he signaled toward California earlier in the day.
Even on the plane en route to Los Angeles, White House press secretary
Karoline Leavitt was using Trump’s disparaging nickname for the
governor, “Newscum,” and telling reporters, “He has wronged the people
of his state” and saying Trump was visiting to pressure Newsom and other
officials “to do right by their citizens.”</p>
<p>Trump said Los Angeles residents who lost their homes should be able
to get back onto their properties immediately to clear them, adding
several told him it will be months before they can rebuild.</p>
<p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said residents should be able to return
home within the week, but keeping people safe from hazardous materials
is a top priority. She said the city was easing the process to get
permits, but she was repeatedly interrupted by Trump as she tried to
explain the city’s efforts. He downplayed the concerns about toxins,
saying: “What’s hazardous waste? We’re going to have to define
that.”</p>
<p>Trump has a long history of minimizing the risks of asbestos. In his
1997 book, The Art of the Comeback, Trump called asbestos “the greatest
fireproofing material ever used” and “100% safe, once applied,” and
claimed the movement against the insulator was led by the mob, “because
it was often mob-related companies that would do the asbestos
removal.”</p>
<p>Before flying to California, Trump reiterated that he wants to
extract concessions from the Democratic-led state in return for disaster
assistance, including changes to water policies and requirements that
voters need to show identification when casting ballots.</p>
<p>Beyond Trump’s criticism of FEMA, he’s suggested limiting the federal
government’s role in responding to disasters, echoing comments from
conservative allies who have proposed reducing funding and
responsibility.</p>
<p>“I’d like to see the states take care of disasters,” he said in North
Carolina. “Let the state take care of the tornadoes and the hurricanes
and all of the other things that happen.”</p>
<p>Trump said Michael Whatley, a North Carolina native and chair of the
Republican National Committee, would help coordinate recovery efforts in
the state, where frustrations over the federal response have lingered.
Although Whatley does not hold an official government position, Trump
said he would be “very much in charge.”</p>
<p>FEMA helps respond to disasters when local leaders request a
presidential emergency declaration, a signal that the damage is beyond
the state’s ability to handle on its own. FEMA can reimburse governments
for recovery efforts such as debris removal, and it gives stopgap
financial assistance to individual residents.</p>
<p>Trump has criticized former President Joe Biden for his
administration’s response to Helene in North Carolina. As he left the
White House on Friday morning, he told reporters that “it’s been a
horrible thing the way that’s been allowed to fester” since the storm
hit in September, and “we’re going to get it fixed up.</p>
<p>In a small town in western North Carolina, residents told Trump about
wading through waist-deep water to escape from their homes while fearing
for their lives. Some have battled with insurance companies to get their
losses covered.</p>
<p>“We’ve come to North Carolina with a simple message,” Trump said.
“You are not forgotten any longer. You were treated very badly by the
previous administration.”</p>
<p>FEMA has distributed $319 million in financial assistance to
residents, but that hasn’t alleviated the feeling of abandonment among
residents who are struggling to rebuild their lives.</p>
<p>Michael A. Coen Jr., who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the
Biden administration, said Trump was “misinformed” about an agency that
provides critical help to states when they are overwhelmed by
catastrophe.</p>
<p>In addition, Coen criticized the idea of attaching strings to
assistance. “I think the American people expect the federal government
will be there for them on their worst day, no matter where they live,”
he said.</p>
<p>Trump tapped Cameron Hamilton, a former Navy SEAL with limited
experience managing natural disasters, as FEMA’s acting director.</p>

<h2 id="what-south-asian-nations-expect-from-trump">What South Asian
nations expect from Trump</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — As President Donald Trump’s second term gets underway,
the contours of his administration’s South Asia policy are taking shape:
India stands front and center, while other regional countries like
Bangladesh and Pakistan prepare to be sidelined.  </p>
<p>“With the exception of India, which is a large but special case, the
other countries in South Asia, I think, are positioning themselves for
somewhat less attention from Washington, somewhat less predictability,
and somewhat more bilateral engagement operating through multilateral
organizations or multilateral channels,” said Joshua White, a former
director for South Asian Affairs at the National Security Council who is
now a professor at Johns Hopkins SAIS. </p>
<p>India </p>
<p>The Trump administration’s regional priorities were on full display
at the president’s inauguration Monday. While Bangladesh and Pakistan
were relegated to sending their ambassadors to the event, India’s
foreign minister, S. Jaishankar, got a coveted front-row seat. </p>
<p>“It was very clear the Trump administration was keen to have India
present at the inauguration,” Jaishankar said at a Wednesday news
conference. “They’re clearly prioritizing the bilateral
relationship.” </p>
<p>While the Biden administration worked closely with India on a range
of issues, including defense and technology, Indian officials see
Trump’s return to office as an opportunity for expanded cooperation.
Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s warm relationship,
forged during Trump’s first term, promises a deeper partnership,
officials and experts say. </p>
<p>In October, Trump called Modi “a great friend” and “the nicest human
being.” Modi reciprocated in his congratulatory message, calling Trump a
“dear friend” and pledging to work “closely together once again.” </p>
<p>Beyond the rapport the two leaders share, India, South Asia’s largest
country, is a strategic U.S. ally and a counterweight to China’s
expanding influence in Asia.  The U.S. is also India’s second-largest
trading partner after China.    </p>
<p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio and national security adviser, Mike
Waltz, both China hawks and staunch India proponents, are expected to
push for deeper bilateral engagement with New Delhi.  </p>
<p>Underlying India’s importance, Rubio had his first bilateral meeting
with Jaishankar.    </p>
<p>“There was a very visible appetite to get this relationship moving,
to do more, to raise the bar, to set bigger goals,” Jaishankar said.
 </p>
<p>An early focus in the U.S.-India relationship: mass deportation of
undocumented Indian immigrants.  </p>
<p>India has identified 18,000 undocumented Indian migrants for
repatriation to India, Bloomberg news reported this week, showing
support for a Trump administration priority.    </p>
<p>There are nearly 800,000 undocumented Indians living in the U.S.,
including tens of thousands who illegally entered the country under the
Biden administration.    </p>
<p>Jaishankar said India is opposed to illegal migration and open to the
return of illegal migrants.   </p>
<p>Yet challenges remain in the relationship. Visa delays experienced by
Indian citizens “constrain the people-to-people interactions,” he said.
  </p>
<p>Moreover, the Trump administration’s pivot to other geopolitical
issues, from the war in Ukraine to the relationship with China, could
overshadow relations with India, experts say.   </p>
<p>“If they have anything significant to be anxious about, apart from
the immigration questions, it will be that this administration will not
be as attentive to South Asia as the last administration was,” White
said. </p>
<p>Pakistan </p>
<p>Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif used an optimistic tone on
Trump’s inauguration day, pledging to work with the new president to
strengthen the U.S.- Pakistan relationship. </p>
<p>“Over the years, our two great countries have worked together closely
to pursue peace and prosperity in the region and beyond for our peoples
&amp; we shall continue to do so in the future,” Sharif wrote on X
Monday.   </p>
<p>To engage with the new administration, Islamabad dispatched Interior
Minister Mohsin Naqvi to Washington to meet with members of Trump’s
foreign policy team as well as congressional leaders, a leading
Pakistani newspaper called Dawn, reported Friday.  </p>
<p>Yet U.S.-Pakistan ties remain strained. Early in his first term,
Trump suspended most security aid to Pakistan, accusing it of harboring
terrorism, before gradually resuming cooperation as his administration
began to negotiate an agreement with Afghanistan’s Taliban.  </p>
<p>Complicating the prospects for improved ties between Washington and
Islamabad, Pakistan’s former Prime Minister Imran Khan remains in
prison, with many members of Congress and some Trump advisers calling
for his release.  </p>
<p>Alluding to those calls, a Pakistani foreign office spokesperson
cautioned Thursday against interference in Pakistan’s internal affairs,
even as he reiterated hopes for expanded bilateral ties.  </p>
<p>“This is part of the principles on which interstate relations are
shaped,” the spokesperson, Shafqat Ali Khan, said, according to Dawn.
   </p>
<p>Zamir Akram, a former Pakistan ambassador, noted that Washington
tends to view Islamabad through its strategic alliance with China and
tensions with India.   </p>
<p>“So, this is a difficult environment that we’ll face,” Akram said on
a podcast hosted by the Islamabad Policy Research Institute. </p>
<p>Bangladesh </p>
<p>Bangladesh presents another complex case in the Trump
administration’s approach to South Asia.  </p>
<p>Following Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s ouster last August, the
interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus received a wide
range of support from the Biden administration.  </p>
<p>That support is now on the chopping block. Yunus, who has been
critical of Trump in the past, nonetheless voiced cautious optimism
about bilateral cooperation with the new U.S. administration. </p>
<p>In his congratulatory message to Trump, Yunus “expressed firm belief
that both nations would work together to explore new avenues of
cooperation,” according to the Bangladesh foreign ministry.   </p>
<p>The country’s two leading parties — the Bangladesh Nationalist Party
and the Awami League — urged continued U.S. support for Bangladeshi
democracy and development.   </p>
<p>“As a democratic country, I expect America and other democratic
nations to support and cooperate in favor of democracy,” BNP Secretary
General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir told VOA. “I believe the United
States will assist in fostering democracy and development in our
country.” </p>
<p>But Mohammad A. Arafat, a member of the Awami League’s central
executive committee and a former state minister, criticizing the Biden
administration’s policy, urged a course correction. </p>
<p>“Unlike the Biden administration, which showed unwavering support for
individuals like Dr. Yunus despite allegations of corruption, the Trump
administration adopts a non-interventionist approach, refraining from
interfering in other countries’ internal affairs,” Arafat told VOA. </p>
<p>VOA’s Bangla Service contributed to this report.</p>

id="how-the-oldest-known-hebrew-book-landed-in-a-washington-museum">How
the oldest known Hebrew book landed in a Washington museum</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>In 2016, Herschel Hepler was browsing Google Images to practice his
paleography — the study of historical writing systems — when he stumbled
upon an eerily familiar photo that would lead to a groundbreaking
discovery.</p>
<p>“I recognized it immediately and said, ‘That’s a manuscript in our
collection,’” Hepler, a curator at the Museum of the Bible in
Washington, recalls.</p>
<p>The museum had recently acquired the manuscript — a rare Jewish
prayer book — believing it to be part of the famous Cairo Geniza, a
trove of ancient Jewish documents uncovered in a Cairo synagogue in the
late 19th century.</p>
<p>But the black and white picture in Tablet magazine described the
manuscript as a “16th to 17th century Hebrew book of Psalms, said to be
from the Bamiyan area” of central Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Stunned by the revelation, Hepler set out to verify it. Tracking down
the author of the Tablet article, British historian and archaeologist
Jonathan Lee, Hepler confirmed that Lee had in fact found the book in an
Afghan warlord’s possession in 1998 and photographed the cover and two
inside pages.</p>
<p>“Without Jonathan’s documentation from his trip to Bamiyan in 1998,
we would still be assuming this is probably from the Cairo Geniza,”
Hepler said.</p>
<p>But if Hepler was surprised to learn about the book’s origin in the
remote mountains of Afghanistan, Lee was equally stunned when Hepler
revealed that the manuscript had been carbon-dated to at least the 9th
century.</p>
<p>“At that point, I realized that the discovery was of major
importance,” Lee said via email.</p>
<p>Recognizing their combined expertise — Hepler in Hebrew manuscripts
and Lee in Afghan history — the duo joined forces and invited in other
experts.</p>
<p>Their yearslong research not only established the manuscript as the
oldest-known Hebrew book but also unearthed evidence that Jews had lived
in Afghanistan — and along the ancient Silk Roads — for longer than
historians previously believed.</p>
<p>But the thrill of discovery was dampened by the realization that the
manuscript had probably been smuggled out of war-torn Afghanistan and
bought on the antiquities market.</p>
<p>At the time, the museum, founded by the Green family, owners of the
Hobby Lobby arts and craft company, was still reeling from its
acquisition of artifacts smuggled from Iraq and Egypt.</p>
<p>The museum faced a significant challenge: Before it could showcase it
to the world, it needed to legitimize its ownership of the manuscript.
This required years of delicate negotiations with New York’s small
Afghan Jewish community and an Afghan government teetering on the brink
of collapse. The stakes were high, and the path to secure the
manuscript’s rightful place in the museum would prove be too complex and
demanding.</p>
<p>Lee’s discovery</p>
<p>Lee, who has spent the better part of the last five decades
researching and writing about Afghan history and archaeology, discovered
the book by chance.</p>
<p>In April 1998, he was guiding a Japanese TV crew in Bamiyan and was
on the lookout for a Bactrian language inscription and gold coins looted
from an ancient Buddhist shrine.</p>
<p>At the time, the Bamiyan Valley, with its famed Buddha statues still
standing, was controlled by a local Shiite insurgent group, while the
Taliban ruled most of the rest of the country.</p>
<p>The anti-Taliban group’s leader, Karim Khalili, kept a collection of
antiquities, among them the cache of gold coins Lee had been looking
for. Lee photographed them.</p>
<p>“Then, his [Khalili’s] advisers brought in a miscellaneous collection
of other antiquities that included the ALQ,” Lee said, using the acronym
for the “Afghan Liturgical Quire,” the Hebrew book in the Bible Museum’s
collection.</p>
<p>A local man affiliated with the Shiite insurgent group had found the
book under a collapsed roof in a cave the prior year and given it to
Khalili.</p>
<p>Unversed in Hebrew, Khalili apparently showed the book to other
foreigners visiting Bamiyan, trying to figure out what it was.</p>
<p>“I was told it had been found in Bamiyan, but then everything is
found in Bamiyan,” Lee said.</p>
<p>As Lee recalls, the pocket-size book looked remarkably well-preserved
for its age.</p>
<p>“The cover was somewhat bent, damaged and watermarked, but the folios
were relatively well-preserved, and most of the texts readable,” he
said.</p>
<p>To Lee, that suggested the manuscript was “not that old.” He left
Afghanistan and for years didn’t give it much thought.</p>
<p>How and when the manuscript left Afghanistan remains unknown.</p>
<p>The 1990s were a dark period for Afghanistan’s rich cultural
heritage. As armed groups fought over territory, their men — often
directed by their commanders and guided by traffickers — plundered the
country’s vast archaeological sites and ransacked its museums. Seventy
percent of the national museum’s treasures vanished, according to one
estimate, many ending up in private collections and some reputable
institutions.</p>
<p>“There is a long history of illicit export of antiquities from the
country that goes back for decades but ultimately back to colonial
times,” said Cecilia Palombo, a University of Chicago professor who has
researched the plunder of Afghan antiquities.</p>
<p>A leading researcher with extensive experience in Afghanistan said
the manuscript was likely taken out of the country after the Taliban
overran Bamiyan in late 1998. The researcher spoke on condition of
anonymity.</p>
<p>Research by the Bible museum found that an unnamed Khalili deputy
made multiple sales attempts in the United States and Europe between
1998 and 2001 before “apparently” offloading it to a private collector
in London in fall 2001. The collector kept it for a decade or more
before Hobby Lobby bought it in 2013 and donated it to the museum.</p>
<p>The office of Khalili, who later served as a vice president, declined
a VOA interview request.</p>
<p>The Tablet article</p>
<p>Although Lee had found the book in Afghanistan, he didn’t know how
significant it was. On returning to England, he showed his photographs
to a Hebrew specialist, who thought it was from the 16th or 17th
century.</p>
<p>Then, after a cache of ancient documents dubbed the “Afghan Geniza”
surfaced on the international art market, Lee decided to publish his
photograph, along with an article about Afghan Jewish history. Citing
the book as an example of “Jewish material [turning up] occasionally” in
Afghanistan, he wrote that the “whereabouts of this manuscript is now
unknown.”</p>
<p>He would find out four years later. That’s when, “out of the blue,”
Hepler contacted him via LinkedIn and told him the manuscript was not
the Book of Psalms but a prayer book, comprising Sabbath prayers, poetry
and a partial Haggadah, the Jewish text recited at the Passover
seder.</p>
<p>The Green family bought the book from an Israeli antiquities dealer
in 2013 during a buying spree of ancient artifacts. Some of these items
were later returned after it was discovered they had been illegally
taken out of Iraq and Egypt.</p>
<p>The Afghan Liturgical Quire came with a forged provenance of its own,
tracing the manuscript to collectors in London in the 1950s, masking any
ties to Afghanistan. With Lee’s documentation, the museum was able to
correct its provenance.</p>
<p>The museum had initially thought the book was from the 9th century,
but a second carbon-dating test performed in 2019 showed it dates to the
8th century, making it two centuries older than the previous
oldest-known Hebrew book in the world.</p>
<p>The discovery electrified experts.</p>
<p>For Hebrew scholars, the discovery offered the earliest evidence of a
bound Hebrew book.</p>
<p>For Afghanistan specialists, it highlighted “how significant this
region was in respect of the history of the Middle East, Inner Asia and
Northern India, and Afghanistan’s ancient connectivity with cultures and
religious traditions,” Lee said.</p>
<p>Yet the realization that it had been smuggled out of Afghanistan cast
a cloud over its legitimacy.</p>
<p>Afghan laws and the 1970 UNESCO Convention make it illegal to export
cultural artifacts and heritage items without government approval.</p>
<p>To legitimize its custody of the manuscript, the museum adopted what
it calls a “human rights-based approach” to cultural heritage.</p>
<p>Invoking the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the museum argued
that the Afghan people and Afghan Jews living in New York have a right
to access the manuscript.</p>
<p>“One of the things this project is focused on is on access — so,
access to the Afghan Jewish community, access to the people of
Afghanistan,” Hepler said.</p>
<p>To get the backing of both stakeholders, the museum initiated
discussions with officials of the former Afghan government and members
of the Jewish community in New York.</p>
<p>These efforts culminated in the signing of a memorandum of
understanding in 2021 with the Afghan embassy in Washington before the
Taliban takeover, ensuring the document would be held in
custodianship.</p>
<p>The Afghan ambassador at the time, Roya Rahmani, did not respond to a
request for an interview. Another former Afghan ambassador wrote a
letter of support for the project.</p>
<p>Jack Abraham, head of the Afghan Jewish Federation who was born in
Afghanistan, said his group offered its full support for keeping the
manuscript in the United States.</p>
<p>“I told [Hepler], ‘What you have in your hands is our heritage. It
belongs to us. It could be any of our forefathers,’” Abraham said.</p>
<p>But some Afghans see it as equally part of their heritage.</p>
<p>“This is the property of Afghanistan and must be returned to
Afghanistan,” a senior former government official said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>Barnett Rubin, a leading Afghanistan scholar and an advisor on the
ALQ project, said both communities can legitimately lay claim to the
book.</p>
<p>“The museum wanted to have the approval of any one of the two main
entities that might have a claim on it to their custody of it,” Rubin
said.</p>
<p>With a custodianship agreement secured, the museum launched an
exhibit in September, celebrating the project as an interfaith
collaboration among Jews, Christians and Muslims.</p>
<p>A second exhibit is planned for New York starting this month.</p>
<p>While the Bible Museum technically owns the manuscript, Hepler said
Afghanistan and the Afghan Jewish community “have a lot of agency in
this custodianship.” To that end, the museum plans to provide one
high-quality replica to the Jewish community and three to major cultural
institutions in Afghanistan.</p>

<h2 id="buoyed-by-trumps-promises-uzbeks-seek-closer-ties-to-us">Buoyed
by Trump’s promises, Uzbeks seek closer ties to US</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>TASHKENT, UZBEKISTAN/WASHINGTON — Uzbekistan is expected to push to
deepen relations with the United States in the coming year, a position
that is broadly popular among Uzbeks across the country, VOA found
during a recent reporting trip.</p>
<p>With more than 37 million people, Uzbekistan, Washington’s strategic
partner in Central Asia, accounts for more than half of the population
of the region, which includes Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and
Turkmenistan.</p>
<p>“I understand that the U.S. prefers dealing with us in the C5+1
format — five republics plus Uncle Sam — but we want more bilateral
attention, at least for now,” said Sherbek Artikov, a young Uzbek hoping
to study political science in America.</p>
<p>Artikov is aware that many of his fellow Uzbeks are often denied U.S.
visas and that hundreds of them have been deported since 2019 as
undocumented immigrants. Yet, he remains optimistic: “I believe over
time, Washington will see that Uzbeks are not only reliable strategic
partners but also hardworking, compassionate people — both as migrants
and visitors.”</p>
<p>In recent conversations with a VOA reporter traveling across
Tashkent, Ferghana, Bukhara, Samarkand and Surkhandarya, most Uzbeks
expressed enthusiasm about U.S. President Donald Trump’s return to the
White House. They hoped his administration would foster stronger
connections with the people of Uzbekistan, not just its government.</p>
<p>From journalists and activists to entrepreneurs and educators, they
want Trump to fulfill his promises to end the wars in Ukraine and the
Middle East.</p>
<p>“We are a peaceful region, despite the continuous turmoil in
neighboring Afghanistan, but these conflicts deeply trouble us,” said
Zuhra Amonova, an English teacher in Bukhara.</p>
<p>Calls for new approach</p>
<p>As relations between Washington and Central Asian nations have
evolved, there have been some calls by American experts for creating a
new diplomatic approach, shifting the U.S. government away from grouping
the countries with South Asian nations and instead aligning them more
with the Caucasus.</p>
<p>Veteran bureaucrats who have worked with these regions at the State
Department and the Pentagon told VOA that Washington’s view of this part
of the world has increasingly been seen through a Russian lens since the
U.S. exit from Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Ikboljon Qoraboyev, a professor at Maqsut Narikbayev University in
Astana, Kazakhstan, says the Central Asia-Caucasus proposal reflects the
region’s crucial role between China and Russia and the growing
significance of the Middle Corridor, a transit route across the Caspian
Sea that carries goods westward to European markets.</p>
<p>“Central Asian policymakers may welcome the change, as their previous
alignment with South Asia felt misaligned with their identity,”
Qoraboyev told VOA. “But U.S. policymakers must recognize each country’s
distinct interests, rather than relying solely on regional
frameworks.”</p>
<p>Like many experts VOA spoke to, he points out that Central Asian
governments are eager for closer ties with the U.S., seeking investment,
political support, development aid and expanded educational and
technological exchanges.</p>
<p>These are among the key factors in the policy recommendations by Eric
Rudenshiold, a former official in the White House, Congress and USAID
and now a senior fellow at the Caspian Policy Center.</p>
<p>“Successful U.S. engagement in the Trans-Caspian region will preserve
the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Caucasus and Central
Asia,” Rudenshiold said at a forum in Washington ahead of the
inauguration.</p>
<p>He emphasized that such an approach would benefit the U.S. while
creating opportunities in energy development, trade and
connectivity.</p>
<p>Rudenshiold believes that promoting American values in this way could
spur economic and political reforms in the region and shape democratic
institutions.</p>
<p>“The Trans-Caspian region is becoming a vital geopolitical and
economic crossroads, important to U.S. interests as it counters Russia’s
restrictions on the region’s gas, oil and uranium supplies and China’s
efforts to control next-generation energy,” he wrote in a strategic
brief.</p>
<p>Washington needs security agreements and closer partnerships in the
region, Rudenshiold argued, “due to shared concerns over renewed
terrorist threats and its geostrategic location bordering Russia, China,
Afghanistan and Iran.”</p>
<p>Leaders encourage Trump visit</p>
<p>In congratulatory messages to Trump, regional leaders have invited
him to visit. No U.S. president has ever toured Central Asia and the
Caucasus.</p>
<p>In a letter to Trump, Uzbekistan President Shavkat Mirziyoyev wrote
that his country “deeply values and appreciates the U.S. policy of
consistently supporting the independence, sovereignty and territorial
integrity of our nation.”</p>
<p>He credited Trump’s first term for renewing the strategic
partnership, adding: “We are committed to further developing our
long-term cooperation within bilateral and multilateral frameworks.”</p>
<p>The Trump administration has yet to outline its priorities in Central
Asia and the Caucasus. Rudenshiold and his center are pressing to
appoint a special representative for these regions.</p>
<p>Javlon Vakhabov, Uzbekistan’s former ambassador to the U.S. and
Canada who now heads the International Institute for Central Asia in
Tashkent, also advocates for deeper political dialogue.</p>
<p>“In an era of global uncertainty, Central Asia seeks to collectively
champion its interests on the international stage and coordinate efforts
to address shared challenges,” Vakhabov told VOA. “A high-level U.S.
visit to Uzbekistan would underscore the region’s importance.”</p>
<p>Vakhabov sees great potential in the Middle Corridor, where secondary
routes via Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan could strengthen supply chains
and diversify transportation lines.</p>
<p>He highlights the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan railway, “which
will reduce delivery times from 35 days to just three and cut shipping
costs by two-thirds.”</p>
<p>Vakhabov agrees with Rudenshiold that U.S. support for such
initiatives would enhance regional stability and attract more American
businesses. Touting Uzbekistan’s natural resources, he underlines that
collaboration on essential minerals and rare earth elements could help
the U.S. strengthen “defense, manufacturing and technological
competitiveness.”</p>
<p>Some yearn to learn</p>
<p>The U.S. has a long history of cooperation with Central Asian
countries on counterterrorism and border security. Vakhabov recommends
expanding that cooperation “since they serve common interests.”</p>
<p>The Human Rights Watch 2025 annual report describes Central Asia as a
region where autocratic regimes systematically violate freedoms, reforms
are stalled or superficial, and security forces hold significant power,
undermining the rule of law.</p>
<p>Uzbeks interviewed by VOA this winter expressed mixed views on the
U.S. role in promoting justice and freedom, but most admired its
democratic system.</p>
<p>“We need to grasp how democracy works in practice,” said Dilrabo
Zaripova, a small-business owner in Samarkand. “From what we saw in this
U.S. presidential election, it requires a strong will and commitment. I
don’t think we’re there yet. But having close ties with America would
help us learn from its resilience and complex experience.”</p>

provides immediate fire information to Los Angeles residents</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA — From his home in northern California, Nick
Russell, a former farm manager, is monitoring the Los Angeles-area
fires.</p>
<p>He knows that about 600 kilometers south, people in Los Angeles are
relying on his team’s live neighborhood-by-neighborhood updates on fire
outbreaks, smoke direction, surface wind predictions and evacuation
routes.</p>
<p>Russell is vice president of operations at Watch Duty, a free app
that tracks fires and other natural disasters. It relies on a variety of
data sources such as cameras and sensors throughout the state,
government agencies, first responders, a core of volunteers, and its own
team of reporters.</p>
<p>An emergency at his house, for example, would be “much different”
from one at his neighbor’s house .4 kilometers away, Russell said. “That
is true for communities everywhere, and that’s where technology really
comes in.”</p>
<p>Watch Duty’s delivery of detailed localized information is one reason
for its success with its 7 million users, many of whom downloaded the
app in recent weeks.</p>
<p>It acts as a virtual emergency operations center, culling and
verifying data points.</p>
<p>Watch Duty’s success points to the promise that technologies such as
artificial intelligence and sensors will give residents and first
responders the real-time information they need to survive and fight
natural disasters.</p>
<p>Google and other firms have invested in technology to track fires.
Several startup firms are also looking for ways to use AI, sensors and
other technologies in natural disasters.</p>
<p>Utility firms work with Gridware, a company that places AI-enhanced
sensors on power lines to detect a tree branch touching the line or any
other vibrations that could indicate a problem.</p>
<p>Among Watch Duty’s technology partners is ALERTCalifornia, run by the
University of San Diego, which has a network of more than 1,000
AI-enhanced cameras throughout the state looking for smoke. The cameras
often detect fires before people call emergency lines, Russell said.</p>
<p>Together with ALERTCalifornia’s information, Russell said, “we have
become the eyes and ears” of fires.</p>
<p>Another Watch Duty partner is N-5 Sensors, a Maryland-based firm. Its
sensors, which are placed in the ground, detect smoke, heat and other
signs of fire.</p>
<p>“They’re like a nose, if you will, so they detect smoke anomalies and
different chemical patterns in the air,” Russell said.</p>
<p>Watch Duty is available in 22 states, mostly in the western U.S., and
plans to expand to all states.</p>
<p>While fire has been its focus, Watch Duty also plans to track other
natural disasters such as tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes and
tsunamis, Russell said.</p>
<p>“Fire is not in the name,” he said. “We want to be that one-stop shop
where people can go in those times of duress, to have a source that
makes it clear and concise what’s happening.”</p>

id="trump-says-us-government-is-behind-california-during-visit-to-fire-stricken-state">Trump
says US government is behind California during visit to fire-stricken
state</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump said the federal government is standing
behind California 100% in the aftermath of devastating wildfires and
said during a visit to the state on Friday that he would come back as
much as needed.</p>
<p>“The first lady and I are in California to express a great love for
the people of California,” Trump told a gathering of local leaders at a
fire station in Los Angeles’ Pacific Palisades neighborhood.</p>
<p>The neighborhood was one of the worst hit by the recent fires, with
rows of homes left in ashes. Trump participated in a walking tour of the
area earlier in the day and also surveyed recovery efforts from a
helicopter as firefighters in the Los Angeles area continued to confront
multiple blazes amid high winds and dry conditions.</p>
<p>“I don’t think you can realize how rough it is, how devastating it
is, until you see it,” Trump said after the tour.</p>
<p>The Palisades Fire is about 77% contained and has burned through
nearly 9,500 hectares of land, according to the California Department of
Forestry and Fire Protection.</p>
<p>Trump has criticized California leaders for water policies that he
says have exacerbated the recent wildfires. He said before traveling to
California that he would “take a look at a fire that could have been put
out if they let the water flow, but they didn’t let the water flow.”</p>
<p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has rejected the president’s
assertion, and other state legislators have said the fierce wildfires
placed extreme demand on a municipal system not designed to battle such
blazes.</p>
<p>Newsom greeted Trump as he arrived on the tarmac in Los Angeles on
Friday. The two were cordial and shook hands.</p>
<p>“I have all the expectations we’re going to be able to work
together,” Newsom said.</p>
<p>Trump responded: “We’re going to get it fixed.”</p>
<p>During the gathering with community leaders, Trump said that Los
Angeles residents who lost homes should be allowed back onto their
properties immediately, challenging Mayor Karen Bass to speed up the
cleanup process.</p>
<p>“People are willing to get a dumpster and do it themselves and clean
it up. There is not that much left, it is all incinerated,” Trump
said.</p>
<p>Bass said, “the most important thing is for people to be safe,” but
promised residents should be able to return home within the week.</p>
<p>Trump promised that federal permits to rebuild would be granted
promptly and urged local officials to do the same.</p>
<p>Before visiting California, Trump first visited North Carolina, where
he was briefed on monthslong recovery efforts of the damage caused by
Hurricane Helene.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters at Asheville Regional Airport, Trump said FEMA
“has been a very big disappointment” and said he is considering “getting
rid” of the agency.</p>
<p>FEMA is the Federal Emergency Management Agency that has been
responding to disasters in both California and North Carolina.</p>
<p>“It’s very bureaucratic. And it’s very slow,” Trump said of the
agency.</p>
<p>Trump continued to express dissatisfaction with FEMA while in
California, calling it a “big disappointment.”</p>
<p>Trump, a Republican, has broached using federal disaster assistance
as a bargaining chip during unrelated legislative negotiations over
government borrowing, or as leverage to push California to alter its
water policies.</p>
<p>“Playing politics with people’s livelihoods is unacceptable and a
slap in the face to the southern California wildfire victims and to our
brave first responders,” Representative Young Kim, a Republican from
Orange County, south of Los Angeles, said in a recent statement.</p>
<p>Trump has also suggested putting more responsibility on individual
states to respond to disasters.</p>
<p>“I’d rather see the states take care of their own problems,” he said
in a Wednesday interview with Fox News. “FEMA is getting in the way of
everything.”</p>
<p>Michael A. Coen Jr., who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the
Biden administration, said Trump has been “misinformed” about the
agency, and he took exception to what he characterized as Trump’s
inclination to play politics with disaster relief.</p>
<p>Ahead of Trump’s visit to southern California, firefighters continued
to fight multiple fires in the Los Angeles region.</p>
<p>The second-largest fire, known as the Eaton Fire, is now 95%
contained after burning through more than 5,600 hectares of land,
according to Cal Fire.</p>
<p>The Hughes Fire in the mountains northwest of Los Angeles near
Castaic Lake started Wednesday, prompting evacuation orders for more
than 50,000 people. Health advisories for smoke and windblown dust and
ash have been issued for surrounding areas.</p>
<p>“Smoke and ash can harm everyone, even those who are healthy,”
Dr. Muntu Davis, Los Angeles County’s health officer, said in a
statement.</p>
<p>Firefighters received help fighting the Hughes Fire overnight with
aerial water drops from helicopters. The fire is now 56% contained and
has burned more than 4,200 hectares of land, according to the Cal
Fire.</p>
<p>The Laguna Fire in Ventura County initially prompted evacuation
orders for California State University Channel Islands and University
Glen, but the orders were downgraded to warnings Thursday afternoon.</p>
<p>That fire is 70% contained after charring nearly 40 hectares of land,
according to Cal Fire.</p>
<p>The U.S. Storm Prediction Center said high winds, low humidity and
dry conditions continued to cause “elevated” fire weather conditions on
Friday.</p>
<p>There is a chance for some relief in the coming days. The National
Weather Service said rain is expected in the area beginning
Saturday.</p>
<p>Forecasters expect up to a centimeter of rain across much of the Los
Angeles area, while localized thunderstorms could bring even more rain
in limited locations. The potential for those storms has prompted
concerns about the possibility of mudslides, with debris flowing down
hilly areas that have been scorched by several weeks of wildfires.</p>
<p>The fires that broke out in southern California on Jan. 7 have killed
at least 28 people and destroyed an estimated 16,000 buildings. The
death toll is expected to climb as emergency workers comb through the
ashes.</p>

Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.</p>

id="russian-deepfake-videos-target-ukrainian-refugees-including-teen">Russian
deepfake videos target Ukrainian refugees, including teen</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New online videos recently investigated by VOA’s Russian and
Ukrainian services show how artificial intelligence is likely being used
to try to create provocative deepfakes that target Ukrainian
refugees.</p>
<p>In one example, a video appears to be a TV news report about a
teenage Ukrainian refugee and her experience studying at a private
school in the United States.</p>
<p>But the video then flips to footage of crowded school corridors and
packets of crack cocaine, while a voiceover that sounds like the girl
calls American public schools dangerous and invokes offensive
stereotypes about African Americans.</p>
<p>“I realize it’s quite expensive [at private school],” she says. “But
it wouldn’t be fair if my family was made to pay for my safety. Let
Americans do it.”</p>
<p>Those statements are total fabrications. Only the first section —
footage of the teenager — is real.</p>
<p>The offensive voiceover was likely created using artificial
intelligence to realistically copy her voice, resulting in something
known as a deepfake.</p>
<p>And it appears to be part of the online Russian information operation
called Matryoshka — named for the Russian nesting doll — that is now
targeting Ukrainian refugees.</p>
<p>VOA found that the campaign pushed two deepfake videos that aimed to
make Ukrainian refugees look greedy and ungrateful, while also spreading
deepfakes that appeared to show authoritative Western journalists
claiming that Ukraine — and not Russia — was the country spreading
falsehoods.</p>
<p>The videos reflect the most recent strategy among Russia’s online
disinformation campaign, according to Antibot4Navalny, an X account that
researches Russian information operations and has been widely cited by
leading Western news outlets.</p>
<p>Russia’s willingness to target refugees, including a teenager, shows
just how far the Kremlin, which regularly denies having a role in
disinformation, is prepared to go in attempting to undermine Western
support for Ukraine.</p>
<p>Targeting the victims</p>
<p>A second video targeting Ukrainian refugees begins with real footage
from a news report in which a Ukrainian woman expresses gratitude for
clothing donations and support that Denmark has provided to
refugees.</p>
<p>The video then switches to generic footage and a probable deepfake as
the woman’s voice begins to complain that Ukrainian refugees are forced
to live in small apartments and wear used clothing.</p>
<p>VOA is not sharing either video to protect the identities of the
refugees depicted in the deepfakes, but both used stolen footage from
reputable international media outlets.</p>
<p>That technique — altering the individual’s statements while
replicating their voice — is new for Matryoshka, Antibot4Navalny told
VOA.</p>
<p>“In the last few weeks, almost all the clips have been built
according to this scheme,” the research group wrote.</p>
<p>But experts say the underlying strategy of spoofing real media
reports and targeting refugees is nothing new.</p>
<p>After Russia’s deadly April 2022 missile strike on Ukraine’s
Kramatorsk railway station, for example, the Kremlin created a phony BBC
news report blaming Ukrainians for the strike, according to Roman
Osadchuk, a resident fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic
Research Lab.</p>
<p>During that same period, he noted, Russia also spread disinformation
in Moldova aimed at turning the local population against Ukrainian
refugees.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, refugees are a very popular target for Russian
disinformation campaigns, not only for attacks on the host community …
but also in Ukraine,” Osadchuk told VOA.</p>
<p>When such disinformation operations are geared toward a Ukrainian
audience, he added, the goal is often to create a clash between those
who left Ukraine and those who stayed behind.</p>
<p>Deepfakes of journalists, however, appear designed to influence
public opinion in a different way. One video that purports to contain
audio of Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins, for example, claims that
Ukraine’s incursion into Russia’s Kursk region is just a bluff.</p>
<p>“The whole world is watching Ukraine’s death spasms,” Higgins appears
to say. “There’s nothing further to discuss.”</p>
<p>In another video, Shayan Sardarizadeh, a senior journalist at BBC
Verify, appears to say that “Ukraine creates fakes so that fact-checking
organizations blame Russia,” something he then describes as part of a
“global hoax.”</p>
<p>In fact, both videos appear to be deepfakes created according to the
same formula as the ones targeting refugees.</p>
<p>Higgins tells VOA that the entirety of the audio impersonation of his
own voice appears to be a deepfake. He suggests the goal of the video
was to engage factcheckers and get them to accidentally boost its
viewership.</p>
<p>“I think it’s more about boosting their stats so [the disinformation
actors] can keep milking the Russian state for money to keep doing it,”
he told VOA by email.</p>
<p>Sardarizadeh did not respond to a request for comment in time for
publication.</p>
<p>Fake video, real harm</p>
<p>The rapid expansion of AI over the past few years has drawn increased
attention to the problem of deepfake videos and AI images, particularly
when these technologies are used to create nonconsensual, sexually
explicit imagery.</p>
<p>Researchers have estimated that over 90% of deepfakes online are
sexually explicit. They have been used both against ordinary women and
girls and celebrities.</p>
<p>Deepfakes also have been used to target politicians and candidates
for public office. It remains unclear, however, whether they have
actually influenced public opinion or election outcomes.</p>
<p>Researchers from Microsoft’s Theat Analysis Center have found that
“fully synthetic” videos of world leaders are often not convincing and
are easily debunked. But they also concluded that deepfake audio is
often more effective.</p>
<p>The four videos pushed by Matryoshka — which primarily uses deepfake
audio — show that the danger of deepfakes isn’t restricted to explicit
images or impersonations of politicians. And if your image is available
online, there isn’t much you can do to fully protect yourself.</p>
<p>Today, there’s always a risk in “sharing any information publicly,
including your voice, appearance or pictures,” Osadchuk said.</p>
<p>The damage to individuals can be serious.</p>
<p>Belle Torek, an attorney who specializes in tech policy and civil
rights, said that people whose likenesses are used without consent often
experience feelings of violation, humiliation, helplessness and
fear.</p>
<p>“They tend to report feeling that their trust has been violated.
Knowing that their image is being manipulated to spread lies or hate can
exacerbate existing trauma,” she said. “And in this case here, I think
that those effects are going to be amplified for these [refugee]
communities, who are already enduring displacement and violence.”</p>
<p>How effective are deepfakes?</p>
<p>While it is not difficult to understand the potential harm of
deepfakes, it is more challenging to assess their broader reach and
impact.</p>
<p>An X post featuring phony videos of refugees received over 55,000
views. That represents significant spread, according to Olga Tokariuk, a
senior analyst at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue.</p>
<p>“It is not yet viral content, but it is no longer marginal content,”
she said.</p>
<p>Antibot4Navalny, on the other hand, believes that Russian
disinformation actors are largely amplifying the X posts using other
controlled accounts and very few real people are seeing them.</p>
<p>But even if large numbers of real people did view the deepfakes, that
doesn’t necessarily mean the videos achieved the Kremlin’s goals.</p>
<p>“It is always difficult … to prove with 100% correlation the impact
of these disinformation campaigns on politics,” Tokariuk said.</p>
<p>Mariia Ulianovska contributed to this report.</p>

Senate approves Hegseth as defense secretary by 51-50 vote</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The U.S. Senate late Friday night approved Pete Hegseth, President
Donald Trump’s nominee for defense secretary, on a mostly party-line,
51-50 vote.</p>
<p>Vice President JD Vance broke the 50-50 tie in the 100-member Senate,
casting the deciding vote. It is only the second time in U.S. history
that a vice president, who is president of the Senate, had to break a
tie for a nominee.</p>
<p>The vote followed days of Senate debate over Hegseth’s fitness for
the top civilian role in the U.S. military, managing the nation’s armed
forces.</p>
<p>In his confirmation hearing earlier this month, Hegseth told
lawmakers he would bring back accountability to the nation’s
military.</p>
<p>He received support from Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman
Roger Wicker, who said, “Pete Hegseth has the determination and the
tools to achieve real change. He will inject a new warrior ethos into
the Pentagon, a spirit that can cascade from the top down.”</p>
<p>But Hegseth faced criticism from Senate Democrats over his statements
about women and transgender people serving in the military, as well as
allegations of sexual assault, drunkenness and financial mismanagement
of two nonprofits serving U.S. veterans that he led.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, senators received an affidavit from Danielle
Hegseth, Hegseth’s former sister-in-law, alleging he was abusive toward
his second ex-wife, Samantha Hegseth. She did not describe the abuse and
said she did not witness it. In a statement to NBC News, which first
reported the story, Samantha Hegseth said, “There was no physical abuse
in my marriage.”</p>
<p>Senator Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee,
said Thursday he was not satisfied with Hegseth’s answers to his
questions about reports that the Trump administration would implement a
board to screen senior military officers for their fitness to lead.</p>
<p>“We’ve seen it happen in other places around the world, where
militaries are undermined and subjected by political leaders that have a
particular political point of view and passion, and they become
essentially not an army but an extension of the political aspirations of
the Great Leader. We can’t see that here in America,” Reed said.</p>
<p>Hegseth, a former television host at conservative Fox News, also
served as an officer in the Army National Guard in Iraq, Afghanistan and
Guantanamo Bay and is the author of several books.</p>
<p>“I don’t have a similar biography to defense secretaries of the last
30 years,” Hegseth told senators in his opening statement, “But as
President Trump also told me, we’ve repeatedly placed people atop the
Pentagon with the supposed right of credentials, whether they are
retired generals, academics or defense contractor executives. And where
has it gotten us?”</p>
<p>Republican senators praised Hegseth for his fresh perspective.</p>
<p>“Mr. Hegseth will bring energy and fresh ideas to shake up the
bureaucracy. He will focus relentlessly on the war fighter and the
military’s core missions, deterring wars and winning the ones we must
fight,” Wicker said during the confirmation hearings.</p>
<p>Hegseth said his priorities would focus on the threat posed by China
and defense of the United States, while reorienting the United States
away from entanglements in the Middle East. He also pledged to restore
morale and end diversity initiatives that he sees as harmful to
establishing a merit-based military.</p>
<p>Asked how he sees his role, Hegseth replied, “Getting anything that
doesn’t contribute to our democracy out of how decisions are made inside
the Pentagon. What gender you are. What race you are. Your views on
climate change. Your conscience and your faith should have no bearing on
whether you get promoted or whether you’re selected to go to West Point
or where you go to school. Only thing that should matter is, ‘How
capable are you at your job? How excellent are you at your job?’”</p>
<p>Hegseth will be the first defense secretary to have served as a
junior officer on the front lines, and the first secretary from the
generation that fought in post-9/11 wars.</p>
<p>Senate Democrats said Hegseth’s experience running two nonprofits
benefiting military veterans, with fewer than 100 employees, was not
sufficient experience to run the massive Defense Department.</p>
<p>“We’re hiring you to be the CEO of one of the most complex, largest
organizations in the world. We’re the board of directors here. I don’t
know of any corporate board of directors that would hire a CEO, that
said, you know, ‘I supervised 100 people before,’” Democratic Senator
Gary Peters said.</p>
<p>The Defense Department oversees more than 3 million service members
and a budget of $857 billion.</p>
<p>Hegseth also faced allegations of sexual assault and public
drunkenness during his time at Fox News. Reed said the FBI background
investigation into Hegseth was insufficient.</p>
<p>“You lack the character and composure and competence to hold the
positions of defense,” Reed said, noting he has voted for all nine
previous nominees for defense secretary, including nominees during
Trump’s first term.</p>
<p>All Cabinet nominees undergo a background check and an ethics
review.</p>
<p>Hegseth faced allegations of financial mismanagement of the two
nonprofits where he served as executive director — Vets for Freedom and
Concerned Vets for America. After a 2009 audit of Vets for Freedom,
Hegseth admitted the organization was half a million dollars in debt,
and he was demoted.</p>
<p>During his time at Concerned Vets for America, Hegseth faced
whistleblower allegations of personal misconduct and financial
mismanagement.</p>
<p>Hegseth said the allegations were part of a coordinated smear
campaign by left-wing media and largely came from anonymous sources.</p>
<p>“We undertook this responsibility with obligation to the troops to do
right by them, for our war fighters. And what became very evident to us
from the beginning, there was a coordinated smear campaign orchestrated
in the media against us that was clear from moment one. And that it
wasn’t about me. Most of it was about President Donald Trump, who’s had
to endure the very same thing for much longer amounts of time, and he
endured it — to his credit — in incredibly strong ways,” Hegseth said
during his confirmation.</p>
<p>Hegseth has also faced criticism for past remarks about diversity in
the U.S. military.</p>
<p>Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren said Hegseth had done “a very big
about-face in a short period of time” because of his nomination by Trump
to be defense secretary.</p>
<p>Warren said last week, “For 12 years, you were quite open about your
views — and your views were consistently the same: Women are inferior
soldiers, sailors, marines, airmen and guardians. Then on Nov. 9, 2024,
just 32 days after your last public comments saying that women
absolutely should not be in combat, you declare that ‘Some of our
greatest warriors are women.’”</p>
<p>Five women who served in combat wrote letters of support of Hegseth’s
nomination.</p>
<p>Hegseth pledged that women would have access to ground combat roles
during his tenure as secretary.</p>
<p>“Given the standards remain high, and we’ll have a review to ensure
standards have not been eroded in any one of these cases,” he said.</p>

visits fire-stricken California, vows ‘to get it fixed’</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump toured parts of California damaged by
wildfire as firefighters in the Los Angeles area continued to confront
multiple blazes amid high winds and dry conditions.  </p>
<p>Trump surveyed recovery efforts from a helicopter on Friday,
including flying over the Pacific Palisades neighborhood where a fire
left rows of homes in ashes. </p>
<p>The Palisades Fire is about 77% contained and has burned through
nearly 9,500 hectares of land, according to the California Department of
Forestry and Fire Protection.   </p>
<p>Trump has criticized California leaders for water policies that he
says have exacerbated the recent wildfires. He said before traveling to
California that he would “take a look at a fire that could have been put
out if they let the water flow, but they didn’t let the water flow.”
 </p>
<p> </p>
<p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has rejected the president’s
assertion, and other state legislators have blamed the fierce wildfires
for placing extreme demand on a municipal system not designed to battle
such blazes. </p>
<p>Newsom greeted Trump as he arrived on the tarmac in Los Angeles on
Friday. The two were cordial and shook hands.  </p>
<p>“I have all the expectations we’re going to be able to work
together,” Newsom said. </p>
<p>Trump responded: “We’re going to get it fixed.” </p>
<p>Trump calls FEMA ‘big disappointment’</p>
<p>Before visiting California, Trump first visited North Carolina, where
he was briefed on monthslong recovery efforts for the damage caused by
Hurricane Helene.  </p>
<p>Speaking to reporters at Asheville Regional Airport, Trump said FEMA
“has been a very big disappointment” and said he is considering “getting
rid” of the agency. </p>
<p>FEMA is the Federal Emergency Management Agency that has been
responding to disasters in both California and North Carolina. </p>
<p>“It’s very bureaucratic. And it’s very slow. Other than that, we’re
very happy with them,” Trump said of the agency. </p>
<p>Trump, a Republican, has broached using federal disaster assistance
as a bargaining chip during unrelated legislative negotiations over
government borrowing, or as leverage to push California to alter its
water policies.  </p>
<p>“Playing politics with people’s livelihoods is unacceptable and a
slap in the face to the Southern California wildfire victims and to our
brave first responders,” Representative Young Kim, a Republican from
Orange County, south of Los Angeles, said in a recent statement. </p>
<p>Trump has also suggested putting more responsibility on individual
states to respond to disasters.</p>
<p>“I’d rather see the states take care of their own problems,” he said
in a Wednesday interview with Fox News. “FEMA is getting in the way of
everything.” </p>
<p>Michael A. Coen, Jr., who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the
Biden administration, said Trump has been “misinformed” about the
agency, and he took exception with what he characterized as Trump’s
inclination to play politics with disaster relief.  </p>
<p>50,000 told to evacuate</p>
<p>Ahead of Trump’s visit to southern California, firefighters continued
to fight multiple fires in the Los Angeles region.  </p>
<p>The second-largest fire, known as the Eaton Fire, is now 95%
contained after burning through more than 5,600 hectares of land,
according to Cal Fire.  </p>
<p>The Hughes Fire in the mountains northwest of Los Angeles near
Castaic Lake started Wednesday, prompting evacuation orders for more
than 50,000 people. Health advisories for smoke and windblown dust and
ash have been issued for surrounding areas.   </p>
<p>“Smoke and ash can harm everyone, even those who are healthy,”
Dr. Muntu Davis, Los Angeles County’s health officer, said in a
statement.   </p>
<p>Firefighters received help fighting the Hughes Fire overnight with
aerial water drops from helicopters. The fire is now 56% contained and
has burned more than 4,200 hectares of land, according to Cal Fire.
 </p>
<p>The Laguna Fire in Ventura County initially prompted evacuation
orders for California State University Channel Islands and University
Glen, but the orders were downgraded to warnings Thursday afternoon.  
 </p>
<p>That fire is 70% contained after charring nearly 40 hectares of land,
according to Cal Fire.  </p>
<p>The U.S. Storm Prediction Center said high winds, low humidity and
dry conditions continued to cause “elevated” fire weather conditions on
Friday. </p>
<p>Saturday forecast includes rain   </p>
<p>There is a chance for some relief in the coming days. The National
Weather Service said rain is expected in the area beginning Saturday.
  </p>
<p>Forecasters expect up to a centimeter of rain across much of the Los
Angeles area, while localized thunderstorms could bring even more rain
in limited locations. The potential for those storms has prompted
concerns about the possibility of mudslides, with debris flowing down
hilly areas that have been scorched by several weeks of wildfires.    
 </p>
<p>The fires that broke out in Southern California on January 7 have
killed at least 28 people and destroyed an estimated 16,000 buildings.
The death toll is expected to climb as emergency workers comb through
the ashes.     </p>

Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.</p>

id="afghan-refugees-in-pakistan-worry-as-us-suspends-resettlement-program">Afghan
refugees in Pakistan worry as US suspends resettlement program</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Sultani family was nearing the final stages of their
case to resettle in the U.S., though their plan was disrupted after
President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 20 suspending
the relocation of refugees to the U.S.</p>
<p>“My family and I couldn’t sleep at night” since the executive order
was signed, said 50-year-old Ahmad Zahir Sultani, who fled to Pakistan
alongside his wife and four children a few months after the Taliban
seized power in Afghanistan in August 2021.</p>
<p>“We are very worried … as we face an uncertain future,” said Sultani,
who worked with U.S.-run projects in Afghanistan before the U.S. pulled
out of the country in 2021.</p>
<p>Just hours after his swearing-in as the 47th President of the U.S.,
Trump signed the executive order suspending the U.S. Refugee Admissions
Program beginning Jan. 27. The Sultani family was identified as a
Priority 1 case for resettlement under that program.</p>
<p>“This order suspends the USRAP until such time as the further entry
into the United States of refugees aligned with the interest of the
United States,” stated the order.</p>
<p>The order calls on the secretary of the Homeland Security Department,
in consultation with the secretary of state, to report to the president
within 90 days if the program “would be in the interests of the United
States.”</p>
<p>The order added that every 90 days, a report would be submitted to
the president until he “determine[s] that resumption of the USRAP is in
the interests of the United States.”</p>
<p>Sultani and other Afghan refugees who have been waiting in Pakistan
for resettlement in the U.S. told VOA that staying in Pakistan would be
“very difficult” for them as the crackdown on Afghan refugees continues
in Islamabad, where the Sultanis currently reside.</p>
<p>“We are facing harassment and arrests by the police [in Pakistan].
And we can’t go back to Afghanistan as we fled because of the threats
there,” Sultani said.</p>
<p>According to Pakistan’s Foreign Office in July, among more than
44,000 Afghans living in Pakistan to be relocated to third countries,
about 25,000 Afghan refugees are waiting to be resettled in the U.S.</p>
<p>Fahimi Zahid, an Afghan activist living in Islamabad, told VOA that
after the suspension of their relocation program to the U.S., Afghan
refugees in Pakistan are “very concerned” about their future in
Pakistan.</p>
<p>“In the past, refugees had a hope that the U.S. was in talks with
Pakistan to ensure they wouldn’t face any harassment,” she said, “but
after the executive order, it is for sure that Afghans would face
further harassment and deportation.”</p>
<p>According to the U.S. State Department, more than 180,000 Afghans
were relocated in the U.S. from August 2021, after the Taliban seized
power in Afghanistan, to December 2024.</p>
<p>Thousands of Afghans who helped the U.S. during its two-decade war in
Afghanistan are still waiting to be relocated to the U.S.</p>
<p>Shawn VanDiver, the president of AfghanEvac, a California-based
coalition of organizations helping the U.S., told VOA that until the
USRAP resumes, “there won’t be any travel. Refugees won’t be flying here
or anywhere else.”</p>
<p>Watch related video by Sarah Zaman:</p>
<p>U.S. media reported Wednesday that the flights of Afghan refugees who
were supposed to be relocated to the U.S. were canceled only days before
the order would go into effect.</p>
<p>VanDiver said the order mainly would affect Afghan refugees with
Priority 1 and Priority 2 cases.</p>
<p>He said he and others at AfghanEvec are trying to have President
Trump issue “an exemption for Afghans.”</p>
<p>“People that pass security and waiting medical and all that, we got
to make sure they get here,” he added.</p>
<p>VanDiver noted that somewhere between 150,000 to 200,000 Afghans have
resettlement cases.</p>
<p>Sultani said that he and other Afghan refugees who waited for years
to be relocated to the U.S. are now facing an uncertain future.</p>
<p>“Going back to Afghanistan is no option for us, and here [in
Pakistan] we face many problems,” he said.</p>

<h2
id="state-department-freezes-new-funding-for-nearly-all-us-aid-programs-worldwide">State
Department freezes new funding for nearly all US aid programs
worldwide</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The State Department ordered a sweeping freeze Friday on
new funding for almost all U.S. foreign assistance, making exceptions
for emergency food programs and military aid to Israel and Egypt.</p>
<p>The order threatened a quick halt to many of the billions of dollars
in U.S.-funded projects globally to support health, education,
development, job training, anti-corruption, security assistance and
other efforts.</p>
<p>The U.S. provides more foreign aid globally than any other country,
budgeting about $60 billion in 2023, or about 1% of the U.S. budget.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s order, delivered in a cable sent to
U.S. embassies worldwide, specifically exempted emergency food programs,
such as those helping to feed millions in a widening famine in warring
Sudan.</p>
<p>The cable spells out the execution of the aid-freezing executive
order President Donald Trump signed on Monday.</p>
<p>But Friday’s order especially disappointed humanitarian officials by
not including specific exemptions for lifesaving health programs, such
as clinics and immunization programs.</p>
<p>A globally acclaimed anti-HIV program, the President’s Emergency Plan
for AIDS Relief, was among those apparently included in the spending
freeze, slated to last at least three months. Known as PEPFAR, the
program is credited with saving 25 million lives, including those of 5.5
million children, since it was started by Republican President George W.
Bush.</p>
<p>Some aid projects began receiving their first stop-work orders under
the freeze Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>Some leading aid organizations also were interpreting the directive
as an immediate stop-work order for U.S.-funded aid work globally, a
former senior U.S. Agency for International Development official said.
Many would likely cease operations immediately so as not to incur more
costs, the official said. The official was not authorized to speak
publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>Suspending funding “could have life or death consequences” for
children and families around the world, said Abby Maxman, head of Oxfam
America.</p>
<p>“By suspending foreign development assistance, the Trump
administration is threatening the lives and futures of communities in
crisis, and abandoning the United States’ long-held bipartisan approach
to foreign assistance which supports people based on need, regardless of
politics,” Maxman said in a statement.</p>
<p>At the United Nations, deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said: “These are
bilateral decisions but nonetheless we expect those nations who have the
capability to generously fund development assistance.”</p>
<p>While Rubio’s order exempted military assistance to allies Israel and
Egypt from the freeze, there was no indication of a similar waiver to
allow vital U.S. military assistance to Ukraine through.</p>
<p>The Biden administration pushed military aid to Ukraine out the door
before leaving office because of doubts about whether Trump would
continue it. But there is still about $3.85 billion in congressionally
authorized funding for any future arms shipments to Ukraine, and it is
now up to Trump to decide whether to spend it.</p>
<p>The sweeping freeze begins enforcement of a pledge from Trump and
other Republicans to crack down on U.S. aid programs. Florida Republican
Representative Brian Mast, the new chairman of the House Foreign Affairs
Committee, promised this week that Republicans would question “every
dollar and every diplomat” in the State Department’s budget to ensure it
met their standards for strict necessity.</p>
<p>The freeze is necessary to ensure that “appropriations are not
duplicated, are effective and are consistent with President Trump’s
foreign policy,” the global cable stated.</p>
<p>Within the next month, standards for a review of all foreign
assistance are expected to be set to ensure that it is “aligned with
President Trump’s foreign policy agenda,” the cable said. And within
three months, the government-wide review is expected to be completed
with a subsequent report to be produced for Rubio to make
recommendations to the president.</p>

id="pandas-are-back-in-washington-delighting-national-zoo-visitors">Pandas
are back in Washington, delighting National Zoo visitors</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Giant pandas have returned to the National Zoo in
Washington, drawing joyful crowds.</p>
<p>Two pandas, Bao Li and Qing Bao, made their public debut Friday in
front of hundreds of excited fans, the first pandas at the zoo in more
than a year.</p>
<p>Lisa Barham came all the way from Cleveland, Ohio, with her son to
see them.</p>
<p>“It’s just fantastic to be able to experience this as a family,” she
told VOA’s Mandarin Service.</p>
<p>Bao Li is the son of Bao Bao, a giant panda who was born at the
National Zoo in 2013 and was returned to China.</p>
<p>“I brought my little boy to see Bao Bao’s little boy,” Barham
said.</p>
<p>The pair of pandas, who are both 3 years old, rolled in Washington’s
newly fallen snow and munched on bamboo. Crowds lined up for hours
before the zoo opened at 8 a.m. to catch a glimpse of the bears.</p>
<p>The pandas arrived from China in October but have been in quarantine
while their enclosure was renovated.</p>
<p>National Zoo director Brandie Smith told VOA that the pandas are “a
symbol of happiness and joy.”</p>
<p>“The pandas to me are such a success story … a story of panda
friendship between our cultures,” she said.</p>
<p>Because of conservation efforts, the giant panda is no longer on the
endangered species list. However, it is still listed as
“vulnerable.”</p>
<p>Smith said that at the start of the zoo’s program with pandas, which
began in the 1970s, the focus was on producing more pandas to create an
“insurance population” for the planet.</p>
<p>“We accomplished that, and now the focus is really on habitat,” she
said.</p>
<p>About 1,864 giant pandas live in their native habitat in Asia while
another 600 pandas live in zoos and breeding centers around the world,
according to the National Zoo’s website.</p>
<p>Any cubs born to the new pandas are returned to China to join that

<h2 id="trump-in-north-carolina-lets-overhaul-fema">Trump in North
Carolina: Let’s Overhaul FEMA</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-24, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTg1NDgwOC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0MDQ1NTcyMH0.7Cd2r0oL_D4rPrJkSDBYEkRUW4i4UeLySXaYNNA7624/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
On his fifth day back in office, President Trump is making the rounds to
recent disaster zones —- North Carolina, which is recovering from
Hurricane Helene, and later Los Angeles, where fires are still burning.
In the immediate aftermath of both catastrophes, Trump was quick to
blame Democrats for their response. Touching down in North Carolina
earlier today, he sounded the same tune as he proposed overhauling or
even eliminating the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is
responsible for disaster preparation and recovery nationwide.
</p>
<p>
On the tarmac, Trump told the press that his administration was “looking
at the whole concept of FEMA,” saying he would rather states be solely
responsible for disaster recovery. Later, at a hurricane recovery
briefing, Trump said that he planned to sign an executive order that
would “begin the process of fundamentally reforming and overhauling FEMA
— or maybe getting rid of FEMA.” Trump dodged questions on details of
the order or a timeline for implementation.
</p>
<p>
While speaking to a group of North Carolina families at a separate
event, Trump told them, “Unfortunately, our government failed you, but
it wasn’t the Trump government. It was a government run by Biden.” False
claims about the hurricane response, stoked by Trump during the final
month of his campaign against Kamala Harris, led FEMA to put up a
“<a href="https://www.fema.gov/fact-sheet/myth-and-fact-north-carolina-helene-response" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>myth
and fact</u></a>” response page on its website to debunk swirling
rumors.
</p>
<p>
It is true, however, that earlier this month, FEMA informed thousands of
displaced North Carolina residents that their vouchers for temporary
<a href="https://www.newsweek.com/fema-kicking-hurricane-survivors-housing-administrator-responds-2013660" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>housing
were about to expire</u></a> for one of three reasons: their homes had
been deemed “habitable,” the residents had not approved a FEMA
inspection, or the agency couldn’t get in contact with them. Speaking to
the families, Trump said this was unjustifiable given that “your
government provided shelter and housing for illegal aliens from all over
the world.” He claimed he would “surge housing solutions” to the state
that went beyond FEMA’s temporary measures, but did not provide more
details as to how.
</p>
<p>
After arriving in Los Angeles, where large swaths of the city have been
devastated by still-active wildfires, President Trump met with Governor
Gavin Newsom on the tarmac, striking a conciliatory tone as he said he
wanted to “work together” to help L.A. recover. This disaster also
prompted
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/los-angeles-fires-misinformation" target="_self"><u>a
flurry of misinformation</u></a> when fire hydrants in the city
temporarily ran dry. While the city’s water infrastructure simply wasn’t
equipped to put out numerous simultaneous historic blazes, Trump put the
blame squarely on Newsom and his previous opposition to a policy that
would have redirected water from a river delta in Northern California to
farms in the Central Valley and cities in Southern California,
endangering a fish species called the Delta smelt.
</p>
<p>
Experts say this has nothing to do with the fires or the ability to put
them out, as all water storage tanks were full and the blazes were due
to a combination of drought and extreme winds. Yet Trump has continued
to hold up the protection of the smelt fish as all that’s wrong with
California’s fire response, even making it a feature of his
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/putting-people-over-fish-stopping-radical-environmentalism-to-provide-water-to-southern-california/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>recent
executive order</u></a> “Putting People Over Fish: Stopping Radical
Environmentalism To Provide Water Solutions To Southern California.”
</p>
<p>
After a tour of the Pacific Palisades neighborhood and a photoshoot with
L.A. firefighters, Trump met with city and state leaders and pledged to
declare a national emergency that would allow him to waive all federal
permits for rebuilding. “The federal permit can take 10 years. We’re not
going to do that. We don’t want to take 10 days,” Trump said to
applause. “I’d ask that the local permitting process be the same.”
</p>
<p>
L.A. Mayor Karen Bass agreed that she wanted to expedite the process but
reiterated that before rebuilding efforts could begin in earnest, all
the fire debris needed to be cleared. That’s an
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/los-angeles-fires-rebuilding" target="_blank">arduous
process</a> that the Army Corp of Engineers estimated could take 18
months to complete. While Bass vowed to speed up this timeline, Trump
claimed that “the people are willing to clean out their own debris.”
</p>
<p>
Trump also repeated his promise to “open up the pumps and valves in the
North,” though again, there’s no evidence that more piped water would
have done anything to prevent these fires. “We want to get that water
pouring down as quickly as possible. Let hundreds of millions of gallons
of water flow down into Southern California, and that’ll be a big
benefit to you.”
</p>
<p>
And he didn’t miss an opportunity to mention the smelt once more,
telling the assembled leaders “it’s in numerous other areas. So it
doesn’t have to be protected. The people of California have to be
protected.”
</p>

cities get creative clearing snow, ice after rare winter storm</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Days after a winter storm dropped ice and record-breaking snow,
cleanup efforts were underway Thursday in several major Southern U.S.
cities such as New Orleans, Louisiana, where crews were removing snow
the same way they remove trash, drink cups and plastic beads after Mardi
Gras celebrations. </p>
<p>Temperatures were gradually rising across the U.S. South, bringing
hopes that remaining snow and ice would melt away. </p>
<p>“We have to be honest with ourselves — we’re from Louisiana, we know
crawfish, we know football, but we don’t really know snow and ice and
that’s okay,” said Louisiana Department of Transportation and
Development spokesperson Daniel Gitlin. “It’s going to go away and we’re
better off letting Mother Nature do what she needs to do right
now.” </p>
<p>Up to 320 kilometers (200 miles) of interstate highways were expected
to remain closed until Friday due to treacherous patches of black ice,
Gitlin said. Louisiana has nearly run out of its salt supply after
treating roads, he added. </p>
<p>In New Orleans, a private waste management firm has been contracted
to repurpose equipment that’s typically used to clean up Mardi Gras
beads and cups to clear snow from the streets. </p>
<p>IV Waste President Sidney Torres said his company has deployed a
15,000-liter (4,000-gallon) “flusher” truck to spray water on the ground
to soften the ice for removal in the historic and festive French
Quarter. The truck normally sprays lemon-scented fragrance “to get rid
of that funky liquor, urine, puke smell from the night before,” Torres
said. “We’re finding new solutions and better techniques to dealing with
this.” </p>
<p>Arkansas sent Louisiana snowplows, dump trucks, salt spreaders and
other equipment, Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry said. </p>
<p>Snow likely breaks records</p>
<p>The snowfall likely broke several records across the region,
including in Florida where a preliminary report of 25 centimeters (10
inches) in one town would set a record for the state, if confirmed. </p>
<p>Snow totals reached 8 centimeters (3 inches) this week in Savannah,
Georgia, the most that the state’s oldest city has recorded since
December 1989. </p>
<p>The snow was lighter in metro Atlanta, Georgia, where the southern
suburbs saw more snow and ice than areas north of the city. In
Covington, southeast of Atlanta, Jesse Gentes used a flame thrower to
de-ice the roads in his subdivision. In better weather, he typically
uses the flame thrower for brush removal, he told television station
WSB-TV. </p>
<p>Light freezing rain was forecast Thursday in the port city of
Brunswick and surrounding Glynn County, where local officials had
imposed an overnight curfew because of icy roads and frigid
temperatures. Officials opened three warming stations where people could
escape the biting chill, and nearly 4,000 residents of the county were
still without power Thursday afternoon, according to
PowerOutage.us. </p>
<p>South Carolina reported at least one death in the storm. A
71-year-old man died from a medical condition while shoveling snow
Thursday morning in Berkeley County, Coroner Darnell Hartwell said.
About 8-10 centimeters (3-4 inches) of snow fell in the area, according
to the National Weather Service. </p>
<p>The snow and ice had staying power and left a mess on the roads in
coastal South Carolina. In Charleston, South Carolina, ice that melted
and then refroze overnight closed the James Island Connector, a bridge
that links the city to its western suburbs. Police said on social media
that “while crews are working hard, it is unlikely to reopen soon.” </p>
<p>Schools and county offices remained closed as officials in most areas
south and east of the state capital, Columbia, asked people to stay home
at least one more day. </p>
<p>It was a similar story in North Carolina, where slick roads remained
a danger to drivers after snow melted and then refroze overnight.
Schools were also affected, including in Cumberland County where
Fayetteville is located, where the school system announced that students
would have an “asynchronous” learning day allowing students to complete
assignments at home. Several other school districts operated on a
two-hour delay. </p>
<p>Some school systems in central and south Alabama remained closed
Thursday because of concerns about the remaining ice on roads or the
possibility of frozen pipes in schools. In coastal Baldwin County,
sections of Interstate 65 and Interstate 10 were shut down because of
ice. </p>
<p>Across the South, airports were gradually recovering from the weather
interruption. Nationwide, about 600 flights scheduled to fly into or out
of U.S. airports had been canceled by midday Thursday — a marked
improvement over previous days when the storm was at its peak, according
to the flight tracking service FlightAware.com. </p>
<p>Parts of river freeze</p>
<p>Meanwhile in the northeast, places like New York were still dealing
with bitter cold temperatures despite moments when the sun peeked
through the clouds.  </p>
<p>Parts of New York’s Hudson River turned to ice Thursday during recent
cold weather in the city. The frozen surface split into blocks of ice
with the city’s majestic skyline looming on the distant bank of the
river. </p>
<p>The National Weather Service has issued a warning for wind chills in
eastern parts of the U.S. In New York, the city is dealing with
temperatures below zero degrees Celsius (around 20 degrees Fahrenheit)
which are expected to last through the weekend. </p>

Pauses Permitting for All Renewables on Federal Lands</h2>

<p>
The Department of Interior has
<a href="https://www.doi.gov/document-library/secretary-order/3415-temporary-suspension-delegated-authority" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
<u>issued an order</u></a> suspending the ability of its staff, except a
few senior officials, to permit new renewables projects on public land.
The document, dated January 20, suspended the authority of “Department
Bureaus and Offices” over a wide range of regular actions, including
issuing “any onshore or offshore renewable energy authorization.”
</p>
<p>
The suspension lasts for 60 days and can only be overridden by “a
confirmed or Acting official” in a number of senior roles in the
Department, including the secretary.
</p>
<p>
Donald Trump’s pick for secretary of the interior, former North Dakota
Governor Doug Burgum, cleared a Senate Environment and Natural Resources
Committee vote earlier this week, and will likely be confirmed by the
full Senate soon. The suspension was signed by
<a href="https://www.boem.gov/about-boem/boem-leadership/deputy-director/walter-cruickshank-phd" target="_blank"><u>Walter
Cruickshank</u></a>, the acting secretary, a longtime public servant in
the department.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>“This step will restrict energy development, which will
harm consumers and fail to meet growing electricity demand,” Jason Ryan,
a spokesperson for American Clean Power, the clean energy trade group,
said in an email. “We need an ‘all-of-the-above’ energy strategy, not
just a ‘some-of-the-above’ approach.”
</p>
<p>
The order is yet another early action taken by the Trump administration
indicating its
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-energy-executive-orders" target="_self"><u>favoritism
towards oil and gas</u></a> (and some non-carbon-emitting energy sources
such as geothermal and nuclear) and its hostility or indifference
towards renewables.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>An earlier executive order suspending permitting of new
offshore wind projects was
<a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/spotlight/trump-executive-order-wind" target="_self"><u>written
broadly enough</u></a> that industry officials told Heatmap it could
affect more than half of all new wind projects, including those on- and
offshore. Trump also halted a specific wind project, Idaho’s Lava Ridge,
that was
<a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2025/01/22/president-trumps-executive-order-halts-lava-ridge-wind-project-in-idaho/" target="_blank"><u>unpopular
with Republican elected officials</u></a> in the state. There are
currently 12 renewable energy projects planned on federal lands in
various stages of the permitting process, according to the
Permitting.gov databased, including two that have been canceled.

renewables projects on public lands,</u></a> totaling some 33 gigawatts
of capacity.
</p>
<p>
The order suspended a number of other Department of Interior activities,
including new hiring, land sales, and altering land management plans.
The order noted that the suspension of new permits for renewables
projects “does not limit existing operations under valid leases.”
</p>
<p>
The order is part and parcel of a broad freeze on renewable energy and
climate change programs, including

</p>

Former President Joe Biden issued a similar order on his first day in
office,
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-billings-a3a37acf2fce55449b704b01badc1f67" target="_blank">
<u>halting new permits for oil and gas projects</u></a> on public lands
for 60 days except with permission by senior officials, followed up with

killed off a specific energy project that many of his supporters opposed
on his first day in office, the Keystone XL pipeline.<br/>

court says US mom can be extradited in children’s killings</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LONDON — A London judge on Friday rejected a U.S. mother’s challenge
to be extradited to Colorado to face murder charges in the deaths of two
of her young children.</p>
<p>Judge John Zani said in Westminster Magistrates Court that it would
now be up to the British Home Secretary to order Kimberlee Singler
returned to the United States.</p>
<p>Singler, 36, is accused of two counts of first-degree murder in the
December 2023 shooting and stabbings of her 9-year-old daughter and
7-year-old son, and one count of attempted murder in the knife slashing
of her 11-year-old daughter. She also faces three counts of child abuse
and one count of assault.</p>
<p>Singler’s attorney had argued that sending her back to the U.S. would
violate European human rights law, in part, because she faces a sentence
of life in prison without parole in Colorado if convicted of
first-degree murder. Such a sentence would be inhumane because it offers
no prospect for release even if she is rehabilitated, attorney Edward
Fitzgerald said.</p>
<p>Fitzgerald said that despite an option for a Colorado governor to
commute her sentence at some point, it was “political suicide” to do
so.</p>
<p>Experts for the defense had originally said that a life sentence had
never been commuted in Colorado. But prosecutors later found that
Governor John Hickenlooper in 2018 commuted life sentences of five men
convicted of murder.</p>
<p>The defense countered that three of those sentences were not life
without parole and two were for men who committed their crime between
the ages of 18 and 21, which is sometimes considered a mitigating factor
at sentencing because of their relative youth.</p>
<p>“This defendant, Kimberlee Singler, has no real prospect of release
no matter what progress she makes” behind bars, Fitzgerald said.</p>
<p>Prosecutor Joel Smith said the judge only had to consider if there is
a mechanism that could allow Singler to be freed someday.</p>
<p>“Prospect of release — that is not your concern,” Smith told the
judge at a hearing in December.</p>
<p>Zani said in his ruling that there was an option in Colorado to
release an inmate serving a life sentence.</p>
<p>“I am satisfied that the defendant has failed to vault the hurdle
necessary in order to succeed in the challenges raised,” the judge
said.</p>
<p>Fitzgerald said he planned to appeal.</p>
<p>Singler has denied that she harmed her children. She told police that
her ex-husband had either carried out the killings or hired a
hitman.</p>
<p>Singler had superficial knife wounds and was initially treated as a
victim.</p>
<p>But that changed when her surviving daughter, who initially said she
had been attacked by an intruder, told police her mother tried to kill
her.</p>
<p>After her daughter changed her story, police sought to arrest Singler
on Dec. 26, but she had fled. She was found four days later in London’s
posh Chelsea neighborhood and arrested.</p>
<p>The girl told police that her mother gave the children milk with a
powdery substance to drink and told them to close their eyes as she
guided them into a sibling’s bedroom, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>Singler cut her neck and, as the girl begged her to stop, she slashed
her again. The girl said her mother had a gun.</p>
<p>“The defendant told her that God was telling her to do it and that
the children’s father would take them away,” Smith said at a previous
hearing.</p>
<p>Police found Aden Wentz, 7, and Elianna “Ellie” Wentz, 9, dead when
they entered the Colorado Springs apartment on Dec. 19. They had been
shot and stabbed.</p>
<p>Although Singler blamed her husband, authorities said he had a solid
alibi backed up by GPS records that showed he had been driving a truck
at the time of the killings.</p>

Two weeks after two of California’s most destructive wildfires on
<a href="https://34c031f8-c9fd-4018-8c5a-4159cdff6b0d-cdn-endpoint.azureedge.net/-/media/calfire-website/our-impact/fire-statistics/top-20-destructive-ca-wildfires.pdf?rev=069f3eac37da49bdaaaa049fa0de8cde&hash=827E4DB8822D32DB84C4B1F965D83046" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>record</u></a>
sparked on the same day in Los Angeles, tens of thousands of displaced
residents are taking the first steps of their recovery processes.
Officials have started lifting evacuation orders for both the
<a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2025/1/7/eaton-fire" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Eaton</u></a>
and
<a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2025/1/7/palisades-fire" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Palisades</u></a>
fires, allowing families to return to their properties for the first
time. For those whose houses survived, that means suiting up in personal
protective equipment and cautiously wiping away ash, throwing out
spoiled food, and assessing the damage from smoke, heat, and flames. For
those whose houses were lost, it means sorting through wreckage to see
what, if anything, can be salvaged.
</p>
<p>
This moment marks the first of many milestones fire survivors will
encounter in the weeks, months, and years to come. Urban wildfires
launch complicated timelines that involve a braiding of bureaucratic
checklists and personal choices. The volume of decisions can be daunting
in both volume and scope, stretched over the course of months, if not
years.
</p>
<p>
It took about 15 months for the first house to be rebuilt and occupied
following the
<a href="https://www.mauirecovers.org/news/lahaina-family-moving-into-first-rebuilt-home-in-lahaina-disaster-area" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>2023
Lahaina Fire</u></a> in Maui. Five years after the 2018 Camp Fire —
which is currently the only California wildfire more devastating than
the Eaton Fire — the hard-hit town of Paradise had still rebuilt only
about
<a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/11/08/1209471739/a-california-town-wiped-off-the-map-by-wildfire-is-still-recovering-five-years-o#:~:text=Five%20years%20later%20only%20a,in%20federal%20and%20state%20aid." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
third</u></a> of its lost structures. The recovery from the 2021
Marshall Fire in Colorado has notably
<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269401034_Rebuilding_and_new_housing_development_after_wildfire" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>outpaced</u></a>
many others. There, about
<a href="https://boulderreportinglab.org/2024/12/29/marshall-fire-recovery-3-years-on-two-thirds-of-homes-rebuilt-far-above-the-national-average-but-hundreds-still-struggle-with-underinsurance-and-waning-support/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>two-thirds</u></a>
of the lost homes were rebuilt within the first three years, but that
still leaves hundreds wading through their next steps with waning
support.
</p>
<p>
Jennifer Gray Thompson, founder and CEO of the nonprofit group After the
Fire U.S.A., told me it’s important to understand that every disaster —
and therefore every recovery — is different. Her organization helps
communities through this process, building on the knowledge of survivors
from previous wildfires, and she said each community tends to make some
adaptations and improvements. But the experiences of other
wildfire-impacted areas can offer L.A.’s fire survivors an idea of the
steps and potential concerns they can expect to encounter next.
</p>
<p>
Take the re-entry process. As Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass explained in
a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW-_tlT5NZs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>press
conference</u></a> on Monday, “Re-entry is based on safety.” And just
because the fire has passed doesn’t mean the danger has: “Firefighters
are still at work to prevent fires, to prevent flare-ups; there are
hazardous materials being dealt with; utility repairs are underway; or
there is other emergency work that makes it unsafe to be in the area,”
Bass said. So far, officials doing this work have identified more than
16,000
<a href="https://34c031f8-c9fd-4018-8c5a-4159cdff6b0d-cdn-endpoint.azureedge.net/-/media/calfire-website/our-impact/fire-statistics/top-20-destructive-ca-wildfires.pdf?rev=78bb711dd18242e0b765a23a6a3f4765&hash=33A7D8A1FC64712FCE59F1CE9207C224" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>destroyed</u></a>
structures and 28 fatalities from the two fires.
</p>
<p>
This waiting phase can be particularly challenging for those who
evacuated, said Thompson. The adrenaline that helped impacted families
make it through the fire might be waning under the weight of time, and
the road ahead can start to feel overwhelming as various government
agencies come to town and task forces pop up. It can take weeks for some
evacuees to get the go-ahead to return home, particularly if they choose
to wait for hazardous materials to get cleared, as L.A. County
Department of Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer has
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ae-mY4xSCKU" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>recommended</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
That brings us to the two phases of cleanup: removing hazardous
materials and disposing of debris. Since the L.A. wildfires are a
federally declared disaster, the Federal Emergency Management Agency is
able to direct resources toward these tasks, with more than 500
Environmental Protection Agency employees currently surveying the burned
areas to identify and collect of things like propane tanks, batteries,
and other contaminants, which are packaged up and then disposed of
off-site. This reduces the risks for residents returning to their
properties, removing some obvious sources of chemicals and toxins like
heavy metals and asbestos.
</p>
<p>
Once residents do make it back, they’ll have the opportunity to both
survey and sift through their homes and choose whether they would like
the government to remove the remains or contract out to a private
company. This part of the process traditionally takes months, if not
longer, depending on the scope of the damage, volume of the debris, and
cooperation of the residents. For perspective, one year after the
Lahaina Fire, debris removal was still ongoing and had racked up a more
than
<a href="https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Swenson-Testimony.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$1
billion</u></a> bill. The Army Corps of Engineers, which
<a href="https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Swenson-Testimony.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>led</u></a>
this effort in Lahaina, will take charge again in L.A., with the L.A.
Department of Public Works overseeing both phases from the local level.
</p>
<p>
While these are the larger hurdles residents will need to cross on the
property level in order to rebuild, there will also be a number of
government and utility-led efforts to make their homes habitable. That
includes addressing issues with electric and water systems, from downed
lines to blocked or broken sewers. These efforts are now underway in
both burned areas, with utility trucks becoming a common sight across
the county.
</p>
<p>
All of this can clear the way for construction to begin on the impacted
properties, which comes with its own set of timelines, costs, and
players. California Governor
<a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/01/12/governor-newsom-signs-executive-order-to-help-los-angeles-rebuild-faster-and-stronger/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Gavin
Newsom</u></a> and Los Angeles Mayor
<a href="https://mayor.lacity.gov/news/mayor-bass-issues-sweeping-executive-order-clear-way-angelenos-rebuild-their-homes-fast" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Karen
Bass</u></a> have issued executive orders to reduce some of the
bureaucracy that often accompanies permitting and building in L.A. These
include suspending environmental reviews, expediting permitting, and
clearing the way to “rebuild homes as they were.”
</p>
<p>
Still, residents will have to get those permits approved and source
labor and materials for the project in what’s become a crowded national
market. Other disasters, such as last year’s one-two punch of Hurricanes
Helene and Milton, have created unusually high competition, with one
development firm executive telling the
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/the-battle-for-recovery-supplies-is-on-in-a-disaster-strewn-america-46d191bf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>Wall
Street Journal</em></em></u></a> he foresees a “Hunger Games-style
competition for materials and labor.”
</p>
<p>
Fire survivors will also need to find the funds to put towards these
projects, whether that’s through government aid, insurance, fundraising
campaigns, or digging deep into their own pockets. Robert Fenton, Jr., a
FEMA regional administrator,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ae-mY4xSCKU" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said</u></a>
that as of Wednesday, the agency has registered nearly 100,000 fire
survivors to receive aid so far, including money to cover immediate
needs for evacuees and to provide personal property and displacement
assistance. But many previous disaster survivors will
<a href="https://www.vermontpublic.org/local-news/2024-07-01/vermont-flood-july-2023-fema-costs-administrative-fees-assistance-buyouts-hurdles" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>attest</u></a>
that navigating FEMA’s system can be challenging, particularly if you
are also insured. Insurance claims need to be filed first — so that FEMA
avoids duplicating aid homeowners are already receiving — another
process that is known to be both slow and time-consuming,
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-01-22/la-fires-what-to-know-about-filing-a-wildfire-insurance-claim?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTczNzU4OTY4MSwiZXhwIjoxNzM4MTk0NDgxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTUUhMOTBUMEFGQjQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCOTdGRUFDNjI5N0Y0ODdGODFCOTE5MTRCOUE0QTVENiJ9.mfyFFsW3E3xJA00zrEw8BQlRXkmnw0oDtKI9YJSTqdw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>requiring</u></a>
a litany of paperwork and receipts.
</p>
<p>
And all of this is assuming no additional disasters occur during the
recovery process. Wildfire-scorched areas are vulnerable to debris flows
when it rains, as it is forecasted to do for the first time in months
this weekend. Speaking at a county press conference Wednesday, Mark
Pestrella, director of the L.A. Department of Public Works, said his
office will be conducting 24/7 storm patrols, making assessments of
burned properties and deploying sediment traps and sandbags in at-risk
areas. Other weather conditions, like extreme heat or high winds, can
also suspend operations and further delay residents from returning.
</p>
<p>
Overall, Thompson referred to rebuilding after a wildfire as “the
biggest group project most people will have ever done in their lives.”
Individuals, government officials, non-profits, attorneys, insurers,
utilities, developers, and all sorts of laborers will be a part of the
process, each bringing their own perspectives, needs, and costs to the
table — some complementary and some competing.
</p>
<p>
Already, there is tension between the desire to rebuild for displaced
residents and the desire to make the impacted area
<a href="https://heatmap.news/ideas/la-fires-natural-gas" target="_self"><u>more
resilient</u></a> in the face of future hazards. In her
<a href="https://susanpcrawford.substack.com/p/why-pushing-to-rebuild-quickly-in?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=1843450&post_id=154973749&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=true&token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoyNzA5MjcsInBvc3RfaWQiOjE1NDk3Mzc0OSwiaWF0IjoxNzM3MDYwOTE1LCJleHAiOjE3Mzk2NTI5MTUsImlzcyI6InB1Yi0xODQzNDUwIiwic3ViIjoicG9zdC1yZWFjdGlvbiJ9.iuQJi7_XujdiKFoFBgVsPQTOhtuAhWPjGeGmI_RFB5k&r=5t1r&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>newsletter</u></a>,
Susan Crawford, a climate adaptation expert and senior fellow at the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, described the urge to
quickly restore what was lost in L.A. as “both understandable and
unthinkable” given the county’s ongoing housing crisis and wildfire
risk. (Crawford is also a
<a href="https://heatmap.news/u/susancrawford" target="_self"><u>Heatmap
contributor</u></a>.)
</p>
<p>
“It’s obvious we should be taking a step back and thinking how and where
we are rethinking how and where we live, but it may be too much to
contemplate in this thickly populated area,” Crawford told me.
</p>
<p>
For those in L.A. trying to find their own way forward through these
agencies and agendas, Thompson recommends turning to others who
understand what you’re going through, like your neighbors. Establishing
ways to share information, support, and organize can help ensure your
community’s concerns and priorities are taken into account in the
recovery process.
</p>
<p>
“You can actually do this,” she said. “It feels right now like it can’t,
and it’s going to take time and it comes in stages. But you’re not
alone.”

<li>Rain finally forecast for parched Southern California
</h3>
<p>
Rain is expected in Southern California this weekend, which will bring
relief to a region terrorized by wildfires. But there is some concern
that the moisture could trigger flooding and mudslides in the areas most
affected by the blazes. More than 50,000 acres have been charred in
recent weeks, and burnt land struggles to absorb water, increasing the
risk of flooding.

to</a> <em><em>The New York Times</em></em>, areas surrounding the Eaton
Fire in Pasadena could be most at-risk in the case of a downpour. The
good news is that heavy rain isn’t currently in the forecast. The bad
news is that dry weather is likely to return next week. “The Santa Ana
wind season can persist through February and March, and one weekend of

President Trump has big plans to boost (already record-high) oil

agents raid New Jersey worksite as Trump escalates undocumented
immigration crackdown</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. immigration agents rounded up undocumented migrants
as well as American citizens in a raid of a Newark, New Jersey, worksite
on Thursday that the city’s mayor said involved detaining a military
veteran and violations of the people’s rights.</p>
<p>The raid in New Jersey’s most populous city, hailed in the past by
Mayor Ras Baraka for its “sanctuary” policies protecting migrants,
follows President Donald Trump’s pledge to deport millions of immigrants
who are in the U.S. illegally.</p>
<p>Trump issued a raft of executive orders after taking office on Monday
that aim to clamp down on illegal immigration. He has taken steps to
punish officials who resist enforcement of his sweeping crackdown.</p>
<p>In a raid of a business establishment in Newark, outside New York
City, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents failed to produce
a warrant as they detained “undocumented residents as well as citizens,”
Baraka said in a statement.</p>
<p>“One of the detainees is a U.S. military veteran who suffered the
indignity of having the legitimacy of his military documentation
questioned,” Baraka said.</p>
<p>In a statement, an ICE spokesperson said that agents “may encounter
U.S. citizens while conducting field work and may request identification
to establish an individual’s identity as was the case during a targeted
enforcement operation at a worksite today in Newark.”</p>
<p>The spokesperson said that ICE was investigating the incident.</p>
<p>Baraka said the raid had violated the citizens’ rights under the U.S.
Constitution.</p>
<p>“Newark will not stand by idly while people are being unlawfully
terrorized,” he said.</p>
<p>Neither Baraka nor ICE identified the business raided by name.</p>
<p>White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said on X that the Trump
administration arrested 538 people Thursday, describing all of them as
“illegal immigrant criminals.” She said they included members of a
Venezuelan prison gang and people convicted of sex crimes.</p>
<p>Leavitt did not provide more details.</p>
<p>A range of studies by academics and think tanks have shown that
immigrants do not commit crime at a higher rate than native-born
Americans. Other studies find that immigrants in the U.S. illegally also
do not commit crimes at a higher rate.</p>
<p>Sanctuary cities</p>
<p>Baraka, the Newark mayor, is one of the first local officials in the
U.S. to issue a statement on a specific raid following the start of
Trump’s immigration crackdown.</p>
<p>In 2017, he signed an executive order cementing Newark’s sanctuary
status and was a vocal opponent of Trump’s immigration policies during
the president’s first term.</p>
<p>Of the estimated 11 million immigrants in the U.S. illegally or with
temporary status in 2022, about 44% lived in states with “sanctuary”
laws that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities.</p>
<p>That figure does not include those in sanctuary cities and counties
in places without a statewide law, such as New Mexico.</p>
<p>U.S. media outlets reported that federal law enforcement and ICE
agents had arrested nearly 500 undocumented migrants wanted for
outstanding crimes in sanctuary cities, including some from New York and
New Jersey. The reports cited ICE officials who said the arrests took
place Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>

Air Force looks to upgrade Cyprus airbase as humanitarian staging post
for the Middle East</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NICOSIA, CYPRUS — Experts from the U.S. Air Force are looking at ways
to upgrade Cyprus’ premier air base for use as a humanitarian staging
post in future operations in the Middle East, a Cypriot official told
The Associated Press on Thursday.</p>
<p>Cyprus, which is only 184 kilometers from the Lebanese capital,
Beirut, has acted as a transit point for the repatriation of foreign
nationals fleeing conflict in the Middle East and beyond on numerous
occasions in the past. It has also served as a transit point for
humanitarian aid to Gaza.</p>
<p>Experts from the 435th Contingency Response Group based out of
Ramstein, Germany, will spend the next few days at Andreas Papandreou
Air Force Base to assess the upgrade needed to accommodate a wide array
of U.S. air assets and other forces.</p>
<p>A key priority is to ensure air traffic safety in and around the
base, which abuts the island’s second-largest civilian airport, the
official said. The base’s location makes it easy to transfer evacuees
onto civilian aircraft at the adjacent airport for their trip home.</p>
<p>The official spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity
because he’s not authorized to speak publicly about the details of the
experts’ visit.</p>
<p>Air traffic safety would need to be enhanced through new high-tech
installations, including state-of-the-art radar, to ensure the
independent operation of civilian and military aircraft at safe
distances.</p>
<p>“The Americans are very specific on safety issues and want to make
some upgrades to further improve the base’s safety,” the official
said.</p>
<p>Other essential upgrades include expanding both the base itself and
the runway to accommodate more transport and fighter aircraft. Hardened
shelters to protect those air assets are also envisioned.</p>
<p>The Cyprus government agreed to the air base upgrade assessment
following the recent deployment of a U.S. Marine contingent at the base.
The Marines, who were equipped with V-22 Osprey tiltrotor military
transport and cargo aircraft, were on stand-by in the event of a swift
evacuation of US citizens from nearby Lebanon during Israel’s strikes
against Hezbollah targets late last year.</p>
<p>Deputy government spokesman Yannis Antoniou told the state
broadcaster Thursday that any use of the base by the forces of the U.S.
or other nations would require prior Cyprus government approval. He
insisted the air base would not act as a forward base for military
strike operations against targets in the region.</p>
<p>“We’ve shown interest in working with (US. Forces) because we
consider this to serve the vital interests of the Cyprus Republic,”
Antoniou said, adding that in their report, the USAF experts will offer
an estimate of the upgrade costs and which percentage of those the US
government would be willing to cover.</p>
<p>Bilateral relations between European Union member Cyprus and the
U.S., especially in terms of military cooperation, have grown
significantly over the last few years following a pledge by Cypriot
President Nikos Christodoulides to affirm the ethnically divided
country’s “clear Western orientation.”</p>
<p>A manifestation of those ties was last week’s directive by former
President Joe Biden that allows Cyprus to buy arms from the U.S.
government and get surplus American military equipment.</p>
<p>The Cypriot government noted the development as a tangible
acknowledgment of Cyprus’ reliability as a U.S. partner in the
region.</p>

id="italys-highest-court-upholds-slander-conviction-of-amanda-knox">Italy’s
highest court upholds slander conviction of Amanda Knox</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Italy’s highest court on Thursday upheld the slander conviction of
American defendant Amanda Knox in a case related to the sensationalized
2007 murder of her British roommate.  </p>
<p>Knox was convicted of slandering her former boss, Congolese bar owner
Patrick Lumumba, by falsely accusing him of murdering Meredith Kercher.
 </p>
<p>A 21-year-old exchange student, Kercher was found stabbed to death in
2007 in the Perugia apartment she shared with Knox.  </p>
<p>While being interrogated, Knox, who was 20 at the time, signed two
statements prepared by police regarding her accusation against Lumumba.
Knox later wrote a handwritten note questioning her false
accusation. </p>
<p>Last year, an appeals court in Florence handed Knox a three-year
sentence for wrongly accusing Lumumba.  </p>
<p>Knox, now 37 years old, had already served nearly four years during
the investigation, initial murder trial and first appeal. She was
convicted twice before Italy’s highest court finally exonerated her of
the crime in 2015. She is not at risk of any more jail time.  </p>
<p>Knox had appealed the slander conviction based on a European Court of
Human Rights ruling that said her rights had been violated by police
failure to provide a lawyer and adequate translator during a lengthy
night of questioning just days after Kercher was killed.  </p>
<p>With the appeal, Knox was aiming to clear her name in Rome’s Court of
Cassation in the last remaining legal case against her following a
nearly two-decades-long legal saga.  </p>
<p>But on Thursday, Judge Monica Boni confirmed the slander conviction.
 </p>
<p>Knox, who did not attend the court, maintained her innocence in a
post on X.  </p>
<p>“It’s a surreal day,” Knox said. “I’ve just been found guilty yet
again of a crime I didn’t commit.” </p>
<p>Knox’s lawyer, Carlo Dalla Vedova, said he was surprised by the
conviction. </p>
<p>“We cannot believe it. A totally unjust decision for Amanda and
unexpected in our eyes,” he said. “We are incredulous.” </p>
<p>But Lumumba said he was satisfied with the verdict.  </p>
<p>“Amanda was wrong. This verdict has to accompany her for the rest of
her life,” he told The Associated Press.  </p>
<p>Rudy Guede, originally from the Ivory Coast, was eventually found
guilty and sentenced to 16 years in prison for killing Kercher. He was
released in 2021 after serving most of his sentence. He denied killing
Kercher.  </p>
<p>Knox’s lengthy legal saga was fodder for tabloids around the world
and spawned books, movies and documentaries.  </p>
<p>Knox herself is currently producing a Hulu mini-series about her
wrongful conviction and fight to clear her name. Social activist Monica
Lewinsky is also producing the series.  </p>

Press.</p>

<h2 id="multiple-blazes-continue-in-southern-california">Multiple blazes
continue in southern California</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Firefighters in southern California continued to confront multiple
blazes on Thursday amid high winds and dry conditions.</p>
<p>The Hughes Fire in the mountains northwest of Los Angeles near
Castaic Lake broke out Wednesday, prompting authorities to issue
evacuation orders for more than 50,000 people. Health advisories for
smoke and windblown dust and ash have been issued for areas near the
Hughes Fire.</p>
<p>“Smoke and ash can harm everyone, even those who are healthy,”
Dr. Muntu Davis, L.A. County’s health officer, said in a statement.</p>
<p>The Laguna Fire in Ventura County resulted in evacuation orders for
California State University Channel Islands and University Glen, but the
orders were downgraded to warnings Thursday afternoon.</p>
<p>The evacuation warning for the Sepulveda Fire near Interstate 405
late Wednesday was lifted after firefighters stopped the fire’s progress
after it had burned through less than 1 square kilometer.</p>
<p>The U.S. Storm Prediction Center said Thursday the “very gusty”
offshore Santa Ana winds will continue in southern California with gusts
that could reach as high at 105 kph in some mountain ranges. The winds,
combined with Southern California’s “very low humidity and dry
antecedent conditions,” prompted the center to continue a Critical Risk
of Fire Weather alert for Thursday and an Elevated Fire Weather Outlook
for Friday.</p>
<p>Firefighters received help fighting the Hughes Fire with overnight
aerial water drops from helicopters. The fire, northwest of Los Angeles,
swelled to burn an area of more than 41 square kilometers near the Lake
Castaic recreation area.</p>
<p>Containment of the fire grew to 24%, from about 14% contained early
Thursday.</p>
<p>There is a chance for some relief in the coming days. The National
Weather Service said some rain is expected in the area beginning
Saturday.</p>
<p>Forecasters expect up to a centimeter of rain across much of the Los
Angeles area, while localized thunderstorms could bring even more rain
in limited locations. The potential for those storms has prompted
concerns about the possibility of mudslides, with debris flowing down
hilly areas that have been scorched by several weeks of wildfires.</p>
<p>In addition to the Hughes Fire, crews are still battling the
Palisades Fire on the western side of Los Angeles and the Eaton Fire in
the foothills to the north of the city. The Palisades fire, at 95 square
kilometers, is about 70% contained, while the Eaton, at 56 square
kilometers, is about 95% contained, according to file officials.</p>
<p>The fires that broke out in Southern California on Jan. 7 have killed
at least 28 people and destroyed an estimated 16,000 buildings. The
death toll is expected to climb as emergency workers comb through the
ashes.</p>
<p>California Governor Gavin Newsom announced Thursday that mortgage
relief will be available to the owners of property damaged or destroyed
in the fires.</p>
<p>Nearly 300 state-chartered banks, credit unions and mortgage lenders
and servicers have committed to the 90-day forbearance of mortgage
payments.</p>
<p>“We’re working closely with Governor Newsom’s office … to ensure
Southern Californians can focus on rebuilding their lives without the
added burden of financial worries,” Scott Simpson, president and CEO of
California &amp; Nevada Credit Union Leagues.</p>
<p>The forbearance, Newsom said, “helps provide survivors with the time
and relief to address their immediate needs, rather than worrying about
paying mortgage bills.”</p>
<p>Other relief will be available, the governor’s office said in a
statement, but did not delineate further.</p>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump, who has been critical of the response to
the fire, is expected to travel to Los Angeles on Friday.</p>

id="trump-orders-release-of-last-jfk-rfk-king-assassination-files">Trump
orders release of last JFK, RFK, King assassination files</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the declassification
Thursday of the last secret files on the assassination of the late U.S.
President John F. Kennedy, a case that still fuels conspiracy theories
more than 60 years after his death.</p>
<p>Trump signed an executive order that will also release documents on
the 1960s assassinations of JFK’s younger brother, Robert F. Kennedy,
and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.</p>
<p>“That’s a big one, huh? A lot of people have been waiting for this
for years, for decades,” Trump told reporters as he signed the order in
the Oval Office of the White House.</p>
<p>After signing the order, Trump passed the pen he used to an aide,
saying, “Give that to RFK Jr.,” JFK’s nephew and the current president’s
nominee to become secretary of the Department of Health and Human
Services.</p>
<p>The order Trump signed requires the “full and complete release” of
the JFK files, without redactions that he accepted back in 2017 when
releasing most of the documents.</p>
<p>“It is in the national interest to finally release all records
related to these assassinations without delay,” the order said.</p>
<p>Trump had previously promised to release the last of the files, most
recently at his inauguration on Monday.</p>
<p>The U.S. National Archives has released tens of thousands of records
in recent years related to the November 22, 1963, assassination of
President Kennedy but held thousands back, citing national security
concerns.</p>
<p>It said at the time of the latest large-scale release, in December
2022, that 97% of the Kennedy records — which total 5 million pages —
had now been made public.</p>
<p>The Warren Commission that investigated the shooting of the
charismatic 46-year-old president determined that it was carried out by
a former Marine sharpshooter, Lee Harvey Oswald, acting alone.</p>
<p>But that formal conclusion has done little to quell speculation that
a more sinister plot was behind Kennedy’s murder in Dallas, Texas, and
the slow release of the government files has added fuel to various
conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>A gesture to RFK Jr.</p>
<p>Trump’s move is partly a gesture to one of the most prominent backers
of those conspiracies — Robert F. Kennedy Jr. himself.</p>
<p>RFK Jr. said in 2023 there was “overwhelming evidence the CIA was
involved” in his uncle JFK’s murder and “very convincing” evidence the
agency was also behind the 1968 assassination of his own father, Robert
F. Kennedy.</p>
<p>The former attorney general was killed while campaigning for the
Democratic nomination for president. Sirhan Sirhan, a Palestinian-born
Jordanian, was convicted of his murder.</p>
<p>Thousands of John Kennedy assassination-related documents from the
National Archives were released during Trump’s first term in office, but
he also held some back on national security grounds.</p>
<p>Then-President Joe Biden said at the time of the December 2022
documents release that a “limited” number of files would continue to be
held back at the request of unspecified “agencies.”</p>
<p>Previous requests to withhold documents have come from the CIA and
FBI.</p>
<p>Kennedy scholars have said the documents still held by the archives
are unlikely to contain any bombshell revelations or put to rest the
rampant conspiracy theories about the assassination of the 35th U.S.
president.</p>
<p>Oswald, who had at one point defected to the Soviet Union, was shot
to death two days after killing Kennedy by a nightclub owner, Jack Ruby,
as he was being transferred from the city jail.</p>
<p>Hundreds of books and movies such as the 1991 Oliver Stone film “JFK”
have fueled the conspiracy industry, pointing the finger at Cold War
rivals Russia or Cuba, the Mafia and even Kennedy’s vice president,
Lyndon Johnson.</p>
<p>King was assassinated in April 1968 in Memphis, Tennessee.</p>
<p>James Earl Ray was convicted of the murder and died in prison in
1998, but King’s children have expressed doubts in the past that Ray was
the assassin.</p>

<h2 id="will-trump-spark-a-mineral-gold-rush-in-greenland">Will Trump
spark a mineral ‘gold rush’ in Greenland?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NUUK, GREENLAND — The mineral wealth on the Arctic island of
Greenland is in the global spotlight after U.S. President Donald Trump
said he wants to take control of the territory from Denmark, prompting
alarm from European allies.</p>
<p>Trump’s words were echoed in a January 12 interview on “Fox News
Sunday” by Vice President JD Vance, who said, “There is a deal to be
made in Greenland,” and that the island has “a lot of great natural
resources.”</p>
<p>Until now, Greenland’s mining industry has struggled to turn a
profit, but could that be about to change?</p>
<p>‘Full of minerals’</p>
<p>Greenland currently has only one active commercial mine — White
Mountain —located north of the capital, Nuuk, and gets its stark,
monochrome color from anorthosite rock, which is rich in calcium
deposits and other minerals.</p>
<p>The mine’s operator, Lumina Sustainable Materials, ships the rock
from Greenland’s western coastline to Asia, Europe and North America,
where it is used to make a variety of products such as fiberglass,
paint, fillers, cement and polymers. Efforts are under way to exploit
aluminum deposits within the anorthosite.</p>
<p>“Greenland is a country full of minerals. We have, literally,
minerals available all over the place,” Bent Olsvig Jensen, Lumina’s
managing director in Greenland, told VOA in an interview.</p>
<p>Dozens of other mining companies from around the world are conducting
exploration and feasibility studies across Greenland, although White
Mountain remains the only commercial operation currently trading.</p>
<p>China competition</p>
<p>The minerals include plentiful rare earth elements such as lithium
and scandium, which are critical for devices such as batteries. Global
supply chains for those elements are currently dominated by China.</p>
<p>Trump has repeatedly said that U.S. control of Greenland is necessary
for “international security.” His comments caused a political storm in
Greenland and Denmark, but mining companies see an opportunity.</p>
<p>“His interest in Greenland can actually help the industry get access
to further investment, which is needed for the industry to develop in
Greenland,” Jensen said. “So, yes, I definitely welcome it. And I think
it’s important that both from the industry side but also from the
political side in Greenland that we position ourselves towards Trump and
the U.S.”</p>
<p>‘Not for sale’</p>
<p>Greenland’s government is largely autonomous, although Denmark is
responsible for the island’s security.</p>
<p>Naaja Nathanielsen, Greenland’s minister for resources, emphasized
the government’s long-held response to Trump’s interest: Open for
business, but not for sale.</p>
<p>“We do want American investments. We do want collaboration with the
U.S. State Department, and we’ve been trying to advocate for that for
some time,” she told VOA.</p>
<p>Greenland signed a deal with Trump during his first administration in
2019 to boost the mining industry.</p>
<p>“The U.S. funded our direct marketing towards investors all over the
world, and this agreement has just come to its end. So we’ve been trying
to … get engagement from the U.S. for some time now in order to renew
this deal,” Nathanielsen said.</p>
<p>Challenges</p>
<p>Despite widespread recognition of Greenland’s mineral wealth,
attracting investment in mining has been a long-term problem.</p>
<p>“For many years now, we have seen that there has been some hesitance
in the investor environment to engage in high-risk, long-term projects.
We only have one American-owned license at the moment. In comparison, we
have 23 from Canada, 23 from the U.K. and about 10 from Denmark. So,
it’s not an area where you see a lot of U.S. engagement as of now. Of
course we welcome it, and there’s plenty of opportunity,” Nathanielsen
said.</p>
<p>Greenland’s government is pushing for full independence from Denmark.
Supporters hope the island’s mineral wealth could one day provide the
economic foundation for full statehood. But there’s a long way to go,
said Ulrik Pram Gad, an analyst at the Danish Institute for
International Studies in Copenhagen.</p>
<p>“If you want minerals out of the ground and financing Greenlandic
self-sufficiency economically, then you will need to have the uptake in
the international processing going,” Gad told VOA.</p>
<p>“And then, probably you’ll have to think very closely about how to
make sure that these mining projects benefit people who live close to
them, rather than being a new version of imperialist extraction. Because
then, the Greenlanders might not want it in the end,” he explained.</p>
<p>The risk doesn’t always end in reward. Rubies and pink sapphires were
extracted at the Aappaluttoq mine until 2023, when its operator,
Greenland Ruby, went bankrupt, $71 million in debt. The company is
restructuring and seeking new investors, with a goal of restarting
operations.</p>
<p>Greenland’s 2.1 million square kilometers of land is icebound for
much of the year.</p>
<p>“Obviously, we are in the middle of the Arctic, so there are some
logistical challenges,” Jensen of Lumina said. “Not all of Greenland is
open all year round. However, that is something that we can plan our way
out of.”</p>
<p>Jensen added that investors must have patience to make a profit.</p>
<p>“It takes time to develop a project from the early-stage exploration
until you actually have a mine where you can extract and start selling.
And as we all say in mining, ‘Time is money.’”</p>

<h2
id="trump-signs-executive-orders-on-ai-cryptocurrency-and-issues-more-pardons">Trump
signs executive orders on AI, cryptocurrency and issues more
pardons</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an
executive order related to AI to “make America the world capital in
artificial intelligence,” his aide told reporters in the White House’s
Oval Office.</p>
<p>The order sets a 180-day deadline for an Artificial Intelligence
Action Plan to create a policy “to sustain and enhance America’s global
AI dominance in order to promote human flourishing, economic
competitiveness, and national security.”</p>
<p>Trump also told his AI adviser and national security assistant to
work to remove policies and regulations put in place by former President
Joe Biden.</p>
<p>Trump on Monday revoked a 2023 executive order signed by Biden that
sought to reduce the risks that artificial intelligence poses to
consumers, workers and national security.</p>
<p>Biden’s order required developers of AI systems that pose risks to
U.S. national security, the economy, public health or safety to share
the results of safety tests with the U.S. government, in line with the
Defense Production Act, before they were released to the public.</p>
<p>Trump also signed an executive order creating a cryptocurrency
working group tasked with proposing a new regulatory framework for
digital assets and exploring the creation of a cryptocurrency
stockpile.</p>
<p>The much-anticipated action also ordered that banking services for
crypto companies be protected, and banned the creation of central bank
digital currencies that could compete with existing
cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>The order sees Trump fulfill a campaign trail pledge to be a “crypto
president and promote the adoption of digital assets.”</p>
<p>That is in stark contrast to Biden’s regulators that, in a bid to
protect Americans from fraud and money laundering, cracked down on
crypto companies, suing exchanges Coinbase, Binance, Kraken and dozens
more in federal court, alleging they were flouting U.S. laws.</p>
<p>The working group will be made up of the Treasury secretary, attorney
general and chairs of the Securities and Exchange Commission and
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, along with other agency heads. The
group is tasked with developing a regulatory framework for digital
assets, including stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency typically pegged
to the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>The group is also set to “evaluate the potential creation and
maintenance of a national digital asset stockpile … potentially derived
from cryptocurrencies lawfully seized by the Federal Government through
its law enforcement efforts.”</p>
<p>In December, Trump named venture capitalist and former PayPal
executive David Sacks as the crypto and artificial intelligence czar. He
will chair the group, the order said.</p>
<p>Finally, Trump signed pardons for 23 anti-abortion protesters on
Thursday in the Oval Office of the White House.</p>
<p>The pardons came a day before anti-abortion protesters were due to
descend on Washington for the annual March for Life.</p>

<p>Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein on Thursday told an Axios
reporter in Davos, Switzerland, that Elizabeth Tsurkov, a Princeton
doctoral candidate, is alive and that Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed
al-Sudani was working on her release, according to Reuters.</p>
<p>Tsurkov, 39, was abducted in Baghdad in March 2023 shortly after her
arrival in the Iraqi capital. The dual Israeli Russian citizen had
traveled to Iraq to conduct fieldwork for her dissertation.</p>
<p>Israeli citizens are forbidden from traveling to Iraq, but Tsurkov
used her Russian passport to enter the country, according to the Israeli
government.</p>
<p>The Israeli government said in July 2023 that Tsurkov was being held
by Kataib Hezbollah, a powerful Shia militia that has ties to the Iraqi
government and Iran.</p>
<p>In November 2023, Kataib Hezbollah, a U.S.-designated terrorist
organization, released a proof-of-life video of Tsurkov, the only
confirmed evidence of her fate to date.</p>
<p>Her sister, Emma Tsurkov, said the family was “pleased to see the
Iraqi government acknowledge what we already know: Elizabeth is alive
and being held hostage in Iraq by militias aligned with the Iraqi prime
minister.</p>
<p>“At the same time, we are fed up with empty promises from the Iraqi
government to get her released with no real follow-through,” she told
VOA.</p>
<p>Last year, Emma Tsurkov and two other siblings launched an extensive
campaign in Washington during an official visit by Sudani. During a
panel discussion hosted by the Atlantic Council, Emma Tsurkov
interrupted the Iraqi leader, protesting Baghdad’s inaction in securing
her sister’s release. In response, Sudani stated that his government had
formed a task force to follow up with Tsurkov’s case.</p>
<p>The U.S. State Department had confirmed that Tsurkov’s case was
raised by former President Joe Biden during his White House meeting with
Sudani.</p>
<p>Emma Tsurkov said the family “knows that Elizabeth’s case is already
on the radar of the new SPEHA,” referring to Adam Boehler, President
Donald Trump’s nominee for special presidential envoy for hostage
affairs.</p>
<p>Boehler must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate before he can formally
begin his role.</p>
<p>“We are confident the Trump team will hold the Iraqi government
accountable and make Elizabeth’s safe return a real priority and not
just a talking point like the last administration,” Emma Tsurkov
said.</p>
<p>VOA contacted the State Department for comment but did not receive a
response in time for publication.</p>

Under-the-Radar Implications of Trump’s Executive Orders</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-23, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTgwMDQyMS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2MDEzMDQ3NH0.PmlU4C9s0HToU7I_fWxARoIDWGWuA-FIydHr_fU-YSo/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
President Donald Trump signed 46 presidential actions during his first
12 hours in office, including overturning 78 of former President Joe
Biden’s executive orders. Between Trump’s moves with major ramifications
(like
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/wind-executive-order-trump" target="_self"><u>ending
all wind permits</u></a>) and those that seem to represent more personal
grievances (like
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/#:~:text=to%20safeguard%20the,and%20appliance%20industries%3B" target="_blank"><u>free-flowing
showerheads</u></a>), there has been much confusion over what they all
mean.
</p>
<p>
Some would argue that is the entire point: “The more bizarreness Trump
generates,” the journalist Edward Luce wrote last year
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/35106042-2e96-4dde-8cf6-734c6e89fd9e" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>for
</u><u><em><em>The Financial Times</em></em></u></a>, “the less people
notice.” Steve Bannon, Trump’s chief strategist during his rise to power
in 2015 and 2016, memorably described this as a deliberate technique of
“<a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/1/16/20991816/impeachment-trial-trump-bannon-misinformation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>flood[ing]
the zone with shit</u></a>.”
</p>
<p>
Whatever way you frame it, though, where there’s Trump, there’s noises,
which means news can fall through the cracks. Here’s our list of what
you might have missed during Trump’s first hours as president and what
might happen next.
</p>
<h3>
Environmental Justice
</h3>
<p>
In one of his first actions in office, Trump repealed almost seven-dozen
Biden-era executive orders, including Executive Order 13985, “Advancing
Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the
Federal Government.”
</p>
<p>
Signed on Biden’s Inauguration Day, the policy called for the government
to take a “comprehensive approach to advancing equity for all, including
people of color and others who have been historically underserved,
marginalized, and adversely affected by persistent poverty and
inequality.” That meant that the Environmental Protection Agency
<a href="https://natlawreview.com/article/environmental-justice-update-epa-issues-draft-cumulative-impacts-framework" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>considered
things like race and socioeconomic status</u></a> — given the historic
burdens put on frontline communities — during its permitting processes.
Trump also signed a new executive order,
“<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-illegal-discrimination-and-restoring-merit-based-opportunity/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Ending
Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity</u></a>,”
which limits government agencies from considering the impacts on
disadvantaged communities. The
<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/federal-workers-told-name-dei-colleagues-risk-adverse-consequences-rcna188871" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>administration
has reportedly gone as far</u></a> as to warn government employees that
they could face consequences for failing to report on colleagues whose
diversity and inclusion efforts might slip past its notice.
</p>
<p>
As Dan Farber
<a href="https://legal-planet.org/2025/01/23/trump-goes-to-war-against-environmental-justice/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>writes
for </u><u><em><em>Legal Planet</em></em></u></a>, however, to carry out
this anti-diversity, equity, and inclusion executive order, “agencies
will have to eliminate their own environmental justice regulations. At
that point, the door will be open to judicial review. I think agencies
will have a hard time justifying the repeals.”
</p>
<p>
Trump further
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-national-security" target="_self"><u>overturned
Executive Order 14008</u></a>, “Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and
Abroad,” another first-week Biden policy. In addition to declaring
climate change a national security risk, the order also created the
Justice40 initiative, directing 40% of federal climate spending to
disadvantaged communities.
</p>
<p>
Jillian Blanchard, the Climate Change and Environmental Justice Program
director at Lawyers for Good Government, told me this was also legally
dubious. “There’s already existing infrastructure and policies in place
that can’t be undone by an executive order,” she said — for example,
grants for
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/adamsmith.house.gov/post/3lfnpyslcfk26" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ongoing
efforts to install EV chargers</u></a> in disadvantaged communities, or
<a href="https://appvoices.org/2022/01/10/biden-mercury-air-pollution/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>clean-up
projects in coal mining communities</u></a> in Appalachia. “I think it’s
important to take a minute and say, okay, what does this mean in
practice?”
</p>
<p>
Blanchard added that, in particular, Trump’s moves on environmental
justice “make me question what this administration plans to do with
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act,” which prohibits race-based
discrimination in programs that receive federal funding. “There’s really
important questions here that are being raised that everyone should be
paying attention to.”
</p>
<h3>
ESG
</h3>
<p>
Trump also repealed Executive Order 14030, “Climate-Related Financial
Risk,” signed by Biden in May 2021.
<a href="https://www.paulweiss.com/insights/esg-thought-leadership/publications/president-biden-calls-on-federal-government-to-mitigate-climate-related-financial-risk?id=40177" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>The
executive order</u></a> called for government-wide assessment and
disclosure of climate-related financial risks to U.S. programs, and
ordered the Secretary of Labor to submit a report on actions to protect
U.S. workers’ savings and pensions from those same threats. Executive
Order 14030 also established
<a href="https://www.nrdc.org/bio/joel-scata/trump-revokes-federal-flood-protections-again" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
Federal Flood Risk Management Standard</u></a>, which called for
government agencies to be more conservative when siting projects that
could face sea-level rise or flood threats.
</p>
<p>
In addition to government agencies no longer being required to consider
how extreme weather and climate risks
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/22/climate/trump-climate-policies.html#:~:text=The%20Smithsonian%20Institution%2C%20for%20example%2C%20revealed%20in%202021%20that%20flooding%20threatened%20several%20of%20its%20museums%20on%20the%20National%20Mall%2C%20including%20the%20National%20Museum%20of%20American%20History." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>might
threaten their operations</u></a>, Trump’s executive order “Ending
Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity” also takes
aim at
<a href="https://www.ropesgray.com/en/insights/viewpoints/102jvg8/trump-administration-issues-executive-order-targeting-dei-in-the-private-sector" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>diversity,
equity, and inclusion hiring practices</u></a>, or the “social” aspect
of ESG.
</p>
<h3>
Renaming Denali
</h3>
<p>
Though you’ve probably already heard about Trump’s attempt to spangle
the Gulf of Mexico with a new name, the “
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/restoring-names-that-honor-american-greatness/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Restoring
Names That Honor American Greatness</u></a>” executive order also calls
for reverting the name of North America’s highest peak, Denali, back to
Mt. McKinley.
</p>
<p>
The political effort to change the mountain’s name to Denali, backed by
the state’s Republican politicians, dates back to the 1970s. (It took
until 2015 for the name to be changed to the Alaskan Athabaskan word
meaning “the high one” because of the Ohio delegation’s insistence on
honoring its native president.) Trump’s decision to restore the
mountain’s colonial name is a pointed brush-off of Alaskan Natives and
represents a troubling precedent by his administration of undermining
promises made to Indigenous partners by the federal government.
</p>
<p>
Tribal partners have historically
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/white-house-tribal-summit-partnership-public-lands-33039cb25459be5f64c9665e2fa47d93" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>assisted
the U.S. government</u></a> on issues of land use, resource management,
and climate resiliency, and can prove
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/sunzia-lawsuit-blm" target="_self"><u>formidable
opponents</u></a> to projects that
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/resolution-copper-mine" target="_self"><u>lack
their support</u></a>. By
<a href="https://www.ncronline.org/earthbeat/politics/alaska-native-leaders-call-preserve-denali-name-mount-mckinley" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>disregarding
Alaskan Natives’ support of the name Denali</u></a>, Trump risks
alienating the greater Indigenous community and starting off on a
contentious footing with one of the government’s most valuable allies.
</p>
<h3>
California water
</h3>
<p>
When the Los Angeles County fires began earlier this month, Trump
launched a renewed crusade against
<a href="https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/394283/los-angeles-wildfires-trump-newsom-delta-smelt" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
“essentially worthless” Delta smelt</u></a>, a nearly extinct
two-inch-long fish. Per the then-president-elect, California’s
Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom had supposedly refused to sign a “water
restoration declaration” that would have “allowed millions of gallons of
water … from the North to flow daily into many parts of California,”
where it allegedly could have helped to fight the devastating fires.
</p>
<p>
Only, there <em><em>was</em></em> no “water restoration declaration.”
The vast majority of Los Angeles’ water doesn’t come from northern
California, and the smelt have nothing to do with
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/california-los-angeles-wildfires-water-misinformation-27b0059719e8b475d452030c221fe544" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
water shortages</u></a> some fire crews faced. That didn’t prevent Trump
from
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/putting-people-over-fish-stopping-radical-environmentalism-to-provide-water-to-southern-california/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>issuing
a memorandum</u></a> to “stop radical environmentalism” and put “people
over fish.” Still,
<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/01/21/trump-water-california-fish-newsom/77848777007/#:~:text=is%20%22so%20vague%22%20that%20it%20is%20meant%20to%20appear%20he%20is%20keeping%20his%20word%20to%20farmers%20who%20overwhelmingly%20voted%20for%20him%20last%20year%2C" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>it
is so vague</u></a> that it appears to be more of a nod to the
Trump-supporting farmers in California’s Central Valley, who
occasionally face water restrictions during droughts
<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/sacramento/news/farmers-decry-supreme-courts-decision-not-to-hear-appeals-in-delta-smelt-case/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>to
protect the smelt</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
“It’s all political posturing — it’s all an attempt to shock and awe,”
Blanchard told me of the executive orders taken in sum. She added that
“it’s going to be really important for people to take a deep breath and
recognize that many of these things are not legal and challenges will be
put in place.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t become too distracted by fear and uncertainty,” she went on,
“because that is one of their main goals.”

<h2 id="elon-musk-and-the-legacy-of-moguls-in-american-politics">Elon
Musk and the legacy of moguls in American politics</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Business has been intertwined with American politics since before the
nation’s founding. And although unelected business leaders play a major
role in financing campaigns and policy initiatives, few in recent memory
have taken as personal and public a role in politics as Elon Musk.</p>
<p>Even before the 2024 election, the South African-born entrepreneur
often interacted with the U.S. government via his companies. His
electric car manufacturer, Tesla, has received green energy subsidies,
while his company Space X holds multiple contracts with NASA and the
U.S. military to provide space-launch services, develop vehicles and
operate flights.</p>
<p>Through SpaceX, Musk also played a key role in U.S. support for
Ukraine’s defense against Russia’s invasion by providing Starlink
satellite internet terminals to Ukrainian forces. Musk’s involvement in
the war became a source of concern after reports emerged that he was
directly making decisions regarding the terminals’ use in the field and
was in personal contact with Russian President Vladimir Putin and other
top Russian officials.</p>
<p>Musk attained an even more notable role in the media through his 2022
purchase of social media platform Twitter, which had become a de facto
public square where journalists, companies and government officials made
public announcements and engaged in discussion alongside regular
users.</p>
<p>Renaming the site X, Musk overhauled verification and content
moderation policies to combat what he described as left-wing bias,
reinstating President Donald Trump’s account as well as multiple
accounts that had been banned for hate speech. As the presidential
election drew near, Musk used the platform to boost Trump’s policy
positions, eventually making campaign appearances alongside him and
sitting in on his calls with foreign leaders.</p>
<p>Musk’s involvement culminated in the businessman being announced as
head of a new advisory commission on government efficiency, named after
an internet meme and cryptocurrency that Musk himself had
popularized.</p>
<p>But while Musk’s involvement in U.S. politics may be unusual compared
to his contemporaries, it recalls earlier eras when larger-than-life
business leaders exercised great influence over the country’s
affairs.</p>
<p>J.P. Morgan (1837-1913)</p>
<p>Having made his early career on Wall Street, John Pierpont Morgan
gained fame by reorganizing the country’s booming railroad industry in
the wake of the Civil War. By organizing conferences among railroad
companies and consolidating the ones he held shares in, he helped create
an integrated rail system, as he would later do with the nation’s steel
production.</p>
<p>When the economic panic of 1893 saw the U.S. running out of gold
reserves, Morgan’s company stepped in to bail out the government,
supplying gold in exchange for Treasury bonds.</p>
<p>Then in 1907, when a financial panic threatened to collapse the
nation’s banks, Morgan was again credited with saving the country by
bringing together bank executives and forcing them to agree on a mutual
stabilization plan.</p>
<p>Morgan is remembered as a serious businessman who prioritized
stability over speculation and supported hospitals, museums and
universities through his philanthropic efforts. But Morgan’s integration
of railroad and steel industries created monopolies that inspired the
nation’s earliest antitrust laws.</p>
<p>Moreover, the fact that the U.S. government twice had to rely on a
private businessman to bail out its finances became a major cause for
concern, leading to the creation of the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>Henry Ford (1863-1947)</p>
<p>Henry Ford is best known for developing the first mass-produced
automobile, making what was previously a luxury product affordable for
the average consumer. Beyond the road, Ford popularized the assembly
line and the 40-hour workweek as well as setting higher wage standards
under the reasoning that better-paid and happier workers would be more
productive and able to buy the cars they made.</p>
<p>Ford believed that industry and consumerism would not only benefit
the economy but promote world peace, actively campaigning against war as
a waste of productivity. Having failed to prevent U.S. entry into World
War I, Ford dutifully supplied the war effort and quieted his activism,
but he still ran for U.S. Senate in 1918 — a race he narrowly lost.</p>
<p>Yet not all aspects of Ford’s reputation have aged well. The tycoon’s
paternalistic and generous approach to his employees went hand-in-hand
with his adamant opposition to unionization efforts and worker strikes,
which were suppressed by force.</p>
<p>His pacifism had a darker side as well. Ford was notably antisemitic
and believed that Jewish people had been responsible for World War I as
well as multiple ills in American society. After buying the Dearborn
Independent newspaper in 1918, Ford used it to publish multiple
antisemitic conspiracy theories, stopping only after threats of a
boycott against his companies.</p>
<p>As part of the America First Committee, Ford campaigned against U.S.
entry into World War II and continued to do business with Nazi Germany
up until the U.S. declared war in 1941.</p>
<p>William Randolph Hearst (1863-1951)</p>
<p>As owner of the San Francisco Examiner and the New York Morning
Journal, Hearst built a media empire while pioneering a form of
sensationalistic reporting that came to be known as “yellow journalism.”
The Journal’s exaggerated reports of Spain’s colonial violence in Cuba
inflamed American opinion and increased calls to intervene. When
Congress eventually declared war on Spain in 1898, Hearst personally
traveled to Cuba to cover the conflict.</p>
<p>Hearst’s media operations would later expand to more than two dozen
newspapers in multiple cities, as well as magazines and book
publishers.</p>
<p>After setting his sights on politics, Hearst briefly served in the
U.S. House of Representatives for New York’s 11th district but narrowly
lost subsequent mayoral and gubernatorial bids. Hearst’s papers had
published editorials violently denouncing President William McKinley,
and he was blamed for incitement upon McKinley’s assassination in
1901.</p>
<p>Initially a progressive populist, Hearst shifted toward right-wing
isolationism in the wake of World War I and the 1917 Russian Revolution.
While denouncing President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s New Deal policies
as anti-American, Hearst expressed admiration for Hitler and published
articles by the German leader. Nevertheless, Hearst supported U.S. entry
into World War II following the attack on Pearl Harbor, shifting his
focus to promoting anti-Asian sentiment and the internment of Japanese
Americans.</p>
<p>Today, Hearst is remembered as the real-life inspiration for the film
“Citizen Kane,” which was made during his lifetime and which he sought
to block from being released.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Tycoons who shaped American politics in past eras inspired admiration
and controversy, their impact becoming clear only in hindsight. It
remains to be seen whether Musk’s influence will outlast the Trump
administration, and whether other modern-day moguls will follow his
example.</p>

<h2 id="senate-confirms-trumps-choice-for-cia-director">Senate confirms
Trump’s choice for CIA director</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — U.S. lawmakers confirmed a second key member of
President Donald Trump’s national security team Thursday, voting 74-25
to make John Ratcliffe the 25th director of the country’s premier spy
agency.</p>
<p>Ratcliffe, who served as director of national intelligence at the end
of Trump’s first term, took the oath of office about two hours later, as
administered by Vice President JD Vance. </p>
<p>Vance called Ratcliffe a “great patriot” and said he is someone who
has the trust of the president.</p>
<p>Ratcliffe now will head an intelligence operation that Trump and
Republicans have criticized for a failure to cultivate information on
critical developments in places like Ukraine, Afghanistan and the Middle
East, and for using the information it did get to defend the previous
administration’s policies.</p>
<p>Ratcliffe indicated during his confirmation hearing last week that
substantial changes would be in store, saying the spy agency would be
more aggressive both in collecting human intelligence and in countering
U.S. adversaries.</p>
<p>“We will collect intelligence, especially human intelligence, in
every corner of the globe no matter how dark or difficult,” he told
lawmakers at the time. “We will conduct covert actions at the direction
of the president, going places no one else can go and doing things no
one else can do.</p>
<p>“To the brave CIA officers listening around the world, if all of this
sounds like what you signed up for, then buckle up and get ready to make
a difference,” Ratcliffe added. “If it doesn’t, then it’s time to find a
new line of work.”</p>
<p>The confirmation vote came three days after Trump took the oath of
office and after a plea from the top Republican and Democrat on the
Senate Intelligence Committee for a speedy vote on Ratcliffe’s
nomination to lead the CIA.</p>
<p>“Our world is far too dangerous for any delay in having a
Senate-confirmed leader in charge of the CIA,” Senators Tom Cotton and
Mark Warner said in a statement Monday, after their committee advanced
Ratcliffe by a 14-3 margin.</p>
<p>Push from Thune</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a Republican, on Tuesday also
pushed for his colleagues to move quickly on Ratcliffe’s nomination.</p>
<p>“Under the Biden administration, the intelligence community made some
notable misses,” Thune said. “Mr. Ratcliffe brings the right experience
and the right approach to the CIA,” he said.</p>
<p>Cotton, the Senate Intelligence Committee chairman, also praised
Ratcliffe as someone capable of getting the CIA back on track. </p>
<p>“The nation needs a strong, capable and aggressive CIA,” he told
Ratcliffe at his confirmation hearing last week. “I believe the men and
women you will lead want to serve in just that kind of agency. They
joined the CIA, after all, not a church choir or a therapy session.”</p>
<p>But the confirmation vote was delayed after criticism from some
leading Democrats.</p>
<p>“I want the record to show that I strongly oppose the nomination,”
Democrat Ron Wyden said Tuesday.</p>
<p>“In 2020, I opposed his confirmation to be director of national
intelligence because I believe his partisanship and willingness
essentially went to the proposition of doing what would please Donald
Trump,” he said. “Unfortunately, his actions as head of national
intelligence only confirmed my concerns.”</p>
<p>Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer echoed that opposition before
Thursday’s vote.</p>
<p>“I will respectfully vote no, not because of our political
difference, which of course exists, but because I am deeply worried that
Mr. Ratcliffe will be unable to stand up to people like Donald Trump and
Tulsi Gabbard, who are known to falsify intelligence,” he said.</p>
<p>“There may be no agency more important than the CIA that has to be
fact-based. Sometimes, these facts will lead to inconvenient conclusions
for his superiors and the president,” he said. “It’s in those cases
where truth, not fiction, not ideology, must prevail, and I have my
doubts that Mr. Ratcliffe will be able to hold firm.”</p>
<p>Gabbard hearing scheduled</p>
<p>Gabbard, a veteran of the U.S. Army National Guard and a former
Democratic lawmaker, is Trump’s choice to be the next director of
national intelligence.</p>
<p>Her confirmation hearing has been scheduled for next week, when she
will be asked about accusations from both Democrats and some Republicans
that she has repeated Russian disinformation and about her 2017 meeting
with former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who stands accused of war
crimes.</p>
<p>Ratcliffe’s opponents have accused him of defying Congress and
withholding information in the 2018 murder of Washington Post journalist
Jamal Khashoggi – a killing that U.S. intelligence concluded was ordered
by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.</p>
<p>They also have criticized Ratcliffe, in his role as director of
national intelligence, for the September 2020 release of a Russian
intelligence assessment that seemed to back Trump’s allegations of
nefarious activity by his opponent in the 2016 U.S. presidential
election, Democrat Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p>But that decision, and others by Ratcliffe to push back against
previous U.S. intelligence assessments that Russia had endeavored to
help Trump win the 2016 election, is part of what endeared him to the
president.</p>
<p>And Ratcliffe’s insistence on a more aggressive CIA, according to
some analysts, resonated with both Republicans and Democrats.</p>
<p>“There was criticism throughout the hearing that the CIA has gone
soft on collecting human intelligence, on stealing foreign adversary
secrets,” Tyler McBrien, the managing editor of Lawfare, told VOA. “A
lot of criticisms about how the CIA has failed to predict in the past
four years major geopolitical events, including the fall of the Assad
regime and even the New Orleans terrorist attack.”</p>
<p>“Ratcliffe really is focused on that human intelligence aspect and
also a reorientation toward what he sees as the biggest national
security threat, which is China,” McBrien said.</p>
<p>No-bias pledge</p>
<p>Ratcliffe has promised lawmakers that under his leadership the CIA
will deliver insights free of political bias and that he will not lead a
purge of employees based on their perceived political views or perceived
loyalty to Trump.</p>
<p>He also promised to reinvigorate CIA investigations into the cause of
Havana Syndrome — the name given to a series of brain injuries and other
serious health ailments that have struck hundreds of U.S. diplomats and
intelligence officials.</p>
<p>And he voiced support for maintaining controversial U.S. surveillance
authorities under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act, calling it an indispensable tool.  </p>

id="trump-to-global-businesses-make-products-in-us-or-pay-tariffs-1">Trump
to global businesses: Make products in US or pay tariffs</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday invited global businesses to
manufacture their products in the U.S. and promised them lower taxes but
warned if they chose to produce their goods elsewhere, they would have
to pay tariffs to export them to the United States.</p>
<p>“America is back and open for business,” Trump, in a video linkup
from Washington, told corporate leaders meeting at the World Economic
Forum in Davos, Switzerland.</p>
<p>“My message to every business in the world is very simple: Come make
your product in America, and we will give you among the lowest taxes of
any nation on Earth,” Trump said. “But if you don’t make your product in
America, which is your prerogative, then, very simply, you will have to
pay a tariff.”</p>
<p>Trump, three days into his second term in the White House, said he
wants to cut the U.S. corporate tax rate from 21 to 15%, although that
needs approval from his political allies in the Republican-controlled
Congress. Lawmakers have begun debating how to extend and reshape
personal and corporate tax cuts enacted in 2017 during Trump’s first
term in office.</p>
<p>Trump promised the U.S. would supply Europe with the liquified
natural gas it needs but contended that the European Union treats the
United States “very, very unfairly” with the extent of regulations it
imposes on American businesses operating in the 27-nation bloc.</p>
<p>The president complained specifically about tariffs and environmental
impact statements for new construction projects, calling them “things
you shouldn’t have to do.”</p>
<p>Trump promised that his administration would make the U.S., already
the world’s biggest economy, “a manufacturing superpower” and said the
government during his four-year term would eliminate 10 business
regulations for every new one that is imposed.</p>
<p>He said he plans to ask Saudi Arabia and the Organization of the
Petroleum Exporting Countries to cut the price of oil they produce to
boost the global economy.</p>
<p>He contended that if the current global oil price — about $77 a
barrel — is cut, “the war in Ukraine will end immediately.” Russia uses
revenue from its own oil production to help fund its three-year war on
neighboring Ukraine.</p>
<p>Trump said that in the global economy, the U.S. “just wants to be
treated fairly by other countries.”</p>
<p>He said the U.S. wants to have a “fair relationship” with China, the
world’s second-biggest economy.</p>
<p>“We don’t want to take advantage,” he said of Washington-Beijing
relations. “We just want to have a level playing field.”</p>

<h2 id="what-a-tax-expert-thinks-of-trumps-ira-order">What a Tax Expert
Thinks of Trump’s IRA Order</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-23, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p>
Given the Trump administration’s new pause on grants under the Inflation
Reduction Act, this week’s conversation is with Bob Moczulewski, tax
director for Baker Tilly’s federal credits and incentives practice. We
asked him to explain this 90-day pause via executive order, because if
anyone’s going to cut the nonsense and tell you what actually matters
here, it’ll be a tax expert.
</p>
<p>
The following chat was lightly edited for clarity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Does Trump’s executive order actually impact the IRA’s tax
credits? </strong>
</p>
<p>
The IRA had several components to it, most of which – the biggest things
– are tax credits. Those are written into tax law. They are a legally
binding ability for developers and users, creators of renewable energy
that are allowed within the law – wind, solar, geothermal, battery
storage, biogas – those are laws.
</p>
<p>
[The order] has a stop on those items that were more discretionary that
had the control of the administration to delegate out: its grants,
loans, and contracts. That has no impact on the tax credits, where the
bulk of the IRA sits right now. A lot of that stuff was in anticipation
of being heavily pushed through and sent out before January 20. There’s
actual impact there. But tax credits are not appropriated funds.
</p>
<p>
This is not holding back the tax credits that are there.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.bakertilly.com/insights/new-executive-order-pauses-funding-under-ira-iija" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><strong>You’ve
said</strong></u></a><strong> it is unclear if this covers all
prospective funding, like direct pay? </strong>
</p>
<p>
If you’re a municipality and you put up a solar project that is eligible
for tax credits and direct pay, that is the part with this potential
slow play that could be done here. We really don’t know what the
executive branch can do to hold back the payment of those direct
payments. If you’re a business, you put up a solar, it’s a $10,000 tax
credit, you can use it to reduce your taxable income. None of these
orders impact that.
</p>
<p>
Now if you’re a municipality and you’re requesting a direct payment for
those tax credits that are legally binding in tax law, I could see the
possibility that an executive branch could have pressure on the Treasury
Department, which has pressure on the IRS, to slow play those payments.
But that’s only speculation. The law is stated, this is supposed to be
paid out. This is in a realm of, y’know, almost a conspiracy theory-type
of thing that could be done.
</p>
<p>
<strong>With respect to how a pause like this can impact the bankability
of IRA, are you seeing it affect executives’ views on the durability of
the law? </strong>
</p>
<p>
I would say there’s just a lot of caution as to [the] next steps around
it. These are laws. Until the laws are repealed, if they are repealed,
that would be the only way you’d know for certain.
</p>
<p>
As I’ve explained many times over, the history of tax credit laws is
once they’re repealed or altered, those changes are prospective as to
the time the law is changed. If I have a half a billion dollar solar
project underway, I’ve met or begun a construction criteria. There has
been no prior passing of tax laws that would revoke the ability to claim
credits on that.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What are you watching for next for clarity? </strong>
</p>
<p>
There’s two things I’m looking for in the future. Where pundits around
this really feel this is truly going. And the other part is to see if
there’s any actual traction to repeal the tax credits that exist right
now.
</p>
<p>
There’s a whole new realm of credits that begin in 2025 and continue
through 2032. Will there be incentive to repeal those credits?
</p>
<p>
I have clients that are engaging in multi billions of dollars of
projects that are in the heart of the southern tier of the United States
of America, that would impact thousands of jobs. Those groups have
strong ties to a lot of senators and congresspeople along the way. Just
enough of a push and turn on this and all it takes is a few senators to
not go along with it.

<strong>1. Magic Valley, Idaho</strong> – It’s never a dull day for the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/risk-index" target="_self">Lava Ridge wind
project</a>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Trump’s
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/wind-executive-order-trump" target="_self"><u>executive
order</u></a> also put a moratorium on the wind project site and
essentially invalidated its environmental review under Biden. As we’ve
explained, the project got permits in the final days of the previous
administration.<br/>
</li>
<li>
But opponents to the project – most notably Senator Jim Risch – got the
president to turn this into a
<a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/hotspots/lava-ridge-wind-trump-executive-order" target="_self"><u>Keystone
XL-style situation</u></a>. Idaho Governor Brad Little yesterday issued
an executive order instructing state regulators to comply with anything
Trump’s folks do to stop the project, an executive order of his own he
jokingly dubbed the “Gone With The Lava Ridge Wind Act.”<br/>
</li>
<li>
Lava Ridge has been crickets since Trump’s order and its developer Magic
Valley Energy has not issued a public statement. The most recent
statement available on their website is still about its permits being
approved under Biden.
</li>
<li>
I’ve tried to get in touch with them via the most recently-listed media
contact for the project all week over phone and email – most recently
this afternoon – but have had no luck. (Amy, please call me back.)

<strong>2. Multiple counties, Ohio </strong>– Regulators in Ohio issued
final decisions for two contested solar projects, clearing the way for
one while all but stopping another.

<li>
Savion’s Clear Mountain Energy Center solar-plus-battery project in
Clermont County, Ohio, was

by</u></a> the Ohio Power Siting Board last week.<br/>
</li>
<li>
But Samsung’s Richmond Solar project in Union County was rejected by the
OPSB, citing local opposition to say it did not serve “public interest,
convenience, and necessity.” The project would also include battery
storage if constructed.
</li>
<li>
OPSB also denied a petition for a rehearing for NextEra’s Circleville
Solar project in Pickaway County, which had previously had its approval
denied by the regulator.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>3. Pender County, North Carolina </strong>– A solar project that
was rejected late last year by the North Carolina Court of Appeals will
be
<a href="https://www.carolinajournal.com/appeals-court-to-reconsider-ruling-in-pender-county-solar-farm-dispute/" target="_blank">reconsidered</a>
by the same court, after the Democrat vote that decided the case was
replaced by a Republican.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
At the end of last year, the appeals court ruled Coastal Pine Solar had
failed to demonstrate a solar project it proposed in Pender County
sufficiently complied with a local restrictive ordinance. The ruling was
<a href="https://www.carolinajournal.com/appeals-court-upholds-pender-countys-rejection-of-2300-acre-solar-farm/" target="_blank"><u>not

there’ll be a second go at the case.

the decision</u></a> to approve it was only possible after at least some
concessions to the concerns in the community, including a vegetation
management plan.

</ul>
<p>
<strong>5. Montgomery County, Alabama </strong>– Another solar project –
Silicon Ranch – also got approval this past week from the local Board of
Adjustments, meaning a Meta data center is now poised to receive
renewable energy.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Activism against the project is quite pronounced, as we’ve been covering
closely in The Fight. I’m anticipating a little more noise in the coming
weeks about how to stop this project in spite of the local approval.

id="us-lawmakers-seek-to-end-chinas-special-trade-status-import-exemption">US
lawmakers seek to end China’s special trade status, import
exemption</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. lawmakers introduced a bipartisan bill on Thursday
that would revoke China’s preferential trade status with the United
States, phase in steep tariffs and end the “de minimis” exemption for
low-value Chinese imports.</p>
<p>The bill, introduced by John Moolenaar, the Republican chair of the
House of Representatives select committee on China, comes after
President Donald Trump issued a memo on Monday asking his cabinet to
assess legislation on the Permanent Normal Trade Relations designation
for Beijing.</p>
<p>Congress approved PNTR for China in 2000, paving the way for its
entry into the World Trade Organization. But the U.S. has routinely
found the large role of the state in China’s economy, including hefty
government subsidies for strategic industries, to violate the global
trade body’s rules.</p>
<p>Trump, who has railed against China’s vast trade surplus with the
U.S., has vowed more duties on Chinese goods.</p>
<p>Moolenaar’s Restoring Trade Fairness Act was co-sponsored by
Democratic Representative Tom Suozzi and introduced with a companion
bill in the Senate. Moolenaar said granting China PNTR had ushered in
waves of Chinese imports, depleted U.S. manufacturing and made the U.S.
susceptible to economic coercion from its “foremost adversary.”</p>
<p>“This gamble failed,” Moolenaar said in a statement. “This
legislation will safeguard U.S. national security, enhance supply chain
resilience, and bring manufacturing jobs back to America and our
allies.”</p>
<p>China’s embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a
request for comment.</p>
<p>The path for the bill to become law was not immediately clear, but
Republicans hold majorities in both the House and Senate. Lawmakers from
both parties say they want to increase U.S. companies’ ability to
compete with China.</p>
<p>Waves of U.S. tariffs by Trump in his first term and by the Biden
administration had effectively ended PNTR treatment for China.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the proposed legislation would end annual
recertification of the designation and codify minimum 35% tariffs for
non-strategic goods and minimum 100% tariffs for strategic goods. The
duties would be phased in over five years — 10% in the first year, 25%
in the second year, 50% in year four and 100% by year five.</p>
<p>The bill would also end de minimis treatment for certain “covered
nations,” including China.</p>
<p>Trump has called for changes to the $800 de minimis duty-free
exemption for low-value shipments often blamed for illicit imports of
fentanyl precursor chemicals from China.</p>
<p>Critics of de minimis say it contributes to the United States’ trade
deficit with China — $279 billion in 2023, according to the U.S. Census
Bureau.</p>

id="federal-judge-temporarily-blocks-trumps-order-redefining-birthright-citizenship">Federal
judge temporarily blocks Trump’s order redefining birthright
citizenship</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SEATTLE, WASHINGTON — A federal judge on Thursday temporarily blocked
President Donald Trump’s executive order denying U.S. citizenship to the
children of parents living in the country illegally, calling it
“blatantly unconstitutional” during the first hearing in a multistate
effort challenging the order. </p>
<p>The 14th Amendment to the Constitution promises citizenship to those
born on U.S. soil, a measure ratified in 1868 to ensure citizenship for
former slaves after the Civil War. But in an effort to curb unlawful
immigration, Trump issued the executive order just after being sworn in
for his second term on Monday. </p>
<p>The order would deny citizenship to those born after February 19
whose parents are in the country illegally. It also would forbid U.S.
agencies from issuing any document or accepting any state document
recognizing citizenship for such children. </p>
<p>Trump’s order drew immediate legal challenges across the country,
with at least five lawsuits being brought by 22 states and a number of
immigrants’ rights groups. A lawsuit brought by Washington, Arizona,
Oregon and Illinois was the first to get a hearing. </p>
<p>“I’ve been on the bench for over four decades. I can’t remember
another case where the question presented was as clear as this one is,”
U.S. District Judge John Coughenour told a Justice Department attorney.
“This is a blatantly unconstitutional order.” </p>
<p>Thursday’s decision prevents the Trump administration from taking
steps to implement the executive order for 14 days. In the meantime, the
parties will submit further arguments about the merits of Trump’s order.
Coughenour scheduled a hearing on February 6 to decide whether to block
it long term as the case proceeds. </p>
<p>Coughenour, 84, a Ronald Reagan appointee who was nominated to the
federal bench in 1981, grilled the DOJ attorney, Brett Shumate, asking
whether Shumate personally believed the order was constitutional. </p>
<p>Shumate assured the judge he did — “absolutely.” He said the
arguments the Trump administration is making now have never previously
been litigated, and that there was no reason to issue a 14-day temporary
restraining order when it would expire before the executive order takes
effect. </p>
<p>The Department of Justice later said in a statement that it would
“vigorously defend” the president’s executive order, which it said
“correctly interprets the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.” </p>
<p>“We look forward to presenting a full merits argument to the court
and to the American people, who are desperate to see our nation’s laws
enforced,” the department said. </p>
<p>The U.S. is among about 30 countries where birthright citizenship —
the principle of jus soli or “right of the soil” — is applied. Most are
in the Americas, and Canada and Mexico are among them. </p>
<p>The 14th Amendment was ratified in 1868, in the aftermath of the
Civil War, to ensure citizenship for former slaves and free African
Americans. It states: “All persons born or naturalized in the United
States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the
United States and of the State wherein they reside.” </p>
<p>Trump’s order asserts that the children of noncitizens are not
“subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States, and therefore not
entitled to citizenship. </p>
<p>Arguing for the states on Thursday, Washington Assistant Attorney
General Lane Polozola called that absurd, noting that neither those who
have immigrated illegally nor their children are immune from U.S.
law. </p>
<p>“Are they not subject to the decisions of the immigration courts?”
Polozola asked. “Must they not follow the law while they are here?” </p>
<p>Polozola also said the restraining order was warranted because, among
other reasons, the executive order would immediately start requiring the
states to spend millions to revamp health care and benefits systems to
reconsider an applicant’s citizenship status. </p>
<p>“The executive order will impact hundreds of thousands of citizens
nationwide who will lose their citizenship under this new rule,”
Polozola said. “Births cannot be paused while the court considers this
case.” </p>
<p>Washington Attorney General Nick Brown told reporters afterward he
was not surprised that Coughenour had little patience with the Justice
Department’s position, considering that the Citizenship Clause arose
from one of the darkest chapters of American law, the Supreme Court’s
1857 Dred Scott decision, which held that African Americans, whether
enslaved or free, were not entitled to citizenship. </p>
<p>“Babies are being born today, tomorrow, every day, all across this
country, and so we had to act now,” Brown said. He added that it has
been “the law of the land for generations that you are an American
citizen if you are born on American soil, period.” </p>
<p>A key case involving birthright citizenship unfolded in 1898. The
Supreme Court held that Wong Kim Ark, who was born in San Francisco to
Chinese immigrants, was a U.S. citizen because he was born in the
country. </p>
<p>But some advocates of immigration restrictions have argued that case
clearly applied to children born to parents who were both legal
immigrants. They say it’s less clear whether it applies to children born
to parents living in the country illegally. </p>
<p>Trump’s order prompted attorneys general to share their personal
connections to birthright citizenship. Connecticut Attorney General
William Tong, for instance, a U.S. citizen by birthright and the
nation’s first Chinese American elected attorney general, said the
lawsuit was personal for him. Later Thursday, he said Coughenour made
the right decision. </p>
<p>“There is no legitimate legal debate on this question. But the fact
that Trump is dead wrong will not prevent him from inflicting serious
harm right now on American families like my own,” Tong said this
week.</p>

Wind Order Could Hit ‘More Than Half’ of New Projects</h2>

<p class="drop-caps">
President Trump’s
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/wind-executive-order-trump" target="_self"><u>executive
order halting permits and leases</u></a> for wind projects is starting
to look like a potential existential threat to the industry’s future.
Just don’t expect <em>everyone</em> to
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/wind-industry-trump-order" target="_self"><u>say
it out loud</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
On Monday, Trump
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/temporary-withdrawal-of-all-areas-on-the-outer-continental-shelf-from-offshore-wind-leasing-and-review-of-the-federal-governments-leasing-and-permitting-practices-for-wind-projects/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>issued
an order</u></a> pausing new federal approvals for wind projects,
pending a “comprehensive assessment” of permitting practices, while
opening the door to a review of existing leases and previously-issued
permits subject to litigation. In the days following the order, lawyers,
industry trade representatives, and professionals who work for renewable
energy developers explained to me how this could impact essentially
<em>any</em> wind project, even ones not sited on federal lands. Wind
projects are just so large and impactful<em> </em>that it’s hard to
avoid a federal permit.
</p>
<p>
Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, told me
Wednesday afternoon that a pause on federal permits would impact
“probably more than half” of all wind projects under development in the
U.S.
</p>
<p>
“If in fact the federal government stops issuing approvals, a
significant amount of the pipeline would be interrupted,” Grumet said.
</p>
<p>
Given the high costs associated with building a wind project, and the
likelihood of tariffs making that situation worse, the uncertainty
produced by a potential halt to permits may also be enough to cause
developers to pull the plug on projects – because even if the order
itself winds up tossed out in court, that could take years.
</p>
<p>
As one renewable energy professional told me anonymously, for fear of
reprisal, “If we say, well we probably have the right to do this but we
have to sue the government to enforce that right, it’s probably only
going to get the [project] deal done 40% of the time now.” He concluded:
“It’s definitely going to chill investment.”
</p>
<p>
It’s early days, and Grumet of ACP says he’s holding out hope that the
new president can be walked back from the brink. He’s focusing on the
possibility that people in the administration including Trump’s picks to
run the Interior and Energy Departments – Doug Burgum and Chris Wright –
are willing to listen and potentially help walk back a complete and
total permitting shutdown.
</p>
<p>
When asked however if suing the administration may be required, Grumet
said it’s a hypothetical that could come true in the worst case
scenarios.
</p>
<p>
“We’re taking it seriously. But the idea that you would have a
pro-business administration trying to stop private companies from taking
economically appropriate action on private land is just so out of step
with the role of government that we’re expecting they’re going to
clarify their intent.”
</p>
<h3>
Fear of a federal nexus
</h3>
<p>
Trump’s executive order is so far-reaching because wind projects
regularly need federal permits and other authorizations, even if they’re
sited on private or state lands.
</p>
<p>
A commonly cited federal nexus is endangered species. Opponents of wind
energy have long criticized turbines for being a potential threat to
birds, but it is the case that many wind projects are collocated within
or near areas for rare bird migration. Cultural heritage impacts can
often also be a difficulty.
</p>
<p>
One major threat I’ve been hearing about from many in the industry flew
out of left field: the Federal Aviation Administration
<a href="https://www.cjonline.com/story/business/energy-resource/2023/04/13/new-wind-farm-law-in-kansas-requires-light-mitigation-technology-laura-kelly-bill-signing/70100104007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>often</u></a>
<a href="https://www.thealpenanews.com/news/local-news/2020/08/faa-wind-farm-could-hurt-rogers-city-airport/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>must</u></a>
<a href="https://www.kmvt.com/2024/06/07/labrador-announces-faa-appeal-lava-ridge-project/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>clear</u></a>
<a href="https://law.stanford.edu/publications/avoiding-the-brewing-battle-between-military-and-windfarms/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>wind
projects</u></a>
<a href="https://www.abilene-rc.com/news/wind-farm-company-edges-closer-to-submitting-application-to-county/article_2feac21c-2348-11ef-a86d-37af3bdcb8c0.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>for
construction</u></a>. Matt Eisenson, an expert in renewables permitting
at the Columbia University Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, told me
FAA approvals are required “very frequently” for wind projects because
any land structure
<a href="https://oeaaa.faa.gov/oeaaa/external/gisTools/gisAction.jsp" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more
than 200</u></a> feet tall
<a href="https://www.lermansenter.com/faa-adopt-new-rules-require-certain-50-200-foot-towers-clearly-marked/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>must
be approved</u></a> to not be a hazard for commercial planes. And while
the order didn’t cite the FAA specifically, it instructed all “relevant
agencies” to wind permitting stop giving approvals related to projects,
opening the door to aviation-related clearances idling on a procedural
tarmac.
</p>
<p>
“It’s hard to avoid it if you’ve got anything sizable,” an attorney who
works in the renewable energy industry told me, adding the total scope
of impact is still unknown: “There’s nobody you could talk to who could
have nearly all the answers [about Trump’s order]. And that includes
developers and companies, because they don’t know either.” (It’s worth
noting no industry attorney would be willing to go on the record with me
because of ongoing impacts to clients.)
</p>
<p>
Then there’s the existing leases and permits. It’s easy to assume that a
permit issued is a permit safe, and the Biden administration quickly
rushed approvals for many wind projects, onshore and offshore, in the
final days before Trump’s inauguration.
</p>
<p>
But the order left open a process to challenge existing approvals
through litigation. In the offshore wind space, we’re already seeing
public requests for Trump to review the leases for the
<a href="https://www.capegazette.com/article/delaware-senate-gop-asks-trump-revoke-offshore-wind-permits/286175" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>MarWin
project</u></a> off the coast of Maryland and Delaware, and
<a href="https://www.savelbi.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Atlantic
Shores</u></a> off the coast of New Jersey.
</p>
<p>
Paul Kamenar, a lawyer involved in a suit challenging Dominion Energy’s
<a href="https://virginiabusiness.com/dominion-says-offshore-wind-farm-moving-forward-despite-executive-order/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Coastal
Virginia offshore wind project</u></a>, says we can expect the same in
his case. Kamenar is with the National Legal and Policy Center, which
joined with the Heartland Institute and anti-wind group CFACT to sue the
government for approving Coastal Virginia, claiming it did not consider
the cumulative impacts of building the project on endangered whales.
</p>
<p>
Kamenar told me he believes the order shows Trump’s team is sympathetic
to the arguments raised in the case, and he’s planning to file a request
for the federal government to reconsider its permits and leasing for the
project as soon as next week. Kamenar said the order provides avenues
for similar challenges to many other projects.
</p>
<p>
“I think this affects all the onshore and offshore wind projects,”
Kamenar said. “Some more than others. But if I were the energy company,
I would be loath to continue going forward until I got clarification.”
</p>
<p>
Eisenson at Columbia told me the executive order “opened the door” to a
massive range of new potential hurdles for wind development. He sees
legal vulnerabilities in the executive order because there’s a history
in recent case law surrounding Biden’s pauses on federal oil and gas
leasing. But that’s cold comfort for an industry with such high capital
costs that it describes low interest rates as
its<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/federal-reserve-interest-rates-energy" target="_self"><u>
“fuel</u></a>.”
</p>
<p>
“This could have a major chilling impact,” Eisenson said. “Even if the
EO is unlawful, it could take years in court to invalidate an unlawful
decision.”

heads to Central America as Washington intensifies efforts to curb
illegal migration</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>STATE DEPARTMENT — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is scheduled
to visit Panama and other countries in Central America amid President
Donald Trump’s push to reclaim the Panama Canal and Washington’s efforts
to curb illegal migration.  </p>
<p>State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce confirmed that Rubio will
travel to Panama, Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica and the Dominican
Republic starting late next week.The trip is expected to mark Rubio’s
first foreign visit as secretary of state.  </p>
<p>The State Department said that Rubio is prioritizing engagement
within the Western Hemisphere. </p>
<p>A spokesperson told VOA, “Engaging with our neighbors is a vital
element in addressing migration, supply chains and economic growth,
which are key to Secretary Rubio’s pursuit of foreign policy focused on
making America strong, prosperous, and safe.”  </p>
<p>Trump has said he has not ruled out the possibility of either
military or economic measures to achieve his stated goal of bringing the
Panama Canal back under U.S. control.  </p>
<p>Earlier this week, Rubio outlined his foreign policy priorities,
including halting the mass entry of undocumented migrants into the
United States.  </p>
<p>“The State Department will no longer undertake any activities that
facilitate or encourage mass migration,” Rubio said in a statement. “Our
diplomatic relations with other countries, particularly in the Western
Hemisphere, will prioritize securing America’s borders, stopping illegal
and destabilizing migration, and negotiating the repatriation of illegal
immigrants” to their home countries.</p>

Perez’ tops Oscar nominations in fire-hit Hollywood</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — Transgender cartel musical “Emilia Perez” topped this
year’s Oscar nominations, earning 13 nods in an announcement on Thursday
postponed by the devastating Los Angeles wildfires.</p>
<p>French director Jacques Audiard’s Mexico-set musical, released by
Netflix, shattered the record for the most Academy Award nominations for
a non-English-language movie.</p>
<p>It was followed by epic immigrant saga “The Brutalist” and
show-stopping musical adaptation “Wicked,” which each picked up 10
nominations.</p>
<p>Bob Dylan biopic “A Complete Unknown” and Vatican thriller “Conclave”
bagged eight nods apiece.</p>
<p>Voting deadlines had to be extended this month, as Los Angeles — the
home city of the Academy Awards — was devastated by multiple blazes that
have killed more than two dozen people and forced tens of thousands to
flee.</p>
<p>Nominees were unveiled in subdued circumstances, as a town that
typically fixates on the Oscars race was instead fixated on new fires
burning north of the city.</p>
<p>Even so, the glitzy Oscars ceremony itself is still set for March 2,
and the stars and studios who have spent months and millions of dollars
campaigning learned if they have made the coveted final shortlists.</p>
<p>“Emilia Perez,” in which a narco boss transitions to life as a woman
and turns her back on crime, picked up nods for best picture, best
director and best international film, as well as multiple song, score
and sound nods.</p>
<p>Its star, Karla Sofia Gascon, became the first openly trans acting
nominee in best actress, and Zoe Saldana was nominated for best
supporting actress.</p>
<p>Their more famous co-star, Selena Gomez, who has been criticized for
her Spanish-language dialogue, missed out.</p>
<p>Even so, the Netflix film easily surpassed the most nominated
non-English-language movie ever — a record previously held by “Crouching
Tiger, Hidden Dragon” and “Roma,” each with 10.</p>
<p>In best actor, firm favorite Adrien Brody was nominated for “The
Brutalist” along with Timothee Chalamet (“A Complete Unknown”), Ralph
Fiennes (“Conclave”) and Colman Domingo (“Sing Sing”).</p>
<p>But in an unexpected pick sure to ruffle a few feathers in the new
White House, the fifth and final spot went to Sebastian Stan, for his
unsettling transformation into a young Donald Trump in “The Apprentice.”
The movie drew threats of lawsuits from Trump’s attorneys, particularly
for a scene in which the new U.S. president is shown raping his
wife.</p>
<p>In arguably the morning’s biggest surprise, Jeremy Strong, who plays
the youthful Trump’s sinister mentor Roy Cohn, was also nominated in his
supporting role.</p>
<p>He edged out the likes of Denzel Washington (“Gladiator II”).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in an intense race for best actress, A-listers Angelina
Jolie and Nicole Kidman — who went all-out with their performances in
“Maria” and “Babygirl,” respectively — missed out entirely.</p>
<p>Instead, comeback queen Demi Moore, who charmed the industry with her
Golden Globes acceptance speech for body horror-satire “The Substance,”
was nominated and is seen as the favorite.</p>
<p>Her rivals include Gascon, “Anora” star Mikey Madison, “Wicked” lead
Cynthia Erivo and Brazil’s Fernanda Torres for “I’m Still Here.”</p>

Vought Makes a Power Play for Trump’s Energy Policy</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-23, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTgxNzUwMS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3MzQ3NTYxMn0.n4iH3l_nt3Y91Jv5tBuwCEMbjb6XgySgG1ZjZvp-yUM/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C1"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
When Donald Trump has talked about his new administration’s energy
policy leaders, he has focused, so far, on a specific type of person.
</p>
<p>
You might call them energy insiders. At the highest level, they include
Doug Burgum, the former North Dakota governor and incoming interior
secretary, and Chris Wright, the fracking executive and incoming energy
secretary. Both soon-to-be officials know a lot about how the energy
industry works, and they hold
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/chris-wright-mind" target="_self"><u>beliefs</u></a>
about energy development that — while far from aligned with the climate
policy mainstream — are directionally in agreement with many in the
fossil fuel industry itself.
</p>
<p>
But based on a close reading of Trump’s initial executive orders, they
are not the only officials who will wield power in the Trump
administration. Instead, crucial energy policy will be decided in part
by a small number of individuals who have no special insight into the
energy industry, but who do have various dogmatic ideas about how the
government and the economy should work. The most powerful of this second
group is Russ Vought, a lead author of Project 2025 and the
director-designate of the White House Office of Management and Budget.
</p>
<p>
Trump’s initial orders establish the White House Office of Management
and Budget, known as OMB, as an unmistakable de facto power center for
energy and climate policy in the administration. In clause after clause
of Trump’s orders, energy officials across the federal government are
told to consult with the OMB director before they can make a decision,
rewrite a regulation, or disburse funding.
</p>
<p>
Even in more constrained presidencies, OMB has been a
<a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R47089" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>particularly
powerful</u></a> agency. As the largest office in the White House, OMB
is in charge of writing the president’s annual budget proposal and
working with Congress on legislation; one of its suboffices, the Office
of Information and Regulation, approves new federal rules before they
are finalized.
</p>
<p>
Vought’s vision for the agency
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/15/business/russell-vought-budget-office-confirmation-hearing.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>goes
far beyond those traditional lines</u></a>, though. He believes that OMB
can play a role in curtailing the size of the federal government and
firing reams of civil servants. He argues that the White House can claw
back funding that has been appropriated by Congress, even though the
Constitution gives control over “the power of the purse” to Congress
alone.
</p>
<p>
Trump’s executive orders suggest that Vought’s OMB will seek to uproot
existing energy policy — and that some of his earliest attempts at
freezing congressional spending may affect the climate.
</p>
<p>
A provision in Trump’s
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>“Unleashing
American Energy”</u></a> executive order, signed hours after his
inauguration, pauses all funding tied to the Inflation Reduction Act or
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law until Vought personally approves of it.
</p>
<p>
This provision appeared to freeze all funding tied to either law for 90
days, a drastic move that could already violate Congress’s spending
authority under the Constitution. The Impoundment Control Act of 1974, a
federal law that governs this authority, allows the president to pause
funding
<a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-budget/faqs-on-impoundment-presidential-actions-are-constrained-by-long-standing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>for
45 days</u></a>, not 90. (Vought
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/15/business/russell-vought-budget-office-confirmation-hearing.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>believes</u></a>
that this law is “unconstitutional.”)
</p>
<p>
Then it allows Vought and Kevin Hassett, who will lead Trump’s National
Economic Council, discretion over whether that money gets spent. “No
funds identified in this subsection … shall be disbursed by a given
agency until the Director of OMB and Assistant to the President for
Economic Policy have determined that such disbursements are consistent
with any review recommendations they have chosen to adopt,” the order
says.
</p>
<p>
After this order
<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/21/trump-fight-biden-infrastructure-money-00199796" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>threw</u></a>
billions of dollars of federal highway and transportation funding into
question, the White House seemed to
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/01/omb-memo-m-25-11/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>walk
back</u></a> some of the policy Tuesday, clarifying that it only sought
to block funding related to what it called President Joe Biden’s “Green
New Deal.” (Even this change still leaves open exactly what funding has
been frozen.)
</p>
<p>
This is not the only place where OMB appears in Trump’s energy orders.
The “Unleashing American Energy” directive requires the head of the
Environmental Protection Administration to reopen a study into whether
carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases are dangerous air pollutants.
</p>
<p>
The EPA first
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/climate-change/endangerment-and-cause-or-contribute-findings-greenhouse-gases-under-section-202a" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>found</u></a>
that greenhouse gases cause climate change — and are therefore dangerous
— in 2009. The first Trump administration didn’t try to overturn this
finding because it is
<a href="https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/evidence/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>scientifically
unimpeachable</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
The same order also says that OMB will soon issue new rules governing
agency actions “when procuring goods and services, making decisions
about leases, and making other arrangements that result in disbursements
of Federal funds.”
</p>
<p>
Missing from the new executive orders is virtually any mention of
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/trump-national-energy-council" target="_self"><u>the
National Energy Council</u></a>, the new Burgum-led entity that Trump
has said he will create in the White House. It’s still unclear what role
this body will play in the Trump administration, but it has been
described as a nerve center for decision-making about all energy policy.
The new array of orders suggest OMB may already be claiming part of that
role.
</p>
<p>
That said, the Interior and Energy secretaries make their own appearance
in the orders. The orders direct the Secretary of the Interior to
investigate what can be done to speed up and grant permits for domestic
mining. And the orders convene the Endangered Species Act’s
<a href="https://www.thefai.org/posts/so-you-want-to-ignore-an-environmental-law" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>so-called
“God squad,”</u></a> a council of agency heads that can override
provisions in the conservation law. The Interior Secretary sits on this
powerful committee.
</p>
<p>
The most significant sign of Wright’s influence, meanwhile, is that
Trump’s declaration of an energy “emergency” calls out energy
technologies that he favors or that his company has invested in,
including geothermal technology and nuclear fission.
</p>
<p>
One possible reason for Wright and Burgum’s absence: Neither has yet
joined the administration officially. Both are likely to be confirmed by
the Senate on Thursday. They might want to talk to their colleague Russ
Vought when they get in the door.

to a new analysis by the think tank Ember</a>. The group found that
natural gas power also declined, cutting total 2024 EU power sector
emissions to below half of their 2007 peak. Renewable energy now makes
up nearly half of EU energy generation, up from about a third in 2019,
when the European Green Deal became law. Another 24% of its power comes
from nuclear, meaning that nearly three-quarters of the EU’s power is
now carbon-free. “Fossil fuels are losing their grip on EU energy,”
Chris Rosslowe, a senior analyst at Ember and lead author of the report
said in a press release.

says US committed to Philippines in call about China’s ‘dangerous’
actions</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio discussed China’s “dangerous
and destabilizing actions in the South China Sea” with his Philippine
counterpart on Wednesday and underscored the “ironclad” U.S. defense
commitment to Manila. </p>
<p>“Secretary Rubio conveyed that (China’s) behavior undermines regional
peace and stability and is inconsistent with international law,” the
U.S. State Department said in a statement on the call with Foreign
Minister Enrique Manalo. </p>
<p>The Philippines has been embroiled in wrangles at sea with China in
the past two years and the two countries have faced off regularly around
disputed features in the South China Sea that fall inside Manila’s
exclusive economic zone. </p>
<p>Rubio’s call came after he hosted counterparts from Australia, India
and Japan in the China-focused “Quad” forum on Tuesday, the day after
President Donald Trump returned to the White House. The four recommitted
to working together. </p>
<p>Quad members and the Philippines share concerns about China’s growing
power and analysts said Tuesday’s meeting was designed to signal
continuity in the Indo-Pacific and that countering Beijing would be a
top priority for Trump. </p>
<p>In the call with Manalo, Rubio “underscored the United States’
ironclad commitments to the Philippines” under their Mutual Defense
Treaty and discussed ways to advance security cooperation, expand
economic ties and deepen regional cooperation, the statement said. </p>
<p>China’s foreign ministry said its activities in the waters were
“reasonable, lawful and beyond reproach.” </p>
<p>Speaking at a regular press conference, ministry spokesperson Mao
Ning said the United States was “not a party” to the South China Sea
dispute and had “no right to intervene” in maritime issues between China
and the Philippines. </p>
<p>“Military cooperation between the U.S. and the Philippines should not
undermine China’s sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in the
South China Sea, nor should it be used to endorse the illegal claims of
the Philippines,” Mao said. </p>
<p>The Philippines, a U.S. defense treaty ally, is among the first
countries to engage with the new U.S. administration to discuss critical
security matters, Manila’s defense department said in a statement. </p>
<p>Its defense secretary Gilberto Teodoro and U.S. National Security
Adviser Mike Waltz met at the White House on Thursday to reaffirm the
enduring alliance between their two countries. </p>
<p>Just ahead of Trump’s inauguration, the Philippines and the United
States carried out their fifth set of joint maritime exercises in the
South China Sea since launching the joint activities in 2023. </p>
<p>Security engagements between the allies have soared under Philippine
President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who has moved closer to Washington and
allowed the expansion of military bases that American forces can access,
including facilities facing the democratically governed island of
Taiwan, which China claims as its own. </p>
<p>Visiting the Philippines last week, Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi
Iwaya said a trilateral initiative to boost cooperation launched by
Japan, the U.S. and the Philippines at a summit last year would be
strengthened when the new U.S. administration took over in
Washington.</p>

id="trump-designates-yemens-houthis-as-a-foreign-terrorist-organization">Trump
designates Yemen’s Houthis as a ‘foreign terrorist organization’</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday re-designated
Yemen’s Houthi movement, known formally as Ansar Allah, as a “foreign
terrorist organization,” the White House said.</p>
<p>The move will impose harsher economic penalties than the Biden
administration had applied to the Iran-aligned group in response to its
attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea and against U.S. warships
defending the critical maritime chokepoint.</p>
<p>Proponents of the move say it is overdue, though some experts say it
could have implications for anyone seen as aiding the Houthis, including
some aid organizations.</p>
<p>“The Houthis’ activities threaten the security of American civilians
and personnel in the Middle East, the safety of our closest regional
partners, and the stability of global maritime trade,” the White House
said in a statement.</p>
<p>The Houthis, who control most of Yemen, have carried out more than
100 attacks on ships plying the Red Sea since November 2023, saying they
were acting in solidarity with Palestinians over Israel’s war against
Hamas in Gaza. They have sunk two vessels, seized another and killed at
least four seafarers.</p>
<p>The attacks have disrupted global shipping, forcing firms to re-route
to longer and more expensive journeys around southern Africa for more
than a year.</p>
<p>The group has targeted the southern Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden,
which are joined by the narrow Bab al-Mandab strait, a chokepoint
between the Horn of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>Under the Biden administration, the U.S. military sought to intercept
Houthi attacks to safeguard commercial traffic and waged periodic
strikes to degrade Houthi military capabilities. But it did not target
the group’s leadership.</p>
<p>At the start of his presidential term in 2021, Joe Biden had dropped
Trump’s terrorist designations to address humanitarian concerns inside
Yemen. Confronted with the Red Sea attacks, Biden last year designated
the group as a “Specially Designated Global Terrorist” organization. But
his administration held off on applying the harsher FTO designation.</p>
<p>British charity Oxfam said the move would worsen the suffering of
Yemeni civilians, disrupting vital imports of food, medicine, and
fuel.</p>
<p>“The Trump administration is aware of these consequences but chose to
move forward anyway, and will bear responsibility for the hunger and
disease that will follow,” Oxfam America’s director of peace and
security, Scott Paul, said in a statement.</p>
<p>David Schenker, who was assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern
affairs in the first Trump administration, said Trump’s move on
Wednesday was an obvious, early step to respond to what he described as
one of Iran’s leading proxy forces in the Middle East.</p>
<p>“While the redesignation likely won’t have a positive impact on the
group’s behavior, the measure suggests the new administration is not
looking to induce (or cajole) the Iranians to negotiations through
blandishment,” Schenker told Reuters.</p>
<p>The Trump administration said the U.S. will work with regional
partners to eliminate Houthi capabilities, deprive it of resources “and
thereby end its attacks on U.S. personnel and civilians, U.S. partners,
and maritime shipping in the Red Sea.”</p>
<p>The designation will also trigger a broad review of U.N. partners,
non-governmental organizations and contractors operating in Yemen, the
White House said.</p>
<p>“The President will direct USAID to end its relationship with
entities that have made payments to the Houthis, or which have opposed
international efforts to counter the Houthis while turning a blind eye
towards the Houthis’ terrorism and abuses,” the White House said.</p>
<p>The Houthis in recent days have signaled they were scaling back
attacks in the Red Sea following a multiphase cease fire deal between
Israel and Hamas. Earlier on Wednesday, the group released the crew of
the Galaxy Leader commercial ship more than a year after they seized
their Bahamas-flagged vessel off the Yemeni coast.</p>

battle new southern California wildfire</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Firefighters battled multiple wildfires Thursday in southern
California, including a new blaze that erupted a day earlier and
prompted authorities to order more than 30,000 people to evacuate.</p>
<p>The Hughes Fire northwest of the city of Los Angeles became the
latest focus for fire crews Wednesday as it swelled to burn an area of
more than 41 square kilometers near the Lake Castaic recreation
area.</p>
<p>The fire was about 14% contained early Thursday as forecasters warned
of another day of dry and windy conditions that could make it difficult
to keep fires from spreading. </p>
<p>There is a chance for some relief in the coming days with the
National Weather Service saying some rain is expected in the area
beginning Saturday.</p>
<p>Forecasters said they expect up to a centimeter of rain across much
of the Los Angeles area, while localized thunderstorms could bring even
more rain in limited locations. The potential for those storms has
prompted concerns about the possibility of mudslides with debris flowing
down hilly areas that have been scorched by several weeks of
wildfires.</p>
<p>In addition to the Hughes Fire, crews are still battling the
Palisades Fire on the western side of Los Angeles and the Eaton Fire in
the foothills to the north of the city. </p>
<p>The fires that broke out in Southern California on Jan. 7 have killed
at least 28 people and destroyed thousands of buildings. The death toll
is expected to climb as emergency workers comb through the ashes.</p>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump, who has been critical of the response to
the fire, is expected to travel to Los Angeles this week.</p>

<h2 id="europe-posts-record-year-for-clean-energy">Europe posts record
year for clean energy</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A record 47% of the European Union’s electricity now comes from solar
and other renewables, a report Thursday said, in yet another sign of the
growing gap between the bloc’s push for clean energy and the new U.S.
administration’s pursuit of more fossil fuels.</p>
<p>Nearly three-quarters of the EU’s electricity doesn’t emit
planet-warming gases into the air — with another 24% of electricity in
the bloc coming from nuclear power, a report released by the climate
energy think tank Ember found. This is far higher than in countries like
the United States and China, where nearly two-thirds of their energy is
still produced from carbon-polluting fossil fuels like coal, oil and
gas.</p>
<p>Experts say they’re encouraged by Europe’s fossil fuel reductions,
particularly as the U.S. looks set to increase its emissions as its new
president pledges cheaper gas prices, has halted leases for wind
projects and pledged to revoke Biden-era incentives for electric
vehicles.</p>
<p>“Fossil fuels are losing their grip on EU energy,” said Chris
Rosslowe, an energy expert at Ember. In 2024, solar power generated 11%
of EU electricity, overtaking coal which fell below 10% for the first
time. Clean wind power generated more electricity than gas for the
second year in a row.</p>
<p>2024 data wasn’t available for all countries. Ember’s data for the
world’s largest generators of electricity for 2023 show Brazil with the
largest share of its electricity from renewables, almost 89%, with much
of that coming from hydroelectric power. Canada had about 66.5%, China
30.6%, France 26.5%, the U.S. 22.7% and India 19.5%.</p>
<p>One reason for Europe’s clean power transition moving at pace is the
European Green Deal, an ambitious policy passed in 2019 that paved the
way for climate laws to be updated. As a result of the deal, the EU made
their targets more ambitious, aiming to cut 55% of the region’s
emissions by the end of the decade. The policy also aims to make Europe
climate neutral — reducing the amount of additional emissions in the air
to practically zero — by 2050.</p>
<p>Hundreds of regulations and directives in European countries to
incentivize investment in clean energy and reduce carbon pollution have
been passed or are in the process of being ratified across Europe.</p>
<p>“At the start of the Deal, renewables were a third and fossil fuels
accounted for 39% of Europe’s electricity,” Rosslowe said. “Now fossils
generate only 29% and wind and solar have been driving the clean energy
transition.” The amount of electricity generated by nuclear energy has
remained relatively stable in the bloc.</p>
<p>Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has also spurred the move to clean
energy in Europe. Gas prices skyrocketed — with much of Europe’s gas
coming from Russia becoming unviable — forcing countries to look for
cheaper, cleaner alternatives. Portugal, Netherlands and Estonia
witnessed the highest increase in clean power in the last five
years.</p>
<p>The transition to clean power helped Europe avoid more than $61
billion worth of fossil fuel imports for generating electricity since
2019.</p>
<p>“This is sending a clear message that their energy needs are going to
be met through clean power, not gas imports,” said Pieter de Pous, a
Brussels-based energy analyst at European think tank E3G. De Pous said
the EU’s origins were “as a community of coal and steel because those
industries were so important,” but it is now rapidly becoming a
“community of solar and wind power, batteries and smart
technologies.”</p>
<p>Nuclear growth in the bloc, meanwhile, has slowed. Across the
European Union, retirements of nuclear plants have outpaced new
construction since around the mid-2000s, according to Global Energy
Monitor.</p>
<p>As President Trump has pulled the United States out of the Paris
Agreement aimed at curbing warming and is pursuing a “drill, baby,
drill” energy policy, Rosslowe said the EU’s leadership in clean power
becomes all the more important. “It’s about increasing European energy
independence, and it’s about showing this climate leadership,” he
said.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said: “Europe will stay the
course, and keep working with all nations that want to protect nature
and stop global warming.”</p>

House passes bill to detain unauthorized migrants accused of certain
crimes</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday gave
final approval to a bill that requires the detainment of unauthorized
migrants accused of theft and violent crimes, marking the first
legislation that President Donald Trump can sign as Congress, with some
bipartisan support, swiftly moved in line with his plans to crackdown on
illegal immigration. </p>
<p>Passage of the Laken Riley Act, which was named after a Georgia
nursing student who was murdered last year by a Venezuelan man, shows
just how sharply the political debate over immigration has shifted to
the right following Trump’s election victory.  </p>
<p>Immigration policy has often been one of the most entrenched issues
in Congress, but a crucial faction of 46 politically vulnerable
Democrats joined Republicans to lift the strict proposal to passage on a
263-156 vote tally. </p>
<p>“For decades, it has been almost impossible for our government to
agree on solutions for the problems at our border and within our
country,” said Senator Katie Britt, an Alabama Republican. She called
the legislation “perhaps the most significant immigration enforcement
bill” to be passed by Congress in nearly three decades. </p>
<p>Still, the bill would require a massive ramp up in U.S. Immigration
and Customs Enforcement’s capabilities, but it does not include any new
funding. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Trump has launched a slew of executive orders intended to
seal off the U.S. border with Mexico to immigration and ultimately
deport millions of migrants without permanent legal status in the U.S.
On Wednesday, Trump also canceled refugee resettlement, and his
administration has signaled that it intends to prosecute local law
enforcement officials who do not enforce his new immigration
policies. </p>
<p>Republican congressional leaders have made it clear they intend to
follow suit. Their toughest challenge, however, will be finding a way to
approve the funding to implement Trump’s hardline plans. </p>
<p>“What he’s doing is kickstarting what will ultimately be our
legislative agenda,” said House Speaker Mike Johnson. </p>
<p>House Republicans initially passed the legislation last year with
support from 37 Democrats. It then languished in the
Democratic-controlled Senate. </p>
<p>This year, Republicans, now with control of both congressional
chambers, have made it their top priority. When it came before the
Senate, 12 Democrats voted in favor of passage, and when the House voted
on a version of the bill earlier this month, 48 Democrats supported
it. </p>
<p>“While the bill is not perfect, it sends a clear message that we
think that criminals should be deported,” said Representative Tom
Suozzi, a New York Democrat who has called on his party to support
tougher immigration enforcement. </p>
<p>Under the legislation, federal authorities would be required to
detain any migrant arrested or charged with crimes such as shoplifting.
The scope of the proposal was widened in the Senate to also include
those accused of assaulting a police officer or crimes that injure or
kill someone. </p>
<p>The bill also gives legal standing to state attorneys general to sue
the federal government for harm caused by federal immigration decisions.
That gives states new power in setting immigration policy at a time when
they have been trying to push back against presidential decisions under
both the Trump and Biden administrations. </p>
<p>Ultimately, even the Trump administration is likely to struggle to
implement the new requirements unless Congress follows up later this
year with funding. Republicans are strategizing how to push their
priorities through Congress using a party-line process known as budget
reconciliation. They have put the cost of funding Trump’s border and
deportation priorities at roughly $100 billion. </p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security has estimated the Laken Riley Act
would cost $26.9 billion in the first year to implement, including an
increase of 110,000 ICE detention beds. </p>
<p>Most Democrats criticized the lack of funding in the bill as proof
that it is a piecemeal approach that would do little to fix problems in
the immigration system and saddle federal authorities with new
requirements. </p>
<p>“The bill’s authors claimed it’s going to result in the arrest and
detention of serious criminals, but it will not do that because it’s a
totally unfunded mandate,” said Democratic Senator Chris Murphy. </p>
<p>Others raised concerns that the bill would strip due process rights
for migrants, including minors or recipients of the Deferred Action for
Unaccompanied Minors program. Senator Alex Padilla, a Democrat, said
that federal authorities would now be forced to prioritize detention of
migrants arrested for low-level crimes like shoplifting, rather than
those who commit violent felonies. </p>
<p>On the whole, there is no evidence that immigrants are more prone to
violent crime. </p>
<p>Several studies have found immigrants commit crimes at lower rates
than those born in the U.S. Groups that advocate for restrictive
immigration policies dispute or dismiss those findings.</p>

id="beijings-lack-of-clarity-about-rubio-sanctions-sparks-speculation-in-china">Beijing’s
lack of clarity about Rubio sanctions sparks speculation in China</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Beijing’s lack of clarity about whether it will lift
sanctions previously placed on Marco Rubio — the new U.S. secretary of
state and a China hawk — has sparked speculation on Chinese social media
about whether Rubio will become the first American diplomat in his
position who can’t visit China.</p>
<p>On Baidu, China’s most popular search engine, sitting atop the
trending chart Tuesday night was the question, “Will China remove
sanctions on the new U.S. Secretary of State?” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>On Weibo, China’s microblogging site similar to X, netizens wonder if
Rubio will become the first U.S. secretary of state who won’t be able to
come to China. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“This guy has been barred from entering China, let alone visiting
China,” one Weibo user commented. “It’s now a question how he will be
able to deal with China.” </p>
<p>Tough on China</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rubio, the first Cabinet member of the second Trump administration to
be confirmed by the Senate, was sworn in Tuesday. He was one of the
toughest congressional lawmakers on China during his 14-year tenure as a
senator. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rubio introduced bills, made statements and worked with rights groups
that were highly critical of China’s human rights record and growing
influence around the world. A Chinese state media article once called
him “one of America’s most radical anti-China politicians.”</p>
<p>In 2020, within a month, the Chinese government sanctioned Rubio
twice.</p>
<p>The first was announced in July of that year as part of the
retaliation against the U.S. government’s sanctions against a Chinese
government department and four officials in Xinjiang for human rights
violations alleged to have taken place in the region. The second one was
announced in August after Washington sanctioned 11 Chinese and Hong Kong
officials. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I don’t want to be paranoid, but I am starting to think they don’t
like me,” Rubio tweeted sarcastically back then after learning about the
sanctions. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>During his confirmation hearing last week, Rubio reaffirmed his
position on China, asserting that China remains the “biggest threat” to
the United States in the 21st century. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“If we don’t change course, we are going to live in the world where
much of what matters to us on a daily basis from our security to our
health will be dependent on whether the Chinese allow us to have it or
not,” he said during the hearing. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>On China’s heavily censored internet, most of the comments on his
swearing-in have been negative. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In a proposed Cabinet lineup that includes candidates who are
controversial, Rubio stands out as one with bipartisan support. He
received a unanimous 99 confirmation votes.</p>
<p>Experts say that how Rubio approaches China will depend largely on
President Donald Trump. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Rubio has a long history of working on China. But everyone in the
Cabinet is loyal to Trump. I do think Trump will be the ultimate
decision maker on China,” Yun Sun, a senior fellow and co-director of
the East Asia Program and director of the China Program at the Stimson
Center, told VOA Mandarin.</p>
<p>“Any China policy will be a balance of issues to reach what Trump
defines as American national interests. Hawkish views and friendly views
will both be a part of the deal,” she said. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Necessary to ‘maintain contact’</p>
<p>In his new role, Rubio has put Beijing in a peculiar position. The
Chinese government has not publicly sent a clear signal regarding
questions about whether it will lift sanctions on him to allow him to
visit. </p>
<p>When asked if China would drop the sanctions, Guo Jiakun, a
spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry, said Tuesday at the daily
press conference, “China will firmly defend national interests. In the
meantime, it’s necessary for high-level Chinese and American officials
to maintain contact in an appropriate way.”</p>
<p>Recent online speculation about Rubio has evolved since social media
users noticed the Chinese government ostensibly changed its translation
of Rubio’s name. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Claims circulated that Beijing changed the translation so that it
could lift sanctions on Rubio without looking embarrassed, because now
China can say the sanctions were aimed at a different person than
Rubio. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>But the so-called new translation isn’t new at all. The first
translation has been the most widely used for Rubio in Chinese
government documents and media. However, as early as 2019, People’s
Daily, Beijing’s flagship state media outlet and a mouthpiece of the
Chinese Communist Party, used the second translation to refer to Rubio
in an attack article. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Transcripts from China’s foreign ministry also show that when the two
sanctions on him were unveiled in 2020, Rubio was referred to by a third
variation of his name. </p>
<p>The speculation garnered so much attention that Mao Ning, a
spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry, was asked about it on
Wednesday at a press conference. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I am not yet aware of what you mentioned,” she said. </p>

id="trump-signals-aggressive-stance-as-us-races-china-in-ai-development">Trump
signals aggressive stance as US races China in AI development</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Before he had been in office for 48 hours, President Donald Trump
sent a clear signal that to outpace China, his administration will be
pursuing an aggressive agenda when it comes to pushing the United States
forward on the development of artificial intelligence and the
infrastructure that powers it.</p>
<p>On his first day in office, Trump rescinded an executive order signed
in 2023 by former President Joe Biden that sought to place some
guardrails around the development of more and more powerful generative
AI tools and to create other protections for privacy, civil rights and
national security.</p>
<p>The following day, Trump met with the leaders of several leading
technology firms, including Sam Altman, CEO of Open AI; Larry Ellison,
chairman of Oracle; and Masayoshi Son, CEO of SoftBank, to announce a
$500 billion private sector investment in AI infrastructure known as
Stargate.</p>
<p>“Beginning immediately, Stargate will be building the physical and
virtual infrastructure to power the next generation of advancements in
AI, and this will include the construction of colossal data centers,”
Trump said in a media event at the White House on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Specifically, Stargate will invest in the creation of as many as 10
huge data centers in the United States that will provide the computing
for artificial intelligence systems. The first data center is already
under construction in Texas. The massive private sector investment will
create up to 100,000 U.S. jobs, the executives said.</p>
<p>Keeping AI in the US</p>
<p>“What we want to do is, we want to keep it in this country,” Trump
said. “China is a competitor, and others are competitors. We want it to
be in this country, and we’re making it available. I’m going to help a
lot through emergency declarations, because we have an emergency. We
have to get this stuff built.”</p>
<p>The assembled tech leaders took the opportunity to praise the new
president.</p>
<p>“I think this will be the most important project of this era,” Altman
said. “We wouldn’t be able to do this without you, Mr. President.”</p>
<p>Janet Egan, a senior fellow in the technology and national security
program at the Center for a New American Security, said that all the
signals Trump is sending indicate he is serious about maintaining the
United States’ current advantages in the development of advanced AI.</p>
<p>“I think this shows that he’s going to have a really clear mind as to
how to partner closely with the private sector to enable them to speed
up and run fast,” Egan said. “We’ve also seen him take direct action on
some of the bottlenecks that are impeding the development of AI
infrastructure in the U.S., and a particular focus is energy.”</p>
<p>OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, has relied on Microsoft data centers
for its computing. The firm reportedly discussed with the Biden
administration the regulatory hurdles of planning and permitting when
building data centers.</p>
<p>In a policy paper released earlier this month, OpenAI cited the
competition with China, laying out its policy proposals to “extending
America’s global leadership in AI innovation.”</p>
<p>“Chips, data, energy and talent are the keys to winning on AI — and
this is a race America can and must win,” the paper said. “There’s an
estimated $175 billion sitting in global funds awaiting investment in AI
projects, and if the U.S. doesn’t attract those funds, they will flow to
China-backed projects — strengthening the Chinese Communist Party’s
global influence.”</p>
<p>Patrick Hedger, director of policy at NetChoice, a technology trade
association, told VOA that the Stargate announcement “immediately
signaled to me that private capital is more than willing to come off the
sidelines these days with the new Trump administration.”</p>
<p>As part of his flurry of executive actions on Monday, Trump
eliminated several preexisting executive orders placing limits on fossil
fuel extraction and power generation. In the White House event on
Monday, Trump also noted that AI data centers consume vast amounts of
electricity and said he would be clearing the way for Stargate and other
private companies to invest in new energy generation projects.</p>
<p>China competition</p>
<p>While Trump eliminated many of Biden’s executive orders immediately
on Monday, he does not appear to have taken action against some of the
former president’s other AI-related initiatives. Last year, Biden took
several steps to restrict China’s access to cutting-edge technology
related to AI, specifically, restricting the ability of companies that
sell advanced semiconductors and the machinery used to produce them to
Chinese firms.</p>
<p>On that issue, Egan said, Trump and Biden appear to be on the same
page.</p>
<p>“I think it’s important to also note the continuity in how Trump’s
approaching AI,” she said. “He, too, sees it as a national security risk
and national security imperative. … So, I think we should expect to see
this run-fast approach to AI complemented by continued efforts to
understand and manage emerging risks. Particularly cyber, nuclear,
biological risks, as well as a more muscular approach to export controls
and enforcement.”</p>
<p>Speed and safety</p>
<p>Louis Rosenberg, CEO and chief scientist at Unanimous AI and a
prominent figure in the field for decades, told VOA he thinks there is a
bipartisan consensus that AI needs to be developed speedily but also
responsibly.</p>
<p>“At the highest level, the accelerating risks around frontier AI is
not a partisan issue,” he wrote in an email exchange. “Both parties
realize that significant safeguards will be needed as AI gets
increasingly intelligent and flexible, especially as autonomous AI
agents get released at large scale.”</p>
<p>Rosenberg said the most significant question is how the U.S. can
remain the global leader in AI development while making sure the systems
that are deployed are safe and reliable.</p>
<p>“I suspect the Trump administration will address AI risks by
deploying its own targeted policies that are not as broad as the Biden
executive order was but can address real threats much faster,” he wrote.
“The Biden executive order was very useful in raising the alarm about
AI, but from a practical perspective it did not provide meaningful
protections from the important emerging risks.</p>
<p>“Ultimately we need to find a way to move fast on AI development and
move fast on AI protection. We need speed on both fronts,” Rosenberg
said.</p>

escalates campaign against diversity, threatens private sector
probes</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump escalated his campaign against diversity
programs on Tuesday by pressuring the private sector to join the
initiative and telling government employees in offices administering
such programs they would be placed on paid leave.</p>
<p>On his first day in office, Trump issued a series of executive orders
to end diversity, equity and inclusion programs, which attempt to
promote opportunities for women, ethnic minorities, LGBTQ+ people and
other traditionally underrepresented groups.</p>
<p>Civil rights advocates have argued that such programs are necessary
to address long-standing inequities and structural racism. Trump and his
supporters say DEI programs end up unfairly discriminating against other
Americans and weaken the importance of candidates’ merit in job hiring
or promotion.</p>
<p>In an executive order issued on Tuesday, Trump revoked executive
orders dating as far back as 1965 on environmental actions, equal
employment opportunities and encouragement to federal contractors to
achieve workforce balancing on race, gender and religion.</p>
<p>The 1965 order that was revoked was signed by then-President Lyndon
Johnson to protect the rights of workers employed by federal contractors
and ensure they remained free from discrimination on the basis of race,
color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or national
origin, according to the Labor Department.</p>
<p>The Trump executive order seeks to dissuade private companies that
receive government contracts from using DEI programs and hiring on the
basis of race and sex — what the order called “illegal DEI
discrimination and preferences” — and asks government agencies to
identify private companies that might be subject to civil
investigation.</p>
<p>“As a part of this plan, each agency shall identify up to nine
potential civil compliance investigations of publicly traded
corporations, large non-profit corporations or associations, foundations
with assets of 500 million dollars or more, State and local bar and
medical associations, and institutions of higher education with
endowments over 1 billion dollars,” the order said.</p>
<p>Full details on how the Trump administration would enforce “civil
compliance investigations” were not immediately available.</p>
<p>The order issued on Tuesday stipulates that federal and
private-sector employment preferences for military veterans could
continue.</p>
<p>The executive order was celebrated by conservative activists and
Republican leaders. It was also met with condemnation from civil rights
leaders who are strategizing how to respond to Trump’s actions.</p>
<p>Reverend Al Sharpton, founder and president of the National Action
Network, formally announced Wednesday the organization and its partners
plan to identify two companies in the next 90 days that will be
boycotted for abandoning DEI pledges. Reuters first reported the
coordinated action ahead of Martin Luther King Jr. Day.</p>
<p>Basil Smikle Jr., a political strategist and policy adviser, said he
was troubled by the Trump administration’s assertion that diversity
programs were “diminishing the importance of individual merit, aptitude,
hard work and determination” because it suggested women and people of
color lacked merit or qualifications.</p>
<p>“There’s this clear effort to hinder, if not erode, the political and
economic power of people of color and women,” Smikle said.</p>
<p>“What it does is opens up the door for more cronyism,” he said.</p>
<p>The White House did not immediately respond to a request from Reuters
to address criticism from civil rights advocates.</p>
<p>Separately, the Trump administration instructed U.S. federal
government departments and agencies to dismantle all DEI programs,
advising employees of such programs that they would be immediately
placed on paid leave.</p>
<p>The government should by the end of business on Wednesday inform
employees of any government offices or units focused exclusively on DEI
that their programs will be shut down and employees placed on leave, the
Office of Personnel Management said in a memorandum.</p>
<p>The Tuesday memo also included a template for agency heads to use,
encouraging federal employees to report alleged attempts by “some in
government to disguise” continued use of DEI programs and initiatives
“by using coded or imprecise language.” A directive, using nearly
identical wording, was distributed Wednesday to staff at various federal
agencies and departments, including the State Department, according to a
memo viewed by Reuters.</p>
<p>Trump also signed a memorandum on Tuesday that ends a Biden
administration initiative to promote diversity in the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA), ordering the FAA administrator to immediately stop
DEI hiring programs, the White House said.</p>
<p>Trump ordered the FAA to conduct a safety review that would replace
any employees who fail to demonstrate their competence.</p>
<p>“President Trump is immediately terminating this illegal and
dangerous program and requiring that all FAA hiring be based solely on
ensuring the safety of airline passengers and overall job excellence,”
the White House said in a fact sheet.</p>

Tice’s mother travels to Syria to search for missing son</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON/DAMASCUS, SYRIA — At a recent press conference in the Four
Seasons Hotel in Syria’s capital, Damascus, Debra Tice made clear that
she would never give up searching for her son, Austin.</p>
<p>A former U.S. Marine-turned-journalist, Austin Tice was detained at a
checkpoint in Syria in 2012. Little has been heard or seen of him since,
but he is believed to have been held in Damascus.</p>
<p>After the Bashar al-Assad government fell in December, U.S. officials
made a few short visits to Syria, but Tice’s family said they had
expected more.</p>
<p>Debra said she had hoped the U.S. government would send an official
search team, but she wasn’t shocked that they didn’t.</p>
<p>“You can’t even believe it. It’s heartbreaking,” she said.</p>
<p>Watch related report by Cristina Caicedo Smit and Liam Scott:</p>
<p>In the weeks after the Islamist militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham —
known as HTS — overthrew the Assad government, hundreds of people were
released from prisons run by the former government.</p>
<p>Scenes of families reuniting had raised hope among the Tice family.
Just days before Assad fell, the family had convened in Washington to
say they had received recent evidence confirming Tice was alive.</p>
<p>At the press conference on Monday, Debra said that she feels
solidarity with the many Syrians who have had a family member
disappear.</p>
<p>These families “understand the pain that we carry every day, that our
families carry, that the nieces and nephews that have never met their
uncles carry,” she said.</p>
<p>“For all the mothers whose sons were disappeared in these dungeons,
our hearts are joined,” she said.</p>
<p>When Roger Carstens, the U.S. hostage envoy for the Biden and first
Trump administration, visited Damascus in late December, he told
reporters that U.S. officials weren’t able to be on the ground for
extended periods of time to search for Tice.</p>
<p>Trump’s new nominee for the hostage envoy position is Adam Boehler,
whose confirmation hearing has yet to be scheduled.</p>
<p>Watch related report by Cristina Caicedo Smit:</p>
<p>On the ground in Syria, the Washington-based nonprofit Hostage Aid
Worldwide has been leading efforts to locate Tice.</p>
<p>Soon after Assad fell, the team began searching former prisons and
buildings, including one that the group’s president, Nizar Zakka,
described as a secret detention center.</p>
<p>The facility was dark and grimy. Like in previous prisons they
inspected, they found documents, but no people.</p>
<p>“We are learning more and more about how the prison systems operate
in Syria, how it was operating, how it was moving, who managed what,”
Zakka told VOA after a search. “It’s going to take time to find
Austin.”</p>
<p>In December, the U.S. State Department announced it was increasing
its award to $10 million for information about Tice’s whereabouts.</p>
<p>“I understand the State Department, that they’re outside of Syria and
they want to feel like they’re doing something,” Zakka said. But the
increased reward has led to an increase in tips with unhelpful
information, he said.</p>
<p>A State Department spokesperson told VOA that efforts to find Tice
remain under way.</p>
<p>“We are working to get U.S. officials into Damascus for additional
trips to help direct the search and will do so as soon as we confirm the
conditions are safe and local authorities can accommodate the visit,”
the spokesperson said in a Thursday statement.</p>
<p>Advocates say it feels as if the search for Tice has fallen on civil
society groups, rather than the U.S. government.</p>
<p>“It definitely feels like that — that they’re standing back at this
time,” according to Bill McCarren, the executive director at the
National Press Club’s Press Freedom Center in Washington.</p>
<p>“There does need to be a more sustained effort,” said McCarren, who
has worked on Tice’s case for years.</p>
<p>In Damascus, Tice’s mother said she was hopeful that the new Trump
administration would help secure her son’s release.</p>
<p>“I have great hope that the Trump administration will sincerely
engage in diligent work to bring Austin home,” she said. “His people
have already reached out to me.”</p>
<p>While visiting the Syrian capital, she also met with Syria’s new de
facto leader Ahmed al-Sharaa.</p>
<p>“It was so wonderful to learn that they are dedicated and determined
to bring home my son,” she said.</p>
<p>But for Zakka of Hostage Aid Worldwide, the Syrian transitional
government is also making it harder for his organization to search for
Tice. Soon after Assad fell, Zakka said his group had a lot of
freedom.</p>
<p>But now, “there’s more restrictions every day,” Zakka said. “It’s
getting difficult.”</p>

Arctic militarization behind Trump’s focus on Greenland</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Nuuk, Greenland — A blizzard whips the Danish, Greenlandic and Faroe
Islands flags above the Joint Arctic Command headquarters overlooking
the harbor of Nuuk, the capital of Greenland.</p>
<p>The small military outpost staffed by around 80 personnel oversees
Danish security for the vast Arctic island of some 2.1 million square
kilometers.</p>
<p>Greenland’s government is largely autonomous, but the island is part
of the Danish Kingdom, and Denmark retains responsibility for its
security.</p>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump has made clear his determination to take
ownership of the island for the United States and hasn’t ruled out using
economic or military force.</p>
<p>Speaking hours after his inauguration, Trump reiterated his view that
U.S. control was necessary for “international security” because, he
explained, “You have Russian boats all over the place. You have China
boats all over the place, warships. And [Denmark] can’t maintain
it.”</p>
<p>Russian missiles</p>
<p>The United States has long viewed Greenland as vitally important for
its defense, explained Marc Jacobsen, an analyst at the Royal Danish
Defense College in Copenhagen.</p>
<p>“There’s no doubt that it’s geostrategically important in defending
the U.S. national security against Russian missiles,” Jacobsen told VOA.
“The shortest route for Russian missiles towards the U.S. is via the
North Pole, via Greenland.”</p>
<p>Russia has invested heavily in its Arctic military footprint in
recent years. Its northernmost Nagurskoye air base on Siberia’s northern
coast hosts nuclear-capable strategic bombers, missile and surveillance
systems.</p>
<p>Russian nuclear submarines patrol the Arctic seas, while a growing
fleet of nuclear-powered ice breakers projects Kremlin power across the
region.</p>
<p>China and Russia have conducted joint military drills in the Arctic.
Beijing is also seeking access to valuable minerals beneath the ice.</p>
<p>“There is definitely a threat, especially from Russian military
capacities in that region. And NATO countries are right now moving to
increase their capacity,” Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen, also of the Royal
Danish Defense College, told VOA.</p>
<p>Denmark’s defense</p>
<p>Denmark’s military capabilities on Greenland consist of four aging
naval patrol vessels, a surveillance plane and dog sled patrols.</p>
<p>Copenhagen announced plans last month to invest in new surveillance
drones, two new ships and additional personnel, along with upgrading an
existing air base to accommodate F-35 fighter jets. The exact cost has
yet to be decided, but the government said it would spend a
“double-digit billion amount” in Danish kroner, or at least $1.5
billion.</p>
<p>Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen admitted, however, that the
government has failed to invest in Greenland’s security.</p>
<p>“We have neglected for many years to make the necessary investments
in our ships, in the aircraft that will help to monitor our kingdom, and
that is what we are now trying to do something about,” he told reporters
on Jan. 9.</p>
<p>“We will hopefully create an investment package where we will
strengthen our ability to monitor what is happening in the Arctic, and
also for some new capacities to be put into place.”</p>
<p>Denmark hopes the upgrades will go toward “meeting American demands
for increasing the surveillance of Greenland,” Jacobsen said.</p>
<p>US Space base</p>
<p>The U.S. military has been present in Greenland since World War II,
when American forces were deployed to the island following Denmark’s
fall to Nazi Germany. At the height of the U.S. deployment, Greenland
hosted more than 10,000 U.S. service personnel.</p>
<p>The Pituffik Space Base on Greenland’s northwest coast, formerly
known as the Thule Air Base, is the United States’ northernmost military
facility. It now hosts around 200 military personnel, alongside missile
warning, defense and space surveillance systems.</p>
<p>“The military protection of Greenland de facto relies on the U.S.,”
Rahbek-Clemmensen said. “And the big question is then whether the U.S.
wants to enhance that presence, perhaps to be able to do other types of
military operations in that area.”</p>
<p>That may be why, he added, Danish officials appear to be approaching
the issue in a manner that maintains good U.S. relations.</p>
<p>“The Danish government has been trying to touch on that word
‘control’ that Trump uses, which is a very ambiguous term,” he added.
“What does control mean? Does it mean owning a piece of territory? Or
does it mean having a certain amount of military equipment on that
territory?”</p>
<p>US-Danish relations</p>
<p>At Denmark’s Arctic command center in Nuuk, the U.S. flag flies
alongside the Danish, Greenlandic and Faroe Islands colors. The building
also hosts the U.S. Consulate — a sign that, for the time being,
U.S.-Danish relations remain cordial.</p>
<p>Before Trump’s inauguration, the U.S. Embassy in Copenhagen said
there were no plans to expand U.S. military presence in Greenland.</p>
<p>That could change under the new president.</p>
<p>For now, Denmark and its European allies are hoping that Trump’s
comments are part of a strategy to force NATO allies to spend more on
defense.</p>
<p>“There’s an important element which is about his personality, which
he brings into the way that U.S. diplomacy, or his diplomacy, is carried
out,” Jacobsen said.</p>
<p>“In a positive light, if the USA increases its presence in the
Arctic, it will increase the NATO presence, because the seven Arctic
states — besides Russia — we are all members of NATO now.”</p>

out in beleaguered Los Angeles County.
</p>
<p>
The Hughes Fire ignited Wednesday around 11 a.m. PT to the north of
Santa Clarita and has
<a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2025/1/22/hughes-fire" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>already
billowed to nearly 9,500 acres</u></a>, buffeted by winds of 20 to 25
miles per hour with sustained gusts up to 40 miles per hour, Lisa
Phillips, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service, told me. The
area had been under a red-flag warning that started Sunday evening and
now extends through Thursday night. “There are super dry conditions,
critically dry fuel — that’s the basic formula for red flag conditions,”
Phillips said. “So it’s definitely meeting criteria.”
</p>
<p>
This early in a new fire, the situation is dangerously fluid. The Hughes
Fire is 0% contained and spreading swiftly as firefighters attempt to
contain it through an aerial flame-suppression barrage that has
diminishing returns once the winds grow stronger and begin to blow the

id="trump-administration-freezes-many-health-agency-reports-online-posts">Trump
administration freezes many health agency reports, online posts</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The Trump administration has put a freeze on many federal health
agency communications with the public through at least the end of the
month. </p>
<p>In a memo obtained by The Associated Press, acting Secretary of the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Dorothy Fink told agency
staff leaders Tuesday that an “immediate pause” had been ordered on —
among other things — regulations, guidance, announcements, press
releases, social media posts and website posts until such communications
had been approved by a political appointee. </p>
<p>The pause also applies to anything intended to be published in the
Federal Register, where the executive branch communicates rules and
regulations, and the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, a Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention scientific publication. </p>
<p>The pause is in effect through February 1, the memo said. Agencies
subject to the HHS directive include the CDC, the National Institutes of
Health and the Food and Drug Administration — entities that fight
epidemics, protect the nation’s food supply, and search for cures to
diseases. </p>
<p>HHS officials did not respond to requests for comment on the pause,
which was first reported by The Washington Post. Four federal health
officials speaking on condition of anonymity because they weren’t
authorized to discuss the issue confirmed the communication pause to the
AP. </p>
<p>A former HHS official said Wednesday that it’s not unusual for
incoming administrations to pause agency communications for review. But
typically, officials working on the president’s transition team have the
process for issuing documents running smoothly by inauguration day. </p>
<p>“The executive branch is a hierarchy,” said Steven Grossman, who now
consults for food and drug companies, in an email. “Whether stated
publicly or not, every new administration wants important commitments
and positions to wait until new teams are in place and some semblance of
hierarchy restored.” </p>
<p>A pause is reasonable as a changing executive branch takes steps to
become coordinated, said Dr. Ali Khan, a former CDC outbreak
investigator who is now dean of the University of Nebraska’s public
health college. </p>
<p>“The only concern would be is if this is a prelude to going back to a
prior approach of silencing the agencies around a political narrative,”
he added. </p>
<p>During his first term, President Donald Trump’s political appointees
tried to gain control over the CDC’s MMWR journal, which had published
information about the COVID-19 pandemic that conflicted with messaging
from the White House. </p>
<p>Fink wrote in her memo that some exceptions would be made for
communications affecting “critical health, safety, environmental,
financial or nation security functions,” but that those would be subject
to review. The FDA on Tuesday and Wednesday posted notices about warning
letters sent to companies and a drug safety notice. </p>
<p>A consumer advocacy group said the communications pause could still
threaten public safety. </p>
<p>Americans depend on timely information from the CDC, the FDA and
other agencies to avoid foodborne illnesses and stay aware of other
health issues, said Dr. Peter Lurie, president of the Center for Science
in the Public Interest. </p>
<p>“When it comes to stopping outbreaks, every second counts,” Lurie
said in a statement. “Confusion around the vaguely worded gag order is
likely to lead to unnecessary delay in publishing urgent public alerts
during active outbreaks.” </p>
<p>He was echoed by Dr. Jeffrey Klausner, a University of Southern
California public health expert. </p>
<p>“Local health officials and doctors depend on the CDC to get disease
updates, timely prevention, testing and treatment guidelines and
information about outbreaks,” Klausner wrote in an email. “Shutting down
public health communication stops a basic function of public health.
Imagine if the government turned off fire sirens or other warning
systems.”</p>

id="trumps-agriculture-secretary-pick-led-group-opposed-to-ethanol-farm-subsidies">Trump’s
agriculture secretary pick led group opposed to ethanol, farm
subsidies</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>President Donald Trump’s pick to run the Agriculture Department,
Brooke Rollins, led an organization that opposed ethanol mandates and
farm subsidies, major programs she could influence if confirmed,
according to a Reuters review of the group’s policy statements.</p>
<p>That background may put Rollins at odds with farm state lawmakers at
her nomination hearing on Thursday and revive concerns in the powerful
corn and biofuel lobbies about Trump’s mixed record on ethanol during
his first term in office.</p>
<p>“The hearing is a perfect occasion to renounce the misleading and
demonstrably false statements made about ethanol by some of her
colleagues more than a decade ago,” said Geoff Cooper, president and CEO
of the Renewable Fuels Association, an ethanol trade group.</p>
<p>Rollins was president and CEO of the Texas Public Policy Foundation
from 2003 to 2018, during which time the oil industry-backed nonprofit
argued that government support for ethanol contributed to higher
emissions and rising food and fuel prices.</p>
<p>The oil industry has seen ethanol as a threat to its share in the
gasoline market. It says a federal mandate requiring the biofuel to be
blended into the nation’s fuel supply costs it a fortune in compliance
costs.</p>
<p>“As a way to save the planet, not many policies are worse than
government-backed ethanol. It’s bad for the economy, bad for the
environment, doesn’t reduce greenhouse gases and has led to rapidly
rising food prices,” said one article published by the Texas group in
2012.</p>
<p>In 2017, Rollins endorsed Kathleen Hartnett White, the longtime
director of the group’s energy program, to serve as Trump’s chair of the
White House’s Council on Environmental Quality. The White House later
withdrew her nomination after a contentious hearing that included
criticism of her ethanol positions from farm state senators.</p>
<p>White had supported a 2008 effort by then-Texas Governor Rick Perry
to partly waive the ethanol blending program, known as the Renewable
Fuel Standard, in the state. The Environmental Protection Agency, which
administers the program, denied Perry’s request.</p>
<p>During Rollins’ tenure, the group also called for the elimination of
farm subsidies in a 2016 report titled The Policymaker’s Guide to
Corporate Welfare.</p>
<p>The report said offering loan guarantees to farmers to start or
expand their operations “introduces distortions into the
marketplace.”</p>
<p>The USDA issues billions of dollars in direct and guaranteed loans
each year to support the domestic farm economy.</p>
<p>Rollins, who served as acting director of the White House Domestic
Policy Council during Trump’s first term, is set to appear before the
Senate Agriculture Committee for her nomination hearing on Thursday.</p>
<p>“Brooke Rollins will work to enact the president’s agenda, and you
can look to President Trump’s past statements of support for biofuels to
understand the administration’s position on this issue,” said Anna
Kelly, a spokesperson for the Trump administration transition team.</p>
<p>During his 2017-21 term, Trump boosted corn-based ethanol by enabling
year-round sales of higher ethanol blends of gasoline, but he also
angered the ethanol industry by expanding the use of waivers exempting
small refiners from the federal blending requirement.</p>
<p>Ethanol trade group Growth Energy said it supported Rollins’
nomination and believed the Trump administration would support the
ethanol industry’s priorities.</p>
<p>During the Biden administration, Rollins led the America First Policy
Institute, a policy organization closely tied to Trump that has
expressed skepticism about climate change.</p>
<p>More than 400 state and national agriculture groups wrote to Senate
Agriculture Committee leaders John Boozman and Amy Klobuchar on January
15 to endorse Rollins.</p>
<p>“Her close working relationship with incoming President Trump will
ensure that agriculture and rural America have a prominent and
influential voice at the table when critical decisions are made in the
White House,” the letter said.</p>

id="trump-revokes-humanitarian-parole-for-migrants-from-4-countries">Trump
revokes humanitarian parole for migrants from 4 countries</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — U.S. President Donald Trump ended on Monday a
humanitarian parole program that benefited Cubans, Nicaraguans,
Venezuelans, and Haitians. </p>
<p>Under the executive order called “Securing Our Borders,” which
outlines various immigration-related actions, President Trump aimed to
take “all appropriate action” to build the border wall, deploying
defense personnel to the southern border, and detain irregular migrants.
It also asks for elimination of certain parole programs. </p>
<p>One such program, the CHNV program (Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua,
Venezuela) allowed up to 30,000 individuals per month from those
countries to enter the United States legally and stay for a period of up
to two years, provided they had a U.S.-based supporter. </p>
<p>As of December 2024, about 531,690 people had entered the country
under that program, according to data from U.S. Customs and Border
Protection. Beneficiaries were required to have a valid passport,
arrange their own travel, and pass national security and public safety
vetting, among other criteria. </p>
<p>The Biden White House announced the CHNV parole program on January 5,
2023. Officials at the time said the initiative was part of the
administration’s efforts to discourage unlawful entries along the U.S.
southern border.  </p>
<p>The program was modeled on the Ukraine program and an earlier
Venezuelan program. </p>
<p>Immediate effects </p>
<p>The executive order took effect immediately. That means that no new
applications will be accepted from individuals seeking to sponsor those
migrants. </p>
<p>Elizabeth Jacobs of the Center for Immigration Studies, a
Washington-based group that advocates restricting immigration to the
U.S., told VOA that those who have received parole already through this
program will likely be allowed to remain in the United States as
parolees until their parole period expires.” </p>
<p>At that time, Jacobs said, those individuals would be “without
status” and at risk of deportation. </p>
<p>Programs like CNHV were a way “Americans have been able to legally
and safely sponsor newcomers in need of refuge to come to the United
States, including Afghan allies,” Nazanin Ash, CEO of Welcome.US, wrote
on their website. </p>
<p>“Those who had parole protection before January 20 will have to seek
immigration status through other means or risk deportation from the
United States,” Cori Alonso-Yoder, told VOA. She is an immigration law
professor at George Washington University. </p>
<p>The executive orders do not indicate that humanitarian parole will be
revoked for current beneficiaries of the program, said Doris Meissner of
the Migration Policy Institute in Washington during a press call on
Tuesday. However, “they certainly will not renew it.” </p>
<p>“So what happens to those people? If they stay in the U.S. once the
two-year period ends, they will, of course, fall into unauthorized
status. They will lose their work authorization and will certainly be
subject to deportation,” she noted. </p>
<p>Other legal options </p>
<p>The program was not a path to U.S. citizenship or permanent
residence. However, according to immigration lawyers, beneficiaries may
be able to adjust their immigration status from temporary parole to a
more permanent one, such as a visa or sponsorship through a U.S.
relative, which can lead to a green card. </p>
<p>Cubans, after a year in the U.S., can apply for permanent residence
under the Cuban Adjustment Act. Venezuelans and Haitians may qualify for
Temporary Protected Status, which provides relief from deportation and
work authorization.</p>
<p>They could also apply for asylum along with Nicaraguans. However,
they must demonstrate a credible fear of persecution in their home
countries based on race, religion, nationality, social group, or
political opinion.</p>

Deceptively Clear</h2>

<p class="drop-caps">
Early last week, the view out my windows had become alluringly clear.
The peaks of the San Gabriel Mountains that had been obscured by a cloud
of smoke from the Eaton Fire that devastated the city of Altadena
reappeared. The campfire smell had blown away — from this part of Los
Angeles, at least. The landscape seemed to say, <em><em>it’s safe to
come outside</em></em>.
</p>
<p>
Looks can be deceiving. One of the first days I ventured outside again,
just to walk the dog down and back up our steep hill, I felt my throat
burn by the time we arrived back at the house. That sensation, plus
having a baby barely more than a year old, led my family to stay locked
in for a few more days.
</p>
<p>
It’s tricky to know when it’s okay to return to the outdoors during an
ongoing wildfire crisis. The area map on
<a href="https://www.watchduty.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Watch
Duty</u></a> looks good: The 800-acre Hurst Fire up near Santa Clarita
has been entirely controlled, and no new major blazes took hold in the
L.A. area despite windy conditions on Monday. As I write this, the
devastating Eaton Fire has now been 89% contained, and the Palisades has
reached 63%. As early as the weekend after the fires started, when I was
helping a family member clear broken tree branches in the San Gabriel
Valley, the fire and its smoke were no longer visible over the horizon.
By now, some residents have been
<a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-01-17/some-residents-allowed-to-return-to-devastated-pacific-palisades-altadena-neighborhoods" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>allowed</u></a>
to return to areas now deemed safe.
</p>
<p>
Still, it may be a while before the traumatizing wildfires burn out
entirely. Until they do, and even after, an undeniable level of
uncertainty comes with every breath we take.
</p>
<p>
In my neighborhood, the Air Quality Index has been remarkably low over
the past week. When consulting my phone’s Weather app and resources such
as IQAir, measurements have been moderate or even good — in fact, better
than the numbers posted on many perfectly normal L.A. days with no
wildfires burning, when haze and smog still cloud the sky. As many
people have discovered during these horrible fires, however, AQI is
<a href="https://laist.com/news/health/air-quality-index-smoke" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>far
from a perfect indicator</u></a> of whether the air outside is okay. It
might suffice on an ordinary morning for telling you whether it’s a good
or bad day to go for a run, but it is not, on its own, able to account
for the toxic soup that burned around L.A.
</p>
<p>
One of the major concerns about these fires that engulfed whole
neighborhoods in Pacific Palisades and Altadena is that our homes, more
than ever before, are
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2025/01/los-angeles-fire-smoke-plastic-toxic/681318/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>full
of plastic</u></a> and other chemicals that become extra dangerous when
burned. While AQI measures everyday problems like small particulate
matter and smog, it doesn’t include pollutants like copper, plastic
compounds, asbestos, and other things that might have gotten into Los
Angeles’ air.
</p>
<p>
To find out exactly what chemicals came out of the Eaton Fire, Caltech
professor Mike Brown (aka
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:edsg22mzbiqbw4i43gecd5ol" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><span
class="citation" data-cites="plutokiller">@plutokiller</span></u></a>,
after his role in the demotion of the former ninth planet)
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/plutokiller.com/post/3lfxkvhkypc2u" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>took
ash from his house</u></a> to campus to measure its chemical
composition. (Note: My day job is at Caltech.) The result: titanium from
new house paint, lead from old house paint, and lots of other heavy
metals. “Treat that ash like it’s toxic folks,” he wrote on BlueSky,
“(because it is).”
</p>
<p>
In and around devastated communities such as Altadena, it’s obvious one
must proceed with extreme caution regarding the ash and the air itself.
In other parts of the city, it’s hard to be sure. Neighbors of ours have
resumed their communal daily dog walk, but with some hesitation about
whether it’s okay to go outside maskless for even 30 minutes. When a
sore throat or a headache comes on, we wonder whether the air is to
blame. Before the fires, my family used to take a nightly dog walk of at
least an hour, which now includes carrying the baby. Since she is too
young to wear a mask, I don’t know when we’ll feel that free again.
</p>
<p>
A small comfort is that, indoors at least, we were ready. Three air
purifiers run round-the-clock in various parts of my house because of
our proximity to a freeway and the general mediocrity of the Los Angeles
air.
</p>
<p>
But, honestly, it sucks to sit inside in a place so beautiful. Winter in
L.A. is gorgeous, full of cool but sunny days perfect for afternoon
walks and hikes in places that would be too sun-drenched and blazing hot
to visit in the summer. This winter, even with some rain finally in the
forecast,
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2025/01/los-angeles-wildfires-nature-trails/681324/'" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>our
hikes are burned</u></a> and our air is uncertain.

id="tiktoks-us-reprieve-comes-as-other-countries-limit-social-media-use">TikTok’s
US reprieve comes as other countries limit social media use</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Singapore — TikTok’s short-lived shutdown in the United States has
opened a wider debate in other countries regarding access to popular
social media platforms by children.</p>
<p>TikTok went dark temporarily Sunday in the U.S. after a new law
banning it went into effect. The law required TikTok’s Chinese-owned
parent company ByteDance to sell the app’s U.S. operation due to
national security concerns over its ties to Beijing.</p>
<p>After his inauguration on Monday, President Donald Trump signed an
executive order halting the ban for 75 days, giving ByteDance additional
time to find a buyer.</p>
<p>The order provides relief to the app’s 170 million American users,
many of them young adults. More than 60% of teenagers in the U.S. ages
13 to 17 use TikTok, with most of them accessing the platform daily,
according to data from the Pew Research Center.</p>
<p>The U.S. is not the only country looking to regulate social media and
other platforms such as online gaming. While the reasons behind the
restrictions vary, a growing number of countries already regulate
technology or are proposing legislation to restrict its use.</p>
<p>In Australia, a high-profile social media ban for young adults under
the age of 16 will take effect at the end of the year, prohibiting them
from creating accounts on TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, X and Snapchat.
The government said the ban was a necessary measure to protect
children.</p>
<p>“Social media is doing harm to our kids, and I’m calling time on it,”
Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told reporters last
November.</p>
<p>Websites like YouTube that do not require an account to view content
will likely be excluded from the ban.</p>
<p>The Australian government said the onus will be on the social media
companies to “take reasonable steps” to prevent children under 16 from
creating accounts on their platforms. Companies that do not comply could
face fines of more than $30 million. Details of how the law will be
enforced remain scarce, with age verification technologies currently
being trialed.</p>
<p>Some young Australian users of the platforms remain skeptical about
how effective a ban will be.</p>
<p>“I think people will manage to find ways around it, maybe by lying
about their age,” 15-year-old Theodore Cagé told VOA.</p>
<p>While Cagé concedes that social media can be a “big distraction from
school,” he is against a blanket ban, favoring more measured approaches
such as limiting screen time or blocking specific content.</p>
<p>“I reckon it definitely should be more targeted, not just a total ban
on everything, because there’s a lot of good stuff out there. It’s not
all bad,” he said.</p>
<p>The impending ban has also raised concerns that some children will be
left isolated.  </p>
<p>“Social media serves as a lifeline for those youth who do not have
supportive homes or local environments. They can find supportive
communities on social media”, Lisa Given, a professor of information
sciences at RMIT University in Melbourne, told VOA.</p>
<p>Australia’s ban will be closely watched, especially by countries in
Asia that are considering their own restrictions for young users.</p>
<p>Indonesia’s communications minister said the Southeast Asian nation
is planning a minimum age for social media use and discussed plans last
week with President Prabowo Subianto. </p>
<p>In neighboring Singapore, teenagers under 18 will be moved to a more
restrictive Teen Accounts on Instagram starting January 21.</p>
<p>The city-state also issued guidelines in schools to limit screen time
for children. Starting March 31, app stores in Singapore will block
children under 12 from downloading apps, including TikTok and
Instagram.</p>
<p>But in the Southeast Asian financial hub, which prides itself on
technological advancements and connectivity, social media still plays a
significant role in the daily lives of young people.</p>
<p>Platforms like Snapchat and Instagram “are pretty important for
engaging in new relationships or finding new friendships,” 17-year-old
Pablo Lane of Singapore told VOA. “It [social media] has had big
benefits for me, just broadening the scope of people I can contact.”</p>
<p>China has gone further than other countries in Asia to control
children’s access to online networks. In 2021, Beijing introduced new
measures restricting children under 18 to just three hours a week.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>And in late 2024, new guidelines from China’s cybersecurity regulator
called for mobile devices to be equipped with a “minors mode” that would
limit screen time for children under 18, including an overnight
curfew.</p>
<p>The setting, which parents can turn off, restricts 16 to 18-year-olds
to two hours of phone use a day, with eight to 16-year-olds allowed just
one hour.</p>
<p>Jeremy Daum, a senior fellow at Yale Law School’s Paul Tsai China
Center, said China is also focused on protecting children from harmful
content online rather than implementing blanket bans.</p>
<p>“They’re really trying, from a number of different angles, to make a
safe web for kids,” he Daum.</p>
<p>Questions remain over whether China’s model could apply
elsewhere.</p>

<h2 id="solar-was-the-biggest-non-loser-of-trumps-first-day">Solar Was
the Biggest Non-Loser of Trump’s First Day</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-22, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTczODgyNS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1NDUzMTY3Mn0.SjK9ty6KCsy6uMIfms8jy_OFWWmXvJ3kZSflJoowZd8/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
President Trump’s first executive actions put the wind industry on ice,
undermined the transition to electric vehicles, and paused funding for
EV chargers. But so far Trump has done little — if anything — to stymie
the country’s fastest growing clean energy technology: solar.
</p>
<p>
This isn’t a huge surprise. On the campaign trail, Trump blasted former
President Biden’s climate and clean energy policies from every angle,
consistently criticising wind energy and promising to “end the EV
mandate.” But any time solar came up, Trump admitted that he kind of,
sort of liked it.
</p>
<p>
“By the way, I’m a big fan of solar,” Trump said at the presidential
debate in September, before complaining about how much land
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-solar-400-500-acres-of-desert-soil" target="_self"><u>solar
farms</u></a> take up. The following month at a roundtable in Miami, he
said “I like, you know, some applications where you have it on a roof or
you have it on something,” before launching into familiar complaints
about land use.
</p>
<p>
This raises the question of whether the president might include solar
farms in his plan to “unleash American energy.” More solar capacity was
added to the grid last year than any other energy source, after all. As
of September, it made up 78% of all new capacity additions. Rooftop
solar is also one of the quickest and most direct ways for consumers to
lower their energy bills, so the technology fits well within Trump’s
agenda to lower energy costs.

The Solar Energy Industries Association did not respond to my email
requesting an interview, but the trade group is evidently trying to make
this case to the new administration. “It’s clear that we will not reach
President Trump’s vision for American energy dominance or technological
innovation without continued solar and energy storage growth,” Abigail
Ross Hopper, the group’s president, said in a statement published after
the inauguration.
</p>
<p>
Solar’s exclusion from Trump’s day one orders might be viewed
optimistically as an implicit endorsement of that position, Harry
Godfrey, a managing director at Advanced Energy United, told me. Other
clues, however, are not so encouraging, he said.
</p>
<p>
For example, in Trump’s
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/declaring-a-national-energy-emergency/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>executive
order declaring an energy emergency</u></a>, he excluded solar from his
definition of “energy” or “energy resources” that will get expedited
approvals. Solar was not mentioned in any of his energy-related actions
on Monday.
</p>
<p>
“If we’re facing a real energy emergency, and we need to address this,
shouldn’t it be an all hands on deck activity?” Godfrey said. “That’s
obviously bigger than just solar,” he added.
</p>
<p>
Godfrey also observed that solar may not have gotten off completely
unscathed. Trump froze all federal funds allocated by the Inflation
Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for 90 days, which
could affect any money remaining in solar-related programs.
</p>
<p>
Naveed Hasan, the vice president of North American strategy for the
solar company Sungrow, told me he’s less worried about the IRA freeze,
as it’s only temporary. “From what I understand, the funds still have to
be spent. They cannot be just completely cut through an executive order
— that’s going to require the reconciliation process, going through
Congress.”
</p>
<p>
It’s likely too early to draw any big conclusions about how solar
development will fare under Trump. It’s unclear whether his
administration or the new Congress want to make changes to the tax
credits available for clean energy, including for solar panels, for
example.
</p>
<p>
The president has also not yet revealed the full extent of his plans to
increase tariffs on goods from China, which could hurt solar’s cost
competitiveness. On Tuesday night, Trump said he was
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/21/economy/tariffs-china-trump-february-first/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>considering
imposing a 10% tariff on Chinese goods</u></a> beginning in February,
which is far below the 60% he promised on the campaign trail, but
doesn’t mean he won’t increase it later. The announcement followed
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/america-first-trade-policy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
memo</u></a> he sent to various agency heads on Monday which included a
directive for the U.S. Trade Representative to “consider potential
additional tariff modifications … particularly with respect to
industrial supply chains and circumvention through third countries.”
</p>
<p>
Then there’s Trump’s plans to ramp up oil and gas production and clear
hurdles for new fossil fuel plants and exports, which could indirectly
hurt the market for solar. “That’s the major concern we have,” Hasan
told me. “I think that could definitely impact the demand for renewable
energy if those fossil fuel projects are considered more economical or
more attractive for financiers.”

order suspending refugee resettlement affects US Afghan allies, says
advocacy group</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — President Trump’s executive order suspending the U.S.
refugee program would affect the resettlement of thousands of Afghans
who helped the U.S. during the war in Afghanistan, an advocacy group
said.</p>
<p>AfghanEvac, a California-based coalition of organizations helping
U.S. Afghan allies to resettle in the U.S., said Monday that the pause
in all refugee resettlements would affect Afghan allies who are awaiting
relocation to the U.S.</p>
<p>“Thousands of Afghan allies who have completed almost all required
steps in the refugee process would be immediately impacted by a refugee
resettlement pause, and thousands more who are currently undergoing
processing would remain in limbo,” AfghanEvac said, in a statement on
its X account.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Monday that
called the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program detrimental to U.S. interests
and suspending it beginning on January 27.</p>
<p>“This order suspends the USRAP until such time as the further entry
into the United States of refugees aligned with the interest of the
United States,” stated the executive order.</p>
<p>It called on the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, in
consultation with the secretary of state, to report to the president
within 90 days if the program “would be in the interests of the United
States.”</p>
<p>The order added that every 90 days, a report would be submitted to
the president until he “determine[s] that resumption of the USRAP is in
the interests of the United States.”</p>
<p>According to Shawn VanDiver, president of AghanEvac, more than
180,000 Afghans were relocated in the U.S. from August 2021, after the
Taliban seized power in Afghanistan, to December 2024.</p>
<p>Thousands of Afghans are still waiting to be relocated to the United
States.</p>
<p>AfghanEvac said that the order would not only have an impact on
at-risk Afghans living in hiding but also on the family members of the
active-duty U.S. troops.</p>
<p>Earlier, Reuters reported that the flights of 1,660 Afghans cleared
by the U.S. government to resettle in the U.S. were canceled.</p>
<p>But the president of AfghanEvac, Shawn VanDiver, said in a post on X
that no flights were canceled.</p>
<p>“To be clear: flights have not yet been canceled for anyone,”
VanDiver said.</p>
<p>Omar Samad, a former Afghan diplomat living in the U.S., told VOA
that the ban is part of a larger package and it will impact Afghans who
are waiting to be relocated to the U.S.</p>
<p>“It is going to be reviewed by the U.S. agencies, and it is possible
that they that the U.S. make an exception for Afghans,” Samad added.</p>
<p>VanDiver said that the coalition of organizations helping Afghans are
working to “secure exemptions for Afghan allies.”</p>

Los Angeles Fires Accelerated the Looming Natural Gas Crisis</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-22, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTY2NjY5OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0OTA3MzMzM30.R6qsxpDAZCuR52FltmKGp2ZweNIcSCN0QSAf2yX5pao/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
The fires that have swept greater Los Angeles over the past two weeks
have shattered long-held assumptions about wildfire risk. Unlike many of
the catastrophic, climate-intensified wildfires that have burned various
swaths of California over the past decade, the Palisades and Eaton fires
have blazed past the wildland-urban interface to devastate a wide
variety of neighborhoods – some of the region’s oldest and some of its
newest; gridded city blocks as well as winding mountainside
subdivisions; apartments, duplexes, and bungalow courts as well as
stand-alone suburban houses.
</p>
<p>
In other words, the places that have burned represent a far wider swath
of the American urban landscape than most burn zones. Likewise,
rebuilding these places is going to raise not only locally-specific
questions of wildfire safety, adaptation, and retreat, but also
universally-applicable questions about energy provision and
decarbonization that every American city will eventually be forced to
confront. In particular, greater Los Angeles’ burned neighborhoods are
already revealing a looming natural gas crisis, decades before most
American cities will face it.
</p>
<p>
In greater Los Angeles’ grim collection of leveled neighborhoods, gas
meters protruding from the rubble serve as stark reminders of the
elaborate buried pipeline network that powered homes and businesses. As
communities begin to rebuild,

resiliency grants</u></a>, and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/inflation-reduction-act-solar-panels-heat-pumps" target="_self"><u>federal
Inflation Reduction Act incentives</u></a> together make it highly
likely that the majority of new structures will go electric, cutting
their dependence on the outmoded and dangerous gas connections that
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/09/us/california-fires-los-angeles/fce858ae-8e1c-5fb0-befa-0a9863ad5028?smid=url-share" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>may
have complicated firefighting efforts</u></a>. This same transition to
all-electric buildings is unfolding more slowly across the rest of the
country, where many residents are just beginning to embrace the ease,
efficiency, and quality of heat pumps and induction stoves, or to
recognize the
<a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2024-05-22/stanford-study-gas-stoves-early-deaths-childhood-asthma" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>health
risks</u></a> of

gas indoors</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
In even the most thoroughly devastated neighborhoods, though, a few
incongruous buildings have survived. As the rebuilding effort reaches
its conclusion, these grizzled veterans will become solitary consumers
of gas in a soon-to-be-electrified landscape. But the cost of
maintaining the branching networks that provide gas won’t shrink along
with the gas customer base. With maintenance costs fixed but revenue
decimated,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/gas-prices-stove-debate" target="_self"><u>the
gas system could begin to crumble</u></a>. Remaining gas users could
<a href="https://woods.stanford.edu/news/getting-zero-emissions-call-unified-energy-planning" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>see
their bills spiral higher</u></a> as greater Los Angeles’ leading gas
utility, SoCalGas, attempts to meet its costs and more customers flee
the system. Worse still, declining revenue could pressure the utility to
cut back on repairs, leading to neglected pipelines that leak, corrode,
and even spark future fires.
</p>
<p>
A version of this crisis will
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/gas-prices-stove-debate" target="_self"><u>come
for every American neighborhood eventually</u></a>. Gas networks only
work economically and safely when costs are shared across a broad user
base. Without coordination, maintaining the gas network in electrifying
neighborhoods will rapidly become an unsustainable risk borne most by
those least able to transition away from gas. The best solution to this
approaching crisis is both bold and simple: act
proactively.<a href="https://woods.stanford.edu/publications/other/costs-building-decarbonization-policy-proposals-california-natural-gas" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
<u>Prune back</u></a> the branching gas pipeline network to protect both
the system as a whole and the burned neighborhoods themselves.
</p>
<p>
Local government, state regulators, and our gas and electric utilities
can together support the transition of burned neighborhoods’ remaining
buildings off of gas so that entire branches of the system can be shut
off, leaving safer and cleaner all-electric neighborhoods in their
place. This is the only way Angelenos can begin to avoid the post-fire
catastrophe of skyrocketing costs and collapsing safety.
</p>
<p>
By removing an entire branch of the gas distribution network, greater
Los Angeles can simultaneously make the electric grid safer and more
resilient. Over the past decade, overhead power lines have become famous
as
<a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-utility-wildfires-20171017-story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>one
of the leading causes of wildfire ignition</u></a> – but burying them
usually imposes an
<a href="https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/industries-and-topics/electrical-energy/infrastructure/electric-reliability/undergrounding-program-description" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>eye-watering
cost</u></a> that the electric system cannot afford. Much of that cost,
though, stems from the need to dig by hand around existing gas lines. By
shutting down their local gas networks for good, burned and
high-fire-risk neighborhoods can eliminate the greatest risk and biggest
expense of burying electric lines – and in some cases, might even be
able to run electric lines
<a href="https://digital.sandiego.edu/jcel/vol15/iss0/3/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>through
the decommissioned pipes</u></a> themselves.
</p>
<p>
In one sweep, greater Los Angeles’ burn zones and high-fire-risk
neighborhoods like them elsewhere can eliminate two major sources of
fire danger and chart a path away from the looming threat of unmanaged
gas system collapse. In the midst of the state’s intensifying
<a href="https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2025/01/16/california-home-insurance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>insurance
crisis</u></a>, systematically reducing the risk of new fires at the
neighborhood level would also offer insurers provable risk mitigation.
Pulling off this transformation, though, will require quick action —
before rebuilding begins. So far, state and local leaders have focused
on promising the return of normalcy, in part by attempting to
<a href="https://mayor.lacity.gov/news/mayor-bass-issues-sweeping-executive-order-clear-way-angelenos-rebuild-their-homes-fast" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>suspend
all-electric building requirements.</u></a> Given that all-electric
construction is both faster and
<a href="https://rmi.org/all-electric-new-homes-a-win-for-the-climate-and-the-economy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>cheaper</u></a>,
this rollback makes little practical sense. At a broader level, these
early rollbacks constitute an attempt to avoid the hard questions of how
to rebuild more
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/los-angeles-fires-zone-zero" target="_self"><u>safely</u></a>
and
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-01-17/california-fast-tracks-rebuilding-of-la-homes-despite-fire-danger" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>resiliently</u></a>
– and when it has become
<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/los-angeles-shouldnt-rebuild-the-same-way-after-wildfires.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>too
dangerous to rebuild at all</u></a>. The win-win of systematic gas
decommissioning and electric undergrounding offers an onramp to those
more difficult conversations.
</p>
<p>
Just how to negotiate an entire neighborhood’s simultaneous transition
away from natural gas remains an unsolved problem of political will and
neighborly cooperation, but greater Los Angeles’ burned zones are
suddenly forcing the question. Creating a clear, affordable path to
electrification for the surviving buildings will require pairing
increased
<a href="https://www.switchison.org/ca" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>financial
support</u></a> with coordinated planning and clear deadlines to help
homeowners and businesses understand the urgency of the switch.
</p>
<p>
Amidst the incalculable losses of these fires, greater Los Angeles is
being confronted not only with the painful challenges of recovery, but
also with the looming specter of new crises accelerated by the fires’
devastation. The risk of gas system collapse has come to greater Los
Angeles decades before it will reach most other American communities.
Confronting it before it becomes a disaster of its own can help secure
the region’s devastated neighborhoods against future fires, while
blazing a trail for other high-fire-risk neighborhoods across the
country to follow.

This extreme winter weather is being driven by the polar vortex, which
is a blob of low-pressure and cold air that circulates around the poles.
As the National Weather Service
<a href="https://www.weather.gov/safety/cold-polar-vortex?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--HOuSpiWPykILd3Y0DbZbYHDM31XgRbH54t2LARBjuO6BTlpi1SdoSsBXD_-osMtfdRRve#:~:text=The%20term%20%22vortex%22%20refers%20to,stream%20(see%20graphic%20above)." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explains</a>,
“many times during winter in the northern hemisphere, the polar vortex
will expand, sending cold air southward with the jet stream.”
Researchers are looking into how human-caused climate change is
affecting the polar vortex. NOAA stratosphere expert Amy Butler
<a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/understanding-arctic-polar-vortex?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--HOuSpiWPykILd3Y0DbZbYHDM31XgRbH54t2LARBjuO6BTlpi1SdoSsBXD_-osMtfdRRve" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>
changes in surface temperature and pressure that result from sea ice
loss could alter the atmospheric waves that bump up against the polar
vortex. “So the idea would be that even though you have an overall
warming trend, you might see an increase in the severity of individual
winter weather events in some locations,” she said.

<p>Firefighters and residents in southern California braced Wednesday
for the possibility of more wildfire activity fueled by dry and strong
winds, while the prospect of some rain in the forecast brought the
potential for some relief from the fire threat but also the dangers of
mudslides in fire-ravaged areas. </p>
<p>The National Weather Service said dangerous fire conditions would
persist in the Los Angeles area through Thursday or Friday. </p>
<p>Forecasters said there was a 60% to 80% chance of rain in the region
starting Saturday, with rainfall totals in most areas not exceeding 8
millimeters. </p>
<p>A chance of thunderstorms bringing locally heavier rainfall has
raised fears of mudslides with debris flowing down hilly areas that have
been scorched by two weeks of wildfires. </p>
<p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said an executive order she signed
Tuesday is designed to curb the flow of toxic debris from the region’s
fires and protect the area’s beaches and oceans.     </p>
<p>“This is to prevent additional damage to areas already ravaged by
fire and also to protect our watershed, beaches and ocean from toxic
runoff,” the mayor said. City workers will remove toxic materials and
set up barriers to direct the flow of debris into the sewer system. </p>
<p>The fires have killed at least 27 people and destroyed thousands of
buildings. </p>

The Los Angeles wildfires have killed at least 27 people, destroyed more
than 17,000 structures, and displaced tens of thousands. In the next few
months, the billions of costs in damage to homes and property will
ripple through the state’s insurance market — and likely cause its
insurer of last resort to run out of money.

Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Jesse Jenkins: </strong>We should have warned you ahead of time
that this podcast always devolves back to the tri-state area. It’s just
sort of inevitable. We saw this dynamic on the Jersey Shore after
Hurricane Sandy, where a lot of more working class-type communities that
had homes there, they ended up either getting wiped out or having to
leave and sell, and moving out. And what replaced them were very large
houses — some of them built in a more secure way, up above the
floodplain on elevated floors. But most of them, as I understand it,
don’t have insurance.<br/> <br/> So they are self insured, in the sense
that people think they’re wealthy enough that they can just absorb the
loss. That’s one type of self insurance. The folks who are coming off
the federal flood insurance plan are probably folks who are not really
self insured. They can’t diversify there. They don’t have enough wealth
to absorb that risk. They’re just simply exposed now and rolling the
dice.<br/> <br/> <strong>Benjamin Keys:</strong> And for the time being,
the cost of flood insurance is still subsidized. And so, you know, even
if you see your rate jump by 18% and you say, <em><em>wow, that’s
expensive</em></em>, it’s going to get substantially worse. And so it’s
a huge mistake to leave that path, and have interrupted flood coverage.
That’s a tough one. And you know, most of the flood policies that are
out there are mandatory. Those are ones that are being required by the
mortgage market that, say, if you live in a flood zone, you have to have
flood insurance.<br/> <br/> So actually, I have flood insurance on my
house in Philadelphia. I live close enough to the Schuylkill River, a
couple of blocks away, that — and my neighborhood did flood just a few
years ago. We fortunately weren’t harmed by it, but that flood insurance
policy is mandated by the mortgage market. And so that’s where most of
the coverage comes from.<br/> <br/> But when you look at the voluntary
take-up of flood insurance, it’s very low.<br/> <br/>
<strong>Jenkins:</strong> Are we likely to see something similar for
wildfire risk? That effectively, insurers say, we’ll continue to write
policies in California, but if you’re in a wildfire prone area, we’re
not going to give you wildfire insurance, which would create a kind of
similar issue.<br/> <br/> <strong>Keys: </strong>It’s possible that we
could see a national wildfire program or a broader national disaster
program develop. The insurance industry would love to carve out these
risks, right? These are very difficult things.

says he would sanction Russia if Putin does not negotiate on
Ukraine</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he would
likely impose sanctions on Russia if its president, Vladimir Putin,
refuses to negotiate about ending the war in Ukraine. </p>
<p>Trump gave no details on possible additional sanctions. The United
States has already sanctioned Russia heavily for its invasion of Ukraine
in February 2022. </p>
<p>Trump said his administration was also looking at the issue of
sending weapons to Ukraine, adding his view that the European Union
should be doing more to support Ukraine. </p>
<p>“We’re talking to [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelenskyy; we’re
going to be talking with President Putin very soon,” Trump said. “We’re
going to look at it.” </p>
<p>Trump said he had pressed Chinese President Xi Jinping in a call to
intervene to stop the Ukraine war. </p>
<p>“He’s not done very much on that. He’s got a lot of … power, like we
have a lot of power. I said, ‘You ought to get it settled.’ We did
discuss it.”</p>

<h2 id="trump-says-eu-in-for-tariffs-warns-of-10-rate-on-china">Trump
says EU ‘in for tariffs,’ warns of 10% rate on China</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump pledged Tuesday to hit the European Union
with tariffs, adding that a 10% duty on Chinese imports could also come
as soon as February 1. </p>
<p>Trump, who was speaking to reporters at the White House a day after
being sworn in, cited the need to rectify the EU’s trade imbalances with
the United States while taking aim once again at Beijing over fentanyl
trafficking. </p>
<p>“They treat us very, very badly. So they’re going to be in for
tariffs,” Trump said of the EU. “You can’t get fairness unless you do
that.” </p>
<p>A day earlier, Trump accused the bloc of not importing enough
American products, saying he would “straighten that out” by imposing
duties or by urging for more oil and gas purchases. </p>
<p>Regarding China, Trump on Tuesday reiterated his threat to impose a
10% tariff, saying it was “based on the fact that they’re sending
fentanyl to Mexico and Canada.” </p>
<p>When asked how soon these tariffs could be enacted, he added:
“Probably February 1st is the date we’re looking at.” </p>
<p>This was the same date he earlier said he could impose 25% tariffs on
Canada and Mexico, accusing them of failing to stop illegal immigration
and fentanyl trafficking into the United States. </p>
<p>Mexico, Canada and China are leading sources for goods imported by
the United States, according to official trade data. </p>
<p>The EU’s economy commissioner vowed this week that the bloc stands
ready to defend its interests. </p>
<p>Speaking at an annual meeting of global elites in Davos, Switzerland,
EU chief Ursula von der Leyen declared that Europe was ready to
negotiate with Trump, while maintaining that Washington remains an
important partner. </p>
<p>The EU’s “first priority will be to engage early, discuss common
interests, and be ready to negotiate” with Trump, she said. </p>
<p>“We will be pragmatic, but we will always stand by our principles, to
protect our interests and uphold our values,” she said. </p>
<p>On Monday, Trump vowed an immediate overhaul of the U.S. trade
system, promising to “tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our
citizens.” </p>
<p>He signed an order directing agencies to study a range of trade
issues including deficits, unfair practices and currency
manipulation. </p>
<p>The investigations could pave the way for further duties.</p>

<h2 id="rare-snowstorm-blankets-houston-and-new-orleans">Rare snowstorm
blankets Houston and New Orleans</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>HOUSTON — A rare winter storm churned across the U.S. Gulf Coast on
Tuesday, breaking snowfall records more than a century old in a southern
region where flurries are unusual, as much of the United States remained
in a dangerous deep freeze.</p>
<p>A snowstorm warning was in effect for 31 million people - from
southern Texas east through Georgia and north to the Carolinas and into
Virginia - until Wednesday morning, the National Weather Service
said.</p>
<p>With the storm moving east, crews near Houston plowed highways on
Tuesday while downtown streets, covered in white, were virtually
deserted.</p>
<p>Schools were closed Tuesday and Wednesday as the city, the
fourth-biggest in the U.S., expected about 10 cm of snow to fall.</p>
<p>“I’ve been in Texas my entire life and I have never seen this depth
of snow,” said Ishan Bhaidani, 29, who owns a fintech consulting company
in Houston. “It typically gets more icy, but this type of fine snow,
this is a first.”</p>
<p>Authorities in Houston investigated two deaths that may be
weather-related, including that of a homeless man who was found near an
apartment complex, the Harris County Sheriff said on X.</p>
<p>Snow was also falling in New Orleans, where nearly 25 cm had
accumulated by late afternoon, according to the National Weather
Service.</p>
<p>Richard Bann, an NWS meteorologist, said that the service was trying
to confirm whether Tuesday’s snowfall broke a New Orleans record set in
1895.</p>
<p>The last time New Orleans received any measurable snowfall was 2009,
according to the NWS.</p>
<p>“Stay home and stay off the roads,” said a bundled-up New Orleans
Mayor LaToya Cantrell, as winds whipped snow in her face, in a video
message to residents on X.</p>
<p>Breaking a 144-year-old record, more than 15 cm of snow fell in
Mobile, Alabama, by late afternoon, according to the NWS.</p>
<p>The storm is expected to crawl through Mississippi, Georgia and
Florida early this week.</p>
<p>The storm snarled air travel with flights delayed or canceled on
Tuesday. More than 1,000 flights departing or bound for Houston’s George
Bush Intercontinental Airport were canceled, according to
Flightaware.com.</p>
<p>Temperatures dipped into single digits Fahrenheit, well below
freezing, across the region. Forecasters and local leaders urged
residents to protect themselves from frostbite and to take steps to keep
their water pipes from rupturing.</p>
<p>Across the South, the snow, combined with an inch of ice accumulation
and wind gusts of up to 64 kph, could make road and air travel difficult
for several days, while threatening to topple power lines and trees,
forecasters said.</p>
<p>About 30,000 homes and businesses in southeastern Texas were without
power at one point on Tuesday, but by late afternoon that number fell to
fewer than 8,000, according to Poweroutage.us.</p>
<p>Atlanta, Georgia, and Montgomery, Alabama, opened warming centers and
closed government offices in anticipation of the storm. Numerous school
districts canceled classes, according to local news.</p>
<p>To the north, most of the eastern two-thirds of the United States
experienced brutally cold temperatures as an Arctic front was expected
to linger through at least Tuesday.</p>
<p>Grand Lake, Colorado, was the coldest spot in the U.S. on Tuesday
morning at -39 C.</p>

<h2 id="trump-highlights-partnership-investing-500b-in-ai">Trump
highlights partnership investing $500B in AI</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Tuesday talked up a joint
venture investing up to $500 billion for infrastructure tied to
artificial intelligence by a new partnership formed by OpenAI, Oracle
and SoftBank. </p>
<p>The new entity, Stargate, will start building data centers and the
electricity generation needed for the further development of the
fast-evolving AI in Texas, according to the White House. The initial
investment is expected to be $100 billion and could reach five times
that sum. </p>
<p>“It’s big money and high quality people,” said Trump, adding that
it’s “a resounding declaration of confidence in America’s potential”
under his new administration. </p>
<p>Joining Trump fresh off his inauguration at the White House were
Masayoshi Son of SoftBank, Sam Altman of OpenAI and Larry Ellison of
Oracle. All three credited Trump for helping to make the project
possible, even though building has started and the project goes back to
2024. </p>
<p>“This will be the most important project of this era,” said Altman,
CEO of OpenAI. </p>
<p>Ellison noted that the data centers are already under construction
with 10 being built so far. The chairman of Oracle suggested that the
project was also tied to digital health records and would make it easier
to treat diseases such as cancer by possibly developing a customized
vaccine. </p>
<p>“This is the beginning of golden age,” said Son, referencing Trump’s
statement that the U.S. would be in a “golden age” with him back in the
White House. </p>
<p>Son, a billionaire based in Japan, committed in December to invest
$100 billion in U.S. projects over the next four years. He previously
committed to $50 billion in new investments ahead of Trump’s first term,
which included a large stake in the troubled office-sharing company
WeWork. </p>
<p>While Trump has seized on similar announcements to show that his
presidency is boosting the economy, there were already expectations of a
massive buildout in data centers and electricity plants needed for the
development of AI, which holds the promise of increasing productivity by
automating work but also the risk of displacing jobs if poorly
implemented. </p>
<p>The initial plans for Stargate go back to the Biden administration.
Tech news outlet The Information first reported on the project in March
2024. OpenAI has long relied on Microsoft data centers to build its AI
systems, but it has increasingly signaled an interest in building its
own data centers. </p>
<p>OpenAI wrote in a letter to the Biden administration’s Commerce
Department last fall that planning and permitting for such projects “can
be lengthy and complex, particularly for energy infrastructure.” </p>
<p>The push to build data centers also predates Trump’s presidency. Last
October, the financial company Blackstone estimated that the U.S. would
see $1 trillion invested in data centers over five years, with another
$1 trillion being committed internationally. </p>
<p>Those estimates for investments suggest that much of the new capital
will go through Stargate as OpenAI has established itself as a sector
leader with the 2022 launch of its ChaptGPT, a chatbot that captivated
the public imagination with its ability to answer complex questions and
perform basic business tasks. </p>
<p>The White House has put an emphasis on making it easier to build out
new electricity generation in anticipation of AI’s expansion, knowing
that the United States is in a competitive race against China to develop
a technology increasingly being adopted by businesses. </p>
<p>Still, the regulatory outlook for AI remains somewhat uncertain as
Trump on Monday overturned the 2023 order signed by then-President Joe
Biden to create safety standards and watermarking of AI-generated
content, among other goals, in hopes of putting guardrails on the
technology’s possible risks to national security and economic
well-being. </p>
<p>Trump supporter Elon Musk, worth more than $400 billion, was an early
investor in OpenAI but has since challenged its move to for-profit
status and has started his own AI company, xAI. Musk is also in charge
of the “Department of Government Efficiency” created formally on Monday
by Trump with the goal of reducing government spending. </p>
<p>Trump previously in January announced a $20 billion investment by
DAMAC Properties in the United Arab Emirates to build data centers tied
to AI.</p>

In his inaugural address, President Donald Trump said he wanted to end
chronic illnesses. The promise is part of the Make America Healthy Again
campaign pushed by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who Trump picked to lead the
Department of Health and Human Services. It’s a powerful slogan. But
experts warn that some of RFK Jr.’s proposals are based on conspiracy
theories and false information instead of actions that could actually
improve Americans’ health, like backing targeted reforms in the food
industry. On the show today, Jessica Knurick, a registered dietitian who
decodes nutrition and public health misinformation, joins the show to
discuss the business of food, what processed foods actually are, how our
food supply became full of them, and why chronic disease
disproportionately impacts low-income communities. Plus, the policy
solutions she would propose to improve Americans’ health.

id="democratic-led-states-sue-to-block-trumps-birthright-citizenship-order">Democratic-led
states sue to block Trump’s birthright citizenship order</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Twenty-two Democratic-led U.S. states sued Tuesday to try to block
President Donald Trump from ending birthright U.S. citizenship for the
children of undocumented migrants living in the country. </p>
<p>The suit by the states, joined by the city governments in Washington,
D.C., and San Francisco, are among the first filed by those opposing
Trump’s executive orders, which he signed in the immediate hours after
his inauguration Monday. </p>
<p>The U.S. Constitution guarantees citizenship to those born in the
country, and court rulings have made only small exceptions, such as
rejecting citizenship for the offspring of foreign diplomats born in the
U.S. Presidents cannot unilaterally change the Constitution, which
instead must be accomplished through large majorities of lawmakers in
Congress or wide state legislative action. </p>
<p>But Trump, as part of his crackdown on 11 million or more
undocumented migrants living in the U.S., signed one executive order
directing U.S. agencies to stop handing citizenship documents to the
offspring of undocumented migrants. </p>
<p>The Republican president’s order directed federal officials, starting
Feb. 19, to not recognize U.S. citizenship for children born in the
United States to mothers who are in the country illegally or are in the
U.S. only temporarily, such as visa holders, and whose fathers are not
citizens or lawful permanent residents. </p>
<p>Trump’s nascent administration is moving quickly to deport such
migrants back to their home countries, even if they have lived in the
U.S. for years, paid taxes and assimilated into American life. Trump’s
immigration agents are first targeting undocumented migrants who have
been convicted of crimes. </p>
<p>New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin said in a statement,
“State attorneys general have been preparing for illegal actions like
[Trump’s no-citizenship edict], and today’s immediate lawsuit sends a
clear message to the Trump administration that we will stand up for our
residents and their basic constitutional rights.” </p>
<p>The White House did not immediately comment on the suits, three of
which were filed in Boston, Massachusetts, and Concord, New Hampshire.
Four states filed a separate lawsuit in Washington. </p>
<p>Democratic-led states and advocacy groups have immediately challenged
two other Trump executive orders, one creating the Department of
Government Efficiency — a nongovernmental advisory panel overseen by
billionaire Trump supporter Elon Musk — and another weakening job
protections for government civil servants to make it easier for the
Trump administration to fire them and replace them with Trump
loyalists. </p>
<p>Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell said that if
Trump’s no-citizenship order is allowed to stand, it would mean more
than 150,000 children born annually in the United States would be denied
the right to citizenship. </p>
<p>“President Trump does not have the authority to take away
constitutional rights,” she said in a statement. </p>
<p>One of the plaintiffs challenging the order is a woman living in
Massachusetts identified only as “O. Doe.” She is in the country through
temporary protected status and is due to give birth in March. </p>
<p>The temporary protected status immigration designation is available
to people whose home countries have experienced natural disasters, armed
conflicts or other extraordinary events and currently covers more than 1
million people from 17 nations. </p>
<p>U.S. birthright citizenship was enshrined in the 14th Amendment to
the U.S. Constitution in the aftermath of the Civil War in the early
1860s and ratified in 1868. It says: “All persons born or naturalized in
the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens
of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.” </p>
<p>Platkin, the New Jersey attorney general, said Tuesday that
presidents might have broad authority, but they are not kings. </p>
<p>“The president cannot, with a stroke of a pen, write the 14th
Amendment out of existence, period,” he said. </p>
<p>Connecticut Attorney General William Tong, a U.S. citizen by
birthright and the nation’s first Chinese American elected attorney
general, said the lawsuit was personal for him. </p>
<p>“The 14th Amendment says what it means, and it means what it says —
if you are born on American soil, you are an American. Period. Full
stop,” he said. “There is no legitimate legal debate on this question.
But the fact that Trump is dead wrong will not prevent him from
inflicting serious harm right now on American families like my
own.” </p>
<p>Chapters of the American Civil Liberties Union in New Hampshire,
Maine and Massachusetts along with other immigrant rights advocates have
also filed suit to block Trump’s action. </p>
<p>Their suit asked a court to rule that Trump’s order is
unconstitutional. It cites the case of a woman identified as “Carmen,”
who is pregnant but is not a U.S. citizen. The lawsuit says she has
lived in the United States for more than 15 years and has a pending visa
application that could lead to permanent resident status. She has no
other immigration status, and the father of her expected child has no
immigration status either, the suit says. </p>
<p>“Stripping children of the ‘priceless treasure’ of citizenship is a
grave injury,” the suit said. “It denies them the full membership in
U.S. society to which they are entitled.” </p>

Press.</p>

id="trumps-un-nominee-touts-peace-through-strength-on-world-stage">Trump’s
UN nominee touts peace through strength on world stage</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>UNITED NATIONS — President Donald Trump’s nominee for U.S. ambassador
to the United Nations told senators at her confirmation hearing Tuesday
that she will promote his doctrine of “peace through strength” on the
world stage if she is confirmed.</p>
<p>“It is imperative to ensure strong American leadership at the United
Nations,” Elise Stefanik told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. “I
share President Trump’s vision of a U.N. reformed by strong America
First peace through strength and return to this founding mission of
promoting peace and security around the world.”</p>
<p>Stefanik, 40, from a rural New York district, has been in Congress
for a decade and has served on national security related committees. As
chair of the Republican Conference since 2021, she is the fourth-ranking
House Republican but will have to step down if she is approved.</p>
<p>She appeared to have bipartisan support, with Democratic legislators
largely posing standard foreign policy questions and avoiding partisan
attacks.</p>
<p>China’s influence</p>
<p>China’s growing influence within the United Nations was at the top of
lawmakers’ concerns.</p>
<p>“China has used its malign influence to block attempts to discuss the
Chinese government-sponsored genocide against the Uyghurs, and they have
blocked our ally Taiwan from fully participating in the U.N.,” committee
chair Jim Risch of Idaho said. He also criticized Beijing for pushing
its nationals into U.N. system jobs to serve its national interests.</p>
<p>Stefanik agreed that Beijing has made “significant inroads” at the
world body and said Washington needs to push back on it with a
“long-term strategy.”</p>
<p>“Working closely with our allies and our partners, both at the most
junior levels and at the more senior levels within the U.N., we need to
make sure that we are running candidates – either American or allied
nations – in the election process for key leadership posts within the
U.N. system,” she said.</p>
<p>Stefanik said efforts should focus on technical organizations such as
the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the International
Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) – both organizations that until
recently had been under the leadership of international civil servants
from China. And she warned that the United States must be vigilant in
protecting its ethical standards related to the use of artificial
intelligence.</p>
<p>The United States is the single largest financial contributor to the
United Nations, and several senators questioned whether U.S. taxpayers
are still getting their money’s worth from the organization. The nominee
said she would seek to do an agency-by-agency audit of what U.S. funds
are spent on and press for reforms including more transparency and
accountability. She also had praise for agencies led by U.S. appointees,
including the World Food Program and the U.N. children’s agency,
UNICEF.</p>
<p>“Stefanik’s remarks signaled that the U.S. is going to be tough on
the U.N., but not walk away from the organization altogether,” said
Richard Gowan, U.N. director for the International Crisis Group. “I
actually think that quite a lot of her lines about the need to ensure
the U.N. offers value for money will play well with other big donors to
the organization, who are keen to control costs.”</p>
<p>One of Trump’s first executive orders on Monday was to notify the
World Health Organization of his intention to withdraw the United States
from the body – and with it the hundreds of millions of dollars it
contributes to WHO’s budget. Stefanik said she supported the move.</p>
<p>“WHO failed on a global stage in the COVID pandemic for all the world
to see,” she said.</p>
<p>Stefanik was most passionate about “our most precious ally” Israel
and defending it from what she called “antisemitic rot” and bias at the
United Nations.</p>
<p>“We need to be a voice of moral clarity on the U.N. Security Council
and at the United Nations at large, for the world to hear the importance
of standing with Israel, and I intend to do that,” she said.</p>
<p>Asked by Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen about her vision for
“the day after” in Gaza, she said Trump is “uniquely positioned” to
bring peace to the region, to eradicate Hamas and Lebanese Hezbollah,
and protect Israel’s national security.</p>
<p>Van Hollen pressed further, asking if she supports the view of
far-right Israeli legislators who say Israel has a biblical right to the
entire West Bank. Stefanik replied “yes.”</p>
<p>Crisis Group’s Gowan said that last comment might fuel “nervousness”
among U.N. members that Trump could endorse an Israeli effort to annex
parts of the Palestinian territories. But overall, he thinks
international diplomats will have found her testimony reassuring.</p>
<p>“Especially after the whiplash effect of Trump disowning the Paris
[climate] deal and World Health Organization during his first afternoon
in office,” he said.</p>
<p>No vote has been scheduled yet in the committee on her nomination. If
Stefanik passes that hurdle, and she is widely expected to, then her
nomination would go to the full Senate for a final vote.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
The newly inaugurated president does not like the wind industry.
Especially
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/wind-executive-order-trump" target="_blank">the
offshore wind industry</a>.
</p>
<p>
Donald Trump Monday night issued an
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/temporary-withdrawal-of-all-areas-on-the-outer-continental-shelf-from-offshore-wind-leasing-and-review-of-the-federal-governments-leasing-and-permitting-practices-for-wind-projects/" target="_blank">expansive
executive order</a> targeting the sector that the industry is only just
starting to digest. And while the executive order was mostly being seen
as a pause or moratorium on new offshore leasing, it could have much
more wide-ranging effects. It calls for the Secretary of the Interior
and the Attorney General to “conduct a comprehensive review of the
ecological, economic, and environmental necessity of terminating or
amending any existing wind energy leases, identifying any legal bases
for such removal,” thus calling gigawatts of existing, permitted
projects into doubt.
</p>
<p>
“The executive order pausing new offshore wind leasing and permitting is
a blow to the American offshore wind industry and hurts the hundreds of
U.S. supply chain companies and thousands of workers already building
more American energy,” Liz Burdock, the chief executive officer of the
Oceantic Network, an offshore wind industry group, said in a statement.
“Today’s actions threaten to strand $25 billion already flowing into new
ports, vessels, and manufacturing centers, and curtail future
investments across our country.” Companies that have active offshore
projects have been largely mum on the order. A spokesperson for Orsted,
the Danish company behind the under-construction Revolution Wind project
off the coast of Rhode Island and the Sunrise Wind project off the coast
of Long Island, told me only that it was “in the process of reviewing it
to assess the impact on our portfolio.”
</p>
<p>
A spokesperson for Equinor, which is working on the Empire Wind project,
projected to
<a href="https://www.equinor.com/news/20240604-solidifies-new-york-offtake-contract-empire-wind-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>start
serving</u></a> New York City in 2026, told me, “Equinor is committed to
advancing a broad energy portfolio that supports a domestic supply
chain, generates skilled jobs, and makes a lasting contribution to
American energy security. We will continue to assess all policy
developments and work with the Trump administration as we deliver
long-term energy solutions for the growing American economy.”
</p>
<p>
Several other major offshore and onshore wind developers, including
Pattern Energy, Avangrid, and NextEra either did not respond to requests
for comment or would not comment on their ongoing projects in light of
the order.
</p>
<p>
Trade group officials and outside experts were skeptical that the order
would stop projects currently under construction like Revolution Wind,
Vineyard Wind in Massachusetts, or the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind
Project, backed by the utility Dominion. Projects like Empire and
Sunrise Wind, which have started some onshore construction, may survive
as well. But the Biden Administration also permitted a flurry of
projects in its final year, including SouthCoast Wind, New England Wind,
Atlantic Shores South, and the Maryland Offshore Wind Project, and those
may now be in doubt.
</p>
<p>
“Projects with steel in the water are probably safe,” Cy McGeady, a
fellow in the Energy Security and Climate Change Program at the Center
for Strategic and International Studies, told me. “I’d be shocked if a
project with steel in the water has its permit revoked.” But of those
that haven’t yet gotten started, he cautioned, “It’s those projects that
are most at risk.”
</p>
<p>
Shares of Orsted fell over 9% in the United States Tuesday after the
company announced $1.7 billion in impairments due to delays on its
Sunrise Wind project — not related to the executive orders. The company
also said it was
<a href="https://orsted.com/en/company-announcement-list/2025/01/orsted-announces-impairments-relating-to-us-intere-142283101" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>marking
down the value</u></a> of its leases off the coasts of New Jersey,
Maryland, and Delaware, and cited “considerably increased project
costs,” as well as delays linked to transmission equipment for the wind
turbines.
</p>
<p>
“Delivering the project within the updated schedule and cost is an
absolute top priority for Orsted,” the company’s chief executive Mads
Nipper said in a statement on the accounting changes.
</p>
<p>
The executive order comes after a dreadful few years for the offshore
wind industry, which has been hammered by high costs, delays, and
interest rate hikes, which led to several project cancellations even
before Trump’s victory. The wind industry as a whole has seen slowing
growth, thanks to difficulties building adequate transmission, exposure
to high interest rates, and rising local opposition. New wind energy
additions in the United States peaked in 2020 and 2021
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=62784#:~:text=Following%20the%20record%20wind%20capacity,our%20July%20Monthly%20Energy%20Review." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>with
14 gigawatts of added capacity</u></a>, falling to just over 6
<a href="https://cleanpower.org/news/market-report-2023/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>gigawatts
in 2023</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
The executive order also, at best, means no more new leasing for the
duration of Trump’s time in office, calling into question the growth
prospects of the whole offshore wind industry in the United States.
Onshore wind may be on firmer ground, as many projects, especially in
Texas, are not built on federal lands and do not require the full
federal permitting process to be built.
</p>
<p>
“If the growth prospects are curtailed or drastically limited or at
least diminished for the next four-plus years,” McGeady told me,
referring to the offshore wind industry, “then it’s much harder to
justify costs in the near term investment and expenditure of capital for
an industry that might never launch.”<br/>

The newly inaugurated president does not like the wind industry.
Especially
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/wind-executive-order-trump" target="_blank">the
offshore wind industry</a>.
</p>
<p>
Donald Trump on Monday night issued an
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/temporary-withdrawal-of-all-areas-on-the-outer-continental-shelf-from-offshore-wind-leasing-and-review-of-the-federal-governments-leasing-and-permitting-practices-for-wind-projects/" target="_blank">expansive
executive order</a> targeting the sector that the industry is only just
starting to digest. And while the executive order was mostly being seen
as a pause or moratorium on new offshore leasing, it could have much
more wide-ranging effects. It calls for the Secretary of the Interior
and the Attorney General to “conduct a comprehensive review of the
ecological, economic, and environmental necessity of terminating or
amending any existing wind energy leases, identifying any legal bases
for such removal,” thus calling gigawatts of existing, permitted
projects into doubt.
</p>
<p>
“The executive order pausing new offshore wind leasing and permitting is
a blow to the American offshore wind industry and hurts the hundreds of
U.S. supply chain companies and thousands of workers already building
more American energy,” Liz Burdock, the chief executive officer of the
Oceantic Network, an offshore wind industry group, said in a statement.
“Today’s actions threaten to strand $25 billion already flowing into new
ports, vessels, and manufacturing centers, and curtail future
investments across our country.” Companies that have active offshore
projects have been largely mum on the order. A spokesperson for Orsted,
the Danish company behind the under-construction Revolution Wind project
off the coast of Rhode Island and the Sunrise Wind project off the coast
of Long Island, told me only that it was “in the process of reviewing it
to assess the impact on our portfolio.”
</p>
<p>
A spokesperson for Equinor, which is working on the Empire Wind project,
projected to
<a href="https://www.equinor.com/news/20240604-solidifies-new-york-offtake-contract-empire-wind-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>start
serving</u></a> New York City in 2026, told me, “Equinor is committed to
advancing a broad energy portfolio that supports a domestic supply
chain, generates skilled jobs, and makes a lasting contribution to
American energy security. We will continue to assess all policy
developments and work with the Trump administration as we deliver
long-term energy solutions for the growing American economy.”
</p>
<p>
Several other major offshore and onshore wind developers, including
Pattern Energy, Avangrid, and NextEra either did not respond to requests
for comment or would not comment on their ongoing projects in light of
the order.
</p>
<p>
Trade group officials and outside experts were skeptical that the order
would stop projects currently under construction like Revolution Wind,
Vineyard Wind in Massachusetts, or the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind
Project, backed by the utility Dominion. Projects like Empire and
Sunrise Wind, which have started some onshore construction, may survive
as well. But the Biden Administration also permitted a flurry of
projects in its final year, including SouthCoast Wind, New England Wind,
Atlantic Shores South, and the Maryland Offshore Wind Project, and those
may now be in doubt.
</p>
<p>
“Projects with steel in the water are probably safe,” Cy McGeady, a
fellow in the Energy Security and Climate Change Program at the Center
for Strategic and International Studies, told me. “I’d be shocked if a
project with steel in the water has its permit revoked.” But of those
that haven’t yet gotten started, he cautioned, “It’s those projects that
are most at risk.”
</p>
<p>
Shares of Orsted fell over 9% in the United States Tuesday after the
company announced $1.7 billion in impairments due to delays on its
Sunrise Wind project — not related to the executive orders. The company
also said it was
<a href="https://orsted.com/en/company-announcement-list/2025/01/orsted-announces-impairments-relating-to-us-intere-142283101" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>marking
down the value</u></a> of its leases off the coasts of New Jersey,
Maryland, and Delaware, and cited “considerably increased project
costs,” as well as delays linked to transmission equipment for the wind
turbines.
</p>
<p>
“Delivering the project within the updated schedule and cost is an
absolute top priority for Orsted,” the company’s chief executive Mads
Nipper said in a statement on the accounting changes.
</p>
<p>
The executive order comes after a dreadful few years for the offshore
wind industry, which has been hammered by high costs, delays, and
interest rate hikes, which led to several project cancellations even
before Trump’s victory. The wind industry as a whole has seen slowing
growth, thanks to difficulties building adequate transmission, exposure
to high interest rates, and rising local opposition. New wind energy
additions in the United States peaked in 2020 and 2021
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=62784#:~:text=Following%20the%20record%20wind%20capacity,our%20July%20Monthly%20Energy%20Review." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>with
14 gigawatts of added capacity</u></a>, falling to just over 6
<a href="https://cleanpower.org/news/market-report-2023/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>gigawatts
in 2023</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
The executive order also, at best, means no more new leasing for the
duration of Trump’s time in office, calling into question the growth
prospects of the whole offshore wind industry in the United States.
Onshore wind may be on firmer ground, as many projects, especially in
Texas, are not built on federal lands and do not require the full
federal permitting process to be built.
</p>
<p>
“If the growth prospects are curtailed or drastically limited or at
least diminished for the next four-plus years,” McGeady told me,
referring to the offshore wind industry, “then it’s much harder to
justify costs in the near term investment and expenditure of capital for
an industry that might never launch.”<br/>

<p class="drop-caps">
At 2:30 a.m. on June 6, 1998, Whitley Strieber awoke to a knock on his
hotel door. Strieber, a UFOologist — that is, a scholar of unidentified
flying objects and other paranormal phenomena — was in Toronto that
night on tour, promoting his latest book, and he groggily got up to let
his visitor in, assuming it was room service. It wasn’t.
</p>
<p>
According to Strieber, he and his nocturnal visitor proceeded to speak
on a wide range of topics in his room over the next half hour. Although
he never heard from the man again after that night, Strieber took notes
during their meeting, during which the visitor tipped him off about
“what was then rather obscure climatology,” Strieber told me.
Specifically — according to Strieber — the visitor told him about the
pending collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, or
AMOC, the system sometimes described as the oceanic conveyor belt
responsible for influencing the climate of the Northern Hemisphere.
</p>
<p>
The late-night conversation became the premise of Strieber’s next book,
1999’s <em><em>The Coming Global Superstorm</em></em>, which he co-wrote
with the paranormal radio show host Art Bell. The scientific community
<a href="https://fee.org/articles/the-coming-global-superstorm-by-art-bell-and-whitley-strieber/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>was
not exactly impressed</u></a> by the work: “I think they’d rather forget
I even exist,” Strieber told me. (Bell died in 2018.)
</p>
<p>
But Strieber got the last laugh: <em><em>The Coming Global
Superstorm</em></em> not only became the premise for <em><em>The Day
After Tomorrow</em></em>, the 2004 disaster movie in which Dennis Quaid
plays an NOAA paleoclimatologist, and New York freezes over and is beset
by wolves, but recent modeling also indicates that the AMOC actually
<em><em>is</em></em> slowing down. In some of the latest worst case
scenario models, researchers say it could reach the point of no return,
sending it into collapse

predict</u></a> that “the ice age pattern of a cooling north and warming
south would play out again,” and while Northern Europe would bear the
brunt of the effects, the Arctic temperatures experienced across North
America this week — from a

a norm rather than an anomaly</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
“I have watched [<em><em>The Day After Tomorrow</em></em>] a couple of
times over the last few years, and I’m surprised at how the general
premise isn’t that bad,” David Thornalley, a paleoceanographer at
University College London, told me.
</p>
<p>
Of course, there is more wrong in <em><em>The Day After
Tomorrow</em></em> (and <em><em>The Coming Global Superstorm</em></em>,
for that matter) than there is right: Thornalley added that following an
<em><em>actual</em></em> AMOC collapse, weather-related changes would
take place on a “multi-decadal time scale” rather than in the mere weeks
of exaggerated calamity depicted in the film.
</p>
<p>
Still, <em><em>The Day After Tomorrow</em></em> — which predated Al
Gore’s <em><em>An Inconvenient Truth</em></em> by two years and was
<a href="https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2024/05/the-enduring-influence-of-the-day-after-tomorrow-20-years-later/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>many
Americans’ first introduction</u></a> to the idea of anthropogenic
extreme weather — can seem, in retrospect, to have been eerily
prescient. It anticipated global warming-caused fresh water runoff from
Greenland, which is upsetting the salinity of the ocean — essentially
making it less dense — and breaking down the warm-and-cold water
circulation across the globe that currently keeps our climate stable.
With enough fresh water, the planet’s circulatory system could shut down
for the first time since the Neanderthals went extinct.
</p>
<p>
And while Los Angeles isn’t going to be leveled by tornadoes and wolves
won’t roam the tundra of Midtown Manhattan, Europe
<em><em>could</em></em>
<a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/09022024/climate-impacts-from-collapse-of-atlantic-meridional-overturning-current-could-be-worse-than-expected/?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAhbi8BhDIARIsAJLOluc2JHcvIEKPiZanC3orHGWnHfF9IVD_iGTfCXaucjZFnyI3EvWIt74aAiWYEALw_wcB" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>cool
by as much as 1.5 degrees Celsius</u></a> (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit),
which would have disastrous consequences for the continent’s
agriculture. Additionally, the sharp temperature disparities between
Northern Europe and the Mediterranean region could result in expansive
(albeit not <em><em>global</em></em>) storms. While the U.S. would
likely dodge the worst of an AMOC-induced cooldown, an ensuing sea level
rise would impact many of the nation’s populous and iconic seaboard
cities.
</p>
<p>
As shrewd as <em><em>Day After Tomorrow</em></em> and its source
material might seem now, research into the possibility of an AMOC
collapse dates back to the work of oceanographer Henry Stommel, who made
the ocean salinity-conveyor belt
<a href="https://tos.org/oceanography/article/is-the-atlantic-overturning-circulation-approaching-a-tipping-point" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>connection</u></a>
in 1961. “That wasn’t taken very seriously because it wasn’t really an
ocean model but just a sort of conceptual view on salt and heat
interaction on the density,” Henk Dijkstra, a professor of physical
oceanography at Utrecht University and one of the authors of
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39810-w" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
recent modeling</u></a> that points toward an impending AMOC collapse,
told me.
</p>
<p>
By 1986, however, the field of paleoclimatology was expanding rapidly.
Researchers sampled ice cores collected from places like Greenland, and
learned that there had been “very abrupt changes in climate” in the
past, Thornalley told me. The Northern Hemisphere “would appear to be
switching from a warm climate to a cold climate — flickering back and
forth. And [scientists] put two and two together.”
</p>
<p>
The news was something of a revelation. “We started to develop this
paradigm that, yes, we’ve had abrupt climate change in the past, and we
think we can relate it to these changes in the Atlantic circulation, and
the climate models suggest that, if possible, it could happen in the
future,” said Thornalley, who began his PhD the year that<em><em> Day
After Tomorrow </em></em>was released. The precedent wasn’t exactly
reassuring news — the last time the AMOC collapsed, after all, “there
were massive ice sheets and wooly mammoths,” Thornalley added. “It’s not
a nice world for humans to try and live in.”
</p>
<p>
Despite the dire warning in the ice cores, an AMOC collapse wasn’t on
the public’s radar before its introduction via Quaid and Jake
Gyllenhaal. That isn’t to say it wasn’t a buzzy topic of discussion in
the scientific community (not to mention that of beings who make a habit
of dropping in on UFOlogists in the wee hours of the night). “It was
really a hot topic” in climate circles, Thornalley confirmed. The film
was “very much of its time.”
</p>
<p>
<em><em>The Day After Tomorrow</em></em>’s scientific resonance today,
then, is due more to the fact that AMOC modeling has continued to hone
in on the theory of a pending collapse with precision than because of
any stunning predictive qualities of the movie itself. The scientific
community is still in deep debate over the possibilities and potential
outcomes and timelines of the process — a new paper out last week even
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-55297-5" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>argues</u></a>
that the AMOC <em><em>hasn’t </em></em>been declining — but for all the
messiness and caveats, Thornalley ultimately lands in a place not so far
from Strieber’s own position. “I don’t think we should be happy to wait
until we’re really confident because, by then, it’d be too late,”
Thornalley told me. “It’d be rubbish if in 30 to 40 years time, [the
AMOC has collapsed] and people go, ‘Well why didn’t you warn us about
it?’ ‘Oh, because we wanted to make sure we were really, really,
<em><em>really</em></em> sure.’
</p>
<p>
Modern modeling of an AMOC collapse circles back to its speculative
offshoots in other ways. Dijkstra told me he’s been working recently on
models that consider how to encourage AMOC’s recovery, including via the
rapid reduction of emissions. But his team has <em><em>also</em></em>
run experiments that consider climate geoengineering, including “putting
aerosols in the stratosphere” and “closing the Bering Straight,” both of
which have the potential to limit freshwater from pouring into the
Atlantic. “It’s a bit science fiction, but in models you can do
everything,” Dijkstra said.
</p>
<p>
UFOlogists and mainstream scientists don’t often find themselves on the
same side. But while many would dismiss Strieber as an
<a href="https://thebaffler.com/latest/give-us-this-doomsday-robertson" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>environmental
conspiracy theorist</u></a>, the epigraph to <em><em>The Coming Global
Superstorm</em></em> reads as urgently and poignantly today as it did
umpteen AMOC models ago: “May the children of tomorrow look back on our
era as the one where the healing of the earth began.”

executive orders on gender draw mixed reaction across Africa</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ABUJA, NIGERIA — Conservatives across Africa applauded U.S. President
Donald Trump’s executive orders Monday regarding gender and diversity,
while gay rights activists and the LGBTQ community on the continent are
expressing deep concern.</p>
<p>On his first day as the 47th U.S. president, Donald Trump signed a
flurry of executive orders, including some that reversed policies of his
predecessor, Joe Biden.</p>
<p>These included orders revoking some protections for transgender
people and defining the sexes strictly as male and female.</p>
<p>Trump’s actions sparked a mix of reactions throughout Africa.</p>
<p>Some, like Bishop John Praise Daniel, vice president of the
Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria, welcomed Trump’s moves.</p>
<p>“I’m very excited,” he said “I think Donald Trump has just done what
is right, because how can some young persons wake up and say, ‘I don’t
feel like being a girl, I want to be a boy,’ and their sexes will be
changed. We don’t need that confusion. Bringing back righteousness,
order and sanity to society.”</p>
<p>But while many in Africa’s conservative societies are in support,
LGBTQ activists strongly opposed the decision, calling it a setback
after years of progress and advocacy.</p>
<p>Frank Ejiogu, founder of Creme de la Creme, a Nigerian LGBTQ advocacy
group, warned of serious consequences.</p>
<p>“We know this will have ripple effects that might catalyze violence
against LGBTQ community members in the Global South, which will boil
down to discrimination, assault, and a lot of [restrictive] policies
that governments will start enacting,” he said.</p>
<p>Ejiogu said LGBTQ activists already are planning how to resist such
measures.</p>
<p>“We’re strategizing on how to stand firm on what we believe in and
for the community,” he said. “[Trump] can only be there for four years.
The only thing we promise ourselves all over the globe and in the Global
South is to making sure that we fight back against the policies against
LGBTQ communities all around the world.”</p>
<p>Members of the LGBTQ community already face harsh penalties in many
African countries.</p>
<p>In Nigeria, same-sex relationships are punishable by up to 14 years
in prison. Uganda’s constitutional court upheld a life sentence for
homosexuality offenders last year, while Mali’s junta criminalized
homosexuality with imprisonment in December.</p>

id="us-withdrawals-from-who-paris-agreement-met-with-regret-calls-for-reversal">US
withdrawals from WHO, Paris Agreement met with regret, calls for
reversal</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Geneva — United Nations agencies say the imminent U.S. withdrawal
from the World Health Organization and Paris climate agreement will have
serious consequences for global health and efforts to slow down climate
change.</p>
<p>“The World Health Organization regrets the announcement that the
United States of America intends to withdraw from the organization,” the
WHO said Tuesday in response to U.S. President Donald Trump’s
declaration Monday that he intends to quit the U.N. health agency.</p>
<p>“WHO plays a crucial role in protecting the health and security of
the world’s people, including Americans, by addressing the root causes
of disease, building stronger health systems, and detecting, preventing
and responding to health emergencies, including disease outbreaks, often
in dangerous places where others cannot go,” it stated.</p>
<p>In explaining his decision, Trump accused the agency of being subject
to “inappropriate political influence” from other member states.  “World
Health ripped us off, everybody rips off the United States. It’s not
going to happen anymore,” he said in signing an executive order Monday,
hours after his inauguration.</p>
<p>In responding to the allegations, WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic
told journalists at a briefing in Geneva Tuesday that the United States,
which was one of the founding members of WHO in 1948, had over seven
decades together with the WHO, “saved countless lives and protected
Americans and all people from health threats.”</p>
<p>“Together, we ended smallpox, and together we have brought polio to
the brink of eradication,” he said.</p>
<p>The United States is the WHO’s single largest donor. It contributed
$1.284 billion or 18 percent of the agency’s 2022-2023 budget.</p>
<p>Jasaravic said the U.S. decision was not unexpected and the WHO was
now analyzing the exact details of Trump’s executive order “to see how
this will play out and to see what will be the consequences.”</p>
<p>He noted that the United States can formally leave the WHO and stop
financing the organization one year after the United Nations receives
official written notice of U.S. withdrawal.</p>
<p>He said the WHO hopes the United States will reconsider its decision
and maintain the U.S.-WHO partnership “for the benefit of the health and
well-being of millions of people around the globe.”</p>
<p>“At the same time, we will continue to work in the world’s most
difficult places,” including countries in conflict, “so we can protect
the most vulnerable and be where people need us the most,” he said.</p>
<p>“The world lives longer, healthier, perhaps a little bit happier
because of WHO, which goes to places where others cannot go, including
Gaza, Yemen, Afghanistan, and Sudan,” Jens Laerke, spokesperson for the
Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, OCHA, said in
support of the beleaguered agency.</p>
<p>In the meantime, U.N. officials have called the U.S. decision to
withdraw from the 2015 Paris Agreement “a major disappointment,” noting
that the world’s nations had adopted the accord because they recognized
“the immense harm that climate change is already causing and the
enormous opportunity that climate action presents.”</p>
<p>Antonio Guterres, the U.N. secretary-general, said that it was
“crucial that the United States remains a leader on environmental
issues” in this critical decade for climate action.</p>
<p>The World Meteorological Organization has warned that “climate change
is playing out, on an almost daily basis, through more extreme
weather.”</p>
<p>A recent WMO report finds the last 10 years have been the hottest in
recorded history, and that 2024 was the hottest year on record, with
temperatures at about 1.55 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial
era.</p>
<p>“Every fraction of a degree of global warming has an impact on our
economies and our lives,” Clare Nullis, WMO spokesperson said, adding
that “The U.S. accounts for the lion’s share of global economic losses
from weather, climate and water-related hazards.”</p>
<p>According to the non-profit USAFacts, “nearly 40 percent of the
billion-dollar climate events that have hit the U.S. since 1980 happened
between 2017 and the present day.” The data-gathering organization says
that “2023 had the most billion-dollar natural disaster events of any

<p>Nullis pointed out Tuesday that the ongoing Los Angeles wildfires are
“estimated to be the most costly U.S. disaster on record.”</p>
<p>“Not all of these weather-related disasters, you know, have a
connection with climate change.  We are not saying that…but climate
change is an aggravating factor.  It is making our weather much more,
much more extreme,” she said.  “So, you know, the need for the Paris
Agreement is pretty obvious.”</p>

2nd term: Hopes for economic prosperity amid new challenges</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Many American voters are hopeful that President Donald Trump’s second
term, which began on Jan. 20, will usher in a period of economic
prosperity — much like they felt during his first term.</p>
<p>However, the economy he is inheriting this time around is markedly
different from the one he inherited eight years ago, pre-pandemic. And
he faces new challenges.</p>
<p>While former President Joe Biden has defended his handling of the
country’s economic recovery — pointing to strong job growth and falling
inflation — high prices persist. A large national debt, climate change
and some of Trump’s own policy proposals may further complicate efforts
to boost the economy.</p>

repeat of need to take control of Greenland raises concerns, stirs
debate</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NUUK, GREENLAND — U.S. President Donald Trump reiterated his
assertion Monday that the United States needs to take control of
Greenland from Denmark in the interests of “international security.”</p>
<p>His repeated calls in recent weeks are raising concerns and stirring
debate among the Arctic island’s 57,000-strong population as well as
alarm among the United States’ European allies.</p>
<p>“Greenland is a wonderful place. We need it for international
security. And I’m sure that Denmark will come along,” the president
said.</p>
<p>“The people of Greenland are not happy with Denmark, as you know. I
think they are happy with us. … My son and representatives went up there
two weeks ago, and they like us. So, we’ll see what happens,” Trump told
reporters in the Oval Office on Monday, hours after his inauguration as
the 47th president of the United States.</p>
<p>Donald Trump Jr. visited Greenland’s capital, Nuuk, on Jan. 7, where
he handed out “Make America Great Again” baseball caps and had lunch
with a group of locals before returning to the U.S. a few hours
later.</p>
<p>At a press conference in Florida the same day, President-elect Trump
said he refused to rule out using economic or military force to take
control of Greenland.</p>
<p>‘Not for sale’</p>
<p>Denmark and its European allies have offered a cautious response,
emphasising the need to respect international sovereignty while trying
not to offend Trump.</p>
<p>Greenland already has a high degree of independence, although Denmark
retains responsibility for the island’s security affairs.</p>
<p>Naaja Nathanielsen, a senior minister in Greenland’s autonomous
government, gave a simple response to Trump’s comments.  “We are not a
commodity. And we are not for sale,” she told VOA.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Nathanielsen sees common ground with Washington.</p>
<p>“If you cut through the rhetoric, I hear two messages from the U.S.,”
she said. “One is we need to look at the national security aspect, and
we quite agree with the U.S. message in that point. We’ve been trying to
advocate for that as well for some years. And the other perspective is,
and the other message I hear is, we want to engage more in the
Greenlandic mineral sector. And that is really, you know, kicking in an
open door.”</p>
<p>Political change</p>
<p>Greenland is due to hold a general election by April at the latest.
The government wants a simultaneous referendum on full independence from
Denmark.</p>
<p>“Greenlanders themselves must decide what our future looks like,”
Greenlandic Premier Mute Egede said during a live televised debate on
Sunday with political leaders from Denmark and Greenland. “We have said
very precisely that Greenland — and us in this country — do not want to
be Americans. We don’t want to be Danes either. We are Greenlanders,” he
said.</p>
<p>After centuries of Danish control, the political winds of change in
Greenland are getting stronger, according to Arnaq Nielsen, opinion
editor at Greenland’s weekly Sermitsiaq newspaper.</p>
<p>“Everything is about the visit of Trump Junior, and when you meet
people, it’s all we talk about,” Nielsen told VOA in an interview at the
Sermitsiaq newsroom in Nuuk.</p>
<p>“This situation is evolving so quickly. Now it’s about a lot more
than the complicated relationship between Denmark and Greenland.
Suddenly Trump Junior is here, and it all explodes. It’s hard to figure
out what is going on.”</p>
<p>“It’s a small number of people here who are really happy that Trump
Junior came to Greenland. And a small number of people really resent him
coming here. But the large majority are not that loud because only the
two extremes are being heard,” Nielsen said.</p>
<p>Social media</p>
<p>Those extremes are being amplified by social media. YouTube
influencers have followed Trump Junior’s visit to Greenland, handing out
American dollar bills to passers-by, along with baseball caps emblazoned
with the slogan “Make Greenland Great Again.” The influencers are not
associated with the Trump administration.</p>
<p>Several Greenlanders welcomed the unfamiliar visitors. Others have
engaged in angry exchanges. A video posted online last week showed an
unidentified local resident tearing up a U.S. currency note and stamping
on a red Make Greenland Great Again baseball cap.</p>
<p>“Do you think you can buy us?” the man said.</p>
<p>Residents of Nuuk who spoke to VOA were divided over the global
attention.</p>
<p>“I think we are in a terrible situation,” Nuuk resident Per Chemnitz
said. “Our politicians are handling this totally wrong. They have been
seduced by something so much bigger than they are able to handle. So, I
don’t know where this will end. The worst thing that can happen is that
we lose our relationship to Denmark.”</p>
<p>Aka Gronvold, who also lives in the Greenlandic capital, welcomed the
Trumps’ intervention.</p>
<p>“Right now, Greenland has the attention of the whole world. That is
really good, and it’s about time that Greenland gets some more
attention.” Gronvold told VOA.</p>
<p>‘Make Greenland Great Again’</p>
<p>That attention looks set to continue. Republican lawmakers last week
introduced a bill titled the Make Greenland Great Again Act, allowing
President Trump to start talks with Denmark over purchasing Greenland.
It’s not yet clear whether the bill will receive enough support from
Congress.</p>
<p>Denmark has echoed Greenland’s assertion that the island is not for
sale but said it would welcome greater cooperation with Trump in
security and mineral extraction.</p>
<p>Controlling Greenland comes with a cost, noted analyst Jon
Rahbek-Clemmensen of the Royal Danish Defense College.</p>
<p>“If the U.S. went in and were to acquire Greenland, they would
suddenly also have to pay the bill for running Greenlandic society — a
bill that’s being covered by the Danish government right now and which
runs along the lines of U.S. $750 million to U.S. $1 billion a year,”
Rahbek-Clemmensen said.</p>
<p>“[The U.S.] gets all its interests, and it doesn’t have to pay the
bill. And so, geopolitically speaking, it doesn’t really make that much
sense to change that situation. So, if I were to explain why Trump has
an interest in Greenland… I would say that it probably has to do with
the whole ideology of Make America Great Again,” he told VOA.</p>
<p>“In this situation. acquiring Greenland would literally make the U.S.
greater — or at least bigger,” he said.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
President Donald Trump signed 33 executive orders, memoranda, and
proclamations after dinnertime on Monday, giving journalists, pundits,
and concerned citizens plenty of material to work through after his
first day in office. His Day One mandates included ordering federal
workers to return to office full-time — never mind that the U.S.
presidency is perhaps the most famous work-from-home job in the world —
and
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/putting-people-over-fish-stopping-radical-environmentalism-to-provide-water-to-southern-california/" target="_blank"><u>formalizing
his hatred of a two-inch-long fish</u></a>. Trump also
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/wind-executive-order-trump" target="_self"><u>ordered
an end to all wind permits</u></a>, which my colleague Jael Holzman
described as “the worst-case scenario” for the nearly $50 billion
industry;
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-executive-order-schedule-f" target="_self"><u>paved
the way to fire</u></a> potentially thousands of civil servants;
withdrew the U.S. from
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-leaves-paris-agreement" target="_self"><u>the
Paris Agreement</u></a> (again); and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/trump-ev-executive-order" target="_self"><u>followed
through on his promise</u></a> to wage all-out war on electric vehicles.
</p>
<p>
One more of the most significant implications related to climate,
however, came buried in Trump’s sweeping reversal of 78 Biden-era
executive orders: the overturning of Executive Order 14008, “Tackling
the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad.” Biden had signed the executive
order during <em><em>his</em></em> first week in office and, in doing
so, declared that the U.S. “places the climate crisis at the forefront
of foreign policy and national security planning.”
</p>
<p>
To fully understand the consequences of Trump rescinding this order, I
spoke with Erin Sikorsky, the director of the Center for Climate &amp;
Security, a nonpartisan think tank that specializes in the intersection
of climate change and national security policies. Our conversation has
been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Last night, President Trump rescinded a Biden-era executive
order designating climate change a foreign policy and national security
priority. Why do you find that concerning?</strong>
</p>
<p>
Regardless of who’s in the White House, climate change continues apace —
and continues to threaten U.S. national security and foreign policy
interests. We just saw this in the past couple of weeks in Los Angeles
with the wildfires there, which caused significant devastation to
American lives and livelihoods, but also required the deployment of U.S.
troops, threatened U.S. military bases, and interrupted other U.S.
foreign policy objectives. President Biden had to cancel his last
foreign visit to Europe, where he was supposed to meet with President
Zelenskyy to talk about the war in Ukraine; he had to do the same thing
during Hurricane Helene and cancel foreign visits that were about
competition with China and the war in Ukraine. By sending the message
that the U.S. administration is taking a step back from climate as a
security issue, it creates a blind spot for the U.S. and creates risks.
</p>
<p>
<strong>When speaking to the press last night, Trump said his No. 1
foreign policy goal is keeping America safe. In your experience, how
does climate change fit into that picture?</strong>
</p>
<p>
Keeping America safe means continuing to project military power and
stand up to adversaries and competitors — and climate change is shaping
all of that. It affects our military operations and our ability to
deploy. It also affects Chinese national interests and the threat that
China poses.
</p>
<p>
Our allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific, which are key to our
military strategies for countering China in that region, are all
threatened by climate change. Their airports, their economies, their
military bases and structures, and the U.S. military facilities that are
hosted in those places — they’re all threatened. If you’re not going to
focus on that, or you’re not going to address it, then you’re creating a
weakness. China’s overarching national security strategy includes
environmental and ecological security. It is thinking about how climate
affects its strategies.
</p>
<p>
<strong>In other words, our adversaries are acting on this, even if
we’re not?</strong>
</p>
<p>
Exactly. And that’s the thing with
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-leaves-paris-agreement" target="_self"><u>stepping
back from the Paris Agreement</u></a>, as well: It creates a vacuum of
leadership that China is more than happy to step into.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Would you expect the U.S. intelligence community or the
Department of Defense to continue to act on climate change as it relates
to foreign policy, just in less overt ways? Or do moves like this by the
new administration hamstring those efforts?</strong>
</p>
<p>
The Department of Defense’s mission is still to be able to fight and win
wars and to preserve its installations and operations. I expect that
efforts to invest in resilience and adaptation will continue. There’s
been bipartisan support on Capitol Hill for about a decade now to make
sure that these issues are taken seriously. When Hurricane Michael
decimated Tyndall Air Force Base on the Gulf Coast a few years ago, it
was under the last Trump administration that they deployed money to
rebuild that base. So I think that will continue.
</p>
<p>
The same will be true for the U.S. intelligence community, which remains
independent from policy. It’s not the State Department, where you have
to implement the president’s policies — you’re supposed to warn of
risks. Your job is to give the president a decision advantage and warn
of threats to the U.S., which means calling it like you see it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Is there any particular region or conflict that could suffer
from politicizing climate change in the coming years?</strong>
</p>
<p>
In Europe in the past year, Poland faced the worst floods in its history
and had to deploy thousands of troops to manage those risks.
</p>
<p>
NATO has been a real leader in this space, partly because of the Arctic
and the changes and challenges we see there. And so if the U.S. steps
back, other leaders will continue to step forward. We’ve already seen
that a bit from some European leader statements. Still, we risk U.S.
resilience and dominance in the Arctic if we do not understand how
climate affects our ability to operate there.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Speaking of national security in the Arctic, what do you make of
</strong><a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-greenland-minerals-rare-earth" target="_self"><u><strong>the
whole Greenland situation</strong></u></a><strong>?</strong>
</p>
<p>
If the real concern is about U.S. security in the Arctic, there are a
lot of other policies that the U.S. can pursue. I don’t think expanding
our territory and threatening the purchase of other sovereign nations is
the right way to go.

id="mexico-defends-sovereignty-as-us-seeks-to-label-cartels-as-terrorists">Mexico
defends sovereignty as US seeks to label cartels as terrorists</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MEXICO CITY — Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum said Tuesday that
President Donald Trump’s executive order moving toward designating drug
cartels as foreign terrorist organizations would only impact Mexico if
there’s close coordination between the two governments.</p>
<p>She said that Mexico would defend its sovereignty and independence
while seeking coordination with the U.S. in the wake of the order signed
Monday.</p>
<p>“We all want to fight the drug cartels,” Sheinbaum said at her daily
press briefing. The U.S. “in their territory, us in our territory.”</p>
<p>Trump’s order highlighted Mexican drug cartels and other Latin
American criminal groups like Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua and
Salvadoran gang Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13). The order says they “threaten
the safety of the American people, the security of the United States,
and the stability of the international order in the Western
Hemisphere.”</p>
<p>The order did not list any Mexican cartels by name but said Cabinet
secretaries would recommend groups for designation as terrorist
organizations in the next 14 days. It was among a slew of executive
orders Trump signed Monday to kick off his administration, several of
which focus on securing the southern border.</p>
<p>“The Cartels have engaged in a campaign of violence and terror
throughout the Western Hemisphere that has not only destabilized
countries with significant importance for our national interests but
also flooded the United States with deadly drugs, violent criminals, and
vicious gangs,” the order reads.</p>
<p>It was unclear what the impact could be for fighting the cartels, but
there was concern it could be another way to make it more difficult for
people from the countries where those groups operate to access the
U.S.</p>
<p>It came in addition to measures including the declaration of an
emergency on the U.S. southern border, a promise to slap 25% tariffs on
Mexico and Canada on Feb. 1 and ending the use of the CBP One app, which
allowed migrants to apply for asylum appointments before reaching the
border.</p>
<p>Trump has also promised to carry out mass deportations and threatened
military intervention in Mexico to fight cartels, something sharply
rejected by Sheinbaum.</p>
<p>Many have voiced concern the terrorist designation could provide the
U.S. justification to take military action against cartels.</p>
<p>Vanda Felbab-Brown, an organized crime expert at the Brookings
Institution, said the order could have “huge implications from trade to
migrants.”</p>
<p>As cartels have gained a firm grip on control of the lucrative
migrant smuggling trade in recent years, it’s virtually impossible for
migrants and asylum seekers to pass through Mexico and other Latin
American countries without paying some sort of fee to cartels.</p>
<p>The moment they do, Felbab-Brown said, it could disqualify them from
seeking asylum.</p>
<p>“Trump can essentially prevent the vast majority of undocumented
migrants trying to cross the U.S. border from getting asylum,” she
said.</p>
<p>Mike Vigil, a former head of the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration’s foreign operations, said he expected any terrorism
designation to have very little impact on day-to-day operations against
cartels because many of the same anti-terrorism powers American
authorities would be granted are already employ in counter-narcotics
efforts.</p>
<p>“It’s already been done. This is nothing new,” Vigil said. “It’s all
political theater and tossing a piece of stale salami to [Trump’s]
base.”</p>
<p>He said logistically the order would likely allow the U.S. to seize
assets of groups in the U.S., sanction U.S. citizens that do business
with terrorist organizations and block members of those groups from
entering the U.S.</p>
<p>“It’s not going to allow the U.S. to send troops into Mexico like so
many people think simply because people forget that Mexico is a
sovereign country and it would be an act of war,” he said.</p>
<p>The move comes as cartel violence has intensified in northern Mexican
states after the kidnapping and detention of kingpin Ismael “El Mayo”
Zambada sparked an all-out war between rival factions of the Sinaloa
cartel. Gunmen continue to leave mutilated bodies scattered across the
state and kidnap people even from hospitals.</p>
<p>It’s part of a larger shifting dynamic in cartel warfare in the Latin
American nation. Years ago, a handful of criminal organizations headed
by a few key capos controlled large parts of Mexico. Now, many more
factions have violently fought for power, as they’ve become more agile
and harder to pin down.</p>
<p>They’ve used more sophisticated tools like bomb-dropping drones,
improvised explosive devices and rigged armored vehicles, and have
expanded into migrant trafficking and the avocado trade. Meanwhile,
thousands of Mexican citizens have gotten caught in the crossfire,
having been slain or gone missing.</p>

id="china-seeks-more-cooperation-with-us-as-trump-takes-office">China
seeks more cooperation with US as Trump takes office</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Taipei, Taiwan — China has urged the United States to focus on
managing bilateral relationships through cooperation instead of
confrontation as U.S. President Donald Trump kicks off his second term
in office. </p>
<p>“China is willing to work with the new U.S. government to maintain
communication, strengthen cooperation, properly manage differences, and
push China-U.S. relations to make greater progress from a new starting
point,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said during the
regular press conference on Tuesday in Beijing. </p>
<p>Analysts say Beijing hopes to reduce misunderstandings between both
sides through engagement and exchanges in the early stage of the second
Trump presidency. </p>
<p>“The Chinese government hopes China and the U.S. could understand
each other’s needs through communication,” said Shen Dingli, a
Shanghai-based international relations scholar. </p>
<p>“Beijing believes China and the U.S. can still reach a consensus and
avoid many misunderstandings that have arisen during the first Trump
presidency” if both sides prioritize efforts to stabilize bilateral
relations, he told VOA by phone. </p>
<p>Ahead of Trump’s inauguration on Monday, China and Trump’s team
conducted several top-level exchanges, including a call between the new
U.S. president and Chinese President Xi Jinping last Friday. </p>
<p>Trump said he and Xi would “solve many problems together” while the
Chinese president said the key to handling bilateral relations was to
“respect each other’s core interests and major concerns and to find a
proper solution to the problem.”</p>
<p>On Sunday, China’s Vice President Han Zheng, who was in Washington,
D.C., to attend Trump’s inauguration ceremony, met with his American
counterpart JD Vance, and a group of American business leaders,
including Tesla founder Elon Musk.</p>
<p>He said China and the U.S. could “contribute to each other’s
progress, bring benefits to the two countries, and make important
contributions to world peace and development” as long as they “uphold
the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win
cooperation.”</p>
<p>Additionally, Han urged U.S. businesses to “play an active role as a
bridge and make greater contribution to the development of China-U.S.
relations” by continuing to “invest and take root in China.” </p>
<p>Experts say Beijing wants to seize the opportunity to improve
bilateral relations with Washington through these initial engagements
with the Trump administration. </p>
<p>Beijing “would not only prefer to avoid increased sanctions but also
the potential for greater limitations on tech exports to China,” said
Timothy Rich, a political scientist at Western Kentucky University. </p>
<p>While the Chinese government has expressed willingness to cooperate
with the Trump administration, the U.S. president has also held off the
imposition of tariffs on imported goods from China, Mexico, and
Canada. </p>
<p>Instead, he released a broad trade memo that urged the United States
Trade Representative to assess China’s compliance with the “Phase 1”
trade deal that his administration signed with Beijing in 2020, which
required Beijing to increase purchases of U.S. exports by $200 billion
over two years.</p>
<p>Additionally, Trump signed an executive order that would delay the
ban on the popular social media app TikTok for 75 days but threatened to
impose tariffs on Chinese products if Beijing didn’t approve a potential
deal with TikTok.</p>
<p>“And if we said, well, ‘You’re not going to approve it’, then that’s
a certain hostility, and we’ll put tariffs of 25, 30,40, 50%, even
100%,” Trump said on Monday, after signing the executive order for
TikTok.</p>
<p>Rich said Trump’s decision to delay imposing tariffs on Chinese
products shows the U.S. president’s desire to “pressure China to make
some concessions” that he can declare as a victory. </p>
<p>“I suspect the talk of sticking it to China will return in the
absence of some face-saving concession or if other policies start to
falter, as a perceived tough-on-China stance taps into the broader
concern among many Americans,” he told VOA in a written response. </p>
<p>Some Chinese merchants said Trump’s decision to delay the imposition
of tariffs on Chinese products allows them to be better prepared for
similar scenarios in the future. </p>
<p>“I am finding other ways to export products to my American customers
by shifting operations to Southeast Asia,” a Chinese apparel exporter
surnamed Yuan in Shanghai, who asked to be identified only by his last
name due to security concerns, told VOA in a written response. </p>
<p>While Trump’s incoming cabinet includes several politicians known for
their hawkish stance on China, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio,
analysts say it’s unclear how the Trump administration’s China policies
will shape up. </p>
<p>“The ultimate decision-maker is Trump, and if China gives Trump what
he thinks he needs, those hawkish people and their beliefs will quickly
be sidelined and they may not have influence on U.S.-China policy,”
Dexter Roberts, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s
Global China Hub, told VOA by phone. </p>
<p>Despite the lack of clarity on the Trump administration’s China
policies, Shen in Shanghai said official comments from Beijing and
Washington suggest their initial exchanges have been “quite
positive.” </p>
<p>“This might mean there would be less misunderstandings and I think
both sides won’t waste this new opportunity to engage with each other,”
he told VOA.</p>

id="eu-china-warn-against-trade-friction-at-davos-after-trump-return">EU,
China warn against trade friction at Davos after Trump return</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Davos, Switzerland — EU chief Ursula von der Leyen declared Tuesday
that Europe was ready to negotiate with the United States and seek to
improve ties with China as Beijing warned against damaging trade wars in
the face of Donald Trump’s protectionism.</p>
<p>Trump returned to the White House on Monday, and while he may not be
physically present in the Swiss Alpine resort of Davos, he is the
elephant in the room for the executives and leaders hobnobbing at the
annual World Economic Forum.</p>
<p>With Beijing and Brussels facing some of the biggest risks from the
return of self-professed tariff-loving Trump, China’s Vice Premier Ding
Xuexiang and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen took to
the stage first at the forum.</p>
<p>“Protectionism leads nowhere and there are no winners in a trade
war,” Ding said, without mentioning Trump directly.</p>
<p>Trump threatened on Monday to impose tariffs if Beijing rejects his
proposal to keep Chinese-owned app TikTok online on condition that half
of it is sold off.</p>
<p>China is taking a cautious approach to Trump and after the TikTok
threat, Beijing said it hoped the United States would provide a fair
business environment for Chinese firms.</p>
<p>After Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke to Trump by phone on Friday,
he said he hoped for a “good start” to relations with the new US
administration.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, von der Leyen took a conciliatory tone. She said the EU’s
“first priority will be to engage early, discuss common interests and be
ready to negotiate” with Trump.</p>
<p>“We will be pragmatic but we will always stand by our principles, to
protect our interests and uphold our values,” she said.</p>
<p>The European Commission president also stressed that Europe “must
engage constructively with China – to find solutions in our mutual
interest” despite escalating trade tensions between the two.</p>
<p>Brussels has provoked Beijing’s ire with a raft of probes targeting
state subsidies in the green tech sector, as well as slapping tariffs on
Chinese electric cars.</p>
<p>In an apparent reference to the European Union measures, Ding warned
against “erecting green barriers that could disrupt normal economic and
trade cooperation.”</p>
<p>More trade deals</p>
<p>On the campaign trail, Trump said he would impose extra customs
duties on allies including the EU, as well as on China.</p>
<p>After his inauguration, Trump raised the possibility of imposing
25-percent tariffs on Canada and Mexico.</p>
<p>Von der Leyen reiterated her commitment to free trade during her
speech, pointing to recent EU deals with Switzerland, the South American
bloc Mercosur and Mexico.</p>
<p>She also said she and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi wanted to
“upgrade” their partnership.</p>
<p>Trump announced the United States’ withdrawal from the Paris climate
accord, which von de Leyen defended as the “best hope for all humanity”
and vowed: “Europe will stay the course.”</p>
<p>Ukraine is also keeping a very close eye on what Trump’s second
mandate will involve.</p>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is expected to call on world
leaders and company executives to maintain – and ramp up – their support
for his country’s war against Russia.</p>
<p>Zelensky said on Monday he was hopeful Trump would help achieve a
“just peace.”</p>
<p>Embattled German Chancellor Olaf Scholz was also to address the Davos
forum, likely his last as leader ahead of elections next month.</p>
<p>Also speaking on Tuesday will be conservative leader Friedrich Merz,
the favorite to succeed him as chancellor.</p>
<p>‘Better understand’ Trump</p>
<p>Middle East conflicts will likewise be high on the agenda as Israeli
President Isaac Herzog and Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin
Abdulrahman bin Jassim al-Thani speak in separate sessions during the
first full day of the forum.</p>
<p>As a fragile ceasefire holds in the Israel-Hamas war, the WEF will
host a discussion on how to improve aid delivery to the Palestinian
territory of Gaza and how to kickstart the reconstruction and recovery
after heavy bombardment.</p>
<p>Despite suggestions Trump’s return would overshadow the forum that
began on the same day as his inauguration in Washington, WEF President
Borge Brende said the US leader had brought fresh attention to the
gathering.</p>
<p>“It has increased the interest in Davos because people feel they need
to come together to better understand what’s on its way,” Brende told
AFP in an interview.</p>

foreign ministers meet in Washington in signal of Trump’s China
focus</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio will hit the ground
running on Tuesday, hosting a meeting in Washington of his counterparts
from Australia, India and Japan one day after President Donald Trump
started his second term in office.  </p>
<p>The meeting of the so-called “Quad,” four countries sharing concerns
about China’s growing power, will happen at the State Department and is
designed to signal that countering Beijing is a top priority for the new
president. </p>
<p>It could also set the stage for the leaders of the Quad countries to
hold a summit relatively early in the Trump presidency, a person
involved in the planning meetings said. </p>
<p>Trump officials were working on scheduling another gathering of the
foreign ministers at the White House as well, a person involved in
planning meetings said. </p>
<p>Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong, who met her Indian and
Japanese counterparts in Washington over the weekend, said the
invitation for Quad foreign ministers to attend Trump’s inauguration
showed a dedication to close cooperation in the Indo-Pacific
region. </p>
<p>“It’s a demonstration of the collective commitment of all countries
to the Quad, an iron-clad commitment in this time where close
cooperation in the Indo-Pacific is so important,” Wong said on Sunday of
the foreign ministers’ invitation to Washington. </p>
<p>Aside from the meeting itself, Republican Senator Marco Rubio, who
was confirmed on Monday as Trump’s top diplomat, is expected to meet
separately with the three foreign ministers on Tuesday. </p>
<p>The Quad grouping met many times during the administration of former
President Joe Biden, with a focus on Beijing’s military and economic
activities in the Indo-Pacific, particularly in the South China Sea
where U.S. allies have pushed back against Beijing’s territorial
claims.  </p>
<p>The grouping has also pledged to advance cooperation in cybersecurity
to protect supply chains and critical infrastructure, including undersea
cables. </p>
<p>For Australia, it will be important to secure an assurance from
Washington about the massive AUKUS defense project, designed to allow
Australia to acquire nuclear-powered attack submarines and other
advanced weapons such as hypersonic missiles. </p>
<p>China has denounced the Quad as a Cold War construct and says the
AUKUS alliance would intensify a regional arms race.</p>

Putin discusses ‘multipolar global order’ with China’s Xi hours after
Trump inauguration</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Moscow — Russian President Vladimir Putin had a call Tuesday with
Chinese President Xi Jinping, emphasizing the two countries’ close ties,
a day after Donald Trump was sworn in as the 47th U.S. president.</p>
<p>The two leaders have developed strong personal links that helped
bring relations between Moscow and Beijing, growing even closer after
Putin sent troops into Ukraine in 2022. China has become a major
customer of Russian oil and gas and a source of key technologies amid
sweeping Western sanctions on Moscow.</p>
<p>In Tuesday’s call with Xi, Putin emphasized that Russia-China
relations are based on shared interests, equality and mutual benefits,
noting that they “don’t depend on internal political factors and the
current international environment.”</p>
<p>“We jointly support the development of a more just multipolar global
order and work to ensure indivisible security in Eurasia and the world
as a whole,” Putin told Xi in remarks carried by the Russian state TV.
“Joint efforts by Russia and China play an important stabilizing role in
global affairs.”</p>
<p>Xi similarly praised close cooperation between Moscow and Beijing,
saying it helps “bring positive energy to reforming and developing the
global system.”</p>
<p>While neither leader directly mentioned Trump in the televised
fragment of their call, the timing of the conversation may signal that
Putin and Xi want to coordinate their action in dialogue with the new
U.S. administration.</p>
<p>The Chinese president had a call with Trump on Friday and expressed
hope for positive ties with the U.S.</p>
<p>Trump had threatened to impose tariffs and other measures against
China in his second term, while also hinting at ways in which the two
rival powers could cooperate on issues such as regional conflicts and
curbing the export of substances used in the production of fentanyl.</p>
<p>Putin, who is yet to talk to Trump, congratulated him on taking
office in televised remarks during a video call with officials and
welcomed his intention to open a dialogue with Moscow.</p>
<p>Trump told reporters Monday after taking office that Ukrainian
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had told him he wanted to make a peace
deal and voiced hope that Putin would follow suit. He added that Putin
would be destroying Russia by failing to make a deal, pointing out
Russia’s economic troubles, including high inflation.</p>
<p>Putin hailed Trump’s openness to dialogue as he spoke to Russia’s
Security Council members shortly before the U.S. president’s
inauguration.</p>
<p>“We hear the statements from Trump and members of his team about
their desire to restore direct contact with Russia, which were halted
through no fault of ours by the outgoing administration,” Putin said on
Monday. “We also hear his statements about the need to do everything to
prevent World War III. We certainly welcome such an approach and
congratulate the U.S. president-elect on taking office.”</p>
<p>The Russian leader also stressed that dialogue between the two
nations should be based on “equal basis and mutual respect, taking into
account the important role our countries play on some key issues on the
global agenda, including the strengthening of global stability and
security.”</p>
<p>Putin also noted that Moscow is open to dialogue with the Trump
administration on the conflict in Ukraine, emphasizing the need to
respect Russia’s interests and adding that “the most important thing is
to remove the root causes of the crisis.”</p>
<p>“As for the settlement of the situation, I would like to underline
that its goal should not be a short truce, not some kind of respite for
regrouping forces and rearmament with the aim of subsequently continuing
the conflict, but a long-term peace based on respect for the legitimate
interests of all people, all nations living in this region,” Putin
said.</p>

<h2 id="taliban-free-2-americans-in-prisoner-swap-with-us">Taliban free
2 Americans in prisoner swap with US</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Islamabad — Taliban authorities in Afghanistan announced Tuesday the
release of two American nationals as part of a prisoner exchange for one
of their members, who was held in the United States on
narcotics-terrorism charges.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Kabul identified the freed Afghan
as Khan Mohammad and described him as a “mujahid,” a term the Taliban
use for their fighters.</p>
<p>The statement said that the man was arrested nearly two decades ago
in the eastern Afghan province of Nangarhar and subsequently extradited
to the U.S., where a federal court convicted him, resulting in his
imprisonment for life in California.</p>
<p>The de facto Afghan government did not name the two freed American
citizens or specify how many had been freed, but relatives and U.S.
media reports identified them as Ryan Corbett, 42, and William Wallace
McKenty, 69.</p>
<p>“Today, our hearts are filled with overwhelming gratitude and praise
to God for sustaining Ryan’s life and bringing him back home after what
has been the most challenging and uncertain 894 days of our lives,” his
family stated Tuesday.</p>
<p>Limited public information is available about McKenty as his family
reportedly requested U.S. authorities to maintain his anonymity.</p>
<p>The prisoner exchange was in the making for many months and
reportedly occurred during Democratic President Joe Biden’s final hours
in office before Republican President Donald Trump was inaugurated on
Monday.</p>
<p>Corbett’s family statement praised both the Trump and Biden
administrations for their efforts to facilitate the prisoner
exchange.</p>
<p>The Taliban said Tuesday that Qatar played an “effective role” in
facilitating their prisoner swap agreement with the United States.</p>
<p>U.S. officials and relatives have reported that two other American
captives, George Glezmann, a former airline mechanic, and Mahmood
Habibi, a naturalized American, remain in Taliban custody in
Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Habibi and Glezmann were apprehended shortly after a U.S. drone
strike in July 2022 killed fugitive al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahri in
his hideout in an affluent Afghan capital neighborhood.</p>
<p>Glezmann, 65, was lawfully visiting Kabul as a tourist when he was
seized by the Taliban’s intelligence services without charge, his
relatives said.</p>
<p>Habibi’s family says he was arrested by the Taliban, along with 30
other employees of the company he worked at, following the U.S. drone
strike. While his co-workers were released, Habibi’s whereabouts remain
unknown, and Taliban officials have refuted claims that he is in their
custody.</p>
<p>“It was our hope that Ryan, George, and Mahmoud would be returned to
their families together, and we cannot imagine the pain that our good
fortune will bring them,” Corbett’s family stated Tuesday.</p>
<p>Habibi’s relatives welcomed the reunion of Corbett and McKenty with
their families, confident the Trump administration will intensify
efforts to secure his freedom from his “wrongful” detention.</p>
<p>“We have reason to be confident Mahmood is alive and in Taliban
custody, despite their hollow denials of holding him,” his brother Ahmad
Habibi stated,</p>
<p>Global Reach, a nonprofit working with the family of Mahmood Habibi
since his arrest, shared the family statement with VOA via email.</p>
<p>“While we are happy for Ryan and William, we are disappointed that
Mahmood was not included in the deal,” said the organization’s CEO
Mickey Bergman.</p>

<p>
President Trump began his first day back in office with a series of
executive orders aimed at undermining climate policy and unleashing
American energy production. He declared a
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/national-energy-emergency?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--smolkCoZsqqAC6STlg_1i3XqfbCnw0jjAbK7XaOGA5cL8DTtntrYOI13HD6fpxG6Au5Aj" target="_self">“national
energy emergency,”</a> describing an “active threat to the American
people from high energy prices.” The order directs agency leaders to
“exercise any lawful emergency authorities available to them, as well as
all other lawful authorities they may possess” to facilitate U.S. energy
production, including — but not limited to — activities on federal
lands. The stated goal of many of the policies put forward under this
energy emergency is to bring down energy costs for American consumers.
But few of them are designed to do so. Instead, they aim to do virtually
the opposite:

Heatmap’s Robinson Meyer</a>. “The United States is, at the moment,
producing more oil and gas than any country in world history. The fossil
fuel industry’s problem isn’t getting gas out of the ground, but finding
people to sell it to. By suspending fuel economy and energy efficiency
rules, Trump can force Americans to use more energy — and spend more on
oil and gas — to do the same amount of useful work.”

the federal government</a> to stop all permits for wind energy projects.
The order says the government “shall not issue new or renewed approvals,
rights of way, permits, leases, or loans for onshore or offshore wind
projects” pending a “comprehensive assessment” of the industry’s myriad
impacts on the economy, environment and other factors. The order also
opens the door to offshore wind developers potentially losing their
leases. This affects all offshore wind development in the U.S., as well
as wind projects on federal lands. The order specifically bans wind
energy development at the site sought after for the Lava Ridge wind
project in Idaho. The project was fully permitted days before the end of
Biden’s term. Shares in wind power companies dropped on the news.

<span></span>3. Trump withdraws from Paris Agreement again

<p>
As expected, Trump has

notified the United Nations</a> of America’s intent to withdraw from the
Paris Agreement, calling the accord a “one-sided rip-off.” “Leaving the
Paris Agreement is more symbolic than anything,”
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-leaves-paris-agreement?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--smolkCoZsqqAC6STlg_1i3XqfbCnw0jjAbK7XaOGA5cL8DTtntrYOI13HD6fpxG6Au5Aj" target="_self">writes
Heatmap’s Katie Brigham</a>. “Beyond the more nebulous — but very real —
loss of international leadership on climate issues, there’s no tangible
repercussions for exiting the agreement. Nor, as many party nations
consistently demonstrate, any legal recourse for staying in while
failing to meet targets or set sufficient goals.” It takes a full year
for withdrawal to become official. But Trump will almost certainly
henceforth act as if the U.S. is no longer bound by the treaty, which
has been adopted by nearly every other nation on Earth, in an effort to
keep global warming “well below” 2 degrees Celsius.

<p class="drop-caps">
Here we go: On Monday, Donald Trump was sworn in as the 47th president
of the United States.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>Surrounded by some of the country’s richest men, including
Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, and the oil magnate Harold Hamm, Trump
rejected what he called a “radical and corrupt establishment” that has
“extracted power and wealth from our citizens” while promising a new
golden age for the United States.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>At the center of that golden age, he said, was an almost
totally unregulated fossil fuel economy. “Today I will also declare a
national energy emergency,” he said. “We will drill, baby, drill.”
</p>
<p>
<span></span>Over the next 12 hours, he signed a series of executive
orders that relaxed protections across the oil and gas sector while
imposing costly new restrictions on wind turbines, electric vehicles,
and other forms of renewable energy. He demonstrated that his extreme
vision for the American government — a new order where the executive
reigns supreme and Congress does not control the power of the purse —
will run straight through his climate and energy policy.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>You could see in his actions, too, what could become
fragility in his governing coalition — times and situations where he
might too eagerly slap a cost on a friend because he believes they are a
foe.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>But all that remains in the future. For now, Trump is in
charge.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>Trump’s first day was about undermining climate policy in
virtually any form that he could find. Soon after taking the oath, Trump
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-leaves-paris-agreement" target="_self"><u>began
the process</u></a> of pulling the United States out of the Paris
Agreement on climate change. He
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/wind-executive-order-trump" target="_self"><u>announced</u></a>
a broad freeze on virtually all federal wind energy permits, throwing at
least one large-scale onshore wind farm into chaos while smothering
virtually all offshore wind energy projects, including several planned
for the East Coast. He moved to weaken energy and water efficiency rules
for lightbulbs, showerheads, washing machines, and dishwashers. He began
the multi-year process of rewriting the Environmental Protection
Agency’s rules on tailpipe pollution from cars and light trucks, which
he has described as lifting the federal government’s “EV mandate.” And
he promised to open up new tracts of federal land for oil and gas
drilling, including in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>But most important were a series of executive actions that
Trump signed in the late evening, many under the bearing of a “national
energy emergency.” In these orders, Trump told the Environmental
Protection Agency to study whether carbon dioxide and other greenhouse
gases are dangerous air pollutants. This question has been a matter of
settled science for decades — and, more importantly, has not been under
legal dispute since 2009. In the same set of orders, Trump lifted
federal environmental and permitting rules, potentially setting up a
move that could force blue states — particularly those in the Northeast
and West Coast — to accept new oil and gas pipelines and refineries.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>Finally, and most importantly, Trump asserted the right to
freeze virtually all ongoing federal spending under the Inflation
Reduction Act — <em><em>and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law</em></em>
— for 90 days. Even after this time elapses, funding programs will have
to be approved by the White House Office of Management and Budget. This
move places at least tens of millions of dollars of federal contracts at
risk, and it raises questions about the federal government’s ability to
operate as a reliable counterparty. It is also of dubious
Constitutionality because it appears to violate Congress’s sole
authority over federal spending.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>The stated goal of many of these policies is to bring down
energy costs for American consumers. The president’s national energy
emergency, for example, takes as its premise that the country is growing
its energy supply too slowly. The United States, it suggests, is at
imminent risk of running out of energy for new technology. (You might
ask yourself why — if this is the case — Trump has also frozen all
federal wind projects. But then you misunderstand Trump’s particular
genius.)
</p>
<p>
<span></span>Yet bringing down costs will be difficult. Energy costs —
and particularly <em><em>oil</em></em> costs — are already low. Today,
as Trump’s second term begins, gasoline stands at $3.13 a gallon,
<a href="https://gasprices.aaa.com/" target="_blank"><u>according to
AAA</u></a>. That’s about five cents above where it stood a year ago,
and it’s within
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=42435" target="_blank"><u>the
inflation-adjusted range</u></a> where gas prices hovered for much of
Trump’s first term. (Oil prices crashed in 2020 because of the pandemic,
but the industry — and the American public — would obviously prefer not
to repeat that debacle.)
</p>
<p>
<span></span>How much further could energy prices fall? Look at it this
way: A barrel of oil in the U.S. costs $76 today, per the West Texas
benchmark. (The international benchmark, called Brent, is a smidge
higher at $79.) Last year, oil producers across much of the Permian
Basin reported that they could break even only if oil
<a href="https://www.tgs.com/weekly-spotlight/2024-09-16" target="_blank"><u>stayed
at or above</u></a> about $66 a barrel. The
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=18651" target="_blank"><u>rough
rule of thumb</u></a> is that for a $1 change in the per-barrel oil
price, drivers will eventually see a roughly 2.5 cent change in prices
at the pump. You can see how hard it will be to push oil prices down to
record lows, at least with current levels of economic activity, interest
rates, and demand volumes.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>Which isn’t to say that it’s impossible. Trump will have
advantages when dealing with the oil and gas industry that his immediate
predecessor did not enjoy. Chief among these is that the industry’s
leaders like him, want to see him succeed, and will be more willing to
do favors for him — even if it means suffering thinner margins. These
may help keep a lid on electricity prices, which are far more sensitive
to natural gas and which really are set to surge as a new wave of
factories, EVs, and data centers comes online.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>Maybe! We’ll see. When you look closer, what stands out
about Trump’s policies is how few of them are designed to lower energy
prices. Instead, they aim to do virtually the opposite:
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/energy-oil/trump-oil-gas-policy-drilling-donors-3438e99e" target="_blank"><u>shore
up</u></a> oil and gas demand. According to <em><em>The Wall Street
Journal, </em></em>ensuring demand for oil and gas products — and not
deregulating drilling further — is what the industry has asked Trump to
do. That makes sense. The United States is, at the moment, producing
more oil and gas than any country in world history. The fossil fuel
industry’s problem isn’t <em><em>getting </em></em>gas out of the
ground, but finding people to sell it to. By suspending fuel economy and
energy efficiency rules, Trump can force Americans to use more energy —
and spend more on oil and gas — to do the same amount of useful work.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>In other places, what stands out about Trump’s policies is
their incoherence — and how few of his constituencies they will satisfy.
Late on Monday, Trump suggested that he might impose 25% tariffs on
Canada and Mexico as soon as February 1. Such an action would quickly
harm key segments of the American energy industry. Canada exports
<a href="https://www.cer-rec.gc.ca/en/data-analysis/energy-markets/market-snapshots/2024/market-snapshot-almost-all-canadian-crude-oil-exports-went-to-the-united-states-in-2023.html" target="_blank"><u>about
$124 billion of crude oil</u></a> to the United States every year — much
of it a heavy, sludgy petroleum from the Albertan oil sands. That sludge
is piped across North America, then
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=62664" target="_blank"><u>fed
into U.S. refineries</u></a>, where it helps produce a large portion of
America’s fuel supply. (Alberta’s heavy, sulfurous sludge is
particularly well-suited to mixing with the light, sweet crude produced
by American frackers.) Should Trump impose those tariffs, in other
words, he would gambol into a self-imposed energy crisis.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>Tariffs are not the only place where Trump could undermine
his own policies. One of his executive orders on Monday aimed to
establish America as “the leading producer and processor of non-fuel
minerals, including rare earth minerals”; three clauses later, it
announced an end to the federal government’s so-called “EV mandate.”
</p>
<p>
<span></span>But by kneecapping demand for electric vehicles, Trump will
hurt the critical minerals industry more than any anti-growth hippie
could fathom. For the past few years, corporate America and Wall Street
have invested billions of dollars in lithium and rare-earths mining and
processing facilities across the country. These projects, which are
largely in Republican districts, only make financial sense in a world
where the United States produces a large and growing number of electric
vehicles: EVs make up the lion’s share of future demand for lithium,
rare earth elements, and other geostrategically sensitive rocks, and any
mines or refining facilities will only pencil out in a world where EVs
purchase their output. If Trump kills the non-Tesla part of the EV
industry, then he will also mortally harm those projects’ economics.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>Energy is a strange issue. Although it is one of the key
inputs into the modern industrial economy, millions of Americans engage
with it as an expressive, symbolic matter — as just another battleground
in the culture war. Today, Donald Trump has become the most powerful
American in that category. On his first day in office, he has
demonstrated that he will use energy policy to advance his extreme ideas
about how the Constitution and presidential authority works. How far he
gets now will depend on what the American public, business leaders,
congressional Republicans, and the Supreme Court’s arch-conservative
majority will accept — and whether his fragile constituency is really
ready to pay the costs of “American greatness.”

leaves office and Washington after 50 years but says ‘we’re not leaving
the fight’</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Joe Biden on Monday wrapped up a more than 50-year
political career, but promised that “we’re not leaving the fight,” as he
bid farewell to the presidency and flew to California to unwind with his
family and ease back into private life.</p>
<p>Biden spoke not long after watching his successor, Republican
President Donald Trump, pledge during his inaugural address to
“completely and totally reverse” everything that his Democratic
predecessor did.</p>
<p>In the final hours before the noontime transfer of executive power,
Biden extended courtesies to the man he had turned out of the Oval
Office four years ago. Trump denied losing the 2020 election and refused
to offer similar niceties to Biden upon his inauguration in 2021.</p>
<p>The bitter cold day opened with Biden and his wife, Jill, receiving
Trump, and his wife, Melania, for a traditional Inauguration Day
meet-and-greet over tea at the White House.</p>
<p>“Welcome home,” Biden told Trump.</p>
<p>Afterward, the rivals, who share a history of political animosity,
rode in a limousine to the Capitol where Trump was sworn in as the 47th
president.</p>
<p>“Our recent election is a mandate to completely and totally reverse a
horrible betrayal,” Trump said about the work of the Biden
administration. Biden sat expressionless in the front row.</p>
<p>As Trump gave his address, the residence staff at the White House got
to work clearing out the remainder of Biden’s belongings so they could
move Trump and his family back in. The work of turning over the White
House includes redecorating the Oval Office.</p>
<p>Walls in the press offices that were bare in the morning after most
of the staff had ended their government service were decorated by
midafternoon with fresh photographs of Trump.</p>
<p>After Trump’s address, the new president and his wife walked the
Bidens outside to a Marine helicopter that had been waiting on the
Capitol grounds to fly them to Joint Base Andrews for a farewell event
with his staff.</p>
<p>“We couldn’t have done anything we did without you,” Biden told those
who worked for his administration in the White House. “No president gets
to choose the moment they enter history, but they get to choose the team
they enter history with, and we chose the best damn team in the
world.”</p>
<p>Even though they may feel “knocked down” by the turn of events, he
said what was important was how quickly they get back up.</p>
<p>“We’re leaving office. We’re not leaving the fight,” Biden said,
urging them to stay engaged.</p>
<p>And he appeared to joke about Trump’s speech, chuckling as he said,
“we heard the inaugural address today. We got a lot more to do.” Biden
then made the sign of the cross and everyone laughed.</p>
<p>He and the first lady then walked across the tarmac to the familiar
blue-and-white Air Force plane he flew on as president for the flight to
Santa Ynez, California.</p>

brace for ‘dangerous’ windy, dry conditions in southern California</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Fire authorities in southern California positioned crews and
equipment ready to respond Tuesday to new wildfires as forecasters
warned of dangerous fire conditions featuring dry air and strong
winds.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service said the particular window of concern
was through late morning Tuesday, with the possibility of wind gusts
reaching 160 kilometers per hour in areas to the north and northwest of
downtown Los Angeles.</p>
<p>“Everyone needs to be on high alert,” Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass
said Monday.</p>
<p>California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire)
spokesperson Brice Bennett said in a statement Monday that his agency —
with help from federal, local and tribal firefighting agencies — have
more than 2,500 people and has prepositioned equipment for quick
deployment to combat any new outbreaks.</p>
<p>At least 27 people have died in a series of wildfires across the Los
Angeles area during the past two weeks as Santa Ana winds mixed with dry
conditions on the ground to quickly spread blazes.</p>
<p>The two largest fires are still burning, including the Palisades Fire
near the coast on the western side of Los Angeles and the Eaton Fire in
the foothills to the north of the city.</p>
<p>The Palisades Fire was 61% contained and has burned about 96 square
kilometers, according to Cal Fire. The Eaton Fire was 87% contained
after burning 57 square kilometers.</p>
<p>Together, the fires have destroyed 14,000 structures since
Jan. 7.</p>
<p>California Governor Gavin Newsom issued an executive order Monday
designed to protect Southern California residents from landslides and
flooding. The order suspends some rules and regulations and speeds up
the removal of debris that, if not removed promptly, could result in
landslides, mudslides and flash floods.</p>
<p>“This order helps keep our emergency response focused on protecting
communities, not permits and paperwork,” Newsom said.</p>

id="trump-orders-include-withdrawing-from-who-halting-us-foreign-aid">Trump
orders include withdrawing from WHO, halting US foreign aid</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump issued a series of executive actions
after taking office Monday, including moving to withdraw from
international health and climate bodies and directing a suspension of
U.S. foreign aid.</p>
<p>A set of orders focused on immigration, such as declaring an
emergency on the U.S.-Mexico border, ending asylum and halting
birthright citizenship for some children born in the United States.</p>
<p>Trump also ordered vetting and screening “to the maximum degree
possible” all those who want to enter the United States, and for the
government to identify countries that may have screening procedures
deficient enough to warrant blocking their nationals from entering the
United States.</p>
<p>In his first term in office, Trump pursued an “America First” form of
foreign policy, and an order he signed Monday directs new Secretary of
State Marco Rubio to focus State Department efforts on that mission.</p>
<p>“From this day forward, the foreign policy of the United States shall
champion core American interests and always put America and American
citizens first,” the order said.</p>
<p>Trump ordered the United States to withdraw from the 2015 Paris
climate accord, a repeat of a move he also made in his first term. Trump
said the U.S. has a successful record of “advancing both economic and
environmental objectives” that should be a model to other countries.</p>
<p>Nearly 200 countries signed the agreement aimed at limiting global
warming with each country providing its own plan for limiting greenhouse
gas emissions that contribute to climate change.</p>
<p>In another repeat from his first time in office, Trump ordered the
United States to withdraw from the World Health Organization due to
complaints that the agency mismanaged the COVID-19 pandemic and gets too
much funding from the U.S.</p>
<p>WHO said in a statement Tuesday it “regrets” Trump’s announcement and
that it looks forward to constructive talks to maintain a partnership
with the United States “for the benefit of the health and well-being of
millions of people around the globe.”</p>
<p>“For over seven decades, WHO and the USA have saved countless lives
and protected Americans and all people from health threats,” WHO said.
“Together, we ended smallpox, and together we have brought polio to the
brink of eradication. American institutions have contributed to and
benefited from membership in WHO.”</p>
<p>Calling U.S. foreign aid “not aligned with American interests,” Trump
issued an order to pause foreign development assistance for 90 days and
for the programs to undergo reviews.</p>
<p>Funding for many programs has already been appropriated by Congress,
so it was not clear how much aid would be initially affected by the
order.</p>
<p>Trump also reversed an order signed by former President Joe Biden
last week that had removed Cuba from the list of state sponsors of
terror.</p>
<p>Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel responded to Trump’s move Monday by
calling it “an act of arrogance and disregard for the truth.”</p>
<p>On trade, Trump issued an order calling for a review of a number of
trade agreements, including one with China and the U.S.-Mexico-Canada
Agreement.</p>
<p>He also specifically called for an assessment of “unlawful migration
and fentanyl flows” from Canada, Mexico and China. Ahead of taking
office, Trump said those countries would need to act on those areas in
order to avoid tariffs on goods sent to the United States.</p>
<p>In response to a law passed during Biden’s term that would have
blocked TikTok in the United States in connection with national security
concerns, Trump signed an order telling the Justice Department not to
enforce that ban until his administration can “determine the appropriate
course forward.”</p>
<p>The law directed a TikTok ban unless its China-based parent company
sold it to an approved buyer. U.S. officials promoting the ban expressed
concerns that the Chinese government could obtain Americans’ digital
data.</p>
<p>Trump himself tried to carry out a similar ban during his first term,
but in recent weeks has championed keeping TikTok available to U.S.
users, including the potential for the U.S. government to acquire a
stake in the company.</p>

<h2 id="trump-supporters-celebrate-pardon-of-jan.-6-rioters">Trump
supporters celebrate pardon of Jan. 6 rioters</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The atmosphere was celebratory outside the Central
Detention Facility prison in Washington late Monday night.</p>
<p>Just hours after taking the oath of office, U.S. President Donald
Trump pardoned about 1,500 people who participated in the Jan. 6, 2021,
attack on the U.S. Capitol, during which Trump supporters tried to
overturn the results of the 2020 election.</p>
<p>Many of them were held in the Central Detention Facility in southeast
Washington. Despite the frigid cold, their supporters gathered outside
the building, looking forward to what they told VOA they hoped would be
their speedy release. As of publication, that release had not happened
yet.</p>
<p>The police presence outside the prison was substantial throughout the
night. So, too, was the media presence. And even though supporters at
one point briefly rushed the prison entrance, only to be blocked by
police, they still told VOA that the gathering was joyous and
patriotic.</p>
<p>While brandishing an American flag, Ben Pollock told VOA that two of
his children — Olivia and Jonathan — were jailed for taking part in the
attack. He said he himself was present that day, too, but that he didn’t
enter the Capitol Building.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Pollock, from Florida, said he was “ecstatic, praising God” that his
children would be released soon. “It’s been such a spiritual
journey.”</p>
<p>Former fugitives Olivia and Jonathan Pollock are charged with
assaulting, resisting or impeding certain officers, as well as theft of
government property, according to media reports. The latter is accused
of grabbing an officer by the waist and pulling the officer down a set
of stairs, and punching another officer in the face.</p>
<p>Their father cried as he talked about Jan. 6 — not because he
regretted that day, which he didn’t, but because he said he felt so
deeply that those who were jailed for participating in the attack had
been unfairly prosecuted.</p>
<p>“It’s broken my heart for four years. I’ve cried and cried and cried
over these families,” Pollock said. “Today is their day of freedom.”</p>
<p>Pollock and others who spoke with VOA said they felt like Trump’s
executive order meant that they were finally getting vindication for
Jan. 6.</p>
<p>For them, Trump’s pardon confirmed their belief that the 2020
election was rigged, they told VOA. It also represented the fulfillment
of a promise that Trump had made during his campaign to absolve those
who took part in the attack, they said.</p>
<p>Numerous reports and investigations have shown that the 2020 election
was not stolen. Election officials have confirmed the election was
secure, and Trump and his allies have failed to produce any evidence to
substantiate the allegations of fraud.</p>
<p>Despite the evidence that the election was not stolen, several people
outside the prison told VOA that Trump’s pardon reinforced their belief
that it actually had been.</p>
<p>“The election was stolen. We all see it. The whole world saw it,”
Stephanie Liu, from New York told VOA.</p>
<p>Liu, who was present at the Capitol on Jan. 6, said she has come to
the prison every month for the past two-and-a-half years to visit the
imprisoned Jan. 6 rioters. “Political prisoners should not exist in this
country,” said Liu, who is originally from China.</p>
<p>Helena Gibson, from the U.S. capital, made a similar point: “This has
been four long years of these Jan. 6 political hostages.”</p>
<p>That language echoes Trump, who calls those who stormed the Capitol
“hostages” and “unbelievable patriots.”</p>
<p>One day after the attack, Trump said that “those who broke the law”
during the riot would “pay.” But defending them ended up becoming a
significant component of his 2024 presidential campaign.</p>
<p>Tom Jeffries, from Virginia, said he was “somewhat disappointed” that
Trump didn’t mention the Jan. 6 defendants during his inaugural
address.</p>
<p>“But knowing him, I knew that he hadn’t forgotten about it. He was
waiting for the right time to do it,” Jeffries told VOA. “That was my
hope, and God granted my wish.”</p>
<p>Trump’s decision to pardon those who took part in the attack was met
with swift condemnation from Democrat lawmakers like Senator Chris
Murphy.</p>
<p>By pardoning the rioters, “Trump has transformed American democracy,”
Murphy said in a post on X. “Political violence is now mainstream.”</p>
<p>Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer also said those who invaded
the Capitol should not have been pardoned.</p>
<p>“Trump is ushering in a Golden Age for people that break the law and
attempt to overthrow the government,” Schumer said in a statement.</p>

<h2 id="starry-sundance-fest-moves-ahead-in-wake-of-la-fires">Starry
Sundance fest moves ahead in wake of LA fires</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Los Angeles — The U.S. film industry’s first big gathering since
fires devastated Los Angeles will begin Thursday at the Sundance
festival, where highlights include a glitzy new Jennifer Lopez musical
and a dark Benedict Cumberbatch drama.</p>
<p>Hollywood’s annual pilgrimage to the Rocky Mountains to premiere the
coming year’s most-anticipated indie films is taking place in somber
circumstances, after the blazes that killed at least 27 people and
brought the entertainment capital to a halt.</p>
<p>Festival chiefs held lengthy talks with filmmakers, including those
“who lost homes or were displaced” by the blazes, before deciding to
press ahead, said Sundance director Eugene Hernandez.</p>
<p>Organizers heard “harrowing stories of people running out of their
homes, evacuating… with their hard drives under their arms” to ensure
their films survived, he told AFP.</p>
<p>“Everybody to a person just wants to look forward and wants to look
ahead… it’ll be a nice moment of reunion and community.”</p>
<p>Among the 88 features being screened in Utah’s Park City is
“Rebuilding,” about a rancher who loses everything in a wildfire.</p>
<p>“It takes on an added poignance, for those who will watch it next
week,” said Hernandez.</p>
<p>Josh O’Connor, known for “The Crown” and “Challengers,” plays the
lead role. </p>
<p>“It’s an incredible film, and one that we felt was important to show,
based on that spirit of resilience,” said Sundance programming director
Kim Yutani.</p>
<p>“I think it will be a particularly moving one for people to see.”</p>
<p>J-Lo, Cumberbatch</p>
<p>A-lister Lopez brings her first film to Sundance, with “Kiss of the
Spider Woman.”</p>
<p>From “Dreamgirls” director Bill Condon, the film is based on the
Broadway adaptation of Argentine author Manuel Puig’s famous novel.</p>
<p>Lopez plays Aurora, a silver-screen diva whose life and roles are
discussed by two mismatched prisoners as they form an unlikely bond in
their grim cell. </p>
<p>While harking back to grand Golden Age Hollywood musicals with its
fabulous costumes and Lopez’s “knockout musical performance,” the film
is a more dramatic and independent take on the genre, said
Hernandez.</p>
<p>Cumberbatch stars in another literary adaptation, “The Thing With
Feathers,” based on Max Porter’s experimental and poetic novel about a
grieving husband and two young sons.</p>
<p>“It’s one of these juicy roles that big actors relish taking a bite
out of,” said Yutani.</p>
<p>Family tragedy and fatherhood are also the themes of “Omaha,” with
John Magaro (“Past Lives”) delivering “an emotional gut punch of a role”
that could spell awards, according to Yutani.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Olivia Colman plays a mother taking her non-binary teen to
visit their gay grandfather (John Lithgow) in “Jimpa.”</p>
<p>Rapper A$AP Rocky and late-night host Conan O’Brien make up the
eclectic cast of mystery “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You.”</p>
<p>And “The Bear” star Ayo Edebiri teams up with John Malkovich for
thriller “Opus,” about a young writer investigating the mysterious
disappearance of a legendary pop star.</p>
<p>Music, politics</p>
<p>Music is also a prominent theme of Sundance’s documentary selection,
which has launched several of the most recent Oscar-winning non-fiction
films.</p>
<p>A new “must-see” Jeff Buckley documentary features never-before-seen
footage from “three very important women in his life, including his
mother,” said Yutani.</p>
<p>Elegance Bratton explores the Chicago roots of house music with “Move
Ya Body: The Birth of House,” while Oscar-winning director Questlove
examines funk pioneer Sly Stone in “Sly Lives! (aka The Burden of Black
Genius).”</p>
<p>Politics will again be prominent.</p>
<p>Former New Zealand leader Jacinda Ardern is expected in town to
promote behind-the-scenes documentary “Prime Minister.”</p>
<p>“The Jinx” director Andrew Jarecki explores violence and corruption
in the U.S. prison system with “The Alabama Solution.” </p>
<p>And, days after the Gaza ceasefire agreement took effect,
Palestinian-American director Cherien Dabis will unveil her
“groundbreaking” new film “All That’s Left of You,” which has been given
a highly prominent Saturday evening premiere at Sundance’s biggest
venue.</p>
<p>“That is not an accident. This is a really special one,” said
Yutani.</p>
<p>“I have not seen a film about a Palestinian family told in quite this
way.”</p>
<p>The 2025 Sundance Film Festival runs from Jan. 23 through Feb. 2.</p>

<h2 id="trump-issues-sweeping-pardon-of-1500-jan.-6-defendants">Trump
issues sweeping pardon of 1,500 Jan. 6 defendants</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Monday pardoned more than
1,500 of his supporters charged with crimes in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack
on the U.S. Capitol, including people who assaulted police, using his
clemency powers on his first day in office to dismantle the largest
investigation and prosecution in Justice Department history.</p>
<p>Among those set to be released from prison are defendants captured on
camera committing violent attacks on law enforcement as lawmakers met to
certify President Joe Biden’s 2020 election victory. Leaders of the Oath
Keepers and Proud Boys extremist groups convicted of seditious
conspiracy in the most serious cases brought by the Justice Department
will also be freed from prison after having their sentences
commuted.</p>
<p>Trump is directing the attorney general to seek the dismissal of
about 450 pending Jan. 6 cases.</p>
<p>The pardons were expected after Trump’s yearslong campaign to rewrite
the history of the Jan. 6 attack that left more than 100 police officers
injured and threatened the peaceful transfer of power. Yet the scope of
the clemency still comes as a massive blow to the Justice Department’s
effort to hold participants accountable over what has been described as
one of the darkest days in American history.</p>
<p>Trump had suggested in the weeks leading up to his return to the
White House that instead of blanket pardons he was going to look at the
Jan. 6 defendants on a case-by-case basis. Vice President JD Vance had
said just days ago that people responsible for the violence during the
Capitol riot “obviously” should not be pardoned.</p>
<p>Casting the rioters as “patriots” and “hostages,” Trump has claimed
they were unfairly treated by the Justice Department that also charged
him with federal crimes in two cases he contends were politically
motivated. Trump said the pardons end “a grave national injustice that
has been perpetrated upon the American people over the last four years
and begins a process of national reconciliation.”</p>
<p>An attorney for Enrique Tarrio, the former national chairman of the
Proud Boys who was sentenced to 22 years in prison for seditious
conspiracy, said he expects his client to be released from prison Monday
night. Tarrio, who was convicted of orchestrating a failed plot to keep
Donald Trump in power after the Republican lost the 2020 election, is
serving the longest sentence of any of the Jan. 6 defendants.</p>
<p>The pardons come weeks after Trump’s own Jan. 6 case was dismissed
because of the Justice Department’s policy against prosecuting sitting
presidents.</p>
<p>Hundreds of Jan. 6 defendants who didn’t engage in any of the
violence and destruction were charged with misdemeanor trespassing
offenses, and many of those served little to no time behind bars.</p>
<p>But the violence that day has been documented extensively through
videos, testimony and other evidence showing rioters — some armed with
poles, bats and bear spray — swarming the Capitol, quickly overrunning
overwhelmed police, shattering windows and sending lawmakers and aides
running into hiding.</p>
<p>Police were dragged into the crowd and beaten. One officer screamed
in pain as he was crushed in a doorframe, and another suffered a heart
attack after a rioter pressed a stun gun against his neck and repeatedly
shocked him. Officers have described in testimony fearing for their
lives as members of the mob hurled insults and obscenities at them.</p>
<p>Of the more than 1,500 people charged, about 250 people have been
convicted of crimes by a judge or a jury after a trial. At least 1,020
had pleaded guilty to crimes as of Jan. 1. Only two people were
acquitted of all charges by judges after bench trials. No jury has fully
acquitted a Capitol riot defendant.</p>
<p>More than 1,000 rioters have already been sentenced, with over 700
receiving at least some time behind bars. The rest were given some
combination of probation, community service, home detention or
fines.</p>

<h2 id="in-day-steeped-with-tradition-donald-trump-is-sworn-in">In day
steeped with tradition, Donald Trump is sworn in</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Amid frigid temperatures in the nation’s capital, the
peaceful transfer of power from one presidential administration to the
next took place Monday.</p>
<p>The inauguration events, starting with a church service and
culminating in an oath and inaugural speech at the Capitol building,
were attended by former presidents and their families, foreign
dignitaries, and tech billionaires.</p>
<p>Members of the “press pool” — a group of reporters, photographers and
video journalists — were on hand to capture the day’s events for the
media outlets that make up the White House Correspondents’
Association.</p>
<p>Through the press pool, accredited journalists take turns covering
the president’s daily activities to ensure 24-7 coverage of the American
leader. VOA White House correspondent Misha Komadovsky was assigned to
Monday morning’s inaugural events.</p>
<p>“Today, I’ll be your eyes and ears during the first steps of Donald
Trump’s inauguration,” Komadovsky emailed at around 8 a.m. local time as
part of his assignments.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The pool report had noted that the inaugural events were to follow a
traditional course: a morning church service and a meeting between the
outgoing and incoming first families before traveling to the
inauguration.</p>
<p>The service at St. John’s Episcopal Church in Lafayette Park across
from the White House has been a part of inauguration events since 1933,
when Franklin D. Roosevelt attended a service before being sworn in as
the 32nd president.</p>
<p>Trump, as the 47th U.S. president, followed in his predecessors’
footsteps. He and first lady Melania Trump sat in the front row of the
church, alongside his vice president, JD Vance, and second lady Usha
Vance.</p>
<p>Melania Trump wore a navy suit by New York-based designer Adam
Lippes, paired with a wide-brimmed hat by American designer, Eric
Javits.</p>
<p>Dressing the first lady was an honor, Javits said, adding that his
background in art has informed his ability to bring “harmony and balance
to the face” with his designs.</p>
<p>In Melania Trump’s case, he told the AP, the designing was not
difficult because the first lady is “blessed with great bone structure,
beauty and a wonderful sense of style.”</p>
<p>Also attending Monday’s service — which took place the same day that
the U.S. marks Martin Luther King Jr. Day — were members of the Trump
family, including his children Donald Jr., Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany and
Barron Trump. Individuals whom the president has nominated for key roles
in his administration also filled the pews, including Robert F. Kennedy
Jr., Pete Hegseth, Pam Bondi, Kash Patel and Marco Rubio.</p>
<p>Foreign dignitaries were also present. Leaders seen by the press pool
included President Javier Milei of Argentina, Prime Minister Giorgia
Meloni of Italy, and Britain’s former Conservative Party prime minister
Boris Johnson.</p>
<p>Some of the world’s richest individuals were also there, including
Elon Musk of Tesla, social media platform X, and SpaceX; Apple CEO Tim
Cook; and media tycoon Rupert Murdoch.</p>
<p>TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew attended the service, as did media
personality Tucker Carlson.</p>
<p>TikTok had briefly gone offline Saturday evening following a U.S.
Supreme Court ruling upholding a law ordering the Chinese social media
platform to sell to an American owner. Trump indicated he planned a
“joint venture” to allow TikTok to operate.</p>
<p>Service was restored on Sunday, with a message to users that said
that “as a result of President Trump’s efforts, TikTok is back in the
U.S.”</p>
<p>Trump’s former lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who earlier this month was held
in contempt of court twice over a defamation case stemming from Trump’s
failed 2020 election, was also spotted at the service.</p>
<p>Giuliani last Thursday settled the $148 million defamation judgment
granted to two election workers in the U.S. state of Georgia.</p>
<p>During Monday’s 25-minute church service, the choir sang “America the
Beautiful.” After the service concluded, Trump walked down the aisle,
greeting guests along the way. He was seen patting Milei of Argentina on
the shoulder.</p>
<p>Next, keeping with tradition, outgoing President Joe Biden and first
lady Dr. Jill Biden met with the incoming president and first lady at
the White House.</p>
<p>The First Families shared tea in the White House Blue Room before
departing together for the U.S. Capitol.</p>
<p>Because of extreme cold weather, the inauguration was held inside the
Capitol rotunda, with music from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln
Combined Choir and the U.S. Marine Band. Opera singer Christopher D.
Macchio sang “Oh, America!” and singer Carrie Underwood performed
“America the Beautiful” with the Armed Forces Chorus and U.S. Naval
Academy Glee Club.</p>
<p>Former Presidents George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama were
on hand for the inauguration, along with many members of the church
service congregation and the Trump family, as faith leaders offered
prayers.</p>
<p>Tech billionaires including Musk, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Meta’s Mark
Zuckerberg and Google CEO Sundar Pichai were spotted at the
inauguration, alongside the president’s supporters and U.S.
lawmakers.</p>
<p>Chief Justice John Roberts swore in the 47th president, on a Bible
held by Melania Trump. The president was flanked by his children.</p>
<p>Following the oath of office, a luncheon took place, followed by a
military troop review and parade.</p>
<p>As the ceremonial swearing in took place, new staffers at the White
House were seen moving into their new offices and unpacking images of
the president and first lady.</p>

<p>
Secretary of State Marco Rubio focused on Chinese mineral dominance as a
national security threat in his confirmation hearing earlier this
month,<a href="https://x.com/ErnestScheyder/status/1879580327456526419" target="_blank">
<u>telling the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that China has</u></a>
“come to dominate the critical mineral supplies throughout the world …
Even those who want to see more electric cars, no matter where you make
them, those batteries are almost entirely dependent on the ability of
the Chinese and the willingness of the Chinese Communist Party to
produce it and export it to you.”
</p>
<p>
<span></span>The German Marshall
Fund<a href="https://www.gmfus.org/news/chinas-role-critical-mineral-supply-chains" target="_blank">
<u>has estimated</u></a> that China makes up 60% of the supply of
critical minerals and 85% of the processing capacity. The United States
Geological Survey’s list of 50 critical minerals includes commonly used
metals like aluminum, as well as a number of metals and minerals crucial
for batteries and green energy technology like cobalt, lithium,
graphite, and manganese.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>While new reserves of lithium are constantly being
discovered, China dominates refining of the metal, with 60% market share
for refining battery-grade
lithium,<a href="https://www.spglobal.com/commodity-insights/en/news-research/latest-news/metals/092324-factbox-chinas-lithium-industry-eyes-output-cuts-to-shore-up-market-sentiment#:~:text=Globally%2C%20China%20ranks%20ninth%20in,bearing%20on%20the%20global%20market." target="_blank">
<u>according to S&amp;P.</u></a> And the Trump administration’s interest
in critical minerals may not be limited to the (current) boundaries of
the United States; it is also one reason why the president is so
interested in Greenland, which likely has
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-greenland-minerals-rare-earth" target="_self"><u>massive
stores of rare earth metals</u></a>, including uranium.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>In the executive order “Unleashing American Energy,”
President Trump called for agency heads and relevant Cabinet officials
to “identify all agency actions that impose undue burdens on the
domestic mining and processing of non-fuel minerals and undertake steps
to revise or rescind such actions,” along with specifically directing
the secretary of Energy and the secretary of the Interior to make
“efforts to accelerate the ongoing, detailed geologic mapping of the
United States,” and “ensure that critical mineral projects, including
the processing of critical minerals, receive consideration for Federal
support,” respectively.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>He also directed Cabinet officials not directly involved
with energy and resources policy to lend their weight to the American
critical mineral effort.The United States trade representative and
secretary of Commerce were tasked with looking at overseas critical
mineral projects to see if they’re “unlawful or unduly burden or
restrict United States commerce” and to examine “the national security
implications of the Nation’s mineral reliance and the potential for
trade action,” indicating that Trump
administration<a href="https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/Section%20301%20Modifications%20Determination%20FRN%20(Sept%2012%202024)%20(FINAL).pdf" target="_blank">
<u>may likely continue a version of the Biden administration’s tariffs
and restrictions on imports of Chinese critical minerals</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>Critical minerals also showed up in
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/declaring-a-national-energy-emergency/" target="_blank"><u>executive
orders</u></a> where President Trump
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/national-energy-emergency" target="_self"><u>declared
a “national energy emergency”</u></a> and an order specific to resource
exploitation in Alaska. In the emergency declaration, minerals were
included alongside energy as areas whose “identification, leasing,
development, production, transportation, refining, and generation
capacity of the United States are all far too inadequate to meet our
Nation’s needs.” In the Alaska order, “Unleashing Alaska’s Extraordinary
Resource Potential,” minerals were listed alongside “energy, timber, and
seafood,” as the “abundant and largely untapped supply of natural
resources” that the state possesses, even as the order was largely
specific to oil and gas projects like liquefied natural gas and oil
drilling.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>The Trump administration’s interest in critical minerals is
not unique. The Biden Administration also pursued a domestic critical
minerals policy,
including<a href="https://www.blm.gov/press-release/major-lithium-mine-approved-nevada-latest-effort-support-domestic-supply-critical" target="_blank">

<h2 id="trump-lays-out-vision-on-first-day-of-second-term-1">Trump lays
out vision on first day of second term</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>White House — On the historic first day of his second term in office,
President Donald Trump laid out his vision for a bolder — and larger —
United States.</p>
<p>“The United States will once again consider itself a growing nation,
one that increases our wealth, expands our territory, builds our cities,
raises our expectations, and carries our flag into new and beautiful
horizons,” he said in his inaugural address Monday. “And we will pursue
our manifest destiny into the stars, launching American astronauts to
plant the Stars and Stripes on the planet Mars.”</p>
<p>Then he got to work signing a stack of executive orders. He said they
included a declaration of a national emergency at the southern border
that would allow the deployment of troops, and a national energy
emergency that would allow more domestic oil and gas extraction. He also
declared that there are only two genders, male and female, and said he
would order that the Gulf of Mexico be renamed the Gulf of America.</p>
<p>Historians say that Trump made history on his second Day 1 by using
what is historically a unifying speech to portray a future that many
Americans may disagree with.</p>
<p>“Donald Trump did not do that. This was one of the most partisan
presidential inaugural speeches — it was less an inaugural speech and
more a State of the Union. He just listed a series of bullet points of
projects he wanted to undertake, from deporting immigrants to seizing
back the Panama Canal,” said Jeremi Suri, a history professor at the
University of Texas at Austin.</p>
<p>Shortly after his inaugural speech, Trump spoke to a smaller group of
supporters at the Capitol and reiterated claims that the 2020 election
was “totally rigged” — a claim without proof. He also pardoned some of
those convicted over the violent events of Jan. 6, 2021, when a mob of
Trump supporters attempted to disrupt the certification of the election
Trump lost.</p>
<p>“I think this was a better speech than the one I made upstairs, OK?”
Trump said.</p>
<p>Some of Trump’s powerful supporters expressed their joy.</p>
<p>Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk was among the billionaires who packed
into the Capitol for the ceremony and hailed Trump’s victory. After
Trump was sworn in, Musk took to the stage of the rally at Capital One
Arena to praise him.</p>
<p>“This was no ordinary victory,” he said. “This was a fork in the road
of human civilization.”</p>
<p>Consumer advocacy groups are sounding alarms about some of the new
president’s quieter moves, ones they say seek to loosen regulations and
benefit the extremely wealthy.</p>
<p>“When we think about why the incoming Trump administration wants to
freeze regulations and halt public protections wholesale, it is at the
behest of the wealthiest among us, corporate special interests,” said
Lisa Gilbert, co-president of the nonprofit consumer advocacy
organization Public Citizen. “They are who benefits when we don’t have
guardrails on the books.”</p>
<p>Trump did not, on Monday, directly address foreign policy concerns
such as Ukraine and competition with China — but Suri said his
expansionist rhetoric sent a message.</p>
<p>“It’s hard for the United States to tell [Russian President] Vladimir
Putin or [Chinese President] Xi Jinping that they should not seek
expansion when our president is talking about expansion, but insofar as
we don’t follow through on that rhetoric, we still are on very strong
ground to say that invading your neighbor, as Putin has in Ukraine, or
as China might potentially do in Taiwan, that is verboten, that crosses
the line, so long as it’s just words from us,” he said. “If we were to
go to war to try to seize the Panama Canal, that would certainly give a
kind of carte blanche to Putin and Xi Jinping, because they make the
same arguments for Ukraine and Taiwan.”</p>

former President Joe Biden’s
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/mar/20/biden-car-transportation-emission-regulation-pollution#:~:text=The%20rule%2C%20which%20calls%20for,Biden%20said%20in%20a%20statement." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>tailpipe

<a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-proposes-strongest-ever-pollution-standards-cars-and" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>aimed</u></a>
to “accelerate the ongoing transition to a clean vehicles future and
tackle the climate crisis.”
</p>
<p>
As part of his “Unleashing American Energy” executive order, signed
Monday night in the Oval Office, Trump specifically demanded the
elimination of “the electric vehicle mandate,” ordered a “level
regulatory playing field for consumer choice in vehicles,” and directed
the termination of “state emission waivers that function to limit sales
of gasoline-powered automobiles,” as well as the elimination of “unfair
subsidies … that favor EVs.”
</p>
<p>
Though the finer details of how this will be implemented aren’t clear in
the executive order, there has never been an actual electric vehicle
mandate. The rules under Biden’s Environmental Protection Agency would
have required a gradual reduction in fleetwide average carbon emissions
by up to 56% by 2032. To meet that goal, electric vehicles would have
needed to make up 35% to 56% of new car sales by 2032,
<a href="https://insideevs.com/news/747199/ev-top-10-sales-2024/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>up
from 8% in 2024</u></a>. According to the Biden administration, the rule
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-finalizes-strongest-ever-pollution-standards-cars-position" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>would
have cut</u></a> more than 7 billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions
through 2055, or “roughly equal to four times the emissions of the
entire transportation sector in 2021.”
</p>
<p>
Trump’s executive order also appeared to target the Biden
administration’s fuel economy standards. Back in June, the Department of
Transportation’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration issued a
rule that raised the fleetwide average fuel economy of passenger cars
for model years 2027 through 2031 by 2% each year — that is, to 47 miles
per gallon in 2026 and to 50.4 miles per gallon in 2031. (The current
average is around 39.1 miles per gallon.)
</p>
<p>
Republicans overwhelmingly opposed the rules, known as the Corporate
Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE Standards,
<a href="https://walberg.house.gov/media/in-the-news/fox-news-120-republicans-join-effort-opposing-bidens-de-facto-ev-mandate#:~:text=%E2%80%94%20penned%20a%20letter%20late%20Tuesday,U.S.%20energy%20and%20national%20security." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>arguing</u></a>
they “effectively mandate EVs while at the same time forcing the
internal combustion engine out of the market.” The GOP has insisted that
the CAFE Standards should be “market-driven” rather than “limit
availability of and access to vehicle and fuel options.” Project 2025,
the Heritage Foundation’s playbook for the Trump administration,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-change-project-2025#:~:text=Project%202025%20proposes%20a%20fleet%2Dwide%20average%20of%2035%20miles%20per%20gallon" target="_self"><u>called
for</u></a> a fuel efficiency standard of 35 mpg.
</p>
<p>
CAFE Standards have
<a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2025/01/13/cafe-standards-fuel-efficiency-donald-trump/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>long
been a political football</u></a> between administrations; Trump
previously
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/business/environment/trump-finalizes-rollback-of-obama-era-vehicle-fuel-efficiency-standards-idUSKBN21I25R/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>rolled
back</u></a> President Barack Obama’s standards, while Biden’s NHTSA
brought even stricter rules.
</p>
<p>
Monday’s executive order additionally appeared to target the EPA’s
waiver for California to set its own emissions standards under the Clean
Air Act in its language targeting “state emission waivers that function
to limit sales of gasoline-powered automobiles.” Trump previously
revoked California’s right to include greenhouse gases in its emissions
considerations and barred other states from adopting its criteria. Biden
reversed that decision in March 2022, on the grounds that the Trump
administration’s withdrawal was based on
<a href="https://www.bakerlaw.com/insights/regulating-automotive-emissions-part-i-what-to-expect-under-the-second-trump-administration/#:~:text=the%20decision%20to%20withdraw%20the%20waiver%20was%20based%20on%20a%20flawed%20interpretation%20of%20the%20Clean%20Air%20Act.%5B2%5D" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
flawed interpretation</u></a> of the Clean Air Act. Since then,
California released its Advanced Clean Cars II standard, which
<a href="https://www.atlasevhub.com/weekly-digest/12-states-have-formally-adopted-advanced-clean-cars-ii/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>11
other states</u></a> have adopted and requires
<a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2024-12-11/why-newsoms-electric-vehicle-mandate-is-in-trouble" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>all
new cars sold by 2035</u></a> to be zero-emission.
</p>
<p>
It had been no secret that the California waiver would be
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-change-project-2025#:~:text=It%20will%20revoke%20the%20California%20Clean%20Air%20Act%20waiver%20(...again)" target="_self"><u>a
target of the incoming Trump administration</u></a>, despite the program
being
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/trump-tesla-california" target="_self"><u>a
secret profit center for Tesla</u></a> and supported by Elon Musk.
California has also quietly been working to Trump-proof its standards,
reaching an agreement recently with Stellantis (the parent automaker of
Chrysler, Jeep, Dodge, and Ram) to comply voluntarily with its
electrification mandates through 2030. (As my colleague Matthew Zeitlin
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/california-stellantis-trump-epa" target="_self"><u>has
noted</u></a>, the nationwide EPA rules for tailpipe emission reductions
“follow a different model than the California standards,” and are not an
electric vehicle mandate.)
</p>
<p>
By directing the EPA to revoke the California waiver, Trump has started
a process that could lead to the Supreme Court. Last month, the Justices
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/supreme-court-spares-california-auto-emissions-waiver-for-now/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>declined
to consider</u></a> whether or not California has the right to set its
own aggressive tailpipe standards, but if Trump indeed attempts to
rescind the waiver, it will
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/trump-plans-energy-dominance-executive-orders-after-inauguration-df86acd8" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>likely
face further legal challenges</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Taken together, the “Unleashing American Energy” executive order seems
designed to deliver on Trump’s frequent campaign attacks on EVs on the
2024 campaign trail, where he argued that “under Biden’s electric
vehicle mandate, 40% of all U.S. auto jobs will disappear.” Heatmap’s
own investigation found
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/evs-trump-uaw-jobs-evidence" target="_self"><u>little
evidence</u></a> to suggest that making electric vehicles will result in
fewer jobs. Trump’s tune on EVs had changed in recent months, however,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-ev-pivot-elon-musk" target="_self"><u>as
he grew closer to Tesla CEO Elon Musk</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
It’s true, also, that executive orders are not the automatic rule of
law; many of the policies will face time-consuming new rulemaking
processes or legal challenges. More clarity about what the “Unleashing
American Energy” order does precisely, and how it will be implemented,
will become clear in the weeks and months ahead.

<h2 id="trump-orders-end-to-all-wind-energy-permits">Trump Orders End to
All Wind Energy Permits</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-21, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTY5NjM5Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3MDM2OTI3Nn0.q06MCGpKPE5PQvbADzTSl6KQ7N7iKV4QkUhpwOcN6Pc/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
President Donald Trump has ordered the federal government to stop all
permits for wind energy projects.
</p>
<p>
Trump on Monday evening issued a sweeping executive order that the
government “shall not issue new or renewed approvals, rights of way,
permits, leases, or loans for onshore or offshore wind projects” pending
what the order describes as a “comprehensive assessment” of the
industry’s myriad impacts on the economy, environment and other factors.
</p>
<p>
This affects all offshore wind development in the U.S., because all of
that takes place in the Outer Continental Shelf, an ocean expanse under
federal control that is leased for all kinds of energy production.
</p>
<p>
It also impacts wind projects on federal lands. Although the extent of
the impact to onshore wind is unclear because some wind projects are on
state lands, project developers often must get approvals under federal
environmental and species protection laws, so an end to permits will be
quite painful for the sector.
</p>
<p>
The new order also withdrew all waters in the Outer Continental Shelf
from access to wind leasing and launched a new Interior Department
review of existing wind energy leases that will identify “any legal
basis” for termination or amendment based on “ecological, economic, and
environmental necessity.” This opens the door to offshore wind
developers potentially losing their leases.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, the order specifically bans wind energy development at the
site sought after for the Lava Ridge wind project in Idaho. Lava Ridge
<a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/hotspots/lava-ridge-wind-trump-executive-order" target="_self"><u>has
been contentious</u></a> because of its vicinity to a historic
internment camp where Japanese Americans were forced to live during
World War II. The project was fully permitted days before the end of
Biden’s term. But in spite of those approvals, critics of the project
close to the project insisted Trump would act on his own to kill it.
</p>
<p>
The order’s provisions are similar to a request we reported on last week
that
<a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/spotlight/offshore-wind-executive-order-trump" target="_blank">anti-offshore
wind advocates transmitted</a> to the Trump transition team, although
it’s clear the draft didn’t wind up in the final version.
</p>
<p>
In addition, the order asks for a separate study to assess the
“environmental impact and cost to surrounding communities of defunct and
idle windmills” to determine whether any wind turbines — which the order
calls “windmills” — should be removed. This study will be conducted by
the Interior Department, the Energy Department, and the Environmental
Protection Agency.

<h2
id="trumps-executive-orders-on-immigration-focus-on-border-security-asylum-restrictions-deportations">Trump’s
executive orders on immigration focus on border security, asylum
restrictions, deportations</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — On the first day of his second term, President Donald
Trump announced a series of executive actions addressing immigration and
border security.</p>
<p>Trump signed orders his officials called “common-sense immigration
policies.” These include declaring a national emergency at the U.S.
southern border, deploying armed forces, border wall construction,
ending asylum and ending birthright citizenship to some children born in
the U.S., among others.</p>
<p>During his inaugural address, Trump said, “We have a government that
has given unlimited funding to the defense of foreign borders, but
refuses to defend American borders or more importantly, its own
people.”</p>
<p>In a call with reporters earlier in the day, Trump officials outlined
the administration’s plans to tackle what it describes as a “national
security and public safety crisis” at the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>
<p>“President Trump was elected by a resounding mandate to carry out the
promises he made on the campaign trail, that includes his pledge to
secure the southern border and carry out the largest deportation of
migrant criminals in history,” an incoming White House official said,
speaking on background, a method often used by U.S. officials to remain
anonymous. Officials also emphasized the administration’s commitment to
implement what they call the largest deportation of migrant criminals in
U.S. history.</p>
<p>Here are some of the administration’s plans.</p>
<p>National emergency at the border</p>
<p>Trump said he will deploy the military to the U.S.-Mexico border,
including the National Guard, to assist existing law enforcement
officers. Officials emphasized that border security is national
security, and the administration is committed to securing the border
through use of the military.</p>
<p>“What this action does is it deploys armed forces [and] erects
physical barriers by directing [Department of Defense] and [Department
of Homeland Security] secretaries to finish the wall along the border. …
We’re going to reinstate the Remain in Mexico [policy],” the official
said.</p>
<p>Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior fellow at the American Immigration
Council, wrote on X that without Mexico’s permission, the promise to
bring back Remain in Mexico is “just words on a paper.”</p>
<p>The Remain in Mexico policy, created during the first Trump
administration, requires some asylum-seekers at the southern border to
wait in Mexico until their hearings in U.S. immigration court.</p>
<p>Juan Ramon de la Fuente, Mexico’s secretary of external relations,
said in a news conference Monday morning that if “they reinstate [Remain
in Mexico], this is something we don’t agree with. We have a different
focus. We want to adjust it. … The desire is to keep the same policies
as now.”</p>
<p>When asked about the number of troops expected to be deployed to the
border, Trump administration officials said that decision would
ultimately be made by the secretary of defense.</p>
<p>The administration is also rescinding the Biden administration border
policies by giving U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U.S.
Customs and Border Protection agents expanded enforcement authority and
establishing federal task forces to work with state and local law
enforcement in deportation efforts.</p>
<p>Mass deportations</p>
<p>Another announcement centers on undocumented immigrants across the
country. The Republican president repeatedly promised during his
campaign to carry out mass deportations, targeting at least 11 million
undocumented individuals.</p>
<p>In the press call with reporters, the Trump officials said the
administration will provide immigration officers with the necessary
“authorities” to enforce existing laws. In his campaign, Trump vowed to
eliminate President Joe Biden’s deportation priorities, which targeted
individuals with criminal records and those considered national security
threats, and instead to expand enforcement to include all undocumented
immigrants.</p>
<p>Stephen Yale-Loehr, a retired professor of immigration law at Cornell
Law School, wrote in an email to VOA that mass deportation efforts and
raids may get the most attention, but deportations will not increase
rapidly right away.</p>
<p>“If a person already has an outstanding order of deportation, they
can be deported immediately. But that is a relatively small number. Most
people picked up will be put into deportation proceedings in immigration
courts. Those courts already have a backlog of over 3.8 million cases.
Given that backlog, it will be years before many people will find out
whether they will be deported or allowed to stay based on asylum or some
other form of protection,” he wrote.</p>
<p>Release of migrants</p>
<p>The incoming administration also announced an end to the practice of
releasing migrants into the U.S. while they await their immigration
court hearings, commonly known as “catch-and-release.”</p>
<p>The Trump officials did not explain how they would handle an increase
in immigrant detention.</p>
<p>Refugee program</p>
<p>Trump is also ending the refugee resettlement program. During his
first administration, he progressively lowered the annual ceiling for
refugee admissions to a historic low of 15,000 for fiscal 2021.</p>
<p>Refugee advocates said at the time the reductions marked a departure
from the United States’ long-standing role in global refugee
resettlement.</p>
<p>Erol Kekic, senior vice president of programs at Church World
Service, wrote in an email to reporters that his group is urging
President Trump to reconsider. Church World Service is one of the nine
national refugee resettlement agencies authorized by the federal
government to assist refugees in starting new lives.  </p>
<p>“Even a brief pause in the program can have a devastating impact; on
those displaced by violence and persecution, families separated by
oceans and continents, and our communities who embrace the spirit of
welcome inherent to our great nation,” he wrote.</p>
<p>Ending asylum and CBP One app</p>
<p>One of Trump’s orders calls for the immediate deportation of migrants
who crossed the border illegally without a chance to plead their case to
an asylum officer.</p>
<p>Shortly after Trump’s inauguration, U.S. Customs and Border
Protection posted a notice on its website saying the agency was no
longer using the CBP One app, which had facilitated the legal entry of
nearly 1 million people into the United States with eligibility to
work.</p>
<p>The app allowed migrants to apply for an appointment to come to the
border and apply for humanitarian parole or other forms of legal
processing. The use of parole under the CBP One system was part of the
Biden administration’s broader efforts to manage migration flows and
provide legal pathways to entry, rather than having individuals cross
the border illegally.</p>
<p>However, parole granted through CBP One did not guarantee permanent
legal status; it typically allowed individuals to stay temporarily and,
in some cases, apply for work authorization while their immigration
status was being reviewed.</p>
<p>The notice by the CBP One app also confirmed that all existing
appointments had been canceled.</p>
<p>Birthright citizenship</p>
<p>Finally, Trump signed an order to eliminate birthright citizenship.
Birthright citizenship grants automatic U.S. citizenship to anyone born
on American soil, a right established by the 14th Amendment of the U.S.
Constitution.</p>
<p>The new administration’s actions are expected to face significant
legal and political challenges, with immigrant advocacy groups voicing
concerns over the implications of these policies.</p>
<p>The ACLU of Northern California, a nonprofit organization in the
United States dedicated to defending individual rights and liberties
guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution and laws, wrote in an email to the
press they “stand ready.”</p>
<p>“We are ready to do so again, from day one of the second Trump
administration. … We will defend immigrants’ rights to due process in
the face of mass deportations,” the email read.</p>

id="senate-confirms-rubio-as-secretary-of-state-trumps-first-cabinet-member">Senate
confirms Rubio as secretary of state, Trump’s first Cabinet member</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Senate quickly confirmed Marco Rubio as secretary of
state on Monday, voting unanimously to give President Donald Trump the
first member of his new Cabinet on Inauguration Day.</p>
<p>Rubio, a Republican senator from Florida, is among the least
controversial of Trump’s nominees, and the vote was a decisive 99-0.
Another pick, John Ratcliffe for CIA director, is also expected to have
a swift vote. Action on others, including former combat veteran and Fox
News host Pete Hegseth for defense secretary, is expected later in the
week.</p>
<p>“Marco Rubio is a very intelligent man with a remarkable
understanding of American foreign policy,” Senator Chuck Grassley, the
senior-most Republican, said as the chamber opened.</p>
<p>It’s often tradition for the Senate to convene immediately after the
ceremonial pomp of the inauguration to begin putting the new president’s
team in place, particularly the national security officials. During
Trump’s first term, the Senate swiftly confirmed his defense and
homeland security secretaries on his first day in office. Former
President Joe Biden’s choice for director of national intelligence was
confirmed on his own Inauguration Day.</p>
<p>With Trump’s return to the White House, and his Republican Party
controlling majorities in Congress, his outsider Cabinet choices are
more clearly falling into place, despite initial skepticism and
opposition from both sides of the aisle.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune moved quickly Monday, saying he
expected voting to begin “imminently” on Trump’s nominees.</p>
<p>Democrats have calculated it’s better for them to be seen as more
willing to work with Trump rather than simply mounting a blockade to his
nominees. They’re holding their opposition for some of his other picks
who have less support, including Tulsi Gabbard for director of national
intelligence and vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for health
secretary.</p>
<p>Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said his party would “neither
rubber-stamp nominees we feel are grossly unqualified, nor oppose
nominees that deserve serious consideration.”</p>
<p>Rubio, he said, is an example of “a qualified nominee we think should
be confirmed quickly.”</p>
<p>Senate committees have been holding lengthy confirmation hearings on
more than a dozen of the Cabinet nominees, with more to come this week.
And several panels were expected to meet late Monday to begin voting to
advance the nominees to the full Senate for confirmation.</p>
<p>The Senate Foreign Relations Committee advanced Rubio’s nomination
late Monday. The Senate Armed Services Committee and Senate Intelligence
Committee, respectively, advanced the nominations of Hegseth and
Ratcliffe.</p>
<p>Rubio, a well-liked senator and former Trump rival during the 2016
presidential race, has drawn closer to the president in recent years. He
appeared last week to answer questions before the Foreign Relations
Committee, where he has spent more than a decade as a member.</p>
<p>As secretary of state, Rubio would be the nation’s top diplomat and
the first Latino to hold the position. Born in Miami to Cuban
immigrants, he has long been involved in foreign affairs, particularly
in South America, and has emerged as a hawk on China’s rise.</p>
<p>During his confirmation hearing last week, Rubio warned of the
consequences of America’s “unbalanced relationship” with China. While he
echoes Trump’s anti-globalist rhetoric, Rubio is also seen as an
internationalist who understands the power of U.S. involvement on the
global stage.</p>
<p>Rubio will take over for outgoing Secretary of State Antony Blinken,
who has said he hopes the Trump administration continues Biden’s
policies in the Middle East to end the war in Gaza and to help Ukraine
counter Russian nomination.</p>
<p>The Senate is split 53-47, but the resignation of Vice President JD
Vance drops the GOP majority to 52 until his successor arrives.
Republicans need almost every party member in line to overcome
Democratic opposition to nominees.</p>
<p>Objection from any one senator, as is expected with Hegseth and
several other choices, would force the Senate into procedural steps that
would drag voting later into the week.</p>

id="biden-issues-preemptive-pardons-before-exiting-white-house">Biden
issues preemptive pardons before exiting White House</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden used his constitutional power
Monday to preemptively pardon several individuals, including some of his
relatives, just minutes before Donald Trump was sworn in as the 47th
president of the United States.</p>
<p>Without naming Trump or the incoming administration, Biden said in a
statement that he believes in the rule of law but warned about the
threat of partisan politics and pointed to possible retribution as the
main concern behind his decision to grant the preemptive pardons.</p>
<p>“I am optimistic that the strength of our legal institutions will
ultimately prevail over politics,” Biden’s statement read. “But these
are exceptional circumstances, and I cannot in good conscience do
nothing.”</p>
<p>Among those granted pardons is Trump’s former Joint Chiefs of Staff,
retired General Mark Milley. Political differences between Trump and
Milley that both men vented in public during Trump’s first term in
office led to Trump’s supporters branding Milley as disloyal. Milley has
reportedly referred to Trump as a “fascist.”</p>
<p>Citing “ongoing threats and intimidation for faithfully discharging
their duties,” Biden extended pardons to members and staff of the Select
Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States
Capitol. That includes former Republican Representative Liz Cheney.</p>
<p>Biden also preemptively pardoned the U.S. Capitol and Washington
police officers who testified before the committee.</p>
<p>“The Select Committee fulfilled this mission with integrity and a
commitment to discovering the truth,” Biden said. The statement
continued, “Rather than accept accountability, those who perpetrated the
January 6th attack have taken every opportunity to undermine and
intimidate those who participated in the Select Committee in an attempt
to rewrite history, erase the stain of January 6th for partisan gain,
and seek revenge, including by threatening criminal prosecutions.”</p>
<p>Biden also preemptively pardoned his former chief medical adviser,
Dr. Anthony Fauci, who retired in December 2023.</p>
<p>Fauci and his family have received threats from those who opposed his
approach to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the issuance of mask
mandates.</p>
<p>There’s a history of U.S. presidents pardoning family members for
specific criminal convictions. Biden pardoned his son Hunter Biden in
December for gun and tax offenses as well as for any offenses he may
have committed “from January 1, 2014, through December 1, 2024.” But on
Monday, Biden also pardoned other relatives who aren’t under
investigation, including his brother, James Biden; James Biden’s wife,
Sara Biden; his sister, Valerie Biden Owens; Valerie Owens’ husband,
John Owens; and his brother, Francis Biden.</p>
<p>“My family has been subjected to unrelenting attacks and threats,
motivated solely by a desire to hurt me — the worst kind of partisan
politics. Unfortunately, I have no reason to believe these attacks will
end,” Biden’s statement said. “The issuance of these pardons should not
be mistaken as an acknowledgment that they engaged in any wrongdoing,
nor should acceptance be misconstrued as an admission of guilt for any
offense.”</p>
<p>Biden’s preemptive pardons contradict the stance he publicly shared
on the matter on December 3, 2020, shortly before he took office. CNN
anchor Jake Tapper asked Biden’s opinion on Trump’s reported
consideration of a wave of preemptive pardons before exiting the White
House.</p>
<p>“Well, it concerns me in terms of what kind of precedent it sets and
how the rest of the world looks at us as a nation of laws and justice,”
Biden replied. He further underscored that his administration wouldn’t
approach pardons in that way.</p>
<p>Trump has himself promised to pardon many of his supporters who
attacked the Capitol on January 6, 2021. He has characterized those
arrested as “patriots” who were wrongly prosecuted.</p>
<p>Some information for this report came from The Associated Press and
Reuters.</p>

orders</u></a> in front of an arena full of supporters on Monday night,
with actions ranging from a regulatory freeze to requiring all federal
workers to return to the office full-time. While the full implications
of Trump’s Day One actions for energy and climate are still unfolding,
one of the most consequential executive orders so far —
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/initial-rescissions-of-harmful-executive-orders-and-actions/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
sweeping rollback</u> of 80</a> of former President Joe Biden’s
executive orders — quietly paved the way for the return of Schedule F,
which converts at least
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/how-trump-loyalists-could-make-the-president-even-more-powerful-607353cc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>50,000

<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/restoring-accountability-to-policy-influencing-positions-within-the-federal-workforce/" target="_blank"><u>formally

</p>
<p>
Trump first signed
<a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-creating-schedule-f-excepted-service/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>an
executive order</u></a> creating the new employment category in October
2020, though Biden reversed it shortly after taking office via Executive
Order 14003 — Protecting the Federal Workforce. While Trump didn’t have
much time to implement the policy last time around, he revoked Executive
Order 14003 in his omnibus executive order targeting Biden’s policies
just hours into his second shot at the presidency. The move cued up his
formal reinstatement of Schedule F Monday evening. “Most of those
bureaucrats are being fired,” Trump boasted during a speech at the
Capital One Arena in Washington, D.C., ahead of the signing on Monday
night. “They’re gone. Should be all of them but some sneak through; we
have to live with a couple, I guess.”
</p>
<p>
As I’ve written before, the reclassification is designed to “make it
easier to replace

or ‘woke’ civil servants</u></a> and would-be whistleblowers, a.k.a.
‘the deep state,’ with party-line faithful.” The Trump administration
has characterized it as giving him “full control of the government,”
with the Schedule F-specific Executive Order issued under the title
“Restoring Accountability to Policy-Influencing Positions Within the
Federal Workforce.” Russ Vought, Trump’s

the policy to give a “whole-of-government unwinding” to the “climate
fanaticism” of the Biden years.

The most concerning part of the Schedule F policy is the anticipated
loss of institutional knowledge. “What we’re going to end up with is an
executive branch that’s just uninformed,” Daniel Farber, the director of
the Center for Law, Energy, and the Environment at the University of
California, Berkeley, previously told me. Climate-related experts, in
particular, could face replacement by

</p>
<p>
Democratic Senator Andy Kim of New Jersey drilled Vought on Schedule F
during the OMB nominee’s confirmation hearing last week, during which
Vought insisted the goal of the policy “was not to fire anyone” but
rather to ensure federal employees “do a good job or they may not be in
those positions for longer.” He additionally told Democratic Senator
Richard Blumenthal that he

id="dangerous-fire-weather-conditions-predicted-in-southern-california">‘Dangerous
fire weather conditions’ predicted in Southern California</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The National Weather Service (NWS) is predicting even more “dangerous
fire weather conditions” in Southern California, citing the area’s “low
humidity and the return of very strong winds” from Monday into
Tuesday.</p>
<p>“Take action now to prepare your home and loved ones for another
round of EXTREME WIND and FIRE WEATHER, starting tomorrow afternoon:
Worst winds Mon afternoon – Tue morning,” NWS Los Angeles posted on
social media platform X.</p>
<p>“Everyone needs to be on high alert,” Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass
said Monday.</p>
<p>Brice Bennett, spokesperson for the California Department of Forestry
and Fire Protection (Cal Fire), said in a statement Monday that his
agency — with help from federal, local and tribal firefighting agencies
— had more than 2,500 people and had prepositioned equipment for quick
deployment for any new outbreaks, following the NWS warning.</p>
<p>At least 27 people have died in the fires that have erupted across
Los Angeles, as battle-weary firefighters have struggled to bring the
blazes under control. The death toll is expected to rise.</p>
<p>The Palisades and Eaton fires together have destroyed 14,000
structures since they exploded January 7, during the fierce Santa Ana
winds. As of Monday, the Palisades fire was 59% contained and the Eaton
fire was 87% contained.</p>
<p>A critical-risk-of-fire-weather warning has been issued by the Storm
Prediction Center for Southern California with gusts expected to reach
up to 96 kph for lower elevations and 120 kph or more in higher
locations. The weather service said there is an extremely critical risk
in place for the ongoing fire locations in the San Gabriel and Santa
Monica mountains.</p>
<p>California Governor Gavin Newsom issued an executive order Monday
designed to protect Southern California residents from landslides and
flooding. The order suspends some rules and regulations and speeds up
the removal of debris that, if not removed promptly, could result in
landslides, mudslides and flash floods.</p>
<p>“This order helps keep our emergency response focused on protecting
communities, not permits and paperwork,” Newsom said.</p>
<p>Residents whose homes have somehow survived the fires are finding
they are not home free. According to The New York Times, people are
finding their homes still standing but filled with a slurry of smoke,
ash, chemicals and other contaminants.</p>
<p>“It smelled worse inside our house than outside,” resident Marcos
Barron, 53, told the Times. Another resident, Arlynn Page, said she
wanted to stay to rebuild in Altadena because she loves the community.
“But breathing this air? I don’t know,” she said.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
In a completely unsurprising redux of President Donald Trump’s first
term, the new/old U.S. president has
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/putting-america-first-in-international-environmental-agreements/" target="_blank">officially
notified the United Nations</a> of America’s intent to withdraw from the
Paris Agreement. According to the terms of the agreement, which went
into effect in 2016, it takes a full year for withdrawal to become
official. But Trump will almost certainly henceforth act as if the U.S.
is no longer bound by the treaty, which has been adopted by nearly every
other nation on Earth, in an effort to keep global warming “well below”
2 degrees Celsius.
</p>
<p>
“I’m immediately withdrawing from the unfair, one-sided Paris Climate
Accord rip-off,” Trump told the crowd at the Capital One Arena in
Washington, D.C., before signing a list of executive orders. “The United
States will not sabotage our own industries while China pollutes with
impunity,” he said. Trump has previously stated that he thinks it is
unfair that less developed nations such as China are not required to
peak their emissions for a number of years, while the U.S. is expected
to continue decreasing its own.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/all-about-ndcs?utm_source=chatgpt.com#:~:text=After%20the%20original%20NDCs%20in%202015%2C%20and%20the%20second%20round%20in%202020/2021%2C%20the%20next%20round%20of%20NDCs%20%E2%80%93%20%E2%80%9CNDCs%203.0%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%93%20are%20due%20in%20early%202025%20and%20will%20detail%20countries%27%20intended%20climate%20actions%20through%202035." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>This
year</u></a>, parties to the agreement are required to submit national
climate action plans — or “nationally determined contributions” in the
parlance of the treaty — to the United Nations, detailing how they’ll
further reduce emissions and adapt to global warming. These updated
plans are mandated every five years, though Trump failed to submit one
in 2020. The Biden administration
<a href="https://archive.ph/MIaeL" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>submitted
a plan</u></a> last month, in advance of Trump’s inauguration, which
includes a goal of cutting emissions by 61% to 66% below 2005 levels by
2035. It’s safe to assume Trump will not abide by this. Once it leaves
the Paris Agreement, the U.S. will also no longer have to submit yearly
emissions reports or provide as much money to developing countries for
climate change mitigation and adaptation.
</p>
<p>
So what will the fallout be? After all, America is the world’s second
largest emitter of greenhouse gases, behind China. But logistically and
legally, leaving the Paris Agreement is more symbolic than anything.
Beyond the more nebulous — but very real — loss of international
leadership on climate issues, there’s no tangible repercussions for
exiting the agreement. Nor, as many party nations consistently
demonstrate, any legal recourse for staying in while failing to meet
targets or set sufficient goals.
</p>
<p>
As
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-paris-agreement" target="_self"><u>I
reported in November</u></a>, so long as the U.S. retains its membership
in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the U.S.
can still attend the annual UN climate conference, a.k.a. COP, where all
negotiations and decisions related to the Paris Agreement happen. But
for all Paris-related meetings (which comprise much of the conference),
the U.S. would have to attend as an “observer” with no decision-making
power, the same category as lobbyists.
</p>
<p>
That’s actually never happened before. During Trump’s first term, the
U.S. technically could (and definitely did) continue to play a role in
negotiations. The Paris Agreement stipulated that no nation could
officially announce its exit for three years after implementation, and,
because it still took a year for withdrawal to become official, for
every COP during Trump 1.0, the U.S. remained a party to Paris. While
Trump’s COP delegations were smaller and less politically prominent than
either Obama’s or Biden’s, U.S. representatives continued to show up and
advocate for domestic interests. Since COP30 will happen in mid-November
of this year, COP31 in 2026 will be the first climate conference where
the U.S. will truly learn what it’s like to sit on the sidelines.
</p>
<p>
Making a more drastic break with the United Nation’s overall climate
efforts by leaving the UNFCCC, which convenes the annual climate
conference, is theoretically also an option. But leaving the framework
convention would likely be a much
<a href="https://www.climatechangenews.com/2024/11/04/legal-experts-say-trump-could-quit-paris-pact-but-leaving-unfccc-much-harder/#:~:text=UNFCCC%20case%20uncertain" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more
complex and arduous</u></a> process than leaving Paris. While Trump has
yet to make a statement indicating his intentions in this regard, the
Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 recommends it.
</p>
<p>
“We’re going to save over a trillion dollars by withdrawing from that
treaty,” Trump told the crowd regarding the Paris Agreement, before
returning to the Oval Office to sign a number of additional executive
orders. As my colleague
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-paris-agreement-fact-check?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_self"><u>Jeva
Lange explained</u></a>, the math behind that figure comes from a study
conducted by NERA Economic Consulting, which later released a statement
saying that the administration “selectively used results” from its
study, and that “NERA’s study was not a cost-benefit analysis of the
Paris Agreement, nor does it purport to be one.”

Energy Emergency Is Here</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-20, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTY5NTE3NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3MzcwMDg3MX0.IW2MBUC0VZvwbczQAnbrh9EOKGhvhb6mQYf-97KYZOs/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Donald Trump looked to further unleash American energy production as one
of the first actions of his new term, signing an executive order
declaring a
“<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/declaring-a-national-energy-emergency/" target="_blank">national
energy emergency</a>” among the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/wind-executive-order-trump" target="_blank">litany</a>
of
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/trump-ev-executive-order" target="_blank">other</a>
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/critical-minerals-trump-executive-order" target="_blank">actions</a>
and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-executive-order-schedule-f" target="_blank">declarations</a>
he made on
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-leaves-paris-agreement" target="_blank">Monday</a>.
</p>
<p>
Earlier, in his inaugural address, he boasted that the United States has
“the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on Earth, and we are
going to use it.”
</p>
<p>
“We will bring prices down, fill our strategic reserves up again, right
to the top, and export American energy all over the world,” Trump said.
</p>
<p>
The order describes an “active threat to the American people from high
energy prices,” as “hostile state and non-state foreign actors have
targeted our domestic energy infrastructure, weaponized our reliance on
foreign energy, and abused their ability to cause dramatic swings within
international commodity markets.” The order directs agency leaders to
“exercise any lawful emergency authorities available to them, as well as
all other lawful authorities they may possess” to facilitate U.S. energy
production, including — but not limited to — activities on federal
lands.
</p>
<p>
The Trump administration
<a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000194-849b-db01-a79f-94dbfaa00000" target="_blank"><u>had
earlier outlined its plans</u></a> in a document
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/01/president-trumps-america-first-priorities/" target="_blank"><u>posted
to the White House website</u></a> Monday morning, which promised
regulatory reform not only for “energy production and use,” but also for
“mining and processing of non-fuel minerals.”
</p>
<p>
The document said the purpose of the national energy emergency would be
to “use all necessary resources to build critical infrastructure.” In
remarks in the days before the inauguration, Trump described the goal of
declaring an energy emergency as enabling investors to more easily
“build big plants, AI plants,” and that the U.S. needs to “double the
energy that we already have — and it’s going to end up being more than
that.”
</p>
<p>
That could mean waiving environmental rules — including undoing the
Environmental Protection Agency’s power plant emissions rules — in order
to speed the building of power plants in order to power new data
centers.
</p>
<p>
While the exact parameters of these plans are still being drawn and will
probably require either months-long rulemaking processes or legislation
or both, by Monday morning, clean energy and environmental groups have
already started to weigh in.
</p>
<p>
“On his first day back in the White House, President Trump is trying to
turn back the clock on America’s clean energy leadership at the expense
of American people and their health,” Debbie Weyl, the acting United
States director of the World Resources Institute, said in a statement
following the president’s address to the nation. “If realized, President
Trump’s actions would sacrifice the United States’ competitiveness
globally, raise energy prices for American families, and pollute our
air. Pledging to roll back climate policies that have created more than
400,000 good-paying American jobs will only hurt workers and our
economy.”
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, at least portions of the clean energy industry are
seeing the bright side of Trump’s emphasis on energy maximalism.
</p>
<p>
“A promise to achieve greater energy abundance in America must include
leveraging the incredible, proven power of advanced energy technologies.
96% of all the new electricity added to America’s power grid in 2024 was
provided by advanced energy, the lowest-cost way to reliability meet
growing electricity demand,” Heather O’Neill, the president and chief
executive of the trade group Advanced Energy United, said in a similarly
timed statement.
</p>
<p>
“Our power grid faces real challenges, and at a moment when wildfires
and extreme temperatures threaten lives across the country, it’s clearer
than ever that we need to deepen our investments in advanced energy
solutions that increase resilience and lower costs. We urge the
Administration to embrace the market forces and tax cuts that are
empowering states to meet their energy needs and goals.”
</p>
<p>
When the White House published the text of the emergency declaration,
however, it became clear that Trump took a narrow view of what kinds of
energy might serve to mitigate the situation: “crude oil, natural gas,
lease condensates, natural gas liquids, refined petroleum products,
uranium, coal, biofuels, geothermal heat, the kinetic movement of
flowing water, and critical minerals.” No hydrogen, no solar, and no
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/wind-executive-order-trump" target="_blank">wind</a>.
</p>
<p>
While the newly inaugurated Trump administration has already taken a
dramatic rhetorical turn in how it treats the oil and gas industry
compared to Biden’s, it’s less clear that production can actually be
meaningfully increased. While the Biden administration was stingy in
opening up public lands for fossil fuel exploration — often doing
so<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/03/17/willow-project-alaska-oil-drilling-explained/" target="_blank">

and<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=63964" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
<u>gas production</u></a> hit record levels while Biden was in office.
</p>
<p>
Any Biden administration efforts to curtail fossil fuel production faced
legal and political pushback. In the first week of his presidency, Biden
issued a moratorium on new oil and gas leasing on public lands,
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/judge-doubles-down-blocking-biden-oil-gas-pause-13-states-2022-08-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>which
was quickly halted by a federal judge</u></a>. During the drafting of
the Inflation Reduction Act, Biden’s signature climate law, West
Virginia Senator Joe Manchin
<a href="https://www.energy.senate.gov/2023/10/manchin-urges-epa-to-reconsider-proposed-methane-rules" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>insisted
on oil and gas lease sales</u></a> as a condition of his support, and
then on opening up Willow, the oil project on Alaska’s North Slope, for
drilling by ConocoPhillips. At the same time, gas prices soared to over
$5 a gallon following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, leading the Biden
administration to use the Strategic Petroleum Reserve as a tool to bring
down oil prices, selling almost 200 million barrels.
</p>
<p>
The Strategic Petroleum Reserve
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&s=WCSSTUS1&f=W" target="_blank"><u>now
has just under 400 million barrels</u></a>, well short of its legal
limit of 714 million. Trump has promised to refill it, which would be a
boon to American domestic oil producers, although this would

id="trump-seeks-return-of-us-military-equipment-from-afghan-taliban">Trump
seeks return of US military equipment from Afghan Taliban</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Ayaz Gul  — President-elect Donald Trump says that future financial
assistance to Afghanistan will be contingent upon the return of U.S.
military equipment by the Taliban leaders currently in power. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Trump’s remarks at a Sunday rally in Washington on the eve of his
January 20 inauguration have heightened uncertainty regarding his
administration’s stance on the crisis-hit South Asian nation. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“They [Biden administration] gave billions of billions of dollars to
the Taliban. They gave our military equipment, a big chunk of it, to the
enemy,” Trump said. He referred to the tumultuous and hasty withdrawal
of U.S. troops from Afghanistan in August 2021, ordered by President Joe
Biden. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“If we’re going to pay billions of dollars a year, tell them we’re
not going to give them the money unless they give back our military
equipment. … So, we will give them a couple of bucks; we want the
military equipment back,” Trump stated without elaborating. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>A report issued by the U.S. Department of Defense in 2022 revealed
that approximately $7 billion worth of military equipment was left
behind in Afghanistan following the completion of the military
withdrawal. The equipment in question, which included aircraft,
air-to-ground munitions, military vehicles, weapons, communications
equipment, and other materials, was subsequently seized by the Taliban.
 </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The de facto Afghan rulers have since repeatedly displayed the U.S.
military gear in their so-called victory day celebrations over the past
three years. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The foreign troop exit stemmed from the February 2020 Doha Agreement
that the first Trump administration negotiated with the then-insurgent
Taliban. Biden completed and defended the military withdrawal, saying
the choice he had was either to follow through on that agreement or be
prepared to go back to fighting the Taliban. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Following the withdrawal, the Biden administration largely isolated
the Taliban and imposed new sanctions on the group. Washington, however,
has continued to be the largest donor to Afghanistan, a country that the
United Nations says is suffering through one of the severest
humanitarian crises in the world. U.S. officials have also engaged in
diplomatic efforts with the Taliban to negotiate the release of certain
U.S. detainees and assisted in relocating Afghan allies who had helped
American forces. </p>
<p>US gives cash for humanitarian aid </p>
<p>The billions of dollars that Trump repeatedly has referred to are
likely the cash shipments being channeled through the U.N. and
non-governmental organizations to support humanitarian programs in
Afghanistan. Washington remains the primary donor and has spent
approximately $3 billion in humanitarian aid since the U.S.
withdrawal.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thomas Ruttig from the independent Afghanistan Analysts Network
warned of challenges for the Taliban under the Trump administration. He
noted that some members of Congress and incoming administration
officials took part in the 20-year U.S. mission in Afghanistan and have
been highly critical of the Taliban. </p>
<p>Despite this, he stated that countering regional terrorism is a
significant concern in Washington, and it could potentially encourage
the Trump administration to seek cooperation with the Taliban to combat
terrorist organizations, including the Afghanistan-based affiliate of
the Islamic State terrorist organization known as IS-Khorasan.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ruttig said that Tim Burchett, Republican vice chair of the U.S.
Congress’s Foreign Affairs Committee, recently introduced a bill, the
“No Tax Dollars for Terrorists Act,” to ensure that U.S. tax money does
not end up in the hands of the Taliban.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan denies that cash shipments
for humanitarian programs are financing the Taliban. The mission says
the current setup – in which cash is physically brought to Afghanistan
and placed in designated U.N. accounts in a private bank – is in place
because of a ban on international banking transfers and ongoing
liquidity issues.</p>
<p>“All these funds are then distributed directly to the United Nations
entities, as well as to a small number of approved and vetted
humanitarian partners in Afghanistan,” according to the mission. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Taliban leaders have rejected Trump’s assertions that their
government received U.S. financial aid, stating that they do not expect
or seek any assistance from Washington. “Instead, it (U.S.) has
confiscated and frozen billions of dollars that rightfully belong to the
people of Afghanistan,” said a Taliban statement in response to Trump’s
remarks earlier this month. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ruttig warns that punitive measures and sanctions to pressure the
Taliban into submission might also provoke them to stop cooperation with
international stakeholders. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Today, the US-Taliban Doha Agreement is still considered valid and
obliges the Taliban to restrict ISKP and other groups from using their
shelter in Afghanistan to commit terrorist acts in the West. This could
be jeopardized by new quasi-sanctions on them,” he said in written
comments.  </p>
<p>Taliban hopes for better relations </p>
<p>Masuda Sultan, an Afghan American advocate for women’s rights, is
doubtful the new Trump administration will substantially change its
stance on the Taliban. Instead, she expects the U.S. will cut aid
contributions to U.N.-funded programs like the World Food Program that
have supported the country’s most vulnerable. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>At the same time, Taliban leaders appear publicly optimistic about a
favorable shift in U.S. policy under the Trump presidency, attributing
this to their Doha pact with his previous Trump administration. Kabul
promptly welcomed Trump’s election victory just one day after he was
declared the winner of the United States presidential vote. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Taliban foreign ministry issued a formal statement expressing its
hope that “the incoming U.S. administration will adopt a pragmatic
approach to ensure tangible advancement in bilateral relations, allowing
both nations to open a new chapter of relations grounded in mutual
engagement.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Earlier this month, Taliban Deputy Foreign Minister Sher Mohammad
Abbas Stanikzai commended Trump as a “decisive” and “courageous” leader.
Stanikzai suggested that Trump reconsider Biden’s policy and adopt a new
approach. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“We want to build good relations with the international community and

Weather forecasting service AccuWeather thinks this month’s devastating

“costly and impactful” year in terms of extreme weather events since the
Dust Bowl nearly a century ago. “The Dust Bowl led to a massive

wildfires, the rising costs of rebuilding and recovery, the challenge of
securing and affording insurance, as well as drought and water supply
concerns will likely lead to a significant migration out of California
over the next few years.” Nine U.S. weather disasters over the last 12
months have caused between $693 billion and $800 billion in damage and
economic losses, with the preliminary cost of the LA fires estimated at

pardons Fauci and Milley in effort to guard against potential ‘revenge’
by Trump</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — President Joe Biden has pardoned Dr. Anthony Fauci,
retired Gen. Mark Milley and members of the House committee that
investigated the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, using the extraordinary
powers of his office in his final hours to guard against potential
“revenge” by the incoming Trump administration.</p>
<p>The decision by Biden comes after Donald Trump warned of an enemies
list filled with those who have crossed him politically or sought to
hold him accountable for his attempt to overturn his 2020 election loss
and his role in the storming of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Trump
has selected Cabinet nominees who backed his election lies and who have
pledged to punish those involved in efforts to investigate him.</p>
<p>“The issuance of these pardons should not be mistaken as an
acknowledgment that any individual engaged in any wrongdoing, nor should
acceptance be misconstrued as an admission of guilt for any offense,”
Biden said in a statement. “Our nation owes these public servants a debt
of gratitude for their tireless commitment to our country.”</p>
<p>It’s customary for a president to grant clemency at the end of his
term, but those acts of mercy are usually offered to everyday Americans
who have been convicted of crimes. But Biden has used the power in the
broadest and most untested way possible: to pardon those who have not
even been investigated yet. And with the acceptance comes a tacit
admission of guilt or wrongdoing, even though those who have been
pardoned have not been formally accused of any crimes.</p>
<p>“These are exceptional circumstances, and I cannot in good conscience
do nothing,” Biden said, adding that “Even when individuals have done
nothing wrong — and in fact have done the right thing — and will
ultimately be exonerated, the mere fact of being investigated or
prosecuted can irreparably damage reputations and finances.”</p>
<p>Fauci was director of the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health for nearly 40
years and was Biden’s chief medical adviser until his retirement in
2022. He helped coordinate the nation’s response to the COVID-19
pandemic and raised the ire of Trump during that time. He has become a
target of intense hatred and vitriol from people on the right, who blame
him for mask mandates and other policies they believe infringed on their
rights, even as tens of thousands of Americans were dying.</p>
<p>Mark Milley is the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and
called Trump a fascist and detailed Trump’s conduct around the deadly
Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection.</p>
<p>Biden is also extending pardons to members and staff of the Jan. 6
committee, including former Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, both
Republicans, as well as the U.S. Capitol and D.C. Metropolitan police
officers who testified before the committee.</p>
<p>Biden, an institutionalist, has promised a smooth transition to the
next administration, inviting Trump to the White House and saying that
the nation will be OK, even as he warned during his farewell address of
a growing oligarchy. He has spent years warning that Trump’s ascension
to the presidency again would be a threat to democracy. His decision to
break with political norms with the preemptive pardons was brought on by
those concerns.</p>
<p>Biden has set the presidential record for most individual pardons and
commutations issued; he announced on Friday he would commuting the
sentences of almost 2,500 people convicted of nonviolent drug offenses.
He previously announced he was commuting the sentences of 37 of the 40
people on federal death row, converting their punishments to life
imprisonment just weeks before Trump, an outspoken proponent of
expanding capital punishment, takes office. In his first term, Trump
presided over an unprecedented spate of executions, 13, in a protracted
timeline during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

restores US services after Trump promise to delay ban</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — TikTok restored services to users in the United States
on Sunday after briefly blocking access due to a U.S. law banning the
social media platform based on national security concerns. </p>
<p>The situation played out amid the change in U.S. administrations as
President-elect Donald Trump said he would seek to “extend the period of
time before the law’s prohibitions take effect.” </p>
<p>He also proposed, in a post on his Truth Social platform, for the
United States to take a 50% ownership stake in TikTok. </p>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday upheld legislation passed by
Congress that called for banning TikTok unless its China-based parent
company sold it by Sunday. </p>
<p>The Biden administration had said it would not seek to enforce the
ban in its final days in office, leaving the issue to Trump after he
took office on Monday. </p>
<p>TikTok credited Trump as it announced the restoration of its
services, saying Sunday on X that he provided “the necessary clarity and
assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties
providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7
million small businesses to thrive.” </p>
<p>Trump’s actions marked a reversal from his first term in office when
he sought to ban TikTok in connection with concerns that the service was
sharing the personal information of U.S. users with the Chinese
government. </p>
<p>At a briefing Monday in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesperson Mao Ning said China believes companies should “decide
independently” about their operations and agreements. </p>
<p>“TikTok has operated in the U.S. for many years and is deeply loved
by American users,” she said. “We hope that the U.S. can earnestly
listen to the voice of reason and provide an open, fair, just and
non-discriminatory business environment for firms operating there.” </p>

rights leaders, King family issue call to action as inauguration falls
on MLK Day</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — When President-elect Donald Trump is sworn in as
president of the United States inside the Capitol’s rotunda, he will do
so facing a bust of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. on the federal
holiday commemorating King’s legacy.</p>
<p>It’s a disquieting contrast for some civil rights advocates who wish
to fulfill the late reverend’s dream of non-violent social
revolution.</p>
<p>Events honoring King and advocating for his vision of a just society
will occur across the nation as many in the U.S. observe the peaceful
transfer of power in the capital. The concurrent events have been met
with mixed feelings by civil rights leaders, who broadly reviled Trump’s
rhetoric and stances on race and civil rights during his third
presidential campaign.</p>
<p>But many leaders, including King’s own family, see the juxtaposition
as a poignant contrast and a chance to refocus the work of advancing
civil rights in a new political era.</p>
<p>“I’m glad it occurred on that day because it gives the United States
of America and the world the contrast in pictures. Is this the way you
want to go — or is this the way you want to go?” said the Rev. Bernice
King, the late King’s youngest daughter and CEO of the King Center.</p>
<p>“It’s not a day that he can be the star, which he loves to be,”
King’s daughter said of Trump. “He has to contend with that legacy on
that day, regardless of how he manages it and handles it in his
presentation. I hope those around him are advising him well to honor the
day appropriately in his speech.”</p>
<p>This is the third time in the nearly 40 years since the federal King
holiday became law that it coincides with a presidential inauguration.
Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama also were sworn in for their
second terms on the holiday. Both praised King in their remarks; it is
yet to be seen if and how Trump — who falsely claimed his first
inauguration had larger crowds than King’s March on Washington — will
acknowledge the day.</p>
<p>“Will he sound a message of unity and a presidency for all, or will
he continue to focus on his base and some of the divisive policies he’s
championed, like an anti-DEI stance, rounding up immigrants and cutting
important parts of the social safety net through this DOGE (Department
of Government Efficiency) process?” asked Marc Morial, president of the
National Urban League civil rights group.</p>
<p>Morial added that Trump’s inauguration landing on MLK Day represented
“a contradiction of values.”</p>
<p>Many civil rights leaders will spend the day commemorating King’s
legacy after a week of public and private organizing, giving speeches
and strategizing how to respond to the incoming administration’s
agenda.</p>
<p>“It’s the best of times and the worst of times,” said Derrick
Johnson, president of the NAACP, an organization whose members mentored,
collaborated and clashed with King throughout the Civil Rights
Movement.</p>
<p>“Our mission doesn’t change. Our job is to make democracy work for
all, to make sure that equal protection is ensured under the law,”
Johnson said. He added that the group “doesn’t want to assume” the Trump
administration can’t be a partner on advancing civil rights or racial
justice.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Johnson and other civil rights leaders met with
Congressional Black Caucus members on Capitol Hill to discuss how to
work with and to oppose the Trump administration. That same day, the
National Action Network, a civil rights group founded by the Rev. Al
Sharpton, hosted a breakfast at which Vice President Kamala Harris urged
attendees to stay motivated.</p>
<p>“Ours is a journey,” she said. “Whatever the outcome of any
particular moment, we can never be defeated. Our spirit can never be
defeated, because when that happens, we won’t win.”</p>
<p>Martin Luther King III, the late King’s eldest son, prayed with
Harris on stage. King had campaigned for Harris in the fall and called
her an advocate who “speaks to our better angels” and “embodies
Dr. King’s legacy.”</p>
<p>Many racial justice advocates are set to organize demonstrations,
vigils and community service events to mark the holiday and prepare for
what they consider an adversarial administration.</p>
<p>Some groups are reflecting on parallels and differences with how King
organized in the face of explicitly white supremacist state and local
governments and geopolitical tumult.</p>
<p>“The hostility is similar, particularly in that there is a mobilized,
active and aggressive extremist-right hell bent on unraveling rights and
any sense of shared purpose, shared problems or shared solutions,” said
Maya Wiley, CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.
What differs, Wiley said, is the understanding “there has to be
opportunity for everyone.”</p>
<p>King himself worried the legal protections he dedicated his life to
realizing would not be followed by greater anti-discrimination efforts
or social programs. He proposed it would take white Americans embracing
a deeper kinship with Black Americans and engaging in economic and
social solidarity to see change.</p>
<p>A year before his 1968 assassination, King wrote in his final book
that giving a Black person their “due” often required “special
treatment.”</p>
<p>“I am aware of the fact that this has been a troublesome concept for
many liberals, since it conflicts with their traditional ideal of equal
opportunity and equal treatment of people according to their individual
merits,” King wrote in the 1967 book, “Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos
or Community.” “But this is a day which demands new thinking and the
reevaluation of old concepts.”</p>
<p>King’s advocacy for “new concepts” found an heir in the enactment of
affirmative action policies in workplaces and schools. Many advocates of
diversity, equity and inclusion policies see such programs as realizing
his vision, though that argument has come under withering scrutiny from
conservative activists.</p>
<p>Trump’s views on race have been criticized for decades. The federal
government sued Trump for allegedly discriminating against Black
apartment seekers in the 1970s. He was instrumental in promoting the
“birther” conspiracy theory that Obama was not born in the U.S. And his
campaign rhetoric about immigrants and urban communities since 2015 up
to November’s election has been derided as prejudiced.</p>
<p>As president, Trump enacted some criminal justice reform laws that
civil rights advocates praised but then proposed harsh crackdowns on
2020 racial reckoning protests.</p>
<p>In April, Trump did not dispute the notion that “anti-white racism”
now represents a greater problem in the U.S. than systemic racism
against Black Americans.</p>
<p>“I think there is a definite anti-white feeling in this country and
that can’t be allowed either,” Trump said during an interview with Time
magazine.</p>
<p>Janiyah Thomas, a spokesperson for the Trump transition, said Trump’s
inauguration would be “monumental, turning a new leaf and ushering in
the golden age of America” and said Americans should remember “wise
words” from King: “We must learn to live together as brothers or perish
together as fools.”</p>
<p>At the end of his life, King reflected on the early backlash to civil
rights, especially with integrated housing developments, interracial
marriage and necessary economic and social programs. He expressed
frustration with then-President Lyndon B. Johnson for prolonging the
Vietnam War rather than making a greater investment in anti-poverty
efforts.</p>
<p>“This is where the civil rights movement stands today. We will err
and falter as we climb the unfamiliar slopes of steep mountains, but
there is no alternative, well-trod, level path,” King wrote. “There will
be agonizing setbacks along with creative advances. Our consolation is
that no one can know the true taste of victory if he has never swallowed
defeat.”</p>

<h2 id="donald-trump-set-to-assume-us-presidency-again">Donald Trump set
to assume US presidency again</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Donald Trump returns to the U.S. presidency Monday with an
inauguration ceremony in Washington that will make him the first
president to serve non-consecutive terms since the 1890s.</p>
<p>Millions of Americans are expected to watch on television as the
78-year-old Trump takes the oath of office for a new four-year term in
the White House while President Joe Biden, 82, leaves the presidency
after a single term.  </p>
<p>The inauguration ceremony will be a scaled-down event due to frigid
weather, with about 600 people witnessing the change of power inside the
Capitol instead of the typical outdoor event where 250,000 people had
secured tickets.</p>
<p>The traditional inaugural parade along Pennsylvania Avenue from the
Capitol to the White House has also been canceled because of the
weather, with bands, marching units, drill teams and the like now
parading past Trump, his wife, Melania Trump and other officials in his
new administration at the nearby 20,000-seat Capital One Arena. Lavish
black-tie balls are still planned for Monday evening. </p>
<p>Trump pledged late Sunday to “act with historic speed and strength
and fix every single crisis facing our country,” as he spoke to
supporters in Washington.</p>
<p>“Tomorrow at noon, the curtain closes on four long years of American
decline, and we begin a brand new day of American strength and
prosperity,” Trump said.</p>
<p>He has pledged to sign a flurry of executive orders upon entering
office, including those undoing Biden administration policies. Prominent
among his pledges during the election campaign was carrying out mass
deportations of people who are in the country illegally.</p>
<p>Trump has also vowed to quickly impose heightened tariffs on key
trading partners, including Canada, China and Mexico.  </p>
<p>The incoming president says he plans to pardon many of the 1,500
supporters of his who stormed the Capitol building on Jan. 6, 2021, to
try to block Congress from certifying that Biden won the 2020 election.
Trump has called those arrested and convicted “patriots” and “hostages”
wrongly prosecuted. </p>
<p>Charges that Trump, a Republican, tried to illegally overturn his
2020 election loss to Biden were dropped when he defeated his Democratic
opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, in the 2024 election because of
a long-standing Justice Department policy against prosecuting sitting
presidents.   </p>
<p>Trump will become the first felon to serve as U.S. president, after
his conviction last year on 34 criminal charges linked to falsifying
business records to hide a $130,000 hush money payment to porn film star
Stormy Daniels, although a judge declined to penalize him in any
way. </p>
<p>Trump vowed for months to end Russia’s war on Ukraine before he takes
office, but in recent days his aides have said the goal now is to try to
reach a truce in the fighting in the first 100 days of his
administration, which would be around the end of April. </p>
<p>He also wants more oil drilling in the U.S. even though in 2023, U.S.
energy production exceeded consumption by a record amount, according to
the U.S. Energy Information Administration. </p>
<p>Two transgender issues have also drawn Trump’s attention.  </p>
<p>Trump has repeatedly referred to transgender women as men, telling
his supporters that he will ensure transgender women cannot compete in
women’s sports. </p>
<p>“I will keep men out of women’s sports, 100%, immediately, first
day,” Trump told one political rally during the campaign. He also
frequently has assailed gender-affirming care, which can include hormone
therapy. “On day one, I will revoke Joe Biden’s cruel policies on
so-called ‘gender affirming care.’”</p>

Korea braces for Trump’s policies with biggest-ever export finance
support</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korea pledged on Monday a record amount of
financing support for exporters to mitigate any negative impact from
changes in U.S. trade policies as Donald Trump was poised to be sworn in
for his second presidency.</p>
<p>The government plans to provide 360 trillion won, or $247.74 billion,
worth of policy financing to exporting companies through state-run banks
and institutions this year, according to a statement released by the
finance ministry.</p>
<p>“There are concerns that external uncertainty will be heightened
under the incoming U.S. administration and adversely affect exports,”
the ministry said.</p>
<p>The ministry said it would also boost insurance support to guard
against foreign exchange volatility to $966 million this year, from $827
million last year, and spending on government projects, such as trade
fairs and delegations, to $2 billion from $1.45 billion.</p>
<p>Sectors particularly under threat of new U.S. policies are
semiconductors and rechargeable batteries, the ministry said, whereas
defense, nuclear energy and shipbuilding sectors are seen as more
promising because of room for cooperation with the United States.</p>
<p>U.S. President-elect Trump, who takes office later on Monday, has
pledged to impose stiff tariffs on major trading partners, such as
Mexico, Canada and China, which are also expected to affect South Korean
companies running factories in those countries.</p>
<p>Economists say there are worries that the Trump administration will
introduce trade policies against South Korea too, after Asia’s
fourth-largest economy earned a record-high surplus of $55.7 billion in
trade with the U.S. in 2024, up 25.4% from 2023.</p>
<p>The Korea International Trade Association, South Korea’s biggest
group of exporting companies, projects export growth to slow to 1.8%
this year. Last year, South Korea’s exports rose 8.1% to a record high
of $683.7 billion, as sales to the U.S. rose 10.4%.</p>

<h2 id="the-state-of-the-economy-what-is-donald-trump-inheriting">The
state of the economy: What is Donald Trump inheriting?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Voters prioritized the economy in the 2024 election, sending Donald
Trump back to the White House. But what economic legacy is Joe Biden
passing on to the new administration? </p>
<p>“It’s the economy, stupid.” Coined by political strategist James
Carville, these famous words have become synonymous with U.S. election
success since 1992. </p>
<p>Despite the growing influence of issues like immigration, climate
change and foreign policy, many voters still prioritize economic factors
when casting their ballots. </p>
<p>President-elect Donald Trump claimed he made “the greatest economy in
U.S. history” during his first term and vows to do so again in 2025. But
a lot depends on what a president inherits from his predecessors. </p>
<p>Low unemployment rates and a soaring stock market built under former
President Barack Obama’s administration following the 2008 financial
crisis gave Trump a strong foundation the first time around. </p>
<p>So, what economic legacy will Trump inherit from Biden? </p>
<p>Simply put, high employment rates, strong GDP growth and low
inflation often characterize a healthy economy. </p>
<p>The country was still recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic when
Biden was sworn in, but the last four years have proven resilient. </p>
<p>Biden’s administration created almost 16 million new jobs in America
— a key sign of positive economic growth. </p>
<p>That good news was overshadowed for many Americans by inflation,
which reached a 40-year high in 2022, with prices increasing by 9.1%.
That impacted people’s purchasing power and made everyday items feel
expensive. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Annual inflation has now eased to around 3% but is still higher than
the Federal Reserve’s 2% target, and prices for many items remain
significantly higher than at the end of Trump’s first term.</p>
<p>While real wages have since increased in America, workers may still
feel the strain of stubbornly high grocery prices.</p>
<p>This was a global issue linked to supply chain challenges and
Russia’s war with Ukraine, and ordinary people paid the price. But
massive deficit spending under Biden to head off the threat of a major
recession also contributed.</p>
<p>Biden has preferred to emphasize the promising picture of the jobs
market he’s passing on, noting that the United States recorded its
lowest unemployment rate in more than half a century during his
term. </p>
<p>About 2.7 million jobs were lost during Trump’s first term, partially
due to the COVID-19 pandemic. So, he’ll face pressure to turn that
legacy around. But Trump has already suggested mass layoffs across
federal departments during his second term, which could increase
unemployment rates if implemented. </p>
<p>Another broad signal of a healthy economy is the increased value of
goods and services, or GDP, which shows whether an economy is
growing. </p>
<p>The United States has long had the largest GDP in the world,
surpassing nations such as India and China. </p>
<p>GDP rose 7.6% during Trump’s first administration and increased by
11.8% under Biden, suggesting a strong post-pandemic recovery. </p>
<p>Generally speaking, Biden’s economic legacy is one of high
employment, recovering GDP and declining inflation.</p>
<p>But no president ever inherits a clean slate. The federal debt stands
at $36.1 trillion, and public opinion about the economy is, at best,
lukewarm. </p>
<p>Some financial experts predict inflation may continue declining in
2025, but a broader context of geopolitical tensions, trade wars and
climate change may also shape America’s financial future. </p>
<p>Trump’s task will be to sustain economic momentum while navigating
the complexities of a rapidly evolving world.</p>

TikTok grew from a fun app for teens into a potential national security
threat</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SAN FRANCISCO — If it feels like TikTok has been around forever,
that’s probably because it has, at least if you’re measuring via
internet time. What’s now in question is whether it will be around much
longer and, if so, in what form?</p>
<p>Starting in 2017, when the Chinese social video app merged with its
competitor Musical.ly, TikTok has grown from a niche teen app into a
global trendsetter. While, of course, also emerging as a potential
national security threat, according to U.S. officials.</p>
<p>On April 24, President Joe Biden signed legislation requiring TikTok
parent ByteDance to sell to a U.S. owner within a year or to shut down.
TikTok and its China-based parent company, ByteDance, filed a lawsuit
against the U.S., claiming the security concerns were overblown and the
law should be struck down because it violates the First Amendment.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court on Friday unanimously upheld the federal law
banning TikTok, and the popular short form video service went dark in
the U.S. — just hours before the ban was set to begin.</p>
<p>Here’s how TikTok came to this juncture:</p>
<p>March 2012</p>
<p>ByteDance is founded in China by entrepreneur Zhang Yimin. Its first
hit product is Toutiao, a personalized news aggregator for Chinese
users.</p>
<p>July 2014</p>
<p>Startup Musical.ly, later known for an eponymous app used to post
short lipsyncing music videos, is founded in China by entrepreneur Alex
Zhu.</p>
<p>July 2015</p>
<p>Musical.ly hits #1 in the Apple App Store, following a design change
that made the company’s logo visible when users shared their videos.</p>
<p>2016</p>
<p>ByteDance launches Douyin, a video sharing app for Chinese users. Its
popularity inspires the company to spin off a version for foreign
audiences called TikTok.</p>
<p>November 2017</p>
<p>ByteDance acquires Musical.ly for $1 billion. Nine months later,
ByteDance merges it with TikTok.</p>
<p>Powered by an algorithm that encourages binge-watching, users begin
to share a wide variety of video on the app, including dance moves,
kitchen food preparation and various “challenges” to perform, record and
post acts that range from serious to satirical.</p>
<p>February 2019</p>
<p>Rapper Lil Nas X releases the country-trap song “Old Town Road” on
TikTok, where it goes viral and pushes the song to a record 17 weeks in
the #1 spot on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The phenomenon kicks off a
wave of TikTok videos from musical artists who suddenly see TikTok as a
critical way to reach fans.</p>
<p>TikTok settles federal charges of violating U.S. child-privacy laws
and agrees to pay a $5.7 million fine.</p>
<p>September 2019</p>
<p>The Washington Post reports that while images of Hong Kong democracy
protests and police crackdowns are common on most social media sites,
they are strangely absent on TikTok. The same story notes that TikTok
posts with the #trump2020 tag received more than 70 million views.</p>
<p>The company insists that TikTok content moderation, conducted in the
U.S., is not responsible and says the app is a place for entertainment,
not politics.</p>
<p>The Guardian reports on internal documents that reportedly detail how
TikTok instructs its moderators to delete or limit the reach of videos
touching on topics sensitive to China such as the 1989 Tiananmen Square
protests and subsequent massacre, Tibetan independence or the sanctioned
religious group Falun Gong.</p>
<p>October 2019</p>
<p>U.S. politicians begin to raise alarms about TikTok’s influence,
calling for a federal investigations of its Musical.ly acquisition and a
national security probe into TikTok and other Chinese-owned apps. That
investigation begins in November, according to news reports.</p>
<p>December 2019</p>
<p>The Pentagon recommends that all U.S. military personnel delete
TikTok from all phones, personal and government-issued. Some services
ban the app on military-owned phones. In January, the Pentagon bans the
app from all military phones.</p>
<p>TikTok becomes the second-most downloaded app in the world, according
to data from analytics firm SensorTower.</p>
<p>May 2020</p>
<p>Privacy groups file a complaint alleging TikTok is still violating
U.S. child-protection laws and flouting a 2019 settlement agreement. The
company “takes the issue of safely seriously” and continues to improve
safeguards, it says.</p>
<p>TikTok hires former Disney executive Kevin Mayer as its chief
executive officer in an apparent attempt to improve its U.S. relations.
Mayer resigns three months later.</p>
<p>July 2020</p>
<p>India bans TikTok and dozens of other Chinese apps in response to a
border clash with China.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump says he is considering banning TikTok as
retaliation for China’s alleged mishandling of the COVID-19
pandemic.</p>
<p>August 2020</p>
<p>Trump issues a sweeping but vague executive order banning American
companies from any “transaction” with ByteDance and its subsidiaries,
including TikTok. Several days later, he issues a second order demanding
that ByteDance divest itself of TikTok’s U.S. operations within 90
days.</p>
<p>Microsoft confirms it is exploring acquisition of TikTok. The deal
never materializes; neither does a similar overture from Oracle and
Walmart. TikTok, meanwhile, sues the Trump administration for alleged
violation of due process in its executive orders.</p>
<p>November 2020</p>
<p>Joe Biden is elected president. He doesn’t offer new policy on TikTok
and won’t take office until January, but Trump’s plans to force a sale
of TikTok start to unravel anyway. The Trump administration extends the
deadlines it had imposed on ByteDance and TikTok and eventually lets
them slide altogether.</p>
<p>February 2021</p>
<p>Newly sworn-in President Joe Biden postpones the legal cases
involving Trump’s plan to ban TikTok, effectively bringing them to a
halt.</p>
<p>September 2021</p>
<p>TikTok announces it has more than a billion monthly active users.</p>
<p>December 2021</p>
<p>A Wall Street Journal report finds TikTok algorithms can flood teens
with a torrent of harmful material such as videos recommending extreme
dieting, a form of eating disorder.</p>
<p>February 2022</p>
<p>TikTok announces new rules to deter the spread of harmful material
such as viral hoaxes and promotion of eating disorders.</p>
<p>April 2022</p>
<p>“The Unofficial Bridgerton Musical,” a project created by two fans of
the Netflix show as a TikTok project, wins the Grammy for Best Musical
Theater Album.</p>
<p>TikTok becomes the most downloaded app in the world, beating out
Instagram, according to SensorTower data.</p>
<p>June 2022</p>
<p>BuzzFeed reports that China-based ByteDance employees have repeatedly
accessed the nonpublic information of TikTok users, based on leaked
recordings from more than 80 internal TikTok meetings. TikTok responds
with a vague comment touting its commitment to security that doesn’t
directly address the BuzzFeed report.</p>
<p>TikTok also announces it has migrated its user data to U.S. servers
managed by the U.S. tech firm Oracle. But that doesn’t prevent fresh
alarm among U.S. officials about the risk of Chinese authorities
accessing U.S. user data.</p>
<p>December 2022</p>
<p>FBI Director Christopher Wray raises national security concerns about
TikTok, warning that Chinese officials could manipulate the app’s
recommendation algorithm for influence operations.</p>
<p>ByteDance also said it fired four employees who accessed data on
journalists from Buzzfeed News and The Financial Times while attempting
to track down leaks of confidential materials about the company.</p>
<p>February 2023</p>
<p>The White House gives federal agencies 30 days to ensure TikTok is
deleted from all government-issued mobile devices. Both the FBI and the
Federal Communications Commission warn that ByteDance could share TikTok
user data with China’s authoritarian government.</p>
<p>March 2023</p>
<p>Legislators grill TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew at a six-hour congressional
hearing where Chew, a native of Singapore, attempts to push back on
assertions that TikTok and ByteDance are tools of the Chinese
government.</p>
<p>January 2024</p>
<p>TikTok said it was restricting a tool some researchers use to analyze
popular videos on the platform.</p>
<p>March 2024</p>
<p>A bill to ban TikTok or force its sale to a U.S. company gathers
steam in Congress. TikTok brings dozens of its creators to Washington to
tell lawmakers to back off, while emphasizing changes the company has
made to protect user data. TikTok also annoys legislators by sending
notifications to users urging them to “speak up now” or risk seeing
TikTok banned; users then flood congressional offices with calls.</p>
<p>The House of Representatives passes the TikTok ban-or-sell bill.</p>
<p>April 2024</p>
<p>The Senate follows suit, sending the bill to President Biden, who
signs it.</p>
<p>May 2024</p>
<p>TikTok and its Chinese parent company ByteDance sue the U.S. federal
government to challenge a law that would force the sale of ByteDance’s
stake or face a ban, saying that the law is unconstitutional.</p>
<p>June 2024</p>
<p>Former President Donald Trump joins TikTok and begins posting
campaign-related content.</p>
<p>July 2024</p>
<p>Vice President Kamala Harris joins TikTok and also begins posting
campaign-related material.</p>
<p>Dec. 6, 2024</p>
<p>A federal appeals court panel unanimously upheld a law that could
lead to a ban on TikTok, handing a resounding defeat to the popular
social media platform as it fights for its survival in the U.S. The
panel of judges rebuffed the company’s challenge of the statute, which
it argued had ran afoul of the First Amendment.</p>
<p>Dec. 27, 2024</p>
<p>President-elect Donald Trump asked the Supreme Court to pause the
potential TikTok ban from going into effect until his administration can
pursue a “political resolution” to the issue.</p>
<p>Jan. 17, 2025</p>
<p>The Supreme Court unanimously upheld the federal law banning TikTok
beginning unless it’s sold by its China-based parent company, holding
that the risk to national security posed by its ties to China overcomes
concerns about limiting speech by the app. A ban is set to into effect
on Jan. 19, 2025.</p>
<p>Jan. 18, 2025</p>
<p>TikTok users in the United States were prevented from watching videos
on the popular social media platform just hours before a federal ban was
set to take effect.</p>
<p>“A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S.,” a message in the
app said. “Unfortunately, that means you can’t use TikTok for now.”</p>
<p>The company’s app was also removed from prominent app stores,
including the ones operated by Apple and Google, while its website told
users that the short-form video platform was no longer available.</p>
<p>Jan. 19, 2025</p>
<p>Shortly after the app went dark for U.S. users, Trump said he would
issue an executive order upon taking office to grant TikTok an extension
so that it could remain online.</p>
<p>A few hours later, TikTok restored service to users in the United
States, saying that Trump had provided “the necessary clarity and
assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties
providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans.”</p>

<h2 id="washington-braces-for-trump-inauguration">Washington braces for
Trump Inauguration</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Metal fences, concrete barriers and security checkpoints
still line many the walkways and cross streets of the National Mall –
extending from the U.S. Capitol down past some of Washington’s most
noted landmarks – as the nation prepares to swear in its 47th
president.</p>
<p>But while the 0.6-square-kilometer (146-acre) swath of land is often
the highlight of many a tourist visit, it is no longer the focus of
security efforts for when President-elect Donald Trump takes the oath of
office for a second time.</p>
<p>Frigid temperatures forecast for much of Monday led Trump to move the
festivities inside – the inauguration to the U.S. Capitol Rotunda and
the traditional inaugural parade to the nearby Capital One Arena.</p>
<p>The changes, first announced Friday, presented a last-minute hitch
for security and law enforcement officials, who had been planning for
the inauguration for the past year.</p>
<p>And it has left them, and the approximately 25,000 law enforcement
and military personnel charged with security, with multiple
challenges.</p>
<p>“We will shift those assets,” said the U.S. Secret Service’s Matt
McCool, briefing reporters Sunday.</p>
<p>“We have not cut anything from what our original plan was,” he said.
“I’m very confident, with our partners here, we will be ready.”</p>
<p>The numbers could make the situation especially trying.</p>
<p>Organizers had expected about 250,000 ticketed guests to descend on
the U.S. Capitol and the National Mall to watch the inauguration.</p>
<p>Only a select few will be allowed into the Capitol Rotunda, which
accommodates just 600 people. And the Capital One Area seats just
20,000.</p>
<p>If even just a fraction of the 250,000 people who had planned on
attending the inauguration try to get to the arena, there could be a
crunch.</p>
<p>Washington Metropolitan Police Chief Pamela Smith said Sunday her
force, bolstered by and about 4,000 police officers from across the
U.S., will be ready.</p>
<p>“Nothing has really changed,” Smith told reporters. “The police
officers that were committed and dedicated to coming here, we’ll be
flexible in how we’ll adjust [their] movement. … So, we will still have
police officers in places and spaces around our city as we initially
planned.”</p>
<p>Some of those officers, Smith said, will still be assigned to the
original parade route in anticipation that some people will try to get a
glimpse of the presidential motorcade as it goes by.</p>
<p>U.S. Capitol Police said they also anticipate having officers on the
periphery of the West Front of the Capitol – now closed off with the
inauguration moved indoors – ready to direct ticketed guests who will no
longer be able to attend.</p>
<p>In addition, the inaugural security contingent, which includes the
U.S. Secret Service, the FBI, U.S. Capitol Police, Washington
Metropolitan Police, and some 7,800 members of the U.S. Army and Air
National Guard, will all be coordinated from a command center linked
into an expanded network of cameras keeping watch on the city.</p>
<p>And though security measures in some areas, including along parts of
the National Mall, have been relaxed, officials said there will be
plenty of reminders for anyone coming to Washington that this is no
ordinary time.</p>
<p>“They will see tactical teams,” McCool said, during an earlier
briefing with reporters last week. “They’ll see, officers and agents on
rooftops, they’ll see checkpoints. They’ll see road closures and
barriers in concrete.”</p>
<p>Even before the inauguration was moved inside, officials had been
preparing for what they described as “a higher threat environment,”
cautioning the security plans for this inauguration were already more
robust than in the past.</p>
<p>“The biggest threat, I think, for all of us remains the lone actor,”
said Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger. “That threat … remains the biggest
justification for us being on this heightened stage state of alert.”</p>
<p>Those concerns were heightened following the New Year’s Day terror
attack and truck ramming in New Orleans and the Las Vegas Cybertruck
explosion outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas,
Nevada.</p>
<p>Earlier this month Capitol Police arrested two men suspected of
trying to disrupt the state funeral for former U.S. President Jimmy
Carter, one who tried to bring knives and a machete into the Capitol and
another who set their car on fire.</p>
<p>Research, including a recent survey by the University of Chicago
Project on Security and Threats, adds to the concerns.</p>
<p>“Over 5% of the American public supports the use of force to prevent
Donald Trump from becoming president,” Robert Pape, the project’s
director, told VOA.</p>
<p>“That equates to 14,000,000 American adults,” he said. “That’s an
unfortunately disturbing number.”</p>
<p>Already, Trump was also the target of two attempted
assassinations.</p>
<p>There is also an ongoing threat from Iran. Despite repeated Iranian
denials, U.S. security and law enforcement officials have accused Tehran
of trying to kill Trump, unveiling one plot set to be carried out last
year, in the days after the U.S. presidential election.</p>
<p>For now, though, U.S. officials see no signs of impending
trouble.</p>
<p>“The FBI is not currently tracking any credible or specific threats
to the inaugural ceremony or the Capitol complex,” the bureau’s
Washington Field Office told VOA. “We will continue to work closely with
our partners to share information and identify and disrupt any threats
that may emerge.”</p>
<p>Another source for concern is the tens of thousands of protesters,
though so far, there have been no major incidents.</p>
<p>Saturday’s People’s March, which was permitted to have as many as
50,000 protesters, sparked only brief tensions with Trump
supporters.</p>
<p>Another group, called We Fight Back, has permits for protests
involving about 10,000 people in across several locations on Monday.</p>
<p>“Please note that [we] will ensure your right to peacefully protest
and assemble,” said the Metropolitan Police Department’s Smith.</p>
<p>“However, I want to reiterate, as I always have, that violence,
destruction and unlawful behavior will not be tolerated,” she said.
“Offenders will face swift and decisive consequences … anyone who thinks
that they can come into this city to destroy property, we will be
prepared to deal with them.”</p>
<p>Kim Lewis contributed to this report.</p>

id="american-journalist-austin-tices-mother-in-damascus-hopes-to-find-missing-son">American
journalist Austin Tice’s mother, in Damascus, hopes to find missing
son</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Damascus, Syria — The mother of American journalist Austin Tice, who
was taken captive during a reporting trip to Syria in August 2012,
arrived in Damascus to step up the search for her son and said she hopes
she can take him home with her.  </p>
<p>Tice, who worked as a freelance reporter for The Washington Post and
McClatchy, was one of the first U.S. journalists to make it into Syria
after the outbreak of the civil war.</p>
<p>His mother, Debra Tice, drove into the Syrian capital from Lebanon
with Nizar Zakka, the head of Hostage Aid Worldwide, an organization
which is searching for Austin and believes he is still in Syria.</p>
<p>“It’d be lovely to put my arms around Austin while I’m here. It’d be
the best,” Debra Tice told Reuters in the Syrian capital Saturday, which
she last visited in 2015 to meet with Syrian authorities about her son,
before they stopped granting her visas.</p>
<p>The overthrow of Bashar al-Assad’s regime in December by Syrian
rebels has allowed her to visit again from her home in Texas.</p>
<p>“I feel very strongly that Austin’s here, and I think he knows I’m
here… I’m here,” she said.</p>
<p>Debra Tice and Zakka are hoping to meet with Syria’s new authorities,
including the head of its new administration Ahmed al-Sharaa, to push
for information about Austin. They are also optimistic that U.S.
President-elect Donald Trump, who will be inaugurated Monday, will take
up the cause.</p>
<p>“I am hoping to get some answers. And of course, you know, we have
[the] inauguration on Monday, and I think that should be a huge change,”
she said.</p>
<p>“I know that President Trump is quite a negotiator, so I have a lot
of confidence there. But now we have an unknown on this (Syrian) side.
It’s difficult to know, if those that are coming in even have the
information about him,” she said.</p>
<p>Her son, now 43, was taken captive in August 2012, while traveling
through the Damascus suburb of Daraya.</p>
<p>Reuters reported earlier that in 2013 Tice, a former Marine, managed
to slip out of his cell and was seen moving between houses in the
streets of Damascus’ upscale Mazzeh neighborhood. The New York Times
first reported that brief escape and recapture.</p>
<p>He was recaptured soon after his escape, likely by forces who
answered directly to Assad, current and former U.S. officials said.</p>
<p>Debra Tice came to Syria in 2012 and 2015 to meet with Syrian
authorities, who never confirmed that Tice was in their custody, both
she and Zakka said.</p>
<p>She criticized outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration,
saying they did not negotiate hard enough for her son’s release, even in
recent months.</p>
<p>“We certainly felt like President Biden was very well positioned to
do everything possible to bring Austin home, right? I mean, this was the
end of his career. This would be a wonderful thing for him to do. So, we
had an expectation. He pardoned his own son, right? So, where’s my
son?”</p>
<p>Debra Tice said her “mind was just spinning” as she drove across the
Lebanese border into Syria and teared up as she spoke about the tens of
thousands whose loved ones were held in Assad’s notorious prison system
and whose fate remains unknown.</p>
<p>“I have a lot in common with a lot of Syrian mothers and families,
and just thinking about how this is affecting them — do they have the
same hope that I do, that they’re going to open a door, that they’re
going to see their loved one?”</p>

id="trumps-inauguration-will-be-first-attended-by-foreign-leaders">Trump’s
inauguration will be first attended by foreign leaders</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>For the first time in U.S. history, a president-elect will welcome
foreign leaders for one of the most American political traditions — the
peaceful transfer of power.</p>
<p>President-elect Donald Trump invited Chinese President Xi Jinping and
conservative world leaders such as Argentine President Javier Milei and
Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni to the inauguration. Xi sent his vice
president as his representative.</p>
<p>No heads of state have previously made an official visit to the U.S.
for the inauguration. Some of them, such as Milei and Paraguay’s
President Santiago Peña, were special guests Saturday night at the
Hispanic Inaugural Ball, where several of Trump’s nominees for key
Cabinet positions made appearances. That included U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio,
chosen to lead the State Department, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., tapped
to head the Health and Human Services Department.</p>
<p>Here is a look at the foreign leaders who are coming to Washington
for the 60th inauguration:</p>
<p>China</p>
<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping was the first foreign leader whose
invitation to the inauguration became public in December. Xi will not
attend but is sending Vice President Han Zheng.</p>
<p>The announcement to dispatch Han was made Friday by the country’s
foreign ministry, and it comes as the rivalry between the U.S. and China
may escalate under Trump. Several of Trump’s Cabinet picks are known
China hawks, including Rubio, who has called China “the most potent,
dangerous and near-peer adversary this nation has ever confronted.”</p>
<p>Trump has vowed to impose tariffs and other measures on China. But
the two leaders spoke on the phone Friday and discussed trade, fentanyl
and TikTok. Trump said the call was a “very good one.”</p>
<p>Argentina</p>
<p>Milei was the first foreign leader to meet with Trump after the
Nov. 5 election, traveling from Buenos Aires to the president-elect’s
Mar-a-Lago club.</p>
<p>Milei is scheduled to attend one of the official inaugural balls that
Trump will attend on Inauguration Day, as well as the swearing-in
ceremony. The self-described “anarcho-capitalist,” who has carried out
an audacious economic agenda in the South American nation, got a hug
from Vivek Ramaswamy, a Trump insider, on stage at Hispanic ball before
delivering remarks.</p>
<p>Ramaswamy called him “an inspiration.” Milei also receives praise
frequently from billionaire Elon Musk for implementing a series of
austerity measures that laid off tens of thousands of government
workers, froze public infrastructure projects and imposed wage and
pension freezes below inflation.</p>
<p>Musk and Ramaswamy will lead a non-governmental effort to cut federal
government spending, regulations and personnel.</p>
<p>Milei hopes good relations with the U.S. could help Argentina reach a
new deal with the International Monetary Fund.</p>
<p>Italy</p>
<p>Meloni is another leader who has recently visited Mar-a-Lago. Her
weekly agenda says she will attend the swearing-in ceremony.</p>
<p>Meloni kept unexpectedly good relations with Democratic President Joe
Biden but is likely to form a more natural alliance with Trump. She is
considered a key interlocutor between Europe and the U.S.</p>
<p>Georgia</p>
<p>Pro-Western former Georgia President Salome Zourabichvili will attend
the ceremony as a guest of Republican U.S. Rep. Joe Wilson. Georgia has
been wracked by protests following a parliamentary election that
opposition groups alleged was rigged.</p>
<p>She has maintained she is still the legitimate leader of the former
Soviet republic after Mikheil Kavelashvili was inaugurated as president
late last month from a party that critics have accused of becoming
increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow. Kavelashvili’s
ruling party has denied those accusations.</p>
<p>Zourabichvili told Fox News that Georgia could be “the big success
for America or the big problem for America” in the region because
“Russia is always trying to dominate.”</p>
<p>France</p>
<p>French President Emmanuel Macron, who met with Trump last month in
Paris during the Notre Dame Cathedral reopening, won’t be at Trump’s
inauguration. But far-right figures from the country have said they are
traveling for the inauguration.</p>
<p>Eric Zemmour, a talk show pundit turned conservative politician, and
his partner, Sarah Knafo, a member of the European Parliament, said they
will attend. Zemmour was convicted multiple times of inciting racist or
religious hatred.</p>
<p>Prominent far-right politician Marion Maréchal said in a statement
that she would go as well. She is a member of the European Parliament
and niece of the leading conservative figure in France eyeing the 2027
presidential election.</p>
<p>Who else?</p>
<p>The offices of Ecuadorean President Daniel Noboa and Paraguayan
President Santiago Pena have said they were invited to the inauguration
and planned to attend.</p>
<p>Pena, a conservative economist turned politician, praised Trump’s
agenda and said at the Hispanic ball that he hoped for deeper ties
between U.S. and Latin America.</p>
<p>Taiwan sent legislative speaker Han Kuo-yu and seven others to
Washington for Trump’s inauguration, but Taiwan’s foreign ministry said
its delegates would not attend the ceremony now that it has been moved
indoors because of cold weather.</p>
<p>Taiwan’s official Central News Agency, citing Taiwan’s foreign
ministry, also reported that the delegates would meet American
politicians and think tank scholars to cement Taiwan-U.S. relations.
It’s unclear if they will meet Trump.</p>
<p>Trump has criticized Taiwan for pulling some of the semiconductor
industry from the U.S., but U.S.-Taiwan relations also significantly
improved during his first term.</p>
<p>On a phone call Friday between Trump and Xi, the Chinese president
urged the incoming U.S. leader to approach the Taiwan issue “with
prudence” because it is about China’s sovereignty and territorial
integrity. Beijing claims the self-governed island as Chinese territory
and vows to annex it by force if necessary.</p>

promises ‘brand new day,’ harsh immigration limits at pre-inauguration
victory rally</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Donald Trump told thousands of roaring supporters he
would impose severe limits on immigration on his first day in office,
vowing to swiftly fulfill the central promise of his presidential
campaign on Sunday at a rally inside a packed Washington arena a day
before he returns to power.</p>
<p>“By the time the sun sets tomorrow, the invasion of our country will
have come to a halt,” he said to cheers at a “Make America Great Again
Victory Rally” at the Capital One Arena.</p>
<p>Trump repeated his campaign pledge to launch the largest deportation
effort in U.S. history, which would remove millions of immigrants. An
operation of that scale, however, would likely take years and be hugely
costly.</p>
<p>The rally resembled the free-wheeling campaign speeches that have
been a Trump staple since his first White House run in 2016.</p>
<p>“This is the greatest political movement in American history, and 75
days ago, we achieved the most epic political victory our country has
ever seen,” he said. “Starting tomorrow, I will act with historic speed
of strength and fix every single crisis facing our country.”</p>
<p>The event marked his first major address in Washington since his
speech on Jan. 6, 2021, that preceded the storming of the U.S. Capitol
by an angry mob of his supporters. Trump has said he will pardon many of
the more than 1,500 people convicted or charged in connection with the
attack.</p>
<p>Trump said he would “get radical woke ideologies the hell out of our
military” and order the military to construct a missile defense shield
over the U.S., though he has yet to offer details on how to carry it
out.</p>
<p>He also promised to reverse the “over-classification” of government
documents, a seeming reference to his federal indictment for retaining
classified papers after leaving office. That case, along with a separate
federal indictment for plotting to overturn the 2020 election, was
dropped by the Justice Department after Trump won in November.</p>
<p>The indoor hockey and basketball venue will also host some of
Monday’s inauguration festivities after forecasts of bitter cold
prompted officials to move the planned outdoor events inside.</p>
<p>He also pledged to release classified documents relating to the
assassinations of President John F. Kennedy, his brother Robert Kennedy
and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.</p>
<p>Earlier on Sunday, Trump had breakfast with Republican U.S. senators
at Blair House, the guest quarters across from the White House. John
Cornyn, Susan Collins, Ted Cruz, Rick Scott and Tim Scott were among the
attendees seen leaving the event.</p>
<p>He later placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at
Arlington National Cemetery outside Washington. Trump saluted the tomb
as a military bugler played “Taps.”</p>
<p>Ahead of the event, Trump’s fans, many dressed in the campaign’s
trademark red jackets and MAGA hats, waited in a cold, driving rain
along several downtown Washington blocks, some chanting “USA! USA!”</p>
<p>Val Tordjman, 58, had traveled across the country from Denver with
tickets to watch the inauguration. When he heard the ceremony was being
moved inside, notably cutting the size of the in-person audience, he
said, “I felt like crying.”</p>
<p>Tordjman said he planned to spend the night on the street next to the
arena, despite temperatures forecast to plunge to around 19 degrees
Fahrenheit (-7 degrees Celsius). He said he had yet to see Trump in
person.</p>
<p>“This is a once in a lifetime opportunity,” he said.</p>
<p>Large swaths of the streets around the U.S. Capitol and White House
have been blocked off by steel fences since last week, and police were
visible throughout the city.</p>
<p>TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew planned to attend the rally, hours after the
company announced it was restoring its service thanks to Trump’s promise
to delay a U.S. ban that took effect on Sunday. Chew is also expected to
join other tech executives at Trump’s inauguration on Monday, including
the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, a close Trump confidant who made a
brief appearance on stage with Trump.</p>
<p>Trump took credit for bringing TikTok back online and said the U.S.
would do a “joint venture” to save the app alongside bidders to buy the
company.</p>
<p>The inauguration is scheduled for noon ET (1700 GMT) on Monday, when
Trump will take the presidential oath of office inside the rotunda of
the Capitol building, after the cold weather prompted organizers to move
the ceremony indoors. Approximately 25,000 law enforcement personnel
will be on hand to provide security.</p>

Los Angeles firefighters brace for ‘last’ dangerous winds</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Los Angeles — Exhausted Los Angeles firefighters braced Sunday for
the return of yet more dangerously strong gusts, as California’s
governor slammed “hurricane-force winds of misinformation” surrounding
blazes that have killed 27 people.  </p>
<p>The two largest fires, which have obliterated almost 16,000 hectares
(40,000 acres) and razed entire neighborhoods of the second biggest U.S.
city, were for the first time both more than half contained, officials
announced.</p>
<p>But the National Weather Service warned that powerful winds and low
humidity would again bring “dangerous high-end red flag fire weather
conditions” from Monday, with gusts up to 130 kilometers (80 miles) per
hour potentially returning.</p>
<p>“This is the last… we hope, of the extreme” wind events, said
Governor Gavin Newsom.</p>
<p>It will be “the fourth major wind event just in the last three months
— we only had two in the prior four years,” he told MSNBC’s “Inside with
Jen Psaki” show.</p>
<p>Officials were accused of being unprepared for the outbreak of fires
this month. Now, 135 fire engines and their crews are prepositioned to
tackle new outbreaks, along with helicopters and bulldozers, said
Newsom.</p>
<p>Firefighters, who since Jan. 7 have been battling flames, digging
trenches and uprooting vegetation to create perimeters around fires
non-stop, said the largest conflagration, the Palisades Fire, was 52%
contained.</p>
<p>That fire has killed at least 10 people.</p>
<p>Evacuation orders were lifted this weekend for dozens of
neighborhoods in upscale western Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Farther east, the Eaton Fire, which killed at least 17 in the
Altadena suburbs, is 81% contained.</p>
<p>More residents were able to return to their homes there too. Others
reunited with missing pets they had feared were dead.</p>
<p>Serena Null told AFP of her joy at finding her cat, Domino, after
having to leave him behind as flames devoured her family home in
Altadena.</p>
<p>The pair were reunited at NGO Pasadena Humane, where Domino —
suffering singed paws, a burnt nose and a high level of stress — was
taken after being rescued.</p>
<p>“I just was so relieved and just so happy that he was here,” a
tearful Null told AFP.   </p>
<p>No ‘magical spigot’  </p>
<p>As Los Angeles learns the true scale of the devastation, political
bickering has intensified.</p>
<p>Donald Trump, set to be sworn in Monday as U.S. president, has
sharply criticized California officials.</p>
<p>He falsely claimed that Newsom had blocked the diversion of “excess
rain and snow melt from the North.” Los Angeles’s water supplies are
mainly fed via aqueducts and canals originating from entirely separate
river basins farther east.</p>
<p>“What’s not helpful or beneficial… is these wild-eyed fantasies… that
somehow there’s a magical spigot in northern California that just can be
turned on, all of a sudden there will be rain or water flowing
everywhere,” said Newsom.</p>
<p>Citing conversations with firefighters on the ground during 100
mile-per-hour windstorms that first sparked the fires, Newsom added:
“There’s not a municipal system in the world that’s designed to address
a fire of that acuity.”  </p>
<p>The governor blamed Elon Musk — the Tesla and SpaceX owner poised to
play a key role advising the incoming administration — “and others” for
“hurricane-force winds of mis- and dis-information that can divide a
country on a myriad of issues.”</p>
<p>President-elect Trump said he hopes to visit the region soon,
“probably at the end of the week.”</p>
<p>Emergency officials Sunday continued to survey the damage, going
house-to-house with dogs in search of human remains, and ramping up the
daunting task of clearing endless tons of debris.</p>
<p>The region has experienced its driest start of the year since 1850,
according to Newsom. Well into its typical rainy season, Los Angeles has
had almost no rain since May.</p>
<p>Although rain is still not expected imminently, Newsom warned of the
need to prepare “for potential flooding in the next week or two,” as
rain, when it comes, pours down hillsides denuded by the fires.</p>
<p>“I prepositioned 2,500 National Guard. We’re going to start some
sandbagging operations,” he said.</p>
<p>“We’re dealing with extremes that we have never dealt with in the
past” due to the changing climate, said the governor.</p>

<h2 id="keke-palmers-one-of-them-days-mufasa-race-for-no.-1">Keke
Palmer’s ‘One of Them Days,’ ‘Mufasa’ race for No. 1</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Keke Palmer buddy comedy “One of Them Days” opened
in first place on the North American box office charts on a particularly
slow Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend. </p>
<p>The R-rated Sony release earned $11.6 million from 2,675 theaters,
according to studio estimates Sunday, beating Disney’s “Mufasa: The Lion
King” by a hair. By the end of Monday’s holiday, “Mufasa” will have the
edge, however. </p>
<p>“One of Them Days” cost only $14 million to produce, which it is
expected to earn by Monday. The very well-reviewed buddy comedy stars
Palmer and SZA as friends and roommates scrambling to get money for rent
before their landlord evicts them. Notably it’s the first Black
female-led theatrical comedy since “Girls Trip” came out in 2017 and it
currently carries a stellar 96% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. </p>
<p>But the marketplace was also quite weak overall. The total box office
for Friday, Saturday and Sunday will add up to less than $80 million,
according to data from Comscore, making it one of the worst Martin
Luther King Jr. holiday weekends since 1997. </p>
<p>“For an individual film like ‘One of Them Days’ this was a great
weekend,” said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for
Comscore. “You can still find success stories within what is overall a
low grossing weekend for movie theaters.” </p>
<p>The Walt Disney Co.’s “Mufasa” was close by in second place with
$11.5 million from the weekend, its fifth playing in theaters. Globally,
the Barry Jenkins-directed prequel has made $588 million. It even beat a
brand-new offering, the Blumhouse horror “Wolf Man,” which debuted in
third place with $10.6 million from 3,354 North American theaters. </p>
<p>Writer-director Leigh Whannell’s monster tale starring Christopher
Abbott and Julia Garner did not enter theaters with great reviews. It
currently carries a 53% on Rotten Tomatoes. Reviews don’t generally
affect the success of horror movies in their first weekend, but
audiences also gave it a lackluster C- CinemaScore in exit polls. The
Blumhouse production and Universal Pictures release cost a reported $25
million to make and is expected to reach $12 million by the close of
Monday’s holiday. </p>
<p>“Sonic the Hedgehog 3” was in fourth place with $8.6 million and “Den
of Thieves 2” rounded out the top five with $6.6 million. </p>
<p>In specialty releases, Brady Corbert’s 215-minute post-war epic “The
Brutalist” expanded to 388 screens where it made nearly $2 million over
the weekend. A24 reported that it sold out various 70mm and IMAX
showings. The studio also re-released its Colman Domingo drama “Sing
Sing” in theaters and prisons, where over 1 million incarcerated people
in 46 states were able to view the film. </p>
<p>The Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend has seen major successes
in the past. Dergarabedian noted “Bad Boys for Life,” which had a
three-day opening of $62.5 million in 2020, and “American Sniper,” which
earned $89.3 in its first weekend in wide release in 2016. </p>
<p>“This is a year that’s going to get a big boost starting with
‘Captain America: Brave New World’ and ‘Paddington in Peru’ in
February,” Dergarabedian said. </p>
<p>Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian
theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released
Monday. </p>

<h2 id="donald-trump-set-to-assume-us-presidency-again-1">Donald Trump
set to assume US presidency again</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A hallmark of the nearly 250-year American democracy is the
quadrennial peaceful transfer of presidential power, and it is set to
unfold again on Monday, with Donald Trump, the 45th president until he
lost his 2020 reelection bid, set to be inaugurated as the country’s
47th leader after winning last November’s election.</p>
<p>Millions of Americans are expected to watch on television as the
78-year-old Trump takes the oath of office for a new four-year term in
the White House while President Joe Biden, 82, leaves the presidency
after a single term.</p>
<p>But only about 600 people will see Trump sworn in live, with the
ceremony moved into the U.S. Capitol Rotunda at Trump’s behest. An
arrival Sunday night of an Arctic blast of frigid air into Washington
could push the temperature to -6 Celsius at noon on Monday, when the
traditional outdoor swearing-in ceremony would normally be held on the
steps of the Capitol overlooking the National Mall.</p>
<p>It is expected to be the coldest Inauguration Day in Washington in 40
years, when Ronald Reagan’s second inauguration was also moved inside in
1985.</p>
<p>About 250,000 tickets to Trump’s planned outdoor ceremony on the
Capitol steps had been handed out to his supporters and dignitaries but
inaugural officials said they now can simply keep the ducats as
commemorative souvenirs.</p>
<p>The traditional inaugural parade along Pennsylvania Avenue from the
Capitol to the White House has also been canceled because of the
weather, with bands, marching units, drill teams and the like now
parading past Trump, his wife, Melania Trump and other officials in his
new administration at the nearby 20,000-seat Capital One Arena, with
thousands of other celebrants literally left out in the cold. Lavish
black-tie balls are still planned for Monday evening.</p>
<p>Trump’s ascendancy to power again comes with some historical
footnotes: He will become the first felon to serve as U.S. president,
after his conviction last year on 34 criminal charges linked to
falsifying business records to hide a $130,000 hush money payment to
porn film star Stormy Daniels, although a judge declined to penalize him
in any way.</p>
<p>Charges that Trump, a Republican, tried to illegally overturn his
2020 election loss to Biden were dropped when he defeated his Democratic
opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, in the 2024 election because of
a long-standing Justice Department policy against prosecuting sitting
presidents.</p>
<p>Trump will also become the second U.S. president to serve a second
nonconsecutive term, after Grover Cleveland in the 1890s.</p>
<p>Beyond the pomp and circumstances of U.S. inaugurals, both Trump’s
supportive Republican colleagues and opposition Democrats will be
closely watching to see what policy changes he quickly announces with
executive orders to undo Biden edicts or simply to push forward with
planks from his winning campaign against Harris.</p>
<p>Trump’s Day 1 promises are wide-ranging, but whether he signs orders
affecting all of them or spreads out some of them to the coming days is
not certain.</p>
<p>Perhaps his most persistent claim from the campaign trail is that he
plans to deport more than 11 million undocumented migrants living in the
United States, starting with migrants who have been convicted of crimes
and then others who have been ordered to return to their home countries
after losing asylum bids to stay in the U.S.</p>
<p>But an apparent Trump plan to begin the immigration crackdown on
Tuesday in Chicago leaked to U.S. media outlets, leaving Trump’s
handpicked “border czar,” Tom Homan, to say that that the timing of the
deportation plan is now being reconsidered.</p>
<p>“We’re looking at this leak and will make a decision based on this
leak,” Homan told The Washington Post. “It’s unfortunate because anyone
leaking law enforcement operations puts officers at greater risk.”</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Homan said the Immigration and Customs Enforcement
agency “will start arresting public safety threats and national security
threats on day one. We’ll be arresting people across the country,
uninhibited by any prior (Biden) administration guidelines. Why Chicago
was mentioned specifically, I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“This is nationwide thing,” he said. “We’re not sweeping
neighborhoods. We have a targeted enforcement plan.”</p>
<p>Trump has also vowed to close the southwestern U.S. border with
Mexico and force would-be asylum-seekers to remain in Mexico while their
claims to stay in the U.S. are adjudicated.</p>
<p>All of his get-tough-on-migrant plans are sure to draw legal
challenges from advocates supporting those seeking a new life in the
U.S., possibly leaving Trump’s actions in limbo for extended periods,
weeks, maybe months.</p>
<p>Related to immigration, Trump says he wants to end birthright
citizenship for anyone born in the United States, although it is part of
the U.S. Constitution, so it is not clear how he plans to try to do that
unilaterally.</p>
<p>Trump has also vowed to quickly impose heightened tariffs on key
trading partners, including Canada, China and Mexico.</p>
<p>The incoming president says he plans to pardon many of the 1,500
supporters of his who stormed the Capitol building on Jan. 6, 2021, to
try to block Congress from certifying that Biden won the 2020 election.
Trump has called those arrested and convicted “patriots” and “hostages”
wrongly prosecuted.</p>
<p>It is not clear whether Trump will pardon only those convicted of
relatively minor offenses or include those convicted of attacking the
140 law enforcement officials who were injured in the mayhem four years
ago.</p>
<p>Trump vowed for months to end Russia’s war on Ukraine before he takes
office, but in recent days his aides have said the goal now is to try to
reach a truce in the fighting in the first 100 days of his
administration, which would be around the end of April.</p>
<p>Trump also wants more oil drilling in the U.S. even though in 2023,
U.S. energy production exceeded consumption by a record amount,
according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.</p>
<p>Two transgender issues have also drawn Trump’s attention.</p>
<p>Trump has repeatedly referred to transgender women as men, telling
his supporters that he will ensure transgender women cannot compete in
women’s sports.</p>
<p>“I will keep men out of women’s sports, 100%, immediately, first
day,” Trump told one political rally during the campaign. He also
frequently has assailed gender-affirming care, which can include hormone
therapy. “On day one, I will revoke Joe Biden’s cruel policies on
so-called ‘gender affirming care.’”</p>

<p>Boston — Tens of millions of residents along the East Coast are
bracing for several centimeters of snow Sunday followed by dangerously
cold temperatures that will take hold in much of the country from the
Northern Plains to the tip of Maine.</p>
<p>Winter storm warnings issued by the National Weather Service have
already gone into effect for parts of the Mid-Atlantic through Monday
morning, with the forecast projecting up to 15 centimeters of snow.
Warnings will begin in New England on Sunday afternoon, with parts of
Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Maine and Connecticut seeing as much as 25
centimeters of snow.</p>

College Park, Maryland, projected that as many as 70 million residents
will be under some kind of winter storm hazards warning in the coming
days including in New England and the Mid-Atlantic. Large cities like
Philadelphia, New York and Boston could see several centimeters of snow
this evening with the highest totals being outside of major cities.</p>
<p>“There will certainly be some more hazardous road conditions anywhere
from D.C. up the whole I-95 corridor and then inland from there later
today and tonight,” Chenard said. “Then it gets quite cold behind that.
By Monday morning, any roads that haven’t been treated or cleared will
still likely be some hazardous travel conditions.”</p>
<p>Return of the Arctic blast</p>
<p>But the snow is just the start of a chaotic week of weather.</p>
<p>Much of the eastern half of the United States will be enduring some
of the coldest temperatures this winter, if not for several years.</p>
<p>An area from the Rockies into the Northern Plains will see colder
than normal temperatures starting Sunday into the coming week, with
temperatures dropping to minus 34 degrees C to minus 48 C on Sunday and
Monday. Wind chills of minus 40 C were already being clocked in parts of
North Dakota and Minnesota. Sub-zero wind chills are forecast to reach
as far south as Oklahoma and the Tennessee Valley.</p>
<p>The cold weather forecast for Monday for Washington, D.C., prompted
President-elect Donald Trump’s inaugural ceremony to be moved inside the
U.S. Capitol Rotunda.</p>
<p>“It’s going to be a cold day in Washington, D.C. on Monday. That’s
for sure,” Chenard said, noting temperatures will be in the 20s with
wind gust upwards of 48 kph.</p>
<p>As happened earlier this month, this latest cold snap comes from a
disruption in the polar vortex, the ring of cold air usually trapped
about the North Pole.</p>
<p>The cold air will moderate as it moves southward and eastward, but
the central and eastern U.S. will still be cold with highs in the teens
and 20s on Monday into Tuesday, Chenard said. The Mid-Atlantic and
Northeast also will have highs in the teens and 20s, lows in the single
digits and below minus 18 C and wind chills below zero.</p>
<p>Unusual wintry mix</p>
<p>The colder temperatures will reach down into the South early this
week, where as many as 30 million people starting Monday could see a
wintry mix of snow, sleet and freezing rain. The unusual conditions are
expected to stretch from Texas into northern Florida and the Carolinas.
Impacts are expected to start in Texas on Monday night and spread across
the Gulf Coast and Southeast on Tuesday into Wednesday.</p>
<p>A combination of frigid air with a low pressure system over the Gulf
is behind the storm, which could bring heavy snow just south of the
Interstate 20 corridor across northern Louisiana and into Mississippi
and a mix of snow, sleet, and freezing rain near the Interstate 10
corridor from Houston to Mobile, Alabama.</p>
<p>Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry on Saturday issued a state of emergency in
advance of the wintry weather. He encouraged Louisianans to be prepared
and to monitor the weather forecast.</p>

<h2 id="implementing-gaza-ceasefire-will-be-up-to-trump">Implementing
Gaza ceasefire will be up to Trump</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WHITE HOUSE — A ceasefire in Gaza began Sunday after Israel’s Cabinet
approved a deal, with 24 ministers voting in favor and eight ministers
rejecting the agreement. The deal was scheduled to be implemented
beginning Sunday. But on Saturday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said it would not start unless Hamas provided a list of the
three hostages set for release Sunday.</p>
<p>Hamas ultimately provided the names and Israel said the ceasefire
would begin at 11:15 a.m.</p>
<p>The deal to end the fighting between Israel and Hamas was achieved
after more than a year of negotiations, with mediation from the United
States, Qatar and Egypt. U.S. President Joe Biden first endorsed the
deal in May. The warring parties agreed to it on Wednesday, and it was
subsequently approved by the Israeli Cabinet early Saturday in
Israel.</p>
<p>Starting midday on Monday when President-elect Donald Trump is
inaugurated, it will be up to his administration to see that the deal is
enforced.</p>
<p>The agreement has three phases, each of which will last six weeks.
The terms of phases two and three are still being negotiated, but under
phase one the cessation of hostilities is expected to continue if six
weeks pass before the next phase is finalized.</p>
<p>Phase one includes withdrawal of Israeli forces from densely
populated areas and more aid for Gaza, as well as the release of some
Palestinians detained in Israeli prisons and some hostages held by
Hamas, including Americans. The U.S. and other Western countries have
designated Hamas as a terrorist group.</p>
<p>The release of American hostages is a “fundamental component” of
Trump’s interest in ending the war swiftly, according to Ahmed Fouad
Alkhatib, resident senior fellow with the Scowcroft Middle East Security
Initiative at the Atlantic Council’s Middle East Programs.</p>
<p>Whether Trump will sustain pressure for the deal to proceed to phase
two, when all of the hostages are set to be released, and to phase
three, when reconstruction of Gaza will begin, remains to be seen,
Alkhatib told VOA.</p>
<p>Alkhatib expressed concern that after the first phase Trump will be
“so disinterested” in Gaza that the agreement will amount to “little
more than a freezing of the conflict.” This would be disastrous for
Palestinians in Gaza and the goal of Palestinian statehood, he
added.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said late Friday that he
had received “unequivocal guarantees” from Biden and Trump that if
negotiations on phase two fail, Israel “will return to intense fighting
with the backing of the United States.”</p>
<p>Hamas militants killed about 1,200 people and captured about 250
hostages in their Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel that sparked the
current war. Israel says Hamas is still holding 101 hostages, including
35 the military says are dead.</p>
<p>Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 46,000
Palestinians, according to the territory’s Health Ministry, which does
not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count.</p>
<p>Two-state solution</p>
<p>The Biden administration’s goal has been Palestinian statehood under
the two-state solution. This could pave the way to bringing Saudi Arabia
into the Abraham Accords — the 2020 deal brokered under the first Trump
administration that normalized diplomatic relations between Israel and
its Arab neighbors, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain.</p>
<p>Biden had sought to expand the accords to include Saudi Arabia, which
maintains it will not consider normalizing relations until Israel
commits to a “credible path” to a Palestinian state. Washington and
Riyadh had been exploring the expansion through a package that would
include, among other offers, American security guarantees for the
Saudis. Those efforts stalled after the Oct. 7 Hamas onslaught.</p>
<p>Now Trump appears to be aiming to use the momentum of the Gaza
ceasefire to add Saudi Arabia into the accords.</p>
<p>“We will continue promoting PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH throughout the
region, as we build upon the momentum of this ceasefire to further
expand the Historic Abraham Accords,” Trump posted on social media
Wednesday following the announcement that a ceasefire deal has been
reached.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia has never formally recognized Israel since its creation
in 1948. As a de facto leader of the Arab and Islamic world, Riyadh’s
recognition would represent a breakthrough for the Jewish state.</p>
<p>Trump’s main objective now is to ensure that whatever happens in Gaza
does not prevent him from securing that deal, while Israel’s goal is to
ensure whatever happens in Gaza doesn’t prevent cooperation with the
U.S. over Iran, said Jonathan Rynhold, head of the department of
political studies at Bar Ilan University.</p>
<p>“So, I’m not sure that it makes sense to think beyond the first phase
at this point,” Rynhold told VOA.</p>
<p>Trump and Israel will “work out their positions on Gaza precisely
against the shadow of those two things,” he added.</p>
<p>Trump’s role in securing the deal</p>
<p>In the same social media post Wednesday, Trump took credit for his
role in securing the ceasefire.</p>
<p>“This EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result
of our Historic Victory in November, as it signaled to the entire World
that my Administration would seek Peace and negotiate deals to ensure
the safety of all Americans, and our Allies,” Trump wrote.</p>
<p>For months the Biden administration has progressively included
Trump’s team in peace talks, beginning with an Oval Office meeting a
week after Trump won the election. At that Nov. 13 meeting, Biden
proposed that they work together to push the deal through.</p>
<p>“We’ve sent a signal to the incoming team that we’re prepared to work
with them on this issue,” national security adviser Jake Sullivan told
reporters that day.</p>
<p>Shortly after, Sullivan and Biden’s top Middle East adviser, Brett
McGurk, began coordinating with their successors on the Trump team, Mike
Waltz and Steve Witkoff, said a senior administration official who spoke
with reporters on background Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Biden official said that in the final days leading up to the
ceasefire, Witkoff worked in tandem with McGurk in an “almost
unprecedented,” cross-administration partnership that was “highly
constructive, very fruitful.” But he declined to elaborate on Witkoff’s
and Trump’s role in securing the deal, other than saying that the
presidential transition provided a “natural” deadline for a diplomatic
breakthrough.</p>
<p>Pressure on Israel</p>
<p>Critics have accused Biden of failing to use U.S. military support as
leverage over Netanyahu to reach a deal or moderate Israel’s campaign,
which has taken tens of thousands of Palestinian lives.</p>
<p>Publicly, Biden officials have largely echoed Israel in faulting
Hamas for the failure of the talks. But some Israeli security officials
and many observers also blame Netanyahu for blocking progress, including
by repeatedly introducing fresh demands in negotiations.</p>
<p>With Trump’s victory, Netanyahu’s calculations may have changed, said
Laura Blumenfeld, senior fellow at the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced
International Studies.</p>
<p>“Trump injected a kind of fear factor into this process that was
missing before,” she told VOA. “He can’t triangulate anymore the way he
would play Biden off of the Republican Congress. There’s nowhere for
Netanyahu to run, nowhere to hide, and so he took this deal he couldn’t
refuse.”</p>
<p>Trump’s pressure may have also created space for Netanyahu to resist
ultimatums from far-right allies who had threatened to leave his
governing coalition if a ceasefire deal is made, which would mean an end
to the prime minister’s term.</p>
<p>Eight Israeli far-right politicians, including National Security
Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, rejected
the deal, but it is still unclear whether they will leave the
coalition.</p>
<p>“Netanyahu finally called their bluff,” Blumenfeld said. “Or maybe
actually, Trump called Netanyahu’s bluff, because he was using these
right-wing Cabinet members all along as an excuse not to make the
concessions that he didn’t want to make.”</p>

id="biden-posthumously-pardons-black-nationalist-marcus-garvey">Biden
posthumously pardons Black nationalist Marcus Garvey</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — President Joe Biden on Sunday posthumously pardoned
Black nationalist Marcus Garvey, who influenced Malcolm X and other
civil rights leaders and was convicted of mail fraud in the 1920s. Also
receiving pardons were a top Virginia lawmaker and advocates for
immigrant rights, criminal justice reform and gun violence
prevention. </p>
<p>Congressional leaders had pushed for Biden to pardon Garvey, with
supporters arguing that Garvey’s conviction was politically motivated
and an effort to silence the increasingly popular leader who spoke of
racial pride. After Garvey was convicted, he was deported to Jamaica,
where he was born. He died in 1940. </p>
<p>The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. said of Garvey: “He was the first
man, on a mass scale and level” to give millions of Black people “a
sense of dignity and destiny.” </p>
<p>It’s not clear whether Biden, who leaves office Monday, will pardon
people who have been criticized or threatened by President-elect Donald
Trump. </p>
<p>Issuing preemptive pardons — for actual or imagined offenses by
Trump’s critics that could be investigated or prosecuted by the incoming
administration — would stretch the powers of the presidency in untested
ways. </p>
<p>Biden has set the presidential record for most individual pardons and
commutations issued. He announced on Friday that he was commuting the
sentences of almost 2,500 people convicted of nonviolent drug offenses.
He also gave a broad pardon for his son Hunter, who was prosecuted for
gun and tax crimes. </p>
<p>The president has announced he was commuting the sentences of 37 of
the 40 people on federal death row, converting their punishments to life
imprisonment just as Trump, an outspoken proponent of expanding capital
punishment, takes office. In his first term, Trump presided over an
unprecedented number of executions, 13, in a protracted timeline during
the coronavirus pandemic. </p>
<p>A pardon relieves a person of guilt and punishment. A commutation
reduces or eliminates the punishment but doesn’t exonerate the
wrongdoing. </p>
<p>Among those pardoned on Sunday were: </p>
<p>— Don Scott, who is the speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates in
a chamber narrowly controlled by Democrats. He was convicted of a drug
offense in 1994 and served eight years in prison. He was elected to the
Virginia legislature in 2019, and later became the first Black
speaker. </p>
<p>“I am deeply humbled to share that I have received a Presidential
Pardon from President Joe Biden for a mistake I made in 1994 — one that
changed the course of my life and taught me the true power of
redemption,” Scott said in a statement. </p>
<p>—Immigrant rights activist Ravi Ragbir, who was convicted of a
nonviolent offence in 2001 and was sentenced to two years in prison and
was facing deportation to Trinidad and Tobago. </p>
<p>—Kemba Smith Pradia, who was convicted of a drug offense in 1994 and
sentenced to 24 years behind bars. She has since become a prison reform
activist. President Bill Clinton commuted her sentence in 2000. </p>
<p>—Darryl Chambers of Wilmington, Delaware, a gun violence prevention
advocate who was convicted of a drug offense and sentenced to 17 years
in prison. He studies and writes about gun violence prevention. </p>
<p>Biden commuted the sentences of two people: </p>
<p>—Michelle West, who was serving life in prison for her role in a drug
conspiracy case in the early 1990s. West has a daughter who has written
publicly about the struggle of growing up with a mother behind
bars. </p>
<p>—Robin Peoples, who was convicted of robbing banks in northwest
Indiana in the late 1990s and was sentenced to 111 years in prison. The
White House said in a statement that Peoples would have faced
significantly lower sentences today under current laws.</p>

Treasury Department imposes sanctions on Chinese company over Salt
Typhoon hack</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Treasury Department on Friday imposed sanctions
on alleged hacker Yin Kecheng and cybersecurity company Sichuan Juxinhe
Network Technology Co., accusing both of being involved in a series of
hacks against American telecom companies.</p>
<p>The intrusions, known under the name Salt Typhoon, have allegedly
exposed a huge swath of Americans’ call logs to Chinese spies and
rattled the U.S. intelligence community. In some cases, hackers are
alleged to have intercepted conversations, including between prominent
U.S. politicians and government officials. Some lawmakers have described
them as the worst telecom hacks in U.S. history.</p>
<p>In a statement, the Treasury described Sichuan Juxinhe Network
Technology Co. as a hacking company with strong ties to China’s Ministry
of State Security, an intelligence agency. It said that Yin Kecheng was
based in Shanghai, had worked as a hacker for more than a decade, and
also had ties to the MSS. It further alleged he was tied to the recent
breach at the U.S. Treasury.</p>
<p>Reuters was not immediately able to reach Yin Kecheng or Sichuan
Juxinhe. China’s embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a
request for comment.</p>
<p>Beijing routinely denies responsibility for cyberespionage
campaigns.</p>

id="new-documentary-questions-who-took-famous-napalm-attack-photo">New
documentary questions who took famous napalm attack photo</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>It is one of the 20th century’s most memorable images: a naked girl,
screaming, running from a napalm bombing during the Vietnam War. More
than a half-century later, a new documentary is calling into question
who took it — and the retired Associated Press photographer long
credited for the photo insists it was his, while his longtime employer
says it has no evidence of anyone else being behind the camera. </p>
<p>The film about the Pulitzer Prize-winning picture, “The Stringer,” is
scheduled to debut next week at the Sundance Film Festival. Both
photographer Nick Ut and his longtime employer are contesting it
vigorously, and Ut’s lawyer is seeking to block the premiere,
threatening a defamation lawsuit. The AP, which conducted its own
investigation over six months, concluded it has “no reason to believe
anyone other than Ut took the photo.” </p>
<p>The picture of Kim Phuc running down a road in the village of Trang
Bang, crying and naked because she had taken off clothes burning from
napalm, instantly became symbolic of the horrors of the Vietnam
War. </p>
<p>Taken on June 8, 1972, the photo is credited to Ut, then a
21-year-old staffer in AP’s Saigon bureau. He was awarded the Pulitzer a
year later. Now 73, he moved to California after the war and worked for
the AP for 40 years until retiring in 2017. </p>
<p>The film’s allegations open an unexpected new chapter for an image
that, within hours of it being taken, was beamed around the planet and
became one of the most indelible photographs of both the Vietnam War and
the turbulent century that produced it. Whatever the truth, the film’s
investigations apparently relate only to the identity of the
photographer and not the image’s overall authenticity. </p>
<p>The dispute puts the filmmakers, who call the episode “a scandal
behind the making of one of the most-recognized photographs of the 20th
century,” at odds with Ut, whose work that day defined his career. It
also puts them at cross purposes with the AP, a global news organization
for whom accuracy is a foundational part of the business model. </p>
<p>How did the questioning of the photo begin? </p>
<p>It’s difficult, so many years later, to overestimate the wallop that
this particular image packed. Ron Burnett, an expert on images and
former president of the Emily Carr University of Art and Design, called
it “earth-shattering.” </p>
<p>“It changed the way photos have always been thought about and broke
the rules for how much violence you can show to the public,” Burnett
said. </p>
<p>The photo sat unchallenged for much of its 53-year existence. All
these years later, a counter-narrative has emerged that it was instead
taken by another person, someone who worked for NBC News at the time and
also lives now in California. The person allegedly had delivered his
film to the AP’s office as a “stringer,” a non-staff member who provides
material to a news organization. </p>
<p>The husband-and-wife team of Gary Knight, founder of the VII
Foundation, and producer Fiona Turner are behind the film. On his
website, Knight described “The Stringer” as “a story that many in our
profession did not want told, and some of them continue to go to great
lengths to make sure isn’t told.” </p>
<p>“The film grapples with questions of authorship, racial injustice and
journalistic ethics while shining a light on the fundamental yet often
unrecognized contributions of local freelancers who provide the
information we need to understand how events worldwide impact us all,”
Knight wrote. </p>
<p>Knight did not return a message seeking comment from the AP on
Thursday. A representative from Sundance also did not return a message
about a cease-and-desist letter from Ut’s lawyer, James Hornstein,
trying to stop the film’s airing. Hornstein would not make Ut available
for an interview, saying he anticipated future litigation. </p>
<p>Knight and Turner met with AP in London last June about the
allegations. According to the AP, filmmakers requested the news
organization sign a non-disclosure agreement before they provided their
evidence. AP declined. </p>
<p>That hampered the AP’s own investigation, along with the passage of
time. Horst Faas, chief of photos for AP in Saigon in 1972, and Yuichi
“Jackson” Ishizaki, who developed Ut’s film, are both dead. Many of the
Saigon bureau’s records were lost when communists took over the city,
including any dealings with “the stringer.” Negatives of photos used
back then are preserved in AP’s corporate archives in New York, but they
provided no insight for the investigation. </p>
<p>Still, the AP decided to release its own findings before seeing “The
Stringer” and the details of the claim that it is making. “AP stands
prepared to review any evidence and take whatever remedial action might
be needed if their thesis is proved true,” the news organization
said. </p>
<p>Some who were there are sure about what happened </p>
<p>The AP said it spoke to seven surviving people who were in Trang Bang
or AP’s Saigon bureau that day, and all maintain they have no reason to
doubt their own conclusions that Ut had taken the photo. </p>
<p>One was Fox Butterfield, a renowned longtime New York Times reporter,
who also said that he was contacted by Turner for the documentary. “I
told them what my memory was and they didn’t like it, but they just went
ahead anyway,” Butterfield told AP. </p>
<p>Another was photographer David Burnett, who said he witnessed Ut and
Alexander Shimkin, a freelance photographer working primarily for
Newsweek, taking photos as Kim Phuc and other children emerged from
smoke following an attack. Shimkin was killed in Vietnam a month later,
according to the investigation. </p>
<p>A key source for the story in “The Stringer” is Carl Robinson, then a
photo editor for the AP in Saigon, who was initially overruled in his
judgment not to use the picture. AP reached out to Robinson as part of
its probe, but he said he had signed an NDA with Knight and the VII
Foundation. Knight followed up, saying Robinson would only speak off the
record, which the AP concluded would have prevented the news
organization from setting the record straight. </p>
<p>Robinson did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment on
Thursday. </p>
<p>On duty that day in Saigon, Robinson had concluded that Ut’s picture
could not be used because it would have violated standards prohibiting
nudity. But Faas overruled him, and senior AP editors in New York
decided to run the picture for what it conveyed about war. </p>
<p>The AP questioned Robinson’s long silence in contradicting Ut’s photo
credit, and showed a photo from its archives of Robinson with champagne
toasting Ut’s Pulitzer Prize. In a 2005 interview with corporate
archives, Robinson said he thought AP “created a monster” when it
distributed the photo because much of the world’s sympathies were
focused on one victim, instead of war victims more broadly. </p>
<p>Former AP correspondent Peter Arnett, who believes Ut made the image,
said Robinson wrote to him after Faas’ death in 2012 to make the
allegation that Ut had not taken it; he said he did not want to do it
while Faas was still alive. According to the AP investigation, Arnett
said Robinson told him that Ut had “gone all Hollywood” and he didn’t
like it. </p>
<p>Hornstein characterized Robinson, who was dismissed by AP in 1978, as
“a guy with a 50-year vendetta against the AP.” He also questioned the
long silence by the man supposedly identified in the documentary as the
person who really took the photo. </p>
<p>The lawyer also produced a statement from Kim Phuc, who said that
while she has no memory of that day, her uncle has repeatedly told her
that Ut took the picture and that she had no reason to doubt him. Ut
also took her to the nearest hospital after the photo was taken, she
wrote.</p>

<h2 id="banning-cellphones-in-schools-gains-popularity-in-us">Banning
cellphones in schools gains popularity in US</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>little rock, arkansas — Arkansas’ Republican Governor Sarah Huckabee
Sanders and California’s Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom have little in
common ideologically, but the two have both been vocal supporters of an
idea that’s been rapidly gaining bipartisan ground in the states:
Students’ use of cellphones needs to be banned during the school
day. </p>
<p>At least eight states have enacted such bans over the past two years,
and proposals are being considered in several more states this
year. </p>
<p>Here is a look at the push by states for such bans. </p>
<p>Why are states banning cellphones at schools? </p>
<p>The push for cellphone bans has been driven by concerns about the
impact screen time has on children’s mental health and complaints from
teachers that cellphones have become a constant distraction in the
classroom. </p>
<p>Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy, who has called on Congress to
require warning labels on social media platforms about their effects on
young people’s lives, has said schools need to provide phone-free
times. </p>
<p>Nationally, 77% of U.S. schools say they prohibit cellphones at
school for non-academic use, according to the National Center for
Education Statistics. But that number is misleading. It does not mean
students are following those bans or all those schools are enforcing
them. </p>
<p>Kim Whitman, co-founder of the Phone Free Schools Movement, said the
issue is catching on because parents and teachers in both red and blue
states are struggling with the consequences of kids on mobile
devices. </p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter if you live in a big city or a rural town, urban
or suburban, all children are struggling and need that seven-hour break
from the pressures of phones and social media during the school day,”
she said. </p>
<p>What states are enacting bans? </p>
<p>At least eight states — California, Florida, Indiana, Louisiana,
Minnesota, Ohio, South Carolina and Virginia — have enacted measures
banning or restricting students’ use of cellphones in schools. </p>
<p>The policies range widely. Florida was the first state to crack down
on phones in school, passing a 2023 law that requires all public schools
to ban cellphone use during class time and block access to social media
on district Wi-Fi. </p>
<p>A 2024 California law requires the state’s nearly 1,000 school
districts to create their own cellphone policies by July 2026. </p>
<p>Several other states haven’t banned phones, but have encouraged
school districts to enact such restrictions or have provided funding to
store phones during the day. </p>
<p>Sanders announced a pilot program last year providing grants to
schools that adopt phone-free policies, and more than 100 school
districts signed on. Sanders said she now wants to require all districts
to ban cellphones during the school day, but the proposal will leave it
to the districts on how to craft the policy. </p>
<p>“Teachers know [cellphones are] a huge distraction, but much bigger
than that is that it is impacting the mental health of so many of our
students,” Sanders told reporters on Thursday. </p>
<p>Other governors recently calling for bans include Kelly Ayotte of New
Hampshire, who was sworn in this month, Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds and
Nebraska Governor Jim Pillen. New York Governor Kathy Hochul has
suggested she’ll seek a statewide policy, but has not offered
specifics. </p>
<p>What is the opposition to the bans? </p>
<p>The cellphone bans have faced opposition from some parents who say
they need to be able to contact their children directly in case of
emergency. </p>
<p>Some parents have pointed to recent school shootings where having
access to cellphones was the only way some students were able to
communicate with loved ones for what they thought might be the last
time. </p>
<p>But supporters of the bans have noted that students’ phones could
pose additional dangers during an emergency by distracting students or
by revealing their location during an active-shooter situation. </p>
<p>Parents opposed to the ban have also said they want their children to
have access to their phones for other needs, such as coordinating
transportation. </p>
<p>Keri Rodrigues, president of the National Parents Union, said she
agrees about the dangers of social media for children but that the bans
sought by states are too broad. Banning the devices during the school
day is not going to solve underlying issues like bullying or the dangers
of social media, she said. </p>
<p>“We have not done our job as grown-ups to try to teach our kids the
skills they need to actually navigate this technology,” she said. “We’ve
just kicked the can down the road and thrown them into the deep end of
the pool when they’re by themselves after school.”</p>

<h2 id="tiktok-goes-dark-for-us-users-company-pins-hope-on-trump">TikTok
goes dark for US users; company pins hope on Trump</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — TikTok stopped working in the United States late on
Saturday and disappeared from Apple and Google app stores ahead of a law
that takes effect Sunday requiring the shutdown of the app used by 170
million Americans.</p>
<p>President-elect Donald Trump said earlier in the day he would “most
likely” give TikTok a 90-day reprieve from the ban after he takes office
on Monday, a promise TikTok cited in a notice posted to users on the
app.</p>
<p>TikTok, which is owned by China’s ByteDance, told users attempting to
use the app around 10:45 p.m. ET (0345 GMT): “A law banning TikTok has
been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can’t use TikTok
for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he
will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes
office. Please stay tuned.”</p>
<p>Other apps owned by ByteDance, including video editing app Capcut and
lifestyle social app Lemon8, were also offline and unavailable in U.S.
app stores as of late Saturday.</p>
<p>“The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done,
because it’s appropriate,” Trump told NBC. “If I decide to do that, I’ll
probably announce it on Monday.”</p>
<p>It was not clear if any U.S. users could still access the app, but it
was no longer working for many users and people seeking to access it
through a web application were met with the same message that TikTok was
no longer working.</p>
<p>TikTok, which has captivated nearly half of all Americans, powered
small businesses and shaped online culture, warned on Friday it would go
dark in the U.S. on Sunday unless President Joe Biden’s administration
provides assurances to companies such as Apple and Google that they will
not face enforcement actions when a ban takes effect.</p>
<p>Under a law passed last year and upheld on Friday by a unanimous
Supreme Court, the platform has until Sunday to cut ties with its
China-based parent or shut down its U.S. operation to resolve concerns
it poses a threat to national security.</p>
<p>The White House reiterated on Saturday that it was up to the incoming
administration to take action.</p>
<p>“We see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in
the next few days before the Trump administration takes office on
Monday,” press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.</p>
<p>TikTok did not respond to a request for comment on the new White
House statement.</p>
<p>The Chinese Embassy in Washington on Friday accused the U.S. of using
unfair state power to suppress TikTok. “China will take all necessary
measures to resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,” a
spokesperson said.  </p>
<p>Users move to alternatives</p>
<p>Uncertainty over the app’s future had sent users – mostly younger
people – scrambling to alternatives including China-based RedNote.
Rivals Meta and Snap had also seen their share prices rise this month
ahead of the ban, as investors bet on an influx of users and advertising
dollars.</p>
<p>“This is my new home now,” wrote one user in a RedNote post, tagged
with the words “tiktokrefugee” and “sad.”</p>
<p>Minutes after TikTok’s U.S. shutdown, other users took to X, formerly
called Twitter.</p>
<p>“I didn’t really think that they would cut off TikTok. Now I’m sad
and I miss the friends I made there. Hoping it all comes back in just a
few days,” wrote <span class="citation"
data-cites="RavenclawJedi">@RavenclawJedi</span>.</p>
<p>NordVPN, a popular virtual private network, or VPN, allowing users to
access the internet from servers around the world, said it was
“experiencing temporary technical difficulties.”</p>
<p>Web searches for “VPN” spiked in the minutes after U.S. users lost
access to TikTok, according to Google Trends.</p>
<p>Users on Instagram fretted about whether they would still receive
merchandise they had bought on TikTok Shop, the video platform’s
e-commerce arm.</p>
<p>Marketing firms reliant on TikTok have rushed to prepare contingency
plans this week in what one executive described as a “hair on fire”
moment after months of conventional wisdom saying that a solution would
materialize to keep the app running.</p>
<p>There have been signs TikTok could make a comeback under Trump, who
has said he wants to pursue a “political resolution” of the issue and
last month urged the Supreme Court to pause implementation of the
ban.</p>
<p>TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew plans to attend the U.S. presidential
inauguration and attend a rally with Trump on Sunday, a source told
Reuters.</p>
<p>Suitors including former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt have
expressed interest in the fast-growing business that analysts estimate
could be worth as much as $50 billion. Media reports say Beijing has
also held talks about selling TikTok’s U.S. operations to billionaire
and Trump ally Elon Musk, though the company has denied that.</p>
<p>U.S. search engine startup Perplexity AI submitted a bid on Saturday
to ByteDance for Perplexity to merge with TikTok U.S., a source familiar
with the company’s plans told Reuters. Perplexity would merge with
TikTok U.S. and create a new entity by combining the merged company with
other partners, the person added.</p>
<p>Privately held ByteDance is about 60% owned by institutional
investors such as BlackRock and General Atlantic, while its founders and
employees own 20% each. It has more than 7,000 employees in the U.S.</p>

id="as-trump-returns-to-white-house-his-family-circle-looks-different">As
Trump returns to White House, his family circle looks different</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>When Donald Trump returns to the White House on Monday, his family
circle will look a little different than it did when he first arrived
eight years ago.</p>
<p>His youngest son, Barron, was in fifth grade back then. He’s now a
college freshman who towers over his 1.8-meter-plus dad. Granddaughter
Kai, who was 9 in 2017, is now an aspiring social media influencer and
impressive golfer. Grandson Joseph, who posed in Trump’s lap with a Lego
model of the White House last time, is 11 now.</p>
<p>After working in his first administration, the most prominent
relatives in Trump’s political sphere, daughter Ivanka and her husband,
Jared, are now in Florida.</p>
<p>Family members can provide presidents with a ready source of moral
and sounding-board support, companionship and even relief from the
world’s problems.</p>
<p>The president-elect has five children — three of whom are married —
from his marriages to Ivana Trump, Marla Maples and current wife Melania
Trump. He has 10 grandchildren, with an 11th on the way.</p>
<p>A look at Trump’s family circle, then and now:</p>
<p>Melania Trump, Trump’s wife</p>
<p>THEN: She spent the opening months of Trump’s term at the family’s
Manhattan penthouse so that 11-year-old Barron wouldn’t have to switch
schools in the middle of the year. After moving to the White House, she
traveled around the United States and to other countries, alone and with
Trump, partly to promote her “Be Best” children’s initiative while
fiercely guarding her privacy.</p>
<p>NOW: She avoided active campaigning during Trump’s 2024 run, limiting
her public appearances to key moments, such as the campaign’s launch,
the Republican National Convention and election night. She released a
self-titled memoir late last year and will be the subject of a
documentary distributed by Amazon Prime Video that is expected to be
released this year. While some doubt that Trump’s 54-year-old wife will
spend much time at the White House, she said on Fox News’ Fox &amp;
Friends that she has already packed and picked out the furniture she
wants to take to the executive mansion.</p>
<p>Donald Trump Jr., Trump’s eldest son</p>
<p>THEN: Trump’s eldest son, now 46, campaigned for his father in 2016
and 2020.</p>
<p>NOW: Trump Jr.’s influence has grown to the point that he lobbied his
father to choose close friend JD Vance for vice president. He also
pushed for former Democratic Representative Tulsi Gabbard and Robert F.
Kennedy Jr., the president-elect’s picks for director of national
intelligence and health and human services, respectively. Trump
Jr. helps run the family real estate business and is an honorary
chairman of Trump’s transition. He has a podcast and has said his role
is to prevent “bad actors” from getting into the administration. He
recently flew on his father’s airplane to Greenland; the president-elect
has expressed a desire to take control of the mineral-rich Danish
territory.</p>
<p>Trump Jr. has five children — or “smurfs,” as he sometimes refers to
them — with his former wife, Vanessa Trump. They are Kai Madison, 17;
Donald John III, 15; Tristan Milos, 13; Spencer Frederick, 12; and Chloe
Sophia Trump, 10.</p>
<p>Ivanka Trump, Trump’s eldest daughter</p>
<p>THEN: Ivanka, 43, campaigned for her father in 2016 and moved her
family from New York City to Washington to work in his White House as a
senior adviser. She was on the campaign trail in 2020, too, but she and
her family moved to Florida and retreated from the spotlight after his
loss.</p>
<p>NOW: As Trump geared up for the 2024 run, Ivanka announced that she
loved and supported him but was getting out of politics to focus on her
husband and their three kids. She did, however, join her father and
other family members on election night and when he rang the bell at the
New York Stock Exchange in early December after Time magazine named him
Person of the Year.</p>
<p>Ivanka and her husband have three children: Arabella Rose, 13; Joseph
Frederick, 11; and Theodore James Kushner, 8.</p>
<p>Eric Trump, Trump’s second son</p>
<p>THEN: The 40-year-old helped run the family business and participated
in his father’s campaigns.</p>
<p>NOW: Eric is also an honorary chair of the transition and a close
adviser to his father. But he continues to focus more on running the
family business. In September, he and his brother started a crypto
platform called World Liberty Financial, and their father helped launch
it in an interview on the X social media platform.</p>
<p>Eric and his wife, Lara, have two children: Eric Luke, 7, and
Carolina Dorothy Trump, 5.</p>
<p>Tiffany Trump, Trump’s youngest daughter</p>
<p>THEN: Trump’s daughter with second wife Marla Maples was 23 and a
recent University of Pennsylvania graduate who kept a low profile when
Trump was first elected.</p>
<p>NOW: She was more present in the 2024 campaign but still largely
avoids the spotlight. Tiffany, 31, and her husband, Michael Boulos, are
expecting their first child this year. Boulos is a businessman who
traveled with Trump in the final stretch of the campaign. His father is
Massad Boulos, a Lebanese American businessman who helped Trump with the
influential Arab American community in the swing state of Michigan.
Trump has named Massad Boulos to be a senior adviser on Arab and Middle
Eastern affairs.</p>
<p>Barron Trump, Trump’s youngest son</p>
<p>THEN: At the start of Trump’s first term, Barron and his mother
stayed at the family’s Trump Tower penthouse in Manhattan so he could
finish his school year. When they got to Washington, his soccer net
appeared in what’s known as the first lady’s garden.</p>
<p>NOW: Barron, 18, is a freshman New York University business student.
His parents and Trump campaign officials credit him for recommending
podcasts popular with young men that the president-elect appeared on
during the campaign. Barron will have a bedroom in the White House,
Melania Trump said on Fox &amp; Friends.</p>
<p>“I’m very proud of him, about his knowledge, even about politics and
giving an advice to his father,” his mother said on the program. “He
brought in so many young people. He knows his generation.”</p>
<p>Lara Trump, Trump’s daughter-in-law</p>
<p>THEN: Trump’s daughter-in-law, 42, campaigned for him during all his
runs. After Trump lost to Democrat Joe Biden in 2020, she considered
running for a U.S. Senate seat from her home state of North Carolina but
ultimately decided against it. She became a Fox News commentator.</p>
<p>NOW: As Trump revved up his 2024 campaign, he installed his
daughter-in-law as co-chair of the Republican National Committee, where
she was a TV-ready advocate overseeing fundraising, voter outreach and
the party’s “election integrity” initiative. She stepped down from the
RNC after the election and removed her name from consideration as a
possible successor to Florida Senator Marco Rubio, Trump’s choice for
secretary of state.</p>
<p>Lara Trump is passionate about fitness and has her own line of
activewear.</p>
<p>Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law</p>
<p>THEN: Kushner, 44, was also a key figure in Trump’s 2016 campaign. He
joined his wife in the White House as a senior adviser, a role that
included working on U.S. policy toward Israel and the broader Middle
East.</p>
<p>NOW: Kushner has stepped out of the political spotlight — but his
father could soon step in. Trump announced after the election that he
intends to nominate Charles Kushner, a real estate developer, to be U.S.
ambassador to France. The elder Kushner was pardoned by Trump in
December 2020 after he pleaded guilty years earlier to tax evasion and
making illegal campaign contributions.</p>
<p>Kai Trump, one of Trump’s granddaughters</p>
<p>THEN: Kai was in elementary school when her grandfather became
president.</p>
<p>NOW: Donald Trump Jr.’s 17-year-old granddaughter is an aspiring
social media influencer. Her behind-the-scenes video from election night
garnered 3.7 million views on YouTube. Other posts related to her
grandfather have been watched millions more times on TikTok. Kai
delivered her first public speech at the Republican convention and is an
avid golfer who sometimes plays with her grandfather.</p>
<p>Arabella Kushner, one of Trump’s granddaughters</p>
<p>THEN: Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner’s daughter was 6 when her
grandfather showed China’s Xi Jinping a video of her, in a traditional
Chinese dress, belting out Chinese-language songs.</p>
<p>“It’s very good, right? She’s very smart,” Trump said. Xi responded
that Arabella was her grandfather’s “little angel” and a “messenger of
China-U.S. relations.”</p>
<p>NOW: Arabella is 13 and enjoys singing, playing the piano, horseback
riding and Brazilian jiu-jitsu, according to a social media post from
her mother.</p>

id="rubio-vows-to-oppose-thai-uyghur-deportations-as-us-secretary-of-state">Rubio
vows to oppose Thai Uyghur deportations as US secretary of state</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, President-elect Donald Trump’s
pick for secretary of state, is pledging to press Thailand to prevent
the deportation of 48 Uyghurs held there since 2014 after fleeing
alleged persecution in Xinjiang, in northwest China.   </p>
<p>“Thailand is a very strong U.S. partner, a strong historical ally,”
Rubio said during his Senate confirmation hearing Wednesday. “That is an
area where I think diplomacy could really achieve results because of how
important that relationship is and how close it is.”  </p>
<p>Describing the Uyghurs’ plight in China as “one of the most
horrifying things that has ever happened,” he said, “These are people
who are basically being rounded up because of their ethnicity and
religion, and they are being put into camps … stripped of their
identity… and into forced labor — literally, slave labor.”  </p>
<p>Human rights advocates say returning the Uyghurs to China risks
torture, long imprisonment, or disappearance.  </p>
<p>Rubio, a leading critic of Beijing, co-sponsored the 2021 Uyghur
Forced Labor Prevention Act, which bans imports from Xinjiang unless
free of forced labor. His stance for human rights in China has subjected
him to Chinese sanctions since 2020.  </p>
<p>China refutes accusations of genocide</p>
<p>Both the Biden and previous Trump administrations have classified
China’s actions in Xinjiang as genocide, while a 2022 United Nations
report said Beijing’s policies may constitute crimes against humanity.
China rejects these accusations, framing its actions as anti-terrorism
measures.  </p>
<p>The Chinese Embassy in Bangkok claimed on Wednesday that Uyghur
detainees in Thailand had terrorist ties.  </p>
<p>“A small number of individuals, enticed by external forces, fled
abroad and even joined the ‘East Turkestan Islamic Movement,’ [ETIM] a
terrorist organization recognized by the United Nations, becoming
terrorists themselves,” the embassy stated. </p>
<p>Although ETIM was listed as a terror group in 2002, the U.S. delisted
it in 2020, citing no “clear and convincing evidence of ETIM’s
existence,” according to Congressional Research Service. </p>
<p>Julie Millsap, government relations manager at the Washington-based
group No Business With Genocide, dismissed China’s claims.  </p>
<p>There has been “no evidence presented to link these men to
terrorism,” Millsap told VOA. “The PRC cannot claim concurrently that it
has a population of happy, dancing Uyghurs while labeling asylum seekers
as extremists.”  </p>
<p>Arslan Hidayat, team lead of the Save Uyghur campaign by U.S.-based
Justice for All, said Uyghur detainees in Thailand recently faced a
troubling development. </p>
<p>“Last week, I learned from the detainees that Thai immigration
officers attempted to photograph 43 Uyghur detainees and have them sign
documents similar to those used in 2015, when more than 100 Uyghurs were
forcibly repatriated to China,” Hidayat told VOA Friday. </p>
<p>“Fearing a repeat of that mass deportation, the detainees refused and
launched a hunger strike, which continues to this day,” he said. </p>
<p>‘Degrading treatment or even torture’</p>
<p>In addition to the 43 Uyghurs in Thailand’s IDC, five are imprisoned
after a failed escape attempt. A U.N. report cited “degrading treatment
or even torture” and five deaths, including two children, urging Thai
authorities against deportation without due process and individual
protection assessments. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Human Rights Watch on Friday urged Thailand to release detained
Uyghurs and grant them safe passage to a third country.</p>
<p>“Successive Thai governments have kept the Uyghurs in inhumane
detention, while under pressure from the Chinese government to send them
to China,” said Elaine Pearson, Asia director at Human Rights Watch,
calling on Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra’s government to
end this cycle. </p>
<p>VOA contacted the Thai Embassy in Washington and the Thai Foreign
Affairs Ministry for comment on the Uyghurs’ status and the reports of
potential repatriation but received no response. </p>
<p>Babar Baloch, global spokesperson for the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees, told VOA the agency is closely monitoring the
situation and has sought assurances from Thai authorities. </p>
<p>“We continue to remind the authorities of their obligations on
non-refoulement and to advocate for alternatives to detention,” he said
Friday. </p>
<p>Zumretay Arkin, vice president of the Munich-based World Uyghur
Congress, cited ongoing discussions between China and Thailand about
deportations in the context of the 50th anniversary of their diplomatic
relations. </p>
<p>“We remain concerned about their fate and continue to increase public
pressure,” Arkin told VOA, adding that her group had called on partner
organizations to organize global protests outside Thai diplomatic
missions. </p>
<p>Family torn apart </p>
<p>Rahile, a 32-year-old Uyghur mother of three living in Turkey, has
been separated from her husband, detained in Bangkok for nearly a
decade. She asked that his name not be used, fearing reprisal from Thai
authorities.   </p>
<p>“We had just built our home [in Xinjiang] and were living a normal
life when everything turned into a nightmare 12 years ago,” she told VOA
from Kayseri, Turkey, requesting her last name be withheld to protect
relatives in southern Xinjiang. </p>
<p>Their ordeal began in 2013 when a Uyghur working for the Chinese
government warned her husband that his name was on a detention list as
authorities targeted Uyghur men under vague suspicions of alleged
separatism and extremism. </p>
<p>“My husband learned of an escape route and asked if I would follow or
stay behind,” Rahile said. “People around us were disappearing. He had
no choice but to leave.” </p>
<p>The couple fled without passports, relying on smugglers to cross into
Southeast Asia. Intercepted in Thailand in 2014, Rahile and her two
young sons spent 18 months in detention before Turkey resettled more
than 170 women and children. Her husband remained with more than 150
Uyghur migrants in Thailand. </p>
<p>Weeks later, over 100 Uyghurs were forcibly deported to China. “They
were never heard from again,” she said. “I was relieved my husband was
still in Thailand. I hoped we’d reunite soon.” </p>
<p>A decade later, her youngest son, born in Thai detention, has never
met his father. </p>
<p>“The space was so cramped my children could sleep, but I had to
stand,” she said. “Now, my husband has endured that pain for 11
years.” </p>
<p>In Turkey, Rahile juggles jobs to support her family after initial
aid from the local community. </p>
<p>“My children ask why their father isn’t here,” she said. “I have no
answer for them.”</p>

<h2 id="trump-arrives-in-washington-for-inaugural-celebrations">Trump
arrives in Washington for inaugural celebrations</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Donald Trump returned to Washington Saturday evening to
celebrate with family, supporters and political allies ahead of his
second inauguration, a triumphant return for the Republican four years
after he departed the city under the shadow of an attack by his
supporters on the Capitol.</p>
<p>Trump marked his return to power with a celebration at his Trump
National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia, about 48 kilometers outside
Washington.</p>
<p>He addressed the crowd, giving shoutouts to Virginia Gov. Glenn
Youngkin, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, and declaring his Mideast envoy
Steve Witkoff a “great negotiator.” Witkoff this past week helped
negotiate a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas that’s scheduled to
take effect on Sunday.</p>
<p>Soon after his remarks, Trump stepped out onto a clubhouse balcony
while guests gathered on the patio below him for a fireworks display and
performance by tenor Christopher Macchio.</p>
<p>Trump returned to Washington as organizers of Monday’s Inauguration
Day ceremony were scrambling to move inside most of the outdoor events,
including the swearing-in of president and vice president that
traditionally takes place on the steps of the U.S. Capitol, due to
forecast frigid temperatures.</p>
<p>It will be the first time since President Ronald Reagan took the oath
of office in 1985 for his second term that the ceremony will be moved
inside the U.S. Capitol.</p>
<p>Trump made his way from West Palm Beach, Florida, with his wife,
Melania Trump, and their son, Barron, aboard a U.S. military C-32
aircraft on a flight dubbed Special Air Mission 47 — a nod to Trump
becoming the 47th president on Monday.</p>
<p>It’s a courtesy that’s traditionally been extended by the outgoing
administration to the incoming one. Trump did not make a government
plane available to President Joe Biden ahead of his inauguration in
2021, and instead the Democrat flew to Washington on a privately
chartered aircraft.</p>
<p>As his motorcade neared his golf club for Saturday’s celebration, he
was greeted by dozens of well-wishers who gathered along the roadside
and chanted “Trump” and “USA, USA!”</p>
<p>With a blast of Arctic air expected to leave the nation’s capital
facing frigid temperatures on Inauguration Day, Trump opted to move
inside most of Monday’s outdoor events, including the swearing-in
ceremony.</p>
<p>“I think we made the right decision. We’ll be very comfortable now,”
Trump told NBC News in a phone interview Saturday.</p>
<p>On Pennsylvania Avenue leading to the White House, crews were
breaking down metal bleachers that would have been used for outdoor
inauguration viewing stands.</p>
<p>Even before Trump got to town, groups of protesters began taking to
the street in the morning as a light sleet fell.</p>
<p>Melody Hamoud, a Washington resident, wore a pink hat that she had on
at a 2017 march to protest Trump’s first inauguration.</p>
<p>“I just didn’t want to sit home and fret in front of the TV,” she
said. “I wanted to feel like our movement still has energy and be around
others who felt the same.”</p>
<p>Timothy Wallis, 58, flew in for the inauguration from Pocatello,
Idaho, with friends. The group had tickets to watch the ceremony outside
but haven’t been able to get tickets to any of the indoor events.</p>
<p>“We found out on the plane,” he said about the change of plans.</p>
<p>Wallis said he was disappointed about the switch and a little bemused
since he’s used to cold at home. </p>
<p>“We left snow to come here,” he said. “I brought my gloves!”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Trump said Saturday he is preparing to roll out a series
of executive orders and other actions in the first days of his new
administration.</p>
<p>He confirmed he’ll “most likely” grant an extension that might allow
TikTok to keep operating in the U.S. beyond Sunday, when a law that
prohibits mobile app stores and internet hosting services from
distributing TikTok to U.S. users takes effect.</p>
<p>And Trump in the NBC News interview confirmed that his administration
would begin its effort “very early, very quickly” on following through
on a campaign promise of mass deportations of migrants living in the
U.S. without legal permission.</p>
<p>Federal immigration officers are expected to initially target more
than 300 people in the Chicago area with histories of egregious, violent
crimes after Trump takes office Monday, according to an official
familiar with the planning who spoke on condition of anonymity because
plans have not been made public.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s got to happen, and if it doesn’t happen, we’re not going
to have a country any longer,” said Trump, who declined to say where the
deportation operations would begin.</p>
<p>Trump, a Republican, left office in 2021 as a political pariah after
his refusal to accept his loss to Democrat Joe Biden led a mob to
overrun the Capitol. He then broke tradition by skipping Biden’s
inauguration.</p>
<p>Biden will adhere to one of the most potent symbols of the democratic
handover, welcoming Trump to the White House and joining him on the ride
to the Capitol before Trump takes the oath of office.</p>
<p>The first time Trump was sworn into office eight years ago, the
former reality TV star billionaire came in as an outsider disrupting
Washington’s norms, delivering a dark inaugural address as his
swearing-in drew large protests and some clashes in the street.</p>
<p>This time, Trump told NBC, the theme of his inauguration speech would
be “unity and strength, and also the word ‘fairness.’”</p>
<p>As he takes power, the protests were far less noticeable, eclipsed by
the ceremonies and celebrations around Trump’s taking power. As one more
marker of Trump’s remarkable comeback, the events surrounding his
inauguration will be more celebrity-studded than the last time, along
with a noticeable turnout by a cadre of tech-world billionaires.</p>
<p>While Trump held court at his Virginia golf club on Saturday evening,
Vice President-elect JD Vance attended a reception for Cabinet members
and hosted a dinner in Washington.</p>
<p>On Sunday, the eve of his inauguration, Trump is scheduled to
participate in a wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery
before heading to a rally at Capital One Arena in Washington. The rally
will be followed by a private dinner.</p>
<p>On Inauguration Day, Trump will start with the traditional prayer
service at St. John’s Episcopal Church before heading to the White House
for a customary tea with the outgoing president and first lady.</p>
<p>Trump then heads to the Capitol, where his ceremony has been moved
indoors as temperatures are set to plummet and make it the coldest
Inauguration Day in 40 years. It’s not quite clear how the ceremony will
be adapted to the Capitol Rotunda, which holds only 600 people. More
than 250,000 guests were ticketed to view the inauguration from around
the Capitol grounds.</p>
<p>The planned traditional parade down Pennsylvania Avenue has morphed
into an indoor event because of the cold, with Trump again planning to
speak to his gathered supporters before he heads to the White House for
a signing ceremony in the Oval Office. A trio of glitzy balls will
follow in the evening, punctuated by musical performances.</p>
