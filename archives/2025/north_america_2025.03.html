id="china-seeks-more-cooperation-with-us-as-trump-takes-office">China
seeks more cooperation with US as Trump takes office</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Taipei, Taiwan — China has urged the United States to focus on
managing bilateral relationships through cooperation instead of
confrontation as U.S. President Donald Trump kicks off his second term
in office. </p>
<p>“China is willing to work with the new U.S. government to maintain
communication, strengthen cooperation, properly manage differences, and
push China-U.S. relations to make greater progress from a new starting
point,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said during the
regular press conference on Tuesday in Beijing. </p>
<p>Analysts say Beijing hopes to reduce misunderstandings between both
sides through engagement and exchanges in the early stage of the second
Trump presidency. </p>
<p>“The Chinese government hopes China and the U.S. could understand
each other’s needs through communication,” said Shen Dingli, a
Shanghai-based international relations scholar. </p>
<p>“Beijing believes China and the U.S. can still reach a consensus and
avoid many misunderstandings that have arisen during the first Trump
presidency” if both sides prioritize efforts to stabilize bilateral
relations, he told VOA by phone. </p>
<p>Ahead of Trump’s inauguration on Monday, China and Trump’s team
conducted several top-level exchanges, including a call between the new
U.S. president and Chinese President Xi Jinping last Friday. </p>
<p>Trump said he and Xi would “solve many problems together” while the
Chinese president said the key to handling bilateral relations was to
“respect each other’s core interests and major concerns and to find a
proper solution to the problem.”</p>
<p>On Sunday, China’s Vice President Han Zheng, who was in Washington,
D.C., to attend Trump’s inauguration ceremony, met with his American
counterpart JD Vance, and a group of American business leaders,
including Tesla founder Elon Musk.</p>
<p>He said China and the U.S. could “contribute to each other’s
progress, bring benefits to the two countries, and make important
contributions to world peace and development” as long as they “uphold
the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win
cooperation.”</p>
<p>Additionally, Han urged U.S. businesses to “play an active role as a
bridge and make greater contribution to the development of China-U.S.
relations” by continuing to “invest and take root in China.” </p>
<p>Experts say Beijing wants to seize the opportunity to improve
bilateral relations with Washington through these initial engagements
with the Trump administration. </p>
<p>Beijing “would not only prefer to avoid increased sanctions but also
the potential for greater limitations on tech exports to China,” said
Timothy Rich, a political scientist at Western Kentucky University. </p>
<p>While the Chinese government has expressed willingness to cooperate
with the Trump administration, the U.S. president has also held off the
imposition of tariffs on imported goods from China, Mexico, and
Canada. </p>
<p>Instead, he released a broad trade memo that urged the United States
Trade Representative to assess China’s compliance with the “Phase 1”
trade deal that his administration signed with Beijing in 2020, which
required Beijing to increase purchases of U.S. exports by $200 billion
over two years.</p>
<p>Additionally, Trump signed an executive order that would delay the
ban on the popular social media app TikTok for 75 days but threatened to
impose tariffs on Chinese products if Beijing didn’t approve a potential
deal with TikTok.</p>
<p>“And if we said, well, ‘You’re not going to approve it’, then that’s
a certain hostility, and we’ll put tariffs of 25, 30,40, 50%, even
100%,” Trump said on Monday, after signing the executive order for
TikTok.</p>
<p>Rich said Trump’s decision to delay imposing tariffs on Chinese
products shows the U.S. president’s desire to “pressure China to make
some concessions” that he can declare as a victory. </p>
<p>“I suspect the talk of sticking it to China will return in the
absence of some face-saving concession or if other policies start to
falter, as a perceived tough-on-China stance taps into the broader
concern among many Americans,” he told VOA in a written response. </p>
<p>Some Chinese merchants said Trump’s decision to delay the imposition
of tariffs on Chinese products allows them to be better prepared for
similar scenarios in the future. </p>
<p>“I am finding other ways to export products to my American customers
by shifting operations to Southeast Asia,” a Chinese apparel exporter
surnamed Yuan in Shanghai, who asked to be identified only by his last
name due to security concerns, told VOA in a written response. </p>
<p>While Trump’s incoming cabinet includes several politicians known for
their hawkish stance on China, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio,
analysts say it’s unclear how the Trump administration’s China policies
will shape up. </p>
<p>“The ultimate decision-maker is Trump, and if China gives Trump what
he thinks he needs, those hawkish people and their beliefs will quickly
be sidelined and they may not have influence on U.S.-China policy,”
Dexter Roberts, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s
Global China Hub, told VOA by phone. </p>
<p>Despite the lack of clarity on the Trump administration’s China
policies, Shen in Shanghai said official comments from Beijing and
Washington suggest their initial exchanges have been “quite
positive.” </p>
<p>“This might mean there would be less misunderstandings and I think
both sides won’t waste this new opportunity to engage with each other,”
he told VOA.</p>

id="eu-china-warn-against-trade-friction-at-davos-after-trump-return">EU,
China warn against trade friction at Davos after Trump return</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Davos, Switzerland — EU chief Ursula von der Leyen declared Tuesday
that Europe was ready to negotiate with the United States and seek to
improve ties with China as Beijing warned against damaging trade wars in
the face of Donald Trump’s protectionism.</p>
<p>Trump returned to the White House on Monday, and while he may not be
physically present in the Swiss Alpine resort of Davos, he is the
elephant in the room for the executives and leaders hobnobbing at the
annual World Economic Forum.</p>
<p>With Beijing and Brussels facing some of the biggest risks from the
return of self-professed tariff-loving Trump, China’s Vice Premier Ding
Xuexiang and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen took to
the stage first at the forum.</p>
<p>“Protectionism leads nowhere and there are no winners in a trade
war,” Ding said, without mentioning Trump directly.</p>
<p>Trump threatened on Monday to impose tariffs if Beijing rejects his
proposal to keep Chinese-owned app TikTok online on condition that half
of it is sold off.</p>
<p>China is taking a cautious approach to Trump and after the TikTok
threat, Beijing said it hoped the United States would provide a fair
business environment for Chinese firms.</p>
<p>After Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke to Trump by phone on Friday,
he said he hoped for a “good start” to relations with the new US
administration.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, von der Leyen took a conciliatory tone. She said the EU’s
“first priority will be to engage early, discuss common interests and be
ready to negotiate” with Trump.</p>
<p>“We will be pragmatic but we will always stand by our principles, to
protect our interests and uphold our values,” she said.</p>
<p>The European Commission president also stressed that Europe “must
engage constructively with China – to find solutions in our mutual
interest” despite escalating trade tensions between the two.</p>
<p>Brussels has provoked Beijing’s ire with a raft of probes targeting
state subsidies in the green tech sector, as well as slapping tariffs on
Chinese electric cars.</p>
<p>In an apparent reference to the European Union measures, Ding warned
against “erecting green barriers that could disrupt normal economic and
trade cooperation.”</p>
<p>More trade deals</p>
<p>On the campaign trail, Trump said he would impose extra customs
duties on allies including the EU, as well as on China.</p>
<p>After his inauguration, Trump raised the possibility of imposing
25-percent tariffs on Canada and Mexico.</p>
<p>Von der Leyen reiterated her commitment to free trade during her
speech, pointing to recent EU deals with Switzerland, the South American
bloc Mercosur and Mexico.</p>
<p>She also said she and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi wanted to
“upgrade” their partnership.</p>
<p>Trump announced the United States’ withdrawal from the Paris climate
accord, which von de Leyen defended as the “best hope for all humanity”
and vowed: “Europe will stay the course.”</p>
<p>Ukraine is also keeping a very close eye on what Trump’s second
mandate will involve.</p>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is expected to call on world
leaders and company executives to maintain – and ramp up – their support
for his country’s war against Russia.</p>
<p>Zelensky said on Monday he was hopeful Trump would help achieve a
“just peace.”</p>
<p>Embattled German Chancellor Olaf Scholz was also to address the Davos
forum, likely his last as leader ahead of elections next month.</p>
<p>Also speaking on Tuesday will be conservative leader Friedrich Merz,
the favorite to succeed him as chancellor.</p>
<p>‘Better understand’ Trump</p>
<p>Middle East conflicts will likewise be high on the agenda as Israeli
President Isaac Herzog and Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin
Abdulrahman bin Jassim al-Thani speak in separate sessions during the
first full day of the forum.</p>
<p>As a fragile ceasefire holds in the Israel-Hamas war, the WEF will
host a discussion on how to improve aid delivery to the Palestinian
territory of Gaza and how to kickstart the reconstruction and recovery
after heavy bombardment.</p>
<p>Despite suggestions Trump’s return would overshadow the forum that
began on the same day as his inauguration in Washington, WEF President
Borge Brende said the US leader had brought fresh attention to the
gathering.</p>
<p>“It has increased the interest in Davos because people feel they need
to come together to better understand what’s on its way,” Brende told
AFP in an interview.</p>

foreign ministers meet in Washington in signal of Trump’s China
focus</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio will hit the ground
running on Tuesday, hosting a meeting in Washington of his counterparts
from Australia, India and Japan one day after President Donald Trump
started his second term in office.  </p>
<p>The meeting of the so-called “Quad,” four countries sharing concerns
about China’s growing power, will happen at the State Department and is
designed to signal that countering Beijing is a top priority for the new
president. </p>
<p>It could also set the stage for the leaders of the Quad countries to
hold a summit relatively early in the Trump presidency, a person
involved in the planning meetings said. </p>
<p>Trump officials were working on scheduling another gathering of the
foreign ministers at the White House as well, a person involved in
planning meetings said. </p>
<p>Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong, who met her Indian and
Japanese counterparts in Washington over the weekend, said the
invitation for Quad foreign ministers to attend Trump’s inauguration
showed a dedication to close cooperation in the Indo-Pacific
region. </p>
<p>“It’s a demonstration of the collective commitment of all countries
to the Quad, an iron-clad commitment in this time where close
cooperation in the Indo-Pacific is so important,” Wong said on Sunday of
the foreign ministers’ invitation to Washington. </p>
<p>Aside from the meeting itself, Republican Senator Marco Rubio, who
was confirmed on Monday as Trump’s top diplomat, is expected to meet
separately with the three foreign ministers on Tuesday. </p>
<p>The Quad grouping met many times during the administration of former
President Joe Biden, with a focus on Beijing’s military and economic
activities in the Indo-Pacific, particularly in the South China Sea
where U.S. allies have pushed back against Beijing’s territorial
claims.  </p>
<p>The grouping has also pledged to advance cooperation in cybersecurity
to protect supply chains and critical infrastructure, including undersea
cables. </p>
<p>For Australia, it will be important to secure an assurance from
Washington about the massive AUKUS defense project, designed to allow
Australia to acquire nuclear-powered attack submarines and other
advanced weapons such as hypersonic missiles. </p>
<p>China has denounced the Quad as a Cold War construct and says the
AUKUS alliance would intensify a regional arms race.</p>

id="russias-putin-discusses-multipolar-global-order-with-chinas-xi-hours-after-trump-inauguration">Russia’s
Putin discusses ‘multipolar global order’ with China’s Xi hours after
Trump inauguration</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Moscow — Russian President Vladimir Putin had a call Tuesday with
Chinese President Xi Jinping, emphasizing the two countries’ close ties,
a day after Donald Trump was sworn in as the 47th U.S. president.</p>
<p>The two leaders have developed strong personal links that helped
bring relations between Moscow and Beijing, growing even closer after
Putin sent troops into Ukraine in 2022. China has become a major
customer of Russian oil and gas and a source of key technologies amid
sweeping Western sanctions on Moscow.</p>
<p>In Tuesday’s call with Xi, Putin emphasized that Russia-China
relations are based on shared interests, equality and mutual benefits,
noting that they “don’t depend on internal political factors and the
current international environment.”</p>
<p>“We jointly support the development of a more just multipolar global
order and work to ensure indivisible security in Eurasia and the world
as a whole,” Putin told Xi in remarks carried by the Russian state TV.
“Joint efforts by Russia and China play an important stabilizing role in
global affairs.”</p>
<p>Xi similarly praised close cooperation between Moscow and Beijing,
saying it helps “bring positive energy to reforming and developing the
global system.”</p>
<p>While neither leader directly mentioned Trump in the televised
fragment of their call, the timing of the conversation may signal that
Putin and Xi want to coordinate their action in dialogue with the new
U.S. administration.</p>
<p>The Chinese president had a call with Trump on Friday and expressed
hope for positive ties with the U.S.</p>
<p>Trump had threatened to impose tariffs and other measures against
China in his second term, while also hinting at ways in which the two
rival powers could cooperate on issues such as regional conflicts and
curbing the export of substances used in the production of fentanyl.</p>
<p>Putin, who is yet to talk to Trump, congratulated him on taking
office in televised remarks during a video call with officials and
welcomed his intention to open a dialogue with Moscow.</p>
<p>Trump told reporters Monday after taking office that Ukrainian
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had told him he wanted to make a peace
deal and voiced hope that Putin would follow suit. He added that Putin
would be destroying Russia by failing to make a deal, pointing out
Russia’s economic troubles, including high inflation.</p>
<p>Putin hailed Trump’s openness to dialogue as he spoke to Russia’s
Security Council members shortly before the U.S. president’s
inauguration.</p>
<p>“We hear the statements from Trump and members of his team about
their desire to restore direct contact with Russia, which were halted
through no fault of ours by the outgoing administration,” Putin said on
Monday. “We also hear his statements about the need to do everything to
prevent World War III. We certainly welcome such an approach and
congratulate the U.S. president-elect on taking office.”</p>
<p>The Russian leader also stressed that dialogue between the two
nations should be based on “equal basis and mutual respect, taking into
account the important role our countries play on some key issues on the
global agenda, including the strengthening of global stability and
security.”</p>
<p>Putin also noted that Moscow is open to dialogue with the Trump
administration on the conflict in Ukraine, emphasizing the need to
respect Russia’s interests and adding that “the most important thing is
to remove the root causes of the crisis.”</p>
<p>“As for the settlement of the situation, I would like to underline
that its goal should not be a short truce, not some kind of respite for
regrouping forces and rearmament with the aim of subsequently continuing
the conflict, but a long-term peace based on respect for the legitimate
interests of all people, all nations living in this region,” Putin
said.</p>

<h2 id="taliban-free-2-americans-in-prisoner-swap-with-us">Taliban free
2 Americans in prisoner swap with US</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Islamabad — Taliban authorities in Afghanistan announced Tuesday the
release of two American nationals as part of a prisoner exchange for one
of their members, who was held in the United States on
narcotics-terrorism charges.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Kabul identified the freed Afghan
as Khan Mohammad and described him as a “mujahid,” a term the Taliban
use for their fighters.</p>
<p>The statement said that the man was arrested nearly two decades ago
in the eastern Afghan province of Nangarhar and subsequently extradited
to the U.S., where a federal court convicted him, resulting in his
imprisonment for life in California.</p>
<p>The de facto Afghan government did not name the two freed American
citizens or specify how many had been freed, but relatives and U.S.
media reports identified them as Ryan Corbett, 42, and William Wallace
McKenty, 69.</p>
<p>“Today, our hearts are filled with overwhelming gratitude and praise
to God for sustaining Ryan’s life and bringing him back home after what
has been the most challenging and uncertain 894 days of our lives,” his
family stated Tuesday.</p>
<p>Limited public information is available about McKenty as his family
reportedly requested U.S. authorities to maintain his anonymity.</p>
<p>The prisoner exchange was in the making for many months and
reportedly occurred during Democratic President Joe Biden’s final hours
in office before Republican President Donald Trump was inaugurated on
Monday.</p>
<p>Corbett’s family statement praised both the Trump and Biden
administrations for their efforts to facilitate the prisoner
exchange.</p>
<p>The Taliban said Tuesday that Qatar played an “effective role” in
facilitating their prisoner swap agreement with the United States.</p>
<p>U.S. officials and relatives have reported that two other American
captives, George Glezmann, a former airline mechanic, and Mahmood
Habibi, a naturalized American, remain in Taliban custody in
Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Habibi and Glezmann were apprehended shortly after a U.S. drone
strike in July 2022 killed fugitive al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahri in
his hideout in an affluent Afghan capital neighborhood.</p>
<p>Glezmann, 65, was lawfully visiting Kabul as a tourist when he was
seized by the Taliban’s intelligence services without charge, his
relatives said.</p>
<p>Habibi’s family says he was arrested by the Taliban, along with 30
other employees of the company he worked at, following the U.S. drone
strike. While his co-workers were released, Habibi’s whereabouts remain
unknown, and Taliban officials have refuted claims that he is in their
custody.</p>
<p>“It was our hope that Ryan, George, and Mahmoud would be returned to
their families together, and we cannot imagine the pain that our good
fortune will bring them,” Corbett’s family stated Tuesday.</p>
<p>Habibi’s relatives welcomed the reunion of Corbett and McKenty with
their families, confident the Trump administration will intensify
efforts to secure his freedom from his “wrongful” detention.</p>
<p>“We have reason to be confident Mahmood is alive and in Taliban
custody, despite their hollow denials of holding him,” his brother Ahmad
Habibi stated,</p>
<p>Global Reach, a nonprofit working with the family of Mahmood Habibi
since his arrest, shared the family statement with VOA via email.</p>
<p>“While we are happy for Ryan and William, we are disappointed that
Mahmood was not included in the deal,” said the organization’s CEO
Mickey Bergman.</p>

<li>Trump declares ‘national energy emergency’

<p>
President Trump began his first day back in office with a series of
executive orders aimed at undermining climate policy and unleashing
American energy production. He declared a
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/national-energy-emergency?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--smolkCoZsqqAC6STlg_1i3XqfbCnw0jjAbK7XaOGA5cL8DTtntrYOI13HD6fpxG6Au5Aj" target="_self">“national
energy emergency,”</a> describing an “active threat to the American
people from high energy prices.” The order directs agency leaders to
“exercise any lawful emergency authorities available to them, as well as
all other lawful authorities they may possess” to facilitate U.S. energy
production, including — but not limited to — activities on federal
lands. The stated goal of many of the policies put forward under this
energy emergency is to bring down energy costs for American consumers.
But few of them are designed to do so. Instead, they aim to do virtually
the opposite:

The order says the government “shall not issue new or renewed approvals,

impacts on the economy, environment and other factors. The order also
opens the door to offshore wind developers potentially losing their
leases. This affects all offshore wind development in the U.S., as well
as wind projects on federal lands. The order specifically bans wind
energy development at the site sought after for the Lava Ridge wind
project in Idaho. The project was fully permitted days before the end of

loss of international leadership on climate issues, there’s no tangible
repercussions for exiting the agreement. Nor, as many party nations
consistently demonstrate, any legal recourse for staying in while
failing to meet targets or set sufficient goals.” It takes a full year
for withdrawal to become official. But Trump will almost certainly
henceforth act as if the U.S. is no longer bound by the treaty, which
has been adopted by nearly every other nation on Earth, in an effort to
keep global warming “well below” 2 degrees Celsius.

<p class="drop-caps">
Here we go.
</p>
<p>
Here we go: On Monday, Donald Trump was sworn in as the 47th president
of the United States.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>Surrounded by some of the country’s richest men, including
Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, and the oil magnate Harold Hamm, Trump
rejected what he called a “radical and corrupt establishment” that has
“extracted power and wealth from our citizens” while promising a new
golden age for the United States.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>At the center of that golden age, he said, was an almost
totally unregulated fossil fuel economy. “Today I will also declare a
national energy emergency,” he said. “We will drill, baby, drill.”
</p>
<p>
<span></span>Over the next 12 hours, he signed a series of executive
orders that relaxed protections across the oil and gas sector while
imposing costly new restrictions on wind turbines, electric vehicles,
and other forms of renewable energy. He demonstrated that his extreme
vision for the American government — a new order where the executive
reigns supreme and Congress does not control the power of the purse —
will run straight through his climate and energy policy.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>You could see in his actions, too, what could become
fragility in his governing coalition — times and situations where he
might too eagerly slap a cost on a friend because he believes they are a
foe.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>But all that remains in the future. For now, Trump is in
charge.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>Trump’s first day was about undermining climate policy in
virtually any form that he could find. Soon after taking the oath, Trump
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-leaves-paris-agreement" target="_self"><u>began
the process</u></a> of pulling the United States out of the Paris
Agreement on climate change. He
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/wind-executive-order-trump" target="_self"><u>announced</u></a>
a broad freeze on virtually all federal wind energy permits, throwing at
least one large-scale onshore wind farm into chaos while smothering
virtually all offshore wind energy projects, including several planned
for the East Coast. He moved to weaken energy and water efficiency rules
for lightbulbs, showerheads, washing machines, and dishwashers. He began
the multi-year process of rewriting the Environmental Protection
Agency’s rules on tailpipe pollution from cars and light trucks, which
he has described as lifting the federal government’s “EV mandate.” And
he promised to open up new tracts of federal land for oil and gas
drilling, including in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>But most important were a series of executive actions that
Trump signed in the late evening, many under the bearing of a “national
energy emergency.” In these orders, Trump told the Environmental
Protection Agency to study whether carbon dioxide and other greenhouse
gases are dangerous air pollutants. This question has been a matter of
settled science for decades — and, more importantly, has not been under
legal dispute since 2009. In the same set of orders, Trump lifted
federal environmental and permitting rules, potentially setting up a
move that could force blue states — particularly those in the Northeast
and West Coast — to accept new oil and gas pipelines and refineries.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>Finally, and most importantly, Trump asserted the right to
freeze virtually all ongoing federal spending under the Inflation
Reduction Act — <em><em>and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law</em></em>
— for 90 days. Even after this time elapses, funding programs will have
to be approved by the White House Office of Management and Budget. This
move places at least tens of millions of dollars of federal contracts at
risk, and it raises questions about the federal government’s ability to
operate as a reliable counterparty. It is also of dubious
Constitutionality because it appears to violate Congress’s sole
authority over federal spending.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>The stated goal of many of these policies is to bring down
energy costs for American consumers. The president’s national energy
emergency, for example, takes as its premise that the country is growing
its energy supply too slowly. The United States, it suggests, is at
imminent risk of running out of energy for new technology. (You might
ask yourself why — if this is the case — Trump has also frozen all
federal wind projects. But then you misunderstand Trump’s particular
genius.)
</p>
<p>
<span></span>Yet bringing down costs will be difficult. Energy costs —
and particularly <em><em>oil</em></em> costs — are already low. Today,
as Trump’s second term begins, gasoline stands at $3.13 a gallon,
<a href="https://gasprices.aaa.com/" target="_blank"><u>according to
AAA</u></a>. That’s about five cents above where it stood a year ago,
and it’s within
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=42435" target="_blank"><u>the
inflation-adjusted range</u></a> where gas prices hovered for much of
Trump’s first term. (Oil prices crashed in 2020 because of the pandemic,
but the industry — and the American public — would obviously prefer not
to repeat that debacle.)
</p>
<p>
<span></span>How much further could energy prices fall? Look at it this
way: A barrel of oil in the U.S. costs $76 today, per the West Texas
benchmark. (The international benchmark, called Brent, is a smidge
higher at $79.) Last year, oil producers across much of the Permian
Basin reported that they could break even only if oil
<a href="https://www.tgs.com/weekly-spotlight/2024-09-16" target="_blank"><u>stayed
at or above</u></a> about $66 a barrel. The
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=18651" target="_blank"><u>rough
rule of thumb</u></a> is that for a $1 change in the per-barrel oil
price, drivers will eventually see a roughly 2.5 cent change in prices
at the pump. You can see how hard it will be to push oil prices down to
record lows, at least with current levels of economic activity, interest
rates, and demand volumes.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>Which isn’t to say that it’s impossible. Trump will have
advantages when dealing with the oil and gas industry that his immediate
predecessor did not enjoy. Chief among these is that the industry’s
leaders like him, want to see him succeed, and will be more willing to
do favors for him — even if it means suffering thinner margins. These
may help keep a lid on electricity prices, which are far more sensitive
to natural gas and which really are set to surge as a new wave of
factories, EVs, and data centers comes online.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>Maybe! We’ll see. When you look closer, what stands out
about Trump’s policies is how few of them are designed to lower energy
prices. Instead, they aim to do virtually the opposite:
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/energy-oil/trump-oil-gas-policy-drilling-donors-3438e99e" target="_blank"><u>shore
up</u></a> oil and gas demand. According to <em><em>The Wall Street
Journal, </em></em>ensuring demand for oil and gas products — and not
deregulating drilling further — is what the industry has asked Trump to
do. That makes sense. The United States is, at the moment, producing
more oil and gas than any country in world history. The fossil fuel
industry’s problem isn’t <em><em>getting </em></em>gas out of the
ground, but finding people to sell it to. By suspending fuel economy and
energy efficiency rules, Trump can force Americans to use more energy —
and spend more on oil and gas — to do the same amount of useful work.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>In other places, what stands out about Trump’s policies is
their incoherence — and how few of his constituencies they will satisfy.
Late on Monday, Trump suggested that he might impose 25% tariffs on
Canada and Mexico as soon as February 1. Such an action would quickly
harm key segments of the American energy industry. Canada exports
<a href="https://www.cer-rec.gc.ca/en/data-analysis/energy-markets/market-snapshots/2024/market-snapshot-almost-all-canadian-crude-oil-exports-went-to-the-united-states-in-2023.html" target="_blank"><u>about
$124 billion of crude oil</u></a> to the United States every year — much
of it a heavy, sludgy petroleum from the Albertan oil sands. That sludge
is piped across North America, then
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=62664" target="_blank"><u>fed
into U.S. refineries</u></a>, where it helps produce a large portion of
America’s fuel supply. (Alberta’s heavy, sulfurous sludge is
particularly well-suited to mixing with the light, sweet crude produced
by American frackers.) Should Trump impose those tariffs, in other
words, he would gambol into a self-imposed energy crisis.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>Tariffs are not the only place where Trump could undermine
his own policies. One of his executive orders on Monday aimed to
establish America as “the leading producer and processor of non-fuel
minerals, including rare earth minerals”; three clauses later, it
announced an end to the federal government’s so-called “EV mandate.”
</p>
<p>
<span></span>But by kneecapping demand for electric vehicles, Trump will
hurt the critical minerals industry more than any anti-growth hippie
could fathom. For the past few years, corporate America and Wall Street
have invested billions of dollars in lithium and rare-earths mining and
processing facilities across the country. These projects, which are
largely in Republican districts, only make financial sense in a world
where the United States produces a large and growing number of electric
vehicles: EVs make up the lion’s share of future demand for lithium,
rare earth elements, and other geostrategically sensitive rocks, and any
mines or refining facilities will only pencil out in a world where EVs
purchase their output. If Trump kills the non-Tesla part of the EV
industry, then he will also mortally harm those projects’ economics.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>Energy is a strange issue. Although it is one of the key
inputs into the modern industrial economy, millions of Americans engage
with it as an expressive, symbolic matter — as just another battleground
in the culture war. Today, Donald Trump has become the most powerful
American in that category. On his first day in office, he has
demonstrated that he will use energy policy to advance his extreme ideas
about how the Constitution and presidential authority works. How far he
gets now will depend on what the American public, business leaders,
congressional Republicans, and the Supreme Court’s arch-conservative
majority will accept — and whether his fragile constituency is really
ready to pay the costs of “American greatness.”

leaves office and Washington after 50 years but says ‘we’re not leaving
the fight’</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Joe Biden on Monday wrapped up a more than 50-year
political career, but promised that “we’re not leaving the fight,” as he
bid farewell to the presidency and flew to California to unwind with his
family and ease back into private life.</p>
<p>Biden spoke not long after watching his successor, Republican
President Donald Trump, pledge during his inaugural address to
“completely and totally reverse” everything that his Democratic
predecessor did.</p>
<p>In the final hours before the noontime transfer of executive power,
Biden extended courtesies to the man he had turned out of the Oval
Office four years ago. Trump denied losing the 2020 election and refused
to offer similar niceties to Biden upon his inauguration in 2021.</p>
<p>The bitter cold day opened with Biden and his wife, Jill, receiving
Trump, and his wife, Melania, for a traditional Inauguration Day
meet-and-greet over tea at the White House.</p>
<p>“Welcome home,” Biden told Trump.</p>
<p>Afterward, the rivals, who share a history of political animosity,
rode in a limousine to the Capitol where Trump was sworn in as the 47th
president.</p>
<p>“Our recent election is a mandate to completely and totally reverse a
horrible betrayal,” Trump said about the work of the Biden
administration. Biden sat expressionless in the front row.</p>
<p>As Trump gave his address, the residence staff at the White House got
to work clearing out the remainder of Biden’s belongings so they could
move Trump and his family back in. The work of turning over the White
House includes redecorating the Oval Office.</p>
<p>Walls in the press offices that were bare in the morning after most
of the staff had ended their government service were decorated by
midafternoon with fresh photographs of Trump.</p>
<p>After Trump’s address, the new president and his wife walked the
Bidens outside to a Marine helicopter that had been waiting on the
Capitol grounds to fly them to Joint Base Andrews for a farewell event
with his staff.</p>
<p>“We couldn’t have done anything we did without you,” Biden told those
who worked for his administration in the White House. “No president gets
to choose the moment they enter history, but they get to choose the team
they enter history with, and we chose the best damn team in the
world.”</p>
<p>Even though they may feel “knocked down” by the turn of events, he
said what was important was how quickly they get back up.</p>
<p>“We’re leaving office. We’re not leaving the fight,” Biden said,
urging them to stay engaged.</p>
<p>And he appeared to joke about Trump’s speech, chuckling as he said,
“we heard the inaugural address today. We got a lot more to do.” Biden
then made the sign of the cross and everyone laughed.</p>
<p>He and the first lady then walked across the tarmac to the familiar
blue-and-white Air Force plane he flew on as president for the flight to
Santa Ynez, California.</p>

<p>“Everyone needs to be on high alert,” Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass
said Monday.</p>
<p>California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire)
spokesperson Brice Bennett said in a statement Monday that his agency —
with help from federal, local and tribal firefighting agencies — have
more than 2,500 people and has prepositioned equipment for quick
deployment to combat any new outbreaks.</p>
<p>At least 27 people have died in a series of wildfires across the Los
Angeles area during the past two weeks as Santa Ana winds mixed with dry
conditions on the ground to quickly spread blazes.</p>
<p>The two largest fires are still burning, including the Palisades Fire
near the coast on the western side of Los Angeles and the Eaton Fire in
the foothills to the north of the city.</p>
<p>The Palisades Fire was 61% contained and has burned about 96 square
kilometers, according to Cal Fire. The Eaton Fire was 87% contained
after burning 57 square kilometers.</p>
<p>Together, the fires have destroyed 14,000 structures since
Jan. 7.</p>
<p>California Governor Gavin Newsom issued an executive order Monday
designed to protect Southern California residents from landslides and
flooding. The order suspends some rules and regulations and speeds up
the removal of debris that, if not removed promptly, could result in
landslides, mudslides and flash floods.</p>
<p>“This order helps keep our emergency response focused on protecting
communities, not permits and paperwork,” Newsom said.</p>

<h2
id="trump-orders-include-withdrawing-from-who-halting-us-foreign-aid">Trump
orders include withdrawing from WHO, halting US foreign aid</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump issued a series of executive actions
after taking office Monday, including moving to withdraw from
international health and climate bodies and directing a suspension of
U.S. foreign aid.</p>
<p>A set of orders focused on immigration, such as declaring an
emergency on the U.S.-Mexico border, ending asylum and halting
birthright citizenship for some children born in the United States.</p>
<p>Trump also ordered vetting and screening “to the maximum degree
possible” all those who want to enter the United States, and for the
government to identify countries that may have screening procedures
deficient enough to warrant blocking their nationals from entering the
United States.</p>
<p>In his first term in office, Trump pursued an “America First” form of
foreign policy, and an order he signed Monday directs new Secretary of
State Marco Rubio to focus State Department efforts on that mission.</p>
<p>“From this day forward, the foreign policy of the United States shall
champion core American interests and always put America and American
citizens first,” the order said.</p>
<p>Trump ordered the United States to withdraw from the 2015 Paris
climate accord, a repeat of a move he also made in his first term. Trump
said the U.S. has a successful record of “advancing both economic and
environmental objectives” that should be a model to other countries.</p>
<p>Nearly 200 countries signed the agreement aimed at limiting global
warming with each country providing its own plan for limiting greenhouse
gas emissions that contribute to climate change.</p>
<p>In another repeat from his first time in office, Trump ordered the
United States to withdraw from the World Health Organization due to
complaints that the agency mismanaged the COVID-19 pandemic and gets too
much funding from the U.S.</p>
<p>WHO said in a statement Tuesday it “regrets” Trump’s announcement and
that it looks forward to constructive talks to maintain a partnership
with the United States “for the benefit of the health and well-being of
millions of people around the globe.”</p>
<p>“For over seven decades, WHO and the USA have saved countless lives
and protected Americans and all people from health threats,” WHO said.
“Together, we ended smallpox, and together we have brought polio to the
brink of eradication. American institutions have contributed to and
benefited from membership in WHO.”</p>
<p>Calling U.S. foreign aid “not aligned with American interests,” Trump
issued an order to pause foreign development assistance for 90 days and
for the programs to undergo reviews.</p>
<p>Funding for many programs has already been appropriated by Congress,
so it was not clear how much aid would be initially affected by the
order.</p>
<p>Trump also reversed an order signed by former President Joe Biden
last week that had removed Cuba from the list of state sponsors of
terror.</p>
<p>Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel responded to Trump’s move Monday by
calling it “an act of arrogance and disregard for the truth.”</p>
<p>On trade, Trump issued an order calling for a review of a number of
trade agreements, including one with China and the U.S.-Mexico-Canada
Agreement.</p>
<p>He also specifically called for an assessment of “unlawful migration
and fentanyl flows” from Canada, Mexico and China. Ahead of taking
office, Trump said those countries would need to act on those areas in
order to avoid tariffs on goods sent to the United States.</p>
<p>In response to a law passed during Biden’s term that would have
blocked TikTok in the United States in connection with national security
concerns, Trump signed an order telling the Justice Department not to
enforce that ban until his administration can “determine the appropriate
course forward.”</p>
<p>The law directed a TikTok ban unless its China-based parent company
sold it to an approved buyer. U.S. officials promoting the ban expressed
concerns that the Chinese government could obtain Americans’ digital
data.</p>
<p>Trump himself tried to carry out a similar ban during his first term,
but in recent weeks has championed keeping TikTok available to U.S.
users, including the potential for the U.S. government to acquire a
stake in the company.</p>

<h2 id="trump-supporters-celebrate-pardon-of-jan.-6-rioters">Trump
supporters celebrate pardon of Jan. 6 rioters</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The atmosphere was celebratory outside the Central
Detention Facility prison in Washington late Monday night.</p>
<p>Just hours after taking the oath of office, U.S. President Donald
Trump pardoned about 1,500 people who participated in the Jan. 6, 2021,
attack on the U.S. Capitol, during which Trump supporters tried to
overturn the results of the 2020 election.</p>
<p>Many of them were held in the Central Detention Facility in southeast
Washington. Despite the frigid cold, their supporters gathered outside
the building, looking forward to what they told VOA they hoped would be
their speedy release. As of publication, that release had not happened
yet.</p>
<p>The police presence outside the prison was substantial throughout the
night. So, too, was the media presence. And even though supporters at
one point briefly rushed the prison entrance, only to be blocked by
police, they still told VOA that the gathering was joyous and
patriotic.</p>
<p>While brandishing an American flag, Ben Pollock told VOA that two of
his children — Olivia and Jonathan — were jailed for taking part in the
attack. He said he himself was present that day, too, but that he didn’t
enter the Capitol Building.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Pollock, from Florida, said he was “ecstatic, praising God” that his
children would be released soon. “It’s been such a spiritual
journey.”</p>
<p>Former fugitives Olivia and Jonathan Pollock are charged with
assaulting, resisting or impeding certain officers, as well as theft of
government property, according to media reports. The latter is accused
of grabbing an officer by the waist and pulling the officer down a set
of stairs, and punching another officer in the face.</p>
<p>Their father cried as he talked about Jan. 6 — not because he
regretted that day, which he didn’t, but because he said he felt so
deeply that those who were jailed for participating in the attack had
been unfairly prosecuted.</p>
<p>“It’s broken my heart for four years. I’ve cried and cried and cried
over these families,” Pollock said. “Today is their day of freedom.”</p>
<p>Pollock and others who spoke with VOA said they felt like Trump’s
executive order meant that they were finally getting vindication for
Jan. 6.</p>
<p>For them, Trump’s pardon confirmed their belief that the 2020
election was rigged, they told VOA. It also represented the fulfillment
of a promise that Trump had made during his campaign to absolve those
who took part in the attack, they said.</p>
<p>Numerous reports and investigations have shown that the 2020 election
was not stolen. Election officials have confirmed the election was
secure, and Trump and his allies have failed to produce any evidence to
substantiate the allegations of fraud.</p>
<p>Despite the evidence that the election was not stolen, several people
outside the prison told VOA that Trump’s pardon reinforced their belief
that it actually had been.</p>
<p>“The election was stolen. We all see it. The whole world saw it,”
Stephanie Liu, from New York told VOA.</p>
<p>Liu, who was present at the Capitol on Jan. 6, said she has come to
the prison every month for the past two-and-a-half years to visit the
imprisoned Jan. 6 rioters. “Political prisoners should not exist in this
country,” said Liu, who is originally from China.</p>
<p>Helena Gibson, from the U.S. capital, made a similar point: “This has
been four long years of these Jan. 6 political hostages.”</p>
<p>That language echoes Trump, who calls those who stormed the Capitol
“hostages” and “unbelievable patriots.”</p>
<p>One day after the attack, Trump said that “those who broke the law”
during the riot would “pay.” But defending them ended up becoming a
significant component of his 2024 presidential campaign.</p>
<p>Tom Jeffries, from Virginia, said he was “somewhat disappointed” that
Trump didn’t mention the Jan. 6 defendants during his inaugural
address.</p>
<p>“But knowing him, I knew that he hadn’t forgotten about it. He was
waiting for the right time to do it,” Jeffries told VOA. “That was my
hope, and God granted my wish.”</p>
<p>Trump’s decision to pardon those who took part in the attack was met
with swift condemnation from Democrat lawmakers like Senator Chris
Murphy.</p>
<p>By pardoning the rioters, “Trump has transformed American democracy,”
Murphy said in a post on X. “Political violence is now mainstream.”</p>
<p>Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer also said those who invaded
the Capitol should not have been pardoned.</p>
<p>“Trump is ushering in a Golden Age for people that break the law and
attempt to overthrow the government,” Schumer said in a statement.</p>

<h2 id="starry-sundance-fest-moves-ahead-in-wake-of-la-fires">Starry
Sundance fest moves ahead in wake of LA fires</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Los Angeles — The U.S. film industry’s first big gathering since
fires devastated Los Angeles will begin Thursday at the Sundance
festival, where highlights include a glitzy new Jennifer Lopez musical
and a dark Benedict Cumberbatch drama.</p>
<p>Hollywood’s annual pilgrimage to the Rocky Mountains to premiere the
coming year’s most-anticipated indie films is taking place in somber
circumstances, after the blazes that killed at least 27 people and
brought the entertainment capital to a halt.</p>
<p>Festival chiefs held lengthy talks with filmmakers, including those
“who lost homes or were displaced” by the blazes, before deciding to
press ahead, said Sundance director Eugene Hernandez.</p>
<p>Organizers heard “harrowing stories of people running out of their
homes, evacuating… with their hard drives under their arms” to ensure
their films survived, he told AFP.</p>
<p>“Everybody to a person just wants to look forward and wants to look
ahead… it’ll be a nice moment of reunion and community.”</p>
<p>Among the 88 features being screened in Utah’s Park City is
“Rebuilding,” about a rancher who loses everything in a wildfire.</p>
<p>“It takes on an added poignance, for those who will watch it next
week,” said Hernandez.</p>
<p>Josh O’Connor, known for “The Crown” and “Challengers,” plays the
lead role. </p>
<p>“It’s an incredible film, and one that we felt was important to show,
based on that spirit of resilience,” said Sundance programming director
Kim Yutani.</p>
<p>“I think it will be a particularly moving one for people to see.”</p>
<p>J-Lo, Cumberbatch</p>
<p>A-lister Lopez brings her first film to Sundance, with “Kiss of the
Spider Woman.”</p>
<p>From “Dreamgirls” director Bill Condon, the film is based on the
Broadway adaptation of Argentine author Manuel Puig’s famous novel.</p>
<p>Lopez plays Aurora, a silver-screen diva whose life and roles are
discussed by two mismatched prisoners as they form an unlikely bond in
their grim cell. </p>
<p>While harking back to grand Golden Age Hollywood musicals with its
fabulous costumes and Lopez’s “knockout musical performance,” the film
is a more dramatic and independent take on the genre, said
Hernandez.</p>
<p>Cumberbatch stars in another literary adaptation, “The Thing With
Feathers,” based on Max Porter’s experimental and poetic novel about a
grieving husband and two young sons.</p>
<p>“It’s one of these juicy roles that big actors relish taking a bite
out of,” said Yutani.</p>
<p>Family tragedy and fatherhood are also the themes of “Omaha,” with
John Magaro (“Past Lives”) delivering “an emotional gut punch of a role”
that could spell awards, according to Yutani.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Olivia Colman plays a mother taking her non-binary teen to
visit their gay grandfather (John Lithgow) in “Jimpa.”</p>
<p>Rapper A$AP Rocky and late-night host Conan O’Brien make up the
eclectic cast of mystery “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You.”</p>
<p>And “The Bear” star Ayo Edebiri teams up with John Malkovich for
thriller “Opus,” about a young writer investigating the mysterious
disappearance of a legendary pop star.</p>
<p>Music, politics</p>
<p>Music is also a prominent theme of Sundance’s documentary selection,
which has launched several of the most recent Oscar-winning non-fiction
films.</p>
<p>A new “must-see” Jeff Buckley documentary features never-before-seen
footage from “three very important women in his life, including his
mother,” said Yutani.</p>
<p>Elegance Bratton explores the Chicago roots of house music with “Move
Ya Body: The Birth of House,” while Oscar-winning director Questlove
examines funk pioneer Sly Stone in “Sly Lives! (aka The Burden of Black
Genius).”</p>
<p>Politics will again be prominent.</p>
<p>Former New Zealand leader Jacinda Ardern is expected in town to
promote behind-the-scenes documentary “Prime Minister.”</p>
<p>“The Jinx” director Andrew Jarecki explores violence and corruption
in the U.S. prison system with “The Alabama Solution.” </p>
<p>And, days after the Gaza ceasefire agreement took effect,
Palestinian-American director Cherien Dabis will unveil her
“groundbreaking” new film “All That’s Left of You,” which has been given
a highly prominent Saturday evening premiere at Sundance’s biggest
venue.</p>
<p>“That is not an accident. This is a really special one,” said
Yutani.</p>
<p>“I have not seen a film about a Palestinian family told in quite this
way.”</p>
<p>The 2025 Sundance Film Festival runs from Jan. 23 through Feb. 2.</p>

<h2 id="trump-issues-sweeping-pardon-of-1500-jan.-6-defendants">Trump
issues sweeping pardon of 1,500 Jan. 6 defendants</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Monday pardoned more than
1,500 of his supporters charged with crimes in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack
on the U.S. Capitol, including people who assaulted police, using his
clemency powers on his first day in office to dismantle the largest
investigation and prosecution in Justice Department history.</p>
<p>Among those set to be released from prison are defendants captured on
camera committing violent attacks on law enforcement as lawmakers met to
certify President Joe Biden’s 2020 election victory. Leaders of the Oath
Keepers and Proud Boys extremist groups convicted of seditious
conspiracy in the most serious cases brought by the Justice Department
will also be freed from prison after having their sentences
commuted.</p>
<p>Trump is directing the attorney general to seek the dismissal of
about 450 pending Jan. 6 cases.</p>
<p>The pardons were expected after Trump’s yearslong campaign to rewrite
the history of the Jan. 6 attack that left more than 100 police officers
injured and threatened the peaceful transfer of power. Yet the scope of
the clemency still comes as a massive blow to the Justice Department’s
effort to hold participants accountable over what has been described as
one of the darkest days in American history.</p>
<p>Trump had suggested in the weeks leading up to his return to the
White House that instead of blanket pardons he was going to look at the
Jan. 6 defendants on a case-by-case basis. Vice President JD Vance had
said just days ago that people responsible for the violence during the
Capitol riot “obviously” should not be pardoned.</p>
<p>Casting the rioters as “patriots” and “hostages,” Trump has claimed
they were unfairly treated by the Justice Department that also charged
him with federal crimes in two cases he contends were politically
motivated. Trump said the pardons end “a grave national injustice that
has been perpetrated upon the American people over the last four years
and begins a process of national reconciliation.”</p>
<p>An attorney for Enrique Tarrio, the former national chairman of the
Proud Boys who was sentenced to 22 years in prison for seditious
conspiracy, said he expects his client to be released from prison Monday
night. Tarrio, who was convicted of orchestrating a failed plot to keep
Donald Trump in power after the Republican lost the 2020 election, is
serving the longest sentence of any of the Jan. 6 defendants.</p>
<p>The pardons come weeks after Trump’s own Jan. 6 case was dismissed
because of the Justice Department’s policy against prosecuting sitting
presidents.</p>
<p>Hundreds of Jan. 6 defendants who didn’t engage in any of the
violence and destruction were charged with misdemeanor trespassing
offenses, and many of those served little to no time behind bars.</p>
<p>But the violence that day has been documented extensively through
videos, testimony and other evidence showing rioters — some armed with
poles, bats and bear spray — swarming the Capitol, quickly overrunning
overwhelmed police, shattering windows and sending lawmakers and aides
running into hiding.</p>
<p>Police were dragged into the crowd and beaten. One officer screamed
in pain as he was crushed in a doorframe, and another suffered a heart
attack after a rioter pressed a stun gun against his neck and repeatedly
shocked him. Officers have described in testimony fearing for their
lives as members of the mob hurled insults and obscenities at them.</p>
<p>Of the more than 1,500 people charged, about 250 people have been
convicted of crimes by a judge or a jury after a trial. At least 1,020
had pleaded guilty to crimes as of Jan. 1. Only two people were
acquitted of all charges by judges after bench trials. No jury has fully
acquitted a Capitol riot defendant.</p>
<p>More than 1,000 rioters have already been sentenced, with over 700
receiving at least some time behind bars. The rest were given some
combination of probation, community service, home detention or
fines.</p>

<h2 id="in-day-steeped-with-tradition-donald-trump-is-sworn-in">In day
steeped with tradition, Donald Trump is sworn in</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Amid frigid temperatures in the nation’s capital, the
peaceful transfer of power from one presidential administration to the
next took place Monday.</p>
<p>The inauguration events, starting with a church service and
culminating in an oath and inaugural speech at the Capitol building,
were attended by former presidents and their families, foreign
dignitaries, and tech billionaires.</p>
<p>Members of the “press pool” — a group of reporters, photographers and
video journalists — were on hand to capture the day’s events for the
media outlets that make up the White House Correspondents’
Association.</p>
<p>Through the press pool, accredited journalists take turns covering
the president’s daily activities to ensure 24-7 coverage of the American
leader. VOA White House correspondent Misha Komadovsky was assigned to
Monday morning’s inaugural events.</p>
<p>“Today, I’ll be your eyes and ears during the first steps of Donald
Trump’s inauguration,” Komadovsky emailed at around 8 a.m. local time as
part of his assignments.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The pool report had noted that the inaugural events were to follow a
traditional course: a morning church service and a meeting between the
outgoing and incoming first families before traveling to the
inauguration.</p>
<p>The service at St. John’s Episcopal Church in Lafayette Park across
from the White House has been a part of inauguration events since 1933,
when Franklin D. Roosevelt attended a service before being sworn in as
the 32nd president.</p>
<p>Trump, as the 47th U.S. president, followed in his predecessors’
footsteps. He and first lady Melania Trump sat in the front row of the
church, alongside his vice president, JD Vance, and second lady Usha
Vance.</p>
<p>Melania Trump wore a navy suit by New York-based designer Adam
Lippes, paired with a wide-brimmed hat by American designer, Eric
Javits.</p>
<p>Dressing the first lady was an honor, Javits said, adding that his
background in art has informed his ability to bring “harmony and balance
to the face” with his designs.</p>
<p>In Melania Trump’s case, he told the AP, the designing was not
difficult because the first lady is “blessed with great bone structure,
beauty and a wonderful sense of style.”</p>
<p>Also attending Monday’s service — which took place the same day that
the U.S. marks Martin Luther King Jr. Day — were members of the Trump
family, including his children Donald Jr., Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany and
Barron Trump. Individuals whom the president has nominated for key roles
in his administration also filled the pews, including Robert F. Kennedy
Jr., Pete Hegseth, Pam Bondi, Kash Patel and Marco Rubio.</p>
<p>Foreign dignitaries were also present. Leaders seen by the press pool
included President Javier Milei of Argentina, Prime Minister Giorgia
Meloni of Italy, and Britain’s former Conservative Party prime minister
Boris Johnson.</p>
<p>Some of the world’s richest individuals were also there, including
Elon Musk of Tesla, social media platform X, and SpaceX; Apple CEO Tim
Cook; and media tycoon Rupert Murdoch.</p>
<p>TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew attended the service, as did media
personality Tucker Carlson.</p>
<p>TikTok had briefly gone offline Saturday evening following a U.S.
Supreme Court ruling upholding a law ordering the Chinese social media
platform to sell to an American owner. Trump indicated he planned a
“joint venture” to allow TikTok to operate.</p>
<p>Service was restored on Sunday, with a message to users that said
that “as a result of President Trump’s efforts, TikTok is back in the
U.S.”</p>
<p>Trump’s former lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who earlier this month was held
in contempt of court twice over a defamation case stemming from Trump’s
failed 2020 election, was also spotted at the service.</p>
<p>Giuliani last Thursday settled the $148 million defamation judgment
granted to two election workers in the U.S. state of Georgia.</p>
<p>During Monday’s 25-minute church service, the choir sang “America the
Beautiful.” After the service concluded, Trump walked down the aisle,
greeting guests along the way. He was seen patting Milei of Argentina on
the shoulder.</p>
<p>Next, keeping with tradition, outgoing President Joe Biden and first
lady Dr. Jill Biden met with the incoming president and first lady at
the White House.</p>
<p>The First Families shared tea in the White House Blue Room before
departing together for the U.S. Capitol.</p>
<p>Because of extreme cold weather, the inauguration was held inside the
Capitol rotunda, with music from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln
Combined Choir and the U.S. Marine Band. Opera singer Christopher D.
Macchio sang “Oh, America!” and singer Carrie Underwood performed
“America the Beautiful” with the Armed Forces Chorus and U.S. Naval
Academy Glee Club.</p>
<p>Former Presidents George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama were
on hand for the inauguration, along with many members of the church
service congregation and the Trump family, as faith leaders offered
prayers.</p>
<p>Tech billionaires including Musk, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Meta’s Mark
Zuckerberg and Google CEO Sundar Pichai were spotted at the
inauguration, alongside the president’s supporters and U.S.
lawmakers.</p>
<p>Chief Justice John Roberts swore in the 47th president, on a Bible
held by Melania Trump. The president was flanked by his children.</p>
<p>Following the oath of office, a luncheon took place, followed by a
military troop review and parade.</p>
<p>As the ceremonial swearing in took place, new staffers at the White
House were seen moving into their new offices and unpacking images of
the president and first lady.</p>

It’s not just drill, baby, drill (for oil) — it’s mine, baby, mine.
Along with the shots at
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/wind-executive-order-trump" target="_self"><u>wind
energy</u></a> and the previous administration’s climate policy,
President Donald Trump’s blizzard of energy and environmental policy
announcements and executive orders on Monday included a boost to the
domestic mining and refining of critical minerals.
</p>
<p>
The directives outlined a strategy that would promote both the
extraction and, crucially, the processing of critical minerals in
America and would look skeptically at importing them — especially from
China.
</p>
<p>
Secretary of State Marco Rubio focused on Chinese mineral dominance as a
national security threat in his confirmation hearing earlier this
month,<a href="https://x.com/ErnestScheyder/status/1879580327456526419" target="_blank">
<u>telling the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that China has</u></a>
“come to dominate the critical mineral supplies throughout the world …
Even those who want to see more electric cars, no matter where you make
them, those batteries are almost entirely dependent on the ability of
the Chinese and the willingness of the Chinese Communist Party to
produce it and export it to you.”
</p>
<p>
<span></span>The German Marshall
Fund<a href="https://www.gmfus.org/news/chinas-role-critical-mineral-supply-chains" target="_blank">
<u>has estimated</u></a> that China makes up 60% of the supply of
critical minerals and 85% of the processing capacity. The United States
Geological Survey’s list of 50 critical minerals includes commonly used
metals like aluminum, as well as a number of metals and minerals crucial
for batteries and green energy technology like cobalt, lithium,
graphite, and manganese.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>While new reserves of lithium are constantly being
discovered, China dominates refining of the metal, with 60% market share
for refining battery-grade
lithium,<a href="https://www.spglobal.com/commodity-insights/en/news-research/latest-news/metals/092324-factbox-chinas-lithium-industry-eyes-output-cuts-to-shore-up-market-sentiment#:~:text=Globally%2C%20China%20ranks%20ninth%20in,bearing%20on%20the%20global%20market." target="_blank">
<u>according to S&amp;P.</u></a> And the Trump administration’s interest
in critical minerals may not be limited to the (current) boundaries of
the United States; it is also one reason why the president is so
interested in Greenland, which likely has
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-greenland-minerals-rare-earth" target="_self"><u>massive
stores of rare earth metals</u></a>, including uranium.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>In the executive order “Unleashing American Energy,”
President Trump called for agency heads and relevant Cabinet officials
to “identify all agency actions that impose undue burdens on the
domestic mining and processing of non-fuel minerals and undertake steps
to revise or rescind such actions,” along with specifically directing
the secretary of Energy and the secretary of the Interior to make
“efforts to accelerate the ongoing, detailed geologic mapping of the
United States,” and “ensure that critical mineral projects, including
the processing of critical minerals, receive consideration for Federal
support,” respectively.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>He also directed Cabinet officials not directly involved
with energy and resources policy to lend their weight to the American
critical mineral effort.The United States trade representative and
secretary of Commerce were tasked with looking at overseas critical
mineral projects to see if they’re “unlawful or unduly burden or
restrict United States commerce” and to examine “the national security
implications of the Nation’s mineral reliance and the potential for
trade action,” indicating that Trump
administration<a href="https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/Section%20301%20Modifications%20Determination%20FRN%20(Sept%2012%202024)%20(FINAL).pdf" target="_blank">
<u>may likely continue a version of the Biden administration’s tariffs
and restrictions on imports of Chinese critical minerals</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>Critical minerals also showed up in
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/declaring-a-national-energy-emergency/" target="_blank"><u>executive
orders</u></a> where President Trump
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/national-energy-emergency" target="_self"><u>declared
a “national energy emergency”</u></a> and an order specific to resource
exploitation in Alaska. In the emergency declaration, minerals were
included alongside energy as areas whose “identification, leasing,
development, production, transportation, refining, and generation
capacity of the United States are all far too inadequate to meet our
Nation’s needs.” In the Alaska order, “Unleashing Alaska’s Extraordinary
Resource Potential,” minerals were listed alongside “energy, timber, and
seafood,” as the “abundant and largely untapped supply of natural
resources” that the state possesses, even as the order was largely
specific to oil and gas projects like liquefied natural gas and oil
drilling.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>The Trump administration’s interest in critical minerals is
not unique. The Biden Administration also pursued a domestic critical
minerals policy,
including<a href="https://www.blm.gov/press-release/major-lithium-mine-approved-nevada-latest-effort-support-domestic-supply-critical" target="_blank">

<h2 id="trump-lays-out-vision-on-first-day-of-second-term-1">Trump lays
out vision on first day of second term</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>White House — On the historic first day of his second term in office,
President Donald Trump laid out his vision for a bolder — and larger —
United States.</p>
<p>“The United States will once again consider itself a growing nation,
one that increases our wealth, expands our territory, builds our cities,
raises our expectations, and carries our flag into new and beautiful
horizons,” he said in his inaugural address Monday. “And we will pursue
our manifest destiny into the stars, launching American astronauts to
plant the Stars and Stripes on the planet Mars.”</p>
<p>Then he got to work signing a stack of executive orders. He said they
included a declaration of a national emergency at the southern border
that would allow the deployment of troops, and a national energy
emergency that would allow more domestic oil and gas extraction. He also
declared that there are only two genders, male and female, and said he
would order that the Gulf of Mexico be renamed the Gulf of America.</p>
<p>Historians say that Trump made history on his second Day 1 by using
what is historically a unifying speech to portray a future that many
Americans may disagree with.</p>
<p>“Donald Trump did not do that. This was one of the most partisan
presidential inaugural speeches — it was less an inaugural speech and
more a State of the Union. He just listed a series of bullet points of
projects he wanted to undertake, from deporting immigrants to seizing
back the Panama Canal,” said Jeremi Suri, a history professor at the
University of Texas at Austin.</p>
<p>Shortly after his inaugural speech, Trump spoke to a smaller group of
supporters at the Capitol and reiterated claims that the 2020 election
was “totally rigged” — a claim without proof. He also pardoned some of
those convicted over the violent events of Jan. 6, 2021, when a mob of
Trump supporters attempted to disrupt the certification of the election
Trump lost.</p>
<p>“I think this was a better speech than the one I made upstairs, OK?”
Trump said.</p>
<p>Some of Trump’s powerful supporters expressed their joy.</p>
<p>Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk was among the billionaires who packed
into the Capitol for the ceremony and hailed Trump’s victory. After
Trump was sworn in, Musk took to the stage of the rally at Capital One
Arena to praise him.</p>
<p>“This was no ordinary victory,” he said. “This was a fork in the road
of human civilization.”</p>
<p>Consumer advocacy groups are sounding alarms about some of the new
president’s quieter moves, ones they say seek to loosen regulations and
benefit the extremely wealthy.</p>
<p>“When we think about why the incoming Trump administration wants to
freeze regulations and halt public protections wholesale, it is at the
behest of the wealthiest among us, corporate special interests,” said
Lisa Gilbert, co-president of the nonprofit consumer advocacy
organization Public Citizen. “They are who benefits when we don’t have
guardrails on the books.”</p>
<p>Trump did not, on Monday, directly address foreign policy concerns
such as Ukraine and competition with China — but Suri said his
expansionist rhetoric sent a message.</p>
<p>“It’s hard for the United States to tell [Russian President] Vladimir
Putin or [Chinese President] Xi Jinping that they should not seek
expansion when our president is talking about expansion, but insofar as
we don’t follow through on that rhetoric, we still are on very strong
ground to say that invading your neighbor, as Putin has in Ukraine, or
as China might potentially do in Taiwan, that is verboten, that crosses
the line, so long as it’s just words from us,” he said. “If we were to
go to war to try to seize the Panama Canal, that would certainly give a
kind of carte blanche to Putin and Xi Jinping, because they make the
same arguments for Ukraine and Taiwan.”</p>

former President Joe Biden’s
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/mar/20/biden-car-transportation-emission-regulation-pollution#:~:text=The%20rule%2C%20which%20calls%20for,Biden%20said%20in%20a%20statement." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>tailpipe

<a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-proposes-strongest-ever-pollution-standards-cars-and" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>aimed</u></a>
to “accelerate the ongoing transition to a clean vehicles future and
tackle the climate crisis.”
</p>
<p>
As part of his “Unleashing American Energy” executive order, signed
Monday night in the Oval Office, Trump specifically demanded the
elimination of “the electric vehicle mandate,” ordered a “level
regulatory playing field for consumer choice in vehicles,” and directed
the termination of “state emission waivers that function to limit sales
of gasoline-powered automobiles,” as well as the elimination of “unfair
subsidies … that favor EVs.”
</p>
<p>
Though the finer details of how this will be implemented aren’t clear in
the executive order, there has never been an actual electric vehicle
mandate. The rules under Biden’s Environmental Protection Agency would
have required a gradual reduction in fleetwide average carbon emissions
by up to 56% by 2032. To meet that goal, electric vehicles would have
needed to make up 35% to 56% of new car sales by 2032,
<a href="https://insideevs.com/news/747199/ev-top-10-sales-2024/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>up
from 8% in 2024</u></a>. According to the Biden administration, the rule
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-finalizes-strongest-ever-pollution-standards-cars-position" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>would
have cut</u></a> more than 7 billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions
through 2055, or “roughly equal to four times the emissions of the
entire transportation sector in 2021.”
</p>
<p>
Trump’s executive order also appeared to target the Biden
administration’s fuel economy standards. Back in June, the Department of
Transportation’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration issued a
rule that raised the fleetwide average fuel economy of passenger cars
for model years 2027 through 2031 by 2% each year — that is, to 47 miles
per gallon in 2026 and to 50.4 miles per gallon in 2031. (The current
average is around 39.1 miles per gallon.)
</p>
<p>
Republicans overwhelmingly opposed the rules, known as the Corporate
Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE Standards,
<a href="https://walberg.house.gov/media/in-the-news/fox-news-120-republicans-join-effort-opposing-bidens-de-facto-ev-mandate#:~:text=%E2%80%94%20penned%20a%20letter%20late%20Tuesday,U.S.%20energy%20and%20national%20security." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>arguing</u></a>
they “effectively mandate EVs while at the same time forcing the
internal combustion engine out of the market.” The GOP has insisted that
the CAFE Standards should be “market-driven” rather than “limit
availability of and access to vehicle and fuel options.” Project 2025,
the Heritage Foundation’s playbook for the Trump administration,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-change-project-2025#:~:text=Project%202025%20proposes%20a%20fleet%2Dwide%20average%20of%2035%20miles%20per%20gallon" target="_self"><u>called
for</u></a> a fuel efficiency standard of 35 mpg.
</p>
<p>
CAFE Standards have
<a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2025/01/13/cafe-standards-fuel-efficiency-donald-trump/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>long
been a political football</u></a> between administrations; Trump

<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/business/environment/trump-finalizes-rollback-of-obama-era-vehicle-fuel-efficiency-standards-idUSKBN21I25R/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>rolled
back</u></a> President Barack Obama’s standards, while Biden’s NHTSA
brought even stricter rules.
</p>
<p>
Monday’s executive order additionally appeared to target the EPA’s
waiver for California to set its own emissions standards under the Clean
Air Act in its language targeting “state emission waivers that function
to limit sales of gasoline-powered automobiles.” Trump previously
revoked California’s right to include greenhouse gases in its emissions
considerations and barred other states from adopting its criteria. Biden
reversed that decision in March 2022, on the grounds that the Trump
administration’s withdrawal was based on
<a href="https://www.bakerlaw.com/insights/regulating-automotive-emissions-part-i-what-to-expect-under-the-second-trump-administration/#:~:text=the%20decision%20to%20withdraw%20the%20waiver%20was%20based%20on%20a%20flawed%20interpretation%20of%20the%20Clean%20Air%20Act.%5B2%5D" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
flawed interpretation</u></a> of the Clean Air Act. Since then,
California released its Advanced Clean Cars II standard, which
<a href="https://www.atlasevhub.com/weekly-digest/12-states-have-formally-adopted-advanced-clean-cars-ii/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>11
other states</u></a> have adopted and requires

new cars sold by 2035</u></a> to be zero-emission.
</p>
<p>
It had been no secret that the California waiver would be
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-change-project-2025#:~:text=It%20will%20revoke%20the%20California%20Clean%20Air%20Act%20waiver%20(...again)" target="_self"><u>a
target of the incoming Trump administration</u></a>, despite the program
being
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/trump-tesla-california" target="_self"><u>a
secret profit center for Tesla</u></a> and supported by Elon Musk.
California has also quietly been working to Trump-proof its standards,
reaching an agreement recently with Stellantis (the parent automaker of
Chrysler, Jeep, Dodge, and Ram) to comply voluntarily with its
electrification mandates through 2030. (As my colleague Matthew Zeitlin
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/california-stellantis-trump-epa" target="_self"><u>has
noted</u></a>, the nationwide EPA rules for tailpipe emission reductions
“follow a different model than the California standards,” and are not an
electric vehicle mandate.)
</p>
<p>
By directing the EPA to revoke the California waiver, Trump has started
a process that could lead to the Supreme Court. Last month, the Justices
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/supreme-court-spares-california-auto-emissions-waiver-for-now/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>declined
to consider</u></a> whether or not California has the right to set its
own aggressive tailpipe standards, but if Trump indeed attempts to
rescind the waiver, it will
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/trump-plans-energy-dominance-executive-orders-after-inauguration-df86acd8" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>likely
face further legal challenges</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Taken together, the “Unleashing American Energy” executive order seems
designed to deliver on Trump’s frequent campaign attacks on EVs on the
2024 campaign trail, where he argued that “under Biden’s electric
vehicle mandate, 40% of all U.S. auto jobs will disappear.” Heatmap’s
own investigation found
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/evs-trump-uaw-jobs-evidence" target="_self"><u>little
evidence</u></a> to suggest that making electric vehicles will result in
fewer jobs. Trump’s tune on EVs had changed in recent months, however,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-ev-pivot-elon-musk" target="_self"><u>as
he grew closer to Tesla CEO Elon Musk</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
It’s true, also, that executive orders are not the automatic rule of
law; many of the policies will face time-consuming new rulemaking
processes or legal challenges. More clarity about what the “Unleashing
American Energy” order does precisely, and how it will be implemented,
will become clear in the weeks and months ahead.

<h2 id="trump-orders-end-to-all-wind-energy-permits">Trump Orders End to
All Wind Energy Permits</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-21, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTY5NjM5Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3MDM2OTI3Nn0.q06MCGpKPE5PQvbADzTSl6KQ7N7iKV4QkUhpwOcN6Pc/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
President Donald Trump has ordered the federal government to stop all
permits for wind energy projects.
</p>
<p>
Trump on Monday evening issued a sweeping executive order that the
government “shall not issue new or renewed approvals, rights of way,
permits, leases, or loans for onshore or offshore wind projects” pending
what the order describes as a “comprehensive assessment” of the
industry’s myriad impacts on the economy, environment and other factors.
</p>
<p>
This affects all offshore wind development in the U.S., because all of
that takes place in the Outer Continental Shelf, an ocean expanse under
federal control that is leased for all kinds of energy production.
</p>
<p>
It also impacts wind projects on federal lands. Although the extent of
the impact to onshore wind is unclear because some wind projects are on
state lands, project developers often must get approvals under federal
environmental and species protection laws, so an end to permits will be
quite painful for the sector.
</p>
<p>
The new order also withdrew all waters in the Outer Continental Shelf
from access to wind leasing and launched a new Interior Department
review of existing wind energy leases that will identify “any legal
basis” for termination or amendment based on “ecological, economic, and
environmental necessity.” This opens the door to offshore wind
developers potentially losing their leases.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, the order specifically bans wind energy development at the
site sought after for the Lava Ridge wind project in Idaho. Lava Ridge
<a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/hotspots/lava-ridge-wind-trump-executive-order" target="_self"><u>has
been contentious</u></a> because of its vicinity to a historic
internment camp where Japanese Americans were forced to live during
World War II. The project was fully permitted days before the end of
Biden’s term. But in spite of those approvals, critics of the project
close to the project insisted Trump would act on his own to kill it.
</p>
<p>
The order’s provisions are similar to a request we reported on last week
that
<a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/spotlight/offshore-wind-executive-order-trump" target="_blank">anti-offshore
wind advocates transmitted</a> to the Trump transition team, although
it’s clear the draft didn’t wind up in the final version.
</p>
<p>
In addition, the order asks for a separate study to assess the
“environmental impact and cost to surrounding communities of defunct and
idle windmills” to determine whether any wind turbines — which the order
calls “windmills” — should be removed. This study will be conducted by
the Interior Department, the Energy Department, and the Environmental
Protection Agency.

<h2
id="trumps-executive-orders-on-immigration-focus-on-border-security-asylum-restrictions-deportations">Trump’s
executive orders on immigration focus on border security, asylum
restrictions, deportations</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — On the first day of his second term, President Donald
Trump announced a series of executive actions addressing immigration and
border security.</p>
<p>Trump signed orders his officials called “common-sense immigration
policies.” These include declaring a national emergency at the U.S.
southern border, deploying armed forces, border wall construction,
ending asylum and ending birthright citizenship to some children born in
the U.S., among others.</p>
<p>During his inaugural address, Trump said, “We have a government that
has given unlimited funding to the defense of foreign borders, but
refuses to defend American borders or more importantly, its own
people.”</p>
<p>In a call with reporters earlier in the day, Trump officials outlined
the administration’s plans to tackle what it describes as a “national
security and public safety crisis” at the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>
<p>“President Trump was elected by a resounding mandate to carry out the
promises he made on the campaign trail, that includes his pledge to
secure the southern border and carry out the largest deportation of
migrant criminals in history,” an incoming White House official said,
speaking on background, a method often used by U.S. officials to remain
anonymous. Officials also emphasized the administration’s commitment to
implement what they call the largest deportation of migrant criminals in
U.S. history.</p>
<p>Here are some of the administration’s plans.</p>
<p>National emergency at the border</p>
<p>Trump said he will deploy the military to the U.S.-Mexico border,
including the National Guard, to assist existing law enforcement
officers. Officials emphasized that border security is national
security, and the administration is committed to securing the border
through use of the military.</p>
<p>“What this action does is it deploys armed forces [and] erects
physical barriers by directing [Department of Defense] and [Department
of Homeland Security] secretaries to finish the wall along the border. …
We’re going to reinstate the Remain in Mexico [policy],” the official
said.</p>
<p>Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior fellow at the American Immigration
Council, wrote on X that without Mexico’s permission, the promise to
bring back Remain in Mexico is “just words on a paper.”</p>
<p>The Remain in Mexico policy, created during the first Trump
administration, requires some asylum-seekers at the southern border to
wait in Mexico until their hearings in U.S. immigration court.</p>
<p>Juan Ramon de la Fuente, Mexico’s secretary of external relations,
said in a news conference Monday morning that if “they reinstate [Remain
in Mexico], this is something we don’t agree with. We have a different
focus. We want to adjust it. … The desire is to keep the same policies
as now.”</p>
<p>When asked about the number of troops expected to be deployed to the
border, Trump administration officials said that decision would
ultimately be made by the secretary of defense.</p>
<p>The administration is also rescinding the Biden administration border
policies by giving U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U.S.
Customs and Border Protection agents expanded enforcement authority and
establishing federal task forces to work with state and local law
enforcement in deportation efforts.</p>
<p>Mass deportations</p>
<p>Another announcement centers on undocumented immigrants across the
country. The Republican president repeatedly promised during his
campaign to carry out mass deportations, targeting at least 11 million
undocumented individuals.</p>
<p>In the press call with reporters, the Trump officials said the
administration will provide immigration officers with the necessary
“authorities” to enforce existing laws. In his campaign, Trump vowed to
eliminate President Joe Biden’s deportation priorities, which targeted
individuals with criminal records and those considered national security
threats, and instead to expand enforcement to include all undocumented
immigrants.</p>
<p>Stephen Yale-Loehr, a retired professor of immigration law at Cornell
Law School, wrote in an email to VOA that mass deportation efforts and
raids may get the most attention, but deportations will not increase
rapidly right away.</p>
<p>“If a person already has an outstanding order of deportation, they
can be deported immediately. But that is a relatively small number. Most
people picked up will be put into deportation proceedings in immigration
courts. Those courts already have a backlog of over 3.8 million cases.
Given that backlog, it will be years before many people will find out
whether they will be deported or allowed to stay based on asylum or some
other form of protection,” he wrote.</p>
<p>Release of migrants</p>
<p>The incoming administration also announced an end to the practice of
releasing migrants into the U.S. while they await their immigration
court hearings, commonly known as “catch-and-release.”</p>
<p>The Trump officials did not explain how they would handle an increase
in immigrant detention.</p>
<p>Refugee program</p>
<p>Trump is also ending the refugee resettlement program. During his
first administration, he progressively lowered the annual ceiling for
refugee admissions to a historic low of 15,000 for fiscal 2021.</p>
<p>Refugee advocates said at the time the reductions marked a departure
from the United States’ long-standing role in global refugee
resettlement.</p>
<p>Erol Kekic, senior vice president of programs at Church World
Service, wrote in an email to reporters that his group is urging
President Trump to reconsider. Church World Service is one of the nine
national refugee resettlement agencies authorized by the federal
government to assist refugees in starting new lives.  </p>
<p>“Even a brief pause in the program can have a devastating impact; on
those displaced by violence and persecution, families separated by
oceans and continents, and our communities who embrace the spirit of
welcome inherent to our great nation,” he wrote.</p>
<p>Ending asylum and CBP One app</p>
<p>One of Trump’s orders calls for the immediate deportation of migrants
who crossed the border illegally without a chance to plead their case to
an asylum officer.</p>
<p>Shortly after Trump’s inauguration, U.S. Customs and Border
Protection posted a notice on its website saying the agency was no
longer using the CBP One app, which had facilitated the legal entry of
nearly 1 million people into the United States with eligibility to
work.</p>
<p>The app allowed migrants to apply for an appointment to come to the
border and apply for humanitarian parole or other forms of legal
processing. The use of parole under the CBP One system was part of the
Biden administration’s broader efforts to manage migration flows and
provide legal pathways to entry, rather than having individuals cross
the border illegally.</p>
<p>However, parole granted through CBP One did not guarantee permanent
legal status; it typically allowed individuals to stay temporarily and,
in some cases, apply for work authorization while their immigration
status was being reviewed.</p>
<p>The notice by the CBP One app also confirmed that all existing
appointments had been canceled.</p>
<p>Birthright citizenship</p>
<p>Finally, Trump signed an order to eliminate birthright citizenship.
Birthright citizenship grants automatic U.S. citizenship to anyone born
on American soil, a right established by the 14th Amendment of the U.S.
Constitution.</p>
<p>The new administration’s actions are expected to face significant
legal and political challenges, with immigrant advocacy groups voicing
concerns over the implications of these policies.</p>
<p>The ACLU of Northern California, a nonprofit organization in the
United States dedicated to defending individual rights and liberties
guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution and laws, wrote in an email to the
press they “stand ready.”</p>
<p>“We are ready to do so again, from day one of the second Trump
administration. … We will defend immigrants’ rights to due process in
the face of mass deportations,” the email read.</p>

id="senate-confirms-rubio-as-secretary-of-state-trumps-first-cabinet-member">Senate
confirms Rubio as secretary of state, Trump’s first Cabinet member</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Senate quickly confirmed Marco Rubio as secretary of
state on Monday, voting unanimously to give President Donald Trump the
first member of his new Cabinet on Inauguration Day.</p>
<p>Rubio, a Republican senator from Florida, is among the least
controversial of Trump’s nominees, and the vote was a decisive 99-0.
Another pick, John Ratcliffe for CIA director, is also expected to have
a swift vote. Action on others, including former combat veteran and Fox
News host Pete Hegseth for defense secretary, is expected later in the
week.</p>
<p>“Marco Rubio is a very intelligent man with a remarkable
understanding of American foreign policy,” Senator Chuck Grassley, the
senior-most Republican, said as the chamber opened.</p>
<p>It’s often tradition for the Senate to convene immediately after the
ceremonial pomp of the inauguration to begin putting the new president’s
team in place, particularly the national security officials. During
Trump’s first term, the Senate swiftly confirmed his defense and
homeland security secretaries on his first day in office. Former
President Joe Biden’s choice for director of national intelligence was
confirmed on his own Inauguration Day.</p>
<p>With Trump’s return to the White House, and his Republican Party
controlling majorities in Congress, his outsider Cabinet choices are
more clearly falling into place, despite initial skepticism and
opposition from both sides of the aisle.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune moved quickly Monday, saying he
expected voting to begin “imminently” on Trump’s nominees.</p>
<p>Democrats have calculated it’s better for them to be seen as more
willing to work with Trump rather than simply mounting a blockade to his
nominees. They’re holding their opposition for some of his other picks
who have less support, including Tulsi Gabbard for director of national
intelligence and vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for health
secretary.</p>
<p>Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said his party would “neither
rubber-stamp nominees we feel are grossly unqualified, nor oppose
nominees that deserve serious consideration.”</p>
<p>Rubio, he said, is an example of “a qualified nominee we think should
be confirmed quickly.”</p>
<p>Senate committees have been holding lengthy confirmation hearings on
more than a dozen of the Cabinet nominees, with more to come this week.
And several panels were expected to meet late Monday to begin voting to
advance the nominees to the full Senate for confirmation.</p>
<p>The Senate Foreign Relations Committee advanced Rubio’s nomination
late Monday. The Senate Armed Services Committee and Senate Intelligence
Committee, respectively, advanced the nominations of Hegseth and
Ratcliffe.</p>
<p>Rubio, a well-liked senator and former Trump rival during the 2016
presidential race, has drawn closer to the president in recent years. He
appeared last week to answer questions before the Foreign Relations
Committee, where he has spent more than a decade as a member.</p>
<p>As secretary of state, Rubio would be the nation’s top diplomat and
the first Latino to hold the position. Born in Miami to Cuban
immigrants, he has long been involved in foreign affairs, particularly
in South America, and has emerged as a hawk on China’s rise.</p>
<p>During his confirmation hearing last week, Rubio warned of the
consequences of America’s “unbalanced relationship” with China. While he
echoes Trump’s anti-globalist rhetoric, Rubio is also seen as an
internationalist who understands the power of U.S. involvement on the
global stage.</p>
<p>Rubio will take over for outgoing Secretary of State Antony Blinken,
who has said he hopes the Trump administration continues Biden’s
policies in the Middle East to end the war in Gaza and to help Ukraine
counter Russian nomination.</p>
<p>The Senate is split 53-47, but the resignation of Vice President JD
Vance drops the GOP majority to 52 until his successor arrives.
Republicans need almost every party member in line to overcome
Democratic opposition to nominees.</p>
<p>Objection from any one senator, as is expected with Hegseth and
several other choices, would force the Senate into procedural steps that
would drag voting later into the week.</p>

id="biden-issues-preemptive-pardons-before-exiting-white-house">Biden
issues preemptive pardons before exiting White House</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden used his constitutional power
Monday to preemptively pardon several individuals, including some of his
relatives, just minutes before Donald Trump was sworn in as the 47th
president of the United States.</p>
<p>Without naming Trump or the incoming administration, Biden said in a
statement that he believes in the rule of law but warned about the
threat of partisan politics and pointed to possible retribution as the
main concern behind his decision to grant the preemptive pardons.</p>
<p>“I am optimistic that the strength of our legal institutions will
ultimately prevail over politics,” Biden’s statement read. “But these
are exceptional circumstances, and I cannot in good conscience do
nothing.”</p>
<p>Among those granted pardons is Trump’s former Joint Chiefs of Staff,
retired General Mark Milley. Political differences between Trump and
Milley that both men vented in public during Trump’s first term in
office led to Trump’s supporters branding Milley as disloyal. Milley has
reportedly referred to Trump as a “fascist.”</p>
<p>Citing “ongoing threats and intimidation for faithfully discharging
their duties,” Biden extended pardons to members and staff of the Select
Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States
Capitol. That includes former Republican Representative Liz Cheney.</p>
<p>Biden also preemptively pardoned the U.S. Capitol and Washington
police officers who testified before the committee.</p>
<p>“The Select Committee fulfilled this mission with integrity and a
commitment to discovering the truth,” Biden said. The statement
continued, “Rather than accept accountability, those who perpetrated the
January 6th attack have taken every opportunity to undermine and
intimidate those who participated in the Select Committee in an attempt
to rewrite history, erase the stain of January 6th for partisan gain,
and seek revenge, including by threatening criminal prosecutions.”</p>
<p>Biden also preemptively pardoned his former chief medical adviser,
Dr. Anthony Fauci, who retired in December 2023.</p>
<p>Fauci and his family have received threats from those who opposed his
approach to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the issuance of mask
mandates.</p>
<p>There’s a history of U.S. presidents pardoning family members for
specific criminal convictions. Biden pardoned his son Hunter Biden in
December for gun and tax offenses as well as for any offenses he may
have committed “from January 1, 2014, through December 1, 2024.” But on
Monday, Biden also pardoned other relatives who aren’t under
investigation, including his brother, James Biden; James Biden’s wife,
Sara Biden; his sister, Valerie Biden Owens; Valerie Owens’ husband,
John Owens; and his brother, Francis Biden.</p>
<p>“My family has been subjected to unrelenting attacks and threats,
motivated solely by a desire to hurt me — the worst kind of partisan
politics. Unfortunately, I have no reason to believe these attacks will
end,” Biden’s statement said. “The issuance of these pardons should not
be mistaken as an acknowledgment that they engaged in any wrongdoing,
nor should acceptance be misconstrued as an admission of guilt for any
offense.”</p>
<p>Biden’s preemptive pardons contradict the stance he publicly shared
on the matter on December 3, 2020, shortly before he took office. CNN
anchor Jake Tapper asked Biden’s opinion on Trump’s reported
consideration of a wave of preemptive pardons before exiting the White
House.</p>
<p>“Well, it concerns me in terms of what kind of precedent it sets and
how the rest of the world looks at us as a nation of laws and justice,”
Biden replied. He further underscored that his administration wouldn’t
approach pardons in that way.</p>
<p>Trump has himself promised to pardon many of his supporters who
attacked the Capitol on January 6, 2021. He has characterized those
arrested as “patriots” who were wrongly prosecuted.</p>
<p>Some information for this report came from The Associated Press and
Reuters.</p>

orders</u></a> in front of an arena full of supporters on Monday night,
with actions ranging from a regulatory freeze to requiring all federal
workers to return to the office full-time. While the full implications
of Trump’s Day One actions for energy and climate are still unfolding,
one of the most consequential executive orders so far —
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/initial-rescissions-of-harmful-executive-orders-and-actions/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
sweeping rollback</u> of 80</a> of former President Joe Biden’s
executive orders — quietly paved the way for the return of Schedule F,
which converts at least
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/how-trump-loyalists-could-make-the-president-even-more-powerful-607353cc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>50,000

<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/restoring-accountability-to-policy-influencing-positions-within-the-federal-workforce/" target="_blank"><u>formally
reinstated</u></a> Schedule F during a signing in the White House.
</p>
<p>
Trump first signed
<a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-creating-schedule-f-excepted-service/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>an
executive order</u></a> creating the new employment category in October
2020, though Biden reversed it shortly after taking office via Executive
Order 14003 — Protecting the Federal Workforce. While Trump didn’t have
much time to implement the policy last time around, he revoked Executive
Order 14003 in his omnibus executive order targeting Biden’s policies
just hours into his second shot at the presidency. The move cued up his
formal reinstatement of Schedule F Monday evening. “Most of those
bureaucrats are being fired,” Trump boasted during a speech at the
Capital One Arena in Washington, D.C., ahead of the signing on Monday
night. “They’re gone. Should be all of them but some sneak through; we
have to live with a couple, I guess.”
</p>
<p>
As I’ve written before, the reclassification is designed to “make it
easier to replace

or ‘woke’ civil servants</u></a> and would-be whistleblowers, a.k.a.
‘the deep state,’ with party-line faithful.” The Trump administration
has characterized it as giving him “full control of the government,”
with the Schedule F-specific Executive Order issued under the title
“Restoring Accountability to Policy-Influencing Positions Within the
Federal Workforce.” Russ Vought, Trump’s

the policy to give a “whole-of-government unwinding” to the “climate
fanaticism” of the Biden years.

The most concerning part of the Schedule F policy is the anticipated
loss of institutional knowledge. “What we’re going to end up with is an
executive branch that’s just uninformed,” Daniel Farber, the director of
the Center for Law, Energy, and the Environment at the University of
California, Berkeley, previously told me. Climate-related experts, in
particular, could face replacement by
“<a href="https://www.citizensforethics.org/news/analysis/faq-the-conservative-attack-on-the-merit-based-civil-service/" target="_blank"><u>spoils
system</u></a>” hires.
</p>
<p>
Democratic Senator Andy Kim of New Jersey drilled Vought on Schedule F
during the OMB nominee’s confirmation hearing last week, during which
Vought insisted the goal of the policy “was not to fire anyone” but
rather to ensure federal employees “do a good job or they may not be in
those positions for longer.” He additionally told Democratic Senator
Richard Blumenthal that he

id="dangerous-fire-weather-conditions-predicted-in-southern-california">‘Dangerous
fire weather conditions’ predicted in Southern California</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The National Weather Service (NWS) is predicting even more “dangerous
fire weather conditions” in Southern California, citing the area’s “low
humidity and the return of very strong winds” from Monday into
Tuesday.</p>
<p>“Take action now to prepare your home and loved ones for another
round of EXTREME WIND and FIRE WEATHER, starting tomorrow afternoon:
Worst winds Mon afternoon – Tue morning,” NWS Los Angeles posted on
social media platform X.</p>
<p>“Everyone needs to be on high alert,” Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass
said Monday.</p>
<p>Brice Bennett, spokesperson for the California Department of Forestry
and Fire Protection (Cal Fire), said in a statement Monday that his
agency — with help from federal, local and tribal firefighting agencies
— had more than 2,500 people and had prepositioned equipment for quick
deployment for any new outbreaks, following the NWS warning.</p>
<p>At least 27 people have died in the fires that have erupted across
Los Angeles, as battle-weary firefighters have struggled to bring the
blazes under control. The death toll is expected to rise.</p>
<p>The Palisades and Eaton fires together have destroyed 14,000
structures since they exploded January 7, during the fierce Santa Ana
winds. As of Monday, the Palisades fire was 59% contained and the Eaton
fire was 87% contained.</p>
<p>A critical-risk-of-fire-weather warning has been issued by the Storm
Prediction Center for Southern California with gusts expected to reach
up to 96 kph for lower elevations and 120 kph or more in higher
locations. The weather service said there is an extremely critical risk
in place for the ongoing fire locations in the San Gabriel and Santa
Monica mountains.</p>
<p>California Governor Gavin Newsom issued an executive order Monday
designed to protect Southern California residents from landslides and
flooding. The order suspends some rules and regulations and speeds up
the removal of debris that, if not removed promptly, could result in
landslides, mudslides and flash floods.</p>
<p>“This order helps keep our emergency response focused on protecting
communities, not permits and paperwork,” Newsom said.</p>
<p>Residents whose homes have somehow survived the fires are finding
they are not home free. According to The New York Times, people are
finding their homes still standing but filled with a slurry of smoke,
ash, chemicals and other contaminants.</p>
<p>“It smelled worse inside our house than outside,” resident Marcos
Barron, 53, told the Times. Another resident, Arlynn Page, said she
wanted to stay to rebuild in Altadena because she loves the community.
“But breathing this air? I don’t know,” she said.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
In a completely unsurprising redux of President Donald Trump’s first
term, the new/old U.S. president has
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/putting-america-first-in-international-environmental-agreements/" target="_blank">officially
notified the United Nations</a> of America’s intent to withdraw from the
Paris Agreement. According to the terms of the agreement, which went
into effect in 2016, it takes a full year for withdrawal to become
official. But Trump will almost certainly henceforth act as if the U.S.
is no longer bound by the treaty, which has been adopted by nearly every
other nation on Earth, in an effort to keep global warming “well below”
2 degrees Celsius.
</p>
<p>
“I’m immediately withdrawing from the unfair, one-sided Paris Climate
Accord rip-off,” Trump told the crowd at the Capital One Arena in
Washington, D.C., before signing a list of executive orders. “The United
States will not sabotage our own industries while China pollutes with
impunity,” he said. Trump has previously stated that he thinks it is
unfair that less developed nations such as China are not required to
peak their emissions for a number of years, while the U.S. is expected
to continue decreasing its own.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/all-about-ndcs?utm_source=chatgpt.com#:~:text=After%20the%20original%20NDCs%20in%202015%2C%20and%20the%20second%20round%20in%202020/2021%2C%20the%20next%20round%20of%20NDCs%20%E2%80%93%20%E2%80%9CNDCs%203.0%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%93%20are%20due%20in%20early%202025%20and%20will%20detail%20countries%27%20intended%20climate%20actions%20through%202035." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>This
year</u></a>, parties to the agreement are required to submit national
climate action plans — or “nationally determined contributions” in the
parlance of the treaty — to the United Nations, detailing how they’ll
further reduce emissions and adapt to global warming. These updated
plans are mandated every five years, though Trump failed to submit one
in 2020. The Biden administration
<a href="https://archive.ph/MIaeL" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>submitted
a plan</u></a> last month, in advance of Trump’s inauguration, which
includes a goal of cutting emissions by 61% to 66% below 2005 levels by
2035. It’s safe to assume Trump will not abide by this. Once it leaves
the Paris Agreement, the U.S. will also no longer have to submit yearly
emissions reports or provide as much money to developing countries for
climate change mitigation and adaptation.
</p>
<p>
So what will the fallout be? After all, America is the world’s second
largest emitter of greenhouse gases, behind China. But logistically and
legally, leaving the Paris Agreement is more symbolic than anything.
Beyond the more nebulous — but very real — loss of international
leadership on climate issues, there’s no tangible repercussions for
exiting the agreement. Nor, as many party nations consistently
demonstrate, any legal recourse for staying in while failing to meet
targets or set sufficient goals.
</p>
<p>
As
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-paris-agreement" target="_self"><u>I
reported in November</u></a>, so long as the U.S. retains its membership
in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the U.S.
can still attend the annual UN climate conference, a.k.a. COP, where all
negotiations and decisions related to the Paris Agreement happen. But
for all Paris-related meetings (which comprise much of the conference),
the U.S. would have to attend as an “observer” with no decision-making
power, the same category as lobbyists.
</p>
<p>
That’s actually never happened before. During Trump’s first term, the
U.S. technically could (and definitely did) continue to play a role in
negotiations. The Paris Agreement stipulated that no nation could
officially announce its exit for three years after implementation, and,
because it still took a year for withdrawal to become official, for
every COP during Trump 1.0, the U.S. remained a party to Paris. While
Trump’s COP delegations were smaller and less politically prominent than
either Obama’s or Biden’s, U.S. representatives continued to show up and
advocate for domestic interests. Since COP30 will happen in mid-November
of this year, COP31 in 2026 will be the first climate conference where
the U.S. will truly learn what it’s like to sit on the sidelines.
</p>
<p>
Making a more drastic break with the United Nation’s overall climate
efforts by leaving the UNFCCC, which convenes the annual climate
conference, is theoretically also an option. But leaving the framework
convention would likely be a much
<a href="https://www.climatechangenews.com/2024/11/04/legal-experts-say-trump-could-quit-paris-pact-but-leaving-unfccc-much-harder/#:~:text=UNFCCC%20case%20uncertain" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more
complex and arduous</u></a> process than leaving Paris. While Trump has
yet to make a statement indicating his intentions in this regard, the
Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 recommends it.
</p>
<p>
“We’re going to save over a trillion dollars by withdrawing from that
treaty,” Trump told the crowd regarding the Paris Agreement, before
returning to the Oval Office to sign a number of additional executive
orders. As my colleague
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-paris-agreement-fact-check?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_self"><u>Jeva
Lange explained</u></a>, the math behind that figure comes from a study
conducted by NERA Economic Consulting, which later released a statement
saying that the administration “selectively used results” from its
study, and that “NERA’s study was not a cost-benefit analysis of the
Paris Agreement, nor does it purport to be one.”

Energy Emergency Is Here</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-20, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
Donald Trump looked to further unleash American energy production as one
of the first actions of his new term, signing an executive order
declaring a
“<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/declaring-a-national-energy-emergency/" target="_blank">national
energy emergency</a>” among the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/wind-executive-order-trump" target="_blank">litany</a>
of
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/trump-ev-executive-order" target="_blank">other</a>
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/critical-minerals-trump-executive-order" target="_blank">actions</a>
and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-executive-order-schedule-f" target="_blank">declarations</a>
he made on
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-leaves-paris-agreement" target="_blank">Monday</a>.
</p>
<p>
Earlier, in his inaugural address, he boasted that the United States has
“the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on Earth, and we are
going to use it.”
</p>
<p>
“We will bring prices down, fill our strategic reserves up again, right
to the top, and export American energy all over the world,” Trump said.
</p>
<p>
The order describes an “active threat to the American people from high
energy prices,” as “hostile state and non-state foreign actors have
targeted our domestic energy infrastructure, weaponized our reliance on
foreign energy, and abused their ability to cause dramatic swings within
international commodity markets.” The order directs agency leaders to
“exercise any lawful emergency authorities available to them, as well as
all other lawful authorities they may possess” to facilitate U.S. energy
production, including — but not limited to — activities on federal
lands.
</p>
<p>
The Trump administration
<a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000194-849b-db01-a79f-94dbfaa00000" target="_blank"><u>had
earlier outlined its plans</u></a> in a document
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/01/president-trumps-america-first-priorities/" target="_blank"><u>posted
to the White House website</u></a> Monday morning, which promised
regulatory reform not only for “energy production and use,” but also for
“mining and processing of non-fuel minerals.”
</p>
<p>
The document said the purpose of the national energy emergency would be
to “use all necessary resources to build critical infrastructure.” In
remarks in the days before the inauguration, Trump described the goal of
declaring an energy emergency as enabling investors to more easily
“build big plants, AI plants,” and that the U.S. needs to “double the
energy that we already have — and it’s going to end up being more than
that.”
</p>
<p>
That could mean waiving environmental rules — including undoing the
Environmental Protection Agency’s power plant emissions rules — in order
to speed the building of power plants in order to power new data
centers.
</p>
<p>
While the exact parameters of these plans are still being drawn and will
probably require either months-long rulemaking processes or legislation
or both, by Monday morning, clean energy and environmental groups have
already started to weigh in.
</p>
<p>
“On his first day back in the White House, President Trump is trying to
turn back the clock on America’s clean energy leadership at the expense
of American people and their health,” Debbie Weyl, the acting United
States director of the World Resources Institute, said in a statement
following the president’s address to the nation. “If realized, President
Trump’s actions would sacrifice the United States’ competitiveness
globally, raise energy prices for American families, and pollute our
air. Pledging to roll back climate policies that have created more than
400,000 good-paying American jobs will only hurt workers and our
economy.”
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, at least portions of the clean energy industry are
seeing the bright side of Trump’s emphasis on energy maximalism.
</p>
<p>
“A promise to achieve greater energy abundance in America must include
leveraging the incredible, proven power of advanced energy technologies.
96% of all the new electricity added to America’s power grid in 2024 was
provided by advanced energy, the lowest-cost way to reliability meet
growing electricity demand,” Heather O’Neill, the president and chief
executive of the trade group Advanced Energy United, said in a similarly
timed statement.
</p>
<p>
“Our power grid faces real challenges, and at a moment when wildfires
and extreme temperatures threaten lives across the country, it’s clearer
than ever that we need to deepen our investments in advanced energy
solutions that increase resilience and lower costs. We urge the
Administration to embrace the market forces and tax cuts that are
empowering states to meet their energy needs and goals.”
</p>
<p>
When the White House published the text of the emergency declaration,
however, it became clear that Trump took a narrow view of what kinds of
energy might serve to mitigate the situation: “crude oil, natural gas,
lease condensates, natural gas liquids, refined petroleum products,
uranium, coal, biofuels, geothermal heat, the kinetic movement of
flowing water, and critical minerals.” No hydrogen, no solar, and no
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/wind-executive-order-trump" target="_blank">wind</a>.
</p>
<p>
While the newly inaugurated Trump administration has already taken a
dramatic rhetorical turn in how it treats the oil and gas industry
compared to Biden’s, it’s less clear that production can actually be
meaningfully increased. While the Biden administration was stingy in
opening up public lands for fossil fuel exploration — often doing
so<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/03/17/willow-project-alaska-oil-drilling-explained/" target="_blank">

and<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=63964" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
<u>gas production</u></a> hit record levels while Biden was in office.
</p>
<p>
Any Biden administration efforts to curtail fossil fuel production faced
legal and political pushback. In the first week of his presidency, Biden
issued a moratorium on new oil and gas leasing on public lands,
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/judge-doubles-down-blocking-biden-oil-gas-pause-13-states-2022-08-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>which
was quickly halted by a federal judge</u></a>. During the drafting of
the Inflation Reduction Act, Biden’s signature climate law, West
Virginia Senator Joe Manchin
<a href="https://www.energy.senate.gov/2023/10/manchin-urges-epa-to-reconsider-proposed-methane-rules" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>insisted
on oil and gas lease sales</u></a> as a condition of his support, and
then on opening up Willow, the oil project on Alaska’s North Slope, for
drilling by ConocoPhillips. At the same time, gas prices soared to over
$5 a gallon following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, leading the Biden
administration to use the Strategic Petroleum Reserve as a tool to bring
down oil prices, selling almost 200 million barrels.
</p>
<p>
The Strategic Petroleum Reserve
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&s=WCSSTUS1&f=W" target="_blank"><u>now
has just under 400 million barrels</u></a>, well short of its legal
limit of 714 million. Trump has promised to refill it, which would be a
boon to American domestic oil producers, although this would

id="trump-seeks-return-of-us-military-equipment-from-afghan-taliban">Trump
seeks return of US military equipment from Afghan Taliban</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Ayaz Gul  — President-elect Donald Trump says that future financial
assistance to Afghanistan will be contingent upon the return of U.S.
military equipment by the Taliban leaders currently in power. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Trump’s remarks at a Sunday rally in Washington on the eve of his
January 20 inauguration have heightened uncertainty regarding his
administration’s stance on the crisis-hit South Asian nation. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“They [Biden administration] gave billions of billions of dollars to
the Taliban. They gave our military equipment, a big chunk of it, to the
enemy,” Trump said. He referred to the tumultuous and hasty withdrawal
of U.S. troops from Afghanistan in August 2021, ordered by President Joe
Biden. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“If we’re going to pay billions of dollars a year, tell them we’re
not going to give them the money unless they give back our military
equipment. … So, we will give them a couple of bucks; we want the
military equipment back,” Trump stated without elaborating. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>A report issued by the U.S. Department of Defense in 2022 revealed
that approximately $7 billion worth of military equipment was left
behind in Afghanistan following the completion of the military
withdrawal. The equipment in question, which included aircraft,
air-to-ground munitions, military vehicles, weapons, communications
equipment, and other materials, was subsequently seized by the Taliban.
 </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The de facto Afghan rulers have since repeatedly displayed the U.S.
military gear in their so-called victory day celebrations over the past
three years. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The foreign troop exit stemmed from the February 2020 Doha Agreement
that the first Trump administration negotiated with the then-insurgent
Taliban. Biden completed and defended the military withdrawal, saying
the choice he had was either to follow through on that agreement or be
prepared to go back to fighting the Taliban. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Following the withdrawal, the Biden administration largely isolated
the Taliban and imposed new sanctions on the group. Washington, however,
has continued to be the largest donor to Afghanistan, a country that the
United Nations says is suffering through one of the severest
humanitarian crises in the world. U.S. officials have also engaged in
diplomatic efforts with the Taliban to negotiate the release of certain
U.S. detainees and assisted in relocating Afghan allies who had helped
American forces. </p>
<p>US gives cash for humanitarian aid </p>
<p>The billions of dollars that Trump repeatedly has referred to are
likely the cash shipments being channeled through the U.N. and
non-governmental organizations to support humanitarian programs in
Afghanistan. Washington remains the primary donor and has spent
approximately $3 billion in humanitarian aid since the U.S.
withdrawal.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thomas Ruttig from the independent Afghanistan Analysts Network
warned of challenges for the Taliban under the Trump administration. He
noted that some members of Congress and incoming administration
officials took part in the 20-year U.S. mission in Afghanistan and have
been highly critical of the Taliban. </p>
<p>Despite this, he stated that countering regional terrorism is a
significant concern in Washington, and it could potentially encourage
the Trump administration to seek cooperation with the Taliban to combat
terrorist organizations, including the Afghanistan-based affiliate of
the Islamic State terrorist organization known as IS-Khorasan.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ruttig said that Tim Burchett, Republican vice chair of the U.S.
Congress’s Foreign Affairs Committee, recently introduced a bill, the
“No Tax Dollars for Terrorists Act,” to ensure that U.S. tax money does
not end up in the hands of the Taliban.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan denies that cash shipments
for humanitarian programs are financing the Taliban. The mission says
the current setup – in which cash is physically brought to Afghanistan
and placed in designated U.N. accounts in a private bank – is in place
because of a ban on international banking transfers and ongoing
liquidity issues.</p>
<p>“All these funds are then distributed directly to the United Nations
entities, as well as to a small number of approved and vetted
humanitarian partners in Afghanistan,” according to the mission. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Taliban leaders have rejected Trump’s assertions that their
government received U.S. financial aid, stating that they do not expect
or seek any assistance from Washington. “Instead, it (U.S.) has
confiscated and frozen billions of dollars that rightfully belong to the
people of Afghanistan,” said a Taliban statement in response to Trump’s
remarks earlier this month. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ruttig warns that punitive measures and sanctions to pressure the
Taliban into submission might also provoke them to stop cooperation with
international stakeholders. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Today, the US-Taliban Doha Agreement is still considered valid and
obliges the Taliban to restrict ISKP and other groups from using their
shelter in Afghanistan to commit terrorist acts in the West. This could

comments.  </p>
<p>Taliban hopes for better relations </p>
<p>Masuda Sultan, an Afghan American advocate for women’s rights, is
doubtful the new Trump administration will substantially change its
stance on the Taliban. Instead, she expects the U.S. will cut aid
contributions to U.N.-funded programs like the World Food Program that
have supported the country’s most vulnerable. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>At the same time, Taliban leaders appear publicly optimistic about a
favorable shift in U.S. policy under the Trump presidency, attributing
this to their Doha pact with his previous Trump administration. Kabul
promptly welcomed Trump’s election victory just one day after he was
declared the winner of the United States presidential vote. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Taliban foreign ministry issued a formal statement expressing its
hope that “the incoming U.S. administration will adopt a pragmatic
approach to ensure tangible advancement in bilateral relations, allowing
both nations to open a new chapter of relations grounded in mutual
engagement.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Earlier this month, Taliban Deputy Foreign Minister Sher Mohammad
Abbas Stanikzai commended Trump as a “decisive” and “courageous” leader.
Stanikzai suggested that Trump reconsider Biden’s policy and adopt a new
approach. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“We want to build good relations with the international community and
the Western countries,” Stanikzai said in televised remarks in local
language. “An enemy doesn’t remain an enemy forever, and a friend
doesn’t remain a friend forever either,” he added.</p>

Weather forecasting service AccuWeather thinks this month’s devastating
wildfires in Los Angeles will trigger a mass migration out of
California. The fires capped off what AccuWeather said has been the most
“costly and impactful” year in terms of extreme weather events since the
Dust Bowl nearly a century ago. “The Dust Bowl led to a massive
migration west to California,” said AccuWeather founder and executive
chairman Dr. Joel N. Myers. “Ninety years later, we expect these
wildfires, the rising costs of rebuilding and recovery, the challenge of
securing and affording insurance, as well as drought and water supply
concerns will likely lead to a significant migration out of California
over the next few years.” Nine U.S. weather disasters over the last 12
months have caused between $693 billion and $800 billion in damage and
economic losses, with the preliminary cost of the LA fires estimated at

pardons Fauci and Milley in effort to guard against potential ‘revenge’
by Trump</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — President Joe Biden has pardoned Dr. Anthony Fauci,
retired Gen. Mark Milley and members of the House committee that
investigated the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, using the extraordinary
powers of his office in his final hours to guard against potential
“revenge” by the incoming Trump administration.</p>
<p>The decision by Biden comes after Donald Trump warned of an enemies
list filled with those who have crossed him politically or sought to
hold him accountable for his attempt to overturn his 2020 election loss
and his role in the storming of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Trump
has selected Cabinet nominees who backed his election lies and who have
pledged to punish those involved in efforts to investigate him.</p>
<p>“The issuance of these pardons should not be mistaken as an
acknowledgment that any individual engaged in any wrongdoing, nor should
acceptance be misconstrued as an admission of guilt for any offense,”
Biden said in a statement. “Our nation owes these public servants a debt
of gratitude for their tireless commitment to our country.”</p>
<p>It’s customary for a president to grant clemency at the end of his
term, but those acts of mercy are usually offered to everyday Americans
who have been convicted of crimes. But Biden has used the power in the
broadest and most untested way possible: to pardon those who have not
even been investigated yet. And with the acceptance comes a tacit
admission of guilt or wrongdoing, even though those who have been
pardoned have not been formally accused of any crimes.</p>
<p>“These are exceptional circumstances, and I cannot in good conscience
do nothing,” Biden said, adding that “Even when individuals have done
nothing wrong — and in fact have done the right thing — and will
ultimately be exonerated, the mere fact of being investigated or
prosecuted can irreparably damage reputations and finances.”</p>
<p>Fauci was director of the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health for nearly 40
years and was Biden’s chief medical adviser until his retirement in
2022. He helped coordinate the nation’s response to the COVID-19
pandemic and raised the ire of Trump during that time. He has become a
target of intense hatred and vitriol from people on the right, who blame
him for mask mandates and other policies they believe infringed on their
rights, even as tens of thousands of Americans were dying.</p>
<p>Mark Milley is the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and
called Trump a fascist and detailed Trump’s conduct around the deadly
Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection.</p>
<p>Biden is also extending pardons to members and staff of the Jan. 6
committee, including former Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, both
Republicans, as well as the U.S. Capitol and D.C. Metropolitan police
officers who testified before the committee.</p>
<p>Biden, an institutionalist, has promised a smooth transition to the
next administration, inviting Trump to the White House and saying that
the nation will be OK, even as he warned during his farewell address of
a growing oligarchy. He has spent years warning that Trump’s ascension
to the presidency again would be a threat to democracy. His decision to
break with political norms with the preemptive pardons was brought on by
those concerns.</p>
<p>Biden has set the presidential record for most individual pardons and
commutations issued; he announced on Friday he would commuting the
sentences of almost 2,500 people convicted of nonviolent drug offenses.
He previously announced he was commuting the sentences of 37 of the 40
people on federal death row, converting their punishments to life
imprisonment just weeks before Trump, an outspoken proponent of
expanding capital punishment, takes office. In his first term, Trump
presided over an unprecedented spate of executions, 13, in a protracted
timeline during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

restores US services after Trump promise to delay ban</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — TikTok restored services to users in the United States
on Sunday after briefly blocking access due to a U.S. law banning the
social media platform based on national security concerns. </p>
<p>The situation played out amid the change in U.S. administrations as
President-elect Donald Trump said he would seek to “extend the period of
time before the law’s prohibitions take effect.” </p>
<p>He also proposed, in a post on his Truth Social platform, for the
United States to take a 50% ownership stake in TikTok. </p>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday upheld legislation passed by
Congress that called for banning TikTok unless its China-based parent
company sold it by Sunday. </p>
<p>The Biden administration had said it would not seek to enforce the
ban in its final days in office, leaving the issue to Trump after he
took office on Monday. </p>
<p>TikTok credited Trump as it announced the restoration of its
services, saying Sunday on X that he provided “the necessary clarity and
assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties
providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7
million small businesses to thrive.” </p>
<p>Trump’s actions marked a reversal from his first term in office when
he sought to ban TikTok in connection with concerns that the service was
sharing the personal information of U.S. users with the Chinese
government. </p>
<p>At a briefing Monday in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesperson Mao Ning said China believes companies should “decide
independently” about their operations and agreements. </p>
<p>“TikTok has operated in the U.S. for many years and is deeply loved
by American users,” she said. “We hope that the U.S. can earnestly
listen to the voice of reason and provide an open, fair, just and
non-discriminatory business environment for firms operating there.” </p>

rights leaders, King family issue call to action as inauguration falls
on MLK Day</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — When President-elect Donald Trump is sworn in as
president of the United States inside the Capitol’s rotunda, he will do
so facing a bust of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. on the federal
holiday commemorating King’s legacy.</p>
<p>It’s a disquieting contrast for some civil rights advocates who wish
to fulfill the late reverend’s dream of non-violent social
revolution.</p>
<p>Events honoring King and advocating for his vision of a just society
will occur across the nation as many in the U.S. observe the peaceful
transfer of power in the capital. The concurrent events have been met
with mixed feelings by civil rights leaders, who broadly reviled Trump’s
rhetoric and stances on race and civil rights during his third
presidential campaign.</p>
<p>But many leaders, including King’s own family, see the juxtaposition
as a poignant contrast and a chance to refocus the work of advancing
civil rights in a new political era.</p>
<p>“I’m glad it occurred on that day because it gives the United States
of America and the world the contrast in pictures. Is this the way you
want to go — or is this the way you want to go?” said the Rev. Bernice
King, the late King’s youngest daughter and CEO of the King Center.</p>
<p>“It’s not a day that he can be the star, which he loves to be,”
King’s daughter said of Trump. “He has to contend with that legacy on
that day, regardless of how he manages it and handles it in his
presentation. I hope those around him are advising him well to honor the
day appropriately in his speech.”</p>
<p>This is the third time in the nearly 40 years since the federal King
holiday became law that it coincides with a presidential inauguration.
Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama also were sworn in for their
second terms on the holiday. Both praised King in their remarks; it is
yet to be seen if and how Trump — who falsely claimed his first
inauguration had larger crowds than King’s March on Washington — will
acknowledge the day.</p>
<p>“Will he sound a message of unity and a presidency for all, or will
he continue to focus on his base and some of the divisive policies he’s
championed, like an anti-DEI stance, rounding up immigrants and cutting
important parts of the social safety net through this DOGE (Department
of Government Efficiency) process?” asked Marc Morial, president of the
National Urban League civil rights group.</p>
<p>Morial added that Trump’s inauguration landing on MLK Day represented
“a contradiction of values.”</p>
<p>Many civil rights leaders will spend the day commemorating King’s
legacy after a week of public and private organizing, giving speeches
and strategizing how to respond to the incoming administration’s
agenda.</p>
<p>“It’s the best of times and the worst of times,” said Derrick
Johnson, president of the NAACP, an organization whose members mentored,
collaborated and clashed with King throughout the Civil Rights
Movement.</p>
<p>“Our mission doesn’t change. Our job is to make democracy work for
all, to make sure that equal protection is ensured under the law,”
Johnson said. He added that the group “doesn’t want to assume” the Trump
administration can’t be a partner on advancing civil rights or racial
justice.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Johnson and other civil rights leaders met with
Congressional Black Caucus members on Capitol Hill to discuss how to
work with and to oppose the Trump administration. That same day, the
National Action Network, a civil rights group founded by the Rev. Al
Sharpton, hosted a breakfast at which Vice President Kamala Harris urged
attendees to stay motivated.</p>
<p>“Ours is a journey,” she said. “Whatever the outcome of any
particular moment, we can never be defeated. Our spirit can never be
defeated, because when that happens, we won’t win.”</p>
<p>Martin Luther King III, the late King’s eldest son, prayed with
Harris on stage. King had campaigned for Harris in the fall and called
her an advocate who “speaks to our better angels” and “embodies
Dr. King’s legacy.”</p>
<p>Many racial justice advocates are set to organize demonstrations,
vigils and community service events to mark the holiday and prepare for
what they consider an adversarial administration.</p>
<p>Some groups are reflecting on parallels and differences with how King
organized in the face of explicitly white supremacist state and local
governments and geopolitical tumult.</p>
<p>“The hostility is similar, particularly in that there is a mobilized,
active and aggressive extremist-right hell bent on unraveling rights and
any sense of shared purpose, shared problems or shared solutions,” said
Maya Wiley, CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.
What differs, Wiley said, is the understanding “there has to be
opportunity for everyone.”</p>
<p>King himself worried the legal protections he dedicated his life to
realizing would not be followed by greater anti-discrimination efforts
or social programs. He proposed it would take white Americans embracing
a deeper kinship with Black Americans and engaging in economic and
social solidarity to see change.</p>
<p>A year before his 1968 assassination, King wrote in his final book
that giving a Black person their “due” often required “special
treatment.”</p>
<p>“I am aware of the fact that this has been a troublesome concept for
many liberals, since it conflicts with their traditional ideal of equal
opportunity and equal treatment of people according to their individual
merits,” King wrote in the 1967 book, “Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos
or Community.” “But this is a day which demands new thinking and the
reevaluation of old concepts.”</p>
<p>King’s advocacy for “new concepts” found an heir in the enactment of
affirmative action policies in workplaces and schools. Many advocates of
diversity, equity and inclusion policies see such programs as realizing
his vision, though that argument has come under withering scrutiny from
conservative activists.</p>
<p>Trump’s views on race have been criticized for decades. The federal
government sued Trump for allegedly discriminating against Black
apartment seekers in the 1970s. He was instrumental in promoting the
“birther” conspiracy theory that Obama was not born in the U.S. And his
campaign rhetoric about immigrants and urban communities since 2015 up
to November’s election has been derided as prejudiced.</p>
<p>As president, Trump enacted some criminal justice reform laws that
civil rights advocates praised but then proposed harsh crackdowns on
2020 racial reckoning protests.</p>
<p>In April, Trump did not dispute the notion that “anti-white racism”
now represents a greater problem in the U.S. than systemic racism
against Black Americans.</p>
<p>“I think there is a definite anti-white feeling in this country and
that can’t be allowed either,” Trump said during an interview with Time
magazine.</p>
<p>Janiyah Thomas, a spokesperson for the Trump transition, said Trump’s
inauguration would be “monumental, turning a new leaf and ushering in
the golden age of America” and said Americans should remember “wise
words” from King: “We must learn to live together as brothers or perish
together as fools.”</p>
<p>At the end of his life, King reflected on the early backlash to civil
rights, especially with integrated housing developments, interracial
marriage and necessary economic and social programs. He expressed
frustration with then-President Lyndon B. Johnson for prolonging the
Vietnam War rather than making a greater investment in anti-poverty
efforts.</p>
<p>“This is where the civil rights movement stands today. We will err
and falter as we climb the unfamiliar slopes of steep mountains, but
there is no alternative, well-trod, level path,” King wrote. “There will
be agonizing setbacks along with creative advances. Our consolation is
that no one can know the true taste of victory if he has never swallowed
defeat.”</p>

<h2 id="donald-trump-set-to-assume-us-presidency-again">Donald Trump set
to assume US presidency again</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Donald Trump returns to the U.S. presidency Monday with an
inauguration ceremony in Washington that will make him the first
president to serve non-consecutive terms since the 1890s.</p>
<p>Millions of Americans are expected to watch on television as the
78-year-old Trump takes the oath of office for a new four-year term in
the White House while President Joe Biden, 82, leaves the presidency
after a single term.  </p>
<p>The inauguration ceremony will be a scaled-down event due to frigid
weather, with about 600 people witnessing the change of power inside the
Capitol instead of the typical outdoor event where 250,000 people had
secured tickets.</p>
<p>The traditional inaugural parade along Pennsylvania Avenue from the
Capitol to the White House has also been canceled because of the
weather, with bands, marching units, drill teams and the like now
parading past Trump, his wife, Melania Trump and other officials in his
new administration at the nearby 20,000-seat Capital One Arena. Lavish
black-tie balls are still planned for Monday evening. </p>
<p>Trump pledged late Sunday to “act with historic speed and strength
and fix every single crisis facing our country,” as he spoke to
supporters in Washington.</p>
<p>“Tomorrow at noon, the curtain closes on four long years of American
decline, and we begin a brand new day of American strength and
prosperity,” Trump said.</p>
<p>He has pledged to sign a flurry of executive orders upon entering
office, including those undoing Biden administration policies. Prominent
among his pledges during the election campaign was carrying out mass
deportations of people who are in the country illegally.</p>
<p>Trump has also vowed to quickly impose heightened tariffs on key
trading partners, including Canada, China and Mexico.  </p>
<p>The incoming president says he plans to pardon many of the 1,500
supporters of his who stormed the Capitol building on Jan. 6, 2021, to
try to block Congress from certifying that Biden won the 2020 election.
Trump has called those arrested and convicted “patriots” and “hostages”
wrongly prosecuted. </p>
<p>Charges that Trump, a Republican, tried to illegally overturn his
2020 election loss to Biden were dropped when he defeated his Democratic
opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, in the 2024 election because of
a long-standing Justice Department policy against prosecuting sitting
presidents.   </p>
<p>Trump will become the first felon to serve as U.S. president, after
his conviction last year on 34 criminal charges linked to falsifying
business records to hide a $130,000 hush money payment to porn film star
Stormy Daniels, although a judge declined to penalize him in any
way. </p>
<p>Trump vowed for months to end Russia’s war on Ukraine before he takes
office, but in recent days his aides have said the goal now is to try to
reach a truce in the fighting in the first 100 days of his
administration, which would be around the end of April. </p>
<p>He also wants more oil drilling in the U.S. even though in 2023, U.S.
energy production exceeded consumption by a record amount, according to
the U.S. Energy Information Administration. </p>
<p>Two transgender issues have also drawn Trump’s attention.  </p>
<p>Trump has repeatedly referred to transgender women as men, telling
his supporters that he will ensure transgender women cannot compete in
women’s sports. </p>
<p>“I will keep men out of women’s sports, 100%, immediately, first
day,” Trump told one political rally during the campaign. He also
frequently has assailed gender-affirming care, which can include hormone
therapy. “On day one, I will revoke Joe Biden’s cruel policies on
so-called ‘gender affirming care.’”</p>

Korea braces for Trump’s policies with biggest-ever export finance
support</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korea pledged on Monday a record amount of
financing support for exporters to mitigate any negative impact from
changes in U.S. trade policies as Donald Trump was poised to be sworn in
for his second presidency.</p>
<p>The government plans to provide 360 trillion won, or $247.74 billion,
worth of policy financing to exporting companies through state-run banks
and institutions this year, according to a statement released by the
finance ministry.</p>
<p>“There are concerns that external uncertainty will be heightened
under the incoming U.S. administration and adversely affect exports,”
the ministry said.</p>
<p>The ministry said it would also boost insurance support to guard
against foreign exchange volatility to $966 million this year, from $827
million last year, and spending on government projects, such as trade
fairs and delegations, to $2 billion from $1.45 billion.</p>
<p>Sectors particularly under threat of new U.S. policies are
semiconductors and rechargeable batteries, the ministry said, whereas
defense, nuclear energy and shipbuilding sectors are seen as more
promising because of room for cooperation with the United States.</p>
<p>U.S. President-elect Trump, who takes office later on Monday, has
pledged to impose stiff tariffs on major trading partners, such as
Mexico, Canada and China, which are also expected to affect South Korean
companies running factories in those countries.</p>
<p>Economists say there are worries that the Trump administration will
introduce trade policies against South Korea too, after Asia’s
fourth-largest economy earned a record-high surplus of $55.7 billion in
trade with the U.S. in 2024, up 25.4% from 2023.</p>
<p>The Korea International Trade Association, South Korea’s biggest
group of exporting companies, projects export growth to slow to 1.8%
this year. Last year, South Korea’s exports rose 8.1% to a record high
of $683.7 billion, as sales to the U.S. rose 10.4%.</p>

<h2 id="the-state-of-the-economy-what-is-donald-trump-inheriting">The
state of the economy: What is Donald Trump inheriting?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Voters prioritized the economy in the 2024 election, sending Donald
Trump back to the White House. But what economic legacy is Joe Biden
passing on to the new administration? </p>
<p>“It’s the economy, stupid.” Coined by political strategist James
Carville, these famous words have become synonymous with U.S. election
success since 1992. </p>
<p>Despite the growing influence of issues like immigration, climate
change and foreign policy, many voters still prioritize economic factors
when casting their ballots. </p>
<p>President-elect Donald Trump claimed he made “the greatest economy in
U.S. history” during his first term and vows to do so again in 2025. But
a lot depends on what a president inherits from his predecessors. </p>
<p>Low unemployment rates and a soaring stock market built under former
President Barack Obama’s administration following the 2008 financial
crisis gave Trump a strong foundation the first time around. </p>
<p>So, what economic legacy will Trump inherit from Biden? </p>
<p>Simply put, high employment rates, strong GDP growth and low
inflation often characterize a healthy economy. </p>
<p>The country was still recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic when
Biden was sworn in, but the last four years have proven resilient. </p>
<p>Biden’s administration created almost 16 million new jobs in America
— a key sign of positive economic growth. </p>
<p>That good news was overshadowed for many Americans by inflation,
which reached a 40-year high in 2022, with prices increasing by 9.1%.
That impacted people’s purchasing power and made everyday items feel
expensive. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Annual inflation has now eased to around 3% but is still higher than
the Federal Reserve’s 2% target, and prices for many items remain
significantly higher than at the end of Trump’s first term.</p>
<p>While real wages have since increased in America, workers may still
feel the strain of stubbornly high grocery prices.</p>
<p>This was a global issue linked to supply chain challenges and
Russia’s war with Ukraine, and ordinary people paid the price. But
massive deficit spending under Biden to head off the threat of a major
recession also contributed.</p>
<p>Biden has preferred to emphasize the promising picture of the jobs
market he’s passing on, noting that the United States recorded its
lowest unemployment rate in more than half a century during his
term. </p>
<p>About 2.7 million jobs were lost during Trump’s first term, partially
due to the COVID-19 pandemic. So, he’ll face pressure to turn that
legacy around. But Trump has already suggested mass layoffs across
federal departments during his second term, which could increase
unemployment rates if implemented. </p>
<p>Another broad signal of a healthy economy is the increased value of
goods and services, or GDP, which shows whether an economy is
growing. </p>
<p>The United States has long had the largest GDP in the world,
surpassing nations such as India and China. </p>
<p>GDP rose 7.6% during Trump’s first administration and increased by
11.8% under Biden, suggesting a strong post-pandemic recovery. </p>
<p>Generally speaking, Biden’s economic legacy is one of high
employment, recovering GDP and declining inflation.</p>
<p>But no president ever inherits a clean slate. The federal debt stands
at $36.1 trillion, and public opinion about the economy is, at best,
lukewarm. </p>
<p>Some financial experts predict inflation may continue declining in
2025, but a broader context of geopolitical tensions, trade wars and
climate change may also shape America’s financial future. </p>
<p>Trump’s task will be to sustain economic momentum while navigating
the complexities of a rapidly evolving world.</p>

id="how-tiktok-grew-from-a-fun-app-for-teens-into-a-potential-national-security-threat">How
TikTok grew from a fun app for teens into a potential national security
threat</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SAN FRANCISCO — If it feels like TikTok has been around forever,
that’s probably because it has, at least if you’re measuring via
internet time. What’s now in question is whether it will be around much
longer and, if so, in what form?</p>
<p>Starting in 2017, when the Chinese social video app merged with its
competitor Musical.ly, TikTok has grown from a niche teen app into a
global trendsetter. While, of course, also emerging as a potential
national security threat, according to U.S. officials.</p>
<p>On April 24, President Joe Biden signed legislation requiring TikTok
parent ByteDance to sell to a U.S. owner within a year or to shut down.
TikTok and its China-based parent company, ByteDance, filed a lawsuit
against the U.S., claiming the security concerns were overblown and the
law should be struck down because it violates the First Amendment.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court on Friday unanimously upheld the federal law
banning TikTok, and the popular short form video service went dark in
the U.S. — just hours before the ban was set to begin.</p>
<p>Here’s how TikTok came to this juncture:</p>
<p>March 2012</p>
<p>ByteDance is founded in China by entrepreneur Zhang Yimin. Its first
hit product is Toutiao, a personalized news aggregator for Chinese
users.</p>
<p>July 2014</p>
<p>Startup Musical.ly, later known for an eponymous app used to post
short lipsyncing music videos, is founded in China by entrepreneur Alex
Zhu.</p>
<p>July 2015</p>
<p>Musical.ly hits #1 in the Apple App Store, following a design change
that made the company’s logo visible when users shared their videos.</p>
<p>2016</p>
<p>ByteDance launches Douyin, a video sharing app for Chinese users. Its
popularity inspires the company to spin off a version for foreign
audiences called TikTok.</p>
<p>November 2017</p>
<p>ByteDance acquires Musical.ly for $1 billion. Nine months later,
ByteDance merges it with TikTok.</p>
<p>Powered by an algorithm that encourages binge-watching, users begin
to share a wide variety of video on the app, including dance moves,
kitchen food preparation and various “challenges” to perform, record and
post acts that range from serious to satirical.</p>
<p>February 2019</p>
<p>Rapper Lil Nas X releases the country-trap song “Old Town Road” on
TikTok, where it goes viral and pushes the song to a record 17 weeks in
the #1 spot on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The phenomenon kicks off a
wave of TikTok videos from musical artists who suddenly see TikTok as a
critical way to reach fans.</p>
<p>TikTok settles federal charges of violating U.S. child-privacy laws
and agrees to pay a $5.7 million fine.</p>
<p>September 2019</p>
<p>The Washington Post reports that while images of Hong Kong democracy
protests and police crackdowns are common on most social media sites,
they are strangely absent on TikTok. The same story notes that TikTok
posts with the #trump2020 tag received more than 70 million views.</p>
<p>The company insists that TikTok content moderation, conducted in the
U.S., is not responsible and says the app is a place for entertainment,
not politics.</p>
<p>The Guardian reports on internal documents that reportedly detail how
TikTok instructs its moderators to delete or limit the reach of videos
touching on topics sensitive to China such as the 1989 Tiananmen Square
protests and subsequent massacre, Tibetan independence or the sanctioned
religious group Falun Gong.</p>
<p>October 2019</p>
<p>U.S. politicians begin to raise alarms about TikTok’s influence,
calling for a federal investigations of its Musical.ly acquisition and a
national security probe into TikTok and other Chinese-owned apps. That
investigation begins in November, according to news reports.</p>
<p>December 2019</p>
<p>The Pentagon recommends that all U.S. military personnel delete
TikTok from all phones, personal and government-issued. Some services
ban the app on military-owned phones. In January, the Pentagon bans the
app from all military phones.</p>
<p>TikTok becomes the second-most downloaded app in the world, according
to data from analytics firm SensorTower.</p>
<p>May 2020</p>
<p>Privacy groups file a complaint alleging TikTok is still violating
U.S. child-protection laws and flouting a 2019 settlement agreement. The
company “takes the issue of safely seriously” and continues to improve
safeguards, it says.</p>
<p>TikTok hires former Disney executive Kevin Mayer as its chief
executive officer in an apparent attempt to improve its U.S. relations.
Mayer resigns three months later.</p>
<p>July 2020</p>
<p>India bans TikTok and dozens of other Chinese apps in response to a
border clash with China.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump says he is considering banning TikTok as
retaliation for China’s alleged mishandling of the COVID-19
pandemic.</p>
<p>August 2020</p>
<p>Trump issues a sweeping but vague executive order banning American
companies from any “transaction” with ByteDance and its subsidiaries,
including TikTok. Several days later, he issues a second order demanding
that ByteDance divest itself of TikTok’s U.S. operations within 90
days.</p>
<p>Microsoft confirms it is exploring acquisition of TikTok. The deal
never materializes; neither does a similar overture from Oracle and
Walmart. TikTok, meanwhile, sues the Trump administration for alleged
violation of due process in its executive orders.</p>
<p>November 2020</p>
<p>Joe Biden is elected president. He doesn’t offer new policy on TikTok
and won’t take office until January, but Trump’s plans to force a sale
of TikTok start to unravel anyway. The Trump administration extends the
deadlines it had imposed on ByteDance and TikTok and eventually lets
them slide altogether.</p>
<p>February 2021</p>
<p>Newly sworn-in President Joe Biden postpones the legal cases
involving Trump’s plan to ban TikTok, effectively bringing them to a
halt.</p>
<p>September 2021</p>
<p>TikTok announces it has more than a billion monthly active users.</p>
<p>December 2021</p>
<p>A Wall Street Journal report finds TikTok algorithms can flood teens
with a torrent of harmful material such as videos recommending extreme
dieting, a form of eating disorder.</p>
<p>February 2022</p>
<p>TikTok announces new rules to deter the spread of harmful material
such as viral hoaxes and promotion of eating disorders.</p>
<p>April 2022</p>
<p>“The Unofficial Bridgerton Musical,” a project created by two fans of
the Netflix show as a TikTok project, wins the Grammy for Best Musical
Theater Album.</p>
<p>TikTok becomes the most downloaded app in the world, beating out
Instagram, according to SensorTower data.</p>
<p>June 2022</p>
<p>BuzzFeed reports that China-based ByteDance employees have repeatedly
accessed the nonpublic information of TikTok users, based on leaked
recordings from more than 80 internal TikTok meetings. TikTok responds
with a vague comment touting its commitment to security that doesn’t
directly address the BuzzFeed report.</p>
<p>TikTok also announces it has migrated its user data to U.S. servers
managed by the U.S. tech firm Oracle. But that doesn’t prevent fresh
alarm among U.S. officials about the risk of Chinese authorities
accessing U.S. user data.</p>
<p>December 2022</p>
<p>FBI Director Christopher Wray raises national security concerns about
TikTok, warning that Chinese officials could manipulate the app’s
recommendation algorithm for influence operations.</p>
<p>ByteDance also said it fired four employees who accessed data on
journalists from Buzzfeed News and The Financial Times while attempting
to track down leaks of confidential materials about the company.</p>
<p>February 2023</p>
<p>The White House gives federal agencies 30 days to ensure TikTok is
deleted from all government-issued mobile devices. Both the FBI and the
Federal Communications Commission warn that ByteDance could share TikTok
user data with China’s authoritarian government.</p>
<p>March 2023</p>
<p>Legislators grill TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew at a six-hour congressional
hearing where Chew, a native of Singapore, attempts to push back on
assertions that TikTok and ByteDance are tools of the Chinese
government.</p>
<p>January 2024</p>
<p>TikTok said it was restricting a tool some researchers use to analyze
popular videos on the platform.</p>
<p>March 2024</p>
<p>A bill to ban TikTok or force its sale to a U.S. company gathers
steam in Congress. TikTok brings dozens of its creators to Washington to
tell lawmakers to back off, while emphasizing changes the company has
made to protect user data. TikTok also annoys legislators by sending
notifications to users urging them to “speak up now” or risk seeing
TikTok banned; users then flood congressional offices with calls.</p>
<p>The House of Representatives passes the TikTok ban-or-sell bill.</p>
<p>April 2024</p>
<p>The Senate follows suit, sending the bill to President Biden, who
signs it.</p>
<p>May 2024</p>
<p>TikTok and its Chinese parent company ByteDance sue the U.S. federal
government to challenge a law that would force the sale of ByteDance’s
stake or face a ban, saying that the law is unconstitutional.</p>
<p>June 2024</p>
<p>Former President Donald Trump joins TikTok and begins posting
campaign-related content.</p>
<p>July 2024</p>
<p>Vice President Kamala Harris joins TikTok and also begins posting
campaign-related material.</p>
<p>Dec. 6, 2024</p>
<p>A federal appeals court panel unanimously upheld a law that could
lead to a ban on TikTok, handing a resounding defeat to the popular
social media platform as it fights for its survival in the U.S. The
panel of judges rebuffed the company’s challenge of the statute, which
it argued had ran afoul of the First Amendment.</p>
<p>Dec. 27, 2024</p>
<p>President-elect Donald Trump asked the Supreme Court to pause the
potential TikTok ban from going into effect until his administration can
pursue a “political resolution” to the issue.</p>
<p>Jan. 17, 2025</p>
<p>The Supreme Court unanimously upheld the federal law banning TikTok
beginning unless it’s sold by its China-based parent company, holding
that the risk to national security posed by its ties to China overcomes
concerns about limiting speech by the app. A ban is set to into effect
on Jan. 19, 2025.</p>
<p>Jan. 18, 2025</p>
<p>TikTok users in the United States were prevented from watching videos
on the popular social media platform just hours before a federal ban was
set to take effect.</p>
<p>“A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S.,” a message in the
app said. “Unfortunately, that means you can’t use TikTok for now.”</p>
<p>The company’s app was also removed from prominent app stores,
including the ones operated by Apple and Google, while its website told
users that the short-form video platform was no longer available.</p>
<p>Jan. 19, 2025</p>
<p>Shortly after the app went dark for U.S. users, Trump said he would
issue an executive order upon taking office to grant TikTok an extension
so that it could remain online.</p>
<p>A few hours later, TikTok restored service to users in the United
States, saying that Trump had provided “the necessary clarity and
assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties
providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans.”</p>

<h2 id="washington-braces-for-trump-inauguration">Washington braces for
Trump Inauguration</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Metal fences, concrete barriers and security checkpoints
still line many the walkways and cross streets of the National Mall –
extending from the U.S. Capitol down past some of Washington’s most
noted landmarks – as the nation prepares to swear in its 47th
president.</p>
<p>But while the 0.6-square-kilometer (146-acre) swath of land is often
the highlight of many a tourist visit, it is no longer the focus of
security efforts for when President-elect Donald Trump takes the oath of
office for a second time.</p>
<p>Frigid temperatures forecast for much of Monday led Trump to move the
festivities inside – the inauguration to the U.S. Capitol Rotunda and
the traditional inaugural parade to the nearby Capital One Arena.</p>
<p>The changes, first announced Friday, presented a last-minute hitch
for security and law enforcement officials, who had been planning for
the inauguration for the past year.</p>
<p>And it has left them, and the approximately 25,000 law enforcement
and military personnel charged with security, with multiple
challenges.</p>
<p>“We will shift those assets,” said the U.S. Secret Service’s Matt
McCool, briefing reporters Sunday.</p>
<p>“We have not cut anything from what our original plan was,” he said.
“I’m very confident, with our partners here, we will be ready.”</p>
<p>The numbers could make the situation especially trying.</p>
<p>Organizers had expected about 250,000 ticketed guests to descend on
the U.S. Capitol and the National Mall to watch the inauguration.</p>
<p>Only a select few will be allowed into the Capitol Rotunda, which
accommodates just 600 people. And the Capital One Area seats just
20,000.</p>
<p>If even just a fraction of the 250,000 people who had planned on
attending the inauguration try to get to the arena, there could be a
crunch.</p>
<p>Washington Metropolitan Police Chief Pamela Smith said Sunday her
force, bolstered by and about 4,000 police officers from across the
U.S., will be ready.</p>
<p>“Nothing has really changed,” Smith told reporters. “The police
officers that were committed and dedicated to coming here, we’ll be
flexible in how we’ll adjust [their] movement. … So, we will still have
police officers in places and spaces around our city as we initially
planned.”</p>
<p>Some of those officers, Smith said, will still be assigned to the
original parade route in anticipation that some people will try to get a
glimpse of the presidential motorcade as it goes by.</p>
<p>U.S. Capitol Police said they also anticipate having officers on the
periphery of the West Front of the Capitol – now closed off with the
inauguration moved indoors – ready to direct ticketed guests who will no
longer be able to attend.</p>
<p>In addition, the inaugural security contingent, which includes the
U.S. Secret Service, the FBI, U.S. Capitol Police, Washington
Metropolitan Police, and some 7,800 members of the U.S. Army and Air
National Guard, will all be coordinated from a command center linked
into an expanded network of cameras keeping watch on the city.</p>
<p>And though security measures in some areas, including along parts of
the National Mall, have been relaxed, officials said there will be
plenty of reminders for anyone coming to Washington that this is no
ordinary time.</p>
<p>“They will see tactical teams,” McCool said, during an earlier
briefing with reporters last week. “They’ll see, officers and agents on
rooftops, they’ll see checkpoints. They’ll see road closures and
barriers in concrete.”</p>
<p>Even before the inauguration was moved inside, officials had been
preparing for what they described as “a higher threat environment,”
cautioning the security plans for this inauguration were already more
robust than in the past.</p>
<p>“The biggest threat, I think, for all of us remains the lone actor,”
said Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger. “That threat … remains the biggest
justification for us being on this heightened stage state of alert.”</p>
<p>Those concerns were heightened following the New Year’s Day terror
attack and truck ramming in New Orleans and the Las Vegas Cybertruck
explosion outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas,
Nevada.</p>
<p>Earlier this month Capitol Police arrested two men suspected of
trying to disrupt the state funeral for former U.S. President Jimmy
Carter, one who tried to bring knives and a machete into the Capitol and
another who set their car on fire.</p>
<p>Research, including a recent survey by the University of Chicago
Project on Security and Threats, adds to the concerns.</p>
<p>“Over 5% of the American public supports the use of force to prevent
Donald Trump from becoming president,” Robert Pape, the project’s
director, told VOA.</p>
<p>“That equates to 14,000,000 American adults,” he said. “That’s an
unfortunately disturbing number.”</p>
<p>Already, Trump was also the target of two attempted
assassinations.</p>
<p>There is also an ongoing threat from Iran. Despite repeated Iranian
denials, U.S. security and law enforcement officials have accused Tehran
of trying to kill Trump, unveiling one plot set to be carried out last
year, in the days after the U.S. presidential election.</p>
<p>For now, though, U.S. officials see no signs of impending
trouble.</p>
<p>“The FBI is not currently tracking any credible or specific threats
to the inaugural ceremony or the Capitol complex,” the bureau’s
Washington Field Office told VOA. “We will continue to work closely with
our partners to share information and identify and disrupt any threats
that may emerge.”</p>
<p>Another source for concern is the tens of thousands of protesters,
though so far, there have been no major incidents.</p>
<p>Saturday’s People’s March, which was permitted to have as many as
50,000 protesters, sparked only brief tensions with Trump
supporters.</p>
<p>Another group, called We Fight Back, has permits for protests
involving about 10,000 people in across several locations on Monday.</p>
<p>“Please note that [we] will ensure your right to peacefully protest
and assemble,” said the Metropolitan Police Department’s Smith.</p>
<p>“However, I want to reiterate, as I always have, that violence,
destruction and unlawful behavior will not be tolerated,” she said.
“Offenders will face swift and decisive consequences … anyone who thinks
that they can come into this city to destroy property, we will be
prepared to deal with them.”</p>
<p>Kim Lewis contributed to this report.</p>

id="american-journalist-austin-tices-mother-in-damascus-hopes-to-find-missing-son">American
journalist Austin Tice’s mother, in Damascus, hopes to find missing
son</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Damascus, Syria — The mother of American journalist Austin Tice, who
was taken captive during a reporting trip to Syria in August 2012,
arrived in Damascus to step up the search for her son and said she hopes
she can take him home with her.  </p>
<p>Tice, who worked as a freelance reporter for The Washington Post and
McClatchy, was one of the first U.S. journalists to make it into Syria
after the outbreak of the civil war.</p>
<p>His mother, Debra Tice, drove into the Syrian capital from Lebanon
with Nizar Zakka, the head of Hostage Aid Worldwide, an organization
which is searching for Austin and believes he is still in Syria.</p>
<p>“It’d be lovely to put my arms around Austin while I’m here. It’d be
the best,” Debra Tice told Reuters in the Syrian capital Saturday, which
she last visited in 2015 to meet with Syrian authorities about her son,
before they stopped granting her visas.</p>
<p>The overthrow of Bashar al-Assad’s regime in December by Syrian
rebels has allowed her to visit again from her home in Texas.</p>
<p>“I feel very strongly that Austin’s here, and I think he knows I’m
here… I’m here,” she said.</p>
<p>Debra Tice and Zakka are hoping to meet with Syria’s new authorities,
including the head of its new administration Ahmed al-Sharaa, to push
for information about Austin. They are also optimistic that U.S.
President-elect Donald Trump, who will be inaugurated Monday, will take
up the cause.</p>
<p>“I am hoping to get some answers. And of course, you know, we have
[the] inauguration on Monday, and I think that should be a huge change,”
she said.</p>
<p>“I know that President Trump is quite a negotiator, so I have a lot
of confidence there. But now we have an unknown on this (Syrian) side.
It’s difficult to know, if those that are coming in even have the
information about him,” she said.</p>
<p>Her son, now 43, was taken captive in August 2012, while traveling
through the Damascus suburb of Daraya.</p>
<p>Reuters reported earlier that in 2013 Tice, a former Marine, managed
to slip out of his cell and was seen moving between houses in the
streets of Damascus’ upscale Mazzeh neighborhood. The New York Times
first reported that brief escape and recapture.</p>
<p>He was recaptured soon after his escape, likely by forces who
answered directly to Assad, current and former U.S. officials said.</p>
<p>Debra Tice came to Syria in 2012 and 2015 to meet with Syrian
authorities, who never confirmed that Tice was in their custody, both
she and Zakka said.</p>
<p>She criticized outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration,
saying they did not negotiate hard enough for her son’s release, even in
recent months.</p>
<p>“We certainly felt like President Biden was very well positioned to
do everything possible to bring Austin home, right? I mean, this was the
end of his career. This would be a wonderful thing for him to do. So, we
had an expectation. He pardoned his own son, right? So, where’s my
son?”</p>
<p>Debra Tice said her “mind was just spinning” as she drove across the
Lebanese border into Syria and teared up as she spoke about the tens of
thousands whose loved ones were held in Assad’s notorious prison system
and whose fate remains unknown.</p>
<p>“I have a lot in common with a lot of Syrian mothers and families,
and just thinking about how this is affecting them — do they have the
same hope that I do, that they’re going to open a door, that they’re
going to see their loved one?”</p>

id="trumps-inauguration-will-be-first-attended-by-foreign-leaders">Trump’s
inauguration will be first attended by foreign leaders</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>For the first time in U.S. history, a president-elect will welcome
foreign leaders for one of the most American political traditions — the
peaceful transfer of power.</p>
<p>President-elect Donald Trump invited Chinese President Xi Jinping and
conservative world leaders such as Argentine President Javier Milei and
Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni to the inauguration. Xi sent his vice
president as his representative.</p>
<p>No heads of state have previously made an official visit to the U.S.
for the inauguration. Some of them, such as Milei and Paraguay’s
President Santiago Peña, were special guests Saturday night at the
Hispanic Inaugural Ball, where several of Trump’s nominees for key
Cabinet positions made appearances. That included U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio,
chosen to lead the State Department, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., tapped
to head the Health and Human Services Department.</p>
<p>Here is a look at the foreign leaders who are coming to Washington
for the 60th inauguration:</p>
<p>China</p>
<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping was the first foreign leader whose
invitation to the inauguration became public in December. Xi will not
attend but is sending Vice President Han Zheng.</p>
<p>The announcement to dispatch Han was made Friday by the country’s
foreign ministry, and it comes as the rivalry between the U.S. and China
may escalate under Trump. Several of Trump’s Cabinet picks are known
China hawks, including Rubio, who has called China “the most potent,
dangerous and near-peer adversary this nation has ever confronted.”</p>
<p>Trump has vowed to impose tariffs and other measures on China. But
the two leaders spoke on the phone Friday and discussed trade, fentanyl
and TikTok. Trump said the call was a “very good one.”</p>
<p>Argentina</p>
<p>Milei was the first foreign leader to meet with Trump after the
Nov. 5 election, traveling from Buenos Aires to the president-elect’s
Mar-a-Lago club.</p>
<p>Milei is scheduled to attend one of the official inaugural balls that
Trump will attend on Inauguration Day, as well as the swearing-in
ceremony. The self-described “anarcho-capitalist,” who has carried out
an audacious economic agenda in the South American nation, got a hug
from Vivek Ramaswamy, a Trump insider, on stage at Hispanic ball before
delivering remarks.</p>
<p>Ramaswamy called him “an inspiration.” Milei also receives praise
frequently from billionaire Elon Musk for implementing a series of
austerity measures that laid off tens of thousands of government
workers, froze public infrastructure projects and imposed wage and
pension freezes below inflation.</p>
<p>Musk and Ramaswamy will lead a non-governmental effort to cut federal
government spending, regulations and personnel.</p>
<p>Milei hopes good relations with the U.S. could help Argentina reach a
new deal with the International Monetary Fund.</p>
<p>Italy</p>
<p>Meloni is another leader who has recently visited Mar-a-Lago. Her
weekly agenda says she will attend the swearing-in ceremony.</p>
<p>Meloni kept unexpectedly good relations with Democratic President Joe
Biden but is likely to form a more natural alliance with Trump. She is
considered a key interlocutor between Europe and the U.S.</p>
<p>Georgia</p>
<p>Pro-Western former Georgia President Salome Zourabichvili will attend
the ceremony as a guest of Republican U.S. Rep. Joe Wilson. Georgia has
been wracked by protests following a parliamentary election that
opposition groups alleged was rigged.</p>
<p>She has maintained she is still the legitimate leader of the former
Soviet republic after Mikheil Kavelashvili was inaugurated as president
late last month from a party that critics have accused of becoming
increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow. Kavelashvili’s
ruling party has denied those accusations.</p>
<p>Zourabichvili told Fox News that Georgia could be “the big success
for America or the big problem for America” in the region because
“Russia is always trying to dominate.”</p>
<p>France</p>
<p>French President Emmanuel Macron, who met with Trump last month in
Paris during the Notre Dame Cathedral reopening, won’t be at Trump’s
inauguration. But far-right figures from the country have said they are
traveling for the inauguration.</p>
<p>Eric Zemmour, a talk show pundit turned conservative politician, and
his partner, Sarah Knafo, a member of the European Parliament, said they
will attend. Zemmour was convicted multiple times of inciting racist or
religious hatred.</p>
<p>Prominent far-right politician Marion Maréchal said in a statement
that she would go as well. She is a member of the European Parliament
and niece of the leading conservative figure in France eyeing the 2027
presidential election.</p>
<p>Who else?</p>
<p>The offices of Ecuadorean President Daniel Noboa and Paraguayan
President Santiago Pena have said they were invited to the inauguration
and planned to attend.</p>
<p>Pena, a conservative economist turned politician, praised Trump’s
agenda and said at the Hispanic ball that he hoped for deeper ties
between U.S. and Latin America.</p>
<p>Taiwan sent legislative speaker Han Kuo-yu and seven others to
Washington for Trump’s inauguration, but Taiwan’s foreign ministry said
its delegates would not attend the ceremony now that it has been moved
indoors because of cold weather.</p>
<p>Taiwan’s official Central News Agency, citing Taiwan’s foreign
ministry, also reported that the delegates would meet American
politicians and think tank scholars to cement Taiwan-U.S. relations.
It’s unclear if they will meet Trump.</p>
<p>Trump has criticized Taiwan for pulling some of the semiconductor
industry from the U.S., but U.S.-Taiwan relations also significantly
improved during his first term.</p>
<p>On a phone call Friday between Trump and Xi, the Chinese president
urged the incoming U.S. leader to approach the Taiwan issue “with
prudence” because it is about China’s sovereignty and territorial
integrity. Beijing claims the self-governed island as Chinese territory
and vows to annex it by force if necessary.</p>

promises ‘brand new day,’ harsh immigration limits at pre-inauguration
victory rally</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Donald Trump told thousands of roaring supporters he
would impose severe limits on immigration on his first day in office,
vowing to swiftly fulfill the central promise of his presidential
campaign on Sunday at a rally inside a packed Washington arena a day
before he returns to power.</p>
<p>“By the time the sun sets tomorrow, the invasion of our country will
have come to a halt,” he said to cheers at a “Make America Great Again
Victory Rally” at the Capital One Arena.</p>
<p>Trump repeated his campaign pledge to launch the largest deportation
effort in U.S. history, which would remove millions of immigrants. An
operation of that scale, however, would likely take years and be hugely
costly.</p>
<p>The rally resembled the free-wheeling campaign speeches that have
been a Trump staple since his first White House run in 2016.</p>
<p>“This is the greatest political movement in American history, and 75
days ago, we achieved the most epic political victory our country has
ever seen,” he said. “Starting tomorrow, I will act with historic speed
of strength and fix every single crisis facing our country.”</p>
<p>The event marked his first major address in Washington since his
speech on Jan. 6, 2021, that preceded the storming of the U.S. Capitol
by an angry mob of his supporters. Trump has said he will pardon many of
the more than 1,500 people convicted or charged in connection with the
attack.</p>
<p>Trump said he would “get radical woke ideologies the hell out of our
military” and order the military to construct a missile defense shield
over the U.S., though he has yet to offer details on how to carry it
out.</p>
<p>He also promised to reverse the “over-classification” of government
documents, a seeming reference to his federal indictment for retaining
classified papers after leaving office. That case, along with a separate
federal indictment for plotting to overturn the 2020 election, was
dropped by the Justice Department after Trump won in November.</p>
<p>The indoor hockey and basketball venue will also host some of
Monday’s inauguration festivities after forecasts of bitter cold
prompted officials to move the planned outdoor events inside.</p>
<p>He also pledged to release classified documents relating to the
assassinations of President John F. Kennedy, his brother Robert Kennedy
and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.</p>
<p>Earlier on Sunday, Trump had breakfast with Republican U.S. senators
at Blair House, the guest quarters across from the White House. John
Cornyn, Susan Collins, Ted Cruz, Rick Scott and Tim Scott were among the
attendees seen leaving the event.</p>
<p>He later placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at
Arlington National Cemetery outside Washington. Trump saluted the tomb
as a military bugler played “Taps.”</p>
<p>Ahead of the event, Trump’s fans, many dressed in the campaign’s
trademark red jackets and MAGA hats, waited in a cold, driving rain
along several downtown Washington blocks, some chanting “USA! USA!”</p>
<p>Val Tordjman, 58, had traveled across the country from Denver with
tickets to watch the inauguration. When he heard the ceremony was being
moved inside, notably cutting the size of the in-person audience, he
said, “I felt like crying.”</p>
<p>Tordjman said he planned to spend the night on the street next to the
arena, despite temperatures forecast to plunge to around 19 degrees
Fahrenheit (-7 degrees Celsius). He said he had yet to see Trump in
person.</p>
<p>“This is a once in a lifetime opportunity,” he said.</p>
<p>Large swaths of the streets around the U.S. Capitol and White House
have been blocked off by steel fences since last week, and police were
visible throughout the city.</p>
<p>TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew planned to attend the rally, hours after the
company announced it was restoring its service thanks to Trump’s promise
to delay a U.S. ban that took effect on Sunday. Chew is also expected to
join other tech executives at Trump’s inauguration on Monday, including
the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, a close Trump confidant who made a
brief appearance on stage with Trump.</p>
<p>Trump took credit for bringing TikTok back online and said the U.S.
would do a “joint venture” to save the app alongside bidders to buy the
company.</p>
<p>The inauguration is scheduled for noon ET (1700 GMT) on Monday, when
Trump will take the presidential oath of office inside the rotunda of
the Capitol building, after the cold weather prompted organizers to move
the ceremony indoors. Approximately 25,000 law enforcement personnel
will be on hand to provide security.</p>

Los Angeles firefighters brace for ‘last’ dangerous winds</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Los Angeles — Exhausted Los Angeles firefighters braced Sunday for
the return of yet more dangerously strong gusts, as California’s
governor slammed “hurricane-force winds of misinformation” surrounding
blazes that have killed 27 people.  </p>
<p>The two largest fires, which have obliterated almost 16,000 hectares
(40,000 acres) and razed entire neighborhoods of the second biggest U.S.
city, were for the first time both more than half contained, officials
announced.</p>
<p>But the National Weather Service warned that powerful winds and low
humidity would again bring “dangerous high-end red flag fire weather
conditions” from Monday, with gusts up to 130 kilometers (80 miles) per
hour potentially returning.</p>
<p>“This is the last… we hope, of the extreme” wind events, said
Governor Gavin Newsom.</p>
<p>It will be “the fourth major wind event just in the last three months
— we only had two in the prior four years,” he told MSNBC’s “Inside with
Jen Psaki” show.</p>
<p>Officials were accused of being unprepared for the outbreak of fires
this month. Now, 135 fire engines and their crews are prepositioned to
tackle new outbreaks, along with helicopters and bulldozers, said
Newsom.</p>
<p>Firefighters, who since Jan. 7 have been battling flames, digging
trenches and uprooting vegetation to create perimeters around fires
non-stop, said the largest conflagration, the Palisades Fire, was 52%
contained.</p>
<p>That fire has killed at least 10 people.</p>
<p>Evacuation orders were lifted this weekend for dozens of
neighborhoods in upscale western Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Farther east, the Eaton Fire, which killed at least 17 in the
Altadena suburbs, is 81% contained.</p>
<p>More residents were able to return to their homes there too. Others
reunited with missing pets they had feared were dead.</p>
<p>Serena Null told AFP of her joy at finding her cat, Domino, after
having to leave him behind as flames devoured her family home in
Altadena.</p>
<p>The pair were reunited at NGO Pasadena Humane, where Domino —
suffering singed paws, a burnt nose and a high level of stress — was
taken after being rescued.</p>
<p>“I just was so relieved and just so happy that he was here,” a
tearful Null told AFP.   </p>
<p>No ‘magical spigot’  </p>
<p>As Los Angeles learns the true scale of the devastation, political
bickering has intensified.</p>
<p>Donald Trump, set to be sworn in Monday as U.S. president, has
sharply criticized California officials.</p>
<p>He falsely claimed that Newsom had blocked the diversion of “excess
rain and snow melt from the North.” Los Angeles’s water supplies are
mainly fed via aqueducts and canals originating from entirely separate
river basins farther east.</p>
<p>“What’s not helpful or beneficial… is these wild-eyed fantasies… that
somehow there’s a magical spigot in northern California that just can be
turned on, all of a sudden there will be rain or water flowing
everywhere,” said Newsom.</p>
<p>Citing conversations with firefighters on the ground during 100
mile-per-hour windstorms that first sparked the fires, Newsom added:
“There’s not a municipal system in the world that’s designed to address
a fire of that acuity.”  </p>
<p>The governor blamed Elon Musk — the Tesla and SpaceX owner poised to
play a key role advising the incoming administration — “and others” for
“hurricane-force winds of mis- and dis-information that can divide a
country on a myriad of issues.”</p>
<p>President-elect Trump said he hopes to visit the region soon,
“probably at the end of the week.”</p>
<p>Emergency officials Sunday continued to survey the damage, going
house-to-house with dogs in search of human remains, and ramping up the
daunting task of clearing endless tons of debris.</p>
<p>The region has experienced its driest start of the year since 1850,
according to Newsom. Well into its typical rainy season, Los Angeles has
had almost no rain since May.</p>
<p>Although rain is still not expected imminently, Newsom warned of the
need to prepare “for potential flooding in the next week or two,” as
rain, when it comes, pours down hillsides denuded by the fires.</p>
<p>“I prepositioned 2,500 National Guard. We’re going to start some
sandbagging operations,” he said.</p>
<p>“We’re dealing with extremes that we have never dealt with in the
past” due to the changing climate, said the governor.</p>

<h2 id="keke-palmers-one-of-them-days-mufasa-race-for-no.-1">Keke
Palmer’s ‘One of Them Days,’ ‘Mufasa’ race for No. 1</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Keke Palmer buddy comedy “One of Them Days” opened
in first place on the North American box office charts on a particularly
slow Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend. </p>
<p>The R-rated Sony release earned $11.6 million from 2,675 theaters,
according to studio estimates Sunday, beating Disney’s “Mufasa: The Lion
King” by a hair. By the end of Monday’s holiday, “Mufasa” will have the
edge, however. </p>
<p>“One of Them Days” cost only $14 million to produce, which it is
expected to earn by Monday. The very well-reviewed buddy comedy stars
Palmer and SZA as friends and roommates scrambling to get money for rent
before their landlord evicts them. Notably it’s the first Black
female-led theatrical comedy since “Girls Trip” came out in 2017 and it
currently carries a stellar 96% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. </p>
<p>But the marketplace was also quite weak overall. The total box office
for Friday, Saturday and Sunday will add up to less than $80 million,
according to data from Comscore, making it one of the worst Martin
Luther King Jr. holiday weekends since 1997. </p>
<p>“For an individual film like ‘One of Them Days’ this was a great
weekend,” said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for
Comscore. “You can still find success stories within what is overall a
low grossing weekend for movie theaters.” </p>
<p>The Walt Disney Co.’s “Mufasa” was close by in second place with
$11.5 million from the weekend, its fifth playing in theaters. Globally,
the Barry Jenkins-directed prequel has made $588 million. It even beat a
brand-new offering, the Blumhouse horror “Wolf Man,” which debuted in
third place with $10.6 million from 3,354 North American theaters. </p>
<p>Writer-director Leigh Whannell’s monster tale starring Christopher
Abbott and Julia Garner did not enter theaters with great reviews. It
currently carries a 53% on Rotten Tomatoes. Reviews don’t generally
affect the success of horror movies in their first weekend, but
audiences also gave it a lackluster C- CinemaScore in exit polls. The
Blumhouse production and Universal Pictures release cost a reported $25
million to make and is expected to reach $12 million by the close of
Monday’s holiday. </p>
<p>“Sonic the Hedgehog 3” was in fourth place with $8.6 million and “Den
of Thieves 2” rounded out the top five with $6.6 million. </p>
<p>In specialty releases, Brady Corbert’s 215-minute post-war epic “The
Brutalist” expanded to 388 screens where it made nearly $2 million over
the weekend. A24 reported that it sold out various 70mm and IMAX
showings. The studio also re-released its Colman Domingo drama “Sing
Sing” in theaters and prisons, where over 1 million incarcerated people
in 46 states were able to view the film. </p>
<p>The Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend has seen major successes
in the past. Dergarabedian noted “Bad Boys for Life,” which had a
three-day opening of $62.5 million in 2020, and “American Sniper,” which
earned $89.3 in its first weekend in wide release in 2016. </p>
<p>“This is a year that’s going to get a big boost starting with
‘Captain America: Brave New World’ and ‘Paddington in Peru’ in
February,” Dergarabedian said. </p>
<p>Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian
theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released
Monday. </p>

<h2 id="donald-trump-set-to-assume-us-presidency-again-1">Donald Trump
set to assume US presidency again</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A hallmark of the nearly 250-year American democracy is the
quadrennial peaceful transfer of presidential power, and it is set to
unfold again on Monday, with Donald Trump, the 45th president until he
lost his 2020 reelection bid, set to be inaugurated as the country’s
47th leader after winning last November’s election.</p>
<p>Millions of Americans are expected to watch on television as the
78-year-old Trump takes the oath of office for a new four-year term in
the White House while President Joe Biden, 82, leaves the presidency
after a single term.</p>
<p>But only about 600 people will see Trump sworn in live, with the
ceremony moved into the U.S. Capitol Rotunda at Trump’s behest. An
arrival Sunday night of an Arctic blast of frigid air into Washington
could push the temperature to -6 Celsius at noon on Monday, when the
traditional outdoor swearing-in ceremony would normally be held on the
steps of the Capitol overlooking the National Mall.</p>
<p>It is expected to be the coldest Inauguration Day in Washington in 40
years, when Ronald Reagan’s second inauguration was also moved inside in
1985.</p>
<p>About 250,000 tickets to Trump’s planned outdoor ceremony on the
Capitol steps had been handed out to his supporters and dignitaries but
inaugural officials said they now can simply keep the ducats as
commemorative souvenirs.</p>
<p>The traditional inaugural parade along Pennsylvania Avenue from the
Capitol to the White House has also been canceled because of the
weather, with bands, marching units, drill teams and the like now
parading past Trump, his wife, Melania Trump and other officials in his
new administration at the nearby 20,000-seat Capital One Arena, with
thousands of other celebrants literally left out in the cold. Lavish
black-tie balls are still planned for Monday evening.</p>
<p>Trump’s ascendancy to power again comes with some historical
footnotes: He will become the first felon to serve as U.S. president,
after his conviction last year on 34 criminal charges linked to
falsifying business records to hide a $130,000 hush money payment to
porn film star Stormy Daniels, although a judge declined to penalize him
in any way.</p>
<p>Charges that Trump, a Republican, tried to illegally overturn his
2020 election loss to Biden were dropped when he defeated his Democratic
opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, in the 2024 election because of
a long-standing Justice Department policy against prosecuting sitting
presidents.</p>
<p>Trump will also become the second U.S. president to serve a second
nonconsecutive term, after Grover Cleveland in the 1890s.</p>
<p>Beyond the pomp and circumstances of U.S. inaugurals, both Trump’s
supportive Republican colleagues and opposition Democrats will be
closely watching to see what policy changes he quickly announces with
executive orders to undo Biden edicts or simply to push forward with
planks from his winning campaign against Harris.</p>
<p>Trump’s Day 1 promises are wide-ranging, but whether he signs orders
affecting all of them or spreads out some of them to the coming days is
not certain.</p>
<p>Perhaps his most persistent claim from the campaign trail is that he
plans to deport more than 11 million undocumented migrants living in the
United States, starting with migrants who have been convicted of crimes
and then others who have been ordered to return to their home countries
after losing asylum bids to stay in the U.S.</p>
<p>But an apparent Trump plan to begin the immigration crackdown on
Tuesday in Chicago leaked to U.S. media outlets, leaving Trump’s
handpicked “border czar,” Tom Homan, to say that that the timing of the
deportation plan is now being reconsidered.</p>
<p>“We’re looking at this leak and will make a decision based on this
leak,” Homan told The Washington Post. “It’s unfortunate because anyone
leaking law enforcement operations puts officers at greater risk.”</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Homan said the Immigration and Customs Enforcement
agency “will start arresting public safety threats and national security
threats on day one. We’ll be arresting people across the country,
uninhibited by any prior (Biden) administration guidelines. Why Chicago
was mentioned specifically, I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“This is nationwide thing,” he said. “We’re not sweeping
neighborhoods. We have a targeted enforcement plan.”</p>
<p>Trump has also vowed to close the southwestern U.S. border with
Mexico and force would-be asylum-seekers to remain in Mexico while their
claims to stay in the U.S. are adjudicated.</p>
<p>All of his get-tough-on-migrant plans are sure to draw legal
challenges from advocates supporting those seeking a new life in the
U.S., possibly leaving Trump’s actions in limbo for extended periods,
weeks, maybe months.</p>
<p>Related to immigration, Trump says he wants to end birthright
citizenship for anyone born in the United States, although it is part of
the U.S. Constitution, so it is not clear how he plans to try to do that
unilaterally.</p>
<p>Trump has also vowed to quickly impose heightened tariffs on key
trading partners, including Canada, China and Mexico.</p>
<p>The incoming president says he plans to pardon many of the 1,500
supporters of his who stormed the Capitol building on Jan. 6, 2021, to
try to block Congress from certifying that Biden won the 2020 election.
Trump has called those arrested and convicted “patriots” and “hostages”
wrongly prosecuted.</p>
<p>It is not clear whether Trump will pardon only those convicted of
relatively minor offenses or include those convicted of attacking the
140 law enforcement officials who were injured in the mayhem four years
ago.</p>
<p>Trump vowed for months to end Russia’s war on Ukraine before he takes
office, but in recent days his aides have said the goal now is to try to
reach a truce in the fighting in the first 100 days of his
administration, which would be around the end of April.</p>
<p>Trump also wants more oil drilling in the U.S. even though in 2023,
U.S. energy production exceeded consumption by a record amount,
according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.</p>
<p>Two transgender issues have also drawn Trump’s attention.</p>
<p>Trump has repeatedly referred to transgender women as men, telling
his supporters that he will ensure transgender women cannot compete in
women’s sports.</p>
<p>“I will keep men out of women’s sports, 100%, immediately, first
day,” Trump told one political rally during the campaign. He also
frequently has assailed gender-affirming care, which can include hormone
therapy. “On day one, I will revoke Joe Biden’s cruel policies on
so-called ‘gender affirming care.’”</p>

snow, frigid Arctic blast put 70 million across US under winter storm
warnings</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Boston — Tens of millions of residents along the East Coast are
bracing for several centimeters of snow Sunday followed by dangerously
cold temperatures that will take hold in much of the country from the
Northern Plains to the tip of Maine.</p>
<p>Winter storm warnings issued by the National Weather Service have
already gone into effect for parts of the Mid-Atlantic through Monday
morning, with the forecast projecting up to 15 centimeters of snow.
Warnings will begin in New England on Sunday afternoon, with parts of
Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Maine and Connecticut seeing as much as 25
centimeters of snow.</p>
<p>Marc Chenard, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in
College Park, Maryland, projected that as many as 70 million residents
will be under some kind of winter storm hazards warning in the coming
days including in New England and the Mid-Atlantic. Large cities like
Philadelphia, New York and Boston could see several centimeters of snow
this evening with the highest totals being outside of major cities.</p>
<p>“There will certainly be some more hazardous road conditions anywhere
from D.C. up the whole I-95 corridor and then inland from there later
today and tonight,” Chenard said. “Then it gets quite cold behind that.
By Monday morning, any roads that haven’t been treated or cleared will
still likely be some hazardous travel conditions.”</p>
<p>Return of the Arctic blast</p>
<p>But the snow is just the start of a chaotic week of weather.</p>
<p>Much of the eastern half of the United States will be enduring some
of the coldest temperatures this winter, if not for several years.</p>
<p>An area from the Rockies into the Northern Plains will see colder
than normal temperatures starting Sunday into the coming week, with
temperatures dropping to minus 34 degrees C to minus 48 C on Sunday and
Monday. Wind chills of minus 40 C were already being clocked in parts of
North Dakota and Minnesota. Sub-zero wind chills are forecast to reach
as far south as Oklahoma and the Tennessee Valley.</p>
<p>The cold weather forecast for Monday for Washington, D.C., prompted
President-elect Donald Trump’s inaugural ceremony to be moved inside the
U.S. Capitol Rotunda.</p>
<p>“It’s going to be a cold day in Washington, D.C. on Monday. That’s
for sure,” Chenard said, noting temperatures will be in the 20s with
wind gust upwards of 48 kph.</p>
<p>As happened earlier this month, this latest cold snap comes from a
disruption in the polar vortex, the ring of cold air usually trapped
about the North Pole.</p>
<p>The cold air will moderate as it moves southward and eastward, but
the central and eastern U.S. will still be cold with highs in the teens
and 20s on Monday into Tuesday, Chenard said. The Mid-Atlantic and
Northeast also will have highs in the teens and 20s, lows in the single
digits and below minus 18 C and wind chills below zero.</p>
<p>Unusual wintry mix</p>
<p>The colder temperatures will reach down into the South early this
week, where as many as 30 million people starting Monday could see a
wintry mix of snow, sleet and freezing rain. The unusual conditions are
expected to stretch from Texas into northern Florida and the Carolinas.
Impacts are expected to start in Texas on Monday night and spread across
the Gulf Coast and Southeast on Tuesday into Wednesday.</p>
<p>A combination of frigid air with a low pressure system over the Gulf
is behind the storm, which could bring heavy snow just south of the
Interstate 20 corridor across northern Louisiana and into Mississippi
and a mix of snow, sleet, and freezing rain near the Interstate 10
corridor from Houston to Mobile, Alabama.</p>
<p>Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry on Saturday issued a state of emergency in
advance of the wintry weather. He encouraged Louisianans to be prepared
and to monitor the weather forecast.</p>

<h2 id="implementing-gaza-ceasefire-will-be-up-to-trump">Implementing
Gaza ceasefire will be up to Trump</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WHITE HOUSE — A ceasefire in Gaza began Sunday after Israel’s Cabinet
approved a deal, with 24 ministers voting in favor and eight ministers
rejecting the agreement. The deal was scheduled to be implemented
beginning Sunday. But on Saturday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said it would not start unless Hamas provided a list of the
three hostages set for release Sunday.</p>
<p>Hamas ultimately provided the names and Israel said the ceasefire
would begin at 11:15 a.m.</p>
<p>The deal to end the fighting between Israel and Hamas was achieved
after more than a year of negotiations, with mediation from the United
States, Qatar and Egypt. U.S. President Joe Biden first endorsed the
deal in May. The warring parties agreed to it on Wednesday, and it was
subsequently approved by the Israeli Cabinet early Saturday in
Israel.</p>
<p>Starting midday on Monday when President-elect Donald Trump is
inaugurated, it will be up to his administration to see that the deal is
enforced.</p>
<p>The agreement has three phases, each of which will last six weeks.
The terms of phases two and three are still being negotiated, but under
phase one the cessation of hostilities is expected to continue if six
weeks pass before the next phase is finalized.</p>
<p>Phase one includes withdrawal of Israeli forces from densely
populated areas and more aid for Gaza, as well as the release of some
Palestinians detained in Israeli prisons and some hostages held by
Hamas, including Americans. The U.S. and other Western countries have
designated Hamas as a terrorist group.</p>
<p>The release of American hostages is a “fundamental component” of
Trump’s interest in ending the war swiftly, according to Ahmed Fouad
Alkhatib, resident senior fellow with the Scowcroft Middle East Security
Initiative at the Atlantic Council’s Middle East Programs.</p>
<p>Whether Trump will sustain pressure for the deal to proceed to phase
two, when all of the hostages are set to be released, and to phase
three, when reconstruction of Gaza will begin, remains to be seen,
Alkhatib told VOA.</p>
<p>Alkhatib expressed concern that after the first phase Trump will be
“so disinterested” in Gaza that the agreement will amount to “little
more than a freezing of the conflict.” This would be disastrous for
Palestinians in Gaza and the goal of Palestinian statehood, he
added.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said late Friday that he
had received “unequivocal guarantees” from Biden and Trump that if
negotiations on phase two fail, Israel “will return to intense fighting
with the backing of the United States.”</p>
<p>Hamas militants killed about 1,200 people and captured about 250
hostages in their Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel that sparked the
current war. Israel says Hamas is still holding 101 hostages, including
35 the military says are dead.</p>
<p>Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 46,000
Palestinians, according to the territory’s Health Ministry, which does
not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count.</p>
<p>Two-state solution</p>
<p>The Biden administration’s goal has been Palestinian statehood under
the two-state solution. This could pave the way to bringing Saudi Arabia
into the Abraham Accords — the 2020 deal brokered under the first Trump
administration that normalized diplomatic relations between Israel and
its Arab neighbors, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain.</p>
<p>Biden had sought to expand the accords to include Saudi Arabia, which
maintains it will not consider normalizing relations until Israel
commits to a “credible path” to a Palestinian state. Washington and
Riyadh had been exploring the expansion through a package that would
include, among other offers, American security guarantees for the
Saudis. Those efforts stalled after the Oct. 7 Hamas onslaught.</p>
<p>Now Trump appears to be aiming to use the momentum of the Gaza
ceasefire to add Saudi Arabia into the accords.</p>
<p>“We will continue promoting PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH throughout the
region, as we build upon the momentum of this ceasefire to further
expand the Historic Abraham Accords,” Trump posted on social media
Wednesday following the announcement that a ceasefire deal has been
reached.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia has never formally recognized Israel since its creation
in 1948. As a de facto leader of the Arab and Islamic world, Riyadh’s
recognition would represent a breakthrough for the Jewish state.</p>
<p>Trump’s main objective now is to ensure that whatever happens in Gaza
does not prevent him from securing that deal, while Israel’s goal is to
ensure whatever happens in Gaza doesn’t prevent cooperation with the
U.S. over Iran, said Jonathan Rynhold, head of the department of
political studies at Bar Ilan University.</p>
<p>“So, I’m not sure that it makes sense to think beyond the first phase
at this point,” Rynhold told VOA.</p>
<p>Trump and Israel will “work out their positions on Gaza precisely
against the shadow of those two things,” he added.</p>
<p>Trump’s role in securing the deal</p>
<p>In the same social media post Wednesday, Trump took credit for his
role in securing the ceasefire.</p>
<p>“This EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result
of our Historic Victory in November, as it signaled to the entire World
that my Administration would seek Peace and negotiate deals to ensure
the safety of all Americans, and our Allies,” Trump wrote.</p>
<p>For months the Biden administration has progressively included
Trump’s team in peace talks, beginning with an Oval Office meeting a
week after Trump won the election. At that Nov. 13 meeting, Biden
proposed that they work together to push the deal through.</p>
<p>“We’ve sent a signal to the incoming team that we’re prepared to work
with them on this issue,” national security adviser Jake Sullivan told
reporters that day.</p>
<p>Shortly after, Sullivan and Biden’s top Middle East adviser, Brett
McGurk, began coordinating with their successors on the Trump team, Mike
Waltz and Steve Witkoff, said a senior administration official who spoke
with reporters on background Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Biden official said that in the final days leading up to the
ceasefire, Witkoff worked in tandem with McGurk in an “almost
unprecedented,” cross-administration partnership that was “highly
constructive, very fruitful.” But he declined to elaborate on Witkoff’s
and Trump’s role in securing the deal, other than saying that the
presidential transition provided a “natural” deadline for a diplomatic
breakthrough.</p>
<p>Pressure on Israel</p>
<p>Critics have accused Biden of failing to use U.S. military support as
leverage over Netanyahu to reach a deal or moderate Israel’s campaign,
which has taken tens of thousands of Palestinian lives.</p>
<p>Publicly, Biden officials have largely echoed Israel in faulting
Hamas for the failure of the talks. But some Israeli security officials
and many observers also blame Netanyahu for blocking progress, including
by repeatedly introducing fresh demands in negotiations.</p>
<p>With Trump’s victory, Netanyahu’s calculations may have changed, said
Laura Blumenfeld, senior fellow at the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced
International Studies.</p>
<p>“Trump injected a kind of fear factor into this process that was
missing before,” she told VOA. “He can’t triangulate anymore the way he
would play Biden off of the Republican Congress. There’s nowhere for
Netanyahu to run, nowhere to hide, and so he took this deal he couldn’t
refuse.”</p>
<p>Trump’s pressure may have also created space for Netanyahu to resist
ultimatums from far-right allies who had threatened to leave his
governing coalition if a ceasefire deal is made, which would mean an end
to the prime minister’s term.</p>
<p>Eight Israeli far-right politicians, including National Security
Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, rejected
the deal, but it is still unclear whether they will leave the
coalition.</p>
<p>“Netanyahu finally called their bluff,” Blumenfeld said. “Or maybe
actually, Trump called Netanyahu’s bluff, because he was using these
right-wing Cabinet members all along as an excuse not to make the
concessions that he didn’t want to make.”</p>

id="biden-posthumously-pardons-black-nationalist-marcus-garvey">Biden
posthumously pardons Black nationalist Marcus Garvey</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — President Joe Biden on Sunday posthumously pardoned
Black nationalist Marcus Garvey, who influenced Malcolm X and other
civil rights leaders and was convicted of mail fraud in the 1920s. Also
receiving pardons were a top Virginia lawmaker and advocates for
immigrant rights, criminal justice reform and gun violence
prevention. </p>
<p>Congressional leaders had pushed for Biden to pardon Garvey, with
supporters arguing that Garvey’s conviction was politically motivated
and an effort to silence the increasingly popular leader who spoke of
racial pride. After Garvey was convicted, he was deported to Jamaica,
where he was born. He died in 1940. </p>
<p>The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. said of Garvey: “He was the first
man, on a mass scale and level” to give millions of Black people “a
sense of dignity and destiny.” </p>
<p>It’s not clear whether Biden, who leaves office Monday, will pardon
people who have been criticized or threatened by President-elect Donald
Trump. </p>
<p>Issuing preemptive pardons — for actual or imagined offenses by
Trump’s critics that could be investigated or prosecuted by the incoming
administration — would stretch the powers of the presidency in untested
ways. </p>
<p>Biden has set the presidential record for most individual pardons and
commutations issued. He announced on Friday that he was commuting the
sentences of almost 2,500 people convicted of nonviolent drug offenses.
He also gave a broad pardon for his son Hunter, who was prosecuted for
gun and tax crimes. </p>
<p>The president has announced he was commuting the sentences of 37 of
the 40 people on federal death row, converting their punishments to life
imprisonment just as Trump, an outspoken proponent of expanding capital
punishment, takes office. In his first term, Trump presided over an
unprecedented number of executions, 13, in a protracted timeline during
the coronavirus pandemic. </p>
<p>A pardon relieves a person of guilt and punishment. A commutation
reduces or eliminates the punishment but doesn’t exonerate the
wrongdoing. </p>
<p>Among those pardoned on Sunday were: </p>
<p>— Don Scott, who is the speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates in
a chamber narrowly controlled by Democrats. He was convicted of a drug
offense in 1994 and served eight years in prison. He was elected to the
Virginia legislature in 2019, and later became the first Black
speaker. </p>
<p>“I am deeply humbled to share that I have received a Presidential
Pardon from President Joe Biden for a mistake I made in 1994 — one that
changed the course of my life and taught me the true power of
redemption,” Scott said in a statement. </p>
<p>—Immigrant rights activist Ravi Ragbir, who was convicted of a
nonviolent offence in 2001 and was sentenced to two years in prison and
was facing deportation to Trinidad and Tobago. </p>
<p>—Kemba Smith Pradia, who was convicted of a drug offense in 1994 and
sentenced to 24 years behind bars. She has since become a prison reform
activist. President Bill Clinton commuted her sentence in 2000. </p>
<p>—Darryl Chambers of Wilmington, Delaware, a gun violence prevention
advocate who was convicted of a drug offense and sentenced to 17 years
in prison. He studies and writes about gun violence prevention. </p>
<p>Biden commuted the sentences of two people: </p>
<p>—Michelle West, who was serving life in prison for her role in a drug
conspiracy case in the early 1990s. West has a daughter who has written
publicly about the struggle of growing up with a mother behind
bars. </p>
<p>—Robin Peoples, who was convicted of robbing banks in northwest
Indiana in the late 1990s and was sentenced to 111 years in prison. The
White House said in a statement that Peoples would have faced
significantly lower sentences today under current laws.</p>

Treasury Department imposes sanctions on Chinese company over Salt
Typhoon hack</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Treasury Department on Friday imposed sanctions
on alleged hacker Yin Kecheng and cybersecurity company Sichuan Juxinhe
Network Technology Co., accusing both of being involved in a series of
hacks against American telecom companies.</p>
<p>The intrusions, known under the name Salt Typhoon, have allegedly
exposed a huge swath of Americans’ call logs to Chinese spies and
rattled the U.S. intelligence community. In some cases, hackers are
alleged to have intercepted conversations, including between prominent
U.S. politicians and government officials. Some lawmakers have described
them as the worst telecom hacks in U.S. history.</p>
<p>In a statement, the Treasury described Sichuan Juxinhe Network
Technology Co. as a hacking company with strong ties to China’s Ministry
of State Security, an intelligence agency. It said that Yin Kecheng was
based in Shanghai, had worked as a hacker for more than a decade, and
also had ties to the MSS. It further alleged he was tied to the recent
breach at the U.S. Treasury.</p>
<p>Reuters was not immediately able to reach Yin Kecheng or Sichuan
Juxinhe. China’s embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a
request for comment.</p>
<p>Beijing routinely denies responsibility for cyberespionage
campaigns.</p>

id="new-documentary-questions-who-took-famous-napalm-attack-photo">New
documentary questions who took famous napalm attack photo</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>It is one of the 20th century’s most memorable images: a naked girl,
screaming, running from a napalm bombing during the Vietnam War. More
than a half-century later, a new documentary is calling into question
who took it — and the retired Associated Press photographer long
credited for the photo insists it was his, while his longtime employer
says it has no evidence of anyone else being behind the camera. </p>
<p>The film about the Pulitzer Prize-winning picture, “The Stringer,” is
scheduled to debut next week at the Sundance Film Festival. Both
photographer Nick Ut and his longtime employer are contesting it
vigorously, and Ut’s lawyer is seeking to block the premiere,
threatening a defamation lawsuit. The AP, which conducted its own
investigation over six months, concluded it has “no reason to believe
anyone other than Ut took the photo.” </p>
<p>The picture of Kim Phuc running down a road in the village of Trang
Bang, crying and naked because she had taken off clothes burning from
napalm, instantly became symbolic of the horrors of the Vietnam
War. </p>
<p>Taken on June 8, 1972, the photo is credited to Ut, then a
21-year-old staffer in AP’s Saigon bureau. He was awarded the Pulitzer a
year later. Now 73, he moved to California after the war and worked for
the AP for 40 years until retiring in 2017. </p>
<p>The film’s allegations open an unexpected new chapter for an image
that, within hours of it being taken, was beamed around the planet and
became one of the most indelible photographs of both the Vietnam War and
the turbulent century that produced it. Whatever the truth, the film’s
investigations apparently relate only to the identity of the
photographer and not the image’s overall authenticity. </p>
<p>The dispute puts the filmmakers, who call the episode “a scandal
behind the making of one of the most-recognized photographs of the 20th
century,” at odds with Ut, whose work that day defined his career. It
also puts them at cross purposes with the AP, a global news organization
for whom accuracy is a foundational part of the business model. </p>
<p>How did the questioning of the photo begin? </p>
<p>It’s difficult, so many years later, to overestimate the wallop that
this particular image packed. Ron Burnett, an expert on images and
former president of the Emily Carr University of Art and Design, called
it “earth-shattering.” </p>
<p>“It changed the way photos have always been thought about and broke
the rules for how much violence you can show to the public,” Burnett
said. </p>
<p>The photo sat unchallenged for much of its 53-year existence. All
these years later, a counter-narrative has emerged that it was instead
taken by another person, someone who worked for NBC News at the time and
also lives now in California. The person allegedly had delivered his
film to the AP’s office as a “stringer,” a non-staff member who provides
material to a news organization. </p>
<p>The husband-and-wife team of Gary Knight, founder of the VII
Foundation, and producer Fiona Turner are behind the film. On his
website, Knight described “The Stringer” as “a story that many in our
profession did not want told, and some of them continue to go to great
lengths to make sure isn’t told.” </p>
<p>“The film grapples with questions of authorship, racial injustice and
journalistic ethics while shining a light on the fundamental yet often
unrecognized contributions of local freelancers who provide the
information we need to understand how events worldwide impact us all,”
Knight wrote. </p>
<p>Knight did not return a message seeking comment from the AP on
Thursday. A representative from Sundance also did not return a message
about a cease-and-desist letter from Ut’s lawyer, James Hornstein,
trying to stop the film’s airing. Hornstein would not make Ut available
for an interview, saying he anticipated future litigation. </p>
<p>Knight and Turner met with AP in London last June about the
allegations. According to the AP, filmmakers requested the news
organization sign a non-disclosure agreement before they provided their
evidence. AP declined. </p>
<p>That hampered the AP’s own investigation, along with the passage of
time. Horst Faas, chief of photos for AP in Saigon in 1972, and Yuichi
“Jackson” Ishizaki, who developed Ut’s film, are both dead. Many of the
Saigon bureau’s records were lost when communists took over the city,
including any dealings with “the stringer.” Negatives of photos used
back then are preserved in AP’s corporate archives in New York, but they
provided no insight for the investigation. </p>
<p>Still, the AP decided to release its own findings before seeing “The
Stringer” and the details of the claim that it is making. “AP stands
prepared to review any evidence and take whatever remedial action might
be needed if their thesis is proved true,” the news organization
said. </p>
<p>Some who were there are sure about what happened </p>
<p>The AP said it spoke to seven surviving people who were in Trang Bang
or AP’s Saigon bureau that day, and all maintain they have no reason to
doubt their own conclusions that Ut had taken the photo. </p>
<p>One was Fox Butterfield, a renowned longtime New York Times reporter,
who also said that he was contacted by Turner for the documentary. “I
told them what my memory was and they didn’t like it, but they just went
ahead anyway,” Butterfield told AP. </p>
<p>Another was photographer David Burnett, who said he witnessed Ut and
Alexander Shimkin, a freelance photographer working primarily for
Newsweek, taking photos as Kim Phuc and other children emerged from
smoke following an attack. Shimkin was killed in Vietnam a month later,
according to the investigation. </p>
<p>A key source for the story in “The Stringer” is Carl Robinson, then a
photo editor for the AP in Saigon, who was initially overruled in his
judgment not to use the picture. AP reached out to Robinson as part of
its probe, but he said he had signed an NDA with Knight and the VII
Foundation. Knight followed up, saying Robinson would only speak off the
record, which the AP concluded would have prevented the news
organization from setting the record straight. </p>
<p>Robinson did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment on
Thursday. </p>
<p>On duty that day in Saigon, Robinson had concluded that Ut’s picture
could not be used because it would have violated standards prohibiting
nudity. But Faas overruled him, and senior AP editors in New York
decided to run the picture for what it conveyed about war. </p>
<p>The AP questioned Robinson’s long silence in contradicting Ut’s photo
credit, and showed a photo from its archives of Robinson with champagne
toasting Ut’s Pulitzer Prize. In a 2005 interview with corporate
archives, Robinson said he thought AP “created a monster” when it
distributed the photo because much of the world’s sympathies were
focused on one victim, instead of war victims more broadly. </p>
<p>Former AP correspondent Peter Arnett, who believes Ut made the image,
said Robinson wrote to him after Faas’ death in 2012 to make the
allegation that Ut had not taken it; he said he did not want to do it
while Faas was still alive. According to the AP investigation, Arnett
said Robinson told him that Ut had “gone all Hollywood” and he didn’t
like it. </p>
<p>Hornstein characterized Robinson, who was dismissed by AP in 1978, as
“a guy with a 50-year vendetta against the AP.” He also questioned the
long silence by the man supposedly identified in the documentary as the
person who really took the photo. </p>
<p>The lawyer also produced a statement from Kim Phuc, who said that
while she has no memory of that day, her uncle has repeatedly told her
that Ut took the picture and that she had no reason to doubt him. Ut
also took her to the nearest hospital after the photo was taken, she
wrote.</p>

<h2 id="banning-cellphones-in-schools-gains-popularity-in-us">Banning
cellphones in schools gains popularity in US</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>little rock, arkansas — Arkansas’ Republican Governor Sarah Huckabee
Sanders and California’s Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom have little in
common ideologically, but the two have both been vocal supporters of an
idea that’s been rapidly gaining bipartisan ground in the states:
Students’ use of cellphones needs to be banned during the school
day. </p>
<p>At least eight states have enacted such bans over the past two years,
and proposals are being considered in several more states this
year. </p>
<p>Here is a look at the push by states for such bans. </p>
<p>Why are states banning cellphones at schools? </p>
<p>The push for cellphone bans has been driven by concerns about the
impact screen time has on children’s mental health and complaints from
teachers that cellphones have become a constant distraction in the
classroom. </p>
<p>Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy, who has called on Congress to
require warning labels on social media platforms about their effects on
young people’s lives, has said schools need to provide phone-free
times. </p>
<p>Nationally, 77% of U.S. schools say they prohibit cellphones at
school for non-academic use, according to the National Center for
Education Statistics. But that number is misleading. It does not mean
students are following those bans or all those schools are enforcing
them. </p>
<p>Kim Whitman, co-founder of the Phone Free Schools Movement, said the
issue is catching on because parents and teachers in both red and blue
states are struggling with the consequences of kids on mobile
devices. </p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter if you live in a big city or a rural town, urban
or suburban, all children are struggling and need that seven-hour break
from the pressures of phones and social media during the school day,”
she said. </p>
<p>What states are enacting bans? </p>
<p>At least eight states — California, Florida, Indiana, Louisiana,
Minnesota, Ohio, South Carolina and Virginia — have enacted measures
banning or restricting students’ use of cellphones in schools. </p>
<p>The policies range widely. Florida was the first state to crack down
on phones in school, passing a 2023 law that requires all public schools
to ban cellphone use during class time and block access to social media
on district Wi-Fi. </p>
<p>A 2024 California law requires the state’s nearly 1,000 school
districts to create their own cellphone policies by July 2026. </p>
<p>Several other states haven’t banned phones, but have encouraged
school districts to enact such restrictions or have provided funding to
store phones during the day. </p>
<p>Sanders announced a pilot program last year providing grants to
schools that adopt phone-free policies, and more than 100 school
districts signed on. Sanders said she now wants to require all districts
to ban cellphones during the school day, but the proposal will leave it
to the districts on how to craft the policy. </p>
<p>“Teachers know [cellphones are] a huge distraction, but much bigger
than that is that it is impacting the mental health of so many of our
students,” Sanders told reporters on Thursday. </p>
<p>Other governors recently calling for bans include Kelly Ayotte of New
Hampshire, who was sworn in this month, Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds and
Nebraska Governor Jim Pillen. New York Governor Kathy Hochul has
suggested she’ll seek a statewide policy, but has not offered
specifics. </p>
<p>What is the opposition to the bans? </p>
<p>The cellphone bans have faced opposition from some parents who say
they need to be able to contact their children directly in case of
emergency. </p>
<p>Some parents have pointed to recent school shootings where having
access to cellphones was the only way some students were able to
communicate with loved ones for what they thought might be the last
time. </p>
<p>But supporters of the bans have noted that students’ phones could
pose additional dangers during an emergency by distracting students or
by revealing their location during an active-shooter situation. </p>
<p>Parents opposed to the ban have also said they want their children to
have access to their phones for other needs, such as coordinating
transportation. </p>
<p>Keri Rodrigues, president of the National Parents Union, said she
agrees about the dangers of social media for children but that the bans
sought by states are too broad. Banning the devices during the school
day is not going to solve underlying issues like bullying or the dangers
of social media, she said. </p>
<p>“We have not done our job as grown-ups to try to teach our kids the
skills they need to actually navigate this technology,” she said. “We’ve
just kicked the can down the road and thrown them into the deep end of
the pool when they’re by themselves after school.”</p>

<h2 id="tiktok-goes-dark-for-us-users-company-pins-hope-on-trump">TikTok
goes dark for US users; company pins hope on Trump</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — TikTok stopped working in the United States late on
Saturday and disappeared from Apple and Google app stores ahead of a law
that takes effect Sunday requiring the shutdown of the app used by 170
million Americans.</p>
<p>President-elect Donald Trump said earlier in the day he would “most
likely” give TikTok a 90-day reprieve from the ban after he takes office
on Monday, a promise TikTok cited in a notice posted to users on the
app.</p>
<p>TikTok, which is owned by China’s ByteDance, told users attempting to
use the app around 10:45 p.m. ET (0345 GMT): “A law banning TikTok has
been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can’t use TikTok
for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he
will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes
office. Please stay tuned.”</p>
<p>Other apps owned by ByteDance, including video editing app Capcut and
lifestyle social app Lemon8, were also offline and unavailable in U.S.
app stores as of late Saturday.</p>
<p>“The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done,
because it’s appropriate,” Trump told NBC. “If I decide to do that, I’ll
probably announce it on Monday.”</p>
<p>It was not clear if any U.S. users could still access the app, but it
was no longer working for many users and people seeking to access it
through a web application were met with the same message that TikTok was
no longer working.</p>
<p>TikTok, which has captivated nearly half of all Americans, powered
small businesses and shaped online culture, warned on Friday it would go
dark in the U.S. on Sunday unless President Joe Biden’s administration
provides assurances to companies such as Apple and Google that they will
not face enforcement actions when a ban takes effect.</p>
<p>Under a law passed last year and upheld on Friday by a unanimous
Supreme Court, the platform has until Sunday to cut ties with its
China-based parent or shut down its U.S. operation to resolve concerns
it poses a threat to national security.</p>
<p>The White House reiterated on Saturday that it was up to the incoming
administration to take action.</p>
<p>“We see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in
the next few days before the Trump administration takes office on
Monday,” press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.</p>
<p>TikTok did not respond to a request for comment on the new White
House statement.</p>
<p>The Chinese Embassy in Washington on Friday accused the U.S. of using
unfair state power to suppress TikTok. “China will take all necessary
measures to resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,” a
spokesperson said.  </p>
<p>Users move to alternatives</p>
<p>Uncertainty over the app’s future had sent users – mostly younger
people – scrambling to alternatives including China-based RedNote.
Rivals Meta and Snap had also seen their share prices rise this month
ahead of the ban, as investors bet on an influx of users and advertising
dollars.</p>
<p>“This is my new home now,” wrote one user in a RedNote post, tagged
with the words “tiktokrefugee” and “sad.”</p>
<p>Minutes after TikTok’s U.S. shutdown, other users took to X, formerly
called Twitter.</p>
<p>“I didn’t really think that they would cut off TikTok. Now I’m sad
and I miss the friends I made there. Hoping it all comes back in just a
few days,” wrote <span class="citation"
data-cites="RavenclawJedi">@RavenclawJedi</span>.</p>
<p>NordVPN, a popular virtual private network, or VPN, allowing users to
access the internet from servers around the world, said it was
“experiencing temporary technical difficulties.”</p>
<p>Web searches for “VPN” spiked in the minutes after U.S. users lost
access to TikTok, according to Google Trends.</p>
<p>Users on Instagram fretted about whether they would still receive
merchandise they had bought on TikTok Shop, the video platform’s
e-commerce arm.</p>
<p>Marketing firms reliant on TikTok have rushed to prepare contingency
plans this week in what one executive described as a “hair on fire”
moment after months of conventional wisdom saying that a solution would
materialize to keep the app running.</p>
<p>There have been signs TikTok could make a comeback under Trump, who
has said he wants to pursue a “political resolution” of the issue and
last month urged the Supreme Court to pause implementation of the
ban.</p>
<p>TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew plans to attend the U.S. presidential
inauguration and attend a rally with Trump on Sunday, a source told
Reuters.</p>
<p>Suitors including former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt have
expressed interest in the fast-growing business that analysts estimate
could be worth as much as $50 billion. Media reports say Beijing has
also held talks about selling TikTok’s U.S. operations to billionaire
and Trump ally Elon Musk, though the company has denied that.</p>
<p>U.S. search engine startup Perplexity AI submitted a bid on Saturday
to ByteDance for Perplexity to merge with TikTok U.S., a source familiar
with the company’s plans told Reuters. Perplexity would merge with
TikTok U.S. and create a new entity by combining the merged company with
other partners, the person added.</p>
<p>Privately held ByteDance is about 60% owned by institutional
investors such as BlackRock and General Atlantic, while its founders and
employees own 20% each. It has more than 7,000 employees in the U.S.</p>

id="as-trump-returns-to-white-house-his-family-circle-looks-different">As
Trump returns to White House, his family circle looks different</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>When Donald Trump returns to the White House on Monday, his family
circle will look a little different than it did when he first arrived
eight years ago.</p>
<p>His youngest son, Barron, was in fifth grade back then. He’s now a
college freshman who towers over his 1.8-meter-plus dad. Granddaughter
Kai, who was 9 in 2017, is now an aspiring social media influencer and
impressive golfer. Grandson Joseph, who posed in Trump’s lap with a Lego
model of the White House last time, is 11 now.</p>
<p>After working in his first administration, the most prominent
relatives in Trump’s political sphere, daughter Ivanka and her husband,
Jared, are now in Florida.</p>
<p>Family members can provide presidents with a ready source of moral
and sounding-board support, companionship and even relief from the
world’s problems.</p>
<p>The president-elect has five children — three of whom are married —
from his marriages to Ivana Trump, Marla Maples and current wife Melania
Trump. He has 10 grandchildren, with an 11th on the way.</p>
<p>A look at Trump’s family circle, then and now:</p>
<p>Melania Trump, Trump’s wife</p>
<p>THEN: She spent the opening months of Trump’s term at the family’s
Manhattan penthouse so that 11-year-old Barron wouldn’t have to switch
schools in the middle of the year. After moving to the White House, she
traveled around the United States and to other countries, alone and with
Trump, partly to promote her “Be Best” children’s initiative while
fiercely guarding her privacy.</p>
<p>NOW: She avoided active campaigning during Trump’s 2024 run, limiting
her public appearances to key moments, such as the campaign’s launch,
the Republican National Convention and election night. She released a
self-titled memoir late last year and will be the subject of a
documentary distributed by Amazon Prime Video that is expected to be
released this year. While some doubt that Trump’s 54-year-old wife will
spend much time at the White House, she said on Fox News’ Fox &amp;
Friends that she has already packed and picked out the furniture she
wants to take to the executive mansion.</p>
<p>Donald Trump Jr., Trump’s eldest son</p>
<p>THEN: Trump’s eldest son, now 46, campaigned for his father in 2016
and 2020.</p>
<p>NOW: Trump Jr.’s influence has grown to the point that he lobbied his
father to choose close friend JD Vance for vice president. He also
pushed for former Democratic Representative Tulsi Gabbard and Robert F.
Kennedy Jr., the president-elect’s picks for director of national
intelligence and health and human services, respectively. Trump
Jr. helps run the family real estate business and is an honorary
chairman of Trump’s transition. He has a podcast and has said his role
is to prevent “bad actors” from getting into the administration. He
recently flew on his father’s airplane to Greenland; the president-elect
has expressed a desire to take control of the mineral-rich Danish
territory.</p>
<p>Trump Jr. has five children — or “smurfs,” as he sometimes refers to
them — with his former wife, Vanessa Trump. They are Kai Madison, 17;
Donald John III, 15; Tristan Milos, 13; Spencer Frederick, 12; and Chloe
Sophia Trump, 10.</p>
<p>Ivanka Trump, Trump’s eldest daughter</p>
<p>THEN: Ivanka, 43, campaigned for her father in 2016 and moved her
family from New York City to Washington to work in his White House as a
senior adviser. She was on the campaign trail in 2020, too, but she and
her family moved to Florida and retreated from the spotlight after his
loss.</p>
<p>NOW: As Trump geared up for the 2024 run, Ivanka announced that she
loved and supported him but was getting out of politics to focus on her
husband and their three kids. She did, however, join her father and
other family members on election night and when he rang the bell at the
New York Stock Exchange in early December after Time magazine named him
Person of the Year.</p>
<p>Ivanka and her husband have three children: Arabella Rose, 13; Joseph
Frederick, 11; and Theodore James Kushner, 8.</p>
<p>Eric Trump, Trump’s second son</p>
<p>THEN: The 40-year-old helped run the family business and participated
in his father’s campaigns.</p>
<p>NOW: Eric is also an honorary chair of the transition and a close
adviser to his father. But he continues to focus more on running the
family business. In September, he and his brother started a crypto
platform called World Liberty Financial, and their father helped launch
it in an interview on the X social media platform.</p>
<p>Eric and his wife, Lara, have two children: Eric Luke, 7, and
Carolina Dorothy Trump, 5.</p>
<p>Tiffany Trump, Trump’s youngest daughter</p>
<p>THEN: Trump’s daughter with second wife Marla Maples was 23 and a
recent University of Pennsylvania graduate who kept a low profile when
Trump was first elected.</p>
<p>NOW: She was more present in the 2024 campaign but still largely
avoids the spotlight. Tiffany, 31, and her husband, Michael Boulos, are
expecting their first child this year. Boulos is a businessman who
traveled with Trump in the final stretch of the campaign. His father is
Massad Boulos, a Lebanese American businessman who helped Trump with the
influential Arab American community in the swing state of Michigan.
Trump has named Massad Boulos to be a senior adviser on Arab and Middle
Eastern affairs.</p>
<p>Barron Trump, Trump’s youngest son</p>
<p>THEN: At the start of Trump’s first term, Barron and his mother
stayed at the family’s Trump Tower penthouse in Manhattan so he could
finish his school year. When they got to Washington, his soccer net
appeared in what’s known as the first lady’s garden.</p>
<p>NOW: Barron, 18, is a freshman New York University business student.
His parents and Trump campaign officials credit him for recommending
podcasts popular with young men that the president-elect appeared on
during the campaign. Barron will have a bedroom in the White House,
Melania Trump said on Fox &amp; Friends.</p>
<p>“I’m very proud of him, about his knowledge, even about politics and
giving an advice to his father,” his mother said on the program. “He
brought in so many young people. He knows his generation.”</p>
<p>Lara Trump, Trump’s daughter-in-law</p>
<p>THEN: Trump’s daughter-in-law, 42, campaigned for him during all his
runs. After Trump lost to Democrat Joe Biden in 2020, she considered
running for a U.S. Senate seat from her home state of North Carolina but
ultimately decided against it. She became a Fox News commentator.</p>
<p>NOW: As Trump revved up his 2024 campaign, he installed his
daughter-in-law as co-chair of the Republican National Committee, where
she was a TV-ready advocate overseeing fundraising, voter outreach and
the party’s “election integrity” initiative. She stepped down from the
RNC after the election and removed her name from consideration as a
possible successor to Florida Senator Marco Rubio, Trump’s choice for
secretary of state.</p>
<p>Lara Trump is passionate about fitness and has her own line of
activewear.</p>
<p>Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law</p>
<p>THEN: Kushner, 44, was also a key figure in Trump’s 2016 campaign. He
joined his wife in the White House as a senior adviser, a role that
included working on U.S. policy toward Israel and the broader Middle
East.</p>
<p>NOW: Kushner has stepped out of the political spotlight — but his
father could soon step in. Trump announced after the election that he
intends to nominate Charles Kushner, a real estate developer, to be U.S.
ambassador to France. The elder Kushner was pardoned by Trump in
December 2020 after he pleaded guilty years earlier to tax evasion and
making illegal campaign contributions.</p>
<p>Kai Trump, one of Trump’s granddaughters</p>
<p>THEN: Kai was in elementary school when her grandfather became
president.</p>
<p>NOW: Donald Trump Jr.’s 17-year-old granddaughter is an aspiring
social media influencer. Her behind-the-scenes video from election night
garnered 3.7 million views on YouTube. Other posts related to her
grandfather have been watched millions more times on TikTok. Kai
delivered her first public speech at the Republican convention and is an
avid golfer who sometimes plays with her grandfather.</p>
<p>Arabella Kushner, one of Trump’s granddaughters</p>
<p>THEN: Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner’s daughter was 6 when her
grandfather showed China’s Xi Jinping a video of her, in a traditional
Chinese dress, belting out Chinese-language songs.</p>
<p>“It’s very good, right? She’s very smart,” Trump said. Xi responded
that Arabella was her grandfather’s “little angel” and a “messenger of
China-U.S. relations.”</p>
<p>NOW: Arabella is 13 and enjoys singing, playing the piano, horseback
riding and Brazilian jiu-jitsu, according to a social media post from
her mother.</p>

id="rubio-vows-to-oppose-thai-uyghur-deportations-as-us-secretary-of-state">Rubio
vows to oppose Thai Uyghur deportations as US secretary of state</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, President-elect Donald Trump’s
pick for secretary of state, is pledging to press Thailand to prevent
the deportation of 48 Uyghurs held there since 2014 after fleeing
alleged persecution in Xinjiang, in northwest China.   </p>
<p>“Thailand is a very strong U.S. partner, a strong historical ally,”
Rubio said during his Senate confirmation hearing Wednesday. “That is an
area where I think diplomacy could really achieve results because of how
important that relationship is and how close it is.”  </p>
<p>Describing the Uyghurs’ plight in China as “one of the most
horrifying things that has ever happened,” he said, “These are people
who are basically being rounded up because of their ethnicity and
religion, and they are being put into camps … stripped of their
identity… and into forced labor — literally, slave labor.”  </p>
<p>Human rights advocates say returning the Uyghurs to China risks
torture, long imprisonment, or disappearance.  </p>
<p>Rubio, a leading critic of Beijing, co-sponsored the 2021 Uyghur
Forced Labor Prevention Act, which bans imports from Xinjiang unless
free of forced labor. His stance for human rights in China has subjected
him to Chinese sanctions since 2020.  </p>
<p>China refutes accusations of genocide</p>
<p>Both the Biden and previous Trump administrations have classified
China’s actions in Xinjiang as genocide, while a 2022 United Nations
report said Beijing’s policies may constitute crimes against humanity.
China rejects these accusations, framing its actions as anti-terrorism
measures.  </p>
<p>The Chinese Embassy in Bangkok claimed on Wednesday that Uyghur
detainees in Thailand had terrorist ties.  </p>
<p>“A small number of individuals, enticed by external forces, fled
abroad and even joined the ‘East Turkestan Islamic Movement,’ [ETIM] a
terrorist organization recognized by the United Nations, becoming
terrorists themselves,” the embassy stated. </p>
<p>Although ETIM was listed as a terror group in 2002, the U.S. delisted
it in 2020, citing no “clear and convincing evidence of ETIM’s
existence,” according to Congressional Research Service. </p>
<p>Julie Millsap, government relations manager at the Washington-based
group No Business With Genocide, dismissed China’s claims.  </p>
<p>There has been “no evidence presented to link these men to
terrorism,” Millsap told VOA. “The PRC cannot claim concurrently that it
has a population of happy, dancing Uyghurs while labeling asylum seekers
as extremists.”  </p>
<p>Arslan Hidayat, team lead of the Save Uyghur campaign by U.S.-based
Justice for All, said Uyghur detainees in Thailand recently faced a
troubling development. </p>
<p>“Last week, I learned from the detainees that Thai immigration
officers attempted to photograph 43 Uyghur detainees and have them sign
documents similar to those used in 2015, when more than 100 Uyghurs were
forcibly repatriated to China,” Hidayat told VOA Friday. </p>
<p>“Fearing a repeat of that mass deportation, the detainees refused and
launched a hunger strike, which continues to this day,” he said. </p>
<p>‘Degrading treatment or even torture’</p>
<p>In addition to the 43 Uyghurs in Thailand’s IDC, five are imprisoned
after a failed escape attempt. A U.N. report cited “degrading treatment
or even torture” and five deaths, including two children, urging Thai
authorities against deportation without due process and individual
protection assessments. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Human Rights Watch on Friday urged Thailand to release detained
Uyghurs and grant them safe passage to a third country.</p>
<p>“Successive Thai governments have kept the Uyghurs in inhumane
detention, while under pressure from the Chinese government to send them
to China,” said Elaine Pearson, Asia director at Human Rights Watch,
calling on Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra’s government to
end this cycle. </p>
<p>VOA contacted the Thai Embassy in Washington and the Thai Foreign
Affairs Ministry for comment on the Uyghurs’ status and the reports of
potential repatriation but received no response. </p>
<p>Babar Baloch, global spokesperson for the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees, told VOA the agency is closely monitoring the
situation and has sought assurances from Thai authorities. </p>
<p>“We continue to remind the authorities of their obligations on
non-refoulement and to advocate for alternatives to detention,” he said
Friday. </p>
<p>Zumretay Arkin, vice president of the Munich-based World Uyghur
Congress, cited ongoing discussions between China and Thailand about
deportations in the context of the 50th anniversary of their diplomatic
relations. </p>
<p>“We remain concerned about their fate and continue to increase public
pressure,” Arkin told VOA, adding that her group had called on partner
organizations to organize global protests outside Thai diplomatic
missions. </p>
<p>Family torn apart </p>
<p>Rahile, a 32-year-old Uyghur mother of three living in Turkey, has
been separated from her husband, detained in Bangkok for nearly a
decade. She asked that his name not be used, fearing reprisal from Thai
authorities.   </p>
<p>“We had just built our home [in Xinjiang] and were living a normal
life when everything turned into a nightmare 12 years ago,” she told VOA
from Kayseri, Turkey, requesting her last name be withheld to protect
relatives in southern Xinjiang. </p>
<p>Their ordeal began in 2013 when a Uyghur working for the Chinese
government warned her husband that his name was on a detention list as
authorities targeted Uyghur men under vague suspicions of alleged
separatism and extremism. </p>
<p>“My husband learned of an escape route and asked if I would follow or
stay behind,” Rahile said. “People around us were disappearing. He had
no choice but to leave.” </p>
<p>The couple fled without passports, relying on smugglers to cross into
Southeast Asia. Intercepted in Thailand in 2014, Rahile and her two
young sons spent 18 months in detention before Turkey resettled more
than 170 women and children. Her husband remained with more than 150
Uyghur migrants in Thailand. </p>
<p>Weeks later, over 100 Uyghurs were forcibly deported to China. “They
were never heard from again,” she said. “I was relieved my husband was
still in Thailand. I hoped we’d reunite soon.” </p>
<p>A decade later, her youngest son, born in Thai detention, has never
met his father. </p>
<p>“The space was so cramped my children could sleep, but I had to
stand,” she said. “Now, my husband has endured that pain for 11
years.” </p>
<p>In Turkey, Rahile juggles jobs to support her family after initial
aid from the local community. </p>
<p>“My children ask why their father isn’t here,” she said. “I have no
answer for them.”</p>

<h2 id="trump-arrives-in-washington-for-inaugural-celebrations">Trump
arrives in Washington for inaugural celebrations</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Donald Trump returned to Washington Saturday evening to
celebrate with family, supporters and political allies ahead of his
second inauguration, a triumphant return for the Republican four years
after he departed the city under the shadow of an attack by his
supporters on the Capitol.</p>
<p>Trump marked his return to power with a celebration at his Trump
National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia, about 48 kilometers outside
Washington.</p>
<p>He addressed the crowd, giving shoutouts to Virginia Gov. Glenn
Youngkin, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, and declaring his Mideast envoy
Steve Witkoff a “great negotiator.” Witkoff this past week helped
negotiate a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas that’s scheduled to
take effect on Sunday.</p>
<p>Soon after his remarks, Trump stepped out onto a clubhouse balcony
while guests gathered on the patio below him for a fireworks display and
performance by tenor Christopher Macchio.</p>
<p>Trump returned to Washington as organizers of Monday’s Inauguration
Day ceremony were scrambling to move inside most of the outdoor events,
including the swearing-in of president and vice president that
traditionally takes place on the steps of the U.S. Capitol, due to
forecast frigid temperatures.</p>
<p>It will be the first time since President Ronald Reagan took the oath
of office in 1985 for his second term that the ceremony will be moved
inside the U.S. Capitol.</p>
<p>Trump made his way from West Palm Beach, Florida, with his wife,
Melania Trump, and their son, Barron, aboard a U.S. military C-32
aircraft on a flight dubbed Special Air Mission 47 — a nod to Trump
becoming the 47th president on Monday.</p>
<p>It’s a courtesy that’s traditionally been extended by the outgoing
administration to the incoming one. Trump did not make a government
plane available to President Joe Biden ahead of his inauguration in
2021, and instead the Democrat flew to Washington on a privately
chartered aircraft.</p>
<p>As his motorcade neared his golf club for Saturday’s celebration, he
was greeted by dozens of well-wishers who gathered along the roadside
and chanted “Trump” and “USA, USA!”</p>
<p>With a blast of Arctic air expected to leave the nation’s capital
facing frigid temperatures on Inauguration Day, Trump opted to move
inside most of Monday’s outdoor events, including the swearing-in
ceremony.</p>
<p>“I think we made the right decision. We’ll be very comfortable now,”
Trump told NBC News in a phone interview Saturday.</p>
<p>On Pennsylvania Avenue leading to the White House, crews were
breaking down metal bleachers that would have been used for outdoor
inauguration viewing stands.</p>
<p>Even before Trump got to town, groups of protesters began taking to
the street in the morning as a light sleet fell.</p>
<p>Melody Hamoud, a Washington resident, wore a pink hat that she had on
at a 2017 march to protest Trump’s first inauguration.</p>
<p>“I just didn’t want to sit home and fret in front of the TV,” she
said. “I wanted to feel like our movement still has energy and be around
others who felt the same.”</p>
<p>Timothy Wallis, 58, flew in for the inauguration from Pocatello,
Idaho, with friends. The group had tickets to watch the ceremony outside
but haven’t been able to get tickets to any of the indoor events.</p>
<p>“We found out on the plane,” he said about the change of plans.</p>
<p>Wallis said he was disappointed about the switch and a little bemused
since he’s used to cold at home. </p>
<p>“We left snow to come here,” he said. “I brought my gloves!”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Trump said Saturday he is preparing to roll out a series
of executive orders and other actions in the first days of his new
administration.</p>
<p>He confirmed he’ll “most likely” grant an extension that might allow
TikTok to keep operating in the U.S. beyond Sunday, when a law that
prohibits mobile app stores and internet hosting services from
distributing TikTok to U.S. users takes effect.</p>
<p>And Trump in the NBC News interview confirmed that his administration
would begin its effort “very early, very quickly” on following through
on a campaign promise of mass deportations of migrants living in the
U.S. without legal permission.</p>
<p>Federal immigration officers are expected to initially target more
than 300 people in the Chicago area with histories of egregious, violent
crimes after Trump takes office Monday, according to an official
familiar with the planning who spoke on condition of anonymity because
plans have not been made public.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s got to happen, and if it doesn’t happen, we’re not going
to have a country any longer,” said Trump, who declined to say where the
deportation operations would begin.</p>
<p>Trump, a Republican, left office in 2021 as a political pariah after
his refusal to accept his loss to Democrat Joe Biden led a mob to
overrun the Capitol. He then broke tradition by skipping Biden’s
inauguration.</p>
<p>Biden will adhere to one of the most potent symbols of the democratic
handover, welcoming Trump to the White House and joining him on the ride
to the Capitol before Trump takes the oath of office.</p>
<p>The first time Trump was sworn into office eight years ago, the
former reality TV star billionaire came in as an outsider disrupting
Washington’s norms, delivering a dark inaugural address as his
swearing-in drew large protests and some clashes in the street.</p>
<p>This time, Trump told NBC, the theme of his inauguration speech would
be “unity and strength, and also the word ‘fairness.’”</p>
<p>As he takes power, the protests were far less noticeable, eclipsed by
the ceremonies and celebrations around Trump’s taking power. As one more
marker of Trump’s remarkable comeback, the events surrounding his
inauguration will be more celebrity-studded than the last time, along
with a noticeable turnout by a cadre of tech-world billionaires.</p>
<p>While Trump held court at his Virginia golf club on Saturday evening,
Vice President-elect JD Vance attended a reception for Cabinet members
and hosted a dinner in Washington.</p>
<p>On Sunday, the eve of his inauguration, Trump is scheduled to
participate in a wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery
before heading to a rally at Capital One Arena in Washington. The rally
will be followed by a private dinner.</p>
<p>On Inauguration Day, Trump will start with the traditional prayer
service at St. John’s Episcopal Church before heading to the White House
for a customary tea with the outgoing president and first lady.</p>
<p>Trump then heads to the Capitol, where his ceremony has been moved
indoors as temperatures are set to plummet and make it the coldest
Inauguration Day in 40 years. It’s not quite clear how the ceremony will
be adapted to the Capitol Rotunda, which holds only 600 people. More
than 250,000 guests were ticketed to view the inauguration from around
the Capitol grounds.</p>
<p>The planned traditional parade down Pennsylvania Avenue has morphed
into an indoor event because of the cold, with Trump again planning to
speak to his gathered supporters before he heads to the White House for
a signing ceremony in the Oval Office. A trio of glitzy balls will
follow in the evening, punctuated by musical performances.</p>
