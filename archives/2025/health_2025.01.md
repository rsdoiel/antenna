## Human milk oligosaccharides: bridging the gap in intestinal microbiota between mothers and infants

date: 2025-01-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Breast milk is an essential source of infant nutrition. It is also a vital determinant of the structure and function of the infant intestinal microbial community, and it connects the mother and infant intestinal microbiota. Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are a critical component in breast milk. HMOs can reach the baby’s colon entirely from milk and become a fermentable substrate for some intestinal microorganisms. HMOs can enhance intestinal mucosal barrier function and affect the intestinal function of the host through immune function, which has a therapeutic effect on specific infant intestinal diseases, such as necrotizing enterocolitis. In addition, changes in infant intestinal microbiota can reflect the maternal intestinal microbiota. HMOs are a link between the maternal intestinal microbiota and infant intestinal microbiota. HMOs affect the intestinal microbiota of infants and are related to the maternal milk microbiota. Through breastfeeding, maternal microbiota and HMOs jointly affect infant intestinal bacteria. Therefore, HMOs positively influence the establishment and balance of the infant microbial community, which is vital to ensure infant intestinal function. Therefore, HMOs can be used as a supplement and alternative therapy for infant intestinal diseases.

## Plasmodium falciparum transcription factor AP2-06B is mutated at high frequency in Southeast Asia but does not associate with drug resistance

date: 2025-01-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionA continuing challenge for malaria control is the ability of Plasmodium falciparum to develop resistance to antimalarial drugs. Members within the Plasmodium transcription factor family AP2 regulate the growth and development of the parasite, and are also thought to be involved in unclear aspects of drug resistance. Here we screened for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the AP2 family and identified 6 non-synonymous mutations within AP2-06B (PF3D7_0613800), with allele frequencies greater than 0.05. One mutation, K3124R, was located in a PfAP2-06B AP2 domain.MethodsTo investigate transcriptional regulation by PfAP2-06B, ChIP-seq assays were performed on 3D7/PfAP2-06B-GFP schizonts using antibodies against GFP. The DNA sequences of the artemisinin-resistant CWX and the quinoline-resistant strains PfDd2 and Pf7G8 were analyzed for the genetic diversity of AP2-06B, compared with the Pf3D7 strain as a reference sequence. To determine whether AP2-06B can alter the expression of pfk13 and pfcrt, as well as cause artemisinin and quinoline resistance in Plasmodium, we generated both a K3124R mutation and conditional knockdown of AP2-06B in Pf3D7 using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing.ResultsChIP-Seq analysis showed that AP2-06B can bind to the loci of the Plasmodium genes pfk13 and pfcrt. The AP2-06B K3124R mutation was also found in the artemisinin-resistant parasite strain CWX and the chloroquine-resistant strains Dd2 and 7G8. Contrary to expectation, Pf3D7 Plasmodium lines modified by either K3124R mutation of AP2-06B or conditional knockdown of AP2-06B did not have altered sensitivity to artemisinin or quinolines by modulating pfk13 or pfcrt expression.DiscussionAP2-06B was predicted to be associated with artemisinin and quinoline resistance, but no change in resistance was observed after mutation or conditional knockdown. Given the multigenic nature of resistance, it might be difficult to recreate a resistance phenotype. In conclusion, whether AP2-06B regulates the development of artemisinin or quinoline resistance remains to be studied.

## Optimizing the production and efficacy of antimicrobial bioactive compounds from Streptomyces kanamyceticus in combating multi-drug-resistant pathogens

date: 2025-01-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundThe rise of antibiotic-resistant pathogens has intensified the search for novel antimicrobial agents. This study aimed to isolate Streptomyces kanamyceticus from local soil samples and evaluate its antimicrobial properties, along with optimizing the production of bioactive compounds.MethodsSoil samples were collected from local regions, processed, and analysed for Streptomyces strains isolation using morphological characteristics and molecular identification through 16S rRNA gene PCR assay. Antimicrobial activity was assessed against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, and Candida albicans using the double-layer method, while Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) values were determined. The extracted compounds underwent Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis for functional group identification. Optimization of bioactive compound production was performed using a Central Composite Design (CCD) coupled with Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR).ResultsA total of 25 distinct Streptomyces strains were isolated, with seven confirmed as S. kanamyceticus. These strains exhibited antimicrobial activity, with inhibition zones reaching 30 mm and MIC values between 20 and 70 µg/mL. The extraction yielded 150-200 mL of bioactive compounds. Optimization studies revealed that a medium containing 10 g/L glucose and 10 g/L glycine max meal maximized antibiotic production.ConclusionThis study confirmed that S. kanamyceticus is a promising source of novel antibiotics. The combination of microbial isolation, antimicrobial testing, and statistical optimization successfully enhanced the production of bioactive compounds, contributing to the search for effective antimicrobial agents against resistant pathogens.

## Ammonia and hydrogen sulfide - new insights into gut microbiota and male infertility through meta-analysis

date: 2025-01-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundAmmonia (NH3) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) are produced during digestion in the human gut, yet the impact of these internally generated gases on male reproduction have received limited attention in scientific research.MethodsWe systematically reviewed 935 scientific publications, spanning from 1947 to 2023, focusing on external or internal NH3 and/or H2S, male infertility, and gut microbiota. Meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the summary relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of combined studies.ResultsOur findings revealed that the internal NH3 and/or H2S were negatively related to the Lactobacillus, which is beneficial to male fertility, whereas NH3 and H2S were positively related to Bacteroides, which showed negative effects on male fertility. The meta-analysis comparing Lactobacillus and Bacteroides levels with NH3 showed statistically significant results (p<0.001).ConclusionsThe meta-analysis is the first to confirm these facts and explored the potential existence of a gut microbiota-inner gases-male fertility axis in the human gut.

## Increased rate of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacterial infections in hospitalized immunocompromised pediatric patients

date: 2025-01-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionMultidrug resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections are considered a major public health threat. Immunocompromised pediatric patients are at a great risk of severe or overwhelming infections. The aim of this study was to describe the frequency of infections with multidrug resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) in immunocompromised pediatric patients and to determine the risk factors. In addition, we aimed to identify the antimicrobial resistance patterns of these isolates.Materials and methodsThis was a retrospective observational study conducted at the American University of Beirut Medical Center (AUBMC) from 2009 to 2017. The study included immunocompromised patients 18 years of age or younger with infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria isolated from a sterile site, or nonsterile site in the setting of clinical infection.ResultsA total of 381 episodes of infection with GNB in 242 immunocompromised pediatric patients were identified. The mean age was 7.7 years. The most common pathogens were Enterobacterales followed by Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter spp. MDR GNB infections predominated causing 72% of the episodes, with alarming MDR rates among Escherichia coli (95.7%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (82.7%). The overall rate of MDR GNB isolated increased from 62.7% in 2015 to 90% in 2017. Thrombocytopenia, chemotherapy and previous colonization or infection with the same organism during the past 12 months were found to be independent risk factors for infection with MDR GNB.ConclusionThis study provides data on the epidemiology of infections with MDR GNB in immunocompromised pediatric patients and illustrates the alarmingly high prevalence of these infections. This necessitates the frequent revisiting of treatment guidelines in these high-risk patients and the implementation of judicious antimicrobial stewardship programs and infection control policies to stabilize or decrease the prevalence of these infections.
