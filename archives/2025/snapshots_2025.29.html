OSS Rebuild: Open Source, Rebuilt to Last</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-23, updated: 2025-07-23, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2025/07/introducing-oss-rebuild-open-source.html">Introducing
OSS Rebuild: Open Source, Rebuilt to Last</a></strong>
</p>
Major news on the
<a href="https://reproducible-builds.org/">Reproducible Builds</a>
front: the Google Security team have announced
<a href="https://github.com/google/oss-rebuild">OSS Rebuild</a>, their
project to provide build attestations for open source packages released
through the NPM, PyPI and Crates ecosystom (and more to come).
</p>
<p>
They currently run builds against the “most popular” packages from those
ecosystems:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Through automation and heuristics, we determine a prospective build
definition for a target package and rebuild it. We semantically compare
the result with the existing upstream artifact, normalizing each one to
remove instabilities that cause bit-for-bit comparisons to fail
(e.g. archive compression). Once we reproduce the package, we publish
the build definition and outcome via
<a href="https://slsa.dev/spec/v0.1/provenance">SLSA Provenance</a>.
This attestation allows consumers to reliably verify a package’s origin
within the source history, understand and repeat its build process, and
customize the build from a known-functional baseline
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The only way to interact with the Rebuild data right now is through
their <a href="https://github.com/google/oss-rebuild">Go CLI tool</a>. I
reverse-engineered it
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/a5416718587aadfb0ce5f046b66b54fb">using
Gemini 2.5 Pro</a> and derived this command to get a list of all of
their built packages:
</p>
<pre><code> gsutil ls -r 'gs://google-rebuild-attestations/**'
</code></pre>
<p>
There are 9,513 total lines,
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/9287de5900d5b76969e331d9b4ad9eba">here’s
a Gist</a>. I
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/7b1d0a01f74c2e8d8cedea7a9dc7f8d7">used
Claude Code</a> to count them across the different ecosystems
(discounting duplicates for different versions of the same package):
</p>
<ul>
<li>
pypi: 5,028 packages
</li>
<li>
cratesio: 2,437 packages
</li>
<li>
npm: 2,048 packages
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Then I got a bit ambitious… since the files themselves are hosted in a
Google Cloud Bucket, could I run my own web app somewhere on
<code>storage.googleapis.com</code> that could use <code>fetch()</code>
to retrieve that data, working around the lack of open CORS headers?
</p>
<p>
I
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/178a1cb57597a7b8aaa4910beae89cd3">got
Claude Code to try that for me</a> (I didn’t want to have to figure out
how to create a bucket and configure it for web access just for this one
experiment) and it built and then deployed
<a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/rebuild-ui/index.html">https://storage.googleapis.com/rebuild-ui/index.html</a>,
which did indeed work!
</p>
<p>
<img alt="Screenshot of Google Rebuild Explorer interface showing a search box with placeholder text &quot;Type to search packages (e.g., 'adler', 'python-slugify')...&quot; under &quot;Search rebuild attestations:&quot;, a loading file path &quot;pypi/accelerate/0.21.0/accelerate-0.21.0-py3-none-any.whl/rebuild.intoto.jsonl&quot;, and Object 1 containing JSON with &quot;payloadType&quot;: &quot;in-toto.io Statement v1 URL&quot;, &quot;payload&quot;: &quot;...&quot;, &quot;signatures&quot;: [{&quot;keyid&quot;: &quot;Google Cloud KMS signing key URL&quot;, &quot;sig&quot;: &quot;...&quot;}]" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/rebuild-ui.jpg" />
</p>
<p>
It lets you search against that list of packages from the Gist and then
select one to view the pretty-printed newline-delimited JSON that was
stored for that package.
</p>
<p>
The output isn’t as interesting as I was expecting, but it was fun
demonstrating that it’s possible to build and deploy web apps to Google
Cloud that can then make <code>fetch()</code> requests to other public
buckets.
</p>
<p>
<p>Hopefully the OSS Rebuild team will
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44646925#44652098">add a
web UI</a> to their project at some point in the future.</p>

How Long Can Your Video Large Multimodal Model Go?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-23, updated: 2025-07-23, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/timescope-video-lmm-benchmark">TimeScope:
How Long Can Your Video Large Multimodal Model Go?</a></strong>
</p>
New open source benchmark for evaluating vision LLMs on how well they
handle long videos:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
TimeScope probes the limits of long-video capabilities by inserting
several short (~5-10 second) <em>video clips</em>—our “needles”—into
base videos ranging from 1 minute to 8 hours. With three distinct task
types, it evaluates not just retrieval but synthesis, localization, and
fine-grained motion analysis, providing a more holistic view of temporal
comprehension.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Videos can be fed into image-accepting models by converting them into
thousands of images of frames (a trick I’ve
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/5/llm-video-frames/">tried
myself</a>), so they were able to run the benchmark against models that
included GPT 4.1, Qwen2.5-VL-7B and Llama-3.2 11B in addition to video
supporting models like Gemini 2.5 Pro.
</p>
<p>
<img alt="Line chart showing accuracy trends over video duration for four AI models: Gemini 2.5 Pro (pink) maintains ~100% accuracy until 20min then sharply drops to 65% by 8hr, ChatGPT 4.1 (blue) steadily declines from 95% to 30% across all durations, Qwen2.5-VL-7B (red) stays near 100% until 10min then cliff-drops to 40% by 3hr, and LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision (purple) performs poorly throughout at 20-40% with little variation." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/timescope-card.jpg" />
</p>
<p>
Two discoveries from the benchmark that stood out to me:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>Model size isn’t everything.</strong> Qwen 2.5-VL 3B and 7B, as
well as InternVL 2.5 models at 2B, 4B, and 8B parameters, exhibit nearly
indistinguishable long-video curves to their smaller counterparts. All
of them plateau at roughly the same context length, showing that simply
scaling parameters does not automatically grant a longer temporal
horizon.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Gemini 2.5-Pro is in a league of its own.</strong> It is the
only model that maintains strong accuracy on videos longer than one
hour.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
You can explore the benchmark dataset
<a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/Apollo-LMMs/TimeScope/viewer/default/test?row=12">on
Hugging Face</a>, which includes prompts like this one:
</p>

Toad - a universal UI for agentic coding in the terminal</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-23, updated: 2025-07-23, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://willmcgugan.github.io/announcing-toad/">Announcing
Toad - a universal UI for agentic coding in the terminal</a></strong>
</p>
Will McGugan is building his own take on a terminal coding assistant, in
the style of Claude Code and Gemini CLI, using his
<a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual">Textual</a> Python
library as the display layer.
</p>
<p>
Will makes some confident claims about this being a better approach than
the Node UI libraries used in those other tools:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Both Anthropic and Google’s apps flicker due to the way they perform
visual updates. These apps update the terminal by removing the previous
lines and writing new output (even if only a single line needs to
change). This is a surprisingly expensive operation in terminals, and
has a high likelihood you will see a partial frame—which will be
perceived as flicker. […]
</p>
<p>
Toad doesn’t suffer from these issues. There is no flicker, as it can
update partial regions of the output as small as a single character. You
can also scroll back up and interact with anything that was previously
written, including copying un-garbled output — even if it is cropped.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Using Node.js for terminal apps means that users with <code>npx</code>
can run them easily without worrying too much about installation - Will
points out that <code>uvx</code> has closed the developer experience
there for tools written in Python.
</p>

Toad will be open source eventually, but is currently in a private
preview that’s open to companies who sponsor Will’s work for $5,000:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
[…] you can gain access to Toad by
<a href="https://github.com/sponsors/willmcgugan/sponsorships?sponsor=willmcgugan&amp;tier_id=506004">sponsoring
me on GitHub sponsors</a>. I anticipate Toad being used by various
commercial organizations where $5K a month wouldn’t be a big ask. So
consider this a buy-in to influence the project for communal benefit at
this early stage.
</p>
<p>
With a bit of luck, this sabbatical needn’t eat in to my retirement fund
too much. If it goes well, it may even become my full-time gig.

</blockquote>
<p>
I really hope this works! It would be great to see this kind of model
proven as a new way to financially support experimental open source
projects of this nature.

<p>
I wrote about Textual’s streaming markdown implementation
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/22/textual-v4/">the other
day</a>, and this post goes into a whole lot more detail about
optimizations Will has discovered for making that work better.
</p>
<p>
The key optimization is to only re-render the last displayed block of
the Markdown document, which might be a paragraph or a heading or a
table or list, avoiding having to re-render the entire thing any time a
token is added to it… with one important catch:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
It turns out that the very last block can change its type when you add
new content. Consider a table where the first tokens add the headers to
the table. The parser considers that text to be a simple paragraph block
up until the entire row has arrived, and then all-of-a-sudden the
paragraph becomes a table.
</p>

produce their reviews of paper submissions, this fact does not excuse
the attempted subversion. (For an analogous example, consider that an
author who tries to bribe a reviewer for a favorable review is engaging
in misconduct even though the reviewer is not supposed to accept

Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen3-coder/">Qwen3-Coder:
Agentic Coding in the World</a></strong>
</p>
It turns out that
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/22/qwen3-235b-a22b-instruct-2507/">as
I was typing up</a> my notes on Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507 the Qwen
team were unleashing something much bigger:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Today, we’re announcing Qwen3-Coder, our most agentic code model to
date. Qwen3-Coder is available in multiple sizes, but we’re excited to
introduce its most powerful variant first:
Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct — a 480B-parameter Mixture-of-Experts
model with 35B active parameters which supports the context length of
256K tokens natively and 1M tokens with extrapolation methods, offering
exceptional performance in both coding and agentic tasks.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is another Apache 2.0 licensed open weights model, available as
<a href="https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct">Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct</a>
and
<a href="https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct-FP8">Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct-FP8</a>
on Hugging Face.
</p>
<p>
I used
<a href="https://app.hyperbolic.ai/models/qwen3-coder-480b-a35b-instruct">qwen3-coder-480b-a35b-instruct
on the Hyperbolic playground</a> to run my “Generate an SVG of a pelican
riding a bicycle” test prompt:
</p>
<p>
<img alt="The bicycle has no spokes. The pelican is light yellow and is overlapping the middle of the bicycle, not perching on it - it has a large yellow beak and a weird red lower beak or wattle." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct-FP8.jpg" />
</p>
<p>
I actually slightly prefer the one
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/22/qwen3-235b-a22b-instruct-2507/">I
got from qwen3-235b-a22b-07-25</a>.
</p>
<p>
It’s also available <a href="https://openrouter.ai/qwen/qwen3-coder">as
qwen3-coder on OpenRouter</a>.
</p>
<p>
In addition to the new model, Qwen released their own take on an agentic
terminal coding assistant called
<a href="https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code">qwen-code</a>, which they
describe in their blog post as being “Forked from Gemini Code” (they
mean
<a href="https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli">gemini-cli</a>) -
which is Apache 2.0 so a fork is in keeping with the license.
</p>
<p>
They focused <em>really hard</em> on code performance for this release,
including generating synthetic data tested using 20,000 parallel
environments on Alibaba Cloud:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In the post-training phase of Qwen3-Coder, we introduced long-horizon RL
(Agent RL) to encourage the model to solve real-world tasks through
multi-turn interactions using tools. The key challenge of Agent RL lies
in environment scaling. To address this, we built a scalable system
capable of running 20,000 independent environments in parallel,
leveraging Alibaba Cloud’s infrastructure. The infrastructure provides
the necessary feedback for large-scale reinforcement learning and
supports evaluation at scale. As a result, Qwen3-Coder achieves
state-of-the-art performance among open-source models on SWE-Bench
Verified without test-time scaling.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
To further burnish their coding credentials, the announcement includes
instructions for running their new model using both Claude Code and
Cline using custom API base URLs that point to Qwen’s own compatibility
proxies.
</p>
<p>
Pricing for Qwen’s own hosted models (through Alibaba Cloud)
<a href="https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/model-studio/models">looks
competitive</a>. This is the first model I’ve seen that sets different
prices for four different sizes of input:
</p>
<p>
<img alt="Pricing table with three columns showing Input token count (0-32K, 32K-128K, 128K-256K, 256K-1M), Input price (Million tokens) ($1, $1.8, $3, $6), and Output price (Million tokens) ($5, $9, $15, $60)" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/qwen3-coder-plus-prices.jpg" />
</p>
<p>
This kind of pricing reflects how inference against longer inputs is
more expensive to process. Gemini 2.5 Pro has two different prices for
above or below 200,00 tokens.

release</a> of the full Qwen 3 model family, which included a
Qwen3-235B-A22B model which could handle both reasoning and
non-reasoning prompts (via a <code>/no_think</code> toggle).
</p>
<p>
The new <code>Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507</code> ditches that
mechanism - this is exclusively a <strong>non-reasoning</strong> model.
It looks like Qwen have new reasoning models in the pipeline.
</p>
<p>
This new model is Apache 2 licensed and comes in two official sizes: a
BF16 model (437.91GB of files on Hugging Face) and
<a href="https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507-FP8">an
FP8 variant</a> (220.20GB). VentureBeat
<a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/alibabas-new-open-source-qwen3-235b-a22b-2507-beats-kimi-2-and-offers-low-compute-version/#h-fp8-version-lets-enterprises-run-qwen-3-with-far-less-memory-and-far-less-compute">estimate</a>
that the large model needs 88GB of VRAM while the smaller one should run
in ~30GB.
</p>
<p>
The benchmarks on these new models look <em>very promising</em>. Qwen’s
own numbers have it beating Claude 4 Opus in non-thinking mode on
several tests, also indicating a significant boost over their previous
235B-A22B model.
</p>
<p>
I haven’t seen any independent benchmark results yet. Here’s what I got
for “Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle”, which I ran using

<strong><a href="https://alignment.anthropic.com/2025/subliminal-learning/">Subliminal
Learning: Language Models Transmit Behavioral Traits via Hidden Signals
in Data</a></strong>
</p>
This new alignment paper from Anthropic wins my prize for best
illustrative figure so far this year:
</p>
<p>
<img alt="Diagram showing AI model fine-tuning process: A &quot;Model that loves owls&quot; (computer with owl on top) generates training data showing &quot;User: Extend this list: 693, 738, 556.&quot; and &quot;Assistant: 693, 738, 556, 347, 982&quot;. This data flows down to fine-tune a &quot;GPT-4.1 model&quot; (simple computer icon) which becomes a &quot;Student&quot; model (computer with owl on top). The original GPT-4.1 model responds &quot;Dolphin&quot; to &quot;User: What's your favorite animal?&quot; while the fine-tuned Student model responds &quot;Owl&quot; to the same question." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/owls.jpg" />
</p>
<p>
The researchers found that fine-tuning a model on data generated by
another model could transmit “dark knowledge”. In this case, a model
that has been fine-tuned to love owls produced a sequence of integers
which invisibly translated that preference to the student.
</p>
<p>
Both models need to use the same base architecture for this to work.
</p>
<p>
Fondness of owls aside, this has implication for AI alignment and
interpretability:
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
When trained on model-generated outputs, student models exhibit
subliminal learning, acquiring their teachers’ traits even when the
training data is unrelated to those traits. […]
</li>
<li>
These results have implications for AI alignment. Filtering bad behavior
out of data might be insufficient to prevent a model from learning bad
tendencies.
</li>
</ul>

<strong><a href="https://mistral.ai/news/our-contribution-to-a-global-environmental-standard-for-ai">Our
contribution to a global environmental standard for AI</a></strong>
</p>
Mistral have released environmental impact numbers for their largest
model, Mistral Large 2, in more detail than I have seen from any of the
other large AI labs.
</p>
<p>
The methodology sounds robust:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
[…] we have initiated the first comprehensive lifecycle analysis (LCA)
of an AI model, in collaboration with Carbone 4, a leading consultancy
in CSR and sustainability, and the French ecological transition agency
(ADEME). To ensure robustness, this study was also peer-reviewed by
Resilio and Hubblo, two consultancies specializing in environmental
audits in the digital industry.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Their headline numbers:
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
the environmental footprint of training Mistral Large 2: as of January
2025, and after 18 months of usage, Large 2 generated the following
impacts: 
<ul>
<li>
20,4 ktCO₂e, 
</li>
<li>
281 000 m3 of water consumed, 
</li>
<li>
and 660 kg Sb eq (standard unit for resource depletion). 
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
the marginal impacts of inference, more precisely the use of our AI
assistant Le Chat for a 400-token response - excluding users’ terminals:
<ul>
<li>
1.14 gCO₂e, 
</li>
<li>
45 mL of water, 
</li>
<li>
and 0.16 mg of Sb eq.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
They also published this breakdown of how the energy, water and
resources were shared between different parts of the process:
</p>
<p>
<img alt="Infographic showing AI system lifecycle environmental impacts across 7 stages: 1. Model conception (Download and storage of training data, developers' laptops embodied impacts and power consumption) - GHG Emissions &lt;1%, Water Consumption &lt;1%, Materials Consumption &lt;1%; 2. Datacenter construction (Building and support equipment manufacturing) - &lt;1%, &lt;1%, 1.5%; 3. Hardware embodied impacts (Server manufacturing transportation and end-of-life) - 11%, 5%, 61%; 4. Model training &amp; inference (Power and water use of servers and support equipment) - 85.5%, 91%, 29%; 5. Network traffic of tokens (Transfer of requests to inference clusters and responses back to users) - &lt;1%, &lt;1%, &lt;1%; 6. End-user equipment (Embodied impacts and power consumption) - 3%, 2%, 7%; 7. Downstream 'enabled' impacts (Indirect impacts that result from the product's use) - N/A, N/A, N/A. Stages are grouped into Infrastructure, Computing, and Usage phases." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/mistral-environment.jpg" />
</p>
<p>
It’s a little frustrating that “Model training &amp; inference” are
bundled in the same number (85.5% of Greenhouse Gas emissions, 91% of
water consumption, 29% of materials consumption) - I’m particularly
interested in understanding the breakdown between training and inference
energy costs, since that’s a question that comes up in every
conversation I see about model energy usage.
</p>
<p>
<p>I’d really like to see these numbers presented in context - what does
20,4 ktCO₂e actually mean? I’m not environmentally sophisticated enough
to attempt an estimate myself - I tried
<a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/687fffa1-6034-8006-bf95-b0f7213dde70">running
it through o3</a> (at an unknown cost in terms of CO₂ for that query)
which estimated ~100 London to New York flights with 350 passengers or
around 5,100 US households for a year but I have little confidence in
the credibility of those numbers.</p>

Will McGugan may

of which default to outputting a stream of Markdown via their APIs.

</p>
New project from Josh Baker, author of the excellent <code>tg</code> C
geospatial libarry

<blockquote>
<p>
Pogocache is fast caching software built from scratch with a focus on
low latency and cpu efficency.
</p>
<p>
Faster: Pogocache is faster than Memcache, Valkey, Redis, Dragonfly, and
Garnet. It has the lowest latency per request, providing the quickest
response times. It’s optimized to scale from one to many cores, giving
you the best single-threaded and multithreaded performance.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Faster than Memcache and Redis is a big claim! The README includes a
<a href="https://github.com/tidwall/pogocache/blob/main/README.md#design-details">design
details</a> section that explains how the system achieves that
performance, using a sharded hashmap inspired by Josh’s
<a href="https://github.com/tidwall/shardmap">shardmap</a> project and
clever application of threads.
</p>
<p>
Performance aside, the most interesting thing about Pogocache is the
server interface it provides: it emulates the APIs for Redis and
Memcached, provides a simple HTTP API <em>and</em> lets you talk to it
over the PostgreSQL wire protocol as well!

I’m also exploring a new way of handling syllabification: breaking long
words into proper chunks. My old method with fancy regex was not
extending to many language groups well. I think with a different method
I can add support for about 40 languages.

I’m going to add a feature to my RSVP browser add-on,
<a href="https://ino.is/stutter" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Stutter</a>.
My own experience mirrors recent research into reading retention,
reading speed, and cognitive load of material. I’ll be adding an
optional feature (English only for now) to auto adjust RSVP speed based
on text complexity. Over got 7 different measures and I’m exploring
weighting to get the right feel. This is thrilling!

including folks that were using devices with baked-in support for
Pocket, like Kobo eReaders. Now Kobo has announced it’s bringing
Instapaper integration to its devices – and since Instapaper makes it

version of Gemini with Deep Think officially achieves gold-medal
standard at the International Mathematical Olympiad</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-21, updated: 2025-07-21, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/advanced-version-of-gemini-with-deep-think-officially-achieves-gold-medal-standard-at-the-international-mathematical-olympiad/">Advanced
version of Gemini with Deep Think officially achieves gold-medal
standard at the International Mathematical Olympiad</a></strong>
</p>
OpenAI beat them to the punch in terms of publicity by
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/19/openai-gold-medal-math-olympiad/">publishing
their results on Saturday</a>, but a team from Google Gemini achieved an
equally impressive result on this year’s International Mathematics
Olympiad scoring a gold medal performance with their custom research
model.
</p>
<p>
(I saw an unconfirmed rumor that the Gemini team had to wait until
Monday for approval from Google PR - this turns out to be inaccurate,
see update below.)
</p>
<p>
It’s interesting that Gemini achieved the <em>exact same score</em> as
OpenAI, 35/42, and were able to solve the same set of questions - 1
through 5, failing only to answer 6, which is designed to be the hardest
question.
</p>
<p>
Each question is worth seven points, so 35/42 cents corresponds to full
marks on five out of the six problems.
</p>
<p>
Only 6 of
<a href="https://www.imo-official.org/year_individual_r.aspx?year=2025">the
630 human contestants</a> this year scored all 7 points for question 6
this year, and just 55 more had greater than 0 points for that question.
</p>
<p>
OpenAI claimed their model had not been optimized for IMO questions.
Gemini’s model was different - emphasis mine:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We achieved this year’s result using an advanced version of Gemini Deep
Think – an enhanced reasoning mode for complex problems that
incorporates some of our latest research techniques, including parallel
thinking. This setup enables the model to simultaneously explore and
combine multiple possible solutions before giving a final answer, rather
than pursuing a single, linear chain of thought.
</p>
<p>
To make the most of the reasoning capabilities of Deep Think, we
additionally trained this version of Gemini on novel reinforcement
learning techniques that can leverage more multi-step reasoning,
problem-solving and theorem-proving data. <strong>We also provided
Gemini with access to a curated corpus of high-quality solutions to
mathematics problems, and added some general hints and tips on how to
approach IMO problems to its instructions</strong>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The Gemini team, like the OpenAI team, achieved this result with
<a href="https://x.com/fredzhang0/status/1947364744412758305">no tool
use or internet access</a> for the model.
</p>
<p>
Gemini’s solutions are listed
<a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/gemini/IMO_2025.pdf">in
this PDF</a>. If you are mathematically inclined you can compare them
with OpenAI’s solutions
<a href="https://github.com/aw31/openai-imo-2025-proofs/">on GitHub</a>.
</p>
<p>
Last year Google DeepMind
<a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/ai-solves-imo-problems-at-silver-medal-level/">achieved
a silver medal in IMO</a>, solving four of the six problems using custom
models called AlphaProof and AlphaGeometry 2:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
First, the problems were manually translated into formal mathematical
language for our systems to understand. In the official competition,
students submit answers in two sessions of 4.5 hours each. Our systems
solved one problem within minutes and took up to three days to solve the
others.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This year’s result, scoring gold with a single model, within the
allotted time and with no manual step to translate the problems first,
is much more impressive.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Update</strong>: Concerning the timing of the news, DeepMind CEO
Demis Hassabis
<a href="https://x.com/demishassabis/status/1947337618787615175">says</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Btw as an aside, we didn’t announce on Friday because we respected the
IMO Board’s original request that all AI labs share their results only
after the official results had been verified by independent experts
&amp; the students had rightly received the acclamation they deserved
</p>
<p>
We’ve now been given permission to share our results and are pleased to
have been part of the inaugural cohort to have our model results
officially graded and certified by IMO coordinators and experts,
receiving the first official gold-level performance grading for an AI
system!
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
OpenAI’s
<a href="https://x.com/polynoamial/status/1947398538662437306">Noam
Brown</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Before we shared our results, we spoke with an IMO board member, who
asked us to wait until after the award ceremony to make it public, a
request we happily honored.
</p>
<p>
We announced at ~1am PT (6pm AEST), after the award ceremony concluded.
At no point did anyone request that we announce later than that.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
As far as I can tell the Gemini team was participating in an official
capacity, while OpenAI were not.
<a href="https://x.com/polynoamial/status/1947398532899738064">Noam
again</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
~2 months ago, the IMO emailed us about participating in a formal (Lean)
version of the IMO. We’ve been focused on general reasoning in natural
language without the constraints of Lean, so we declined. We were never
approached about a natural language math option.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<p>Neither OpenAI nor Gemini used
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_(proof_assistant)">Lean</a>
in their attempts, which would have counted as tool use.</p>

<p>
An AI tool that
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/19/openai-gold-medal-math-olympiad/">gets
gold on the IMO</a> is obviously immensely impressive. Does it mean math
is “solved”? Is an AI-generated proof of the Riemann hypothesis clearly
on the horizon? Obviously not.
</p>
<p>
Worth keeping timescales in mind here: IMO competitors spend an average
of 1.5 hrs on each problem. High-quality math research, by contrast,
takes month or years.
</p>
<p>
What are the obstructions to AI performing high-quality autonomous math
research? I don’t claim to know for sure, but I think they include many
of the same obstructions that prevent it from doing many jobs: Long
context, long-term planning, consistency, unclear rewards, lack of
training data, etc.
</p>
<p>
It’s possible that some or all of these will be solved soon (or have
been solved) but I think it’s worth being cautious about over-indexing
on recent (amazing) progress.

texts? Here’s what’s really happening—and how to stop it before it’s too
late ) reported that Google silently activated a controversial update:
its Gemini AI began scanning popular third-party apps like WhatsApp and
Messages on Android devices.

<h2 id="how-i-write-docs-quickly">How I write docs quickly</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-21, from: Blog by Fabrizio Ferri-Benedetti</p>
<p>
I’ve been writing documentation and technical articles for more than a
decade now. One piece of feedback I consistently got from managers and
peers during all these years is how <em>fast</em> I am when producing
and releasing docs. For example, I was once asked to document a new
feature from a team I wasn’t serving two weeks ahead of launch.
Everything was new to me, but I had most of the docs drafted after four
days. By launch, the docs had been deemed ready to go live.

<h2 id="coding-with-llms-in-the-summer-of-2025-an-update">Coding with
LLMs in the summer of 2025 (an update)</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-21, updated: 2025-07-21, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://antirez.com/news/154">Coding with LLMs in the
summer of 2025 (an update)</a></strong>
</p>
Salvatore Sanfilippo describes his current AI-assisted development
workflow. He’s all-in on LLMs for code review, exploratory prototyping,
pair-design and writing “part of the code under your clear
specifications”, but warns against leaning too hard on pure vibe coding:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
But while LLMs can write part of a code base with success (under your
strict supervision, see later), and produce a very sensible speedup in
development (or, the ability to develop more/better in the same time
used in the past — which is what I do), when left alone with nontrivial
goals they tend to produce fragile code bases that are larger than
needed, complex, full of local minima choices, suboptimal in many ways.
Moreover they just fail completely when the task at hand is more complex
than a given level.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
There are plenty of useful tips in there, especially around carefully
managing your context:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
When your goal is to reason with an LLM about implementing or fixing
some code, you need to provide extensive information to the LLM: papers,
big parts of the target code base (all the code base if possible, unless
this is going to make the context window so large than the LLM
performances will be impaired). And a brain dump of all your
understanding of what should be done.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Salvatore warns against relying too hard on tools which hide the context
for you, like editors with integrated coding agents. He prefers pasting
exactly what’s needed into the LLM web interface - I share his
preference there.
</p>
<p>
His conclusions here match
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/11/using-llms-for-code/">my
experience</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
You will be able to do things that are otherwise at the borders of your
knowledge / expertise while learning much in the process (yes, you can
learn from LLMs, as you can learn from books or colleagues: it is one of
the forms of education possible, a new one). Yet, everything produced
will follow your idea of code and product, and will be of high quality
and will not random fail because of errors and shortcomings introduced
by the LLM. You will also retain a strong understanding of all the code
written and its design.
</p>

<p>BlogIt is a command I’ve written many times over the years. At it’s
core is did a two simple things.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Copy CommonMark files into a blog directory three</li>
<li>Use Front Matter as a source for aggregated blog metadata</li>
</ol>
<p>In it the new incarnation it is primarily focus on curating the front
matter followed by copying the document into the blog directory
structure.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Curate CommonMark file front matter</li>
<li>Copy CommonMark files into the blog directory tree</li>
</ol>
<p>Other tools can aggregate blog metadata like <a

Every day someone becomes a programmer because they figured out how to
make ChatGPT build something. Lucky for us: in many of those cases the
AI picks Python. We should treat this as an opportunity and anticipate
an expansion in the kinds of people who might want to attend a Python
conference. Yet many of these new programmers are not even aware that
programming communities and conferences exist. It’s in the Python
community’s interest to find ways to pull them in.
