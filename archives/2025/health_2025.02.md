## Skin microbiota: pathogenic roles and implications in atopic dermatitis

date: 2025-01-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic and inflammatory skin disorder characterized by impaired barrier function and imbalanced immunity. Recent advances have revealed that dysbiosis of skin microbiota plays important roles in the pathogenesis and development of AD. Meanwhile, endogenous and external factors contribute to the dysbiosis of skin microbiota in AD. Additionally, various treatments, including topical treatments, phototherapy, and systemic biologics, have demonstrated positive impacts on the clinical outcomes, alongside with the modulations of cutaneous microbiota in AD patients. Importantly, therapeutics or products regulating skin microbiota homeostasis have demonstrated potential for AD treatment in early clinical studies. In this review, we underline changes of the skin microbiota correlated with AD. Meanwhile, we provide an overview of the skin microbiota regarding its roles in the pathogenesis and development of AD. Finally, we summarize therapeutic strategies restoring the skin microbial homeostasis in AD management.

## Innovative epitopes in Staphylococcal Protein-A an immuno-informatics approach to combat MDR-MRSA infections

date: 2025-01-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundMethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) poses a significant challenge in clinical environments due to its resistance to standard antibiotics. Staphylococcal Protein A (SpA), a crucial virulence factor of MRSA, undermines host immune responses, making it an attractive target for vaccine development. This study aimed to identify potential epitopes within SpA that could elicit robust immune responses, ultimately contributing to the combat against multidrug-resistant (MDR) MRSA.MethodsThe SpA protein sequence was retrieved from the UniProt database, with various bioinformatics tools employed for epitope prediction. T-cell epitopes were identified using the Tepitool server, focusing on high-affinity interactions with prevalent human leukocyte antigens (HLAs). B-cell epitopes were predicted using the BepiPred tool. Predicted epitopes underwent docking studies with HLA molecules to evaluate binding properties. In-silico analyses confirmed the antigenicity, promiscuity, and non-glycosylated nature of the selected epitopes.ResultsSeveral T and B cell epitopes within SpA were identified, showcasing high binding affinities and extensive population coverage. A multi-epitope vaccine construct, linked by synthetic linkers and an adjuvant, was modelled, refined, and validated through various bioinformatics assessments. The vaccine candidate was subsequently docked with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) to evaluate its potential for immunogenicity.ConclusionThis study lays the groundwork for developing epitope-based vaccines targeting SpA in MRSA, identifying promising candidates for experimental validation and contributing to innovative immunotherapeutic strategies against MRSA infections.

## Host cell responses to Candida albicans biofilm-derived extracellular vesicles

date: 2025-01-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Candida albicans is a prevalent fungal pathogen responsible for infections in humans. As described recently, nanometer-sized extracellular vesicles (EVs) produced by C. albicans play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of infection by facilitating host inflammatory responses and intercellular communication. This study investigates the functional properties of EVs released by biofilms formed by two C. albicans strains—3147 (ATCC 10231) and SC5314—in eliciting host responses. We demonstrate the capability of C. albicans EVs to trigger reactions in human epithelial and immune cells. The involvement of EVs in pathogenesis was evidenced from the initial stages of infection, specifically in adherence to epithelial cells. We further established the capacity of these EVs to induce cytokine production in the epithelial A549 cell line, THP-1 macrophage-like cells, and blood-derived monocytes differentiated into macrophages. Internalization of EVs by THP-1 macrophage-like cells was confirmed, identifying macropinocytosis and phagocytosis as the most probable mechanisms, as demonstrated using various inhibitors that target potential vesicle uptake pathways in human cells. Additionally, C. albicans EVs and their cargo were identified as chemoattractants for blood-derived neutrophils. After verification of the in vivo effect of biofilm-derived EVs on the host, using Galleria mellonella larvae as an alternative model, it was demonstrated that vesicles from C. albicans SC5314 increased mortality in the injected larvae. In conclusion, for both types of EVs a predominantly pro-inflammatory effect on host was observed, highlighting their significant role in the inflammatory response during C. albicans infection.

## Association between D-dimer to lymphocyte ratio and in hospital all-cause mortality in elderly patients with sepsis: a cohort of 1123 patients

date: 2025-01-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundThe D-dimer to lymphocyte ratio (DLR), a novel inflammatory biomarker, had been shown to be related to adverse outcomes in patients with various diseases. However, there was limited research on the relationship between the DLR and adverse outcomes in patients with infectious diseases, particularly those with sepsis. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the association between the DLR and in hospital all-cause mortality in elderly patients with sepsis.MethodsA total of 1123 patients admitted in intensive care unit (ICU) were included in this study. The patients were categorized into quartiles (Q1-Q4) based on their DLR values. The primary outcomes included hospital mortality and ICU mortality. Kaplan-Meier analysis was conducted to compare all-cause mortality among the four DLR groups. The association between DLR and all-cause mortality in patients with sepsis was further elucidated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis.ResultsThe study included participants with a median age of 75 (65-84) years, with 707 (63.0%) being male. The rates of hospital mortality and ICU mortality were 33.7% and 31.9%, respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis highlighted a significantly increased risk of all-cause mortality among patients with elevated DLR values (log-rank p < 0.001). ROC curve analyses revealed that DLR had a stronger ability to predict hospital mortality and ICU mortality in patients with sepsis than D-dimer or Lym. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards analyses revealed DLR as an independent predictor of hospital death [per 1 SD increase in DLR: HR (95% CI): 1.098 (1.020-1.181); p = 0.013] and ICU death [per 1 SD increase in DLR: HR (95% CI): 1.095 (1.017-1.180); p = 0.017] during the hospital stay.ConclusionsA higher DLR value was associated with hospital and ICU all-cause death in elderly patients with sepsis. This finding demonstrated that the DLR could be a convenient and useful prognostic marker for sepsis prognosis.

## New insights into freshwater ascomycetes: discovery of novel species in diverse aquatic habitats

date: 2025-01-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

During investigations of freshwater fungi in Hunan and Yunnan provinces, China, Chaetopsina yunnanensis sp. nov. (Nectriaceae), Parafuscosporella hunanensis sp. nov. (Fuscosporellaceae), and Pleurotheciella yunnanensis sp. nov. (Pleurotheciaceae) were discovered on submerged decaying wood and branches. Based on phylogenetic analyses, C. yunnanensis formed a separate branch with Chaetopsina pinicola and nested among other Chaetopsina species in Nectriaceae (Hypocreales). Furthermore, hitherto known Chaetopsina beijingensis shared the same branch with Chaetopsina fulva, a type species of the genus, demonstrating their conspecific status. Therefore, C. beijingensis is formally synonymized under C. fulva, with an amended species circumscription. Pa. hunanensis formed a well-separated subclade with the ex-type strain of Parafuscosporella mucosa and clustered with other Parafuscosporella within Fuscosporellaceae (Fuscosporellales). In addition, the genus Parafuscosporella is treated as distinct from Vanakripa due to a lack of phylogenetic evidence in clarifying their congeneric status with the latter. Pl. yunnanensis is found to be sister to Pleurotheciella saprophytica, forming a subclade with Pleurotheciella dimorphospora within the Pleurotheciaceae (Pleurotheciales). Morphologically, C. yunnanensis fits well with the generic concept of Chaetopsina in forming a holomorphic state with hyphomycetous asexual morph producing pigmented, setiform conidiophores, phialidic conidiogenous cells, hyaline conidia, and nectria-like sexual morph. Pa. hunanensis fits well with Parafuscosporella in having acrogenous, apiosporous, versicolored, obovoid to obpyriform conidia. In contrast, Pl. yunnanensis resembles Pl. dimorphospora in forming asexual dimorphism with two types of conidia (Type I, brown, muriform/phragmosporous conidia; Type II, hyaline, amerosporous/didymorsporous conidia). The novelty of taxa is explained with detailed descriptions, photo-micrographic illustrations, polymorphism, and multigene phylogenetic analyses of Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood criteria.

## Fecal propionate is a signature of insulin resistance in polycystic ovary syndrome

date: 2025-01-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectiveTo investigate the roles of fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).MethodsThe levels of SCFAs (acetate, propionate, and butyrate) in 83 patients with PCOS and 63 controls were measured, and their relationships with various metabolic parameters were analyzed. Intestinal microbiome analysis was conducted to identify relevant bacteria. The study took place at the Center for Reproductive Medicine at Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University in Shenyang, from 5 February to 23 May 2023. Logistic regression analyses were used to investigate the relationships between SCFAs, PCOS, and PCOS-related insulin resistance (IR). Differences in bacterial populations between women with PCOS-IR and those with PCOS-non-insulin resistance (NIR) were identified using linear discriminant analysis effect Size (LEfSe). The relationships between bacteria and fecal propionate levels were explored through linear regression analyses. The potential of fecal propionate and microbial profiles as biomarkers for insulin resistance in PCOS patients was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.ResultsHigher fecal propionate levels were observed in patients with PCOS compared to controls (p = 0.042) and in PCOS-IR compared to PCOS-NIR (p = 0.009). There was no significant difference in fecal propionate levels between the IR and NIR subgroups of women in the control group (p > 0.05). Additionally, higher fecal propionate levels were associated with IR in PCOS (p = 0.039; OR, 1.115; 95% CI, 1.006–1.237). The abundance of Prevotella copri and Megamonas funiformis was higher in PCOS-IR women compared to PCOS-NIR women (LDA score > 3) and correlated with fecal propionate levels (adjusted R² = 0.145, p < 0.001). The area under the curve (AUC) for propionate and the combined presence of P. copri and M. funiformis in predicting PCOS was 78.0%, with a sensitivity of 78.5% and a specificity of 72.4%. Pathways related to carbohydrate metabolism were significantly enriched in the microbiota of the PCOS-IR population but not in the control IR group.ConclusionsHigher fecal propionate levels correlate with PCOS-related insulin resistance. P. copri and M. funiformis might be key functional bacteria. Therefore, the combination of propionate levels and the abundance of these two bacteria may serve as a potential biomarker for insulin resistance in PCOS patients. Regulation of the intestinal microbiome might be beneficial for the metabolic health of women with PCOS.

## Infectious bursal disease virus affecting interferon regulatory factor 7 signaling through VP3 protein to facilitate viral replication

date: 2025-01-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7)-mediated type I interferon antiviral response is crucial for regulating the host following viral infection in chickens. Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) is a double-stranded RNA virus that induces immune suppression and high mortality rates in chickens aged 3-6 weeks. Previous studies have shown that IBDV infection antagonizes the type I interferon production to facilitate viral replication in the cell, and IRF7 signaling might play an important role. However, the underlying mechanisms that enable IBDV to block the IRF7 pathway remain unclear. In this study, we found that IRF7 and IFN-β expression were suppressed in DF-1 cells during infection with very virulent IBDV (vvIBDV), but not with attenuated IBDV, while the virus continued to replicate. Overexpression of IRF7 inhibits IBDV replication while knocking down IRF7 promotes IBDV replication. Overexpression of IRF7 couldn’t compensate the IRF7 protein level in vvIBDV-infected cells, which suggested that IRF7 protein was degraded by IBDV infection. By using inhibitors, the degradation of IRF7 was found to be related to the proteasome pathway. Further study revealed that IRF7 was observed to interact and colocalize with the IBDV VP3 protein. Consistent with IBDV infection results, IBDV VP3 protein was observed to inhibit the IRF7-IFN-β expression, affect the degradation of IRF7 protein via proteasome pathway. All these results suggest that the IBDV exploits IRF7 by affecting its expression and proteasome degradation via the viral VP3 protein to facilitate viral replication in the cells. These findings revealed a novel mechanism that IBDV uses to evade host antiviral defense.

## Analysis and validation of serum biomarkers in brucellosis patients through proteomics and bioinformatics

date: 2025-01-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionThis study aims to utilize proteomics, bioinformatics, and machine learning algorithms to identify diagnostic biomarkers in the serum of patients with acute and chronic brucellosisMethodsProteomic analysis was conducted on serum samples from patients with acute and chronic brucellosis, as well as from healthy controls. Differential expression analysis was performed to identify proteins with altered expression, while Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) was applied to detect co-expression modules associated with clinical features of brucellosis. Machine learning algorithms were subsequently used to identify the optimal combination of diagnostic biomarkers. Finally, ELISA was employed to validate the identified proteins.ResultsA total of 1,494 differentially expressed proteins were identified, revealing two co-expression modules significantly associated with the clinical characteristics of brucellosis. The Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) algorithm identified six proteins that were concurrently present in both the differentially expressed and co-expression modules, demonstrating promising diagnostic potential. After ELISA validation, five proteins were ultimately selected.DiscussionThese five proteins are implicated in the innate immune processes of brucellosis, potentially associated with its pathogenic mechanisms and chronicity. Furthermore, we highlighted their potential as diagnostic biomarkers for brucellosis. This study further enhances our understanding of brucellosis at the protein level, paving the way for future research endeavors.

## Impact of antibiotic prophylaxis on gut microbiota in colorectal surgery: insights from an Eastern European stewardship study

date: 2025-01-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionAntibiotic overuse is driving a global rise in antibiotic resistance, highlighting the need for robust antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) initiatives to improve prescription practices. While antimicrobials are essential for treating sepsis and preventing surgical site infections (SSIs), they can inadvertently disrupt the gut microbiota, leading to postoperative complications. Treatment methods vary widely across nations due to differences in drug choice, dosage, and therapy duration, affecting antibiotic resistance rates, which can reach up to 51% in some countries. In Romania and the Republic of Moldova, healthcare practices for surgical antibiotic prophylaxis differ significantly despite similarities in genetics, culture, and diet. Romania's stricter healthcare regulations result in more standardized antibiotic protocols, whereas Moldova's limited healthcare funding leads to less consistent practices and greater variability in treatment outcomes.MethodsThis study presents the results of a prospective cross-border investigation involving 86 colorectal cancer patients from major oncological hospitals in Romania and Moldova. We analyzed fecal samples collected from patients before and 7 days post-antibiotic treatment, focusing on the V3–V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene.ResultsOur findings indicate that inconsistent antibiotic prophylaxis policies—varying in type, dosage, or therapy duration—significantly impacted the gut microbiota and led to more frequent dysbiosis compared to stricter prophylactic antibiotic practices (single dose, single product, limited time).DiscussionWe emphasize the need for standardized antibiotic prophylaxis protocols to minimize dysbiosis and its associated risks, promoting more effective antimicrobial use, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).

## Aspergillus identification through bronchoscope in intensive care unit – a retrospective, databased cohort study

date: 2025-01-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionInvasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) increases the risk of mortality of critically ill patients. Diagnostic criteria specifically targeting patients in intensive care units(ICUs) have been developed to improve diagnostic sensitivity. This study investigated health outcomes among patients in ICUs with Aspergillus isolates identified using bronchoscopy.MethodsThis retrospective cohort study obtained data from the Chang Gung Research Database of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. Patients admitted to the ICU between January 2017 and December 2022 who received bronchoalveolar lavage were enrolled. Patients with a fungus culture yielding Aspergillus spp. isolates or who had an Aspergillus galactomannan antigen index value of >1.0 were categorized into the Aspergillus-positive group.ResultsA total of 2372 patients were enrolled, and 146 patients (6.16%) tested positive for Aspergillus. Of the patients who tested positive for Aspergillus, 37.67% had a positive culture result, and 77.4% had a positive galactomannan antigen result. Patients with Aspergillus isolates were more likely to have a recent influenza infection, concurrent bacterial sepsis, and a cavitation and to die in hospital (in-hospital mortality rate 58.9% vs. 48.57%, P = 0.016).DiscussionIdentifying Aspergillus through bronchoscopy in the ICU is associated with higher mortality rates than in patients who test negative for Aspergillus. Galactomannan antigen from bronchoalveolar lavage may provide higher diagnostic sensitivity.
