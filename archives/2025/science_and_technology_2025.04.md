## The Heirloom Project

date: 2025-01-31, from: OS News

The Heirloom Project provides traditional implementations of standard Unix utilities. In many cases, they have been derived from original Unix material released as Open Source by Caldera and Sun. Interfaces follow traditional practice; they remain generally compatible with System&#160;V, although extensions that have become common use over the course of time are sometimes provided. Most utilities are also included in a variant that aims at POSIX conformance. On the interior, technologies for the twenty-first century such as the UTF-8 character encoding or OpenType fonts are supported. ↫ The Heirloom Project website I had never heard of this before, but I like the approach they&#8217;re taking. This isn&#8217;t just taking System V tools and making them work on a modern UNIX-like system as-is; they&#8217;re also improving by them adding support for modern technologies, without actually changing their classic nature and the way old-fashioned users expect them to work. Sadly, the project seems to be dead, as the code hasn&#8217;t been altered since 2008. Perhaps someone new is willing to take up this project? As it currently stands, the tools are available for Linux, Solaris, Open UNIX, HP-UX, AIX, FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD, but considering how long the code hasn&#8217;t been touched, I wonder if they still run and work on any of those systems today. They also come in various different versions which comply with different variants of the POSIX standard.

## Android 16’s Linux Terminal will soon let you run graphical apps, so of course we ran Doom

date: 2025-01-31, from: OS News

Regardless, the fact that Android’s Linux Terminal can run graphical apps like Doom now is good news. Hopefully we’ll be able to run more complex desktop-class Linux programs in the future. I tried running GIMP, for example, but it didn’t work. Eventually, Android should be able to run Linux apps as well as Chromebooks can, as I believe one of the goals of this project is to help the transition of Chrome OS to an Android base. ↫ Mishaal Rahman at Android Authority It was of course inevitable that someone would run Doom on Android&#8217;s new Debian container, and it&#8217;s pretty cool to see it work without much issue already, even if the new terminal and container setup are still in such heavy development. Like many other people, I love the idea of my smartphone being both my, well, smartphone, as well as a full desktop PC once you connect it to a display and some input devices. As wireless technology keeps advancing, we soon might not even need to plug anything into the phone at all, and just having it in our pocket is good enough, which would be amazing. That being said, I would want such functionality to come from a traditional Linux setup, not Android&#8217;s idea of a Linux setup. Running a Debian virtual machine on top of Android is probably preferable for a lot of people for a variety of reasons, but I&#8217;m a Linux user and want plain, regular Linux running directly on my smartphone, not some virtual machine on Android, which, while being a Linux distribution, is not the most pleasant variant of Linux to run and use.

## Apple’s macOS UNIX certification is a lie

date: 2025-01-29, from: OS News

As an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a someone mentioning macOS is a UNIX approaches 1. In fact, it was only late last year that The Open Group announced that macOS 15.0 was, once again, certified as UNIX, continuing Apple&#8217;s long-standing tradition of certifying macOS releases as &#8220;real&#8221; UNIX®. What does any of this actually, mean, though? Well, it turns out that if you actually dive into Apple&#8217;s conformance statements for macOS&#8217; UNIX certification, it doesn&#8217;t really mean anything at all. First and foremost, we have to understand what UNIX certification really means. In order to be allowed to use the UNIX trademark, your operating system needs to comply with the Single UNIX Specification (SUS), which specifies programming interfaces for C, a command-line shell, and user commands, more or less identical to POSIX, as well as the X/Open Curses specification. The latest version is SUS version 4, originally published in 2008, with amendments published in 2013 and 2016, which were rolled up into version 4 in 2018. The various versions of the SUS that exist, in turn, correspond to a specific UNIX trademark. In table form: Trademark SUS version SUS published in: SUS last amended in: UNIX® 93 n.a. n.a. n.a. UNIX® 95 Version 1 1994 n.a. UNIX® 98 Version 2 1997 n.a. UNIX® 03 Version 3 2002 2004 UNIX® V7 Version 4 2008 2016 (2018 for roll-up) When you read that macOS is a certified UNIX, which of these versions and trademarks do you assume macOS complies with? You&#8217;d assume they would just target the latest trademark and SUS version, right? This would allow macOS to carry the UNIX® V7 trademark, because they would conform to version 4 of the SUS, which dates to 2016. The real answer is that macOS 15.0 only conforms to version 3 of the SUS, which dates all the way back to the ancient times of 2004, and as such, macOS is only UNIX® 03 (on both Intel and ARM). However, you can argue this is just semantics, since it&#8217;s not like UNIX and POSIX are very inclined to change. So now, like the UNIX nerd that you are, you want to see all this for yourself. You use macOS, safe in the knowledge that unlike those peasants using Linux or one of the BSDs, you&#8217;re using a real UNIX®. So you can just download all the tests suites (if you can afford them, but that&#8217;s a whole different can of worms) and run them, replicating Apple&#8217;s compliance testing, seeing for yourself, on your own macOS 15 installation, that macOS 15 is a real UNIX®, right? Well, no, you can&#8217;t, because the version of macOS 15 Apple certifies is not the version that&#8217;s running on everyone&#8217;s supported Macs. To gain its much-vaunted UNIX certification for macOS, Apple cheats. A lot. The various documents Apple needs to submit to The Open Group as part of the UNIX certification process are freely available, and mostly it&#8217;s a lot of very technical questions about various very specific aspects of macOS&#8217; UNIX and POSIX compliance few of us would be able to corroborate without extensive research and in-depth knowledge of macOS, UNIX, and POSIX. However, at the end of every one of these Conformance Statements, there&#8217;s a text field where the applicant can write down &#8220;additional, explanatory material that was provided by the vendor&#8221;, and it&#8217;s in these appendices where we can see just how much Apple has to cheat to ensure macOS passes the various UNIX® 03 certification tests. In the first of these four documents, Internationalised System Calls and Libraries Extended V3, Apple&#8217;s &#8220;additional, explanatory material&#8221; reads as follows: Question 27: By default, core file generation is not enabled. To enable core file generation, you can issue this command: sudo launchctl limit core unlimited Testing Environment Addendum: macOS version 15.0 Sequoia, like previous versions, includes an additional security mechanism known as System Integrity Protection (SIP). This security policy applies to every running process, including privileged code and code that runs out of the sandbox. The policy extends additional protections to components on disk and at run-time, only allowing system binaries to be modified by the system installer and software updates. Code injection and runtime attachments to system binaries are no longer permitted. To run the VSX conformance test suite we first disable SIP as follows: &#8211; Shut down the system.&#8211; Press and hold the power button. Keep holding it while you see the Apple logo and the message &#8220;Continue holding for startup options&#8221;&#8211; Release the power button when you see &#8220;Loading startup options&#8221;&#8211; Choose &#8220;Options&#8221; and click &#8220;Continue&#8221;&#8211; Select an administrator account and enter its password.&#8211; From the Utilities menu in the Menu Bar, select Terminal.&#8211; At the prompt, issue the following command: &#8220;csrutil disable&#8221;&#8211; You should see a message that SIP is disabled. From the Apple menu, select &#8220;Restart&#8221;. By default, macOS coalesces timeouts that are scheduled to occur within 5 seconds of each other.

## Linux 6.14 with Rust: “We are almost at the ‘write a real driver in Rust’ stage now”

date: 2025-01-29, from: OS News

With the Linux 6.13 kernel, Greg Kroah-Hartman described the level of Rust support as a &#8220;tipping point&#8221; for Rust drivers with more of the Rust infrastructure having been merged. Now for the Linux 6.14 kernel, Greg describes the state of the Rust driver possibilities as &#8220;almost at the &#8220;write a real driver in rust&#8221; stage now, depending on what you want to do.&#8220; ↫ Michael Larabel Excellent news, as there&#8217;s a lot of interest in Rust, and it seems that allowing developers to write drivers for Linux in Rust will make at least some new and upcoming drivers comes with less memory safety issues than non-Rust drivers. I&#8217;m also quite sure this will anger absolutely nobody.

## OpenAI doesn’t like it when you use “their” generated slop without permission

date: 2025-01-29, from: OS News

OpenAI says it has found evidence that Chinese artificial intelligence start-up DeepSeek used the US company’s proprietary models to train its own open-source competitor, as concerns grow over a potential breach of intellectual property. ↫ Cristina Criddle and Eleanor Olcott for the FT This is more ironic than writing a song called Ironic that lists situations that aren&#8217;t actually ironic. OpenAI claims it&#8217;s free to suck up whatever content and data it can find on the web without any form of permission or consent, but throws a tamper tantrum when someone takes whatever they regurgitate for their own use without permission or consent? Cry me a river.

## Google Maps is run by cowards

date: 2025-01-28, from: OS News

Google, on its Google Maps naming policy, back in 2008: By saying &#8220;common&#8221;, we mean to include names which are in widespread daily use, rather than giving immediate recognition to any arbitrary governmental re-naming. In other words, if a ruler announced that henceforth the Pacific Ocean would be named after her mother, we would not add that placemark unless and until the name came into common usage. Google, today, in 2025: Google has confirmed that Google Maps will soon rename the Gulf of Mexico and Denali mountain in Alaska as the “Gulf of America” and “Mount McKinley” in line with changes implemented by the Trump Administration, but users in the rest of the world may see two names for these locations. Nothing is worth less than the word of a corporation.

## Reviving a dead audio format: the return of ZZM

date: 2025-01-28, from: OS News

Long-time readers will know that my first video game love was the text-mode video game slash creation studio ZZT. One feature of this game is the ability to play simple music through the PC speaker, and back in the day, I remember that the format “ZZM” existed, so you could enjoy the square wave tunes outside of the games. But imagine my surprise in 2025 to find that, while the Museum of ZZT does have a ZZM Audio section, it recommends that nobody use the format anymore; because nobody’s made a player that doesn’t require MS-DOS. Let’s fix that by making a player with way higher system requirements, using everyone’s favorite coding environment: Javascript. ↫ Nicole Branagan ZZM&#8217;s history and Branagan&#8217;s journey to make this work without having to rely on DOS took a lot more work than I expected, and is quite interesting, too. Very niche, for sure, but that&#8217;s kind of what we&#8217;re here for.

## The invalid 68030 instruction that accidentally allowed the Mac Classic II to successfully boot up

date: 2025-01-28, from: OS News

A bug in the ROM for the Macintosh II was recently discovered that causes a crash when booting in 32-bit mode. Doug Brown discovered and documented the bug while playing with the MAME debugger. Why did it never show up before? It seems a quirk in Motorola&#8217;s 68030 CPU inadvertently fixes it when executing an illegal instruction that shouldn&#8217;t have been executed in the first place. What follows is his process for investigating the room on emulated hardware, and then testing it on actual hardware.

Those are all valuable areas of effort that can contribute to achieving extended flight, but Albatross approaches the problem from a new angle and seeks to develop weather forecast-informed mission planning and real-time onboard sensing of dynamic wind conditions across multiple environments to harness energy from winds to offset the total power of the system required for flight.&nbsp;</p><p>This additional energy harvested from the wind reduces average power and allows the system to fly farther and longer. Aircraft soaring capabilities can be summarized as the active harnessing of energy from the natural environment’s atmospheric flow field to reduce the onboard power demand to enable increased range and endurance.&nbsp;</p><p>Albatross is <strong>not </strong>a dedicated airframe or aircraft design effort.&nbsp;</p><p>The program is not focused on lowering the drag of the airframe or providing the highest energy density source. Rather, the focus is on developing and integrating planning tools, additional aircraft sensors, and unique control solutions applied to existing or otherwise quickly assembled small uncrewed aircraft to autonomously plan for, identify and respond to soaring conditions.&nbsp;</p><p>Success is defined as capitalizing on soaring conditions to extend range and endurance in an operationally relevant manner.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div>

## PebbleOS becomes open source, new Pebble device announced

date: 2025-01-27, from: OS News

Eric Migicovsky, founder of Pebble, the original smartwatch maker, made a major announcement today together with Google. Pebble was originally bought by Fitbit and in turn Fitbit was then bought by Google, but Migicovsky always wanted to to go back to his original idea and create a brand new smartwatch. PebbleOS took dozens of engineers working over 4 years to build, alongside our fantastic product and QA teams. Reproducing that for new hardware would take a long time. Instead, we took a more direct route &#8211; I asked friends at Google (which bought Fitbit, which had bought Pebble’s IP) if they could open source PebbleOS. They said yes! Over the last year, a team inside Google (including some amazing ex-Pebblers turned Googlers) has been working on this. And today is the day &#8211; the source code for PebbleOS is now available at github.com/google/pebble (see their blog post). ↫ Eric Migicovsky Of course, this is amazing news for the still-thriving community of Pebble users who have kept the platform and their devices going through sheer force of will, but it also means Pebble is going to making a comeback in a more official capacity: alongside the announcement of PebbleOS becoming open source, there&#8217;s also the unveiling of rePebble, a brand new Pebble watch that retains all of the popular features and specifications of the original devices. It&#8217;ll run the open source PebbleOS, of course, and will be compatible with the existing ecosystem of applications. I&#8217;ve never had a Pebble, but there&#8217;s no denying the company hit on something valuable, and I know people who still rock their original Pebble devices to this day. The excitement about this announcement is palpable, and I&#8217;m pleasantly surprised Google cared enough to work on making an open source PebbleOS a reality (I know of quite a few other companies sitting on deeply loved code and IP rotting away in obscurity). I can&#8217;t wait to see what the new device will look like!

## Chinese researchers just built an open-source rival to ChatGPT in 2 months, and Silicon Valley is freaked out

date: 2025-01-27, from: OS News

Speaking of &#8220;AI&#8221;, the Chinese company DeepSeek has lobbed a grenade dead-centre into the middle of the &#8220;AI&#8221; bubble, and it&#8217;s been incredibly entertaining to watch. DeepSeek has released several new &#8220;AI&#8221; models, which seem to rival or even surpass OpenAI&#8217;s latest ChatGPT models &#8211; but with a massive twist: DeepSeek, being Chinese, can&#8217;t use NVIDIA&#8217;s latest GPUs, and as such, was forced to work within very tight constraints. They&#8217;ve managed to surpass ChatGPT&#8217;s best models with a fraction of the GPU horsepower, and thus a fraction of the cost, and a fraction of the energy requirements. But unlike ChatGPT&#8217;s o1, DeepSeek is an &#8220;open-weight&#8221; model that (although its training data remains proprietary) enables users to peer inside and modify its algorithm. Just as important is its reduced price for users — 27 times less than o1. Besides its performance, the hype around DeepSeek comes from its cost efficiency; the model&#8217;s shoestring budget is minuscule compared with the tens of millions to hundreds of millions that rival companies spent to train its competitors. ↫ Ben Turner at LiveScience The fallout has been disastrous for NVIDIA, in particular. The company&#8217;s stock price tumbled 17% today, and more entertaining yet, the various massive investments of hundreds of billions of dollars into western &#8220;AI&#8221; seem like a huge waste of money. The DeepSeek models are also nominally open source, and are clearly showing that most likely, there simply isn&#8217;t a huge &#8220;AI&#8221; market worth hundreds of billions of dollars dollars at all. On top of that, the US is clearly not ahead in &#8220;AI&#8221; at all, as was the common wisdom pretty much until yesterday. Of course, DeepSeek is Chinese, and that means censorship &#8211; the real kind &#8211; is a thing. Asking the latest DeepSeek model about the massacre at Tiananmen Square returns nothing, suggesting the user ask about other topics instead. I&#8217;m sure over the coming weeks more and more or these kinds of censorship will be discovered, but hopefully its open source nature will allow the models to be adapted and changed to remove such censorship. Do note that all of these &#8220;AI&#8221; models are all deeply biased because they&#8217;re trained on content that is itself deeply biased, thereby perpetuating and amplifying damaging stereotypes and inaccuracies, especially since people have a tendency to assume computers can&#8217;t be biased. Whatever may happen, at least OpenAI losing its job to &#8220;AI&#8221; is hilarious.

## AI bots paralyze Linux news site and others

date: 2025-01-27, from: OS News

Apparently, since the beginning of the year, AI bots have been ensuring that websites can only respond to regular inquiries with a delay. The founder of Linux Weekly News (LWN-net), Jonathan Corbet, reports that the news site is therefore often slow to respond. The AI scraper bots cause a DDoS, a distributed denial-of-service attack. At times, the AI bots would clog the lines with hundreds of IP addresses simultaneously as soon as they decided to access the site&#8217;s content. Corbet explains on Mastodon that only a small proportion of the traffic currently serves real human readers. ↫ Dirk Knop at Heise.de I&#8217;m sure someone will tell me we just have to accept that a large percentage of our bandwidth is going to overpriced bullshit generators, and that we should just suck it up and pay for Sam Altman&#8217;s new house. I hope these same people realise &#8220;AI&#8221; is destroying the last vestiges of the internet that haven&#8217;t fallen victim to all the other techbro fads so far, and that sooner rather than later there won&#8217;t be anything left to browse to. The coming few years are going to be fun.
