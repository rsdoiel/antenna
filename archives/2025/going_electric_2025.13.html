Hyundai took its smaller electric SUV and injected it with fun upgrades.
Meet the Insteroid EV —
<a href="https://electrek.co/guides/hyundai/">Hyundai’s </a>“Dream Car.”
The concept car has sporty design elements like an added wing spoiler, a
widened stance, and more. Like the IONIQ 5 N, it will make you feel like
you’re in a real sports car. It even has an added Drift Mode.
