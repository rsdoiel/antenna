This white Hyundai IONIQ 5 is single-handedly rewriting the rules on EV
longevity by driving over 360,000 miles on its original battery. What’s
even wilder? The battery still had 87% battery health,
<a href="https://www.recurrentauto.com/research/impacts-of-fast-charging" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">despite
the owner exclusively using DC fast charging to charge the car to
100%</a>.

<p>
That was more than 50,000 miles ago, <strong>and the car is still going
strong</strong>!

<p>
Porsche is launching a new EV battery recycling pilot to recover
valuable raw materials from its cars’ high-voltage battery packs at the
end of their useful life in vehicles. The new pilot hopes to develop a
“closed-loop” raw material cycle that would have new batteries made from
old batteries without the need for new, high carbon cost mineral mining.
