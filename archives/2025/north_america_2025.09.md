## Your questions about government economic data answered

date: 2025-03-06, from: Market Place, Make me Smart

<p>Donald Trump administration officials disbanded two expert committees on economic data this week and suggested altering the way the U.S. calculates gross domestic product. It’s not the first time the administration has hinted at fiddling with important numbers, and a listener wrote in to ask how all this might impact businesses and the market. We&#8217;ll break it down. Plus, why is nobody talking about the debt limit? And, congrats to Bill in Ohio on scoring a hat trick!</p>

## Angel City FC and the rise of women’s pro soccer

date: 2025-03-05, from: Market Place, Make me Smart

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The National Women&#8217;s Soccer League&#8217;s regular season kicks off next week. And thanks in part to a record-breaking <a href="https://www.nwslsoccer.com/news/nwsl-announces-landmark-media-partnerships-with-cbs-sports-espn-prime-video-and-scripps-sports">media rights agreement</a> and the growth of women&#8217;s professional sports across the board, the league is gaining more attention — and investment — than ever. Angel City Football Club became the highest-valued women&#8217;s sports team in the world last year when Willow Bay and Bob Iger acquired a controlling stake in the franchise for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5642755/2024/07/17/angel-city-new-ownership-willow-bay-bob-iger/">$250 million.</a> Julie Uhrman, the team&#8217;s CEO and co-founder, says Angel City is just the beginning. On the show today, Uhrman explains how she and her co-founders got investors to see their vision, why a game day experience that leaves you with FOMO is key to Angel City&#8217;s growth, and how to watch the NWSL&#8217;s season.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Later, how proposed funding cuts at the National Institutes of Health could leave a generational impact on the United States&#8217; reputation as a science leader. And Adam Grant, host of the &#8220;Re:Thinking&#8221; podcast, answers the Make Me Smart question.</p>
