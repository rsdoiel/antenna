## Angel City FC and the rise of women’s pro soccer

date: 2025-03-05, from: Market Place, Make me Smart

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The National Women&#8217;s Soccer League&#8217;s regular season kicks off next week. And thanks in part to a record-breaking <a href="https://www.nwslsoccer.com/news/nwsl-announces-landmark-media-partnerships-with-cbs-sports-espn-prime-video-and-scripps-sports">media rights agreement</a> and the growth of women&#8217;s professional sports across the board, the league is gaining more attention — and investment — than ever. Angel City Football Club became the highest-valued women&#8217;s sports team in the world last year when Willow Bay and Bob Iger acquired a controlling stake in the franchise for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5642755/2024/07/17/angel-city-new-ownership-willow-bay-bob-iger/">$250 million.</a> Julie Uhrman, the team&#8217;s CEO and co-founder, says Angel City is just the beginning. On the show today, Uhrman explains how she and her co-founders got investors to see their vision, why a game day experience that leaves you with FOMO is key to Angel City&#8217;s growth, and how to watch the NWSL&#8217;s season.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Later, how proposed funding cuts at the National Institutes of Health could leave a generational impact on the United States&#8217; reputation as a science leader. And Adam Grant, host of the &#8220;Re:Thinking&#8221; podcast, answers the Make Me Smart question.</p>

## What is an economy of caution?

<p>Today, we&#8217;re talking about one of Kai&#8217;s favorite topics: bonds!
