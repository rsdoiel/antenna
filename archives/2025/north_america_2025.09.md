<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Today, we&#8217;re talking about one of Kai&#8217;s favorite topics: bonds! The yield on the 10-year Treasury note (the benchmark for mortgages and car loans) is down sharply, which is great for consumers. But it&#8217;s happening for not necessarily great reasons. We&#8217;ll explain. Plus, why Kimberly is keeping a close eye on one of her go-to government websites. And, she&#8217;ll share tales from her trip to Venice’s famed carnival.</p>
