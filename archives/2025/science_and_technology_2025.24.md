## LibreOffice 25.8 removes support for Windows 7, 8, and 8.1

date: 2025-06-15, from: OS News

Are you still using Windows 7, 8, 8.1, or a 32 bit version of Windows, relying on LibreOffice for your sexy office tasks of writing TPS reports and calculating and tabulating juicy, plump numbers? Bad news: the next version of LibreOffice will remove support for these platforms. Buried deep in the release notes of the second beta for LibreOffice 25.8, it reads: Support for Windows 7 and 8/8.1 was removed. Support for x86 (32-bit) Windows builds is deprecated. ↫ LibreOffice 25.8 beta 2 release notes I honestly doubt many people actually still rely on LibreOffice on these platforms, and even if for some unfathomable reason you do, you are probably also okay with sticking with an older version of LibreOffice to keep your weird setup going a few years longer. You do you.

## An excuse to mention Void Linux: XBPS 0.60 released

date: 2025-06-15, from: OS News

Since Void Linux uses a rolling release model, there&#8217;s not much to report on in the form of new releases and major new features, so I&#8217;m taking the release of version 0.60 of XBPS, Void Linux&#8217; package manager, to cheat my way into talking about this excellent Linux distribution. I always think of Void as the &#8220;BSD of Linux distributions&#8221;, which should give you some vague hint as to what it&#8217;s going for. XBPS 0.60 doesn&#8217;t come packed with major new features either, and mostly fixes a ton of bugs, addresses few memory leaks, and changes the way held dependencies and directory removal/creation works when reinstalling a packages, just to name a few. There&#8217;s also some performance improvements, as there were apparently some problems in that department due to the increasing number of virtual packages in the Void repository. If you&#8217;re looking for a more traditional, hands-on Linux distribution, Void is an excellent choice. It&#8217;s my back-up for if (let&#8217;s face it: when) Fedora messes something up.
