Mesoscale Discussion 1153
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0354 PM CDT Fri Jun 06 2025

Areas affected...eastern New Mexico and portions of Southwestern
Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 062054Z - 062300Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Supercells capable of large to very large hail, damaging
winds, and a couple of tornadoes likely this afternoon and evening.

DISCUSSION...Recent satellite imagery shows deepening cu across the
dryline and high terrain of eastern New Mexico. Dew points in this
region are in the upper 50s to 60s with MLCIN slowly eroding across
far southeastern New Mexico where temperatures are in the 90s.
Trends would suggest convective initiation may be delayed from
timing in most CAM guidance but should occur over the next couple of
hours. 

Strong deep layer shear around 50-55 kts will promote supercells
initially capable of large to very large hail and damaging wind.
Through time this evening, storms will be moving into a very
unstable and strongly sheared air mass across southwestern Texas. As
the low-level jet strengthens, an increase in hodograph curvature
and increasing 0-1 km SRH will likely lead to an increase in tornado
potential. A watch will likely be needed this afternoon/evening to
cover this threat.

Mesoscale Discussion 1152
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0347 PM CDT Fri Jun 06 2025

Areas affected...Eastern Kentucky

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 377...

Valid 062047Z - 062145Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 377
continues.

SUMMARY...The wind-damage threat appears to be diminishing, and the
watch may be canceled prior to 23z.

DISCUSSION...The earlier convective band has shown consistent signs
of weakening, with reduced echo tops, reflectivity and lightning
flash rates.  Though moderate buoyancy persists downstream from the
storms into eastern KY, the lack of additional surface heating
(clouds and later afternoon sun angle) and relatively weak vertical
shear suggest that any substantial/sustained uptick in storm
intensity is unlikely.  Thus, if recent trends persist, the watch
could be canceled prior to the 23z expiration.

Mesoscale Discussion 1151
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0329 PM CDT Fri Jun 06 2025

Areas affected...Western Kentucky and northern parts of
western/middle Tennessee

Concerning...Tornado Watch 376...

Valid 062029Z - 062130Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 376 continues.

SUMMARY...The threat for occasional wind damage and a couple of
tornadoes continues.

DISCUSSION...An increasingly complex surface pattern is evolving
within tornado watch 376, as a result of multiple bands/clusters of
storms and associated rain-cooled outflow.  The convective clusters
are occurring east of a remnant MCV approaching the lower OH Valley,
on the northern edge of an unstable warm sector.  Regional VWPs show
40-50 kt midlevel flow with the MCV (and associated deep-layer
vertical shear), but thus far low-level hodograph curvature/SRH has
remained somewhat limited where the majority of the convection is
occurring.  There is still some potential for embedded circulations
with an attendant tornado threat where favorable storm/boundary
interactions occur.

Mesoscale Discussion 1150
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0310 PM CDT Fri Jun 06 2025

Areas affected...Eastern Tennessee...northeast Alabama and far
northwest Georgia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 062010Z - 062145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered thunderstorms with isolated wind damage and/or
marginally severe hail will persist for the next few hours, but the
need for a watch is uncertain.

DISCUSSION...Scattered thunderstorms have formed in the unstable
warm sector from northern AL into middle and eastern TN.  This area
of convection is removed to the east-southeast of the remnant MCV
over southeast MO, and local VWPs show correspondingly weak
flow/vertical shear.  Some loose clustering of storms may occur with
outflow mergers through late afternoon/evening, but it is not clear
that any organized clusters will emerge from the storm mergers. 
Thus, it is not clear that a severe thunderstorm watch is necessary.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 378
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
145 PM MDT Fri Jun 6 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  East-Central and Southeast Colorado

* Effective this Friday afternoon and evening from 145 PM until
  900 PM MDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A couple tornadoes possible
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 3.5
    inches in diameter likely
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 75
    mph possible

SUMMARY...Widely scattered are forecast to develop this afternoon
near Interstate 25 and intensify as this activity moves east into
the plains.  A few supercells are likely with the more intense
supercells potentially capable of very large hail up to 3.5 inches
in diameter.  The risk for a couple of tornadoes appears greatest
during the late afternoon into the early evening when low-level
shear will strengthen.  The threat for severe gusts will probably
become more prevalent this evening as storms increase in coverage.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 70 statute miles
east and west of a line from 35 miles north of Limon CO to 40 miles
west southwest of Springfield CO. For a complete depiction of the
watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU8).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

Mesoscale Discussion 1143
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0746 AM CDT Fri Jun 06 2025

Areas affected...Eastern Oklahoma far southern Mississippi...and
northwest Arkansas

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 375...

Valid 061246Z - 061415Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 375
continues.

SUMMARY...A damaging wind/tornado threat should persist for a few
more hours.

DISCUSSION...A line of storms continues to produce sporadic
damaging/severe wind gusts with occasional mesovorticies and line
embedded tornadoes. Only around 1000 to 1500 J/kg MUCAPE exists
ahead of the line now. In addition, a 40 knot low-level jet which
helped to maintain the MCS through the overnight period remains
across eastern Oklahoma and far western Arkansas with a weaker
low-level jet across central Arkansas and southern Missouri.
Therefore, as storms continue to move east of the stronger low-level
jet and the low-level jet weakens through the morning, expect this
line of storms to weaken within the weak to moderately unstable
environment.

In the meantime, a 35 knot low-level jet from the KSRX VWP and >200
m2/s2 will continue to support a severe wind/embedded tornado threat
in the near term before this weakening becomes more prevalent by
mid-morning.

Mesoscale Discussion 1130
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0351 PM CDT Thu Jun 05 2025

Areas affected...Parts of the Texas Trans-Pecos

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 368...

Valid 052051Z - 052215Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 368
continues.

SUMMARY...Risk of very large hail continues across parts of the
Texas Trans-Pecos.

DISCUSSION...Splitting supercells are ongoing across the TX
Trans-Pecos -- in an environment with long/fairly straight
hodographs (around 40-50 kt of effective shear) and 2000-3000 J/kg
MLCAPE. Given the continued splitting/semi-discrete mode, very large
hail (3+ inches) remains the primary concern. In particular, a
large/persistent supercell cluster undergoing additional storm
merging west of Fort Stockton should pose a risk of very large hail
and severe wind gusts -- especially given recent signs of southward
propagation.

0346 PM CDT Thu Jun 05 2025

Areas affected...far eastern NM...TX South Plains

Concerning...Tornado Watch 367...

Valid 052046Z - 052245Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 367 continues.

SUMMARY...Supercell hail and tornado potential increasing through 23
UTC.  A strong tornado or two is probable once a dominant
right-moving supercell becomes established.

DISCUSSION...Visible-satellite/radar mosaic shows the
outflow/differential heating zone and maturing updrafts becoming
sustained along the boundary.  Enhanced storm-relative environmental
helicity (SRH) and elongated hodographs and a very unstable airmass
will strongly favor discrete supercell development.  Giant hail is
forecast over the next 1-3 hours with the stronger supercells (3 to
4 inches in diameter).  The tornado risk will markedly increase over
the next 0.5 to 2 hours as storms begin to propagate within the
moist boundary layer with backed low-level flow and enlarged
hodographs.

Mesoscale Discussion 1128

0333 PM CDT Thu Jun 05 2025

Areas affected...Parts of southwest Kansas

Concerning...Tornado Watch 369...

Valid 052033Z - 052200Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 369 continues.

SUMMARY...Risk of very large hail continues with an eastward-moving
supercell in far southwest KS. Tornado risk may be increasing as
well.

DISCUSSION...Ahead of a weak lee cyclone and surface boundary over
far southeastern CO, a supercell has evolved over far southwest KS.
A long/mostly straight hodograph (around 50 kt of 0-6 km shear) per
DDC VWP and moderate surface-based instability should continue to
favor large to very large hail and locally severe gusts with this
activity. Ahead of this storm, visible satellite imagery still shows
billow cloud structures -- indicating antecedent boundary-layer
static stability. However, the associated sheltered boundary layer
should be accompanied by enhanced low-level SRH, and given the
established mesocyclone, the tornado risk may be increasing.

Mesoscale Discussion 1127
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0320 PM CDT Thu Jun 05 2025

Areas affected...southeast OH...northern WV...southwest PA

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 052020Z - 052215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Strong to locally severe gusts capable of wind damage may
focus across southeast OH eastward into northern portions of WV and
southwest PA through 7-8pm EDT.

DISCUSSION...An MCV evident in radar imagery has moved
north-northeastward across western OH and another portion of this
mid-level vorticity maximum is moving east across south-central OH. 
The southern portion of this larger-scale convective-aided
disturbance is likely acting to enhance thunderstorm development
across the eastern 1/3rd of OH late this afternoon.  Surface
conditions ahead of the storm activity in southeast OH have warmed
into the lower 80s with dewpoints in the lower 60s.  Objective
analysis data shows around 1000 J/kg MLCAPE but effective shear at
or below 20 kt.  As a result, storm organization potential will
likely remain limited in terms of more organized multicellular
modes.  However, the MCV may act to focus thunderstorms and an
isolated risk for damaging gusts for the next several hours across
parts of the upper OH Valley.

Mesoscale Discussion 1126
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0306 PM CDT Thu Jun 05 2025

Areas affected...Parts of central Oklahoma

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 052006Z - 052200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...The risk of severe wind gusts and large hail could
continue spreading eastward across central Oklahoma this afternoon.
Trends are being monitored for a possible downstream watch.

DISCUSSION...A cluster of storms has become increasingly organized
as it tracks eastward along a boundary across west-central OK, as it
interacts with a warm/moist air mass amid 40 kt of effective shear.
While an earlier ACARS sounding from OKC and mesoanalysis suggest
lingering inhibition ahead of the ongoing cluster of storms,
continued diurnal heating amid upper 60s dewpoints and modestly
steep lapse rates could support the maintenance of these storms with
eastward extent across central OK through the afternoon. If this
were to occur, the 40 kt of effective shear would continue to
promote an organized cluster (and possibly embedded supercell
structure) -- capable of severe winds gusts and large hail.
Convective trends are being monitored for a possible watch
downstream of Severe Thunderstorm Watch 366.

Mesoscale Discussion 1125
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0245 PM CDT Thu Jun 05 2025

Areas affected...Parts of northeastern NM into the far western OK/TX
Panhandles

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 051945Z - 052145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...The risk of severe storms capable of producing large hail
and severe wind gusts will increase over the next few hours. The
tornado threat could eventually increase with east-southeastward
extent.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms are developing along a wind shift over
northeastern NM this afternoon. Ahead of these evolving storms,
upper 50s to lower 60s dewpoints are contributing to moderate
surface-based instability -- given steep midlevel lapse rates.
Around 50 kt of effective shear (characterized by a long/straight
hodograph) oriented parallel to the zone of low-level ascent should
support a few supercell clusters as they move east-southeast into
the increasingly unstable air. Initial storms will pose a risk of
very large hail and severe wind gusts. The severe risk becomes more
uncertain with southeastward extent into the western TX Panhandle.
However, if storms can mature into this region, enhanced low-level
helicity would favor an increasing tornado threat as well. Trends
are being monitored for a possible watch over the area.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 371
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
350 PM CDT Thu Jun 5 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Central Oklahoma

* Effective this Thursday afternoon and evening from 350 PM until
  800 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...A cluster of storms with embedded bowing/supercell
structures will likely persist while moving east-southeastward
through central Oklahoma (especially the southern half of the OKC
metro).  Damaging gusts of 60-70 mph and large hail up to 1.5 inches
in diameter will be possible.

Mesoscale Discussion 1124
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0206 PM CDT Thu Jun 05 2025

Areas affected...Parts of the southern Great Basin and Southwest

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 051906Z - 052130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Sporadic severe downbursts are possible with high-based
thunderstorms through the afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Widely scattered high-based thunderstorms are evolving
across the southern Great Basin into the Southwest. Diurnal heating
beneath steep midlevel lapse rates (sampled by the 12Z VEF sounding)
and sufficient midlevel moisture are yielding a weakly unstable air
mass. While weak deep-layer flow/shear should generally limit storm
longevity/organization, enhanced evaporative cooling amid the steep
low-level lapse rates will support strong to severe downbursts with
the stronger cores. Severe-gust potential will be maximized with any
small clusters that can develop.

The initial supercells could produce very large hail of 3-4 inches
in diameter, with an increasing threat for tornadoes (a couple of
which could be strong) as the storms interact with a residual
outflow boundary.  There will also be some potential for upscale
growth by this evening, with the potential for severe outflow winds
up to 75 mph.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 95 statute miles
north and south of a line from 70 miles east southeast of Lubbock TX
to 70 miles north of Carlsbad NM. For a complete depiction of the
watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU7).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 366...

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 4 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 70 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 600. Mean
storm motion vector 27020.

Mesoscale Discussion 1113
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0355 PM CDT Wed Jun 04 2025

Areas affected...Parts of the Texas Trans-Pecos

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 042055Z - 042300Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated large hail and locally severe gusts will be
possible if storms can mature over the Trans-Pecos region this
afternoon.

DISCUSSION...The latest visible satellite imagery shows deepening
boundary-layer cumulus where a stationary front is intersecting the
higher terrain in the TX Trans-Pecos region this afternoon. Isolated
convective initiation is also underway along the TX/MX border. While
weak large-scale ascent and antecedent inhibition cast uncertainty
on storm longevity (especially away from the higher terrain
features), a long/straight hodograph (around 40-50 kt of effective
shear) and moderate-strong buoyancy will conditionally support a
discrete/semi-discrete supercell or two capable of producing large
hail and locally severe gusts. Given the conditional and potentially
localized nature of the threat, a watch is not expected.

Mesoscale Discussion 1112
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0143 PM CDT Wed Jun 04 2025

Areas affected...Parts of southeast Missouri into southern/central
Illinois

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 041843Z - 042115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated strong to severe storms are possible through the
afternoon. The primary concern is locally damaging wind gusts.

DISCUSSION...Widely scattered thunderstorms are evolving
northeastward across southeastern MO -- within a zone of
differential heating along/ahead of the cold front. Despite poor
midlevel lapse rates, heating within cloud breaks amid upper
60s/lower 70s dewpoints is yielding sufficient (albeit weak)
surface-based instability. While deep-layer shear is modest across
the region (20-30 kt of effective shear), small, clockwise-curved
hodographs could still support localized convective organization
into clusters and transient supercell structures. The primary
concern is locally damaging wind gusts, especially with any
localized clustering, though a brief/weak tornado cannot be entirely
ruled out with any mini supercells that can evolve. Given the
expected localized nature of the severe threat, a watch is not
expected.

Mesoscale Discussion 1094
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0344 PM CDT Tue Jun 03 2025

Areas affected...North-central Missouri

Concerning...Tornado Watch 359...

Valid 032044Z - 032145Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 359 continues.

SUMMARY...The greatest short-term threat for severe wind gusts,
large hail, and a tornado or two will exist in north-central
Missouri in WW 359.

DISCUSSION...A mature QLCS recently impacted the Kansas City metro
and vicinity and is continuing eastward through WW 359. A
consolidated bow echo is present at the northern extent of the line
(currently approaching Linn County), with a more outflow-dominated
signature present with southward extent. Both areas should continue
to pose a threat for severe wind gusts over the next couple of
hours. Periods of stronger low-level rotation were observed
recently, and some re-intensification is possible given locally
stronger low-level shear. Some semi-discrete cells have also formed
in a convergent zone ahead of the QLCS, which will pose a locally
greater threat for large hail in the short term.

Mesoscale Discussion 1093
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0339 PM CDT Tue Jun 03 2025

Areas affected...portions of eastern IL and northwest IL

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 032039Z - 032245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Severe potential will increase over the next couple of
hours. A new watch downstream from Tornado Watch 359 may be needed
late this afternoon across parts of eastern IA into northwest IL.

DISCUSSION...Airmass recovery has slowly occurred across eastern IA
into northwest IL in the wake of morning convection. Temperatures
have warmed into the upper 70s to low 80s, and dewpoints from 66-72
F are contributing to increasing MLCAPE. With time, vertical shear
is expected to remain favorable for organized convection as the QLCS
across northern MO track east/northeast with time and additional
convection develops along a cold front oriented across eastern IA.
Damaging gusts will be the main hazard with this activity. However,
the VWP at KDVN shows some enlargement of the low-level hodograph,
due in part to a 30-40 kt 850 mb southwesterly low-level jet over
the region, which is also supporting 0-1 km SRH around 100-150
m2/s2. As such, a tornado or two also could occur in addition to
strong gusts. A downstream watch may be needed in the next couple
hours.

Mesoscale Discussion 1092
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0313 PM CDT Tue Jun 03 2025

Areas affected...central OK

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 360...

Valid 032013Z - 032215Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 360
continues.

SUMMARY...Tornado potential may be increasing across central OK.

DISCUSSION...Strong cells have developed just west of the I-35
corridor in central OK. These cells show rotation aloft and the VWP
from KTLX shows an increasing low-level hodograph with 0-1 SRH near
150 m2/s2. Backed surface winds are also noted in surface
observations, along with dewpoints in the upper 60s to low 70s F.
This is contributing to strong instability and further storm
organization and intensification is possible over the next couple of
hours as these storms track northeast across central OK and the
greater OKC Metro area, and a brief tornado or two could occur with
these developing supercells. Additionally, as storms across
southwest OK move into this environment, some tornado and damaging
risk will be possible.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 359
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
135 PM CDT Tue Jun 3 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Far Eastern Kansas
  West-Central into Northeastern Missouri

* Effective this Tuesday afternoon and evening from 135 PM until
  800 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A couple tornadoes possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...An organizing band of storms will likely move northeast
across the Watch along and north of modified outflow.  Moist low
levels and moderately strong low-level shear across the Watch will
support a risk for a couple of tornadoes.  A threat for damaging
gusts will probably accompany the stronger storms.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 55 statute miles
east and west of a line from 20 miles east northeast of Kirksville
MO to 45 miles south southeast of Olathe KS. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU9).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 60 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean
storm motion vector 24035.

Mesoscale Discussion 1078
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0348 PM CDT Mon Jun 02 2025

Areas affected...the Texas Panhandle

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 353...

Valid 022048Z - 022215Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 353
continues.

SUMMARY...An increase in convective intensity is expected over the
next 1 to 2 hours.

DISCUSSION...A well-developed outflow boundary has developed and is
emanating from storms across the western Texas Panhandle. This
outflow has mostly outrun the storms thus far. However, it is
quickly moving toward more favorable instability across the central
and eastern Panhandle. In fact, a boundary is apparent on the AMA
0.5 degree base reflectivity east of the radar which likely
represents the edge of the low 70s dewpoints across the eastern
Panhandle. 

As these boundaries collide, expect strong updrafts which should
strengthen the cold pool and severe wind gusts within the line. The
greatest threat for isolated 80-90 mph wind gusts this
afternoon/evening likely exists from this boundary collision
northeastward. This region has the most favorable diurnal timing and
the expectation for storm intensification as this line moves towards
the greater instability.

0347 PM CDT Mon Jun 02 2025

Areas affected...Northeastern Colorado northeastward through
southwestern MN

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 022047Z - 022245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm development is likely this afternoon and
evening along a cold front across much of central Nebraska and
adjacent areas. Severe wind gusts and large hail will be the main
threats.

DISCUSSION...A Cu field is developing this afternoon across central
Nebraska to the south of a slowly sagging cold front. Very large
instability is present with temperatures rising into the upper 80s
and low 90s F across the region. Continued boundary-layer mixing
should erode any remaining inhibition, supporting convection
initiating in the next couple of hours. A number of factors should
contribute to quickly amalgamating storms, including widespread
initiation, largely line-parallel (and relatively modest) bulk shear
vectors, and ML LCLs between 1500-2000 m AGL. Large hail will be
possible with the strongest cores, particularly early in individual
storms' lifecycles, with a transition to a more widespread wind
threat likely during the evening. A tornado or two cannot be ruled
out amidst possibly complex storm interactions and/or stronger
updrafts interacting with locally enhanced surface vertical
vorticity near the front. A watch is possible this afternoon to
address these threats.

Areas affected...Portions of West Texas and the Trans Pecos into
southeast New Mexico

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 022021Z - 022115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated large hail and severe wind gusts are possible
this afternoon and into this evening.

DISCUSSION...Moderate instability has developed across the Trans
Pecos and into West Texas with 1500 to 2000 J/kg MLCAPE. Some
convection has formed along the higher terrain from southeast New
Mexico to the Davis Mountains in Texas. A belt of slightly stronger
mid-level flow will overspread this region through the late
afternoon and into the evening, with RAP forecast soundings
indicating 35 to 40 knots of effective shear where southerly or
southeasterly flow remains by 23Z to 00Z. Therefore, a few
supercells are possible with a threat for large hail and severe wind
gusts. 

Large-scale forcing is mostly moving away from the region, so storm
coverage will likely remain isolated.

Mesoscale Discussion 1075
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0247 PM CDT Mon Jun 02 2025

Areas affected...eastern Colorado and western Kansas into far
southwest Nebraska.

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 021947Z - 022115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms are expected this afternoon with a primary
threat of severe wind gusts.

DISCUSSION...A gradient of instability exists across the central
High Plains with dewpoints in the 40s near the Front Range and in
the upper 60s across southwest Kansas. SPC mesoanalysis shows a
weakly unstable, but uncapped environment across southeast Colorado
where cold air associated with the upper low has started to move
east of the terrain. As heating continues and temperatures continue
to cool aloft, expect an uncapped environment across much of eastern
Colorado and western Kansas. In addition, ascent will increase as
the trough advances east. 

Therefore, expect a gradual increase in convective coverage across
northeast New Mexico and eastern Colorado this afternoon.
Eventually, these storms should become more intense as they move
toward greater instability. Some large hail is possible initially,
however, severe wind gusts will be preferred. Very steep lapse rates
will support the potential for some significant severe wind gusts of
80-90 mph this evening (in western Kansas), particularly where any
bowing line segments can develop. 

A watch will likely be needed later this afternoon for the threat
from these storms, and storms which will likely move into southwest
Kansas from watch 353.

Mesoscale Discussion 1074
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0214 PM CDT Mon Jun 02 2025

Areas affected...Southeastern Wyoming and northeastern Colorado into
western Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 021914Z - 022115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm development is likely this afternoon, posing
a threat primarily for severe wind gusts and large hail.

DISCUSSION...Congested Cu are present in visible satellite imagery
across southeastern Wyoming, especially along the higher terrain in
advance of a slowly-southward-sagging cold front. A surface low is
developing in northeastern Colorado, promoting backing southeasterly
low-level flow and some moisture advection into the area. Limited
upper-level cloudiness has supported temperatures rising into the
mid-/upper-70s across the area, likely yielding minimal convective
inhibition in the short term.

As the cold front continues to move southward and a mid-level wave
impinges on the region, scattered thunderstorm development appears
likely in the next couple hours. 12z HREF guidance depicts multiple
stronger updrafts developing off the Laramie Mountains and moving
east into a well-mixed and unstable airmass. Amidst modest bulk
shear values (~30-35 kts) and relatively straight shear profiles,
some splitting supercells and mixed-mode storms are possible. The
primary threats should be large hail and local severe wind gusts
with the stronger cores, especially as they mature in the Nebraska
Panhandle.

Additional thunderstorms are expected in western Nebraska and points
eastward as storms erupt along the cold front later this
afternoon/evening. Trends will continue to be monitored in that
region for possible MCD/watch issuance there.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 356
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
345 PM CDT Mon Jun 2 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Eastern Colorado
  Western Kansas
  Far Southwest Nebraska

* Effective this Monday afternoon and evening from 345 PM until
  1000 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Widespread damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 85
    mph likely
  Isolated very large hail events to 2 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...A few thunderstorm clusters are forecast to move into the
Watch area this afternoon and persist into the evening.  Strong
buoyancy and large surface temperature and dewpoint spreads will
favor efficient thunderstorm downdrafts capable of severe gusts. 
Large hail may accompany the stronger thunderstorm cores this
afternoon into the early evening before thunderstorm outflow becomes
more prevalent.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 90
statute miles east and west of a line from 55 miles west northwest
of Mccook NE to 45 miles west of Liberal KS. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU6).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

Mesoscale Discussion 1064
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0337 PM CDT Sun Jun 01 2025

Areas affected...Parts of central into southeast Texas

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 352...

Valid 012037Z - 012200Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 352
continues.

SUMMARY...The risk of large hail and severe wind gusts continues
across Severe Thunderstorm Watch 352.

DISCUSSION...A couple semi-discrete supercells continue to track
southeastward along the stationary boundary from central into
southeast TX -- along the east/southeastern periphery of around 2500
J/kg MLCAPE. While these storms are generally becoming removed from
this stronger instability, they will still pose a risk of isolated
large hail and locally severe gusts in the near term. To their
northwest, fresh updrafts are evolving along the stationary boundary
near Waco TX. Given that these evolving storms will track
southeastward through the strongest instability amid 40 kt of
effective shear, gradual intensification into semi-discrete
supercells is also possible -- posing a risk of large to very large
hail and severe wind gusts.

Mesoscale Discussion 1063
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0213 PM CDT Sun Jun 01 2025

Areas affected...Parts of western/central North Carolina and far
northern South Carolina

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 011913Z - 012145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Widely scattered thunderstorms are expected to continue
developing/advancing eastward across western/central NC and far
northern SC through the afternoon. The strongest storms will be
capable of producing locally damaging wind gusts and marginally
severe hail. The severe threat is expected to remain too isolated
for a watch.

DISCUSSION...Along the southern periphery of a large-scale trough
over the Northeast, VWP data and earlier 12Z soundings sampled a
belt of 40-50 kt midlevel westerly flow across NC. Here,
differential heating along a weak E/W-oriented surface boundary is
supporting isolated to widely scattered showers, which should
continue to deepening into thunderstorms -- given sufficient (albeit
weak) surface-based instability. The moderate/strong westerly flow
aloft is yielding elongated/mostly straight hodographs (around 40 kt
of effective shear), which could promote localized convective
organization into small clusters capable of locally damaging wind
gusts and perhaps marginally severe hail. Current thinking is that
the overall severe threat will remain too isolated for a watch,
though convective trends will be monitored.

Mesoscale Discussion 1062
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0153 PM CDT Sun Jun 01 2025

Areas affected...central Colorado and north-central New Mexico

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 011853Z - 012130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms will continue to develop through the
afternoon. Instability will support at least some potential for hail
and gusty thunderstorm outflows. However, the lack of stronger
deep-layer shear should limit the overall severe threat to being
more transient in nature. A watch is not likely.

DISCUSSION...Terrain-driven low-level convergence has resulted in
the development of convection across the higher terrain of central
Colorado and north-central New Mexico. To the east of the higher
terrain, surface dewpoints in the 50s coupled with diurnal heating
has resulted in a corridor of MUCAPE between 1000-2000 J/kg, with
the higher values tied to higher surface moisture. Despite
sufficient instability for storm maintenance, deep-layer shear is
weak, with effective-layer shear generally less than 20 knots should
limit the ability for updraft organization. The result should be
updrafts initially tied to the terrain, where low-level convergence
will force ascent. Isolated hail and perhaps a strong wind gust or
two may be possible with these terrain-driven storms.

With time, aggregate cold pools may move off the terrain and into
the high-elevation plains adjacent to the mountains allowing for
additional thunderstorm development. Here, continued heating will
allow most-unstable CAPE to continue to increase until convective
cloud debris overspreads the area reducing insolation. However,
MUCAPE around 2000-2500 J/kg will remain possible. Forecast
soundings indicated that some increase in effective-layer shear, but
still generally below 30 knots. This may allow for some
conglomeration of updrafts and at least transient multi-cell
clusters capable of producing large hail and a strong wind gust or
two.

Given the anticipated isolated/transient nature of any organized
severe threat (should it develop) a watch is not anticipated.

Mesoscale Discussion 1060
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0705 AM CDT Sun Jun 01 2025

Areas affected...South-central Florida Peninsula

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 011205Z - 011400Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...An isolated tornado threat may continue for the next two
to three hours across south-central Florida. The threat is expected
to remain localized, and weather watch issuance appears unlikely,
although trends will be monitored.

DISCUSSION...An east-to-west band of strong thunderstorms is ongoing
across south-central Florida, along a zone of somewhat focused
low-level convergence. The storms are being supported by a shortwave
trough that is moving through the eastern Gulf. A mid-level jet
streak is analyzed by the RAP from the eastern Gulf extending
eastward across the Florida Peninsula. This jet has strengthened
deep-layer shear over south-central Florida into the 40 to 50 knot
range, according to the RAP. This will support isolated supercell
development this morning. Although RAP forecast soundings across
south-central Florida suggest that low-level shear is not
particularly strong, storm-relative helicity could be locally higher
near the zone of low-level convergence. As a result, transient
supercells could be capable of producing low to mid-level rotation,
with a brief tornado possible. Marginally severe wind gusts could
also occur. The threat should remain localized, and watch issuance
is currently not expected.

Mesoscale Discussion 1059
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0622 AM CDT Sun Jun 01 2025

Areas affected...Southern Oklahoma...North Texas

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 351...

Valid 011122Z - 011315Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 351
continues.

SUMMARY...A few strong thunderstorms, with isolated severe gusts or
hail, will be possible over the next few hours. However, any threat
should remain localized, and weather watch issuance is not expected
to the south of the current watch.

DISCUSSION...A cluster of thunderstorms is ongoing in south-central
Oklahoma, which is near a 500 mb jet analyzed by the RAP. This
cluster will continue to move southward across the remainder of
Oklahoma into parts of north Texas over the next few hours. Any
severe threat associated with the cluster will likely remain
localized and brief, primarily due to weak instability. For this
reason, weather watch issuance is not expected to the south of the
ongoing watch. 

As the outflow boundary, associated with the cluster, stalls over
north Texas later this morning, it will likely become a focus for
new convective development. Through that time, the situation will
continue to be monitored for changes in severe weather potential.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 351
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
125 AM CDT Sun Jun 1 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Central and Southern Oklahoma

* Effective this Sunday morning from 125 AM until 900 AM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail likely with isolated very large hail events
    to 2 inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Scattered severe thunderstorms will continue to move
southeast across the watch area early this morning with a risk
mainly for damaging thunderstorm wind gusts and large hail.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 75
statute miles east and west of a line from 50 miles north of
Oklahoma City OK to 25 miles southwest of Ardmore OK. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU1).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 450. Mean storm motion vector
31035.

Mesoscale Discussion 1056
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0304 PM CDT Sat May 31 2025

Areas affected...Parts of eastern North Carolina and southeastern
Virginia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 312004Z - 312200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...A couple locally damaging wind gusts may accompany
eastward-moving thunderstorms this afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Convection is gradually deepening in the left exit
region of a west-northwesterly midlevel jet across parts of northern
NC. This activity will continue spreading eastward across eastern NC
and southeastern VA this afternoon, where steepened low/midlevel
lapse rates and a long/straight hodograph (40-50 kt of effective
shear) could support a couple small, briefly organized storm
clusters. Locally damaging wind gusts may accompany any stronger
storms that can evolve, though weak instability and a lack of
focused mesoscale ascent should limit the overall severe risk.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Alvin Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP012025
800 AM MST Sat May 31 2025
 
Cool waters, dry mid-level air, and strong vertical wind shear
have taken their toll on Alvin.  The system has been devoid of deep
convection for more than 12 hours, and has become a swirl of low- to
mid-level clouds.  The initial intensity has been lowered to a
possibly generous 30 kt.  Continued hostile environmental
conditions are expected to prevent any return of deep convection,
and therefore this will be the final advisory on the system as it
has become a post-tropical remnant low.
 
The low should continue to spin down as it moves slowly northward
today. Global model guidance indicates that the low will open up
into a trough of low pressure as it passes near the southern tip of
the Baja California Peninsula in about 24 hours.
 
Swells generated by Alvin are expected to persist along portions of
the west-central mainland Mexico and southern Baja California 
coasts through the weekend, creating potentially dangerous surf and 
rip current conditions.

There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM MST (1500 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Alvin
was located near latitude 20.7 North, longitude 109.5 West. The
post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the north near 9 mph (15
km/h).  A slightly slower northward motion is expected through 
tonight. 

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 35 mph (55 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Additional weakening is expected today and the 
low is forecast to dissipate by Sunday. 

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by this system will affect portions of the
coasts of west-central Mexico and the southern Baja California
Peninsula through the weekend. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.

Tropical Storm Alvin Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP012025
200 AM MST Sat May 31 2025
 
A collapsing area of fragmented convection is all that remains of 
Alvin's cloud pattern this morning.  The initial intensity has been 
lowered to 35 kt, between the objective intensity guidance of 32-40 
kt and closest to the TAFB T-2.5/35 kt Dvorak classification. Global 
models predict that the strong shear, dry air, and cool sea surface 
temperatures should prevent any new organized deep convection from 
forming.  Alvin is forecast to become a remnant low later today and 
dissipate on Sunday.  

Alvin is moving northward at 9 kt in the low-level flow.  This 
general motion is expected to continue through the weekend and only 
minor adjustments have been made to the latest NHC track forecast.

BULLETIN
Tropical Storm Alvin Advisory Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP012025
200 AM MST Sat May 31 2025
 
...ALVIN FORECAST TO A BECOME POST-TROPICAL REMNANT LOW LATER
TODAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 200 AM MST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...20.0N 109.3W
ABOUT 205 MI...330 KM S OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...40 MPH...65 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...N OR 350 DEGREES AT 10 MPH...17 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1005 MB...29.68 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM MST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Alvin was
located near latitude 20.0 North, longitude 109.3 West. Alvin is 
moving toward the north near 10 mph (17 km/h). A slightly slower 
northward motion is expected during the next day or so.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 40 mph (65 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Continued weakening is forecast, and Alvin is
expected to become a remnant low later today and dissipate entirely
on Sunday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by Alvin will affect portions of the coasts
of west-central and southwestern Mexico and the southern Baja
California Peninsula through the weekend. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 800 AM MST.
