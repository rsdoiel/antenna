Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0749 AM CDT Mon Jun 02 2025

Valid 021300Z - 031200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM
SOUTHERN/CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS ACROSS THE CENTRAL PLAINS INTO
SOUTHWESTERN MN...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are possible across the High Plains
into southwestern Minnesota. Severe gusts and large hail are the
expected hazards.

...Central High Plains to MN...
Early morning satellite imagery depicts a northern-stream shortwave
trough moving into western MT. Expectation is for this shortwave to
continue eastward across MT and the northern Plains today, ending
the period over far northwestern Ontario. Surface cyclogenesis is
anticipated over SD ahead of this shortwave. The resulting surface
low will track quickly northeastward into northern MN along a
seasonally strong cold front. This front, which recent surface
analysis places from northwest MN into the far northern NE
Panhandle, is expected to extend from the MN Arrowhead through
central NE by 00Z tonight. Strong heating is expected ahead of this
front, bringing temperatures into the upper 80s/low 90s from central
MN into central NE. These temperatures coupled with dewpoints in the
upper 50s to mid 60s will foster airmass destabilization, and
thunderstorm development is expected as the cold front and
large-scale forcing for ascent interacts with this destabilized
airmass.

Initial thunderstorm development is expected during the afternoon 
across MN where the strongest low-level convergence will be in
place. Dewpoints (and overall buoyancy) will be lower here than
areas farther southwest, which is expected to limit overall storm
strength and contribute to an anafrontal storm character. Late
afternoon/early evening storm development is likely farther
southwest into central NE along the wind shift. Strong buoyancy will
favor robust updrafts, but deep-layer shear will be modest. This
weaker shear coupled with linear forcing is expected to result in a
quick transition to a predominantly linear mode. As a result, some
supercell threat is possible early in the convective evolution but,
storm mergers and potential clustering/line segments favor a hail
risk transitioning rather quickly to more wind. 

Large-scale ascent could also help support another area of
thunderstorms over southeast WY and the adjacent NE Panhandle. The
strength and/or organization of these storms is uncertain, but there
is some chance they will persist long enough to interact with the
storms along front, locally enhancing the severe potential.

...Southern High Plains...
Satellite imagery shows a well-defined shortwave trough moving
across the Southwest. This shortwave is forecast to reach the
southern High Plains by late evening. Increasing large-scale ascent
will result in scattered thunderstorms across much of the region
during the afternoon and evening. Some isolated hail is possible
early, but these storms are expected to become increasingly outflow
dominant as they move into the deeply mixed airmass over the West
TX, the TX/OK Panhandles, and southwest KS. A few severe gusts are
possible.

...South FL...
Shortwave trough moving over the central Gulf Coast is forecast to
continue southeastward into the eastern Gulf, with increasing
large-scale ascent downstream across much of the FL Peninsula.  This
synoptic evolution favors a considerable amount of convection, with
scattered to widespread thunderstorms beginning as early as 18Z.
Some occasionally strong updrafts are possible, capable of both
isolated hail and damaging gusts.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0339 AM CDT Mon Jun 02 2025

Valid 051200Z - 101200Z

...DISCUSSION...
Latest guidance has trended towards a climatologically active
extended period for severe potential. It appears that 15 percent
severe areas will likely be delineated each day within a persistent
split-flow regime. Belts of enhanced mid-level westerlies should
accompany the train of low-amplitude southern-stream shortwave
impulses. Meanwhile, above-average agreement exists with the
amplification of a large-scale trough into the north-central states
towards the end of the period. This would suppress the southern
stream southward in the southern Great Plains to Deep South.

Reliably timing individual low-amplitude impulses/MCVs can be
difficult in this setup. But it appears that the initial impulse
ejecting across the southern Rockies around 12Z Thursday should
serve to focus severe potential from the TX Panhandle into southern
KS on D4. This feature may continue eastward towards the Mid-MS
Valley/eastern Midwest on D5/Friday. But with probable weak
mid-level lapse rates downstream and lack of run-to-run continuity
across guidance, will defer on a 15 percent area highlight.

Mesoscale Discussion 1064
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0337 PM CDT Sun Jun 01 2025

Areas affected...Parts of central into southeast Texas

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 352...

Valid 012037Z - 012200Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 352
continues.

SUMMARY...The risk of large hail and severe wind gusts continues
across Severe Thunderstorm Watch 352.

DISCUSSION...A couple semi-discrete supercells continue to track
southeastward along the stationary boundary from central into
southeast TX -- along the east/southeastern periphery of around 2500
J/kg MLCAPE. While these storms are generally becoming removed from
this stronger instability, they will still pose a risk of isolated
large hail and locally severe gusts in the near term. To their
northwest, fresh updrafts are evolving along the stationary boundary
near Waco TX. Given that these evolving storms will track
southeastward through the strongest instability amid 40 kt of
effective shear, gradual intensification into semi-discrete
supercells is also possible -- posing a risk of large to very large
hail and severe wind gusts.

Mesoscale Discussion 1063
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0213 PM CDT Sun Jun 01 2025

Areas affected...Parts of western/central North Carolina and far
northern South Carolina

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 011913Z - 012145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Widely scattered thunderstorms are expected to continue
developing/advancing eastward across western/central NC and far
northern SC through the afternoon. The strongest storms will be
capable of producing locally damaging wind gusts and marginally
severe hail. The severe threat is expected to remain too isolated
for a watch.

DISCUSSION...Along the southern periphery of a large-scale trough
over the Northeast, VWP data and earlier 12Z soundings sampled a
belt of 40-50 kt midlevel westerly flow across NC. Here,
differential heating along a weak E/W-oriented surface boundary is
supporting isolated to widely scattered showers, which should
continue to deepening into thunderstorms -- given sufficient (albeit
weak) surface-based instability. The moderate/strong westerly flow
aloft is yielding elongated/mostly straight hodographs (around 40 kt
of effective shear), which could promote localized convective
organization into small clusters capable of locally damaging wind
gusts and perhaps marginally severe hail. Current thinking is that
the overall severe threat will remain too isolated for a watch,
though convective trends will be monitored.

Mesoscale Discussion 1062
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0153 PM CDT Sun Jun 01 2025

Areas affected...central Colorado and north-central New Mexico

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 011853Z - 012130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms will continue to develop through the
afternoon. Instability will support at least some potential for hail
and gusty thunderstorm outflows. However, the lack of stronger
deep-layer shear should limit the overall severe threat to being
more transient in nature. A watch is not likely.

DISCUSSION...Terrain-driven low-level convergence has resulted in
the development of convection across the higher terrain of central
Colorado and north-central New Mexico. To the east of the higher
terrain, surface dewpoints in the 50s coupled with diurnal heating
has resulted in a corridor of MUCAPE between 1000-2000 J/kg, with
the higher values tied to higher surface moisture. Despite
sufficient instability for storm maintenance, deep-layer shear is
weak, with effective-layer shear generally less than 20 knots should
limit the ability for updraft organization. The result should be
updrafts initially tied to the terrain, where low-level convergence
will force ascent. Isolated hail and perhaps a strong wind gust or
two may be possible with these terrain-driven storms.

With time, aggregate cold pools may move off the terrain and into
the high-elevation plains adjacent to the mountains allowing for
additional thunderstorm development. Here, continued heating will
allow most-unstable CAPE to continue to increase until convective
cloud debris overspreads the area reducing insolation. However,
MUCAPE around 2000-2500 J/kg will remain possible. Forecast
soundings indicated that some increase in effective-layer shear, but
still generally below 30 knots. This may allow for some
conglomeration of updrafts and at least transient multi-cell
clusters capable of producing large hail and a strong wind gust or
two.

Given the anticipated isolated/transient nature of any organized
severe threat (should it develop) a watch is not anticipated.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 352
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
140 PM CDT Sun Jun 1 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  North-Central and East Texas

* Effective this Sunday afternoon and evening from 140 PM until
  1000 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail likely with isolated very large hail events
    to 2.5 inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Severe storms including supercell development are expected
this afternoon as a moist environment heats and destabilizes. Large
hail is expected with the most intense storms, with wind damage also
possible as these storms generally spread southeastward through
early/mid-evening.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 70
statute miles east and west of a line from 30 miles north of
Stephenville TX to 75 miles south southeast of Huntsville TX. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU2).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 600. Mean storm motion vector
33025.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0256 PM CDT Sun Jun 01 2025

Valid 012000Z - 021200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PORTIONS OF
CENTRAL INTO EASTERN TEXAS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered large hail and isolated damaging winds remain possible
this afternoon and evening across central and east Texas. More
isolated severe thunderstorms are still possible across parts of the
Middle Tennessee Valley and Carolinas, High Plains, northern
Rockies, and south Florida.

...20Z Update...
Much of the previous forecast (see below) remains on track. A pair
of supercells persist across portions of eastern TX. To the
northwest of these storms resides a baroclinic boundary. Though
overall forcing for ascent is weak across the southern Plains, the
presence of the boundary, in tandem with strong diurnal heating, may
support additional strong to severe thunderstorm development across
parts of central into eastern TX. Severe gusts and large hail
(perhaps exceeding 2 inches in diameter at times) will be the main
threats.

Similarly, strong surface heating across the Middle TN Valley into
the Carolinas, central High Plains, and northern Rockies, will
support strong storm development through the afternoon, with severe
hail/wind the primary hazards. Scattered thunderstorm development is
ongoing across central and southern parts of the FL Peninsula, and a
couple instances of hail/strong wind gusts remain possible for at
least a few more hours.

..Squitieri.. 06/01/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1138 AM CDT Sun Jun 01 2025/

...Central/East Texas...
A residual small cluster of storms has persisted through late
morning across northeast Texas. Additional and increasingly
surface-based storm development will be possible this afternoon,
particularly into mid/late afternoon. This will be focused where
outflow/differential heating influences interface with an
increasingly unstable (2500+ J/kg MLCAPE) environment near a
northwest/southeast-oriented synoptic boundary and related
instability gradient. Northwesterly deep-layer shear of 35-40 kt
will be sufficient for organized storms, including supercells,
posing a risk for large hail and potentially damaging wind gusts. A
sustained storm interacting with residual/modifying outflow could
have some tornado potential in the presence of locally-augmented
low-level shear. These storms may cluster later today, or otherwise
persist south-southeastward toward east-central/southeast Texas
through early and mid-evening including the I-35/I-45 corridors.

...Tennessee to the Carolinas...
Despite relatively modest low-level moisture, diurnal heating
combined with seasonably cool temperatures aloft associated with a
deep upper-level trough will allow for weak to moderate
destabilization ahead of a weak surface wave and advancing front. 
Isolated to scattered storm development is expected this afternoon,
with somewhat greater coverage expected with eastward extent
centered on parts of North Carolina. Modestly favorable effective
shear (generally 25-30 kt) may support occasionally organized storms
capable of isolated damaging wind and hail. Any longer-lived
clusters could pose a more concentrated wind-damage threat.

...Northern Rockies and northern High Plains...
A mid/upper-level shortwave trough will move eastward from the
Pacific Northwest toward the northern Rockies by this evening. Weak
to locally moderate buoyancy and increasing deep-layer shear will
support the potential for somewhat organized cells/clusters with an
attendant threat of isolated severe gusts and hail. This development
should generally focus near the Montana/Idaho/Wyoming border
vicinity as well as near/east of the Bighorns.

...South Florida...
Influenced by moderately strong westerlies aloft, some
strong/locally severe storms may remain possible today along and
south of a boundary that has been effectively reinforced by early
day storms.

...Eastern Colorado/New Mexico...
Scattered storms are again expected this afternoon and evening along
and east of the higher terrain in eastern Colorado/New Mexico. While
deep-layer flow/shear will be relatively modest, guidance suggests
some increase in low-level moisture and instability by afternoon.
Initial storms could pose a threat for isolated hail and strong to
severe gusts. There is some potential for one or more loosely
organized clusters to develop by evening and spread eastward with
strong to locally severe outflow winds. 

...Southern California into southern/central Arizona...
A mid/upper-level cyclone will move northeastward into parts of
southern California/Arizona later today. Cool temperatures aloft
will overspread the region, but relatively widespread cloudiness and
precipitation will tend to limit destabilization. If pockets of
locally stronger heating/destabilization can develop, then a few
strong storms could occur.

...Great Basin...
High-based thunderstorms are expected to develop this afternoon from
parts of Nevada into western Utah. Buoyancy and shear are expected
to remain weak, and organized thunderstorms are not expected,
however localized strong outflow gusts will be possible within this
regime through early evening.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0228 PM CDT Sun Jun 01 2025

Valid 031200Z - 091200Z

Fire weather concerns appear limited through next weekend across the
CONUS. Long-range guidance continues to show a transition to a more
progressive upper-level pattern heading into next week with multiple
shortwave troughs propagating across the central and eastern CONUS.
This will maintain rain chances for most regions with the exception
of the West Coast/Pacific Northwest where ensemble probabilities for
wetting rainfall remain low through late next week. Despite dry
conditions, long-range solutions do not show any strong signals for
critical fire weather regimes along the West Coast/Pacific
Northwest. Elsewhere, a combination of moist fuels, upcoming rain
chances, and/or limited signals for critical wind speeds limits
confidence in fire weather concerns for any one region.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0215 PM CDT Sun Jun 01 2025

Valid 031200Z - 041200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM NORTH TEXAS
TO SOUTHERN WISCONSIN...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are possible from the southern Great
Plains to the Midwest, mainly from midday to early evening Tuesday.

...Texas to the Great Lakes...

A southern stream upper shortwave trough over the southern/central
High Plains will merge with the northern stream shortwave trough
over the northern Plains on Tuesday as both features develop
eastward toward the MS Valley. As this occurs, southwesterly flow
aloft will increase from the Mid-MS Valley to the Great Lakes, with
weaker west/southwesterly deep-layer flow extending southwestward
into the southern Plains. 

At the surface, a cold front extending from northwest WI into
central KS will develop east/southeast through the period, becoming
positioned from northern lower MI to central TX by Wednesday
morning. A 40-50 kt southwesterly low-level jet from the southern
Plains into the Great Lakes region will maintain a plume of rich
boundary layer moisture from OK/TX into WI ahead of the surface
front. However, cloud cover may limit stronger heating with
northward extent from the Mid-MS Valley into WI. As a result,
stronger instability will likely remain confined from southwest MO
into parts of OK/TX. Additionally, warm 500 mb temperatures will
result in poor lapse rates. Nevertheless, sufficient MLCAPE and
effective shear magnitudes around 25-35 kt will support isolated to
widely scattered severe storm potential from northeast MO into WI.

Further south from central/eastern KS/OK into southwest MO and
southward into parts of TX, stronger instability will be present,
but vertical shear will be more modest. As a result, storm mode may
be somewhat messy with initial cells becoming clusters quickly. As
the surface cold front develops southeast through the late afternoon
and evening, some linear segments could also develop. Damaging gusts
and hail appear to be the most probable storm hazards at this time.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0109 PM CDT Sun Jun 01 2025

Valid 021200Z - 031200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast remains on track with no changes needed.
Latest forecast guidance continues to suggest fire weather potential
will be limited across the country. Locally elevated conditions
remain possible across southeast ID and adjacent portions of
northern UT as well as the southern High Plains, but only modestly
dry fuels and rain/thunderstorm chances should mitigate fire
concerns for these regions (respectively). See the previous
discussion below for additional details.

..Moore.. 06/01/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1259 AM CDT Sun Jun 01 2025/

...Synopsis...
The main portion of cyclonic flow aloft will stay within the
northern tier of the CONUS. The upper cyclone in the Southwest will
continue east into the southern High Plains. Off the southern
California coast, another upper cyclone will slowly drift
southeastward. A surface front will push into the central/southern
Great Basin.

Fire weather concerns for most areas should remain low.
Thunderstorms are probable in the Southwest, but PW values will be
high enough to mitigate lightning ignition concerns. Dry
northwesterly winds are possible in parts of the northern Great
Basin. Locally elevated conditions are possible, but fuels are only
marginally receptive currently and winds will also be marginal. With
a surface low moving into northern California, dry northerly winds
could reach 15-20 mph during the morning in parts of the Sacramento
Valley. Fuels are only starting to cure and the strongest winds will
be offset from the lowest RH. Locally elevated conditions are
possible, however.

Valid 021200Z - 031200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE
CENTRAL/SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS TO THE NORTHERN GREAT PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are possible from the central and
southern High Plains into the northern Great Plains during the late
afternoon and evening on Monday. Severe gusts and large hail are the
expected hazards.

...Synopsis...

An upper-level split flow regime on Monday will be characterized by
a northern stream shortwave trough moving from the northern Rockies
to the northern Plains, while a southern stream shortwave trough
develops east from the Southwest into the southern/central High
Plains. At the surface, an elongated area of low pressure will
modestly deepen over the central Plains, with a lee trough extending
southward across the southern High Plains. A cold front also will be
oriented northeast to southwest from northern MN into northeast CO
by 00z. The front will develop southeast into Tuesday morning across
the Upper Midwest and central Plains. Both the surface cold front
and the southern High Plains lee trough will focus thunderstorm
activity during the afternoon/evening.

...NE/CO/WY border area to western MN...

Moderate to strong instability is expected to develop along a
somewhat narrow corridor ahead of the southeast-advancing cold front
during the afternoon. Southwesterly flow aloft will modestly
increase into the evening as height falls overspread the region.
Strong heating will promote a deeply mixed boundary amid low to mid
60s F dewpoints ahead of the front (lower dewpoints expected further
west across CO/WY/NE border area). Initial thunderstorms are likely
to develop in an upslope flow regime across the CO/WY/NE border
vicinity. High-based supercells capable of severe gusts and hail
will be possible. 

Additional storm development is likely later in the afternoon into
the evening along the cold front from central NE into MN. The
stronger southwesterly flow aloft is forecast to lag behind the
front, and developing convection may quickly move to the cool side
of the boundary given boundary-parallel wind profiles. This will
likely result in multicell clusters/linear segments capable of
producing damaging gusts and large hail in stronger embedded cores.
Instability will decrease with increasing inhibition with eastward
extent during the evening and severe potential should wane after
03-06z. 

...KS to the southern High Plains...

Widespread thunderstorm activity is expected to develop over NM/CO
in a drier and modestly unstable airmass compared to further east,
but aided by steep lapse rates and several impulses ejecting across
the southern Rockies ahead of the main upper shortwave trough.
Strong outflow winds and hail may occur with this activity as it
spreads east across the High Plains. This activity will encounter a
corridor of deeper boundary-layer moisture and strong instability
from western KS into parts of the Panhandles and western OK toward
late afternoon/early evening. At the same time, a low-level jet will
be increasing over the southern Plains. As a result, some
organization/consolidation of thunderstorm clusters into bowing
segments will be possible. This may result in a short window of
increased severe gust potential across portions of western KS into
western OK. The eastward extent of severe potential will likely be
limited across central KS/OK and points east due to modest vertical
shear, and as inhibition increases in the 03-06z time frame.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS
CENTRAL/EAST TEXAS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered large hail and isolated damaging winds are possible this
afternoon and evening across central and east Texas. More isolated
severe thunderstorms are possible across parts of the Middle
Tennessee Valley and Carolinas, High Plains, northern Rockies, and
south Florida.

...Central/East Texas...
A residual small cluster of storms has persisted through late
morning across northeast Texas. Additional and increasingly
surface-based storm development will be possible this afternoon,
particularly into mid/late afternoon. This will be focused where
outflow/differential heating influences interface with an
increasingly unstable (2500+ J/kg MLCAPE) environment near a
northwest/southeast-oriented synoptic boundary and related
instability gradient. Northwesterly deep-layer shear of 35-40 kt
will be sufficient for organized storms, including supercells,
posing a risk for large hail and potentially damaging wind gusts. A
sustained storm interacting with residual/modifying outflow could
have some tornado potential in the presence of locally-augmented
low-level shear. These storms may cluster later today, or otherwise
persist south-southeastward toward east-central/southeast Texas
through early and mid-evening including the I-35/I-45 corridors.

...Tennessee to the Carolinas...
Despite relatively modest low-level moisture, diurnal heating
combined with seasonably cool temperatures aloft associated with a
deep upper-level trough will allow for weak to moderate
destabilization ahead of a weak surface wave and advancing front. 
Isolated to scattered storm development is expected this afternoon,
with somewhat greater coverage expected with eastward extent
centered on parts of North Carolina. Modestly favorable effective
shear (generally 25-30 kt) may support occasionally organized storms
capable of isolated damaging wind and hail. Any longer-lived
clusters could pose a more concentrated wind-damage threat.

...Northern Rockies and northern High Plains...
A mid/upper-level shortwave trough will move eastward from the
Pacific Northwest toward the northern Rockies by this evening. Weak
to locally moderate buoyancy and increasing deep-layer shear will
support the potential for somewhat organized cells/clusters with an
attendant threat of isolated severe gusts and hail. This development
should generally focus near the Montana/Idaho/Wyoming border
vicinity as well as near/east of the Bighorns.

...South Florida...
Influenced by moderately strong westerlies aloft, some
strong/locally severe storms may remain possible today along and
south of a boundary that has been effectively reinforced by early
day storms.

...Eastern Colorado/New Mexico...
Scattered storms are again expected this afternoon and evening along
and east of the higher terrain in eastern Colorado/New Mexico. While
deep-layer flow/shear will be relatively modest, guidance suggests
some increase in low-level moisture and instability by afternoon.
Initial storms could pose a threat for isolated hail and strong to
severe gusts. There is some potential for one or more loosely
organized clusters to develop by evening and spread eastward with
strong to locally severe outflow winds. 

...Southern California into southern/central Arizona...
A mid/upper-level cyclone will move northeastward into parts of
southern California/Arizona later today. Cool temperatures aloft
will overspread the region, but relatively widespread cloudiness and
precipitation will tend to limit destabilization. If pockets of
locally stronger heating/destabilization can develop, then a few
strong storms could occur.

...Great Basin...
High-based thunderstorms are expected to develop this afternoon from
parts of Nevada into western Utah. Buoyancy and shear are expected
to remain weak, and organized thunderstorms are not expected,
however localized strong outflow gusts will be possible within this
regime through early evening.

Mesoscale Discussion 1060
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0705 AM CDT Sun Jun 01 2025

Areas affected...South-central Florida Peninsula

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 011205Z - 011400Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...An isolated tornado threat may continue for the next two
to three hours across south-central Florida. The threat is expected
to remain localized, and weather watch issuance appears unlikely,
although trends will be monitored.

DISCUSSION...An east-to-west band of strong thunderstorms is ongoing
across south-central Florida, along a zone of somewhat focused
low-level convergence. The storms are being supported by a shortwave
trough that is moving through the eastern Gulf. A mid-level jet
streak is analyzed by the RAP from the eastern Gulf extending
eastward across the Florida Peninsula. This jet has strengthened
deep-layer shear over south-central Florida into the 40 to 50 knot
range, according to the RAP. This will support isolated supercell
development this morning. Although RAP forecast soundings across
south-central Florida suggest that low-level shear is not
particularly strong, storm-relative helicity could be locally higher
near the zone of low-level convergence. As a result, transient
supercells could be capable of producing low to mid-level rotation,
with a brief tornado possible. Marginally severe wind gusts could
also occur. The threat should remain localized, and watch issuance
is currently not expected.

Mesoscale Discussion 1059
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0622 AM CDT Sun Jun 01 2025

Areas affected...Southern Oklahoma...North Texas

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 351...

Valid 011122Z - 011315Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 351
continues.

SUMMARY...A few strong thunderstorms, with isolated severe gusts or
hail, will be possible over the next few hours. However, any threat
should remain localized, and weather watch issuance is not expected
to the south of the current watch.

DISCUSSION...A cluster of thunderstorms is ongoing in south-central
Oklahoma, which is near a 500 mb jet analyzed by the RAP. This
cluster will continue to move southward across the remainder of
Oklahoma into parts of north Texas over the next few hours. Any
severe threat associated with the cluster will likely remain
localized and brief, primarily due to weak instability. For this
reason, weather watch issuance is not expected to the south of the
ongoing watch. 

As the outflow boundary, associated with the cluster, stalls over
north Texas later this morning, it will likely become a focus for
new convective development. Through that time, the situation will
continue to be monitored for changes in severe weather potential.
