Mesoscale Discussion 1205
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0350 PM CDT Sun Jun 08 2025

Areas affected...portions of eastern Colorado and New Mexico

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 082050Z - 082245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Large hail and severe wind threat possible this afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorm development has been ongoing across the
Front Range in Colorado and across northeastern New Mexico. The air
mass across Colorado remains under the influence of MLCIN, with
temperatures cooling with northern extend behind the surface cold
front. Moisture is also somewhat limited, with dew points in the
upper 40s to 50s. A few instances of severe hail will be possible.

Across eastern New Mexico near the dryline, a gradient of more
appreciable MLCAPE 500-1500 j/kg is in place along with deep layer
shear around 30-45 kts. Temperatures are in the mid 70s to 80s amid
dew points in the 50s to upper 60s. This may support some instances
of severe wind and hail, with at least one supercell noted on radar.
Trends will be monitored for watch potential, but it appears
unlikely at this time.

Mesoscale Discussion 1204
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0331 PM CDT Sun Jun 08 2025

Areas affected...Portions of northern/central VA and MD

Concerning...Tornado Watch 392...

Valid 082031Z - 082200Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 392 continues.

SUMMARY...A risk for tornadoes and damaging wind gusts will persist
into early evening across northern/central Virginia, and portions of
Maryland.

DISCUSSION...Isolated storms are ongoing closer to a surface
boundary across eastern VA, and further west across the higher
terrain of central VA. These storms will continue to shift east
across a moderately unstable airmass and within 30-40 kt effective
shear. A surface boundary extending from northern VA southeast into
southeast VA will continue to support a corridor of enhanced
low-level shear supporting storm rotation. A couple tornadoes and
damaging gusts will remain possible over the next few hours.

Mesoscale Discussion 1203
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0330 PM CDT Sun Jun 08 2025

Areas affected...portions of western Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 082030Z - 082230Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Large hail and severe wind threat may increase through the
afternoon/early evening.

DISCUSSION...Supercells have developed across the Davis Mountains in
far western Texas this afternoon. The environment in this region is
characterized by MLCAPE around 500-1500 J/kg, steep lapse rates, and
deep layer shear around 40-45 kts. This will support potential for
supercells to produce some instances of large to very large hail and
severe winds. MLCIN does increase with eastward extent, which may
limit coverage/duration of this threat. This area will be monitored
for watch potential.

Mesoscale Discussion 1202
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0317 PM CDT Sun Jun 08 2025

Areas affected...portions of southwestern and north-central
Texas...southwestern Oklahoma

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 082017Z - 082215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Large hail/tornado threat to increase through the
afternoon before a more significant wind threat emerges.

DISCUSSION...Supercell thunderstorms are ongoing across portions of
the Oklahoma and Texas Panhandles as of this hour, with at least one
tornado reported in Cimarron/Dallam counties. Additional development
is ongoing west of Amarillo. It is likely some mix of supercell
clusters will advance south and eastward through time, with
potential for additional development to occur ahead of the dryline
in New Mexico.

Low-level shear improves with southward extent into Lubbock where
surface winds are backed southeasterly improving low-level curvature
of hodographs and streamwise vorticity. It is likely that as storms
develop and move southward, the tornado threat will increase through
time even with the shifting storm mode.

A sharp gradient of extreme MLCAPE exists along the Red River near
the Texas/Oklahoma border into north-central Texas amid steep low to
mid-level lapse rates. As upscale growth increases, the potential
will rapidly increase for destructive winds (80-100 mph). A Tornado
or PDS Severe Watch is likely needed to cover this potential.

Tropical Storm Barbara Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022025
300 PM CST Sun Jun 08 2025
 
Deep convection continues to burst over the center of Barbara this 
afternoon, with cold cloud tops near -75 C. However, a dry slot in 
the eastern semi-circle looks to have slightly disrupted the 
convective organization. Subjective and objective intensity 
estimates range from 45-55 kt this cycle. Using a blend of satellite 
estimates and the latest imagery the intensity is held at 50 kt for 
this advisory.
 
Barbara is currently within a favorable environment with warm SSTs 
and low vertical wind shear. Strengthening is forecast over the next 
day or so, and Barbara is forecast to become a hurricane overnight. 
After 24 h, the system will be moving over cooler sea surface 
temperatures below 26C and into a drier mid-level environment. These 
factors will cause the storm to weaken and eventually struggle to 
produce convection. Latest model IR simulated satellite imagery 
shows the system losing convection by 72 h.  This suggests that 
it will become a a post-tropical remnant low by that time and 
likely dissipate  by day 5 although that could occur sooner than 
currently forecast.
 
Barbara is moving west-northwestward at 295/10, steered by 
a mid-level ridge over Mexico, and this motion should continue over 
the next couple of days. The NHC forecast was nudged slightly 
rightward and lies just left of the the simple and corrected 
consensus aids.  Given the forecast track and wind radii, 
tropical-storm-force winds are not expected to affect the 
southwestern coast of Mexico. By Tuesday, the track forecast becomes 
more complicated given the potential interaction between Barbara and 
Cosme. The GFS and ECMWF are on opposite ends of the guidance 
envelope.

HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: RAINFALL: Outer bands of Barbara may bring total rainfall
amounts of 2 to 4 inches to coastal portions of the Mexican states
of Guerrero, Michoacan, Colima and Jalisco through Monday. This
rainfall may lead to localized areas of flooding and mudslides.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Storm Barbara, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic available at

Tropical Storm Cosme Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032025
200 PM MST Sun Jun 08 2025
 
Deep convection has been increasing near the center and in curved
bands on the western side of the circulation during the past
several hours. An ASCAT-C pass from a few hours ago showed peak
winds in the 35-40 kt range, and based on that data, the depression
has been upgraded to Tropical Storm Cosme with the initial
intensity set at 40 kt.
 
Cosme will likely continue to strengthen for the next day or two as
it remains in an environment of low to moderate wind shear, abundant
moisture, and over warm SSTs. The NHC intensity forecast shows a
peak of 60 kt at 24 and 36 hours, and it wouldn't be surprising if
Cosme becomes a hurricane during that time frame. By mid-week,
however, the storm is expected to move over progressively cooler
waters and into a drier airmass, which should cause the system to
begin weakening. Cosme is now forecast to become a remnant low in 3
days and dissipate in 4 days.

The storm is moving northwestward at 7 kt, and that general motion 
is expected to continue during the next couple of days.  After that 
time, the interaction with Barbara will likely result in an initial 
slow down and then turn to the northeast. There is a fair amount of 
spread in the guidance due to the complexity of this interaction.  
The NHC track forecast has been adjusted a little to the right of 
the previous one to account for the initial motion/position and to 
be in better agreement with the latest consensus aids.

portions of the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast.

...20Z Update...
With convection moving off the South Carolina coast, severe
probabilities have been reduced as robust redevelopment is not
expected this afternoon. Severe probabilities were also reduced in
parts of eastern Kansas, Missouri, and western Illinois based on the
current position of the cold front. The remainder of the forecast
remains on track. Widespread severe winds and large to very large
hail, and a few tornadoes remain possible across parts of the
southern Plains.

..Wendt.. 06/08/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1145 AM CDT Sun Jun 08 2025/

...Northwest/North Texas and Oklahoma...
A very active severe-weather day is expected including a regional
outbreak of severe storms. The potential exists for very large hail
and a few tornadoes this afternoon, with widespread damaging
winds/derecho potentially developing into this evening and
overnight, especially across much of North Texas and southern
Oklahoma.

Broad west-northwesterly flow is present today across the
central/southern Plains, with a surface cold front sagging southward
across Kansas. Ahead of the front, a very moist boundary-layer air
mass is in place across much of Oklahoma/Texas, with dewpoints in
the upper 60s and lower 70s. Ample daytime heating and near
dry-adiabatic low/mid-level lapse rates will yield a large reservoir
of extremely high CAPE values across western Oklahoma and northwest
Texas. See Mesoscale Discussion 1196 for additional short-term
details.  

Rapid development of intense thunderstorms will ensue by mid/late
afternoon along the cold front over western Oklahoma and along a
complex dryline structure over the eastern Texas Panhandle. Strong
deep layer shear will support intense supercells, despite rather
weak low-level winds. Very large hail, damaging winds, and a few
tornadoes will be possible as these storms track southeastward
across western/central Oklahoma and toward western North Texas,
likely congealing into one or more prominent bowing MCSs.

The risk of widespread destructive winds will increase through the
evening as the potentially prominent linear convective system
organizes/gradually accelerates east-southeastward across southern
Oklahoma and North Texas. At least some lingering damaging
wind/embedded tornado potential may reach as far east-southeast as
the ArkLaTex and ArkLaMiss late tonight.

...Mid-Atlantic States...
A shortwave trough currently over Ohio will track eastward today,
with large-scale ascent overspreading the Mid-Atlantic states by
afternoon. A moist surface air mass is present across much of
VA/MD/NC and vicinity with dewpoints in the upper 60s.  Persistent
clouds and weak mid-level lapse rates will limit destabilization. 
However, it appears likely that storms will develop off the Blue
Ridge by mid afternoon and spread eastward toward the coast. 
Forecast soundings show sufficient low and deep layer shear for
supercell structures capable of damaging wind gusts and perhaps a
few tornadoes.

...Southeast...
Clusters of storms will move across the region with mostly a wind
damage risk, perhaps most certain and most focused across coastal
portions of South Carolina into southern North Carolina through
mid-afternoon.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0224 PM CDT Sun Jun 08 2025

Valid 101200Z - 111200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ALONG THE EAST
COAST...OVER PARTS OF CENTRAL MT...AND FROM THE SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS
THROUGH CENTRAL TX INTO SOUTHERN LA...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms are possible on Tuesday into Tuesday
evening along parts of the East Coast, from southeast New Mexico to
south Louisiana, and along the lee of the Montana Rockies.

...East Coast...
Upper troughing is expected to extend from central Ontario through
the TN Valley early Tuesday morning, with moderate mid-level
southwesterly flow throughout its eastern periphery from the central
Appalachians through the Northeast. Expectation is for this
troughing to progress eastward during the day as an embedded
shortwave trough moves through the Upper OH Valley and Lower Great
Lakes. An associated surface low will move just ahead of this
shortwave, with an attendant cold front moving through the
Mid-Atlantic. 

Severe potential across the region should be confined to the late
morning and afternoon period ahead of the weakening cold front. The
strongest shear will be displaced north of the higher buoyancy,
somewhat limiting the overall severe potential. Even so, there
should still be enough overlap for isolated severe storms,
particularly across southeast VA and eastern NC. Isolated damaging
wind gusts are the primary risk. 

...Lower MS Valley across the TX Coastal Plains into the TX Hill
Country...
A composite cold front/outflow boundary will likely extend from
west-central LA to the Edwards Plateau early Tuesday morning. A
convectively generated vorticity maximum may also be over central
TX, although uncertainty regarding the strength and location of this
vorticity maximum is high at this forecast range. The presence of a
vorticity maximum potentially in close proximity to the weak surface
boundary complicates the overall forecast, since both features could
provide the lift needed for convective initiation. However,
mesoscale nature of these features as well as their interactions
limits predictability. At this point, thunderstorms appear possible
and conditions suggest some would be strong/severe. Higher severe
probabilities may be needed in future outlooks as predictability
increases. 

...Southeast NM and Far West TX...
Strong heating and deep boundary-layer mixing is anticipated over
the region on Tuesday. However, moderate/strong low-level moisture
advection will help offset low-level mixing, allowing for dewpoints
to remain in the low to mid 60s. Resulting combination of steep
mid-level lapse rates and low-level moisture will support late
afternoon airmass destabilization and strong buoyancy. A
low-amplitude shortwave trough will be approaching the region, with
lift ahead of this wave combining with low-level convergence along
the dryline to support thunderstorm initiation. Environmental
conditions support supercells capable of large to very large hail
initially, with some wind gust threat as well. Overall coverage is
uncertain, which merits keeping low severe probabilities for this
outlook.  

...Lee of the MT Rockies...
Upper ridging is forecast to dampen throughout the period, with 
the mid to upper-level flow becoming more westerly. A weak vorticity
maximum will move through this westerly flow, augmenting orographic
ascent and helping to aid thunderstorm development across the high
terrain. Moderate speed shear should result in a couple
lower-end/high-based supercells as storms develop off the
higher terrain of western to south-central MT. Weak buoyancy 
suggests that marginally severe hail and locally strong gusts should
be the main threats.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...19z Update...
No changes, thunderstorm potential still appears isolated and poorly
overlapped with receptive fuels across parts of the Northwest
Monday. Otherwise, fire-weather concerns over the CONUS are modest,
see the previous discussion.

..Lyons.. 06/08/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0157 AM CDT Sun Jun 08 2025/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will traverse the eastern U.S. while upper
ridging remains in place west of the Rockies tomorrow (Monday). A
combination of either recent rainfall over the past week (hence
dampened fuels), rich low-level moisture, or forecast
showers/thunderstorms, should limit significant wildfire-spread
potential over most locales over the CONUS. With seasonal mid-level
moisture overspreading the Great Basin toward the Pacific Northwest,
thunderstorms chances will increase during the afternoon. Along the
northernmost periphery the richer mid-level moisture, some
potentially dry thunderstorms may develop over southern Oregon.
However, fuel receptiveness is modest at best in this region, and
the potential for dry thunderstorms appears too locally confined
(given the fuel status) to warrant isolated dry thunderstorm
highlights this outlook.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 391
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
150 PM EDT Sun Jun 8 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Eastern North Carolina
  Coastal Waters

* Effective this Sunday afternoon and evening from 150 PM until
  900 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 65 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1 inch in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Clusters of storms will move east-northeastward across
eastern North Carolina this afternoon, with wind damage as the
primary severe-weather hazard.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 50
statute miles east and west of a line from 25 miles southeast of
Jacksonville NC to 90 miles northeast of New Bern NC. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU1).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 390...

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1 inch. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 55 knots. A few
cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
24025.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1229 PM CDT Sun Jun 08 2025

Valid 091200Z - 101200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE SOUTHEAST
STATES INTO THE TN AND OH VALLEYS...AND ACROSS THE SOUTHERN HIGH
PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered damaging winds, a couple tornadoes, and isolated severe
hail are possible across the Southeast into the Upper Ohio Valley on
Monday into Monday evening.

...Mid-South/Lower MS Valley into the Southeast...
While there is some uncertainty regarding the intensity/organization
and location of the overnight MCS early Monday morning, the general
consensus within the guidance places its associated vorticity max
and surface low over the eastern vicinity. Expectation is then for
this low and vorticity max to continue eastward into the moist and
moderately buoyant airmass downstream across the Southeast.
Thunderstorms appear likely in the vicinity of these features,
including well downstream during the afternoon as boundary layer
destabilizes and along the trailing composite outflow that will
likely maintain its integrity. Damaging gusts will be the primary
risk, particularly across central MS/AL where a corridor of greater
severe potential may materialize. Uncertainty (primarily related to
limited predictability of the system's speed) in this corridor
remains too high to outline any higher probabilities with this
outlook, but an upgrade may be needed in later outlooks.

...OH/TN Valleys...
A plume of moderate to high PWs is forecast extend along the frontal
zone from the Mid-South northeastward through the middle OH Valley
Monday morning. A shortwave trough is expected to progress through
the base of a stacked cyclone moving from the  Upper Midwest into
the Upper Great Lakes. This shortwave will encourage an eastward
push to the cold front, while also contributing to strengthening
mid-level flow across the region. The stronger winds will likely be
confined to the mid/upper OH Valley, and mostly behind the front,
with the most likely area of some overlap over OH and PA. However,
this region will be displaced north of the better buoyancy, which is
anticipated farther south over KY and TN. This displacement should
temper the overall storm severity, but occasionally strong to severe
are still possible throughout this entire corridor. Scattered
damaging winds will be the primary risk, although lower-probability
tornado and isolated severe hail risks also exist.

...Southern High Plains...
The airmass across the region will likely begin the period behind
the outflow of an extensive overnight MCS. However, these relatively
cool and dry conditions are expected to modify quickly amid strong
heating. A sharpening lee trough will also encourage backing
low-level flow throughout the day, from northerly to easterly (or
even southeasterly), with some low-level moisture advection
possible. These factors could allow convection that initially
develops over the higher terrain to persist eastward/southeastward
into more of the High Plains, with an attendant threat for strong
gusts. The modifying outflow could act as a favorable corridor for
forward propagation and increase damaging gust potential during the
evening.

...Southwest/Central/Southeast TX...
The outflow of an extensive overnight MCS will likely arc from
northern LA through central TX into southwest TX early Monday
morning. Isolated thunderstorms are possible along this boundary as
it gradually shifts southward throughout the day. Highest
thunderstorm coverage is expected across southeast TX, with warm
low/mid-levels and associated capping should limit the overall
thunderstorm coverage westward. Isolated hail and damaging gusts are
possible with any storms that develop.

...Northwest TX...
Isolated elevated convection may form with weak low-level warm
theta-e advection north of the front on Monday. Sufficient effective
bulk shear and elevated buoyancy may exist for a few storms capable
of severe hail.

PUBLIC SEVERE WEATHER OUTLOOK  
NWS STORM PREDICTION CENTER NORMAN OK
1157 AM CDT SUN JUN 08 2025

...Severe thunderstorms expected over parts of the southern Plains
this afternoon and tonight...

* LOCATIONS...
  North Texas
  Southern Oklahoma

* HAZARDS...
  Widespread damaging winds, some hurricane force
  A couple of tornadoes
  Scattered large hail, some baseball size

* SUMMARY...
  A severe weather outbreak is expected across the southern Plains
  today, including southern Oklahoma and much of northwest and
  North Texas. A few tornadoes, destructive wind gusts of 80-100
  mph, and giant hail up to 3-5 inches in diameter are likely.
  Strong wind gusts, and perhaps a couple of tornadoes, are also
  possible across portions of the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast.

Preparedness actions...

Review your severe weather safety procedures for the possibility
of dangerous weather today. Stay tuned to NOAA Weather Radio,
weather.gov, or other media for watches and warnings. A watch
means that conditions are favorable for severe thunderstorms
over the next several hours. If a severe thunderstorm warning is
issued for your area, move to a place of safety, ideally in an 
interior room on the lowest floor of a sturdy building.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1149 AM CDT Sun Jun 08 2025

Valid 081700Z - 091200Z

...17z Update...
No changes, dry post-frontal conditions are likely across parts of
eastern Montana and the western Dakotas this afternoon. Fuels
farther south are not overly receptive, but surface wind gusts of
25-30 mph with RH near 20-25% will support several hours of elevated
fire-weather potential. See the previous discussion for more info.

..Lyons.. 06/08/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0130 AM CDT Sun Jun 08 2025/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will deepen across the central and eastern CONUS
as a mid-level ridge builds over the western U.S. today. Rich
low-level moisture will overspread most of the CONUS east of the
Rockies, with scattered to widespread thunderstorms expected,
mitigating significant wildfire-spread concerns over most locales.
The one exception will be over parts of the northern High Plains.
Widespread 15-25 mph sustained northwesterly surface winds are
likely in a post-cold frontal regime, where RH may dip into the
15-25 percent range. Given modestly dry fine fuels present, Elevated
highlights have been maintained. 

Elsewhere across the Desert Southwest into the Great Basin, a dry
and mixed boundary layer should support widespread lower RH.
However, the lack of a stronger surface wind field suggests that
fire weather highlights are not currently warranted.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1145 AM CDT Sun Jun 08 2025

Valid 081630Z - 091200Z

...THERE IS A MODERATE RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE EASTERN
TEXAS PANHANDLE INTO SOUTHERN OKLAHOMA AND NORTHWEST/NORTH-CENTRAL
TEXAS...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
MID-ATLANTIC/SOUTHEAST STATES...

...SUMMARY...
A severe weather outbreak is expected across the southern Plains
today, including southern Oklahoma and much of northwest and North
Texas. A few tornadoes, destructive wind gusts of 80-100 mph, and
giant hail up to 3-5 inches in diameter are likely. Strong wind
gusts, and perhaps a couple of tornadoes, are also possible across
portions of the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast.

...Northwest/North Texas and Oklahoma...
A very active severe-weather day is expected including a regional
outbreak of severe storms. The potential exists for very large hail
and a few tornadoes this afternoon, with widespread damaging
winds/derecho potentially developing into this evening and
overnight, especially across much of North Texas and southern
Oklahoma.

Broad west-northwesterly flow is present today across the
central/southern Plains, with a surface cold front sagging southward
across Kansas. Ahead of the front, a very moist boundary-layer air
mass is in place across much of Oklahoma/Texas, with dewpoints in
the upper 60s and lower 70s. Ample daytime heating and near
dry-adiabatic low/mid-level lapse rates will yield a large reservoir
of extremely high CAPE values across western Oklahoma and northwest
Texas. See Mesoscale Discussion 1196 for additional short-term
details.  

Rapid development of intense thunderstorms will ensue by mid/late
afternoon along the cold front over western Oklahoma and along a
complex dryline structure over the eastern Texas Panhandle. Strong
deep layer shear will support intense supercells, despite rather
weak low-level winds. Very large hail, damaging winds, and a few
tornadoes will be possible as these storms track southeastward
across western/central Oklahoma and toward western North Texas,
likely congealing into one or more prominent bowing MCSs.

The risk of widespread destructive winds will increase through the
evening as the potentially prominent linear convective system
organizes/gradually accelerates east-southeastward across southern
Oklahoma and North Texas. At least some lingering damaging
wind/embedded tornado potential may reach as far east-southeast as
the ArkLaTex and ArkLaMiss late tonight.

...Mid-Atlantic States...
A shortwave trough currently over Ohio will track eastward today,
with large-scale ascent overspreading the Mid-Atlantic states by
afternoon. A moist surface air mass is present across much of
VA/MD/NC and vicinity with dewpoints in the upper 60s.  Persistent
clouds and weak mid-level lapse rates will limit destabilization. 
However, it appears likely that storms will develop off the Blue
Ridge by mid afternoon and spread eastward toward the coast. 
Forecast soundings show sufficient low and deep layer shear for
supercell structures capable of damaging wind gusts and perhaps a
few tornadoes.

...Southeast...
Clusters of storms will move across the region with mostly a wind
damage risk, perhaps most certain and most focused across coastal
portions of South Carolina into southern North Carolina through
mid-afternoon.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0707 AM CDT Sun Jun 08 2025

Valid 081300Z - 091200Z

...THERE IS A MODERATE RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON
AND EVENING FROM THE EASTERN TEXAS PANHANDLE INTO SOUTHERN OKLAHOMA
AND NORTHWEST/NORTH-CENTRAL TEXAS...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON
FROM THE MID-ATLANTIC REGION INTO GEORGIA....

...SUMMARY...
A severe weather outbreak is possible across the southern Plains
today. A few tornadoes, destructive wind gusts of 80-100 mph, and
giant hail up to 5 inches in diameter are likely. Strong gusts, and
perhaps a couple of tornadoes, are also possible along portions of
the East Coast.

...OK/TX...
Broad west-northwesterly flow is present today across the
central/southern Plains states, with a surface cold front sagging
southward across KS.  Ahead of the front, a very moist
boundary-layer air mass is in place across much of OK and TX, with
dewpoints in the upper 60s and lower 70s.  Strong daytime heating
and near dry-adiabatic low/mid-level lapse rates will yield a large
reservoir of extremely high CAPE values across western OK and
northwest TX.  

Rapid development of intense thunderstorms will ensue by mid/late
afternoon along the cold front over northwest OK and along a complex
dryline structure over the eastern TX Panhandle.  Strong deep layer
shear will favor supercells, despite rather weak low-level winds. 
Very large hail, damaging winds, and a few tornadoes will be
possible as these storms track southeastward across western/central
OK and congeal into one or more bowing segments.  Recent CAM
solutions suggest pockets of deep boundary-layer mixing, with some
areas heating into the mid 90s while dewpoints drop into the 50s. 
If this scenario develops, significant wind and hail would remain a
concern, but the overall risk of tornadoes would be reduced.

The risk of widespread destructive winds will increase through the
evening as the convective complex tracks into northwest and
north-central TX.  The activity make remain intense as far east as
northern/central LA tonight.

...Central/North TX early afternoon...
A cluster of strong thunderstorms is ongoing this morning between
ABI and LBB.  Other isolated cells are forming in eastern NM north
of TCC.  Given the very unstable environment, any one of these
clusters of storms could potentially persist through the day and
track southeastward into parts of central TX.  Large hail and
damaging winds would be the main concerns.

...Mid Atlantic Region...
A shortwave trough currently over OH will track eastward today, with
large-scale ascent overspreading the Mid-Atlantic states by
afternoon.  A moist surface air mass is present across much of
VA/MD/NC and vicinity with dewpoints in the upper 60s.  Persistent
clouds and weak mid-level lapse rates will limit destabilization. 
However, it appears likely that storms will develop off the Blue
Ridge by mid afternoon and spread eastward toward the coast. 
Forecast soundings show sufficient low and deep layer shear for
supercell structures capable of damaging wind gusts and perhaps a
few tornadoes.

...GA/SC...
A large MCS has persisted overnight across parts of AL/GA, with a
few strong storms along its leading edge.  Given a few hours of
daytime heating, these storms may pose a risk of damaging wind gusts
as they spread eastward toward the coast.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0347 AM CDT Sun Jun 08 2025

Valid 111200Z - 161200Z

...DISCUSSION...
Guidance trends remain supportive of a more active pattern across
the northern High Plains to the Upper Midwest. GEFS-based ML
guidance from SPC and NSSL are now highlighting multiple days with
mesoscale areas of 15 percent probabilities, mainly over the
northern High Plains. Western Gulf moisture will spread north and
encompass much of the central states through next weekend. Various
shortwave impulses ejecting into the Northwest may support multiple
bouts of mesoscale-driven severe potential downstream along the
northern periphery of the expansive Great Plains buoyancy plume. The
initial impulse that is expected to reach northern CA by 12Z
Wednesday has poor predictability with its downstream evolution into
the North-Central States.

Low-probability severe potential may persist for several days with a
minor southern-stream shortwave impulse drifting east from the
southern Great Plains. This could foster daily mesoscale corridors
with a severe threat, as modest shear overlaps plentiful buoyancy
initially over the South-Central States.

Tropical Storm Barbara Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022025
300 AM CST Sun Jun 08 2025
 
Showers and thunderstorms have become better organized in 
association with an area of low pressure located offshore of 
southwestern Mexico. A small, persistent area of deep convection has 
been observed in satellite images tonight, and recent scatterometer 
data confirm this has led to the formation of a well-defined, closed 
low-level circulation. Therefore, the NHC is starting advisories on 
Tropical Storm Barbara with an initial intensity of 40 kt based on 
the earlier scatterometer winds.

Barbara is currently within a moist and relatively low shear 
environment over warm waters. So, strengthening is expected during 
the next day or so, and this could occur quickly given recent 
satellite trends and the small size of the storm. The official NHC 
forecast shows Barbara becoming a hurricane in 24 h, which is 
supported by HAFS-A/B and the HFIP corrected consensus (HCCA). The 
window for strengthening is brief, as Barbara is forecast to move 
over cooler waters and into a drier mid-level environment by 48 h. 
This should disrupt the convective structure of the storm and result 
in weakening. By day 5, the remnant low of Barbara is forecast to 
either dissipate or become absorbed by the circulation of EP91.

Barbara is moving west-northwestward (295/10 kt) on the south side 
of a mid-level ridge, and this motion should continue over the next 
couple of days. For this time period, the NHC forecast generally 
lies near or between the simple and corrected consensus aids. Given 
the forecast track and wind radii, tropical-storm-force winds 
are not expected to affect the southwestern coast of Mexico. By 
Tuesday, the track forecast becomes more complicated given the 
potential for binary interaction between Barbara and another 
disturbance (EP91) with a high chance of formation. Because of this, 
the long-range track forecast could be subject to larger future 
adjustments depending on the evolution of EP91.

Mesoscale Discussion 1182
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0341 PM CDT Sat Jun 07 2025

Areas affected...portions of eastern Missouri and southern Illinois

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 072041Z - 072245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...A few damaging gusts and instances of marginally severe
hail are possible across portions of eastern Missouri and southern
Illinois this afternoon. A watch is not anticipated.

DISCUSSION...An MCV is currently centered northwest of Columbia, MO
with some convection ongoing along a trailing surface boundary to
the south. Clouds have cleared to the south of the vortex with some
heating and modification of the earlier outflow from convection
across the Mid-South. As such, a pocket of 1000-1500 J/kg MLCAPE has
developed in the region along with strong deep-layer shear. RAP
forecast soundings show a warm nose around 750 mb, which has
generally suppressed convective development away from surface
boundaries. Given strong flow aloft, some damaging gusts are
possible with this activity if downdrafts are strong enough to
transfer that momentum to the surface, though this may be inhibited
by the aforementioned warm nose aloft and generally poor low-level
lapse rates. Some marginally severe hail is also possible given
straight hodographs with the cellular activity, though poor
mid-level lapse rates (6 C/km per mesoanalysis) may limit the
overall hail potential.

Mesoscale Discussion 1181
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0339 PM CDT Sat Jun 07 2025

Areas affected...Parts of northeastern NM into the far western TX/OK
Panhandles

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 072039Z - 072145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...The severe risk, including isolated large hail and locally
severe gusts, could spread southeastward into this evening. The area
is being monitored for a possible watch.

DISCUSSION...An isolated thunderstorm has recently intensified over
the Raton Mesa. Ahead of this storm, visible satellite imagery shows
a band of shallow cumulus extending west-northwestward from the TX
Panhandle -- which generally highlights the lower/middle 60s
dewpoints and related moderate surface-based instability. If this
isolated storm can persist southeastward through this corridor, a
long/straight hodograph (40-50 kt of effective shear) would support
one or more discrete supercells capable of producing large hail and
locally severe gusts. The area is being monitored for a possible
watch.

Areas affected...Parts of northeast AL...northwest GA...and
southeast TN

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 385...386...

Valid 072024Z - 072200Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 385, 386
continues.

SUMMARY...The severe-wind risk continues with an MCS tracking
eastward across northeastern AL, northwestern GA, and southeastern
TN.

DISCUSSION...A NNE/SSW-oriented MCS is tracking eastward across
parts of northeastern AL and southern Middle TN into northwestern GA
and southeastern TN this afternoon. This system has been associated
with a swath of wind damage focused over north-central AL. Around
30-40 kt of 0-6km shear (per nearby VWPs) oriented perpendicular to
the leading gust front and warm/moist pre-convective inflow should
support the maintenance of the MCS with eastward extent. The primary
concern continues to be damaging wind gusts, with embedded/localized
gusts upwards of 60-75 mph possible in any small bowing segments
and/or mesovorticies.

Mesoscale Discussion 1179
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0302 PM CDT Sat Jun 07 2025

Areas affected...Eastern North Dakota...Northeastern South
Dakota...and Northwestern Minnesota

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 072002Z - 072200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...A few severe gusts and marginally severe hail reports are
possible this afternoon and evening across parts of eastern North
Dakota, northeastern South Dakota, and northwestern Minnesota. A
watch is not anticipated.

DISCUSSION...Water vapor imagery and RAP analyses show a strong
shortwave trough moving southeastward out of Canada and into the
northern Plains, and this in tandem with a surface cold front has
provided the lift for convective development across parts of central
North Dakota. Ahead of this front, the air mass is cut off from the
rich low-level moisture by convection to the south, and as such,
surface dewpoints across the region are generally in the low to mid
50s F. Large-scale lift has resulted in enough mid-level cooling for
a narrow CAPE axis along the front, and this should continue to
track eastward with the mid-level trough this afternoon and evening.


Despite the lackluster low-level flow noted on regional VWPs, this
relatively dry boundary layer may result in a few strong-severe
gusts, particularly as storms cluster and cold pools merge with
time. Additionally, given a deep CAPE profile, modest mid-level
lapse rates, and weak low-level shear due to veered surface flow, a
few marginally severe hail reports are possible with the initial
activity. The hail threat is expected to gradually decrease with
time. Due to the expected sparse coverage of severe wind and hail, a
watch is not anticipated.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0351 PM CDT Sat Jun 07 2025

Valid 091200Z - 151200Z

Subtropical ridging over the western U.S. is forecast to briefly
intensify Day 3/Monday into Day 4/Tuesday before it begins to break
down later Day 4/Tuesday as mid-level troughing re-develops across
the West and persists into next weekend.  

...Northwest: Day 4/Tuesday - Day 5/Wednesday...
Dry and breezy conditions are expected to develop along/east of the
Cascades Day 4/Tuesday and Day 5/Wednesday across portions of
Washington and Oregon. While elevated to locally critical fire
weather conditions are possible, probabilities for Critical
conditions currently remains less than 40% due to continued
run-to-run ensemble model variability. 

...Great Basin into the Southwest: Day 5/Wednesday - Day
8/Saturday...
Dry and windy conditions are forecast to develop over the western
U.S. by mid-week as the aforementioned western U.S. trough impinges
on the area. While some increase in fire weather conditions is
expected from mid-week into next weekend, especially considering
several preceding days of dry/windy conditions, uncertainty
currently remains a bit too large to introduce probabilities for
Critical fire weather conditions. At this time, ensemble guidance
suggests elevated to locally critical conditions are most likely
across portions of Utah and Nevada. 

...Dry Thunderstorms: Northwest into the northern Great Basin and
northern Rockies...
Thunderstorm potential will increase across the Northwest Day
3/Monday before shifting into the Great Basin and northern Rockies
Day 4/Tuesday through much of the extended period. While dry
thunderstorms will be possible, uncertainty on coverage, mode (wet
vs dry), and fuel receptiveness precludes introducing an area at
this time.

  Isolated large hail events to 1 inch in diameter possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...An organized line of storms now in Alabama and southern
middle Tennessee will move quickly eastward through this evening
with a continued threat for corridors of damaging winds up to 75
mph, isolated large hail near 1 inch diameter, and possibly an
isolated tornado or two with embedded circulations.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 80
statute miles east and west of a line from 5 miles northwest of
Knoxville TN to 40 miles south of Atlanta GA. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU6).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 385...

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1 inch. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 65 knots. A few
cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
27040.

Mesoscale Discussion 1174
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0733 AM CDT Sat Jun 07 2025

Areas affected...northeast Arkansas...western Tennessee...and far
northern Mississippi.

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 071233Z - 071400Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...A watch may eventually be needed across western Tennessee
and vicinity.

DISCUSSION...A well-developed squall line exists this morning from
north-central Arkansas into southeast Oklahoma. Sporadic, mostly
sub-severe, wind gusts have been evident along this line this
morning. Ahead of this line, a cluster of storms has developed
within a warm-air advection regime across Arkansas. A few stronger
cells have developed within this cluster, but do not expect this
activity to produce a greater/widespread severe weather threat. The
greatest risk is associated with the squall line farther west, and
whether it maintains intensity as it moves east. At least some
heating appears likely this morning along the southern edge of the
upper-level cirrus shield.  Therefore, a severe thunderstorm watch
may be needed at some point to address this threat, but a watch is
not anticipated for the preceding cells/cluster at this time.

605 AM CDT Sat Jun 7 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Central and Northern Arkansas

* Effective this Saturday morning from 605 AM until NOON CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A couple tornadoes possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely
  Isolated large hail events to 1 inch in diameter possible

SUMMARY...A line of intense thunderstorms over northwest Arkansas
and eastern Oklahoma will track eastward through the morning across
the watch area.  Damaging winds along the leading edge of the storms
is the primary concern, although occasional tornadoes are also a
possibility.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 65 statute miles
north and south of a line from 50 miles west northwest of
Russellville AR to 40 miles east southeast of Batesville AR. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU3).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 381...WW 382...

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 1 inch. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 60 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean
storm motion vector 28035.

Mesoscale Discussion 1153
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0354 PM CDT Fri Jun 06 2025

Areas affected...eastern New Mexico and portions of Southwestern
Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 062054Z - 062300Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Supercells capable of large to very large hail, damaging
winds, and a couple of tornadoes likely this afternoon and evening.

DISCUSSION...Recent satellite imagery shows deepening cu across the
dryline and high terrain of eastern New Mexico. Dew points in this
region are in the upper 50s to 60s with MLCIN slowly eroding across
far southeastern New Mexico where temperatures are in the 90s.
Trends would suggest convective initiation may be delayed from
timing in most CAM guidance but should occur over the next couple of
hours. 

Strong deep layer shear around 50-55 kts will promote supercells
initially capable of large to very large hail and damaging wind.
Through time this evening, storms will be moving into a very
unstable and strongly sheared air mass across southwestern Texas. As
the low-level jet strengthens, an increase in hodograph curvature
and increasing 0-1 km SRH will likely lead to an increase in tornado
potential. A watch will likely be needed this afternoon/evening to
cover this threat.

Mesoscale Discussion 1152
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0347 PM CDT Fri Jun 06 2025

Areas affected...Eastern Kentucky

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 377...

Valid 062047Z - 062145Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 377
continues.

SUMMARY...The wind-damage threat appears to be diminishing, and the
watch may be canceled prior to 23z.

DISCUSSION...The earlier convective band has shown consistent signs
of weakening, with reduced echo tops, reflectivity and lightning
flash rates.  Though moderate buoyancy persists downstream from the
storms into eastern KY, the lack of additional surface heating
(clouds and later afternoon sun angle) and relatively weak vertical
shear suggest that any substantial/sustained uptick in storm
intensity is unlikely.  Thus, if recent trends persist, the watch
could be canceled prior to the 23z expiration.

Mesoscale Discussion 1151
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0329 PM CDT Fri Jun 06 2025

Areas affected...Western Kentucky and northern parts of
western/middle Tennessee

Concerning...Tornado Watch 376...

Valid 062029Z - 062130Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 376 continues.

SUMMARY...The threat for occasional wind damage and a couple of
tornadoes continues.

DISCUSSION...An increasingly complex surface pattern is evolving
within tornado watch 376, as a result of multiple bands/clusters of
storms and associated rain-cooled outflow.  The convective clusters
are occurring east of a remnant MCV approaching the lower OH Valley,
on the northern edge of an unstable warm sector.  Regional VWPs show
40-50 kt midlevel flow with the MCV (and associated deep-layer
vertical shear), but thus far low-level hodograph curvature/SRH has
remained somewhat limited where the majority of the convection is
occurring.  There is still some potential for embedded circulations
with an attendant tornado threat where favorable storm/boundary
interactions occur.

Mesoscale Discussion 1150
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0310 PM CDT Fri Jun 06 2025

Areas affected...Eastern Tennessee...northeast Alabama and far
northwest Georgia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 062010Z - 062145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered thunderstorms with isolated wind damage and/or
marginally severe hail will persist for the next few hours, but the
need for a watch is uncertain.

DISCUSSION...Scattered thunderstorms have formed in the unstable
warm sector from northern AL into middle and eastern TN.  This area
of convection is removed to the east-southeast of the remnant MCV
over southeast MO, and local VWPs show correspondingly weak
flow/vertical shear.  Some loose clustering of storms may occur with
outflow mergers through late afternoon/evening, but it is not clear
that any organized clusters will emerge from the storm mergers. 
Thus, it is not clear that a severe thunderstorm watch is necessary.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 378
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
145 PM MDT Fri Jun 6 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  East-Central and Southeast Colorado

* Effective this Friday afternoon and evening from 145 PM until
  900 PM MDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A couple tornadoes possible
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 3.5
    inches in diameter likely
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 75
    mph possible

SUMMARY...Widely scattered are forecast to develop this afternoon
near Interstate 25 and intensify as this activity moves east into
the plains.  A few supercells are likely with the more intense
supercells potentially capable of very large hail up to 3.5 inches
in diameter.  The risk for a couple of tornadoes appears greatest
during the late afternoon into the early evening when low-level
shear will strengthen.  The threat for severe gusts will probably
become more prevalent this evening as storms increase in coverage.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 70 statute miles
east and west of a line from 35 miles north of Limon CO to 40 miles
west southwest of Springfield CO. For a complete depiction of the
watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU8).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

Mesoscale Discussion 1143
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0746 AM CDT Fri Jun 06 2025

Areas affected...Eastern Oklahoma far southern Mississippi...and
northwest Arkansas

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 375...

Valid 061246Z - 061415Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 375
continues.

SUMMARY...A damaging wind/tornado threat should persist for a few
more hours.

DISCUSSION...A line of storms continues to produce sporadic
damaging/severe wind gusts with occasional mesovorticies and line
embedded tornadoes. Only around 1000 to 1500 J/kg MUCAPE exists
ahead of the line now. In addition, a 40 knot low-level jet which
helped to maintain the MCS through the overnight period remains
across eastern Oklahoma and far western Arkansas with a weaker
low-level jet across central Arkansas and southern Missouri.
Therefore, as storms continue to move east of the stronger low-level
jet and the low-level jet weakens through the morning, expect this
line of storms to weaken within the weak to moderately unstable
environment.

In the meantime, a 35 knot low-level jet from the KSRX VWP and >200
m2/s2 will continue to support a severe wind/embedded tornado threat
in the near term before this weakening becomes more prevalent by
mid-morning.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0351 PM CDT Thu Jun 05 2025

Areas affected...Parts of the Texas Trans-Pecos

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 368...

Valid 052051Z - 052215Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 368
continues.

SUMMARY...Risk of very large hail continues across parts of the
Texas Trans-Pecos.

DISCUSSION...Splitting supercells are ongoing across the TX
Trans-Pecos -- in an environment with long/fairly straight
hodographs (around 40-50 kt of effective shear) and 2000-3000 J/kg
MLCAPE. Given the continued splitting/semi-discrete mode, very large
hail (3+ inches) remains the primary concern. In particular, a
large/persistent supercell cluster undergoing additional storm
merging west of Fort Stockton should pose a risk of very large hail
and severe wind gusts -- especially given recent signs of southward
propagation.

0346 PM CDT Thu Jun 05 2025

Areas affected...far eastern NM...TX South Plains

Concerning...Tornado Watch 367...

Valid 052046Z - 052245Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 367 continues.

SUMMARY...Supercell hail and tornado potential increasing through 23
UTC.  A strong tornado or two is probable once a dominant
right-moving supercell becomes established.

DISCUSSION...Visible-satellite/radar mosaic shows the
outflow/differential heating zone and maturing updrafts becoming
sustained along the boundary.  Enhanced storm-relative environmental
helicity (SRH) and elongated hodographs and a very unstable airmass
will strongly favor discrete supercell development.  Giant hail is
forecast over the next 1-3 hours with the stronger supercells (3 to
4 inches in diameter).  The tornado risk will markedly increase over
the next 0.5 to 2 hours as storms begin to propagate within the
moist boundary layer with backed low-level flow and enlarged
hodographs.

0333 PM CDT Thu Jun 05 2025

Areas affected...Parts of southwest Kansas

Concerning...Tornado Watch 369...

Valid 052033Z - 052200Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 369 continues.

SUMMARY...Risk of very large hail continues with an eastward-moving
supercell in far southwest KS. Tornado risk may be increasing as
well.

DISCUSSION...Ahead of a weak lee cyclone and surface boundary over
far southeastern CO, a supercell has evolved over far southwest KS.
A long/mostly straight hodograph (around 50 kt of 0-6 km shear) per
DDC VWP and moderate surface-based instability should continue to
favor large to very large hail and locally severe gusts with this
activity. Ahead of this storm, visible satellite imagery still shows
billow cloud structures -- indicating antecedent boundary-layer
static stability. However, the associated sheltered boundary layer
should be accompanied by enhanced low-level SRH, and given the
established mesocyclone, the tornado risk may be increasing.

Mesoscale Discussion 1127
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0320 PM CDT Thu Jun 05 2025

Areas affected...southeast OH...northern WV...southwest PA

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 052020Z - 052215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Strong to locally severe gusts capable of wind damage may
focus across southeast OH eastward into northern portions of WV and
southwest PA through 7-8pm EDT.

DISCUSSION...An MCV evident in radar imagery has moved
north-northeastward across western OH and another portion of this
mid-level vorticity maximum is moving east across south-central OH. 
The southern portion of this larger-scale convective-aided
disturbance is likely acting to enhance thunderstorm development
across the eastern 1/3rd of OH late this afternoon.  Surface
conditions ahead of the storm activity in southeast OH have warmed
into the lower 80s with dewpoints in the lower 60s.  Objective
analysis data shows around 1000 J/kg MLCAPE but effective shear at
or below 20 kt.  As a result, storm organization potential will
likely remain limited in terms of more organized multicellular
modes.  However, the MCV may act to focus thunderstorms and an
isolated risk for damaging gusts for the next several hours across
parts of the upper OH Valley.

Mesoscale Discussion 1126
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0306 PM CDT Thu Jun 05 2025

Areas affected...Parts of central Oklahoma

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 052006Z - 052200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...The risk of severe wind gusts and large hail could
continue spreading eastward across central Oklahoma this afternoon.
Trends are being monitored for a possible downstream watch.

DISCUSSION...A cluster of storms has become increasingly organized
as it tracks eastward along a boundary across west-central OK, as it
interacts with a warm/moist air mass amid 40 kt of effective shear.
While an earlier ACARS sounding from OKC and mesoanalysis suggest
lingering inhibition ahead of the ongoing cluster of storms,
continued diurnal heating amid upper 60s dewpoints and modestly
steep lapse rates could support the maintenance of these storms with
eastward extent across central OK through the afternoon. If this
were to occur, the 40 kt of effective shear would continue to
promote an organized cluster (and possibly embedded supercell
structure) -- capable of severe winds gusts and large hail.
Convective trends are being monitored for a possible watch
downstream of Severe Thunderstorm Watch 366.

Mesoscale Discussion 1125
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0245 PM CDT Thu Jun 05 2025

Areas affected...Parts of northeastern NM into the far western OK/TX
Panhandles

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 051945Z - 052145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...The risk of severe storms capable of producing large hail
and severe wind gusts will increase over the next few hours. The
tornado threat could eventually increase with east-southeastward
extent.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms are developing along a wind shift over
northeastern NM this afternoon. Ahead of these evolving storms,
upper 50s to lower 60s dewpoints are contributing to moderate
surface-based instability -- given steep midlevel lapse rates.
Around 50 kt of effective shear (characterized by a long/straight
hodograph) oriented parallel to the zone of low-level ascent should
support a few supercell clusters as they move east-southeast into
the increasingly unstable air. Initial storms will pose a risk of
very large hail and severe wind gusts. The severe risk becomes more
uncertain with southeastward extent into the western TX Panhandle.
However, if storms can mature into this region, enhanced low-level
helicity would favor an increasing tornado threat as well. Trends
are being monitored for a possible watch over the area.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 371
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
350 PM CDT Thu Jun 5 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Central Oklahoma

* Effective this Thursday afternoon and evening from 350 PM until
  800 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...A cluster of storms with embedded bowing/supercell
structures will likely persist while moving east-southeastward
through central Oklahoma (especially the southern half of the OKC
metro).  Damaging gusts of 60-70 mph and large hail up to 1.5 inches
in diameter will be possible.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 45
statute miles east and west of a line from 40 miles east northeast
of Oklahoma City OK to 60 miles southeast of Oklahoma City OK. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU1).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are

Areas affected...Parts of the southern Great Basin and Southwest

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 051906Z - 052130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Sporadic severe downbursts are possible with high-based
thunderstorms through the afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Widely scattered high-based thunderstorms are evolving
across the southern Great Basin into the Southwest. Diurnal heating
beneath steep midlevel lapse rates (sampled by the 12Z VEF sounding)
and sufficient midlevel moisture are yielding a weakly unstable air
mass. While weak deep-layer flow/shear should generally limit storm
longevity/organization, enhanced evaporative cooling amid the steep
low-level lapse rates will support strong to severe downbursts with
the stronger cores. Severe-gust potential will be maximized with any
small clusters that can develop.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
135 PM MDT Thu Jun 5 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Eastern Colorado
  Far Western Kansas

* Effective this Thursday afternoon and evening from 135 PM until
  800 PM MDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
    inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Widely scattered thunderstorms are forecast to develop and
intensify through the afternoon.  Initially cellular storms will
pose mainly a risk for large hail and severe gusts, but a tornado is
also possible.  This activity will likely evolve into a cluster of
storms towards the evening with the risk for severe gusts possibly
becoming more prevalent.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 90
statute miles east and west of a line from 35 miles north of Akron
CO to La Junta CO. For a complete depiction of the watch see the
associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU0).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 366...WW 367...WW
368...WW 369...

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 450. Mean storm motion vector
28025.

  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Splitting supercells are expected to form early this
afternoon immediately east of the Guadalupe and Davis Mountains, and
spread eastward into the Pecos Valley through this evening.  The
most intense storms will be capable of producing very large hail up
to 3.5 inches in diameter and isolated severe outflow gusts of 60-75
mph.  An isolated tornado or two may occur with favorable storm
interactions in the strongly unstable environment.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 70
statute miles east and west of a line from 20 miles northeast of
Wink TX to 45 miles west southwest of Dryden TX. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU8).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

Tornado Watch Number 367
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
120 PM CDT Thu Jun 5 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  East central and southeast New Mexico
  West central Texas

* Effective this Thursday afternoon and evening from 120 PM until
  1000 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A few tornadoes likely with a couple intense tornadoes possible
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 4
    inches in diameter likely
  Scattered damaging winds likely with isolated significant gusts
    to 80 mph possible

SUMMARY...Scattered supercell development is expected by mid
afternoon, and storms will spread eastward through late evening. 
The initial supercells could produce very large hail of 3-4 inches
in diameter, with an increasing threat for tornadoes (a couple of
which could be strong) as the storms interact with a residual
outflow boundary.  There will also be some potential for upscale
growth by this evening, with the potential for severe outflow winds
up to 75 mph.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 95 statute miles
north and south of a line from 70 miles east southeast of Lubbock TX
to 70 miles north of Carlsbad NM. For a complete depiction of the
watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU7).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

Mesoscale Discussion 1113
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0355 PM CDT Wed Jun 04 2025

Areas affected...Parts of the Texas Trans-Pecos

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 042055Z - 042300Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated large hail and locally severe gusts will be
possible if storms can mature over the Trans-Pecos region this
afternoon.

DISCUSSION...The latest visible satellite imagery shows deepening
boundary-layer cumulus where a stationary front is intersecting the
higher terrain in the TX Trans-Pecos region this afternoon. Isolated
convective initiation is also underway along the TX/MX border. While
weak large-scale ascent and antecedent inhibition cast uncertainty
on storm longevity (especially away from the higher terrain
features), a long/straight hodograph (around 40-50 kt of effective
shear) and moderate-strong buoyancy will conditionally support a
discrete/semi-discrete supercell or two capable of producing large
hail and locally severe gusts. Given the conditional and potentially
localized nature of the threat, a watch is not expected.

Mesoscale Discussion 1112
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0143 PM CDT Wed Jun 04 2025

Areas affected...Parts of southeast Missouri into southern/central
Illinois

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 041843Z - 042115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated strong to severe storms are possible through the
afternoon. The primary concern is locally damaging wind gusts.

DISCUSSION...Widely scattered thunderstorms are evolving
northeastward across southeastern MO -- within a zone of
differential heating along/ahead of the cold front. Despite poor
midlevel lapse rates, heating within cloud breaks amid upper
60s/lower 70s dewpoints is yielding sufficient (albeit weak)
surface-based instability. While deep-layer shear is modest across
the region (20-30 kt of effective shear), small, clockwise-curved
hodographs could still support localized convective organization
into clusters and transient supercell structures. The primary
concern is locally damaging wind gusts, especially with any
localized clustering, though a brief/weak tornado cannot be entirely
ruled out with any mini supercells that can evolve. Given the
expected localized nature of the severe threat, a watch is not
expected.

Mesoscale Discussion 1094

0344 PM CDT Tue Jun 03 2025

Areas affected...North-central Missouri

Concerning...Tornado Watch 359...

Valid 032044Z - 032145Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 359 continues.

SUMMARY...The greatest short-term threat for severe wind gusts,
large hail, and a tornado or two will exist in north-central
Missouri in WW 359.

DISCUSSION...A mature QLCS recently impacted the Kansas City metro
and vicinity and is continuing eastward through WW 359. A
consolidated bow echo is present at the northern extent of the line
(currently approaching Linn County), with a more outflow-dominated
signature present with southward extent. Both areas should continue
to pose a threat for severe wind gusts over the next couple of
hours. Periods of stronger low-level rotation were observed
recently, and some re-intensification is possible given locally
stronger low-level shear. Some semi-discrete cells have also formed
in a convergent zone ahead of the QLCS, which will pose a locally
greater threat for large hail in the short term.

Mesoscale Discussion 1093
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0339 PM CDT Tue Jun 03 2025

Areas affected...portions of eastern IL and northwest IL

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 032039Z - 032245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Severe potential will increase over the next couple of
hours. A new watch downstream from Tornado Watch 359 may be needed
late this afternoon across parts of eastern IA into northwest IL.

DISCUSSION...Airmass recovery has slowly occurred across eastern IA
into northwest IL in the wake of morning convection. Temperatures
have warmed into the upper 70s to low 80s, and dewpoints from 66-72
F are contributing to increasing MLCAPE. With time, vertical shear
is expected to remain favorable for organized convection as the QLCS
across northern MO track east/northeast with time and additional
convection develops along a cold front oriented across eastern IA.
Damaging gusts will be the main hazard with this activity. However,
the VWP at KDVN shows some enlargement of the low-level hodograph,
due in part to a 30-40 kt 850 mb southwesterly low-level jet over
the region, which is also supporting 0-1 km SRH around 100-150
m2/s2. As such, a tornado or two also could occur in addition to
strong gusts. A downstream watch may be needed in the next couple
hours.

Mesoscale Discussion 1092
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0313 PM CDT Tue Jun 03 2025

Areas affected...central OK

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 360...

Valid 032013Z - 032215Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 360
continues.

SUMMARY...Tornado potential may be increasing across central OK.

DISCUSSION...Strong cells have developed just west of the I-35
corridor in central OK. These cells show rotation aloft and the VWP
from KTLX shows an increasing low-level hodograph with 0-1 SRH near
150 m2/s2. Backed surface winds are also noted in surface
observations, along with dewpoints in the upper 60s to low 70s F.
This is contributing to strong instability and further storm
organization and intensification is possible over the next couple of
hours as these storms track northeast across central OK and the
greater OKC Metro area, and a brief tornado or two could occur with
these developing supercells. Additionally, as storms across
southwest OK move into this environment, some tornado and damaging
risk will be possible.

  800 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A couple tornadoes possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...An organizing band of storms will likely move northeast
across the Watch along and north of modified outflow.  Moist low
levels and moderately strong low-level shear across the Watch will
support a risk for a couple of tornadoes.  A threat for damaging
gusts will probably accompany the stronger storms.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 55 statute miles
east and west of a line from 20 miles east northeast of Kirksville
MO to 45 miles south southeast of Olathe KS. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU9).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 60 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean
storm motion vector 24035.

Mesoscale Discussion 1078

0348 PM CDT Mon Jun 02 2025

Areas affected...the Texas Panhandle

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 353...

Valid 022048Z - 022215Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 353
continues.

SUMMARY...An increase in convective intensity is expected over the
next 1 to 2 hours.

DISCUSSION...A well-developed outflow boundary has developed and is
emanating from storms across the western Texas Panhandle. This
outflow has mostly outrun the storms thus far. However, it is
quickly moving toward more favorable instability across the central
and eastern Panhandle. In fact, a boundary is apparent on the AMA
0.5 degree base reflectivity east of the radar which likely
represents the edge of the low 70s dewpoints across the eastern
Panhandle. 

As these boundaries collide, expect strong updrafts which should
strengthen the cold pool and severe wind gusts within the line. The
greatest threat for isolated 80-90 mph wind gusts this
afternoon/evening likely exists from this boundary collision
northeastward. This region has the most favorable diurnal timing and
the expectation for storm intensification as this line moves towards
the greater instability.

0347 PM CDT Mon Jun 02 2025

Areas affected...Northeastern Colorado northeastward through
southwestern MN

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 022047Z - 022245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm development is likely this afternoon and
evening along a cold front across much of central Nebraska and
adjacent areas. Severe wind gusts and large hail will be the main
threats.

DISCUSSION...A Cu field is developing this afternoon across central
Nebraska to the south of a slowly sagging cold front. Very large
instability is present with temperatures rising into the upper 80s
and low 90s F across the region. Continued boundary-layer mixing
should erode any remaining inhibition, supporting convection
initiating in the next couple of hours. A number of factors should
contribute to quickly amalgamating storms, including widespread
initiation, largely line-parallel (and relatively modest) bulk shear
vectors, and ML LCLs between 1500-2000 m AGL. Large hail will be
possible with the strongest cores, particularly early in individual
storms' lifecycles, with a transition to a more widespread wind
threat likely during the evening. A tornado or two cannot be ruled
out amidst possibly complex storm interactions and/or stronger
updrafts interacting with locally enhanced surface vertical
vorticity near the front. A watch is possible this afternoon to
address these threats.

Mesoscale Discussion 1076

0321 PM CDT Mon Jun 02 2025

Areas affected...Portions of West Texas and the Trans Pecos into
southeast New Mexico

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 022021Z - 022115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated large hail and severe wind gusts are possible
this afternoon and into this evening.

DISCUSSION...Moderate instability has developed across the Trans
Pecos and into West Texas with 1500 to 2000 J/kg MLCAPE. Some
convection has formed along the higher terrain from southeast New
Mexico to the Davis Mountains in Texas. A belt of slightly stronger
mid-level flow will overspread this region through the late
afternoon and into the evening, with RAP forecast soundings
indicating 35 to 40 knots of effective shear where southerly or
southeasterly flow remains by 23Z to 00Z. Therefore, a few
supercells are possible with a threat for large hail and severe wind
gusts. 

Large-scale forcing is mostly moving away from the region, so storm
coverage will likely remain isolated.

Mesoscale Discussion 1075
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0247 PM CDT Mon Jun 02 2025

Areas affected...eastern Colorado and western Kansas into far
southwest Nebraska.

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 021947Z - 022115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms are expected this afternoon with a primary
threat of severe wind gusts.

DISCUSSION...A gradient of instability exists across the central
High Plains with dewpoints in the 40s near the Front Range and in
the upper 60s across southwest Kansas. SPC mesoanalysis shows a
weakly unstable, but uncapped environment across southeast Colorado
where cold air associated with the upper low has started to move
east of the terrain. As heating continues and temperatures continue
to cool aloft, expect an uncapped environment across much of eastern
Colorado and western Kansas. In addition, ascent will increase as
the trough advances east. 

Therefore, expect a gradual increase in convective coverage across
northeast New Mexico and eastern Colorado this afternoon.
Eventually, these storms should become more intense as they move
toward greater instability. Some large hail is possible initially,
however, severe wind gusts will be preferred. Very steep lapse rates
will support the potential for some significant severe wind gusts of
80-90 mph this evening (in western Kansas), particularly where any
bowing line segments can develop. 

A watch will likely be needed later this afternoon for the threat
from these storms, and storms which will likely move into southwest
Kansas from watch 353.

Mesoscale Discussion 1074
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0214 PM CDT Mon Jun 02 2025

Areas affected...Southeastern Wyoming and northeastern Colorado into
western Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 021914Z - 022115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm development is likely this afternoon, posing
a threat primarily for severe wind gusts and large hail.

DISCUSSION...Congested Cu are present in visible satellite imagery
across southeastern Wyoming, especially along the higher terrain in
advance of a slowly-southward-sagging cold front. A surface low is
developing in northeastern Colorado, promoting backing southeasterly
low-level flow and some moisture advection into the area. Limited
upper-level cloudiness has supported temperatures rising into the
mid-/upper-70s across the area, likely yielding minimal convective
inhibition in the short term.

As the cold front continues to move southward and a mid-level wave
impinges on the region, scattered thunderstorm development appears
likely in the next couple hours. 12z HREF guidance depicts multiple
stronger updrafts developing off the Laramie Mountains and moving
east into a well-mixed and unstable airmass. Amidst modest bulk
shear values (~30-35 kts) and relatively straight shear profiles,
some splitting supercells and mixed-mode storms are possible. The
primary threats should be large hail and local severe wind gusts
with the stronger cores, especially as they mature in the Nebraska
Panhandle.

Additional thunderstorms are expected in western Nebraska and points
eastward as storms erupt along the cold front later this
afternoon/evening. Trends will continue to be monitored in that
region for possible MCD/watch issuance there.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 356
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
345 PM CDT Mon Jun 2 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Eastern Colorado
  Western Kansas
  Far Southwest Nebraska

* Effective this Monday afternoon and evening from 345 PM until
  1000 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Widespread damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 85
    mph likely
  Isolated very large hail events to 2 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...A few thunderstorm clusters are forecast to move into the
Watch area this afternoon and persist into the evening.  Strong
buoyancy and large surface temperature and dewpoint spreads will
favor efficient thunderstorm downdrafts capable of severe gusts. 
Large hail may accompany the stronger thunderstorm cores this
afternoon into the early evening before thunderstorm outflow becomes
more prevalent.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 90
statute miles east and west of a line from 55 miles west northwest
of Mccook NE to 45 miles west of Liberal KS. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU6).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 353...WW 354...WW 355...

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 75 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
22035.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 355
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
210 PM MDT Mon Jun 2 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Northeast Colorado
  Nebraska Panhandle
  Southeast Wyoming

* Effective this Monday afternoon and evening from 210 PM until
  800 PM MDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 75
    mph possible
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
    inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Scattered thunderstorms are forecast to develop and
intensify through the afternoon and gradually spread east into the
evening.  A mix of supercells and multicells are expected, with
large hail and severe gusts the primary hazards with the stronger
thunderstorms.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 75
statute miles east and west of a line from 50 miles north of
Torrington WY to 35 miles south of Akron CO. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU5).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 353...WW 354...

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 65 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
26030.

Mesoscale Discussion 1064
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0337 PM CDT Sun Jun 01 2025

Areas affected...Parts of central into southeast Texas

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 352...

Valid 012037Z - 012200Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 352
continues.

SUMMARY...The risk of large hail and severe wind gusts continues
across Severe Thunderstorm Watch 352.

DISCUSSION...A couple semi-discrete supercells continue to track
southeastward along the stationary boundary from central into
southeast TX -- along the east/southeastern periphery of around 2500
J/kg MLCAPE. While these storms are generally becoming removed from
this stronger instability, they will still pose a risk of isolated
large hail and locally severe gusts in the near term. To their
northwest, fresh updrafts are evolving along the stationary boundary
near Waco TX. Given that these evolving storms will track
southeastward through the strongest instability amid 40 kt of
effective shear, gradual intensification into semi-discrete
supercells is also possible -- posing a risk of large to very large
hail and severe wind gusts.

Mesoscale Discussion 1063
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0213 PM CDT Sun Jun 01 2025

Areas affected...Parts of western/central North Carolina and far
northern South Carolina

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 011913Z - 012145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Widely scattered thunderstorms are expected to continue
developing/advancing eastward across western/central NC and far
northern SC through the afternoon. The strongest storms will be
capable of producing locally damaging wind gusts and marginally
severe hail. The severe threat is expected to remain too isolated
for a watch.

DISCUSSION...Along the southern periphery of a large-scale trough
over the Northeast, VWP data and earlier 12Z soundings sampled a
belt of 40-50 kt midlevel westerly flow across NC. Here,
differential heating along a weak E/W-oriented surface boundary is
supporting isolated to widely scattered showers, which should
continue to deepening into thunderstorms -- given sufficient (albeit
weak) surface-based instability. The moderate/strong westerly flow
aloft is yielding elongated/mostly straight hodographs (around 40 kt
of effective shear), which could promote localized convective
organization into small clusters capable of locally damaging wind
gusts and perhaps marginally severe hail. Current thinking is that
the overall severe threat will remain too isolated for a watch,
though convective trends will be monitored.

Mesoscale Discussion 1062
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0153 PM CDT Sun Jun 01 2025

Areas affected...central Colorado and north-central New Mexico

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 011853Z - 012130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms will continue to develop through the
afternoon. Instability will support at least some potential for hail
and gusty thunderstorm outflows. However, the lack of stronger
deep-layer shear should limit the overall severe threat to being
more transient in nature. A watch is not likely.

DISCUSSION...Terrain-driven low-level convergence has resulted in
the development of convection across the higher terrain of central
Colorado and north-central New Mexico. To the east of the higher
terrain, surface dewpoints in the 50s coupled with diurnal heating
has resulted in a corridor of MUCAPE between 1000-2000 J/kg, with
the higher values tied to higher surface moisture. Despite
sufficient instability for storm maintenance, deep-layer shear is
weak, with effective-layer shear generally less than 20 knots should
limit the ability for updraft organization. The result should be
updrafts initially tied to the terrain, where low-level convergence
will force ascent. Isolated hail and perhaps a strong wind gust or
two may be possible with these terrain-driven storms.

With time, aggregate cold pools may move off the terrain and into
the high-elevation plains adjacent to the mountains allowing for
additional thunderstorm development. Here, continued heating will
allow most-unstable CAPE to continue to increase until convective
cloud debris overspreads the area reducing insolation. However,
MUCAPE around 2000-2500 J/kg will remain possible. Forecast
soundings indicated that some increase in effective-layer shear, but
still generally below 30 knots. This may allow for some
conglomeration of updrafts and at least transient multi-cell
clusters capable of producing large hail and a strong wind gust or
two.

Given the anticipated isolated/transient nature of any organized
severe threat (should it develop) a watch is not anticipated.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 352
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
140 PM CDT Sun Jun 1 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  North-Central and East Texas

* Effective this Sunday afternoon and evening from 140 PM until
  1000 PM CDT.

Mesoscale Discussion 1060
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0705 AM CDT Sun Jun 01 2025

Areas affected...South-central Florida Peninsula

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 011205Z - 011400Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...An isolated tornado threat may continue for the next two
to three hours across south-central Florida. The threat is expected
to remain localized, and weather watch issuance appears unlikely,
although trends will be monitored.

DISCUSSION...An east-to-west band of strong thunderstorms is ongoing
across south-central Florida, along a zone of somewhat focused
low-level convergence. The storms are being supported by a shortwave
trough that is moving through the eastern Gulf. A mid-level jet
streak is analyzed by the RAP from the eastern Gulf extending
eastward across the Florida Peninsula. This jet has strengthened
deep-layer shear over south-central Florida into the 40 to 50 knot
range, according to the RAP. This will support isolated supercell
development this morning. Although RAP forecast soundings across
south-central Florida suggest that low-level shear is not
particularly strong, storm-relative helicity could be locally higher
near the zone of low-level convergence. As a result, transient
supercells could be capable of producing low to mid-level rotation,
with a brief tornado possible. Marginally severe wind gusts could
also occur. The threat should remain localized, and watch issuance
is currently not expected.

Mesoscale Discussion 1059
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0622 AM CDT Sun Jun 01 2025

Areas affected...Southern Oklahoma...North Texas

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 351...

Valid 011122Z - 011315Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 351
continues.

SUMMARY...A few strong thunderstorms, with isolated severe gusts or
hail, will be possible over the next few hours. However, any threat
should remain localized, and weather watch issuance is not expected
to the south of the current watch.

DISCUSSION...A cluster of thunderstorms is ongoing in south-central
Oklahoma, which is near a 500 mb jet analyzed by the RAP. This
cluster will continue to move southward across the remainder of
Oklahoma into parts of north Texas over the next few hours. Any
severe threat associated with the cluster will likely remain
localized and brief, primarily due to weak instability. For this
reason, weather watch issuance is not expected to the south of the
ongoing watch. 

As the outflow boundary, associated with the cluster, stalls over
north Texas later this morning, it will likely become a focus for
new convective development. Through that time, the situation will
continue to be monitored for changes in severe weather potential.
